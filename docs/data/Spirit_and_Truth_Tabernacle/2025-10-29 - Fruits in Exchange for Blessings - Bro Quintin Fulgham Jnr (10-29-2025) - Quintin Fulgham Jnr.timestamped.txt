[7:39] &gt;&gt; And we ask the musicians just to play a
[7:41] little bit softly as we go to the Lord
[7:43] in prayer.
[7:45] Precious Lord, [music] oh God, we come
[7:47] before you, Lord, uh another
[7:49] opportunity, oh Lord God, to come before
[7:51] [music] your presence, oh Lord God.
[7:54] Lord, we realize, oh Lord God, that it's
[7:56] it's amazing grace, [music] oh Lord
[7:58] Jesus Christ. Oh Lord, it's your
[8:00] predestinative knowledge, oh Lord God.
[8:02] Your predestinative [music]
[8:04] uh uh love, oh Lord, that you had for us
[8:06] before the foundation of the world, Lord
[8:08] God, that we could come before you, oh
[8:11] Lord. [music]
[8:11] Oh God, to come and give you praise, oh
[8:13] Lord God, to know to know your mind, oh
[8:16] Lord, to know your [music] heart, oh
[8:17] Lord Jesus Christ, to know the deep
[8:19] things, oh Lord God, Lord, while the
[8:22] world, oh Lord Jesus Christ, is [music]
[8:24] is busy going to and fro, oh Lord God.
[8:27] Lord, this is your creation, oh Lord
[8:29] [music] God, all of these men were
[8:31] created in your image, oh Lord Jesus.
[8:34] But Lord God, you had something special
[8:36] for this group right here, oh Lord Jesus
[8:38] [music] Christ. Lord, that you would put
[8:40] it on our hearts, oh Lord God, to reveal
[8:42] yourself to us, oh Lord God. Lord, that
[8:45] you would be concerned for our trials,
[8:47] oh Lord God, our struggles, oh Lord God.
[8:50] Many [music] are sick and afflicted, oh
[8:52] Lord Jesus Christ. Many are are are
[8:54] dependent on a word from you, oh Lord
[8:57] Jesus [music] Christ. Many have been
[8:58] praying, oh Lord God. Many have been
[9:00] standing during the storm, oh Lord God.
[9:02] Many have been worshiping you, oh Lord
[9:04] God. Lord, you haven't spoke [music] a
[9:06] word, oh Lord Jesus Christ. But Lord, oh
[9:09] God, you created these people [music]
[9:11] with something on the inside. The
[9:13] prophet explained, oh the six sense, oh
[9:16] Lord God, [music] that oh it may it may
[9:18] not look like things are happening. It
[9:20] may not look like the situation is
[9:22] turning around from the physical senses,
[9:25] oh Lord God. Lord, we may not be able to
[9:27] [music] comprehend, oh Lord, the way
[9:28] out, oh Lord God, or the way through, oh
[9:30] Lord God.
[9:31] &gt;&gt; [music]
[9:31] &gt;&gt; But God, you gave us this six sense down
[9:34] in our souls. Oh Lord God, [singing]
[9:36] that to say amen to the word regardless
[9:39] of what we can understand, oh Lord,
[9:40] regardless of what we can see,
[9:42] regardless of what we can experience or
[9:44] feel, oh Lord God, [music] we just want
[9:46] to say amen to your word, oh Lord God,
[9:48] for you are worthy, oh Lord Jesus
[9:51] Christ. [music] You left your throne on
[9:53] high, oh Lord God. You left your majesty
[9:56] to live among us, oh [music] Lord. you
[9:57] put this filthy skin on, oh Lord Jesus,
[10:00] to see our struggles, oh Lord, to feel
[10:02] [music] our struggles. To know what it's
[10:04] like, oh Lord, to get sick. To know what
[10:06] it's like to have financial issues, not
[10:08] have money, oh Lord God, to [music] know
[10:10] what it is to be stressed about c
[10:12] different things. Oh Lord God, to know
[10:14] what it is to face persecution, oh Lord
[10:17] God, Lord, you experienced all of these
[10:20] things, [music] oh Lord God, to be
[10:21] closer to us, oh Lord God. Lord, we
[10:25] thank you, oh Lord God. [music] Let us
[10:27] not take for granted the sacrifice you
[10:29] did, oh Lord God. And then you came back
[10:31] in the form of the Holy Spirit, oh Lord
[10:33] God. Not to dwell beside us, oh Lord
[10:36] God. Not to dwell [music] above us, oh
[10:38] Lord, but to dwell with inside of us, oh
[10:40] Lord Jesus Christ. So that when we would
[10:43] speak, it'd be just as good as if you
[10:45] would set it from heaven, oh Lord God.
[10:48] Lord, we [music] thank you, oh Lord God.
[10:50] Be with us in this message, oh Lord God.
[10:52] Touch the needs of the people, Lord. May
[10:53] you speak a word, oh Lord God.
[11:04] Amen. God bless you saints. I hope you
[11:07] guys have been having a wonderful week.
[11:10] You know, I've been going through a lot
[11:11] of different things recently, but um I'm
[11:14] learning that, you know, God's still
[11:17] God. You know, God is still good. You
[11:20] can still have joy. You know, you can
[11:22] still have peace. uh you can still have
[11:25] uh gentleness and meekness. You know, I
[11:27] can still go to work with a smile on my
[11:29] face and it just feels like everything
[11:31] is falling falling apart. Uh so it is a
[11:35] good thing to be a Christian. So we're
[11:37] going to start our uh reading from John
[11:40] chapter 15 uh verse 16 right before we
[11:45] uh before you get seated.
[11:48] And just one simple verse we're going to
[11:50] read here to kind of set the foundation.
[11:53] It says, "Ye have not chosen me, but I
[11:56] have chosen you and ordained you that ye
[11:59] should go and bring forth fruit and that
[12:02] your fruit should remain that whatsoever
[12:05] ye shall ask of the father in my name,
[12:08] he may give it you." All right. So add a
[12:11] blessing to his word. You may take your
[12:13] seats. Uh so this is just a little a
[12:16] little message for this Wednesday. Um
[12:19] the Lord gave me a title uh called uh
[12:22] fruits in exchange for blessings, right?
[12:26] Uh and fruits are ve are something very
[12:29] very important to God. uh as we see in
[12:32] the uh in the Old Testament about we
[12:34] know we know the principles that the uh
[12:37] the Jewish had for uh the first fruits
[12:40] meaning that when you had a harvest you
[12:41] know these these people God's people
[12:44] used to be farmers and so they would go
[12:45] out and they would till the land and
[12:47] they would they would uh put down
[12:49] certain seeds and they would grow them
[12:50] and it was a lot of work that they had
[12:52] to do and when they got their harvest
[12:54] back uh you know God expected them to
[12:58] give him the fruit first Right? And in
[13:01] doing so, by giving God those first
[13:04] fruits, it ensured their blessings would
[13:06] be coming on the way. Right? So here we
[13:09] see God in John 15:16
[13:13] establish this order uh by the word that
[13:16] his purpose is to make sure you bring
[13:19] forth fruit.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; Right? So God is uh a farmer himself and
[13:24] a gardener, right? and we are uh his
[13:27] seed and he wants to make sure that all
[13:30] of us are bearing fruit as well. Right?
[13:33] So first fruit then comes the blessing.
[13:37] So God has likened man uh like to a seed
[13:40] and God's purpose for a seed is two
[13:42] things. It's for it to grow and mature
[13:45] and then the second thing is after
[13:47] maturing it's to bear fruit and not just
[13:50] to bear fruit or any fruit but good
[13:52] fruit. Right? So, we're going to turn to
[13:55] Galatians uh 5 uh 22- 23 and just read a
[14:00] verse that we all are very very familiar
[14:02] with.
[14:07] And it reads, "But the fruit of the
[14:09] spirit is love, joy, peace,
[14:12] longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,
[14:14] faith, meekness, temperance. Against
[14:18] such there is no law." So these help to
[14:23] guide us as God seeds to know what his
[14:27] fruits are and what he expects to see
[14:30] out of us. Right? And we have to be
[14:33] careful though because you know trying
[14:36] to follow God can get a little tricky at
[14:38] times when you don't understand how he
[14:40] operates because this is all based on
[14:42] grace. We all sing amazing grace. It's
[14:44] all based on grace and fruits aren't
[14:46] something that you have to try to
[14:48] manufacture. Right? Jesus told Jesus
[14:52] told us in John that we didn't choose
[14:54] him, he chose us. Right? So that's the
[14:57] grace. And he not only did he chose us,
[14:58] he chose us to bear fruit,
[15:00] &gt;&gt; right? So it's his word. So the
[15:03] obligation then for a man is just to
[15:06] receive the Holy Spirit, right? Which is
[15:08] the seed of God, right? Because the
[15:11] fruits of the spirit of uh is is of
[15:14] course is the spirit and the seed comes
[15:15] from the man. And when you receive the
[15:17] baptism of the Holy Spirit, these fruits
[15:20] just naturally come.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham explained it how, you
[15:24] know, you can't tell a crow to put
[15:26] peacock feathers on, right? He tries to
[15:28] put the peacock feathers be a peacock.
[15:29] It's like, no, you're not a peacock.
[15:31] You're trying to manufacture something
[15:32] that you're not. But the Bible, Jesus
[15:35] Christ made it imperative. He said, "Ye
[15:37] must be born again."
[15:38] &gt;&gt; Because he realized that our first birth
[15:41] was a wrong birth. Right? And so then by
[15:44] being rejuvenated and being reborn of
[15:46] God, you know, God is both male and
[15:49] female, mother and father, and has the
[15:52] ability to give birth to children
[15:54] himself. And when you are born of God,
[15:57] you take on the complete image of God.
[16:00] Right? So now you are born in his image.
[16:02] You are born in his likeness. And now he
[16:05] can talk to you. Right? So you have his
[16:07] you have his uh characteristics. You
[16:09] know, I I I have some characteristics of
[16:11] my mother. I have some characteristics
[16:13] of my father. You know, as I grow up
[16:14] older, a lot of times you may try to run
[16:17] from those characteristics, you know,
[16:18] because you want to be your own person.
[16:20] But you came from your mother and you
[16:22] came from your father. And sooner or
[16:24] later, you're going to see those
[16:25] attributes are going to be expressed.
[16:27] You may go off into the world and try to
[16:29] act like your act like the friends and
[16:31] act like try to act like so and so and
[16:33] act like this so- and so, but sooner or
[16:35] later the attributes that your mother
[16:38] and father deposit inside you are going
[16:40] to show, right? It's going and and you
[16:43] might try to hide behind it, but life
[16:46] has a way of expressing what is on the
[16:48] inside, which is a good thing. We want
[16:50] that as believers, right? Because when
[16:53] we get into a pinch and something really
[16:55] presses us down, we want to be able to
[16:57] have a God-sized reaction come up,
[17:00] right, to to guide us and lead us into
[17:03] these different situations. We don't
[17:04] want a coward reaction. So, we want to
[17:06] be born of the spirit because Jesus
[17:08] Christ, whenever a situation came his
[17:11] way, he mastered it completely, right?
[17:14] And it was an example to give for us how
[17:17] we should also master situations
[17:20] completely.
[17:21] &gt;&gt; Right?
[17:22] &gt;&gt; So, so it's not through man's effort,
[17:25] right? Because a lot of times, you know,
[17:27] Christians get caught into this ism
[17:29] where it's called legalism.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; And it's a it's a it's a horrible,
[17:33] horrible spirit where it's trying it's
[17:36] basically a spirit that's trying to
[17:37] tell, you know, someone who is already a
[17:40] son of God how to be a son of God.
[17:43] Right? So it creates confusion, right?
[17:46] Because it's trying to tell you to do
[17:48] something that you already know how to
[17:49] do, right? But it's trying to tell you
[17:50] that you may be doing it incorrectly. So
[17:53] God doesn't want these legalistic ideas
[17:56] to be a part of you. Just be born again
[17:58] and you'll naturally just show these uh
[18:02] uh decisions, right? So go so God is the
[18:05] one that is that by his grace has
[18:07] ordained you to bear fruit. and all he's
[18:09] wanting to do is come into your life and
[18:12] to fulfill that promise which was his
[18:15] word to each and one of you personally
[18:17] right on a personal level. So we're
[18:19] going to turn to Matthew 7 and we're
[18:21] going to read uh verses 16 through 20
[18:25] just to get a little bit more of this uh
[18:28] build this foundation of uh fruits.
[18:32] And this is also another Bible verse
[18:34] that, you know, were very very uh common
[18:36] with
[18:38] um seasoned saints. They're uh very very
[18:40] common. So it reads, "Ye shall know them
[18:43] by their fruits.
[18:45] Do men gather grapes of thorns or figs
[18:47] of thistles? Even so, every good tree
[18:50] bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt
[18:52] tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good
[18:54] tree cannot bring forth evil fruit,
[18:57] neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
[18:59] good fruit." That's a really good
[19:01] example. like, you know, if I was if my
[19:03] dad, you know, my dad's very good at
[19:06] math, right? So, naturally, I'm going to
[19:09] have some math abilities inside of me,
[19:12] right? So, I can't if if my dad didn't
[19:14] have astronaut abilities, I can I can go
[19:17] out here and try to learn to be an
[19:18] astronaut all I want, right? But if
[19:20] those abilities weren't inside of me and
[19:22] deposited me, I can't show them, right?
[19:24] So, when you're born of God, you know, a
[19:26] lot of times, you know, people people
[19:28] get the mistake of trying not to sin.
[19:30] That's not the goal, right? That'll
[19:33] they'll they'll they'll So, and they'll
[19:35] make a bunch of isms saying, "Okay,
[19:37] well, okay, I can justify doing this
[19:39] thing, right? But I can't do this
[19:40] thing." And so, everyone is trying to
[19:42] now create their way of what they can
[19:44] and what they can do. But when you are
[19:46] born of the spirit of God, you won't
[19:48] have the desire to even want to sin,
[19:51] right? So, it's it's it's it's not
[19:53] someone trying to force you into some
[19:57] kind of mold. It's just something that
[19:58] is just naturally comes out of you, you
[20:02] know? Uh uh and that's the best way to
[20:04] live the Christian uh life because now
[20:06] you're happy, right? Now you have joy,
[20:09] you know? Can you imagine uh wanting to
[20:12] be saved but not have a relationship
[20:14] with Christ,
[20:15] &gt;&gt; right? So you go to heaven and it's
[20:17] like, okay, well, I'll stay over here.
[20:18] It's like, no, no, no. A Christian, they
[20:21] look more they look past just salvation.
[20:23] Like, I want to be like Jesus. wherever
[20:26] he is, that's where I want to be. And
[20:27] when you have those attributes inside of
[20:29] you, you'll see things from how God sees
[20:31] things. Right? So verse uh 19 says,
[20:35] "Every tree that bringeth not forth good
[20:37] fruit is heed down and cast into the
[20:39] fire." And uh the verse that we want to
[20:42] focus on is verse 20 where it says,
[20:44] "Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know
[20:48] them." Right? And this is a uh uh this
[20:51] is a really really really good verse
[20:53] that we're going to try to unpack here.
[20:55] Uh because you know a lot of times you
[20:57] know people um when they're trying to
[21:00] live their way of what God thinks you
[21:03] know they'll they'll always there's a
[21:05] lot of phrases that a lot of people out
[21:06] there will kind of say and one of the
[21:08] phrases is only God can judge me.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; Right? That's one of the default phrases
[21:13] when people are living a life that they
[21:15] should not be living. Right? But they
[21:17] want to feel justified. They want to uh
[21:19] uh they want to have some kind of
[21:21] emotional appeal, right? So that you can
[21:23] kind of like feel sympathy or something
[21:25] like that. But in the beginning of
[21:27] chapter Matthew 7, you know, God said,
[21:30] "Judge not."
[21:32] So, but then he comes down in verse 12
[21:34] and says, "By the fruit you shall know
[21:36] them." So there's a difference between
[21:39] judging and identification. Right? And a
[21:42] lot of times people get those things uh
[21:45] mixed up. So if I say a lemon tree is a
[21:48] lemon tree, I'm not judging the tree.
[21:50] I'm just telling you what it is,
[21:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[21:54] &gt;&gt; If I see a if I see a mango tree, if I
[21:56] see an orange tree, I say, "Hey, that's
[21:58] an orange tree. That's a mango tree."
[22:00] I'm not judging it. I have nothing
[22:02] against it. I'm just telling you the
[22:03] fruits that this thing is expressed. And
[22:05] so a lot of times people get offended in
[22:08] identification, but it's your
[22:10] identification.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; How can you be offended about something
[22:13] that you are? Right?
[22:15] &gt;&gt; You see, it doesn't make any sense,
[22:17] &gt;&gt; right? Get a new identification if you
[22:20] don't like the one you have,
[22:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[22:23] &gt;&gt; So, we we know that we have to be able
[22:26] to identify uh these fruits. And we also
[22:29] know that scripture has dual meanings uh
[22:32] to a lot of stuff. And you know, and I
[22:35] like that because fruits represent
[22:38] action, right? It's it doesn't represent
[22:41] words. Fruits are not something that is
[22:44] uh you talk about it or you say it or
[22:47] you say that you have it. Fruits are
[22:49] something that can be observed, right?
[22:51] They need no they need no one to come
[22:54] and uh uh it doesn't need you to say
[22:56] anything about it. Like you know I'm you
[22:58] know I have I'm a almost six feet tall,
[23:01] right? And I get the height from my
[23:03] mom's side. All my uncles are all tall.
[23:05] I don't have to go around saying I'm six
[23:07] feet tall. I'm six feet tall, right? Uh,
[23:11] Joe's got black hair. He doesn't have to
[23:13] go around confessing and professing that
[23:14] he has black hair. He has black hair.
[23:17] That's just what it is, right? And so
[23:19] that's what fruits are. Fruits are
[23:20] things that we can identify on a person
[23:24] without them even having to say
[23:25] anything, right? Which is very, very
[23:28] powerful because the enemy tries to
[23:30] trick people into thinking that they
[23:32] don't have what they have,
[23:33] &gt;&gt; right? And it's uh it's it's one of
[23:36] those things where you kind of have to
[23:38] use the word to fend them off, right?
[23:40] And so I like that because fruits are
[23:42] based on actions. And I like it because
[23:45] God uses that theme as a tool to uh as a
[23:49] tool, I guess, or a navigation system or
[23:52] uh an a mirror system uh to show you
[23:55] where you are personally at in your
[23:57] Christian journey. All right?
[24:00] Because God made the promise, you're
[24:03] going to bear good fruit, right? It's
[24:05] his promise.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; It's not your promise. That's the
[24:09] beautiful thing I love about salvation.
[24:11] It wasn't me looking for a father. I was
[24:13] always his father. I was always his son.
[24:15] I always belonged to God. And I'm just
[24:18] came on I just came on earth through uh
[24:20] uh through the wrong birth. And I'm just
[24:22] now realizing where I always was
[24:25] belonging, right? And I love that
[24:27] because it shows this just grace on
[24:29] God's mind that he would want to give
[24:32] birth and have relations with someone
[24:34] like me and that somebody like me who uh
[24:37] you know once used to be bored when I
[24:39] was in church when I was when I was when
[24:41] I was a kid growing up and I'd be
[24:43] falling asleep and just bored ready to
[24:44] go home and I because I didn't
[24:46] understand but as I grew spiritually I
[24:49] began to realize that hold on a second
[24:51] there's just something that's connecting
[24:53] with the word there's just something
[24:54] when I hear the word and I hear God's
[24:56] voice. It's just there's something
[24:58] connecting like, you know, there's
[24:59] there's certain things that I used to do
[25:01] in life that I just don't have any
[25:03] interest anymore. And there's certain
[25:05] things, you know, where it's kind of I
[25:06] get convictions when I see other people
[25:08] do it and I try to follow and I'm like,
[25:10] man, you know, they these guys can do it
[25:12] freely, but me, there's something
[25:14] blocking on the inside that I don't know
[25:16] what that thing is, right? And so, I
[25:19] love that because it's just unveiling,
[25:21] right? So grace is an unveiling thing of
[25:25] uh what and who you are as you have
[25:27] belonged to God. So now God knows
[25:30] everything right. So God knows
[25:32] everything. He knows the beginning from
[25:33] the end. He knows what stage you are in
[25:36] life. He knows what you need in order to
[25:39] progress in order to produce fruits,
[25:41] your maturity and the types of fruit
[25:43] that you need, the types of fruit that
[25:45] you lack. He knows all of these things.
[25:48] But the prophet told us that um God is a
[25:51] gentleman, right? So he's not an
[25:53] enforcer. He doesn't like to force
[25:55] himself on people. He's a gentleman.
[25:57] He's a gentle spirit. The fruit of the
[25:59] spirit is gentleness, right? It's not uh
[26:02] like a communistic where he's trying to
[26:04] force people to do. So he doesn't want
[26:06] to force you to change, right? He
[26:08] doesn't want to force you to bear these
[26:09] fruits, right? And and sometimes, you
[26:13] know, he may come and tell you these
[26:15] things that you want to do. But
[26:16] sometimes people don't listen to those
[26:18] things, right? So God has a um God has a
[26:21] mechanism, right? And what he does is he
[26:24] allows pressure to press you, right? He
[26:26] allow pressure from external uh forces
[26:30] and things to press you and compress
[26:31] you, right? And what that does is it
[26:34] makes you a witness to your own fruits
[26:38] and what you're bearing and what you're
[26:39] not bearing, right? So that it's not
[26:41] coming from his mouth, it's what you
[26:43] see, right? When you're going through a
[26:45] pressure and you act a certain way and
[26:47] you're supposed to be displaying a
[26:49] certain fruit, but you display another
[26:51] fruit, right, you in your own self know
[26:54] that you ain't displaying the fruit that
[26:56] you need to do. God doesn't have to tell
[26:57] you nothing.
[26:59] &gt;&gt; He turns you into your own witness
[27:01] &gt;&gt; and so you can't run from yourself,
[27:04] &gt;&gt; right? And I and I like that because he
[27:06] made the promise and God can't lie. You
[27:08] have to bear good fruit, right? God is
[27:11] not a liar, right? And so a lot of times
[27:15] the problem with the um with this fruit
[27:18] bearing process is that you know people
[27:21] think that they're at the stage of
[27:23] bearing fruit when they're actually
[27:25] still maturing, right? Uh and maturing
[27:29] of course is is is a uh is an important
[27:31] thing, right? And when you know where
[27:33] you're at in your life by revelation of
[27:36] God, right? or when you catch the
[27:38] revelation of what God says that you
[27:40] need to work on, then it puts you into a
[27:42] position where you can ask him. So now
[27:45] he's not forcing himself on you because
[27:47] you're coming to him, you're saying,
[27:48] "Hey, Lord, I need more love. Lord, I
[27:51] need more faith. Lord, you know, I need
[27:53] more gentleness. I need more meekness."
[27:55] You know, the way I handled this
[27:56] situation at work, you know, there's
[27:58] just something in me. I got in my car
[28:00] and I just said, I did not like the way
[28:02] I felt, but how I handled that. Lord,
[28:04] help me to be better. Lord, help me to
[28:06] give. Help me to have more patience.
[28:08] Help me to have more grace. And then you
[28:11] begin to ask the right questions, and
[28:12] God's like, "All right, that's my child.
[28:14] Now I can come down here and do some
[28:17] work." Right? All right. So, we can
[28:19] fulfill his word. Um
[28:22] um and or what it does, uh it can allow
[28:25] you to have a better understanding of
[28:27] why certain trials come your way.
[28:29] Because a lot of times you'll go through
[28:30] different things in life and you'll be
[28:32] asking, "Well, why is this happening to
[28:34] me?" And it's like just be patient,
[28:37] [snorts] you know, allow the pressure to
[28:39] to press you. Allow the situations to
[28:41] show you where you're at. And that's why
[28:44] it's important for a believer to read
[28:45] their Bible to assess where you're at.
[28:48] Right? The word always tell you uh what
[28:51] what you have, what fruit you have, what
[28:53] fruit you don't have. Right? And that's
[28:54] the thing I love about the Bible. And
[28:56] the prophet said that's something you
[28:57] should do all the time. Christians
[28:59] should always read the word so they know
[29:02] exactly where they're at. Right?
[29:04] So, um, we're going to read from the
[29:07] message the mighty conquerors preached
[29:09] in 57 just to kind of get a little bit
[29:12] of overview to see what kind of what the
[29:14] prophet said about this. Said some very
[29:16] profound things that we want to talk
[29:19] about. And while she's pulling it up,
[29:22] uh, it's a long, it was a long, um, long
[29:25] passage, so I kind of shortened it down.
[29:27] So, essentially, he's talking about the
[29:29] early church, right? the uh Paul's
[29:32] church and they're in the persecution uh
[29:35] uh persecution days where you know
[29:36] they've they had Pentecost filled with
[29:39] the Holy Ghost all the fruits are
[29:41] showing but now they're being persecuted
[29:43] by the Romans right and I'll just go
[29:45] ahead and start reading and it reads as
[29:47] I stood there my heart moved and I
[29:49] raised my hands up to God I said God be
[29:52] merciful the gladiator said thumbs down
[29:54] but I'm saying but I'm saying hands up
[29:57] raise them up oh God and triumph at the
[29:59] last day and what he was saying was that
[30:00] These early Christians, you know, the
[30:03] Romans would put them in a a coliseum
[30:06] and make them fight each other. And when
[30:08] they would become victorious, then this
[30:11] gladiator would come and would decide
[30:13] their fate. And if he put his thumbs
[30:15] down, then they killed that Christian.
[30:16] And if you put a thumbs up, then he let
[30:18] him live. So their lives were at the
[30:21] mercy of these Romans, right? And so,
[30:24] Brother Brandham continues to say, "You
[30:25] promised you would you would do it."
[30:27] that precious faith of the early church
[30:29] that was pure gold said the Bible tried
[30:32] in fire and how they would open the pits
[30:35] of that great arena setting like that
[30:38] only in the bleachers as we call it and
[30:39] the great massive place down there and
[30:41] they will burn them to the stake. They
[30:44] will open the trap doors and open the
[30:46] doors and traps of hungry lions and
[30:47] tigers and they would rush forth on a
[30:50] praying bunch of Christians and drag
[30:52] them from bone to bone. And the faith of
[30:55] those people stood firm. And I like that
[30:58] because God is expecting that kind of
[31:01] faith in the church in this age.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; But the problem is brother Brandham says
[31:06] we get a twofake and it's the end of the
[31:09] world,
[31:10] &gt;&gt; right? All of a sudden, faith is out the
[31:13] window, right? Some little inconvenience
[31:15] happens and we just throw faith out the
[31:17] door. And these people were were being
[31:21] ripped to shred by lions, right? And
[31:24] burned at the stake. And the Bible says
[31:26] that they stood firm on the word in the
[31:30] midst of all that that was going on,
[31:32] right? It makes me ashamed sometime when
[31:34] I think about how I act in some of my
[31:37] trials and I look back at that first
[31:39] church and these people stood in the
[31:41] face of persecution, right? They didn't
[31:44] have the luxuries that we have today and
[31:46] the amenities and things like that. So,
[31:49] um continue reading and it says, "And in
[31:52] the midst of all that, the church growed
[31:55] mightily all the time." And we here we
[31:57] want to focus on verse uh paragraph 20.
[31:59] And after Constantine come over and
[32:01] liberated them from under the Roman
[32:03] persecution and united the church and
[32:06] state together. And it's important for
[32:08] us because when you're going through a
[32:09] trial, right, you can't prematurely end
[32:12] it.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; You cannot prematurely end a trial. If
[32:16] God has a trial for you and has a it has
[32:18] an appointed start time and it has an
[32:21] appointed end time and if you
[32:23] prematurely stop it, it's only going to
[32:26] hurt you in the long run.
[32:28] Not only will it hurt you, but it'll
[32:30] hurt those that are around you because
[32:31] you're connected to a body.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; And God is depending on each piece to go
[32:36] through the path that it has to go.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; And if someone doesn't go through, we
[32:41] all suffer.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; So, continuing on, it's that after
[32:47] constant come over and liberated them
[32:51] under the Roman persecution and united
[32:52] the church and state together. That's
[32:54] where we got Catholic to begin with. And
[32:57] when they did, the church lost more
[32:59] grounds in 10 years than it had gained
[33:02] all through the persecution. They
[33:03] thought they were being freed. But what
[33:06] it did was it pulled them further away
[33:08] from their identity. Brother Brandham
[33:10] says if there is anything that makes
[33:14] Christians lazy, it's when they're on a
[33:17] flowered bed of ease. Right? And a lot
[33:20] of times that's how Christians want we
[33:24] want things. We want things to be easy,
[33:27] right? We want the easy way out. We
[33:29] don't want to suffer. We don't want to
[33:31] have to go through things in order to
[33:33] see Christ shine in our life. We want
[33:35] him to shine with us with us not having
[33:38] to suffer. Right? And that's just not
[33:40] how God does things, right? So he says
[33:44] we don't have it persecution enough. We
[33:47] don't have it hard enough. Always at the
[33:49] chain is the strongest at his weakest
[33:51] length. And a man under pressure is what
[33:54] he is is is what is what he is when he's
[33:58] under pressure. His real true
[34:00] characteristics will show when he's
[34:01] under pressure. Get him all riled up,
[34:04] stirred up, and then you'll see the real
[34:05] man come out. If he's got temper, it'll
[34:09] show. If he's meek and gentle, it'll
[34:12] show itself. put him under pressure once
[34:15] and God puts all his children under test
[34:18] to see whether there's any flaws in
[34:21] them. Right? So God does it on purpose.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Right? God does it on purpose. And when
[34:28] because a lot of times we say we have
[34:30] faith, God's like, "Okay, you got faith.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; All right. Send something along your way
[34:36] and you get a little inconvenience. Man,
[34:38] I just I'm just I just quit." And God's
[34:41] like, "I thought you said you had
[34:42] faith."
[34:43] &gt;&gt; Right? So, God does these things to help
[34:46] uh build our muscles, right? And you
[34:49] know, one of the problems that we have,
[34:51] especially in the message ranks, is we
[34:53] got so many message mystery quotas,
[34:56] right? People aren't born again, but
[34:59] they just repeat what the prophet said,
[35:02] which is nothing wrong with that if you
[35:05] have the right spirit behind it,
[35:06] &gt;&gt; right? Um, you know, we have people that
[35:09] know how to talk about the seals, right?
[35:12] That we have people that know how to
[35:13] talk about the seven thunders and the
[35:14] seven vows and the seven trumpets and
[35:16] the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the true
[35:19] baptism of the Holy Spirit and the the
[35:21] Godhead and all of these things, but
[35:24] mysteries don't help you to produce
[35:26] fruit, right? And so we have a lot of
[35:29] message intellectuals that can quote
[35:31] these things. But when it comes down to
[35:33] fruit, there's nothing there,
[35:36] &gt;&gt; right? So don't be deceived by trying to
[35:39] sound like a message believer. You can
[35:41] actually be a message believer producing
[35:44] fruit.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Right? So mysteries don't help you to
[35:49] produce fruit. You can't be a good
[35:52] brother or sister in Christ just with
[35:54] mysteries. Right? And you can't raise a
[35:57] family with just the mysteries.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; And we've seen that so much in the
[36:02] message where, you know, you'll have
[36:03] fathers and they know who the prophet
[36:06] was and he had these healing campaigns
[36:08] and he had those kind of healing
[36:09] campaigns. But when a child is coming to
[36:12] the father looking for love, he doesn't
[36:14] have it to give.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; And it's like, what are we doing? We
[36:18] read so many message books. you've I
[36:20] mean you read I I remember one time uh
[36:23] when I first first got saved and a buddy
[36:26] of mine he's like man I could just read
[36:28] three messages every single day and I
[36:30] just felt so ashamed because I'm like
[36:31] man I need to be doing that I can't even
[36:33] it's a struggle for me to read one
[36:35] message right you know uh but but I'm
[36:38] kind of glad that you got to your
[36:40] experience has to come from Christ
[36:41] himself because when God calls you it's
[36:44] not another man calling you right and so
[36:46] you know you begin to meditate on these
[36:48] things and what's the point of
[36:50] understanding all the mysteries if you
[36:52] have no fruits to show. What's the point
[36:55] of going to church every single Sunday
[36:57] and Wednesday and fasting and communion
[37:00] and this meeting and you understand this
[37:02] talk and you know brother so and so from
[37:05] uh Tennessee and you know brother so and
[37:07] so from Arizona and you've been to uh
[37:10] Brandham Tabernacle and you have brother
[37:12] Brandham's favorite candy and you have
[37:14] all of these things but when it comes
[37:16] down to the actual life when the
[37:19] pressure comes right there are no fruits
[37:22] which means it's no image of Christ.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; So that means that you've missed the
[37:28] point somewhere,
[37:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[37:31] &gt;&gt; We've missed the point somewhere, right?
[37:34] Um and and I and I can remember as a
[37:36] young uh a young believer, I had a buddy
[37:40] of mine told me that, hey, I'm glad
[37:41] you're excited that you're saved and
[37:43] stuff, but you know, here comes the
[37:45] test. And I didn't take heed to that
[37:47] thing because I was living on cloud
[37:49] nine. And it's like when you get
[37:50] married, you know, the honeymoon phase,
[37:53] you not I mean, you guys are just, you
[37:55] know, y'all ain't got a care in the
[37:57] world, right? But that's because y'all
[37:59] haven't applied pressure on each other.
[38:01] But then let time go. Let time go. Let
[38:04] time go. And then a little bit of
[38:06] pressure comes here and a little bit of
[38:07] pressure becomes there. And the way you
[38:09] looked at them is not how you looked at
[38:11] them when you first saw them when it was
[38:13] all just sitting on cloud nine. you
[38:16] start to notice certain habits, right?
[38:19] Uh and so that's why God gives you a
[38:21] helpmate to help you to see these
[38:22] things. And that's how God is with us
[38:24] with our relationship. So he'll allow
[38:26] because God's perfect. He doesn't need
[38:28] any work done. When he came down in
[38:30] flesh, he mastered life completely. So
[38:34] he has ability to come and get a bride
[38:37] and apply pressure to say, "Hold on a
[38:38] second, you need to work on this
[38:40] &gt;&gt; and hold a second, you need to work on
[38:42] that, and you need to work on these
[38:44] things." He has the right to do it
[38:46] because he lived the perfect life.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Right? So when you get in a relationship
[38:50] with Christ, it's not all rainbows and
[38:53] sunshine,
[38:54] &gt;&gt; right? God expects a certain behavior
[38:56] from you. God expects you to conduct
[38:58] yourself a certain way. God expects for
[39:01] you to act a certain way in not just one
[39:03] situation, but in all situations. You
[39:06] know, sometimes you'll say, "Okay, yeah,
[39:08] well, I'll just forgive him today." And
[39:10] then tomorrow comes and you don't
[39:12] forgive him. But Peter said, "How how
[39:14] much should we forgive him?" And God
[39:16] says 70 times 70, just keep forgiving
[39:19] him. Right? That was the nature of the
[39:21] spirit that was in Christ. But Peter,
[39:23] though he was saved at that time, didn't
[39:26] have the Holy Ghost, wanted the easy way
[39:28] out, right? They wanted the easy way
[39:30] out. They want to be able to forgive one
[39:32] time and that's it. But no, you got to
[39:34] keep forgiving and keep forgiving and
[39:36] keep forgiving. And I didn't I didn't
[39:38] realize what forgiveness was until I got
[39:42] a little bit older. And when people do
[39:45] things to you,
[39:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[39:47] &gt;&gt; And you forgive them
[39:48] &gt;&gt; and then they keep doing it.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; Right. And it's no longer on it's no
[39:54] longer about you know them and you cuz
[39:56] if you make it about you and them,
[39:58] you've lost the fight.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Right. Now it's about you and God. And
[40:01] God's like, "How you going to act?"
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; He done did it again. what is your
[40:06] decision? How do you feel about this
[40:08] thing? Right? And and and they said they
[40:11] was going to make it better, but they
[40:12] haven't changed. What are you going to
[40:14] do? Right? And God has seen these
[40:16] behaviors time after time with Israel.
[40:19] When Israel promised they would serve
[40:20] him, then they'd be back to idols, then
[40:23] they promised they would serve him, then
[40:24] they'd be back to idols. And every
[40:26] single time God was faithful, right? So
[40:29] God wants to see those fruits uh inside
[40:33] of us, right? So, you don't know what
[40:35] you got until God shows you what you
[40:37] got. The Christian life is by
[40:39] revelation, not intellectualism, not
[40:42] reading the message and reading the
[40:44] Bible. Oh, yeah. The Bible says I got to
[40:46] have love. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But let God
[40:48] show you what love is in your life.
[40:50] [snorts]
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; So, going back to the fruits in
[40:53] Galatians chapter uh five, you don't
[40:55] have to turn to the uh the the Bible
[40:57] verse. There's a there's a human
[41:00] phenomena that we like to do. And as
[41:02] humans, we tend to like to rank things,
[41:05] right? We like to put things in a
[41:07] ranking, right? We like to have our
[41:09] favorites, right? And as Christians,
[41:12] believers, sometimes we can rank fruits,
[41:15] right? When we read the Bible and we see
[41:17] these things, we can try to rank the
[41:19] fruits and like these are my top two
[41:21] fruits. I like these fruits over here,
[41:23] right? Um and uh and we'll hyperfocus on
[41:28] certain fruits just to prove that we
[41:30] have the fruits, right? But you're not
[41:33] deceiving anybody because Jesus gave us
[41:35] the ver the Bible verse. He said, "By
[41:36] their fruits, you s you shall know
[41:38] them." So you can't deceive anybody,
[41:40] right? That has fruits. You'll deceive
[41:42] yourself, but you can't deceive anybody
[41:44] that has them. So when it comes to the
[41:46] uh fruits of the spirit, we tend to we
[41:49] tend to like to navigate towards love,
[41:51] joy, and peace, right? We tend to like
[41:53] these things that associate themselves
[41:55] with a flowery ease, right? A flowery
[41:58] bed of ease as the prophet has said,
[42:01] right? And we desire these things the
[42:03] most. So when someone offers you a plate
[42:04] of love or a plate of joy or a plate of
[42:08] peace, I mean, we're quick to gobble it
[42:10] up, right? It's you don't even have to
[42:12] ask a second time. You know, that's what
[42:14] we want. And [snorts] the problem in
[42:16] that thing is that, you know, we like
[42:19] it. We like these things based off our
[42:21] perception of what we want to enjoy of
[42:24] these fruits. But do you know that
[42:26] fruits were meant to be uh expressed in
[42:30] different ways? So we're going to turn
[42:32] to Revelation 10 and we're going to read
[42:34] verses uh 7. Revelations 10. We're going
[42:38] to read verses uh 7-10.
[42:41] says here, "But in the days of the voice
[42:43] of the seventh angel, when he shall
[42:45] begin to sound, the mystery of God
[42:47] should be finished, as he hath declared
[42:49] to his servants the prophets, and the
[42:52] voice which I heard from heaven spake
[42:53] unto me again, and said, Go and take the
[42:55] little book which is open in the hand of
[42:57] the angel, which standeth upon the sea,
[42:59] and upon the earth." And I went unto the
[43:02] angel, and said unto him, Give me the
[43:04] little book. And he said unto me, "Take
[43:06] it and eat it, and it shall be it shall
[43:10] make thy belly bitter, but it shall be
[43:13] in thy mouth as sweet as honey." And I
[43:16] took the little book out of the angel's
[43:18] hand and ate it up, and in my mouth
[43:20] sweet as honey. This thing was the
[43:22] sweetest thing he ever he had ever
[43:23] eaten, right? And as soon as I eated it,
[43:26] my belly was bitter. So something that
[43:29] was a bittersweet uh um you know,
[43:33] experience. And we know that this
[43:35] represents the prophet said this
[43:36] represents the bride receiving the full
[43:38] revelation of God, right? The seed of
[43:41] God, right? And brother Brandham's
[43:43] message was given to us to point to
[43:45] Christ, right? To show us where he was.
[43:48] This is where God is. This is where God
[43:50] is. This is where God is. And when you
[43:51] have the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit
[43:53] points to how you should act, right?
[43:55] It'll lead you to all truths. This is
[43:57] how you should act in this situation.
[43:58] This is how you should act here. This is
[44:00] what you should say here. This is what
[44:01] you should say here if you're if you're
[44:02] if you're listening to it, you know,
[44:04] it's because it's the spirit that um
[44:06] bears the fruit. But the interesting
[44:08] part and the interesting part in that
[44:10] was when John ate the book, uh it was uh
[44:13] like we said, it was a sweet in his
[44:14] mouth, but it was bitter in his belly
[44:16] showing this duality, right? D uh
[44:18] duality. We're going to we're going to
[44:20] uh to better explain this concept, you
[44:22] know, we're going to go back to our
[44:23] example of when someone wants to show
[44:26] love, right? So they got their top
[44:27] fruits and they want to show love,
[44:29] right? They want to do it when it's
[44:32] easy, right? They want to do it when
[44:34] it's when there's a sweetness to it,
[44:36] right? You know, after church, everyone
[44:38] feels good. God bless you, brother. You
[44:41] know, you had a you felt good message, a
[44:45] message of of blessings and all that
[44:46] kind of stuff. You go out to eat and
[44:48] man, I love this brother, man. He's
[44:50] always We always fellowshipping and
[44:52] always talking and they want to love
[44:54] when it's easy, right? That's easy to
[44:57] love. That's that there's no there's no
[45:00] there's no there's no trouble going on.
[45:01] So, it's easy for you to say, "God bless
[45:03] you." Right, when they're doing what you
[45:05] want them to do or they or they're
[45:07] acting the way that you want them to
[45:09] act, right?
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Um, and you know, it's easy to have joy
[45:15] when you have a full bank account,
[45:18] right? Bank account is full, you know,
[45:21] no debts, you know, you you wake up
[45:24] every single morning, man. Yeah. put
[45:26] your savings away, you put your bill
[45:28] money away, and you just got a nice fat
[45:30] nice little sum there. You're like, man,
[45:32] everything is good. You know, you're not
[45:35] worried about what you going to eat.
[45:37] You're not worried about paying this
[45:39] bill or paying that bill. You're not
[45:40] worried about these things, right? So,
[45:42] it's easy to have joy. It's easy to say
[45:46] you have joy, right? You know, uh when
[45:49] you have a uh you got a full belly, you
[45:51] got food, it's easy to have to say that
[45:53] you got peace. like this is peaceful,
[45:55] man. I'm just, you know, I'm just paying
[45:57] my bills. I'm going to work. I'm coming
[46:00] home. I'm listening to worship music and
[46:02] everything is just good, right? It's
[46:04] easy uh to have these things, right? But
[46:08] as soon as the bank account takes a dip
[46:10] for the worse, you know, nobody wants to
[46:14] have joy anymore, right? Those gospel
[46:17] songs you was listening to, they ain't
[46:18] even playing no more. And it's like,
[46:21] what? you know, you was in the car going
[46:25] down the highway, driving 80 miles per
[46:27] hour, singing Maverick music, you know,
[46:30] but as soon as a little struggle comes,
[46:33] it's like just quiet. Coming home from
[46:35] work, just quiet in your car. And it's
[46:37] like, what happened?
[46:41] What happened? You know, you know, your
[46:44] joy was based off of something that it
[46:46] shouldn't have been based off of,
[46:47] &gt;&gt; right? You know, when your health when
[46:50] your health becomes chronic, you know,
[46:52] [snorts] you got all of these people on
[46:54] Instagram that have chronic health and
[46:56] they it's just it's just a woe is me
[46:58] video. It's just a woe is me post, you
[47:00] know? It's just oh, this is my life.
[47:03] This is how life is. And it's like it's
[47:06] like no more peace, right? When you're
[47:08] dealing with chronic stuff, it's like
[47:10] now you just threw the peace out the
[47:11] window, right? So, they want a peace
[47:14] that is sweet in the mouth. They want a
[47:16] love. People want to love that sweet in
[47:18] the mouth. People want enjoy that sweet
[47:20] in the mouth. But as soon it hits soon
[47:22] as things get bitter, they don't want to
[47:23] experience it anymore, right? And you
[47:27] can tell the maturity of a person in the
[47:29] way that they eat and what their diet
[47:31] is, right? That's why Paul taught us,
[47:34] you know, when you was a babe, I gave
[47:35] you milk, right? But when you become a
[47:38] man, I expect you to eat, you know,
[47:41] meat. I expect you to behave with man
[47:43] things. So, your diet is a a reflection
[47:46] of your maturity. And I remember cuz um
[47:50] growing up with my mother, she used to
[47:52] get this this cereal called Special K,
[47:55] right? And it had those little, you
[47:58] know, little flakes that ain't got no
[48:00] taste to them. And it had the
[48:02] strawberries. See, had the flakes in it.
[48:04] And what we would do, what I would do is
[48:06] I would go in there and I grab a
[48:07] handful, pull out all the strawberries,
[48:09] and then put the put the brown stuff
[48:11] right back inside and eat up the
[48:13] strawberries. So then when you when she
[48:16] wanted to go and get some some cereal
[48:18] and she poured it, it was nothing but
[48:20] the little brown flakes. And it's like,
[48:23] where'd they go? You know, but I just
[48:25] wanted the sweet part, right? I just
[48:27] wanted the sweet part, not knowing that,
[48:29] you know, a lot of nutrients was in the
[48:31] brown stuff. But I was a child. I didn't
[48:33] know any better. I just wanted to taste
[48:35] something sweet. And that's how people
[48:37] get with the fruits. You just want the
[48:38] sweet part of it, right? You just want
[48:40] to enjoy the sweet part of love. You
[48:42] just want the sweet part of joy. You
[48:43] just want to you want to be able to
[48:45] praise God when you know everything is
[48:47] going well,
[48:48] &gt;&gt; right? But that's not when fruits show
[48:50] the best,
[48:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[48:53] Um, but it's when things uh turn bitter,
[48:56] that's when uh uh uh we can really
[48:59] really you can really really uh enjoy
[49:02] God. And that's what I've come to learn
[49:05] is that you know in the struggle, you
[49:07] know, that's when God shines the
[49:09] brightest. You would have never known
[49:11] Christ was a light unless there was
[49:13] darkness,
[49:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[49:16] &gt;&gt; You would have never known what it was
[49:18] like to enjoy being with a spouse if you
[49:20] were never lonely. You see what I'm
[49:22] saying? So, it's good to appreciate
[49:24] these moments where you don't got
[49:26] anything, right? Because it helps to
[49:28] propel you when you do get something, it
[49:30] helps you to enjoy that even greater.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; I was talking to my mother and we kind
[49:35] of had a discussion about, you know,
[49:37] going through different trials and
[49:38] tests. And, you know, whenever you get a
[49:41] cold and get a stuffy nose, I mean, your
[49:43] nose is just stuffed up. You're stuck in
[49:45] bed. You can't get up. And it's been
[49:47] happening for two days and then another
[49:49] two days and then a week has gone by and
[49:51] then two weeks have gone by and then
[49:54] finally one day something in your body
[49:56] just clicks, right? And that stuffiness
[49:58] goes away and you walk outside and you
[50:01] smell the fresh air. It's like, man, it
[50:03] ain't never smelt like that before. But
[50:06] that's because you were sick, right? And
[50:08] that was taken away from you and it
[50:10] allowed you to enjoy, right, the smell,
[50:13] right? Because a lot of times we'll take
[50:14] the little things for granted, right?
[50:16] But the storms when they come through,
[50:19] when the pressure comes through and when
[50:21] you're struggling, it helps you to once
[50:23] you overcome it, it helps you to
[50:25] appreciate the little things, the little
[50:27] details. God has things he wants to show
[50:30] you. But sometimes you're not in a
[50:32] position mentally enough to see it. So
[50:34] God's got to let you go through
[50:36] something, right? Sometimes the best
[50:39] revelation that you'll ever get is after
[50:41] the storm comes when Jesus was tempted
[50:44] on the mountain after he overcame the
[50:46] Bible said the angels came and
[50:48] ministered him right they gave him
[50:50] revelation right so it's always after
[50:53] the storm is when you get these um is
[50:56] when these things uh uh these fruits
[50:58] really feel really feel the best right
[51:01] so you know
[51:04] um now there are fruits that we don't
[51:06] want at All there are some fruits we
[51:09] don't want at all as well. Right. Right.
[51:12] Who wants to suffer long? Who wants
[51:15] longsuffering? Who here, you know, when
[51:19] when when we say who wants a blessing?
[51:21] Amen. Everybody wants a blessing.
[51:22] Everybody wants a double double. But
[51:24] when we say who wants longsuffering, who
[51:26] wants to suffer long? If God were to
[51:28] come behind the pulpit and say, "Hey
[51:29] guys, I need somebody to suffer long.
[51:31] Who wants to do it?" Right? No one wants
[51:34] to do that, right? Or who wants
[51:36] temperance? Temperance means
[51:38] self-control. You got to control
[51:40] yourself, right? Nobody wants that
[51:42] because people want to be able to react
[51:44] any old way they want to react, right?
[51:46] And and I'm telling you, you can be 10
[51:49] years old, you can be 30 years old, you
[51:51] can be 70 years old, you're still a
[51:52] child of God, which means there's still
[51:54] some kind of immaturity on the inside of
[51:56] you, right? And God's got to deal with
[51:58] that thing, right? So a lot of times,
[52:00] you know, you know, kids want to grow up
[52:03] so fast. You know, you ain't escaping
[52:05] butt whipping because God still gives
[52:07] butt whoopings no matter how old you
[52:10] are.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; He doesn't stop it, right? I thought I
[52:14] was escaping my dad's belt only just to
[52:17] get a bigger belt. Because when God
[52:19] spanks you, you know, he don't he
[52:22] sometimes he don't hold back, right?
[52:24] When God spans you and throws some
[52:27] sickness on you, you be like, "Man, that
[52:29] belt was nice." Right? That lasted for
[52:31] five minutes, but you've been dealing
[52:33] with this thing for months, right? So,
[52:35] you're just a bigger kid, right? Um, so
[52:39] there are some fruits that we don't want
[52:40] to do, but we have to mature in order to
[52:44] want to accept these things, right? You
[52:46] know, it's like if you give a kid, you
[52:48] know, uh if you have a if you have a
[52:50] plate of broccoli and chicken and you
[52:52] have a plate of cake and cookies and
[52:54] you're like, "Hey, you guys can eat
[52:56] whichever one you want first. Them
[52:58] cookies will be gone in a second."
[53:00] Right. Right. But the problem is it
[53:03] leaves no room for the broccoli, right?
[53:06] And the broccoli has all the vitamins
[53:08] and minerals that you need, right? Those
[53:10] vitamins and minerals will give you the
[53:12] strength to enjoy the sweet things,
[53:14] right? But now you've done. So what they
[53:16] what uh science says is that sugar is
[53:19] empty calories. And what an empty
[53:21] calorie is is it makes you think you're
[53:23] full. So you have a lot of these
[53:25] denominational Christians get all the
[53:27] blessings in the world and think they
[53:30] full of the spirit. And it's a
[53:32] deception.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Right. It doesn't come that way. You
[53:37] have to go through the struggle. God's
[53:40] got to break you down to be a son of God
[53:42] and feel his spirit with you so that
[53:44] you're displaying every single fruit,
[53:47] right? Whether blessings are there or
[53:49] not there, God I'm still God's child.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. But don't don't get it twisted.
[53:56] God wants to bless you.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; That's the key thing is God wants to
[54:00] bless you. So we have to learn to enjoy
[54:02] the process of fruit bearing. It kind of
[54:05] reminds me of, you know, some of the
[54:08] women, you know, childbearing is not an
[54:10] easy thing to do. And, you know, you'll
[54:13] see mothers go through hours and hours
[54:15] of labor and pain and, you know, they
[54:17] deliver the child, two years later, they
[54:19] hold another baby, and they're ready to
[54:21] go through the process again. It's just
[54:22] one of those things where it's just uh
[54:25] it's it's a bittersweet thing where it's
[54:27] a lot of pain to go through, but because
[54:30] it produces such a beautiful thing, it
[54:32] makes it worth it all. And we're all
[54:35] fruit bearers in the spirit, right? And
[54:37] it takes a lot to bear fruit. It is not
[54:40] an easy process. But when you go through
[54:43] it, it's it's it's an enjoyment. It's
[54:45] and that's why some of the times I feel
[54:47] when I go through my trials, it always
[54:49] takes me back to Peter. He said that the
[54:52] trials are more precious than gold.
[54:55] Meaning that the trials you go through
[54:57] are more precious than what you're
[54:58] getting. Right? because you have this
[55:00] confidence inside of you that man, I
[55:03] stood, you know, when when when
[55:05] temptation came and when the enemy threw
[55:08] every single thing. I mean, he came from
[55:10] beneath and above and to the side, he
[55:12] threw that, he threw this, and I stood
[55:15] like God, right? It's more precious than
[55:18] what you could receive, right? And God
[55:21] wants us to uh uh understand these
[55:24] things. And so, like I said, God wants
[55:26] to bless you, though. We have to
[55:28] remember that God wants to bless you.
[55:30] And brother Jack um he talked about
[55:32] these things. So when God is asking you
[55:36] to go through a trial, what he's doing
[55:38] is temporarily borrowing your happiness.
[55:41] And brother Jack explained to us that
[55:43] happiness is a feeling you experience,
[55:46] you know, when something is happening.
[55:48] You know, God wants you to be happy,
[55:51] right? So you know how you feel when
[55:52] you're coming to a family dinner, right?
[55:54] and everyone's together and everybody's
[55:56] talking and you're enjoying dinner,
[55:58] enjoying the food, you're happy because
[56:00] this event is happening. God wants you
[56:02] to be happy, right? But when God needs
[56:04] to work on fruits inside, he's got to
[56:06] take that happiness away, right? He may
[56:09] take the happiness away and borrow it,
[56:10] but he doesn't take the joy. The joy has
[56:13] to stay there because it is who you are,
[56:16] right? And so God may temporarily borrow
[56:19] your health, right? God may borrow your
[56:22] kids. Sometimes, you know, we get upset
[56:24] when our kids go wayward or they
[56:27] backslide or certain family members,
[56:29] they backslide and it makes us feel
[56:31] alone. But God just wants to borrow them
[56:33] just to prove, right, that you know uh
[56:36] uh this person uh uh is a real
[56:39] Christian, right? God allowed the enemy
[56:42] to take Job's kids, right? But God came
[56:44] and gave him back to him after the test
[56:46] for Job, right? So God may uh
[56:50] temporarily borrow your financial
[56:52] security, right? But I like how brother
[56:54] Jack said whenever Jesus borrows
[56:57] something, he always pays it back,
[56:59] [snorts]
[57:00] &gt;&gt; right? He's not like some of these
[57:02] people out here, you know, these family
[57:03] members where, you know, they ask you
[57:05] for money and you don't never see him
[57:08] again, right? Jesus is not like that.
[57:11] Jesus likes to pay back. And the thing I
[57:14] like about Jesus is he doesn't just like
[57:16] to pay back in full. He likes to pay
[57:19] back with abundance.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; It's his nature,
[57:22] &gt;&gt; right? So, we know Jesus as the healer.
[57:25] And we know Jesus as the king and the
[57:27] provider. And we know Jesus as the
[57:29] comfort giver and the protector. But
[57:32] once you've gone through the storm, then
[57:34] you get to meet Jesus the investor and
[57:36] Jesus the banker, right? And Jesus the
[57:39] accountant, right? He knows how to
[57:41] balance the book and whatever he
[57:43] borrowed from you, he knows how to
[57:45] multiply it. He knows how to take his
[57:47] calculator out and just multiply that
[57:48] thing and just keep multiplying and
[57:50] multiplying, right? To give you back
[57:52] what you lost with interest. He interest
[57:55] he loves to give back overflow. And in
[57:58] fact, that is a law of God, right? It's
[58:02] a law of God that makes him who he is.
[58:04] Now, the law also works into the
[58:06] negative. And we want to see that just
[58:08] as a contrast. We're going to turn to uh
[58:10] Exodus 2 uh chapter 11.
[58:15] And I'll just go ahead and read read
[58:17] this quickly as time is winding down.
[58:22] And it says here, "And it came to pass
[58:25] in those days when Moses was grown that
[58:27] he went out unto his brother and looked
[58:30] on their burdens. And he spied on
[58:32] Egyptian. And he spotted an Egyptian
[58:34] smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
[58:36] And he looked this way and that way.
[58:37] When he saw that there was no man, he
[58:39] slew the Egyptian and hid him in the
[58:40] sand. And when he went out the second
[58:42] day, behold, two men of Hebrew strove
[58:44] together. And he said to him that did
[58:47] wrong, wherefore smiteest thou thy
[58:50] fellow? And he said, Who made thee a
[58:53] prince and judge over us? That's a
[58:55] that's that's an interesting way to talk
[58:57] about God's anointed. You know, God God
[58:59] is trying to see you deliver. That's an
[59:01] interesting way to to to talk to them,
[59:04] right?
[59:06] um intendest thou to kill me as thou
[59:08] killedest the Egyptian? And Moses feared
[59:11] and said, "Surely this thing uh is
[59:14] known." And we're going to read in the
[59:15] message Respects preached in 61 and I
[59:19] believe it's uh paragraph uh 57
[59:23] and I'll just start reading it. It says,
[59:25] "Then there um okay, I'll read for it.
[59:28] Then there is another man I like to
[59:30] speak of. There is a great mighty
[59:32] prophet by the name of Moses. The people
[59:34] Israel should have understood according
[59:36] to the scripture that God was going to
[59:38] deliver them and was going to bring them
[59:40] out of Egypt. But as soon as God got his
[59:43] man ready and sent him down into Egypt,
[59:46] they had no respects for him, they
[59:49] turned them out and said, "Will you slay
[59:51] us as you did the Egyptian?" Which
[59:54] caused them to stay in bondage an extra
[59:57] 40 years. They stayed in bondage because
[1:00:00] they refused to respect the deliverer
[1:00:02] that come to deliver them. That put them
[1:00:04] back in bondage again. Not because God
[1:00:08] wanted them to stay. The time was
[1:00:10] exactly right. But they stayed 40 years
[1:00:13] over because they refused to accept
[1:00:14] God's provided way of escape. And so I
[1:00:17] want to I want to caution us, you know,
[1:00:19] as God is going through these storms,
[1:00:21] let's not try to prematurely stop him,
[1:00:24] right? Let's not let's not try to to,
[1:00:26] you know, uh, accuse God and blame God
[1:00:29] and all of a sudden, you know, have
[1:00:31] these ill feelings against God because
[1:00:33] all it's going to do is just set you
[1:00:35] back, right? All it's going to do is
[1:00:37] cause you to suffer even more. No, let's
[1:00:40] stand as God's children. And the thing
[1:00:43] that I love about it is that when God
[1:00:46] put the test on Job, what God was saying
[1:00:49] is, "I have confidence in you."
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; That's the best thing that you could
[1:00:53] ever hear. I mean, we live in a world
[1:00:55] where people are starving for for
[1:00:57] confidence. I mean, they're going
[1:00:59] everywhere they can to help build
[1:01:01] themselves up mentally and help to
[1:01:03] encourage themselves. But when you hear
[1:01:05] God's got confidence in you, right?
[1:01:08] Nothing's happened. No trial has
[1:01:10] started. The devil hasn't done nothing
[1:01:12] to you. No sickness has touched you.
[1:01:15] Right? Your bank account is good. I
[1:01:17] mean, nothing has come to you. But God's
[1:01:20] got confidence before even all that
[1:01:22] begins that nah, he's going to make it
[1:01:24] out of this.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Right? That's what we want, right? Those
[1:01:28] are the moments where I begin to love
[1:01:29] God more because it's like, what? You
[1:01:31] got confidence in me,
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; right? This all I'm going through, you
[1:01:36] know, mental people go through mental
[1:01:38] health issues and sickness and God's got
[1:01:41] you on the deathbed and it's like, no, I
[1:01:44] got confidence in that individual,
[1:01:47] right? Oh, it it ought to make us love
[1:01:49] God more, right? It ought to make us to
[1:01:52] trust him more, right? It ought to make
[1:01:54] us to have joy while we're going through
[1:01:56] what we're going through, right? I'm
[1:01:58] telling you, it just changes the mindset
[1:02:00] of a believer when we realize God's
[1:02:03] revelation of us, right? And so, um, and
[1:02:08] I'll go ahead and read Acts. I'll read
[1:02:10] Acts 19 just to get a little bit more.
[1:02:13] This is be the last scripture reader
[1:02:15] scripture reading. So, Acts 19, uh, I
[1:02:18] think it's, um,
[1:02:21] Acts 2 verse 19. Uh, wait, hold on one
[1:02:24] second. No, it's, uh,
[1:02:27] um,
[1:02:32] um, no, this is actually the wrong
[1:02:34] verse, but just to paraphrase, uh, Paul
[1:02:37] was just paraphrasing about what had
[1:02:39] happened with this individual, and what
[1:02:41] I wanted to show was just the
[1:02:42] compounding effect of God. Now, this
[1:02:44] individual said a statement that was
[1:02:46] less than a minute but ended up paying
[1:02:49] 40 years for that statement that he
[1:02:52] said, right? Can you imagine all the
[1:02:54] children of Israel that was ready to go?
[1:02:56] Could you imagine you being the person
[1:02:58] there and you're like, "Hold on a
[1:02:59] second. We about to, you know,
[1:03:01] deliverance is coming." And then some
[1:03:03] knucklehead comes out and tells a
[1:03:06] deliverer who you think you are trying
[1:03:09] to deliver us.
[1:03:11] If I was there, I'd be shut up. God, you
[1:03:14] ain't hear that. Just All right.
[1:03:18] Cause them to suffer 40 more years of
[1:03:21] slavery. Right, man? If you was if you
[1:03:23] was 20 years old, like, man, I'm about
[1:03:25] to go to the promised land in my youth.
[1:03:27] Now, you've got to wait till you're 40,
[1:03:29] right? I'd be upset.
[1:03:32] But it just goes to show the compounding
[1:03:35] effect of God. that little statement,
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; that little statement that he made, God
[1:03:40] paid him back a lot more than what he
[1:03:43] thought it was. Right? So, I want to
[1:03:46] flip it back. If God cares about those
[1:03:48] little things when we give little good
[1:03:51] little things to God, he's got to pay us
[1:03:53] back more, too. Right? It's his nature.
[1:03:56] God wants to bless you more than you
[1:03:58] want to be blessed. And these little
[1:04:00] trials, and I like it because they are
[1:04:02] just little trials,
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; right? These are just little little
[1:04:06] trials. We can't magnify these things.
[1:04:08] Uh to say there's something that they're
[1:04:10] not, right? That we would be telling a
[1:04:13] lie and we can't lie, right? So to pay
[1:04:17] back a little with a lot, the Bible uh
[1:04:20] God gives us this principle in this law
[1:04:23] how when you pay your tithes, God only
[1:04:26] asks for 10%.
[1:04:28] Right? That means if you had, you know,
[1:04:30] a hundred gold bricks, right? God just
[1:04:35] wants 10 back. God just wants you to pay
[1:04:37] 10 just a little bit, right? And he's
[1:04:40] not just going to keep it because the
[1:04:42] Bible says that, you know, when you do
[1:04:44] this thing, then I'm going to open up
[1:04:47] the windows of heaven. It don't take
[1:04:49] much to get a reaction out of God,
[1:04:52] right? And so, we have to embed this
[1:04:54] inside of us in that, you know, you
[1:04:56] might think that you're just, oh, I'm
[1:04:58] just coming to church just singing a
[1:05:00] little song. No, that little song is a
[1:05:02] lot to God, right? When you're going
[1:05:04] through your situation and you're sick
[1:05:06] and you're on your bed and you're tired
[1:05:08] and you're frustrated and your health is
[1:05:09] gone and you're and you say, "Man, all I
[1:05:12] got is a little bit of praise to God."
[1:05:13] That little bit means a lot to God,
[1:05:16] right? When you're stressed going
[1:05:18] through and you your finances, I mean,
[1:05:20] sometimes people struggle to I' I've
[1:05:23] been in situations where you struggle to
[1:05:25] find food to eat. Ramen noodles for five
[1:05:28] days in a row is not fun, right?
[1:05:31] Especially in this day and age when you
[1:05:34] have so many variety of foods and stuff
[1:05:36] and you on ramen noodles for the past
[1:05:38] month, it don't it's not it don't you
[1:05:40] don't feel happy, right? But when you
[1:05:42] can just say, you know what, you just
[1:05:44] say, you know, I'm I'm just going to
[1:05:45] bless God. All I got is, you know, bless
[1:05:47] the Lord. That little bless the Lord
[1:05:49] means a lot to God.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; When he hears you confess that, it means
[1:05:53] a lot to him,
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; right? And he wants to open up the
[1:05:57] heavens to bless you. So in closing, we
[1:06:00] want to remember that it's fruits. It's
[1:06:03] the fruits first and then it's the
[1:06:06] blessing. Meaning that God doesn't want
[1:06:09] to God can bless you. I'll I'll put it
[1:06:13] this way because he loves you. God can
[1:06:15] bless you with no fruits. But then what
[1:06:18] happens is when you get the blessing is
[1:06:21] squandered, right? So, you know, when
[1:06:24] you haven't gone through financial
[1:06:26] discipline where you've where you know,
[1:06:28] you've gone through a season where
[1:06:29] you're stretching your penny, that's
[1:06:31] some good skills to learn, right? It's
[1:06:34] some good skills when you can turn $5
[1:06:36] into two weeks of meals. I mean, that's
[1:06:39] that's I mean, hey, you get very, very
[1:06:42] creative, right? And it's good to have
[1:06:45] those skills because now when God gives
[1:06:47] you a million, now he can trust you that
[1:06:49] when he comes back, it'll be two
[1:06:51] million. It won't be less. It won't be
[1:06:53] debt. You know, God don't want to give
[1:06:55] you a million dollars and then come back
[1:06:57] and it's like you don't even have a dime
[1:06:58] to give back to him, right? No, no, no,
[1:07:01] no. Enjoy these moments, right? Enjoy
[1:07:04] these tough moments, right? They're
[1:07:05] teaching you things. They're helping you
[1:07:07] to understand, you know, because they're
[1:07:10] helping you to understand because one,
[1:07:12] you're God's child
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; and God don't got broke children,
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; right? God is a king, right? And and and
[1:07:19] I and I like it because it shows in the
[1:07:21] natural. If you had a son, you don't
[1:07:24] want your son just out here just living
[1:07:25] on any old way. No, no, no. You want him
[1:07:28] to have the best. And God is the same
[1:07:31] exact way with you. He wants you to have
[1:07:33] the best. He wants you to have the best
[1:07:35] health, right? He wants you to have the
[1:07:38] best finances, right? He wants you to
[1:07:40] have the best blessings. He wants you to
[1:07:42] be able to show up on work and everyone
[1:07:45] says, "Man, I want to be like this guy."
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; All right. I remember one time when I
[1:07:49] was uh I had a buddy at my job. I wasn't
[1:07:53] serving God how I was, but I was all I
[1:07:55] was I was always uh confessing that and
[1:07:58] I remember he was a and he was a
[1:07:59] agnostic or something and he had made a
[1:08:02] comment to me. He was like, you know, if
[1:08:03] I had a son, I would want him to be just
[1:08:05] like you, right? And so that's the kind
[1:08:08] of thing that, you know, sons of gods
[1:08:10] can do. They can make unbelievers
[1:08:13] believe,
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; right? And that's the kind of stuff that
[1:08:16] God wants to show. Oh, that's why we
[1:08:18] have these fruits because it makes
[1:08:20] things possible not just for you, but
[1:08:22] for everybody that you come in contact
[1:08:25] with. So remember that fruits ain't just
[1:08:28] for you, but it's for other people to
[1:08:30] enjoy as well.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? So God has to fulfill his
[1:08:35] word. He said that he would produce good
[1:08:38] fruit and it has to be good fruit.
[1:08:41] Right? And so you might have been
[1:08:43] dealing with things for a very very long
[1:08:45] time. That's why you need longsuffering,
[1:08:48] right? God has a reason for everything
[1:08:50] he's doing. And we have to remember that
[1:08:52] the Bible says he's Lord of the harvest.
[1:08:55] He knows exactly when the fruits are
[1:08:57] going to be ready. He knows exactly when
[1:08:58] the season's going to the season starts
[1:09:01] and when it ends. All he wants us to do
[1:09:03] is just lean on him and trust in him.
[1:09:05] God, richly bless you, church.
[1:09:08] [applause]
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; And uh close it out in a word of prayer.
[1:09:15] Uh Lord Jesus Christ, we thank you oh
[1:09:18] Lord for your word, Lord. Lord, we know
[1:09:21] that it's only by revelation that we
[1:09:24] know who you are and we know who we are
[1:09:26] in you, Lord Jesus. And it's only by
[1:09:29] your grace and mercy, oh Lord God. Lord,
[1:09:31] we could read this Bible a million
[1:09:33] times. Lord, we could pray for hours
[1:09:36] upon hours, oh Lord God. Lord, we could
[1:09:39] try to do the best that we could do with
[1:09:41] sincerity, oh Lord God. But Lord,
[1:09:44] because of your grace for us, oh Lord
[1:09:46] God, you decide to unlock these things
[1:09:48] to us. Oh Lord God, you decide to show
[1:09:51] us our identity in you. Oh Lord God,
[1:09:54] that we are more than overcomers. Oh
[1:09:57] Lord God, that we were it's not us
[1:10:00] trying to get a blessing. Oh Lord God,
[1:10:02] we were always blessed. Oh Lord God,
[1:10:04] Lord, when you were in heaven, oh Lord,
[1:10:06] before the earth was created, oh Lord,
[1:10:08] before the concept of debt and money and
[1:10:11] all these things, Lord, you owned
[1:10:13] everything, oh Lord God. And Lord, we
[1:10:16] were in you, oh Lord Jesus Christ. We're
[1:10:19] not just trying to get a blessing. It's
[1:10:21] always belonged to us, oh Lord God. Help
[1:10:23] us, oh Lord, in this time period of
[1:10:25] space, oh Lord God, because we failed
[1:10:28] you as man, oh Lord God. But in this
[1:10:30] period of time, oh Lord God, we have the
[1:10:32] greatest thing we can do. We can choose
[1:10:35] to love you, oh Lord God. We can choose
[1:10:37] to show good fruit, oh Lord God, out of
[1:10:40] our own free will and thinking, oh Lord
[1:10:42] Jesus Christ, we can choose to go
[1:10:44] through the storm and still praise you,
[1:10:46] oh Lord God. When things are going
[1:10:48] wrong, we can still choose to have joy
[1:10:51] and worship you, oh Lord God. Perplexed
[1:10:53] on all side as uh as uh your prophet
[1:10:56] Paul talked about ups and downs,
[1:10:58] perplexions, famine, he said there is
[1:11:01] nothing that can separate us from your
[1:11:04] love, oh Lord Jesus Christ. So we thank
[1:11:06] you for the revelation. Be with the
[1:11:08] people, oh Lord God. Touch them and
[1:11:10] bless them. Help them in any way, oh
[1:11:12] Lord. All the needs that they have, oh
[1:11:14] Lord God. All the desires that they
[1:11:16] have, oh Lord God, all the all the
[1:11:18] prayers that they've been praying for
[1:11:20] years, oh Lord God. Lord, let them know
[1:11:22] that you still hear them. Oh Lord God,
[1:11:24] just a little bit of faith is all you're
[1:11:26] looking for us, oh Lord God. Grant it,
[1:11:28] oh Lord. Grant every request, oh Lord,
[1:11:30] in the precious name of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:32] Amen.
[1:11:40] Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Uh let's give the Lord another hand clap
[1:11:46] of praise. [applause]
[1:11:51] Amen.
[1:11:53] How many are grateful for the word
[1:11:54] tonight?
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I uh I enjoy when um when
[1:11:59] brother Quinton uh preaches and I and
[1:12:01] I've told told him this before that I
[1:12:04] like how he he he lays out the word. He
[1:12:07] teaches in such a way that makes it easy
[1:12:09] for everyone to understand. And in his
[1:12:12] teachings are a lot of really good
[1:12:14] nuggets. Uh I liked when he uh when he
[1:12:18] said your diet is a reflection of your
[1:12:21] maturity. Amen. What you're eating shows
[1:12:23] us where you are. Amen. On the natural
[1:12:27] and that natural types the spiritual
[1:12:29] regardless as the prophet has told us.
[1:12:31] So when you look at what you're eating
[1:12:34] spiritually, it also reflects where you
[1:12:36] are in your spiritual maturity. Amen.
[1:12:39] And he says we shouldn't be eating empty
[1:12:41] calories. Amen. And we're thankful.
[1:12:44] We're thankful that God has allowed us
[1:12:46] to be um recipients of this revealed
[1:12:50] word because this this isn't skim milk.
[1:12:52] This isn't this isn't baby food, right?
[1:12:54] This is eagle food, right? And that's
[1:12:56] why the word says uh where where the
[1:12:58] carcass is, the eagles will gather,
[1:13:00] right? Because that's where that's where
[1:13:02] spiritually mature Christians are
[1:13:04] supposed to gather. Amen. And when we
[1:13:06] get born again, we don't we don't we
[1:13:08] don't get born again uh and become uh uh
[1:13:11] adults immediately, right? We go through
[1:13:13] a process of growing, right? But but but
[1:13:15] the word is supposed to keep uh allowing
[1:13:18] us to to feed on it so that we get to a
[1:13:20] point where we're now spiritually
[1:13:21] mature. If we remain at a place where
[1:13:24] we're still just taking skim milk and
[1:13:26] just only enjoying skimm milk, then
[1:13:28] something's wrong somewhere, right? Once
[1:13:30] you're born again, once we see a a
[1:13:32] child, when a child is born again, they
[1:13:34] they they may have milk, right? They may
[1:13:36] have uh pouches, then they get
[1:13:38] introduced to solids, right? And then
[1:13:40] they start eating certain things and as
[1:13:41] they grow, they start eating solid food,
[1:13:44] right? Real food, mature people food,
[1:13:47] right? Same thing for Christians. Once
[1:13:49] we get born again, we cannot still just
[1:13:51] rejoice on the things that people out in
[1:13:53] the world are rejoicing over, right?
[1:13:55] Those empty calories, they go to church,
[1:13:57] enjoy uh empty calories, leave the place
[1:14:00] happy, but go and live the same old
[1:14:02] life.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; We want to eat something that allows us
[1:14:05] to to to to really live a a a sanctified
[1:14:08] life, right? Sanctified, Holy Ghost fil
[1:14:11] life.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; So, we thank the Lord for for the
[1:14:13] message tonight. It's all about it's all
[1:14:14] about maturity is what he was talking
[1:14:16] about. Those fruits don't come unless
[1:14:18] that tree has matured, right? So, it's
[1:14:20] about maturity. We thank the Lord for
[1:14:22] tonight. Um, sister, if you could give
[1:14:24] me the uh the announcements.

[1:19:22] All right.
[1:19:24] Um let's let's bow our heads.
[1:19:29] Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you this
[1:19:31] evening, Lord God, for uh your precious
[1:19:34] word that you blessed us with tonight.
[1:19:36] We thank you, Father God, for bringing
[1:19:38] us into your house this evening, Father
[1:19:39] God. Um just Lord, so the inner man can
[1:19:43] be strengthened, Lord, through the
[1:19:45] preaching of the word, Lord God, through
[1:19:46] the teaching, Father God, on fruits and
[1:19:48] and um uh maturity as Christians, Lord.
[1:19:53] Father, I pray Lord God that Lord as we
[1:19:55] continue to partake of uh this living
[1:19:58] word, Father God, this revealed word for
[1:20:00] our day, Lord God, that Father, we would
[1:20:03] uh see growth in our lives, Lord God,
[1:20:05] that we would grow, Father God, from
[1:20:06] strength to strength, heavenly Father.
[1:20:08] And that Lord, we would be uh mature
[1:20:10] Christians that bear good fruit, Lord
[1:20:13] God. We don't want to be Christians that
[1:20:15] bear bad fruit, Father, or Christians
[1:20:17] that feed on on on on only skim milk or
[1:20:20] Christians that feed on empty calories,
[1:20:21] Father. Lord, we want to come into your
[1:20:24] house, Lord God, to hear from you,
[1:20:25] Father, and hear the the deep things of
[1:20:27] God and understand, Lord God, where we
[1:20:30] are spiritually. Read our Bibles at
[1:20:31] home, Lord God, so we can understand our
[1:20:34] condition, Father God. Listen to to
[1:20:36] tapes, Lord God, and and allow, Lord
[1:20:38] God, you to just mold the inner man.
[1:20:40] Allow us to grow, heavenly father. We
[1:20:42] thank you, dear God, for opening our
[1:20:44] eyes, Lord God, in this hour, Lord, that
[1:20:46] we can see things, Father, that we
[1:20:48] wouldn't otherwise see. Thank you,
[1:20:50] Father God, for blessing and anointing
[1:20:51] our ears that we can hear things, Lord
[1:20:53] God. Father, things that that only
[1:20:56] eagles feed on, Father. We are thankful

[1:21:10] on her behalf, oh God. We we we know,
[1:21:12] heavenly father, that, Lord, where where
[1:21:15] where man ends is where you begin,
[1:21:17] Father. So if the doctors have said Lord
[1:21:19] God that they they they they cannot do
[1:21:21] anything further for her Lord God we we
[1:21:23] don't have any other option but to reach
[1:21:25] out to the only one that can do
[1:21:26] something about that situation father.
[1:21:28] So Lord we commit her into your hands
[1:21:31] father God we pray Lord whatever Lord
[1:21:33] issue Lord God is going on with her body
[1:21:35] Lord. May you may may you Jehovah Rafa

[1:21:42] almighty God. And Lord may she be made
[1:21:44] whole in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:21:45] Christ. you know her condition, Father
[1:21:47] God. And Lord, we know you're able to do
[1:21:49] anything, Father God. There's nothing
[1:21:52] that is too hard for you, oh God. And
[1:21:53] Lord, you gave us uh promises in your
[1:21:56] word, Lord God, regarding healing,
[1:21:57] Father. And none of them had an age
[1:21:59] limit, Lord. So, Father, as as we
[1:22:01] present her into your hands. We're not
[1:22:03] putting any restrictions, Lord. We're
[1:22:04] not we're not disbelieving because of
[1:22:06] age, but Father, we'll do our very best
[1:22:08] to believe and stand in faith with our
[1:22:10] brother, Lord. So, we commit her into
[1:22:12] your hands, Father God. And we pray,
[1:22:13] Lord God, that you'd have your precious
[1:22:15] way. Bless the saints, Father God, and
[1:22:17] be with us, Lord, as um as we go back to
[1:22:19] our homes. Remember, Lord, the saints
[1:22:21] that have traveled to Australia, Father,
[1:22:23] we pray that you continue to be with
[1:22:25] them, protect them, bless them while
[1:22:26] they're there, and may they be a
[1:22:27] blessing right where they are. And may
