[2:47] standing
[2:48] jeremiah might be a lot of read
[2:52] job 27 was thought at the first verse
[3:02] amen
[3:08] and it reads on this wise moreover job
[3:12] continued
[3:14] his parable and said as god
[3:17] liveth who hath taken away
[3:20] my judgment and the almighty who hath
[3:24] vexed my soul
[3:27] all the while my breath is in me and the
[3:30] spirit of god
[3:32] is in my nostrils my lips
[3:35] shall not speak wickedness nor my tongue
[3:39] utter deceit god forbid
[3:43] that i would justify you
[3:47] till i die i will not remove
[3:51] i will not remove my integrity from me
[3:56] my righteousness i hold fast
[3:59] and will not let go my heart
[4:03] shall not reproach me as long as i live
[4:07] let my enemy be as the wicked and he
[4:10] that riseth up against me as the
[4:13] unrighteous
[4:15] for what is the hope of the hypocrite
[4:18] though he hath gained when god
[4:22] taketh away his soul will god hear his
[4:25] cry when trouble cometh upon him
[4:28] will he delight himself in the almighty
[4:32] will he always call upon god
[4:36] i will teach you by the hand of god
[4:39] that which is with the almighty
[4:43] will i not conceal behold
[4:47] all ye yourselves have seen it
[4:50] why then are ye thus all together vain
[4:56] this is the portion of the of the of a
[4:59] wicked man
[5:01] with god and inherit an inheritance
[5:04] of oppressor uh
[5:08] which they shall receive of the almighty
[5:12] if the children be multiplied it is for
[5:15] the sword and his offspring shall not be
[5:19] satisfied with bread
[5:21] amen you may be seated i'd like to take
[5:25] for a title if we go back there to the
[5:29] sixth verse it says my righteousness
[5:34] i hold fast and will not
[5:37] let go so the title of my message this
[5:40] evening is hold fast
[5:43] and don't let go amen
[5:46] hold fast and don't let go
[5:50] i'd like to take a now a little reading
[5:52] if you don't mind just to set
[5:54] a platform here um out of jeremiah
[5:59] uh beginning at the of the fifth chapter
[6:04] um
[6:15] i think i'll start reading here
[6:20] gonna start at the first verse i'm gonna
[6:22] start at the first verse i'm gonna read
[6:23] out of jeremiah the fifth chapter
[6:26] i'll start at the first verse amen uh
[6:29] and it reads it says run ye to and fro
[6:32] through the streets of jerusalem and see
[6:35] now
[6:36] and know and seek
[6:39] in the broad places thereof
[6:42] if ye can find a man if there be any
[6:45] that
[6:46] executeth judgment that seeketh the
[6:49] truth
[6:50] and i will pardon it and though
[6:54] they uh they say the lord liveth surely
[6:57] they swear falsely
[7:00] oh lord are not thine eyes upon the
[7:03] truth
[7:04] thou has stricken them but they have
[7:07] not grieved thou has consumed them
[7:11] but they have refused to receive
[7:14] correction
[7:15] they have made their faces harder than
[7:18] iraq
[7:19] they have refused to return
[7:22] therefore i said surely a poor
[7:26] surely these are poor they are foolish
[7:31] for they know not the way of the lord
[7:33] nor the judgment
[7:35] of their god i will
[7:38] i will get me unto the great men
[7:42] and will speak unto them for they have
[7:45] known the way of the lord
[7:47] and the judgment of their god but these
[7:49] have altogether broken
[7:51] the broken the yoke and burst the bonds
[7:55] wherefore a lion out of the forest shall
[7:58] slay them and a wolf
[8:00] of the evening shall spoil them a
[8:02] leopard shall watch over their cities
[8:05] every one that goeth out vents
[8:08] shall be torn in pieces because
[8:12] their transgressions are many and their
[8:15] backslidings
[8:16] are increased how shall i pardon
[8:20] thee for this ye children have forsaken
[8:23] me
[8:24] and sworn by them that are no good
[8:27] that i sworn by them that
[8:30] are no gods when i have fed them
[8:35] to uh to the full they then committed
[8:38] adultery
[8:39] and assembled themselves by troops in
[8:43] harlot's houses
[8:46] they they they were as fed horses
[8:49] in the morning everyone
[8:53] after his neighbor's wife
[9:01] shall i not visit for these things
[9:04] saith the lord and shall not my soul be
[9:07] avenged
[9:08] on such a nation as this
[9:12] go ye upon her walls and destroy
[9:16] but make not fall in take away her
[9:18] battlements
[9:19] and they are not the lords
[9:23] for the house of the lord and the house
[9:26] of judah
[9:27] have dealt very treacherously against me
[9:29] saith the lord
[9:31] they have uh belied the lord and said
[9:34] unto and and said
[9:37] it is not he neither shall evil
[9:41] come upon us neither shall these swords
[9:44] nor famine and the prophets shall come
[9:50] and the prophet shall become when and
[9:52] the word
[9:53] is not in them thus shall it be done
[9:56] unto them
[9:58] wherefore thus saith the lord god of
[10:00] hosts
[10:01] because ye because
[10:04] ye speak this word behold i will make
[10:08] my words in thy mouth fire and the
[10:11] people would
[10:12] and it shall devour them lord i bring a
[10:16] nation
[10:16] upon you far from far o house of israel
[10:21] the lord is a mighty nation
[10:25] it is an ancient nation
[10:28] a nation whose language thou knowest
[10:32] not neither understandeth what they say
[10:36] their quiver is as an open uh
[10:39] subculture and uh and are all
[10:42] mighty men and they shall eat
[10:46] up thine harvest and thy bread
[10:49] which thy sons and thy daughters should
[10:52] eat
[10:52] they shall eat up the flocks of thy
[10:54] herds and they shall eat of the vines of
[10:57] the fig tree
[10:58] and they shall impart impoverish thy
[11:01] fenced cities wherein thou trusted it
[11:05] with the sword nevertheless in those
[11:08] days saith the lord i will make
[11:10] full end with you and it shall come to
[11:13] pass
[11:14] when ye shall say wherefore doeth the
[11:16] lord god
[11:17] all these things unto us
[11:21] then shalt thou answer them
[11:28] like as ye have forsaken me and served
[11:32] gods in your land
[11:35] so shall ye serve strangers in the land
[11:38] of in the land that is not
[11:41] yours declare this
[11:45] in the house of jacob and publish it
[11:48] in judah saying
[11:53] here now old foolish people
[11:56] and without understanding which
[11:59] have eyes and see not which have
[12:03] ears which which have eyes
[12:06] and see not which have ears and hear
[12:10] not fear ye
[12:13] not me saith the lord
[12:16] will ye not tremble at my presence
[12:19] which have placed the uh the
[12:23] for a bounce of the sea
[12:27] by a perpetual decree that
[12:30] it cannot pass it and though the waves
[12:33] therefore
[12:34] toss themselves yet they cannot prevail
[12:39] though the raw yet it cannot pass
[12:43] over it amen so we see here that the
[12:45] children of israel
[12:47] amen in this little passage of scripture
[12:49] that i just read to you
[12:50] amen uh kind of lost their way
[12:55] amen they begin to uh serve other gods
[12:59] and they begin to uh can what do you
[13:01] give me a
[13:02] napkin it is mighty hot in here today
[13:04] i'm feeling them i'm
[13:06] i thought i was gonna get me a little
[13:08] hand tile
[13:09] i appreciate it hey man we see that uh
[13:15] they they they they they had they had
[13:18] kind of fell
[13:19] off amen if you read there oh right
[13:22] before that jeremiah and the
[13:24] i believe it's the eighth chapter say uh
[13:26] they were a perpetual
[13:28] backsliding amen
[13:32] we we want to take a look at some of
[13:34] these things that
[13:35] that word there
[13:42] thank you my brother that word they're
[13:46] perpetual
[13:48] amen perpetual perpetual it means to be
[13:52] never ending
[13:53] never changing occurring repeatedly
[13:58] so frequent as it seems endless
[14:03] amen word perpetual and we read the word
[14:06] there in jeremiah and it talks about how
[14:09] uh god uh set a decree
[14:13] that the sea could only go so far
[14:17] uh i want you to recognize that the the
[14:20] the
[14:20] the sea when god amen he uh
[14:24] when he when he created the earth there
[14:26] in genesis
[14:28] amen he he set a boundary amen for the
[14:31] sea
[14:32] he said well you he divided the land and
[14:35] said well you can only come this far
[14:38] amen that was for amen for the
[14:41] protection and he set the thing up so
[14:43] beautifully and everything was set in
[14:44] such an
[14:45] order amen that everything held its
[14:48] place
[14:50] amen everything had a place and as long
[14:53] as everything was in its place
[14:56] amen there was peace in the valley
[15:00] there was peace on the mountain as long
[15:03] as everything was set
[15:05] in order because see when he created
[15:07] everything
[15:08] he put the sun and the moon and the
[15:10] earth he put him so many
[15:12] miles apart amen he know he measured the
[15:15] gravitational
[15:16] force and he said well i got this amount
[15:19] of water see god is a great builder
[15:22] amen and he's a great designer and he
[15:24] knows amen jazz how to place
[15:26] things where they need to be you see
[15:29] that's why
[15:30] even in this church he knows just how to
[15:33] place
[15:33] things right where they need to be amen
[15:37] he knows a man how to place
[15:39] people right where they need to be amen
[15:42] in order to have peace amen in the
[15:45] in the assembly amen so when everything
[15:49] sometimes
[15:50] okay in our lives he knows how to place
[15:52] things in our lives
[15:55] but see every now and then sometimes
[15:57] something happens we get away from god
[15:59] on last week i was talking about we move
[16:01] away from those
[16:02] flowing streams you see we get to
[16:05] we get to move out of place and when we
[16:09] begin to move over
[16:10] into a certain territory as they did
[16:13] here in israel
[16:14] amen he said now how can i allow these
[16:17] things to happen
[16:18] amen without coming and executing
[16:20] judgment
[16:22] because see at this time there was a law
[16:25] amen and a law is no longer without
[16:28] judgment
[16:30] amen there must be a penalty amen for
[16:33] for for for violating the law
[16:37] or it's no law at all amen so
[16:40] that there had to be judgment but god oh
[16:44] god
[16:44] who is so merciful he said and bound
[16:48] he said you can only come this far
[16:52] so we see we see uh uh uh in this
[16:55] scripture here
[16:56] amen the word bound it reads
[17:00] he says uh fear ye not me
[17:03] sayeth the lord will ye not tremble at
[17:06] my presence
[17:08] amen which have placed the sand
[17:13] for a bound of the sea
[17:16] by a perpetual decree
[17:20] now this word bound is the root word for
[17:23] boundary
[17:25] okay so i'm saying that that that you
[17:27] can only go
[17:28] so far and it says that he did this by a
[17:32] perpetual
[17:34] and we said the word perpetual means
[17:36] never ending
[17:38] by a continuous and decree
[17:42] a perpetual decree amen that word decree
[17:46] means a divine ordinance
[17:48] amen a decree amen it means here
[17:52] amen in order usually having the force
[17:55] of law
[17:56] or a judicial decree amen a religious
[18:00] ordinance amen or foreordained
[18:03] will of god a perpetual
[18:06] decree amen it was it was established
[18:10] amen
[18:11] amen by the almighty god amen the set of
[18:15] bounds that
[18:16] that that that the sea could only go so
[18:18] far
[18:20] amen in this sea we look at we we
[18:23] we we we we look at noah i don't want to
[18:26] get ahead of myself we'll get there
[18:29] amen that it represents a judgment
[18:32] amen water water destroys
[18:36] let's build it this way water in a
[18:39] chaotic condition
[18:41] destroys amen
[18:45] many of us are homeowners we have to
[18:47] have flood insurance
[18:49] because we need water to function but it
[18:52] has to be controlled that water is good
[18:56] as long as it remain in them pipes
[18:59] it began to leak out of the pipes and we
[19:01] got a problem
[19:03] it begins to do damage to all the other
[19:06] things
[19:07] amen so see even in an hour in our
[19:10] natural construction we have to set
[19:12] bounds amen for the water
[19:16] we have to say okay you can only come
[19:18] this far
[19:19] amen and you can uh you can stay here in
[19:22] the
[19:23] in the tub amen and if i if i turn on my
[19:26] speaking and
[19:27] the water flows into the sea that's
[19:30] where you stay
[19:31] hey man i have a roof on so when the
[19:34] when when the rain and things
[19:35] come amen my roof slopes and the water
[19:39] runs because i want the water to go to a
[19:41] certain place
[19:43] i don't want water in my house i don't
[19:46] want it all over my good drywall and my
[19:48] furniture and things because it's going
[19:50] to cause a problem
[19:52] we can't live like that amen the person
[19:55] that they
[19:56] you know they live outside the first
[19:57] thing they want
[19:59] amen one of the highest the needs of man
[20:02] they managed to get out of the weather
[20:05] it starts to rain you begin to see
[20:07] people put something over they want to
[20:09] get they want to get to somewhere
[20:11] safety they want to get up under a
[20:14] shelter
[20:15] they want to get up under something to
[20:17] keep the water
[20:19] off of them amen because water
[20:22] uncontrolled
[20:25] is destructive uncontrolled
[20:29] now water is powerful
[20:32] amen water water water water
[20:36] it it it'll wipe out cities
[20:39] hey man we see many times in the bible
[20:42] hole
[20:42] uh uh caparing them under the sea
[20:46] they been destroyed by water
[20:49] amen so we see that god
[20:52] in his in his in his in in all of his
[20:56] great wonder
[20:57] all this great wonder he set about
[21:02] amen allah that you can only come this
[21:04] far
[21:06] amen maybe uh uh uh uh
[21:09] uh the winds and the storms
[21:12] in your life you may be going through
[21:16] some difficult problems you may be going
[21:19] through some difficult problems
[21:21] we call those things the storms of life
[21:24] but i'm here to tell you this evening
[21:26] that they can only go so far
[21:29] amen there's been a perpetual decree set
[21:32] by god
[21:33] that no matter how hard it gets no
[21:35] matter how difficult the situation is
[21:37] amen the water can only come so far
[21:41] amen the sea would destroy the earth if
[21:45] it was not for the boundaries set by god
[21:48] against the forces of the power of the
[21:50] sea
[21:51] so when you come into this world god
[21:54] also set at the boundary and decree
[21:56] of your life amen and say that the water
[22:00] can only come so far amen you
[22:03] can only go so far amen we see here that
[22:07] the children of
[22:08] israel they they begin to to do all
[22:10] kinds of things they began to
[22:12] serve other gods and they began to do
[22:15] this but they could only go
[22:17] so far why because there was a boundary
[22:20] set
[22:20] amen before the foundation of the world
[22:23] amen that says that the seed will not
[22:26] destroy you it can only go so far
[22:29] amen
[22:33] my my mind it can only go so far
[22:38] your life is protected amen amen by a
[22:41] decree
[22:42] a man of god and we see amen
[22:47] the prophet was talking about here amen
[22:50] we look at noah
[22:53] amen noah amen the clouds
[22:57] he he he had a a vision amen that god
[23:01] told him that
[23:02] the the sins amen had reached up to the
[23:05] nostrils of god
[23:07] amen and and and there had to be
[23:09] something done
[23:11] amen he was going to he was going to
[23:14] uh take care of the problem amen he was
[23:18] he he was going to uh uh uh sitting the
[23:22] ring
[23:23] amen understanding that this is a
[23:25] destructive force
[23:27] and uh and he said hearing the message
[23:29] on the wings of a snow white dove amen
[23:32] amen uh paragraph 86
[23:35] he said and the clouds began to form
[23:39] amen and the rains began to fall
[23:43] and the sewers began to fill up
[23:46] the fountains of the deep broke open
[23:50] the springs all belched up their water
[23:54] finally the people got into their houses
[23:57] and they climbed up the old ark
[24:01] set there in the same place
[24:04] amen we know the story noah went around
[24:08] preaching
[24:09] amen and he compelled people to get into
[24:11] the ark of safety
[24:13] amen because he knew amen that that the
[24:16] destructive water
[24:18] was coming he knew that there
[24:21] that that that that that that judgment
[24:24] was on the way
[24:25] right amen so he went amen into the
[24:28] hedges in the highways
[24:30] and the people mocked him amen they
[24:33] they they they they didn't they they at
[24:36] they unbelief
[24:38] they didn't believe this man
[24:41] who are you to tell us what god is going
[24:45] to do
[24:47] amen no doubt you know they never even
[24:49] heard the word rain what be this rain
[24:51] you're talking about
[24:53] what is i've never never seen rain never
[24:56] even heard the word before
[24:58] and the prophet described how this was
[25:00] such an intellectual age that they began
[25:02] to shoot things into the air and say
[25:03] look
[25:04] noah there's no water up there
[25:07] amen you have seemed to have lost your
[25:11] mind a little bit
[25:13] amen excuse me you seem to uh
[25:16] uh uh uh uh fell off the deep end
[25:19] amen cause uh uh the church that i came
[25:22] up in they don't preach this
[25:24] i've never heard this kind of preaching
[25:26] before i've never heard such a thing
[25:28] it's going to rain amen i've been going
[25:31] to church all my life and i've never
[25:33] heard anything like this
[25:35] but see there was a judgment coming
[25:38] and you see god has set a bounds and
[25:41] said that
[25:42] the water can only come so far but he
[25:45] was going to
[25:45] allow to move amen the the the hands of
[25:50] the stabilizing hand of god amen to
[25:53] allow
[25:54] things chaos to set in for a little
[25:56] while
[25:57] amen but he was sending a man a a rescue
[26:01] boat
[26:03] amen he was sending an ark amen for
[26:06] those
[26:06] amen who would believe amen to be saved
[26:11] amen but the people because they had
[26:13] never heard of such a thing
[26:16] they they they didn't understand it they
[26:19] didn't understand it so they didn't take
[26:21] heed to the warning
[26:22] amen they they like much like the
[26:25] children of israel here
[26:26] in jeremiah they they they they heard
[26:29] the words of the prophets
[26:32] amen but but there were other men
[26:35] amen that came along amen and created
[26:38] snares
[26:40] now let me let me let me slow down a
[26:42] little bit here and let me just kind of
[26:43] walk that a little bit
[26:45] amen uh uh uh
[26:51] they are sn i'm sorry let me keep going
[26:54] because i'm going to get there
[26:55] i'm sorry let me keep going because i'll
[26:57] get there
[26:58] now we see noah uh uh in this
[27:01] uh they broke up the springs climb into
[27:04] the houses
[27:05] and the ark was set there just the same
[27:10] after a while when enough began
[27:13] to get around her
[27:16] she began to rise talking about the yard
[27:20] she began to rise higher and higher
[27:24] the people began they knocked at the
[27:27] door
[27:27] and screamed but did no good
[27:33] noah had opened the door and god
[27:37] closed it god was the only and god is
[27:40] the only one that can open it
[27:43] amen now let me go back if i may and and
[27:46] and
[27:48] uh take a look at something
[27:53] the title amen of this of my message
[27:56] here is
[27:56] uh hold fast
[28:00] and don't let go
[28:03] amen the bible says in first
[28:05] thessalonians
[28:07] the fifth chapter the 21st verse amen it
[28:10] says
[28:10] prove all things amen and hold fast to
[28:14] that which is good
[28:16] amen so the word there uh
[28:20] proof means to recognize
[28:24] something as being genuine
[28:27] after examination
[28:30] amen to prove means to to to to take
[28:34] something
[28:35] and study it and after studying it
[28:38] you are convinced that this is genuine
[28:43] amen this is the real thing this is not
[28:46] a make-believe this is not
[28:48] something this is solid amen this is
[28:51] this this
[28:52] this boat of whole water hey man this
[28:55] boat
[28:55] this boat would take uh uh or stay in
[28:57] the journey
[28:59] amen so he said prove all things
[29:02] and hold fast to that which is good
[29:07] so we we we we we see we have ex
[29:11] listen we have examined
[29:15] over the years this message for many
[29:18] years
[29:20] and i trust that we have come to the
[29:23] place
[29:24] that we can understand and realize that
[29:27] the word of god
[29:28] that this is genuine amen this is
[29:32] something that'll carry you through
[29:34] amen the storms of life this is
[29:37] something that'll carry you through
[29:39] the tribulation the judgment that is
[29:41] coming
[29:42] amen this word hold
[29:46] fast is a term that
[29:49] is a a a it has meanings and different
[29:52] stances but it is
[29:54] mainly a nautical term
[29:57] amen an article turned to greek words
[29:59] slightly varying meanings
[30:02] to check a ship's headway
[30:05] see a ship a ship when it's when it's
[30:09] when it's on the on the sea
[30:11] and the the the winds are blowing amen

[30:24] north south east or west you have to be
[30:27] able to trust the instrumentation of
[30:29] your compass
[30:31] amen so what you have to do is someone
[30:34] has to be
[30:34] looking there constantly at the compass
[30:37] and grabbing the helm
[30:39] of the weird the helm and continue to

[39:52] let me get back here on task
[39:56] after a while enough began and they get
[39:58] around and she began to rise higher and
[40:00] higher
[40:01] the people knocked at the door they
[40:03] screamed
[40:04] but it did no good noah could not open
[40:07] the door
[40:08] because noah did not close the door
[40:12] amen so that is
[40:15] is so as it is today
[40:19] in our ark we have an ark today
[40:23] that ark is christ jesus god opened the
[40:27] door for
[40:28] us on calvary he'll close it
[40:31] just as sure as he opened it
[40:34] and it floated following along here
[40:38] and it floated and on
[40:41] and on maybe a mile deep
[40:45] over the top of the earth and when this
[40:48] earth was trembling
[40:50] now listen here let me let me let me let
[40:52] me go back over there and it floated on
[40:54] and on
[40:55] maybe miles deep over the top of the
[40:58] earth
[41:00] when this earth was tumbling
[41:03] out from the way from
[41:06] its regular orbit see
[41:11] from its regular orbit it had gotten out
[41:14] of place
[41:16] amen
[41:19] and around and around it went
[41:22] chunks and trees above the mountains
[41:27] and so forth pitching for 40 days
[41:31] and 40 nights
[41:35] jehovah the great stabilizer
[41:39] had pulled back
[41:42] the great stabilizer who was holding
[41:44] everything together
[41:46] had pulled back and said okay
[41:49] you want to do it your way i'll have you
[41:52] let you do it your way
[41:54] the great stabilizer had withdrew
[41:57] amen his hand
[42:01] amen and when the winds had begin to
[42:05] cease
[42:07] amen pardon me
[42:17] the winds i begin to cease god's wrath
[42:21] is horrible amen if i may
[42:24] let me go down here amen to uh
[42:29] paragraph 92.
[42:32] now we notice that after noah floating
[42:35] up there
[42:37] no doubt seasick
[42:40] from all of the rowing and the popping
[42:44] and the wrath of god smashed
[42:48] and crushing and screams and so forth
[42:53] then it began to quiet down
[42:57] nothing happened days passed
[43:00] nothing happened perhaps the food supply
[43:05] the animals and so forth was running low
[43:10] nothing happened so he thought wonder
[43:14] i can see i can see out
[43:18] so maybe in your life amen and you're
[43:21] floating on pawn
[43:23] on the sea of life amen
[43:27] maybe you've been sick in your body amen
[43:31] and nothing happened maybe it seems that
[43:34] the cupboard is bare
[43:37] amen and maybe the storms of life have
[43:40] stretched you out to the point that you
[43:42] could just scream
[43:45] amen but you're on the boat
[43:49] amen so hold fast
[43:53] no matter how how how how how difficult
[43:56] the trouble may seem
[43:58] maybe you're like the people here that
[44:00] was on new york
[44:04] amen don't know where the next meal is
[44:07] coming from
[44:09] the bank account may may look low
[44:14] you may may be down to cents in the bank
[44:17] account
[44:18] and you're wondering how am i going to
[44:20] make it through the week
[44:23] i say hold fast and don't let go
[44:29] maybe the doctor has gave you a bad
[44:31] report
[44:33] amen and you're waiting for test results
[44:36] to come in
[44:38] i say hold fast
[44:41] and don't let go we take a look at job
[44:47] jobs was giving this this this testimony
[44:50] here in job 27.
[44:54] job was testifying he had just came
[44:56] through a great trial
[44:59] but before he began to go through this
[45:01] trial there was a conversation between
[45:03] the devil and the lord and
[45:06] and and the double the devil the devil
[45:08] said uh uh uh uh
[45:10] you you you you're protecting him
[45:13] you gotta hedge about him i'll make him
[45:16] curse you but god knew job
[45:21] and he said if you remove the hedge i'll
[45:24] make him curse you
[45:27] so the lord accepted the challenge
[45:31] unbeknownst to job who was a great
[45:34] and wise man everything that he touched
[45:37] was successful
[45:39] everything was going good in his life
[45:41] amen he had no problems
[45:44] had wealth amen these kids were doing
[45:46] well
[45:48] amen but amen uh the lord began to brag
[45:52] on joe
[45:55] joe was an honest and an upright man
[45:58] so he told satan
[46:02] you got a deal i'll move the hedge
[46:06] but he said about and say but you can
[46:08] only go so far
[46:12] you can only go so far so job went
[46:15] through the trial
[46:17] and he stood the test and here in
[46:21] in the 27th chapter here he began to
[46:24] testify that he
[46:25] and and and and in that he said my
[46:28] righteousness
[46:30] i hold fast and i will not let go
[46:34] my heart shall not reproach me as long
[46:36] as i live
[46:38] as long as i live job had just came
[46:41] through a terrible trial
[46:43] amen he had you we know the story job
[46:46] went through a lot he lost his children
[46:47] he lost his wealth
[46:48] amen his health began to fail but
[46:51] job held on
[46:55] and he didn't let go amen and all was
[46:59] restored
[47:00] amen back to joe
[47:03] so we see here amen uh uh uh
[47:07] noah amen people begin to get seasick
[47:12] they're on the ship amen the troubles
[47:15] all around them as far as they can see
[47:18] was water and destruction
[47:21] amen amen and food was running low
[47:26] amen no doubt uh uh uh uh they began to
[47:29] get stressed out with one another
[47:31] amen began to get maybe a little short
[47:33] with one another
[47:35] and they are amen was so constructed in
[47:38] a way
[47:40] the prophet here in paragraph 93
[47:44] the art was so constructed when you were
[47:47] once
[47:47] in it there was only one window
[47:50] in it and it was right at the top
[47:55] you could you couldn't look sideways
[47:59] you couldn't look no way
[48:02] but straight up and that's
[48:06] the way the art of jesus christ
[48:09] is you can't look to the next fellow
[48:13] you can't look at nothing but christ
[48:16] when you're in new york because there's
[48:19] only one door
[48:21] and he's that door we talk about
[48:25] he said we talked about this morning you
[48:27] have to keep looking up
[48:30] for he that will put his hand to the
[48:34] plow
[48:34] and even turn to look back mine
[48:38] is not worthy of plowing
[48:42] now in this arc and he could see
[48:48] right and perhaps sunlight
[48:53] but he wonders where he was
[48:57] the ark was still floating he could hear
[49:00] the waves against the sides
[49:03] but he knew that there had been many
[49:05] days surely
[49:07] the water was receding by that time
[49:11] so he went and he got an untrusted
[49:15] bird a treacherous
[49:20] and he tried him and he
[49:23] sent him out see he was a crow
[49:28] amen he was a crow
[49:32] and that crow never did return
[49:36] because he found pleasure out there
[49:40] outside the ark
[49:43] and he flew from one old
[49:46] dead body to another
[49:49] eating the carcass and carrying on
[49:55] that was floating on the water
[49:58] and he was perfectly satisfied
[50:03] amen i got to stop right there for a
[50:06] minute
[50:09] see that old crow
[50:13] didn't hold on
[50:17] amen he was in the ark
[50:21] of safety
[50:24] amen but his heart
[50:28] was on the outside
[50:32] he was in the message
[50:36] coming to church but his heart
[50:41] was on the outside
[50:44] amen so he went out still looking over
[50:47] the bounds of the ship
[50:50] and finding pleasure
[50:53] on the outside
[50:56] looking to the things of the world
[51:00] finding pleasure on the outside
[51:04] see there was no holding there was no
[51:06] keeping power
[51:08] see because he could eat anything
[51:12] see he had a he had a a diet that he
[51:16] could
[51:16] he could swallow anything amen
[51:20] some slick fella
[51:23] amen to tell him tell him one thing
[51:27] and all of a sudden he
[51:31] gobble it up oh this is good

[52:20] in the ark
[52:22] amen there's no pleasure on the outside
[52:26] amen that's worth me leaving the ark
[52:33] amen
[52:40] so after several days he tried again
[52:44] and he know he didn't want to step
[52:48] out into the wrath of god
[52:52] so he turned a dove loose
[52:56] and the dove was a different natured
[52:59] bird
[53:02] and it was not a vulture
[53:05] nor was it a scavenger
[53:09] it can only eat the clean and pure
[53:11] things
[53:13] and it was so and it was so
[53:17] satisfied because it could not
[53:20] find nothing else to put the soles of
[53:23] its feet on it returned back to the ark
[53:28] noah said well this the floods
[53:31] still on amen
[53:36] the flood is still on
[53:42] then he waited several more days several
[53:44] other days and he sent

[54:06] time
[54:08] she may stay out there if the floods are
[54:11] down
[54:12] she may stay but he sent her out
[54:16] by prayer and then
[54:19] when she went out there
[54:22] directed by god she picked
[54:26] off an olive leaf of a tree and
[54:29] flew back and pecked on the window again
[54:34] god used the dove amen for a sign
[54:38] she come back saying the flood is over
[54:42] and then god opened the door and they
