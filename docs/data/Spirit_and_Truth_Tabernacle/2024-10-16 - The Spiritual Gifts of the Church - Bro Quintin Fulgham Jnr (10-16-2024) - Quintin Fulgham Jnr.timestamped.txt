[11:40] beginning to the end in the precious
[11:41] name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen so
[11:46] we are going to continue our lesson on
[11:49] um the spiritual gifts of the church uh
[11:52] and we're going to do our scripture
[11:53] reading from uh 1 Corinthians uh 12
[11:57] 8-11 just so we can kind of um look at
[12:01] those uh look at the next gifts that
[12:02] we're going to talk about amen all
[12:05] right just say Amen once you get
[12:10] there and I'll just start reading
[12:16] it amen so it says here for to one is
[12:20] given by the spirit the word of wisdom
[12:22] to another the word of knowledge by The
[12:24] Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same
[12:27] Spirit to another the gifts
[12:29] of healing by The Same Spirit to another
[12:31] the working of Miracles to another
[12:33] prophecy to another Discerning of
[12:35] spirits to another diverse kinds of
[12:37] tongues to another interpretation of
[12:39] tongues but all these worketh the one
[12:42] and the self-same spirit dividing to
[12:44] every man severly as he will and you may
[12:48] take your
[12:49] seats so so so far we've talked about
[12:52] the gifts of wisdom knowledge Faith um
[12:57] the gifts of healing Miracles and so now
[12:59] we're going to uh turn to the gifts of
[13:01] Prophecy uh I think brother Jack has
[13:03] done a real good job of talking about
[13:05] the gifts of tongues and interpretation
[13:08] uh telling you what they are how they're
[13:10] to be used into the church uh so we're
[13:13] going to start with this gift of
[13:15] Prophecy um and I looked online at a
[13:19] definition on Miriam of what prophecy
[13:22] meant and the prophecy what they said
[13:24] was an inspired utterance of a prophet
[13:27] right so a prophecy is a is a two-way
[13:31] street where it tells you of things that
[13:33] are going to happen and it also can tell
[13:36] you about past events as well so
[13:38] prophecy doesn't care what happens in
[13:40] between right it already sees the
[13:43] outcome done that's all that it's
[13:45] looking at so and we heard the story
[13:47] from our brother um that preached on
[13:50] Sunday about the man that was blind he
[13:52] went up to the prophet and we know he
[13:54] said all right you got your sight when
[13:56] the prophet said that he had already
[13:58] seen the with the eyes so when the man
[14:01] went back and started doubting and he
[14:03] started doubting and he came back with
[14:04] the prophet he said hey I thought you
[14:05] said that you were healed the prophet
[14:07] said I thought that you believed so the
[14:09] prophet had already saw him with eyes
[14:11] and couldn't see nothing else so this
[14:14] gift of Prophecy is a mighty prophecy in
[14:16] that when we can find an individual that
[14:18] can come to you and speak a word to you
[14:20] it doesn't matter what happens in
[14:22] between right doesn't matter what you go
[14:24] through it doesn't matter how you feel
[14:26] doesn't matter how long it takes that's
[14:28] all that God looking at and God expects
[14:30] us to just look at the same thing right
[14:33] so I want to kind of give an experience
[14:35] because I remember one time I was with
[14:37] the youth I think it was Joseph and um
[14:40] and his sisters we were at the uh we
[14:41] were at the basketball court on H Hill
[14:43] cuz we were having like a little youth
[14:44] outing and I was you know I was out
[14:47] there just you know being with the youth
[14:49] and this one lady had seen me with the
[14:51] youth and um so I got to talking to her
[14:54] and she's you know she's uh she's a
[14:56] Christian uh I was talking to her she
[14:58] said she was a minister and stuff like
[14:59] that and so I'm kind of hearing hearing
[15:01] her and stuff like that and she admired
[15:02] the way that I was working with the
[15:04] youth uh and so she kind of spoke a word
[15:07] over me and said you know you're going
[15:09] to be doing something for the Youth
[15:11] somewhere along that lines and I kind of
[15:13] It kind of struck me and I was like okay
[15:14] that just sounds interesting um I'm
[15:16] always careful about those things
[15:18] especially when they come from people
[15:20] that I know don't have the fullness of
[15:22] the word but then some month later or I
[15:25] think it was the next year later brother
[15:26] Jack had come up to me and said hey do
[15:28] you want to start teaching for the Youth
[15:30] and so that made me think back to the
[15:32] time where she kind of spoke that word
[15:35] because gifts and callings are without
[15:37] repentance don't need the Holy Spirit to
[15:39] have a gift if you have the gift of
[15:41] Prophecy and that Spirit comes over you
[15:43] utters a word to somebody and it's God's
[15:46] word it'll come to pass and so that made
[15:48] me look back and say oh wow okay so she
[15:50] spoke that word over me and the gift of
[15:53] Prophecy is not um it's not gender
[15:56] exclusive like other Ministries no
[15:59] females can speak a word get a speak get
[16:02] a word of Prophecy and speak it over
[16:03] your life that's right right and so it
[16:07] uh um and so but we have to put an
[16:09] emphasis on this gift because the spirit
[16:12] of Prophecy is an interesting gift and
[16:13] it's an easy gift to understand they
[16:15] speak a word it's a word given by God
[16:17] you believe it it comes to pass how do
[16:20] and how did I know how do I know of
[16:22] confidence that what she said was true
[16:25] well it came to pass amen it's simple as
[16:27] that when God speaks word amen it just
[16:30] comes to pass there's no question about
[16:33] it because it's a living thing now
[16:35] because God's word is a living thing
[16:37] right amen but we have to put a real
[16:40] emphasis on this gift and caution uh
[16:42] because it's tied to um end time um uh
[16:47] prophecy and stuff so we're going to
[16:49] turn to Matthew uh
[16:51] 24:24 we're going to go through some
[16:53] Bible verses that kind of help us kind
[16:55] of understand because it's it's not just
[16:58] important to understand what a gift is
[17:01] but it's important to understand how it
[17:02] has to operate within a church how it
[17:04] can be used because it can be used for
[17:06] good and it can also be used for bad
[17:09] right so reading from Matthew 24 it says
[17:13] for there shall rise false christs and
[17:16] false prophets and shall show great
[17:19] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[17:21] were possible they shall deceive the
[17:23] very elect and I like how the Bible puts
[17:26] this inside of here that
[17:29] when you are elect and you've received
[17:31] the baptism Holy Spirit don't ever think
[17:33] that you're above the point of being
[17:35] deceived right don't ever think that
[17:38] just because you're going to church and
[17:40] this is one reason why you're young folk
[17:41] you have to get the baptism Holy Spirit
[17:43] you can't depend upon your parents
[17:46] experience coming in church every single
[17:48] Sunday as to hold you no you need the
[17:50] word of God inside yourself to be able
[17:53] to shift through the deception right so
[17:56] and the Bible clearly says that it will
[17:57] come through false proph prophets with
[17:59] false prophecies and it would deceive
[18:01] the very elect meaning that things would
[18:03] look so close to being the real thing
[18:07] that and that it would very test you and
[18:09] God and and the reason why that Jesus
[18:12] Christ um Jesus Christ could actually
[18:14] say this thing and give us confidence
[18:16] that what the Holy Ghost will overcome
[18:17] is because when he was tempted he was
[18:20] taken up to the mountain now Satan
[18:22] didn't tempt them with drugs didn't
[18:24] tempt them with women didn't tempt them
[18:26] with any kind of uh you would think as
[18:29] sin he temped him with the word of God
[18:31] he gave him the word of God and when it
[18:34] says tempt that doesn't mean that Jesus
[18:36] just brushed it off the devil just came
[18:38] into his head and he said hey this is
[18:39] this say and Jesus said all right just
[18:41] get the behind me whatever no Jesus sat
[18:44] there and tempted was like oh hold on a
[18:45] second this thing sounds really really
[18:47] really close and we know that temptation
[18:49] is not sin but you're still kind of
[18:52] going through and you're understanding
[18:53] the weaknesses and the Bible says that
[18:55] Jesus had to be tempted so he can help
[18:57] those that are tempted so you're going
[18:59] to need the baptism Holy Spirit in order
[19:01] to un uh to get past uh some of these uh
[19:04] gifts especially this gift of Prophecy
[19:07] all right right so we're going to turn
[19:09] to Jeremiah 14:14 just to read some more
[19:12] bible verses to further understand this
[19:17] point and it says
[19:20] here then the Lord said unto me the
[19:23] prophets prophesying lies in my name I
[19:26] sent them not neither have I commanded
[19:28] at them neither spake unto them they
[19:31] prophesy unto you a false vision and
[19:33] divination and a thing of not and the
[19:35] deceit of their heart right we're also
[19:39] going to turn to Jeremiah 23 uh
[19:46] 616 right and Jeremiah reads in uh verse
[19:50] 16 thus sayith the Lord of hosts hearken
[19:53] not unto the words of the prophets that
[19:56] prophesy unto you they make they make
[19:58] you vain they speak a vision of their
[20:00] own heart and not out of the mouth of
[20:04] the Lord so God gives These Warnings
[20:06] because prophecy has a
[20:09] strong uh what you call convincing
[20:12] Spirit behind it to believe that
[20:14] something is true right right so we need
[20:17] to understand how this gift of Prophecy
[20:19] uh Works in order for us to be able to
[20:22] know when we're in a correct prophecy
[20:25] and when we're not in the correct
[20:26] prophecy right and in the first thing
[20:29] that you have to do when you understand
[20:30] the difference of a gift of Prophecy and
[20:33] uh uh the difference for the gift of
[20:35] Prophecy is when when I was doing my
[20:37] search in uh when I was looking up the
[20:39] gifts of Prophecy looking in the message
[20:40] doing searches the prophet does mention
[20:43] gift of Prophecy but he also mentions a
[20:46] prophet with that as well to show you
[20:48] what the difference is between them and
[20:50] that kind of helps you to understand how
[20:53] this gift is to be used and what the
[20:55] difference is now a prophet which is a
[20:58] capital P they're born a prophet right
[21:01] that is someone that has been hand
[21:02] selected by God through every single
[21:04] generation through every single age that
[21:07] a certain mother a certain father and
[21:09] mother would come together and create
[21:10] this person and he would be built in
[21:12] such a way that he would be a prophet he
[21:15] would be someone that is built
[21:16] physically because when brother brandham
[21:19] before he received the baptism of the
[21:20] Holy Spirit the voice of God still spoke
[21:23] to him when he was a kid he would hear
[21:25] things uh telling them not to drink and
[21:27] not to smoke and that was God's gift and
[21:30] just to show that it was born a gift and
[21:32] it's not something that you just come
[21:33] into the you just become a Christian oh
[21:35] I want to become a prophet that's not
[21:36] how it works God creates you a certain
[21:39] way to be able to handle the word of the
[21:41] Lord and hear the word of the Lord right
[21:43] the prophet said that the word of the
[21:45] Lord comes to the prophets amen meaning
[21:48] that you can't correct a prophet when a
[21:50] prophet says something that's it that's
[21:54] God's voice that's God's mouth right so
[21:57] we're going to turn to uh the Rapture
[21:59] the message Rapture 651 1204 starting
[22:03] from paragraph
[22:05] 136 see prophecy is a is a is a mighty
[22:08] mighty thing there has to be order to it
[22:10] and it reads here in 136 now prophets
[22:13] there's such a thing as gift of Prophecy
[22:16] in the church that's what God gives
[22:18] certain individuals in the church they
[22:19] have a gift of Prophecy but a prophet is
[22:21] predestinated and for ordained amen not
[22:24] just coming anywhere but for a specific
[22:27] hour amen which means Moses couldn't be
[22:29] coming couldn't come to our day brother
[22:31] brandham couldn't go to his day Noah
[22:33] couldn't go to Jesus day Jesus couldn't
[22:35] go to Noah's day right they're born for
[22:37] a particular hour see yes sir now if a
[22:40] prophecy Goes Forth now he's talking
[22:42] about Prophecy in the church yes two or
[22:45] three has to set and judge whether
[22:48] that's right or not amen it's no
[22:50] different than uh uh speaking in tongues
[22:52] where you got to make sure that uh if
[22:54] someone's speaking in a Tong you got to
[22:55] make sure that thing lines up with the
[22:56] word there has to be an interpretation
[22:58] Lins with the words and this gift of
[22:59] Prophecy that comes into the church that
[23:01] some of you may have it has to be judged
[23:04] two or three people have to judge that
[23:05] to make sure that it's thus save the
[23:06] Lord the prophet says here whether that
[23:08] is right or not before the church can
[23:10] receive it so before we even receive a
[23:12] prophecy we have to make sure that it's
[23:14] righten verse um in paragraph 3 137 says
[23:17] but nobody set before Prophet cuz he was
[23:21] he was absolutely the word of God he was
[23:25] the he was that word in his day you
[23:27] seeing God reflect now God has promised
[23:29] to send that again in the last days to
[23:30] bring the bride out of the ecclesiastic
[23:33] mess and the only way it can be done and
[23:35] the reason why you said that because he
[23:36] says in the next paragraph We just read
[23:38] the first sentence it'll never be done
[23:40] the church can't receive Christ because
[23:42] during the time when the gifts were
[23:43] being restored the gift of Prophecy was
[23:46] there but it still didn't bring them
[23:48] back to the true word right God had to
[23:50] raise up a individual right hand
[23:52] selected to be able to bring the
[23:54] fullness of the word while the gifts are
[23:56] being restored as well right so that's
[23:59] why we believe in the gift of prophecies
[24:01] but there's a place that you still have
[24:03] and you have to follow uh in order for
[24:05] it to be received praise God right um
[24:09] let's see where we're at okay so the
[24:11] gift of Prophecy has to be judged by two
[24:13] or three before it's received uh and the
[24:15] prophet doesn't have that limitation
[24:17] right what he says is what he says is
[24:19] thus sayith the Lord and what we're
[24:21] going to do is we're going to see in the
[24:22] Bible how we have to be careful about
[24:24] this gift of Prophecy and even for
[24:26] people that come into the church with
[24:28] gifts as well you have to kind of be
[24:30] careful about that so we're going to
[24:32] turn to numbers um 12 and uh we're going
[24:36] to read verses
[24:40] 1-8
[24:42] amen all right and it reads and Miriam
[24:45] and Aaron spoke against Moses because of
[24:48] the Ethiopian women he had married for
[24:50] he had married an Ethiopian women and
[24:52] they said notice the attitude because
[24:55] you have to remember here that Aaron was
[24:57] a was a a priest but he also was kind of
[25:01] a representation of a prophet because
[25:03] when God when Moses told God that hey
[25:05] I'm not an elegant speaker he said okay
[25:07] fine then you'll be God Aaron will be
[25:10] your Prophet that's right right so Aaron
[25:12] kind of represented a prophet that's
[25:14] right um and then also Miriam was a
[25:16] propheus as well right so they knew the
[25:20] gifts that they had but you have to be
[25:22] careful about it cuz look at the
[25:23] attitude here and they said hath the
[25:25] Lord indeed spoken only by Moses
[25:29] hath he not spoken also by us and the
[25:31] Bible says and the Lord Lord heard it
[25:34] now the man Moses was very Meek above
[25:36] all men which were on the face of the
[25:38] earth and the Lord spake suddenly unto
[25:40] Moses now here's God speaking directly
[25:42] unto Moses and unto Aaron and unto
[25:44] Miriam it should have been that God
[25:46] speaks to Moses and then Moses speaks to
[25:48] the people right says come out ye there
[25:52] unto the Tabernacle of the congregation
[25:54] and the three came out and the Lord came
[25:56] down the pillar and the cloud and stood
[25:58] in the door of the Tabernacle so you can
[26:00] imagine how they felt that God is now
[26:02] descending into a cloud and now he's
[26:04] coming to church to speak to them and
[26:05] called Aaron and Miram and they both
[26:07] came forth and he said here and he said
[26:10] hear now my words if there be a prophet
[26:13] among you now this isn't major prophet
[26:15] right this is not a major prophet I the
[26:18] Lord will make myself known unto him in
[26:19] a vision and I will speak unto him in a
[26:22] dream and I like how it says dream
[26:24] because we're going to get to that later
[26:25] because some of you have the ability to
[26:27] dream
[26:29] and brother Jack as brother Jack has
[26:30] said when a dream has been interpreted
[26:33] it becomes a vision and it is a prophecy
[26:35] if it's telling of something to come
[26:37] right so this is how this is God telling
[26:39] like you know I'll deal with you guys in
[26:41] visions and dreams verse 7 says my
[26:43] servant Moses is not so who is faithful
[26:47] in all my house with him will I speak
[26:50] mouth to mouth even apparently and not
[26:52] in dark speeches and what I believe that
[26:54] dark speeches is you can have a dream
[26:57] and not really understand understand
[26:58] what it is and it seems like man this
[27:00] thing is just confusing you need someone
[27:02] to come and interpret it which we'll get
[27:03] to that later on or you can receive a
[27:06] word from the Lord just man I'm just I
[27:07] just don't understand what this thing is
[27:09] I just I just got to pray about it I got
[27:10] to fast about it to really get
[27:12] clarification but when God speaks to a
[27:15] prophet it's clears day there's no need
[27:18] for interpretation there's no need to go
[27:20] fast about it God speaks the word and
[27:22] that is the word for the day amen right
[27:25] amen and the similar to the Lord shall
[27:27] he behold wherefore then were ye not
[27:29] afraid to speak against my servant Moses
[27:32] right so we have to really understand
[27:34] how these gifts uh operate in the church
[27:36] and we're also going to turn to numbers
[27:38] 16 just to read some more about this
[27:41] order of the gift uh we're going to read
[27:43] verses one just one just one through
[27:46] three it says here now core so core was
[27:49] a priest as well says now cor the son of
[27:53] isar the son of Kath the son of Levi and
[27:57] Dayan uh um and ab bam the sons of eliab
[28:03] and on the son of paleth Sons of R Rubin
[28:06] took men and they rose up before Moses
[28:09] with certain of the children of Israel
[28:11] 250 princes of the assembly famous in
[28:13] the congregation and Men of R now and
[28:15] that and so one thing you have to
[28:16] realize about these gifts especially you
[28:18] know Gifts of Prophecy people love to
[28:22] make themselves famous with it you go on
[28:24] if you go you go on Instagram and you'll
[28:26] see you'll see Prophet m
[28:28] or Prophet Angela you know with a word
[28:31] for the day and everybody wants to be
[28:34] famous with it everybody wants to have
[28:35] Renown use their gift to have Renown
[28:37] with it but God doesn't operate in those
[28:40] things and I'm not saying that they
[28:41] don't have a genuine gift oh my they
[28:44] have a genuine gift amen but there has
[28:46] to be an order to it amen so verse three
[28:48] says and they gathered themselves
[28:49] together against Moses and against Aaron
[28:51] and said unto them ye take too much upon
[28:54] you seeing all the congregation Are Holy
[28:57] every one of them and the Lord is among
[28:59] them and the prophet said he was right
[29:03] when K had said that what he was saying
[29:05] was right the congregation is Holy right
[29:07] because it's a holy God it's not it's
[29:09] not holy people but it's a holy God in
[29:11] individuals but they're still in order
[29:14] of things that you have to follow and it
[29:16] says wherefore then then lift Ye Ye
[29:18] yourselves above the congregation of the
[29:20] Lord and that's where the problem came
[29:23] because God had designated Moses as the
[29:26] head man and so when these gifts get to
[29:28] operating because what you'll see later
[29:30] down is what it did was it split the
[29:33] congregation right and so when these
[29:35] gifts begin to operate in the church we
[29:37] have to be careful about how they're
[29:39] operating especially Gifts of Prophecy
[29:41] and stuff like that because that's how
[29:43] the churches get split in half and and
[29:46] one of the things that I like about the
[29:48] true leadership uh um because whenever
[29:51] you see someone trying to divide a
[29:53] church that right there that birth of
[29:56] the idea when you're when something is
[29:58] born wrong it can't be right am and so
[30:01] when your intentions is to split a
[30:04] church and you don't care about nothing
[30:06] else it is not going to be right but
[30:09] when the so when the congregation has
[30:11] split
[30:12] themselves and God said I'm going to go
[30:15] and Destroy everybody Moses who had been
[30:17] bir from the right way of starting a
[30:19] church said no should one person sin and
[30:22] everybody else perish and he stood in
[30:24] the Gap and God said okay go over to the
[30:26] church tell them people to come on your
[30:28] side because I'm about to do something
[30:29] to these people right cor and them
[30:31] didn't care about none about that he
[30:33] didn't care if they perish and everybody
[30:34] else perish and that's how you can tell
[30:36] if something is a Birthright so that's
[30:38] why you have to be careful about uh uh
[30:40] about these gifts that can uh that can
[30:42] that can rise up in the church even
[30:44] though they're genuine they're genuine
[30:46] gifts and we're going I'm going to turn
[30:47] to the Le of thean church age is not up
[30:49] there I couldn't find the paragraphs
[30:51] associated with it but I wanted just to
[30:54] read through a section here it says but
[30:56] he um brother brandham says before we
[30:58] close this section on the messenger of
[31:00] the Le of theen age we must seriously
[31:02] consider these two thoughts seriously
[31:04] consider first this age will have one
[31:07] Prophet messenger Revelation 10:7 says
[31:10] when he singular shall go shall begin to
[31:12] sound there has never been an age where
[31:15] God gave his people two Major Prophets
[31:17] at one time yeah right so a gift of
[31:19] prophet having a gift of Prophecy
[31:21] doesn't make you in charge so that's why
[31:24] I was kind of skeptical when skeptical
[31:26] when this lady prayed over me when when
[31:28] she called herself a minister I said oh
[31:30] wow you know because gifts can cause
[31:33] people to get themselves out of place
[31:36] you know then you have female a female
[31:37] that can have a honest gift of Prophecy
[31:40] females can have the Bible says there
[31:42] are prophe they can have gifts of
[31:44] Prophecy right but when you elevate
[31:46] yourself into a Ministry position that's
[31:48] held for a particular position you're
[31:50] out of order and it's not it's the same
[31:53] for um and it's it's the same for this
[31:56] day when you have people that may be
[31:57] prophets and then you try to elevate
[32:00] yourself of the prophet of the day and
[32:02] try to replace what he said come on now
[32:04] with what he did not say that's right
[32:06] right that's right there has never been
[32:08] and I'm not saying that people are not
[32:10] prophets to have gifts I believe they're
[32:12] genuine gifts but they're just not
[32:14] operating in place we want prophecy to
[32:17] operate in order right so there there
[32:20] has never been an age where God gave his
[32:22] people two Major Prophets at one time
[32:24] amen he gave Enoch alone he gave Noah
[32:27] alone gave Moses and this is the one we
[32:29] want to talk about he gave Moses he
[32:31] alone hath the word though others
[32:34] prophesy so we're not taking away
[32:36] prophecy we want the prophecies to come
[32:38] they just have to line up with the word
[32:40] for the day so you can't be prophesying
[32:43] saying hey I I saw all of us at Ruby
[32:45] Tuesday fellowshipping drinking alcohol
[32:48] you know uh having a good old time in uh
[32:51] in the in the name of the Lord when the
[32:53] prophet said you ain't supposed to be
[32:54] drinking alcohol amen that wouldn't be a
[32:57] prophecy that we will follow all
[33:00] right um so prophecies uh the prophecies
[33:05] are supposed to work with the word when
[33:07] you receive a prophecy or you have a
[33:09] gift of Prophecy it's supposed to work
[33:11] with the word so that we know it's
[33:12] something that we could uh we can stand
[33:14] on
[33:17] um and so and and another thing that we
[33:20] kind of want to look at is because now
[33:23] we live in a we live in a day and age
[33:25] where the Prophet is no longer here
[33:27] right and a lot of times people can get
[33:30] very remin reminiscent of The Times They
[33:32] had when the prophet was here and they
[33:34] you know how they wished he was here um
[33:37] and I know that there are some there are
[33:38] certain instances where people will
[33:40] experience that they're going through
[33:42] something right and they'll play a tape
[33:44] of and brother Brandon will be in a
[33:45] prayer line and they'll hear while he's
[33:47] praying over someone he'll he'll pray
[33:49] out their condition that's right and
[33:51] speak their condition and I believe
[33:52] that's well and fine and that can happen
[33:55] but if you don't hear nothing don't
[33:57] think that a word of Prophecy still
[33:59] can't come over for your position when
[34:01] you come to church that's why God placed
[34:04] the gift of Prophecy in the church so
[34:06] that because uh God realized that
[34:09] sometimes when you're going through a
[34:10] situation you need a particular Avenue
[34:12] to hear the word and that's why you have
[34:14] the gifts come through faith you have
[34:15] gifts come through healing gifts come
[34:17] through the ministry and then the gift
[34:18] of Prophecy God knows that for a
[34:20] particular situation or particular
[34:22] challenge you'll need a particular gift
[34:24] and some people you know when they're
[34:26] going through you'll need a gift of
[34:28] Prophecy in order to get you through and
[34:29] we're going to read about that uh uh a
[34:31] little bit later on down the word right
[34:35] um so you don't question a prophet for
[34:37] your day right you have a gift of
[34:39] Prophecy we judge them by the church um
[34:42] the end time it talks about how we're uh
[34:44] this Pro these false prophets would try
[34:46] to deceive us uh so the other thing that
[34:49] makes a prophet different from a gift of
[34:51] Prophecy uh is um the way that they see
[34:56] prophecy all right so we're going to
[34:58] turn to um the message Serv be of a good
[35:01] cheer preached in
[35:03] 54 and paragraph 29 through
[35:10] 31 and I'll just start reading so it
[35:13] says now on this subconscious when this
[35:15] outer conscious becomes active so he's
[35:18] talking about the subconscious so you so
[35:20] basically you have a conscious every one
[35:21] of us are conscious right now because
[35:23] we're seeing everybody and we're
[35:25] perceiving everything and then you have
[35:26] the subconscious that is also in the
[35:28] back of your head right so now on the
[35:30] subconscious when this outer conscious
[35:32] becomes act inactive this conscious
[35:34] becomes active to a dreamer now let's
[35:37] give just a little illustration here's
[35:39] the first conscious here's a normal man
[35:41] his subconscious when this one is active
[35:43] inactive at night when he's asleep then
[35:45] this one's then this one's active so
[35:46] what he's saying is that while you're
[35:48] awake your conscious is active and
[35:50] you're able to perceive and see things
[35:52] and uh uh experience the real word but
[35:54] when you're asleep your subconscious
[35:57] then takes over over right and that's
[35:58] why some people can see dreams and have
[36:00] dreams that are very very Vivid where
[36:02] they actually feel stuff because it's
[36:03] the subconscious working right and the
[36:06] prophet said many of you people that
[36:07] dreamed dreams years ago you still
[36:09] remember it don't you and I and I like
[36:11] how it ties in this dream because we're
[36:12] going to get to we're going to get to
[36:14] the dreams uh as being kind of a gift as
[36:16] well for some people it says well there
[36:19] was some part of you somewhere because
[36:21] after you're awake you remember what you
[36:22] dreamed of is that right and sometime
[36:25] when you're dreaming you dream of things
[36:26] that you did when you was conscious is
[36:28] that right but now the man that doesn't
[36:30] dream a dream so people that don't dream
[36:32] his subconscious is way back even an
[36:35] aesthetic wouldn't throw him back there
[36:37] cuz he sleeps real sound so if you sleep
[36:40] in real sound you probably not a dreamer
[36:42] right if if you going to bed and you
[36:44] having a real good night's sleep you
[36:46] probably not no dreamer right am so and
[36:49] it says now a dreamer doesn't sleep
[36:51] sound he's not altogether sleep and so I
[36:54] don't know if any and I know I don't
[36:55] know if anyone here has experienced
[36:57] there's a there's a concept out there
[36:59] called sleep paralysis and sleep
[37:01] paralysis if you go on line and you and
[37:03] you read of what it is sleep paralysis
[37:05] is when you're in a state when you're
[37:07] asleep but you're not asleep and what
[37:09] people describe it as is that your body
[37:11] is in a state where you're Frozen you
[37:13] can't move and a lot of people and I'm
[37:15] not trying to scare anybody but a lot of
[37:17] people see some crazy stuff uh in those
[37:20] sleep prises I remember I was online and
[37:22] I was reading through and some people
[37:23] one person had saw this woman that was
[37:26] running toward him screaming and another
[37:28] person that saw like a dark figure um
[37:32] that was by the kitchen or something so
[37:34] people see some really scary things uh
[37:36] because they're in they're I'm they're
[37:38] kind of perceiving another dimension
[37:40] right um so that's what he's kind of
[37:42] talking about when he's saying uh when
[37:44] you dream dreams and you're kind of
[37:46] conscious of what you remember because
[37:48] while you were dreaming you actually
[37:49] remembered and saw what you had saw it's
[37:52] not something you made up in your mind
[37:53] right yes so now in verse uh ver but
[37:57] paragraph 30 now but a Seer or a prophet
[38:01] now I admit there's a gift of Prophecy
[38:03] that goes into the church but that's not
[38:05] a prophet a prophet's born see now he
[38:08] must be from childhood up in every word
[38:10] right see now the Seer his subconscious
[38:13] is not not backed by the wall neither is
[38:15] it here it's right here they're both
[38:18] together so a prophet is born with his
[38:20] conscious and his uh his conscious and
[38:23] his subconscious are together all of us
[38:26] our subcon and our conscious is
[38:28] separated we in order for us to dream
[38:31] things we have to go to sleep right but
[38:33] the prophet his subconscious and
[38:34] conscious is together right that's what
[38:36] makes him different you see what I'm
[38:38] saying no one can impersonate that you
[38:40] can't you have to be born that way right
[38:42] God has to select certain genes in order
[38:44] for that thing to be activated for you
[38:46] to be called a prophet of your day so
[38:48] it's not even it's not even about the
[38:50] word you bring even though that's
[38:52] important it's about how you're born and
[38:54] how God made you that's how God selects
[38:56] the person uh for their day right the
[38:59] messenger for their day right so he says
[39:02] it's right here they're both right
[39:04] together he doesn't go to sleep he just
[39:06] breaks from one to another see it's like
[39:08] a dream yet you're conscious you're St
[39:11] you're you're standing here yet it's
[39:12] just like you was dreaming something and
[39:14] yet you're conscious enough that you can
[39:15] talk about it and you know what you know
[39:18] your voice is coming back in the
[39:19] building yet you're somewhere else
[39:21] here's another key part maybe 30 40
[39:24] years back or forward or wherever would
[39:27] be so that's why we can trust that's why
[39:31] we can trust people that have this gift
[39:33] and uh brother Jack had talked about you
[39:36] know when Moses wrote the Book of
[39:39] Genesis yeah he was not there amen but
[39:42] provided so much detail of what happened
[39:45] right and how did he get that detail he
[39:48] had a vision and he exactly saw what
[39:51] happens and the problem with man is that
[39:53] when man reads the Bible and gets an
[39:55] interpretation they don't see anything
[39:57] so it's kind of like when you go to
[39:59] court and let's say you have a man that
[40:01] you have two people on the side you have
[40:03] a man that has stole something or
[40:04] allegedly stole something and someone
[40:06] and his lawyer is saying no he didn't
[40:08] steal anything and you have another
[40:09] lawyer over here saying no he did steal
[40:11] something right and so they're just
[40:12] going back and forth and this Lord
[40:14] that's trying to defend the thief is
[40:15] saying you know the the people say you
[40:17] know he people saw he was wearing a red
[40:19] shirt and he stole these things he said
[40:21] well there was probably a lot of people
[40:22] in the store wearing a red shirt so he's
[40:23] doing everything he can to defend him
[40:25] and they're just going back and back and
[40:26] forth and finally someone pulls up video
[40:29] evidence now when the video was played
[40:32] and they see your face stilling
[40:33] something the argument is over and
[40:36] that's what a vision is like from a
[40:38] prophet when they see something it's no
[40:40] longer just something they're making up
[40:42] or they're trying to theorize or they're
[40:44] trying to hypothesize about no they saw
[40:46] what happened so when you look at a lot
[40:48] of denominations today and I've been to
[40:51] this uh my at my old church we went to
[40:53] this play called sights and sounds and
[40:55] they did the play of Jonah and so when
[40:57] Jonah was ready to get swallowed up they
[40:59] had this big old whale out there and and
[41:01] he was in the in the belly of a big old
[41:03] whale but when Moses had a vision he saw
[41:05] a fish he didn't see a whale so you see
[41:08] how people can interpret the wrong thing
[41:10] when they read it but Moses it wasn't
[41:12] some Theory to him he saw Jonah in a
[41:15] fish and said hey Jonah was in a fish
[41:18] right so they see these things uh as
[41:20] clear as day uh which gives them
[41:23] confidence and that's why brother
[41:24] brandham when he would break out in
[41:26] vision just to show people that it
[41:29] wasn't something he was making up he
[41:30] would give a description of you to a tea
[41:33] he says you're wearing white socks pink
[41:35] shoes I see you in a blue blouse it's
[41:38] sunny outside but it looks like it's
[41:40] about to rain over there there's a deer
[41:42] in the back the dog is barking right
[41:45] because he's right there just seeing at
[41:46] these things happen and that's how we
[41:48] can have confidence that you know for
[41:50] your situation and even it's still the
[41:53] same for a word of Prophecy when someone
[41:55] in the church gives you an inspire
[41:57] that's why I like the definitions it's
[41:58] inspired it's not something they're
[42:00] making up when someone gives you an
[42:02] inspired word that your situation is
[42:04] taken care of you can rest just as much
[42:07] as if it was a vision that the prophet
[42:09] had given you Hallelujah right Glory
[42:12] God's already seen the Victory and you
[42:15] can rest in that amen right and so so
[42:19] we're going to go down to this um this
[42:22] concept of dreams as a form of Prophecy
[42:24] right because brother Jack has said when
[42:26] a dream is interpreted correctly it's
[42:28] it's it becomes a vision um now dreams
[42:32] have to be uh judged as well so we're
[42:35] going to turn to Genesis uh chapter
[42:41] 41 and read a couple of verses in here
[42:45] and we're going to read verse
[42:47] eight and it says and it came to pass in
[42:49] the morning that his Spirit was troubled
[42:51] so they're talking about the Pharaoh the
[42:52] Pharaoh had the Pharaoh had a dream and
[42:55] this dream had troubled him
[42:58] and his Spirit was troubled the Pharaoh
[42:59] and he sent and called for all the M The
[43:02] Magicians of Egypt and all the wise men
[43:04] thereof and Pharaoh told them this dream
[43:06] but there was none that could interpret
[43:08] them unto Pharaoh right so and that's
[43:11] kind of goes that kind of goes back to
[43:13] when God was telling uh Miriam and them
[43:15] that you know when I talk to prophets I
[43:17] don't talk in dark sayings or things
[43:19] that like you don't understand and
[43:20] you're troubled and you need some kind
[43:21] of help to understand what this thing is
[43:23] so this this uh this dream of pharaoh he
[43:25] was troubled by it but he didn't
[43:27] understand what it was so turning to uh
[43:30] verse 15 and and uh 15 verse 16 I want
[43:35] you I want you to see the attitude of of
[43:37] Joseph because this is this is this is
[43:39] the kind of people that we want
[43:40] operating gift that's why you don't just
[43:42] want to have a gift you want to have
[43:43] character that goes with a gift because
[43:46] that'll make sure that the church is
[43:47] running smooth right so it says and
[43:49] Pharaoh said unto Joseph I have dreamed
[43:51] a dream and there is none that can
[43:52] interpret it and I have heard I heard
[43:55] say of thee that thou can't understand a
[43:57] dream to interpret them and Joseph
[43:59] answered Pharaoh saying it is not in Me
[44:03] God shall give Pharaoh an answer of
[44:04] Peace so here is uh Joseph not trying to
[44:07] Puff himself up but turning it back to
[44:10] God exactly and and that's what we try
[44:13] to do so even when you have a dream and
[44:15] that's why and this is me personally I
[44:17] believe if you have a dream it still has
[44:19] to be judged even if it was a prophecy
[44:22] it's still got to be judged you can't
[44:23] just believe that thing and run with it
[44:25] we need to take it back to God right
[44:27] because uh I like that I like the answer
[44:29] that that Joseph said God shall give
[44:31] Pharaoh an answer of Peace God will let
[44:34] you know if this thing is real or not
[44:36] and that is settl it right so gifts um
[44:39] dreams prophecies always have to be
[44:41] judged but if it's a prophet saying
[44:43] something you don't have to worry about
[44:45] amen trying to interpret that or not
[44:48] interpret that and so during this in
[44:50] this example this was an example of of
[44:53] Joseph he uh interpreted the dream of
[44:55] some turmoil that was coming into Egypt
[44:58] that exactly came to pass and contrast
[45:01] that to Noah when God told Noah of a
[45:04] tmal that was going to come God told
[45:06] Noah and Noah saw it directly and told
[45:08] the people there was no interpretation
[45:10] needed no hey we need to pray and ask
[45:12] God is this thing right that Noah gave
[45:13] us no that was the word of Lord and it
[45:16] and it came directly to pass right so
[45:18] the gift of Prophecy is an utterance is
[45:20] an inspired utterance that has to be
[45:21] under the word of God has to be by the
[45:23] pro it has to be under according to the
[45:25] word of the Prophet so you can't have a
[45:26] prophecy outside of the prophecy that's
[45:29] how you'll fall away in the end time and
[45:31] the Holy Spirit helps you to stay with
[45:33] the word for your day amen and so what
[45:35] we want to do is we want to see this
[45:37] gift of Prophecy and action in modern
[45:39] times in a very interesting uh situation
[45:42] so we're going to turn to question and
[45:44] answers number
[45:45] three um uh it's
[45:48] 64830 and paragraph
[45:53] 221 amen
[45:58] okay I'll just start reading and it says
[46:00] um I think our and this is brother
[46:02] brandham cuz someone had uh someone had
[46:05] asked a question he said uh this person
[46:07] said dearly beloved about the scripture
[46:09] of emphasis 4:11 through1 13 do we all
[46:12] do we do we get all perfecting of saints
[46:14] through the tapes or should we be here
[46:16] where the gifts of the Spirit are
[46:17] operating and the different offices of
[46:19] the church to help perfect us our hearts
[46:21] have believed all the word of the Lord
[46:22] and that's the kind of the question but
[46:23] I want to see I want to tell you what
[46:25] brother brandham has says uh uh and this
[46:27] is just accordance to the gift of
[46:28] Prophecy in the church and this is his
[46:30] church he says and this is what he's
[46:32] referencing he says I think our brother
[46:33] Higgin Boo Here everywhere he's at he's
[46:37] got a gift of speaking in tongues and we
[46:40] got our we got our brother Junior
[46:41] Jackson with us and he speaks with
[46:43] tongues and then we got two or three of
[46:45] them interprets brother Neville here
[46:48] also our pastor speaks with tongues and
[46:50] sometimes prophesies and the Lord brings
[46:53] upon him just the other day he said
[46:56] something he called he called upon a
[46:58] phone in the house where I was at that
[47:00] he prophesied over a person told them
[47:02] that a drunken man would there will be a
[47:04] great change in him right away or
[47:06] something like that and the man had come
[47:08] out of Alcohol Anonymous which is a
[47:11] group that tries to help people to
[47:12] recover from becoming alcoholics and he
[47:15] the brother Brandon said he came out of
[47:16] Alcohol Anonymous still an alcoholic but
[47:19] after he received that um prophecy and
[47:21] it says and for 68 days hasn't even
[47:24] touched alcohol or no medicine for it or
[47:27] anything that was brother Neville
[47:29] prophesying over him so you see how the
[47:33] gifts work with the Prophet The Prophet
[47:35] didn't have to question that like oh
[47:36] that that sounds kind of iffy no he
[47:38] recognized that okay this is a gift of
[47:40] Prophecy working in an individual and
[47:43] you know he prophesies that thing came
[47:44] to pass it lines up with the word and
[47:47] it's and I like this because this was in
[47:49] brother brandom's church and brother
[47:51] Brandon was able to identify who had the
[47:54] gift of Prophecy and if brother Brandon
[47:56] was able to do it we should be able to
[47:59] do it God we should be able to identify
[48:01] who has the gift of Prophecy in the
[48:02] church we should be able to identify who
[48:04] has a gift of speaking in tongues and
[48:06] the gift of healing and the gift of
[48:07] knowledge we should be able to identify
[48:09] those things and I mean brother brandom
[48:11] just said it like it was something that
[48:13] was I mean I want to say common but
[48:15] normal it wasn't like you were trying to
[48:17] achieve it it was just hey this is
[48:19] what's in our church right now right
[48:22] right
[48:23] amen all right so now we want to move on
[48:26] and I know I don't have a lot of time
[48:28] left um but we want to move on to this
[48:32] uh this gift of discerning Spirits uh
[48:35] and uh this is a this is a very this is
[48:39] a very important one um so it says here
[48:42] in uh 1 Corinthians uh I'm just going to
[48:45] read it
[48:46] um it says to another Discerning of
[48:50] spirits right so Discerning of spirits
[48:53] uh and what that means is it's letting
[48:55] you know uh what Spirit you're dealing
[48:58] with when you're uh when you're
[49:00] encountering a person or you're en
[49:01] countering a situation it lets you know
[49:03] the spirit of the person that you're
[49:05] dealing with and there's an emphasis on
[49:07] the word spirit so it's not a gift of
[49:09] gossip and assumption you're not
[49:11] assuming that somebody is doing wrong or
[49:13] you're not assuming that someone is uh
[49:16] uh uh has done something wrong or
[49:18] someone is living life or not a life
[49:20] right just because you don't like
[49:21] someone you know or that doesn't mean
[49:23] that you can just go around and just
[49:25] speak bad about them right you know you
[49:27] know you'll have you'll have you'll have
[49:28] people in the church you know they'll
[49:30] see someone that's in church go out
[49:32] maybe on a Thursday they driving behind
[49:35] a grocery store or whatever and they see
[49:36] him smoking a cigarette and all they
[49:38] like I always knew you was a demon you
[49:40] know I always knew you wasn't safe I I
[49:42] just I just had a feeling and just knew
[49:44] that that's not what a gift of
[49:46] discernment is right that's not what a
[49:47] GI that that actually shows you have the
[49:49] wrong spirit cuz the the prophet said
[49:51] when you see someone in the church uh
[49:54] going or dealing with something you go
[49:56] and you pray for them right you go and
[49:58] you pray for them because you don't know
[49:59] what challenge or what trial or what
[50:01] thing that they're dealing with right so
[50:03] that's that's not a gift discernment a
[50:05] gift discernment doesn't judge by the
[50:06] flesh it judg by the spirit so we're
[50:09] going to turn to um well we're going to
[50:12] pull up the message discernment of
[50:13] spirit preached in 60 and we're going to
[50:16] read from uh paragraph uh
[50:19] 11 let me pull it
[50:24] up all right so this is what the prophet
[50:26] said it says now we now we do have and I
[50:30] think it's a good thing for us as
[50:32] ministers to follow our order when we
[50:34] see such things in the world as we see
[50:35] today and we have order from God is for
[50:38] the Discerning of spirits trying the
[50:41] spirit you're not you're not you're not
[50:42] even looking at the person when you're
[50:44] trying the spirit or when you're
[50:45] Discerning the spirit you shouldn't even
[50:46] be looking at the person you shouldn't
[50:48] be looking at their their uh uh their
[50:50] personality their skin color what
[50:52] clothes they got on you're just looking
[50:54] at what spirit is in them driving them
[50:56] to do whatever they whatever they're
[50:57] doing says I believe that is a very
[50:59] great lesson for the church today is to
[51:01] try the spirit of anything have
[51:02] discernment of the spirit I do not think
[51:04] that we should ever by any means ever
[51:06] try to judge a person by the
[51:08] denomination they belong to or by the
[51:10] group that they are assembled with
[51:11] whether they are methodists Baptist
[51:13] Presbyterian Pentecostal or or whatever
[51:15] they are we should never judge The Man
[51:17] by the denomination that he belongs to
[51:19] we should always judge him by the spirit
[51:20] that he has the spirit whether he's
[51:22] latter re or former Reign or inner outer
[51:24] Reign or no r or what whatever it might
[51:27] be we should never judge him by that but
[51:29] by his Spirit we are to discern Spirits
[51:32] watch the man watch what the man has in
[51:34] has in his mind what he has what he's
[51:35] trying to achieve if the man has uh if a
[51:38] man buy a gift no matter how great the
[51:40] gift is so and that kind of goes back to
[51:43] you know when you're wa when you're when
[51:44] you're looking at these gifts of
[51:46] Prophecy that are that will operate in
[51:47] the church and the gift of healing you
[51:49] always kind of want to discern the life
[51:51] of behind it and you're not actually
[51:53] looking at the gift being performed
[51:55] right because that'll take you off of
[51:56] the word if you're only focusing on the
[51:58] gift amen right so discernment can show
[52:01] you how uh discernment uh one way
[52:03] discernment is is used is to uh to tell
[52:06] how something will stand the test of
[52:09] things right so you're not a minister
[52:12] because you decide you want to be a
[52:14] minister amen right amen God has looked
[52:18] in you before you even knew what um in
[52:21] the beginning the word was with God
[52:23] before you even looked in the Bible God
[52:25] looked in your spirit and saw how well
[52:28] you would stand the test right and be
[52:30] able to speak the word God saw that in
[52:32] you right and when you're choosing some
[52:34] to marry right it's uh um God knows how
[52:38] you would how that relationship would
[52:39] work out amen right the church that you
[52:42] choose to go to God knows right how how
[52:44] you would act with inside of that church
[52:46] because every church has its good things
[52:49] that's right every church has his
[52:51] problems and God knows how you would act
[52:53] during those bad times and if it would
[52:55] bring a disc to the church or not
[52:57] bringing disgrace to the church right so
[53:00] God so discernment is used to tell how
[53:02] things would test stand a test of time
[53:04] we can see that in the choosing of King
[53:07] David right Samuel didn't use
[53:09] discernment when he was choosing the
[53:11] king he looked at all the the tall
[53:14] Brothers the strong ones and said man
[53:16] this got this one's got to be the king
[53:17] you know God said nope he said well okay
[53:20] and he told the next one to come out big
[53:22] old muscles biceps just popping out the
[53:25] shirt was like this got to be the king
[53:28] he look like he can throw down and just
[53:29] tear somebody up God said nope and
[53:32] Samuel was like what in the world like
[53:34] okay and he just went down the line went
[53:36] down the line and S said is there
[53:38] anybody else that you got exactly right
[53:41] and yeah we got this little radio fell
[53:44] out there but he ain't no King trust me
[53:47] he's not no King Samuel said look God
[53:49] told me to come here and pick a king I
[53:52] need to see him and so they said all
[53:53] right David come in here and here come
[53:55] David I mean just a skinny little wimpy
[53:58] guy you would have never thought nothing
[54:00] of him just come here hey what's going
[54:02] on Dad and they just looked at him and
[54:03] Samuel was like okay well just pour the
[54:06] oil poured it over and the oil just
[54:08] spilled and poured over it was God's
[54:10] discernment God saw David's heart God
[54:14] knew that when God would put David into
[54:16] a test that he wouldn't crack under the
[54:18] pressure God knew he would stand on the
[54:21] word right and so that's why when you're
[54:24] going through your test and battles you
[54:25] don't even pick your test and battles
[54:27] that you go through God allows those
[54:29] battles to come to you don't never try
[54:32] to put yourself in in a position where
[54:34] you're trying to fight a battle that God
[54:36] has not called you to God knows you'll
[54:38] break under it God knows exactly what
[54:40] tests what trials God knows your limit
[54:43] the Bible says he'll never give you more
[54:45] than you can handle so when you put
[54:47] yourself in a position where you cannot
[54:49] handle it God has already discerned you
[54:52] from the beginning if you would be able
[54:53] to handle this thing or not handle this
[54:55] thing right amen
[54:57] right God already saw that his brothers
[55:00] wouldn't be able to stand up to Goliath
[55:02] and so we're going to read 1 Samuel's
[55:04] 21- 29 just to kind of go through that a
[55:07] little bit
[55:10] um just the story of David right here
[55:13] just to show you just to show how God
[55:15] could discern that this could be my king
[55:18] so I'll just start reading it says verse
[55:20] 21 it says for Israel and the
[55:22] Philistines had had put the battle in
[55:24] Array Army against Army and David left
[55:27] his carriage in the hand of The Keeper
[55:29] of the carriage and ran into the army
[55:30] and came and saluted his uh Brethren and
[55:34] as he talked with them behold there came
[55:36] up the champion the Philistine of gath
[55:38] Goliath by name out of the armies of the
[55:40] Philistines and spake unto the same
[55:41] words and David heard him and this is
[55:44] why God could could discern and knew
[55:47] that David was the one because David now
[55:49] hears these words of what he's saying in
[55:50] verse 24 it says and all the men of
[55:53] Israel when they saw the man fled from
[55:55] him and were sore afraid that included
[55:57] David's Brothers as we're going to see
[55:59] and the men of Israel said have you seen
[56:01] this man have you seen this man that
[56:04] that is come up surely to defy Israel is
[56:07] he come up and it shall be that the man
[56:09] who kth him the king will enrich him
[56:11] with great riches and will give him his
[56:12] daughters and make his father's house
[56:15] free of Israel and and it just goes to
[56:18] show you that
[56:20] incentives won't still don't make you
[56:22] good for the job wow so a lot of times
[56:24] people will try to pick a job
[56:27] like oh I want to be a lawyer you know
[56:29] they make like
[56:31] $2,000 2,000 uh $200,000 I see him with
[56:34] a Ferrari man I see him with a a two a
[56:37] three story house man that is just you
[56:40] know he gets to work whenever he wants
[56:41] to work and then they'll pick that job
[56:43] and then when they get in the job and
[56:45] they're dealing with the stress and
[56:47] they're dealing with the problems and
[56:48] it's daily day all of a sudden you know
[56:50] I don't want to do this anymore right
[56:52] you have to be built for a particular
[56:54] job pray and ask God for the job he
[56:57] gives you he knows what you can handle
[56:59] he knows what you can't handle he knows
[57:01] how smart You' be able to handle things
[57:03] or not so and and and it's not going to
[57:05] put you in a position where you're you
[57:07] feel like you're being crushed all the
[57:09] time right and so 20 verse 26 says and
[57:12] David spake to the men that stood by him
[57:13] saying what shall be done to the man
[57:16] that kth um the Philistine and taketh
[57:19] away the approach from Israel for who is
[57:20] this uncircumcised Philistine that he
[57:22] should defile the armies of the Living
[57:24] God and I like that in David because he
[57:26] didn't care about the riches he didn't
[57:27] care about the daughter all he cared
[57:29] about was I see this guy that is mocking
[57:32] God and ain't nobody doing nothing about
[57:34] it right in his heart he was just wanted
[57:37] to do a good job he didn't have to be
[57:39] incentivized to do a good job right and
[57:42] the people answered after this manner
[57:44] saying so shall it be done with the man
[57:46] that kth him and eliab his eldest
[57:48] brother the one that was rejected the
[57:51] one that uh when when the prophet came
[57:53] up and uh said this one has got be the
[57:56] one and God said nope not him well why
[57:59] did he reject him cuz CU a lot of times
[58:01] the spirit of discernment you have to
[58:03] understand we're going to get to that
[58:03] later the the spirit of discernment is
[58:06] not to hurt your feelings oh my it's not
[58:08] it's not aimed at your flesh but it's
[58:10] looking at the spirit is looking at the
[58:12] Spirit of the thing right and elab his
[58:15] oldest brother heard when he spake unto
[58:17] the men and elb's anger was kindled
[58:19] against David and he said why comest
[58:21] thou why comest thou down hither and
[58:23] with whom with with whom hast thou left
[58:26] thou few sheep in the wilderness I Know
[58:28] Thy pride and the Ness of thy heart for
[58:30] thou art come down that thou mightest
[58:33] see the battle so here we have Eli that
[58:37] was also afraid to fight and God could
[58:40] discern that when he told Samuel no this
[58:44] one isn't the one because he been saw
[58:47] that when Goliath would come out there
[58:49] he'd be hiding in the bush right but
[58:51] when he saw David he said oh no no no
[58:53] this is the one this is the one when he
[58:54] runs toward goli he ain't going to
[58:56] hesitate and say well maybe I can do it
[58:58] or not now he ran right forward right uh
[59:01] to overcome so God used that spirit of
[59:04] discernment uh to uh to show him to God
[59:07] can use a spirit of discernment to show
[59:08] who is uh good for a job and who is not
[59:11] good for a job not only that spirit and
[59:14] we're uh in closing in a little bit uh
[59:16] not only can the spirit tell you how
[59:18] something will stand the test of time
[59:20] but the serment can tell you why people
[59:23] deal with the troubles that they have
[59:25] and the prophet had the spirit of
[59:26] discernment cuz you will come to the
[59:28] prophet with a problem you say hey I'm
[59:29] dealing with this this this this and
[59:30] that and this is that help me out right
[59:33] but then the prophet using the spirit of
[59:34] discernment was say hold on a second
[59:36] that's not the whole picture you got
[59:37] some other things that you're dealing
[59:39] with as well and this is what's causing
[59:41] issue so the spirit of discernment
[59:42] doesn't just agree with things that face
[59:44] value it looks at the spirit amen and
[59:47] you can take an example of you know
[59:50] either a um like a girl or a boy or a
[59:53] girl trying to a girl that's getting
[59:56] getting that's constantly in like she's
[59:58] always complaining about being in wrong
[1:00:00] relationships like man I'm always
[1:00:02] getting the wrong guy I'm always getting
[1:00:04] the wrong guy Lord no matter what and
[1:00:06] she could be in her heart honest trying
[1:00:08] to get a good relationship and if you
[1:00:10] take a man uh that knows the word uh and
[1:00:13] the spirit of discernment he can look at
[1:00:15] what she's wearing and be able to
[1:00:17] discern why you are getting the wrong
[1:00:19] people that's right that's right why
[1:00:21] you're getting the wrong people because
[1:00:23] of what you're wearing and what you're
[1:00:24] attracting mhm cuz the prophet said that
[1:00:27] a man filled with the Holy Ghost which
[1:00:28] is the guy that you want when he sees
[1:00:30] someone dressed like that the Holy Ghost
[1:00:32] causes him to turn his head that's right
[1:00:34] so he can't even look at you amen he
[1:00:37] can't even look for you right so that
[1:00:39] spirit of discernment and it's when you
[1:00:41] say that to somebody it's not to hurt
[1:00:43] your feelings right they're not looking
[1:00:45] at your feelings they're looking at the
[1:00:47] Spirit that's causing you to to dress or
[1:00:50] act a certain way saying hey if you get
[1:00:51] rid of that Spirit things would be
[1:00:53] better for you amen right
[1:00:57] um and so we we also know um the spirit
[1:00:59] of discernment can be used to also tell
[1:01:03] uh the intentions uh the heart this is
[1:01:05] the last thing we'll talk about um you
[1:01:07] know the prophet there was a story in
[1:01:08] the Bible there was a well there was an
[1:01:10] incident where the Prophet had went to a
[1:01:12] church and he saw uh in the church the
[1:01:15] gifts were coming down and people were
[1:01:17] speaking in tongues and people were
[1:01:19] interpreting tongues and after the
[1:01:21] service he went and went and talked to
[1:01:23] these people that had these gifts and as
[1:01:25] he was talking to the one guy he said I
[1:01:27] was trying to catch a spirit like the
[1:01:28] woman at the well he said wow this guy
[1:01:31] is a Bonafide Christian right he's a
[1:01:33] Christian through and through and then
[1:01:35] he went and talked to the other man and
[1:01:38] as he talked to the other man he
[1:01:39] realized oh hold on a second and the
[1:01:42] thing about it is he described the uh
[1:01:45] that I think he said that is his wife
[1:01:47] had black hair and the woman that he was
[1:01:49] cheating on had belond here right so
[1:01:52] that spirit of discernment came down
[1:01:54] there and kind of uh uh showed the
[1:01:57] intentions or this the uh the seed
[1:02:00] behind what was in the per person just
[1:02:02] as Jesus could uh look at the Pharisees
[1:02:05] and Sadducees and say hey you're of your
[1:02:06] father right because he was able to
[1:02:08] discern that thing and so you have to be
[1:02:11] careful with this the spirit of
[1:02:12] discernment because the spirit the
[1:02:14] spirit of discernment is to edify the
[1:02:15] church it's not to pick on you it's not
[1:02:18] to uh to uh talk down on you or say that
[1:02:20] you're a bad person it's looking at your
[1:02:22] spirit and so if you if one of you in
[1:02:25] here has a spirit of discernment you
[1:02:27] awful you have to be very spiritual
[1:02:28] about it right because you can't just
[1:02:31] look at stuff at face value because when
[1:02:33] Paul or I'll say Saul when God had
[1:02:36] selected Saul to be his end time
[1:02:39] messenger and now God went over to these
[1:02:42] Believers that were filled with the Holy
[1:02:43] Ghost they said hey hey Saul I'm sending
[1:02:46] Saul your way I want you to baptize him
[1:02:47] he's going to be filled with the Holy
[1:02:48] Ghost he's going to do a work for me
[1:02:49] they were like hold on a second I know
[1:02:51] you're not talking about this guy this
[1:02:53] guy Saul right they were trying to look
[1:02:56] at the man's fruit all right they were
[1:02:59] trying to look at the man's fruit and
[1:03:00] say no no no this guy over here Hees he
[1:03:02] just persecutes Christians he does this
[1:03:03] he does that he does this so you have to
[1:03:05] be careful with the spirit of
[1:03:06] discernment because the spirit of
[1:03:08] discernment looks at the at the uh at
[1:03:11] the Spirit of it of what is and I
[1:03:13] remember brother Jerry had um preached
[1:03:15] he preached about this before where he
[1:03:17] says that fruits are good and you look
[1:03:19] at fruits but what somebody is is the
[1:03:22] seed that's inside of him and a seed is
[1:03:25] a potential the seed isn't fruit yet but
[1:03:28] is a potential and so that's why you
[1:03:30] have to use a spirit of discernment to
[1:03:32] see the actual seed inside the person
[1:03:35] God saw that Paul would believe the word
[1:03:39] 100% the word even though he was not
[1:03:41] bearing fruits there and that's why we
[1:03:43] need to be filled with the Baptist and
[1:03:45] the Holy Spirit brother brand I mean
[1:03:46] brother Jack had talked about that how
[1:03:47] the Holy Spirit comes for you to bear
[1:03:51] fruit without the Holy Spirit yeah
[1:03:53] you're a seed of God but you ain't
[1:03:54] bearing any fruit right but with the
[1:03:56] Holy Spirit Will comeing and the bare
[1:03:57] fruit so the spirit of discernment in
[1:03:59] the church to help us to discern Spirits
[1:04:02] uh and this gift has to be really relied
[1:04:05] upon when you begin to see prophecies
[1:04:09] coming forth and you got ministers uh
[1:04:11] preaching the word to make sure that
[1:04:13] everything all the motives and things
[1:04:15] are lined up so that the church doesn't
[1:04:17] get in uh disarray so if you have a dis
[1:04:20] Spirit if you do have the spirit of
[1:04:21] discernment you have to say something if
[1:04:24] you notice something that is going on
[1:04:26] because a lot of times the problem is if
[1:04:28] you don't have the spirit of discernment
[1:04:29] you just get involved in the thing
[1:04:31] because you don't know what's going on
[1:04:33] if you have the spirit of discernment
[1:04:34] and you see something going on and
[1:04:36] you're worried about something and you
[1:04:37] prayed about it you have to say
[1:04:39] something if you don't say anything it
[1:04:41] can be of detriment amen all right so
[1:04:44] we're going to say a prayer just uh in
[1:04:47] this
[1:04:48] service Lord God lord your word has come
[1:04:51] forth full Lord God lord we know that
[1:04:55] these gifts that you have given oh Lord
[1:04:57] God are still in the church today we
[1:04:59] know that Lord God that your word is
[1:05:02] true oh Lord Jesus Christ and we're
[1:05:04] gathered here not of our own accord oh
[1:05:05] Lord Jesus Christ but according to your
[1:05:07] leading and to your Gathering and to
[1:05:09] your choosing oh lord your forn
[1:05:11] knowledge oh Lord God saw us here oh
[1:05:13] Lord God and you saw us here with a
[1:05:15] purpose oh Lord God a lot of people have
[1:05:18] things that they're struggling with oh
[1:05:20] Lord God a lot of people have needs in
[1:05:22] their heart they have sickness oh lord
[1:05:23] lord they've been dealing with sickness
[1:05:25] for days and days and days and they've
[1:05:27] been struggling but yet they still been
[1:05:29] holding on to your word Lord Jesus
[1:05:31] Christ Lord you place these gifts in the
[1:05:34] church oh Lord God to be able to speak a
[1:05:36] word over someone's life oh Lord God to
[1:05:39] end the suffering oh Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:41] Lord your children oh Lord God they're
[1:05:43] holding on oh Lord Jesus Christ they're
[1:05:45] holding on to your word and they're
[1:05:46] praising you through the hard times but
[1:05:48] Lord help us oh Lord God to identify the
[1:05:50] gifts oh Lord God Lord give give the
[1:05:53] people the spiritual knowledge oh Lord
[1:05:55] God God to know what they have oh Lord
[1:05:57] Jesus Christ that we can identify what
[1:05:59] his gifts are oh Lord God and that the
[1:06:01] church can be a healthy Church oh Lord
[1:06:03] God the health of the church is
[1:06:04] dependent upon the gifts not just the
[1:06:07] gifts but the gifts used in order and in
[1:06:10] the correct way oh Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:12] that is what sustains and keeps the
[1:06:14] church healthy oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord
[1:06:16] give us discernment oh Lord God give us
[1:06:18] the ability to recognize the gifts and
[1:06:20] to receive them oh Lord God in the
[1:06:22] precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[1:06:25] [Applause]
[1:06:35] God bless
[1:06:37] you praise the
[1:06:42] Lord amen we thank the
[1:06:44] Lord uh for the word of God tonight
[1:06:48] thought brother Quenton did an excellent
[1:06:50] job amen with uh just talking about this
[1:06:55] this Spirit of
[1:06:56] Prophecy and um you know there's um he
[1:07:01] he a really really good point that no
[1:07:04] and and and I think it goes back to a
[1:07:06] scripture in the book of
[1:07:08] um um
[1:07:10] Proverbs I think we uh we always kind of
[1:07:13] apply the scripture to just people
[1:07:16] preaching but it's a scripture that
[1:07:18] actually applies to every gift because
[1:07:22] the scripture says a man's gift
[1:07:26] will make room for
[1:07:29] itself and um uh whether God has given
[1:07:32] you a gift of of Prophecy a gift of uh
[1:07:35] tongues interpretation of tongues uh
[1:07:39] whatever and and and and just like a
[1:07:41] prophet is born that way I believe God
[1:07:42] gives people you know gifts at Birth
[1:07:44] they come without
[1:07:46] repentance uh but um you never have to
[1:07:49] push your gift and and and I love how he
[1:07:53] brought in the the the scripture of
[1:07:55] daythan and cor they were gifted people
[1:07:58] but they were not uh concerned about
[1:08:01] breaking up a
[1:08:03] church I mean um and I'm going just be
[1:08:07] honest with you if you see a gift like
[1:08:09] that come run if you get a person that
[1:08:13] will come in with a gift and you know
[1:08:15] they gift it but they're not concerned
[1:08:16] with breaking up a church and because if
[1:08:19] the if the if the all uh the motive is
[1:08:22] if the objective is I'm going try to
[1:08:24] start my own own thing right but I got
[1:08:27] to break this up in order to start my
[1:08:28] own thing something wrong somewhere with
[1:08:31] that I'm just I'm just being honest with
[1:08:33] you uh I I can tell you this much when
[1:08:36] spirit and Truth started it wasn't us
[1:08:38] breaking up nobody other
[1:08:40] church we didn't do that to get started
[1:08:43] here spirit and Truth Tabernacle and and
[1:08:45] and most of the people uh all you know
[1:08:48] most of your Saints especially some of
[1:08:49] the original Saints y'all know I didn't
[1:08:51] do no pulling on nobody I didn't do that
[1:08:55] God had to lead people you know to this
[1:08:57] church and when God LED them they knew
[1:08:59] where they were supposed to be and God
[1:09:01] is proven himself to them right but uh
[1:09:03] but I'm telling you the truth we we we
[1:09:06] we you never want to be found guilty of
[1:09:09] um taking your gift to use it to
[1:09:13] divide I'm going tell you where that
[1:09:15] gift come
[1:09:16] from it come from hell right and and
[1:09:20] Satan was a was a gifted
[1:09:23] individual was he not was Satan was very
[1:09:26] gifted in the music
[1:09:28] program I think he was probably
[1:09:30] directing the
[1:09:31] choir amen they were having nights of
[1:09:34] worship hello
[1:09:37] somebody right and he had them just
[1:09:39] going and and and next thing you know he
[1:09:41] just got tired of them giving all the
[1:09:43] glory to God and he wanted some of that
[1:09:45] praise himself right and and often times
[1:09:48] what happen if you get too gifted you oh
[1:09:51] Lord have mercy Jesus help me God you
[1:09:53] want your name called from the pull pit
[1:09:55] all the time we want to thank God for
[1:09:58] sister so and so being in our midst and
[1:10:01] God has gifted her and go ahead and do
[1:10:03] what you
[1:10:06] do you got to watch things like that I'm
[1:10:10] telling you the truth but but if if if
[1:10:12] you don't have any any um um feeling for
[1:10:17] people and and wantan to see people stay
[1:10:20] together and and all that something's
[1:10:21] wrong with your gift and anytime a
[1:10:24] church is built like
[1:10:26] that like daythan and Cory did it don't
[1:10:30] last it don't last another thing about
[1:10:33] you know he talked about the the spirit
[1:10:35] of Prophecy versus being a prophet
[1:10:37] brother Brandon was born a prophet if
[1:10:40] somebody has the spirit of prophecy on
[1:10:43] them now there's another quote brother
[1:10:44] random say that Spirit of Prophecy can
[1:10:46] go from one person to the next person
[1:10:47] inside the church but if you get a
[1:10:49] person with the spirit of prophecy on
[1:10:51] them and maybe something they say come
[1:10:54] to pass and maybe another thing they say
[1:10:55] come to pass and maybe another thing
[1:10:57] they say come to pass but if they come
[1:10:59] to the point where they're trying to
[1:11:00] replace brother
[1:11:02] brandom y'all just run away from that
[1:11:05] because we got to know that this is a
[1:11:07] body work we all have to work together
[1:11:10] and brother brother random had a very
[1:11:11] specific purpose and each one of us have
[1:11:13] a very specific purpose but we work
[1:11:15] together for the kingdom of God so
[1:11:17] anybody trying to say well you know I
[1:11:19] got something that the Lord showed me
[1:11:20] that no no no God ain't show you nothing
[1:11:22] remember remember the scripture
[1:11:25] Revelation 10:7 that all the Mysteries
[1:11:28] will be reveal to the seventh angel now
[1:11:32] where you fit in
[1:11:34] there amen where you fit in there cuz we
[1:11:37] know who the seventh angel was and and
[1:11:39] and and ain't no you you cannot tell me
[1:11:42] that there were some Mysteries left that
[1:11:43] were not uh taken care of otherwise the
[1:11:45] word of God is broken right there so
[1:11:48] we're not looking for anybody to come
[1:11:50] with anything else and I'm going to tell
[1:11:52] you another thing I'm going to just be
[1:11:53] honest with you if you prophesying about
[1:11:55] the coming of the Lord is supposed to
[1:11:57] happen at a certain time and it ain't
[1:11:59] happened at the time that you said it's
[1:12:00] was going to happen we cannot hear your
[1:12:04] prophecies amen amen amen we can't do it
[1:12:08] right because this thing has got to hit
[1:12:10] every time we don't want to play games
[1:12:11] in this area we want to be real with God
[1:12:15] we want to be I believe this has been
[1:12:16] restored back to the church and I
[1:12:17] believe this is a season for it to go
[1:12:19] forth but it must be done correctly I
[1:12:22] I've been thinking and you know just
[1:12:24] processing this will restore say the
[1:12:26] Lord and and and and I just I just keep
[1:12:29] thinking in my mind the

[1:15:55] brother Mike walls there in Virginia
[1:15:57] it's a church that brother brother
[1:15:59] Quinton used to attend and uh and our
[1:16:01] first time there and uh I tell you the
[1:16:04] truth we had a wonderful wonderful uh uh
[1:16:08] time you know there in service and we
[1:16:11] just thank God for just taking us there
[1:16:13] bringing us back safely and just you
[1:16:14] know meeting um you know just just
[1:16:17] meeting us in a special way I and if you
[1:16:20] know we get a chance to go back again
[1:16:22] that is one church I would love to take
[1:16:25] uh some of our Saints too I think y'all
[1:16:26] would really really enjoy yourself it
[1:16:28] was just a real good atmosphere uh the
[1:16:31] Lord has just blessed them with a new
[1:16:32] building they've been ministering there
[1:16:34] in that area for 32 years and uh and
[1:16:37] just been going from place to place the
[1:16:39] pastor showed us some of the places that
[1:16:41] they had worshiped in and one specific
[1:16:43] place they had was a a church uh a sday
[1:16:47] Adventist Church that they were
[1:16:48] worshiping in and recently uh I want to
[1:16:51] say within the past two years a new
[1:16:53] pastor came into that church and told
[1:16:55] them uh y'all too big to be here and we
[1:16:59] don't want y'all here no more y'all got
[1:17:01] to find somewhere else to go and um and
[1:17:04] even the pastor told him said we we need
[1:17:06] we need a group that we can control and
[1:17:08] we can't control y'all all right so they
[1:17:11] they kicked them out to church and they
[1:17:13] ended up going to a school and uh
[1:17:16] worshiping and then um the Lord just
[1:17:18] provided a place for them uh to purchase
[1:17:21] and you know they they went in they saw
[1:17:23] this place it was a church church that
[1:17:25] had um in like a warehouse a warehouse
[1:17:28] district and uh a Pentecostal group had
[1:17:31] the church and they had they got down
[1:17:33] about eight members and this place could
[1:17:35] seat maybe about 250 people and they got
[1:17:38] down about eight members and they said
[1:17:40] you know we just need to sell this cuz
[1:17:41] you know this nothing really happening
[1:17:44] so um I think the the church showed up
[1:17:47] on the market it was on the market for
[1:17:49] about 2 hours they went they saw it and
[1:17:53] then they said we want to come back
[1:17:54] tomorrow when it came back there was
[1:17:55] like two other groups wanted to come see
[1:17:57] it and one group was
[1:18:00] um a Muslim and um so you know they they
[1:18:06] put in the offer then the Muslims put in
[1:18:08] a higher offer then they put in an offer
[1:18:11] then the Muslims put in a higher offer
[1:18:13] and they were just and they got to the
[1:18:15] point where they got they could not
[1:18:16] offer any more than what they could so
[1:18:20] they felt led to write a letter to the
[1:18:21] pastor of the church and say look we've
[1:18:23] been 32 years in Ministry just waiting
[1:18:25] on the Lord to open up a door for us and
[1:18:27] we we we we really feel like we found a
[1:18:30] place but we just cannot uh compete with
[1:18:33] the the offers that keep going this is
[1:18:35] much as we can give and we just pray
[1:18:37] y'all consider it said when they wrote
[1:18:39] the letter that touched the people's
[1:18:41] heart and they said we don't we're not
[1:18:43] going to take the higher offer we're
[1:18:45] going to give it to y'all because we
[1:18:46] want a church to have this not turn it
[1:18:48] into a mosque right so the Lord blessed
[1:18:51] them with this building and I tell you
[1:18:53] it is so nice uh I said I'm leaving here
[1:18:58] encourag um and I feel like amen just
[1:19:02] letting the devil know we
[1:19:04] next we next so we we thank God for amen
[1:19:08] what the Lord has done for them amen we
[1:19:10] got a a hand up here anybody else need
[1:19:13] to okay all right we'll get around we
[1:19:15] got a couple hands all right praise the

[1:19:34] fruit trees but in the next door's
[1:19:37] neighbor it flipped their whole trailer
[1:19:39] over turned it into the canal ripped
[1:19:42] their whole water system out and then
[1:19:44] the person behind us um other the person
[1:19:46] behind them ripped some of the roof off
[1:19:48] and as you go to the neighborhood uh Big
[1:19:51] Trees were uprooted but in our little
[1:19:53] place that we live at that's the only
