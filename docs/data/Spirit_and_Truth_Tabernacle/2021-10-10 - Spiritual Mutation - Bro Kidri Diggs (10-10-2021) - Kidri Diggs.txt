hallelujah amen well we are certainly happy to be in the house of god man on this morning thank god for his his presence that is that is here amen and uh we're so glad that uh brother diggs has come to be with us this weekend uh he uh last night just did a wonderful job on teaching on cast down fear cast it down right fear something that is not from god something that satan amen brings upon us so anytime we we feel that spirit we got to cast it down no matter what we're going through in life amen but uh uh brother diggs has just been a dear friend for a number of years and when we were first starting out the ministry amen he was one of the first preachers to come to us there when we were in green acres and you know and and just kind of been with us through every season uh just just been a mainstay you know kind of in our life and and as we're in this season he's the first minister to pass through amen at this time and and he was here last night when we were just kind of stuck outside the gate couldn't get inside and nobody was here to unlock the door some kind of way to the uh the custodians thought that we were going to be here at seven o'clock in the morning rather than 7 00 pm they came at 7 00 a.m to open the open the gates and so we start calling around and like oh we thought 7 a.m like uh i don't know how y'all got that wrong but it happened i said lord we need our own keys not to this school but to our own building [Applause] but you know you learned just to just to thank god my wife was telling me so you know um we'll take this because you know when we were we had it in green acres we was next door to a bar and and man they were just good god you trying to have church they just got the music blasting through the wall and uh you know we couldn't we couldn't get them to turn the music down so i walked over and tried to talk with him me and my father and they said no no no don't just leave us alone we not messing with you you don't mess with us i say okay so as i was walking out the the the building amen they had a mat on the floor and just inspiration struck me and i just wiped my foot on the mat did like that and walked out the door and i didn't know my daddy saw what i did he didn't know why i did it so he walked out the door can you can you imagine the power that's in this never even said a word i just [Music] and walked out the door because you know the bible tells us that if people won't receive you just wipe your feet that's all the bible right just wipe your feet you'll need a gun you'll need nothing no knife or nothing just wipe your feet and we wiped our feet and within one week that place was shut down shut down so what we learned is that let god fight the battle [Music] and i believe the songwriter said he never lost a battle and he never will ah yes [Applause] glory hallelujah my god [Applause] yes yes [Music] i'm a witness that he never lost the battle amen but but we you know we remember times like that and god just give us testimonies all along the way so even during this season we're gonna have a testimony you know and uh you know i know that there's many that's watching and waiting for god just to do the next next thing that he's gonna do for us because this is just a temporary stop we we're passing through we passing through amen and all we're going to do is just wait on god we're going to be patient while we wait on god amen man some people don't like to help push the wagon up the hill but they show like jumping on when it's coming downhill you know what we're we gonna do we're gonna let you ride [Music] amen amen i'm not gonna sing it sis i appreciate it he can do all things but fail he never lost the battle before brother diggs come i wanted to uh have his daughter kierra come and she's going to sing a man for us on today and amen and she was she was baby girl uh we just remember all the years when she i mean uh when she when mama was carrying us she was born and just running all around the church and you know we remember all that and now she's a young lady and man 15 years old and and now she running with daddy amen running with daddy and i think i just think it's something special about that you know i just like that i like that you know and i mean last week they was in ohio this weekend and in florida and like my god see we were we were there we were there we were there we we we uh as a group of people we knew that the lord had opened up this door for brother diggs to go full time in ministry it came here blind preaching while he was blind trying to preach the only time his eyes would open is when he opened up the scripture and read and then he would you know start preaching and then as soon as he say amen and close it says closing prey go back and his eyes are blind and i remember them that he was preaching there in okeechobee i was just so touched by it and then brother smiley just didn't give him no break at all they went to golden corral to eat see y'all be y'all be dodging golden corral but miracles happen at golden corral i think brother i thought i think brother brother diggs wanted a bun or something like that brother smile say look if you want some food you have to get up and go get it yourself you put a challenge to him brother did he say oh is that the way it's going to be all right i'mma get up and go get it myself eyes popped open took off getting the food and drove back home with his eyes open and his eyes been open ever since then miracles happened we identified so this this his ministry has been something that has blessed us over the years and man no matter how the devil has has fought amen the devil's still a liar amen and and we we we thank god for the victory god has given him so we're blessed to have amanda's precious daughter sister kierra with us and we want to have her come amen at this time and just give us a song from her heart amen and then after uh she finishes singing the next voice you'll hear will be brother cadre diggs amen god bless you [Applause] exceedingly abundantly above [Music] all you [Music] could think according to the powers that were given [Music] he will do he's gonna fulfill everybody [Music] don't give up on god cause he won't give up on you he's able to [Music] is oh to do just what he said he will do he's gonna fulfill every promise don't give up on god cause he won't

lord and somebody tried it hallelujah she said he's gonna do it if you believe it hallelujah hey man we certainly appreciate all the songs of zion amen god is truly worthy of all the praise amen let's have a word of prayer and we'll get right into the word of god lord jesus father as the song says lord truly you are able and we know that we're in a day where all things are possible lord we pray for lord the true spirit of the holy ghost to be able to press us through every situation every storm lord and lord like the other song saying lord we just want to be ready lord when you come we want to be ready the scripture says and his wife has made herself ready and lord we can see all the turmoil in the land all the different things taking place but father god we pray that you just continue to push us into our position and lord we actually bless this church lord and all the endeavors lord and all the people of god supporting them behind this ministry lord let's know that we all do it for you lord we don't do it as individuals lord but we do it for you lord lord that you might get the glory lord we pray lord that the word preached today lord will find good ground lord and it'll bring forth a hundredfold lord god that this word that we're hearing this eternal word lord is shaping and molding us into the image of your mind and lord we pray for the blessings of the kingdom to be upon us lord move all flesh out of the way forgive us for our sins and trespasses in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen praise the lord i forgot to announce um that you all are going to use the restroom please remember knock before entering even though we have the signs there just please knock before entering okay because the doors do not lock there so please keep that in mind god bless you amen praise the lord um let's um open our bibles to um believe i want first john first john i mean st john first chapter again we thank the lord for brother jack amen and all of you brother smiley all the different brothers and sisters that we've known throughout the years you've all been a blessing to me you know i just love consistency amen first john i mean saint john the first chapter let's start reading that um verse 10. saint john 1 verse 10. have it say amen the bible says he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten father full of glory and i mean full of grace and truth amen let's go to second corinthians chapter three second corinthians chapter three verse 17 now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we are with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord amen may the lord have blessed me with his word you can have your seats this morning hey man i got a topic it may seem a little strange but uh just bear with me hey man my subject this morning is spiritual mutation spiritual mutation you know church uh we have to be able to believe that you know what we see in the flesh is not who we really are that there's more uh how that proper girl there's more that meets the eye you know and you can't judge a book by its cover you got to open the book read it and see what the content is all about you know and a lot of times people read the content but they don't stay with the content you know and that's what's very important about what we consider to be the message of the hour we have to stay with the content because the content is all about making a rapture the content is all about changing us hallelujah that we may be uh uh back into an eternal state to be with the lord so the content is what's very important you know it ain't uh everything on the outside it ain't you know uh the mistakes and all the stuff but it's what was the prophet talking about what was he bringing to the people amen and even so now in our day amen what's the content of the bride of christ you know but when i think about uh what the scripture says he says through all that can receive him he gave us power power to become something amen so this word that we're hearing this word that you're hearing preach this word is changing you amen this word is is is making you become something that the word is producing as you hear it amen so hallelujah if we look at uh the world and we see that the world is constantly changing into something hollywood why because it's the time we're living in but you see the world changing and all these things going on but let's make it clear god don't change god remains the same so church really what god is doing when he says power to become he's bringing us back into our original state not that we've changed we've just forgotten who we are holy see you were always a son of god you were always a daughter of god and what the word comes to do is to open up your understanding to bring you back to you can relate to your real substance amen in church uh power to become something amen you know but first we must understand who god is we must understand what god did for us hallelujah by just becoming god hallelujah you know before i go any further you know i'm going to talk about uh the state of the world today and you know last night we talked about covert a little bit but i want to show how the devil is only a copycat everything he do he's copying off of god he doesn't even have his own thoughts everything about him he says god i saw you do that and i'm going to do it but i'm going to do it in a perverted way he saw truth hallelujah so satan said i'm going to take the truth and make a lie he even saw the body of christ hallelujah and he wanted his own body church remember when he was up in heaven he saw god's glory and satan said i want to be worshiped see everything about him here he's pulling off of what he saw from god and you know we look at the condition of the world with covert 19 and all these diseases and things that are going for church all the enemy is doing is perverting what the truth is really is and you know the reason why i'm kind of starting here because the prophet of god said in the message amen he said that let me say this real quick he said that natural things type out spiritual things hallelujah so you look at the covet and what's going on with the covet mutation church it first started out and they said it was a sickness and everything and you got to take a shot and because the kobe wouldn't let up let me tell you something it didn't get stronger no it didn't get stronger it just continued to move so as they continue to move they say hey you got to take a second vaccination but it still didn't go away see it didn't get stronger what was it doing it was mutating the strands of it hallelujah the genes of it hallelujah it will continue to move into different areas of the body the same sickness holly like i said like the same sickness that started with a cough turned into a fever and from a fever hallelujah started putting water in your lungs and from water in your lungs it started shortening your breath it all started maybe with a cough but did it begin to mutate and as it mutated it looked like it was stronger but let me tell you something it's still just a cough [Applause] but we see satan where does he get mutation from glory church mutation started with god holy he was the first one to change his form holy the prophet of god said in the beginning he wasn't even god he was just eternal amen he was there all by himself there was nothing else he was just eternal but he knew we could never hardly understand who he is as just being eternal so what did he do hallelujah try he began to mutate hallelujah and the prophet of god said hey he was so high he couldn't go no higher so instead of him going higher he mutated down and as he went from eternal hallelujah as he went from eternal hallelujah he began to mutate down then he became elohim wow hallelujah as he was elohim elohim means self-existing but what i want you to understand how satan brought a cold here with the fever and with the fever hallelujah all these other sicknesses when god mutated from eternal to elohim he brought eternity with him wow so as he became self-existent he still was a self-existent eternal one she didn't leave eternity up there but he continued to bring it hardly as he came down because there was no other higher hollywood he could go so he came down but he's trying to get somewhere he's mutating before before i go into that give me that uh explanation about mutation let's look at what mutation really is church earlier mutation occurs when a dna gene is damaged or changed into such a way as to alter the genetic message carried by the gene see so what god is doing as he's mutating he's bringing a message somewhere wow come on somebody now ain't gonna be long but i want you to catch it he's not just changing forms just to show how good he is he's trying to get a message somewhere and as he's changing he's taking the message of eternal the message of hallelujah self-existing and he keeps bringing it down and he wraps all of that up into one message that he's going to express hollywood and as he mutates hardly he says the mutation is an agent this message is working for god [Applause] hallelujah turns it as he as he mutates he comes down holly first was he eternal yeah feli became elohim hardly then he became god when he became god the message went from here eternal self-existent and now it has to be a worship because god is an object of worship but the thing we have to understand about the mutation of god not just worship but from that worship hallelujah god put the spoken word back in the people's mouth so from there as he began to be eternal amen and y'all gonna hear me keep saying this because i want you to understand who your god is holy god don't change holy one thing you're gonna know you're gonna know today by the time we're finished the character richness of god hallelujah so when you get in a tight spot you'll be able to say to that tight spot down though my god is eternal hallelujah hey man and when you get in another tight spot you can tell the devil my god is self-existent i'm not thinking about you he's eternal he's self-existing and then he dropped down to being god amen and as he became god the prophet of god said the logos came out of his mouth so now the eternal self-existent god began to let the logos which was god's creative power coming out of his mouth so did he begin to say let there be hallelujah let there be this and it was let there be that and it was hallelujah church as god began to mutate the stages of god followed him so now he's in a place of mutation see church these things have always been here you know a tadpole mutates to what a frog without that tadpole you'll never get the frog a caterpillar mutates into a what a butterfly without those early stages of calling without those early stages of inching that butterfly would never be able to fly even church hallelujah the mutation of that particular uh species it called for a a cocoon it called for a stage where it looked like a mess it called for a stage to where nobody would know hallelujah what it looked like once it came out of it it would have its own colors it would have its own uh stripes and patterns and everything about his life but nobody knows what it's going to be while it's in the cocoon holy your spiritual mutation will bring you to a cocoon but don't worry there's something that's going to come out of it that's going to allow you to fly in places you've never been in before [Applause] from that stage from the caterpillar to the cocoon hallelujah the butterfly never crawls again is anybody mutating in this place [Applause] he said count it all joy will you fall into diver's temptation why are those trials there god's trying to get you to become something [Applause] he's bringing forth a spiritual mutation he's trying to get you to see the message for your life [Music] hallelujah but look the lord is so special he has a purpose for all of us the prophet god said he would be too mysterious that's just eternal so he wanted to take the mystery away so we can understand who we worship so as he's coming down hallelujah he goes from eternal mutation elohim mutate eternal self-existent hurling mutate one more time god hallelujah and from god he still aim him self-existent and eternal then he mutates with the logos coming out of his mouth but what did he do with that logos hey man now here we go he put that logos in the last mutation that god would ever mutate he put that where in a man [Music] [Applause] come on somebody god didn't stop mutating until he came to you and after he came to you he never changed his form again after god hallelujah changed all the way down he changed mass all the way down from eternal self-existent to god the logos did he put his image and likeness in a man and he never went any lower are you with me church all of god all the dead ears all of god is in you eternal is in you self-existing is in you holy the logos is in you and once god put all that he is in you he said now i can rest church as he created man god said i'm done i'm pleased it's over listen listen church spiritual mutation is all about a message and see the message what god was trying to show us is all that i am i put in you and we hear the prophet say it over and over again if you get a spoonful of the ocean you got every element of that ocean in that spoon so let me tell you something when you get the baptism of the holy ghost you get eternal you get the self-existing one you get god's status amen that's the one i think trips us up see he didn't have to be god but he became god because he wanted you and us to understand that we are gods hallelujah we are gods well let me back up a little bit holly before he got to man hallelujah god the logos he began to speak he said let us make man in our image you know that that that particular question has been up for debate hollywood for years and years but look at it church holy nothing else is dead who is he talking to you know some people say it was us the bribe we wasn't there earlier in order in order for us to be there it has to be a mind there it wasn't even a mind there yet you know why because he was just all eternal just all space and then all space became self-existing and then we dropped down to god hallelujah he's asking a question he said let us make man in our image who is he talking to church holy he looks back and he looks at himself because he who was eternal and self-existent has now dropped down to these stages and he said let us create man in our own image see god is so powerful hallelujah he don't need nobody else's opinion his opinion is his opinion and he is alone so god looks back hallelujah to the self expressions of himself which was eternal and self-existent and says let us make man hallelujah eternal self-existent god so god created man in his own image in his own likeness there was no other likeness at that time but the likeness of the eternal one hey take out your big gloves now holly don't let it go over your head because what i'm expressing today is who you are in church god looks at he turns back has a conversation with himself holly you ever had a conversation with yourself where did it come from it's all right sometimes when you're discussing spiritual things in your spirit and you say well i'm just talking to myself because it all started with god nobody else could help him create anything in his own image because he was the only creator hallelujah so as he created hallelujah and he began to have a conversation when you know you have a conversation ah i ain't gonna do it like i'm gonna do it like this when you think about spiritual things amen so church in everything we do we have to see that it has to be in uh uh a spiritual origin amen hallelujah so church we see god talk to himself and he said let us create man in our own image hollywood in our likeness and just to show it was true when adam was created adam could do everything god hallelujah descended and brought down to him hallelujah he could create hallelujah hey man he was self-existent nobody hallelujah got any primitives in the garden but adam adam was so much like god god created and brought the creation to adam and say you name it why because he was in his image and likeness he felt like god he talked like god you know what i would just go ahead and say he was a god so when he mutated he put all that in adam listen the prophet says now when god made man in his image he was a spirit man and then there was no man to till the soul that he created man out of the dust of the earth now chronologists and so forth and these people that search and get old bones and so forth and believe in evolution uh-oh now the prophet's gonna tell you what evolution really is the prophet says he believes in evolution he didn't say dogmas theory he said i believe in evolution but listen what he says he says i believe in the right kind of evolution man evolutes from himself all right all right so we evolute we're not going to evolute from a monkey you're not going to evolute from a donkey you're going to evolute from the seed within you you're going to evolute from the genetic message within you hallelujah but if we if we we see all these things listen let me let me keep reading he said he ever lose from himself but not all from one's hell no no sir because a bird has been a bird ever since god made him a bird so what he's saying is a bird doesn't mutate into a fish no he mutates from himself hallelujah so church what he's saying to us is that if we become anything it's already in us hallelujah the seed of god is already in you holly so what are you saying brother jesus i'm saying when god created you in your seed he put eternal life in it from your seed hallelujah he put love in it hey man he put patience in that seat he put brotherly kindness in that seat he put temperance in that seats see church these are not things that has to be added to us we just mutate into those things it's already there hallelujah but certain situations brings it out amen that's why god handle you see church you don't know what you're able to do until you get in a situation where you have a need see the prophet didn't know anything about the third pool until he needed a pool now god is going to show him who he really is he's out there hunting hallelujah but there's nothing to hunt holy so his situation is going to create something that he needs are you catching me your situation spirit and truth is going to create a church building hallelujah your need hallelujah makes god ever lose or change masks as the prophet said to meet that need remember he said it's not a different character it's the same character playing a different role for that situation so what he does as jehovah sometimes he's gyara hallelujah and you know as jehovah sometimes he's rafa he's still hallelujah jehovah one who exists with his family hallelujah but then sometimes he mutates or changes mass and calls himself shama hallelujah and you know one of the ones i love amen he calls himself holy jehovah rod but he's still one who exists with his family hallelujah so as he changed mass think about it hey man as he changed mass as one who exists with his family first things first he has to identify himself as a father because if he got a family he has to be a father and when you think about a father you think about his words holy and i always use my daughter for this you know she's about to get into a level where she's driving on her own and all these things and i said you know what if i come to my daughter and i say honey when you turn 18 i'm gonna have you at 500 beans ah brother you get that girl i'm gonna say that she ain't this and that get that girl corolla you don't think like i think remember she's looking at me as the one who gives out promises hallelujah so she's going to look at me at what kind of promises i got what kind of things that i've said i'm going to do for her holiday you know if i'll say i'm going to get you a bicycle she said i only want that promise to come to pass i'm past that stage i don't even want that i ain't even looking at that we should be past how we dressing how we look at all those things holy we should be past paying tithes we should be past all that stuff hallelujah all right the church you think about if i make her a promise holly because i'm a promise keeper our god is a promise keeper so now she's looking at me as one who exists with his family that daddy said he was gonna buy me a mercedes when i turned 18. you know what she's gonna map it out on the calendar she might have a whole year to go brother solomon but all she know is daddy said [Applause] daddy said when i get this age on this date on the 21st of november i'm gonna have me a mistake and what happened it produces an expectation because daddy has never lied to her daddy has always kept his word what are you saying i'm talking about jesus he's a promise keeper he has never told us a lie he's always kept his word he said i will supply all your needs he said trust in me and lean not to your own [Applause] [Music] understanding church like i said last night he told abraham hallelujah that i'm gonna give y'all a land hallelujah elaine he told children i'm gonna give you a land floor with milk and honey what they needed to do was anchor down in the promise that god gave that once that message reached the place it's supposed to reach it can't change so once it gets to you you hold on to it and say god i'm looking for it see you know what i'm in a place now holly well i'm not just looking for blessings i'm looking for those blessings of the scripture well they say it'll be so much you won't even be able to contain it that's what i'm looking for holy i'm in the market to buy me another house harley and i went to the bank the man looked at my bank account he said well uh where you gonna get the money from he's like i'm looking right here and looking right here and this and that you got another bank i wanted to say yeah the bank of heaven he said he said can you get a gift from somebody i said yeah it's coming he but my thing to him was you do your part you do your part and i guarantee you if you approve it god has never let me down all you need is a reason hallelujah all he need is a reason to bless me hallelujah all he need is a reason he don't care if he's on paper he don't care if your bank account mine is still so minus that oh god needs a reason to show that he has the logos coming out of his mouth don't be afraid hallelujah to step into places with the authority god has already given you [Applause] [Music] church when i walk when i walk into the bank i don't walk in there as brother jigs i walk in there as a son of god you know he said he owns a cattle on a thousand heals who do who owns it we own it because if god is in us those same things that he owns is a part of our heritage hallelujah you say i read you preaching prosperity and i am [Applause] hallelujah he said i want you to prosper as your soul prospers now i don't know about y'all but i know my soul is already prospering so now i'm looking for everything around that soul hallelujah to get the same thing the soul is experiencing [Music] i want my back to be comfortable i want my legs to be comfortable i want my elbows to be comfortable [Music] remember what we said last night you you got the power to create what you want to come to you amen if you're walking in fear the attributes of fear gonna come to you he said i've given you power to become something holy see remember the scripture says we're being changed where from glory to glory so in every stage in your life you ought to be shouting glory out of your life out of your mouth church look there's a sister i know in london she was looking for a job anybody well let me say like she was looking for a better job she was looking for a better job because she know god can do anything but church harley she has some stuff against her husband she was uh uh she comes from africa so she already had to have papers for citizenship and all these things so that's a strike against her they're looking at her like you not even from here and you want this kind of job and i do so she said she filled out at least 100 applications and nobody called her back so you know what she did she went down to pray and she said lord i didn't fill out a hundred application all i need is just one phone call all i need is a crack in that door once i get a crack in that door i'm gonna force my way in the bible says in the violent taketh by force church so she went she did just this last place she fill out they called her back and this was no burger king this was one of the elite jobs remember you get what you asked for because ah lord i just need a job to pay my bills and not what you're gonna get every time after you pay them bills you're gonna be broke because that's what you asked for just enough to pay your bills [Music] it's just like a young sister let me tell you young sisters and young brothers used to be specific when you're praying for a south a spouse you be specific holly you're the sisters you don't get it going praying that god said lord i just need me a faithful church man a faithful church oh yeah let me tell you you'll get what you asked for he'll be here on time uh rain uh tornado hurricane whatever he'll be here on time but that's what you ask for a faithful church man holy what about the love what about the comfort he'll be a faithful church man and you're the only one working [Applause] but he gave you what you asked for you asked for a faith and he'll be sitting right up in here hearing the word of god pastor be preaching on a man who don't work don't eat he'll be like man i come to church he'll be a faithful church man holy but you say lord give me a man with all the characteristics of who you are not only lord a man that hallelujah loves going to church but a man that loves me like you loved it like you love the church hunter a man that's gonna be my provider a man that's gonna be my confident a man that can lift me up when i am down wow a man that can feed me when i'm hungry a man that can touch me when i need to be touched did you know the mistake we've made so say lord i just i just need me a good man and you get a good man with no understanding you trying to live the scriptures and he'll come and say but we ain't got to do all that but he nice you're a good guy hey man he don't fuss at you he don't argue he don't raise his voice but he's just like i ain't gonna do that i don't think brother jack meant for us to do that hey we gotta pay i think god means us to give what's on our hearts but he's a good man holly and vice versa brothers husband hey man you know if you ask for a woman lord i just need a woman that can cook boy she can burn like it ain't nothing like it ain't no tomorrow but she can cook everything in the book earlier hello but she's not compassionate hallelujah she may not know how to lift you up when you are down and the worst thing she can do don't be going through a transition where you ain't got no job she must be well somebody got the word [Music] but you got what you asked for so church when we're dealing with the things of god we have to be specific amen so let me ask you what kind of new building y'all want remember church hallelujah there was a there was a little girl a little boy who didn't have eyes earlier and before the prophet prayed he said what color eyes you want he said what kind of eyes you want and billy paul said hallelujah as he began to pray he seen blue streaks coming down hallelujah in the atmosphere hallelujah and after he prayed and that child opened their eyes they had blue eyes because that's what they asked for me but this sister church she uh uh let me see what time it is she said lord all i need is an opportunity just one call so she got a call back they say hey we want you to come in and do an interview and you know you get one of these jobs where you have to pass certain kind of tests you know you have to have uh uh characteristics testing and all these other math tests and everything her first test was a math test and she said lord i'm just no good in math this was a high power job she said lord all i can do is pray that you got my hand jesus be offense all around me every day church and she prayed the prayer say lord i want you to guide my hand on this answer sheet and i'm going to trust you now let me show you real faith church when you ask god don't add none of your stuff to it she asked god to guide her hands so you know from there brother solomon after she asked god to guide her hand when she started taking the test brother jack she didn't even read the questions anymore she pushed the book aside put a hand on the answer sheet and went i think this a i think this b i think this c i think this d i think this a i think this b i think this c i think this d i think this a i think this b i think this c i think this d i think this a and now it looked like she went through the whole test guessing but she went through the whole test hallelujah believing what she asked god for [Music] she has gone to get out of her hand hallelujah so she talked to tessity with three other ladies that took the test with her hallelujah and at church she got a call back holly they said you passed the test and they said you're the only one that passed the test [Applause] and you didn't just pass you made a perfect score [Applause] [Music] [Applause] chad won't he do it i said won't he do it won't out god do it church he ain't go halfway past the test anybody looking for a perfect score in his place they say we've never seen this in the history of test-taking because all those other people before her never asked god to take their tests or god they hang on but then they wasn't done they said we got one more test we don't we need you to take well we got to we need you to go to the next interview and god was so on point god was so with us church remember in the scriptures holy sometimes god had to open our eyes to where we're standing remember elijah was out there hey man they got surrounded holy and his servant came out there and woke up and saw all the the the chariots and all these things oh my god we in trouble see his mind started to fear he started going to places but elijah just stood there and he said lord open his eyes so he can see what's really going on and then that moment the lord opened his eyes and there was chariots of fire holy behind the enemy the enemy didn't even know that they were surrounded hallelujah so church what i'm saying is he's always there hallelujah so church she goes to the next level hey man and she's meeting with the interviewer hallelujah and now you're supposed to have another question totally and you have to come you have to answer it right but this particular interview is some kind of way she began to tell her what to say she says okay they're going to ask you a question and this is how you respond now when they ask you this question this is what you say and when they ask you this question this is what you're saying on and on and on so by the time she got to the next interviewer she already had all the answers on what would say to pass the test church you can see where i'm going harley by the end of all her testing there was no way that they could ever not give her the job no matter what her countrymen status was no matter where she came from hallelujah they had to give it a job hallelujah because her scores were out of this world because you have to realize the person that was taking the test was eternal hallelujah was self-existing amen was god hardly and had the locust coming out of her mouth there's a sister in my church who had got a sick right around the cove time she had a new job and she couldn't go to work hallelujah church she said oh god i just got this new job and now i can't go to work because i'm sick god said don't worry church for a whole month without never clocking in on that job she got a check every week [Applause] never even wrote her name on the time clock never even came to work and for a month every week she got a full 40-hour paycheck now i'm gonna say it again won't he do it [Applause] people looking at me crazy when i say i want me a maserati come on brother be humble now whatever like we say it ain't the car that make the man is the man to make the car hallelujah it ain't the clothes that make the man is the man that make the clothes holler it's who you are and how you conduct yourself this church if i get an r that ain't going to stop me from being a christian holly he might mess with your mind but he's going to mess with mine because i'm gonna come to church just as blessed as i always was it's just that now i'm driving to rose ross [Music] you get all upset about what god is doing in somebody else's life no you ought to rejoice with them because that's your brother he's one who exists with his family if god did it for one child he could do it for the next child [Applause] why do we feel like to be christians we got to be struggling i don't know listen church the prophet of god he says now i ain't gonna be too much longer listen he says now the greek word therefore this this is in the message uh i believe this is the unveiling of god yeah this is in the unveiling of god i think he says now the greek word there for that form i've been looking at and all day yesterday trying to think what it is i find he said come up with the word of amorphy and then he spells him off and he says looking in the greek to find out what morphe was i may pronounce that wrong but the reason i spell it when it's on when the tape is released the people will scholars scholars will know what i mean he says when he morphed that means he changed himself he came down see i think we missed that part right he changed himself but remember god descended as he descended he was changing himself but he still was who he is harley see as he a morphe he changed mask he says now the greek word there means that something that could not be seen see he was eternal he couldn't be seen he was self-existent he couldn't be seen and even as god hallelujah he couldn't be seen but once he became hallelujah a man god he morphed himself into a man now he can be seen all the characteristics of god can be seen he said yet it's there and then it changed and the eye can catch it hallelujah so the only reason why church god began to mutate is so that we could catch him so that we could see his presence so he can see he's always with us he's a banner he's a shield he's my all in all he's my first he's my last he's with us see the whole changes of god is so we can see who god is church listen when you think about the attributes of god god had things shut up in him so what he began to do god said i want to be released i want to be released god said there's so much about me you don't know yet he said so what i'm gonna do i'm gonna let the devil run a little wild holly just so you can begin to know who i am and it's gonna look like it's some trouble he said no but it's the revealing of who i am hallelujah and as god began to reveal himself and uncover himself there were different levels of god hallelujah he was bringing to the people just like the scripture says he says abraham isaac and joseph they knew me as god almighty hallelujah he said but as jehovah they never knew me he's talking to moses now he's talking to moses and moses there's another level of who i am that abraham isaac and jacob didn't have a chance to experience yet but i'm still god almighty but now i'm going to show you that i'm jehovah hallelujah listen church as god almighty what was he doing hey man he was pushing abraham into his position of faith hallelujah as as god almighty hallelujah he was pushing isaac in his position of love harley as god almighty he was pushing jacob in his position of grace you know what i think we really miss what grace is we got faith yeah praise god whoa god did this we see the love lord i'm gonna lay my life down i love you but that grace preach that grace has us confused that grace has us messed up because we'll be looking why am i going through this and all it is is grace look what he did to jacob look what he did to jacob because god wanted to express his grace what did he do holly he caused friction in his house he lost his relationship with his brother he even had to lie to his prophet daddy all the friends in the streets probably talked about him because he didn't know how to hunt but that boy could cook a pot they probably call him little rainbow but all of that was the grace of god why look his mama was there if you don't remember anything else about his mama his mama helped him get over on his daddy your parents know how y'all do pull them girls aside you know you should be telling her no but what you do you want to be the good parent and then you make a statement like well you know how your dad is yeah you know how he is so you ought to stick with your guns [Music] this ain't good parent bad parent because ultimately what's going on is what's best for the child hallelujah but look i'm gonna leave that alone but anyway you look hungry church you look we be looking for favoritism in the house holy if your child gets filled with the holy ghost that's all we want hey they know god that's all we want god to teach them and show them that it was all for their good hallelujah i told you the best ministry i got is the shut your mouth ministry [Music] that's the best ministry i see that do things i could only dream about wow [Music] oh telling jack my son-in-law itching to get down here worship with y'all but look church hallelujah you look at jacob hey man he his brother went out to hunt he couldn't get none of the jacob was in there cooking up i look like old deceiver cooking up a pot his brother comes saying man i'm hungry what you got he said boy i got it for you he said i got it for you today welcome to the welcome to the restaurant of jacob say what you need i got it he gave him that pot since neal he gave him that powder or whatever he fixed up and he saw style before you eat he say look before you give me that now this is what we gonna do i'm gonna give you something to eat but i want that birth right honey i want the birthright husband and he's like man what a birthright gonna do me right now i'm hungry whatever then after he gave it to him his eyes came open after he got it now he looking at jacob man i'mma kill you i'ma kill you and tuck my birthright next thing you know jacob on the run jacob gone can't talk to his dad at no more his mama waving by honey you got to get out of here he's all gonna kill you he gone next thing you know he find himself at layman's house remember sometimes grace is a mystery you don't understand what god is doing but he's putting you in position of grace in that church he's dead he's in layman's house he sees a young lady he's like man i got to have her he worked seven years he wrote a contract out with a dad agreed for seven years got married married the wrong one y'all know what he probably was sitting there saying wow what i mean lord lord we haven't been so faithful and look at us now we in a school lord we preaching your word we ain't wavering off this message we're preaching the truth around here god lord what's going on we're being faithful around here lord what's going on don't misunderstand grace don't misunderstand grace you say i love my relationship oh lord my children don't misunderstand grace hallelujah sometimes grace has to come into focus hallelujah for church remember it's a mutation hallelujah amen church from there jacob hallelujah he not only takes leah why did he keep her because she had saw his secret parts and he couldn't give her back hallelujah that's the thing about god once god takes you behind that veil he can't give you back he can't give you back i don't care what you go through i don't care what mistakes you make once god reveals himself and shows you his secret once he shows you his secrets he can't give you back. hallelujah because if you're the gay leader back leo would have been walking around and said man nobody's saying i didn't being in the chamber hallelujah i didn't been in the chamber i know what's going on hallelujah so he had the keyboard hey man then he worked another seven years and he got a little man i mean he got rachel and now you think he got two women hallelujah and rachel got a little besides herself because she knew jacob loves her hallelujah and now she's saying you know i'm special i'm just gonna say you're gonna have no babies and leo's starting to push him out lilly look at him say you know what i got a surprise for you in nine months he don't love you he loved me yeah but i got his baby you know rachel said you know what i'm sick of this she call her hands man say hey have us some children so now she have a baby that's what you want to do not only am i gonna have another baby i'm gonna give him my hands made too so now you're having babies by leaving their hands made and rachel's handmade and both of them all these four women fighting over one man what was that that was grace of god huh there had to be a hundred and forty four thousand there had to be a nation of israel and where did it come from it came out of all that confusion hallelujah what was it what it looked like four women fighting over one man it really was the grace of god it was the mutation of the spirit all right because you had the 12 times hallelujah [Music] don't complain just say lord i don't know what you're doing but i'm ready [Applause] church grace is a mystery oh my i'm running out of time church look about 10 more minutes church look when you think about what god has done and how he does it do it in the grace of god listen the whole world has mutated under the spirit of fear and evil just like it was in the bible days god said look the whole sins and everything has come up to me and he said look the imagination of men is only evil they were under the influence of evil and they say you know what i'm sick of this i'm gonna kill everybody i'm going to kill all of it but then the bible says when you go over hallelujah and i think chapter 6 chapter 5 it says but noah found grace what was how did that grace come that grace came in the form of a message it's gonna rain so he had to preach that message as long as he stayed with that message he had the grace of god hallelujah but look what that grace did it started out with just mo with just noah working on a boat by himself working on a boat you know he had three boys he was a father hunter and a husband but he was working on that boat and you know he probably said his boys came and said hey dad you want to go play some catch he put all his tools down to come on run along now they out there throwing the ball he's all right boys that's never got to get back to this grace staying with the message on the boat on the boat on the boat and then they say hey dad you want to shoot some ball hey man he puts all the tools down he'd go around shoot some ball break their ankles you know what i mean they say dad i know you could play like that he said yeah man i'm the son of god i got hops hallelujah so you know he played with his boy the next thing you know he said that was a good game they said dad we sure enjoyed it now he's still working on the boat his boy's watching what's happening what's happening now they are personally experiencing the grace of god so they say hey dad let's play one more game so he goes back out there he breaks all the ankles they say okay boys that was good hey man i have 26 i win what y'all playing i have 21 or 26. y'all play 21 okay we play 26 where i'm from so anyway we playing 26. hey man so he didn't beat the 26. hey man tell the boys i got to get back to this boat and then look at each other say let's go help dan with this boat so now his influence and grace has gotten his boys without him saying the word just living it and now he got the boys on the on the boat and all of them working on the boat they experiencing the same grace hallelujah he didn't have to preach to me i'd do anything all he had to do was stay with the message god gave him and as he stayed with the message hallelujah hey man the understanding that he wanted him to have they just dropped into it hardly because of his faithfulness hey man and not him and the boys are working on it his wife come in remember huddling for him to have boys he had a relationship with his wife now his wife comes in she said honey tonight's date night he pulled everything down the way you want to go he put everything

message together and we're going gonna sit right here and we're gonna eat hallelujah we're gonna eat right here hallelujah around this message we will have date night right here on this boat holly look at it his influence of grace not only got his boys but he got his spouse too hallelujah it influenced the whole family man and that grace caused his whole family to escape [Applause] what is the grace of god doing for you huh what is the mutation of god doing for you give me that one about dna i'm about to close holly [Music] give me the word about dna says look we hear about dna so much we think about the bloodline of just the that dna is a gene listen but listen to what dna does that's what i want you to catch remember hallelujah blank it off for a second because they reading the head blink it off bring it off for a second listen listen church when it comes to the holy ghost the holy ghost when jesus began to describe the holy ghost his life he never said what it was he said what it will do he said it will comfort you he said it'll bring all things back to your remembrance holy he didn't tell you what it was how do you know if you got it by the life you live listen oh i hit the wrong way it's news but listen i got about 10 more minutes anyway anybody about team i mean come on somebody let me see about 10 minutes all right 10 20 30 40 50. i got at least another whole hour praise god praise god you love preaching to the bride praise god but listen church hallelujah now amen now you think about it church the the the dna of god and how god operates remember he always said he never said holy what it was he said the holy ghost would show you what it would do amen amen now put that back up sister now dna we think we say dna the bloodline this and that and all these things no dna what it does look he says what does dna do dna contains the instructions needed for the organism to develop and if we got god's dna there's something in you that instructs you how to live not only how to live but it instructs you on how to hallelujah survive got somebody whoa boy i got god's dna in me so you know what i am i'm a survivor [Applause] no matter what you say brother you going through something tough i'm a survivor you say you're going through something in your family with your children i'm a survivor why because i got god's dna in me i got the mutation of god's dna he says and reproduce hallelujah so it's not super saiyans not just with me for one trial it'll always reproduce for everything i need it for as long as i'm living as a father there's things in my dna that i passed down the key era there's things in me that she can't refuse because it's a part of my dna hallelujah patterns of a hair because of me patterns of her eyes because of me patterns of a skin tone because of me and you know when a child is around you for so much and so often they'll even begin to talk like you listen man you sound like your daddy hallelujah why what is it it's the dna of the father honey going down to the children amen look he says the functions of dna sequences catches now sequences must be converted so the only way you can get this message of the dna is for you to be converted so you really want to see god's dna inside of you it got to start with a conversion first hallelujah without a conversion you'll never be able to understand the message of his life inside of you [Music] without conversion you won't develop right you won't be able to survive you'll never reproduce because there's no conversion he says look he said look secrets must be converted into messages that can be used to produce proteins [Music] where does protein go in the body protein hardly deals with the muscles hallelujah hardly that's what the whole world is trying to figure out to this day it was old life how do i keep my muscle protein without protein you're going to shrivel up you might have all the muscles there but it ain't nothing to excite those muscles so church we don't have good protein services service is full of substance good music hallelujah good worship amen good word honey we'll walk up out of here with our chest boy i feel like i was living 300 pounds a day [Applause] and you know the more you work it the stronger you get and see the thing about developing muscles you have to come to a place of failure [Music] the muscles will never grow unless you get to a place where you are weak that's why they call it muscle failure you get muscle fade the protein hit those muscles it energizes those muscles and then you go back to the same weight and push it 10 more times on a different day so church we got god's dna inside of us we got a message inside of us that came straight from god listen it ain't brother brandon's message it comes from the dna of god it didn't come from kentucky it came from heaven so we understand how god mutated eternal talk to me terry eternal elohim god self-existed god elohim did he with the god holly and out of god came the logos and the logos created man so how do we mutate there you go brother hallelujah god brought it all to us so what are we doing we're bringing it all back to god so what do we do now we have the logos inside of us and the logo shows us that we are gods and from god hallelujah we go to elohim self-existing and from alex's elohim self-existence there will be a rapture that makes us eternal hallelujah we are the spiritual mutation of god come on musicians don't forget holy that we're not down here on a cakewalk amen there are going to be trials they're going to be tribulation all these things but in the midst of all that there's one thing i don't want you to forget don't forget that we're saved i think sometimes we go through so much we forget to enjoy that we're saved we forget to enjoy the spiritual mutation i can't be lost why because eternity is in me i can't be lost because hallelujah the self-existent one i ain't gonna serve nothing else but him hallelujah i can't be lost why because i have a god status holly i have the ability to control every circumstance hallelujah and look he said uh i think this might be in the message why christ speak but one of the mess no this is in um god proven this word he said joseph did everything god told him to do i mean joshua joshua did everything god told me to do he told me strong and very courageous you know i just love dramatizing us hallelujah but you know what god walked to him sister bernice he told me say you know what nobody be able to stand before you everywhere you go souls of your feet have already given it to you for a possession [Music] and you know he'd go to a battle he looked he may be outnumbered but all he could think about was what god told him and he ain't congregating with his people what y'all think what this what y'all he said it's time to fight because there's nothing to be able to stand before me every time he went to battle hallelujah he was the leader ah i go out there and fight one more time y'all church holy but can you imagine you go out to fight ai and he lose the battle he said uh i ain't supposed to lose that's not a part of god that's not a part of my dna i ain't supposed to lose see that's the problem some of you got used to losing you're looking at your situation well maybe it ain't god's will how you know that stay the course stay the course and believe the lord this ain't the time to give up we've come too far to turn around i like the way travis green said hallelujah when he was preaching when he was singing the hill hallelujah when he got to the part telling his testimony he said his wife hallelujah was having a baby premature and the doctor told her say well we're going to take the baby and y'all might as well just give up and try again travis say we trust god too much to [Music] we trust god too much to give up holy church you look at joshua he went there hey as he fought ai he said it got to be a problem there got to be something wrong hallelujah he found aitkin hollywood aiken had the battles on the garments and all this stuff he killed aiken his wife his children his uncles his brothers his cousins his dog his cake killed everything that would reflect that unbelievable and then he went back and fought the same people the same people that had defeated him he went back and fought those same people and gather the people say hey we're going to go fight ai again and the old church probably look around uh uh general joshua you sure you want to do that we just lost about 32 000 died you said ah why because he was living by the promise of the father he was living by that spiritual mutation hallelujah and he couldn't lose from that point did he lose he was so confident one day he was praying and somebody stood before him glistering and shining and joshua got up and say look at me nothing will be able to stand before me and everywhere i go god is already given to me now who are you are you for us or against us hallelujah remember church he wasn't worried because paul and even brother branham said if an angel said anything different from us hallelujah let them be a curse now joshua's looking at an angel he's saying identify yourself are you gonna die hallelujah they already had record hallelujah of the saints of god meeting angels jacob already had put one in the figure four so i ain't turning you loose do you bless me and you think joshua's gonna be afraid childhood like no identify yourself and you don't we won't rumble in this place he said i'm the captain of the lords oh god is with me church see the dna of god always comes and makes the message known hallelujah so church this is not a time to be afraid this is not a time to be weary but this is a time to just keep moving forward in the name of jesus christ let's pray let's pray and i'll get out your way let's pray lord we thank you for your word we thank you for your grace lord we pray with something said to help your people lord god we

just felt that brother diggs just did a wonderful job of taking us back to last week and uh and i can tell you already he's already stepped into next week so i'm sitting here listening and i'm just looking at the scriptures i say lord look at you just you're just a mighty god and so much that is going on and talking to brother quentin a little early this week and we're just saying how we just see god doing things and how they're coming into the art two by two god just sending them you know you know sometimes we don't recognize what god is doing but god is moving right in the midst sometimes that trouble that instruct the family and you think it's just trouble no it's grace it's grace that that's how god get people's attention amen get them to a place where they realize that they can't do nothing without god hallelujah we need grace like that amen but i just i just see god moving i i feel him moving i hear him moving i hear the rustle in the mulberry tree i know the move is on my god let's keep our eyes focused say man on what god is doing and i just love the way he typed that with this this plan or pandemonic that's what i like to call it you know this covet thing that kind of came and see our prophet already told us that there would be germ warfare prophet already said that so we can't stop these things from happening i was telling somebody earlier this week say the world not changing you can't wait for it to go back to what it used to be that's not that's not happening right you're gonna have to make some adjustments praise the lord right and and oh god i'm just just trying to get people to see that you know there's a lot here that that that is happening but but i think the primary thing is that god is also mutated god is doing something amen he stepped it down i couldn't help but think about brother quaker preaching about you know if you went there to fpl you couldn't take your your cell phone charger and plug it into one of the hey man it's not even a transformer just the power plant the grid you can't go plug into the power grid as soon as you got that close to it you'd be sad but but that power has to step down [Music] from the grid to a transformer and you can't touch the transformer either they got to step it down come on somebody they gotta bring it all the way down until it's just a plug where you can put something in and get a charge hallelujah but it's all coming from the same place [Applause] you couldn't understand god you couldn't figure god out until he stepped it down you begin to see him inside your own life my what a message brother i was just blessed glory to god brother hallelujah god is good god is good i'm i'm so happy that brother dicks came a man our way so happy i'm so happy glory glory amen we certainly

my fault brother i just i just had the wrong thing in my head but god worked it all out you know and and i see why god has something that he wanted to get to us and amen the message has been delivered not only has the message been delivered you carry in [Music] the message it's actually in the mutation in both definitions there was a message in the dna and there's a message in the mutation so you're carrying the message even if you don't want to carry it and it's going to reproduce glory to god glory to god god bless you brother let's have a word of prayer church amen father we are just so
