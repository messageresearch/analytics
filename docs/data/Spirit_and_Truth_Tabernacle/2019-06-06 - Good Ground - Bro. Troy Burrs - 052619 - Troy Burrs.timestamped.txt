[44:08] Ford when I started the first verse mark
[44:10] 4 and he began again to teach by the
[44:15] seaside and there was gathered unto him
[44:18] a great multitude so that he entered
[44:21] into a ship and he sat in the sea and
[44:25] the whole multitude was by the sea on
[44:29] the land and he taught them saying many
[44:32] things by parables and said unto them in
[44:36] his doctrine hearken
[44:40] behold there went out a soul to soul and
[44:44] it came to pass as he sold some fell by
[44:50] the way side and the fowls of the air
[44:54] came and devoured it up and some fell on
[44:57] stony ground where it had not much earth
[45:02] and immediately it sprang up because it
[45:07] had no
[45:08] death of Earth but when the Sun was up
[45:12] it was scorched and because it had no
[45:16] root it withered away and some fell
[45:20] among thorns and thistles and grew up
[45:23] and choked it out and it yielded no
[45:29] fruit and the other fell on good ground
[45:32] and did yield fruit that sprang up and
[45:38] increase and brought forth some 30 some
[45:43] 60 in some hundred men left middle add a
[45:49] blessing to the reading of his word you
[45:51] may be seated
[45:52] Amen if I had to title this message I
[45:58] was like the title may be down a little
[46:02] bit still got that ringing brother good
[46:07] ground simply good grind Amen we we
[46:13] realized that our bodies they men our
[46:19] flesh is made up of elements a man that
[46:24] come from the earth and we see that that
[46:31] this earthly Tabernacle that we have a
[46:35] man that uh that was the soul of the sea
[46:39] was talking about this earth a man that
[46:43] see that I've had to take good ground in
[46:47] in your earth we used to sing their song
[46:51] backwards that day uh we have to break
[46:53] up their fallow ground sometime when
[46:56] you're beginning to farm land you have
[47:01] to go out and you have to pick a spot a
[47:03] good spot to start your garden and you
[47:08] have to go out and put forth - look man
[47:11] you were labeled by going out and taking
[47:14] up all of the weeds and removing all of
[47:16] the bad things and you
[47:17] to break the ground up you have to get
[47:21] that ground prepared to receive see a
[47:24] man so when you go and you plant the
[47:28] seed and then you water it you didn't
[47:32] you wait for the seed to come forth they
[47:36] man now we see here that that we're
[47:42] living in a day where where where we can
[47:46] sense the prophet of God likened us to
[47:50] sheep likened us to sheep and one thing
[47:54] that he said was she has doesn't make
[47:59] they don't they're not like other
[48:00] animals they're different from other
[48:02] animals most animals have a really keen
[48:06] sense of smell and they smell their prey
[48:09] and things of that nature and that's
[48:11] this is how they hunt because they have
[48:13] the smell and the smell but a lamb
[48:16] doesn't have those that knows those
[48:17] qualities but see what a lamb does have
[48:20] his lamb has a sense say about him that
[48:25] he can just sits when death is around
[48:30] Deacon's he has something about him that
[48:33] there's all of a sudden or the Prophet
[48:35] was telling a story about how to lion or
[48:38] was sneaking up on me lamb in the lamb
[48:40] he could have smelled a lion he didn't
[48:42] know what a lion was coming from but he
[48:44] said death was near a man and and and
[48:48] the Prophet like in Buster's sheep and
[48:50] we can look at the times that we're
[48:52] living in and we can look at the things
[48:54] around us and we can recognize where
[48:57] there's a something going on on the
[48:59] inside that we sits at the end it's near
[49:03] amen the true sheep can have there's
[49:06] something going on that they can sense
[49:08] that wait a minute something something
[49:10] is going on here at the time time is
[49:14] winding up we can sense amen
[49:18] that desert there's a hurry-up about us
[49:20] it may be consistent
[49:23] there's where there's sense of an
[49:25] emergency
[49:27] because because we can feel me inside
[49:32] about watching amen are the things that
[49:35] are going on around us and with the word
[49:39] we can see that the end is drawing none
[49:43] amen and or one of the things he heard
[49:46] me says it's time that happens amen
[49:50] a lot of people would say this message
[49:53] is full of things like do's and don'ts
[49:56] yeah I'm gonna come to preach this
[49:59] morning a bunch of do's and don'ts amen
[50:02] but what I did come to do is a tip to
[50:05] stir up your righteous mind
[50:08] Amen so that you can be a well a mandate
[50:13] the time is drawing to an end amen let's
[50:17] see all I'm trying to do is to get you
[50:20] to see that the end is drawing near
[50:24] trying to get you to see that the time
[50:27] that meant that we're living in the time
[50:30] that we are in it's an urgent time I
[50:34] mean even to some of us have been around
[50:38] a while and have we've seen over the
[50:41] years we could we've seen the change we
[50:44] see the degradation of mankind
[50:46] everything it in an only 50 in my short
[50:50] 50 years we could see the degradation of
[50:54] mankind we can see that that when I was
[50:58] a young man there's certain things that
[51:00] we we don't see them that we see now
[51:04] there's there's no way that that when I
[51:08] was coming up and my grandmother would
[51:09] take me to church some of the things
[51:11] that we see amongst churches are weird
[51:15] see this day they may not - recently we
[51:18] went to to another little church or any
[51:22] of you would be called
[51:25] tersh with your shoulders out we told
[51:30] you come out it's just less than four
[51:32] what in the world is wrong with people
[51:34] that they would come to the house of God
[51:38] dressed in such a man a man and you can
[51:42] see that people are just totally lost
[51:45] and they're totally blind but seeing
[51:48] what happened is their spiritual amnesia
[51:54] they have a sickness and the prophet
[51:57] brought out that in this spiritual
[51:59] amnesia sometimes he said there's three
[52:01] ways you get it sometime it's from shock
[52:05] amen sometime it's from worry
[52:08] you see worry has no virtue to see and
[52:13] you can worry yourself into a spiritual
[52:17] amnesia and to a signature to you lose
[52:22] who you up through worry you know and
[52:27] the other thing the Prophet Brody said
[52:29] when you get haunted between two
[52:32] opinions spiritual sickness a disease
[52:39] called amnesia well you don't know who
[52:43] you are anymore you know you can be
[52:52] sitting there talking to know who you're
[52:57] talking to anymore what a sad and
[53:00] pathetic state to be near to where you
[53:03] just lose all sense of who you are you
[53:07] lose your memories of all of the things
[53:10] that you went to that made you the
[53:12] person that you are
[53:13] you are just in inner inner inner state
[53:17] of delusion don't know who you are don't
[53:21] know where you came from if you don't
[53:23] know who you are and you don't know
[53:25] where you came from
[53:26] there's no way you could know where
[53:28] you're going
[53:30] there's no way you can know where you're
[53:32] going and this isn't either is a disease
[53:35] that so many have today we see a man
[53:44] that uh that uh that this call
[53:52] this disease is caused by being halt
[53:58] between two opinions a man
[54:03] y'all bear with me now we want to we
[54:17] want to take a look that the Bible says
[54:21] a man in Amos a man the third chapter
[54:28] wealth should be familiar with it as
[54:31] some of us are that it says that surely
[54:37] the Lord would not do nothing till he
[54:41] reveal his secrets to his servants the
[54:46] prophets and one of the things is that
[54:52] people we find that they're not even
[54:57] expecting looking for seeking a prophet
[55:03] we talked about here in this scripture
[55:06] that there was one that went and sold to
[55:11] Steve seeds and I want to just skip on I
[55:14] say that that seed a man is the word of
[55:18] God that seed that is planted in you
[55:22] from the foundation of the world
[55:24] a man is predestinated placed in you for
[55:27] the whole night now here is to come to
[55:30] life in the age that you're living in
[55:35] what an intelligence that see
[55:40] planted into your earth that will come
[55:43] to life in that time when the women went
[55:48] that word Amen for that time that you're
[55:51] living in amen
[55:53] when it recognizes the true Word of God
[55:56] amen that we're talking about the rain
[55:59] amen in the Sun that the waters that
[56:03] that that causes that sea to produce a
[56:06] man so when we look at matter we look at
[56:10] of Eve we wanted to look take a look at
[56:14] he Eve cameras know night night now the
[56:16] first prophet the first prophet they man
[56:21] was God himself he told Adam and Eve he
[56:25] told him he said now I ought to give you
[56:27] the word and and it's up to you to keep
[56:30] this word and what happens he Eve was
[56:34] the first version and if the Bible talks
[56:37] about a virgin and and you can run it
[56:40] through the scripture and liken that to
[56:42] a church okay to a woman no no now and
[56:46] Eve oh by the time thank God by the time
[56:50] she had got to Adam amen her wound had
[56:55] already been vitally her wound had
[56:59] already been violated but because see
[57:01] what happened was she she couldn't wait
[57:04] on God she she got all so thirsty for
[57:09] knowledge and so thirsty for education
[57:14] and things of that nature that she moved
[57:16] ahead of God and by the time she came
[57:19] see if she wanted promised that she
[57:21] would have just waited because he had
[57:23] already told him to be fruitful and
[57:25] multiply
[57:25] amen it would have came the correct way
[57:28] but she had already violated herself by
[57:32] committing spiritual adultery not too
[57:36] long ago our pastor was here in the
[57:38] pulpit and he was talking about
[57:39] explaining he said he's one of the
[57:41] things about women preachers when you
[57:45] have a revelation of a woman in the
[57:48] pulpit you know it
[57:50] it shows that that's it's not right
[57:53] because of what it is because of the
[57:56] beginning and and how that pastor that
[58:01] preacher in the pulpit is is is sowing
[58:04] seed amen and the soul of seed is always
[58:08] a male si si si si si you you you you
[58:11] you what you have been a spiritual
[58:13] perversion si and then what happened is
[58:16] he that's that's that's that's what a
[58:18] delicate his worship the devil gets his
[58:22] worship in / versing the original seed
[58:26] of God he wants to if he can alter a man
[58:30] the thing in it just a little bit you're
[58:32] no longer worshiping God but you're
[58:35] worshiping him because it's not the word
[58:39] because it's not the word so if you can
[58:41] he get you to alter God's Word or to
[58:44] deviate from scripture in just a little
[58:47] bit then you're worshiping him and and
[58:52] and that see a man now you're planting a
[58:56] another see a man we see that uh in this
[59:04] time that one of the things in this time
[59:07] is that Satan a man is is really how
[59:16] would I say troubling our young people
[59:20] not just our young people our older
[59:23] people to this this is I will try to
[59:26] encourage our young folk stay with the
[59:29] Lord
[59:30] stay you know those things are gonna
[59:35] come up
[59:35] there's things are gonna come in your
[59:37] life that are gonna try to tempt you to
[59:40] do certain things and to go in a certain
[59:42] direction when we and you don't be in
[59:47] being young see look look
[59:49] did one of the things Eve was young Eve
[59:55] was only about I think the Prophet said
[59:59] about 21 22 but see that's whack
[1:00:01] certified wish
[1:00:02] that's when death set in this is why
[1:00:05] that we we grow up and we eat and we
[1:00:08] grow into certain up to a certain age
[1:00:10] and all of a sudden we stop growing
[1:00:13] death that's it no matter how much we
[1:00:16] eat no matter how much we consume we're
[1:00:18] no longer growing they may unless we're
[1:00:21] growing out but we're we're at that
[1:00:25] point death is already set into the body
[1:00:27] see so there's a certain time as a
[1:00:30] certain age group now hear me here
[1:00:33] there's a certain age group where the
[1:00:35] devil really gets at you there's a
[1:00:38] certain age group and that's a it's that
[1:00:41] that both young men and young women
[1:00:44] around that critical age 21 to 25 is
[1:00:50] when you're most vulnerable
[1:00:52] Satan is a risk because if you can get
[1:00:55] past that and serve the Lord stay with
[1:00:59] God it is gonna be much easier from
[1:01:02] their own if he can't get you thrown off
[1:01:04] there he can get you he can get you to a
[1:01:08] place where your life is troublesome
[1:01:11] hard the rest of the way through and I
[1:01:14] said that you can't come back that you
[1:01:15] won't make it or anything of that nature
[1:01:17] but it's he can get you though make a
[1:01:19] mistake do some things wrong right at
[1:01:24] the front that's gonna make it that much
[1:01:26] harder to run this race at that critical
[1:01:30] age it's a very critical Junction and I
[1:01:34] just want to encourage all my young
[1:01:35] brothers and youngsters at that age stay
[1:01:39] with the Lord do everything you can stay
[1:01:44] close to your pastor stay under the word
[1:01:46] stay in your church
[1:01:48] don't let nothing different that's
[1:01:50] exactly what he did Eve Eve would
[1:01:54] welcome him oh god oh no doubt she loved
[1:01:58] her freedom no doubt she will the
[1:02:01] problem was was explaining it one day
[1:02:03] and said that he would walk through the
[1:02:06] garden and she would say hello to all of
[1:02:09] it
[1:02:09] and just having a wonderful time and
[1:02:12] remember the serpent was one of the
[1:02:14] animals she would say hello mr. serpent
[1:02:18] how you doing this morning surfer would
[1:02:22] give a cordial conversation
[1:02:24] good morning Eve how are you this
[1:02:28] morning and they would have just a
[1:02:30] normal conversation but she wants you
[1:02:32] didn't realize that this one day he was
[1:02:36] no longer the serpent the devil had
[1:02:39] incarnated his body and he had began to
[1:02:43] what preach doctrine to Eve and she
[1:02:48] accepted that doctrine first she
[1:02:52] accepted it in her mind into the womb of
[1:02:56] her mind and then she accepted it into
[1:03:00] her womb see so folks this see that
[1:03:05] we're talking about the seed that we're
[1:03:07] talking about if it was talked it was a
[1:03:13] spoken word seed see God's the original
[1:03:20] seed the message the original spoke the
[1:03:22] spoken word is the original seed
[1:03:24] C and C is so today about a speaking of
[1:03:29] the word a man Satan at that time was
[1:03:36] about a speaking of the word amen that
[1:03:39] he that he sold sold I see so we see
[1:03:46] that that like that
[1:03:47] it was the sons of God of set and the
[1:03:51] sons of the lineage of God through Adam
[1:03:53] and the daughters of Cain when they saw
[1:03:57] that they were pretty and that they were
[1:03:59] fair and and and we see that the sons of
[1:04:04] God looked upon the daughters of men and
[1:04:07] began to desire them began to circle
[1:04:12] because because they they dress
[1:04:15] different because they they were they
[1:04:18] dress in a manner of
[1:04:20] of seductive the Prophet said that note
[1:04:24] that better that woman was the biggest
[1:04:28] at the beginning the downfall to man and
[1:04:31] it's going to be the same thing at the
[1:04:32] end and we see now today in this day and
[1:04:37] age that that spirit is coming to
[1:04:42] maturity
[1:04:43] once again a man now we look again we
[1:04:47] see that uh there's another virgin
[1:04:50] there was another that was another
[1:04:53] encounter where we're going to go and
[1:04:57] talk about Mary how married a man that
[1:05:02] angel of the Lord came to Mary and said
[1:05:05] [Music]
[1:05:06] you're gonna have this son and Mary
[1:05:10] couldn't marry could could he brought
[1:05:12] out that Mary coulda said wait a minute
[1:05:14] I can't do this or nothing like that but
[1:05:17] she didn't do that she accepted Amen
[1:05:21] that seed of God so now we got two
[1:05:23] versions we got these two women we got
[1:05:26] one at the beginning who who before she
[1:05:29] got with her husband what she was a
[1:05:31] virgin but she defiled us before she got
[1:05:34] to the hub and it produced what death
[1:05:37] and here although we have another virgin
[1:05:40] whoever it was was was was expounded by
[1:05:43] the Holy Spirit I mean it produced what
[1:05:47] life Amen because she did not allow her
[1:05:51] womb to become defiled she did not allow
[1:05:54] a man false doctrine creeds and dogmas
[1:05:59] into her room she stayed right with the
[1:06:01] word amen
[1:06:03] and that here we are a man today facing
[1:06:07] the same thing I don't want to get ahead
[1:06:10] of myself now
[1:06:16] jesus said that uh when he was here if
[1:06:20] you have faith like a mustard seed would
[1:06:25] say to this mountain be thou removed and
[1:06:28] cast into the sea amen and it will so
[1:06:32] you have to have that it was the special
[1:06:35] character about that mustard seed is
[1:06:37] that it can't be mixed it won't mix with
[1:06:42] anything else a man if you can't allow
[1:06:45] your that that seed to be mixed with
[1:06:49] anything with creeds and dogmas a lot of
[1:06:53] times you know we look and one of the
[1:06:56] things that Satan a man one of the
[1:06:59] things that Satan you know in this age
[1:07:03] in this day and time try to tell us that
[1:07:06] uh we want to look different we wanna we
[1:07:10] want out we want to we want to we can't
[1:07:13] take home the world's image we can't we
[1:07:18] week this Satan wants us to feel a
[1:07:22] something because you're different but
[1:07:26] see as Christians were supposed to be
[1:07:28] different we're supposed to be set aside
[1:07:31] I mean one of the things that uh you
[1:07:35] know you know Adam and Eve when they was
[1:07:41] in the garden they were veiled they were
[1:07:46] veiled a man with a with the holy veil
[1:07:49] so you know we've seen pictures and
[1:07:52] things with them in the Garden of Eden
[1:07:56] and different things like that and it
[1:07:58] showed them you know without clothes and
[1:08:00] different things and but see the
[1:08:02] prophets say that they had a veil date
[1:08:04] they were failed that they didn't
[1:08:06] realize they didn't see their nakedness
[1:08:09] they were oblivious to it until the sin
[1:08:13] and then what happened was the first
[1:08:16] thing they did was put on a fig leaf so
[1:08:21] even back there in Genesis clothes
[1:08:25] manner and when when when they hid
[1:08:30] themselves God could use they would
[1:08:31] fellowship with with the Lord in the
[1:08:33] cool of the evening he would come down
[1:08:35] and this time he come down they say Adam
[1:08:39] away yeah you know it's time for church
[1:08:41] well well yeah Adam hiding itself
[1:08:45] because he knew that he was naked and
[1:08:49] and and then the Lord one who told you
[1:08:52] who told you this who told you you was
[1:08:56] naked and see even then a man they had
[1:09:00] on the wrong garment and he had to go
[1:09:03] kill the lamb and say here put this on
[1:09:07] so even then your clothes your manner of
[1:09:12] dress matters it matters to God how you
[1:09:17] present yourself before this is what I'm
[1:09:22] getting that even though here we looked
[1:09:24] at how the the sons of God the sons of
[1:09:28] sent looked upon the daughters of King
[1:09:30] and they were found why because there
[1:09:34] was a spirit on the inside of them that
[1:09:37] they wanted to dress seductively where
[1:09:43] does that come from where does that come
[1:09:46] from now we see what the fall was in the
[1:09:49] beginning we see what the fall was in
[1:09:51] the beginning now we see that the spirit
[1:09:54] that is a was even back then that was a
[1:09:58] that was that was among the women to be
[1:10:02] seductive to be seducing and that the
[1:10:07] men of the sons of God thought they were
[1:10:10] fair the Prophet and we wonder why we
[1:10:14] said well when we have a prophet he said
[1:10:16] why he came in this age and he preached
[1:10:19] under women's law you know how just a
[1:10:26] matter of dress in me and they bought me
[1:10:28] cousin
[1:10:29] and in Mandarin themselves after the
[1:10:32] world after the fashions of this world
[1:10:36] you know what these fashions and stuff
[1:10:39] come from
[1:10:40] most of these fashion designers are the
[1:10:43] most evil and wicked people you ever did
[1:10:46] one of me some of the most perverse
[1:10:48] people that don't do it all kind of
[1:10:51] things and then coming up with these
[1:10:53] fashions that coming up with these
[1:10:56] fashions out of strip clubs and
[1:10:57] different they their whole mind and
[1:11:00] their whole concept is to do what to
[1:11:04] entice my human eye their whole thing
[1:11:09] because they they don't know it they're
[1:11:14] being controlled now we're gonna get
[1:11:16] into this a little bit they're being
[1:11:17] controlled by a spirit they're not even
[1:11:20] aware of so when they making me decides
[1:11:25] they're being controlled by an evil
[1:11:28] spirit and now that evil spirit hermanus
[1:11:31] taking on the person who puts on the
[1:11:33] clothes to be seductive to walk a
[1:11:39] certain way to have a certain mannerism
[1:11:42] about them to do one thing what because
[1:11:45] the son of God to phone to cause us you
[1:11:50] notice you notice the same never went
[1:11:52] back
[1:11:54] he never wear that but he got Eve now
[1:11:59] you take this back to have SARS and even

[1:12:38] problem we need Wow because you are
[1:12:42] judging them without even opening your
[1:12:46] mouth that one over wait a minute what's
[1:12:48] wrong with me

[1:13:20] heart now you bow that may be a season

[1:13:29] bound by already spirits that you can't
[1:13:34] go free you can't go free on your own
[1:13:39] hey man now seeing this that in this day
[1:13:43] and age the Prophet brought out in the
[1:13:49] message the spoken word is the original
[1:13:53] see he said that there were three seed
[1:13:57] sown in this day there was three seats
[1:14:01] on a mistake there was a seed song by
[1:14:04] you had Billy Graham who was the Baptist
[1:14:11] and the Presbyterian to Methodist groups
[1:14:13] he said a Billy Graham went and sold his
[1:14:18] soul seeds all over the world and you
[1:14:22] had another soul of seen by mister oil
[1:14:29] Robbins the Pentecostal see and you had
[1:14:34] his ministry
[1:14:35] that's sowed the seed of the word and
[1:14:38] you wonder why what was he doing what
[1:14:41] was he doing it came so out of the
[1:14:44] ordinary so different and says hey why
[1:14:46] do you why do you preach on our women
[1:14:48] folk like this I'm so antsy I have to go
[1:14:52] around he went around the world seven
[1:14:54] times so on see and then all of a sudden
[1:14:57] out to these three gentlemen went around
[1:15:00] and sowing the seeds he brought out how
[1:15:04] how there was a former in a latter rain
[1:15:07] and he said now and she said that that
[1:15:09] former ring was called a teaching ring
[1:15:12] it was a teaching rain and that rain
[1:15:15] that was was after those seeds have been
[1:15:18] sown amen
[1:15:20] that the word had been taught you know
[1:15:22] how I get when you plant a garden and
[1:15:24] then after you plan to God the first
[1:15:26] thing you do you gotta soak the ground
[1:15:28] that was that teaching rain but there's
[1:15:32] a lot of rain that bring that seed into
[1:15:35] maturity we're living into the time of
[1:15:39] that maturity that wasn't that he
[1:15:43] preached that message the spoken word is
[1:15:45] the original scene in 1962 here we are
[1:15:48] in year 2019 both all and Billy Graham
[1:15:54] are no longer here and the Prophet that
[1:15:58] seed that was planted in it's coming to
[1:16:01] maturity that's why I started out by
[1:16:04] saying that one of the things of a man
[1:16:06] you can you can sense that the end is
[1:16:09] drawing near
[1:16:10] that's one of the things that a limb is
[1:16:12] able to do David a sense that the end is
[1:16:15] drawing near and and and we see that
[1:16:19] that he brought out how uh how that see
[1:16:23] in its maturity is going to produce what
[1:16:27] the World Council of Churches that
[1:16:29] confederation of churches that is going
[1:16:32] to come against amen that's this there's
[1:16:34] two bindings going on
[1:16:36] there's there's one that cuz the sower
[1:16:38] seed come to bind up to the the shuck a
[1:16:41] man and and then another vine taking
[1:16:44] that wheat a man going to the marriage
[1:16:47] supper and that that binding up that
[1:16:49] shuck and all that's that's coming
[1:16:51] together now for the burning those all
[1:16:55] of it is coming to maturity and coming
[1:16:57] to a head and they say
[1:16:59] and this time so that's what I'm saying
[1:17:03] it's so critical for our young people to
[1:17:05] recognize that keep yourself keep
[1:17:09] yourself pure keep yourself holy because
[1:17:13] the time a man at the end is so close we
[1:17:17] that the seeds have been sown you happen
[1:17:20] to be living in an inner in the last day
[1:17:22] and a lot of people for some reason you
[1:17:25] know you don't believe that you can't go
[1:17:27] around mixing be careful what you're
[1:17:30] allowed to go into your womb be careful
[1:17:32] of what you allow yourself to listen to
[1:17:35] be careful what you're allowed to be
[1:17:38] that allowed to go into your womb so you
[1:17:40] want your mind and your heart is the
[1:17:43] room the way where you know where that
[1:17:46] seed is planted and you don't want
[1:17:50] anything just as entering into your into
[1:17:53] your bedding ground anything interim
[1:17:57] into your bedding ground so we see now
[1:17:59] that that that uh I want to go if we
[1:18:07] look at um
[1:18:11] turn your Bibles to Martin for a man
[1:18:18] mark for
[1:18:32] and let's see here
[1:18:50] Oh started the 37th verse 37 verse in
[1:18:55] Myanmar for 237 verse it says and there
[1:19:00] arose a great storm of wind and waves
[1:19:04] beat into the ship so that it was now
[1:19:09] full and he was in the hinder part of
[1:19:14] the ship asleep on a pillow and they
[1:19:18] awakened him and say unto Him master
[1:19:21] carest not that we perish and he arose
[1:19:25] and he rebuked the wind and said unto
[1:19:28] the sea peace be still
[1:19:30] and the wind ceased and there was a
[1:19:34] great calm and he said unto them why are
[1:19:37] you so fearful how is it that ye have no
[1:19:41] faith and they feared exceedingly and
[1:19:44] said one to another what manner of man
[1:19:49] is this that even the wind and the sea
[1:19:52] obey Him
[1:19:53] were going to the fields and they came
[1:19:55] over unto the other side of the sea and
[1:19:58] to a country of garden Gardens
[1:20:04] dhadak got errands and when he was come
[1:20:09] out of the ship immediately there met
[1:20:11] him out of tombs a man with an unclean
[1:20:15] spirit who had in his dwelling among the
[1:20:21] tombs and no man could bind him not with
[1:20:26] change because he had been often bound
[1:20:30] with fetters and chains and but we felt
[1:20:35] as a chain and the chains had been
[1:20:37] plugged asunder by him and the fetters
[1:20:40] broken in pieces neither could any man
[1:20:44] tame him and always night and day he was
[1:20:48] in the mountain and his tombs crying and
[1:20:51] cutting himself with stone you see this
[1:20:56] man was being tormented
[1:20:58] this man was being tormented by demons
[1:21:03] by demonic spirits that had him bound
[1:21:07] that had him spiritually bound with
[1:21:11] these fetters and chains that he
[1:21:13] couldn't go free he he was cutting
[1:21:16] himself and you see today when many
[1:21:20] people when they're doing things and
[1:21:24] they know that they are going to hurt
[1:21:26] them such as smoking cigarettes some are
[1:21:30] on drugs some take to alcohol they know
[1:21:36] that these things are gonna harm them
[1:21:38] but see you can get so to a place where
[1:21:41] that demon has overtaken you so much you
[1:21:44] don't care about life anymore you find
[1:21:48] these different ones I'm gonna be honest
[1:21:49] with you you find different ones on
[1:21:51] these motorcycles and different things
[1:21:52] and they're in the streets and you said
[1:21:54] they're crazy what are you driving like
[1:21:56] that they ride like that they don't care
[1:21:58] about life they are just trying to live
[1:22:01] for the moment you see different ones
[1:22:04] and they go out to these nightclubs and
[1:22:06] there take all kind of unnecessary risk
[1:22:08] and chances they are being tormented by
[1:22:13] demonic spirits they don't care about
[1:22:15] life they're living just for the moment
[1:22:18] they're trying to just they're trying to
[1:22:22] know their pain trying to calm their
[1:22:25] fear they are being oppressed by demons
[1:22:28] everywhere you look everywhere you look
[1:22:32] some people are what they would call
[1:22:34] functional alcoholics functional drug
[1:22:37] addicts they go into the secret of their
[1:22:40] home and and do things intentionally to
[1:22:44] try and dull the pain because they don't
[1:22:48] really care about tomorrow they just
[1:22:50] live in for a moment they just live in
[1:22:53] for a moment why because they're being
[1:22:55] tormented by demonic spirits let's
[1:22:59] continue reading
[1:23:01] and always by night in the mountains and
[1:23:05] the tunes crying and cutting himself
[1:23:07] with stone but when he saw Jesus afar
[1:23:11] off he ran to worship and worshiped him
[1:23:16] and cried with a loud voice and said
[1:23:20] what have I to do with thee Jesus thou
[1:23:25] son of the Most High God
[1:23:28] i adjure he says i adjure thee by God
[1:23:32] that thou torment me not now as two
[1:23:36] people speaking here see but they're
[1:23:42] speaking and using one voice those
[1:23:45] demons recognize Jesus they recognize
[1:23:50] and they begin to speak through this
[1:23:52] individual and say did you come - we got
[1:23:55] in to do with you this is our home we
[1:23:58] got this one you know you might as well
[1:24:01] go somewhere we got this one what are
[1:24:03] you coming but you know what Jesus came
[1:24:06] over the stormy sea to reclaim the seed
[1:24:13] that was crying out that seed was crying
[1:24:21] out and then he could not go free but
[1:24:24] there was something on the inside of him
[1:24:27] that was crying out for God and Jesus
[1:24:30] recognized it and Jesus came over to
[1:24:33] stormy sea I say this morning what did
[1:24:36] Jesus have to come over to get to you
[1:24:39] did he have to go into a barroom did he
[1:24:43] have to go into the truck being did he
[1:24:46] have to go behind denominational walls
[1:24:50] where did Jesus have to go through I'll
[1:24:54] rephrase it
[1:24:55] what do he have to go through to get to
[1:24:57] you but he's not he's coming to reclaim
[1:25:02] carseat I we didn't go back and read it
[1:25:06] but job says in the 14 that man is born
[1:25:11] a few days and full of trouble
[1:25:14] but this body is going to go back to the
[1:25:16] dirt so what he's reclaiming is that
[1:25:20] seed that life on the inside and if he
[1:25:25] can get there to that life and get those
[1:25:27] speech that's a lot of times while look
[1:25:29] we come to church and we around
[1:25:32] different one
[1:25:33] you can't go free with no spirits on you
[1:25:35] you want to go free different people
[1:25:39] know they've been in conditions they
[1:25:41] want to go free but Jesus came to this
[1:25:45] man a man who was bound with these
[1:25:48] spirits just to get that one scene again
[1:25:52] I said what did he have to go through a
[1:25:54] man to get to you
[1:25:56] amen let's continue reading and he cried
[1:26:01] with a loud voice amen and God I said
[1:26:04] are you the not torment me not see the I
[1:26:09] said again this man he wasn't looking
[1:26:11] for Jesus he wasn't he wasn't he him in
[1:26:16] his natural state he wasn't trying to go
[1:26:18] to church he was trying to he wasn't
[1:26:20] doing nothing but that was something on
[1:26:23] the inside that G that God had to
[1:26:27] reclaim a man and he said unto Him come
[1:26:31] out of the man thou unclean spirit and
[1:26:33] asked him what is thy name and he
[1:26:37] answered saying my name is legion for we
[1:26:40] are many and he besought him much and he
[1:26:46] would not send them away out of the
[1:26:49] country now there was near unto the
[1:26:52] mountain a great herd of swine feeding
[1:26:55] and all the devil's besought him saying
[1:26:57] send us into the swine that we may enter
[1:27:00] into them
[1:27:01] a man so we see here that uh
[1:27:08] said my name is legion for we are many
[1:27:11] and this is why I say to like young
[1:27:15] people when you when you when you don't
[1:27:19] stay with the things of the Lord all
[1:27:23] you're doing is
[1:27:25] howling demon on top of demon on top of
[1:27:31] demon on top of demon that's why it's so
[1:27:35] hard for a person into their older ages
[1:27:38] to change and come to the Lord the
[1:27:41] prophecy is much easier in you in the
[1:27:44] days of your youth because you don't
[1:27:46] have these spirits that are fighting
[1:27:48] against you you don't have all of these
[1:27:50] spirits that are fighting against you
[1:27:51] but when you go out and look some of you
[1:27:54] all we're gonna test you go right then
[1:27:55] you get involved in certain things that
[1:27:58] you everything I said like that you big
[1:28:00] and bad enough to get involved in now
[1:28:04] you got to fight in battle these spirits
[1:28:07] that you have collected along the way
[1:28:11] just for God to get that see now we
[1:28:15] realize you see that guy that God would
[1:28:18] come through
[1:28:19] amen a stormy sea to reclaim that sea
[1:28:22] now the Prophet was talking about he was
[1:28:25] he was a member of one of the group
[1:28:30] called the full confidence men and one
[1:28:33] of the leaders of that group was a
[1:28:34] gentleman by the name of Dimas cheek
[1:28:36] area and the mister Karen used to her
[1:28:39] cows and he would he would uh farm these
[1:28:44] cows and he would take so brother
[1:28:48] branham was down at the farm with him
[1:28:50] and at one time and they would he short
[1:28:54] brother branham you know look how he
[1:28:57] does things and how he produce more cows
[1:29:03] so he would take the fluid from a male
[1:29:07] bull with a syringe and he and he put it
[1:29:10] on a little microscope and he took that
[1:29:13] ether on a petri dish or a plate or
[1:29:15] something to put under the microscope
[1:29:17] and he would look down in that little
[1:29:19] drop and he said well what is those
[1:29:22] little things twitching around in there
[1:29:24] you got him and you know how to
[1:29:25] microscope you got to hone in on it and
[1:29:27] everything and say see millions of these
[1:29:29] little microscopic these little things
[1:29:31] I'm gonna he said those are little Bulls
[1:29:35] and
[1:29:36] cows little bulls and cows and he said
[1:29:40] what their millions of them
[1:29:42] he said yes their millions of them but
[1:29:45] only one is predestinated to make it to
[1:29:49] that see he said he was talking about he
[1:29:53] said you're looking at he say he say he
[1:29:56] said that natural burst is more of a
[1:29:58] miracle than the virgin birth I say wow
[1:30:03] he say cuz I know all the millions only
[1:30:07] one is predestinated to get to that and
[1:30:11] that's the one a man that he saw before
[1:30:14] the foundation of the world man that's
[1:30:18] gonna come to itself in that certain
[1:30:21] time through that entrance into the
[1:30:24] earth amen for what a specific purpose
[1:30:27] see God is in control he is in control
[1:30:31] they may all the way down to the
[1:30:34] insemination of your birth amen
[1:30:37] so he's looking at it and he said in out
[1:30:39] of all the mean that's Chamillionaire he
[1:30:42] said in all it one he's gonna make and
[1:30:45] then he looked back and he was thinking
[1:30:47] my mom the children of Israel when they
[1:30:51] was coming out of Egypt there were
[1:30:54] millions there was millions two million
[1:30:58] he said there were two million little
[1:31:00] over to me in one place is a two million
[1:31:03] fourteen or something like daddy said it
[1:31:05] was over two million and then in another
[1:31:06] place there that I read and he was
[1:31:08] talking about how out of two million
[1:31:11] only two only two one across Joshua and
[1:31:15] Caleb only two so my whole point in
[1:31:19] bringing out that story is that even in
[1:31:22] this day I don't know how many millions
[1:31:26] and millions of people we have on this
[1:31:28] earth but if the math goes right it
[1:31:33] won't be a whole lot it will not be a
[1:31:36] whole lot that'll make it that'll make
[1:31:41] it it's gonna be a small little group
[1:31:46] now remember what I say
[1:31:48] though there was three seas that was
[1:31:50] sold three seas that was sold the bride
[1:31:54] is gonna is coming to maturity there's a
[1:31:57] virgin that is not gonna allow her womb
[1:32:00] to be defiled that is not gonna allow
[1:32:04] over-wound am I gonna know that that
[1:32:08] former rain is gonna that seed that's on
[1:32:10] the inside of her heart is gonna come to
[1:32:12] maturity amen so I say to you this
[1:32:17] morning be encouraged be encouraged that
[1:32:23] we see that in this day in this hour
[1:32:25] that day the devil is as he is working
[1:32:30] so hard he is working so hard to to
[1:32:36] sidetrack you but there's something on
[1:32:41] the inside of you that God is trying to
[1:32:43] reclaim there will be a bride without a
[1:32:47] spot or wrinkle there will be a bride
[1:32:52] without a spot or wrinkle amen I want to
[1:32:57] be one I am one amen
[1:33:00] are you one are you one of them amen so
[1:33:05] I've been hoping my brothers and sisters
[1:33:07] lay aside every sin in every week that's
[1:33:11] just things that in our lives that we
[1:33:14] may be going through just realized that
[1:33:17] the devil is trying to saya if he can
[1:33:19] just you don't have to get you off just
[1:33:23] a little bit the Prophet was talking
[1:33:26] about how if you're trying to hit a
[1:33:27] target to use that Weatherby rifle you
[1:33:30] got to be dead-on straight if he can get
[1:33:33] you off just a little bit by the time
[1:33:35] you get down there you off 2030 hours
[1:33:39] you missed the mark by that much you
[1:33:45] know and a lot of times you know we're
[1:33:47] living in this age in time where people
[1:33:49] well it's okay
[1:33:51] you can't mix the word became mixed to
[1:33:55] work recently we was out of place in and
[1:33:57] and and fellow was preaching and talking
[1:34:00] about all

[1:34:11] gonna make it I can't receive it like
[1:34:13] that talking about all sorts of things

[1:34:44] receiving to your wound and just
[1:34:46] understand that where we're at there was
[1:34:49] there were there were there were three
[1:34:50] angels there came in this generation
[1:34:57] they sow seeds some once so good see the
[1:35:03] word the word of the hour this the word
[1:35:06] for this day other soul it was also the
[1:35:10] word for this way but for this day but
[1:35:12] it's and it's to do something totally
[1:35:14] different that confederation of churches
[1:35:17] that he talked about it's coming to its
[1:35:19] maturity it's coming to its maturity as
[1:35:21] well a man to do what to come against
[1:35:25] the bride to come against the bride hey
[1:35:28] man so this is where we're at amen we're
[1:35:32] not playing church we're not just coming
[1:35:35] out of tradition so many we see so many
[1:35:38] in this day and time they're going to
[1:35:40] church out of tradition out of habit

[1:36:07] becoming to the fruition of all that you
[1:36:10] have called me to be that I can come
[1:36:13] into the place
[1:36:14] to serve you and the purpose that you
[1:36:17] have placed me here for lean not to
[1:36:22] thine own understanding turn away from
[1:36:25] all of these worldly things and and and
[1:36:29] and and cleave to the Word of God
[1:36:32] because with its time as this is we like
[1:36:36] I said lamb we know there's a sixth
