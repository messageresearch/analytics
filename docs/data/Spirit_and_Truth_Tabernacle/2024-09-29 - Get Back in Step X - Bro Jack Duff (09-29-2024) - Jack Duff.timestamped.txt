[53:01] amen let's pray uh father we thank you
[53:04] for the reading of the word and we also
[53:07] thank you God that uh with these
[53:10] scriptures that have been read you have
[53:12] given us a a journey uh through
[53:16] scripture and and just through the
[53:18] message just to see Lord a little deeper
[53:22] into what has been promised here by Joel
[53:25] I realizing that we are actually living
[53:28] in the time where this promise is being
[53:30] made manifest uh This Promise of
[53:33] restoration uh God we're living in it
[53:36] and help us to find our place and uh
[53:40] Lord just get under an expectation to
[53:42] see a manifestation of what you have
[53:45] written before we were even born you
[53:48] wrote about us God let us know that we
[53:51] were always a part of your thoughts and
[53:53] uh we were a part of the Eternal
[53:54] thoughts of God so Lord we pray that you
[53:57] would bless uh our gathering here May
[53:59] the Spirit uh continue to unfold to us
[54:02] the word of God we take control over
[54:05] every Spirit that's against the spirit
[54:07] of God and may Lord you just have your
[54:10] way in this place make yourself real to
[54:12] each and everyone it's in Jesus name we
[54:15] pray amen amen you can be seated Amen in
[54:19] the house of the Lord amen amen amen
[54:25] amen we certainly thank God for um this
[54:30] journey that he has us on um We are
[54:35] continuing with our our thought on get
[54:38] back in step and we also come to the
[54:42] inspiration of I will restore saith the
[54:49] Lord
[54:50] amen this is not a promise from Brother
[54:53] Jack uh but this is a promise from all
[54:56] oh mighty God Amen and and and and
[55:00] whatever uh the devil's taking from you
[55:03] you ought to be looking to get it back
[55:05] Amen in this
[55:07] season Amen in this season L lay claims
[55:11] on everything God promised you amen
[55:15] hallelujah hallelujah uh but I I want to
[55:20] you know we we've been focusing a lot
[55:24] amen with this third
[55:27] section uh from the restoration there's
[55:30] four parts to it there is uh when you
[55:33] know we we brother random talked about
[55:35] the four death
[55:37] Messengers uh which you know we we
[55:39] realized that's the Palmer worm uh the
[55:43] uh uh Locust the cankerworm the
[55:46] caterpillar all those are the death
[55:48] Messengers but then he said um man it
[55:52] just it blesses my heart to know that a
[55:54] prophet could go deep into this and and
[55:58] then he says four life Messengers
[56:02] brought it back into the church and and
[56:04] his uh the four life Messengers he said
[56:07] was uh was Luther with the message of
[56:10] justification the just shall live by
[56:13] faith amen and then Wesley came with a
[56:16] message of
[56:17] sanctification and that was Life coming
[56:19] back into the church and then he said
[56:22] the uh third part of that was the
[56:26] restoration of the gifts which came
[56:29] through um
[56:32] um I I want to use the word Pentecost
[56:35] but not the
[56:38] denomination okay there it is it came
[56:41] through the Pentecostal
[56:45] experience hallelujah
[56:48] hallelujah but not the denomination and
[56:50] this is where the the people get all
[56:52] mixed up because they they when we when
[56:55] we use the word Pentecost they think we
[56:56] talking about the
[56:58] denomination no the denomination got
[57:00] started from an
[57:02] experience right and and and and I was
[57:04] mentioning to you all how you know when
[57:07] you go back and you see what happened on
[57:09] AUA Street and before I get too deep in
[57:11] there the fourth part of that was the
[57:13] word being restored uh but but but but
[57:16] you know when when a soua street hit uh
[57:19] I I gave you all just a some of the
[57:21] history and this is not me making it up
[57:23] you can go read this you know on your
[57:25] own
[57:26] uh but you know they had there was
[57:29] people believing that God was going to
[57:32] move in the gifts they were reading it
[57:35] in the Bible and they said God I mean
[57:38] this was not just something for the day
[57:39] of Pentecost a historic day uh because
[57:42] the scripture actually say in the last
[57:46] days that's pluralized in the last
[57:50] days I'll pour out my spirit right so so
[57:53] I I if if they're reading this and
[57:55] they're starting to see this like wait
[57:57] they start praying and and seeking God
[57:59] and there were men teaching and you know
[58:01] back in those days it was segregation so
[58:03] you had William Seymour which was a
[58:05] black man uh going to Charles Parham
[58:08] which was a white man and and Charles
[58:09] Parham was teaching this already William
[58:11] Seymour heard that he was teaching he
[58:13] said man I I want to sit in he actually
[58:16] he couldn't sit in the class because of
[58:18] because of segregation he couldn't sit
[58:20] in the class but he was so desperate he
[58:23] says I sit on the outside of the class
[58:25] and hear what is being Tau my God right
[58:29] and from there he went to uh uh uh Los
[58:31] Angeles California he got invited to go
[58:33] there and preach and and when he got
[58:35] there and preach he start preaching
[58:36] about these gifts right out the Bible
[58:38] then people got so upset they kicked
[58:40] them out the church said you not coming
[58:41] back to preach that no more that's false
[58:43] Doctrine all right but he stayed there
[58:46] in prayer Glory to God and as he stayed
[58:49] in prayer God heard his prayer and
[58:52] before you know it a a Revival broke out
[58:55] the souu street Revival and and here
[58:57] come the the gifts coming back into the
[58:59] church the experience of Pentecost now
[59:03] here's the problem when the denomination
[59:05] of Pentecost came and here's where the
[59:06] problem cuz everybody even param came to
[59:09] soua Street everybody was coming and and
[59:11] experiencing what was what God was doing
[59:13] there in souan street but what happened
[59:16] is that then some kind of way uh
[59:19] politics or racism got involved and then
[59:22] you had these two different groups broke
[59:24] up from there Hallelujah and they're
[59:27] still broke apart today amen the the
[59:30] blacks went with one side and they
[59:32] started the Church of God in
[59:34] Christ hallelujah amen and then the
[59:37] whites went another way and they started
[59:39] the assemblies with God both Pentecostal
[59:41] churches but one is run the blacks one
[59:44] run the right and let me tell you
[59:46] something the holy ghost that we talking
[59:47] about it don't bring that kind of
[59:51] Separation amen the Pentecost experience
[59:54] that we talking about it brings a
[59:57] Unity it brings a togetherness it brings
[1:00:01] a
[1:00:02] Oneness Hallelujah if if we see Division
[1:00:06] coming in the church something wrong
[1:00:08] with
[1:00:09] that glory to God Amen so we're in
[1:00:12] expectation to see a a the real genuine
[1:00:15] Pentecostal experience yes sir amen amen
[1:00:18] amen God promised it here I want to just
[1:00:21] kind of catch a few things and and now
[1:00:24] you you you'll see that I I'll read a
[1:00:26] lot of quotes and um we know that
[1:00:29] there's nine spiritual
[1:00:31] gifts um that that
[1:00:33] Pentecost that and we brought this you
[1:00:35] know we've been bringing this for the
[1:00:36] last couple weeks and I'll REM mention
[1:00:38] again today we realize this non
[1:00:40] spiritual gifts and the gifts of tongues
[1:00:41] is actually the eighth of the ninth the
[1:00:45] nine gifts but for some reason tongues
[1:00:49] has been attacked more than
[1:00:50] anything and I know tongues the reason
[1:00:53] it might be attacked is because the
[1:00:55] Pentecostal Church went to seed on that
[1:00:58] and they they they they told us that you
[1:00:59] did not have the Holy Ghost unless you
[1:01:01] spoke in tongues so then people just
[1:01:03] start making it up and now folks
[1:01:06] speaking in tongu and ain't living
[1:01:10] nothing living nothing Hallelujah I mean
[1:01:13] and and then then the other thing we got
[1:01:16] is that uh that you have people speaking
[1:01:18] in tongues and then after they finish
[1:01:19] speaking in Tong then they go to cursing
[1:01:21] somebody out and what the Bible says you
[1:01:24] blessing and cursing out the same mouth
[1:01:27] we we don't want that amen we want the
[1:01:30] real thing all right but but tongues has
[1:01:33] been attack but but yet we got to watch
[1:01:36] this because uh uh uh we can we can
[1:01:39] actually take something out of the
[1:01:41] church that God meant for us to have
[1:01:43] amen I think I was just listening to a
[1:01:46] quote where brother brand was talking
[1:01:47] about dancing in the church and he said
[1:01:49] you know what happened devil took the
[1:01:51] dance and perverted the dance but God
[1:01:54] gave dancing to the Saints
[1:01:57] yes he God gave dancing to the Saints oh
[1:02:00] let me let me get out of that let me let
[1:02:03] me get out of
[1:02:05] that dancing dancing is a it should be a
[1:02:08] part of our
[1:02:10] worship dancing is a sign of
[1:02:14] [Music]
[1:02:17] Victory when when when when when Moses
[1:02:19] in the children redro came cross that
[1:02:21] Red Sea and looked back and saw all h a
[1:02:26] taskmasters drowned in the Red Sea it
[1:02:29] put
[1:02:30] us
[1:02:33] hallelujah it it it put a it put a move
[1:02:35] in their
[1:02:37] feet and when you look back and see how

[1:04:46] to be made manifest right here in our
[1:04:48] midst I want those that have tongues to
[1:04:50] be free to speak in tongues I want those
[1:04:52] that have interpretation to be able to
[1:04:54] give an interpretation

[1:04:59] that work miracles in our midst I want
[1:05:02] all of that amen all of it amen amen
[1:05:07] here let me read just something here
[1:05:08] brother Brandon makes this statement out
[1:05:10] of the message questions and answers on
[1:05:12] Genesis um he um there's a brother here
[1:05:17] criticizing tongu so brother random
[1:05:19] makes a statement on it says and your
[1:05:22] Sudan missions
[1:05:24] said we have no place for a man that
[1:05:27] would speak in
[1:05:29] tongues and and now I'm I'm reading this
[1:05:31] quote but you know there's there's
[1:05:33] message churches that kind of feel the
[1:05:35] same way we have no place for this we we
[1:05:38] got the word no let's see what the
[1:05:40] prophet said right it says we have no
[1:05:43] place for a man that would speak in
[1:05:44] tongues and he come to me and said
[1:05:46] somebody speaking in tongues why why I
[1:05:49] said they now look at what brother R say
[1:05:51] it says they have no place for Jesus
[1:05:54] Christ
[1:05:57] for Jesus Christ spoke in an unknown
[1:05:59] tongue and died speaking in unknown
[1:06:04] tongues that's what he said now amen he
[1:06:07] says they couldn't accept Paul's
[1:06:10] teaching Paul spoke with tongues more
[1:06:12] than all of them one said to me
[1:06:14] yesterday said I'd rather speak five
[1:06:16] words with understanding see they trying
[1:06:18] to go back to the scripture I rather
[1:06:20] speak with f SP five words with
[1:06:22] understanding but Paul's teaching said
[1:06:24] covet prophecy yes sir it says and then
[1:06:27] then here's this other part we going to
[1:06:29] read this in a second covet prophecy and
[1:06:35] forbid brother yes sir
[1:06:40] Hallelujah forbid not to speak with
[1:06:45] tongues amen forbid not he says and they
[1:06:49] are forbidden to speak with tongues many
[1:06:52] churches are forbidden I mean for but
[1:06:55] but the but but when we go back to the
[1:06:56] Bible Paul say forbid not to do that
[1:06:58] right Hallelujah I'm going to read it
[1:07:00] for you in a second amen let's go on he
[1:07:02] says speaking in tongues is a Divine
[1:07:06] gift of God which belongs in the
[1:07:09] church just the same today as it was
[1:07:13] back there in the
[1:07:15] beginning he says that's exactly the
[1:07:18] truth yes indeed that's the Bible
[1:07:21] teaching it's a Divine gift and you deny
[1:07:24] that just to same as you deny the new
[1:07:27] birth you deny everything that Jesus
[1:07:30] taught when when you try to cut that
[1:07:33] out let me go on he says now you can go
[1:07:37] wild on that and that's where we got to
[1:07:39] keep this Amen in check we got to keep
[1:07:42] it in B and I'm going to help us with
[1:07:43] that I'm going to read some scripture to
[1:07:45] make sure that we got this really lined
[1:07:47] up I'mma just I'm going just keep on
[1:07:49] talking amen I'm going just keep on
[1:07:51] talking amen now now I want y'all to
[1:07:53] catch what the prophet says cuz I I
[1:07:55] quoted this a few few weeks ago but I
[1:07:56] didn't read it to you he says he says um
[1:07:59] he says now you can go wild than that
[1:08:01] many of them have Pentecostal church has
[1:08:03] gone wild on it he says but I'm saying
[1:08:05] that has its place it's just like a pair
[1:08:08] of shoes when you buy a pair of shoes
[1:08:12] the tongues are in
[1:08:20] them can I can I put it this way don't
[1:08:23] give me a pair of shoes that actually
[1:08:25] don't have the
[1:08:28] tongues right it's not a complete shoe
[1:08:31] if it don't have the tongues in it and
[1:08:33] don't just give me a shoe only with
[1:08:36] tongues because it's not a complete shoe
[1:08:39] I want the whole shoe
[1:08:42] hallelujah amen glory glory glory glory
[1:08:46] look at what he says now he says when
[1:08:48] you buy a pair of shoes the tongues are
[1:08:50] in them and that's right when you're
[1:08:52] when you're into the body of Christ God
[1:08:54] has the whole table set full there he
[1:08:57] has love he has joy that was those were
[1:08:59] the seven I mean the nine uh uh gifts uh
[1:09:02] fruit of the spirit which we read out
[1:09:03] Galatians we read that last week that's
[1:09:05] the nine fruit of the spirit but also
[1:09:07] the nine gifts of the Spirit all of that
[1:09:08] go together and then you know another
[1:09:10] thing that's on that tree I ain't even
[1:09:11] got to it yet but another thing on that
[1:09:13] tree is the is the
[1:09:16] virtues from the statue of perfect man
[1:09:18] all that's on this tree that God planted
[1:09:20] at Pentecost all right look at this he
[1:09:22] says if I went to your table and sat
[1:09:25] down there and you said preacher come
[1:09:27] eat with me I believe you love me and
[1:09:30] you had beans and potatoes and carrots
[1:09:33] and fried
[1:09:34] chicken uh-oh the prophet like fried
[1:09:45] chicken I believe you love me and you
[1:09:48] have beans and potatoes and carrots and
[1:09:50] fried chicken and pumpkin pie and ice
[1:09:54] cream everything said in there well I
[1:09:56] believe I'd be just as welcome to the
[1:09:58] potatoes as I was to the beans the only
[1:10:01] thing I believe I just I'd be just as
[1:10:02] welcome to the chicken as I was to the
[1:10:04] pie it's all on the
[1:10:08] table and the one thing I have to do is
[1:10:10] say would you please pass me some pie
[1:10:14] right Hallelujah my God I believe with a
[1:10:18] good free heart you your love to me
[1:10:21] would you say certainly my brother have
[1:10:23] a nice big piece of it is that right
[1:10:26] says would you pass me potatoes well
[1:10:29] certainly my brother here it is and
[1:10:31] every Redemptive blessing that Jesus
[1:10:33] Christ died for and purchased in his
[1:10:36] atonement at Calvary is sitting on the
[1:10:40] table and every believer setting before
[1:10:43] it we're sitting before it this morning
[1:10:46] Hallelujah if I need healing I say
[1:10:50] father pass me some
[1:10:53] healing my God
[1:10:56] Hallelujah whatever you need God's got
[1:10:59] it on the table just ask God to pass it
[1:11:03] along to you
[1:11:07] H says if I I pour it out on my plate
[1:11:11] and eat a big now if you want he said
[1:11:13] now if you want to starve to
[1:11:15] death and a table full of
[1:11:19] food you want to St the death he say go
[1:11:21] ahead and pretty much he say I tell you
[1:11:24] what you go ahead and starve I'mma eat
[1:11:26] my
[1:11:31] part that that's the way I feel I'm I'm
[1:11:34] I'm I'mma eat everything God got for me
[1:11:37] every gift that he promised I want it
[1:11:40] and I this is just I mean this just for
[1:11:42] spirit and Truth Tabernacle we going to
[1:11:44] have it all yes cuz God promised to
[1:11:47] restore it all Hallelujah we going to
[1:11:50] have it all he says yes sir prophecy is
[1:11:52] speaking in tongues now I I I mentioned
[1:11:54] this and I'm going to there's a yeah I I
[1:11:57] want to line up a scripture here in a
[1:12:00] second 1 Corinthians
[1:12:02] 14 um remember God planted this at
[1:12:06] Pentecost and this uh tree produced the
[1:12:09] nine gifts of the Spirit the nine fruits
[1:12:11] of the spirit we read a quote last week
[1:12:14] where David I mean brother Brandon said
[1:12:16] David saw the tree in Psalms 1 and um
[1:12:20] and and and and David pretty much said
[1:12:22] they they couldn't kill that tree they
[1:12:24] couldn't kill this tree that God planted
[1:12:26] at Pentecost they couldn't kill it
[1:12:28] because it was planted by the rivers of
[1:12:29] one water amen uh and and and and he
[1:12:33] said the uh the other thing David said
[1:12:36] there is that the tree would bring forth
[1:12:37] fruit in his season and brother random
[1:12:40] told us it's his fruit which is God's
[1:12:42] fruit God's tree God's fruit coming from
[1:12:45] his tree and it says it's it's his fruit
[1:12:48] in the season that the prophet is
[1:12:51] bringing it so the word is restored
[1:12:54] through the prophet the restoration
[1:12:56] comes through the prophets it's he says
[1:12:58] he says it's his fruit it's God's fruit
[1:13:01] in the season the prophet is bringing it
[1:13:04] it'll be in the prophet season God's
[1:13:07] fruit and God's Time by The Prophet
[1:13:10] season so we know that we're in the
[1:13:12] right season we know we're at the right
[1:13:15] time for these fruit to be coming forth
[1:13:17] from God's tree we know that and and
[1:13:20] again so we talked about the fruit of
[1:13:21] the spirit being love joy peace
[1:13:23] longsuffering goneness goodness faith
[1:13:25] meekness Temperance those that Denine
[1:13:27] fruits of the spirit according to
[1:13:28] Galatians 5 the spiritual gifts the
[1:13:30] fruit that are on the tree is the word
[1:13:32] of wisdom the word of knowledge it's the
[1:13:34] Bible said Faith Gifts of healing
[1:13:36] working of Miracles prophecy Discerning
[1:13:39] of spirits diverse kinds of tongues
[1:13:41] interpretation tongu all these things
[1:13:43] are supposed to be on this tree this is
[1:13:46] God's tree amen so we look for all these
[1:13:49] fruit now what the Holy Spirit just
[1:13:51] wanted me to do is to kind of go back
[1:13:52] and just make sure cuz brother brand say
[1:13:54] we don't we don't want to go wild on
[1:13:56] this so in order not to go wild we got
[1:13:58] to put it back in scripture yes sir is
[1:14:00] that all right yes sir amen let's go to
[1:14:02] First Corinthians 14 now all I'm doing
[1:14:05] is just setting this up um for uh for
[1:14:09] God to do what he going to do but but
[1:14:11] but here's the thing by us knowing
[1:14:13] scripture and knowing the message it
[1:14:15] won't get out of control cuz you know we
[1:14:18] can go right back to the tapes y'all
[1:14:20] remember it was taught brother brother
[1:14:22] Jack read the quotes and he read the
[1:14:23] scriptures it was taught we know how to
[1:14:25] keep these things in order even when I'm
[1:14:27] not here right amen truth brother amen
[1:14:32] because when I'm not here God can still
[1:14:34] move and something might just start get
[1:14:36] taken off in church and now I'm going be
[1:14:39] uh watching the video I'm going be like
[1:14:41] Lord you waited till I was
[1:14:44] gone but no I'm going to be happy that
[1:14:46] God moving in the midst of the people
[1:14:48] but I I but but I got to set it just
[1:14:50] right so that even when I'm not here the
[1:14:52] church knows how to operate
[1:14:55] according to the word hallelujah amen
[1:14:58] let's let's look at 1 Corinthians 14 I'm
[1:15:01] going to start reading at verse
[1:15:03] 23
[1:15:05] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:15:10] hallelujah all right look at this
[1:15:12] now um it says if
[1:15:17] therefore the whole church become
[1:15:19] together into one place and all speak
[1:15:22] with tongues and there coming those that
[1:15:25] are unlearned or unbelievers will they
[1:15:27] not say that they are
[1:15:29] matad so so one thing that we're not
[1:15:32] trying to do is get everybody to do it
[1:15:35] cuz cuz Paul even asked question do all
[1:15:37] speak with tongues no everybody got a
[1:15:39] different gift everybody got something
[1:15:41] don't and don't be trying to covet
[1:15:42] somebody else
[1:15:43] gift don't no come on don't make this up
[1:15:46] now don't just come up with jiba no no
[1:15:50] we talk about God God has giving you the
[1:15:52] gift you use that gift that's right all
[1:15:55] right now amen amen amen amen so he say
[1:15:59] he says but if all
[1:16:01] prophesy and there come in one that
[1:16:03] believeth not or one unlearned he is
[1:16:06] convinced of all he is judged of all
[1:16:10] amen it says and thus are The Seekers of
[1:16:13] this of his heart made manifest and so
[1:16:17] falling down on his face he will worship
[1:16:20] God and report that God is in God is in
[1:16:23] you of a truth now I have seen amen or
[1:16:26] I've heard testimonies of people coming
[1:16:29] maybe into a service or even you know
[1:16:30] like maybe uh uh somebody would call
[1:16:32] somebody on the phone say hey don't do
[1:16:34] what you getting ready to
[1:16:36] do the Lord telling me to tell you don't
[1:16:38] do what you getting ready to do like
[1:16:40] what you mean what the Lord told me to
[1:16:42] tell you don't do what you getting ready
[1:16:44] to do and sometime God might not say the
[1:16:46] whole thing right but but but but but
[1:16:49] the rest of the Tes like this person was
[1:16:50] get just getting ready to go kill
[1:16:52] somebody and they got stopped just like
[1:16:55] that because of a word of knowledge that
[1:16:57] came to him yes sir God can do things
[1:16:59] like this in our midst right amen he's
[1:17:02] still the same yesterday today and
[1:17:04] forever right he says he says uh uh

[1:20:59] if God don't give you the interpretation
[1:21:00] Lord anoint somebody here to give the

[1:21:20] yourself and to God hello yes sir amen
[1:21:25] we cuz I'm I'm I'mma tell you another
[1:21:27] thing that I've seen in church sometimes
[1:21:29] you got people that are very free that
[1:21:31] have accepted their calling with the
[1:21:33] tongue part but then there's others that
[1:21:35] have not accepted their calling with the
[1:21:37] interpretation part and they are
[1:21:40] here we got to wait for everybody to
[1:21:42] kind of catch up all right I'm I'mma
[1:21:45] keep reading I'mma keep reading amen it
[1:21:48] says verse verse 29 let the prophet
[1:21:51] speak two or
[1:21:53] three and let the the other
[1:21:55] judge if anything be revealed to another
[1:21:59] that sth by let the first hold his
[1:22:02] peace for you may all prophesy one by
[1:22:05] one that all may learn and all may be
[1:22:08] confident now watch this one watch this
[1:22:11] one and the
[1:22:14] spirits of the
[1:22:16] prophets are
[1:22:18] subject to the prophets so when I when I
[1:22:21] when I spoke early about you know uh uh
[1:22:25] uh hear the minister coming out to
[1:22:26] preach the word and you can't interrupt
[1:22:28] him you can't do it during his sermon
[1:22:31] and you can't do it before his sermon
[1:22:33] but after his sermon is it's free
[1:22:36] Hallelujah now let's let me clarify that
[1:22:39] one too if he having an altar
[1:22:42] call yes sir you don't jump up and speak
[1:22:45] in tongues during the middle of an altar
[1:22:47] call God is cuz cuz the spirit of the
[1:22:50] prophet got to be subject to the prophet
[1:22:52] and who's the prophet the minister
[1:22:53] standing in the pool at the time is the
[1:22:56] prophet
[1:22:58] Hallelujah all right all right we just
[1:23:00] we going back to the word I'm telling
[1:23:02] you I'm saying these things because even
[1:23:04] if I'm not here and Gifts start taking
[1:23:07] off we need to know how they're supposed
[1:23:08] to be conducted yes sir amen cuz I'll be
[1:23:12] watching it according to the word all
[1:23:15] the word now I'm not saying that to buy
[1:23:17] nobody up I'm saying that to keep us in
[1:23:20] order amen amen how many would like to
[1:23:23] be in a church say in order we just we
[1:23:27] just bringing it back the Corinthians
[1:23:28] got things out of order we bringing it
[1:23:30] back in order Paul was dealing with a
[1:23:32] church that had things out of order yes
[1:23:35] sir amen amen hallelujah we trying to
[1:23:38] get it started and keep it in order yes
[1:23:40] sir true all right let me keep going let
[1:23:42] me keep going all right verse 30 uh uh
[1:23:47] 33 for God is not the author of
[1:23:52] confusion but of peace as in all
[1:23:55] churches of the Saints now watch verse
[1:23:57] 34 let your women keep silence in the
[1:24:00] churches for it is not permitted unto
[1:24:02] them to speak but they are commanded to
[1:24:04] be under obedience as also sayith the
[1:24:06] law now let's just make sure we got this
[1:24:09] clear now this scriptures Paul is not
[1:24:12] telling the sisters that they can't
[1:24:13] speak in tongues that's not what Paul is
[1:24:16] saying here what Paul is referring to
[1:24:18] here is a woman preaching yes sir
[1:24:23] Hallelujah you got to bring that back in
[1:24:25] order too because sisters are not
[1:24:27] supposed to preach the gospel but as far
[1:24:29] as operating in gifts yes the sisters
[1:24:32] can have all nine spiritual gifts they
[1:24:35] can operate in that in that area amen
[1:24:38] amen yeah a sister can have a gift of
[1:24:41] healing yes sir
[1:24:44] amen I get very shallow on that I'm
[1:24:47] might have to go back to the
[1:24:49] quote
[1:24:51] remember the sister uhhuh that was in
[1:24:55] the meeting that's right and she saw a
[1:24:58] little baby yes sir with a
[1:25:02] mother and and and she said I'mma just
[1:25:04] get the mother my seat and and and she
[1:25:07] said I couldn't get that burden off of
[1:25:09] me God kept telling me pray for the baby
[1:25:11] she said no no no brother Brandon going
[1:25:13] to pray for the baby and brother brand
[1:25:14] say like like that had anything to do
[1:25:17] with
[1:25:18] it what does it then I'm pray but no God
[1:25:21] put that burden on that sister to pray
[1:25:22] for he say he say her being a mother
[1:25:25] would be able to understand what the
[1:25:27] other mother going through that's right
[1:25:29] they give her a burden for so so she
[1:25:31] prayed for the baby when and sat down in
[1:25:33] the balcony come on through the prayer

[1:25:49] already worked the healing so gift of
[1:25:51] healing which is a gift of the spirit a
[1:25:54] sister can have that gift TR brother
[1:25:57] amen amen I'm I'm reading on I'm reading

[1:26:51] was born amen amen and my job is to make
[1:26:54] sure that we stay in line with what God
[1:26:56] wrote in the scripture and this is not
[1:26:58] Paul didn't write this because he hated
[1:27:00] women that's a lie from the pits of hell
[1:27:04] if you look in look in the scripture
[1:27:05] Paul went to certain cities it was women
[1:27:07] that was actually uh uh uh letting them
[1:27:09] stay with them and and you know and just
[1:27:11] and taking care of he's y'all y'all be a
[1:27:13] blessing to these sisters y'all do this
[1:27:14] I mean Paul Paul it wasn't that he hated
[1:27:16] women he had a mama praise God right but

[1:27:21] same thing about brother brand because
[1:27:23] he hate women no no no no no no no that

[1:27:34] go on he says what came the word of God
[1:27:36] out from you or came it in came it in uh

[1:27:42] think himself to be a prophet or
[1:27:45] spiritual let him acknowledge that the
[1:27:47] things that I write unto you are the
[1:27:49] Commandments of the Lord we're not
[1:27:51] getting away from this watch this now he
[1:27:54] says but if any man be ignorant let him

[1:36:44] God manifest himself to right the
[1:36:46] Pentecostals are to be able to come in

[1:37:07] to I want to just hit a few things
[1:37:12] here
[1:37:15] um brother brandom makes a statement he
[1:37:18] says and then at Pentecost where the
[1:37:20] church for the bride tree he set in
[1:37:23] order on Pentecost remember he planted a
[1:37:25] tree at Pentecost it says um then at
[1:37:28] Pentecost where the church for the Bri
[1:37:29] tree he set in order on Pentecost the
[1:37:32] tree that was predestinated to bring
[1:37:34] forth his fruit in the season now going
[1:37:39] fine the fruits is being done just fine
[1:37:42] it bloomed out on the day of Pentecost
[1:37:45] so the tree was planted and it bloomed
[1:37:47] out on the day of Pentecost he says
[1:37:49] let's see what happened on the day of
[1:37:52] Pentecost uh uh Jesus said the works
[1:37:54] that I do shall you do also they heal
[1:37:57] the sick now on the day let's see how it

[1:38:05] Wind Out of Heaven now uh I'm skipping
[1:38:07] down to paragraph 179 but I want to just
[1:38:11] kind of focus our attention on this what
[1:38:13] did Pentecost have for us to be restored
[1:38:17] back to it uh the question is what did
[1:38:20] Pentecost have for us to be restored

[1:38:24] Pentecost what did the day of Pentecost
[1:38:27] have amen for us to be restored back to
[1:38:30] it let's read this brother random says
[1:38:33] and here they come acting like drunk
[1:38:35] people the Bible said they did they said
[1:38:38] these men are full of new wine but Peter
[1:38:41] the spokesman the minister in in in the
[1:38:43] group stood up and said these are not
[1:38:45] full of new wine as you suppos sing is
[1:38:48] just the third hour of the day but this
[1:38:51] is that glory to God now now when when
[1:38:56] when Peter put the experience back in
[1:38:58] the scripture can I tell you something
[1:39:01] when you begin to see God move we're
[1:39:03] taking it right back to the same
[1:39:04] scripture that Peter took it to right
[1:39:06] back to
[1:39:08] Joel because that was a promise for this
[1:39:11] day look at it now it says and it shall
[1:39:14] come to pass in the last
[1:39:17] days amen saith God I'll pour out my
[1:39:22] spirit upon all flesh and your sons and
[1:39:24] daughters shall prophesy and I'll show
[1:39:27] wonders in the heaven now now look at
[1:39:29] that scripture look at that scripture
[1:39:30] your sons and daughters will prophesy
[1:39:33] now we also read in 1 Corinthians that a
[1:39:35] sister was supposed to speak well what
[1:39:37] do it not preach but it didn't say she
[1:39:40] wouldn't
[1:39:41] prophesy amen all right says and it
[1:39:44] shall come to pass that whosoever shall
[1:39:46] call upon the name of the Lord shall be
[1:39:49] saved brother brand say now Peter
[1:39:52] preached on P cost after the same
[1:39:54] Prophet that I'm preaching today and
[1:39:56] talk about Joel today about planting
[1:40:00] this tree and that's where he planted it
[1:40:02] oh it's done fine they went out and had
[1:40:04] spiritual gifts they healed the sick
[1:40:06] they preached they was throw in jail
[1:40:08] they were willing to suffer for the
[1:40:09] word's sake now my question is what did
[1:40:14] Pentecost the day of Pentecost have for
[1:40:16] us to be restored back to it here are
[1:40:19] some things that Pentecost had brother
[1:40:21] brandham just made a comment here says
[1:40:23] because they were thrown in
[1:40:25] jail they prayed for boldness to speak
[1:40:28] the word and that signs and wonders
[1:40:29] would be done by the name of the holy
[1:40:31] Child Jesus right and after they prayed
[1:40:34] in the book of Acts said the place was
[1:40:36] shaken we are praying church right yes
[1:40:39] sir amen the place was shaken Paul and
[1:40:41] Silas prayed in the Philippian jail and
[1:40:43] God shook the foundations with an
[1:40:45] earthquake right Peter was delivered by
[1:40:48] an Angel when he was placed in jail so
[1:40:50] there after Pentecost yeah they had a
[1:40:52] lot of Believers that was thrown in jail
[1:40:54] but God shook the place while they were
[1:40:56] in jail am some of the other things that
[1:40:58] we found that Pentecost had that we need
[1:41:01] to be restored back to one of the things
[1:41:02] that Pentecost had was
[1:41:06] Oneness yes sir that's it
[1:41:09] oness amen and and the Bible actually
[1:41:12] said that they were in one mind and in
[1:41:15] one Accord and other thing that we've
[1:41:17] learned in this journey is that the
[1:41:19] Palmer worm he ate the Brotherly Love
[1:41:23] from from the church amen but when this
[1:41:26] comes back it brings the brotherly love
[1:41:28] right back in so it brings us Oneness
[1:41:31] Pentecost had Oneness yes sir we're
[1:41:33] going to have the same thing that's why
[1:41:35] it's been preached like this amen the
[1:41:37] other thing they had was a was a sudden
[1:41:40] sound like a mighty Russian wind now I
[1:41:44] want you to get this because it was a
[1:41:46] sudden
[1:41:48] sound nobody
[1:41:50] knew when it was coming M but it
[1:41:55] came and and and now I'm not going to
[1:41:57] say we're going to sit here and a wind
[1:41:59] going to come no no no but I will tell
[1:42:01] you this it going to be sudden and you
[1:42:04] you ain't going to know when it's going
[1:42:05] to come but when it does come you
[1:42:07] already have been taught to know what to
[1:42:10] expect and what to do when it does come
[1:42:12] right it's okay we all worshiping and
[1:42:15] praising God but if you hear somebody
[1:42:17] start speaking in tongues you know what
[1:42:18] you do let your
[1:42:19] praise go
[1:42:21] down just just just go down don't start
[1:42:24] yelling and screaming over the tongues
[1:42:25] God trying to speak to us yes sir we
[1:42:27] don't want confusion but let your praise
[1:42:29] go down oh and now you start turning
[1:42:30] your praise to a prayer God speak give
[1:42:33] somebody interpretation Lord we want to
[1:42:34] hear what you're trying to say to us

[1:47:22] Holy ghost the Bible says that they
[1:47:25] spoke in other tongues as the
[1:47:28] spirit gave them utterance these are the
[1:47:31] things that Pentecost had that we're
[1:47:32] looking for and here's the other thing I
[1:47:34] want to talk about in this miracle
[1:47:37] Pentecost when they spoke in uh in
[1:47:41] unknown tongues the miracle is that they
[1:47:43] the people understood them in their
[1:47:46] native language right
[1:47:49] right and I said this we we got multiple
[1:47:55] languages represented in this
[1:47:58] church English is a native language
[1:48:01] Creole is a native language Spanish is a
[1:48:05] native language shaa is a native
[1:48:09] language Africans is a native language
[1:48:13] TW is a native language so God can do
[1:48:16] the same thing that he did at Pentecost
[1:48:18] right here in this midst that's the
[1:48:21] truth brother amen
[1:48:24] one of y'all take off and speaking in
[1:48:25] shonah don't even know what you speaking

[1:48:37] know it's twe and brother Quake we have
[1:48:38] to tell you that's
[1:48:40] twe Hallelujah right glory to God look
[1:48:45] look look look look look look look at
[1:48:47] what I'm GNA give you a couple quotes
[1:48:48] here I want
[1:48:49] to be certain of God brother brandom
[1:48:53] brother brandom went through this in his
[1:48:56] in his own Ministry he he was his native
[1:48:59] language was
[1:49:01] English but he was praying for a sister
[1:49:03] she heard him in
[1:49:05] Spanish look at this this is the miracle
[1:49:08] of Pentecost says well I asked her a few
[1:49:11] questions and she began answering me
[1:49:14] through The Interpreter then all of a
[1:49:16] sudden the vision come and I said I see
[1:49:19] before me a little girl with little
[1:49:21] platted hair hanging down her back she's
[1:49:24] sitting by an old fireplace eating
[1:49:26] yellow corn from a
[1:49:28] cob that's been took from a kettle which
[1:49:31] hangs over the fireplace and watch this
[1:49:34] now and she's eaten too much of
[1:49:37] it too much corn she eat too much of it
[1:49:41] amen she falls violently ill and she's
[1:49:44] taken to the bed by her mother and is
[1:49:48] thrown into epilepsy and then the vision
[1:49:51] left and little girl turned to The
[1:49:53] Interpreter and said in Spanish I
[1:49:56] thought he couldn't speak
[1:50:01] Spanish and The Interpreter said you
[1:50:05] spoke English did you not brother
[1:50:06] brandom I said I
[1:50:08] did he said well she said you spoke
[1:50:13] Spanish I said stop the recorders all
[1:50:17] along the road and they stopped and we
[1:50:20] played it back and every word was
[1:50:22] English
[1:50:22] [Music]
[1:50:24] Hallelujah and then we had to repeat
[1:50:27] what I we had her to repeat what I said
[1:50:31] and as long as the vision was going on
[1:50:33] she heard every word in
[1:50:37] English she speaks Spanish and only
[1:50:40] speak Spanish but she heard while

[1:55:42] and knock at the door and I said Billy I
[1:55:44] can't go

[1:59:00] one interceding on behalf of somebody
[1:59:03] else and doing it in their
[1:59:11] language look just just kept real still
[1:59:13] not knowing one thing I had no more
[1:59:16] control of what I was saying than
[1:59:19] nothing see this is this is this is I
[1:59:21] I've been yeah I've been wanting to

[1:59:38] trying to hold it and and the Holy
[1:59:40] Spirit just took off in tongues amen
[1:59:43] there uh and and and while while we were
[1:59:46] getting ready to pray and and you know
[1:59:48] when God does something like that that's
[1:59:50] not a time to well we want an
[1:59:52] interpretation that was a different
[1:59:54] setting yeah yeah in in the church when
[1:59:57] we all together yes the interpretation
[1:59:59] but if you at home and somebody take off
[2:00:01] and tongu don't be sitting there we want

[2:00:15] brother Brandon Mak this I had no more
[2:00:18] control I'm going tell y'all something
[2:00:22] we've had too much
[2:00:24] control we've had too much control and
[2:00:28] this is why we don't see God doing what
[2:00:30] he wants to do he planted a
[2:00:34] tree and he going to get fruit off his
[2:00:36] tree and you know when it's going to
[2:00:37] come forth in his
[2:00:40] season it's his fruit coming forth in
[2:00:42] his season and it's the season that when
[2:00:44] the prophet is bringing these truths to
[2:00:46] us I'm telling you the word has been
[2:00:47] restored yes sir here we go let's let me
[2:00:51] just finish this
[2:00:54] I was one doing the talk and it was me

[2:01:00] of what I was saying than nothing not
[2:01:03] not one thing I was saying not a thing
[2:01:05] my mouth was moving I was speaking some
[2:01:08] kind of language I just held real still

[2:01:21] from having this great burden to not
[2:01:24] being so happy says I don't know why but

[2:01:42] that uh that I was just late and he he
[2:01:44] he's seen I've been weeping he said
[2:01:46] what's the matter I said nothing and I
[2:01:49] went on in just about 10 minutes a woman
[2:01:52] come in at the back of the auditorium
[2:01:54] and she was about to take the the place
[2:01:56] back there and and when we checked up
[2:01:58] with the woman to find out she was on
[2:02:00] her Road Twin Cities St L St Paul in
[2:02:03] Minneapolis somewhere one of those
[2:02:05] cities uh one of those and she was so
[2:02:07] bad with TB to the ambulance would not

[2:02:20] Chevrolet car and took the back seat out
[2:02:24] and fixed her a c in there some way this

[2:02:42] the way here for me not to be able to
[2:02:43] get inside the house and and get get a
[2:02:46] piece of this pass me some
[2:02:48] pie amen yes sir he told him go up to
[2:02:52] the roof and tear this roof off and drop
[2:02:54] me down into the presence of God and
[2:02:57] that man received his healing the
[2:02:58] service was interrupted that man got his
[2:03:01] healing from Jesus sir amen look at
[2:03:05] this it says um uh they they they they
[2:03:10] Brethren got an old chevrol car and took
[2:03:12] the back seat out and fixed her cotton
[2:03:14] there some way and or bed and laid her
[2:03:17] on it and was bringing her to the uh to
[2:03:18] the meeting she wanted to come the
[2:03:21] doctor doctor had give her up and on the
[2:03:24] road over they they told her uh the
[2:03:26] least little bump she'd go into hemorage
[2:03:30] and uh and that's and she went and and
[2:03:33] she went into Hemorrhage and they had
[2:03:35] taken her out and laid her on a grass a
[2:03:37] plat and the Saints was standing there
[2:03:39] praying over the woman and uh and and
[2:03:42] every time she breathed just gurgling
[2:03:44] the blood would blow out of her mouth
[2:03:45] like that all of a sudden she was
[2:03:48] instantly healed and she jumped back
[2:03:51] back I mean she jumped up from there and
[2:03:53] started rejoicing come on to the church
[2:03:56] and there she was back there testifying
[2:03:58] back in the back I said what time was
[2:04:00] that and when she gave the time of what
[2:04:03] time it was it was the very same time
[2:04:07] that the speaking was going through me
[2:04:09] well what was it it was the Holy Spirit
[2:04:11] making intercessions for that woman
[2:04:14] there see what I
[2:04:16] mean
[2:04:20] hallu and let me tell tell you when he
[2:04:22] start speaking in this language that he
[2:04:24] didn't know he was actually speaking
[2:04:25] that lady's
[2:04:27] language l interceding in her language
[2:04:31] for
[2:04:34] her look look look look look this God
[2:04:37] did not
[2:04:40] die when the prophet died and I don't
[2:04:43] I'm I hate to say it like this but
[2:04:45] nobody going to be able to shake me from
[2:04:48] these things being in the church I I I
[2:04:51] believe brother brandom shared these
[2:04:53] testimonies with a purpose sir and and
[2:04:56] and and he show laid it out just right
[2:04:58] for us so all we got to do is just align
[2:05:00] ourselves according to this he he took
[2:05:02] us right back to what Paul said and we
[2:05:04] align ourselves to what the scripture
[2:05:05] said what this message is saying we're
[2:05:07] going to be just fine it won't get out
[2:05:09] of order it won't go into chaos because
[2:05:12] we know what to expect and I wouldn't
[2:05:14] have to get up here and rebuke people
[2:05:16] now you know you did too much I wouldn't
[2:05:18] have to do that because you already know
[2:05:19] what the word says and the spirit of the
[2:05:24] prophets subject to the prophets all I
[2:05:28] can tell
[2:05:30] you

[2:20:23] amen the name spirit and Truth is not
[2:20:26] just a
[2:20:27] name it's what the Lord desires for
[2:20:31] us he desires
[2:20:33] balance and I believe that's what we
[2:20:35] received this morning a teaching on
[2:20:38] balance on how to yield and allow the
[2:20:42] spirit to move as he desires to
[2:20:46] move takes us all to be
[2:20:49] sensitive takes us to be in
[2:20:52] Oneness I was thinking his brother Jack
[2:20:54] was saying suddenly that when will come
[2:20:58] there was a message that brother brandom
[2:21:00] actually preached once and it was called
[2:21:02] Oneness of
[2:21:04] unity and in that
[2:21:06] sermon the wind came in the building you
[2:21:09] could hear it come
[2:21:11] in and then there was a voice that came
[2:21:13] out of that wind said I am God the
[2:21:16] literal voice of almighty God
[2:21:19] capture
[2:21:23] audio and the people was not in Oneness
[2:21:26] or God could have really did something
[2:21:28] at that time brother Brandon was trying
[2:21:29] to break through to get the people to
[2:21:32] realize that the Living God was here how
[2:21:35] much more can God come in here with his
[2:21:38] his presence just Sweeping in here
[2:21:41] coming across everybody that's in
[2:21:43] Oneness people that believe and not
[2:21:45] bucking against what the prophet is
[2:21:48] teaching God wants to move move in our
[2:21:51] midst he's not a mute God he has a lot
[2:21:54] to
