here i wanted my wife to be here uh when i gave this testimony uh and i just didn't quite have the words um uh uh just at the time uh to just kind of put it all together um many of you know the lord has blessed us with a new home and uh but i just want to i just want to testify i read the scripture this morning deuteronomy 28 without hearkening to the voice of the lord and do uh his will that you'll be blessed your storehouse will be blessed probably about well over 10 years ago some time my wife and i um walked away now y'all forgive me if i get choked up i'ma cry baby anyway you know the morales call me the crying deacon so uh but uh you know and and uh see let me tell you something when you walk away from the lord you know uh you you he gonna take care of you but you walk out of the you you walk out when you walk out of your blessings you see you think you're going alone see the rich young ruler you know he got his opportunity he thought everything was fine but it really wasn't and see what what it's a slow it's a slow decline and what began to happen we began you know the devil just came in and just started tearing down what what what the lord had built see when you begin to get to a point where you think it's you you know uh you're making a big mistake and everything that we had accomplished as a family and and and and and things we realize it was the blessings of the lord but the bible says i will restore see one of the things with but my wife and i even know we we we we never lost faith you know many times we would talk and and i spoke it a lot of times i said sometimes you'll get out there so far you don't know how to get back because see the devil you know he got you out there on that limb and and and he fighting now you got to fight over all kind of things to get back and say but the lord will bring you back if you humble yourself and hearken unto the voices of god see and i'm just grateful you know i'm grateful for the house but i'm grateful from where he brought us from see and the thing of it is is is is i was looking at the house and and i'm sharing that with my wife i said i mean i said we have now we had a nice house we didn't know how we had to put a little money into it and things like that and we lost it that's you know and and when we we lost the house and everything i said well lord he provide provided thank god he provided a roof over our head kept moving and i said what the lord gives the lord take it away but when he restore i say lord how you going how you how you did better i'm looking around and i'm saying like i'm i told my wife just this morning i said it still ain't sunk in what the lord did and it was listen it was all god it was all god the timing of when to everything on how it came we i don't i don't want a prolonged testimony but i ain't gonna leave nothing now we we we we we had a contract or a building on another house and the house we we actually overbid on the house because we wanted it and and they were supposed to have a showing and we said tell you what we gonna over offer 50 000 over for you to cancel the showing and just take our bid lady said no so my wife said okay well we'll keep looking the very next day this house came on the market now this house was already on the market we went to the realtor and said that we want to take this one a bit off of this and put it on this she said there's multiple bids on that house there's no way you're going to get this house my wife said do it anyway do it anyway multiple people a few days later i hear a scream in the house i'm out talking with the neighbor troy come in came in the house she said you ain't gonna believe this i say why she said sit down i said girl just tell me what ain't sitting down tell me what she said he accepted our offer out of all the other offers [Applause] now the beautiful thing about this 12 years or 15 years or so before that we lost a house had to walk away from it but this house was already in history we just had to get back in our place and walk into the manifestation of it you hear what i say i say when we lost that house this house was already there this house was already waiting it was already built the ownership of this house was already written in history we just had to walk into the manifestation you can't go wrong by serving god i read the scripture for a reason if i was talking to the voice and diligently seek him you will be blessed now i'm not that i i'm grateful for the house but the house is gonna decay but what i'm grateful for is you're restoring my house [Applause] we're restoring this house and he put this house in a house amen so i thank god this morning i have a reason something to thank god for amen i thank him for the brick and mortar amen but i thank him for the word of god amen and for his restoring power amen to turn me around amen give me a way back he built the bridge back to restore me from where i once was amen to where i'm at and

as they make their way back home amen but it's good to see all the saints out here uh today in the house of god so let's have church while we're here let's just enjoy the presence of the lord and brother joseph appreciate that song this morning me cortisone god bless you amen my heart my heart so uh praise the lord let's go back here to acts chapter 2 and reading from verse 14. it says but peter standing up with the leaven lifted up his voice and said unto them the men of judea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel uh and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out my pour out of my spirit amen hallelujah pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old man shall dream dreams you know i come out here and i'm in this series and i'm just reading and amen sometimes it seems like that's all we're doing is just reading uh but this is prophecy uh that is being spoken over us in this season all right and i want us to get this you know that just i want i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna read this don't let y'all be see this be seated but i gotta share something with you uh says in your your old menstrual dream dreams and and all my servants and all my handmaids i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and i will show wonders in heaven above and signs and earth beneath blood and fire and vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved amen the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word amen let's just pray over the word of god father we thank you for uh all that you have done thus far in the service and just appreciate uh lord how you have just blessed the church and the church is able to keep moving on uh even when we have a majority of the saints uh out we pray god that you give traveling mercies to them as they all make their way back thank you for uh the the wedding that took place on yesterday um brother william and sister ailey i'll just thank you for what you've done there with that couple and actually your blessings would be upon them and uh god just thank you brother troy able to just kind of slip right in and keep things going and uh sister bernice able to slip right in keep things going and the saints just come on into the house of god expecting you to move and lord just appreciate all that you're doing in our midst god we know that you are at work thank you for the testimony we heard from brother troy and how you bless him and sister tanya and god how he uh clearly can see us we're grateful for the the material blessing but god the spiritual blessing is what released the material blessing so god i pray that people would catch what he was speaking and there are many that are tuned in and lord may be afraid to come to the house of god just maybe feeling the same thing that he was feeling but god as you allowed him to break free from that fear god i pray that others would also break free from the fear that the enemy has placed in their life and they're trying to find all kind of things to substitute a man church for and but god there's uh there's a a promise over them and they can never get away from that promise so i pray that you go after your children that you bring them forth lord from the east the west the north the south wherever they are god bring them forth and may the spirit of god uh continue to deal with their hearts lord don't let them get rest amen at night give them dreams that would shaken god at their core and we just trust lord jesus that you would get all the glory and all the honor from restoring your people so we believe this is the hour of restoration and father we're on the expectation for you to do uh you've already been doing great things but father we know you got more that you want to do it's in jesus name that we pray amen amen amen god bless you uh you can be seated in the presence of the lord we are continuing our journey a man with the uh the fifth junction uh uh here and um like i said and there's a number of things that that that that that can be shared the prophet told us that this was one of the main junctions and uh you know so i wanted to uh just kind of get into a few things here today if we can uh but i like i mentioned uh so that i don't forget this uh we're reading the scripture and um we read acts 2 and verse 17 says and it shall come to pass in the last days that that's this time in which we're living in right now and the last day says god i will pour out of my spirit praise god upon all flesh church i'm on the expectation for this amen all flesh who says that your sons and your daughters shall prophesy praise god this is what he says and then it says in your young men shall see visions praise god and then it says your old men shall dream dreams now i know for myself i uh i've passed 50 and i still try to consider myself a young man glory to god but the bible said your old man shall dream dreams and uh you know so i have to be able to accept that part of the word too and uh you know early this this week i was you know we went there to the pantry and i wasn't gonna say anything but it just i just felt impressed to uh to say something you know there at the pantry i was uh brother quentin that kind of walked in and said brother quentin you know um and i don't dream often i said but you know i had a dream um the uh the other night and i had a dream that you walked up to me and said pastor uh it's all done the church is all settled he'll go the keys to it i said i had that dream brother quentin that you you walked up to me like that you know and he said what he said i had a dream old men shall dream drinks see my dream happened on the 15th and his dream happened on the 12th and we both weren't going to say nothing right but when i said something he said i had a dream on the 12th that i walked up to you and i handed you keith said it was done pastor so in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established hallelujah the bible declared that the old men would dream dreams glory to god amen i'm looking for the supernatural at the junction church hallelujah i i am here under expectation looking for the miraculous miraculous is things that only god could do hallelujah not it's not things that we can do but things that only god could do only god could open up a red sea only god could allow the children of israel to cross on dry land only god could shut the mouth of lions praise god only god could take the fire out a man of a fiery furnace only god can do things like that and that god still lives today amen so at this junction i'm expecting the miraculous now i could just come out here and act like it ain't like like you know sometimes you just don't want to say nothing until it happened that ain't the god we serve we bake cakes first before the manifestation hallelujah we get an action first before the manifestation so i'm telling god gave me that as a dream and he gave it to him and three days apart the dreams came and brother and the reason that brother clinton is saying let me say he says the reason he's saying nothing say i was just praying and asking god to give a confirmation so when i come out and said he said that was his confirmation three days later he come the confirmation god gave me the same dream well we walking into it anyway it's been released in the atmosphere and i said it last week i'm gonna say it again this week brother jack somebody might ask the quest brother jack how's it gonna happen glory to god i don't know and i don't care hallelujah somebody glory glory glory i ain't got time to explain nothing the supernatural is happening in our midst so i'm going to just claim the supernatural hallelujah my god my god my god i don't know and i don't care i'm just on the expectation church glory hallelujah hallelujah amen omnipotence is speaking in our midst all right so let me uh let me uh just kind of pick up a few things here um you know i'm i'm i'm i'm going to just kind of uh skip right into something i think uh you know i usually try to set you all up but i'm going to just skip right into something um let's pick up i told you there were this this fifth junction there were so many miracles we couldn't get them off but but at a junction you're supposed to see miracles you're supposed to see miracles it happens at every junction right and uh you know and and as i'm as i'm i'm bringing uh this fifth junction you know they in scripture they recorded about you know just this website i went to they recorded 39 miracles because jesus amen um uh representing the grace of god came at the fifth junction and brother branham said it was one of the greatest junctions of course it would be one of the greatest so one of the main junctures because of jesus coming right his first coming but so many miracles that he performed uh we uh we want to just kind of just pick up one out of mark chapter two let's just go straight to mark chapter two glory glory glory hallelujah amen starting here at verse one thank you jesus and i have a you know just a couple other things that i want to kind of bring here to talk about our lord and uh and we'll just see where where it goes but mark chapter two amen thank you jesus look at this verse one says and again he entered into capernaum now i have to just stop there just for a moment to make sure we're on the same page the first miracle that jesus performed um was the miracle of turning the water into wine now let me put it this way the first one recorded can i put it that way the first one that's recorded because the way that jesus mother approached him amen when he was turning the water into wine uh his mother approached him asked him saying now these people don't ran out of wine hallelujah she knew who to go to come on church hey man the mama knew who to go to now why would the mama have confidence that jesus could turn this situation around hallelujah that by jesus being present look y'all you know look uh maybe the mama said y'all ain't got nothing to worry about and don't worry what you mean mary i mean all the wine going and this that you ain't got nothing to worry about what you what what mary come on now what you trying to say my son is here jesus is here hallelujah y'all ain't got nothing to worry about well just give me a few minutes to go talk to jesus and she approached jesus saying i ain't got no more why is there anything you can do and he said it's not even my time yet woman he didn't call her mama he said it's not my time yet woman he said say he said what you want me to do so i don't whatever you can do now i believe mary must have saw something at her house in for in order for her to have the confidence that jesus could turn this situation around there had to be some other miracles that had not been recorded in scripture for mary to be able to approach jesus like that with that type of confidence knowing that things was getting ready to change in this family you say say just please please uh just do something to say okay just give me some water pops give me some water pots give me this give me that and there he just bypass processes and turn water right into wine i say praise god praise god you know but here here we have this uh supernatural happening in canaan well uh there was a man a nobleman there in canaan that saw the supernatural occur glory to god and this this snowman said you know i got a son that's at home sick we talked about on last week say the nobleman uh he said he said i got a son at home sick and said sir would you come with me to capernaum because that's where my son at you know just please come to me and say say now look you know you ain't gonna believe just you unless you just see miracles anyway that's that's really what you all know he said sir i don't have time to argue back and forth and say but my son is at home dying and i need you to come i i'm not here to get one of the priests i'm not here to get anybody else one of the leaders i want you to come to my house because if you come jesus and no situation the situation gonna change hallelujah we gotta be able to get jesus involved hallelujah we don't try to do too much ourselves let's get jesus involved when jesus gets involved things begin to change hear this man say say uh if you would just come you know i believe my son and we may hold jesus say look uh go find your son i mean you want your son a whole go find them the way that you want them jesus never even went to the man's house jesus just said the word and and i was just you know on last sunday brother troy just kind of was picking up and and carrying it on with it and i said i say he said he said notice the the boy got his healing because his daddy was in the presence come on somebody the boy wasn't even there making a request for himself but the boy got his healing because his daddy was in the presence of the lord jesus because his daddy was making the request glory to god somebody that that reminds me of hattie right had it right her voice didn't want nothing to do with the lord jesus but because hattie wright was in the right place at the right time making the right request god honor her faith mamas and daddies i want to tell you that same god lives today hallelujah it's what you ask of jesus it's what you request of jesus it's by you coming into the presence of jesus that your family can be quick into life i believe that with all my heart glory to god that boy is at home dying but his daddy was in the presence of jesus and his daddy received a word from omnipotence brother branham told us that omnipotence was finally made flesh this god we read about this god we heard about this god is now in the flesh in the form of the lord jesus christ now let's pick him up again we see the nobleman's son was in capernaum his bow is made whole glory to god we also found out last week in capernaum that there was a man that came to church with unclean spirits glory to god but you know that man might have come one way but he didn't leave the same way he came hallelujah and i'm under expectation that the people of god might come into the house one way but you will not leave the same way you came hallelujah if you came sick you're leaving here healed if you can't bow you're leaving here free glory to god the people of god will not come to church and leave the same way they came that man could not leave the same way he came those spirits was evicted that day hallelujah it's time for the devil to be evicted in somebody's life amen amen amen so now we're picking him up he's back in capernaum again now look at what happens here in capernaum because you're not not now you gotta understand what all these miracles happen in capernaum you can see the word just begin to spread the word began to spread amongst the people jesus did that jesus did this and jesus did that and so you know no no brother so and so he was in he was having unclean spirits autumn years he free now y'all you know such and such that guy was at the point of death and his daddy was in cana asking for prayer in the word came from cana all the way here to capernaum and that boy is living again he said god i mean i said you can just hear testimony after testimony and the people's faith begin to increase because of what they were hearing oh glory to god look at this now and again he entered into capernaum after some days and it was notice that he was in the house glory it was notice i'm sorry it was noise that he was in the house now can you imagine when it's noisy right jesus in that house jesus is sitting in that house oh i would want jesus in my house glory i would want the lord jesus dwelling inside of my house hallelujah it was noise that he was in the house and straightway many were gathered together in so much that there was no room to receive them no not so much as about the door uh and he preached the word unto them i wish we had the same type of problem today that jesus was in the house the people knew that he was in the house and the church would be full of folk hallelujah trying to get into the presence of the lord jesus glory look at this he says that and they come unto him bringing one sick of the palsy which was born of four this is all happening in capernaum now can you imagine you know let's just get on the scene hallelujah and just just just watch this maybe these four brothers four guys four men go to their friends and say you know what jesus is back in town and now he's he's back in capernaum you heard all the other testimonies he did this to me he did that and he did this he said he's backing down maybe that man say uh you know what uh if jesus is in town i need to be where jesus is and his friends go and say say look we're gonna carry you to church i i wish we had more friends like that amen friends that don't want to see you down in your condition that you're in friends that'll pick you up and and carry you into the presence of god because your friends have faith that if they can get you into his presence something on change in your condition man i know you've been paralyzed for years but if you can get to that service hallelujah if you can get to where jesus is you know some people in paralyzed spiritually but if they could just get to where jesus is they'll be loose from their peril that perilous that that that paralyzed state can't even get my words out but i know what i'm talking about god want to set people free naturally god want to set people free spiritually god want to set the captives free whatever the condition is god can set him free glory hallelujah glory glory glory we got to be convinced that jesus is present we got to be convinced that amen he's on the scene now we're not talking about a historical god he is moving right now glory to god look at this amen says it and they come to him coming to him bringing one sick of the palsy which was born of four amen and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press they uncovered the roof now you know we just read that but brother branham said that the friend that was being carried this man was being carried a man by his friends and the one that's actually paralyzed he's the one suggesting to his friend look he said i didn't come to just be on the outside of the house glory to god i need to get in the house i need to get this man's attention he's the only one that can help me don't let this man leave the city without seeing me this man had to get desperate about this so this man suggested to his friends say look look i know it's too crowded in the house but do me a favor take me up to the roof and when they got to the roof the bible says they aren't come at the roof can you imagine just somebody just pulling this off and and pulling that off and what they're doing whatever they can to get inside of the presence of the lord jesus they aren't coming to the roof where he was and when they had broken it up oh jesus i love that some stuff you have to break up amen in order to get into his presence you got to break up some stuff you have to disrupt some things in your life in order to get into the presence of jesus so he says and when they had broken it up they let down the bed wearing the sick of the parsley now can you imagine that the four guys that were bringing him glory to god they couldn't even get into the presence all they could do is from the rooftop watch to see what would happen can you see him just lowering this man down into the presence of jesus while he's having church while he's in service and they just luring this man down into the presence of jesus then i towed a roof off oh glory glory you see the roof is what was impending them the roof is what was stopping them from actually coming into the presence of the lord jesus whatever it is in your life that is stopping you from coming into the presence of almighty god i invite you this morning tear that thing off break it down praise god sometimes it's in relationships sometimes it's a job that will hinder you from getting into the presence of god you got to tear the roof off yourself jesus didn't tear the roof off they tore the roof off and they came into the presence of almighty god look at this in the next verse glory to god it says uh when jesus saw their faith he said unto the sick of the palsy some of my sins be forgiven thee oh this is beautiful to me because you would think that when he saw their faith he would have brought healing to the man but the first thing he did was get rid of the sin glory hallelujah and that's the first thing we need to do is get rid of the sin let the sin question get settled first and then we can take care of everything else hallelujah amen you know as we talk about the supernatural you know as god god's already doing things and as he continues to do more you know i i oh hallelujah you know let me just i don't know i don't even know if i get a chance to say this again so i'm going to say this now uh god is moving we we come here on wednesday night and uh the spirit of god just kind of hit the first quote that i read you know in that first quote you know uh brother branham says uh somebody's gonna get healed tonight he says he says i assure you somebody's gonna be healed tonight you know and he's just and just seemed like the whole church caught a hold of that and faith began to just ignite and everybody just i mean we were having bible study but it felt like a nice charge went through the church right at that moment so you know i just felt in my spirit said we're going to have a prayer line you know just invite anybody want to be brave but we're going to have a prayer line tonight right i mean it was a just like here in in mark chapter 2 it was an unusual service glory to god on on wednesday night it was an unusual service glory so you know we began uh i said i knew we were gonna have a prayer line but i say now those that are streaming this is where it gets difficult right because i'm gonna pray for the ones here but you know i can't get to you once that's that's that's streaming the service so so i said why don't you invite some believer that's near you to hey man just lay hands on if you're going through something in your body invite some believer because the bible says these signs shall follow them that believe so so so if your believer finds somebody else that believes and have them lay hands on you right now while the anointing is in the building while the anointing is going through the stream find somebody that can lay hands on you hallelujah i say i say somebody's going to be healed tonight i assure you based on what the prophet said somebody's going to be healed tonight so as we were doing that uh you know uh you know just just praying for the different ones and and i haven't heard the testimonies yet but i'm expecting to hear testimonies of what happened here on wednesday night what god did in the midst of some of the people i'm expecting to hear that i know he watched over my mama amen he already did that bringing her through her procedure i know god did that so i give him praise for that but i'm looking for the other testimonies that are coming forth from what happened here wednesday night on thursday i was there at the hospital and i got a telephone call from somebody and they said uh they said you said you were waiting for you're waiting to hear the testimony i said oh yes i sure will say we were streaming the service in tennessee we were streaming the service and and while we were streaming the service my wife has been going in and out of the doctor's office and they got they diagnosed this and they diagnosed dad and just she almost get afraid to go to the doctor because they got something else that they're gonna give her she said he said he said i i you know she was just there and said as you just began to turn into service and right at the very end of the service you begin to pray for the people that were on the stream hallelujah because i couldn't touch them oh glory to god i couldn't actually lay hands on them but glory omnipotence is still speaking we asked him on last sunday speak omnipotence and omnipotence was still speaking so i just began to pray for those that we couldn't touch but we we couldn't get there physically but the word of god could go to them it says while you were praying it says my wife just felt the anointing and the power of god just kind of come here into the into the home and she just began to lift her hands and she just began to claim her healing right there on the spot hallelujah say she was so uh uh just just uh so much pain in her body she was just on her knees just crying out for god to do something say but as you were praying say it's like healing virtue beginning to come through the line right to her glory to god says she got up a man from from the service because we cut the stream early amen when she got up from that she just began to thank god she told her husband i've been healed just says i got healed tonight i was streaming the service and and as they were praying for me i got healed of my condition tonight so he said he said he was just so overjoyed say the very next day things that she wasn't normally doing she had started doing she used to she was not really driving that much but she got in the car went to work and started doing all kinds of things he said i know my wife has been healed i'm telling you omnipotence the all-powerful god is in action now hallelujah we're not here amen just to be here praise god we're here to see the omnipotent god move on the scene whatever your need is god is here to speak to it glory glory omnipotence is still speaking he told this man he told this man to say your sins are forgiven and and now there's a purpose for for this uh uh being there jesus is trying to show the indian and his death on the cross the atonement there were two things there was what we call a dual atonement that was there so this the very same blood that brings you salvation is the very same blood that brings you healing there is a dual atonement so if you can claim your healing i mean you can claim your salvation without feeling nothing you can also claim your healing without feeling nothing you know you save you know god change your life don't let the devil take your experience from you and if you can stand on your own two feet knowing that god has changed your heart change your life stand with that same revelation when the devil attacks your body because it's the same blood it's not a different blood it's the same blood that brought you salvation is also bringing you healing to your body he was wounded for my transgressions bruised for my iniquities is a chastisement of my pieces upon him and with his stripes i am healed glory to god glory to god this is why he tells the man it says son thy sins be forgiven thee oh thank you lord jesus son thy sins be forgiven thee uh oh my and it goes on and it says uh but there were certain of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts why does this man thus speak blasphemies who can forgive sins but god god uh only now they didn't realize it was god dwelling in jesus he was god in the flesh that's why he could forgive this this man of his sins they knew that only god could do it but who is this man this is god this is omnipotence dwelling in the flesh right it says uh it says but there were certain of the scribes sitting and reason uh i'm sorry a verse said why does this man thus speak blasphemies who can forgive sins but god only and immediately when jesus perceived in his spirit that they saw reason within themselves he said unto them why read him ye these things in your hearts says whether it is easy to say to the sick of the palsy thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and take up thy bed and walk which one is easier glory to god for for jesus they were both easy and i want to tell you right now whatever you're you're going through it's easy for jesus if you just get him involved this is that's an easy problem glory to god look he says but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins he said to the sick of the palsy i say unto thee arise and take up thy bed and go thy way into thine house oh omnipotent spoke glory to god this man was trying to just get there in the presence of the lord jesus because he knew that if he got there everything would change in his situation and look at his verse 12 says and immediately he arose took up the bed and went forth before them all in so much that they were all amazed and glorified god saying we never saw it on this fashion when we love to have a service like that where we can turn say we never saw it on this fashion hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory omnipotent spoke to his situation now i want to uh just maybe catch a quote here if i can just find it oh yes lord yes lord yes lord oh my amen amen amen uh i i i have to save that one i'm okay uh yes let's uh this is out of uh life is the healer life is the healer the prophet says this wish i was twice my size he says i feel i feel so good maybe i i'll i can uh hold twice as much when i think of his goodness and his omnipotence and its power how um how the weasley little so-called spineless christian of today is afraid to step out and put god's word first and take him at his word glory it says notice jesus come to destroy the works of the devil and healing the sick he proved his messiahship he proved by seeing visions amen the world knew because he didn't take credit to himself he gave it to the father he said i can do nothing till the father shows me first what to do and he healed the sick and he raised the dead he cleansed the lepers and he proved his messiahship and the church of the living god that'll do the same today proves the messiah is good to his word and living in the church gloria i think the case of the paralytic proved that jesus both came to save and to heal he said to the boy thy sins be forgiven thee take up your bed and walk he found out what he found out that it was that it was sin glory to god so he had to get the sin question set up first before he could actually get his healing in his body and there's many a people they won't heal him but they don't want to settle the sin question first hallelujah i mean sometimes before you just pray for somebody always try to find out what their spiritual condition is glory to god make sure the same question is settled first because if they don't get the same question settled then the enemy has a right to continue to torment them let them get the sin question set up first now i want to um just kind of catch something here oh yes lord i there's a uh i want to catch another scripture there are so many miracles that he performed at this junction and and one of the others you know because they're i'm gonna read this this quote i didn't i didn't read it last week but it's uh it's here in the junction of time and i'm gonna start at paragraph e42 amen on this e-42 junction of time and i'm going to go back to another scripture after we after we read this uh it says there he walked to the grave talking about the grave of lazarus says omnipotence manifesting here among us living with us god and christ reconciling the world to himself here he lived with us god proven himself through his son christ jesus he was omnipotent and miraculous he was all-powerful and demonstrating miracles right omnipotent and miraculous and if he's the same yesterday today and forever and he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll be with you to the end of the world how can we look for anything else but when he speaks for the miraculous to happen how can we look for anything else he said how can we expect anything else so here he goes down to the grave of weeping glory and then omnipotence gathered itself together and he spoke lazarus come forth and a man that was already rottening the nose that fell from his face in four days the skin worms had done set in corruption knew its master hallelujah he give back the life of this dead man and a man that was once dead stood on his feet and lived again the miraculous i am the resurrection and the life saith god he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die what a great miracle when he stood there and called lazarus from the grave omnipotence spoke not even death could keep a man in the grave when omnipotence spoke he had power even over the death he had power over the grave he had power over these things that's the omnipotent god that we serve so brother branham says this in the next quote he says speak omnipotence glory to god that's that's i didn't get it last week but i just i went off inspiration speak omnipotence amen and i i i'm grateful that he spoke to lazarus i'm grateful that he spoke to you know many of these other uh other testimonies that were reading scripture to the noble man we we're glad we're grateful that he spoke there hallelujah but today we need him to speak again last week as we were going through this sermon and and i said speak omnipotence you know god began to speak directly to people's situations right here in the church different things that folk was going through you sometimes the preacher just thinking up there preaching no omnipotence is speaking to people he's the same yesterday today and forever he is still moving church we got to recognize when he's moving hallelujah hallelujah speak omnipotence he says miraculous will take place i believe that amen says and you always do it at the junction and we're at the junction it says be alarmed when you see these things happen we're at the end time omnipotence speaks and a dead man dead and lived again stood on the street and went to a banquet and eat supper with him oh my what happened some glorious day while we who were once dead and sin and trespasses omnipotence spoke hallelujah that goes right back to brother troy's testimony omnipotence is the one that spoke to him omnipotence is what changed the situation and i got good news if omnipot omnipotence can do it for any one of us omnipotence can do it for our loved ones glory to god all you got to do is just get into the presence of jesus you can make your request known like the nobleman did like had it right there you can make your requests known hallelujah once omnipotent speaks to that situation it is over oh i believe that with all my heart glory glory glory says i never just spoke we were going to hell and omnipotent spoke we raised from hell to glory and someday we'll eat the banquet supper at the last days omnipotence speaks god's word is omnipotent we believe it and raised from death unto life he that hears my words and believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believe with me shall never die omnipotence it says we're like noah building away on the ark the miraculous will take place someday when the rapture comes and jesus comes we're at the junction now it says when you see these things happen raise up your head your redemption's drawn not omnipotent speaks and the miraculous is done see said we we are at the junction father i must prove who you are and he raised the dead he healed the sick when the hour finally come for him to go he walked humbly to the cross and was nailed there suspended he wasn't of heaven he was rejected of heaven he was rejected on earth omnipotence spoke through the lord jesus christ and he's still speaking today amen through that same vessel i want to just kind of pick up something here in the scripture matthew 8 and uh matthew 8 verse 16. just a a a a a a word that is spoke here and i was reading this and i was just blessed by matthew 8 and verse 16 hallelujah omnipotence is still speaking glory if i can just get him involved i know my situation going to change i i know it i already know it ain't ain't no way it gonna stay the same if i get jesus involved glory hallelujah i don't care how impossible it looks once jesus once jesus shows up everything everything changed my god my god just get him involved church i'm telling you um speak omnipotence that's that's why prayer speak omnipotence amen here in matthew 8 and verse 16 it says when the even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils glory to god and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that was sick now can you imagine this so the the the part that just blesses my heart he casts out the spirits with his word speak omnipotence if you want to see spirits leave all we need is just for him to open his mouth now you got to understand something only mouth that he has today is your mouth hallelujah so if we want omnipotence to speak we're gonna have to open up our mouths and allow him to speak because spirits can be cast out oh we don't get it yet you don't have to go and fight with your family members you ain't got to wrestle with them and fuss and argue and all that let them argue you just keep speaking cause he cast out spirits with his word and he healed all that was sick now i want you to catch this because in matthew 8 there was a number of a number of of of of healings that took place and i can't read them all so i'm gonna just have to summarize them you know as we start the the chapter there in matthew 8 there was a leper a man who uh who knew again and said look uh uh you know i got this condition hallelujah and leprosy in that time was really uh it was not able to be cured you were you were you had you were in a hopeless situation if i could put it in today's terms cancer because people as soon as they hear cancer they feel like they're in a hopeless situation why do you think the angel of the lord told a prophet and notice what that he's saying say if you can get the people to believe say not even cancer why would the angel tell the prophet not even cancer because he knew what the people would be facing today you know somebody here diabetes oh okay no problem high blood pressure oh no problem cancer oh i mean people people even you know they don't even pray for you if you got diabetes right they don't it don't even hit a radar if diabetes has attacked your body a high blood pressure it don't even hit the radar but when you say cancer and and and they give it degrees come on church right there are stages they say you got fourth stage when you hear that that means you walk in death hallelujah glory to god but but i'ma tell you something i i i serve a god amen a god that controls even death we talked about how he stopped amen elizabeth from rotten in the grave but i want to talk about how a woman was going to bury her son come on somebody the widow of name she already lost her husband but now she's on the way to bury her only son but because life came in contact with death glory to god life overruled death and jesus just touched the buyer he touched the casket and the boy came up out of that casket and went home with his mama glory to god we got a god that has power over death he's omnipotent church i want to brag about him i just want to brag about jesus he's omnipotent all powerful the devil hasn't seen nobody like this and i want you i want you to know that that god that did that in bible days that god is still living inside of you we need to know who's here amen what authority we have as believers glory to god church look at this now you know so so here it is this this man with this condition leprosy say you know uh he told jesus say look if you will if you were just you know you just come lay your hands on me or something i just i believe i'll be made clean and uh it's and jesus has so much compassion saying yeah i'll do it i you know you weren't supposed to touch leopards you weren't supposed to do anything but no and and oh can you imagine i mean leprosy was something you got kicked out of the city with leprosy was something that you had to isolate yourself with huh elaborate leprosy was something that nobody wanted to be around you because it was so contagious oh i'm talking because leprosy got a different name today his name is coronavirus nobody want to be around you you got this you got no i mean anybody gonna come pray hallelujah jesus had no ppe i'm preaching jesus had no ppe he had no protection no personal protection equipment he didn't have any of that but he said yes i will make you clean i'll talking about that jesus is living inside of us no we're not supposed to be walking around in fear if there's a need we supposed to step up in a dress to meet come on church [Applause] i'm trying to summarize it but it's right here in matthew 8. hallelujah no no no jesus didn't let me get my gloves on and let me get no no no no i will i'll make it clean touch the man and say now go show yourself to the priest and and here's the other other thing i love about it it says uh you say uh jesus said unto him verse four i'm in matthew 8 and i'm at verse 4. glory to god it says and jesus said unto him see thou tell no man wait a minute wait a minute i had leprosy i had leprosy how is it that i can't tell anybody see see thou tell no man but go thy way showed myself to the priest and and and offer the gift that moses commanded for the testimony unto them now now i'm gonna tell you something jesus already knew you know uh uh pretty much what he said just don't get sidetracked my brother go do exactly what the word tell you to do but don't get sidetracked now people are gonna already know you've been healed they gonna already know there's a change that took place but don't get sidetracked go off your gift now after you finish off you can probably say whatever you want to say but make sure you don't get sidetracked glory to god because oftentimes believers we get sidetracked don't allow the enemy to sidetrack us glory don't get don't get don't get don't get don't don't get interrupted on the journey hey man you got you hey thank you sister i like that keep your focus but don't get sidetracked it's the enemy bringing this and the enemy bringing that trying to get the people of god sidetracked glory to god if you get jesus involved that will change and that will just keep him involved don't allow the enemy to get you off course glory to god amen amen amen don't don't tell no man don't go don't go say nothing they gotta know look even when you go to the priest they're gonna be the ones there wait a minute ain't this a fella how did he get how did because you know it was a priest's job to go and tell whether you was unclean or not but now when this man goes back to the priesthood with the sacrifice the priests know they had nothing to do with it well who did this jesus jesus did it jesus jesus touch you yeah he touched me oh yes he touched me something happened and now i know glory to god he touched me and he made me whole all right let me just try to keep going i i i can just use you know and when i read the scriptures i can just kind of just go go you know it's just so much in the word of god the the word is living it's a lie it it it's current uh current news glory to god we're not reading uh testimonies about something that happened years ago no this is right now glory i'ma just keep reading is it all right and look at this now here we go again and when jesus was entered into capernaum there we go again another no now we i i've given you a couple miracles that have happened in capernaum i've given you a noble man had his son healed another man went to church with spirits and he got delivered another man uh came to was in capernaum he got to the house and couldn't get into the house so he opened up the roof with his friends and he he walked away healed of a parent he had a parrot parallel a paralyzed condition let's put it that way glory to god and he was here all these things keep happening at capernaum here we go now now i'ma say something here with all these great miracles happening at capernaum you know what capernaum is today in the bottom of the ocean jesus prophesied against it he says the great things that happened here i mean the people should have been repenting after all this he said y'all didn't even repent say say you're gonna fall underneath the bottom of the sea jesus prophesied against capernaum with all these great things oh my god my god don't find yourself like the people of capernaum praise the lord amen but let's pick up this this this other event that happened at capernaum glory and when jesus was entered into capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him now now now you know i was just reading something and just a little note in my bible we know that this man is a ruler uh in the military and what they said now he was a non-commissioned officer there's something about this and i wish i had time to really talk to brother quinton before i actually you know touched on this i wish i would have had time you know talk to somebody who's been in the military i know brother quake who's been in the military you know our sister amanda been in the military praise the lord we got some military people here glory you know say but but a non-commissioned officer there's only a certain rank that you can get to as a non-income is that right your military people you can only go so high as a non-commissioned officer now your officer you're just non-commissioned you'll never make it to general you'll never make it to you know uh a colonel into that i think the highest they get is sergeant major that's what they were saying about this man he made it maybe to sergeant major but even as a sergeant major come on church i might not be general and i might not be a man colonel i might not be this i might but as a as a sergeant major i still recognize that i'm a man of authority hallelujah glory to god maybe the general don't have to listen to me maybe the colonel don't have to listen to me but i got some people that if i say go glory to god they go i got others and i say come and they come one thing i do know as a son of god and as a daughter of god i can tell the devil to go lose my family and let them go amen glory to god even moses stood up and said let my people go hallelujah you have that authority as a son or daughter of god this man recognized his position this man says something here in scripture he approaches the lord jesus said lord my servant lied at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented now now we we we're picking it up in matthew 8 but you know and the other one of the other gospels it's described a little differently and the other gospel it wasn't that this man actually came to jesus himself but what happened was that this man um you know he um he sent his servants there to the lord glory to god he sent his servants there to the lord and says look say i'm not worthy that this man should even come under my roof and i'm not even worthy to go into his presence so just you know if y'all would just go get him maybe he'll come in and pray for for his servant i really love this servant so so some of the the the man's leaders uh some of the servants they went jesus you know this man been good to the jews and this man is this this man is that please come to his house and he'll serve jesus said i'll come and go i'll come see if he's invited he'll come if he's invited he'll come glory to god wherever he's invited he'll come glory to god if you just open up and invite him lord i need you i want you to speak i want you to handle this situation i can't do this glory to god glory to god glory to god amen you know uh if you were afraid of a particular job interview that you had if you were afraid of what you were going to say when you got there and sometimes we be practicing and we just i got to do this i got to no no you know what the bible tells say he say uh it says think not what you're gonna say you know god will anoint your mouth the bible says he will give you a mouth and wisdom he'll give you a mouth and wisdom all you sometimes what you need to do is learn to listen and as you're listening then god are quickened something to say this say that say this all of a sudden you got the job and didn't even know how you got the job glory to god he'll give you a mouth and wisdom hallelujah but this man was you know this man the scripture say that you know here he was coming um you know to to uh uh he sent his servants there to jesus and jesus uh jesus okay i'll come i'll go and as the as jesus was approaching his house this is when the man steps out the house said wait wait wait wait i'm not worthy that you coming under my roof don't even don't even come just just i got something else i need you to do let's read it now now we're on the scene because this man has come out of his house and now he's approaching jesus before jesus get into the house look at this jesus said in him verse 7 i will come and heal him the ceterian answered and said lord i'm not worthy that thou should has come under my roof oh i love it i love it oh there it is church that's why we're asking for omnipotence to speak i'm nipple tense speak speak i'm nipple tense this man this man right here say he say it says uh i'm not worthy that thou should have come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed just just just just say a word you realize how powerful that is you know one word can change everything one word not not even a full paragraph not a full sentence one word can change everything so that's why we come into the presence of the lord we're looking for that one word woo glory to god glory to god look at it now it says this uh it says i speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for i am a man under authority see he recognized and he's a he's a sergeant major that's all he is he's not a high-ranking officer he's a sergeant major he said but he still recognized his place i'm a man on the authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh glory and to and to my servant do this and he do with it i listen to i was at the hospital amen and uh you know why they was kind of getting mom all prepped and ready to go and there was a lady walked out in the hallway and and uh she was saying see i slipped and i failed she's telling her her uh her co-workers i slipped and failed said you slipped and fell you fell how did you do that she say you know say i i was at home and my son uh was mopping the floor and um and i didn't realize that he mopped the floor and i walked right in on that on that wet floor and i slipped and fell she she you know you know she was a she was a uh uh let me just put it this way she was uh healthy she was healthy she was very healthy praise a healthy woman glory to god she slipped and fell and i say oh so one of the ladies say did you uh did you say your son mopped the flow she said yeah i train my boy's right they say that lady said i'll slip and fall all day long if my son was at home mopping the floor she said yeah i train my boys right they they take care of things at the house they take care of things i appreciate my boys and i'm just sitting there listening to her and she said she said i name one boy do and another boy this do this do this do this that's all they know do this mop the floor get i mean clean the dishes do it clean your room do this hallelujah hallelujah there's something to that we ought to be telling the devil do this do this lose this one let that one go do this hallelujah somebody amen lose my body amen do this this man recognized that he was a man of authority that he would tell he said i can speak to my servant do this and he do with it verse 9 glory to god uh i'm sorry verse 10 verse 10. it says uh when jesus heard it he marveled and said to them that followed verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel now i need you to understand something about this this man being a gentile actually represents what the gentile faith is supposed to be oh i ain't i i'm trying to get there this man represents what our faith is supposed to be our faith is not supposed to be somebody come lay hands on me our faith is supposed to be at a level of speak the word only speak omnipotence that's where our faith is supposed to be operating at speak the word only oh hallelujah amen amen we got to start taking but yeah i know i know i'm supposed to speak the word but no no you got to get rid of all that speak the word only watch it now watch it watch it look at this he says uh when jesus heard he said he marveled and said to them that followed can you imagine jesus marveling maybe and i could just see him looking at the disciples like now this man ain't been to one of my church services this is what i'm talking about he marveled at what the man said this man just heard about jesus but understood the authority he had a revelation of authority glory to god look at this he says uh and i have not found found so great faith no not in israel and i say unto you that many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven but the the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness there shall be weeping and national teeth he takes a moment to prophesy hallelujah but he didn't forget the man request he says and jesus said unto the centurion go thy way and ask thou hast believed because this is what you believe you believe that if i just said a word that the thing would change as thou has believed so be it done unto thee that's all omnipotent need to speak now you can you get that he never said your servant is whole he never said you know this he said only he says as you believe so be it done unto you so what's in your heart i i i ask you again what's in your heart what do you want what are you asking god for so you can leave church today and receive whatever it is that you were believing for see let me just go a little further verse 14 and when when jesus was come see look at this now the sermon was oh oh i'm sorry i did i skipped verse 13 it says and jesus said to him go that way uh and as thou has believed so be it done unto thee and his servant was healed in the self same hour now that's that this week we serve an immediate god self say mouth omnipotence when he speak things change why not go back and find your situation different let me go a little further because you know and when jesus was coming to peter's house he saw his wife's mother laid and sick of a fifa and he touched her hand see that's this is you know this is where we get these things from look speak to me touch me you know i mean you know he ain't even have to say a prayer and this is this is why we got to understand the bible tell us if we lay hands on the sick they should we that don't mean we have to even pray over him just touch him and the devil the devil is actually trying to get us to a spot where we don't want to touch nobody the devil bringing fear on us we don't want to touch nobody but but what we see here in scripture this is supposed to be manifested in and through us this is why this was an important junction it places us as the body right here here he said all the lady got a fever fever you know and now we see somebody repeating don't come to church no no you come on we got to find a balance here i want to get back to the bible days this this did he hear he said and when jesus was come into peter's house he saw his wife's mother laid and sick of a fever and he touched her hand and the fever left her and she arose and ministered unto them now when the people saw that uh when they saw this leper cleanse they saw the centurion servant hill and all this stuff happening within hours you can imagine the bloods that's going on in the city and then people said now peter's mother-in-law she's been down for me who knows how long she's been down on the street but it was only after he touched it that the fever broke fever left fever is a spirit that comes from hell but a touch can actually cause the fever you know sometimes when um when people get ill in the house or whatever like that sometimes the folk just just just touch them a little bit just let them know that you're there to take care of them you better see them through you know people start feeling better right if you you you're going i'm gonna bring you some soup and i'm gonna bring you this you know i'm gonna try to nurse you back to hell come on somebody not not not you sick well i go get myself something to eat what about getting them something to eat what about having compassion for them right right i mean jesus just showed a little compassion towards this lady just walked up and just touched him never even prayed just his compassion alone brought healing oh y'all ain't heard that you realize if you just showed a little compassion it might bring healing in your household i'ma say it again a little compassion might bring healing in your household compassion did it it's right here in the bible it just took capernaum just on fire all these things are happening capernaum and now look at what happened in verse 16. this is why i read verse 16 before when the even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and he'll all that were sick that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaiah the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bear our sicknesses that's pluralized he took on firmness and he also bore our sicknesses so if he bored i ain't got to bear it i ain't got the bear i ain't got to accept nothing that the devil said my way let me just read a couple things here and i'm going to try to bring this to a close but i just thank god we need omnipotence to speak and i believe he is speaking i want to read from the patmos vision this is uh the message that patma's vision preached in 1960. oh my speak i'm nepotism miraculous will take place and you always do at the junction he's speaking right now 1960 the patmos vision says amen the prophet says amen cut every obstacle remember you have to tear the roof off right you get you got to tear the roof off i mean get get rid of stuff break break it up break it break it up look at what the prophet said cut every obstacle from human beings that they might be connected like in the garden of eden and i love this because this this restoration uh that we're experiencing in the sounds of restoration that take us back to what the power that adam had in the beginning right that's what we're going back to glory to god uh he said and says um um connected like in the garden of eden now man i was going to choke it but i'm going to say it i'm so happy the prophet said it it says man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is it says a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent i mean a man fully surrendered to god is all-powerful do you get that a man or woman fully surrendered to god is all powerful oh yeah y'all i i don't seen it happen in my day i i i mean uh god just do some amazing things i haven't been in situations where i'm in i'm in in my car and i can see in my mirror man something getting ready to take place either somebody getting to hit me from this side or or maybe something coming up in front of me and i'm watching something and there's not not much i can do if i go to the right i'ma hit somebody if i go to the left i'ma hit somebody if i if i stop they're going to hit me in the back it's just not much i can do i only have one thing i can do there it is only one thing i can do and it's the word it's one name one name that comes out of my mouth and all i do is i only call them one time jesus and once i call his name a man fully surrendered god become omnipotent everything changed just by calling his name i haven't seen it happen too many times i'm not talking about an all-night prayer meeting i'm talking about just calling his name one time and i ain't calling his name just to call his name i'm calling cause i got confidence when i call him something's gonna change man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered god is omnipotent did not he say in mark 11 22 whatsoever things you say and you and don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you've that means that's past tense i wanna i wanna remind you you can have what you've already said hallelujah it says what happens when two omnipotents meet when god and man comes together through omnipotence then something's got to shake says whatsoever you said with that creative power of omnipotence of god knowing that he's promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power oh glory to god this is why you got to open your mouth it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met your faith has met god there he stands oh isn't he wonderful oh my oh my y'all just y'all just give me just give me a little bit i want to read just two more quotes and and and i'm i'm a close right here this is this is coming out of stats of a perfect man statue of a perfect man glory to god speak omnipotence and and i mean you we we just screaming that and praising god over it speak omnipotence but you know this morning he's screaming back at us speak omnipotence he's speaking it right back to us you are omnipotent too i made you that way my blood made you omnipotent so speak omnipotence a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent oh lord i love you look at this statue of a perfect man it says here the roman went out to meet jesus said i'm not worthy that you come under my roof and i'm not i'm not worthy and i don't count myself that way but said my son is very sick and you just speak the word see my son will live what was it distance made no difference i had to read that to you i don't care where your children are distance makes no difference hallelujah amen sometimes like i was saying on easter you expect certain family members to be there at least for easter but distance makes no difference and really for us you know we going farther than easter i want you just here for one sunday i want you here for the for the rest of your days amen like like david said i'll dwell in the house of the lord forever that's what i want to see this this makes no difference amen it says uh because god is omnipresent god is omnipotent in every way god is omnipotence is there and god being omnipresent that makes god everywhere all over sea god is just as great in germany and switzerland down in africa right this minute as he is right here oh there you are so now uh so so now he said i'm not worthy that you come to my roof to speak the word what was it it was a roman's faith he believed it and jesus said go your way your son lives and he took out two days journey the next day before he got home he met some of his servants coming and they said thy son live now brother branham just actually intertwined two stories there if you can catch it it's the nobleman and you know the uh the centurion he says uh he says and the roman was so thrilled until he said what time of day did he start getting better what part of the day he said about the 11th hour he began to amend and the roman knew that it was the very time that jesus said thy son liveth and and he had believed amen omnipotent omnipresent omniscient infinite that's god so when they when when they make a phone call and say pray that contact and your faith brings god it's the thing that brings the prayer and god together on the scene prayer faith changes from here to here it brings it together look it says speak the word oh um it says a speaker all i want you to do is say the word speak the word all i want you to do is say the word and everything is all right see he didn't have to be there just say the words why god is omnipresent he's all powerful he's just as powerful beneath the world as he is on top of the world on either side he's god and the only thing you have to do is just speak the word he said and now faith does and faith does the rest of it faith does the rest so you must have faith for a foundation all christianity all you are all you ever be is based upon faith in the word that's the reason i believe the word see the last quote i want to read is coming out of church age book the patmos vision and church age book speak omnipotence speak omnipotence see matthew 8 just kind of turns the the the the picture for us just a little bit because this man when he he recognized authority that he had he put it so jesus you got the same authority brother ramsay that's the same type of faith that we're supposed to have that's gentile faith here patma's vision he says this don't fear john john in the book of revelation was representing the bride representing us right don't fear john don't fear little flock this is all that i am you are heir to oh i love this all that i am you are heir too since all my power is yours my omnipotence my omnipotence is yours my omnipotence it belongs to you as the bride of christ this is for you this is why he can cry out to you speak omnipotence but first you must be fully surrendered to him hallelujah if you want to operate an exercise in this you must become fully surrendered to the lord jesus christ god whatever you want i want to that's what i want yo your will is my will your your ways is my ways your people is my people hallelujah she says my omnipotence is yours as i stand in your midst i have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and it's yours to use you speak the word and i will perform it that is my covenant and it can never fail lord i praise you lord i praise you thank you god let's pray church father we just thank you for your word jesus lord this word changes us this word does something on the inside of us god father we uh we can never be the same lord we hear words of of this magnitude it transforms us makes us into the very image that you had in your mind god we don't look at our troubles and struggles the same way anymore we realize that one word can change it all we realize god also that we have to be uh patient and sometimes just wait on you and remember lord the uh disciples got themselves in a situation where they saw a demon just tormenting tormenting them and giving them all kind of trouble but they had to wait to speak the word and god when they spoke it that demon left that man was set free from that father uh we're we're we're we're yielding ourselves to you we're yielding our our thoughts we're yielding our actions we're yielding our reactions we're yielding everything because we want you or god to to use us for your glory the only hand you have of our hands the only feat you have is our feet the only mouth you have today is our mouth speak omnipotence we ask that you would speak speak to us and speak through us god that things would change anoint us a fresh father anoint us we yield lord we surrender uh we surrender everything to you god just asking that you would just view it move lord in our midst god we're at a junction we're at a time where change must take place god we can't we can't stand to see the conditions the way they are just as these different ones that we read in scripture they couldn't stand to see the condition the way it was they needed to see a change this man that was uh paralyzed that his friends wanted to see a change lord the father the nobleman that that went to he wanted to see a change in his son oh god we're people that want to see a change lord god the the man that that had a lord a a conditioned lord of leprosy he wanted to see a change you're the same today as you were back then not only that lord you you you even gave a promise in your word that greater works than these shall you do for i go into my father he left it for us oh god we rise up to accept the responsibility as we leave here lord don't let this be another sermon but let it become a manifestation in our lives that we will speak as you have spoken to us and through us [Music] oh it's in jesus name let's give the lord jesus a hand of praise [Applause] [Music] praise the lord i want to just do a little something different brother smiling might have you come and just close out the service for us on today and church i i just want to encourage your hearts i want to encourage your heart speak speak omnipotence speak don't cry speak hallelujah glory to god amen god bless you church [Music] man let's get a lot of hand to praise this morning hey man amen amen amen i tell you what i was i was just sitting back there and i was i was just thinking to myself you know if we could just catch the revelation of what's being said in this hour uh i i think this this the hour that we're living in is definitely different than what we you know even lived in the past where we lived in 2020 i believe god is just trying to move us right into something you know i'm reminded of a statement that uh brother robledo made years and years ago i always hold on to that and uh he said sometimes you gotta say things you know a hundred times before we get if we can ever get what brother jack is preaching man we gonna be a powerful pop just to think that we get this understanding who am i man i'm just not you know the devil tell y'all you guys y'all ain't nothing no we sons and daughters of a king amen the omnipotent god amen lives within us the power of the spoken word the same creative power that said let there

house i've been living in the one i i've been living in for 23 years and i'm tired i'm going to try to use that as a rental property but i just feel like i i can't even say i deserve it but the bible

ain't gonna preach i'm gonna let y'all go but i tell you what it it's it's a blessing in serving god you know oftentimes i meet people and and uh because because people think sometimes they giving up something by by coming in and serving god you know and sometimes you testify to people who down and everything it's like listen when i look at my life in less than six months god can turn your whole world around you you you won't even begin to believe all of the wonderful things that god can do for you in a short period of time i look back in 88 and i think you know one day i walked into a place where we was working god changed my my situation he elevated my status right because i was no longer a crack addict and that just like bam i walked in i walked in a junky and when i left that day i was a believer my life was i mean my life was changed and then by the afternoon amen i met brother troy by the afternoon brother jack because all of the young people started coming right didn't even

things of that nature and and things that uh you don't really understand because i've been in the trade for 30 some years but it's still things that you know i lack as far as my understanding in areas of what i do and uh so i'm just asking god to give me the wisdom because people they don't they don't readily just want you to know this stuff because you become their competition so i'm just believing god to uh prosper me in in what i'm doing and some other things that i got on my heart that i've long desired because uh you know construction construction it weigh on you and i'm getting older but some other things that i desire to do that it's just a desire i don't know how to do it completely it's things that i understand so i'm believing god you know and y'all believe god with me
