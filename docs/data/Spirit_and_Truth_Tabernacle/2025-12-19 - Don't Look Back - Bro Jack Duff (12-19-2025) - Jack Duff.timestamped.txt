[23:22] that Sister Linda? Thank you, Sister
[23:23] Linda. God bless you. Amen.
[23:28] Praise the Lord. Amen. Um I um
[23:35] when I heard about the youth service, I
[23:37] was just kind of debating some things. I
[23:41] know I got a lot of ministers here uh in
[23:44] the church and uh I just kind of settled
[23:47] in my spirit that you know what
[23:50] sometimes I need to preach the youth
[23:52] service and uh and I decided that I
[23:55] would do that tonight uh just to be an
[23:58] encouragement to our young people. Well,
[24:00] I want to say that I thank God for all
[24:05] of our young people. Amen. I I thank God
[24:11] for each of them. Amen. Truly. Um you
[24:15] know, I know it's not easy. Um you know,
[24:18] we live in a a world where it's not easy
[24:22] being a young person.
[24:24] uh there's so much that they they have
[24:26] to go through and and we have to you
[24:29] know uh be patient with them just kind
[24:31] of work with them uh through some of the
[24:33] things brother Brandham said uh in his
[24:35] day said I think his children it would
[24:37] be 10 times worse in their in his
[24:40] children's day than what it be in his
[24:42] day. So you can imagine it's multiplied
[24:44] even more uh even now so much uh
[24:48] temptation so much they have to fight uh
[24:51] but I will tell you that the uh the same
[24:54] thing that we use to overcome uh is the
[24:57] exact same thing that you have to use to
[25:00] overcome and that is the baptism of the
[25:04] Holy Ghost. Amen. It will give you
[25:07] strength. It'll give you power to say no
[25:10] to the devil. Amen. He He's an inside
[25:14] keeper.
[25:16] And if and and he if he can keep your
[25:18] inside, then your outside will also be
[25:22] kept. Amen. But you have to let him come
[25:26] in. When the song writer say, "Won't you
[25:27] let him in?" And they used to sing it
[25:30] like say, "Heist up your window." That
[25:33] means let up your window. Open up your
[25:36] door and won't you let the Lord in.
[25:40] Amen. Praise the Lord. We thank God for
[25:43] all things. Let us uh read a a scripture
[25:46] here. Um
[25:48] you know, let me There's I have I
[25:53] usually have a little timer, but I
[25:55] realized that my lap my iPad was running
[25:57] out of juice, so I brought my laptop and
[25:59] I don't have my timer. Uh but my my
[26:03] objective tonight was to try to preach a
[26:05] little shorter for the young people. Uh
[26:07] if I can. Uh but let's just we'll we'll
[26:10] do the best we can. Uh 8:00. All right.
[26:14] Let's look at Philippians 3 uh verse
[26:16] 10-14.
[26:21] Amen.
[26:24] The scripture reads,
[26:31] "That I may know him and the power of
[26:35] his resurrection
[26:37] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[26:39] being made conformable unto his death,
[26:43] if by any means I might attain unto the
[26:46] resurrection of the dead,
[26:50] not as though I had already attained.
[26:53] I either were already perfect, but I
[26:56] follow after if that I may apprehend
[27:00] that for which also I am apprehended of
[27:04] Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not
[27:07] myself to have apprehended, but this one
[27:10] thing I do, forgetting those things
[27:14] which are behind,
[27:16] uh, and reaching forth unto those things
[27:19] which are before. I press toward the
[27:23] mark uh for the prize of the high
[27:25] calling of God in Christ Jesus. Amen. Uh
[27:30] let us uh just bow in a word of prayer.
[27:33] Father, we are grateful for the ability
[27:37] to read the word, but we trust now that
[27:40] the Holy Spirit will come and help us to
[27:42] apply uh what we've read. May it um
[27:46] speak to us in our situations and
[27:49] circumstances uh as God we just endure
[27:53] daily. So bless Lord our time together
[27:55] here tonight. Take control over every
[27:57] thought presented and every thought
[27:59] received. It's in Jesus name we pray.
[28:02] Amen. Amen. You can be seated. Uh praise
[28:06] the Lord. Uh we want to just use for our
[28:10] title on tonight. Don't look back. Amen.
[28:15] Don't look back. Amen. And as we uh just
[28:20] reading here from uh the Apostle Paul as
[28:23] he's writing a letter to uh the
[28:26] Philippian church, he uses the language
[28:30] there in verse 13. Brethren, I count not
[28:32] myself to have apprehended, but this one
[28:34] thing I do, forgetting those things
[28:37] which are behind, and um
[28:41] uh and reaching uh forth unto the things
[28:45] which are before. When we think about
[28:47] Paul writing something like this, uh
[28:50] certainly he was a man in the Bible uh
[28:54] that would need to forget things that
[28:57] were behind him. Amen. Because Paul was
[29:01] a man that had actually persecuted the
[29:05] Christians. Uh he was um you know he was
[29:09] he was one that uh you know he he was
[29:12] happy to go and put somebody to death uh
[29:15] if they call themsel a Christian which
[29:18] you know just just understanding that uh
[29:20] young people I need you to realize that
[29:23] uh being a Christian is not supposed to
[29:26] be an easy life. Amen. Being a Christian
[29:30] uh does not mean that you won't be uh
[29:34] picked at and criticized and uh you know
[29:38] uh made fun of. Actually when you become
[29:40] a Christian these things uh the normal
[29:43] part journey uh where you'll see people
[29:46] that will differ with you and they'll
[29:48] persecute you. They uh they they'll
[29:50] they'll do all kind of things. They'll
[29:52] they'll they'll they'll they'll um you
[29:54] know do anything to try to discourage
[29:56] you from walking with God. And it's it's
[29:58] very important that you understand that
[29:59] is part of the journey. And you must uh
[30:02] guard yourself. You must prepare
[30:05] yourself, prepare your mind for the
[30:07] battle that you will endure on a
[30:09] day-to-day basis. Every time my sister
[30:12] step out in skirts, they become a
[30:14] target, you know, for criticism. Uh
[30:17] every time the brothers show up on the
[30:19] basketball court with long pants rather
[30:21] than short pants, they they become a
[30:23] target for criticism, right? And and
[30:26] people have all kind of questions and
[30:27] and here, you know, I am in my 50s and I
[30:30] just went out to play golf just a few
[30:32] weeks ago. Actually, I think it was last
[30:34] week and one of the guys asked me says,
[30:36] "Jack, do you ever wear shorts?" I say,
[30:39] "No, I don't." He says, "You never said,
[30:41] "No, I don't. I don't I don't wear
[30:43] shorts." He I said, "It's a part of my
[30:45] faith. I don't do it." He said, "Oh,
[30:47] okay. Well, I get it." He had never seen
[30:49] me do it for years. I've been around
[30:51] him. He never seen me do it. So, he was
[30:52] wondering why I didn't do it. it's a
[30:54] part of my faith. That's I just don't
[30:56] believe in doing those things. Right?
[30:57] So, so at no matter what age you are,
[31:00] you're going to have to go through
[31:01] things where you have to explain that
[31:02] this is what I believe. And if they keep
[31:05] asking questions, you can tell them why
[31:06] you believe what you believe. Right. But
[31:08] but but being a Christian, it's a target
[31:11] on our back. Amen. It it's it's it's
[31:14] something that we have to prepare
[31:16] ourselves. Amen. Uh for for everything
[31:18] that comes with it. But uh but there's a
[31:21] great reward also on the other side when
[31:23] you endure these things. Hallelujah.
[31:25] Praise God. But Paul was one when we
[31:28] look at scripture. Amen. When when he
[31:30] was one that persecuted the Christians,
[31:32] he he he he was the one that wanted to
[31:34] put them to death. So when he comes and
[31:35] he says, "I have to forget the things
[31:38] that are in my past." And and what I
[31:40] want to tell you as young people, you're
[31:42] going to make mistakes in life. You're
[31:44] going to do things that Amen. that that
[31:47] might that might make the pastor
[31:49] disappointed in you. You'll do things
[31:51] that might make your parents
[31:52] disappointed in you. You'll do things
[31:54] that might make some of your friends
[31:55] disappointing you. But you have to come
[31:57] to a spot in your own journey where you
[32:00] forget the things that are in your past.
[32:04] Hallelujah. And then it tells us to
[32:06] press towards the mark of the prize of
[32:08] the high calling of God which is in
[32:10] Christ Jesus. Now I need you to
[32:13] understand something about a press. That
[32:15] means it won't be easy.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; You gonna have to put some work in. You
[32:20] You're gonna have to put some
[32:21] determination.
[32:22] Amen. And and I want to say it like
[32:24] this. You gonna have to have a madeup
[32:26] mind.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you have a madeup mind,
[32:29] no matter what anybody say, they can't
[32:32] dissuade you. They can't persuade you.
[32:34] They can't discourage you. They can't do
[32:37] anything because you got a madeup mind
[32:39] that you're going to serve God. One
[32:41] person say, "FOR GOD I LIVE AND FOR GOD
[32:44] I WILL DIE."
[32:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; For the young people, I want to
[32:48] encourage you. You have to have a madeup
[32:50] mind. Christianity is a press. It's not
[32:54] an easy life. Luke 16:16 actually tells
[32:56] us this. Says, "The law and the prophets
[32:59] were until John, but since that time,
[33:02] the kingdom of God
[33:05] uh suffereth violence." Uh I'm I'm
[33:08] sorry. The kingdom of God is preached
[33:09] and every man presseth into it. So when
[33:12] the kingdom of God is preached, but
[33:14] every man has to press into the kingdom.
[33:16] It's very important that we understand
[33:18] it's not going to be easy. It's not
[33:20] going to be a cakewalk. It's not going
[33:21] to be a picnic. Amen. You have to press
[33:24] into the kingdom. Hallelujah. You're
[33:25] going to have to have something that you
[33:27] have overcome. And the reason you got to
[33:30] have something that you have overcome is
[33:33] because on the other end of all this
[33:35] pressing, the Lord Jesus will be
[33:37] standing there say, "Blessed is he that
[33:40] hath overcome." Right? Not not him that
[33:42] pushed it that got pushed through or
[33:44] pulled through, but he that actually
[33:46] overcame something.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. You gonna have to overcome
[33:50] drugs in your day. You have to overcome
[33:52] drinking in your day. And and I mean you
[33:54] even you even see that you know you
[33:56] don't just uh my I hate to say it like
[33:58] this but you know overcoming drinking
[34:00] even amongst message believers.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Huh? I mean it's one thing to overcome
[34:06] it out there in the world. But when I
[34:08] got people that believe the same thing I
[34:10] believe and they out drinking, I got to
[34:13] overcome THAT TOO.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Like like like they used to
[34:17] tell me when I was young, if you had
[34:19] friends and and and sometimes you had
[34:21] bad influences that were friends, they
[34:24] say IF YOUR FRIEND JUMP OFF THE BRIDGE,
[34:26] &gt;&gt; are you going to do the same thing,
[34:29] &gt;&gt; right? You got you you you going to have
[34:31] to take a stand against a friend that's
[34:33] going to jump off the bridge. And you
[34:34] tell, look, IF YOU GOING TO JUMP, THAT'S
[34:36] ON YOU. But I'm going back HOME WHERE I
[34:38] WHERE I come from. Amen. Same thing when
[34:40] it come to drinking and smoking. I DON'T
[34:42] CARE what you do AND WHAT YOUR CHURCH
[34:45] DOES. I AM NOT DOING THAT.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
[34:50] PRESS.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; It's important that you press.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; I I I I love I love Amen. I just love
[34:59] the way uh you know, Paul puts this and
[35:02] and and as we're approaching this end of
[35:04] the year, preparing for a new year, I
[35:08] simply want to encourage the young
[35:09] people, forget the things that are in
[35:11] the past.
[35:13] uh for forget the things that are in the
[35:14] past. Put put it behind you. Don't don't
[35:16] look back. Amen. At those things. Reach
[35:20] forth to the things which are before
[35:22] you. And God has so much more before
[35:25] you. And and I have to tell you like
[35:27] this. If you're still here tonight, that
[35:29] means you got victory over the devil.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; You overcame this year. You You overcame
[35:34] this year. Hallelujah. There was a lot
[35:36] you went through this year, but you you
[35:38] overcame. You're here. So, so I want you
[35:40] to just just forget about the past.
[35:43] Amen. And press towards the future and
[35:46] what God has before you.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; All right. Let's let's let's um um I
[35:52] need to change mics. Okay.
[35:57] Praise the Lord. All right. Let me just
[35:59] read a a a quote here out of questions
[36:01] and answers part two. Uh brother
[36:03] Brandham makes a statement.
[36:06] It says now Christian don't do that. It
[36:09] says uh a Christian don't try to be what
[36:12] he used to be. He's not looking where
[36:14] he's been. He's looking where he's
[36:17] going. See? See? Don't pay no attention
[36:20] to what you was then. You done lived
[36:22] that out. So uh what what all the other
[36:25] time before uh uh to December 19th, you
[36:29] done lived that out. Ain't no sense in
[36:30] trying to go back and get that. That's
[36:33] gone, right? You done lived that out. He
[36:35] he says you'll never return to it that's
[36:37] in the past. He says and any man that
[36:40] drives life's road looking through a
[36:42] rearview mirror will go to wreck. Right?
[36:44] He says and so will you on this on this
[36:47] Christian road. Don't look back what you
[36:49] was. Look what you're going to be. Paul
[36:53] said forgetting those things which are
[36:55] in the past. I press towards the mark of
[36:58] the high calling. Now I I I I I I I
[37:01] mentioned earlier you got to prepare
[37:03] yourself for rejection as a Christian.
[37:05] You got to prepare yourself for
[37:06] rejection. You got to prepare yourself
[37:09] for suffering. You got to prepare
[37:11] yourself for losing friends.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. It it comes with the territory. Uh
[37:17] because what happens is as you as you
[37:19] begin to walk in light, you begin to
[37:22] show up the darkness in your friends.
[37:24] And those friends that don't want to
[37:25] walk in light, they will walk away from
[37:27] you. So, so it's it's it's a part of the
[37:30] journey. Amen. When you become a
[37:32] believer in Christ, however, I will tell
[37:35] you this is that when you when you when
[37:37] you when you when you allow God to
[37:39] remove bad influences from your life,
[37:42] God will always send somebody else into
[37:44] your life that would be a good
[37:45] influence. Amen. Somebody can strengthen
[37:48] you and encourage you. Somebody that
[37:50] will pray with you.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I'll tell you this much.
[37:54] If you're looking to do dirt, God g I
[37:58] mean, not God, but Satan will align you
[38:00] with people in the church to do dirt
[38:03] with.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; But if you really want to be right with
[38:06] God,
[38:07] &gt;&gt; if you really want to serve God with all
[38:09] of your heart and you will take a stand
[38:11] for Christ, God will give you friends
[38:14] that will also support you in that
[38:16] manner. And let me tell you, sometimes
[38:18] your friends are not limited to the
[38:20] people that you see. Amen. On a everyday
[38:22] basis or every week basis when you come
[38:25] to church, God will give you friends all
[38:27] around the world.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT FOLLOWERS. I'M
[38:31] TALKING ABOUT FRIENDS.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[38:34] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE THAT WILL PRAY WITH YOU. PEOPLE
[38:37] THAT YOU CAN CONFIDE IN AND THEY
[38:39] UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.
[38:40] PEOPLE THAT WILL ADVISE YOU TO DO THE
[38:42] RIGHT THINGS.
[38:44] GOD WILL PUT PEOPLE LIKE THAT in your
[38:46] life.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; People that can speak truth into you and
[38:50] people that are not afraid for you to
[38:51] speak truth back into them.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; You must prepare yourself for rejection.
[38:57] You must prepare yourself for suffering.
[38:59] Amen. These are things that you must
[39:01] overcome. And and and and I mentioned it
[39:03] earlier. I'll say it again. To not look
[39:05] back, Amen. is to uh is to have a madeup
[39:10] mind. That's a old time term that we
[39:13] used to we used to use. Young people, do
[39:17] me a favor. Just look at your neighbor.
[39:19] Young people, look at your neighbor.
[39:21] Say, "I got a madeup mind.
[39:25] I got a madeup mind.
[39:28] I got a madeup mind."
[39:30] You know, they used to sing a song, I
[39:32] got my mind made up,
[39:36] &gt;&gt; and I turn back because I want to see my
[39:41] Jesus someday.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; I got my
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Yep. And I won't turn back because I
[39:52] won't see my Jesus. Now to some it's
[39:56] just a song but but from my day that was
[40:00] those are words that we actually meant
[40:02] &gt;&gt; from our heart. I got my mind made up
[40:05] and I won't turn back. I I ain't going
[40:07] back to the things God delivered me
[40:09] from. Right. And then then then they
[40:11] would change the song and and and it was
[40:13] they would combine these songs and make
[40:15] a whole medley out of it. I mean Donna
[40:17] Donnie Mccclurken did it first, but then
[40:19] they say goodbye world.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't let that just be words
[40:24] coming out of your mouth. Let it be
[40:25] truly, Amen. Uh something that happens
[40:27] in your life. Goodbye, world. I stay no
[40:31] longer with you. I MADE UP MY MIND TO GO
[40:34] GOD'S WAY THE REST OF MY LIFE.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; That's got to be your testimony.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; That's got to be your conviction. When
[40:41] we talk about having a madeup mind, I I
[40:43] I I just put it, you know, in in a
[40:46] Google search. What does it mean to have
[40:48] a madeup mind in the Bible? And uh AI
[40:52] always wants to speak.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And AI an overview uh gave
[40:58] it back to it says in the Bible having a
[41:01] madeup mind means a firm settled
[41:05] decision to follow God.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; And it's characterized by an unwavering
[41:11] trust that no matter what direction God
[41:14] takes my life, he's got everything under
[41:16] control. Amen. And it's an unwavering
[41:19] trust in God. It's a commitment to
[41:22] obedience. Amen. And that's following
[41:25] the word of God. So whatever God's word
[41:26] tells me to do, I'm going to obey that
[41:28] and follow it. Amen. To the best of my
[41:30] ability. So a madeup mind is having a
[41:33] commitment to obedience. Another thing
[41:35] that it is is to prioritize spiritual
[41:38] truth over worldly desires.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, so, SO IF I DESIRE
[41:44] SOMETHING BUT IT'S AGAINST GOD'S WORD,
[41:46] then I got to I GOT TO FORSAKE MY DESIRE
[41:49] AND follow God's word.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; See, that's the pressing part.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It says often uh and and say
[41:56] we can it's often seen in figures like
[41:59] Daniel and exemplified by Jesus
[42:01] resolving Gethsemane contrasting with
[42:04] instability which means
[42:05] double-mindedness, right? We don't want
[42:07] to have that or anxiety and involving a
[42:10] conscious choice to set your focus on
[42:13] the spirit rather than the flesh. It's a
[42:16] conscious choice that I'm going to set
[42:18] my focus on what God wants me to do
[42:20] rather than what my flesh wants me to
[42:22] do. It's about resolve to have a madeup
[42:25] mind. It's about to a resolve to serve
[42:28] God, a resolve to stand for Christ, a
[42:30] resolve to face hardship, and a resolve
[42:33] to reject sin.
[42:36] That's what it means to have a madeup
[42:39] mind.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; I thought of a story
[42:43] of um
[42:45] that was written uh there was a song
[42:48] entitled I have decided
[42:52] to follow Jesus.
[42:54] And um
[42:57] the way that this song was actually
[42:58] written because there was a man that had
[43:00] a madeup mind.
[43:03] uh what what had happened a missionary
[43:05] had come to his village and in India and
[43:08] this gentleman a man uh by the name of
[43:12] um Knox Singh uh he was in the village
[43:16] and a missionary a Welsh missionary come
[43:18] to the village and start preaching about
[43:19] Christianity and this man Knox Singh and
[43:22] his family uh in the village decided
[43:24] that they wanted to follow Christ they
[43:26] had a madeup mind that they wanted to
[43:28] follow Christ now now you you you know
[43:30] uh young people when you all make a
[43:33] decision and you you whether you go to
[43:35] an altar, whether you do it in in at,
[43:36] you know, at home or whether you do it,
[43:38] you know, when I when I made my decision
[43:40] to follow Christ, I was in the parking
[43:41] lot of a grocery store. I wasn't even at
[43:43] the church, but I was in the parking lot
[43:45] of a grocery store and I made up my
[43:47] mind. I I'm I'm not this is from here
[43:50] I'm going forward. I'm serving God. I
[43:52] asked the Lord Jesus into my heart and
[43:54] and I can take you to the spot to the
[43:56] place where it happened for me.
[43:58] Everybody ought to have their own
[43:59] personal testimony where they know
[44:01] exactly where they surrendered to the
[44:03] Lord Jesus.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; They know where they gave up their
[44:05] heart. Amen. And and complete surrender
[44:08] to the Lord Jesus. There was many times
[44:10] I went to an alt at church, but you know
[44:12] it did not stick.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But there was a time where I
[44:16] I knew that when that lady witnessed to
[44:18] me that night at the grocery store, I
[44:20] said, "Okay, tonight is the night that
[44:21] I'm giving my heart to the Lord." And
[44:22] she's the one told me, "You don't have
[44:24] to wait till you go to church to give to
[44:26] give your heart to the Lord. can do it
[44:27] right here in this parking lot. And I
[44:29] took that lady at her word. First, she
[44:31] asked me, "Do you want to give your
[44:32] heart to the Lord right now?" I said,
[44:33] "No, ma'am. I don't want to do it right
[44:34] now." And she went on about her way, but
[44:37] she planted a seed in my heart that I
[44:39] could not get away from it. And before
[44:42] the end of that night, I gave my heart
[44:44] to the Lord right there in that parking
[44:46] lot.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But but you know we all have
[44:50] moments like that where we where we we
[44:51] we we settle in our hearts. We settle in
[44:53] our mind. We settle in our spirit. We
[44:55] settle in our soul. From this day
[44:57] forward I'm going on with God. So you
[44:59] know this man uh come to this spot. He
[45:01] heard about Christianity and you know
[45:03] him and his family decided you know what
[45:05] we going to convert to Christianity.
[45:06] Whatever their faith was uh they moved
[45:09] from that. Maybe maybe it was a Muslim
[45:11] faith but they moved from that. They
[45:13] moved to Christianity. Now, for us, when
[45:14] we do things like this, it may seem
[45:17] simple to go to an altar or or or to go
[45:19] to one of the youth meetings and and God
[45:21] do something. But for this man, when it
[45:23] when when he accepted Christ as savior
[45:25] and his family accepted Christ, that
[45:27] that was like a death sentence to them.
[45:30] They knew what this meant. But no, no
[45:32] matter what the consequences were, they
[45:35] were determined that they were going to
[45:37] serve God from from a from from from
[45:40] some some sermons they heard a
[45:42] missionary preach.
[45:44] Now, this man, Nox Singh,
[45:46] be to share within the village that, you
[45:49] know what, we're Christians. Begin to
[45:51] tell others in in the in the village.
[45:53] And and when when when the chief of the
[45:55] village heard this, he was upset to hear
[45:59] that somebody in in his village had
[46:01] converted over to Christianity. So, he
[46:04] approached this family and he demanded
[46:06] that they either renounce their faith in
[46:08] Jesus or face death. See, this is this
[46:12] is what I mean to have a madeup mind.
[46:14] So, he had he had to they had to either
[46:16] renounce their faith in Christ or face
[46:18] death. Now, uh when Knoxing heard this,
[46:22] you know, he said, "Well, you know, I'm
[46:24] not going to I'm not I'm not I'm not
[46:26] going back. He he he he quoted the
[46:28] words, I have decided
[46:32] &gt;&gt; to follow Jesus." And it says, um, "No
[46:36] turning back." Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[46:40] When we sing songs like that, we need to
[46:43] understand where it's written from. That
[46:45] man, that man had to give up his life
[46:48] and and we sing the song as if it just
[46:50] means just another song in church. No, a
[46:53] man gave up his life because of his
[46:56] faith in Christ and and him wanted to
[46:58] follow Christ. He truly had a madeup
[47:02] mind.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; The man says, "Uh, I've decided to
[47:06] follow Jesus, no turning back.
[47:09] They uh they told him says, "You know,
[47:12] if you don't if you don't if you don't
[47:14] um if you don't if you don't turn and uh
[47:18] and and and and give up on Christ, we're
[47:20] going to kill your children right here
[47:22] in front of you." Then he he he's he
[47:24] made a statement says, "Though none go
[47:26] with me,
[47:28] &gt;&gt; still I will follow." Now, so he he's
[47:32] the second verse of the song comes out
[47:34] of the experience of the man watching
[47:36] his own children be killed because of
[47:39] his faith,
[47:40] &gt;&gt; right? But this is a man that has a
[47:42] madeup mind. And and as young people, we
[47:44] don't have to go through things this
[47:46] drastic. But yet, we still need to the
[47:48] same type of mindset that this man had.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When it comes to OUR
[47:53] CHRISTIANITY, THOUGH NONE GO WITH ME, IF
[47:56] mama don't go with me, still I will
[47:58] follow. IF DADDY DON'T GO WITH ME, still
[48:01] I will follow. If my BROTHERS AND
[48:02] SISTERS DON'T GO with me, STILL I WILL
[48:05] FOLLOW. YOU MUST HAVE a madeup mind. AND
[48:08] WHEN YOU HAVE A MADEUP MIND, YOU CAN'T
[48:10] look back.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; The man says,
[48:16] "Though none go with me, yet still I
[48:18] will follow. His children are dying."
[48:20] Because the chief said, "If you don't
[48:22] denounce Christ, then your children will
[48:24] die." This is his response. though none
[48:26] go with me. Still I will follow. He
[48:28] watched his children die. Well, the
[48:32] chief saw that this still did not change
[48:34] no scene. So, um he uh he he told him
[48:38] says, "All right,
[48:40] um if if if if you won't if you know
[48:43] that you you losing your kids, if that
[48:46] won't change your mind, then what we're
[48:48] going to do is take your wife's life."
[48:50] And when he saw his wife also dying, he
[48:53] says, "No, none go with me." still I
[48:55] will follow. My what a testimony. What a
[48:58] testimony. And finally after all of his
[49:00] family is dead, the the the chief looks
[49:03] at him and says, "You know what? We've
[49:05] killed your children. We've killed your
[49:06] wife and you're still willing to follow
[49:08] Christ." He says, "Okay, now it's time
[49:10] for you to lose your own life." And then
[49:12] he said these words. He says, "The cross
[49:16] &gt;&gt; before me, the world behind me,
[49:21] &gt;&gt; no turning back.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; NO TURNING BACK. UH THE CROSS BEFORE ME,
[49:26] THE WORLD BEHIND ME, no turning back.
[49:29] This man LOST HIS LIFE THAT THAT DAY
[49:32] BECAUSE he had a madeup mind.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; His children died,
[49:44] his wife died,
[49:46] he died.
[49:48] But after all of them died, the chief
[49:51] looked and said a whole family would
[49:54] give up their life for their faith. The
[49:58] whole village converted to Christianity.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; God needs people that will not turn
[50:07] back.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; They needs young people today that have
[50:10] a determination that they will not turn
[50:13] back. No matter what it is that you're
[50:16] facing, no matter what it is that you're
[50:19] going through, don't turn back. You see,
[50:24] you know, there's many examples in
[50:26] scripture where we can see people that
[50:27] think about going back. One of them was
[50:30] uh the children of Israel when God was
[50:31] bringing them out of Egypt and taking
[50:34] them to the promised land. And and
[50:35] here's the here's the problem is that in
[50:38] between Egypt and the promised land is a
[50:40] great trial. Because here's here's what
[50:43] here's what what most of us most of us
[50:45] want. We want to give our life to Jesus
[50:47] and we want the rapture to happen
[50:49] immediately where we ain't got to go
[50:50] through nothing, right? But no, in in
[50:53] between you coming out of Egypt or
[50:56] coming out of the world and then us
[50:58] going into rapture, there's a lot of
[51:00] trials and tribulations in in between
[51:02] all I mean lots of them.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right. But no matter what
[51:07] the trial or tribulation is, we have to
[51:09] have a determination. Uh-huh.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; I'm not going back.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; I'm not turning back.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; I come too far
[51:17] &gt;&gt; to turn around. And and like like one
[51:19] preacher preached, we have reached a
[51:21] point of no return.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; That's that's the way you have to feel.
[51:25] I I've reached the point of no return.
[51:27] So there's no sense in anybody trying to
[51:30] discourage me from following Christ
[51:32] because I reached the point of no
[51:33] return.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; I'm all in. Amen.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; The children of Israel, they got to a
[51:39] spot in their journey where they begin
[51:42] to, you know, think about, man, we we
[51:45] we're going to the promised land and
[51:46] we've come out of Egypt, going to the
[51:48] promised land, but we ain't made it to
[51:49] the promised land yet. And then, uh,
[51:52] because of all the trials and things
[51:53] that they were going through, amen, in
[51:55] the wilderness, they began to long for
[51:58] the garlic of Egypt again. And and when
[52:01] they're longing for the garlic of Egypt,
[52:03] what they're doing is in their minds,
[52:04] they're already going back. You have to
[52:06] watch and you have to guard your mind
[52:09] because when you start thinking about
[52:10] going back. If your mind is already back
[52:13] there, eventually your body will follow
[52:15] your mind.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you got to guard your
[52:19] mind. You got to cast down every evil
[52:21] thought that the devil will give you. It
[52:24] was not better where you were. It was
[52:26] worse. That's why you came to Jesus.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right. It was it was it was
[52:31] worse back there. Don't ever think it's
[52:33] better where you left from. No, it's
[52:34] it's it's better where you are right
[52:36] now.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; The children of Israel began to long for
[52:41] the garlic of Egypt. They were turning
[52:43] back.
[52:45] Another one that we pick up here and I I
[52:48] want to read this this scripture. Let's
[52:50] turn to Ruth chapter 1 verse 8.
[52:56] Hallelujah. Ruth chapter 1 and verse 8.
[53:13] This is uh an example
[53:16] of it's a contrasting example of someone
[53:21] that that was determined not to look
[53:24] back and another one that decided
[53:27] uh to look back. Verse eight says this.
[53:32] And Naomi said unto her two
[53:33] daughters-in-law,
[53:35] "Go return
[53:37] each to her mother's house. The Lord
[53:39] deal kindly with you as you have dealt
[53:41] with the dead and with me." And now
[53:43] these daughter-in-laws
[53:45] were married to her sons. Both her sons
[53:47] passed away there in the land of Moab.
[53:49] And now Naomi is on her way back to
[53:52] Israel which is she should have never
[53:54] left Israel in the first place but now
[53:55] she's on her way back and she's u invite
[53:58] first the daughter-in-laws you know they
[54:00] said we're going to go along with you
[54:01] but she said no no no why don't y'all
[54:03] stay here so she's giving them
[54:04] permission to stay. Now verse uh verse 9
[54:07] says uh the Lord grant you that you may
[54:09] find rest each of you in the house of uh
[54:13] uh in in the house of her husband. Then
[54:16] she kissed them, and they lifted up
[54:18] their voice and wept. And they said unto
[54:20] her, "Surely we will return with thee
[54:22] unto unto thy people." Now, now notice
[54:25] both of them are saying this, but both
[54:28] of them don't mean this. And can I can I
[54:30] just mention something to you young
[54:31] people? Don't say one thing out of your
[54:33] mouth towards God, but not really mean
[54:35] it in your heart.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Be sincere with God. God knows
[54:39] whether you're sincere or not. Right?
[54:41] Hallelujah. Don't say it because it
[54:42] seems popular to say it, but be sincere
[54:45] with God. Be be be be be be be be be be
[54:46] be be be be be be be be be be be be be
[54:46] be be be be be be be be be be be be be
[54:46] be be be be be be be be be be be be be
[54:46] be be be be be be be be be be be be be
[54:46] be be be be be be be be be be be be be
[54:47] be be be be be be be be committed to
[54:47] him. Verse 11 says, "And Naomi Naomi
[54:50] said, "Turn again, my daughters. Why
[54:53] will ye go with me? Are there yet any
[54:55] more sons in my womb that they may be
[54:57] your husbands?"
[54:59] Um uh they may be your husbands. Turn
[55:01] again, my daughters. Go your way, for I
[55:03] am too old to have an husband. If I
[55:05] should say I have hope, if I should have
[55:08] an husband also tonight and should also
[55:10] bear sons, would you tar for them till
[55:12] they were grown? Would you stay for them
[55:15] uh uh stay for them from having
[55:17] husbands? Nay, my daughters, for it
[55:19] grieveth me uh much for your sakes that
[55:21] the hand of the Lord is gone out against
[55:23] me. And they lifted up their voice and
[55:26] wept again. So they're crying again. Now
[55:28] what? Notice this. And Orpa kissed her
[55:31] mother-in-law, but Ruth clave unto her.
[55:35] Hallelujah. Now, now, now here's what we
[55:37] here's here's what we got. Because when
[55:39] when Orpa kissed her mother-in-law, that
[55:42] was Orpa saying goodbye. You just gave
[55:45] me a a a free pass and I'm out of here.
[55:48] I'm going back. I'm not obligated to be
[55:51] with you anymore. My husband is gone and
[55:54] I ain't got no obligation. You just
[55:56] released me. I'm going back. goodbye.
[55:59] When she kissed her mother-in-law, it
[56:01] was over for Orpa at that time.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Now, look at the very next verse, verse
[56:06] 15. Uh, and she said, "Behold, thy
[56:10] sister-in-law is gone back unto her
[56:12] people, and unto her gods, return thou
[56:15] after thy sister-in-law." Now, now in
[56:17] the previous verse, it says Ruth claved
[56:20] to Naomi. We don't know how much and how
[56:23] how tight she might have been holding on
[56:24] to Naomi like, "No, I I I I know Orpa is
[56:27] gone. I know she went back, but I'm
[56:29] going to stay right here next to you,
[56:31] Naomi." Now, you need to understand
[56:33] something. Ruth had no um she she had no
[56:38] no promise of what would be her future.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She had she had she had uh
[56:45] uh uh uh she had already had one husband
[56:47] who had already passed. There was no
[56:49] promise that she was going to get
[56:50] married again. There was no promise that
[56:53] she would be accepted when she went to
[56:55] back to Israel with with Orpa. Ruth had
[56:59] nothing. Hallelujah. But the one thing
[57:02] Ruth had, and we're going to read in the
[57:04] scripture, Ruth had a madeup mind.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And I'm going tell you, if
[57:11] you can get one of them, A MADEUP MIND,
[57:13] ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES to God, YOU
[57:15] HAVE NO IDEA WHAT BLESSINGS MIGHT BE
[57:18] WAITING for you on the other side. But
[57:20] before you GET TO THE BLESSINGS, YOU
[57:22] MUST HAVE A madeup mind. AND THAT MADEUP
[57:25] MIND SAYS, "I WILL NOT be going back."
[57:29] &gt;&gt; We sing the song, I won't go back.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; I won't go back to the way things used
[57:34] to be. See, you got to have a madeup
[57:37] mind before you can say things like
[57:39] that. Otherwise, it's just words in a
[57:41] song.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; But let it be your testimony.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; God, I'm not going back. I thank you for
[57:48] what you've done for me thus far this
[57:50] year, and I'm not going back. I'm
[57:52] looking I'm I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm
[57:54] not looking at the things behind me, but
[57:56] I'm pressing forward to what's before
[57:59] me.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Let's go on and read a little bit more
[58:02] here in the scripture. says,
[58:06] "Ruth said, "Entreat me not to leave
[58:09] thee,
[58:14] or return from following after thee. For
[58:17] whether thou goest,
[58:19] I will go, and where thou lodest,
[58:23] I will lodge. Thy people shall be my
[58:26] people, and thy God my God. Where thou
[58:31] dieest
[58:33] will I die, and there I will be buried,
[58:36] the Lord do so to me, and more also if
[58:39] ought but death part thee and me.
[58:44] Verse 18 says, when she saw that she was
[58:47] steadfastly minded, what is that? A
[58:50] madeup mind. When she saw that she was
[58:53] steadfastly minded to go with her, then
[58:55] she left speaking unto her. And see, I
[58:59] like that because Ruth, Ruth, Ruth, Ruth
[59:01] demonstrated,
[59:02] um, I don't know what's going to happen
[59:05] when I get to Israel. I don't know
[59:06] what's before me, but I tell you what
[59:08] I'm going to do. I'm going to I'm just
[59:10] going to follow you because I feel like
[59:11] that's what I'm supposed to do. And you
[59:13] know, the beautiful thing about Ruth's
[59:15] decision is that Ruth ended up going, if
[59:18] you read the rest of the book of Ruth,
[59:20] she ended up going there with Naomi and
[59:21] and and she began to work in the fields.
[59:24] and she happened to work in a field of
[59:26] her kinsman redeemer. His name was Boaz.
[59:30] And Boaz had not been married before. So
[59:33] when he saw Ruth come, he's like, "Who
[59:35] who is this young lady that's in the
[59:37] field? What's going on? What's the story
[59:39] behind her?" And they told her how she
[59:40] made a decision to come with Naomi back.
[59:43] And and he was like he was really
[59:45] impressed by her character.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; He's impressed. And you know, we heard
[59:50] that she had another daughter-in-law,
[59:51] but that one took off. But this one
[59:53] stayed right by her mother-in-law's
[59:55] side. She had no promise of nothing. He
[59:58] says, "I tell you what, I I got my eye
[1:00:00] on this lady." And uh and and and and
[1:00:02] and as as the story went on, eventually
[1:00:05] what happened is that uh uh Ruth asked,
[1:00:09] you know, uh Boaz to perform the the the
[1:00:11] what a kinsman should perform. And uh he
[1:00:13] says now in performing that he was going
[1:00:15] to get everything Naomi uh owned but
[1:00:18] he's also going to be he have to take
[1:00:19] Ruth on as a as a wife. And that's
[1:00:22] exactly want to do what he wanted. He
[1:00:24] got a gentile wife because this wife was
[1:00:27] willing to go all the way. Young
[1:00:29] sisters, young sisters, before God gives
[1:00:32] you that husband,
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; you need a madeup mind
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; that I'm going to serve God
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; no matter what. What what if God gave
[1:00:39] you a husband and then your husband got
[1:00:41] sick and and and couldn't be who you
[1:00:43] thought he could be? You got to have a
[1:00:45] madeup mind before God gives you a
[1:00:47] husband.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have to have a madeup
[1:00:52] mind.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Ruth had a madeup mind
[1:00:56] before anything. And and God end up
[1:00:58] blessing her with Boaz. And not just
[1:01:00] blessing her with Boaz as her husband.
[1:01:02] Do we if you read the rest of the
[1:01:04] scripture, you realize that the Lord
[1:01:06] Jesus Christ came down through this
[1:01:09] lineage of this story of a sister that
[1:01:12] had a madeup mind.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Your God going to be my God. Where you
[1:01:17] die, I'm going to die. Where you buried,
[1:01:20] I'm going to be buried. You know, your
[1:01:21] people going to be my people. You got to
[1:01:23] have that kind of mind when it comes to
[1:01:25] serving God.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm I'm in this. I ain't going
[1:01:29] nowhere.
[1:01:31] I'm stuck here.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You know, um let me just
[1:01:36] give you, you know, one other story here
[1:01:37] and then I'll I'll I'll I'll
[1:01:41] uh cut it off for tonight. Um
[1:01:45] there was another uh person in scripture
[1:01:48] that we'll read that didn't have a
[1:01:52] madeup mind. And let's let's let's pick
[1:01:53] this up in in Luke 17
[1:01:56] verse 28.
[1:02:06] All right. Luke 17 and verse 28.
[1:02:13] It says this. Likewise also as it was in
[1:02:17] the days of Lot. Now, uh before I go
[1:02:20] further in that, this is why I say young
[1:02:23] people, we know that you all have it so
[1:02:25] much harder uh today, especially those
[1:02:28] that are in public school and and things
[1:02:30] like that. There what the way it was in
[1:02:33] the days of Lot, this was a time on
[1:02:36] earth that God was so upset with the sin
[1:02:39] of the people. In the center of the
[1:02:41] people at that time was a lot of uh
[1:02:44] homosexuality,
[1:02:46] lesbianism was happening all around. And
[1:02:48] God was so displeased with what mankind
[1:02:51] was doing that he came down to destroy
[1:02:53] the earth himself or at least those that
[1:02:56] the cities that that that was going on
[1:02:57] in he came to destroy that himself. Now
[1:03:00] you need to understand if God came down
[1:03:02] to destroy Sodom Gomorrah uh because of
[1:03:05] that sin. Today he have to destroy the
[1:03:07] entire world
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; because that sin it used to be there was
[1:03:11] only certain cities. People knew that if
[1:03:14] you went to San Francisco that was one
[1:03:15] city that that had a lot of that
[1:03:17] rampant. The Key West is another city
[1:03:20] like that. Hallelujah. That's why if you
[1:03:23] go to Key West, Amen. It's probably good
[1:03:25] that you don't go into the city at night
[1:03:27] time.
[1:03:29] Hallelujah.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; You want to go hang out at a restaurant?
[1:03:33] It's a lot of spirits all over there.
[1:03:35] And and and and and what happens when
[1:03:37] when people know that that's an area
[1:03:39] that's like that, uh people with those
[1:03:41] spirits congregate from all over the
[1:03:43] world to go to that one area and you
[1:03:45] find yourself wrapped up in something.
[1:03:47] You wonder how in the world you got
[1:03:48] here, right? But when it say Jesus said
[1:03:51] before his return, it was going to be
[1:03:53] just like it was in the days of Lot,
[1:03:55] that's the day that we living in right
[1:03:57] now. That's true.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Homosexual. Homosexuality is everywhere.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Even in churches.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Can I Can I go a little further?
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; In the pullpit of the church.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Standing there preaching to people and
[1:04:12] telling them they don't see no need to
[1:04:14] get delivered.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; But then want to pray for you to get
[1:04:17] delivered. You first get delivered
[1:04:20] before you pray for anybody.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; But but this spirit HAS BEEN ACCEPTED
[1:04:25] ALL OVER. And this is a THIS IS A SIGN
[1:04:29] OF THE TIME. WHEN WE SEE THINGS LIKE
[1:04:31] THIS,
[1:04:32] we got to get ready for the coming of
[1:04:34] the Lord.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; And this is in order to be ready for the
[1:04:38] coming of the Lord, you need to have a
[1:04:39] madeup mind. Politicians do it. Teachers
[1:04:43] are doing it. I mean, you just people
[1:04:45] that you would you would look up to,
[1:04:47] policemen in the military.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Huh? I mean, the I mean, it's all over
[1:04:52] us. This is why we need to have a madeup
[1:04:55] mind. And and it's going to take a
[1:04:56] madeup mind to say, "No, I think that's
[1:04:58] wrong."
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; And it's not hate speech.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Don't let nobody make you think that
[1:05:03] it's hate speech to tell them that
[1:05:05] that's wrong.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Homosexuality is wrong. Lesbianism is
[1:05:09] wrong. Adultery is wrong.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Uh, all of these things are wrong.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; If you had sex with an animal, that's
[1:05:16] wrong, too.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; All of that's wrong according to God's
[1:05:19] Bible.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to say these things. is
[1:05:24] the truth.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Go back to Leviticus. You'll
[1:05:29] see it's all wrong. God outlined it.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Hey, can I give you another problem that
[1:05:34] that happened in in that day? Y'all want
[1:05:36] me to tell you the truth
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; or you want me to lie to you?
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; You want to know another problem that
[1:05:41] happened in in Lot's day? Lot
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; had relations with their own daughters.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; That's wrong, too.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They got their daddy drunk
[1:05:53] and had a relation with their daddy.
[1:05:55] Both of both daughters came up with this
[1:05:57] thing.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And let me tell you
[1:05:59] something. He was not that drunk
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; that he couldn't say no.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't tell me he was that drunk
[1:06:07] that he couldn't say no. I can tell you
[1:06:09] why. Because David got uh Bashibba's
[1:06:12] husband drunk. Uriah got him really
[1:06:15] drunk and tried to send HIM HOME TO HIS
[1:06:17] WIFE.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Uriah said, "Me go home to my wife?" No.
[1:06:21] where the men out there on the
[1:06:22] battlefield, no, I'm going to sleep
[1:06:23] right here in the king's palace.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. HE HE WAS THAT DRUNK, BUT
[1:06:28] STILL COULD MAKE A a a determination
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; that I'm not going home to my my wife.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; So, Lot was not that drunk.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; These are spirits that fight that people
[1:06:42] are fighting in today's world. Don't
[1:06:45] don't tell me I know about it.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; I know about it. I know about it. So
[1:06:49] look, you go back to Levitical law and
[1:06:51] speak against a lot of these things. And
[1:06:53] young people, I'm going to tell you
[1:06:54] something. You going have to have a
[1:06:55] madeup mind that you're going to keep
[1:06:56] yourself.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; I'mma wait on the Lord
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; to give me a wife. I'mma wait on the
[1:07:02] Lord to give me a husband. I ain't going
[1:07:04] to be running around here with
[1:07:05] everybody. I'mma just wait on the Lord.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:12] Amen. and and and and and I'm going to
[1:07:14] tell you when you have a madeup mind to
[1:07:15] serve the Lord, I I remember, you know,
[1:07:17] Brother Brandham sharing a um story
[1:07:20] about a might have been brother Perry
[1:07:22] Green might have shared the story about
[1:07:23] this sister who had um um uh they went
[1:07:28] out to Indian reservation and uh they
[1:07:30] they they prayed for some people and
[1:07:32] there was a lady there on the Indian
[1:07:33] reservation and she said, "I'm going to
[1:07:35] run to the city and I'm going to get
[1:07:36] myself a husband uh brother Brandham and
[1:07:39] and she said he said no sister don't
[1:07:41] don't go to the city. Don't don't go and
[1:07:43] do that. Just stay right here and God
[1:07:45] will send you a husband. And she said,
[1:07:47] "Brother Brandom, if you knew the things
[1:07:48] that I had done, the life that I had
[1:07:50] lived, if you knew the things I had
[1:07:51] done, ain't nobody in this reservation
[1:07:54] going to marry me." And sometimes, young
[1:07:56] sisters, you all get to the spot where
[1:07:57] you feel like, "Well, ain't nobody in
[1:07:58] the church going to marry me. You want
[1:07:59] to you want to go out? Don't do that.
[1:08:01] Just wait on the Lord." He will send you
[1:08:03] a husband.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; And and the sister say, "No, no, no, no.
[1:08:07] If you knew the things that I done,
[1:08:08] ain't nobody going nobody want to
[1:08:09] marry." He say, "Sister, just trust me
[1:08:11] when I say if you stay right here, God
[1:08:13] will send you your husband.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; God will actually bring him to you."
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Right? And he she said, "I don't know."
[1:08:20] And so, so, so, you know, finally she
[1:08:22] agreed and she stayed uh and she got the
[1:08:25] husband, but but one of the brothers uh
[1:08:27] had asked Brother Brandham said,
[1:08:28] "Brother Brandom, when she asked the
[1:08:30] question, if you knew the things that I
[1:08:32] did, uh you know, what what was it that
[1:08:35] she did? What I mean, what was that?
[1:08:36] What was so bad?" cuz they knew that the
[1:08:38] prophet had the ability to see visions.
[1:08:40] But brother Random told the brothers
[1:08:42] said, "Brother, what God put underneath
[1:08:44] the blood,
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; he don't even show his prophets."
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; See, when God what God puts it in the
[1:08:54] sea of forgetfulness, then you put it in
[1:08:56] the sea of forgetfulness and you press
[1:08:58] on towards the mark. Don't don't look
[1:09:00] back.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Go forward to what God has for you.
[1:09:04] Amen.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; I want to encourage you sisters, you
[1:09:06] stay, you stay faithful to God. You have
[1:09:08] a madeup mind. God will send you your
[1:09:10] husband.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, he will.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; That young lady got a husband. God sent
[1:09:14] her one.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look, God got You don't know where
[1:09:18] where your husband might be. This is a
[1:09:20] big world.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Don't limit your husband just to West
[1:09:23] Palm Beach.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; He might not be here in West Palm Beach,
[1:09:26] but he might have a desire to come to
[1:09:28] West Palm Beach,
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; and he need a way to get here.
[1:09:37] Come on, somebody.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Let's keep going.
[1:09:43] Uh verse 28 says, "Likewise also it was
[1:09:45] in the days of Lot, they did eat, they
[1:09:47] drank, they bought, they sold, they
[1:09:49] planted, they builded." But the same day
[1:09:51] that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained
[1:09:53] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[1:09:55] destroyed them all. Even thus shall it
[1:09:57] be in the day when the Son of Man is
[1:09:59] revealed. In that day, he which be upon
[1:10:03] the housetop, and his stuff in the
[1:10:05] house, let him not come down or take it
[1:10:07] away. And he that is in the field, let
[1:10:09] him likewise not return back. And it
[1:10:13] says this verse 32, remember Lot's wife.
[1:10:18] The problem that the what we have with
[1:10:20] Lot's wife is that she
[1:10:23] looked back.
[1:10:26] Not just necessarily in with her eyes,
[1:10:29] but it was with her heart that she
[1:10:31] looked back. God had made a way for them
[1:10:33] to come out of what they were in before
[1:10:34] he destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. But
[1:10:37] Lot, Miss Lot looked back, right? And
[1:10:40] you don't. And when the scripture say
[1:10:42] remember her, this lady turned to a
[1:10:44] pillar of salt because she looked back.
[1:10:49] Don't look back. And I encourage all my
[1:10:53] young people, go forward this year. Go
[1:10:56] forward in all that God has in store for
[1:10:59] you and don't look back.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. But I I
[1:11:05] have um
[1:11:08] um uh let's see here
[1:11:11] um this this quote out of shalom.
[1:11:17] It says now about the new year that
[1:11:20] we're facing. We have we could have more
[1:11:22] to say on this in between from the
[1:11:24] darkness to the light. He says the intro
[1:11:27] introduction of the light coming in
[1:11:29] between but now we want to get right
[1:11:31] straight to the new year.
[1:11:34] says, "New year, new year. What about
[1:11:36] it? Brings new hope. We're one year
[1:11:40] closer. We're one day closer than we was
[1:11:42] yesterday. We're one hour closer than we
[1:11:46] was when I started. 15 minutes to 11.
[1:11:48] It's still 15 minutes uh 15 uh till 12.
[1:11:52] Now we're 1 hour closer. We don't look
[1:11:55] back. We look forward." See? Oh, yes,
[1:11:58] sir. New year doesn't mean turning a new
[1:12:00] page. Uh-uh. No. like the the man one
[1:12:03] morning uh I was I was hurted. A man got
[1:12:06] up early and went out and picked up a
[1:12:08] paper come back and sat down put his
[1:12:10] feet up on the uh on on the diving put
[1:12:14] his uh glasses on began to read his
[1:12:16] paper. His wife out getting breakfast
[1:12:18] she said John anything new said no same
[1:12:21] old things just new people. Yeah that's
[1:12:23] right murders rape and everything
[1:12:25] somebody else done it. see truth, not
[1:12:28] turn a new page, is turn to the word,
[1:12:32] right? See what the word promises for
[1:12:34] today. See what the light of the day is
[1:12:37] supposed to be. What we ought to do this
[1:12:39] year is not go back to creeds and
[1:12:41] things. Go back to our old
[1:12:42] denominations. Not go back to old
[1:12:44] denominations, but turn to the word. See
[1:12:46] what kind of light is supposed to shine
[1:12:48] today, old church. Turn to the word. Get
[1:12:50] back to the word. Flip the right switch.
[1:12:52] Quit punching around on electric light.
[1:12:54] see artificial, man-made. Turn to his
[1:12:57] word and see the promise of today and
[1:13:00] then see what the promise is and watch
[1:13:02] for its identification. When it's
[1:13:04] vindicated, then you know uh whether
[1:13:07] you're in light or not. See what the
[1:13:09] promise is. Changing the pages or
[1:13:11] changing the calendars doesn't change
[1:13:13] time. A lot of people say, "Well, the
[1:13:15] old year's gone. Throw away the old
[1:13:17] December calendar now and put up the the
[1:13:19] other one, a new year." That's what a
[1:13:21] new year means to them. to me. I want to
[1:13:24] see what's promised for the day. I I
[1:13:26] want to know what the light of the hour
[1:13:28] is so I can know how to walk in it. I
[1:13:31] want to know where I'm living, what age
[1:13:34] I'm in, how far up the road I am. As
[1:13:37] Paul said, I could stand quoting again,
[1:13:40] forgetting those things that are in the
[1:13:43] past. Now I press towards the mark, the
[1:13:47] high calling, the complete
[1:13:49] identification when all time will fade
[1:13:51] out into eternity when Jesus comes.
[1:13:56] Don't look back.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:14:01] I was thinking as I was preparing
[1:14:05] this um sermon, there was a a song that
[1:14:10] came to my my memory. Um,
[1:14:15] and it's one of those old songs, but
[1:14:17] I'll just give you the words. It says,
[1:14:19] "I started on this journey,
[1:14:22] many years ago.
[1:14:25] I've seen a lot of things
[1:14:28] while traveling to and fro.
[1:14:31] I've been through the storm. I've been
[1:14:34] through the rain. And sometimes all I
[1:14:37] tried to do is seem to be in vain. But
[1:14:42] one thing I know for sure, I'm going to
[1:14:45] get my starry crown because I have come
[1:14:48] this far and I just can't turn around.
[1:14:53] The things I have to do, you may not
[1:14:56] understand,
[1:14:57] but my main concern
[1:15:01] is that I'm in the master's plan.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then the second verse
[1:15:07] would say this, Satan comes around
[1:15:12] playing with my mind, but I got a job to
[1:15:15] do. I can't afford to waste my time. He
[1:15:20] pretends to be my friend. He pretends to
[1:15:23] be so kind. But see, when I got a madeup
[1:15:25] mind, I say this, get behind me, Satan,
[1:15:28] cuz I got heaven on my mind. And it
[1:15:32] says, you know that I'm
[1:15:36] I'm going all the way.
[1:15:41] And I care less
[1:15:46] of what you may do or say.
[1:15:51] Oh, I made the Lord a promise
[1:15:56] if he would lead the way. I told him I'd
[1:16:00] follow.
[1:16:07] Oh, and after all that I've been
[1:16:10] through,
[1:16:11] I'd be a fool to turn it loose and let
[1:16:15] it all go now. Oh,
[1:16:22] see, I have made up in my mind.
[1:16:28] Yes, I'm going all the way.
[1:16:34] Sounds real good. Let's try it again.
[1:16:36] Oh,
[1:16:38] you know that I
[1:16:44] I'm going all the way.
[1:16:49] Oh,
[1:16:52] say
[1:16:54] I care less. I care less
[1:17:00] of what you may do or say.
[1:17:08] You see,
[1:17:10] I made the Lord a promise. I said if he
[1:17:15] would lead the way, I told him I'd
[1:17:18] follow. Told him I'd follow.
[1:17:25] And after all that I've been through.
[1:17:29] Oh, I'd be a fool to turn it loose and
[1:17:33] let it all go now. Oh,
[1:17:39] you see
[1:17:41] I have made up in my mind.
[1:17:45] Well,
[1:17:47] I'm going all the way.
[1:17:53] Is that just words to somebody tonight
[1:17:55] or is that your testimony? I'm going all
[1:17:59] the way. I'm not going to look back. I'm
[1:18:02] going all the way with Jesus. Amen.
[1:18:05] Let's give the Lord a hand of praise.
[1:18:10] Hallelujah.
[1:18:14] Let us have a word of prayer. Father,
[1:18:18] we are grateful,
[1:18:20] oh God, for your word
[1:18:25] and just want to say something that
[1:18:28] would be a strength and encouragement to
[1:18:30] our youth.
[1:18:32] Um, so much that we have endured
[1:18:36] throughout this past year. But many of
[1:18:38] them, Lord, are still still standing.
[1:18:41] And I'm grateful to see them standing.
[1:18:44] Lord, I realize that uh they had some
[1:18:47] trials that they had to overcome and
[1:18:50] there'll be others as we approach this
[1:18:52] new year that they'll have to overcome.
[1:18:55] But oh God, as we uh prepare uh
[1:18:59] ourselves, fortify ourselves with the
[1:19:01] word of God. I I pray for each and every
[1:19:04] one that God you would give them
[1:19:06] strength and that you would give them a
[1:19:09] heart that uh is determined to serve
[1:19:12] you, a mind that is made up, God that
[1:19:15] they they will not turn back. They they
[1:19:18] will not go back into the things that uh
[1:19:20] you have brought them from. Father, I
[1:19:23] pray that you would just give them that
[1:19:24] resolve and that God, they we realize
[1:19:28] that the enemy uh has so much more to to
[1:19:31] bring against them in this time and in
[1:19:33] this day. But God, we know you gave us a
[1:19:36] weapon that is stronger than anything
[1:19:38] the devil can ever do. And that is the
[1:19:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost. So, I pray
[1:19:42] that every heart would be filled with
[1:19:44] the spirit of God. And that God, you
[1:19:46] would just make the difference in each
[1:19:48] and everyone their lives. And Lord um uh
[1:19:52] uh as they Lord just some facing
[1:19:55] different decisions that they have to
[1:19:56] face in life. I pray that you give them
[1:19:58] direction, instruction, peace in their
[1:20:01] mind, peace in their walk with you and
[1:20:04] Lord that you would just bless uh every
[1:20:06] step that they would take. Let this
[1:20:08] group of young people be an example to
[1:20:10] so many others Lord that um Lord that
[1:20:13] would see them. And Father, I just trust
[1:20:15] that you would you would help them,
[1:20:17] Father, in their journey. We commit each
[1:20:19] one, Father, into your capable hands.
[1:20:21] It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:26] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's give the
[1:20:28] Lord another hand of praise. Amen.
[1:20:33] Amen.
[1:20:39] All right, let's stand and sing. Amen.
[1:20:44] um
[1:20:45] this um
[1:20:48] this song. Amen. I'm going all the way
[1:20:52] with the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:21:00] Say all
[1:21:02] the way.
[1:21:05] I'm going all the way.
