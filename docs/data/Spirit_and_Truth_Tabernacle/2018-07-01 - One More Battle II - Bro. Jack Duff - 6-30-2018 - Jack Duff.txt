appreciate you although close dear but before we actually read this and I want to pray a prayer I was listening to the Prophet law earlier today and the message it's actually adoption part three but the original title was manifested sons of God and he was just talking about going after different ones that that kind of got away a little bit from the faith and there was a brother that told him said why you why you keep going after while you keep going after them and I say you know it's just the love of God in my heart that just keeps me going after different ones he said I'm gonna keep going after me until I catch him right about how the Lord just let him just to keep going after this person just you know kept after him kept after him till finally he called him and brought him back amen to the fool and the devil is busy a man that that was busy and after he made that comment he said there was a prayer that he prayed for a sister that had lost a mind and he prayed a prayer and say the Holy Spirit went after her and brought her back a mentor a right mind so tonight I just have a burden in my heart I know the devil fighting folk I know we're going through trial that's why I was trying to encourage the church one more battle for justice you don't know if this is the final wine right just just keep persevering Goten I mean somehow press through this thing a man and I mean you will overcome so I want to just pray a prayer that I'll just go after a man different ones that might be going through and we also I got a prayer request earlier a man for sister Tanya sister shonda's brother-in-law I understand he had a heart attack a man earlier today so we want to pray for him and that God would just touch his body a man during this time praise the Lord so I want to read the same scripture that we read on Sunday just Ephesians part of it because we've never really got a chance to go there and I just want to share from that tonight a man I'll tell you what if you would just stand with me and I'll read Amen this I'll just read the first two verses of this region 6 verse 10 to 11 but I will comment on all of it so let's just read this we'll have word of Prayer and I'll let you be seated verse 10 says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and then the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil Amen let's pray tonight father we thank you for the word that we can read but we pray the Holy Spirit would bring clarity and understanding to us as we proceed down a little thought here tonight and and got our arm we have a burden a heart to go after those that are in battle maybe somebody's been wounded in the battle and God it's our responsibility to try to strengthen them through the word somehow just get them to to keep pressing the baton this hour and Lord to get back out on the battlefield we want to send a prayer to go after those that are that are in the midst of it right now just don't know which way to turn may they turn to you God and may you bring clarity and understanding to them the enemy that is troubling their minds we bind father right now in the name of Jesus you told us what we bound on earth shall be bound in heaven what we loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven so we lose the Spirit of God to go after those sons and daughters of God and bring them to a place Lord of remembrance and father made a Holy Ghost just get all the glory and all the honor from restoring sons and restoring daughters and God we just we just trust that you would do the work that amen that only you can do we see you're already working in our midst and anytime we see you at work we know the devil is gonna come and try to do something but father we we recognize him and and we we call his bluff and father we we thank you for victory in advance in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated amen let me just read a little something here I want to go back to this scripture if we can I didn't read this on Sunday but a couple of things that I'd like to try to read here out of time-tested memorials of God a man just a few quotes here and we want to just look at the scripture time-tested memorials of God brother Branham said if he went to that much trouble to be sure that the bridge would be safe how much trouble do you think God went to to be sure this church would be safe says yes sir there's a memorial to the death of Christ amen that's his church some people don't want to live it some people will but it's testing time God's testing people today for his memorials a man a lot of times people say oh I'm so tempted blessed it be the name of the Lord for the temptations now that's really something I says I'm so tempted but blessed be the name of the Lord for the temptations right don't-don't-don't complain about them but thank God that you being tempted a man says when I am weak then I'm strong said Paul every sum that cometh to God must first be tried and tested and these things are more sweeter to you and dearer to you than precious gold is testing time I love I love the way he puts that and and often times we run from the test but Amen God wants us to embrace it because that's what's actually proving our character right one of the things that the prophets say a person is who they are when they're under pressure right when you see a person get under pressure the decisions that they make at that point in time that that demonstrates that shows who they really are right you can mask it you can make people thank you one way but let's put you under a little pressure and see how you respond then we know who you are right so so don't run from it let me just keep going he says long years ago before they had the smelters they used to take the gold and how they would know how it was right or not with all the but with all the sludge was out of it all of the iron pyrite that's fool's gold all the fools out of it the beaters beat it and beat it and turned it and beat it and turned it until the beater sees his reflection in the gold right and there's a statement there in Malachi I believe the book of Malachi where they talk about being underneath the refiners fire and there was a a person a young lady access this man she saw him working at her refiners fire with these different materials and and he would just sit sitting in the fire then he walk away from him right then he put just come back to it and just turn it a little bit then he walk away from it then he turn a little bit morning walk away from it and the girl just kept watching this process go on and on and she finally actually say now now sir I just need to ask when is it time to bring it out of the fire yeah I see you keep turning in everything but when is it time to bring the thing out of the fire he said oh that's easy and she said well when is it time you should say as soon as I can see my reflection in it then I know it's time to come out to fire right and and until God sees its reflection in us we're gonna get turned this way and we're gonna get turned that way and we're gonna get turned this way and and we it's just gonna be a constant turning in the fire notice the turning does not happen out the fire the turning happens inside the fire amen the turnin happens in the test the turning happens in the trial so don't run from the trial run to it because gosh trying to get his reflection out of you glory to God you say that's the way God does his church he gives you trial after trial test after test test after test until the life of Christ is reflected in your life until you become peaceful sober meek gentle humble ready submissive willing to turn your hair from the things of the world now though these are key statements here right because some of us we still got our eye on things in the world but when you willing to turn your head from the things the world and look straight to Calvary to the one who's doing the beating many times you think it's strange because fiery trials and sickness and persecutions it's only done to test you to get the dirt out of you to get the sludge out of you to get the slowness out of you to wake you up to a place where you can look and see the reflection now I love they say so or make you see the reflection of Christ in you Christ in you the hope of the hope of glory and I love that to get the snowless out of you you know I'll tell you what when you're going through trials you're going through tests you're going through tribulation it calls you to pray a little bit more right when you got everything good you don't pray as much as you do glory to God Amen there's a lot I mean when you're going Easy Street right amen it takes to press out but when you when you're going through it man I'm pressing into the house of God and I'm believing God it make you worship a little different glory to God amen your prayer is more sincere when you're going through all right glory to God so God know how to get these things out of us and and it's it's necessary in order to bring us into the place where he wants us to be a man number of other quotes here that I won't just want to read let's look at this side of smyrnaean church age glory to God Smyrna church age and I want you to Stannis there's one of my favorites to cloudy skies and the storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval o blessed be the name of love she not see sometimes we start going through and we think what god don't love me no no no no no no no no you're missing it the cloudy skies and the storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval right neither are bright skies in still waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of world does he love us ah yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and Galya gave us of his spirit placing us as sons and how shall I prove my love to him I love this by believing what he said and conducted myself with joy midst the trials that he and his wisdom allow us to come to pass now that means while you're going through you got to put a smile on your face Amen why are you going through no complaining right why are you going through give God glory amen give them praise give them up no matter what it is that you're facing a man like my brother say take it like a man right I like that a man take it like a man Lord okay this what you gave me I'm gonna I'm gonna embrace it I'm gonna keep pressing on hallelujah I ain't talked about quittin a man I'm talking about pressing on thank you Jesus a man I'll write a couple more here and then I just want to bring this just scripture actually I to it let me let's let's let's read the scripture here go back to Ephesians 6 and verse verse 10 I was I just got some notes here in my Bible the Study Bible that I used and and I'm not one that's really big on the notes in the Study Bible sometime they hid things that are that are good because I know that these are just thoughts of theologians and and I don't necessarily like to promote the thoughts of theologians when we got to vindicate a prophet but sometimes people say something that's right and you know and I don't mind Amen if it's right the Holy Spirit ain't you can agree with what's right and even the Prophet taught us that when we when we're eating pie if we hit a seat just push push it to the side right if we eaten chicken we hit a bone just push it to the side but he said just make sure it's a bone all right so sometimes we run into some things that other people might say hey that's alright that'll help me that'll strengthen me so I don't mind you know using that so there's there's a couple comments that I want to make here that these theologians made as they were presenting the scripture verse 10 says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might a man and and just a statement on the word finally okay that I have here in my Bible says finally maybe render from now oh right what finally means it's from now on okay or henceforth all right from now on or henceforth that means and it says the spiritual battle Christians are engaged in exists from now on a man finally means your battle exists from now on that means you gonna get victory and you're gonna get another victory and you're gonna get another victory and the reason I get a victory and another victor in another victors because you're gonna have a battle and another battle and another battle right from now on finally means from now oh oh my god it's not gonna stop here it's not gonna stop it's just getting started and let me just read you you know these notes here says the spiritual battle Christians are engaged in exist from now on look at this until the Lord's return until we get out of here amen that the battle exists from now on until the Lord's return and look at what they say there is no quarter given right there is no ceasefire oh my god amen there there is no no temporary truce that's what they say no no no quarter given no cease you can't you can't make an agreement with the devil here you got it you got it what are we just gonna have to stop this fighting Satan we got the stuff I'm gonna draw up an agreement a contract that we gonna ceasefire as soon as he signs the document he'll start firing on you you can't trust the devil so rather than trying to drop a contract with the devil destroy the devil no ceasefire in this church right when you when you look at that finally that's what we're looking at no ceasefire no stopping amen and and I read the quote on Sunday how you know Satan gonna fight until he's cast into the lake of fire yeah that's a job you know some of the so maybe some of my young people don't realize this but as you get older you're gonna realize this y'all complaining about what happened on your job and you want to get a new job go ahead go ahead get one get one but I don't care where you work that person that was driving you crazy not a name gonna change when you get to the next job it's gonna be a different one with a different thing you want to know why because you're not it sit right here in verse verse 12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood this is why you need to understand you're finally right there is no ceasefire there is no truth there is no change it's gonna be in a same old devil no matter where you go is the same ol devil you can you can even be in a Christian environment and you still gonna fight Devils yeah it's not the person that you're coming up against it's the devil and every time he'd come to bring some ministers he's actually bringing that greatness in you you understand that God allows the devil to bring greatness out of you but you don't you do you don't you know you're missing it you're not getting yes right so that this way you gotta finally your final is that that there is no ceasefire there is no stopping there is no truth there is no there's no getting away from it I'm gonna run from this I'm getting out of this sitting at you I'm stepping out this fire actually they say out of the frying pan into the fire you know I'm getting out this frying pan you ain't firing out you ain't fire you actually had a little son protecting you before it was hot but you had a little protection but now you you up in the fire you can't run from it and when you're getting the fire guess what's gonna happen little turn here another little turn then another little turn here turn here and every time we turn it's a reason we turn it because I'm waiting to see my reflection one more bad or y'all right Amen I mean you got to keep fighting and this is what we talk about when we when we're putting on this whole arm of God and you know just you got to understand this is this is until you get out of here amen amen glory to God well I thought for sure I had it made oh boy they did me wrong 14 years on a job and I'm like man this is just wrong the way these folk just did me I thought I had myself a a place of refuge a place where I could be healed from my hurt for years but the devil's gonna do it in Jesus name it's the same exact trial in the same Devils in our Lord okay God ain't no sense to me fighting this you know all right I'm gonna just take you at your word but I'm just I'm just here to tell you Church it's there is no ceasefire there's no stopping right and after you come through this one this one actually preparing you for the next one amen I'm not saying don't go get another job go get one just understand when you get it that devil that you saw you gonna be working there he actually might find out the other person unchanged got saved and everything now you got there's a new devil over here that devil just just I mean he got cast out of this one and now he own this one alright don't run from it run to it alright let me keep going so so finally is it maybe render from now on or henceforth the spiritual battle of Christians you are engaged and exist from now on until the Lord's return there is no quarter given no ceasefire no temporary truce no cessation of hostilities right there from now on to the end there is all-out war from now on to the end there is all-out war the remainder of the verse maybe pair of a paraphrase let yourselves constantly be strengthened by the Lord more precisely by his mighty power because it's gonna be all-out war amen forget about your peace agreement with the devil it ain't gonna happen alright let's let's look at this put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil and what they're saying here to stand has military overtones right to stand it has military overtones this verb was used in classical Greek meaning to resist the enemy and hold a critical position in battle right so when you're in battle you got to hold your critical position don't don't give that to the enemy once you got it once you've gone into something you know don't give up that little spot amen it might be it might be the the difference between defeat or victory glory to God I mean I was telling you how George Washington got those guys for battles like look if they give up if they retreat they go back now then we're gonna lose but they took a critical position in the hail to their position go over to God and by them holding to their position it calls George Washington even George Washington wrote amen in between the battle the battle lines he was shot at many times they even said they saw bullet holes in his jacket but don't know how he didn't get his horses went down his jacket is all got bullet holes through it but he didn't go down it took courage for a man to do something like that but when the went went went when his soldiers saw him doing that it caused him to want to fight a little bit more too and because they held their position they overcame the British Army and America is America today because of that battle so to stand right to stand has military over terms or overtones says this verb was used in classical Greek meanings to resist the enemy and hold a critical position in battle the wiles of the devil so you stand against the wiles of the devil and this says the wiles of the devil is is or the devil strategy Satan carefully devises schemes and tactics against believers I want y'all to catch that one Satan carefully devised the schemes and tactics against the enemy and notice what the next verse says so if Satan is carefully devising schemes and tactics against the believers catch this next verse for we wrestle not against flesh and blood so what that should tell you that sometimes Satan uses those that's closest to you and if you're not able to discern and withstand and you get emotional you're gonna get defeated remember Jesus he has somebody really loved him Peter Peter loved them Peter would fight do all kind of stuff but we know Peter Peter made a comment and then Jesus telling how he had to go to the cross and he had to do this and he had to do that in appealing like no no no no you came to that he just kind of rebuking the Lord and Jesus had to tell Peter actually he wasn't talking to Peter he knew who was talking through Peter so he just said get thee behind me Peter he said get thee behind me Satan because Satan was talking through Peter yeah our families can't be anointed by the devil they can be anointed by the Holy Ghost or they can be an honored by the devil the devil will use those that's closest to you hey man that's why yeah you're not you're not wrestling against flesh and blood that's not what they said that's why I said it's not a flesh and blood affair and then the Bible actually tells us who we're wrestling it look at it say for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places all right so you know here we're wrestling and we got to understand that this is not a flesh and blood affair this is a spiritual battle therefore we need spiritual armor in order to overcome hallelujah so the spiritual armor is found here in verse 13 Estelle tells us wherefore take unto it says wherefore wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand all right now let me just work with verse 13 for a little bit but again we have to have a almost remember I said this has military overtones okay that this has military overtones so when you got a military overtone then you have to approach it with a military approach now most most soldiers in there with a military approach there is serious business with them right it's not joking it's not laughing it's not it is serious business and and and and I mean you got a job to do you work for the army right so you got you just I mean it's it is what it is you get an order you got to carry it out bottom line right and we got orders from heaven that we got to carry out we got to stand for this worked hey man look at it glory to God now I I want to just I just want to it's a little note here that says we're for out of verse 13 wherefore means because of this that is because we face such a formidable foe we must avail ourselves of God's provision lest the enemy destroy our Christian witness and ministry right the evil day refers to the periodic demonic onslaught and satanic assaults having done all includes both dressing oneself in God's armor and resisting Satan so not only do you dress yourself in the armor but then you got to resist the devil and this this is every believer right says I am resisting Satan having done all these be ready for the devil I'm just reading a nose I'm reading a nose look he says having done all includes both dressing oneself in God's armor and resisting Satan haven't done all these be ready for the devil will attack again and again no break no letting up he gonna attack again and again glory to God glory to God if I was the accident question how many of y'all left Sunday and went under attack right after the service if I was accessed telling you how to devil do things you in church amen glory as soon as you leave here he don't care you don't care I mean this just just just the church we got to understand this is this is a real battle this is a real battle and and we have to we have to prepare ourselves accordingly hey man it's not gonna stop so don't don't don't even don't don't worry about the truce hey man this is all-out war unto the end glory to God all right can I go I like I like some of these other things they set here so a verse 14 says stand therefore stand therefore take a military stance stand therefore having your loins Girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness now I want to just want to bring out a couple of things here they say truth is a knowledge of the truth of God's Word right so truth is a knowledge now remember I share with you on Sunday how when Jesus defeated the devil heeding you superpowers he used he uses the one thing that the weakest Christian can always use and that's the word of God he used it is written and that put the devil in his place but if you read your Scripture carefully after Jesus defeated those three wall attacks of the devil amen the Bible says that the devil left him for a season I mean here come the devil again with another trial if the devil wouldn't stop messing with Jesus you're not gonna stop messing with you I'm in brother Billy Paul please daddy I'm just so tired of the devil he always owned me he always only say son stop complaining just stop complaining say what'd he say he said son if he's always after you and always owned you that mean he don't have you another statement that they made here that I want y'all to get because it taught us that stand therefore having your loins Girt about with truth now it says the ancient soldiers lowens the waist right we're gird about with a leather belt which he'll most of the other pieces of its armor in place right and so this you know if you don't have truth of the word of God then it's not gonna hold everything else in place right if you don't know if you don't know the scripture amen the devil can just throw anything at you but you got to know where you stand any man Church right so so I mean come in and notice I told you that the devil used somehow to try to bring the word to you they just twist it up a little bit that's why you got it you better be listening to the tapes yourself you better be getting to understanding for what the prophets saying yourself you better be reading your Bible yourself glory to God let God speak to you because otherwise you'll be all confused amen he says this the breastplate of righteousness it represents a holy character holy character and moral conduct now I'm reading their notes I'm reading notes from my Bible the breastplate of righteousness all right is found in verse 14 their stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having having on the breastplate of righteousness they say the breastplate of righteousness a man represents a holy character and moral conduct obedience to the truth now I want to make sure we get this for obedience to the truth no produces a godly life righteousness obedience to the truth no hallelujah obedience to the truth no produces a godly life of righteousness everybody that I have seen come against this truth that's known the one that's revealed through God's prophet William Marion Branham everybody that forsakes that stops living a holy life I didn't think that this just theologians no theologian said obedience that's what the breastplate of righteousness is that almost tells me that you can't even put on the armor if you not follow the truth if you're not gonna follow truth how you gonna put on the armor right how you gonna be girded about if you don't if you don't have the true knowledge of the Word of God you don't have true revelation how you gonna be dressed properly you know that this word is what dresses us for the rapture the reveal word dresses us a man Church so so without truth you you you already defeat it but obedience to the truth no the obedience to the truth known produces a godly life of righteousness that was to me very powerful and it goes on to say this in verse 15 and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace now they made a statement that the preparation of the gospel of peace means eagerness that comes from the gospel of peace that is as the Roman soldier wore special shoes called Cala Gate on his feet this DS D shoes and able him to advance against his enemy not a shoes that they were they were wearing it helped them advance against the enemy now they made a statement says so the Christian must have on his feet a sense of eagerness or willingness to advance against the devil and take the fight to him so when your feet is a sharp with the preparation of the gospel of peace you can actually take the fight to the devil I don't mean you have to always be on the defence but sometimes you can be on the offense now remember David David saw Goliath come out and right now this guy just keep defined you know and let me just put it this way I'm not saying go look for trouble David went looking for trouble David was just there to do his job his job was go sir get this brother give your brother some food that's what dad is sitting there go give your brother some food so he showed up they give food and while he's there to doing his job all of sudden Goliath any like you know I defy the armies of the Living God and and I this and I that and I didn't like who is this uncircumcised philistine David didn't even know his name who say I know you're feeling Stein but who is this uncircumcised person talking like that well David you know you better watch yourself no no and even his brothers this guy I mean don't let them talk like that we don't we the armies of the Living God no he ain't got no business talking like that to us and and the way David start talking it got amongst our army even the army believe this little boy got something I mean sometimes what come out your mouth let people know what's in your heart all right in any light light light night no no you it you ain't gonna just keep talking like that right sorry 6x I mean look I can take him out now what you taught I said man look I already defeated a bed and I defeated line he ain't no bigger than none of them I can take him out all right we're gonna let you talk to Saul Saul got to talking to me like man you just this man's a warrior senses you know his his you know forever now you're just a little baby which come on man well you know he said look I'm sorry I took out a lion I took out a bear I saved my father's sheep I'm ready they say the same God that delivered them into my hand with delivery this went into my hand to say man you talk you talk different than everybody else in the camp I'll tell you what here take my armor go out there and fight the enemy now if Saul gonna give him his armor sword and even trust his own armor but gonna give it to David David said I can't fight with none of this I never proved none of these things keep your armor I got a slingshot and I'm picking five rocks on my way and I'm gonna fight this devil see he was ready to advance against the enemy and there comes a time when sometimes you just got to stand up now I just say go looking for it but sometimes you got to stand up I can give you two quick examples from the Prophet one time he was in a meeting and he saw demons man vesting in the supernatural it was manifesting it was take they took a table and picked it up in the in the middle of the room and and they say anybody here strong enough to pull it down pull it down they got a couple of men and walk up and try to pull the table down could not get the table down demons manifested but brother branham you know look they say that's the devil they say they say you know you say this w pull it down said no ain't got time for this this is devil and so finally they try and say you you you your preacher the Gospels yesterday you you think is the devil he said yeah it is he say he said but it's not of God he said you think you know I'll tell you what he say it says I'm an axe you some questions he says he says he said I can't pull it down but God can you know and he says he says in the name of the Father come down nothing in the name of the son come down nothing in the name of the the Holy Ghost come down nothing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ come down say the table fell and broke the pieces and I didn't do that and today challenge him he had to stand up for who he was he was a believer in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they begin to confess own again this was of the devil another time you know I was just listening recently and there was a fellow that was he was he was criticizing the Word of God and he had a whale that he had dissected that dissect it and they looked at the throat on the world and they said it's impossible for the throat of a whale to swallow a man so that story about Jonah was incorrect so brother Branham sitting there listening say something just rose up in him that he just could not let that man get away with that he'd say pardon me sir excuse me I'm sorry he said he'd say but but the Bible said that it was a a special fish prepared for Jonah that's what it didn't say well is that a special prepare fish he say so maybe not that well Consuela but the one I prepare it swallow them man you have nothing else to say everyone smile God would give you an opportunity to step up and say something now let me let me just make that clear because some of us put ourselves out there everything that go on on social media you don't have to be a part of your name ain't got to be in everything and you ain't doing that just to be friends sometime you need to let some things come to you rather than you're going to it hello somebody alright you don't have to defend this it already defended itself hey man and why you think people don't show up and just just why why you think they take the Battle of the social media only they don't show up to churches and we don't invited a lot of people to to ministers meetings they have not come have not come invited multiple times well you got something come share that the ministers ain't coming why why are you not coming to the ministers ain't coming and got all kind of excuses prove to us you know your points bring it you say you're gonna use the Bible bring your Bible and just show us what you got same thing that brother branham did with them then 400 preachers that said he was preaching wrong on water baptism all right bring your Bibles stand here at the pulpit and disprove it nobody showed up the same thing in the day nobody showing up but they show up on social media and I'm not on social media but I still know what be going on praise the Lord so I'm just telling there everybody here within the sound of my voice you didn't got to be commenting on everything glory to God you got the you some time you learn how to pass right by see and don't see here and don't hear now if they bring it to you it's a different story but if you go to it hey man all right praise the Lord anyhow alright Church glory to God hey man remember any time you on social media you represent in the church all of us are represented and whatever you say glory to God so be care all right so listen this is a this is going on a little further said here your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace okay and and this is so these are these are special shoes so that you can advance on the enemy when you need to all right so the other one says here above all taking the shield of faith a man and what that means it's taking God at is at his word by believing his promises and and when you have trust like this it will protect you from doubt induced by Satan take guard editors were believing all this promises it'll help protect you from doubt induced by say it was in my daily Bible reading a scripture that I ran into today and I was just going just give it to you all real quick maybe my daughter might remember what what what book an Old Testament we gone through where it's talking about these first kings what what chapter 14 first Kings 14 you always throw something at you that's why you can't approach God with intellect you you have to you have to just take it take some things by faith take it by faith look at something here actually I think I want to go to chapter 15 let me just see something here or it might be in 14 I just I'm looking for yeah verse 21 okay it's over in chapter 15 okay yeah verse 9 and then the 20th year of Jeroboam king of Israel reign Asha over Judah forty and one years no I got it I got to go back gotta go back to verse one because I missed something okay now in the 18th year of king jeroboam the son of nebat reign a Bijan over Judah three years reign he in Jerusalem and his mother's name was Makkah the daughter of Absalom and we're talking about Abidjan our Abbey Jam reigned over Judah and his mother's name was Makkah the daughter of Absalom now let's I'm gonna go to verse 8 I'm just skip it a little bit and it says an Abidjan have slept with his fathers and they buried him in the City of David a nasa his son reigned in his stead and the 20th year of Jeroboam king of israel reign astha over Judah and 41 years reign he and Giroux and his mother's name was maka the daughter of AB Absalom who was Oscars mother maka the daughter of Absalom his daddy's name was Abby jam and his daddy's mama happen to be named maka the daughter of a bichon oh I looked at that and say wait a minute now is there a mistake here in the scripture or can see this how the devil will start playing with your mind write this how the devil start playing with your mind and if you're not if you're not careful and just wait on God just to reveal things to you see and I'm using this because these are people come against the message they find something just this small and they're trying to say it was the message must be wrong no no you go you go if you're gonna take it from that approach then you have to look at these scriptures too and actually I don't want to give the answer because it's just go out on out you find the answer or you come see me privately all right but but I want you to notice sometimes you see little things like that in Scripture and if you're not careful the devil throw you off on that but you got to wait on the Lord in order to reveal all things and one thing I will tell you this is talking about a position that this lady was having okay this was a position sometimes as mother it's a it's a position of influence glory to God and she had a certain amount of influence that asar had to come and actually tear down her idols and everything else and take her from her position right because it was a position of influence now I put this a grandma it was his grandmother but she had a position of influence now and I can also show you the same scripture where let me let me let me also this keep reading here verse 11 and acid did that which was right now as the Lord as David his father I thought Abidjan was his father Louis if you're trying to put things together with your intellect right but but all it is it's just it's it's you know you got to see things from the spirit you got to be able to read between the lines when you reading scripture and if you got to read between the lines of read scripture sometime you have to read between the lines I understand this message oh praise the Lord but watch out for that devil alright because what he's trying to do is is get you off of the Word of God and and if you can just kind of give you a little speck of doubt get you doubt in here and doubt in there then he's got you where right where he need you put on the whole armor of God all right let me finish reading this a man the shield of faith means taking God at His Word believing his promises such trust will protect one from doubt induced by seen and this helmet it says and take the helmet of salvation in this water spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints now just a quote and we'll we'll bring it to a close here tonight a man this the Prophet makes some comments here praise the Lord this is out of the message Redemption by power so it's usually in the old soldiers when they put on those ornaments of war they had a big belt that buckled it together holding over their low ends these shields to keep the enemy Spears off what a real lesson that is to us and when the Lord begin to get weak hang down the shield they tighten up on their belt bring them up tight again what a perfect picture today when you begin to feel like you're slacking or the devil says it's no use when you feel like you're slacking or the devil says it's no use reach down and tighten up the belt a little bit pull up the sward a little tighter in the hand and go for it I like that be ready for the March okay and and this other one here I want to bring to you how the greatest battle of a fault and we'll bring it to a close here a man he says how you're going to let this helmet what what was it what was it does it's a protection what does the helmet made out of brass brass can't even be tempered hard harder than iron a brass headpiece the what the salvation knowledge of knowing this and my healing comes from my God my salvation comes from God my experience matches his word not the church's idea the word amen there you are covered over with a protection the helmet of salvation delivers take that then go marching forward oh now now that's what we're supposed to do Satan's army now watch I got a hurry I got to get this in Satan's army brings diseases that's what Satan is he's a destroyer Satan the whole kingdom of Satan is sickness death and sorrow and frustrations and worry all on Satan God is life faith joy peace over here see now that's the two great forces that's coming together right now they're battling they're battling right here in the building right now they battle day by day with you every for Satan following you along that great big kindly priestly Goliath trying to scare to live out of you he's right but God I like that he's right but God's your fortified Amen with the gospel with the word of truth around your Lord glory preacher that's what it is helmet of salvation the shield of faith the Swart waving it in your hand Satan I'm coming to meet you see look at that that's not that's not a a position where you actually own the defense when I'm coming to meet you I'm on the office I got my feet shop the preparation of the gospel of peace I'm Satan I'm coming to meet you you meet me in the name of science you meet me in the name of culture you meet me in the name of organization you meet me in the name of this that or the other but I'll meet you in the name of the Lord God of Israel I'm coming after you giveaway even death itself can't stand there chop a hole right through it that's right it goes on to say the Satan's army brings diseases and God's army is commissioned to cast them out hey man there you are every time Satan throws any own onto you God's army is to cast him out a man cast out that's the very technique that God used Satan used the army of destruction to disbelieve God's Word and set him up a better Kingdom than Michael Han and God cast them out God's method is cast out the evil cast down reasoning cast down super Stu superstition cast down worried cast down diseases cast down sin if I could just act cast down emotion right a man you're above it resurrected in Christ Jesus sitting in heavenly places with every devil under your foot if he starts to stick his head in there and he says you know you're dead your life is here what is dead you're dead to your senses you're dead to your conscience your own human will would say yes I guess dead to your reasoning dead to all those things and you were buried in the name of Jesus Christ and raised with him and wherever he is there you are also what happened when them one of them doubters God in heaven God kicked him out and what did he say to the soldiers that raised in Christ when a devil when when a devil comes along kick him out look notice those those words didn't say pet him and play with him and compromise with him kick him out cast him out when Jesus trained disarming commissioned him to the ends of the world go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow follow the believers my soldiers in my name they shall cast out Devils speak with neutrons take up serpents or drink deadly things it wouldn't harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover onward Christian soldiers marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before I'm crucified with him nevertheless I live not me that lived but he that liveth in me the word going on before God cutting away with this sharp two-edged sword Church I encourage you put on the whole armor of God as you go into one more battle a man keep fighting we're gonna fight to the end after we leave here another battle some so y'all get out of church somebody gonna call you and got something to sing glory to God and sometime I find it so strange how people that don't even go to this church know everything that go on in the church that much do you watch the videos if so praise the Lord then one day something gonna strike revelation is striking and you come out of that thing one more battle Church keep pressing on let's bring father we thank you for your word and got just a few things here that we could glean from and how we just we realized that like that that finally finally it means there's no stopping no truce no no break it's all-out war from here from now until the time we leave this earth it's all-out war so since the devil is trying to defeat us we gotta be just as motivated to defeat him and God we got it sometimes take the battle right to them not running from them all the time but sometimes taking it right to them and realizing that even after we overcome he's coming back with something else so we'll overcome that too and will constantly be victorious that is what you called us to do and you didn't call us here to be on a picnic you called us to fight we're soldiers in the army of the Lord and as we look back in Scripture and see all those that have overcome then God we are also in the in that line and we shall overcome because you overcame we can't overcome our song help us to take the word use it it's the greatest weapon that you could give us Lord and I believe the trial Lord is the greatest greatest greatest gift that you could give us so help us Lord to welcome it and not to embrace it not to run from it God is our prayer we give you all the glory all the honor and all the praise also Lord just wanted at this time I also remember brother Quentin in prayer his father had a little episode there this morning and God we just thank you for just being there with them and as he's going Lord just to see about his dad we pray for traveling mercies and pray God that you just continue to strengthen and raise him up more that you would touch him in his body that you God would just move by your spirit upon him we just commit and father into your capable hands we know that you're more than able that God is we even as we bring the service too close here tonight and we pray that you would just go with us thank you for bringing us back into the house of the Lord but as we leave Lord may we go encouraged and strengthened by the word of God may you bring us back at the point at time Sunday wanted to come for prayer and Sunday School worship we have communion Sunday evening what we just were just grateful and my heart also goes out father as we prepare to bring closure to this this face of our school we know God that you'll take us forward and we're just looking forward to the doors that you have in front of us that y'all has to walk through we're looking we're just under expectation for these great things so God we think in advance and we we just appreciate all that you have done we appreciate all that you've promised to do and we also appreciate what you're doing for us right now it's in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus that we pray amen and amen glory to God amen as we let's just sing this one last song and we'll prepare to dismiss Conqueror victorious brain [Music] with Jesus I'm seething in heavenly
