[53:56] well read on this wise uh it says
[53:59] likewise
[54:01] ye younger
[54:02] submit yourselves unto the Elder
[54:07] yea all of you be subject one to another
[54:11] and be clothed with humility
[54:15] for God resisted the proud and giveth
[54:19] grace to the humble
[54:21] humble yourselves therefore under the
[54:24] mighty hand of God
[54:26] that he may exalt you in due time
[54:31] casting all your care upon him
[54:35] for he cares for you
[54:38] be sober

[54:58] in the faith knowing that the same
[55:02] afflictions are accomplished in your

[55:45] I just want to take my time here if
[55:47] that's all right

[55:52] Pastor Cayman and he told me uh
[55:57] he want me to
[55:59] preach this uh Father's Day
[56:02] I told him I said man I don't know if I
[56:04] can do that
[56:06] that's going to be hard for me
[56:08] because today is my dad's birthday
[56:12] I said I said Jack I don't I don't know
[56:14] what man he said you could do it I say
[56:17] man I don't want to be up there crying
[56:18] all over the people
[56:20] mess up the mic and everything he said
[56:23] he said get your message out you can cry
[56:26] all you want after that
[56:31] I said all right
[56:34] I said okay I'll accept it
[56:37] not knowing
[56:40] that the tears that I've shared this
[56:42] morning wasn't so much for my dad
[56:45] but my mama
[56:50] God is good
[56:53] God is good
[56:54] I have to share the testimony
[56:58] uh on Wednesday night they were saying
[57:02] that tomorrow which would be that
[57:04] Thursday that they would have to go in
[57:05] and do surgery
[57:09] and uh the doctor came in and he
[57:12] explained everything to my sisters who
[57:14] were there
[57:16] and uh
[57:18] say well you know it's going to be risky
[57:22] and uh he just did not leave
[57:26] a real good report
[57:29] kind of left I'm gonna do the best I can
[57:32] uh but there's a long you know he just
[57:34] went into some things and had everybody
[57:36] kind of shook up a little bit
[57:40] so I uh
[57:43] I didn't want to go up there right then
[57:47] everyone was there
[57:49] I didn't what I had to do I didn't want
[57:52] a whole lot of people there
[57:56] so I was supposed to go into work that
[57:57] night
[58:00] and my boss is on vacation so I called
[58:03] him on vacation and say listen
[58:05] I'm not going to be there on time I said
[58:08] I'll make it Lord will it
[58:11] but I'm gonna I I got something I have
[58:14] to do
[58:17] so we came on here to Bible study and
[58:20] and let me let me let me stop here and
[58:22] say God bless you brother Jerry
[58:25] what a marvelous message on Wednesday
[58:28] night
[58:30] he kind of just took the whole thing I
[58:32] was hoping to get up and do some
[58:33] commenting because I had a little bit of
[58:36] the excerpt message I wanted to go with
[58:37] behind that that brother preached us so
[58:40] well I was like man I got something to
[58:42] say he wouldn't let me get up here
[58:43] that's a good thing
[58:45] he just has keep it back I got it from
[58:48] here I said okay brother because boy I
[58:50] was fitting to come behind you on that
[58:52] one
[58:53] so
[58:56] I left here
[58:57] and uh I went up to the hospital
[59:01] and it was just me and Mama
[59:05] I said well Ma
[59:08] they say they gonna do surgery
[59:10] now Mama tested them I'ma be all right
[59:16] I say I believe you
[59:18] I I stand in faith with you
[59:22] but and so it happened if it happened
[59:26] is your soul ready to meet Jesus
[59:30] see the healing of your body is one
[59:33] thing
[59:35] but the healing of your soul is a is
[59:37] another thing
[59:40] you know in times of trouble like that
[59:42] people quote Isaiah 55
[59:46] but you have to understand that that's a
[59:49] dual atonement
[59:51] what good would it do to raise you up
[59:54] healthy
[59:55] amen and you lose your soul
[59:58] if if it's going to save your soul I'd
[1:00:01] rather him take you now
[1:00:07] so I began to just speak with her there
[1:00:10] laying in that hospital bed
[1:00:14] and I say she said
[1:00:17] honey I repented but I don't know if God
[1:00:20] accept my repentance
[1:00:23] I say mama
[1:00:25] the only thing that worketh repentance
[1:00:28] is a real Godly sorrow
[1:00:31] you can say stuff with your mouth as
[1:00:34] much as you want to but unless there's a
[1:00:36] sorrow in your heart it means nothing
[1:00:42] so much for these dry eye confessions
[1:00:46] you just saying stuff but is it from
[1:00:50] your heart
[1:00:51] to where it's not you you you got to get
[1:00:55] desperate with God
[1:00:57] you got to mean it in this hour
[1:01:01] say mama you going under in the morning
[1:01:05] we don't know what's gonna isn't right
[1:01:09] let me tell you something
[1:01:12] thank God
[1:01:14] my mama got the ring in her hands I
[1:01:17] thought she was gonna hop off that
[1:01:18] hospital bed
[1:01:20] ringing her hands tears flowing from my
[1:01:23] eyes and say God I'm sorry I'm sorry
[1:01:27] Lord I've done so much I'm sorry I'm
[1:01:30] sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry and just
[1:01:33] weeping and crying and Lord I'm sorry
[1:01:35] I'm sorry I say that's it Mama
[1:01:40] she weeping I'm weeping the nurse
[1:01:43] weeping everybody on the floor here say
[1:01:47] Lord what's going on in there
[1:01:52] for the next two hours we pray
[1:01:59] she in the bed I'm in the corner on the
[1:02:02] floor
[1:02:03] my God we need you right now Lord
[1:02:08] I I wouldn't I say mama I'm not going to
[1:02:11] stop praying until I feel a release in
[1:02:13] my spirit
[1:02:15] then I can go to work with peace
[1:02:20] and I thank God
[1:02:22] I say Lord I feel I feel your presence
[1:02:24] Lord
[1:02:25] I feel your presence Lord
[1:02:28] so we went on to work the next morning
[1:02:32] and my sisters and everybody was there
[1:02:36] so when they willed off to surgery my
[1:02:38] sister was crying and the last thing she
[1:02:41] said is hunted on where God got me
[1:02:48] and I'm just happy to say that she went
[1:02:50] through the surgery
[1:02:53] and came out of the ICU within those one
[1:02:57] day
[1:02:59] and have a picture of her sitting up in
[1:03:01] her hospital bed smiling
[1:03:05] [Applause]
[1:03:07] I say God you are a mighty God
[1:03:15] I thank you Lord
[1:03:18] so before brother Jack left
[1:03:21] we both went up there and he said I he
[1:03:24] was telling her about the church
[1:03:26] and he said I look forward to seeing you
[1:03:28] in church
[1:03:31] so your purpose is your protection
[1:03:35] [Laughter]
[1:03:39] so I'm looking forward to
[1:03:41] AI New Church
[1:03:44] and B to see my mama walk through the
[1:03:46] doors
[1:03:48] [Applause]
[1:03:51] so I thought I'd be weeping over my
[1:03:53] daddy
[1:03:55] but my mama got these teals
[1:03:58] I thank God
[1:04:00] amen for what he's doing
[1:04:04] I talked to her and I say you need to be
[1:04:07] a witness uh for your girls
[1:04:11] and I
[1:04:13] told my sister
[1:04:15] what mama said about coming to church
[1:04:19] and she said the day Mama come to your
[1:04:22] church I'm gonna be right by our side
[1:04:25] [Applause]
[1:04:27] I said you ain't got to challenge God
[1:04:31] cause he'll meet the challenge
[1:04:34] [Applause]
[1:04:35] [Laughter]
[1:04:37] he'll meet the challenge
[1:04:41] amen
[1:04:42] you love the Lord I'm going to start out
[1:04:44] right with the quote here
[1:04:47] amen
[1:04:49] I believe today
[1:04:51] amen we have a Divine appointment
[1:04:56] somebody here has a Divine appointment
[1:05:02] you know speaking on
[1:05:04] these things everybody has a appointed
[1:05:07] time when they'll leave this earth
[1:05:11] it will either leave it by the grave or
[1:05:14] we'll be raptured away
[1:05:17] but everybody has a an appointment
[1:05:21] we don't know the day nor the hour
[1:05:24] amen but uh we live for Jesus while we
[1:05:29] can
[1:05:31] but there's also another appointed day
[1:05:34] in our lives in the lives of the
[1:05:37] Believers
[1:05:39] it's an appointed time an appointed day
[1:05:42] amen when uh uh uh you hear from your
[1:05:47] theophany
[1:05:49] there's an appointed time and appointed
[1:05:52] day where it's your day amen where God
[1:05:56] uh uh uh uh uh uh rings in your ear
[1:06:02] touches your heart
[1:06:04] to where your change takes place
[1:06:09] is this your appointed time
[1:06:12] it's once a time for a man to be born
[1:06:16] and then the man to be born again
[1:06:20] then die and from this Earth because
[1:06:23] once you're born of that second time you
[1:06:26] never die
[1:06:28] amen death is no longer
[1:06:31] come to you because see life means or
[1:06:35] death means to be eternally separated
[1:06:38] from God
[1:06:40] where amen once you're born again
[1:06:44] you'll never be separated that's the
[1:06:47] life that we want
[1:06:49] so today
[1:06:51] I pray that someone has a Divine
[1:06:53] appointment
[1:06:56] when you meet God for yourself
[1:07:00] I'm not talking about reading about him
[1:07:02] in the book I'm not talking about
[1:07:04] someone telling you something about the
[1:07:06] dirty old father on the throne I'm
[1:07:09] talking about a day when your heart is
[1:07:12] pricked
[1:07:14] and you say what must I do
[1:07:18] to be saved
[1:07:21] Change Me O Lord From Within
[1:07:24] I'm tired of living the way I've been
[1:07:27] living I'm tired of going that old way
[1:07:31] there's nothing else more important
[1:07:34] because I'ma tell you something your day
[1:07:36] is coming
[1:07:38] the old folks used to say payday is
[1:07:40] coming after a while
[1:07:43] payday is coming after a while
[1:07:46] amen
[1:07:49] yeah bear with me this technology I
[1:07:50] don't think there it is didn't recognize
[1:07:53] my glasses I guess
[1:07:55] I open it up
[1:07:57] hey man I'm going to move this to the
[1:07:59] side
[1:08:04] because I got it all right here
[1:08:07] amen I want to start out with a quote
[1:08:10] oh
[1:08:12] in times
[1:08:14] signed seed
[1:08:16] uh 6203 19
[1:08:21] I hope it's the same one as E28
[1:08:23] paragraph E28 and it reads I'm going to
[1:08:27] speak of a man
[1:08:30] by the name of job
[1:08:32] for a few moments
[1:08:34] he says that's the oldest book in the
[1:08:36] Bible
[1:08:38] we understand that job was one of the
[1:08:41] wisest men in the world
[1:08:45] of his day
[1:08:48] why he said when he go to the markets
[1:08:52] the young princes
[1:08:55] would bow before him
[1:08:57] for wisdom
[1:08:59] he was a great man
[1:09:03] and I'll stop right there
[1:09:07] we looking at job here let us go to the
[1:09:11] scripture
[1:09:12] Revelation I've read this several times
[1:09:15] in the
[1:09:17] recent future
[1:09:19] or a recent past I should say
[1:09:22] Revelation 21 3 and 4.
[1:09:28] Revelation the 21st chapter
[1:09:31] the third through the fourth verse
[1:09:36] it says I heard a great voice
[1:09:39] Out of Heaven saying behold the
[1:09:41] Tabernacle of God is with men
[1:09:45] and he will dwell with them
[1:09:48] and they shall be his people
[1:09:52] and God himself shall be with them
[1:09:57] and God himself
[1:09:59] shall be with them
[1:10:02] and be their God
[1:10:05] and God
[1:10:08] shall wipe away
[1:10:11] all tears from their eyes
[1:10:15] and there and there shall be no more
[1:10:18] death
[1:10:20] neither sorrow
[1:10:22] nor crying
[1:10:24] neither shall there be any more pain
[1:10:29] now I want you to notice here
[1:10:32] for these that
[1:10:36] shall be no more death
[1:10:38] sorrow crying and pain for the former
[1:10:43] things are passed away
[1:10:48] now
[1:10:49] there are many different types of
[1:10:50] Sorrows
[1:10:52] and disappointments in this human life
[1:10:56] we go through sufferings
[1:10:59] we go through crying
[1:11:01] there's many different uh uh levels and
[1:11:04] different types of pain
[1:11:07] amen
[1:11:09] a child could die
[1:11:12] that is a pain
[1:11:14] that that that that that that is
[1:11:17] tremendous apparent
[1:11:20] loved one
[1:11:22] a friend
[1:11:25] these things cause us great pain
[1:11:28] we see in job
[1:11:32] it says that he was a upright man
[1:11:37] I remember someone asking me a question
[1:11:39] one time that said why does bad things
[1:11:41] happen to good people
[1:11:46] and I think I responded well why does
[1:11:48] good things happen to bad people
[1:11:49] [Music]
[1:11:52] see
[1:11:55] so
[1:11:56] I can scope and it's bad things
[1:11:59] sometimes happen to good people
[1:12:02] for the glory of God
[1:12:05] simply for God's glory
[1:12:08] because as we look at the story of job
[1:12:10] here just for a little bit
[1:12:13] and we see that job went through great
[1:12:15] pain
[1:12:18] he lost his children
[1:12:20] now a lot of times when we see that lost
[1:12:23] that can go a compound meaning
[1:12:28] they could have that literally died
[1:12:33] amen but see to be separated from God is
[1:12:37] also a type of death
[1:12:44] he lost
[1:12:45] all of his livestock and his cattle
[1:12:50] so sometimes we go through pain
[1:12:53] if we of loss
[1:12:57] when we lose possession
[1:13:00] we may lose a job and and feel like Lord
[1:13:04] why me
[1:13:07] what I mean
[1:13:10] Joel also suffered the pain of rejection
[1:13:18] his friends turned his back on him
[1:13:22] even his servants and things that he had
[1:13:26] in his house uh he called and they they
[1:13:28] just had no respect for him anymore
[1:13:33] imagine Joe
[1:13:36] they are saying what have I done
[1:13:39] to deserve this now remember he went
[1:13:41] from from from from from from one end to
[1:13:44] the other Spectrum
[1:13:46] well he'll just walk in the streets and
[1:13:48] the prince is a
[1:13:49] bow to him
[1:13:52] Joe give us some wisdom
[1:13:55] now to the old all the way to the other
[1:13:58] end of the spectrum even his wife in the
[1:14:01] Bible says that that my breast is
[1:14:04] strange to my wife
[1:14:06] now I want you to read between the lines
[1:14:08] that means she cut him off
[1:14:12] didn't want nothing to do with him
[1:14:17] job so got to the point where he uh uh
[1:14:21] on the ass sheet
[1:14:25] not to mention that then the devil
[1:14:28] attacked his body
[1:14:31] he was suffering physical pain
[1:14:35] I can imagine those boils on his body
[1:14:38] was quite painful
[1:14:41] so Joe Knows something about pain
[1:14:45] everybody in here knows something about
[1:14:48] pain
[1:14:50] no something when you just all you can
[1:14:53] do is cry
[1:14:55] maybe a divorce
[1:14:58] or a betrayal
[1:15:02] what did I do Lord to deserve this
[1:15:06] weeping
[1:15:09] songwriter said he bottles up every tip
[1:15:15] amen
[1:15:18] so pain
[1:15:20] disappointment
[1:15:22] rejection
[1:15:25] is a part of this life
[1:15:28] everyone within the sound of my voice
[1:15:31] has experienced it
[1:15:35] but I thank God he said
[1:15:37] he'll wipe away
[1:15:40] every chair
[1:15:43] there'll be no more
[1:15:46] pain
[1:15:47] no more sorrow
[1:15:50] no more Hardy
[1:15:53] amen
[1:15:57] but while we're here on this side
[1:16:00] that pain in that heartache
[1:16:03] for a purpose
[1:16:06] that pain and those things that we go
[1:16:09] through is what drives us
[1:16:13] to God
[1:16:18] amen I forgot to mention this is a
[1:16:20] Father's day did I say Happy Father's
[1:16:22] Day
[1:16:24] this message is
[1:16:27] for everybody
[1:16:30] but I kind of get it for fathers
[1:16:33] for fathers for the men Folk
[1:16:37] brother smiling on Mother's Day gave
[1:16:39] their sisters a real good message
[1:16:42] but this one is for us
[1:16:45] but I hope the sisters get something out
[1:16:47] of it as well
[1:16:49] so because see sometimes as men we we we
[1:16:52] we man we we we we we we go through some
[1:16:55] things
[1:16:56] and you know what about men we
[1:16:57] internalize it and we hold it
[1:17:02] behold it see because because God has
[1:17:04] has charged us
[1:17:06] amen uh uh uh to be rulers and leaders
[1:17:13] we supposed to have all the answers
[1:17:16] sometimes we don't
[1:17:20] sometimes we could just we just crying
[1:17:23] out Lord
[1:17:25] give me the answer show me what to do
[1:17:27] here
[1:17:28] so job found himself
[1:17:31] Amen in a position
[1:17:34] where he just couldn't explain what was
[1:17:35] going on
[1:17:37] amen
[1:17:39] he was uh a man of great means and a man
[1:17:43] of great substance that everything was
[1:17:45] just going haywire in his life
[1:17:49] people begin to accuse them of things
[1:17:54] but Joe
[1:17:56] in the midst
[1:17:58] of the trial
[1:18:00] God gave him a revelation
[1:18:04] in the midst of his rejection
[1:18:07] God gave him a revelation of the
[1:18:10] resurrection and job said yet in my
[1:18:14] flesh
[1:18:16] I shall see God
[1:18:18] I want you to understand that Joe
[1:18:22] through the rejection
[1:18:26] amen found that uh uh uh uh there will
[1:18:31] be a resurrection because see that was
[1:18:33] one of the things that he pounded on
[1:18:35] he said is that there's a tree uh uh
[1:18:38] living it it goes into the ground and
[1:18:41] dies and they come back and said what
[1:18:42] about men
[1:18:44] this was something that was on job's
[1:18:46] heart
[1:18:48] but through what he was going through
[1:18:50] God gave him a revelation through the
[1:18:55] rejection of the Resurrection
[1:19:00] one of the things that Satan said to to
[1:19:02] God when he was considering job he said
[1:19:06] I'll make him curse you to your face
[1:19:10] now those were some powerful words
[1:19:14] but those words
[1:19:16] had deep meaning
[1:19:18] because see only
[1:19:20] in this time and in this hour
[1:19:24] can a man Curse God to his face because
[1:19:27] see when you come face to face with God
[1:19:30] what that means is you come to the full
[1:19:33] revelation of who he is
[1:19:35] so let me tell you something that was a
[1:19:37] direct challenge to the Believers in
[1:19:40] this hour he said I'll make you curse
[1:19:43] God to his face
[1:19:47] see that one for any other age because
[1:19:49] they didn't have the face
[1:19:51] amen they were seeking to God
[1:19:54] amen but in this day and in this time we
[1:19:57] had a Prophet come amen
[1:20:00] and those angels came in 1962 revealing
[1:20:04] the four Ministry revealing the full
[1:20:06] revelation of Christ in this hour
[1:20:13] I may concursion to your face
[1:20:16] so when we going through these things
[1:20:17] and we're going through the trial what
[1:20:19] is that that's the same old Devil with
[1:20:22] the same old tactic trying to make you
[1:20:25] curse God to his face
[1:20:32] amen
[1:20:34] so we see Joe
[1:20:37] suffered rejection
[1:20:39] but God had confidence he told the devil
[1:20:42] he said you can touch his body
[1:20:43] you can touch all those things but don't
[1:20:45] touch his soul
[1:20:47] you can't touch your soul and I believe
[1:20:49] this morning amen that the same
[1:20:52] conversation goes on with God and the
[1:20:55] devil about you here this morning
[1:20:58] amen he put boundaries on the devil and
[1:21:01] say you can't touch his soul
[1:21:04] so what you're going through
[1:21:07] the pains and The Agony and the stress
[1:21:10] amen of this life
[1:21:13] amen
[1:21:14] hang in there
[1:21:16] be steadfast
[1:21:18] be like Joe
[1:21:20] no matter what you take me through I'm
[1:21:24] gonna trust God
[1:21:28] even unto death I'm gonna trust God
[1:21:31] [Applause]
[1:21:34] I refuse to curse God to his face
[1:21:40] he is my redeemer
[1:21:42] amen I want I want to look at another
[1:21:46] Soldier
[1:21:49] this morning
[1:21:51] amen
[1:21:53] a man
[1:21:55] who who who who I'm showing you job man
[1:21:58] who did nothing wrong
[1:22:01] but sometimes we do wrong
[1:22:05] and I want to show you a man
[1:22:08] a man who might have done wrong
[1:22:10] ain't no might have he he I'm talking
[1:22:13] about Jacob
[1:22:17] just a mere name
[1:22:20] means a Deceiver
[1:22:23] liar shyster
[1:22:28] amen
[1:22:30] but Jacob had a promise
[1:22:33] even from the womb
[1:22:37] the Bible says Jacob have I loved
[1:22:41] and Esau I hate it why because Jacob had
[1:22:45] a hunger for the birthright
[1:22:49] amen and he was persistent
[1:22:53] but Jacob as a bad fella
[1:22:57] he'll lie to his mama
[1:23:00] Daddy
[1:23:02] and anybody else
[1:23:06] now this man did some wrong he wasn't
[1:23:08] like Joel
[1:23:10] he deserved what he got
[1:23:15] but you can't touch his soul
[1:23:19] even in his wrong doing
[1:23:24] Jacob have I loved
[1:23:27] her and I see most people look at that I
[1:23:29] just don't understand that
[1:23:32] but you don't understand the
[1:23:33] foreknowledge of God
[1:23:35] why because you have the inability to
[1:23:38] read between the lines of the scripture
[1:23:42] it takes a prophetic anointing
[1:23:45] to read between the lines
[1:23:48] amen when we read the message books and
[1:23:53] we read the Bible
[1:23:54] what are we doing we're reading between
[1:23:57] the lines
[1:23:59] and when I remember one time when the
[1:24:01] prophet was explaining
[1:24:03] David
[1:24:05] he said some little redhead curly head
[1:24:08] boy
[1:24:10] I say wow
[1:24:12] how did he know that
[1:24:14] we're reading between the lines
[1:24:16] most people look at the story of David
[1:24:19] and thought that he must have been some
[1:24:20] powerful man strong
[1:24:22] big muscles
[1:24:24] some little he called Samson a little
[1:24:27] curly head
[1:24:33] you would think that his Guy picked up
[1:24:35] defense in the gates and slew all kind
[1:24:38] of Philistines and went to the pillars
[1:24:40] and pushed down the post that he was
[1:24:42] some big strong man
[1:24:45] no just some little fella
[1:24:47] but he had a call
[1:24:51] but he had a call
[1:24:53] he had a vowel amen a Nazarite vow
[1:24:58] so
[1:25:00] we look here at Jacob
[1:25:03] Jacob had done all kind of things
[1:25:06] amen
[1:25:09] and he was on the run because he had
[1:25:11] done tricked his father into the
[1:25:13] birthright
[1:25:16] and that Saul was a man
[1:25:19] a man's man
[1:25:22] he was a great hunter
[1:25:25] and and and and and and a good Hunter no
[1:25:29] you know he can do certain things with
[1:25:31] that boring Arrow
[1:25:33] know how to stick that deer where he
[1:25:36] ain't running a whole lot
[1:25:38] get him right to vital organs
[1:25:41] put that Arrow right on his spine and
[1:25:43] break his spine while he dropped right
[1:25:45] where he at
[1:25:48] and he knew this about Saul
[1:25:51] Saucy I'mma kill him
[1:25:52] he took my Birthright
[1:25:55] no doubt Jacob was scared took off I
[1:25:58] gotta go he go he gonna kill me
[1:26:04] but Jacob had a promise
[1:26:07] let me tell you something my brothers
[1:26:09] and sisters God don't make a promise
[1:26:11] he don't make empty promises
[1:26:14] when he make a promise there's someone
[1:26:17] to receive the promise
[1:26:19] yeah
[1:26:20] he not just making blank promises and
[1:26:23] throwing in the air the who no he
[1:26:25] already know who he making a promise to
[1:26:28] amen
[1:26:31] amen when I stood at the altar tomorrow
[1:26:33] what Dad my wife we got mad I know who I
[1:26:37] was making a promise to
[1:26:40] Jacob didn't the first time
[1:26:43] got tricked
[1:26:48] got tricked
[1:26:50] but he stayed there until he got the one
[1:26:53] he wanted
[1:26:56] I jingle something else see what happens
[1:26:58] what you do or come back on you
[1:27:01] what you do will come back on you
[1:27:07] amen sin got to be paid for
[1:27:11] I say sin got to be paid for
[1:27:15] but the thing I want to get you to see
[1:27:17] here
[1:27:19] is Jacob
[1:27:21] he had an appointed
[1:27:23] and a Divine appointment
[1:27:26] he got to a point that one day he got
[1:27:29] tired of running
[1:27:31] so he told all of his servants and and
[1:27:34] all of them to say y'all go ahead I got
[1:27:36] to deal with this today
[1:27:38] I'm tired of running
[1:27:40] I got my wife here the one I wanted
[1:27:43] I want to just settle down and quit
[1:27:46] running but Esau still after me
[1:27:49] after all these years so he went back
[1:27:54] amen
[1:27:56] and he had he had a talk with Jesus
[1:28:01] and you see in this life the point that
[1:28:03] I want to get across to you is that you
[1:28:06] have to amen nothing is going to save
[1:28:10] you outside of the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:13] Ghost
[1:28:16] amen now it's all right
[1:28:19] it's good
[1:28:20] quote the sinner's prayer
[1:28:23] and and everything but you have to go
[1:28:26] all the way with God
[1:28:28] amen
[1:28:30] you have to be hungry in this hour for
[1:28:33] the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:28:36] amen we don't want to serve God out of
[1:28:38] tradition
[1:28:40] many people today are caught up in
[1:28:43] serving God out of tradition
[1:28:47] just because you come to church that's
[1:28:50] that that that that that that ain't it
[1:28:54] why are you going to church
[1:28:57] see once you get the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:00] Ghost amen you'll do more than just come
[1:29:02] to church
[1:29:07] you get your heart prepared for service
[1:29:10] in the morning Amen on Wednesday night
[1:29:13] services you'll you see what the
[1:29:16] announcements are made amen with the
[1:29:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost you say I got
[1:29:20] to get to Bible study
[1:29:24] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[1:29:27] put away a lot of those excuses
[1:29:30] because you realize there's nothing else
[1:29:33] more important
[1:29:36] and sometimes a lot of us we've been
[1:29:39] saved a while
[1:29:40] and we find ourselves getting a little
[1:29:43] relaxed the Bible says that there's also
[1:29:46] a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:52] sometimes we get a little slowful about
[1:29:54] God
[1:29:56] and then sometimes we get a little weak
[1:29:58] in our flesh
[1:30:00] amen we need something to charge us up
[1:30:06] we don't want to lose the sincerity in
[1:30:08] this hour
[1:30:10] because he's still a roaring lion now
[1:30:14] amen and there's still trouble on the
[1:30:17] horizon
[1:30:18] you want to keep yourself in a place
[1:30:20] Lord that I can deal with it
[1:30:25] let me explain that
[1:30:27] now I trust me when I say I pr when when
[1:30:30] these ministers get up here I could
[1:30:33] speak for myself and I think I speak for
[1:30:34] my brothers a lot of times when we are
[1:30:37] coming up with these messages and the
[1:30:39] Lord give us the auction to say things
[1:30:41] we can cut too
[1:30:46] but we ain't no greater than you this is
[1:30:48] just a lot that I'm placed in at this
[1:30:50] time
[1:30:51] but it's a double-edged sword
[1:30:57] amen
[1:31:01] brothers and sisters
[1:31:03] don't get complacent about God
[1:31:08] you see Jacob Jacob had got to a point
[1:31:12] amen well you know he sound pretty safe
[1:31:15] over there in laban's Camp
[1:31:17] amen and he got just a little bit
[1:31:19] religious
[1:31:21] got a little bit complacent
[1:31:24] soon as he left he saw on his tail
[1:31:27] and he said this is it
[1:31:30] I'm tired
[1:31:32] tired of running so he had a talk with
[1:31:35] the angel
[1:31:37] Jacob wrestled with the angel
[1:31:41] Jacob got to a point and he said I'm not
[1:31:44] gonna let go
[1:31:47] till you bless my soul
[1:31:50] now I'm intentionally calling him Jacob
[1:31:54] because Jacob means a shyster
[1:31:59] he still had an old nature
[1:32:03] but Jacob fought
[1:32:05] and he fought
[1:32:07] and he held on
[1:32:09] all night long
[1:32:13] how many are willing to fight if it take
[1:32:17] all night long
[1:32:19] and say I won't let go till you bless my
[1:32:22] soul
[1:32:24] until you get it like that amen you're
[1:32:28] not gonna get it right
[1:32:31] amen
[1:32:34] amen Jacob said I died
[1:32:38] the Lord that angel blessed him
[1:32:42] and he said
[1:32:43] I'll no longer call you Jacob
[1:32:47] but I'll call you Israel
[1:32:50] Israel means blessed
[1:32:53] so he was no longer a shyster
[1:32:56] no longer a liar
[1:32:58] no longer a Deceiver
[1:33:01] he had taken on a whole new nature
[1:33:08] why because he had children
[1:33:12] see there's something about when you
[1:33:13] have children
[1:33:15] amen now to change a man
[1:33:19] remember a young man
[1:33:22] was having a child wife was in there in
[1:33:25] labor
[1:33:28] and I simply asked him one question
[1:33:31] I say do you feel that
[1:33:35] he said
[1:33:36] no I'm sorry I don't know what you're
[1:33:37] talking about I don't feel anything
[1:33:40] I say do you feel I say brother you feel
[1:33:42] it
[1:33:44] he said what are you talking about that
[1:33:47] heavy load
[1:33:50] that load of responsibility
[1:33:53] because I remember when I had my first
[1:33:55] my wife and I went to the hospital she
[1:33:58] was C-section
[1:34:00] and and and and we came in
[1:34:04] amen and uh
[1:34:06] I'm sorry did I say something ain't
[1:34:08] supposed to say I'm sorry
[1:34:10] okay I'm all right because you know how
[1:34:13] sometimes man we we don't know
[1:34:17] all right
[1:34:20] but the thing of it is is that there was
[1:34:23] a there was a whole when we came home
[1:34:26] with that little one
[1:34:28] there's a whole different it was a whole
[1:34:30] different Troy
[1:34:33] I couldn't wait to get up and go to work
[1:34:38] I couldn't wait to get up and go to work
[1:34:42] why because I had a
[1:34:44] little bundle of joy there
[1:34:47] that was dependent on me
[1:34:52] put food in the refrigerator
[1:34:54] Pampers on them clothes on them roof
[1:34:57] over his head
[1:34:58] flow on their feet make him comfortable
[1:35:02] amen it was my responsibility
[1:35:06] so I came home with a different attitude
[1:35:09] I mean I got to do something it was
[1:35:11] right after that I jumped into school
[1:35:14] jumped into school
[1:35:16] I got I I got I got to get Mo this ain't
[1:35:19] enough
[1:35:20] yeah I got to get some more
[1:35:22] that's what he'll depending on me
[1:35:25] then I have two moves
[1:35:27] come behind them I really felt the
[1:35:30] pressure oh Lord Jesus
[1:35:33] what am I gonna do Lord
[1:35:36] but the Lord will make a way
[1:35:39] amen
[1:35:40] he'll make a way
[1:35:43] amen
[1:35:46] so Jacob had a burden
[1:35:49] Amen to quit running he couldn't be that
[1:35:52] kind of father
[1:35:53] running with his children
[1:35:55] and he got and he held on
[1:35:58] now one of the things
[1:36:04] the most important thing I should say
[1:36:08] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:11] because see without the baptism of the
[1:36:13] Holy Ghost
[1:36:14] let's even with the Holy Ghost we're
[1:36:16] going to make mistakes
[1:36:20] but without the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:22] Ghost without leadership without the
[1:36:24] guidance of the great Shepherd
[1:36:27] man you're gonna make a mess
[1:36:31] you're gonna make a mess
[1:36:35] and have regrets
[1:36:39] but you know what
[1:36:41] feel able
[1:36:45] God is still evil
[1:36:49] even in your thoughts
[1:36:52] God is still able to deliver you
[1:36:58] your children
[1:37:00] your children's children
[1:37:03] your mama
[1:37:06] your auntie
[1:37:09] all that you love
[1:37:12] see cause you're not just fighting for
[1:37:14] you
[1:37:16] you're not just fighting for you
[1:37:20] God gave man Dominion
[1:37:24] and he gave man the responsibility
[1:37:29] responsibility
[1:37:32] and I'm going to talk about another man
[1:37:36] in the scripture
[1:37:41] amram
[1:37:47] was a Praying Soldier
[1:37:51] you see
[1:37:53] the children
[1:37:56] of Israel
[1:37:58] remember Jacob's name was turned to
[1:38:00] Israel
[1:38:01] so Jacob's children
[1:38:03] amen we know the story they went down
[1:38:05] into Egypt and was saved from the famine
[1:38:09] because his son Joseph was on the stone
[1:38:14] see even the the trouble that Jacob went
[1:38:16] through
[1:38:18] gave him rest
[1:38:21] through his body

[1:58:55] amen a job to do
[1:58:59] amen
[1:59:00] so he would go down
[1:59:03] uh into the basement the next day
[1:59:06] and he and he told uh his wife
[1:59:09] he come home
[1:59:11] from work
[1:59:13] amen he was especially upset this time
[1:59:18] so
[1:59:20] she said what's what's bothering you she
[1:59:23] say uh uh uh I Am ram I heard the most
[1:59:25] terrible news yo chabelle I turned the
[1:59:28] most terrible news
[1:59:30] you see that was a council meeting today
[1:59:33] and uh there was this one slick fella
[1:59:38] who stood up in the Council of me and
[1:59:40] he's saying uh we're gonna have to do
[1:59:42] something about uh these Israelites they
[1:59:46] have in too many children
[1:59:50] so he said another another old slickster
[1:59:53] stood up and say
[1:59:54] uh uh I gotta I got an idea
[1:59:58] we'll we'll take all of the
[2:00:01] all of the boy babies
[2:00:05] see
[2:00:06] the devil is after the children
[2:00:12] see if if I want you to put your
[2:00:15] spiritual thinking capsule he ain't got
[2:00:17] to
[2:00:17] kill them
[2:00:22] he can even let him go to church
[2:00:29] if I can just keep them away from this
[2:00:31] wood
[2:00:32] I said wood
[2:00:34] not word
[2:00:36] if I could keep them away from it
[2:00:39] it's all right with me
[2:00:41] so he devises all kind of schemes and
[2:00:45] tactics
[2:00:46] to kill the children
[2:00:50] now there they was talking about taking
[2:00:52] the children of two years old or younger
[2:00:54] and they grab them and they tie them up
[2:00:57] and they bash their heads up against the
[2:00:59] wall
[2:01:01] then you take the other ones you man
[2:01:03] then tie them up and thumb to feed the
[2:01:05] crocodiles
[2:01:08] amram was like you got to be kidding me
[2:01:10] not even to take our children
[2:01:13] kill him
[2:01:15] let me tell you something the devil is
[2:01:16] after your children today
[2:01:20] he do worse with bash the head against
[2:01:22] the wall
[2:01:23] turn them over to some vile disgusting
[2:01:25] devil
[2:01:27] have them out here acting all kind of
[2:01:29] unseemly
[2:01:32] get them tied up and dangled Tangled Up
[2:01:35] in some
[2:01:36] fossil Doctrine
[2:01:39] where they lose their identity
[2:01:43] put them up under bondage the worst kind
[2:01:46] of bondage is a religious bondage
[2:01:50] I say the worst kind of bondage is a
[2:01:53] religious bondage
[2:01:54] amen hard to preach to somebody who
[2:01:57] think they know just as much as you do
[2:02:01] you gotta leave him alone until God get
[2:02:04] him to a point where they ready to
[2:02:05] receive
[2:02:07] a lot of times that's laid up on their
[2:02:10] back and sometimes they still won't hear
[2:02:13] you
[2:02:18] in fact they know just as much as you do
[2:02:19] I ain't battling wits with you I'm
[2:02:21] telling you what God does for me
[2:02:23] telling you what I know I'm reading
[2:02:26] between the lines
[2:02:32] so amram
[2:02:35] was aware of this council meeting
[2:02:38] so he had a a more burden a heavier
[2:02:44] burden this time
[2:02:46] so amram goes up to pray
[2:02:50] and he said Lord
[2:02:52] I've been just praying and I'm praying
[2:02:55] and I'm praying
[2:02:57] and it's just getting worse Lord
[2:03:03] praying
[2:03:06] because there was nothing else he could
[2:03:08] do
[2:03:10] I can't raise up an army and start up
[2:03:12] fighting and overtake it and change the
[2:03:15] laws
[2:03:17] that Beast is too big
[2:03:20] but I only know one is bigger than that
[2:03:22] Beast
[2:03:24] that's you Lord
[2:03:26] so he began to tell god of the promises
[2:03:29] that they promised
[2:03:31] he's he would get down there and he
[2:03:33] would pray and pray all night long till
[2:03:36] he would come down and all your Chevelle
[2:03:38] felt so bad for him
[2:03:40] she said look at you
[2:03:42] you're getting pale
[2:03:44] you're getting weak I just swept
[2:03:48] together with tears and when was he
[2:03:51] wasn't down there playing he was there
[2:03:54] was a sincerity about his prayer
[2:03:57] there was a desperation about his prayer
[2:04:01] amen
[2:04:04] oh he kept praying
[2:04:06] so
[2:04:09] one day he went to work again
[2:04:11] out there serving the Taskmaster
[2:04:14] come on tired
[2:04:19] in that hot room they Prophet said he
[2:04:22] worked where he in the furnace area
[2:04:24] where they uh uh mold the bricks
[2:04:27] together
[2:04:28] was standing in front of this furnace
[2:04:30] all day long
[2:04:32] hot
[2:04:33] tired
[2:04:35] I know amram wanted to come home get him
[2:04:38] something to eat and go to bed
[2:04:43] am around so I can't go to bed
[2:04:46] put the kids to bed
[2:04:48] you go on in yourself honey I'll be down
[2:04:50] directly I gotta go talk to God
[2:04:55] I gotta go talk to God
[2:04:58] so amram would go back and he would pray
[2:05:02] he would cry it took it it seemed like
[2:05:05] God you what are you going to answer
[2:05:07] Lord
[2:05:11] so they had another council meeting
[2:05:14] and this one time another slick fella
[2:05:19] oh suit suit guy
[2:05:22] came up
[2:05:25] he said I got another idea
[2:05:29] this time
[2:05:31] you know let's put all the women to work
[2:05:35] let's let them work out in the field too
[2:05:38] so now
[2:05:40] when the men get home
[2:05:43] daytime
[2:05:44] the women tied
[2:05:47] children left alone
[2:05:55] and then they can't make no more babies
[2:06:00] because not a woman frustrated
[2:06:04] man frustrated they come home and get
[2:06:06] them a real good argument going you
[2:06:09] higher than you could why didn't you
[2:06:11] cook I work just as hard as you
[2:06:17] what no Burger King on the corner
[2:06:21] somebody had to heat that fire up
[2:06:24] put some pots on the Fire
[2:06:27] are y'all gonna stall
[2:06:33] see what I'm saying is that devil will
[2:06:35] come and try to disrupt the home
[2:06:40] but guess who went and did something
[2:06:42] about it
[2:06:45] he said go ahead and go to bed Yoshi
[2:06:47] put the kids together
[2:06:49] I got to go talk with God
[2:06:53] Who Am ram
[2:06:55] real daddy
[2:06:57] real good father
[2:07:01] even in the midst of his own struggles
[2:07:05] I gotta get up go to work
[2:07:08] provide
[2:07:12] then I gotta come home and pray
[2:07:17] God gave us Brothers the responsibility
[2:07:25] the responsibility
[2:07:27] yo they don't end when you punch the
[2:07:30] clock
[2:07:33] your date on end when you punch the
[2:07:34] clock you still got work to do
[2:07:40] amen
[2:07:42] I remember
[2:07:45] brother Fred say something to me
[2:07:48] I had backslid
[2:07:51] lost my way but I've always had a
[2:07:54] respect for that fellow
[2:07:56] there's a lot of the way he preached
[2:07:58] preach hard
[2:08:02] and he came up behind me I think I told
[2:08:04] his testimony before he came up behind

[2:08:20] family
[2:08:23] he looked at me and said God don't hold

[2:08:26] away
[2:08:29] I went home that night and all I heard

[2:09:34] why is he going through this it was just
[2:09:37] a burden on his heart
[2:09:39] he understood the responsibility
[2:09:44] I like the way my pastor a
[2:09:46] responsibility is merely the ability to
[2:09:49] respond
[2:09:53] and ambraham responsed he responded
[2:09:57] amen
[2:09:59] to the problem how
[2:10:01] well he didn't go and get us
[2:10:03] start sharpening his sword
[2:10:07] no we ain't gonna win that way
[2:10:10] Army too big
[2:10:13] but he went down on his knee
[2:10:16] and began to talk with God
[2:10:19] there's a big enemy law
[2:10:22] a great Army
[2:10:24] we don't stand a chance against them
[2:10:27] they got us down here they got us all
