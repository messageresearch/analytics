[21:20] [Music]
[21:25] I just wanted most of you have probably
[21:34] heard but black Tuesday was supposed to
[21:37] be my graduation ceremony and as we were
[21:41] waiting for the ceremony to start time
[21:44] kept getting later and later and I was
[21:46] getting texts from my family saying that
[21:48] they are being evacuated from the arena
[21:50] from the auditorium and and I heard from
[21:57] another student that there was a bomb
[21:59] threat and I I don't know why but for
[22:04] some reason my initial feeling was not
[22:06] fear and of course I prayed and I and I
[22:10] asked God for protection but I didn't
[22:13] bill afraid and later I realized it's
[22:17] because we have something that's much
[22:20] greater than any bombed and any threat
[22:22] than anything that the enemy can try to
[22:24] do and I just learned that it's so
[22:30] special to have Jesus as our Savior to
[22:34] have him as our protector and as our key
[22:36] berry so I'm going to sing this hymn I
[22:39] pray that you will join with me

[46:45] all be flexible amen than that and I
[46:47] know there's a number of things coming
[46:48] up a man in the next few weeks where I
[46:50] know there's a wedding coming up we
[46:52] won't have a service on that night
[46:53] because of the wedding you know but I
[46:56] know that up but you know we'll continue
[46:57] to do all we can for the Lord amen so I
[47:00] am wanna just thank the Lord for
[47:07] everybody that was involved with the
[47:11] Okeechobee back-to-school outreach we it
[47:15] was it was it was very successful and so
[47:20] I had some brothers that went out and
[47:23] you know just handing out flyers and
[47:26] things like that some went to the
[47:28] Walmart some went to the neighborhood
[47:30] but you know that that turned out nice
[47:33] assistant dean and everyone that helped
[47:35] her just kind of get the bags together I
[47:37] think we took roughly a hundred and
[47:40] something bags or something like that
[47:41] from what they were telling me and I
[47:44] think we gave my baby
[47:45] a man of them on yesterday praise our
[47:49] Lord
[47:50] a man Lolita God so the people responded
[47:56] you know we had some signs also that
[47:58] we're holding up you know they're on the
[48:00] street and and they responded that came
[48:03] and there were some that we we said look
[48:06] we what we want to do is tonight at six
[48:10] o'clock we want you to bring your
[48:11] students back because we want to have
[48:12] prayer over them before they go in
[48:14] school and you know and I said what all
[48:17] these school shootings and everything we
[48:19] need to cover our children in prayer so
[48:21] something like that's right that's right
[48:23] we appreciate y'all doing that and I'm
[48:25] gonna say roughly 15 kids came back last
[48:31] night a prayer and you know and you know
[48:38] some of the Saints was running a little
[48:40] late we wanted him to get into the
[48:41] service you know but some of the sames
[48:44] was running a little late so brother
[48:45] smiles say look I don't want to kind of
[48:46] hold them here and you know keep them
[48:48] hostage so they say what I want to do is
[48:50] just go ahead and pray over them and
[48:51] then we'll start the service we'll
[48:53] invite them to it you don't invite them
[48:54] to search they want to stay they can but
[48:56] we want at least at least pray for them
[48:58] so we did that before service we read a
[49:00] script over and prayed over them knowing
[49:03] them with oil and you know and and and
[49:06] just trying to be a light in that
[49:07] community all right so I think that this
[49:10] gonna be something that we will you know
[49:12] we will continue to do and and serving
[49:14] this appreciate sister Tina for our
[49:16] efforts now amen

[49:28] have different annoying things each one
[49:30] of you have a have something that God
[49:32] has called you to do for the kingdom
[49:34] right and so when you find what your
[49:37] anointing is other people need to kind
[49:39] of get behind you to help help you amen
[49:43] to get things done so here's what I'm
[49:45] gonna ask cuz we're gonna do this again

[55:21] I'm born again see that's not all
[55:24] everything that y'all look at it as a
[55:26] medley but to him that was a testimony
[55:33] brother Troy wants you to sing
[55:35] especially I got one for ya what the
[55:38] devil he is
[55:45] the Lord the Lord has done a mighty work
[55:49] and you know and ever since God's done
[55:51] the work the devil just been attacking
[55:53] left and right with this and with that
[55:56] but I'm here today to announce so that
[55:58] they'll you still alive see what he's
[56:17] celebrating the big one-five-zero happy
[56:22] birthday to brother Troy hey man 5:01 of
[56:30] the devil thought he was going like a
[56:31] mop until you got here but the devil
[56:34] failed and we're so happy a man just
[56:40] just to be a part of the journey
[56:42] a man aware where the Lord has brought
[56:45] him and you know as brothers we talking
[56:47] and we realized you know man we used to
[56:50] be the young people we used to be and
[56:56] can't mercy God sometimes we try to act
[57:01] like we still there but you know our
[57:04] responsibilities change and we have a we
[57:07] have a focus now a man to to pour into
[57:11] the next generation
[57:13] amen you know because you know the Lord
[57:16] promises threescore and ten and if God
[57:20] if God was not gracious to us and he you
[57:24] know when we get past you know
[57:26] threescore and ten that's God's grace
[57:27] that's giving you that right but if you
[57:31] if you know God kept his word at
[57:33] threescore and ten like he did without
[57:35] dad he'd let him get one year past that
[57:37] pretty much sin Demi you know we called
[57:39] him home that gives us about twenty
[57:41] years about twenty years and we got to
[57:44] give God all we got in these twenty
[57:45] years and and and one of the things
[57:49] that's been in my heart and you know
[57:50] what we've been praying for and the
[57:52] brothers prayer meet and we're asking
[57:53] God you know I some of us in school or
[57:57] college and things that made some we try
[57:59] to get to this sermon here shortly but
[58:01] we're in school or college and you know
[58:03] we got our next generation of doctors
[58:05] next generation of nurses our next
[58:08] generation of IT professionals and then
[58:11] our next generation of carpenters our
[58:13] next generation of electricians a man
[58:16] but where's the next generation of
[58:17] Deacons
[58:18] where is the next generation of
[58:20] preachers where's the next generation of
[58:22] song leaders where is the next
[58:26] generation and and that's that's what
[58:28] we're that's what we want to see not
[58:30] just people tap it into their earthly
[58:31] vision right and it's okay to have an
[58:35] earthly vision because without a vision
[58:36] you'll perish so I'm not speaking
[58:38] against that but but you got to you got
[58:40] to realize that you are here for much
[58:42] greater than you
[58:43] profession God got you here for
[58:46] something much greater than that and
[58:48] sometimes the devil will anoint you and
[58:50] put you in certain areas where you can't
[58:52] get to what God got you here for amen
[58:55] right so so this is why you know our
[58:57] prayers been Lauri's this up right raise
[59:00] this up I mean you know who I'm gonna
[59:03] get this mic to if I only got 20 years
[59:06] if if who do I give it to who who can
[59:11] the church have confidence in so yeah I
[59:19] mean this is you know we're not when I
[59:21] come up you know we were faithful in the
[59:25] early ages right we were faithful people
[59:27] people knew that we were committed to
[59:29] God right and when they saw that
[59:32] commitment was very easy right for them
[59:35] to you know just kind of hear you know
[59:36] what I've seen the hand of God just on
[59:38] this on this brother for years so you
[59:40] know I can I can flow with that right
[59:42] but but when you got up and down in and
[59:45] out shifting sands right what what the
[59:50] next generation gonna look like huh Oh
[59:54] glory
[59:56] all right so so that this is this is why
[59:59] we praying for it I'm not just going to
[1:00:00] talk about I'm gonna start praying about
[1:00:01] it and we want to see that next
[1:00:04] generation rise you know David had a
[1:00:07] chance to see the next king before he
[1:00:09] gave the kingship over Moses had a had a
[1:00:15] chance to work with the next leader
[1:00:18] before he actually gave the the
[1:00:21] leadership baton over Joshua raised up
[1:00:24] in the church right so so so so you know
[1:00:31] we're looking for this and and and you
[1:00:34] know you got to get yourself in position
[1:00:35] where you can be qualified to do some
[1:00:39] things for the Lord never mess your life
[1:00:42] up and you can't do nothing y'all y'all
[1:00:45] me you know just just just stick around
[1:00:47] we got ours while I was in Washington DC
[1:00:53] I was riding with this brother he was
[1:00:55] telling this thing that they do he
[1:00:57] the pastor gave him this responsibility
[1:00:58] and he's one of the ministers in the
[1:01:01] church a young minister but he said the
[1:01:04] pastor gave me responsibility where he
[1:01:06] has to work with some of the young young
[1:01:10] people to help them get jobs so like if
[1:01:13] they if they ain't doing nothing with
[1:01:15] their life he meets with them one on one
[1:01:17] to find out what they next step is so
[1:01:21] you're not working right now okay that's
[1:01:23] fine that's right but you're gonna get a
[1:01:24] job right where you want to work at well
[1:01:27] I what do you want to do with your life
[1:01:29] and that brother works with them and
[1:01:31] today actually get to where they need to
[1:01:33] go
[1:01:34] I say that's good idea so you know I
[1:01:38] came back and I shared with brother
[1:01:39] Quentin and brother Troy and they say
[1:01:41] okay we'll take that burden no and
[1:01:43] they're gonna be working with the young
[1:01:45] brothers that might need a little
[1:01:46] guidance they gonna spend time with you
[1:01:50] the first thing they want is your resume
[1:01:54] all right but they're gonna be spending
[1:01:56] time with the brothers now I got I got
[1:01:59] my brothers but I'm gonna need somebody
[1:02:00] to kind of step up and want to do that
[1:02:02] with the sisters a man cuz I don't want
[1:02:05] young sisters going to these brothers
[1:02:07] y'all got it right y'all understand me I
[1:02:09] want the sisters to go to the sisters
[1:02:11] and their brothers are go to the
[1:02:12] brothers how are you but we don't we
[1:02:15] don't invest and pour into our young
[1:02:17] people amen
[1:02:19] so they can be ready for the next to
[1:02:21] carry the next wave hallelujah glory you
[1:02:28] get to a certain age you all might not
[1:02:31] realize it but it's sort of at a certain
[1:02:33] age you get to your early thirties late
[1:02:36] 20s early 30s before you go in the 40
[1:02:38] that that's the backbone of the church
[1:02:41] that group right there is the backbone
[1:02:44] amen
[1:02:45] so you want as many people in that that
[1:02:47] they should be settled in they mind they
[1:02:50] should be settled in their jobs right
[1:02:53] that's that that group should be help
[1:02:55] able to help carry to work on the Lord
[1:02:56] because the older generation out there
[1:02:58] they're getting to retirement age fixed
[1:03:01] income things of that nature I'm just
[1:03:02] talking
[1:03:04] fixed income and they might not be able
[1:03:06] to do all the things that you can do God
[1:03:08] call you because you strong alright and
[1:03:12] they called all because of the wisdom
[1:03:14] and when you got to church with the old
[1:03:16] and the young working together you got
[1:03:18] something good if you got a church is
[1:03:20] just full of young people now y'all hear
[1:03:26] me hear me well if you get into a church
[1:03:28] and it's just full of young people
[1:03:30] that's a rebellious Church and if you
[1:03:34] read your Bible every time you saw a
[1:03:38] rebellious King rise his kingdom did not
[1:03:41] last rebellion is as the sin of all
[1:03:48] right so when you're looking for a
[1:03:50] church you want to see the you want to
[1:03:52] see that the older generation middle
[1:03:54] aged young people and some babies coming
[1:03:58] up in it you want to see the whole
[1:04:00] package alright praise the Lord that
[1:04:03] lets you know that thing okay this is
[1:04:04] probably a good good you know a good
[1:04:06] place to be but uh but so you know we're
[1:04:09] going to be working a man with the the
[1:04:11] younger Amen brothers just trying to
[1:04:13] help
[1:04:13] you know steer them in the right
[1:04:14] direction sometimes this is a very
[1:04:17] critical phase in life because you can
[1:04:19] make some terrible decisions that will
[1:04:21] that will mess up your life right so so
[1:04:25] the GAR gets put some people around you
[1:04:27] to help you in same thing with the
[1:04:28] sisters you got you got some sisters in
[1:04:30] here but I'm just mentioned this and
[1:04:32] then I see who the Lord deals with a man
[1:04:35] and if the Lord deal with you then we'll
[1:04:37] talk praise the Lord
[1:04:39] because I want to know what you're doing
[1:04:40] oh oh I just feel lead to talks not you

[1:05:00] pastor against a man but I got I got a
[1:05:04] small window in front of me and and I

[1:05:11] he got around the same age he said I

[1:05:15] bit more when
[1:05:17] I was younger I wish I would have got
[1:05:18] started a little a little bit a little
[1:05:20] bit a little bit earlier right you get

[1:11:57] coming get out get out what are they
[1:12:00] doing you know so you know we finally
[1:12:03] get to the point where we finally start
[1:12:05] being obedient right and we're leaving
[1:12:07] and as we're leaving I said not hold on
[1:12:08] before we leave this property where are
[1:12:12] the graduates those are where the
[1:12:14] graduates they say they they write in

[1:12:48] been a threat that somebody's going to
[1:12:50] shoot in the graduation all right
[1:12:53] and someone's going to shoot now here's
[1:12:55] the sad parts that we live in a society
[1:12:58] where we can't even attend graduations
[1:13:02] when we live in a society where
[1:13:05] anytime we go out in public we need to
[1:13:09] be prayed up right amen we live in a
[1:13:12] society where I mean they would almost
[1:13:16] want you just living in a in a state of
[1:13:19] fear all the time right but but but here
[1:13:22] here's my encouragement to the body of
[1:13:26] Christ God has not given us the spirit
[1:13:31] of fear right so so so so even when we
[1:13:35] go to school we got to be prayed up
[1:13:37] right I mean you don't I mean right you
[1:13:40] know we thought Columbine was out a man
[1:13:42] and way out in Colorado somewhere things
[1:13:46] like that don't happen in Florida
[1:13:48] - last year parkland right so so so it
[1:13:52] doesn't matter where we send our kids we
[1:13:55] need to make sure that my children are
[1:13:57] clever all the Meuse something that can
[1:14:00] keep him holy they made that our
[1:14:04] children need to be covered underneath
[1:14:06] the blood of the Lord Jesus glory to God
[1:14:09] hey that's so so so so you know when I
[1:14:11] realized it enough that I just kind of
[1:14:14] feel the reason they can do anything cuz
[1:14:16] the proud of Jesus Christ was in that
[1:14:18] place not that simple - right amen
[1:14:22] hallelujah I'm crazy enough to believe
[1:14:26] God's promises now let's go put myself
[1:14:31] in harm's way
[1:14:33] amen but I know if I found myself in
[1:14:35] some weights amen and I got a right to
[1:14:39] be there
[1:14:40] then I'm expecting the bond devil Satan
[1:14:44] I'd punch you in the name of Jesus a
[1:14:49] Mingo shoot nothing round here a
[1:14:52] thousand may fall of us

[1:15:19] gotta walk out here God gonna protect me
[1:15:25] [Music]

[1:15:51] [Music]
[1:16:06] like this I'm not gonna live like this
[1:16:09] you know when I watched even how they
[1:16:11] handled us and pushed us out now okay
[1:16:13] you say there's a shooter but you know
[1:16:16] you you just pushed us out in the open
[1:16:19] and all of us just became targets you
[1:16:23] could have contained them if you just
[1:16:25] put a perimeter around the auditorium
[1:16:28] whistle police and it's the police oh
[1:16:30] you want a containment but you need all
[1:16:32] of us sign and put us in harm's way it
[1:16:36] goes to show that that mankind is not
[1:16:41] smart enough to fight these demons if
[1:16:46] they're not smart enough they can't come
[1:16:48] up with a plan that's good enough to
[1:16:50] actually overcome these demons you're
[1:16:53] gonna need something else to overcome
[1:16:54] these Devils and I want to tell y'all
[1:16:56] something
[1:16:57] amen you're gonna need the Holy Ghost
[1:17:00] amen you're gonna need the Holy Ghost
[1:17:02] young people they especially you that
[1:17:05] are age that know the difference from
[1:17:07] right and wrong now your parents prayers
[1:17:09] don't go so far but it can only go so
[1:17:11] far you gonna have to carry the rest of
[1:17:14] the way now you put yourself in harm's
[1:17:18] way hanging with the wrong people
[1:17:19] doing the wrong thing that's your
[1:17:22] thought and if you ain't got no
[1:17:24] scripture say no that's why God keep you
[1:17:27] in a holy cow the Holy Ghost appeal no I
[1:17:32] want to read something to you
[1:17:34] hey man because the Bible say something
[1:17:39] and psalm 34:7 the Bible says that angel
[1:17:42] of the lord encamps them that fear him
[1:17:47] and delivered them and psalm 34:7 the
[1:17:51] angel of the Lord and camped with a
[1:17:53] round about them that fear him and
[1:17:56] delivers them I love this I love this
[1:17:59] the angel of Lord and campus round about
[1:18:03] them that fear him and delivers them now
[1:18:08] now now now if we just look at that now
[1:18:10] read the quote for you a little bit just
[1:18:12] just look at the word the angel or only
[1:18:14] in camps around certain people
[1:18:16] [Music]
[1:18:18] and brother branham said an angel Lord
[1:18:20] does not a camp around sinners the age
[1:18:24] of the Lord and carefully round about
[1:18:26] them that fear him those that are
[1:18:32] serving him that angel protects them
[1:18:36] thereby better do not serving God you
[1:18:39] can't apply the scripture they made you
[1:18:43] become a target for the enemy I want
[1:18:48] just be honest with you the devil I
[1:18:51] ain't trying to get those that are
[1:18:52] already on his side they Palmas looking
[1:18:56] for you and if he can destroy you the
[1:18:59] promise they come this deal kill and
[1:19:01] destroy and if he can destroy you people
[1:19:04] I get help or something huh
[1:19:09] see so look at this and questions and
[1:19:12] answers amen part for the Prophet makes
[1:19:15] this statement he says explain about
[1:19:19] each person's angel who advised with
[1:19:22] them from birth now if you notice now
[1:19:25] this is pretty deep just what the
[1:19:26] problem say this is pretty deep
[1:19:28] Sigma I just picked it up he says now
[1:19:31] part of us wrote in tight and the other
[1:19:33] one is with the pizza up in so now there
[1:19:36] is an angel but this angel the Lord that
[1:19:39] are careful about those that fear him
[1:19:41] that fears him see now it isn't promised
[1:19:44] that sinners has angels it's only the
[1:19:50] redeemed has angels so did you know that
[1:19:54] the angels of the Lord that kept about
[1:19:56] those that fear him now angels are
[1:20:00] messengers I want you to notice it's so
[1:20:03] perfect
[1:20:04] it'll prove predestination to you see
[1:20:06] and notice not a title our Jesus have
[1:20:08] sent mine angel right this is what we're
[1:20:11] talking about before you actually go
[1:20:13] into these a man situations that could
[1:20:17] turn very my it could be a nightmare
[1:20:20] before you know it right before you go
[1:20:23] to the I want to encourage it I Jesus
[1:20:25] have already sent mine angel hallelujah
[1:20:29] but that angels only go with those that
[1:20:31] are routine and then if you are seven
[1:20:34] you cannot apply this so my advice to
[1:20:38] you is get saved
[1:20:40] don't leave Church not knowing that your
[1:20:43] heart is not right with God hallelujah
[1:20:47] amen let's go a little further
[1:20:49] Oh hallelujah let's go to the Queen of
[1:20:53] Sheba
[1:20:53] a man a man look at this look at this I
[1:20:56] got a couple things I need to read it
[1:20:59] says notice this generation wicked
[1:21:02] adulterous will seek after son and they
[1:21:05] will get it he says what God has found
[1:21:08] the sign of the resurrection he is not
[1:21:11] dead but he's alive how our religion is
[1:21:15] not a history it's a living fact it's a
[1:21:19] living God it's a living experience as
[1:21:21] it was in the days of Jonah now as he
[1:21:25] went along he give another expression he
[1:21:27] said and as it was in the days of
[1:21:29] Solomon back in the days of Solomon when
[1:21:32] God sends a gift to the earth if the
[1:21:35] people receive it it becomes a golden
[1:21:38] age to them if they reject it it becomes
[1:21:42] a chaos to them and then look what
[1:21:45] happened when Jesus was God's message to
[1:21:48] the people and they rejected it look
[1:21:50] what happened to the people that
[1:21:52] rejected it in the days of Solomon
[1:21:54] sermons rain any Minister knows that was
[1:21:57] a golden age for Israel the greatest age
[1:21:59] they built the temple they had no worlds
[1:22:02] to mount anything and they had a power
[1:22:04] of God among them I've that gift was so
[1:22:07] great to all the nations around about
[1:22:10] fear there now it makes this statement
[1:22:12] here says listen brother what we need
[1:22:16] today we don't need atomic shelters he
[1:22:20] says what we need is the baptism of the
[1:22:22] holy spirit see ain't no place to run
[1:22:23] the only place to run is in Christ the
[1:22:27] Bible say the name of the Lord is a
[1:22:28] strong tower and the righteous run into
[1:22:31] it and
[1:22:32] safe Alleluia I told y'all that
[1:22:35] testimonial last week I believe was how
[1:22:37] you know this plane is going it actually
[1:22:41] wasn't even lifting they was going down
[1:22:43] the runway there in Mexico and and as
[1:22:45] their blameless was headed down I guess
[1:22:47] they didn't announce to the people that
[1:22:49] there was a problem but as that thing
[1:22:51] was kind of coming to give her at his
[1:22:52] crash you heard a man I don't know who
[1:22:55] he was I don't know if he was the pilot
[1:22:57] I don't know who he was
[1:22:58] hallelujah but the man knew he could
[1:23:01] call on Jesus and then man say in the
[1:23:05] name of Jesus and I mean it's only about
[1:23:09] five seconds oh my god if your life was
[1:23:13] coming to an idea what would be the last
[1:23:16] he was becoming in your mouth Peter's
[1:23:20] plane as pastor in the name of Jesus and
[1:23:24] it's a since I'm in Mexico I might as
[1:23:29] well stay away can he understand me and
[1:23:31] then this language - it ain't no big
[1:23:33] thing soups and all I heard is that
[1:23:41] everybody on the plane was speared huh I
[1:23:44] don't know if there were other believers
[1:23:47] on the plane he might have been the only
[1:23:49] believer but because he was there huh
[1:23:54] because he was there everybody else was
[1:23:59] protected and that's the way you know
[1:24:01] when I'm gonna screw because I'm here
[1:24:03] oh this is this is and then that don't
[1:24:49] happen to me and like God unless God
[1:24:51] allow it I live it in no fear I'm not

[1:25:38] the baptism of the Holy Spirit you know
[1:25:40] as I was going through the whole
[1:25:41] exercise on Tuesday I realized there was
[1:25:44] a lot of ways that people could have
[1:25:46] just did whatever they want to do to us
[1:25:47] first of all you got us out here as what
[1:25:50] week when I call sitting ducks you got

[1:26:12] because it's going the Internet somebody
[1:26:14] think that I'm some type of
[1:26:16] that ain't me and what I'm trying to
[1:26:19] tell you is that you know all our
[1:26:21] planning all our human reasoning a man
[1:26:25] is not enough to fight Devils we need to
[1:26:29] get back to the Holy Ghost let me tell
[1:26:32] you if the if the if the the shooter had
[1:26:35] the hole they go see would have a gun a
[1:26:40] man right so we need to get people in
[1:26:43] church let them get the Holy Ghost
[1:26:45] praise God
[1:26:46] that'll change that's God's nature
[1:26:48] dwelling inside of a man that changes
[1:26:51] everything changes his desires changed
[1:26:54] everything about him oh my god I got
[1:26:56] something else to read here let me
[1:26:57] he says they listen brother what we need
[1:26:59] that we don't need atomic shelters what
[1:27:01] we need is the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:02] Spirit nations will fear if the whole
[1:27:07] United States that claims to be a
[1:27:09] Christian will fall under the power of
[1:27:11] God there will be so many things happen
[1:27:14] to here so every nation will be afraid
[1:27:17] to turn an atomic bomb loose right he is
[1:27:22] our refuge he is our strip I still got
[1:27:24] buckler how are all in all I mean I got
[1:27:28] another one here that I want to read
[1:27:30] amen this is out of the message God
[1:27:32] commissioning a man Moses Oh blessed be
[1:27:38] the name of the Lord we got to know who
[1:27:39] we are
[1:27:40] praise God a man a man a man it shall
[1:27:44] not come nigh thy dwelling it shall not
[1:27:47] a man listen he says yes brother
[1:27:50] hallelujah you can go and I know a lot
[1:27:52] of them guys that's absolutely received
[1:27:54] Holy Ghost backyard the number number of
[1:27:56] men on the field of day but it's a shame
[1:27:58] to confess it hallelujah but I'm one
[1:28:01] Baptist that received the baptism Holy
[1:28:03] Ghost and belen and believe it with all
[1:28:06] my heart and teach it hallelujah I will
[1:28:08] stay true to the old word yes sir and
[1:28:10] God's confirmed it through the entire
[1:28:12] world when standing there in Durban
[1:28:15] Africa I said to these great bunch of
[1:28:17] Baptist ministers were standing there
[1:28:18] having a supper Jewish Hospital they had
[1:28:21] a staff of the doctors down there talkin
[1:28:23] divine healing some great miracles
[1:28:25] happened
[1:28:25] around Louisville and said what about
[1:28:27] this now look at this look at this and
[1:28:30] one of the doctor said well I tell you I
[1:28:32] found this that the greatest power in
[1:28:35] the world is not the atomic bomb but a
[1:28:40] believer in contact with this makeup
[1:28:44] that's what the doctor said the greatest
[1:28:47] power is not an atomic bomb the greatest
[1:28:50] power is not so merit of a cake but the
[1:28:54] greatest power is a believer in contact
[1:28:57] with his makeup Oh hallelujah
[1:29:02] you got to know that you can call on the
[1:29:04] name of Jesus you got to know that when
[1:29:06] you call something gonna happen the
[1:29:11] greatest power in the world not the
[1:29:14] atomic bomb but a believer in contact
[1:29:17] with his maker it changes the whole
[1:29:19] attitude changes his mental it changes
[1:29:23] his habit it changes his body it changes
[1:29:28] his nature everything see this when a
[1:29:31] person comes in contact with God
[1:29:33] things change and this is why is
[1:29:35] important for us to kind of stress the
[1:29:37] importance of having the Holy Ghost
[1:29:39] there was one statement brother Graham
[1:29:40] says absolutely essential necessary
[1:29:42] compulsory that we receive the Holy
[1:29:45] Ghost now right don't play games with
[1:29:47] this your only protection it's found
[1:29:49] underneath the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:29:51] back in the days of Moses when the Death
[1:29:53] Angel is passing through the land what
[1:29:56] Moses gave them instructure's say look
[1:29:58] you have to put blood on the top of your
[1:30:00] door and on the stock clothes on the top
[1:30:02] of the door and on the side post you say
[1:30:03] every house that has that blood apply
[1:30:05] then the death angel will pass over and
[1:30:08] not strike that firstborn son dead right
[1:30:11] but if you did not have the blood apply
[1:30:14] you were a open target for the death
[1:30:16] death angel brother branham told us that
[1:30:20] that that blood applied a man in the
[1:30:21] evening time it was representative of
[1:30:24] the Holy Ghost being applied to our
[1:30:26] lives I think we receiving the back to
[1:30:29] the Holy Ghost without it we are an open
[1:30:32] target to the devil I want to stress
[1:30:37] I want to stress it you'll see you know
[1:30:41] we can preach these things but if you
[1:30:42] ain't really where you need to be a man
[1:30:45] you might be walking into some trouble
[1:30:47] but but but but but but if you serving
[1:30:51] God the way that you're supposed to
[1:30:53] serve them right not not the not you
[1:30:55] know hallelujah amen you know you you're
[1:30:58] not a Christian because your mama's a
[1:31:00] Christian your dad is a Christian right
[1:31:03] you're Christian because you actually
[1:31:04] you but you decided to walk the same
[1:31:06] walk that they did right the angel Lord
[1:31:09] only encamps around those that fear him
[1:31:11] and deliver them all right let's go on a
[1:31:15] little further here I Jesus have sent my
[1:31:19] angel one more quote here I want to read
[1:31:21] a man out of expectation they don't want
[1:31:25] to pick up a couple scriptures what man
[1:31:29] calls great God calls foolish God calls
[1:31:33] great and what man calls foolish God
[1:31:36] calls great so what we've got to do is
[1:31:39] get back into the program of God and
[1:31:41] find out after all what God wants us to
[1:31:43] do and the only way I know to do it is
[1:31:46] prayer prayer is the key that's the
[1:31:50] answer prayer changes things prayer is
[1:31:56] the most powerful weapon that was ever
[1:31:59] put in the control of human beings right
[1:32:02] there's no atomic bomb or no hydrogen
[1:32:06] bomb as powerful as prayer where we'll
[1:32:11] change the mind of God okay and we're
[1:32:14] gonna go into that little further if
[1:32:15] prayer can changed the mind of God
[1:32:18] prayer can show stop the devil in his
[1:32:20] tracks
[1:32:24] hallelujah but if you live in a life
[1:32:26] where you don't know God go hear your
[1:32:28] prayer right then it's hard to pray but
[1:32:31] when you know that he's pleased with the
[1:32:33] life that you live it it's easier to say
[1:32:36] oh my god them two words a color on the
[1:32:39] scene just like Oh hallelujah Church I'm
[1:32:46] say and I don't take much I'm telling
[1:32:48] stings like this
[1:32:52] i'ma just share this testimony I heard
[1:32:54] and I won't call it a brother's name but
[1:32:56] I shared a testimony and one of the
[1:32:59] brothers was it was just I the Lord had
[1:33:03] a dream and in the dream he saw himself
[1:33:05] in the casket and it saw his son looking
[1:33:08] over at his body and and when they woke
[1:33:14] up he just kind of felt this fear said
[1:33:16] now you need to pray over that I pray
[1:33:18] against them but I rebuked that in the

[1:33:23] that in the name of Jesus not know long
[1:33:25] to our prayer just I rebuke it in the
[1:33:27] name of Jesus

[1:33:34] the car and I was sitting that car
[1:33:37] dropped and start moving why he was
[1:33:40] underneath it and it was get Marie to
[1:33:43] roll right over the top nobody was there
[1:33:44] he got from underneath it and he saw the
[1:33:47] cars roll right on down to the street
[1:33:49] now what it was God was showing him
[1:33:51] ahead of time and had he not repented
[1:33:57] had he not repented then he would have
[1:34:00] fulfilled but his prayer this prayer
[1:34:06] changed it right and see we got to get
[1:34:10] to a spot hallelujah well we have so

[1:34:49] like then he was praying and in a vision
[1:34:51] he saw chip going down and he prayed and
[1:34:54] he didn't know where the ship was he
[1:34:56] just prayed he just prayed and and when
[1:34:59] he prayed he got news later on that this
[1:35:02] ship was on his way overseas somewhere
[1:35:04] and it was going down but somehow the
[1:35:06] sister ship was rescued and all of the
[1:35:07] passengers were safe one person's prayer
[1:35:09] changed the outcome let's see wait you
[1:35:13] know i'ma just be honest I don't think
[1:35:15] we spiritual enough I don't think we
[1:35:19] spiritual enough where God can even
[1:35:21] speak to us and if there was ever a time
[1:35:23] where people needed to hear from God
[1:35:29] that time is right now that time is
[1:35:33] right now we need them know that we
[1:35:35] don't heard from God hallelujah your
[1:35:39] prayer changes things in this Court I
[1:35:41] won't read the rest of it but I just
[1:35:42] tell you is that the Prophet I mean the
[1:35:45] King Hezekiah was the prophet Isaiah
[1:35:48] went to him and told him I says look
[1:35:50] you're gonna die just get your house in
[1:35:52] order you don't die and the Prophet
[1:35:54] turned I mean the King turned his face
[1:35:56] to the wall and they say he said Lord
[1:35:58] I'm not ready to die and he and the good
[1:36:01] thing about the king is that he was able
[1:36:02] to tell God what he'd already done oh
[1:36:06] don't you don't don't get this twisted
[1:36:08] not what he was gonna do and that's the
[1:36:11] way it slaughter us pray Lord if you
[1:36:13] spare me then I do this know why don't
[1:36:15] you tell god what you already done deal
[1:36:17] see here he is a lord I did this and
[1:36:21] Lord I did that
[1:36:22] I did this God told the Prophet turn
[1:36:24] around and go right back mm see I heard
[1:36:26] your prayer and I'm giving you 15 more
[1:36:28] years prayer changed the mind of God if
[1:36:33] prayer could change the mind of God
[1:36:35] prayer would show stop the devil in his
[1:36:37] tracks
[1:36:38] you better know the weapon that you got
[1:36:41] hallelujah the God that you serve is a
[1:36:45] big God hallelujah all right so as we I
[1:36:52] just wanted to kind of bring this there
[1:36:55] are different situations that have come
[1:36:56] up in scripture oftentimes it might have
[1:37:00] been Amen in the hour of distress a man
[1:37:03] a very critical point where we saw the
[1:37:06] angel the Lord will show up a man an
[1:37:08] angel or so the Bible say I Jesus have
[1:37:11] sent mine angel so before before we even
[1:37:13] go into these situations we have another
[1:37:14] angel Lord is already there already
[1:37:16] there waiting to protect us waiting to
[1:37:18] shield us waiting to you know do
[1:37:20] whatever it takes the angel Lord is
[1:37:21] already there amen before you go in
[1:37:23] glory
[1:37:24] so so a lot so I'm going to go through
[1:37:26] some scriptures here because we see a
[1:37:28] man in Scripture that there are a number
[1:37:29] times in the our distress that God
[1:37:31] showed up and if God showed up in the
[1:37:34] Bible and he's the same yesterday today
[1:37:36] and forever then we ought to expect that
[1:37:39] same God to show up today hallelujah
[1:37:42] hallelujah amen this time it wasn't an
[1:37:46] hour of distress in this particular
[1:37:48] situation it was just a critical
[1:37:50] decision had to be made and and this was
[1:37:53] a story of Eliezer with with Abraham and
[1:37:56] when and when Eliezer got the
[1:37:58] instruction for Abraham go back to my
[1:38:00] people and find my my son a wife from
[1:38:05] amongst my people I don't want him to
[1:38:07] get married to these ladies down here I
[1:38:08] won't go back home and finally find them
[1:38:11] away well he gave him and said look now
[1:38:13] and he's being an accident I what if I
[1:38:15] can't find her what a word of this and
[1:38:17] what if that and then Abraham told them
[1:38:20] something in in Genesis 24 and 7 he made
[1:38:23] a statement here to him glory to God and
[1:38:26] I'm gonna read this quote on this one he
[1:38:28] says Eliezer a man the Bible say Elian
[1:38:31] concerned that the woman would not come
[1:38:33] back with him Abraham said the Lord
[1:38:36] shall send His angel before thee
[1:38:39] so before Eliezer showed up to where
[1:38:42] Rebecca was the angel God was already
[1:38:45] there
[1:38:46] hallelujah say the Lord shall send this
[1:38:48] angel before thee and thou shalt take a
[1:38:51] light unto my son from this now there's
[1:38:55] a statement Amen let me see if I got it
[1:38:57] here I hope I still you know I might I
[1:39:00] might have misplaced it oh my god I
[1:39:04] might have to just quote it off off of
[1:39:06] my off memory if y'all don't mind but
[1:39:09] what brother Branham says that's what
[1:39:11] God does is that he sends his angel
[1:39:14] hallelujah with His Messenger so when
[1:39:19] ELISA did this he said that god dammit
[1:39:21] because the Lord don't send this angel
[1:39:23] before you get there and he's got a
[1:39:25] little bit of worthless thing out and we
[1:39:28] know the end of the story because when
[1:39:29] he got there he played the way say let
[1:39:32] the woman that come and just and not
[1:39:34] just give me water but give my camera's
[1:39:36] water let her be the one Rebekah walk
[1:39:38] laughter and did exactly what he prayed
[1:39:41] about because God has sent his angel
[1:39:46] before ELISA captor the angel is there
[1:39:50] hallelujah and not only was the angel
[1:39:54] there but God sent the angel with the
[1:39:56] messenger and we've seen that God has
[1:40:02] sent his angel with his messenger when
[1:40:04] you see that pillar of fire on top of
[1:40:05] brother branham's head God sent the
[1:40:07] angel with the messenger Oh hallelujah
[1:40:12] now can I read a scripture for you can I
[1:40:16] read a scripture for you this is a let
[1:40:20] me just find it real quick because uh
[1:40:23] hallelujah you want protection you want
[1:40:25] covering Exodus 23 God sends the angel
[1:40:30] with the messenger Exodus 23 hallelujah
[1:40:36] now though some of y'all might be afraid
[1:40:39] to do this but we did it when we was in
[1:40:40] school

[1:45:39] for the for the Bride of Christ now any
[1:45:43] time like I say the hour of distress God
[1:45:45] does this if you go back and look at
[1:45:48] scripture a man with the Hebrew boys
[1:45:50] when they were cast into the fiery
[1:45:52] furnace when they were throwing in the
[1:45:56] King was you know so it so offended that
[1:45:58] they would not bow down and worship this
[1:46:01] God that he created and brother Branham
[1:46:03] said was a God about it was a holy man
[1:46:05] that Nebuchadnezzar had created and and
[1:46:07] he wanted them to bow down and the holy
[1:46:09] man was an image of Daniel and he wanted
[1:46:11] the Hebrew boys to bow down and worship
[1:46:13] there's any say they say if y'all don't
[1:46:15] we gonna heat the fire up seven times
[1:46:16] hotter than it ever was and we're gonna
[1:46:19] throw you in it's a king they said King
[1:46:21] look this is our our testimony we know
[1:46:23] that I God can deliver us but if he
[1:46:26] chooses not to let it be written in your
[1:46:29] books that we did not bow to your image
[1:46:33] hallelujah it's a royalty y'all fellas
[1:46:35] thank y'all something County strongest
[1:46:37] men in the kingdom threw him into the
[1:46:39] fire after heated up seven times honor
[1:46:40] and why are they in the fire that the
[1:46:43] strongmen were burned going into the
[1:46:45] fire the strongmen were burned going in
[1:46:47] but then he the King got up and he
[1:46:49] looked inside the fire saying I wait a
[1:46:51] minute I know I threw three men in but
[1:46:53] why is it that I see four and not only
[1:46:57] that say this fourth will look like the
[1:46:59] Son of God now I want y'all to read that
[1:47:01] because we all stop at that part that
[1:47:03] that was a summer guy and I believe it
[1:47:05] was the son of God but let's read the
[1:47:07] rest of that amen and Daniel Amen
[1:47:10] Chapter three hallelujah let's read the
[1:47:14] rest of that amen and dire distress
[1:47:18] school situations God likes to send his
[1:47:21] angel oh yes he does yes he does a man
[1:47:27] and if he did it here in the Bible days
[1:47:29] and I'm expecting him to do it a man
[1:47:31] today I would stop let's start here day
[1:47:35] three I want to read real quick here a
[1:47:38] man start at verse 20 a man here in
[1:47:42] Daniel three and it commanded the most
[1:47:44] mighty men that were in his moment and
[1:47:46] his arm and upon Shadrach Meshach and
[1:47:48] Abednego and to cast him into the fire
[1:47:49] burning fiery furnace then these men
[1:47:51] were bound in their coats their hoses
[1:47:53] and their hats and their other garments
[1:47:55] and were cast into the midst of the
[1:47:57] burning fiery furnace therefore because
[1:47:59] the king's commandment was urgent and
[1:48:00] the furnace exceeding hot the flame of
[1:48:02] fire slew those men that took up
[1:48:04] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and these
[1:48:07] three men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[1:48:08] fell down bound into the midst of the of
[1:48:10] the fire furnace of the burning fiery
[1:48:13] furnace then Nebuchadnezzar the king was
[1:48:16] astonished and rose up in haste and
[1:48:17] spake and said unto his counselors did
[1:48:19] not we cast three men bound into the
[1:48:22] midst of the fire they answered and said
[1:48:23] unto him to the king true o king he
[1:48:26] answered and said lo I see four men
[1:48:28] loose walking in the midst of the fire
[1:48:30] and they have no hurt hallelujah and the
[1:48:34] form of the fourth is like the Son of
[1:48:36] God then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the
[1:48:39] mouth of the burning fiery furnace and
[1:48:40] speakers as Shadrach Meshach and
[1:48:43] Abednego you servants of the Most High
[1:48:45] God come forth and come hither then
[1:48:48] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego King full
[1:48:50] of the midst of the fire look at it and
[1:48:53] the princes governors and captains and
[1:48:55] the Kings counsellors being gathered
[1:48:57] together saudis man upon whose bodies
[1:48:59] the fire had no power the fire had no
[1:49:03] power over them a man out of gun control
[1:49:06] laws may not have any control today but
[1:49:09] with a protection of the holy spirit we
[1:49:11] ain't got to worry about none of this
[1:49:12] listen he says the fire had no power nor
[1:49:16] was a hair of the head of their head
[1:49:18] since neither was their coach change nor
[1:49:21] the Seraphim
[1:49:23] I passed on them and verse 28 is Keith
[1:49:27] then Nebuchadnezzar spake and said
[1:49:29] blessed be the god of Shadrach Meshach
[1:49:30] and Abednego why who have sent his angel
[1:49:35] and delivered his servants that trusted
[1:49:40] in him God sent his angel at the time of
[1:49:43] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and I can
[1:49:46] go a little further God also sent an
[1:49:47] angel at the time of Daniel in the
[1:49:48] lion's den huh when Peter was in jail
[1:49:52] God sent an angel and deliverer Peter
[1:49:55] from jail God has always in the business
[1:49:58] of sending his angel to protect his
[1:50:01] people so we ain't got nothing to fear I
[1:50:04] Jesus have already sent mine angel I
[1:50:08] know we go into some trouble in times
[1:50:10] trouble trouble trouble trouble times we
[1:50:12] don't and you're you you I know if I had
[1:50:15] kids going I'd be just as concerned as
[1:50:17] any other parent in here but I want to
[1:50:20] tell you that you're covered under the
[1:50:22] blood of Jesus Christ and that blood
[1:50:25] that covers you protects you keeps you
[1:50:28] and it don't keep you up at night
[1:50:30] worrying hallelujah because the Bible
[1:50:35] say he gives his beloved sleep God don't
[1:50:38] want you up up at night worrying
[1:50:40] God wants to just trust him put him in
[1:50:42] God's care yeah set his angel can we go
[1:50:47] a little further oh yes Lord yes Lord
[1:50:51] yes Lord I told you how prayer is the
[1:50:54] most powerful weapon let me finish
[1:50:55] description I want to get over the ax 12
[1:50:58] it says blessed be the god of Shadrach
[1:51:00] Meshach and Abednego who have sent his
[1:51:02] angel delivered his service that trusted
[1:51:04] in him and have changed the king's word
[1:51:06] and yielded their bodies that they might
[1:51:08] not serve no worship any God except
[1:51:11] their own God all right all right all
[1:51:15] right if you pick up Daniel 6 you'll see
[1:51:18] it right there and Daniel 6 as well but
[1:51:20] we're not going to read that for the
[1:51:21] sake of time I want to go to acts 12 the
[1:51:24] most powerful weapon you got is prayer
[1:51:29] hallelujah
[1:51:32] believer come in contact with his maker
[1:51:35] that's more powerful than anything
[1:51:38] hallelujah
[1:51:40] look at this in acts 12 thank you Jesus
[1:51:44] says now about that time Herod the King
[1:51:47] stretched forth his hands to vex certain
[1:51:51] of the church and it killed James the
[1:51:54] brother of John with the sward and
[1:51:56] because he saw it pleased to Jews he
[1:51:59] proceeded further to take Peter also
[1:52:01] then were the days of unleavened bread
[1:52:03] and when he had apprehended him he put
[1:52:06] him in prison by his his his his purpose
[1:52:08] for putting him in prison is that I'm
[1:52:10] gonna kill Peter but see if it ain't
[1:52:12] time for you to go God don't make a way
[1:52:15] for you to get out of it watch this
[1:52:18] watch this
[1:52:19] right he said he say and now he says and
[1:52:22] when he had to put a prohibited him he
[1:52:23] put him in prison and delivered him to
[1:52:25] fourth quarter nians of soldiers to keep
[1:52:28] him intending after eat after Easter to
[1:52:31] bring him forth to the people Peter
[1:52:33] therefore was kept in prison Oh glory
[1:52:36] that prayer I love that when I will you
[1:52:42] see me you see that prayer that means
[1:52:44] something about the things but prayer
[1:52:47] the prayer was made without ceasing of
[1:52:51] the church unto God for him and then
[1:52:53] when Herod would have brought him forth
[1:52:55] that same night Peter was sleeping
[1:52:58] between two soldiers and then bound with
[1:53:01] two chains and the kuipers before the
[1:53:04] dark kept the prison and in their hole
[1:53:07] the angel of the Lord came up
[1:53:10] him hallelujah bypassed the people that
[1:53:14] he was connected to by chains by our
[1:53:17] past the people I was watching over the
[1:53:19] door the angel the Lord is not the
[1:53:22] sinners but they those troubles if you
[1:53:33] have to come and pick pocket the chains
[1:53:37] to get you out he'll do just that oh my
[1:53:43] god I've seen God protect me at times
[1:53:47] where that something big went off it in
[1:53:49] the school but the day that that
[1:53:51] something big went off in the school God
[1:53:54] had it where I was late that day God
[1:53:58] know how to protect you from the stuff
[1:54:01] can we go on listen it says and the Holy
[1:54:04] age of the Lord came upon him and a
[1:54:08] light shine in the prison and they spoke
[1:54:12] Peter on the side and raise them up
[1:54:14] saying arise up quickly in his chain
[1:54:16] spill off from his hands my god and the
[1:54:22] angel said unto Him gird thyself and
[1:54:24] bind on that sandals and so he did they
[1:54:28] said I am cast that garment about thee
[1:54:30] and follow me and they went out and
[1:54:32] followed him and whisked not that it was
[1:54:34] true what was done by the angel but
[1:54:37] thought he saw a vision when they were
[1:54:40] passing this is what happened in the
[1:54:42] book of Acts we ought to expect these
[1:54:43] same things because the church is a
[1:54:44] continuation of the book of Acts when
[1:54:49] they were past the first in the second
[1:54:50] war that came unto the iron gate that
[1:54:52] leadeth them to the city which opened to
[1:54:54] them on his own accord see this is why I
[1:54:57] always say when you walk into the
[1:54:59] grocery store somebody's department
[1:55:01] stores and they got the doors that just
[1:55:02] open up by themselves
[1:55:03] oh they got that from Scripture because
[1:55:06] the angel did that first
[1:55:11] but he want to open them so he can go
[1:55:13] shopping he opening this to set his this
[1:55:17] prisoner free just I don't care I close
[1:55:21] to this but in the nick of time God has
[1:55:22] a way of sparing you look at it look at
[1:55:29] it let's keep going say which open to
[1:55:31] them on others on court and they went
[1:55:33] out and passed on through one Street and
[1:55:35] forth with the angel departed from them
[1:55:38] I got you out and now you need to go
[1:55:40] ahead and take care the rest is now look
[1:55:41] at where Peter go Oh help me somebody
[1:55:45] God does set you free full of stuff what
[1:55:48] you doing going back into them
[1:55:49] situations again look at where Peter
[1:55:51] call he says and then and when Peter was
[1:55:55] come to himself well Jesus come and he
[1:56:00] said now I know of a surety that the
[1:56:02] Lord had sent his angel and then have to
[1:56:07] limit me out of the hand of hell and
[1:56:09] from all the expectation of the people
[1:56:11] of the Jews and when he had considered a
[1:56:15] thing he came to the house of Mary the
[1:56:18] mother of John whose surname was mark
[1:56:24] where many would gather and plant
[1:56:28] dominoes where many were gathered and
[1:56:33] playing uno huh no no no he knew where
[1:56:39] to go he went where many would gather
[1:56:41] and they were praying when Peter got
[1:56:45] free he went to the prayer meeting when
[1:56:49] you get free where you going
[1:56:57] hallelujah you know God never spared
[1:57:00] your life you ought to be the first one
[1:57:01] in church that on a Friday night I got a
[1:57:03] testimony brother Jack
[1:57:04] I have a testimony God been too good to
[1:57:08] me for me to sit down and I say now are

[1:57:12] mom it didn't happen to mama

[1:58:38] shelter from me they may end a strong
[1:58:42] tower from the enemy now earlier I read
[1:58:50] a man Isaiah 54 and we read verse 13 but

[2:01:58] I want to read Psalm 91 I want to read
[2:02:03] Psalm 91 I'm telling you this morning
[2:02:08] Jesus has already sent the angel for the
[2:02:12] believers sinners don't get angels but
[2:02:17] believers do and he's already sent his
[2:02:21] angel for your protection you don't have
[2:02:25] a thing to worry about God's got
[2:02:28] everything under control
[2:02:32] the Bible says he that dwelleth in the
[2:02:36] secret place of the Most High shall
[2:02:39] abide under the shadow of the Almighty
[2:02:41] I will say of the Lord he is my refuge
[2:02:47] not the parking garage not trying to
[2:02:51] hide behind a tree right he is my refuge
[2:02:55] and my fortress
[2:02:59] you see when when armies back in those
[2:03:01] days when they fought an Old Testament
[2:03:03] they try to build fortresses but they're
[2:03:06] trying to protect themselves from any
[2:03:07] advancing enemy right and they tried to
[2:03:10] make it strong glory to God
[2:03:12] but-but-but-but see we gotta understand
[2:03:14] that God is our fortress he and and say
[2:03:17] he is my refuge and my fortress my god
[2:03:19] in him will I trust surely he shall
[2:03:23] deliver thee from the snare of the
[2:03:25] Fowler and from the noisome pestilence
[2:03:27] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[2:03:29] and under his wings shalt thou trust his
[2:03:33] truth shall be thy shield and and
[2:03:39] buckler
[2:03:40] thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
[2:03:43] by night nor for the arrow that flieth
[2:03:46] by day nor for the pestilence that
[2:03:50] walketh in darkness nor for the
[2:03:52] destruction that wasteth at noonday a
[2:03:55] thousand shall fall at thy side and ten
[2:03:58] thousand at thy right hand but it shall
[2:04:02] not come nigh thee only with our eyes
[2:04:08] shalt thou behold and see the reward of
[2:04:10] the wicked because thou has made
[2:04:12] which is my refuge even the most high
[2:04:15] high habitation I'm reading this over
[2:04:19] this church there shall no evil befall
[2:04:26] thee neither shall any plague come nigh
[2:04:31] thy dwelling you want to know why for he
[2:04:35] shall give his angels charge over thee
[2:04:41] and you know why they there to keep you
[2:04:44] in all that ways that's it not part of
[2:04:51] all your way is gonna be kept they shall
[2:04:55] bear thee up in their hands lest thou
[2:04:59] dash thy foot against a stone
[2:05:02] thou shall tread upon the lion and adder
[2:05:04] the young lion and the dragon shalt thou
[2:05:07] trample under feet because he has set
[2:05:12] his love upon me therefore will I
[2:05:17] deliver him because you love God
[2:05:22] therefore will I deliver him I will set
[2:05:25] him on high because he have known my
[2:05:30] name he shall call upon me see when you
[2:05:35] when the name of the Lord is a strong
[2:05:36] tire so when you call where you called
[2:05:38] Jesus just that fact Jesus and if this
