pastor and brother smiley in prayer amen as they are out amen doing a work for the lord amen and keep them and is our prayer amen uh uh second corinthians the fourth chapter take our reading from second corinthians the fourth chapter will start at the third verse amen say amen when you got it second corinthians the fourth chapter and the third first i guess we got used to the screen i fear there's a problem with the screen uh with the uh tonight so we'll just have to follow along okay i guess we kind of got it amen amen second corinthians 4 chapter 3 verses but if the gospel be hid it behead to them that are lost in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake for god who commanded the light to shine out of the darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair we're persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed you may uh remember the lord out of the blessings of the reason's word you may be seated amen um i'd like to take a a short text tonight um and i'll call this sort of a roundabout way i want to talk about the tinder hand of jehovah amen the tender hand of jehovah amen and reading that scripture it just blesses me that uh uh he said we have a treasure amen in earth and vex and earth and vessels amen uh that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us maybe of god and not of us we are troubled on every side yet we're not distressed we're perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed amen if we can uh take a scripture reading we're going to go to daniel the fifth amen daniel the book of daniel the fifth chapter and uh i'm gonna pull a little something out of there to give us a man a platform of just thought it's kind of a roundabout way but you know how many been joined the bible studies amen just really every time just get so much out of it and man it just speaks to my heart and that's where this message was sort of birthed out of probably about three or four bible studies ago brother jack was just talking and he was talking about the tender hand of jehovah and it just stayed with me you know and i just thought maybe uh the lord gave me something to say on the tender hand of jehovah and there's always something to say about the tender hand of jehovah amen but i just thought i'd bring this little this little thought here uh daniel the fifth chapter bell shazad the king made a great feast to thousands of his lords and drank wine before thousands belches are while he tasted the wine commanded to bring the golden and silver silver vessels which his father nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in jerusalem that the king and his and his prince his wives and his concubines might drink therein then they brought the golden vessels and were taken out of the temple of the house of god which was at jerusalem and the king and the princes and his wives and his concubines drank them they drank the wine and praised the gods of silver brass iron and of wood and of stone in the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace and he saw a great part of the hand that rope then the king's countenance was changed and his countenance troubled him so the so that the joints of his loins were loose and his knees smote one against the other the king cried aloud bringing in the astrologers and the child demons and the soothsayers and the and the king spake and said to the wise men of babylon whosoever shall read this writing and show me the interpretation thereof shall be clothed and scarlet and have a chain about his neck and shall be the ruler a third shall be the third ruler in the kingdom and it came to pass the king's wise men uh could not read the writings noah made known to the king the interpretation of thereof uh the king of belgium saw greatly troubled and his countenance was changed in him and his lords were astonished now the queen by reason of the word of the of the king and the lords came into the banquet house and the queen spake and said oh uh to the king o king live forever let not that count thy thoughts troubled thee nor let thy countenance be changed there is a man in the kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods and in the day of thy father's light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of god's was found in him whom the king nebuchadnezzar thy father and the king saith thy father made master of the magicians astrologers and chaldeans and soothsayers for as much as an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding interpreting of dreams and showing of hard sentences and dissolving of doubts were found in the same daniel amen and daniel called and we'll show the interpretation when daniel brought in uh for the king and the and the king spake said unto daniel art thou daniel which are the children of the captivity of the judah whom the king my father brought uh out of uh jury and have even heard the the spirit of gods in him light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee now the wise men and astrologers brought in brought before me that they should read this writing make known unto me the interpretation amen i want to just read down to kind of avoid a whole lot of reading amen um daniel answered and said before the king let thy gift uh be thyself and to rewards um i would read the writing unto the king and make known unto him the interpretation the kingdom of mozart nebuchadnezzar father the kingdom of majesty and glory and the honor and the majesty he gave him to people nations languages trembled in fear before him who would he s he slew and uh whom he would kept alive and would set up uh he would set up and whom he would he put down and his heart was lifted up and his mind heartened and pride disposed the king of the throne and he was driven from his sons and his men and his heart was made like a beast amen his heart was made like a beast and his dwelling was wild asses and fed him grass like oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till he knew that the most high god ruled in the kingdom now going on in this story you can take that down going on in this story i just want to want to um just kind of point out how how the the the king um took those sacred vessels amen and had such disrespect amen for the vessels of god and and and if we go on there we see that the the the handwriting that was on the wall uh uh was uh uh that you had were weighed into balance and found wanting uh the king had done a horrible thing amen because he uh uh really upset amen the lord because of his unbelief amen and disrespected the sacred vessels amen amen i've read earlier in corinthians about we have a treasure that's hidden in earthen vessels amen so we want to look at the the the the the scales you are you are weighed in the balance and found wanting so that symbol of a scale that that the king was kind of caught in a in a in a situation there amen if you go to any courtroom you'll see a man uh a symbol that that that balances is there a symbol of judgment amen you can um it's it's always been uh sort of in the olden days i guess they they use the balance uh uh a sort of like a cash register and even today you can you sometimes you go through your produce department and you have to weigh your produce it's so much per pound it's uh your meat is sold so much per pound so your commodity goods uh uh uh attain their value by their weight okay it could have a certain amount amen if i had one penny would weigh a certain amount but if i had a hundred pennies it weighs a certain so a scale balanced a man it had a sense of value to it and they used the scale to to figure out how much amen or or or or or uh you was given or how of the the cost how much you was doing so the the sin that nebuchadnezzar had had had done by taking these sacred vessels amen and and and using these vessels amen to to drink to other gods amen he had come he he sinned a great sin amen and and and what a weight on the vessel on the scale amen that that sin of unbelief because see he didn't it it it the unbelief that he didn't believe that those vessels amen was so sacred he had uh he had he had a doubt in his heart so so it the the act of the party and the act of drinking the wine and what he did to the vessels were attributes of the unbelief of the value and the seriousness of what he was doing so it it it was a it was a great sin it was a great weight amen in the in in the uh in the scale so he was weighed in that balance and in the balance there if it's even you're at zero amen i i want to say tonight my brothers and sisters i don't want to be at zero when when when the balance is i'm weighed in the balance and balancing my favor i i i want the weight amen amen of the love of jesus christ amen that's in my heart to to to bottom out why because see uh uh uh the the bible talks about the weight of sin come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and i'll give you rest see he had in the garden of eden amen uh uh uh uh when the sin began and and we we come into the world the way we did we come into the world already with the scales tipped amen we are we are already found wanting wanting we have a need amen to some for for for someone to come and write the scales in our favor amen we we were born found wanting amen the weight of sin the weight of of of sin over was overtaking us but thank be to god at calvary amen the blood of jesus christ amen there was no heavier object amen no nothing on the earth had more value to it than the blood of god that was shed for us and it'll write any scale why because it'll erase all of the sins so there's nothing over there all of it is over the weight and the scale is just tip totally in your favor there's nothing against you there's nothing over there on that scale it's light as a feather because he took your sins and bored to calvary amen when you accept that blood amen you have to do more than just mentally accept it we'll get into that just a little bit here so that great weight amen everyone has their own scale now we we we see that that that that that sometimes people and the devil is a real trickery we see things that are that that are that are that are that are uh he'll give you something that maybe look heavy fools gold look heavy but it it has no substance to it see it's something that's hollow and painted over it's got a shine but it has no substance there's no there's no bottom to it there's it's it's not dense it's not there it's it's it looks good it looks like the original but there's no real weight to it it carries it's nothing it'll never tip the scale the prophet said we should balance our lives against the against the word amen the word of god will balance out the scales of of this of this of sin and that that that that were transgressions in our lives amen so we see a false scale is an abomination so the devil tries to offer you something that you would think is heavy enough to tip the scales it looks heavy well look at what i got i go to church every day let's put that on the scale it don't do nothing the weight of sin is still sitting there i give to the poor i give to my charities but the weight of sin is still there you're still weighed in the balance and found wanting amen i i'm a good person i've never stole anything in my life uh uh um i do good to people i'm fair fair i'm a fair man but fair woman i've i've never committed adultery on my husband that weight is still there amen there's more that you must do to tip the scales in your favor amen uh we can we can we can do all sorts of things amen the prophet of god if you don't mind if i just look at a little bit of this amen in the message thirsting for life he was talking about how he's a hunter and sometimes he he gets uh he watched the old deer and the wolf gets after the deer and man and that deer is running from that wolf and and they and and and the wolf is right on the deals hiding parts and if he can ever lunge and get a piece of that whoopsie what the wolf does here he's talking about it and he says he'll get that that wolf of a grab a bite and throw his weight to throw him off balance see i want you to understand let's see balance amen it's more than just a scale it's more than just a scale the prophet said one place he says spiritual amnesia will cause you to lose your balance forget who you are see and cause you to lose your balance in that way see what happens now is is is is is you're beginning to uh take on fool's gold instead of the real thing amen and the weight of sin is still on the balance and you're in you're you're you're found wanting amen a lot of people say well you must have a balance in this life well you gotta have a balance y'all just go to church church church you gotta have a balance wait a minute that don't mean balance with the world that don't mean balance with we ain't trying to balance with the world i want the scale well not to work bam all the way over i'm down i'm sure i got weight why what is the weight what is that weight that i'm talking about the token the blood of jesus christ man he came and shed his blood amen you must have the token what is the token the blood on display amen so we're looking at this this this this the scale and and and and reference here amen let me go back to the wolfram you notice the wolf hey man he gets a hole in he and he sort of swings his balance a little bit to cause this deer that's running for his dear life amen he began to bleed or as he's bleeding he's losing strength but the prophet said as long as he stayed near that water and he crossed back and forth that river amen that wolf will never catch you because he'll go up and you go back and he'd go back in here drink a little water you go again he go again he drink a little water i don't care what you're going through i don't care how wounded you may be i don't care how difficult the trial may be i read the scripture in corinthians that we are troubled on every hand amen that we are perplexed amen but not forsaken cast down but not downtrodden amen we stay near the water amen in my heart just kind of ate and i saw a young sister this this weekend coming to church i didn't say no i just looked at her and i just said stay stay near the water sister she looked at me i said just stay near the water you'll be all right and while willie was preaching he began to speak to the young folks and say i see what you're going through god see what you're going through and just shut that little encouragement out stay near the water you're going to go free after a while if the hounds of hell may be on you you may be wounded you may be troubled you may not understand it but what is it it's the tender hand of jehovah amen guiding you to a place to where you can drink and be strengthened sometimes some people have to go through some things i had a situation just this evening out in the back i parked out there and i noticed these guys all the time because that's my job i come in early and they sit back there and they and they do their thing so i sit right there in my part right in the middle of sat in my truck they looking at me i'm looking at them they bold they gonna fire these little stuff up right there all right no problem so i began to get out of the truck and i started to come in and uh he said got a church i said up there i turned around and said yep and i said what you doing we just getting a little relaxation on i told him i say man that stuff for kid you i say uh there's plenty other ways to get your relaxation on you don't have to do that and i told them i say see that is life that is death masquerading as life fools go you think you're living and think you're having a good time but you're killing yourself when i began to tell him my testimony i said ain't no one of y'all out here hope my mama still might work man ain't none of one of y'all out here smoke more weed than me and i began to share with him he and the young man come to me and say well it's a herb i say so it's nutmeg you ain't smoking that so don't come telling me that i say if it's a herb boil it drink it put it in a tea don't smoke it that's the sin of witchcraft and that's why you're doing it that's the devil killing you he's every time every puff you take a little bit of life is leaving you just this evening every puff you take a little bit of life is leaving you you're shortening your life i say boil it drink it i say i tell you what get some sour sap leaves boil it and drink it it'll almost give you the same effect relax you and put you right to sleep see but the devil ain't gonna tell you that see you don't have to you don't have to you don't have to you don't have to believe the devil's lie so we find that the weight of sin is heavy it's heavy and it has a heavy price it takes a the something real something with substance to it to to balance and to to to read it from the scales of of the judgment amen so that hulk that that that that deer amen as long as he stay near the water amen he has a chance to get away the minute that deer leaves that river amen is a certain death we're talking about the tender hand of jehovah and how amen the the the lord amen talk about he would how he would leave the 99 and go after the one but you know when you when you when you hear the story and you talk about it everyone thinks that it's old man it's so so so so beautiful how the lord would just go after this nice sheep and bring it back but he'd go after that sheep and break his legs so it won't run no more seemed cruel doesn't it seem awful cruel but then he take that sheet amen and he hoisted up across his shoulders amen because the shoulders are the strongest part of his body as who is the body of christ we are you or his shoulders what'd he do he take that wounded that wounded that wounded that wounded sheep and take him across his shoulders maybe that was a wounded sheep and uh he'd come and he'd be maybe come to church and come and we'll bear him up on our shoulders carry him for a while amen be able able to minister to him in kindness amen and told him a little bit come on we'll carry you we'll pray you through amen we find sometimes people may come and they may be wounded and things and and the lord put them in our care put them across the shoulders why because we're it's the strongest part of his body he's entrusted that job to us he don't have literal shoulders we the body of christ is his shoulders you and i so we take we he's entrusted that so we see him there and they come and and and we don't see him for a while give your brothers and sisters a call pray with them maybe the hounds of hell is after them maybe they just need a drink of water just a little encouragement amen may make all the difference in the world we have a great responsibility in my brothers and sisters amen the tender hand of jehovah i don't know what route that that many of us take to to be where we are today amen i'm sure everyone has a story everyone has uh uh uh uh of things that happened oh god that just was like traumatic oh how why me but he had it was moving you right into a perfect place right where he wanted you to be it may seem hard it may seem but uh and a lot of times you know like the the tender hand of jehovah he had to go get the sheep and the sheep go through the breaking legs now he's got to be nurtured and he got to be ruined and everything but the sheep shouldn't laugh look what you running out what you going over why you keep running off ain't the wolf going to get you so what am i saying just like brother brother smile said now i'm talking we did like we our worst problem we called it on myself then why me why am i going through this but it's in the hand of jehovah of us and give mercy and kindness anyway amen tip the scales in our favor i want to read something that the prophet said here in the message the token we must remember that no matter what we do a how successful in life without christ we've totally lost everything i don't care how successful you are in life without christ you've totally lost everything so if he is all that there is to look forward to uh park44 thank you um there is to look forward to then we would uh be most foolish people not to accept it and cherish it not only accept it but you come to something greater than that after you've got it don't take it and lay it on the shelf it's to be put into use like going to the doctor to get medicine and said it on the shelf if you go to get the medicine take the medicine and if a disease bothers you and this remedy is supposed to help you you take what he gives you and just the way he he says give it because sometimes just a few minutes make a lot of difference in the way that you give it but sometimes just a few minutes make a lot of difference in the way you give it and how we know but in this case today just one moment of your decision might determine your eternal destination take it just as he hands it to you a token the blood shall be a token now the first token is a word that's commonly used among the word token i'm sorry at first the word token is a word that's commonly used among english-speaking people especially in america a token is uh really the dictionary says a token is a sign it's a sign of a fair price paid see a fair or a price required that's been paid amen so a token amen talking about those scales and the balance amount of scales the only thing that's going to write that scale amen is the token the the the the the the blood of jesus christ amen amen is is is the only thing the only thing that's going to be substance enough for the great sin amen that was committed amen in the beginning amen and we all have to have that amen to write the scales in our favor amen nothing else to do no fools go amen you can't you can't manipulate the scale sometime in business crooked business what they try to do is tweak the scale and try to manipulate the scale no this scale is true amen there uh is a a a a a a a a life amen a perverted life amen won't tip the scale and a lot of times what people uh uh uh there's probably talking about there's two kinds of life there's a there's a life and there's a perverted life and that's what i was trying to get the young man on the outside to understand that's not life it's death dressed up to look like life it has no weight to it amen you know we have a covenant we have a promise in this hour amen but the prophet said in the token paragraph 125 he say remember if that token was not displayed even the covenant was annulled when i read that i thought oh my god lord let me display the token even the covenant wasn't those he says that's right the covenant was a null there was no there was no covenant as long as the token wasn't there the token stood for the covenant god made a covenant with them yes sir but the token had to be it wasn't in effect the covenant wasn't unless the token was there and we read that the token was the evidence that the price has been paid amen that the scales of this balance was tipped in your favor amen you were no longer weighed in the balance of judgment and found in the negative amen in god's economy we always want to be a man on the right side we want to we want to we want this to the scales to lean all the way over amen we don't want to straddle the fence in this hour hey man we don't want to make excuses and we don't want to live a part-time christian life we want to go all the way with god we want the scales tipped in our favor amen the prophet said there might be uh many jews that say come here uh i i ain't got no blood on my door but let me show you i've been circumcised he says that don't mean nothing brother when i see the blood i'll pass over you he say uh uh you might say i'm a believer my mother was a believer my my mother was a member of this church my daddy was a member of this church i've been a member there since i was a child that don't mean that he says i don't lie i don't steal i don't do this i don't do that he says i don't mean that i belong to the branham tabernacle i do this or the other i believe all the word them jews could say i believe jehovah he listened to that message of the hour if he did certainly if he believed jehovah he'd listen to that message of the hour the message of the hour at that time was put the blood over the doorpost it wasn't enough to just be in egypt because see the time before salvation was just coming amen up under joseph and being in egypt and it sustained them that was salvation that i i i imagine you would call it the church of joseph amen we we we we come down here we belong to the church of joseph amen we we come to egypt who's your people they they they live down there in goshen and and they and and they all went to the church of joseph they was they were safe under under the protection of joseph because a man uh he was the second in charge and he brought all of his family in to the kingdom amen and and and took care of him so that was salvation at that time amen but the bible says there rosa pharaoh who knew not joseph things began to change amen and god sent a mighty deliverer amen it was time to move on time to move on in the gospel amen there was a there's a land out there flowing with milk and honey amen that is the baptism of the holy ghost amen and he had to get them to move out so to tend the hand of jehovah amen had to cause some things to go wrong down there in goshen if these things hadn't went down wrong down there in goshen and the pharaoh had to put the pressure on the people you know what they'd have been comfortable staying right there amen we was in our denominational churches and things like that if things hadn't gone wrong and things had we hadn't begun to see things going wrong and we would have been comfortable right there amen living in a world of sin if if things hadn't gone wrong and some of the things had they went wrong we'd have been comfortable still right there where we were amen but the ten day hand that you hope had to shake things up amen why because i got greater for you i have more for you things that you can't even fathom but what i have to do sometime is to get you to move amen i may have to uh a cause a little heartache you may have to go through some things and you may not understand it but it's the tender hand of jehovah moving you into a place why because you want to write the balance in your favor see the balance was not every now and then you you you get a little comfortable amen and and and a balance that was probably once like this you begin to the the weight of sin begins to kind of balance that thing out we don't want to die in that posit in that condition to be weighed in the balance to be found wanting in the economy of god amen we want the holy ghost and power we we're not we're living in a time where everybody wants power now i'ma say this i hear them all talking about you you got one group marching streets all in black power you got another group riding around and doing things they want white power amen but thank god i want the holy ghost and powers that's the only power i want amen the power that's going to make me die to myself the power that's going to give me the strength and the courage to to to yield a man to to his word what a power but see the devil got him so god have sold this crab i don't wanna power everybody want power in the south food's gold has no weight to it you're weighed in the balance and found wanting amen you may say they had a lot of messages but this was the message of that hour see i believe the message of the hour yeah the blood is applied in the evening time they might have said i'm a jew i'm a christian people say today i'm a christian i can show you my long membership i want you to tell me where i ever stole anything was ever in a long courts show me where i've ever committed adultery show me i've ever done all these things or something like that show me one place that don't mean a thing now no see no matter how much covenant he was the covenant is without effect it's not a faith you say well i'm a bible student he says i don't care what are you without that covenant the wrath of god is upon you in other words you've been weighed in the balance all of that stuff all of those things they're good but it's gonna it's not enough to write the scales in your favor it's caught up with you see yeah your sins will find you out amen what is sin unbelief you've disbelieved the message you've disbelieved the word you've disbelieved the witness of the token itself when it's identified itself in the midst of us and you have disbelieved that no matter how much you believe it you disbelieve it it's got to be applied amen you might say i believe it i believe it i believe it's the truth i accept it as the truth then that's all good but yet it's got to be applied it's got to be on display amen it's got to be on display amen why this one jew standing there stirring the blood of the lamb was bleeding saying this is jehovah and there's still the priest saying yes sir i believe that's true but on his own house it hasn't been applied now i wonder did y'all catch that he's actually sitting there and he's staring at and i i i don't know why he's learning maybe he's passing it out to other people to go do it but he hadn't applied it to his own house he's giving it out but he took he failed to apply it amen to his own house amen my brothers and sisters we're seeing this and daniel how it was talking about uh uh of the king where he got lifted up in his heart and pride caused him a man that he he felt he was so safe they had great medicine they had uh he had a great army amen they were so he was so secure felt so secure don't ever get to a place where you feel so secure and so lifted up that you no longer want from god that you no longer need more i want more of you lord my brothers and sisters every time we come through the doors of the church come under expectation i need more of you lord we're up we we are a you know the kids say it's it it's getting real it's getting real we've been we've we've been in the message a while we've gone church and we've we've we've we've come and we've we've we've paid our times and we've sing the songs of zion and we've we've done all of these things but let me tell you something is getting real we are in a time where where where where it's it's always been real but the closer you get to to to to to the culmination or to the to to to the to the battle to the to the to the center of the battle to the culmination of all the events oh my god it just gets more and more real look at what pray for the people down there in fort lauderdale can you imagine laying in your bed at night going to bed thank you to god we'll wake up in glory but a lot of people didn't wake up and close i don't care what you say people ain't wake up here glory and no sense of lying to them people if their heart wasn't right with god they didn't wake up in glory if the if the ballot if the scale wasn't tipped in their favor they didn't wake up in glory didn't wake up in glory and this happened during pride month coincidence lord let me apply the blood the token and let it be applied amen so that if i ever find myself in a situation i'm not found wanting i want to keep my books balanced hey man i want to pay my i want to pay my debts i don't know oh i don't want to find myself owing you lord the weight of sin is heavy it's heavy so may i come to you lord and lay down my burdens amen receive what you have already carried to the cross lord amen and apply it amen let it let the world see that lord i i i i i i'm one of yours we read the scripture in corinthians that the weight what is this substance this substance something that's real but it's in our earthen vessel the only thing that's going to tilt me over amen is to have the the the the jesus the god jehovah on the inside other than that you're superficial there's no real weight to you the weight of sin is just going to tilt over i don't care how good how much good you do how much good you do in society how much you come to church how much we pass out tracks all of that is fine but it's not enough to write the scale of sin in your life you may not even you may not even commit sin but it's the sin of unbelief to reject the message of the hour well i go to church i got a good baptist preacher if you're not seeking the baptism of the holy ghost it's a superficial gospel it's not enough to just be going to church it's not enough well i read my bible that ain't enough you need to be there's if there's ever a time to seek the baptism of the holy ghost that's the token and that token must be displayed that token must be displayed you are deity on earth again amen you fight it if you want them attend the hand of jehovah i'll move you right into where you need to be amen i'm praying for the tender hand of jehovah well let me tell you something turn to the hand of jehovah is so tender but you know what it always it it it may seem hard but when you come through the battle and when you come through the struggle amen and when when he fill you with his presence and you look back from where you was amen to where you're at now you say thank you lord the tender hand of jehovah i was talking to those young men and i was a time when i was right where they were and here i am now can speak to them tender hand of jehovah had to go through some hard stuff had to go through some terrible trials but when you yield and you allow the holy spirit to nurture you and bring you up healing has no greater healing than the healing of your soul there's no greater healing amen than the healing of your mind spiritual amnesia has caused you to lose your balance your weight in the balance and final wanting you that i maybe uh uh uh well i i have my i got my church i go to i stay home and i read the bible i i stay home and i read the message books see the baptism of the holy ghost because the prophet said the holy ghost can't wait to get to church if you comfortable sitting home reading the message books i ain't going to say what you ain't got but all i know is the prophet said the holy ghost can't wait to get now let every man govern themselves you govern yourself i don't mean to want you to come and just and and and tear down your denomination or or or your club or your your your uh society you know maybe i'll do maybe y'all go out there we can feed feed the hungry but as i said earlier there's a we live in the in the richest country in the world there's a there's a we got a pantry and there's pantries all over the place so the one thing you're not you know you're not gonna go physically hungry in this country you ain't gonna go without clothes you go to the goodwill and they get close and people walking around naked and people walking around starving there's a famine a famine for the word of god there's a lack of clothes because the word of god is what clothes you and they're blind naked miserable and wretched and don't know it they need a healing of the mind the baptism of the holy ghost will write the scale in your favor amen you don't want to be weighed in the balance and found wanting amen let's see how much time i got let's read on a little bit of this here amen and they stood in the priests uh paul said i give my blood my body to be burned as they sacrifice give all the goods to feed the poor and have faith to move mountains and so forth and speak in tongues like men and angels and all those other things and said i am nothing until the token has been applied until this token that's what i'm speaking on tonight the love see now until this has been applied on nothing i don't care you might have cast out devils you might have healed the sick by your prayer of faith you might have done all these things but if that token is not there you are under the wrath of god you might be a believer you might stand in the pulpit and preach the gospel many will come to me in that day and say lord lord not uh have not i prophesied in your name preached in your name has not i cast out devils in your name that's both methodist baptist pentecost jesus said depart from me you workers of iniquity i never even knew you but when i see the token i'll pass over you it's god requirement of the hour the evening time message is to apply the token you want to know what the message is it is to apply the token satan has thrown all kinds of counterfeits of shaking hands and evidences and everything like that forget it the hour has arrived that the token itself not some counterfeit not make believe substitutionary thing anything the hour is here now the token himself is identifying himself right among us and proving that he is the same jesus to yesterday today and forever and he might with the word and he's right with the word it's got to be applied a man that says he's got the token and deny this word then what about it see you can't do it the token has got to be there when i the blood shall be a token unto you now the holy spirit the life that was in the blood is a token unto you get to it in a moment see the holy ghost is the token the case is closed yes sir the case is closed the holy ghost is the token brother my brothers and sisters if i ever preached anything we we we we uh like i said before it's getting real and i and i don't mean that as if to say it hasn't always been real but there's nothing more important right now today this very moment than the baptism of the holy ghost and i'm not talking about a one-time experience i'm talking about a feeling and a refilling amen from old ones to the children if we know as for a fact that god wants to give it to you you that may be listening online there'll be some things coming i'm not going to share but there'll be some things coming that'll god wants to give it to you whatever you need whatever you need god's got it and he wants to give you the baptism of the holy ghost he wants to give you the token accept it and apply it may it be on display in your life it's the only thing that's going to write the scales of seeing in your life to where when the hour comes that you're not weighed in the balance found wanting my prayers that attend the hand of jehovah leads you and guide you in the path of righteousness for his namesake it may not be easy you may have to go through some tough times but stay near the water
