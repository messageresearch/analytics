[5:50] uh we're going to be continuing this uh
[5:52] the series on the spiritual gifts of the
[5:54] church so this will be a part two uh and
[5:57] if we could turn our Bibles to 1
[5:59] Corinthians
[6:00] 121 we'll do a scripture reading before
[6:02] we do a prayer and uh take our
[6:09] seats and it reads now concerning
[6:12] spiritual grips brother Brethren I would
[6:15] not have you ignorant Lord Jesus Christ
[6:19] we come before you oh Lord God lord we
[6:21] know oh Lord that only you oh Lord can
[6:24] give us the interpretation of your words
[6:27] and the intentions behind it oh Lord God
[6:30] Lord there have been people through the
[6:31] years that have gone through Seminary
[6:33] school from young to old oh Lord God and
[6:35] haven't been able to get an ounce of
[6:37] your wisdom oh Lord God and your
[6:39] Revelation oh Lord God but Lord you you
[6:42] decided before the foundation of the
[6:44] world oh Lord God that there would be a
[6:45] group in Florida oh Lord God and there
[6:47] would be peculiar people that you would
[6:49] pick out oh Lord Jesus Christ that we
[6:52] may not be the smartest in the world we
[6:54] may not be the greatest in the world we
[6:55] may not have many riches oh Lord God but
[6:58] Lord you saw us in loved us oh Lord God
[7:01] and because of that word of love that
[7:02] you spoke to us oh Lord God you had to
[7:05] reveal yourself to us oh Lord God you
[7:07] had to pour your knowledge and your
[7:09] wisdom oh Lord upon us oh Lord God to
[7:11] help us to understand what your
[7:13] expectations of us in life are oh Lord
[7:15] God in order for us to be healed oh Lord
[7:18] God in order for us to be delivered oh
[7:19] God lord the loved ones oh Lord that are
[7:22] still lost in the world oh Lord Jesus
[7:24] Christ Lord we're praying to you oh Lord
[7:26] God but Lord I know you're revealing to
[7:28] us that we are the light for them oh
[7:30] Lord Jesus Christ and Lord we can only
[7:32] get this light as you reveal it to us oh
[7:34] Lord so Lord we ask that you bless this
[7:37] little uh little lesson today oh Lord
[7:39] bless the people Lord God whatever needs
[7:41] that they have on their hearts and their
[7:43] soul oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord You're
[7:45] the same Jesus Christ when you walked on
[7:47] the earth oh Lord God you're the same
[7:48] Jesus Christ when you were in the
[7:50] prophet of his age oh Lord God and oh
[7:52] Lord we're so thankful that your spirit
[7:54] has not changed oh Lord Jesus Christ it
[7:56] still wants to operate through the
[7:58] people Lord God so whatever needs they
[8:00] have on their minds their souls their
[8:02] their worries oh Lord God if they can't
[8:04] even speak a word let the worries reach
[8:06] you oh Lord God let the fears reach you
[8:08] oh Lord God let the stress reach you oh
[8:11] Lord God and speak a word and Minister
[8:13] over them oh Lord God oh Lord we ask it
[8:16] oh Lord God in the precious name of
[8:17] Jesus Christ
[8:19] amen amen you may all have your seats
[8:22] now
[8:24] um
[8:26] so we're going to continue this uh
[8:28] little topic on we we'll uh go a little
[8:31] bit more further into the gifts a couple
[8:32] more gifts to um kind of get a
[8:35] revelation of what these things are and
[8:38] I love how Paul says uh for us how he
[8:40] doesn't want us to be ignorant of how
[8:42] these gifts work right because it's by
[8:45] Revelation that you have to receive
[8:46] something anytime anytime you want to
[8:48] receive something from God you first
[8:50] have to have the revelation of what it
[8:52] is and then you have to also have to
[8:53] have the faith to be able to use to uh
[8:56] uh receive that from God that's right
[8:58] all right and so in Matthew um uh 13:15
[9:01] I'll just read this real quick it says
[9:03] for these people's heart is waxed gross
[9:06] and their ears are dull of hearing and
[9:08] their eyes they have closed least at any
[9:10] time they should see with their eyes and
[9:11] hear with their ears and should
[9:12] understand with their hearts and should
[9:14] be converted and I should heal them and
[9:16] I'm so thankful that you know we believe
[9:18] the Bible but not every verse is for us
[9:21] right and so these people right here uh
[9:24] uh of course Christ is talking about how
[9:26] they don't have the understanding they
[9:28] don't have the knowledge they don't have
[9:29] the wisdom and the faith to be able to
[9:31] receive from God so I love how Paul puts
[9:34] a little uh uh um a little verse in
[9:37] there for us so we're not ignorant about
[9:39] how these things work so that we can
[9:41] understand how to get our healing how to
[9:43] get our deliverance right so we're going
[9:46] to uh read 1 Corinthians
[9:49] 4-10 uh 1 Corinthians 12 4-10 just to
[9:52] kind of go over the spiritual gifts once
[9:55] again and it reads now there are
[9:57] diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit
[10:00] and there are differences of
[10:01] administrations but the same lord and
[10:03] there are diversities of operations but
[10:05] it's the same God which worketh all in
[10:07] all but the manifestation of the spirit
[10:09] is given to every man to um profit with
[10:12] all uh for to one is given by the spirit
[10:14] the word of wisdom to another the word
[10:16] of knowledge by The Same Spirit to
[10:18] another to another Faith by The Same
[10:21] Spirit to another the gifts of healing
[10:22] by The Same Spirit to another the
[10:24] working of Miracles to another prophecy
[10:27] to another Discerning of spirits to
[10:29] another diverse kinds of tongues and to
[10:31] another the interpretation of tongues so
[10:34] we have to expect that all these gifts
[10:36] are in the church and the prophet said
[10:38] the local church because a lot of times
[10:41] people want to push these gifts off onto
[10:43] great men and we appreciate Great Men We
[10:46] Appreciate Ministries uh I know brother
[10:48] Wesco has a great gift of faith and we
[10:50] know brother or Roberts in the past had
[10:52] a great gift of faith and we know a lot
[10:54] of these ministers out here have good GS
[10:56] good gifts of Faith but a lot of us
[10:58] can't get to them
[10:59] but that doesn't mean that God still
[11:01] can't reach you which is why the prophet
[11:03] said he places all of these local gifts
[11:05] inside of the church so that you have
[11:07] access to God 100% of the time right
[11:11] during the time of Jesus Christ a lot of
[11:13] people couldn't access him because he
[11:14] was in one body but when he died and
[11:16] split his Spirit Out Among the people he
[11:19] made himself more accessible so that
[11:21] there is a and I like that I like the um
[11:24] um I like it because now we can access
[11:27] him we can talk to him we can commune
[11:29] from and we can get something out of him
[11:31] at any time and we don't have to uh
[11:33] worry about you know going and getting a
[11:35] prayer card or going to meet so and so
[11:37] at their house but we can pray hey Lord
[11:39] I know that you have a a particular gift
[11:41] in this church now and I would like to
[11:43] use this gift in order to uh to get a
[11:45] result right so what we're going to do
[11:49] we're just going to recap what we
[11:50] learned uh last week in regards to the
[11:52] gift of knowledge and wisdom we'll just
[11:54] do this real quick uh so the purpose of
[11:57] wisdom was to give instruction in order
[11:59] for you to have a lasting uh uh and to
[12:02] have lasting results for both spiritual
[12:04] and natural things right so that's why
[12:06] when Jesus said unless you eat of My
[12:08] Flesh um eat of My Flesh and drink of my
[12:10] blood you won't have uh life with me and
[12:13] that life he was talking about was
[12:14] everlasting life so it was wisdom to
[12:17] give instruction in order to receive
[12:19] everlasting life inside of your soul
[12:22] right and then we also know of Solomon
[12:24] Solomon used the gift of wisdom and also
[12:27] of discernment and we see used the gift
[12:30] of wisdom in the situation it's a
[12:31] popular story about how um he used uh
[12:35] the two mothers were fighting over the
[12:36] child uh and Solomon used the gift of
[12:39] wisdom in a peculiar way just like
[12:41] Christ had did when he asked he said let
[12:44] me get the sword and I'll cut the child
[12:45] in half one of the mothers he could uh
[12:48] one of the mothers he was using that
[12:49] wisdom to pull what was inside of the
[12:52] people out and so one of the mothers
[12:54] said okay yeah go ahead and cut it cut
[12:56] it in half and I'll take one half now
[12:58] that was a representation of something
[12:59] that was Notting but then the other
[13:01] mother said no just give her the baby in
[13:04] order for in order for it to live and
[13:06] then with that gift of wisdom that
[13:07] Solomon had he was able to point out
[13:09] okay this is the true one right here
[13:11] right and that's exactly what Jesus
[13:13] Christ did when he gave out his words of
[13:15] wisdom because the unbelievers when they
[13:17] heard that word they walked away and
[13:19] said this man is crazy then he went to
[13:21] his disciples he said will you also
[13:22] leave me and Peter said a beautiful
[13:24] thing he said where else are we going to
[13:26] go thou has the words of life amen so he
[13:30] accepted that wisdom and Christ was able
[13:32] to recognize who the true ones were
[13:34] right so that's wisdom and um the
[13:37] purpose of knowledge is to allow us to
[13:40] get closer to God that's the whole
[13:42] reason that we have knowledge and we
[13:44] know that knowledge is not something um
[13:46] you learn uh Jesus told Peter when he
[13:49] had asked a question he was trying to
[13:50] get something out of people he had asked
[13:52] them a question which is uh a question
[13:54] means you're trying to receive some kind
[13:55] of knowledge back and Peter gave the
[13:58] right answer and CHR was and Jesus
[13:59] Christ was able to perceive that flesh
[14:02] and blood has not revealed this to you
[14:04] but my Father which in heaven had given
[14:06] has given you these things and he gave
[14:08] Peter the keys to heaven right so that
[14:10] knowledge that Peter had had given to
[14:12] God brought him closer to God right so
[14:14] he got the keys to get closer to God
[14:17] right and so these gifts are not used
[14:20] for personal gain right that's an
[14:22] important thing that we have to uh
[14:24] understand even as we get more Church uh
[14:27] more people in the church because a lot
[14:29] of times PE that's why I say that's why
[14:31] Paul says I would not have you ignorant
[14:33] because a lot of times you know Gentiles
[14:35] come into church with their culture now
[14:37] they're gifted but they come in their
[14:39] culture and the gifts start messing up
[14:42] the church right right uh I I remember
[14:45] brother Smiley uh told me one time when
[14:46] I said this before he said gifts can get
[14:48] you in trouble and that's usually how it
[14:51] happens that's usually how a church
[14:52] starts to break down is when there's not
[14:55] a uh an order of gifts right and you
[14:57] start getting impersonations and all
[14:59] these things and all of a sudden the
[15:00] church is in just in uh distress just
[15:03] like it was during the time with the
[15:04] children of Israel right so gifts are
[15:06] not to be used for a personal gain and
[15:08] the gift of knowledge is not for you to
[15:10] walk around uh acting like you know
[15:13] everything or or even if you do know
[15:16] everything it's not for you to be kind
[15:17] of puffed up in uh in your spirit um
[15:20] because the problem with that and why
[15:22] knowledge is very very important because
[15:24] Paul had received Revelation and he also
[15:28] had a little issue he was going through
[15:30] and he was praying for God to take it
[15:31] away and God said no I can't take this
[15:33] thing away because it'll puff you up
[15:35] because you're getting all this
[15:36] knowledge so knowledge makes you feel
[15:38] and become God and when you get around
[15:40] people that don't know and you begin to
[15:42] say what you begin to say they can feel
[15:44] a lot more smaller they start to feel
[15:46] more distant uh distance away from you
[15:48] because they don't know what you know
[15:50] and and it's and it's like you're
[15:51] putting yourself in the position of God
[15:53] uh having dominion over the people but
[15:56] God never wanted us to use that kind of
[15:59] used knowledge in that way because when
[16:01] he came down he came in a Manger right
[16:04] and he had his gift of knowledge was
[16:07] beyond just a gift of knowledge and he
[16:08] had all knowledge but he walked with the
[16:10] common people he didn't wear the fancy
[16:12] clothes and all those things anyone
[16:14] could approach him and he had the
[16:16] knowledge of all things inside of him
[16:19] and so that's how God wants us to uh be
[16:21] when we have our gifts is to be humble
[16:23] so that people can approach us and it
[16:25] can be used correctly and we're not
[16:28] trying to get we don't have an agenda
[16:30] out of it where we're trying to get some
[16:31] kind of gain or oneup on uh a person all
[16:36] right so we're going to continue our
[16:37] journey now into um the gifts we're
[16:41] going to turn to 1st Chronicles 12 and
[16:44] read uh verses 9-1 to go to our uh go to
[16:47] the next gifts that are in the
[16:52] church oh yeah Corinthians
[16:54] sorry and it and it reads uh to another
[16:57] Faith by the same Spirit to another the
[17:00] gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to
[17:03] another the gift um to another the
[17:05] working of Miracles so we're going to
[17:08] talk about um so now these three G these
[17:11] three gifts I've done I've done my
[17:12] studying in the message and I found that
[17:14] they they work pretty similar as far as
[17:17] a as a result uh which is usually trying
[17:20] to get some kind of healing right so
[17:22] we're going to continue and start with
[17:24] uh this gift of faith so we all know
[17:26] that faith is a substance it's the
[17:29] evidence of something uh you don't see
[17:31] it but you believe that you have it
[17:33] right and all of us have faith every
[17:36] single one of us has Faith right if you
[17:38] are in the stature of the the perfect
[17:39] man you've received the baptism the Holy
[17:41] Spirit faith is included in that so
[17:44] Faith isn't something you learn about
[17:45] faith isn't something that you try to
[17:47] think up about it when you receed the
[17:49] baptism of the Holy Spirit you have a
[17:51] Measure of Faith right that just that
[17:54] that just uh uh that should bring you
[17:56] some uh uh assurity that that you have
[17:59] the ability to access anything that you
[18:02] need from God right so um um we're going
[18:07] to turn to um the message faith is the
[18:10] substance and uh it's a
[18:12] 47041 two in paragraph
[18:15] 20 and we're going to see what the
[18:17] prophet had said about this and I'll
[18:20] just start reading it while she pulls it
[18:21] up says now here now here not long ago
[18:25] I'll give you a little story of someone
[18:27] who came to someone who came so you can
[18:30] see what faith is and I'm just going to
[18:32] read this little first part right here
[18:34] faith is a gift of itself you may have a
[18:37] portion of it but there is a gift of
[18:40] faith and it's important to understand
[18:42] these things because a lot of times you
[18:44] can trip yourself up if you don't know
[18:46] how what what the difference is between
[18:49] your faith and a gift of faith right and
[18:52] you can kind of get yourself in a Sit
[18:54] situation where you believe oh I believe
[18:55] for my healing but I'm not healed yet
[18:57] and oh I don't have Faith no you've got
[18:59] faith you just got to know how to
[19:02] operate it which is why the the Holy
[19:04] Spirit comes into the church to teach us
[19:06] these things so that we can receive from
[19:07] him and we don't doubt him
[19:10] right so um we're going to continue on
[19:13] um so Romans 12 uh3 reads uh and I'll
[19:18] just read this quickly it says for I say
[19:20] through the grace given unto me to every
[19:23] man that is among you not to think of
[19:25] himself more highly than he ought to
[19:27] think so number one no no matter
[19:30] whatever gift that you have no matter
[19:32] whatever measure that you have
[19:33] everything that has been given to you
[19:34] has been by the grace of God and you
[19:36] can't be any bigger than yourself you
[19:38] can't be any smaller right so it says
[19:41] but to think soberly according as God ha
[19:44] dealt to every man The Measure of Faith
[19:47] so God has given you a Measure of Faith
[19:50] each one of us has a different Measure
[19:52] of Faith right and it can seem kind of
[19:55] peculiar when you're cuz when I was when
[19:57] I first became a Christian in you're
[19:59] reading these things it can it can kind
[20:00] of seem kind of weird like okay I have
[20:02] faith there's a gift of faith like what
[20:04] do these things all mean right um and it
[20:07] shows why we have to have knowledge of
[20:09] stuff in order to receive from God so
[20:11] each of us has been given a Measure of
[20:13] Faith then also you have this uh gift of
[20:15] faith and I like to use an analogy to uh
[20:18] describe how these things work right so
[20:21] we all have different heights in the
[20:23] church right everyone some people are
[20:25] tall uh some people are short right now
[20:28] let's say there's a shelf that's 8T in
[20:30] the air and you have a blessing up there
[20:33] with your name on it right your blessing
[20:35] is right there what your name on it it's
[20:38] yours but let's say you're only 5'5
[20:41] right now you're 5'5 so no matter how
[20:43] much you try to reach no matter how much
[20:45] you try to jump you ain't going to be
[20:47] able to get it yourself right but you
[20:49] got to remember the blessing is for you
[20:52] amen so how do you get it see God always
[20:55] provides a way you just got to put your
[20:58] you got to put your mind inside of his
[21:00] to understand how to get it right so now
[21:02] just because you can't get to that
[21:04] blessing uh that doesn't uh it shouldn't
[21:06] change your desire to want to get the
[21:08] blessing right it's yours it's got your
[21:11] name on it right so let's say you know
[21:13] you're 55 and you look to the left and
[21:16] you see someone who's s foot right now
[21:19] this person is seven foot and you have
[21:20] to understand that height is something
[21:22] that the Bible talks about is no one can
[21:23] add a stature to himself faith is your
[21:26] height is something that God has
[21:28] determined
[21:29] predetermined for you so some of you are
[21:30] tall some of you are short and no matter
[21:33] what you can't change it right so you
[21:36] you look to the left and you see someone
[21:38] who is s foot tall and you go over there
[21:41] and this is the key thing to remember
[21:43] you're not short enough to be able to
[21:45] reach the GU at s foot no matter what
[21:47] you'll always have enough height in
[21:50] order to reach somebody else right
[21:52] you're always going to have enough Faith
[21:54] to reach God in order to get what you
[21:56] really need from him you're never h and
[21:58] that's the thing that the enemy likes to
[22:00] come and bat on our head is oh you just
[22:01] ain't got enough Faith oh you're just
[22:03] not this you're just not that and it's
[22:05] just nothing but a it's nothing but a
[22:07] lie that's why that's why Paul could say
[22:09] death where is their where's your sting
[22:11] like you're just bluffing it to me
[22:13] because I know that I've received Christ
[22:14] I have faith and everything that I have
[22:16] need of I can I may not be able to get
[22:18] it with my own faith but I can reach out
[22:20] to something else that can get it for me
[22:23] right and so and that's why you know a
[22:25] lot of times people get discouraged they
[22:27] say because their faith is too weak weak
[22:28] and you got to get that weak uh word out
[22:31] of your vocabulary you got to get that
[22:33] weak word out of your vocabulary it is
[22:35] true that your faith may be small right
[22:38] and uh and I have and uh I think the
[22:40] prophet will talk about later on in the
[22:42] message because you know I have to we
[22:43] have to tell each other the truth you
[22:45] know a lot of times people like to throw
[22:47] like oh yeah I'll give you big Faith you
[22:49] may not have big Faith you may not have
[22:51] big Faith as uh uh someone else has or
[22:55] or a big Faith as somebody else has but
[22:56] when you have the baptism Holy Spirit no
[22:58] matter how small it is you still have a
[23:01] a Measure of Faith right so that's what
[23:03] the Bible talks about having a Measure
[23:05] of Faith but in Jesus said that if you
[23:07] have the faith of a mustard seed right
[23:10] you can move mountains now how that
[23:13] mountain is moved well that's up to God
[23:15] so we're going to turn to the message it
[23:17] shall be it shall be even um she can
[23:20] pull it up and I forgot the year so I
[23:22] can probably just read it it shall be
[23:24] even as it was told me and this is um a
[23:28] message that the prophet preached and
[23:30] I'll just go ahead and read uh this
[23:32] verse 65 says maybe you might not and
[23:35] also when he talks about this thing um
[23:38] it's going to it's going to tie into
[23:39] when we get to healings and miracles as
[23:41] well says maybe you might not have the
[23:43] spontaneous Faith to bring something uh
[23:46] just a miracle right to you like right
[23:48] quick like some people man they just
[23:50] speak and it just like it just pops
[23:51] right in there right in their lapse and
[23:53] people can get discouraged when they see
[23:55] that because they're thinking well why
[23:56] is not that happened to me that's right
[23:58] exactly that don't mean that you can't
[23:59] get whatever you need receiveing yours
[24:01] may take a little bit more time but the
[24:03] end result is you've got it that's the
[24:06] most important thing is that you
[24:09] got amen amen he said here you may not
[24:13] have that kind of Faith but Jesus said
[24:16] if um if you had the faith like a
[24:18] mustard seed you could you could sa this
[24:20] mountain be moved and by and by it will
[24:22] come to pass by and by will come to pass
[24:25] it wouldn't vanish away but by and by it
[24:27] will come to pass right
[24:32] um so your so your faith your faith is
[24:36] never and that's why we kind of got to
[24:38] we got to kind of shift our minds into
[24:40] the way God sees it and how how the way
[24:42] God designed us your faith is not small
[24:44] enough that you can't anchor on to
[24:46] something right you got to keep that in
[24:47] your mind that I may have a small Faith
[24:49] but I can anchor on to something that
[24:51] can help me to get whatever I need so
[24:54] that going back to the example of that
[24:55] five5 guy he can go up to that seven he
[24:57] can go up to that SF footer and he can
[24:59] tap on the shoulder his hand is not too
[25:01] short enough now his hand may not be
[25:02] able to reach that top shelf but he can
[25:04] still tap on that guy that 7even foot
[25:06] and say hey there's a box up there can
[25:08] you get it for me the seven footer looks
[25:10] up there he's like no problem just easy
[25:12] Faith just reaches it down comes down
[25:14] and then gives it to you and that's what
[25:16] a gift of faith is that's what a gift of
[25:18] faith is in a church there are
[25:20] individuals in the church that when they
[25:22] say stuff it just they just know they
[25:24] just believe it and know how to receive
[25:25] it you might be struggling uh to receive
[25:29] it but you can come to this individual
[25:30] and say Hey brother I got a need can you
[25:32] help me pray brother I have a situation
[25:34] can you come help me pray and then that
[25:36] can help come bring the blessing down
[25:39] into your own hands Glory right praise
[25:42] God and that's for healing that's for
[25:44] that's for uh anything that you uh that
[25:46] you that you uh might have need of right
[25:52] um so um you might be um you might be
[25:57] praying for for a new job right some
[25:59] people are looking for a new job the
[26:00] market might be tough um but your faith
[26:03] might not might not be enough for you to
[26:05] get that job but it doesn't mean that
[26:07] you can't you can't you can't receive it
[26:10] right you might need to get a hold of
[26:11] some brother or sister that has that
[26:13] gift of faith which is why God put it in
[26:14] the church and he said if two would
[26:16] touch and agree on one things I would do
[26:19] it right two would touch so you have to
[26:23] have two you have to have someone that
[26:25] has this gift of faith and you got to
[26:27] have this individual that he may not be
[26:29] able to have it but God wrote Provisions
[26:31] in there for those that even if you have
[26:33] small Faith you can still receive from
[26:37] God
[26:39] Amen you can still receive from
[26:42] God right we're not we're not we're not
[26:45] walking around like chickens we're not
[26:47] walking around like weak Christians we
[26:48] know exactly what we have God has given
[26:51] us the knowledge in order to be able to
[26:52] access him and when we walk according to
[26:55] his word he has to fulfill it right he
[26:58] has to fulfill it so that's the reason
[27:01] why we have to identify where the gifts
[27:05] are in the church we have to identify
[27:07] where the gifts are in the church that's
[27:09] why restoration of the gifts was so
[27:10] important to God because it's how he
[27:13] operates within the local church know
[27:15] the prophet couldn't be in one uh um be
[27:18] in one location simultaneously Jesus
[27:21] Christ himself couldn't be in a one
[27:23] location simultaneously but the gifts
[27:25] the restoration of the gifts was uh was
[27:27] was a way that God could reach everybody
[27:31] right reach everybody need so if you're
[27:32] going through some kind of issue you a
[27:34] have to oh well I need to uh wait to
[27:36] wake up to call the prophet to see if I
[27:37] can get some healing no no no You' got
[27:39] Gifts of healing right inside of the
[27:41] church you ain't got to worry about
[27:43] waiting on it and you can have someone
[27:45] that you can uh reach out to to help you
[27:47] uh get that healing that you want so you
[27:50] know and uh as going back to the example
[27:52] we can all identify who the tallest
[27:55] people in the room are and we can
[27:57] identify who the shortest people are we
[27:58] know who the strongest people are we
[28:00] know who the weakest people are and
[28:01] that's just the natural and the natural
[28:03] types the spiritual we should be able to
[28:05] identify those that got big Faith right
[28:08] we should be able to identify those that
[28:11] have faith to to move mountains that
[28:14] spontaneous Faith because they're there
[28:19] right amen so we need to identify the
[28:24] gifts and and that's why identification
[28:27] is is very important in restoration amen
[28:31] right because when we get our new church
[28:33] you know and me I'm not looking for
[28:35] 5,000 member church or a 10,000 member
[28:37] church right we want members that have
[28:39] been identified in the body of Christ
[28:41] which means they have a gift they have
[28:44] the Holy Spirit to help them live the
[28:45] life and to use the gift and operate the
[28:48] gift so every Sunday we're going to
[28:50] church and we ain't going to a club
[28:52] we're not going to a zoo we're not going
[28:54] to some place where you know cuz the
[28:56] gifts get out you know you have people
[28:57] coming church and the gifts get all out
[28:59] of order and it just causes the church
[29:01] to fall you know people start to
[29:03] impersonating gifts which creates
[29:05] jealousy and then people start using
[29:07] gifts in a way that is uh uh um with
[29:10] lusting spirits and you start breaking
[29:12] families up but no we want a church that
[29:15] people have been identified and restored
[29:17] back to their original position all
[29:20] right so then we can all be blessed and
[29:23] stay blessed all right so we're going to
[29:27] go through and uh look at some of these
[29:28] examples of a gift of gifts of faith I
[29:30] think we're just going to go through one
[29:32] it's uh the Queen of Sheba um preached
[29:35] in 60 0710 and we're going to read
[29:38] paragraph 17 I believe um
[29:43] yes oh wait yeah that's the one
[29:47] yep so it reads here now I believe that
[29:50] these Ministries that have we have that
[29:52] we have today across the world one
[29:53] different from the other I was watching
[29:55] brother or Roberts just a few moments
[29:57] ago in room they have a television in
[29:59] the room in there they have for me and
[30:01] that's amazing how the prophet was still
[30:05] he still looked at people even though
[30:06] they weren't in the message but yeah he
[30:08] still was considering them and like yeah
[30:11] man I'm just I'm interested in this
[30:12] person's Ministry and what they're doing
[30:14] for the Lord uh um and so he said and I
[30:17] was I heard them announce that or
[30:18] Roberts and I went over and turned the
[30:19] television on they did and I seen or
[30:22] oral praying for a little sick baby from
[30:24] up in Canada had a bad eye and I believe
[30:26] the parents was Catholic and brother
[30:28] Roberts in his real way of Faith he
[30:29] slammed his hand down on the little baby
[30:31] and prayed for it and the little baby
[30:34] was healed and he says here now that's a
[30:36] real gift of faith that brother Roberts
[30:39] had so the prophet wasn't I'm glad that
[30:41] we that I'm glad that God could get hold
[30:43] of a man that wasn't jealous jealous
[30:46] with the gifts of feeling and seeing
[30:48] someone else doing it but no he said no
[30:50] man that's a gift of faith over there
[30:52] that's a real gift of faith Opera over
[30:53] there even though he wasn't the one
[30:55] doing it and that's what we want to see
[30:57] in the church brother right right all
[31:00] right and we're going to continue and it
[31:02] says and we know that brother Jack Cole
[31:04] he used to have a little Anvil laying by
[31:05] the side of his desk somebody come up
[31:07] with glasses on he take the glasses off
[31:09] and break them with the hammer throw
[31:11] them over have crunches he take their
[31:13] crunches first and chop them up throw
[31:14] them away he burnt every bridge uh there
[31:18] they had only one Jack C and so he's
[31:20] talking about this man's gift of faith
[31:22] where he just hey look I believe you're
[31:24] healed and I ain't trying to see nothing
[31:25] else right he was
[31:30] determined
[31:31] but what I'm trying to hope to get
[31:34] though we've got or Robertson here we
[31:36] got Jack Coen
[31:39] here you
[31:41] know amen you know and when I get to the
[31:44] age where I start wearing glasses I want
[31:46] to be able to go to you and you break my
[31:48] glasses up so I can so I can see all
[31:54] right amen
[31:58] so so those are the gifts that is what
[32:01] to that is what the gift of faith is and
[32:04] what it is used for in order to help the
[32:07] church out right right and so we're
[32:09] going to talk about the next uh gifts
[32:11] that we have in the Bible and we're
[32:13] going to go back to 1st Chronicles 12 uh
[32:15] 9 through1 oh Corinthians yeah 1
[32:18] Corinthians
[32:19] 12 um 9-10 and we're going to start from
[32:24] to another the gifts of healing by The
[32:27] Same Spirit
[32:28] to another the uh the working of
[32:31] Miracles right um and so I group these
[32:35] two together because they they serve the
[32:37] same purpose in uh trying I believe in
[32:40] uh trying to bring uh some healing to
[32:42] somebody right uh so we we all
[32:45] appreciate how the prophet performed
[32:47] Miracles but the thing the thing I love
[32:49] about Jesus is when you get in a
[32:50] relationship with God you won't be
[32:52] dependent upon a man you you appreciate
[32:54] what God has done through man's but when
[32:56] you have Christ in in your life you
[32:58] realize that his Spirit does the same
[33:00] thing everywhere that's why the prophet
[33:02] could say that you know if you got the
[33:04] baptism the Holy Spirit and you can cut
[33:06] up and act up and this person got the
[33:07] baptism of the Holy Spirit and they
[33:09] living right there's something wrong we
[33:11] love his spirit because if it operates
[33:14] the same in one it does the works in one
[33:16] person it does it in all people right so
[33:19] to understand the gifts of healing we
[33:21] have to first understand what healing is
[33:24] right so we're Triune beings uh we have
[33:27] a body a spirit and a soul and what
[33:30] healing does it's pretty simple uh
[33:31] healing just brings you back to a
[33:33] desired state right healing brings you
[33:36] back to whatever desired state that you
[33:37] had uh and now there's a difference
[33:39] between the Bible says here uh the uh
[33:42] between Gifts of healing and then
[33:44] there's also a Divine gift which comes
[33:47] through the land and the prophet had a
[33:49] Divine gift of healing you know some
[33:51] people can kind of get these things
[33:53] twisted up but he but um I believe he
[33:56] explained it as he would get vibrations
[33:59] if he would touch someone's hand and he
[34:00] would see the sickness on on their wrist
[34:02] that's right and they pray for them the
[34:05] vibrations would go the sickness would
[34:06] go away and then he knew that they were
[34:08] healed now that was a Divine gift of
[34:10] healing only the prophet had that right
[34:13] uh it's a or it's a ordained gift before
[34:16] the foundational the world and only one
[34:17] person has that gift and God uses that
[34:20] as a basis to not be worshiped but for
[34:24] you to develop faith in healing all
[34:27] right because the gift is no longer here
[34:30] amen that gift is no longer here but has
[34:32] God stopped healing no well no all right
[34:36] so that gift is just to use to help
[34:37] build your faith in God to receive what
[34:40] you need to receive right amen um and
[34:45] so um then there's the gifts of healing
[34:49] which is uh the prophet described as uh
[34:51] many ways of healing um and what we need
[34:54] to understand uh the next thing that we
[34:56] need to understand is what happens
[34:59] during a healing and a miracle and for
[35:02] that we're going to turn to the message
[35:04] healing which was preached in 53
[35:07] 904 uh we're going to start from
[35:09] paragraph uh
[35:13] 24 and I'll just read a little bit of it
[35:15] and kind of skip over some of it so it's
[35:17] not too long so it reads now Believers
[35:21] here's what's the matter with you you're
[35:23] afraid to take the initiative you're
[35:24] afraid to stand and claim your god-given
[35:27] privilege see the devil actually leaves
[35:29] and when he goes out then you feel
[35:31] better for a few days and then after a
[35:33] while you say I'm getting sick about 72
[35:36] hours of real case less it's a miracle
[35:39] just a Vine so here he's making a
[35:40] distinction between miracle and healing
[35:43] now there's a difference between Gifts
[35:44] of Miracles and Gifts of healing does
[35:47] anyone know that there are two different
[35:49] gifts altoe now healing when the regular
[35:52] procedure that person will get good just
[35:54] a real good just a real good for a few
[35:56] days and then they get then they get
[35:58] real sick what's the matter that big
[35:59] lump of cancer in there is dead tissue
[36:02] no life in it it'll begin swelling
[36:04] swelling and know you get sick we're
[36:06] going to skip all the way down to 26
[36:08] paragraph 26 says in plain words where
[36:11] the simplest child would understand and
[36:13] the only way I know to put it it'll rot
[36:15] as it's laying right there there rotting
[36:17] in your body when it when it does your
[36:19] heart stream your bloodstream is being
[36:21] purified by your heart and it picks up
[36:24] that and causes sickness and headaches
[36:26] and know you can't stand up hardly and
[36:28] and and this is this is a beautiful
[36:30] thing because you have to understand
[36:32] brother brandham didn't go to medical
[36:35] school and a lot of doctors may not know
[36:37] how to explain this come on brother but
[36:40] he had a Divine gift of healing and a
[36:42] knowledge given from God to be able to
[36:44] see these things and come and explain
[36:46] them to us so that when we go to the
[36:48] doctors and we're not feeling well we
[36:50] don't get scared oh doctor it doesn't
[36:52] look like you're getting any better but
[36:54] we have doctor Jesus that says just hold
[36:56] on hold on the healing is coming all
[37:00] right and so it read as we continue it
[37:03] says and the person immediately the
[37:04] patient weak in faith there goes that
[37:06] word weak again will say I lost my
[37:09] healing all right why God's not that
[37:13] kind of a father oh man you can't lose
[37:17] your healing Jesus purchased it it's
[37:20] yours when Jesus prayed for Peter said I
[37:23] pray that your faith fail notah
[37:27] right so that's something and and I and
[37:30] I love it because that was Jesus Jesus
[37:33] was a representation of what we should
[37:34] be and he realized Jesus realized he was
[37:38] strong in faith and he looked at Peter
[37:39] and he was like I'm praying that your
[37:41] faith doesn't fail and what was told to
[37:43] Peter was when you receive when you get
[37:46] converted go and strengthen your
[37:47] brothers so we all should be at a point
[37:50] where we want to see where um cuz we
[37:52] know that people's Faith Can waver and
[37:54] can weaken and don't be ashamed of as uh
[37:58] uh when you're in that kind of a
[37:59] situation don't be ashamed to not want
[38:01] to go to brother and say hey I'm just
[38:02] having a moment of weakness don't try to
[38:04] fight it all on your own go to someone
[38:06] that can pray for you just like Jesus
[38:08] prayed for Peter right and we know that
[38:11] um um by faith we know that um I can't
[38:15] remember can't remember what sister it
[38:16] was but she said I know Jesus that
[38:18] whatever you ask of God God will do it
[38:21] but now we're the Jesus of today and
[38:23] people that are in Weak of Faith should
[38:24] be able to come to us and say hey I'm
[38:26] going through this right now but I know
[38:27] you're a real Christian I know that when
[38:30] you get on your knees and when you pray
[38:31] God's going to do something right we
[38:35] should have the exact same testimony as
[38:37] that says I pray that your faith not
[38:40] fail not his morals CU they did and it's
[38:43] important to understand that is because
[38:44] the currency in the church is not morals
[38:47] or righteousness the currency to receive
[38:49] things from God is faith faith alone
[38:52] that's why the prophet said you know you
[38:54] would have people that been going to
[38:56] church for years just righteous living
[38:58] they come up to the prayer line and
[39:00] can't even get can't even get healing
[39:01] for a toothache but you'll have a
[39:03] prostitute or a druger will come right
[39:05] up no morals at all but believe what
[39:08] they see and leave back uh healed right
[39:11] and it's also it's just to show that
[39:13] it's not it's your uh your faith we want
[39:17] to live a righteous life right we do
[39:18] want to live a righteous life and God
[39:20] requires it but the element of faith is
[39:23] a little bit separate right uh in order
[39:25] for us to uh receive from God right so
[39:28] we're going to continue this now now
[39:30] when you go now let me show you what
[39:32] takes place excuse me for saying let me
[39:34] show you we're going to get little
[39:35] details in this I didn't mean that I
[39:37] don't mean that I could show you nothing
[39:39] but I tell you the best of my knowledge
[39:41] what I see in the realm of it so this
[39:43] Prophet is looking in the realm he's
[39:45] looking beyond the realm of your
[39:47] sickness and he's able to see these
[39:49] things that doctors can't see that me
[39:51] and you cannot see and me and can
[39:54] identify them and it's and it's not F
[39:57] it's not for you to worship a man but
[39:58] it's for you to appreciate the gift God
[40:01] gave him so that you could have faith in
[40:04] your healing that you could understand
[40:06] these things and understand and know
[40:08] that okay even though I might feel bad
[40:10] you know so and so prayed for me but I
[40:12] but I but I still feel bad that doesn't
[40:14] mean that you're not
[40:15] healed that doesn't mean that you're not
[40:18] healed right right he says that when
[40:22] that cancer goes out when it's cast out
[40:23] you see the very evidence of everything
[40:25] that was of the Son of God and his and
[40:27] the leading of his people working and
[40:28] showing his signs and miracle and that
[40:30] demon is pronounced gone and you feel as
[40:31] gone and then in 2 or 3 days you start
[40:34] doubting again the very faith that taken
[40:37] it out unbelief will bring it back again
[40:40] wow right so it is true that you can
[40:43] receive your healing from God right but
[40:46] as brother Jack had preached if you want
[40:48] to keep your healing there's where
[40:50] righteousness comes in when you live
[40:52] righteous to God it shows that you
[40:54] believe God and when you keep believing
[40:57] God you keep that faith in order for you
[40:59] to always be healed all right praise God
[41:04] so um so what exactly are the gifts of
[41:08] healing now that we kind of understand
[41:09] what healing is and we need to
[41:11] understand exactly what these gifts are
[41:13] so I want everybody in here to raise
[41:14] your hand everybody raise your hand and
[41:16] say I'm Healed I'm heal he say I healed
[41:20] I'm Healed say I'm Healed I'm healed
[41:22] amen see your healing was already
[41:24] purchased 2,000 years ago praise God
[41:27] amen you're already healed Glory it's
[41:30] not some it's not some great gift it's
[41:32] not some great person it's not some uh
[41:35] uh necessarily the hands and all these
[41:37] things you were already healed 2,000
[41:39] years ago when Christ hung his head on
[41:41] the cross it was a finished work all
[41:44] right it was a finished finished work
[41:48] right so all all the gift of healings or
[41:50] these gifts of healing all they come to
[41:52] do is to stimulate your inner man to say
[41:55] I am healed and then when the Inner Man
[41:57] says I am healed it's over there's not
[41:59] enough devils in Hell there's not enough
[42:02] doubt there's not enough uh uh issues
[42:05] not I mean the doctor could explain your
[42:07] symptoms away he could give you back a
[42:09] report but once you know that inner man
[42:11] has said amen to the word of God God
[42:13] will bring it to
[42:15] pass amen amen no it's it's not someone
[42:19] that's touching you with hands but it's
[42:21] your faith that's doing it all right
[42:24] it's your faith that's doing the work so
[42:26] we're going to turn to the message why
[42:28] I'm praying for the sick uh preaching 54
[42:31] 0314 wow and we'll start at um paragraph
[42:37] 28 and it reads here I've been
[42:40] interviewed at Mayo brothers twice so
[42:42] they say we don't profess to be healers
[42:44] Reverend Brandon we only profess to
[42:46] assist nature there's only one Healer
[42:49] that's God right God is the only here
[42:52] and that's correct no Minister can heal
[42:54] you no there's people who claim to have
[42:56] gifts of healing Gifts of healing don't
[42:58] mean you heal people it only means you
[43:00] have the faith in the word right you
[43:03] only have faith in the word and we're
[43:04] going to go drop down to 32 and he says
[43:07] here God works in many different ways to
[43:10] heal the sick it's it's important to
[43:13] understand this because God has a
[43:14] particular way of doing things and you
[43:17] have to get in channel into that in
[43:18] order to receive from God cuz God's not
[43:20] a liar if God says you're healed you're
[43:22] healed am now however that happens
[43:25] that's on him right but God is not a
[43:28] liar all right so God works in many
[43:31] different ways to heal the sick
[43:32] sometimes preaching the word sometime
[43:35] amen sometime a neighbor sitting by you
[43:38] he just lay his hands over you feel like
[43:41] he should do so God always do that what
[43:44] whatever a born again child of God feels
[43:47] to pray for the sick that's the Holy
[43:49] Spirit moving in you to do so no matter
[43:52] who's going to pray for the person you
[43:54] go ahead and pray for them and that's
[43:56] important no matter who's going to pray
[43:59] for the person you go ahead and pray for
[44:02] them
[44:05] anyhow
[44:07] amen oh yeah um my God and this is
[44:12] actually um just to kind of paraphrase
[44:14] it I want to take too much time but this
[44:16] is actually to paraphrase because
[44:17] brother Jack brought this story up of a
[44:20] woman that was wanting to get some
[44:23] healing for her baby and this one lady
[44:25] just felt she's like man I just feeling
[44:26] my conscious like God wants me to pray
[44:29] for this child right so I just want to
[44:31] say a prayer for that
[44:34] child and the funny one of the funny
[44:36] things that I find about it is the lady
[44:38] that had her child pray for and this is
[44:40] why we need the knowledge of God to come
[44:42] in and show us how God operates because
[44:45] the funny thing is she still went up to
[44:46] the prayer line right that's why Paul
[44:49] said I don't want you to be ignorant of
[44:51] the spiritual gifts because when she
[44:53] went up to the prayer line there's
[44:55] nothing the prophet could do he didn't
[44:57] say a prayer he didn't he there was no
[44:59] prayer he said he said he just he just
[45:00] looked at a child he said hold on a
[45:02] second your child's already healed
[45:04] that's right right you know so oh so the
[45:07] moment that that lady that sister had
[45:10] submitted herself to the Holy Spirit
[45:11] touched a child the work was already
[45:13] done Amen in the meeting of the Prophet
[45:16] that's right so like I said we
[45:18] appreciate the Great Men of God right
[45:21] right but the gifts are in the church
[45:23] operating amen whether there's a prophet
[45:26] or no Prophet the gift of healing is
[45:28] still there for us to use it's the same
[45:31] Holy Spirit
[45:33] glory amen so we have to um so we have
[45:38] to let people know how these things work
[45:40] or else people get frustrated and
[45:43] there's where because you don't lose
[45:44] your faith right you don't lose your
[45:46] healing you don't lose your faith but
[45:47] you can weaken your faith your faith can
[45:49] be weakened by not understanding how God
[45:52] is doing things so God's got to kind
[45:54] kind of come and give a word to
[45:56] encourage you doing that to know that uh
[45:58] uh you still uh um have your healing
[46:01] right and it's important if uh god um
[46:04] gives you the gift of healing that
[46:07] you're using it for his glory and we're
[46:09] going to turn to uh the message s we
[46:12] would see Jesus preached in 61
[46:15] 0208 and this is why I said in the
[46:17] beginning of the sermon uh gifts are not
[46:20] for personal gain and you have to be
[46:22] careful about these things uh and a lot
[46:24] of these things because you're born in
[46:26] the message you are receive a lot of
[46:27] light but you may be able to tell these
[46:29] things to help other people out that are
[46:31] in certain situations um and it reads
[46:34] just like what Charley Fuller said down
[46:36] here one time brother Fuller he said I
[46:38] believe in these gifts and I believe in
[46:40] these great gifts of healing too but
[46:42] said they're Gifts of healing but God is
[46:44] going to make them answer at the
[46:46] Judgment bar for commercializing it wow
[46:50] and I believe so he's right there yes
[46:53] sir don't commercialize God he can't be
[46:55] commercialized but God will make you pay
[46:57] for what you're doing the way that you
[47:00] use it so you know a lot of times we
[47:02] we'll laugh at you know people or not
[47:05] laugh but we may poke fun of people you
[47:07] know to tell evangelist that they say
[47:09] you know give me $500 to seed your
[47:11] blessing or give me $1,000 for your
[47:14] healing uh you know if no one's nobody's
[47:17] going to go to a buffet where there's no
[47:18] food right so these people are actually
[47:21] doing the work of God right these people
[47:23] are getting healed but the problem is
[47:25] they're doing it from a place
[47:27] like the people are already beat up
[47:29] people are already sick the people are
[47:31] already going through and now they're
[47:33] using their gift in order to take
[47:35] advantage of these people in order to
[47:37] take their resources but the problem is
[47:40] uh Christ already paid for the healing
[47:42] it's already been paid right so it's a h
[47:45] h it's a um it's a a mockery to the
[47:48] gospel
[47:49] right um so now um as um we'll get ready
[47:54] to close in a in a few so we'll we'll
[47:57] touch on these Miracles real quick so
[47:58] now Miracles are just are are just that
[48:01] right so we've got the gifts of healing
[48:02] Miracles are just that they happen
[48:04] instantly it's a Divine Move of God God
[48:07] comes right on the scene and changes
[48:08] things around it's done in a way where
[48:10] it's you just can't explain it doctors
[48:12] can't explain it no one can explain it
[48:14] God just comes down on the side and that
[48:16] process of you having a wait fore
[48:17] healing God bypasses all of that and
[48:19] just brings you uh uh up into a place of
[48:22] restoration just like that and you'll
[48:24] notice um I don't know if you would call
[48:27] us a miracle or not but a lot of times
[48:28] when you were saved there were some
[48:30] things you just stopped you just quit
[48:31] right there there are some things when
[48:33] you got saved uh the Holy Spirit came
[48:35] into your life it was over drinking
[48:37] smoking all that you just stop all that
[48:40] while there are other things where God
[48:41] kind of got to help you to kind of get
[48:43] healing from that thing and we and we
[48:45] thank God for the patience and healing
[48:47] to know it's still a finished work but
[48:49] some things you kind of got to go
[48:51] through because a lot of times people
[48:52] will struggle with stuff and they'll
[48:53] just think like man I'm just not a
[48:55] Christian it's like no you got to get
[48:57] your healing and you got to let it let
[48:59] it let God do it the way that he wants
[49:01] to do it right let the Lord do it the
[49:04] way he wants to do it the but the
[49:05] biggest thing is in your heart you have
[49:08] to have a desire not to do it that's the
[49:10] key we don't we don't want the desire to
[49:12] do these things and that's the key thing
[49:15] and when God sees that God can work with
[49:17] you all
[49:19] right so it's important how uh God to
[49:23] understand the mind of God how it gets
[49:24] operate uh because
[49:27] another another important thing that you
[49:28] got to remember with faith is you also
[49:30] have hope right now you can have the
[49:33] faith to receive Miracles but you can
[49:36] also have hope for miracles as well and
[49:38] those are two different things you can
[49:40] hope for a miracle but hoping doesn't
[49:42] promise you you get a miracle you don't
[49:44] hope for healing God paid for that you
[49:46] already healed you don't have to hope oh
[49:48] well I wonder if I'll get healed or not
[49:49] or I wonder if God's going to help me
[49:51] not no hope is not applied for healing
[49:53] your faith is automatically attached to
[49:55] Healing God has already healed you it's
[49:57] a done work now for a miracle that's
[50:00] something that you can hope for God can
[50:02] give you the faith for you can also hope
[50:04] for it because the Bible says that there
[50:06] are workers working of Miracles that are
[50:09] in the church right so we're going to
[50:12] read the message experiences um 471
[50:16] 1207 and start at paragraph
[50:22] 22 um let me see
[50:26] no we're going to actually start at uh
[50:28] paragraph 23 if you can pull it up but
[50:29] I'll start reading and it says here a
[50:33] little boy he was so pathetic the little
[50:35] fell come by and I might just tell this
[50:37] it's hanging there in the auditorium now
[50:39] a little boy with braces over his legs
[50:41] he come through the he come through the
[50:42] polo he said brother brandom he said
[50:44] will you say the prayer for me I said
[50:46] yes and his mother was there and I and
[50:48] and I said she said if you'll just say
[50:51] the prayer for him brother brandom and I
[50:53] said all right sister and I said now
[50:55] you're not she said I do not desire a
[50:59] miracle right I do not desire a miracle
[51:02] she said I just desire you to say the
[51:04] prayer and I had the prayer for the
[51:06] little boy just a moment and laid hands
[51:08] upon him and brother uh brother sister
[51:10] two nights after that the little boy was
[51:12] standing at the door the entrance where
[51:14] I come in his braces hanging on his back
[51:16] he was standing there see the Simplicity
[51:19] the uh uh humbleness of the mother said
[51:22] no brother brandom I can believe God I
[51:25] don't have to see any outstanding
[51:26] Miracle said I can believe God and I
[51:29] love that about the woman because it
[51:30] shows us Gentiles we're not gift Seekers
[51:34] and that's where Pentecost gets it wrong
[51:35] they're always looking for gifts they're
[51:37] always looking for a miracle they're
[51:38] always looking for a blast blessing but
[51:40] as but as Gentile full word bride Lord
[51:44] however you want to do it Lord it may
[51:46] not be a miracle I may have to sit here
[51:48] and suffer my bed for seven days but
[51:50] Lord I still believe you are a Healer
[51:53] Hallelujah
[51:54] right that's the thing uh um that we
[51:56] that we love about uh being Gentiles now
[51:59] God but God still uses Miracles now and
[52:01] we're going to turn to the Great
[52:03] Commission
[52:04] um uh message Great Commission and read
[52:08] chapter 13 so I kind of wind this
[52:12] up and it reads here it says I have seen
[52:15] prayer perform Miracles yes in this last
[52:18] day in this Modern Age that we're living
[52:20] in I've seen more miracles that Jesus
[52:22] Christ did in my meetings than I've read
[52:24] in this entire book so the miracle the
[52:26] working of Miracles are still in the
[52:29] church so it's the workers of Miracles
[52:32] it's the gifts of healing all of these
[52:34] things are are inside of the church and
[52:37] just to kind of add an extension because
[52:38] these are the these are the spiritual
[52:40] gifts but healing can come through the
[52:42] song leader if brother Solomon is
[52:44] inspired to sing a particular song right
[52:47] A lot of times we're always focusing on
[52:49] the message like what is the what what
[52:50] is what is so and so going to preach
[52:52] what is so and so going to say but God
[52:53] may give you healing right through that
[52:55] song service it'll be just a simple song
[52:58] it'll be just one line right but if it
[53:00] speaks to your heart for your situation
[53:02] is God trying to use a gift to reach to
[53:04] you right um I believe one of the uh one
[53:08] of I believe um another gift of healing
[53:10] uh I believe mothers are are like
[53:12] healers in the home right mothers have
[53:14] uh healing gifts in the home I remember
[53:16] one time I don't know if I had a cold or
[53:18] was a flu in Georgia but I just felt
[53:20] horrible and I was just on my bed but my
[53:23] mom came into the room and got in a
[53:25] rocking chair right by my bed and she
[53:27] started just patting my forehead and I
[53:29] wasn't I wasn't healed instantly but you
[53:32] just felt better because she was right
[53:33] there and that's what a gift of healing
[53:35] does you may not get an instant healing
[53:38] it may not happen instantly you still
[53:40] may be suffering but at least you know
[53:42] something's there that's still kind of
[53:44] holding you right and so that's how
[53:46] these gifts are supposed to be used in
[53:48] the church and God has God has made you
[53:52] and created you in a way to be able to
[53:54] have a particular gift and in order to
[53:56] bless somebody else so that's why we
[53:59] have to get ourselves out the way that's
[54:01] why uh one of the most important things
[54:02] that I mentioned in the last message is
[54:05] you got to have love right um one of the
[54:08] things that I've noticed is that people
[54:09] that have gifts and I talked about it
[54:11] people always want to use gifts but you
[54:14] can use gifts without love you can use
[54:17] gifts without love but the problem of it
[54:20] is sometimes God wants to use love
[54:22] without a gift right um I know I'm the
[54:26] type of person you know I like to have a
[54:28] lot of knowledge and stuff I believe God
[54:29] has blessed me and sometimes you know
[54:32] I'll be in a position where I'm trying
[54:33] to figure my way out of a situation that
[54:35] I'm dealing with and it's like no no no
[54:38] you need to put that to the side and
[54:40] just bear with these people and really
[54:42] show them love and that's why Paul came
[54:45] in there uh and talked about how though
[54:47] you have uh all know all Mysteries
[54:50] though you have knowledge you have faith
[54:52] to move mountains right you have all
[54:54] these gifts you can prophesy I mean you
[54:56] come in church and you prophesy
[54:57] blessings for everyone every single week
[54:59] but if you don't have any love right it
[55:02] doesn't mean anything so that's what we
[55:04] want to uh pray for church and closing
[55:06] we want to pray that God give us more
[55:08] love God give us more understanding for
[55:11] how you do things God help us to
[55:13] understand where the gifts are located
[55:15] and I mentioned this before we don't we
[55:18] don't we don't want people streaming we
[55:19] need people in the church we need the
[55:22] gifts all in the church so we can
[55:23] identify and know and use them so that
[55:25] when we're going through our problems we
[55:27] can call on God and God can be the same
[55:30] yesterday today and forever amen amen so
[55:34] we'll go close in a word of
[55:36] prayer Lord Jesus Christ Lord You've
[55:39] you've spoken your word Lord God lord we
[55:42] know that that all knowledge and all
[55:44] wisdom and all understanding it comes
[55:46] from you oh Lord God and it's a
[55:48] revelation and a gift oh Lord Jesus
[55:50] Christ that you've given us oh Lord God
[55:53] there are people oh Lord God that are
[55:54] struggling for healing there are people
[55:56] in the hospital right now that don't
[55:57] know if they're going to make it or not
[55:59] not knowing that you died 2,000 years
[56:01] ago and the healing is already done they
[56:04] just need the faith to be able to anchor
[56:06] on to it but you chose us oh Lord Jesus
[56:08] Christ you chose us to be able to
[56:11] receive and and to get from you oh Lord
[56:13] God lord sometimes we do admit that our
[56:16] faith may be weak oh Lord Jesus Christ
[56:18] but Lord help us to recognize what these
[56:20] gifts of Faith are the gifts of Miracles
[56:23] the gifts of healing oh Lord God lord we
[56:25] may not be strong enough to uh um to
[56:28] have the faith to pray for our wayward
[56:30] Sons and Daughters oh Lord God but Lord
[56:32] we can hold our hand we can touch and
[56:34] agree with someone in a church that may
[56:36] have gone through the same thing and
[56:38] they've got the faith to believe it oh
[56:40] Lord help us to identify those
[56:41] individuals oh Lord that we can touch
[56:43] and agree that you can do the same thing
[56:45] if you did it for them you can do it for
[56:47] us as well Lord God oh Lord just restore
[56:50] the gifts in the church oh Lord God let
[56:52] love be the focal point oh Lord Jesus
[56:54] Christ and bless us oh Lord in the
[56:56] precious name of Jesus Christ
[57:09] amen praise the
[57:12] lord well we thank the Lord for the word
[57:16] um um
[57:17] tonight um so much brother Quinton was
[57:20] sharing there that um uh man I could
[57:24] take off and preach a whole another
[57:25] sermon
[57:27] uh but I I did want to say this one of
[57:29] the things I just felt the Holy Spirit
[57:31] was emphasizing through him is that we
[57:34] have this ability as
[57:36] gifts um and identifying and recognizing
[57:40] uh gifts letting the Holy Ghost kind of
[57:42] do that not um not us doing that
[57:46] ourselves but but it's God has a way and
[57:49] I I put it this way God has given each
[57:51] one of us already something but it's us
[57:54] yielding and letting him just get the
[57:55] glory out of it that but um the the
[57:58] thing of it is he says being able to go
[58:00] to a brother that got this gift of faith
[58:02] like brother I just I know I got faith
[58:06] uh but I just need just a little little
[58:09] extra help and being able to you know
[58:10] get somebody can reach a little higher
[58:12] than you can um the the thing of it is
[58:15] is it goes right back to brother
[58:17] McBride's
[58:21] sermon that we are all
[58:24] connected right and and see how you know
[58:28] what the devil wants to do is bring
[58:30] little petty
[58:33] things into the church to keep the
[58:36] people
[58:37] disconnected and I mean and that brother
[58:39] the sister that you're getting
[58:40] disconnected from is the one that got
[58:42] the gift that you need but the enemy's
[58:46] job right is to disconnect us we got to
[58:50] fight the devil every little thing that
[58:53] the devil's trying to do we got to fight
[58:55] that I heard while I was away I heard
[58:58] brother Troy make a statement um I don't
[59:01] do this person that's the devil that's
[59:04] trying to come in amongst the people no
[59:07] we do
[59:08] everybody right that's my brother that's
[59:11] my sister and brother brandom said we
[59:13] might not hang like that but still we
[59:15] Brothers and Sisters in Christ right but
[59:18] but but we got to understand that uh uh
[59:21] if if we lose the
[59:23] connection right that's that's what's
[59:25] the Restorations all about to bring that
[59:27] connection back in place because these
[59:29] gifts operate accordingly you know I
[59:32] tell you I was just I'm I'm sitting
[59:35] there and and you know the other thing
[59:36] I'll tell you about the gift of um um of
[59:39] of healing and a gift of miracle and it
[59:42] say the Bible say gifts gifts but um you
[59:46] know uh the I remember years ago um
[59:49] brother colan had preached the sermon he
[59:51] said and there was there's what we call
[59:53] instant Miracles and then there's also
[59:56] span of time Miracles they're both
[1:00:00] Miracles but just some happen like we
[1:00:03] say a word of prayer right now and it's
[1:00:05] done but then there's others that we say
[1:00:07] a prayer right now you still go home
[1:00:09] with symptoms amen but you yet believe
[1:00:12] God that he has done uh what he promised
[1:00:14] that he was going to do and uh you know
[1:00:17] so you know he he you all know the story
[1:00:20] brother brandom told the ladies that
[1:00:22] come into the prayer line and they were
[1:00:23] prayed for and they went home
[1:00:26] and uh Weeks
[1:00:28] Later weeks later uh just said that um
[1:00:34] the
[1:00:35] angel came through the
[1:00:40] neighborhood to
[1:00:43] ensure amen that they receive what they
[1:00:45] were prayed for and the lady didn't know
[1:00:48] why but she start feeling a little funny
[1:00:50] where she used to not be be able to eat
[1:00:52] she said I just feel I feel led to eat
[1:00:59] and she got some of the worst stuff that
[1:01:01] she knew would upset her stomach and she
[1:01:04] start eating and didn't feel nothing
[1:01:07] eating a little bit more didn't feel
[1:01:08] nothing next thing you know she's praise
[1:01:10] God I'm I've been healed and and and
[1:01:13] that was a span of time right so so so
[1:01:17] when she um you know she said I'm going
[1:01:19] up to tell my my neighbor what just
[1:01:21] happened to me now why is she going to
[1:01:22] say that in order to encourage that
[1:01:25] other lady Faith but when she got there
[1:01:29] there was a Revival already happening in
[1:01:31] the house hallu and and and both of them
[1:01:34] have been healed in the same
[1:01:36] neighborhood glory to God brother sister
[1:01:39] why can't all of us get our healing all
[1:01:42] of us get our delivering if if the
[1:01:44] Angels passing by then do not pass me by
[1:01:54] [Music]
[1:01:56] but this is this is what we need we
[1:01:58] realize we connected like that and we
[1:02:00] got to fight that
[1:02:02] devil every little thing he try to no no
[1:02:05] no that ain't you know that ain't even
[1:02:08] Christian right that a even Christian
[1:02:11] you got to fight that amen that's right
[1:02:14] praise God now you know that sister
[1:02:17] calling you and you won't pick up the
[1:02:21] phone I'm going just let it go to
[1:02:24] voicemail you ain't even doing nothing

[1:03:09] your faith but you can weaken your
[1:03:12] faith and um I just quickly want to say
[1:03:16] this brother brandham told us that
[1:03:19] um when
[1:03:21] we limit
[1:03:23] God to doing things
[1:03:27] uh only in one
[1:03:29] way actually you paralyze your
[1:03:33] faith and this is why you know if you
[1:03:36] expecting a check in the mail because
[1:03:37] maybe you got one before you got a
[1:03:40] unexpected check in the mail and now the
[1:03:43] way that you look for God to do things
[1:03:45] is always get an unexpected check in the
[1:03:47] mail you limit God and you weaken your
[1:03:52] faith now I'mma say something here I'mma

[1:07:12] Tabernacle and uh we got a combined
[1:07:14] service there on June 30th at 6:30 p.m.
[1:07:17] and that's going to again be at bride of
[1:07:19] Christ Tabernacle um and trusting that
[1:07:23] we'll uh some of us will be able to 10
[1:07:27] amen just representing um a spirit and
[1:07:30] Truth
[1:07:31] Tabernacle um I know there was a number
[1:07:34] of us that made it last week to Sister
[1:07:37] Smith's uh homegoing service and we
[1:07:39] thank you for for going and uh just
[1:07:42] representing the church and I heard it
[1:07:45] was a a wonderful sendoff uh for our
[1:07:48] precious sister and as I said before
[1:07:51] this is like the second year in a row I
[1:07:52] think that they've had a major your
[1:07:56] person in the church to pass right
[1:07:58] before meetings and uh so the church is
[1:08:02] really going through and I think anytime
[1:08:04] they can see uh just a friendly face
[1:08:06] from somewhere else it just really
[1:08:08] encourages them especially during this
[1:08:10] time so this this weekend they have
[1:08:12] their camp meeting their annual camp
[1:08:14] camp meeting brother isah Brooks will be
[1:08:15] preaching and that's Friday June 21st at
[1:08:19] 7 p.m. and then Saturday uh June 22nd at
[1:08:22] 5:00 p.m. and then Sunday uh June 23rd
[1:08:25] third uh they'll be having their meeting
[1:08:27] so keep uh keep those in mind and if if
[1:08:30] any are able to make it to one uh or two
[1:08:32] of the services I think that would be
[1:08:35] wonderful um I know I'll be there Friday
[1:08:38] I'm not certain right now about Saturday
[1:08:41] just yet uh but I'll certainly be there
[1:08:44] Friday but if if others are able to do
[1:08:46] it then I think it'll be a blessing
[1:08:48] don't forget the uh message believer's
[1:08:50] youth banquet uh hosted by sat that's
[1:08:53] going to be Friday August 23rd If you

[1:11:44] 33422 all right
[1:11:47] um I think that's all I need to mention
[1:11:52] any testimonies or prayer requests amen
[1:11:55] I got one here I got one there any the
[1:11:59] other I got one there praise the Lord
[1:12:02] okay let's start here brother H praise
[1:12:06] the
[1:12:09] Lord God bless you
[1:12:11] all um I think I maybe like two minutes
[1:12:15] and I'll share a small
[1:12:17] testimony and I promise you that I I did
[1:12:21] not plan to share this testimony but I I
[1:12:24] believe that God god um when there's a
[1:12:26] desire in somebody's heart he'll make a
[1:12:29] way and
[1:12:32] um lately I've been like really busy
[1:12:35] back
[1:12:36] there with like my kid you know it's
[1:12:39] different when you come to church with
[1:12:41] your kid then when you don't you know I
[1:12:43] like church I like to be all all in the
[1:12:45] message but it's it's kind of hard so I
[1:12:47] I know that on the way here God provided
[1:12:50] for for little joose Not to Come As much
[1:12:53] as I tried for him to come
[1:12:55] and provideed Abby to drive so on the
[1:12:58] way to church I I was got to read a word
[1:13:01] you know and I was telling the girls
[1:13:02] that sometimes you know if you have a
[1:13:05] desire in your heart and you set
[1:13:08] yourself up you can actually like you
[1:13:11] know change the service you know so I
[1:13:13] was reading in Matthew 12 and it kind of
[1:13:16] just connects because it was talking
[1:13:18] about when Jesus was doing some stuff on
[1:13:20] the Sabbath and the the Pharisees were
[1:13:23] telling him some stuff and he tried to
[1:13:26] like run away and and it said that the a
[1:13:29] multitude took off with him and and it
[1:13:32] said that they were all healed and and I
[1:13:34] was telling the girls I was like
[1:13:35] sometimes you got to look a little more
[1:13:37] and it says they were all healed so like
[1:13:41] think about it like all they were all
[1:13:44] healed it doesn't say who or what but
[1:13:47] that's not my testimony I was just
[1:13:48] wanted to say that because then it just
[1:13:50] kind of goes into this and then as soon
[1:13:52] as he started um talking I think he went
[1:13:55] to the second quote like something just
[1:13:57] came over me real quick it was like like
[1:14:00] right there like you sharing this
[1:14:02] testimony right now you know and and I
[1:14:05] promise you I didn't didn't I mean I I
[1:14:07] like sharing testimonies I can't because
[1:14:08] I'm back there and and my mind is not
[1:14:11] anytime I've shared testimony like the
[1:14:12] Lord literally has kind of like said all
[1:14:15] right you go ahead and share it but um
[1:14:17] talking about faith and talking about
[1:14:21] healing um so about a month ago
[1:14:25] maybe maybe a month and a
[1:14:27] half you guys know what happened to
[1:14:29] Joseph that all the time you
[1:14:31] know so we were all together the whole
[1:14:35] day and on on the way
[1:14:38] back we get back to the house and
[1:14:42] um and um the girls were wi us and
[1:14:45] sister Armon was at the house we were
[1:14:47] like riding their bikes or something
[1:14:48] that day and um and and and we were
[1:14:52] going to go somewhere to feed the
[1:14:53] animals or something like that and we
[1:14:55] left the house and Joseph stayed in the
[1:14:57] house and right after we left Mandy
[1:15:00] called me and she's like man Joseph like
[1:15:03] he's he's in the floor right now like he
[1:15:05] said his head his head is pounding I
[1:15:06] mean exactly exactly the same way before
[1:15:09] he's gagging he he says he can't he
[1:15:12] feels like his head is going to explode
[1:15:14] and I was like oh really like are you

[1:15:24] get back home
[1:15:25] I'm going to take off we're going to go
[1:15:26] to the hospital you know so I believe
[1:15:30] that she prayed for him when she was at
[1:15:32] the house and when we got back to the
[1:15:33] house he was in the floor in the
[1:15:34] bathroom like he's like I can't I can't
[1:15:37] do this my head is going to blow up you
[1:15:40] know so at that moment you
[1:15:43] know um I I I believe that my faith
[1:15:46] kicked you know I was like I don't care
[1:15:48] if your head falling off like there's
[1:15:50] nothing wrong with you right now bro

[1:15:54] and they're going to tell us that
[1:15:56] there's nothing wrong with you and we're
[1:15:57] coming right back here and and I told
[1:15:59] Harmony and Abby and Linda I say right
[1:16:03] now we're all going to stay here and I
[1:16:05] talked to them about a couple scriptures
[1:16:07] and I said the Bible says where two or
[1:16:09] three are gathered in the name of Jesus
[1:16:12] that that that he'll be in the midst of
[1:16:15] that and he said where two or three two
[1:16:18] two touching agreeance that he will do
[1:16:21] just that so we're going to pray right
[1:16:23] now we set him right there and we all
[1:16:25] prayed like all together and I took off
[1:16:27] to the hospital and and and and war
[1:16:30] strategies you preach war strategies so
[1:16:32] I got a couple of those you know and I
[1:16:35] remember even brother Quin Junior one
[1:16:38] time he was preaching and he said that
[1:16:41] when something happens and the way that
[1:16:44] you act towards when that happen that
[1:16:46] that strengthens your faith and that all
[1:16:48] the time when that happened like I don't
[1:16:50] know if I ever shared the full testimony
[1:16:52] but we were like I I it doesn't matter
[1:16:55] what's going on right now I told Joseph
[1:16:57] I said Joseph they right now they said
[1:16:59] that you have three things in your head
[1:17:02] but there's nothing in your head the
[1:17:03] Lord already told me on Thursday and I
[1:17:05] tried calling you and I told you that
[1:17:07] the Lord said that there's nothing wrong
[1:17:09] with you you just have to go through
[1:17:11] this so that has strengthened my faith
[1:17:13] already so war strategies I get in the
[1:17:15] truck I say Mandy prayed we already

[1:37:47] agree with brother Quinton uh the gifts
[1:37:50] is hard to depend on a gift over a
[1:37:52] stream uh the gifts have to be in the
[1:37:54] church Lord so we pray that you'd open
[1:37:57] up a door for the people to be able to
[1:37:59] be in fellowship and God May the glory
[1:38:02] of God just continue to be manifested in
