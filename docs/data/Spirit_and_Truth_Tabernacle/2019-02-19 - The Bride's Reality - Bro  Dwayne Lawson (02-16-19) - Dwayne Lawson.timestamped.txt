[58:20] glory a man so many little nuggets that

[58:34] previous job a man was you know let's
[58:39] just say a nice-size church and now
[58:42] brother Nathan made a comer says I'd
[58:44] rather be in this old maker Church
[58:48] than be in any megachurch I say oh yeah
[58:53] the love play on words there right old
[58:55] make up rather than Mecca Omega you
[59:00] choose which one you're gonna be in a
[59:03] man so I mean I was just I was just just
[59:06] being filled up over there and I
[59:08] appreciate this how the Lord used them
[59:11] just to speak to our hearts on this
[59:13] morning and I felt like man if it
[59:15] started out like that then what does the
[59:17] Lord haven't stolen for some tonight and
[59:21] I believe that the Lord's gonna use his
[59:23] servant
[59:24] brother Dwayne Lawson a man just
[59:27] administer to our hearts we thank God
[59:29] for him and his wife like I mentioned to
[59:31] you
[59:31] both of these brothers were traveling a
[59:34] man pretty late to get here brother
[59:36] Nathan got in last night him and his
[59:38] wife and his daughter having about
[59:40] flight landed at 11:30 you know here in
[59:42] West Palm and it goes straight to the
[59:44] hotel and gets up this morning and
[59:47] delivers a wonderful sermon and I'm
[59:49] brother brother Dwayne he's just getting
[59:51] back from India preached at home on
[59:56] Thursday night got up to catch a flight
[59:59] on Friday morning and they brought him
[1:00:01] from Ohio to Tampa and then they drove
[1:00:04] three and a half hours from Tampa to get
[1:00:06] here to West Palm Beach so that's a
[1:00:08] that's a big load and what I find is
[1:00:10] that you know typically the ministers
[1:00:12] the guest ministers they they go through
[1:00:14] the hardest time just to get to where
[1:00:16] they're trying to go to that was just
[1:00:18] give them the hardest time but you know
[1:00:19] what that's that's when we see God's
[1:00:21] greatest glory amen his gifts are used a
[1:00:23] man when they have to depend on
[1:00:25] praise the Lord so we thank God for
[1:00:27] these brothers that impressed Amen to
[1:00:29] make it here and tonight we're going to
[1:00:31] welcome a man I precious brother Dewayne
[1:00:33] Lawson to the pulpit a man would just we
[1:00:39] trusted the Lord we use him in whatever
[1:00:41] way he desires whenever we invite
[1:00:43] ministers to come we want them to take
[1:00:45] their Liberty and men that have freedom
[1:00:47] just to preach what the Lord lays in
[1:00:49] their heart a man we don't we don't put
[1:00:51] any stipulations on that only thing that
[1:00:54] we these meetings are called light to
[1:00:57] fire again and you know there are some
[1:01:00] things that just been in my spirit for a
[1:01:02] little bit and have just been kind of
[1:01:04] writing a little inspiration for about a
[1:01:05] year and there's a quote there in the
[1:01:08] church age book where brother Branham
[1:01:10] just kind of talks about that it talks
[1:01:12] about how the revival starts out in one
[1:01:14] generation and man is just it's I mean
[1:01:19] everybody's so blessed Bobby said but
[1:01:20] the second generation comes along then
[1:01:22] the fire begins to dim down they say the
[1:01:25] third generation he said is just
[1:01:26] immersed in verse then he said in the
[1:01:30] fourth generation which I believe this
[1:01:32] is that fourth generation third or
[1:01:34] fourth generation that's what we're
[1:01:35] looking at right now so in the fourth
[1:01:37] generation he says there's no vestige of
[1:01:39] the original flame and it says that now
[1:01:43] when you look at that word vestige it
[1:01:44] means no trace and this was the only
[1:01:47] generation that I saw where people were
[1:01:50] questioning why we voted the prophet
[1:01:53] they didn't do that in my generation we
[1:01:56] a man we didn't have a problem quoting
[1:01:58] the Prophet right and there was before
[1:02:01] me they didn't have a problem quoting a
[1:02:03] prophet but when it got to the fourth
[1:02:04] generation they had a problem but in the
[1:02:11] quote goes on brother Branham didn't
[1:02:13] stop they say thank God and that's why I
[1:02:16] believe we are we in the dead god season
[1:02:19] then God lights the fire again so that's
[1:02:25] what my expectation is it somebody's
[1:02:28] fire is going to be lit in the fourth
[1:02:31] generation and I'm gonna be right here
[1:02:37] to experience it right along with you
[1:02:39] hey man I'm on the expectation
[1:02:42] so let's stand to our feet hey man
[1:02:44] unless welcome brother the way Lawson to
[1:02:48] the full feet on tonight

[1:06:16] and he said there's power in the hands
[1:06:19] of believers he said that when you got
[1:06:22] born again he said that God took out the
[1:06:25] cosmic light and put in an eternal light
[1:06:28] and that light is inside every believer
[1:06:32] in this building tonight and I and one
[1:06:35] believer who believes that you're the
[1:06:36] most powerful force on the face of the

[1:09:18] and the bride said a man Soviet Lord a
[1:09:25] man and a man we won't - tonight to turn
[1:09:29] in our Bibles say man and to read from
[1:09:32] the word of the Lord and want to read
[1:09:33] from the book of of Corinthians 2nd
[1:09:36] Corinthians chapter 4 and we want to
[1:09:39] read the 18th of verse second
[1:09:41] Corinthians chapter 4 and 18 a man I I
[1:09:46] love this this Bible it is the written
[1:09:50] word of God a man and it's the seeds of
[1:09:54] life in 2nd Corinthians 4 and verse 18
[1:10:00] Paul will say while we look not at the
[1:10:06] things which are seen but at the things
[1:10:09] which are not seen for the things which
[1:10:13] are seen are temporal but the things
[1:10:17] which are not seen are eternal now Paul
[1:10:22] didn't say that we shouldn't look but he
[1:10:24] said that we should look but look to the
[1:10:27] unseen a man and I believe if you're
[1:10:29] going to look to the unseen Amen the
[1:10:32] Bible said in the book of Hebrews the
[1:10:34] eleventh chapter that Moses seemed the
[1:10:37] unseen and I believe it's possible to
[1:10:39] see the unseen let's look at Hebrews the
[1:10:41] eleventh chapter if we can and let's
[1:10:45] read the first verse Hebrews eleven and
[1:10:47] one now faith it is the substance of
[1:10:53] things hoped for it is the evidence of
[1:10:59] things not seen or the proof of the
[1:11:03] unseen Amen the evidence of things not
[1:11:06] seen for by it the elders obtained a
[1:11:10] good report and through faith we
[1:11:12] understand that the worlds were framed
[1:11:14] by the Word of God so that things which
[1:11:17] are seen were made of things which do
[1:11:22] which do appear amen let's read that
[1:11:25] again of things which are seen were not
[1:11:27] made of things which do appear
[1:11:30] a man we asked the Lord to bless his
[1:11:32] word tonight as you may be seated
[1:11:34] amen we want to just take a few minutes
[1:11:39] this evening and speak to you from this
[1:11:42] text of Scripture and I I wonder if I
[1:11:44] take a title tonight I want to speak to
[1:11:45] you about the brides the bride's reality
[1:11:49] amen the bride's reality and I do
[1:11:52] acknowledge that we have a different
[1:11:55] reality than the world that we're living
[1:11:57] in amen but the world that we're living
[1:12:00] in a man is living in a in an imaginary
[1:12:03] realm in a world that they think things
[1:12:06] are real but they're really not real
[1:12:08] because they're soon going to disappear
[1:12:11] a man and we just want to speak to you a
[1:12:20] few minutes here the brides reality's a
[1:12:23] man waiting Jesus 1963 the prophet of
[1:12:27] God said I think he said Christians the
[1:12:31] whole armor of Christianity is faith and
[1:12:33] everything that we have is unseen of
[1:12:38] course you remember Apostle Paul will
[1:12:39] say possessing all having all things but
[1:12:43] possessing possessing all things yet
[1:12:45] having nothing amen so the things that
[1:12:47] you have is actually unseen the only
[1:12:51] things that's real is unseen and
[1:12:54] unexplained the things that can be
[1:12:58] explained are not real they're
[1:13:00] superficial and they die but the things
[1:13:03] that cannot be explained or immortal see
[1:13:05] the whole round now look at the army of
[1:13:07] Christianity love now love and joy and
[1:13:10] faith and long-suffering and patience
[1:13:12] none of these things see you can't see
[1:13:14] them they're unseen but yet we believe
[1:13:17] them amen things that you possess love
[1:13:21] and joy and patience are kind of see you
[1:13:23] can't see them but you have them amen
[1:13:26] and you possess them now do you see God
[1:13:29] is always supernatural amen to identify
[1:13:34] God in his carest expeller and talks
[1:13:36] about how you can watch a bird fly a
[1:13:38] certain way and you can see the bird fly
[1:13:40] and some people say well there goes a
[1:13:41] but there goes the raw but just by the
[1:13:43] way they fly a duck hunters you know and
[1:13:45] they know the difference from a duck
[1:13:46] from from a woodpecker just in the way
[1:13:48] that it flies it has a certain caressed
[1:13:50] ik amen and we know that God has a
[1:13:53] terroristic you can identify him because
[1:13:56] God is a supernatural and God works in
[1:14:00] the supernatural amen I love how
[1:14:03] sometimes you hear things like always
[1:14:05] God is always supernatural amen and as
[1:14:09] long as there is a God there is a
[1:14:12] supernatural amen
[1:14:14] it's Jehovah God the proper to tell us
[1:14:16] in Jehovah Jireh that God's callings are
[1:14:19] supernatural amen God calls you
[1:14:24] supernaturally all the things that God
[1:14:26] has did he calls he calls supernatural
[1:14:29] in the paradox brother Ram says see the
[1:14:31] paradox is the supernatural
[1:14:33] hey man you know what a paradox is a
[1:14:35] paradox is something that is actually
[1:14:37] true amen it's incredible but it is true
[1:14:40] it's incredible to think but it's true
[1:14:43] how Joshua could stop the Sun now that's
[1:14:46] incredible but it is true amen
[1:14:48] Mary can have a baby and never know a
[1:14:50] man that's incredible but it is true
[1:14:52] amen Moses could part the Red Sea it's
[1:14:55] incredible but it's true one man can
[1:14:59] feed five thousand with a couple pieces
[1:15:01] of bread in the fish it's incredible but
[1:15:04] it is true amen and we were to recognize
[1:15:06] that God is the God of the supernatural
[1:15:09] he is a paradox you cannot explain it
[1:15:12] you cannot see it but it's true he meant
[1:15:14] you can understand how God does what he
[1:15:17] does but he does it because that it's
[1:15:19] true amen and we find that there is a
[1:15:21] paradox in God amen and it is a
[1:15:24] supernatural now you got to recognize
[1:15:26] when you come to the Church of the
[1:15:28] Living God and you and you come to hear
[1:15:30] the word of God and you come expecting
[1:15:33] now I believe in expectation say men I
[1:15:36] believe you get what you expect I
[1:15:38] believe that amen I believe that you get
[1:15:41] what you expect from God but look right
[1:15:42] brother ma'am said it like this if you
[1:15:44] come expecting and you'll get something
[1:15:46] from God and he said but now if you come
[1:15:48] looking for something to criticize
[1:15:49] you're gonna get something amen he meant
[1:15:52] because God is gonna give you an
[1:15:54] expectation but if you're coming to
[1:15:57] criticize the devil's gonna meet your
[1:15:59] expectation so so you're always going to
[1:16:01] get your expectation min if you're
[1:16:03] looking for something wrong the devil
[1:16:05] will be sure you find something wrong
[1:16:06] Haven but if you're looking for the
[1:16:08] blessings of God God will be sure that
[1:16:11] you get something from God hey Ben hey
[1:16:13] man I my voice is a little bit weak so
[1:16:16] you keep your monitors and I appreciate
[1:16:17] it amen and we look and see that God is
[1:16:20] the God of the supernatural now when the
[1:16:22] church comes expecting and they begin to
[1:16:25] pull upon the Word of God amen many
[1:16:27] times we misunderstand and we think that
[1:16:29] we're pulling on the man in the pulpit
[1:16:31] he meant but actually you're actually
[1:16:34] pulling on a supernatural God and if a
[1:16:37] man in the pulpit has a gift that God
[1:16:39] gives that gift is supernatural and that
[1:16:42] gift is to get himself out of the way
[1:16:44] that the people can pull is supernatural
[1:16:47] through a natural realm of a natural
[1:16:50] being and here natural words they meant
[1:16:52] but the Prophet said see but it's not me
[1:16:54] you're pulling out it's him you're
[1:16:57] pulling out see your own power of faith
[1:16:59] pulls from the supernatural God the very
[1:17:02] desires of your heart
[1:17:04] amen it's not me you're pulling that
[1:17:07] it's
[1:17:07] you're pulling that and when you begin
[1:17:09] to pull up on the supernatural then the
[1:17:12] words that you're hearing is words that
[1:17:14] God is using a natural man but he's
[1:17:17] speaking words to your life
[1:17:19] you know I think hearing in the message
[1:17:21] the prophet of God will say it like this
[1:17:23] this is not you that you're pulling that
[1:17:24] but it's him now a person has a need a
[1:17:28] church hasn't he and as you come to the
[1:17:31] house of God pulling Amen do you know
[1:17:33] that God will actually cause a man to
[1:17:35] come in the pulpit and preach a certain
[1:17:38] thing because you have a certain need
[1:17:41] then God will make that man preach what
[1:17:44] you have made huh just like a woman
[1:17:47] gonna have a baby here with us when a
[1:17:50] lady's gonna have a baby
[1:17:51] and amen and she wants a different kind
[1:17:54] of food people some of these messages
[1:17:55] from the message are a little bit
[1:17:57] different Haman they're little different
[1:17:59] than denominational food I agree with
[1:18:01] you amen but do you see the reason
[1:18:03] there's a difference amen if you take
[1:18:05] your young life to the to look to the
[1:18:07] doctor and he used to not look she she's
[1:18:09] also said more than ice cream for
[1:18:10] breakfast and she put peanut butter and
[1:18:12] mustard on it there's something wrong
[1:18:14] with her her she's eating odd things to
[1:18:18] what she always eat before the doctor
[1:18:20] can limit it you'll say see there's
[1:18:22] another life on the inside of her amen
[1:18:24] and she's pulling to supply that body
[1:18:27] that's developing on the inside amen and
[1:18:30] you see when you start wanting something
[1:18:32] out of the ordinary you are looking for
[1:18:35] the supernatural you're desiring the
[1:18:37] presence of God amen let a doctor Amen
[1:18:40] tell you what's wrong with you tonight
[1:18:42] amen there's another beam operating on
[1:18:45] the inside of here
[1:18:46] amen there's a body developing bear and
[1:18:48] you're thirsty and you're hungry for the
[1:18:51] supernatural God two feet more than a
[1:18:53] natural body but a supernatural body is
[1:18:57] thirsting and desiring amen prophet of
[1:19:00] God said well amen is a father of course
[1:19:02] as a father
[1:19:03] Amen I'm gonna get what my wife wants
[1:19:05] amen because I want a perfect baby born
[1:19:07] then how much greater is father God amen
[1:19:10] to meet the need of his children amen to
[1:19:14] bring forth a perfect body and a perfect
[1:19:16] Church now amen then God will actually
[1:19:19] cause somebody to come to the pulpit and
[1:19:22] preach the absolute truth amen that's
[1:19:27] what we're hungry for his truth and God
[1:19:29] will make somebody preach the absolute
[1:19:31] truth that's right absolute truth and
[1:19:34] now in the curtain of time but the man
[1:19:36] says it like this
[1:19:37] he said God comes from the midst of his
[1:19:39] people he says and their faith begins to
[1:19:42] draw out supernatural words amen
[1:19:46] supernatural words how many times have
[1:19:48] you ever come to the house of the Lord
[1:19:50] you've been praying and and you've been
[1:19:51] fasting and you made concentrating and
[1:19:54] preparing yourself for the word the Lord
[1:19:56] now now you you got to understand that
[1:19:58] it takes preparation to come to the
[1:20:00] house of the Lord heaven whatever you're
[1:20:03] gonna do you're gonna need some kind of
[1:20:05] preparation Haven and when we come to
[1:20:07] the house of God we didn't come here
[1:20:09] just to have a fight we have prepared
[1:20:11] ourselves to have a victory hey man I
[1:20:13] don't know about y'all but hey man we've
[1:20:15] been over and Afghanistan fighting for
[1:20:17] years amen and ain't nobody winning that
[1:20:19] war it's just on and on and on and on
[1:20:22] and on Vietnam was on and on and on and
[1:20:25] on Oh buddy one that Amen they fought a
[1:20:27] long time but there wasn't any victory
[1:20:29] amen and I think it's time that the
[1:20:32] church quit fighting a many get some
[1:20:34] victory him
[1:20:36] just fighting with a devil don't you
[1:20:38] kill that devil instead of just showing
[1:20:40] up to the house of God and say we'll see
[1:20:43] what happens tonight we meant bring
[1:20:45] ourselves for the house of God ready but
[1:20:47] kill every devil in every enemy of our
[1:20:50] lives until the presence of God can take
[1:20:53] us over in a complete way I'll tell you
[1:20:56] I believe that when the people of God
[1:20:57] come prepared to hear the word of God
[1:20:59] then they're going to draw out
[1:21:01] supernatural words a man asked me one
[1:21:05] time a many Issa brother Lane I hear you
[1:21:07] talk about the Lord Amen brings I cast
[1:21:10] Devils out of people's lives when you
[1:21:12] pray for man things and we've had some
[1:21:14] supernatural happen in that way he said
[1:21:16] this this this a man or a woman always
[1:21:19] had to come through the prayer line to
[1:21:21] get a demon cast off for them I said
[1:21:23] well actually amen the highest order of
[1:21:26] casting out a demon is the preaching of
[1:21:28] the gospel and as the word of God is
[1:21:31] preached it drives spirits away from the
[1:21:33] mind and the heart of God's people
[1:21:35] Amen the Word of God cast out the devil
[1:21:38] Haman amen and then you know sometimes
[1:21:41] Amen you come to the house of the Lord
[1:21:43] preacher don't know you you don't know
[1:21:45] the preacher you don't even know the
[1:21:46] people that sitting around you amen but
[1:21:49] see the Bible said that the Word of God
[1:21:51] it's a discerner of the founding the
[1:21:53] intent of the heart and then the man
[1:21:55] don't know the situation he has no clue
[1:21:57] even what he's talking about at times
[1:22:00] Amen but God will turn that man a
[1:22:02] certain way and he begin to speak right
[1:22:04] to your Lea your heart and your need and
[1:22:07] begin to discern the things that are
[1:22:09] there and you think it's the guy in the
[1:22:11] pulpit but he has no idea what you're
[1:22:13] going through but it's God honoring your
[1:22:16] faith but make a man say something to
[1:22:18] bless your heart I tell you God still
[1:22:20] has supernatural words coming
[1:22:23] naturally they meant speaking to the
[1:22:25] heart in the need of his children amen I
[1:22:28] believe that there is a supernatural
[1:22:30] among us tonight and I believe that God
[1:22:34] a man has an ability to still use his
[1:22:37] word to drive away spirits amen you ever
[1:22:40] come in the house of God and you just
[1:22:41] barely get in the back door and you just
[1:22:44] call right in but about 15 minutes into
[1:22:46] the sermon amen you feel you're you get
[1:22:48] a little bit more Liberty and you start
[1:22:50] nodding your head a little bit when you
[1:22:51] couldn't do it before and all of a
[1:22:53] sudden you feel your hands start
[1:22:54] drifting up and amen and before you knew
[1:22:56] it you jumped on your feet and said hey
[1:22:58] man amen what is happening as the word
[1:23:01] becomes comes out amen it's like an army
[1:23:04] pressing back the demonic beats of
[1:23:07] unbelief and out in fear amen and after
[1:23:10] a little while amen Wow that we have the
[1:23:13] enemy pushed back that's your
[1:23:15] opportunity he meant to accept the
[1:23:18] things that you've been desiring and
[1:23:20] warning God God knows what he's doing
[1:23:22] brethren hey man the preaching of the
[1:23:25] gospel is still the way God deals with
[1:23:28] his people hey man hey man I believe
[1:23:31] that's the truth
[1:23:33] hey man I've seen that too many times
[1:23:35] hey man I've seen that with a word of
[1:23:37] God used and in Supernatural ways say
[1:23:40] men and we were in the minute in the
[1:23:41] meeting one night and never said it was
[1:23:43] a lady that come up to the to the
[1:23:45] platform and she told me she said well
[1:23:47] Elaine she said I've been I've been
[1:23:48] years carrying guilt she said where
[1:23:50] where I had been abused as a child and
[1:23:53] she's have been carrying that guilt for
[1:23:54] years she said but this morning
[1:23:56] something in the message has has
[1:23:58] quickened and I believe God's gonna let
[1:24:00] me free from it we prayed for him when
[1:24:02] that spirit left her he meant she let us
[1:24:04] scream out and the power of God come in
[1:24:06] the building a man and a woman been
[1:24:09] living for years with a spirit amen and
[1:24:11] that spirit was delivered right in that
[1:24:13] service well about a year later I was
[1:24:16] over in Norway and I was preaching him
[1:24:18] and just this little thing popped in my
[1:24:20] mind amen and that testimony Amen toward
[1:24:24] the end of the service and and I begin
[1:24:26] if I how God had picked up the spirit
[1:24:28] and brought that girl to the altar and a
[1:24:30] great deliverance come on her over
[1:24:32] somebody else had abused her and when I
[1:24:34] started telling that testimony there was
[1:24:36] a young lady sitting on the front row in
[1:24:38] her 30s just began to speak out and and
[1:24:41] rejoice and praise God and tears started
[1:24:43] running and she just started rejoicing
[1:24:45] Liberty and I I had no idea what was
[1:24:47] going on but I knew I've been preaching
[1:24:49] long enough there God was doing
[1:24:51] something I didn't know what it was but
[1:24:53] I knew God was doing something and after
[1:24:55] the service of young lady comes she said
[1:24:57] brother Lawson she said I went last week
[1:25:00] to my pastor's wife and told her I've
[1:25:02] been being abused by a certain situation
[1:25:04] when I was a kid said I'd ask what what
[1:25:07] what am I supposed to do how am I
[1:25:09] supposed to handle it this is gonna tear
[1:25:11] families this is gonna and all these
[1:25:13] situations and when she started telling
[1:25:15] pastor's wife she said look I don't have
[1:25:17] all the answers she said I listened to
[1:25:20] you but I don't have all the answers she
[1:25:22] said but we're gonna have a meeting in
[1:25:24] about a week and she said God's gonna
[1:25:26] have a man of God coming here don't know
[1:25:27] nothing about all this and he won't have
[1:25:30] any idea and you'll be neutral about it
[1:25:33] she said so you get somewhere and fast
[1:25:35] and pray to that man gets here and you
[1:25:38] asked God to make him answer your
[1:25:40] question from the platform and Wow
[1:25:43] he was the last service and it was the
[1:25:44] last few minutes of the last service and
[1:25:47] the Holy Spirit is so faithful he
[1:25:50] wouldn't let me leave that meeting
[1:25:51] without speaking to that need
[1:25:54] thank God come on the scene it was a
[1:25:56] supernatural world and let me tell you
[1:25:59] tonight that same supernatural God is
[1:26:02] still among his people our God is not
[1:26:04] bad people and God still has the gifts
[1:26:14] among his church hey man I still believe
[1:26:17] in a resurrected Jesus Christ hey man do
[1:26:20] you see what is what's the world to live
[1:26:22] in today brother man tells us he said do
[1:26:25] you see he said years ago I was out on
[1:26:27] the west coast and he said they told me
[1:26:28] they said brother branham said used to
[1:26:30] be that was good gospel word solid me
[1:26:33] and had women out here and the
[1:26:34] presbyterian people had had taught the
[1:26:36] Word of God he said brother man he said
[1:26:39] now much of fanaticism come in he said
[1:26:41] and they've taken all the people broke
[1:26:43] up the churches and everything's moved
[1:26:45] into fanaticism you know what the
[1:26:47] Prophet said he said listen the reason
[1:26:49] these things has happened he said it's
[1:26:51] because you have failed to feed the
[1:26:53] people the supernatural bread of God he
[1:26:56] said and hungry children will feed from
[1:26:59] a garbage can if they have to he said
[1:27:02] had the church stayed with the phenomena
[1:27:05] of the supernatural and brought absolute
[1:27:08] word then the people would have stayed
[1:27:10] with it and we find out that that's
[1:27:12] exactly what's happened in the world
[1:27:14] that we lived in today denomination
[1:27:16] turned off from God they turned away
[1:27:18] from the word of the Lord and they went
[1:27:20] to soup suppers and creeds and numbers
[1:27:23] and money and buildings and churches and
[1:27:25] they forgot amen the resurrected Jesus
[1:27:28] statement that started the situation
[1:27:30] amen but there is a Church of the Living
[1:27:32] God and still upon the earth today
[1:27:35] remember says I don't want all of that
[1:27:37] whoa Jesus hey man do you know the
[1:27:41] prophet of God said what it is is
[1:27:43] they're actually from a garbage can if
[1:27:44] they have to and the children of God
[1:27:47] need to be fed with a true Word of God
[1:27:50] of thus saith the Lord that's right for
[1:27:56] wherever the carcass is wherever the
[1:27:59] supernatural is demonstrated there the
[1:28:02] Eagles will gather together amen do you
[1:28:05] see amen we can teach theology we can
[1:28:08] teach them on doctrine but the prophet
[1:28:11] of God said it will never satisfy the
[1:28:13] human heart doctrine will never satisfy
[1:28:16] theology will never satisfy the human
[1:28:19] heart the human heart is hungry to see
[1:28:23] the realities of Jesus Christ they're
[1:28:25] hungry to see the presence of God come
[1:28:28] down in the church the prophet of God
[1:28:30] said do you see what happens they get
[1:28:32] away from the supernatural part he says
[1:28:35] it in the message resurrection of
[1:28:36] Lazarus he said Israel when they come
[1:28:39] into captivity by the Romans he said
[1:28:41] they've been taken away we know what
[1:28:42] their Roman spirit is don't we and the
[1:28:44] priests got to a place that they got
[1:28:46] away from the supernatural part of God
[1:28:48] and they begin to teach doctrines and
[1:28:51] theories and things like this and Jesus
[1:28:53] when he came rebuked them and said you
[1:28:55] have taught for doctrine the
[1:28:57] commandments of men and have made the
[1:28:59] Word of God of no effect that's right
[1:29:02] when the church begins to drift from the
[1:29:04] supernatural they start leaning to
[1:29:07] understanding and the understanding
[1:29:09] always comes from some man or someone
[1:29:12] who wants to become great among us amen
[1:29:15] the prophet of God says it like this he
[1:29:17] said as soon as education comes in the
[1:29:20] fenomena leaves he said Christ leaves
[1:29:24] the church because he can't stand it
[1:29:28] tall he meant they get more smart than
[1:29:31] he is they know more scripture he said
[1:29:34] but the scripture is not given by
[1:29:36] education scripture is given by a
[1:29:39] revelation
[1:29:40] not education by a revelation oh that's
[1:29:43] right he said see when they give me get
[1:29:45] away from that that's when Christ leaves
[1:29:48] the church look at this flower to see an
[1:29:50] H Christ is only outside of the church
[1:29:53] because they have more education than
[1:29:56] they've ever had but they got less
[1:29:58] Christ than they ever had I don't know
[1:30:01] about y'all tonight
[1:30:02] Amen but take the education give me
[1:30:04] Christ let me see the anointing of God
[1:30:07] moving in the heart of the people hey
[1:30:10] man I'll tell you this amen the prophet
[1:30:12] of God said see the church begin to get
[1:30:14] away from the phenomena and he is a
[1:30:16] supernatural being and he's looking for
[1:30:18] a supernatural God but the supernatural
[1:30:21] things that's what the heart is hungry
[1:30:24] tonight for is to see reality that's
[1:30:26] what happened to Shiva in the Bible when
[1:30:29] she heard about God who was working for
[1:30:32] Solomon that's your type Amen Sheba who
[1:30:36] was down in a pagan world and she was a
[1:30:39] queen down there but she heard of the
[1:30:41] wisdom of Solomon that's right do you
[1:30:44] know that little girl Amen was ready to
[1:30:46] pack up and leave whatever she had to go
[1:30:50] find the realities of a living God amen
[1:30:53] listen when she was going down to Israel
[1:30:55] she wasn't going after idol worship in
[1:30:58] theology and education she had every bit
[1:31:01] of the idol she needed down there
[1:31:04] amen she had all the religion that she
[1:31:06] could stand down there they had temples
[1:31:09] right there
[1:31:10] they had priests right there they had
[1:31:13] church right there but what they didn't
[1:31:16] have was the God of Israel and she
[1:31:19] wanted to see that number smaller than
[1:31:21] Church there's more than theology
[1:31:23] there's more than batteries that's more
[1:31:25] than gatherings together there is a God
[1:31:28] of the gathering there's a God in the
[1:31:30] presence of the people I'll tell you
[1:31:32] tonight
[1:31:32] hey ma'am I don't know about you but I
[1:31:34] did not leave the nomination just to
[1:31:37] come to another Idol worshipping
[1:31:43] together but I can to see you may thank
[1:31:53] me to be a fanatic but I know it's
[1:31:55] available I know the presence of God is
[1:31:57] available okay why can't we have it
[1:32:01] [Applause]
[1:32:04] that's right do you see she was hungry
[1:32:08] she had a hungry heart to see the
[1:32:11] presence of God you know what that girl
[1:32:12] did she packed up everything she had and
[1:32:15] put it on some camels and she took out
[1:32:18] and the priest said you you you don't
[1:32:20] have to go down there we got God's here
[1:32:22] in our country
[1:32:23] amen but she said I want to see a living
[1:32:25] God I want to see the presence of a
[1:32:28] living God working on a human being
[1:32:31] I want to know that he can enter in and
[1:32:33] use somebody and she packed up and
[1:32:36] started and you know what her priest
[1:32:37] couldn't stop her the journey couldn't
[1:32:40] stop her the trouble couldn't stop her
[1:32:42] but she packed up everything she had and
[1:32:44] she said if this is what they say it is
[1:32:47] when I get down there I'm gonna invest
[1:32:51] everything I have in it and when you
[1:32:54] come to see this Living God
[1:32:56] you need to pack up everything you got
[1:32:59] amen because if it here's what we're
[1:33:02] saying it is it's worth investing
[1:33:04] everything you got into it
[1:33:07] amen amen listen the cost ain't sure
[1:33:09] it's gonna cost you the same thing it
[1:33:13] costs her it's gonna cost you the same
[1:33:15] thing that it costs the children of
[1:33:17] Israel and that's everything
[1:33:21] to see him it'll cost you ever failed
[1:33:27] hey man do you see when she got ready to
[1:33:29] go down there she got in the middle of
[1:33:30] desert and that was mirages out there
[1:33:33] and they were they were thirsty and
[1:33:34] there was mirages that came up y'all
[1:33:36] know what a mirage is out in the desert
[1:33:38] the Sun shines and you've seen it on
[1:33:40] them long high-wage looks like a lake
[1:33:41] out there amen that ain't no Lake Amen
[1:33:44] that's an image of a lake imaginary it's
[1:33:48] imaginary it looks real
[1:33:50] but it ain't real are you with me can
[1:33:53] you imagine that there they are the
[1:33:56] first thing for the waters and they see
[1:33:58] something that looks real and the
[1:34:00] prophet of God said they go down there
[1:34:02] and they take the sand and hot sand and
[1:34:05] throw it up and all they're doing is
[1:34:07] heaping hot sand on their head it wasn't
[1:34:10] water it was hot sand and the
[1:34:12] denominational promises that they have
[1:34:15] brought the waters of life it's not
[1:34:18] waters it's imaginary
[1:34:20] it's an imagination amen Hailey's
[1:34:22] heaping hot sand upon the church a mint
[1:34:25] but if you keep pressing on if you keep
[1:34:28] pressing on there is a God but the
[1:34:31] children of Israel can be tonight the
[1:34:33] presence of God is just ahead
[1:34:35] hey man do you see what she done now
[1:34:38] y'all know she got up there in the
[1:34:39] presence of Solomon and when she heard
[1:34:41] that gift what'd she do she invested all
[1:34:43] she had and even her breath left her
[1:34:45] body she said it's everything I heard
[1:34:47] and more
[1:34:48] amen it's everything I believed for and
[1:34:51] more amen and I believe tonight that
[1:34:53] there's a church Amen that's got to
[1:34:55] press through to get into the atmosphere
[1:34:58] of the supernatural God amen and it's
[1:35:02] worth every investment that you have
[1:35:04] brought with you tonight all of your
[1:35:06] troubles all of your pains all of your
[1:35:07] problems amen if you land all aside and
[1:35:10] just press into the atmosphere the Holy
[1:35:13] Ghost everything that you've heard about
[1:35:16] it is real
[1:35:18] listen amen come on I'm a I'm a I'm a
[1:35:22] realist I guess but do you know how many
[1:35:24] rumors must have reached the ears of of
[1:35:27] Sheba before she got now if there y'all
[1:35:30] heard of good
[1:35:32] you've heard about good sports players
[1:35:34] yeah they got all kinds of rumors that
[1:35:36] blow way bigger than life way bigger
[1:35:39] than life but when she got down there
[1:35:41] she said you have exceeded above what I
[1:35:43] have heard about this they stretched out
[1:35:48] you know they told it bigger than he was
[1:35:50] Amen but they couldn't outdo what God
[1:35:53] does and ain't no matter how wonderful
[1:35:56] somebody makes it sound they don't no
[1:35:59] matter how wonderful that we have
[1:36:01] bragged up the presence of God
[1:36:03] one five-minute session in the presence
[1:36:06] of an Almighty God and you'll come out
[1:36:09] and say it's more than I thought it was
[1:36:13] God
[1:36:15] hey man it's more than they thought hey
[1:36:17] man it's worth it didn't it hey man you
[1:36:19] got you got it you got to go in you see
[1:36:22] you got a goal and overcome the Bible
[1:36:25] says to him that overcometh that's right
[1:36:28] Amen will I give to eat of the hidden
[1:36:30] manna
[1:36:31] to him that overcometh you see it's a
[1:36:33] reason it says overcome then in other
[1:36:36] words that's going to be something in
[1:36:37] front of you it's going to be pressure
[1:36:39] so it's going to be problems there's
[1:36:41] going to be issues the devil don't want
[1:36:44] you going where I'm talking about
[1:36:46] tonight because in the presence of God
[1:36:50] he is a powerless adversary in the
[1:36:52] presence of God doubts will die in the
[1:36:55] presence of God troubles will disappear
[1:36:58] amen but you see you've got to overcome
[1:37:01] to get into the presence of God amen
[1:37:04] there's a reason they call it overcoming
[1:37:06] you're gonna have to do something like
[1:37:07] overcome a mint not now you've got to
[1:37:09] think of this because but if you get two
[1:37:12] or three gathered in the name of Jesus
[1:37:15] tonight he said I'll be there in their
[1:37:17] minutes
[1:37:17] if you get one he can flee a thousand
[1:37:20] you take two he can flee ten thousand
[1:37:23] the prophet of God said on the day of
[1:37:25] Pentecost he said the pillar fire
[1:37:27] divided itself and come down in
[1:37:29] believers 120 of them and he dwells
[1:37:34] within them the prophet of God said
[1:37:36] that's why it's written where two or
[1:37:38] three are gathered in my name there I am
[1:37:41] he said so if you got two together
[1:37:43] that's two licks of the fire
[1:37:46] you get free together four together five
[1:37:48] together he said now is us gathering
[1:37:51] together
[1:37:51] he said the complete pillar of fire has
[1:37:55] come back together again now I don't
[1:37:58] know about you but if I was the devil I
[1:38:00] wouldn't want that to happen I wouldn't
[1:38:03] want a church full of people with the
[1:38:05] anointing of God in their lives to break
[1:38:07] through into a realm of truth and
[1:38:10] understanding amen you know what I'd do
[1:38:12] if I the devil I'd fight you all the way
[1:38:14] to church I'd give you a flat if I had
[1:38:17] to I'd like a guy cut you off bounce the
[1:38:20] red light I'd have the wife say
[1:38:22] something to the husband I'd have the
[1:38:24] husband say something to the wife I'd
[1:38:28] put a prideful spirit on the husband
[1:38:30] that when he said it he wouldn't repent
[1:38:32] and I'd have the family all tore up on
[1:38:35] the way to church and yeah screaming and
[1:38:38] hollering upset and Rama's mad at daddy
[1:38:40] was time to get to church nobody wants
[1:38:42] to worship nobody wants to praise nobody
[1:38:45] wants to come in the presence of God
[1:38:47] because if the devil can hold you out of
[1:38:49] unity he can hold you out of the
[1:38:52] atmosphere and he's got you whipped on
[1:38:54] your ground
[1:38:59] to do with him sometimes it's not easy I
[1:39:22] know it's a little bit difficult but
[1:39:26] it's worth you gotta keep my martyrs hot
[1:39:57] buddy hey man you gotta keep pressing
[1:39:59] hey man you gotta keep pressing now a
[1:40:02] man as you keep pressing in the Lord and
[1:40:04] then all of a sudden you just keep
[1:40:07] pressing after a while things get easier
[1:40:09] as you get deeper in you know sometimes
[1:40:13] Amen I know the devil don't like us to
[1:40:15] go here but sometimes you know what I
[1:40:18] may actually do if I'm ever preaching to
[1:40:21] you and it looks silly a man and you
[1:40:23] think what's he doing if I just throw my
[1:40:25] hand up like this and I start doing this
[1:40:28] I want y'all to know if I don't say
[1:40:29] nothing about it if I don't even call
[1:40:31] min if I just stole my hand up like this
[1:40:33] I want you to know what I'm doing this
[1:40:35] is sign language now I told the devil a
[1:40:38] few years ago I said that well you've
[1:40:40] tried everything you can do to keep me
[1:40:43] out of the presence of God you've done
[1:40:45] everything you can do to keep me from
[1:40:47] living this far from making it this far
[1:40:49] from serving the Lord from being in the
[1:40:51] message from preaching the word he's
[1:40:53] done everything you can do but every now
[1:40:55] and then
[1:40:56] I'm preaching I just waved my hand like
[1:40:58] this and I say we've been through some
[1:41:25] things but we're gonna keep going you
[1:41:28] see as you keep going you keep pressing
[1:41:30] him ten overcometh will I give to each
[1:41:33] other you know the prophet of God said
[1:41:37] the secret to that is the hidden manna
[1:41:40] was supernatural food supernaturally
[1:41:43] mate supernaturally given and
[1:41:45] supernaturally kept it's a supernatural
[1:41:48] food they meant that in the days of
[1:41:50] Moses when the children of Israel was
[1:41:53] journey and remember God rained manna
[1:41:55] out of the heavens and fed them what
[1:41:57] natural food it was supernatural food
[1:42:01] supernaturally bait but the problem is
[1:42:04] that was coming other generations and
[1:42:07] the Prophet said God did not want other
[1:42:10] generations to not have a taste of what
[1:42:13] he did for them cuz he later in the
[1:42:15] years they're gonna say what God did in
[1:42:17] the days of Moses and the days of the
[1:42:19] journey and how wonderful it was but God
[1:42:21] told Moses he said you go out to dinner
[1:42:24] and get a barrel fool well that's
[1:42:26] supernatural manna and I want you to
[1:42:28] haul it in to the end of the interval
[1:42:30] and I want you to set it there and the
[1:42:32] Holies of Holies where the Chicana
[1:42:34] latias
[1:42:35] and in the presence of God it would
[1:42:39] preserve the food that fell in previous
[1:42:42] generations that hundreds of years later
[1:42:45] young men who would raise up in the in
[1:42:48] the priesthood to go taste the exact
[1:42:52] dude that had failed in the days of
[1:42:54] Moses in the presence of God now listen
[1:42:57] friend I want you to know you couldn't
[1:42:59] taste that food anywhere hundreds of
[1:43:02] years later a menu you can stand out in
[1:43:05] in certain places and say there's not
[1:43:07] even such a thing now but you had to go
[1:43:10] where the food was in the days of Moses
[1:43:15] he build a tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:43:17] is that right that Tabernacle was a
[1:43:20] meeting place with God and he builded a
[1:43:22] tent they meant with three phases of
[1:43:25] course he saw the phone of God in heaven
[1:43:27] and built the pattern on the earth and
[1:43:30] it was a body soul and spirit it was an
[1:43:34] outer court an inner court and the holy
[1:43:36] sub wholeness is that right now on the
[1:43:39] outer Court they had sunshine and rain
[1:43:41] but see that was one atmosphere but
[1:43:45] there was another atmosphere with a
[1:43:48] candlesticks word and it was anyone's it
[1:43:51] was good light amen but it was smoked up
[1:43:53] and relevant said he never she had a bit
[1:43:55] of confusion under that light he said
[1:43:58] but there was one more atmosphere and
[1:44:01] that third atmosphere was where the
[1:44:04] pillar of fire was and in the presence
[1:44:07] of that pillar of fire the food stayed
[1:44:10] supernaturally kept and the people that
[1:44:13] lived hundreds of years later could eat
[1:44:17] the same exact food that had been fed in
[1:44:21] the days of Moses now don't you come
[1:44:23] here tonight and say I wished I would
[1:44:25] have lived in the days of brother
[1:44:26] Randall and seen the supernatural of God
[1:44:28] as I want you to know that same food
[1:44:31] that was in the days of William Branham
[1:44:33] is still on the earth today
[1:44:36] not in the natural realm it's not out
[1:44:39] here in the atmosphere of denomination
[1:44:42] but you gotta go me you gotta go me into
[1:44:45] the message you gotta go into the
[1:44:47] message of the hour you gotta go in
[1:44:49] there into the Intervale and back there
[1:44:52] in the Intervale that was a pillar of
[1:44:54] fire that was shining behind that badge
[1:44:56] of skin the meanest animal on the earth
[1:45:01] as a badger and behind that badger skin
[1:45:05] was a pillar of fire but you got to
[1:45:07] notice that was things back there that
[1:45:09] that badger skin would followers you'll
[1:45:11] know that was supernatural the prophet
[1:45:13] of God said the errand would get in
[1:45:15] there and make that walk he talked about
[1:45:16] this morning and it would Kyle Holies of
[1:45:18] Holies only outside they could hear air
[1:45:21] and walk it on the inside but when Erin
[1:45:24] stepped in there Erin could not hear
[1:45:27] them in there they could hear him out
[1:45:31] there then God had soundproof those
[1:45:35] people that was living in that room
[1:45:37] where they could no longer hear the
[1:45:40] criticisms you cannot eat this food in
[1:45:46] the presence of your criticism Bausch
[1:45:49] and unbelief and all you still got that
[1:45:51] in your mind it's not food to you you
[1:45:55] still got them plane circling your it's
[1:45:57] not food to you but if you take another
[1:45:59] step that veil drop behind them and when
[1:46:06] that veil dropped behind him they
[1:46:08] stepped into the presence where the
[1:46:10] Shekinah glory was dwelling over the
[1:46:12] word and right there in that presence
[1:46:15] was the eternal God and the very same
[1:46:17] food I don't know how they did it from
[1:46:20] generation to generation they ate that
[1:46:22] same food must have been the same God
[1:46:25] Amen that has dill in that inner veil
[1:46:28] was the one that had helped him back
[1:46:30] better amen in the witness that many
[1:46:32] light you cuz the barrel didn't go try
[1:46:35] from year to year from ages to ages it
[1:46:38] was the same food and the same
[1:46:40] Hey how did they get there because God
[1:46:42] was supernatural what's that no man
[1:46:46] going back there and refilling the
[1:46:47] bucket it was God supernaturally keeping
[1:46:50] it there for every believer that would
[1:46:53] come in there now friend you got to
[1:46:57] understand that was a powerful place to
[1:46:59] go in that atmosphere in that atmosphere
[1:47:03] according to the book of Hebrews that's
[1:47:06] exactly where Aaron's rod but it Amen do
[1:47:09] y'all know what Aaron's rod was right it
[1:47:11] was the rod of Aaron but that was 12
[1:47:13] sticks put in the holiest of Holies to
[1:47:15] determine who should lead Israel
[1:47:16] amen and those 12 sticks it was one of
[1:47:19] them belong to Aaron and it was nothing
[1:47:21] more than just an almond branch broke
[1:47:23] off of an old tree and it was dead
[1:47:26] ain't meant not it now Aaron carried a
[1:47:29] dead stick in his hand I think it's
[1:47:30] important to understand the stick was
[1:47:32] dead
[1:47:33] even when Harun held it Aaron walked
[1:47:35] through the congregation of Israel and
[1:47:38] the stick was dead he stood in the
[1:47:40] presence of Moses and the stick was dead
[1:47:43] he carried it in the outer ramps the
[1:47:46] stick was dead he carried it in the
[1:47:48] second round the stick was dead but when
[1:47:50] he got into the third round the chosen
[1:47:55] vessel
[1:47:56] hello Church the chosen vessel amen in
[1:48:00] the presence of the Chicana begin in a
[1:48:03] man of 24 hours begin to bud and bring
[1:48:07] forth fruit in the presence of Chicana
[1:48:09] glory now you got to know what kind of
[1:48:11] fruit did it bear it bore almonds why
[1:48:16] because it was an almond to begin with
[1:48:19] it didn't change into something else but
[1:48:22] it found the power to manifest what it
[1:48:26] was in the presence of the Chicano glory
[1:48:29] in other words that God that had created
[1:48:31] the first Sri when he said let there be
[1:48:34] an almond tree Amen that Sri was living
[1:48:36] with the intelligence of that God
[1:48:38] dwelling in his life Amen but that stick
[1:48:41] was pulled off of that and lost its
[1:48:44] identity but when it was brought into
[1:48:46] the presence it didn't have to go back
[1:48:48] to the tree didn't have to go back to
[1:48:52] the tree went back to the creator that
[1:48:55] make the first God pulled you off the
[1:49:05] prophet of God said you come off of
[1:49:06] humanity an old dead dry sinner but when
[1:49:11] that's your kind of light begin to come
[1:49:12] over your life brother he had done a
[1:49:14] search on the life and it took ahold of
[1:49:17] that seed and it chased it back and it
[1:49:20] went all the way back to the Garden of
[1:49:22] Eden amen but it had to go further than
[1:49:25] that
[1:49:25] it went back in the presence of God
[1:49:27] where there was the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:49:29] that wasn't in the hands of Adam how
[1:49:32] about we wasn't entitled we were in
[1:49:34] Christ and he found us in that book
[1:49:37] that's why this message is the only one
[1:49:40] that can identify you in the Lamb's Book
[1:49:43] of Life

[1:49:49] marriage of the Lamb it has come hey man

[1:50:32] presence of the original Shekinah glory

[1:50:46] bride fruit you're not producing world

[1:50:53] thing tonight but that's a bride on the
[1:50:55] earth that knows who they are that have

[1:53:11] what he done with Joshua look at what he
[1:53:13] done with Moses and that was under the

[1:53:18] do with you Amen tonight under the blood
[1:53:21] of Jesus Christ I'll tell you what a
[1:53:24] prophet of God said he said the
[1:53:25] possibility here tonight is another book
[1:53:28] of Acts the possibility in this church
[1:53:31] tonight is an upper room experience now
[1:53:35] it's possible right here tonight the
[1:53:37] potential of this meeting is the book
[1:53:41] that's the potential of what could
[1:53:43] happen in this meeting tonight is a
[1:53:45] nether upper room experience my to think
[1:53:49] that them people wasn't no different
[1:53:51] than you are they was only children of

[1:54:12] begins to happen when the right
[1:54:13] atmosphere comes amen when the right

[1:54:22] Durban South Africa thirty thousand a
[1:54:25] men was saved him one altar call people
[1:54:27] talked about the day of Pentecost this
[1:54:29] is ten times more powerful than what
[1:54:32] happened on the day of Pentecost and
[1:54:33] you're trying to look back to a former
[1:54:36] age to find something that is real this
[1:54:39] is the most real anointing that has ever
[1:54:42] struck the earth the prophet of God in
[1:54:45] the first year of his ministry and
[1:54:47] 35,000 outstanding miracles in this
[1:54:51] message listen we've got pictures of the
[1:54:54] pillar fire that the critics amen are
[1:54:57] the one that took them we have we have
[1:55:01] 1100 tapes for you to go over and see if
[1:55:05] a prophet missed one prophecy or one
[1:55:08] vision Amen I don't know I meant where
[1:55:10] you are tonight I just know where I and
[1:55:12] in the place where I'm standing
[1:55:14] amen I read the Bible I have read what
[1:55:17] was prophesied and I can say this day
[1:55:20] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:55:22] that's what I'm standing I'm standing in
[1:55:26] a place where I've listened to we went
[1:55:28] through and counted brother Jack we
[1:55:30] counted for eleven hundred and something
[1:55:32] tapes amen and I wanted to know what how
[1:55:35] many visions were on those tapes when we
[1:55:37] got done that was over 8,300 visions
[1:55:42] where brother Branham would tell
[1:55:43] somebody their name or their address and
[1:55:46] their disease and listen out of eighty
[1:55:48] three hundred times not one time did
[1:55:52] somebody say that wasn't right brother
[1:55:55] BAM out of 80 let me ask you something
[1:55:58] how many times would it take for you to
[1:56:00] believe it was real let me ask you Jesus
[1:56:03] did it one time to a little woman at the
[1:56:07] whale and she said sir I perceive you're
[1:56:10] [Applause]
[1:56:12] [Music]
[1:56:14] the king of Israel and God would have it
[1:56:18] done Haiti 300 times on record and
[1:56:22] you're trying to figure out who it is
[1:56:25] brother
[1:56:26] we've got more than enough evidence to
[1:56:28] cover up every court in the country it's
[1:56:33] running for fear because there's a bride
[1:56:36] who knows where she is
[1:56:38] who she is and what she's doing with
[1:56:40] this message I'll tell you this friends
[1:56:43] as a desperation that lives today and
[1:56:45] the heart of believers we may be in a
[1:56:47] land but don't belong to us we may be
[1:56:49] living in America we may be living in
[1:56:52] some other continent amen but we're
[1:56:54] still children of God amen in the days
[1:56:57] of Elijah they took a captive of a
[1:57:00] little girl a man and took her down to
[1:57:02] Syria and there was a leopard down there
[1:57:05] whose name was naman and naman was so
[1:57:07] sick but this little girl saw the way
[1:57:10] her master lived and she said I would to
[1:57:13] God that my master name could go down to
[1:57:17] Israel where they got a prophet down
[1:57:18] there the prophet of God makes it sound
[1:57:22] like this I went to God the layman could
[1:57:25] get in the atmosphere were my prophet
[1:57:28] lives
[1:57:29] amen did you see this little girl new
[1:57:32] Israel the land wasn't the place he
[1:57:34] needed to be because when naman heard
[1:57:37] about it and introduced him to the
[1:57:39] supernatural he got hungry for it and he
[1:57:41] went to the king of Israel to find it so
[1:57:44] it wasn't in politics it wasn't in the
[1:57:47] country Amen but there was a certain
[1:57:49] atmosphere that naman had to get under
[1:57:52] it was the one the Prophet was under now
[1:57:55] watch because Amen this little girl Amen
[1:57:58] in a land like that told this great man
[1:58:01] if you could come down and come in the
[1:58:04] atmosphere but that profits in amen your
[1:58:07] leprosy will be healed
[1:58:09] whether you talk about inspiration that
[1:58:12] little girl was testifying my
[1:58:14] inspiration that's all she had because
[1:58:16] jesus said himself in Luke 4 says that
[1:58:19] was not one leper in the days of Elijah
[1:58:22] healed but naman that little girl did
[1:58:26] not have any testimony to go say naman I
[1:58:30] was down there the other day and there
[1:58:31] was a leper coming in and I've seen it
[1:58:33] with my own eyes
[1:58:34] she couldn't say well Roberts for lepers
[1:58:37] healed on the backside of Israel in one
[1:58:38] day maybe but she didn't have any
[1:58:40] testimony other than that she knew the
[1:58:44] presence that that prophet lived in
[1:58:46] could do anything for anybody she
[1:58:52] couldn't tell them 8,300 visions she
[1:58:54] couldn't tell if cripples walking and
[1:58:56] blinded eyes opening she couldn't tell a
[1:58:58] thousands and thousands of healings but
[1:59:01] she moved but the atmosphere that man
[1:59:03] was under
[1:59:04] if naman got under that atmosphere one
[1:59:07] time do you know I know tonight that if
[1:59:11] a sick person gets in the atmosphere of
[1:59:14] believing this word and the divine
[1:59:16] presence of God it don't take two hours
[1:59:19] it takes five minutes in that presence
[1:59:23] you know a man named and heard about the
[1:59:26] supernatural went down and brother man
[1:59:28] said he took his letter down the King
[1:59:30] how do you find the supernatural that
[1:59:32] way brother I said don't come through
[1:59:33] letters in church you can go you can go
[1:59:37] meet with the head of the church you can
[1:59:38] go meet with the tree I don't mean it's
[1:59:39] gonna happen you want to actually the
[1:59:41] church said what you do come and start a
[1:59:43] fight with us
[1:59:43] king of insurance what he was trying to
[1:59:45] get war with us I mean I can't heal your
[1:59:47] leprosy he meant but but Elijah heard
[1:59:50] and said he needs to come down here so
[1:59:53] the man turned from the king and went to
[1:59:56] Elisha he meant it was a great man and
[1:59:59] he went to lice you would have thought
[2:00:01] but Elisha hearing of a great ruler
[2:00:03] coming to his house he got up went
[2:00:05] outside
[2:00:06] you know the Bible said that Elisha
[2:00:08] didn't even go out and meeting this man
[2:00:11] my brother your Bible is a powerful
[2:00:14] thing and that's not one thing written
[2:00:18] in there that don't have a reason to be
[2:00:19] in there and Elisha did not talk to that
[2:00:24] man he sent a preacher Elisha didn't
[2:00:30] never even talk to that man
[2:00:32] but he said a man he told what to say
[2:00:36] and I tell you what naman found out Amen
[2:00:40] that you might not talk to a prophet but
[2:00:42] if you can just talk to somebody but a
[2:00:44] prophet is trained but a prophet is
[2:00:46] instructed for the prophets told them
[2:00:49] how listen friend I want you to know
[2:00:50] tonight that there's a fivefold ministry
[2:00:52] left in this earth a prophetess trained
[2:00:55] field and told
[2:00:56] Wow but a man can get rid of leprosy how
[2:00:59] to make the supernatural moon he's
[2:01:02] instructed them in the presence of God
[2:01:04] you see what when he went down there hey
[2:01:06] man this little preacher come out and
[2:01:08] met him and said Elijah said for you to
[2:01:10] go down and dip seven times in the muddy
[2:01:12] Jordan and Mayman got bad name and got
[2:01:18] mad as he died he gonna come and meet me
[2:01:20] himself
[2:01:20] is he not he gonna come out and talk to
[2:01:22] me I'm a big man huh I'm important
[2:01:25] somebody ought to say there's somebody
[2:01:27] with great importance hard to talk to me
[2:01:29] but it just a little simple preacher
[2:01:30] come talk to him and said what Elijah
[2:01:32] said let's go down and dip seven times
[2:01:34] and Elijah said and go hasten comes out
[2:01:37] and says excuse me name and says to him
[2:01:40] says well and then there's better
[2:01:42] there's better rivers in our country
[2:01:46] there's better rivers in our country
[2:01:50] maybe the property God said what is the
[2:01:53] what it's the reason to go to Jordan
[2:01:55] it's a ridiculous place for break man to
[2:01:59] go he said but there was a little guy
[2:02:01] standing next to him he said God always
[2:02:05] supplies that fella there and it was a
[2:02:08] little fella riding with him and nobody
[2:02:11] he said well if he told you something
[2:02:14] great wouldn't you have done it but he's
[2:02:16] actually to do something simple now
[2:02:19] listen if there is if there is a
[2:02:22] supernatural unlocked by disobedience
[2:02:25] now all of you know if you read your
[2:02:28] Bible you know David David Kendall's the
[2:02:29] number of the children of Israel and
[2:02:31] thousands died because he disobeyed God
[2:02:33] in the days of LP or they went down and
[2:02:36] the inland and the Israelite men labor
[2:02:38] the MOBOTIX women and what happened
[2:02:40] thousands died because they unlocked a
[2:02:43] supernatural plague but if if
[2:02:46] disobedience will unlock the
[2:02:48] supernatural
[2:02:50] how much greater will the obedience to
[2:02:53] the Word of God unlock a supernatural
[2:02:56] anointing and this man who was a great
[2:03:00] man went down to the river Jordan amen
[2:03:02] you see he didn't think he had to go
[2:03:04] down there he didn't have to go down
[2:03:06] there he had a right to not go down
[2:03:08] there but had he not went there he would
[2:03:11] have kept his leprosy and the prophet of
[2:03:13] God said you can come to the meetings
[2:03:15] and sit there and say I'm not going up
[2:03:17] there to that altar and Boo Boo and then
[2:03:18] cry and acting like the rest of them he
[2:03:21] said that's right you don't have to but
[2:03:23] you can stay a sinner just like you are
[2:03:25] amen but if you're gonna get something
[2:03:27] from God you've got to get to the place
[2:03:29] where you can get in the presence of God
[2:03:32] this said preachers the only place I
[2:03:34] need at the altar Amen let me tell you
[2:03:36] what prophet God said about a farmer one
[2:03:38] time said he wanted the Holy Ghost and
[2:03:40] the brother he had with him said well
[2:03:42] you got to come down here and go with me
[2:03:44] and they and they bastard the barn and
[2:03:46] the guy said can I get in here said no
[2:03:48] not down there Lisa
[2:03:49] my say and he said can I get he said no
[2:03:51] he said you got to come go with me went
[2:03:54] down to the hog pen and he climbed off
[2:03:56] in the hot mud got about knee-deep in
[2:03:59] the hope and he said boss come over in
[2:04:01] here this is where you get it no boy
[2:04:04] said well I don't want it that bad about
[2:04:07] two weeks later he got hungry he come
[2:04:10] back said look brother he said I'm ready
[2:04:12] to get that Holy Ghost wherever I gotta
[2:04:14] go to get it and he meant and he took
[2:04:16] off down to hog barn the boy how did he
[2:04:18] say hey boss where are you going he said
[2:04:19] I'm going to the hog pen to get the Holy
[2:04:21] Ghost he said I didn't say you had to go
[2:04:23] to the hog pen he said I said you got to
[2:04:25] be willing to go to the hog pen
[2:04:29] now if you're not willing to come to an
[2:04:32] altar you're not ready for the Holy
[2:04:34] Ghost if you're not willing a men to
[2:04:36] surrender your life you're not ready for
[2:04:38] the Holy Ghost do you know what
[2:04:40] sometimes I think I think we need to get
[2:04:42] down to the altar and pray and flip-flop
[2:04:45] like a chicken with its head cut off
[2:04:47] here we did something I think we ought
[2:04:51] to get something sure it's one thing to
[2:04:55] come and rejoice but we need a change we
[2:04:59] need a change in our lives and our
[2:05:00] hearts and it takes an atmosphere to
[2:05:02] change things it takes a presence of God
[2:05:05] your brother I've been doing this a
[2:05:07] while things ain't change will you watch
[2:05:08] your name and he did seven times it went
[2:05:11] about five times in he must have stood
[2:05:14] up and brother BAM said he said to
[2:05:15] somebody they know change it
[2:05:18] there ain't no changes been five times
[2:05:20] and they don't change it
[2:05:21] amen and the Prophet said there that God
[2:05:24] was and he said didn't he say seven
[2:05:26] times
[2:05:28] didn't he say seven times come on church
[2:05:32] didn't he say Amen go ye therefore and
[2:05:34] repent and stay there until you receive
[2:05:38] the Holy Ghost do you want you you
[2:05:43] needed five times but when he come up
[2:05:45] there seven time when he come up that
[2:05:47] seven times it was a change but the
[2:05:50] change happened all at once because he
[2:05:53] had obeyed the message of Elijah he got
[2:05:56] through another messenger who was
[2:05:59] instructed by Elijah listen I know it's
[2:06:01] been a long time in your traveling but
[2:06:04] listen you just keep doing what the
[2:06:05] message says you keep obeying the Word
[2:06:08] of God and one of these morning's you're
[2:06:10] going to have a change from the top of
[2:06:12] your head to the bottom of your feet
[2:06:14] you're gonna change in the moment in the
[2:06:16] twinkling of an eye
[2:06:18] think about it's gonna change I'll tell
[2:06:20] you friendly hey man we got a ride
[2:06:22] tonight say well I don't want to go down
[2:06:24] there and I don't want to be in that
[2:06:25] high I don't want to hack like man but
[2:06:27] you know hey man you got to give up your
[2:06:29] rights to find the supernatural Amen
[2:06:33] Jesus come to Martha four days late
[2:06:36] Lazarus had been dead for days and Jesus
[2:06:40] came brother man said Martha had a right
[2:06:43] to be angry with him because of his late
[2:06:46] coming he said but had she kept that
[2:06:49] right she would have never got that
[2:06:51] miracle you see you can keep that
[2:06:54] attitude well if this hadn't happened if
[2:06:56] that preacher had to done this if this
[2:06:58] situation had in the road you keep that
[2:07:00] attitude you can keep it if you want to
[2:07:02] you can be mad at God because the way
[2:07:05] your daddy did you your mama did you or
[2:07:07] the preacher did you you can keep that
[2:07:09] attitude you got a right to keep it but
[2:07:11] when you keep that attitude you miss the
[2:07:13] miracle that God is trying to do in your
[2:07:16] life but when that little girl seen
[2:07:18] Jesus come and she said Lord had you
[2:07:21] been here this wouldn't have happened
[2:07:23] but even now you see even right now
[2:07:32] thanks made me hard situations maybe but
[2:07:36] don't get angry don't get angry don't
[2:07:39] keep that attitude so your Lord I
[2:07:41] appreciate you coming tonight I'm
[2:07:45] looking for a change in this feeling
[2:07:48] tonight
[2:07:50] you know what Jesus said to her he said
[2:07:53] Martha roll back that stone take that
[2:07:56] stone away you know what brother Graham
[2:07:58] said he said that Jesus could have made
[2:08:00] that stone disappear with his pinky
[2:08:03] he could have dissolved that stone but
[2:08:06] rather than doing that he had that woman
[2:08:08] move it he had him women down there
[2:08:10] moving that stone what did he have them
[2:08:13] move that stone for he meant so they
[2:08:15] could be a part of the miracle
[2:08:17] so they he gave them something to do in
[2:08:20] the miracle but man said you got
[2:08:22] something to do you got a role your
[2:08:24] unbelief away
[2:08:25] you got a role your doubts away what was
[2:08:28] they doing they were preparing for a
[2:08:30] resurrection for a miracle to come
[2:08:32] listen friend I believe tonight
[2:08:34] amen that God is in the midst of this
[2:08:37] place and all we might have do is roll
[2:08:39] back the stones every man every woman
[2:08:43] every child in here tonight that's been
[2:08:45] born again jesus said unless you're born
[2:08:48] again you can't even see this amen and
[2:08:52] you that is born he said flesh is flesh
[2:08:54] but that is spirit is spirit
[2:08:56] the person that's born again is spirit
[2:09:00] spiritual authority your spiritual kings
[2:09:03] your spiritual priests everything that
[2:09:06] you have is in the spirit every power
[2:09:10] you have is in the spirit everything
[2:09:13] that you possess is in the spirit now
[2:09:15] you see why the devil wants to keep you
[2:09:17] in the natural because in the spirit you
[2:09:20] are more powerful than the devil see you
[2:09:24] are actually built to go in the
[2:09:26] supernatural we bought we bought a
[2:09:30] little doll for my daughter it's called
[2:09:32] a mountain current I don't know phim
[2:09:35] have you ever heard of the mountain curb
[2:09:36] a nice little boy growing up we had a I
[2:09:38] had a squirrel dog the Lord gave me and
[2:09:40] it was his probably the best squirrel I
[2:09:42] was ever Salling so for years I wanted
[2:09:44] one my daughter wanted two dogs I told
[2:09:46] my wife I said we'll get a dog as long
[2:09:48] as we get one of them counting dogs so
[2:09:49] we bought one of them brought it home
[2:09:51] now the thing is is we took this puppy
[2:09:54] it was about eight weeks old six weeks
[2:09:55] whatever they are when they're weaned we
[2:09:57] took offense mom and stand
[2:09:59] and they hadn't seen him since year old
[2:10:00] now probably or so but we took that
[2:10:03] puppy but that puppy had the genetics in
[2:10:06] it of some champion squirrel dog said
[2:10:09] but but but when it was born we took it
[2:10:12] right away so it never saw its mama
[2:10:14] Hunter's daddy huh never saw anything
[2:10:16] but when we started raising it we live
[2:10:19] there in the city and we've got a we got
[2:10:21] a back glass brother Jack you've been
[2:10:23] there and in the back there in that back
[2:10:25] glass it's pretty open then we got a
[2:10:26] little glass door there and that dog has
[2:10:29] been raised up right there in that house
[2:10:30] biggest part of it if it goes outside
[2:10:32] things somebody's mistreating it you
[2:10:34] know he's got to come back the house so
[2:10:37] it's been raised up right turned my
[2:10:38] daughter and thinks it's a human we
[2:10:40] finally had to start telling as a dog
[2:10:42] it's the silliest I'm serious that thing
[2:10:45] didn't know I was a dog and it get
[2:10:47] around other dogs it was scary it was
[2:10:51] funny because it is what is there but we
[2:10:57] hadn't I don't remember how old she was
[2:10:59] she hadn't but very old but all of a
[2:11:01] sudden one day she's out there in the
[2:11:03] yard and she saw a squirrel that dog
[2:11:06] having never been hunted having never
[2:11:10] been out with his parents didn't know
[2:11:12] nothing about it and he started barking
[2:11:13] and chasing that thing a few days later
[2:11:16] we started playing with it in different
[2:11:17] squirrels thing and all of a sudden this
[2:11:20] dog in the house she roams from the
[2:11:22] window to the window look in the
[2:11:24] backyard over his head is there squirrel
[2:11:25] out there and she'll just shoot a
[2:11:27] certain shoe she sees and she should
[2:11:29] start barking let it out she'll run
[2:11:30] around nobody ever taught her that but
[2:11:33] down in her genetics she actually is
[2:11:36] that and the older she gets the more
[2:11:39] those genetics become out of her of what
[2:11:42] she really was born to do now what's
[2:11:44] amazing
[2:11:45] amen as she learned that that word
[2:11:47] squirrel was that little animal so we'd
[2:11:50] all be sitting around the house and
[2:11:52] Nathan knows this is true we'd just be
[2:11:53] sitting around the house and in the dog
[2:11:55] be laying over there doing something and
[2:11:57] somebody would say well is that a
[2:11:59] squirrel out there the dog
[2:12:02] everything was normal house you say is
[2:12:05] that as far as she just I mean it was a
[2:12:07] funniest thing you ever saw
[2:12:08] she knew that word and what it meant and
[2:12:11] and and she never been trained to do
[2:12:14] nothing but it was literally in ER she
[2:12:17] was built and born to do that listen
[2:12:21] listen if that is true about a dog what
[2:12:25] about the children inside of you it's a
[2:12:34] gene of God but you are born for this
[2:12:39] you were born to praise God you are born
[2:12:42] to believe this message to go in the
[2:12:47] presence of God do you see if we start
[2:12:50] if we run over in the presence of God in
[2:12:52] an atmosphere and it begins to fall on
[2:12:54] us Amen it's not a time to back up it's
[2:12:57] a time to step in do you recognize that
[2:12:59] you can go to a place tonight to know
[2:13:02] what it felt like when they were
[2:13:04] standing on the Red Sea when it opened
[2:13:06] up you can come and go with me and step
[2:13:10] over in a presence tonight of what it
[2:13:12] was with Moses open the Red Sea you can
[2:13:16] know what it felt like
[2:13:18] but David brother branham created
[2:13:20] squirrel's you can know what it was like
[2:13:22] when Georgia Carter raised up from the
[2:13:25] band you can know what it's like I mean
[2:13:27] it was in the day of Pentecost the same
[2:13:29] atmosphere that they were under is the
[2:13:32] same atmosphere that's clear tonight but
[2:13:35] the power and the presence of Almighty
[2:13:37] God you've got to be willing to come in
[2:13:40] there you've got to be willing to step
[2:13:42] into the presence of God and become
[2:13:44] supernatural minded and let the
[2:13:47] realities of God do you see the prophet
[2:13:50] of God says you've got to find the
[2:13:51] reality of Ag Living God but you'll
[2:13:54] never do it till you get filled with a
[2:13:56] spirit you'll never do it till you get
[2:13:59] filled with the spirit you know right
[2:14:01] now and we're living in an educational
[2:14:03] age scientific age you go into astronomy
[2:14:07] and and it's far beyond anything
[2:14:10] the days of Enoch if you go into the
[2:14:12] study of the stars amen and you and
[2:14:15] you've got night now you got that that
[2:14:16] big old telescope that went back 14
[2:14:19] million light years they got knocked
[2:14:21] over to where stars are born and they
[2:14:24] see the colors that come up out of the
[2:14:25] universe my butt and you know what's
[2:14:27] wild them scientists have looked back
[2:14:29] that far and they didn't find God in
[2:14:32] there right now medical science can
[2:14:38] break down your human body they can
[2:14:40] transplant organs in you they can they
[2:14:42] can they can dismember you and put you
[2:14:44] back together again
[2:14:45] amen mate they can break you down till
[2:14:48] they know that very DNA of your life
[2:14:50] they can tell you you're going to be
[2:14:52] sick before you're sick they can tell
[2:14:55] you the health of your mother and father
[2:14:57] just by looking at your genetics they
[2:15:00] can break that down the blood cells and
[2:15:01] white blood cells and proteins that ride
[2:15:04] upon them in Hara am DNA it's
[2:15:06] unbelievable how far science has looked
[2:15:09] into the medical field into your body
[2:15:11] and they didn't find God in there if
[2:15:16] you're anybody abala just in here in
[2:15:18] biology if you studying biology and in
[2:15:21] the natural world
[2:15:22] maybe how deep have they went into
[2:15:24] animal life and tree life into so much
[2:15:27] right now they're growing weeds and
[2:15:29] trees and corn and they're genetically
[2:15:32] modifying the thing they're breaking
[2:15:35] into the inner inner inner parts of the
[2:15:37] seeds and putting genetics from other
[2:15:39] plants and watching a manifest and
[2:15:41] they're doing all of this breaking down
[2:15:43] to the very last source and they didn't
[2:15:45] find God look as far as they can go in
[2:15:50] the sea being found God as far as they
[2:15:52] go in the heavens and they can't find
[2:15:54] God they can go as far as they can go in
[2:15:56] your life and they can't find God but
[2:15:58] put God in the heart of a man and he can
[2:16:01] see God in the pine tree and he can see
[2:16:04] God in the rain bowl and you can see God
[2:16:06] in the church and he can see God in you
[2:16:09] see what we've got a have
[2:16:10] to see God we've gotta have God on the
[2:16:13] inside of us what the church needs for
[2:16:15] reality is a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:16:19] and come down on the church as well we
[2:16:22] want God we won't gone you've got on the
[2:16:25] inside and you'll see God everywhere

[2:19:16] in this Bible tonight I hope you didn't
[2:19:17] oh I hope I got a few minutes amen the
[2:19:20] things that are written in this Bible
[2:19:21] was written and you know they were
[2:19:23] written in a symbol form
[2:19:24] amen but but if there's a white horse
[2:19:26] rider there's a reality to it somewhere
[2:19:30] now people don't like it when you say
[2:19:33] what it is there's a white horse rider
[2:19:36] we know what it is there's a there's a
[2:19:38] the Bible said that sets on seven
[2:19:40] hills we know what it is it's a symbol
[2:19:43] in the Bible but it really is the Roman
[2:19:46] Catholic Church
[2:19:47] really it is that's an efficient five
[2:19:50] that says as a glorious church without
[2:19:52] spot or wrinkle but it's got to be
[2:19:54] somewhere in reality and I know where
[2:19:58] the reality is the world may not see it
[2:20:01] but we see it we see the glory of God
[2:20:03] that is here in the church and the
[2:20:05] presence of God that he's placed there
[2:20:07] you see a reality to it it's one thing
[2:20:10] for it to be a symbol but it's another
[2:20:12] thing to be a reality and this is the
[2:20:14] age for the reality of God to come to
[2:20:18] the church this is not a moment he's
[2:20:21] making promises this is when God is
[2:20:25] fulfilling promises do you see the
[2:20:28] prophet of God says it like this God
[2:20:31] promised in the last days he was going
[2:20:32] to do something and I'd like to ask
[2:20:34] anybody any minister anywhere one
[2:20:38] promise that God made that his church
[2:20:40] what he said he would do but the real
[2:20:43] church is doing it now he said when they
[2:20:47] don't want it see they don't want that
[2:20:50] answer because they have another answer
[2:20:53] but the prophet of God said whatever God
[2:20:56] promised the church is now doing what's
[2:20:59] the future home brother BAM says it like
[2:21:01] this these mysterious things we've seen
[2:21:03] come to pass after understanding in the
[2:21:06] hour that we're living in the position
[2:21:08] there is no one that we want to sit down
[2:21:10] and really sensibly examine what has
[2:21:12] been spoken of and what has been
[2:21:14] promised to happen and what has happened
[2:21:17] but that we can say those things are
[2:21:20] fulfilled now that's pretty powerful
[2:21:23] seeing exactly what God said he would do
[2:21:26] he has did it down to the letter in
[2:21:30] reality he has really done these things
[2:21:34] in reality because what we're waiting
[2:21:37] for the books to be open brother mem
[2:21:39] said it's already opened we're just
[2:21:41] waiting for the people to recognize what
[2:21:43] he done see it's already an open word
[2:21:46] the veil has already been rent the
[2:21:49] message has already been preached that's
[2:21:51] what's been shaking in front of you the
[2:21:53] whole time
[2:21:53] amen
[2:21:54] it's a vindicated evidence of the word
[2:21:56] of the hour it's a reality of God to the
[2:21:59] believer to them that have the Holy
[2:22:01] Ghost they see it fulfilled see you see
[2:22:04] this is the thing God is shaking the
[2:22:06] thing in front of the people and giving
[2:22:08] a response out of one and others are
[2:22:11] acting like there's nothing happened
[2:22:13] like God is then mentally when God has
[2:22:16] done everything
[2:22:18] what is the happened on Mount sunset
[2:22:21] what happened out there why do we talk
[2:22:24] about it
[2:22:24] why is all the preachers talk about
[2:22:26] sunset mountain in the cloud and why
[2:22:28] mother Graham says it's the attraction
[2:22:31] of the bride God fulfill each word it's
[2:22:34] attraction of the bride
[2:22:35] that's what's attractive the true bride
[2:22:37] is the fulfillment of the word in
[2:22:40] reality you read revelations 10 one to
[2:22:43] seven and it's a it's a it's a beautiful
[2:22:45] reading in the scripture but it really
[2:22:47] happened on Mount sunset when Christ
[2:22:50] brought the book to a prophet I mean it
[2:22:53] really happened to the church and that
[2:22:55] reality is what I was looking for not
[2:22:59] just something in the book but a reality
[2:23:01] to what was in the book I tell you what
[2:23:04] we ought to do tonight is wake up to the
[2:23:06] realities of God there's been a message
[2:23:09] given to the church they ought to wait
[2:23:11] to see man into the presence of God
[2:23:13] sometimes we're looking for God to do
[2:23:16] something when he's already did it I
[2:23:18] think about this if you ever you ever
[2:23:20] waited late at night for somebody to
[2:23:22] come to the house you ever you ever
[2:23:23] waited upon somebody it was coming
[2:23:25] amen actually you went to sleep while
[2:23:27] they were coming and after a while they
[2:23:29] come in and you didn't know it they
[2:23:32] meant but when you woke up you woke up
[2:23:35] to your expectations has been fulfilled
[2:23:37] and the prophet of God said what we need
[2:23:40] to do is to wake up to the presence of
[2:23:44] Jesus Christ amen we keep looking for
[2:23:47] him to do something to come into our
[2:23:50] midst
[2:23:50] but the greatest shaking the greatest
[2:23:53] manifestations that have ever
[2:23:56] been given to any church at any time we
[2:23:58] already have that listen if this message
[2:24:02] isn't enough I asked you what are you
[2:24:05] looking for Amen if this reality it's
[2:24:08] not enough what would we be asking God
[2:24:11] for now you have to you have to realize
[2:24:14] that this is a reality a man that a man
[2:24:18] that is awaking up of the church a men
[2:24:21] that have shocked your soul it'll shock
[2:24:23] you into a reality that Jesus Christ is
[2:24:26] here among us amen this is so real
[2:24:29] Church this message is so real it has
[2:24:32] been so manifested I am not imagining
[2:24:35] Jesus crisis in this building he has
[2:24:38] proved beyond understanding that he's
[2:24:41] here he has proved beyond question that
[2:24:44] this message is real that this message
[2:24:47] is true amen he has proved beyond
[2:24:50] question but the message of the hour is
[2:24:53] a vindicated word to the Church of the
[2:24:55] Living God my when I think about this
[2:24:57] tonight the prophet of God said that
[2:24:59] this message will become so real it will
[2:25:02] join the church with the word and it
[2:25:05] will be a marriage right now I'm not
[2:25:08] imagining I'm married to Christ not
[2:25:13] walking around in this imaginary world
[2:25:17] like I'm talking to this imaginary
[2:25:19] person and when we got an imaginary
[2:25:23] presence and we got imaginary things
[2:25:25] happening here flitting this is not
[2:25:27] imaginary
[2:25:29] there is a real Lord Jesus and he really
[2:25:32] raised up from the grave and this
[2:25:34] message really brought him alive again
[2:25:37] in the age that we're living the same
[2:25:39] yesterday today and forever
[2:25:42] I have seen him I have seen his presence
[2:25:45] I have witnessed the power of this
[2:25:48] manifested word it's the greatest
[2:25:50] anointing that's ever struck the face of
[2:25:52] the earth a reality listen friends marry
[2:25:57] all she done was made the word more real
[2:26:02] it's all she did and this message has
[2:26:05] been moving more to the positive all the
[2:26:08] time
[2:26:10] do you see friends you cannot see God
[2:26:15] without finding the reality to him can't
[2:26:19] do it in closing I want to want to say
[2:26:24] this you cannot seek God without finding
[2:26:29] the reality to that God the prophet of
[2:26:33] God said in the days of Abraham Abraham
[2:26:36] was in Babylon in that in that land of
[2:26:38] confusion and he was out there in that
[2:26:41] city of many gods and he knelt down and
[2:26:43] was praying above himself why he was
[2:26:44] praying he got a touch and he got a
[2:26:48] glimpse that there was a city somewhere
[2:26:50] else whose builder and maker was God I
[2:26:55] don't know if y'all I just went through
[2:26:57] a series on future home back last spring
[2:26:59] while I was studying in something really
[2:27:00] stood out to me there Abraham the Bible
[2:27:04] said sought a city and become a pilgrim
[2:27:08] and stranger seeking a city that was to
[2:27:11] come and had a chance to return back but
[2:27:13] wouldn't do it now
[2:27:15] I'm not a mathematician but but if you
[2:27:18] just just quick figures I'd say that
[2:27:21] Abraham was about five thousand years
[2:27:23] ahead of that city coming to the earth
[2:27:25] is that a good safe number 5,000 so when
[2:27:29] Abraham was living the city he was
[2:27:32] looking for wouldn't be on the earth for
[2:27:33] another five thousand meters the New
[2:27:37] Jerusalem which comes out to the
[2:27:38] millennium right so Abraham two thousand
[2:27:41] years to Christ two thousand years to
[2:27:43] today we got a thousand-year millennium
[2:27:45] then the new heaven the New Jerusalem
[2:27:48] comes on top of the mountain right so
[2:27:51] five thousand years before he had a city
[2:27:55] to move to the pool was so strong that
[2:27:58] he told Sarah honey we're gonna sell the
[2:28:02] house can you imagine your husband
[2:28:05] walking in tomorrow honey we're gonna
[2:28:06] sell the house and all of a possession
[2:28:08] where we going I don't know but I got a
[2:28:10] feeling there's a city out here
[2:28:11] somewhere
[2:28:15] there's a city out here somewhere that
[2:28:17] God has been and we're gonna go to that
[2:28:20] city that's our home and he left his
[2:28:24] home looking for a city that was 5,000
[2:28:29] years away and as he was walking one day
[2:28:36] he come to the spot where that city was
[2:28:39] gonna come down and the king of that
[2:28:43] city stepped out and met Abraham in the
[2:28:48] very place that city was coming down
[2:28:51] because the city would be coming for
[2:28:54] five thousand years God let him meet the
[2:28:57] king of that city to let him know it's
[2:29:00] real Church hey man we have sought a
[2:29:04] city whose builder and maker was God and
[2:29:07] here we are the seed of Abraham and
[2:29:10] we're going toward that city and people
[2:29:12] say well it's not real it's not real but
[2:29:14] God let that same king the same one but
[2:29:19] since your name is Abraham and your name
[2:29:21] is Sarah and you'll have a child he left
[2:29:23] my same king come down in this age Amen
[2:29:27] and meet the Church of the Living God on
[2:29:30] their way back friends I know the city's
[2:29:32] real I know God is real I know the
[2:29:36] message is real there's a reality to
[2:29:40] this word we have met here would you
[2:29:44] stand to your feet with us tonight is it
[2:29:49] real yes it's real yes it's a real thing
[2:30:03] it's reality real musicians come

[2:30:36] like with a full voice it's real yes sir
[2:30:45] it's real all this I hear you're looking
[2:30:50] at it's not real it's not Satan is the
[2:31:00] god of everything you see but the
[2:31:05] problem of God said God is the God of
[2:31:09] reality the guvnah the unseen realm is
[2:31:15] the God that we're serving tonight I
[2:31:16] want you to know he's real for you to
[2:31:21] know he's a real God in the house
[2:31:26] tonight
[2:31:31] when I was about 22 year old I found out
[2:31:33] how really was I still believed a little
[2:31:37] Church one night and they opened up the
[2:31:39] altar and I found out that God was more
[2:31:43] than just something they talked about in
[2:31:44] church or something my mom talks about I
[2:31:48] found that he was real I found that he
[2:31:53] was a God that walks with you and talks
[2:31:54] with you and he's a God that keeps you
[2:31:56] in the hours of trouble he's a God that
[2:31:59] shows up and that same God is real here
[2:32:04] tonight they may be some of you here
[2:32:07] tonight even wondering is is this
[2:32:09] message real it's the things he's been
[2:32:12] talking about real but I want to show
[2:32:15] you tonight this is the realest thing
[2:32:18] you've ever come in contact with his
[2:32:24] presence is real his anointing is real
[2:32:28] and if he ever comes in your heart you
[2:32:31] can see him you can see for what he is
[2:32:33] what do you what he needs
[2:32:35] I wonder is there somebody here tonight
[2:32:40] and by the way I need this to be real to
[2:32:42] me
[2:32:43] the probably God said Lord let the
[2:32:48] people come into presence toward it
[2:32:50] becomes real again do you remember when
[2:32:56] the people first come into message and
[2:32:57] they hauled the televisions out all the
[2:33:01] world behind
[2:33:03] music they left they left every bit of
[2:33:09] that because the message was read to all
[2:33:15] and they can become that real to you
[2:33:17] tonight it can become real in your heart
[2:33:21] this this word this Jesus Christ can
[2:33:24] become that real to you that you sell
[2:33:26] out everything that you are and give
[2:33:29] your life to Christ tonight as some of
[2:33:32] you don't know me I understand that but
[2:33:37] I want to be a witness to you tonight
[2:33:40] that you're living in you're living in
[2:33:43] an unreal world
[2:33:44] and someday all these things that you
[2:33:48] see now they won't be here anymore
[2:33:52] but there's another world that's more
[2:33:55] real than this world the angles of God
[2:33:59] are more real than the things that
[2:34:02] you've seen on television and someday
[2:34:05] they'll be more real to you than
[2:34:07] everything that surrounds you but even
[2:34:11] right now they're still here and can
[2:34:14] become real tonight in his presence I
[2:34:16] don't know tonight where you are I don't
[2:34:18] know what your hearts are but I I want
[2:34:21] to see the realities I'm gonna become
[2:34:22] more real and ask God to come here
[2:34:24] tonight I will ask the Holy Spirit to
[2:34:28] move in this room tonight and we've got
[2:34:31] somebody here like the queen of sheba's
[2:34:33] a nicer brother Wayne I've heard but I
[2:34:37] want to see I'd heard that I want to see
[2:34:42] I want to see moving the presence I want
[2:34:47] to see love in my heart
[2:34:48] that's just bow our hearts tonight
[2:34:59] father Lord across the congregation
[2:35:03] tonight well we have spoke things and
[2:35:08] Lord we've done all that we know but
[2:35:13] Lord you have promised you have promised
[2:35:17] father that if we knock that you would
[2:35:22] open your promise father if they would
[2:35:25] see they would find and Lord as we have
[2:35:30] spoke your word tonight we pray that
[2:35:32] right here in this building that if
[2:35:35] everyone here tonight that it is asking
[2:35:37] about the things about the reality of
[2:35:39] this word about the reality of your
[2:35:42] presence we pray tonight that you would
[2:35:45] dissolve every doubt Lord that may your
[2:35:49] anointing come in this building just now
[2:35:51] Lord and may you take them into a realm
[2:35:54] you take us into the Holies of Holies
[2:35:57] tonight take us into the place where
[2:36:01] everything is possible take us in the
[2:36:04] place where the fire burns thank us
[2:36:08] wherever and Rothbard's Lord take us
[2:36:12] where lives are changed take us where
[2:36:15] hearts through healed other I'm prayed
[2:36:19] tonight I'm pray for your children Lord
[2:36:23] that our grow weary and those that have
[2:36:25] been battling and those that have
[2:36:27] struggled through to get this far the
[2:36:30] enemy Lord would do all that he can do
[2:36:32] to stop them but Lord I know the seed
[2:36:35] thereof I've read about him in the Bible
[2:36:38] I've read of the ones that could not be
[2:36:42] stopped by fire or by hunger order by
[2:36:45] pressure and I prayed anandhan that seed
[2:36:48] would begin to spark on the inside the
[2:36:52] Lord that they then did is press through
[2:36:55] the understanding and the doubts and
[2:36:57] fears and find their self in you lord I
[2:36:59] ask you for your children tonight give
[2:37:03] them the grace that they have needle

[2:40:49] to you tonight
[2:40:50] I didn't just pick something to preach
[2:40:53] me nor directed me and I don't believe
[2:40:57] that the Holy Spirit would put something
[2:40:59] on a man's heart unless he's ready to do
[2:41:01] something and I believe God's ready to
[2:41:04] do something in this place tonight we've
[2:41:07] done all we can doing the preaching of
[2:41:09] the word but at this point you just

[3:16:25] the spirit was just moving on things and
[3:16:27] sometimes you just don't know him God
[3:16:30] will go after just one you have
[3:16:34] everybody come here together and he's
[3:16:37] actually just looking for one that he
[3:16:38] needs to deal with them and he'll design
[3:16:41] the sermon just to go after that one
[3:16:44] person someone she loves us Jesus went
[3:16:50] after the one that was in a graveyard
[3:16:51] sleeping there she's living there he
[3:16:55] left and he went to the other side just
[3:16:56] for one went through a stormy sea went
[3:16:58] through all kind of things just for one
[3:17:00] soul that was that was on the other side
[3:17:03] and what our prophet told us that one
[3:17:06] soul is worth how many worlds how many
[3:17:10] worlds 10,000 one soul
[3:17:16] 10,000 worlds
