[21:24] good to see everybody on the other side
[21:26] of the storm thank you lord
[21:29] praise the Lord I just I just want to
[21:32] thank the Lord for trip to New Albany
[21:37] was a wonderful time really wonderful
[21:39] time and as I was going now really
[21:43] wasn't feeling the greatest but I was
[21:47] gonna press on anyway praise the Lord
[21:50] I've been having some problems in my
[21:54] legs and some time I felt real weakness
[21:57] and cramping of what have you and I
[22:01] surprised everybody this time all those
[22:03] that travel with me but get in the
[22:05] wheelchair because I didn't want to slow
[22:09] everybody down with my problems you know
[22:12] and I'm glad that I did that it was a
[22:15] real battle of pride a real battle of
[22:20] pride but it's a girl you know you're
[22:22] close to 70 years old you ought to be
[22:24] able to sit in a wheelchair praise the
[22:28] glory to God but as we got there in turn
[22:32] into the service really really had a
[22:34] beautiful time and after thee I believe
[22:37] it was the first service we were in to
[22:42] praise and worship after the music I
[22:46] believe that was the first service and
[22:47] as we were praising and worshipping the
[22:51] Lord the pastor's mother sister Dottie
[22:55] she came down the center aisle and I saw
[23:00] her stop near the road that I was on but
[23:03] I wasn't really paying attention to her
[23:05] and then I look in the south her
[23:08] motioning and I wasn't sure if she was
[23:10] motioning to me Yahoo but finally I got
[23:12] to understanding that she was motioning
[23:14] to me and she called me out cuz she
[23:18] wanted to pray for me she she later told
[23:20] me that it was just so heavy on her
[23:22] heart to pray for me and I really really
[23:25] appreciated that because he doesn't let
[23:28] me know the Lord knew what I was going
[23:30] through and I think tour you know it was
[23:34] just such a blessing the service on
[23:39] Sunday night another glorious time
[23:42] another glorious time the after the
[23:48] service brother Nathan the pastor he
[23:53] called me forward because they had seen
[23:54] their little just the I guess I was a
[23:57] little tired because the night before I
[23:59] hadn't rested much at all I was up and
[24:03] down all night with cramps and usually
[24:06] vinegar would help but the vinegar
[24:07] wasn't doing much and all my roommates
[24:10] just sleeping soundly and I'm just up
[24:12] and down up and down finally got in the
[24:15] shower they gave me some relief but
[24:18] anyway he made it through the day fine
[24:19] but that night brother Nathan called me
[24:22] up and for prayer and I just think the
[24:28] Lord for that again I didn't ask for a
[24:32] prayer line but the Lord he closed the
[24:34] prayer line and brother Nathan prayed
[24:37] for me because I have to go back little
[24:41] earlier his wife had asked me how I was
[24:43] feeling and what have you now I told him
[24:45] you not had a rough night or what have
[24:47] you but he prayed for me and you know it
[24:50] wasn't anything that was especially
[24:52] emotional or anything but when he prayed
[24:56] for me I just believed and I thank the
[25:00] Lord that that night that I slept all
[25:03] night I had no problems no problems
[25:06] whatsoever
[25:08] back home going through the airport and
[25:11] all I told brother Jack and said brother
[25:14] Jack I said you got a temper of the
[25:15] Nathan that I'm still doing good my legs
[25:19] are not bother me and I haven't had that
[25:20] problem since I haven't had that problem
[25:23] since oh I just I really think the
[25:26] workmen just how he touched my body how

[49:21] and we like to hear this morning from
[49:22] sister Tanya will you come up system
[49:25] [Applause]
[49:29] [Music]
[49:36] god bless you sings I just want to give
[49:41] a little testimony about the goodness of
[49:44] God I first like to start it out by
[49:47] saying I know God's life has I mean I
[49:50] know God has been had his hand on my
[49:52] life since way back since I can remember
[49:55] I must I've never got a chance to give
[49:58] him glory for all of the things he did
[50:00] in my life which is so many I can't go
[50:02] over all of them but I'm I know when I
[50:04] was a little girl maybe two or three
[50:08] someone in my house had put some bleach
[50:12] and a lemon juice bottle and I used to
[50:14] like to drink lemon juice so I got the
[50:16] bottle and I drink it my father my mom
[50:19] had to rush me to the hospital they
[50:21] pumped my stomach and there was no
[50:22] residual burns and my soft focus and my
[50:25] stomach and you know I just know that
[50:27] was a hand of God because drinking
[50:29] bleach you know I should have had all
[50:31] kinds of burns in trouble but I never
[50:33] had trouble with my stomach and never
[50:34] had trouble with my throat and bringing
[50:37] it on up to date when I was 16 I
[50:41] contracted some kind of rare virus and I
[50:44] was paralyzed from the neck below
[50:46] I missed maybe three-quarters of a year
[50:49] out of my freshman high school year I
[50:51] was completely paralyzed and what the
[50:54] virus does is it spreads it starts from
[50:57] one side of the body and I started
[50:59] getting numb all the way down spread it
[51:01] to the other side then I started coming
[51:03] up and I was in the hospital for several
[51:05] months they had no idea what was wrong
[51:07] with me and then they were expecting it
[51:11] to spread to my lungs it was expecting
[51:13] my lungs to stop working that's what the
[51:15] virus just spreads to the muscles and
[51:17] each muscle it attacks it just stops
[51:19] working so but before it ever got to my
[51:22] lungs I was completely paralyzed from
[51:24] the neck below and one side of my face I
[51:27] couldn't move my eye or if I was smiling
[51:29] but only going this side but it never
[51:32] went to my lungs you know and they
[51:34] didn't have any treatment for it they
[51:35] just kind of had a wait to the virus
[51:36] wear off and I told he just my mom was
[51:40] praying the church is praying and it
[51:41] turned around so I never had to get put
[51:43] on a ventilator which is what they was
[51:45] expecting you know it was a long
[51:47] recovery it took me months to learn how
[51:49] to walk all over again and I had to go
[51:50] to therapy and stuff but you know I'm
[51:52] here and again no residual from that so
[51:59] many things you know God has just had
[52:01] his hand on my life all the way through
[52:03] and I don't know why I'm so undeserving
[52:05] you know I don't know why but he chose
[52:08] me you know and I thank him for it so
[52:12] about two and a half months ago I was
[52:15] doing my hair and I looked in the mirror
[52:16] and I seen a little bump up there look
[52:20] like a little pimple so just kind of
[52:23] watch it so in about three weeks time it
[52:27] tripled in size it became about the size
[52:30] of a dime or nickel you know maybe it's
[52:34] a little you know low infection I still
[52:37] wasn't really worried about it at the
[52:38] time I said well I took a picture of it
[52:42] sent it to my sister and she said well
[52:43] I'll just go to the doctor let him look
[52:44] at it so I went to the doctor he was a
[52:47] little worried he said hmm he sent me to
[52:49] the dermatologist so I went to the
[52:51] dermatologist and it really seemed real
[52:55] worried at the time he cut a piece of it
[52:57] and sent it to have a biopsy so he told
[53:01] me all the results would be back in
[53:03] about four days so we waited you know
[53:05] the devil just flying all over your head
[53:06] I say well you know I'm not gonna worry
[53:09] about it you know four days came and
[53:11] gone still didn't hear from the doctor I
[53:13] called they said well it's not ready yet
[53:15] you know we'll call you when it's ready
[53:18] week later still hadn't heard no results
[53:21] so low I what's going on so the doctor
[53:25] called me finally about a week and a
[53:27] half after that biopsy a seven o'clock
[53:29] one night I said just can't be good
[53:32] doctor call this legal so he called me
[53:34] he said well I got some news for you
[53:38] he's saying it's cancerous I say hmm
[53:40] really so at the time I was like well I
[53:45] said well what kind of cancer is it he
[53:47] said well it's a lymphoma I said okay
[53:52] didn't really know how to take that news
[53:53] you know nobody
[53:54] to get a diagnosis like cancer you don't
[53:57] want to hear that nobody want to fight
[53:59] that battle I can tell you firsthand
[54:01] nobody want to hear that kind of news so
[54:04] I said well okay you say well you know
[54:06] it's a cancer of the immune system and
[54:09] it's a cancer it's in the blood
[54:11] so okay that's what do you want to do
[54:13] you cell camera senior oncologist and
[54:16] we'll go from there
[54:18] so I went to see the cancer doctor and
[54:21] they sent me four PET scans but again
[54:23] the insurance didn't want to pay for the
[54:25] PET scan they denied it so I'm like okay
[54:29] so how you gonna deny a test that
[54:31] important you know so they can find out
[54:33] what stage it is or where it is or how
[54:35] to treat it insurance didn't want pay
[54:36] for it so after that I got the PET scan
[54:41] done my sister paid for it I got the PET
[54:42] scan done went back to the doctor they
[54:45] wanted to know whether the cancer was
[54:47] anywhere else in my body other than just
[54:49] on the top of my head so I was praying
[54:52] press the Lord this is in your hand I
[54:55] don't know why I'm going through this
[54:57] test but I give it all to you so I was
[55:01] just praying and consecrate myself and
[55:03] try my best to stay as positive as
[55:06] possible
[55:07] fighting back all of the negativity all
[55:10] of the demons that kept trying to grip
[55:12] my heart with fear I said Lord that I
[55:15] know you're in control I'm not gonna
[55:16] worry about it so the tests came back it
[55:18] was clear no more cancer nowhere else in
[55:20] my body other than the spot on my head
[55:22] so I was thankful for that I went back
[55:24] to the doctor again and she said well
[55:26] I'm gonna need you to do one more test
[55:29] you know to rule out whether or not
[55:31] you're gonna have to have chemotherapy
[55:33] as well as radiation so okay one more
[55:36] test I hate waiting for results of tests
[55:38] so this time they sent me to get a
[55:40] bone-marrow biopsy
[55:42] I went in the hospital had that done and
[55:46] this is about a week before the storm
[55:48] before we went on the trip I went back
[55:50] to see the doctor for the results of
[55:51] that on the 28th and she said well I got
[55:55] good news I say yeah I know it's clear
[55:57] you're not gonna find nothing in my bone
[56:00] marrow and there's nothing there
[56:01] she said well did you get the results I
[56:03] said no I just know it's clear I have a
[56:05] piece of my heart I know it's in God is
[56:07] in control
[56:08] I told us to the doctor I say you know
[56:10] she said well we want to start radiation
[56:12] now that you don't have to get
[56:13] chemotherapy we want to do radiation we
[56:16] want to start it this week to keep it
[56:18] from spreading I said well I got a trip
[56:22] that I'm going on with my church is
[56:25] already paid for and we can't start this
[56:27] week because once you start radiation
[56:29] they don't like you to miss you have to
[56:30] go every day I said okay well I'm going
[56:33] on a trip and it's already paying for it
[56:35] I'm not I'm not starting this week let's
[56:37] put it off till next week so she's okay
[56:39] September 5th soon as you get back we
[56:41] got back on Monday she says soon as you
[56:43] get back I want you in here 8:15 in the
[56:45] morning
[56:46] I said well doc I'm praying that this
[56:50] tumor won't be here and you won't have
[56:51] nothing to treat I said but I'm going on
[56:55] this trip I'm praying it's gonna be gone
[56:56] by the time I see you again so she just
[56:59] looked at me and saying all right all
[57:03] right so I left you know and Thursday
[57:05] before we were supposed to leave to go
[57:07] on a trip I wash my hair and I pull it
[57:10] up well but let me back up before that I
[57:12] had to go see the radiation doctor they
[57:14] had to create a mask for my face to
[57:18] protect my eyes and all that stuff when
[57:19] they go in the machine and they cut out
[57:21] a little hole in the top so that the
[57:23] beam can go down to treat the tumor so I
[57:27] had went to him I had the mask made and
[57:30] everything and then I had to see the
[57:31] doctor as well so I saw the radiation
[57:33] oncologist and I said doc there's
[57:37] another load of tumor that's coming up
[57:39] right next to the original tumor so I
[57:41] showed it to him he was like huh we need
[57:43] to increase we got to make that hole
[57:46] bigger in the mask so we can cover the
[57:48] area to cover both tumors I said hold
[57:51] Lord is paying sprint so fine don't
[57:53] worry about it W Allah don't worry about
[57:55] it so you know we did that and say okay
[57:59] he said you're gonna start this week I
[58:01] said no doc this is the second radiation
[58:02] doctor I said no I'm going on a trip
[58:04] we're coming I'll see you next week when
[58:06] I get back if the Lord will I'll see you
[58:08] next week so um we Thursday when I
[58:12] washed my hair I pull it up in a
[58:14] ponytail so I wouldn't have to worry
[58:15] about doing nothing to it the whole
[58:17] weekend so we was at the services in
[58:21] India
[58:21] and I was just praying sit lord I need a
[58:25] word from you as to what you want me to
[58:26] do I said Lord I'm giving it all to you
[58:29] I don't know what to do I don't know
[58:31] which direction you want me to go but
[58:33] I'm giving it all to you and I just I
[58:36] was praying and just listening to tapes
[58:38] and trying to keep myself in the right
[58:40] atmosphere at all times I mean to the
[58:43] point where I was even with my daughter
[58:45] and she was talking gossip and
[58:46] negativity I said you got a hush I don't
[58:50] need that around me right now
[58:51] I want to hear it I want to hear it she
[58:53] got upset with me if I say I'm sorry I'm
[58:55] not gonna be a dumping ground for your
[58:56] negativity I cannot have that around me
[58:59] right now you know but I had to do it so
[59:04] we were in Indiana and the services was
[59:06] going on they were very good services
[59:08] and I have to back up and I thank God
[59:10] for my pastor because all those services
[59:13] that he'd been preaching it's really
[59:15] elevated my faith to the point where I
[59:17] was like okay you know it was a 24-hour
[59:20] fight to keep the Devils from landing
[59:22] because they were definitely circling in
[59:24] flies trying to get me upset trying to
[59:26] get me to you know believe all this
[59:27] stuff that you're telling me oh you know
[59:29] it's a 50/50 chance it's gonna come back
[59:30] you know and you know there's no cure
[59:33] and all of this and you'd be lucky if
[59:35] you live five to eight years all this
[59:37] kind of foolishness I said WI I'm not
[59:39] gonna not gonna accept it not gonna
[59:41] accept it so I thank God for my pastor
[59:44] and the messages that he's been
[59:45] preaching that really really just
[59:47] elevated each service just elevated my
[59:49] faith and elevated my faith so Friday
[59:52] night it's a service in Indiana you know
[59:54] it was very good and you know I was just
[59:56] still praying thanking God and waiting
[59:58] for an answer
[59:59] Saturday I was still waiting for an
[1:00:01] answer so Laura tell me what you want me
[1:00:03] to do just give me a sign speak to a
[1:00:06] minister
[1:00:06] anybody just let me know what you want
[1:00:08] me to do Sunday came and go yeah I was
[1:00:11] getting a little worried I said Lord I
[1:00:13] got to see these people and go back and
[1:00:16] I don't know what you want me to do so
[1:00:19] Sunday night the minister called me up
[1:00:22] for prayer
[1:00:23] and I wasn't expecting that because I
[1:00:25] didn't go and get in the prayer line
[1:00:26] that's just Lord I'm just gonna trust
[1:00:28] you and he called me up for prayer on
[1:00:30] Sunday night and he prayed the minutes
[1:00:32] just stood around me and prayed and you
[1:00:35] know like sister Berthe said it was you
[1:00:37] know no emotional workup and nothing I
[1:00:39] just thank God for the prayer I went
[1:00:41] back to my seat still didn't feel no
[1:00:43] different and we came home on Monday
[1:00:46] and soon as we got home you know we were
[1:00:48] hearing about the storm so we got start
[1:00:51] preparing for the storm and you know
[1:00:53] running to get water and wood and all
[1:00:54] this stuff and I still hadn't even
[1:00:57] looked at my scalp my hair was steering
[1:00:58] the ponytail I hadn't taken it down so
[1:01:01] Tuesday morning it was time for me to go
[1:01:03] to the hospital had to be there at 8:15
[1:01:05] for a radiation treatment the first time
[1:01:09] I took my hair Dera not Anna ponytail
[1:01:11] was Tuesday morning
[1:01:12] so I'm looking in the mirror so I'm
[1:01:13] doing my hair cuz they told me leave it
[1:01:15] loose in the front so they can get to it
[1:01:17] that's what the ponytail down I'm
[1:01:18] looking at my hair I say nothing I'm
[1:01:25] like at first I was like okay is this
[1:01:27] just me because I want this thing to be
[1:01:29] gone so bad maybe I was just seeing
[1:01:31] things so I felt around I looked around
[1:01:34] nothing's there and when Troy came to
[1:01:37] pick me up cuz he was just getting off
[1:01:39] work he came to pick me up we went to
[1:01:40] the doctor I said Troy look at my head
[1:01:42] tell me if you see anything or if you
[1:01:44] feel anything because I don't know if
[1:01:46] it's just me want this thing to be gone
[1:01:48] so bad that do you see anything he's
[1:01:50] like no it's gone we immediately start
[1:01:52] praising worshiping God you know and I
[1:01:55] was like you know I was happy but I
[1:01:57] wasn't really shocked I was kind of
[1:01:59] expected it because I prayed I said Lord
[1:02:01] and I told the doctor I want this thing
[1:02:03] gone before I come back and see you so I
[1:02:06] wasn't really shocked but I was like wow
[1:02:08] he's really gone he really did that
[1:02:20] so I went ahead and went to the to the
[1:02:22] hospital and the nurse came and got me
[1:02:25] she put me in the room to start the
[1:02:27] treatments and I told her I said you
[1:02:29] know before you do anything can I see
[1:02:31] the doctor I said no I'm not scheduled
[1:02:32] to see the doctor today but I really
[1:02:34] need to see the doctor and she was like
[1:02:35] why I said well he need to reevaluate me
[1:02:38] so she was like what's wrong and I
[1:02:40] parted my hair in our shoulder I said
[1:02:42] the tumor is no longer there he's gone
[1:02:44] and she looked at me she's like hmm okay
[1:02:47] so she put me in a room and she went and
[1:02:49] got the doctor but he came in and he
[1:02:52] looked at me he started looking
[1:02:53] inspecting my head he didn't see
[1:02:55] anything I said it's gone doc it's gone
[1:02:57] I told you it was gonna be gone before
[1:03:00] you start any treatment I told you it
[1:03:02] was gonna be gone so he looked at me he
[1:03:09] said well what did you do to it
[1:03:11] I started do anything to it he said
[1:03:13] would you put on it I said I didn't put
[1:03:14] anything on it you said did you take any
[1:03:16] kind of medicine I said no dog didn't
[1:03:18] take no kind of medicine then I thought
[1:03:19] about I said well you know there is one
[1:03:21] thing I put on it I was pray for some
[1:03:24] hands on some ministers was laying on it
[1:03:25] that's the only thing that was put on it
[1:03:38] so the doc said well he was stunned he
[1:03:43] didn't know what to say I said so doc
[1:03:44] does that mean I don't have to get
[1:03:45] radiation because there's nothing there
[1:03:46] to treat no radiation there's no tumor
[1:03:48] there's nothing to radiate he looked at
[1:03:50] me
[1:03:51] Oh doubting Thomas come in he said well
[1:03:54] even though the tumor is gone I still
[1:03:57] think we need to do some treatment I say
[1:03:59] doc can't we get another PET scan can I
[1:04:01] prove to you that there's nothing there
[1:04:02] I know is there's nothing there I said
[1:04:04] I'd serve a God as a mighty guy he don't
[1:04:06] have dude healing he's not gonna take
[1:04:09] away the tumor and leave behind some
[1:04:11] cells you know so you know the doctors
[1:04:15] he's doctors just being doctors Wow I
[1:04:17] don't know there's a small chance that
[1:04:19] it could still be some cancer cells that
[1:04:21] are left there and I just don't want to
[1:04:22] miss pray Eddie trying to put fear in me
[1:04:24] I don't want if I do nothing you know
[1:04:26] then the thing spread and now we got to
[1:04:28] do aggressive treatments and we just
[1:04:30] don't want it to go that way I said lord
[1:04:32] have mercy I got to get one of these
[1:04:33] doctors to believe me to give me a
[1:04:36] prescription for a pesky and so I can
[1:04:37] prove to them that there's nothing there
[1:04:39] so he didn't he went hearing it I went
[1:04:41] to the other doctor my oncologist I saw
[1:04:45] her I just went to the office I have no
[1:04:47] appointment I said I need to see the
[1:04:48] doctor and it's like well it's really
[1:04:50] busy we got a lot of people since the
[1:04:51] storm you know and just jam-packed we
[1:04:55] can't fit you in I say look it's very
[1:04:56] important I need to see the doctor so
[1:04:58] the nurse I showed in pictures on my
[1:05:00] phone I said look this is very important
[1:05:02] I need to show her that this tumor is no
[1:05:04] longer here and I need her to convince
[1:05:06] the radiation doctor that I don't need
[1:05:07] radiation so she went back there she
[1:05:10] said let me go see the doctor I go back
[1:05:12] there now talk to her she went back talk
[1:05:14] to the doctor she came back out well the
[1:05:16] doctor said she'll see you so she put me
[1:05:18] in a room the doctor came in I can tell
[1:05:21] soon as she walked in the room myself I
[1:05:23] say remember what I told you a week ago
[1:05:25] I told you by the time I come back and
[1:05:29] see you this tumor was gonna be gone and
[1:05:31] I say I serve a mighty God
[1:05:36] [Applause]
[1:05:37] [Music]
[1:05:39] and she she just looked at me and she
[1:05:41] saying yeah yeah you did say that I said
[1:05:44] you can't deny it it's gone I mean if
[1:05:47] there was anything I could come up with
[1:05:49] a concoction to make a tumor disappear I
[1:05:51] would be a rich woman there's nothing I
[1:05:54] did it was all God she said well I don't
[1:05:57] didn't I don't negate the power of
[1:05:59] prayer that's what she said I don't
[1:06:00] negate the power of prayer but I said Oh
[1:06:03] Lord you're gonna talk to the other
[1:06:04] doctor ain't you yeah he didn't convince
[1:06:06] you the same story he told me but even
[1:06:08] even if they're they're doubting and
[1:06:10] they still want to you know do what they
[1:06:12] want to do I know I serve a mighty God
[1:06:15] and I know that he has definitely
[1:06:17] touched and healed my body
[1:06:23] come on let's pray
[1:06:24] [Applause]
[1:06:45] we serve a real God you can see the

[1:07:18] to do well I wonders for sturgeon and we
[1:07:22] thank God for what he just did for
[1:07:23] sister tiny if this is diverse nothing
[1:07:28] short of a miracle and the thing about
[1:07:36] miracles is that you don't have to fill
[1:07:37] them all right you don't have to fill
[1:07:40] them but they still miracles right and
[1:07:42] and and this is nothing short of a

[1:08:27] people to believe him that not even
[1:08:29] cancer was standing in the way of the
[1:08:32] prayer and God I believe you you had
[1:08:35] very specific reasons for telling him

[1:08:40] something that we'd be facing in this
[1:08:43] hour just attack after attack but God we

[1:11:14] night the reason I wanted to test him on
[1:11:18] a shared I want a faith to be elevated
[1:11:20] brother Nathan the Lord has blessed him
[1:11:23] to be able to pray for people that are
[1:11:26] sick and God gives results while he was
[1:11:29] there just kind of sharing prayer he he
[1:11:32] had prayed for sister Tanya once before
[1:11:33] here in our church last year and she
[1:11:36] wasn't able shouldn't have any motion in
[1:11:37] her arm and he come and prayed for her
[1:11:40] and that same night she went home she
[1:11:42] was ironed and she was doing all kind of
[1:11:44] things she noticed that the motion had
[1:11:45] been restored you know after the prayer
[1:11:47] and and you know we saw that and then
[1:11:50] while we were there he was explaining
[1:11:51] all that and brother Nathan beginning I
[1:11:53] just I don't know how he remembered all
[1:11:55] the details but he remembered every
[1:11:57] detail my said man this just this
[1:11:59] brother has a
[1:12:00] in his life you know and and oftentimes
[1:12:03] he's pray for different ones and they've
[1:12:05] been healed and so next Saturday night
[1:12:07] we don't have a prayer line here at the
[1:12:09] church and what I'm asking you to do
[1:12:12] bring folk that you know need a touch
[1:12:15] from God amen bring people that you know
[1:12:18] need a touch from God if you need to
[1:12:20] touch we're gonna have a prayer line for
[1:12:22] that but if you know people that you
[1:12:24] know you know what I just believe if you
[1:12:25] had hands laid on you it'll be all right
[1:12:28] tell them sister tongue is testimony
[1:12:30] telling sister burrows testimony right
[1:12:32] it just just get people here into the
[1:12:34] presence of the Lord and let's just let
[1:12:36] God do what God does amen but next
[1:12:39] Saturday night we're gonna have that and
[1:12:41] if you've been going through something I
[1:12:43] want to encourage you please amen come
[1:12:47] to that service of expectation we want
[1:12:49] to pray for the sick amen on next next
[1:12:52] Saturday night we want to do that God is
[1:12:53] moving Amen God is moving and now the
[1:12:57] other thing I'll tell you is that we've
[1:12:58] been taught well we know that you don't
[1:13:01] have to be a Christian to get a healing
[1:13:03] we already know that but if you want to
[1:13:07] keep your healing now you just open up
[1:13:12] the door to talk to somebody about Jesus
[1:13:14] right gentle never again got to be a
[1:13:16] Christian to get healed you gotta be a
[1:13:18] Christian
[1:13:18] come on come on we gonna pray for you
[1:13:20] and after they leave and they taking it
[1:13:23] they they healed nicely now if you want
[1:13:24] to keep your healing now you got to
[1:13:26] become a Christian all right now so I
[1:13:30] tell you church let's let's come back
[1:13:31] and expectation looking for God just to
[1:13:34] do some mighty things here I miss
[1:13:35] Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 through 6 a
[1:13:41] man it reads as says now faith is the
[1:13:50] substance of things hoped for the
[1:13:55] evidence of things not seen for by it
[1:14:00] the elders obtained a good report
[1:14:03] through faith we understand that the
[1:14:05] worlds were framed by the Word of God so
[1:14:09] that things which are seen were not made
[1:14:10] of things which do
[1:14:13] here by faith Abel offered unto God a
[1:14:17] more excellent sacrifice than Cain by
[1:14:21] which he obtained witness that he was
[1:14:23] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[1:14:27] and by it he being dead yet speaketh by
[1:14:32] faith Enoch was translated that he
[1:14:35] should not see death and was not found
[1:14:38] because God had translated him for
[1:14:41] before his translation he had this
[1:14:44] testimony that he pleased God now see so
[1:14:49] before the translation there must be a
[1:14:51] testimony Amen that you please God and
[1:14:56] now the Bible tells us how to please him
[1:14:59] right the Bible says in verse 6 but
[1:15:02] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:15:06] them so this is you know probably one of
[1:15:09] the most important sermons that could
[1:15:11] ever be preached because we are in the
[1:15:13] time of a rapture I don't know if people
[1:15:16] realize that right we're in the time
[1:15:18] where we can expect the translation of
[1:15:20] some saints that's the promise for this
[1:15:22] day and it ties right back down to your
[1:15:25] faith
[1:15:26] amen right but without faith it is
[1:15:29] impossible to please him for he that
[1:15:31] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:15:33] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:15:35] diligently seek Him amen the Lord had a
[1:15:39] blessing to the reading of his word I'll
[1:15:41] let you be seated and I have another
[1:15:45] scripture that I want to try to get to
[1:15:47] if the Lord would allow us a mint over
[1:15:49] in second Kings and we will it's going
[1:15:52] to be second Kings chapter four just
[1:15:54] give me a second and we will get to two
[1:15:57] that praise the Lord I want to just talk
[1:16:01] on the subject today aligning our faith
[1:16:04] amen aligning our faith some of the
[1:16:10] other details behind the testimonies
[1:16:14] that were just shared here today we were
[1:16:18] I was actually in the office preparing a
[1:16:20] man to speak on that Sunday night at the
[1:16:23] church
[1:16:24] and and as I was just making preparation
[1:16:27] [Music]
[1:16:31] sister-sister Bryant
[1:16:35] brother Nathan's wife she came into the
[1:16:37] office and she said you know my brother
[1:16:39] but she said brother Nathan if there's
[1:16:40] any way you can have a word of Prayer
[1:16:42] for sister Byrd she you know she could
[1:16:44] really use it tonight just just pray for
[1:16:46] her please so you know brother brother
[1:16:49] Nathan said okay we'll gladly do that
[1:16:50] we'll gladly do that and then brother
[1:16:52] Troy had come to the office as well and
[1:16:54] he said you know my wife asked that you
[1:16:58] know just if you know she could just be
[1:17:01] prayed for you know brother Nathan you
[1:17:02] pray for once before and there's very
[1:17:04] specifically say brother Nathan you
[1:17:06] prayed for once before and God touched
[1:17:08] her and God healed her and she was just
[1:17:11] you know before she goes back home she
[1:17:12] just wanted you to pray for her and he
[1:17:14] said well you know what we'll just do it
[1:17:15] right after the service and now
[1:17:17] typically what he does is the minister
[1:17:20] that's preaching he always kind of has
[1:17:22] that Minister because the minister is
[1:17:24] coming from underneath the anointing of
[1:17:25] preaching he always says that Minister
[1:17:27] preach I mean pray for it pray for the
[1:17:29] sick after the service but and these two
[1:17:31] particular cases he just kind of felt he
[1:17:34] even actually said brother Jack would
[1:17:36] you like to explain you know what what
[1:17:38] happened was just a time yeah last year
[1:17:39] and when she was healing said no no
[1:17:41] brother you take it you explain it you
[1:17:43] you you you you let everybody know and
[1:17:45] so he went up and after the sermon he
[1:17:47] just began explaining her condition from
[1:17:49] last year and how he prayed and how God
[1:17:51] touched and you can just see the
[1:17:52] sincerity and feel the sincerity those
[1:17:54] of you that were there you you felt that
[1:17:56] you know as a certain sincerity they
[1:17:57] they had just almost moved him to tears
[1:18:00] when he begin to think about you know
[1:18:01] what she had gone through and I think
[1:18:04] you know before you pray for sick you
[1:18:05] got to be able to feel what the people
[1:18:07] feel a man if you can't feel what they
[1:18:10] feel and if you're not touched by the
[1:18:12] feeling of their infirmity you'll never
[1:18:14] be able to get no results right but but
[1:18:17] when you can feel what other people feel
[1:18:18] and then you begin to pray like brother
[1:18:21] Branham you know said it was like you
[1:18:23] know a man working with a horse say that
[1:18:26] horse get all worked up you know and and
[1:18:29] when you get all worked up and
[1:18:31] everything you can't stand there and
[1:18:32] yell and scream at the horse you you
[1:18:34] just all you gotta do is create a worse
[1:18:36] problem right but he said he said
[1:18:38] when you when you when you just go to
[1:18:39] just just stroke the horse and whoa boy
[1:18:42] whoa it's gonna be alright it's gonna
[1:18:45] all of a sudden you just you you're
[1:18:46] atmosphere changes the horses atmosphere
[1:18:49] come on somebody Amen when you're
[1:18:51] talking to people you're the faith in
[1:18:54] the and the testimonies that you share
[1:18:56] that's the atmosphere that you're
[1:18:57] creating that's gonna change the
[1:18:59] atmosphere
[1:19:00] you can't carried out into situations
[1:19:02] like that
[1:19:03] you can't talk doubt you're talking I
[1:19:05] could just put it in plain language
[1:19:06] you're talking nonsense a man you you
[1:19:09] got a top plate in there we need Thanks
[1:19:13] somebody build up my plate right and so
[1:19:18] there's a way that you have to handle
[1:19:19] these things but as brother Nathan just
[1:19:21] begin to you know kind of moving to her
[1:19:23] infirmity you know just just just just
[1:19:25] from what uh what he what he remember
[1:19:27] from last year I said man it's just it's
[1:19:29] just something so you know call both
[1:19:31] sister Tanya up in sister Birds up man
[1:19:34] he just prayed a simple prayer and who
[1:19:36] would have ever known that after that
[1:19:39] prayer these things were coming for we
[1:19:41] knew the next day since the birds that
[1:19:43] told us the very next day say I don't my
[1:19:45] legs I had a better sleep last night my
[1:19:47] legs feel much better sad I'm doing much
[1:19:49] better but we didn't know about such a
[1:19:50] Tanya right and y'all saw the picture a
[1:19:53] man the doctors want to deny I can see
[1:19:56] the evidence right I can see the before
[1:19:59] and after now they would show you before
[1:20:02] and after surgery
[1:20:03] pictures why can't we show you before
[1:20:06] and after prayer pictures we know our
[1:20:10] God is still wrong right but you know
[1:20:15] what I was feeling there is that what
[1:20:19] happened there was an alignment of faith
[1:20:21] there was an alignment when when sister
[1:20:24] Tanya
[1:20:25] you know requested number see if she
[1:20:27] remembers and I remember the last time
[1:20:28] you pray for me God heard your prayer
[1:20:30] right and if God heard your prayer last
[1:20:33] time god I hear your prayer this time
[1:20:34] right so I want you to pray for me and
[1:20:37] he is she eating heater he you know he
[1:20:40] just kind of felt less so you know what
[1:20:41] let me let me let me take this I want to
[1:20:43] pray for this listen and I'm like well
[1:20:45] we just all gonna join together and just
[1:20:47] pray but but it was just a thing where
[1:20:48] you knew that guy
[1:20:49] was moving so now we see the results as
[1:20:52] I wait a minute wait a minute wait a
[1:20:54] minute look I don't care what you're
[1:20:55] going through here today I don't care
[1:20:58] what your situation is today I think
[1:20:59] you're in the right place at the right
[1:21:00] time where God can change whatever
[1:21:03] you're going through you don't have to
[1:21:05] take the doctor's report didn't gotta
[1:21:09] accept that right I mean sometimes we
[1:21:11] just surround everybody with such
[1:21:13] negative reports a man whose report are
[1:21:16] you gonna believe
[1:21:17] imma believe the report of the Lord all
[1:21:20] right
[1:21:20] I mean don't there's there's not one
[1:21:22] person that heard these tests for today
[1:21:24] that can leave here and say God is not a
[1:21:26] healer God heals can't serve God hears
[1:21:35] cancer we just saw him do it let me just
[1:21:41] give you a little something here amen
[1:21:44] I want to read this out of the message
[1:21:46] why cry speak Amen now as I'm just
[1:21:53] getting that then I'm reading paragraph
[1:21:55] 42 on this I want you to just get
[1:21:58] understand there's a difference in
[1:22:00] having an intellectual conception of the
[1:22:04] promises right and then also having
[1:22:06] faith in God's promises you know because
[1:22:09] sometimes when when we just get an
[1:22:11] intellectual conception we just mentally
[1:22:13] agree with what God said right but but
[1:22:16] at some point in time has got to go
[1:22:18] beyond just a mental agreement to a
[1:22:21] revelation on the inside of your heart
[1:22:23] that God gonna do what he promised you
[1:22:25] that he was gonna do right say brother
[1:22:28] Branham was kind of mentions that Moses
[1:22:30] had that intellectual conception of his
[1:22:33] purpose and life that his intellect can
[1:22:35] only kill one Egyptian right I'm going
[1:22:38] through this quote in a second say but
[1:22:40] after Moses had an experience on the
[1:22:42] backside of the desert he became a
[1:22:45] one-man army and was able to conquer the
[1:22:48] greatest army in the whole world at that
[1:22:50] time but that was after his experience
[1:22:53] what we're trying to do is bring people
[1:22:55] to an experience with God amen not just
[1:22:59] the intellectual conception you got I
[1:23:01] mean when you hear
[1:23:02] things like this if God can do that for
[1:23:04] them
[1:23:05] then I know God can do the same thing
[1:23:07] for me whatever you have neither it
[1:23:11] might not be healing it might be
[1:23:13] something else but whatever if God can
[1:23:16] take care of cat's-eye
[1:23:17] I can take care of you how do you
[1:23:22] somebody I want to just kind of get
[1:23:25] their start let's go to this quote
[1:23:26] brother and said Moses being born with
[1:23:29] this great gift of faith he said then he
[1:23:33] was anointed so it's one thing they had
[1:23:35] the gift of faith but it's another thing
[1:23:36] to be anointed he was anointed and
[1:23:39] commissioned at the burning bush to
[1:23:42] deliver God's people now see now sees
[1:23:45] what are great qualities this man had he
[1:23:48] was born for a certain thing God had a
[1:23:51] purpose of not catch this Moses was born
[1:23:54] for a certain thing God has a purpose in
[1:23:56] look you say God has got a purpose for
[1:23:59] you being here
[1:24:00] see if you can only get to the place
[1:24:05] how much trouble you'll save God or
[1:24:08] yourself to I want you to get that one
[1:24:12] real good you got a purpose for being
[1:24:14] born and your purpose is not to serve
[1:24:18] the devil amen your purpose is to serve
[1:24:21] Almighty God and once you can get to
[1:24:23] that once this revelation strike you
[1:24:26] that you got our paths you will save
[1:24:29] yourself some trouble and you'll save
[1:24:31] God some trouble amen see I mean you
[1:24:37] know all you got to do is some time to
[1:24:40] look around there's some people have to
[1:24:41] tell you like I'm brother branham's the
[1:24:43] first one say if I would just serve God
[1:24:44] early in my life how much more God could
[1:24:47] have did for me
[1:24:48] right but oftentimes we have that
[1:24:50] struggle you know our bodies here but
[1:24:53] our mind is somewhere else well I can't
[1:24:56] wait for the day for our body and mind
[1:24:57] to get an alignment
[1:25:01] hallelujah amen we got to get that thing
[1:25:04] in alignment when you when you when you
[1:25:06] got your car running all out of
[1:25:07] alignment it's not a good ride
[1:25:09] you hate to touch the brakes right you
[1:25:13] hate it because when you touch the
[1:25:14] braces just go to shake it all over the
[1:25:16] place right I mean when or or if you if
[1:25:19] you're driving at a certain speed and
[1:25:20] that thing out alignment it's pulling to
[1:25:22] one side of you're constantly fighting
[1:25:23] with it
[1:25:24] oh y'all work with me here you
[1:25:27] constantly fightin if it's functional
[1:25:28] right you practically pull it back left
[1:25:30] if it's pulled to the left you fight to
[1:25:32] pull it back right Amen but when you get
[1:25:34] an alignment you can take your hands off
[1:25:36] the steering wheel and that thing that
[1:25:39] just goes straight by itself holiness
[1:25:42] somebody stop fighting with God's here
[1:25:46] line it with your faith and let God do
[1:25:50] the drivin God has got a purpose of you
[1:25:56] being here see if you can only be get to
[1:25:58] that place how much trouble you save god
[1:26:00] of yourself - it says Moses born and
[1:26:03] then he was afterwards he was brought to
[1:26:05] the place where he was anointed and
[1:26:08] noticed the sea laying there with an
[1:26:10] intellectual conception the sea was
[1:26:13] laying there with an intellectual
[1:26:15] conception now the reason he hath that's
[1:26:17] because his momma and stood at him his
[1:26:20] momma told him you know how God did so
[1:26:22] many things at his birth and and how he
[1:26:24] was protected from you know the people
[1:26:26] coming to destroy the kids two years old
[1:26:28] and then how he was raised up in
[1:26:30] Pharaoh's house and how God paid the
[1:26:31] momma to take care of take care of all
[1:26:33] son I mean his momma taught him all them
[1:26:36] things so he had an intellectual
[1:26:37] conception can I just be honest we don't
[1:26:39] we don't taught our kids this message
[1:26:41] maybe we're not taught him the word they
[1:26:44] got a good intellectual conception but
[1:26:46] now they need an experience and once
[1:26:50] they come to an experience and that
[1:26:52] connects with the intellectual
[1:26:53] conception now we're in alignment
[1:26:57] all right now it becomes a faith a true
[1:27:00] revelation of who you are
[1:27:01] glory to God a man listening says he
[1:27:06] says and notice the seed laying there
[1:27:08] with the intellection with an
[1:27:09] intellectual conception with all the
[1:27:11] faith that he was born to deliver his
[1:27:13] people yet it never come to life until
[1:27:15] their light from the burning bush
[1:27:18] flashed across him yeah until that life
[1:27:23] of the burnt from the burning bush blast
[1:27:24] across it until he's seen not something
[1:27:26] he read about that's what I'm talking
[1:27:28] about
[1:27:28] not something he read about but
[1:27:30] something he's seen with his eyes
[1:27:32] something that spoke to him and he spoke
[1:27:36] back to it and how that did bring things
[1:27:39] to life I'm going on it says I think any
[1:27:42] man or a woman boy or girl nothing and
[1:27:46] intellectual conception of what they
[1:27:48] think the word is and so forth ever can
[1:27:50] have a pool never can have a full
[1:27:53] foundation stand until they have met
[1:27:55] that light that brings that word to a
[1:27:59] reality now this is important to me I
[1:28:02] think no church can see our action all
[1:28:05] the question a few weeks ago say how you
[1:28:07] know he how you know he's the same
[1:28:09] yesterday today and forever I asked that
[1:28:11] question you know and now with the
[1:28:12] testimonies that we just received we
[1:28:14] know he's the same yesterday didn't we
[1:28:16] not talk about what he did back in
[1:28:18] brother branham's day we don't talk
[1:28:20] about what happened in in barber day we
[1:28:22] talk about what happened in our day
[1:28:25] listen he says I think no church in its
[1:28:28] practice no matter how intellectually
[1:28:32] fundamental it might be that church
[1:28:34] cannot thrive until the supernatural is
[1:28:39] made known among that people we just
[1:28:50] can't keep talking about this we just
[1:28:53] can't keep quoting it we have to become
[1:28:56] the quotes you want them to talk about
[1:28:59] what happened in your day not just
[1:29:02] have a go Bob we got to become this word
[1:29:06] the church came through listen at the
[1:29:10] church the bunch the church can't drive
[1:29:12] until the supernatural is made known
[1:29:15] among the people and they see it I love
[1:29:20] that quote not just hear about it see
[1:29:23] I'm grateful for hearing about what God
[1:29:26] do it in this church and what God doing
[1:29:28] that search but it creates a godly
[1:29:31] jealousy when I hear God there one over
[1:29:36] them we got some of the same conditions
[1:29:38] here wait a minute my God is the same if
[1:29:40] he has no respect of churches no respect
[1:29:44] of people so if I can do for him I'm
[1:29:46] expecting God to do the same thing right
[1:29:48] here and he has done it he's done it
[1:29:56] Church he says he says until the
[1:29:59] supernaturals made known among the
[1:30:01] people that people and they see it
[1:30:04] something they can talk to that will
[1:30:08] talk back to them that vindicates this
[1:30:11] written word I tell you what he just
[1:30:13] spoke back to us this morning a man and
[1:30:16] you like it's out like I said you cannot
[1:30:19] leave here saying a man that God is not
[1:30:22] a healer not a dis Church you can't say
[1:30:25] that number yeah I mean anybody got any
[1:30:29] condition we pray we lay hands on the
[1:30:31] sick we pray for him and like they did
[1:30:33] you put no I was anointed with oil not
[1:30:37] in this but just right here on my
[1:30:38] forehead North it with oil and that's
[1:30:41] what the Bible said pray for the
[1:30:43] anointing with or pray for the sick say
[1:30:44] the Lord will raise them up that's what
[1:30:46] the Bible say it's real simple I think
[1:30:50] we make it too complicated one time
[1:30:51] brother Branham say he had some people
[1:30:53] coming up you know before the prayer
[1:30:55] line and you know they would stay with
[1:30:57] you know there was Gary pray and they
[1:30:58] just got a little too excited amen as
[1:31:01] they were approaching the prayer line
[1:31:03] you know actually let me go to this
[1:31:06] message faith is the is the substance
[1:31:10] faith is a substance and I'm going to
[1:31:13] paragraph C 63 but he was just talking
[1:31:15] about how
[1:31:15] people were approaching a prayer line I
[1:31:17] want to I want to this is why it was so
[1:31:19] important that the way that the sisters
[1:31:20] approached and how God did it
[1:31:22] it's simple y'all a man it don't you
[1:31:24] don't have to make it more than what it
[1:31:25] is you know how something you don't
[1:31:28] realize that you got faith you know a
[1:31:30] lot of us don't realize it I'm going to
[1:31:32] show you how you know you got faith when
[1:31:34] you came in here today Amen you saw that
[1:31:37] chair and you just plop right down in it
[1:31:39] you did not inspect the chair to see if
[1:31:43] the chair will hold you up you know you
[1:31:44] didn't know whether it will hold you up
[1:31:45] at night and some of y'all instead of
[1:31:47] chairs that didn't hold you up but you
[1:31:49] still have faith enough to anomalus sit
[1:31:51] in that chair but got faith after you
[1:31:52] got hurt to sit in another chair it is
[1:31:58] real simple I mean you have faith just
[1:32:00] to plop right down that chairs that you
[1:32:02] know I'm not gonna get hurt this chair
[1:32:03] told me and I mean you know and when you
[1:32:05] could just apply just simple faith to
[1:32:08] simple things like that it's the same
[1:32:09] thing with God if God made you a promise
[1:32:11] if God said it that settles it it don't
[1:32:14] matter whether you believe it or not it
[1:32:16] is still settled they used to say God
[1:32:18] said it I believe it that said no it
[1:32:21] don't matter whether you believe it or
[1:32:22] not it still saddled see it's all it's
[1:32:26] all in your approach oh my god
[1:32:28] Amen listen to this he says this it's
[1:32:31] just the simplicity it says there's
[1:32:34] nothing you can work yourself up to it's
[1:32:36] no excitement right it says there's no
[1:32:39] excitement I'm East 63 says there's no
[1:32:42] excitement I noticed people coming in
[1:32:45] line just get to shaking themselves and
[1:32:48] saying oh God hallelujah Aidan and glory
[1:32:51] to God see you're working yourself up
[1:32:52] before you even get you done working
[1:32:55] yourself you know and brother Mannis say
[1:32:57] don't do that so you interfere with
[1:33:00] things there when you start acting that
[1:33:03] way you interfere with things you say
[1:33:05] you say they say you interfere with God
[1:33:07] come up reverently and just lay your
[1:33:10] hand up and believe that's all faith you
[1:33:13] don't work yourself up to it faith is
[1:33:15] something that's already in your heart
[1:33:17] you just come and believe you see what I
[1:33:20] mean all my friends my I love you I
[1:33:22] wouldn't talk to you straight if I did
[1:33:24] love you but I love you too well to see
[1:33:26] you get by without this see you mother
[1:33:29] understand so you know when you're
[1:33:31] approaching you can't you just approach
[1:33:32] very simple and just taking God at His
[1:33:34] Word you'll see that uh that everything
[1:33:37] that you have asked God for it will come
[1:33:39] to pass I'm going back to that same
[1:33:41] message I want to start a paragraph c6 a
[1:33:45] man and I want to read just a couple of
[1:33:47] things then we'll we'll move on here in
[1:33:49] our fault it says now some thinks that
[1:33:51] it's a mental conception of the word but
[1:33:54] that is not right faith is a substance
[1:33:57] faith is not a myth faith is a substance
[1:34:02] of things hoped for the evidence to have
[1:34:04] an evidence it must be a substance so
[1:34:07] it's not just something that you imagine
[1:34:10] in your mind right it's something that
[1:34:13] absolutely you have it's something that
[1:34:16] you possess in your own being and what
[1:34:19] is it it's the evidence of things that
[1:34:21] you have hope for it's the evidence of
[1:34:24] things you do not have as yet unlike
[1:34:27] what he says there it's the evidence of
[1:34:29] things that you have hope for amen but
[1:34:32] it's also the evidence of things that
[1:34:34] you do not have as yet listen but you
[1:34:39] but you have the authority of God oh my
[1:34:43] lord you have the authority of God to
[1:34:46] say that you have it now you might not
[1:34:49] have it physically a check but you have
[1:34:51] the authority of God to say that you
[1:34:54] have it oh that's why I suppose you
[1:34:57] could tell the doctor I'm gonna come
[1:34:58] back in a week from now and it's gonna
[1:35:01] be going
[1:35:01] we've been preached that it's gonna be
[1:35:03] like you say see I mean you come back to
[1:35:09] that scripture and you really read that
[1:35:10] March 11 and you see how Jesus was
[1:35:13] before he gave that that you know that
[1:35:16] thought on it'll be like you say if you
[1:35:19] say to the mountain he spoke to that fig
[1:35:20] tree and when he spoke to the fig tree
[1:35:23] it's just my imagination I don't think
[1:35:25] Jesus stood out there yelled at a fig
[1:35:27] tree I don't see I don't see him doing
[1:35:30] that you know I ain't no fruit on you
[1:35:32] know Manny for you know more prayer
[1:35:34] Jesus didn't have to do it like that I
[1:35:36] think I think he just said no Manny from
[1:35:38] you know more forever kept walking they
[1:35:42] come back in 24
[1:35:43] Oh God they come back in 24 hours and in
[1:35:48] 24 hours that at the roots oh lord have
[1:35:52] mercy I hope y'all get it that that tree
[1:35:55] began to dry up at the roots the life
[1:35:59] was taken from it at the roots right and
[1:36:02] when the life was taken from that tree
[1:36:04] at the roots what I mean Peter noticing
[1:36:06] say that Lord the tree you spoke to
[1:36:08] yesterday look at it it is trauma it's
[1:36:11] the same thing when prayer was paid by
[1:36:14] our precious sister that they began to
[1:36:16] dry up at the root that's why the doctor
[1:36:20] could not see is the same Jesus in
[1:36:23] operation right now he hasn't changed
[1:36:28] that they will dry up at the roots
[1:36:30] whatever you need to try Abdallah try to
[1:36:32] pet the roots Oh
[1:36:36] oh my God my god I got a confidence you
[1:36:41] know my faith is just just moving to a
[1:36:43] level where I'm not looking at just just
[1:36:48] stuff that the devil try to get you to
[1:36:49] look at to get the cause you to doubt
[1:36:51] right I mean you know it like I said
[1:36:54] it's not just about healing in your body
[1:36:56] a man it's healing of souls right I'm
[1:37:01] looking for God to heal some Souls and
[1:37:03] and and I my prayers that God and I'm
[1:37:06] just speaking out of my mouth Lord I'm
[1:37:08] at Lord let every influence let every so
[1:37:13] call friend because a friend that'll
[1:37:16] keep you from crisis not a friend a man
[1:37:20] let every so-called friend every
[1:37:23] so-called associate let the
[1:37:25] relationships dry up let it be so bad
[1:37:30] God that they will never want to talk
[1:37:34] again Lord push them back into true
[1:37:37] friendships true relationships with the
[1:37:41] saints of God I want to see things fly
[1:37:44] up at the roof
[1:37:48] amen that's what my prayer we looking
[1:37:51] for for souls a man to be restored glory
[1:37:55] to God let me go on a little further
[1:37:57] here he says it's not just something to
[1:38:01] imagine the amount of something to
[1:38:02] absolutely have is something you possess
[1:38:04] in your own being what is it it's the
[1:38:06] evidence of things that you've hoped for
[1:38:09] it's the evidence of things that you do
[1:38:10] not have as yet but you have the
[1:38:13] authority of God to say that you have it
[1:38:17] authority of God to see it Amen even I
[1:38:21] mean whether anybody agree with you not
[1:38:22] you still got the authority of God to
[1:38:24] see that you got it the authority of God
[1:38:28] the doctor won't give you that authority
[1:38:30] but God has given you an authority to
[1:38:33] say it's mine I know what I'm dealing
[1:38:35] with but it's still mine listen it's an
[1:38:40] evidence something you have in your
[1:38:42] heart see it says now now it's not
[1:38:45] something that you're counting you just
[1:38:47] kind of push yourself to I've noticed so
[1:38:49] much of that in my meetings that people
[1:38:50] try to work themself up into something
[1:38:52] to make them believe now you can't do
[1:38:54] that you just beaten the air but faith
[1:38:57] is something that's just as calm and
[1:38:59] settled as it can be
[1:39:01] I like this faith the faith is something
[1:39:04] that's just as common as settle as can
[1:39:07] be that's why you walk around with a
[1:39:08] smile even though you're going through
[1:39:11] listen listen he says he says my faith
[1:39:17] is something that's just as common stuff
[1:39:19] as it can be it's taking God at His Word
[1:39:21] and have any assurance in your heart
[1:39:23] that God is able to keep what he has
[1:39:25] said that he would do and will perform
[1:39:27] everything that he said he would do now
[1:39:30] notice that many times people think they
[1:39:32] must be grateful oh look at this now
[1:39:35] people think they must be prayed for
[1:39:37] that's all right we should pray for each
[1:39:38] other or their hands might be or some
[1:39:40] Evangelist hands must be ministered
[1:39:42] that's right that'll bring contact and
[1:39:44] so forth of faith but real unadulterated
[1:39:47] faith is taking God at His Word that's
[1:39:49] the main thing now I've just got to show
[1:39:52] you
[1:39:52] you know God responds a man to different
[1:39:56] face and I want to just kind of
[1:39:59] just-just-just break this down if I can
[1:40:01] when the Centurion came to Jesus a man
[1:40:05] and he said now I'm not worried that you
[1:40:07] should even come underneath my roof he
[1:40:09] says but if you would just speak the
[1:40:10] word only and my servant will be made
[1:40:12] whole
[1:40:13] you know what the manservant was made
[1:40:16] whole because of his faith but God
[1:40:20] didn't let me just put this way God then
[1:40:22] required that all of us got 1/2
[1:40:24] Centurion faith some of us may have
[1:40:27] spoken word faith but some may not be
[1:40:30] able to get it up to that level but just
[1:40:31] just ask something oh my let me just go
[1:40:35] a little further there was a man that
[1:40:37] was sick of the policy oh my god the man
[1:40:42] was sick of the boss he was paralyzed
[1:40:44] right and not now all that what would
[1:40:47] happen him is that his friends began to
[1:40:49] tell him what had happened the last time
[1:40:52] Jesus came to town the last time this
[1:40:56] man passed through something happened
[1:40:58] and I heard that he's having service
[1:41:00] again tonight at so-and-so's house right
[1:41:04] so since they said well if he don't be
[1:41:07] at saltos house I better get myself some
[1:41:09] how to solve those house now I'm sick of
[1:41:12] the palsy I'm paralyzed I can't pick
[1:41:13] myself up so his friends picked him up
[1:41:16] and put him on the bed and carried him
[1:41:18] to church that's why I'm inviting y'all
[1:41:21] to bring people to church next week if
[1:41:23] you know they need something from God
[1:41:25] get him here to the presence of God if
[1:41:30] you got to pick them up and carry them
[1:41:31] then pick them up and carry him amen if
[1:41:34] you got to go put them in your car put
[1:41:36] them in your car whatever you gonna do
[1:41:37] get the people here to the presence of
[1:41:39] God
[1:41:39] here they come caring that their friend
[1:41:42] the church and they get there to church
[1:41:44] was packed I would love to have a
[1:41:46] situation like that so bad I mean it's
[1:41:49] so packed that nobody could get in so
[1:41:51] sort of sick with the membered cyclic
[1:41:52] process now his faith thing got
[1:41:54] elevators he's coming he's free and all
[1:41:55] the testimonies what Jesus did it's an
[1:41:57] iron I'm not gonna let this pass me by
[1:42:01] no I'm gonna make sure I get in on this
[1:42:04] hallelujah see that sometimes a wave
[1:42:07] will come through and amen and there's a
[1:42:09] wave of faith that's coming through the
[1:42:10] church right now I hope
[1:42:12] everybody would get in on this glory to
[1:42:15] God but you know he said no I hadn't
[1:42:18] come this far say man I'm not I'm not
[1:42:21] I'm not taking no for an answer I need
[1:42:23] to have Jesus do something special for
[1:42:26] me and as they brought him you know
[1:42:28] there to the house and you know and
[1:42:29] they've realized that he said man we
[1:42:31] can't get you in we tried our best but
[1:42:33] you know we can't get Jim he said well
[1:42:35] you know do me a favor once that's it
[1:42:38] taking me up to the roof now what we
[1:42:40] gonna do here in the roof man you mean
[1:42:42] you know he can't see you but don't
[1:42:44] worry just just take me up there to the
[1:42:46] roof if you don't mind just just do that
[1:42:47] for me you brought me this far don't
[1:42:49] drop me here just take me to the roof
[1:42:51] they get them up to the roof and you
[1:42:54] know an innocent listen now what what do
[1:42:55] you want us to do see they think that
[1:42:57] don't run out they thought if we just
[1:42:59] got them amen to the meeting and maybe
[1:43:01] get them inside then then it'll be taken
[1:43:03] care but but they said no even though I
[1:43:05] can't get in I can still find the way
[1:43:07] somehow to get Jesus attention Jesus is
[1:43:11] sitting there explaining amen answering
[1:43:13] questions and all these other things
[1:43:15] that he's talking but all of a sudden a
[1:43:17] man up there the roof they begin to tear
[1:43:20] this soften and tear that often and tear
[1:43:23] this time for there's some stuff you got
[1:43:24] to tear that off it and tear this off
[1:43:27] damn I'll tell you unbelief often you're
[1:43:30] doubting and whatever it is that's
[1:43:31] hindering you from getting into the
[1:43:33] presence of God tell anything off they
[1:43:37] begin to tear it off and Jesus looked up
[1:43:40] and the Bible say Jesus solved their
[1:43:42] things Jesus saw their faith and I love
[1:43:47] that because your faith can call
[1:43:48] somebody else to get healed
[1:43:51] Jesus saw their faith and when Jesus saw
[1:43:56] their faith he was moved by it
[1:43:58] here come this man being let down out of
[1:44:01] the roof right into the presence of
[1:44:03] Almighty God and this man got up off his
[1:44:07] bed and he walked home carried his own
[1:44:09] bed home oh I wish we had some people
[1:44:11] that can believe God for that they'll
[1:44:13] carry their own bed home you'll push
[1:44:15] your own wheelchair
[1:44:20] come on our God is still God but that
[1:44:24] was that was another type of faith that
[1:44:25] he honored the woman with the issue of
[1:44:27] blood this was a different faith her
[1:44:30] face said I don't need him to talk to me
[1:44:32] I don't even need him to pray for me I
[1:44:35] don't need him to even look at me I
[1:44:38] don't need any of that
[1:44:39] I don't you got to understand the
[1:44:44] condition that she was in nobody could
[1:44:45] touch her she was ostracized because of
[1:44:49] her condition
[1:44:50] 12 years ostracized kid not a man I mean
[1:44:53] it was really bad but she said you know
[1:44:55] even though the Lord might say they
[1:44:57] can't touch me
[1:44:58] but it didn't I say I couldn't touch
[1:45:00] them and her faint said if I could just
[1:45:06] touch the hem of His garment and the
[1:45:10] Bible said she came from behind she came
[1:45:14] from behind and she resounded just got a
[1:45:17] little touch Amen maybe maybe just
[1:45:20] enough maybe even even realized you know
[1:45:22] I mean it was so strong that he could
[1:45:25] feel it's coming coming - nothing like
[1:45:27] that just virtue left his body and when
[1:45:32] she touched in church when she just
[1:45:35] returned she walked away and she when
[1:45:37] she was going on her own and then going
[1:45:39] back to the house but she say if I can
[1:45:40] touch him I know that I will be made
[1:45:43] whole but before she could get back home
[1:45:46] the think that everything stopped Jesus
[1:45:48] say who touched me who touched me now
[1:45:52] you know he was on his way to go touch I
[1:45:54] mean go go heal somebody else daughter
[1:45:56] Tyra's had thought about this lady
[1:45:58] stopped him in the middle of his of his
[1:46:00] of his journey he say who touched me say
[1:46:02] Peter said not all these people touching
[1:46:05] you how you gonna say some license not
[1:46:06] my PDA lunder stand virtue just left my
[1:46:08] body somebody touched me with faith it's
[1:46:15] a different touch so I'm not some some
[1:46:16] people touching a man like like folk
[1:46:19] trying to get an autograph
[1:46:20] that's the way they touch you know Jesus
[1:46:22] told ya jeez oh Jesus yeah yeah you know
[1:46:25] my god and they leave and go back home
[1:46:28] and say I touched Jesus but now did you
[1:46:31] really touch
[1:46:32] Jesus well she say who touch me they
[1:46:40] start looking around saying he's a
[1:46:41] caller I say what was it Oh Lord I've
[1:46:45] been dealing something for 12 years 12
[1:46:48] years I didn't know I'm spit up all my
[1:46:50] money
[1:46:50] doctors have tried to help me they
[1:46:52] couldn't help me I did everything I
[1:46:53] could and I just say it within my heart
[1:46:55] but if I could just touch the hem of
[1:46:56] your garment I'll be made whole he said
[1:46:58] go and be made whole your faith has made
[1:47:00] you whole
[1:47:01] see how faith was different from front
[1:47:03] from speak the word only faith her faith
[1:47:05] was if I can't touch the hem of His
[1:47:07] garment gyres faith didn't gyrus gyrus
[1:47:11] wasn't a man that half a percent if you
[1:47:14] just speak the word only my daughter
[1:47:16] race no gyrus say I need you to come to
[1:47:18] my house but when Jesus got to his house
[1:47:21] and pray for his daughter his daughter
[1:47:23] was raised
[1:47:23] everybody faith might be a little
[1:47:25] different but it's still faith oh my god
[1:47:30] the seer Phoenician woman right I mean
[1:47:34] she got there and her faith was like oh
[1:47:36] my Jesus gave her a hard time I just you
[1:47:42] know just bear with me she's gay you
[1:47:44] know I'm not sent to t32 your kind you
[1:47:49] Gentiles I'm not sent to y'all and she
[1:47:52] say she say say say you know yeah I know
[1:47:55] but you know I know you the only one
[1:47:57] that can help my daughter so I'm coming
[1:47:59] at you asking you for help I need I need
[1:48:01] some help
[1:48:01] you say look say not even you know we
[1:48:05] not giving nothing to the dogs this is
[1:48:07] this is the children's bread it's not
[1:48:09] for dogs now y'all know the current day
[1:48:12] version of the seer phoenician woman
[1:48:14] would have been a no you didn't but not
[1:48:18] her her faith was like now I understand
[1:48:21] you right we're called dogs you say but
[1:48:24] she said even the dogs even dogs can get
[1:48:29] crumbs from the master's table and Jesus
[1:48:34] was so penetrated by her faith he said
[1:48:37] you know what
[1:48:37] you know I say you said woman great is
[1:48:39] your faith great is your faith and
[1:48:43] because you got great faith go find it
[1:48:45] the way that you acts
[1:48:46] see everybody has something different
[1:48:49] that they was dealing with never on
[1:48:50] approached but they all had some level
[1:48:53] of faith we're gonna need that Church we
[1:48:58] don't need that let me just read a
[1:48:59] couple statements here brother Branham
[1:49:01] made this statement I just want to these
[1:49:03] are about 13 statements I want to make
[1:49:05] of what brother Graham said faith is or
[1:49:07] even the Bible the Bible says now faith
[1:49:09] is the substance of things hoped for the
[1:49:11] evidence of things not seen
[1:49:12] that's what that's what Hebrews 11:1
[1:49:14] tells us brother Branham said now faith
[1:49:16] is a direct evidence of things not seen
[1:49:19] it's a direct evidence of things not
[1:49:22] felt taste smell or heard your faith is
[1:49:26] a direct evidence right faith is of God
[1:49:29] say God got a drop faith down inside of
[1:49:32] you God got to give it to you Amen
[1:49:34] hallelujah
[1:49:36] says how he says faith is something
[1:49:37] that's just as calm and settled as it
[1:49:40] can be
[1:49:41] Amen it's taking God at His Word and
[1:49:43] having the insurance in your heart that
[1:49:45] God is able to keep what he said that he
[1:49:47] would do and will perform at everything
[1:49:49] that he said he would do he says faith
[1:49:51] is a positive sense man see whatever
[1:49:55] sister had to give the negative away
[1:49:57] from her because when you got faith you
[1:50:00] can't talk negative faith is a faith is
[1:50:04] only positive it's not negative faith is
[1:50:06] a positive since it's not a guest work
[1:50:10] listen he says you don't just imagine it
[1:50:13] it's just as real as any other sense
[1:50:16] your body just the same as sides-- can I
[1:50:20] just give you an example of that what
[1:50:23] colors my shirt everybody says why is
[1:50:29] there anybody here think my shirt blue
[1:50:32] anybody think it's great
[1:50:34] pink anybody all right so everybody say
[1:50:37] it's white now you leave Church and the
[1:50:40] action now what color was brother Jack
[1:50:42] shirt
[1:50:42] what were you saying now no matter how
[1:50:45] much time I might try to convince you
[1:50:47] that with some other color you know by
[1:50:48] your own sight by your own sight you
[1:50:53] know what color the shirt is and no
[1:50:56] matter and if somebody comes to you to
[1:50:58] try to tell you that the show
[1:50:59] was any other kind of color you wouldn't
[1:51:01] even argue with them well argue with you
[1:51:04] doctor
[1:51:06] why argue with your friends when you
[1:51:09] know you have seen it yourself this is
[1:51:13] your personal experience
[1:51:15] you ain't got to argue it nobody I saw
[1:51:19] that this week we were doing something
[1:51:22] and one of the brothers was going
[1:51:23] through a little something and and
[1:51:24] everybody know you better watch this you
[1:51:26] better watch this he just got quiet
[1:51:28] online bang where my faith is my faith
[1:51:30] is somewhere else and he just kind of
[1:51:32] got quiet he just let them argue he just
[1:51:34] got quiet I just watched you just got
[1:51:36] quiet all right
[1:51:39] see I'm a team when you stop talking it
[1:51:42] they're gonna stop talking don't sit
[1:51:47] there and argue with little buddy when
[1:51:49] you got faith on the inside God does
[1:51:52] showed you something you gotta argue
[1:51:53] with no party it's a personal revelation
[1:52:02] okay all right all right let's change
[1:52:04] subjects two days ladies sent me a
[1:52:07] little text to say I told you what I was
[1:52:10] believing out for is exactly what I got
[1:52:12] I ain't taking what they say I got it
[1:52:16] they stole a see that might have been
[1:52:22] your experience but then ain't gonna be
[1:52:24] my experience can I tell y'all something
[1:52:26] no they gotta accept something because
[1:52:29] its genetic you ain't gonna take it
[1:52:34] because so let's go ahead and let's run
[1:52:37] through the family maybe some of your
[1:52:39] family won't come about the blood of
[1:52:41] Jesus but because you have been covered
[1:52:44] you ain't gonna accept it get it back to
[1:52:50] the devil don't take it get it back to
[1:52:52] the devil there's power in the blood
[1:52:56] Church you know sitting there when mama
[1:53:03] was was going through what she was going
[1:53:04] through there and in jeffersonville it
[1:53:08] thought came back to me
[1:53:11] I remember mama actually going through
[1:53:13] something there's like cancerous in her
[1:53:15] body as well her my daddy went away for
[1:53:19] a trip on the west coast and was just
[1:53:21] there in their room just praying about
[1:53:22] this thing that that was there in my
[1:53:24] body and just trying to figure out what
[1:53:27] they was gonna do to handle it
[1:53:28] you know and some kind of way I don't
[1:53:30] know how it happened but while they were
[1:53:33] there praying mama noticed something
[1:53:35] just just don't you know I think it's
[1:53:37] right there on her neck so I'm kind of
[1:53:38] waiting and she's just begin to push a
[1:53:40] little bit just push and that thing that
[1:53:44] was growing inside my body came out came
[1:53:48] out and she never dealt with that thing
[1:53:51] anymore that growth came out and I began
[1:53:58] to thing I said I seen God do this for
[1:53:59] mama before I say now he can do the same
[1:54:01] thing for her again sometimes when you
[1:54:03] when you when you working with people
[1:54:05] you got to remind them of what God did
[1:54:07] and sometimes you you need to you need
[1:54:10] to remind yourself of what God did that
[1:54:12] way now you can pray for the person I
[1:54:15] got a quote up here I can't read them
[1:54:17] all but you know we talk about gifts of
[1:54:20] healing you know brother Branham say
[1:54:22] every pastor has a gift of healing then
[1:54:25] he went further than that he said every
[1:54:27] person you have a gift of healing you
[1:54:34] have it if you say he said cuz that's
[1:54:37] what the Bible said if you just lay
[1:54:38] hands oh I'm trying to get them if you
[1:54:41] just lay hands on the stick they shall
[1:54:43] recover that it didn't even say pray for
[1:54:45] them just lay hands Oh God listen listen
[1:54:52] to this faith is a positive fist it's
[1:54:54] not a guesswork you just don't imagine
[1:54:56] it it's just as real as any other
[1:54:58] sensitive body just the same as sinusite
[1:55:00] is real hearing is real see taste feel
[1:55:03] smell hear the five senses of the body
[1:55:06] that control the body
[1:55:07] they're real faculties to you if none of
[1:55:10] them is injured and then and then faith
[1:55:12] is just as real as any of the other five
[1:55:15] senses and more real because it'll go in
[1:55:19] and above those five senses listen faith
[1:55:22] is long-range vision I like
[1:55:27] and then not knowing the other thing
[1:55:28] that brother Bevan say he says faith it
[1:55:30] don't lower its sights
[1:55:32] you know Abraham got stronger the longer
[1:55:36] he waited his faith got stronger his
[1:55:39] faith increased the longer he waited you
[1:55:41] know the longer I wait the greater the
[1:55:43] miracle that's just that's the way it's
[1:55:45] gonna be
[1:55:46] faith is long range miss an adult law
[1:55:48] recites it holds to the target faith is
[1:55:50] a sixth sense in a sense with faith
[1:55:54] really histor heart it doesn't have to
[1:55:56] be a spontaneous miracle when faith
[1:56:02] really hits the heart and that's where
[1:56:04] the devil give us come on y'all know
[1:56:07] that devil you get pray fun oh it's
[1:56:09] still there
[1:56:10] but that's not faith basically I was
[1:56:13] prayed for and the prayer of faith will
[1:56:14] save the sick and God gonna raise me up
[1:56:16] so I don't care about it still being
[1:56:17] that it's gonna go it's leaving amen
[1:56:21] it's leaving hallelujah faith when it
[1:56:24] when it really hits to heart it don't it
[1:56:26] doesn't have to be a spontaneous miracle
[1:56:28] he says this faith faith is a conqueror
[1:56:33] faith amen is it is an overcomer Amen
[1:56:38] faith is the victory that overcomes the
[1:56:40] world he goes on to say that she says
[1:56:42] faith is a law of God the same thing all
[1:56:46] this power of God that we're tenth we're
[1:56:48] talking about is accessible to us by
[1:56:51] faith all things are possible say to
[1:56:55] this mountain be moving it on down to
[1:56:56] your heart believe what you say it come
[1:56:58] to pass you can have it accessible if
[1:57:00] you've got the law there it is the law
[1:57:02] see the law is faith that controls all
[1:57:05] things he says this perfect faith is a
[1:57:09] master of all circumstances
[1:57:12] I like that not just some circumstances
[1:57:15] perfect faith is a master of all
[1:57:17] circumstances perfect faith not just all
[1:57:19] circumstance now now what what what no
[1:57:23] matter what it is it masters it now just
[1:57:26] watch when you believe in anything do
[1:57:28] anything you got faith in what you're
[1:57:30] doing no matter what the circumstance is
[1:57:31] that don't have one thing to do with it
[1:57:33] see it masters that circumstance it's in
[1:57:36] a room of sickness and the Lord's
[1:57:38] revealed that this certain things going
[1:57:40] happen you just speak it and go on
[1:57:41] that's faith Luke you can only have
[1:57:45] faith as God gives you faith faith is a
[1:57:47] gift of God ever how religious him you
[1:57:50] may be you must have faith in your faith
[1:57:53] can only rest if you're Christian upon
[1:57:55] the proven Word of God it says faith is
[1:58:00] something that's revealed to you that is
[1:58:01] not yet but you believe it will be faith
[1:58:03] is a revelation of the wheel of God all
[1:58:08] right let me um I wanted to slip over to
[1:58:11] something here and and before I do that
[1:58:14] one last quote out of faith is our
[1:58:15] victory I'm at paragraph 23 I just my
[1:58:20] goal is to build faith faith is
[1:58:24] necessary for the translation if we
[1:58:26] ain't got faith that God can bring him
[1:58:28] you know brother branham self a person
[1:58:30] did not believe in divine healing they
[1:58:32] would not make the rapture if they
[1:58:36] didn't believe it now it's one thing you
[1:58:39] know we know that there's been some
[1:58:40] people that's been sick and wasn't
[1:58:42] healed but that didn't mean that they
[1:58:43] didn't believe in healing just because I
[1:58:47] mean the doctor did lose it didn't lose
[1:58:49] his license when his patient died dr.
[1:58:54] Tolley was like actually he get more
[1:58:55] patients after his patient dies right
[1:58:59] amen so our God gonna lose any
[1:59:01] credibility if somebody passed away amen
[1:59:05] he don't lose no credibility he's still
[1:59:07] God I mean there's there's many that
[1:59:09] I've gone down in faith believe in God
[1:59:11] and that faith that they went down is
[1:59:14] the same faith that's gonna raise them
[1:59:16] up and change their bodies alright
[1:59:20] church amen so I mean whatever you do
[1:59:23] you just keep having faith I remember
[1:59:24] one preacher say if he was praying for
[1:59:26] the sick and one drop dead why he was
[1:59:29] praying for him he just stepped over the
[1:59:30] top of them and pray for the next one
[1:59:33] that's faith that's tell the devil he
[1:59:35] ain't gonna get love no no credit no
[1:59:37] glory nothing
[1:59:39] we're not even considering anything all
[1:59:42] right Church look at this brother
[1:59:43] Branham says in faith this victory says
[1:59:45] now faith is a conqueror faith is an
[1:59:47] overcomer it's just a peacemaker it
[1:59:51] overcomes faith is the victor
[1:59:53] overcomes the world what does it do what
[1:59:55] is faith what is the conquer a conquer
[1:59:58] and conquer and victory is the same to
[2:00:01] conquer it means to beat down your faith
[2:00:07] is what's conquering that means your
[2:00:08] faith is beating down oh lord have mercy
[2:00:12] okay you can get a devil a beat down
[2:00:16] just by quoting scripture after
[2:00:18] scripture just get beat the devil down
[2:00:22] to it means to beat down the
[2:00:25] override to handcuff to throw into
[2:00:30] prisons it means that the thing that
[2:00:32] once rule you you rule it now it means
[2:00:37] that you have overcome you've whipped it
[2:00:39] you're greater than it is oh I feel
[2:00:43] religious right now says which was first
[2:00:46] to sit on Savior I save you for us
[2:00:48] figure is more powerful than a sin which
[2:00:51] was first of the healer or a sickness
[2:00:54] it couldn't be a healer unless it was
[2:00:57] over the sickness it is a healer it
[2:01:00] could conquer the sickness and faith is
[2:01:03] the victory that overcomes every curse
[2:01:07] of the devil faith is the victory faith
[2:01:12] overcomes your genetic disorders you
[2:01:16] ain't got to take it just because it
[2:01:17] passed through your family your family
[2:01:19] didn't have the revelation that you got
[2:01:21] hey man I know they had that kind of
[2:01:24] trouble but they ain't got the same
[2:01:25] faith that you got they didn't have
[2:01:27] nothing to fight with
[2:01:28] I mean even even science improves they
[2:01:34] get they got better medicines that they
[2:01:36] go to and all those types of things so
[2:01:38] we got different things that we can we
[2:01:39] can fight stuff that other people I mean
[2:01:41] used to be a time women died having
[2:01:43] babies soon as they have it they did
[2:01:45] that but we don't we don't found a way
[2:01:46] to overcome that type of stuff science
[2:01:48] has found a way to overcome that right I
[2:01:51] mean in the science gonna prove what
[2:01:52] about us as a church amen as a spiritual
[2:01:55] body of Christ we ought to be improving
[2:01:56] in our faith recognizing what God
[2:01:59] promised us but don't live beneath your
[2:02:02] privileges all right let me go here
[2:02:04] let's pick this up because we're talking
[2:02:05] about aligning
[2:02:06] faith and and there was this thought
[2:02:08] here out of second Kings chapter 4 let's
[2:02:15] just pick that up in and I'll try to
[2:02:16] bring this home second Kings chapter 4
[2:02:20] what was what was going on here in this
[2:02:23] particular story if we don't we won't
[2:02:25] have time to read the whole thing but in
[2:02:28] in the first part of this chapter we
[2:02:30] have a lady that was I would call a poor
[2:02:34] eighth man and and and and she was going
[2:02:37] through a little something in her house
[2:02:39] she had kind of run into some got into
[2:02:41] some debt and as she fell into debt she
[2:02:44] was looking for a way to get out of it
[2:02:45] she went to the the prophet and the
[2:02:48] prophet gave her you know something said
[2:02:50] go and borrow some you know some vessels
[2:02:52] and fill it up with oil and then sell it
[2:02:54] he said he'd say borrows many as you can
[2:02:56] borrow as many as you can from your
[2:02:58] friends and and said then just just go
[2:03:00] fill it up with oil and then sell that
[2:03:01] and and when she went and sold it did
[2:03:04] exactly what the prophet told to do not
[2:03:06] only did she pay her debt off she ended
[2:03:09] up with an abundance right she ended up
[2:03:12] with an overflow glory to God I hope you
[2:03:15] caught that because the some of us are
[2:03:17] in debt while we got to do is what God
[2:03:19] tell us is doing not only we pay the
[2:03:20] debt off we'll end up in overflow and I
[2:03:24] don't know about you but I'm moving from
[2:03:26] that I'm moving from debt to overflowing
[2:03:31] I'm gonna follow the Word of God
[2:03:33] whatever you tell me to do I'm gonna do
[2:03:35] and I'm moving from debt to overflow
[2:03:38] hallelujah some night but but you know
[2:03:41] that that happened at the beginning of
[2:03:42] chapter but then we get later on a
[2:03:44] chapter there was a wealthy woman but
[2:03:47] she had a problem and she and this
[2:03:50] problem this lady had had no children
[2:03:52] but but the thing about this later is
[2:03:54] that she was very you know very kind to
[2:03:59] God's prophet and and what she did you
[2:04:02] know she actually uh she told her
[2:04:04] husband say you know I perceived that
[2:04:06] this is a man of God as he's passing
[2:04:08] through the city I perceived that this
[2:04:10] is a man of God she said she said let's
[2:04:12] do something let's build a room on our
[2:04:13] house and let's let's put a bed in there
[2:04:16] and let's put a little a little couch or
[2:04:18] something
[2:04:19] just let the mana man let the man a guy
[2:04:21] rest at our house
[2:04:22] he gotta stay at a hotel when he come to
[2:04:24] this city I want the man of God to rest
[2:04:27] at my house hallelujah glory to God amen
[2:04:32] we got to be able to do that now

[2:04:36] places we ought to have a room ready for
[2:04:38] some Saints to let them in we want the
[2:04:42] people of God to rest in our house oh
[2:04:46] Jesus glory to God a man see if we can

[2:07:52] the people of God gotta make sure you
[2:07:53] always have plenty so you can be a
[2:07:56] blessing see if you're doing it just for
[2:07:58] yourself nothing but when you decide
[2:08:01] that Lord I'm doing this for your people
[2:08:03] watch god bless you this lady was
[2:08:08] wealthy and she decided to do that so
[2:08:10] the prophet saw the kindness that this
[2:08:12] lady brought to him and and and and and
[2:08:16] not only him his servant they have
[2:08:17] always had a place to go to and they
[2:08:19] came to that city they have to worry
[2:08:21] about no hotel stay they had a room
[2:08:22] dedicated to them so when the prophet
[2:08:26] saw discount and say you know what can I
[2:08:28] do for for you she said you know I don't
[2:08:30] I don't need
[2:08:32] I'm good I'm good only nothing well the
[2:08:35] Prophet looked at the survey what can we
[2:08:37] do for her
[2:08:37] he couldn't even think of what to do fun
[2:08:39] he's just receiving so much kindness he
[2:08:41] wanting to bless it back I'm gonna tell
[2:08:43] you something
[2:08:43] that's the secret to getting a blessing
[2:08:45] be a blessing but but as you know he
[2:08:53] said what can I do for what can I do
[2:08:55] well you know children oh that's a good
[2:08:59] call the lady always say and you know at
[2:09:02] the time of life you're gonna have a son
[2:09:04] you cannot just have a child you're
[2:09:06] gonna have a son told exactly what she
[2:09:09] was gonna have all right don't play
[2:09:13] games with me don't get me all worked up
[2:09:17] because we have been trying to have
[2:09:17] children for years and I never had

[2:09:21] the time of life you're gonna have
[2:09:22] enough you gonna have a child and here
[2:09:24] it comes it you know later on
[2:09:26] the lady gave birth to the son prophet
[2:09:29] still you know are going to and fro and
[2:09:31] and and here brother branham say the boy
[2:09:34] got about 12 years old the same boy
[2:09:36] about 12 years old and there he was out
[2:09:38] in the field and there was a heat stroke
[2:09:41] that hit and the boys started getting
[2:09:43] headaches and and he went to complaining

[2:09:47] what's going on daddy I don't know and
[2:09:49] the dad it's just seven back to the mama

[2:09:56] and and dad like I don't know what to do
[2:09:57] with this boy he just walk in the flow

[2:10:21] go go see him you know but but she said
[2:10:23] she said no no everything gonna be all
[2:10:24] right I'm going to see the Prophet not
[2:10:27] now that lady had a faith that lady had
[2:10:31] a faith in and when we when we talk
[2:10:33] about a lot in the faith what you look
[2:10:35] at is you know this woman went to see
[2:10:37] the property she made a statement she
[2:10:38] told us a night as we on our way even
[2:10:41] though the riot might get uncomfortable
[2:10:44] even a riot might get a little hard
[2:10:47] sometimes you go through things in life
[2:10:49] it gets a little uncomfortable but she
[2:10:51] told us she told the service they don't
[2:10:53] slack - right I know it's a little hard
[2:10:58] right now but I ain't going nowhere
[2:11:00] imma be right in church today man don't
[2:11:03] slack the ride for me just just get me
[2:11:08] to the Prophet get me to the Prophet and
[2:11:10] brother branham was saying how you know
[2:11:12] when she got there to the Prophet and
[2:11:14] you know if say God it never showed the
[2:11:16] property life should what was going on
[2:11:18] he looked I said that's that shooter my
[2:11:20] woman that that sir come and say you
[2:11:21] know it's a garden show said I wonder
[2:11:23] what's the matter with her and say when
[2:11:24] she got there she she win and she
[2:11:26] grabbed the prophets feet and he say she
[2:11:28] say he say it's all well with you and
[2:11:30] your family and her testimony not my my
[2:11:37] son is dead that's not the first thing
[2:11:39] coming out her mouth she say all is well
[2:11:42] no matter what you feeling that's what
[2:11:45] you still got to speak oh this world the
[2:11:52] prophets say okay you know what's going
[2:11:56] on and then she began to telling saying
[2:11:58] I told you action prophet please don't
[2:12:02] play don't play games with my feelings
[2:12:03] my emotions I didn't want this child you
[2:12:08] gave me this child you gave me this
[2:12:11] child and since you gave me this child
[2:12:13] I've done the best I could and raising
[2:12:15] another child is dead and going on an
[2:12:18] iPad I just need to understand what's
[2:12:20] going on I just need some clarity
[2:12:23] privacy okay he gave his little staff to
[2:12:26] his servant gob sitting on the hard to
[2:12:28] go out there and just just touch the
[2:12:30] baby with the staff but the lady looked
[2:12:32] at the staff and it's what brother
[2:12:33] branham say this is what I mean by a
[2:12:35] line in our faith it was brother branham
[2:12:37] saying when he looked at when the lady
[2:12:38] looked at the staff she say the staff
[2:12:40] didn't speak to me
[2:12:45] now you might have confidence in your
[2:12:47] staff your faith is in your staff but my
[2:12:51] faith is in you so the fact that the
[2:12:53] staff did not speak to me the staff
[2:12:56] didn't give me a promise and now he knew
[2:13:00] that whenever he touched was blessed
[2:13:02] that's where his faith was right brother
[2:13:04] Branham said that's that's where we even
[2:13:06] get you know the prayer cloths and
[2:13:08] things and if we get it from that
[2:13:09] scripture right he said whatever he
[2:13:11] touched was blessed but she said no no
[2:13:14] my faith that's why they had to get in
[2:13:15] an alignment oh my god you know i'ma
[2:13:19] just read this real quick he says no he
[2:13:21] say no matter no matter what his faith
[2:13:25] was if the woman's faith wasn't the same
[2:13:27] then it won't work her faith was not in
[2:13:31] the staff and that's why she stayed
[2:13:32] right there to speak say no no no I
[2:13:33] can't I'm not going back with the staff
[2:13:35] but I will go with you and say as the
[2:13:39] Prophet company left we realized that
[2:13:41] the lady wouldn't be was she wasn't
[2:13:42] moving till he moved and as she comes to
[2:13:45] the house brother Branham say she laid
[2:13:47] her son out on the same bed that the
[2:13:49] Prophet laid here now she laid her son
[2:13:52] on that bed that the Prophet laid in she
[2:13:54] just waited waited daddy
[2:13:56] walking in patience not know what to do
[2:13:58] but she just waited and said when the
[2:13:59] Prophet got there brother Branham said
[2:14:00] God did not give him a vision he didn't
[2:14:05] know what to do so what the Prophet did
[2:14:07] was just he went him and laid on the boy
[2:14:09] and when they laid on the boy nothing
[2:14:12] happened but not before he laid on them
[2:14:15] Gazi had already come back and says I
[2:14:17] laid this the staff on him but ain't
[2:14:18] nothing happened with that staff can you
[2:14:20] imagine being the servant of the Prophet
[2:14:22] taking a staff into a dead person and
[2:14:25] laying it on now most of us if we see it
[2:14:29] that person we running the other way but
[2:14:33] he took the staff who say he laid on us
[2:14:35] and now I'm sorry I we've tried and
[2:14:36] nothing worked it's a when the Prophet
[2:14:38] coming he laid on top of the boy and
[2:14:39] nothing happened brother branham save
[2:14:41] just forgetting the pace up and down
[2:14:42] this way you got to be calm when you got
[2:14:44] faith just become just wait on the
[2:14:46] Spirit of God
[2:14:47] wait on the Spirit of God he says as a
[2:14:49] prophet just beginning to wait on spirit
[2:14:50] guy he say he never even prayed but he
[2:14:54] felt led to go back and lay on that boy
[2:14:56] again when the Spirit of God came upon
[2:14:58] and he laid them in the second time and
[2:15:00] when he lay it on my got that boy
[2:15:02] beginning to sneeze first time a little
[2:15:05] warmth came back into his body but this
[2:15:07] time he began to sneeze and the Bible
[2:15:09] say he sneezed seven times hallelujah
[2:15:12] see I like that because the church ages
[2:15:16] we sneeze seven times and it's only
[2:15:18] after the seventh sneeze that we came
[2:15:20] back to life for the random sets and
[2:15:27] things here about this lady in you know
[2:15:31] how faith wasn't in the staff he says it
[2:15:33] depends on where your faith is some
[2:15:36] people let's read this this is a
[2:15:37] paragraph ether tea out of the message
[2:15:39] Elisha and then I got one other quote I
[2:15:41] think I want to read after that he says
[2:15:44] this it says and so Elijah girded up his
[2:15:48] lorentz and where he went without a
[2:15:49] vision not knowing what to do in a way
[2:15:53] they went Ghazi beat them he went ahead
[2:15:56] went into the room and laid the staff
[2:15:58] upon the baby weight at no life come
[2:16:00] baby still dead
[2:16:01] it turns around looks awhile still the
[2:16:03] baby was dead so he picks up the staff
[2:16:05] and runs back in meets Elijah and the
[2:16:07] shunammite woman coming woman coming and
[2:16:10] so when he did he said I laid the staff
[2:16:12] upon the baby and there was no life no
[2:16:13] breath he didn't open his eyes he's
[2:16:15] still dead so that's the report so see
[2:16:19] the woman's faith wasn't in the staff it
[2:16:21] was in the prophet now it depends on
[2:16:23] where your faith is some people said
[2:16:26] you've got to have hands laid on you the
[2:16:28] other said Roman said just speak the
[2:16:30] word of my son shall live and yet the
[2:16:31] woman didn't want him to lay hands on
[2:16:34] her she just touched his touched His
[2:16:36] garment and little gyrus and a few
[2:16:38] nights ago and in the lesson why he said
[2:16:40] come lay your hands on my daughter it
[2:16:42] depends on where your faith lays and
[2:16:45] what I want you to get from that got
[2:16:47] them meet you right where your faith is
[2:16:50] it depends on where your faith lays so
[2:16:53] Elijah was right he says now I believe
[2:16:55] he's just proven but he knew that God
[2:16:58] had blessed whatever he touched you see
[2:16:59] it he believed that God blesses so he
[2:17:02] said God had blessed this and if you lay
[2:17:04] it on the baby I believe that God will
[2:17:06] make it well now no matter what his
[2:17:09] faith was if the woman's
[2:17:11] faith wasn't the same then it won't work
[2:17:14] you see what I mean it takes your faith
[2:17:16] and your passes faith together you to
[2:17:19] have to have got to have the same faith
[2:17:22] and if you believe the same thing that
[2:17:24] the man of God has told you then
[2:17:26] something's got to happen so the man of
[2:17:29] God believed that he wouldn't have to go
[2:17:31] over there he would just send the staff
[2:17:33] but the woman said no no no I going to
[2:17:37] stay right with you I'm gonna stay right
[2:17:39] here till I find out
[2:17:41] so then gajala said there's no breath in
[2:17:43] the baby he's still dead so away they
[2:17:46] went coming to the yard and now look at
[2:17:48] the crowd everybody around a wailing and
[2:17:51] screaming what a place for faith Elijah
[2:17:53] standing there no vision didn't know
[2:17:56] what to do all he could do was look
[2:17:57] around there was a father screamin there
[2:18:00] was all the neighbors and everybody
[2:18:01] carrying on well he goes around his
[2:18:04] little old chamber and the woman had the
[2:18:05] baby laying on the bed so he shut
[2:18:07] everyone out of the room and pulled the
[2:18:10] door together by himself went over in a
[2:18:11] corner knelt down began to pray when he
[2:18:13] got through praying he got up walked up
[2:18:15] and down the floor back and forth to and
[2:18:17] fro up and down the floor until the
[2:18:18] Spirit of God come upon him when the
[2:18:20] Spirit of God come upon him no doubt but
[2:18:22] what he saw a vision goes over stretches
[2:18:25] his stuff on top of the baby his nose
[2:18:27] again again his nose no no prayer notice
[2:18:31] that his nose against his nose
[2:18:33] no prayer just the nose against its nose
[2:18:36] lifts against its lips eyes against its
[2:18:39] eyes hands against his hands and the
[2:18:41] baby sneeze seven times and kind of like
[2:18:44] what was that that wasn't that preacher
[2:18:46] that was Christ in His Prophet that
[2:18:49] brought that baby back to life
[2:18:50] hallelujah oh my when he stood out there
[2:18:54] and said Gahan Zeke all this you know
[2:18:55] mighty man the woman come to the door
[2:18:57] then all the good things that she had
[2:18:59] done little did she know what she had
[2:19:01] that bed made in there for Elijah and
[2:19:04] made his bed with her own hands that
[2:19:07] someday her dead baby would be laying
[2:19:10] there and the body of that prophet
[2:19:13] through the Christ would bring that baby
[2:19:16] back to life again you don't know what's
[2:19:19] happening when you try to do something
[2:19:23] for one another try to help one another
[2:19:26] that's right
[2:19:28] like bread upon the water it'll return
[2:19:31] to you someday
[2:19:37] hallelujah Church one other quote that I
[2:19:40] want to read a man for you and we'll
[2:19:42] close this off today this is the message
[2:19:46] why Christ speak and I'm going back to
[2:19:49] paragraph 47 hallelujah align our faith
[2:19:55] just know that you know it might be
[2:19:58] spoken word to some it might be lay your
[2:20:01] hands for others it's still faith it
[2:20:04] might be touch to him of his garment
[2:20:05] it's still faith and God will honor your
[2:20:09] faith without faith it's impossible to
[2:20:12] please him
[2:20:13] listen now remember when Moses met this
[2:20:16] burning bush the word that word was a
[2:20:18] vindicated exactly it was the word Moses
[2:20:21] didn't have to worry
[2:20:22] what's this voice all about what is what
[2:20:25] is this being here because God had
[2:20:27] already wrote in the scripture in
[2:20:28] Genesis your people are sojourn in the
[2:20:30] strange land but they'll be brought back
[2:20:32] after 400 years we'll come back into
[2:20:35] this country again for the iniquity of
[2:20:37] the Amorite is not yet fulfilled now
[2:20:39] hundreds and hundreds of years before
[2:20:40] God said that God had said that Israel
[2:20:43] was sojourn and mistreated in a strange
[2:20:45] country and would stay there for hundred
[2:20:47] years but God with a mighty hand would
[2:20:48] bring them out so you see with this
[2:20:50] burning bush Moses note this
[2:20:52] intellectually and the seed that was
[2:20:54] born in him was laying in his heart and
[2:20:56] a tribe through his intellectual
[2:20:58] experience with the word to try to bring
[2:21:01] them out to deliver them because he know
[2:21:03] he was born for that purpose he note
[2:21:05] that the time the scriptures all said
[2:21:08] that they had already been there for
[2:21:10] four hundred years
[2:21:11] before I go further I feel the Holy
[2:21:13] Spirit just telling me do not accept
[2:21:15] death don't accept it I mean whatever
[2:21:19] the doctors have said don't you accept
[2:21:22] the report of death take the report of
[2:21:26] faith a man by his stripes your heel
[2:21:30] glory to God just as we know now as a
[2:21:34] man asked me a few moments ago
[2:21:37] about the coming and the rapture we know
[2:21:40] we live the time out at the time of the
[2:21:43] render at the time of the raptures at
[2:21:45] hand and we're looking for a rapturing
[2:21:48] faith
[2:21:49] that can pull the church together and
[2:21:52] give it some supernatural strength that
[2:21:55] can change these bodies that we live in
[2:21:57] when we see a God that can raise the
[2:22:00] dead off the floor or out of the yard
[2:22:02] and bring them back to life again and
[2:22:04] present him before us when we see a God
[2:22:06] who can take a cancer that's eat a man
[2:22:10] to a shout and raise them up a strong
[2:22:11] healthy man that ought to give rapturing
[2:22:15] faith to the people we might not have
[2:22:21] saw a rapture in faith a man take a
[2:22:23] person down to a shadow but I mean
[2:22:24] assaults all cancer take a person down
[2:22:27] to a shadow but we we did see cancer
[2:22:29] heal and that itself ought to produce
[2:22:34] rapture faith see if we can't believe
[2:22:37] God for our bodies to be here how we
[2:22:39] gonna believe God for these bodies to be
[2:22:41] changed so we oughta have week we've
[2:22:43] been preaching it and now we saw the
[2:22:45] manifestation of it and I'm just trying
[2:22:47] to cap it off this is what's gonna
[2:22:49] produce rapture and faith in the people
[2:22:52] says that when the light when that light
[2:22:54] flashes from the sky and the trumpet
[2:22:56] sounds the body of Christ will be
[2:22:58] quickly gathered together and changed in
[2:22:59] a moment and take it into the heavens
[2:23:01] yes there's got to be something like
[2:23:02] that happen and our schools of theology
[2:23:04] can never produce that yet they
[2:23:07] intellectually are alright but you've
[2:23:09] got to meet that light you've got to
[2:23:11] find that something in church I believe
[2:23:14] we found that something a man has been
[2:23:18] laying here all the time we didn't
[2:23:19] realize that like that first quote when
[2:23:22] I first started on the rapture face
[2:23:23] program say I see a woman in the balcony
[2:23:25] she don't realize she got faith she
[2:23:27] don't know she got it they say but
[2:23:29] sister you got it and I'm telling you
[2:23:31] right here the devil been making you
[2:23:33] doubt that that you even got faith yes
[2:23:35] you got it that God didn't bring you
[2:23:38] this father leave you oh yes you got it
[2:23:40] we might have to go through a little
[2:23:42] suffering here and there every once in a
[2:23:43] while I mean I'm preaching y'all about
[2:23:45] faith and I got pain all through my link
[2:23:47] but I'm not I'm not thinking like that
[2:23:50] a manner I just keep applying the
[2:23:52] promises over night advice professor you
[2:23:54] know my faith says I don't have to be in
[2:23:56] spontaneous miracle but it's gonna be a
[2:23:59] miracle one day I'm gonna wake up and
[2:24:01] gonna be no more pain ain't gonna be no
[2:24:04] more pain praise the Lord I got a double
[2:24:07] promise on that a man I got a promise
[2:24:10] that by stripes I'm healed I got another
[2:24:12] promise that my body gonna be changed so
[2:24:14] one way or the other I'm gonna have a
[2:24:16] body with no pain
[2:24:17] I believe that church a man not and I'm
[2:24:22] not sure my faith is not just from my
[2:24:24] body my faith is for every other thing
[2:24:26] in my life my faith this is my family
[2:24:28] hey man I'm not care what I see no it's
[2:24:31] not it's what my faith sees my face see
[2:24:35] my whole family here rejoicing and
[2:24:37] praising God that's that's what my fave
[2:24:38] sing right
[2:24:40] a man church they man we go you know we
[2:24:43] all gonna be changed and I'm declaring
[2:24:46] that every influence is gonna be broken
[2:24:48] in the name of Jesus that you can't see
[2:24:51] nothing but Jesus all right
[2:24:54] amen glory to God we got to align this
[2:24:57] faith church we got to align this faith
[2:25:00] and I believe it is coming and alignment
[2:25:04] you know brother Branham was making a
[2:25:06] statement how if you were going overseas
[2:25:08] on a boat we say really the man that's
[2:25:11] up top he's not controlling the boat the
[2:25:14] captain he's not controlling the boat
[2:25:16] but what he is is what he sees he's
[2:25:18] telling a man down underneath he said
[2:25:20] not to knots to the right he said but if
[2:25:23] man down underneath when he here to not
[2:25:26] stood right and he turned it left they
[2:25:28] say he said he gonna mess up the boat he
[2:25:30] got to follow what the man up at up top
[2:25:32] is telling him praise the Lord and this
[2:25:35] is up top the Word of God is up top it's
[2:25:38] always up top you got to follow what the
[2:25:41] Word of God is telling you if it's a to
[2:25:42] - to the left - to the left
[2:25:44] - to the right - to the right whatever
[2:25:47] the words say that's what we're gonna
[2:25:48] follow we align our faith and we'll make
[2:25:51] it in amen into the other Shore praise
[2:25:54] the Lord
[2:25:55] let's have a word of Prayer my father we
[2:25:58] are so grateful a man for what we have
[2:26:03] thing you do your prophet has told us
[2:26:06] that no church can thrive into the
[2:26:09] supernaturals made known in the midst of
[2:26:11] the people something that they can talk
[2:26:13] to and something that will talk back to
[2:26:14] them and God we have just experienced
[2:26:18] that you you started us on this journey
[2:26:21] with these messages to build faith not
[2:26:24] knowing what we'd be going through but
[2:26:26] God you your anointed us even even when
[2:26:29] the storm came
[2:26:30] we still had a peace that passes all
[2:26:33] understanding that that kept our hearts
[2:26:35] and minds and to know God that not even
[2:26:39] a storm can can hinder this bride not
[2:26:42] even a storm no matter that here that
[2:26:44] the the newscaster sin is the biggest
[2:26:46] storm the worst storm that ever came to
[2:26:49] the coast and God but I thought about
[2:26:53] the people in those little islands where
[2:26:55] could they evacuate to where were they
[2:26:57] going how could they get out there was
[2:26:59] no place to go
[2:27:00] the safe place is in the name of the
[2:27:02] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:27:04] so father we're grateful that we found
[2:27:06] my place of safety and that you got
[2:27:08] provided that to each and every one of
[2:27:10] us we're grateful God that you kept us
[2:27:14] through this time and Lord you just
[2:27:16] anointed my faith I you didn't you
[2:27:19] didn't tell us to speak to the storm you
[2:27:21] didn't tell us to do that we know that
[2:27:22] we have the power to do that we had
[2:27:24] authority to do that but we have to wait
[2:27:26] on you it was you that told the Prophet
[2:27:29] that go back into the Colorado storm and
[2:27:31] you're the one that told him to speak to
[2:27:33] the other why I see what Iran just like
[2:27:35] everybody else ran so what we learn to
[2:27:38] trust you we learn to wait on you we
[2:27:39] learn God that that that the faith that
[2:27:42] you've given us the faith that's used
[2:27:45] anointed is something that brings glory
[2:27:47] and honor back to you
[2:27:49] so father help us look to align our
[2:27:51] faith with your work and God as we said
[2:27:55] there's it might be speak to worried
[2:27:57] only it might be coming lay your hands
[2:27:59] on my daughter it might be if I could
[2:28:01] just touch the hem of His garment it
[2:28:03] could be in it Lord but but whatever it
[2:28:05] is let us just have faith Lord and your
[2:28:08] promise Noor and father that you are
[2:28:10] gonna make all things well
