Cameron Dean thank you for helping me I I I show the crucifier name real quick it don't take but a second you know we got a lot of college grads in here they do a better job at it but uh unfortunately I'm not one of them let's let's turn in the book of uh St John amen this morning chapter 6 we appreciate uh the brothers for assisting me I got here this morning and uh my computer last night it seemed like it was full this morning it had 3% power I like oh lord lord I pushed the panic button I was stopping people to pocket like man you got a C somebody but we finally we finally got it together and I'm grateful it's just been a trying week my cars was down I was stuck at home for two days told my son boy that's unusual even if I don't go to work I have to at least go to town one time a day it's hard to just stay in the do in the house but M cat needed an alternator and the truck the brakes we worked on them but we needed a piece so it it's been it's been crazy it's been absolutely crazy but by God's grace I was going to ride with brother Capers them this morning if I had to but I said I got to be here cuz brother Jack trusted the service to me and he's out of the country uh he'd had to call somebody if I wouldn't have made it all these preachers up in here somebody would have brought brought a word I just had to catch it but by God's grace I'm here so let's remember brother Jack and uh brother Solomon brother Diggs they look like they having a wonderful wonderful time uh in Australia let me see what did I say four St John chapter 4 verse six y'all pray for me I I feel feel a little nervous but by the grace of God we'll be all right it says the sixth verse he says now Jacob's Well was there Jesus therefore being uh weary with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour and there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water and Jesus said unto her give me the drink uh for his disciples were gone away until to the city to buy meat then said the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew asks it drink of me which is a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the samarians Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knoweth the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou would not have asked him and he would have given thee Living Water the woman said unto him sir thou H has nothing to draw with and the well is deep for w then has has thou that Living Water art thou greater than our father Jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle and Jesus answered and said unto her who soever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I have given him shall never thirst but the water that I give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life and the woman said unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw and Jesus said unto her go call thy husband and come hither may the Lord out a blessing to his word this morning you may be seat may be seated uh this morning IID like to uh use as a topic um un understanding what it means to be redeemable uh we we realize that we're we're coming down to the close of uh another year this probably be my last sermon for the year but uh we we've had a a just some wonderful studies on on Redemption and and restoration and uh the Brethren bringing the word through their their different perspectives and and uh uh the pastor bringing his his points just trying to seow seeds to uh make sure that we're in the word is that right and uh just watching the supernatural uh uh moving amongst us people being being healed and uh you know gifts and operation and uh I believe that you know uh when the prophet was on the scene the different ones they they talk to the prophet about his teachings and everything and and the gifts and stuff like that moving in the body and uh he said it was kind of like for for a day gone by these things just only uh happened through the ministry of the Apostles well brother brownon makes a statement I think that's astounding he said well I can show you where Jesus placed these things in there you show me a scripture where he ever took things out is that right we we know the the understanding and the mentality of humanity takes things out they take things away we we if if you have any sort of understanding you could see where uh Society and and christiandom um of today has taken so much away from the word and and the word has pretty much lost its its meaning it's pretty much lost its Effectiveness and I think that's been a part that was I ain't thinking I know that that was a what uh Malachi for's Ministry was to bring back all of the things things that that were in the alpha church and the Omega Church can we say amen amen um and thinking about this this thought this morning um you know I I'm real different I guess in my approach to the word of God and what I see and and and and uh how you know I move I guess it's just my experiences and being around um being around Church from Brother Wesco to brother James and and uh ministering on my own for 20 some years you know you a lot of things I'm not moved by you know I shout if you I get excited and things of that nature but I re I realize at the end of the day things has got to go further than that is that right that's a part of it we not going to take that out of it even the prophet was a he was a real critic of of all of the emot isms and things of that nature till one day he got happy in church right amen and so I like to be happy in church cuz I that's how I grew up I was talking to a guy in Golden Corral um on last night he works there and he always give me a free meal pass and I be like thank you Jesus and uh I told him I said man the other night uh I saw you on the vide one of the churches uh they were on Facebook book and he was in the crowd they was having some celebration for 100 Years of the church and he was sitting there they just he would by he was turning around and he was looking lost he said yeah man my wife church he said man I grew up Pentecostal y'all know you know it's it's a little bit more it's a little bit different now you do have some Baptist churches and you got some Methodist churches they know how to get it in they ain't all starchy and but they do have a lot of formalities and and different things but Pentecostals you know of the old days they they just knew how to get in the spirit you know I saw that that sister last week she was she was Boy look like she was ready to tear the building down I I don't know who she I think one of the Saints brought I said now see she she got something you know they asked the prophet uh about that well and and yeah what's what's causing you to Bubble he say it was something oh y'all ought to preach with me this morning I'm I'm moving slow this morning because I got to get the Flesh and the spirit to preach cuz I'm I'm a little woozy and tired and a little everything but you know I feel like brother Brandon with the 80y old man once the spirit of God hit him he jumped up in the air and it just and after a while I might be down this AIS I ain't going to stand on a chair them days is over with I have to be real anointed to do that uh I seen brother Kenny caps uh in a meeting somewhere and uh he was standing on the chair and uh it was brother Dana and a bunch of them was in the background and he was on the chair but he a lot smaller than me too and uh one of the young Brothers eased up beside him and just was like yeah he like I got it brother I got it I got it you got it till you don't you know but he he had it but uh you know my my Approach and my objective is is that we we we we want we want for people to be stable to be anchored to have a a a clear understanding of of what you got right who who's your Association and and why you associating you know what I'm saying be because there there's so much instability right but but you you you want and I believe that's been brother Jack's objective is to make sure that we're clear that that this word is not a mystery because all the mysteries of God we know has been uh revealed but it's and it's a it's an individual thing this morning and God deals with us as individuals it it's the it don't matter you your grandparents your your parents as an individuals these young people they have to be clear they have to be clear on their understanding of the word for themselves be because if they're not there they can be persuaded they could be they could be influenced by the outside world they could be influenced by by by home statuses and things of that nature you you got to have an individual stand if nobody going I'm going is that right because God is dealing with us as individual as individuals our understanding has got to be individual understanding and and you may not you may not be able to uh Express to other people what you believe but you you got to be anchored somewhere you got somewhere you got to drive a stake somewhere you you got to say like the disciples they couldn't fully grasp um uh all of the things that that Jesus was doing in his preaching they couldn't explain it they couldn't grasp it except you eat of My Flesh and drink of my blood they could not explain it they never did explain it it it took a a prophet to come on the scene to explain it right Paul but they couldn't explain it and and see because they were redeemable they they were able to you know uh uh uh stand flat footed with Jesus where we where are we going seeing you alone have the words of eternal life where where am I going my my world's turned upside down but where am I going all right right I'm I'm not sure about who I am as a person especially when you're young but you know there that's cuz see in our early in our early days that there's something about it that uh I couldn't comprehend I didn't understand right as it related to the message I couldn't put things together at that time all right and and I thought I thought that I I I could you know run away and I went up to Virginia and everything and and my world got turned upside down even more and I had to come back that was one of the happiest moments in my life you know finding my way back you know at that time I was still at brother Wesco and uh you know I I I left but I took the word with me I had a I had a suitcase with every book I owned I still prayed I still studied but but you know I knew deep down inside you know I still had that link with you know brother Char and brother you know especially at that time brother Jack because you know we were bll and buddies neither one of us was married at the time or anything and uh uh we would constantly you know stay in touch and and you know it it was it was because you know that I was predestinate even though I didn't understand I knew it was something about the message that it was real because of my personal experience but but one one thing exper experience alone won't do it right you cuz see I've watched people have experiences yeah Jor wine experience not taken away from the experience crying on the Altar and and and all of that and we used to do that kind of stuff in the meetings cry on each other right brother Troy we used toot on each other and crying but we didn't have no knowledge right we didn't have no understanding and I still to this day I I always remember being in a meeting with brother Coleman and he making a statement from the message and from the scripture that you're going to understand it and that was the thing that I helped on to you know trying to search for for for understanding right I'm just kind of building I'm starting to feel my way now right uh uh just trying to trying to understand I remember working with sister burs back in the day and and you know we we all had been around for a few years them a little bit longer than me and I still always remember her asking me a question about some of the doctrine and I could just only I could only go on what I've been hearing but it wasn't something that that translated it wasn't something that Dr St from here into here and was quickened right so I was like Christ and she looked at me like yeah I understand that part but you know that's been said and and it took time you know for God to get me in the right place because amen I was a redeemable right I'm I'm going make a hard statement and and people don't like you know they think well you know the marage do you know gu you guys are arrogant and all that's not the case it has nothing to do with being arrogant it has everything to do amen with our understanding of the word and realizing you know just like just like um Noah or Moses right um he realize after his experience and his Revelation that was given to him at the burning bush that that you know what his place was his position and his purpose is that right and see you know we we went on for some time but we we it just those things diff didn't you know and even a lot of things that uh sitting under my second Pastor I still didn't grasp right it it's a lot of things that I didn't grasp until I had to start pastoring and then that puts you under a whole another level of pressure to make sure that that the thing that you're ministering is clear to you first that that that you haven't understanding of these things first right before you can present these people and then the pressure realizing that you know what I'm going be held accountable see and these are the things that that I hear when when I'm listening to a tape or something you you you follow the the the passion and the Heart of the Prophet when when he's bringing something you know when he was bringing the seals and all the church ages you could hear in his heart realizing there's a lot of pressure that goes along with with what I'm doing so I I got to make sure that I'm clear as possible that it's real to me right right and trusting God to express it in a way that that the people can grasp it right you know we got a younger generation um that's coming up and one day you know these young guys going to be the deacons of the church you know they're going to be the Ministers of the church and so we're under the pressure right to make sure that what we're what we're preaching is the gospel that that we're pre reaching seed right we we don't want to cut the seed seed open and splice it and inject something because you know it'll produce it'll produce a bigger better it'll produce a a a a nice church right look just look around us right amen you can high breed is what we talking about see you could the prophet preached hybrd religion and he he preached on hybrid corn and all of these different things he preached on you know uh uh the Citrus life and and how you can take because it's Citrus a orange tree and splice and it'll you you go out there and it's got It's got tangelo it's got you know uh grapefruits and different things and you it's like this is crazy no it's it's living it's it's it's living of a citrus life but it's bearing fruit of his kind right amen amen and see this is the thing that you know people don't understand when when they when they hear you preach and things of that nature with with what we see around us they're living off of a a life but bearing another kind of fruit I'm feeling like preaching now see amen everybody's got got a title and a name and everybody say that they're Christians and things of that nature right but uh unfortunately everybody's not redeemable see uh and and we came up in a day where where you know you could buy soda and the bottle was the bottle was redeemable you could take it back and get your money back but but here's the thing every bottle wasn't redeemable see like like today like today it's it's it's still maybe not in the United States but in some countries you'll see in fine printing on the bottle redeemable see even even in after the contents of the bottle has been empti the bottle oh y'all ought to come on talk to me y'all ought to wake up now this morning I know it's a little chilly outside but it shouldn't be chilly in here right it it says redeemable so so you know um be because folks are saying that they're Christian now we G we gonna tie this back to scripture right amen see everything that we're preaching and everything that the prophet preached he was able to bring it out of scripture he could he could see in between the lines whereas people could see something on the surface right what what what belonged to him was in between the lines and see that's been the problem of people from his ministry and on down where people people people you know struggle to grasp the knowledge of what's amen been been presented to us that was in between the lines right that that only you know the wife is privy to yes sir come on church cuz he said he write his you know he'll write a letter and things of that nature and he get to somebody and and and you know uh he said where you wife said this and your wife said that and he read the letter say oh it's a lot deeper than that right it's a lot deeper it's like uh uh Joseph is cutting up and and Sarah and and I miss you and I need you to come home and chastise these children because y'all know what I'm talking about children respond different to the father right amen the children they they'll respond whole lot different to the father than they do to Mama they'll back talk to Mama a little bit especially them boys when they start getting a little age and start smelling themselves right right now today my Justin will be 30 I think this year and Justin they they don't that ain't F to argue with me right and they grown adults he got children they got jobs they own money they own cars and everything else and and they might try to attempt sometime but then I be like I Chang my whole expression so like what and everything changed you know they write me little textes a little text right uh little while back a few weeks ago my son that liveed with me you know I was telling him that you know cuz I grew up in the age where you had to pay rent when you got a certain age and and and and I told him I told him I said well you know you got to pay a $50 more you know he was paying me $150 but I was just being light on him so I told him well you got to give me $200 and he wrote me what about 150 them 150 days over with you know you you've grown a couple of years you know and and I'm allowing you to do certain things that I said I wouldn't do when y'all was young I'm letting you skate I'm trying to work with you and everything and and you know if I got to spend all my money you got to spend a little bit of yours and and I'm trying to and I'm trying to I'm trying to I'm trying to stack my paper I get that I get that but you want to Stack your paper and me to have no paper and and then and then I said boy there's no place you can live for $200 you can't you used to could stay in a hotel you can't stay in a hotel for $200 a month you can't St $200 a week no more and that's a dump glory to God you know and then he wrote me some other stuff and and I don't know why they think I'm slow it's like bro my brain I I have to tell them this stuff on the job it's like you know I might be a Christian and a and the servant and I I ain't slow I don't operate that slow you know uh not my mind my body sometimes does but not my brain you can't just say anything and think I don't catch it I might I might not say anything about it but it don't mean that I didn't catch it but because they my children it's like okay I got to nip this in the butt real quick listen do not write me this kind of stuff cuz you don't want to be like Fred Flintstone with your little bowl outside or your bag of clothes see cuz I done paid for them they they you know y'all don't I'm a I'm I'm a real I'm I'm I'm real easy going but just don't push me just don't put just don't push me I I can be nice but but I don't like to be pushed on too much I'll fight a bully yeah because of the principle because because because you feel like amen you're something that you really not you just got some issues and everybody ain't scared of you let me keep going on I ain't going to never get to my thought but but you know I'm I'm still working y'all we we got time I still got a little time um and and and you know and thinking about this I'm I'm always thinking about the Young Generation and want to make sure that there're stable good people good hearts and things of that nature uh uh but but you you want for their experience to be personal that's right be personal right where where they know that you know what I'm standing on this for me see I'm doing this for me see if my parents turn back that ain't got nothing to do with me they got to work out their own soul salvation with fear and trembling right if my sister go back that ain't got nothing to do with me right if none of my siblings and none of my this and Co that that what does that have to only thing that I can do is pray for them but in in my my understanding it it's got to be person that's right right it it cuz see the the Bible is a prophetic book it's a mysterious book and everybody ain't going to get it right let's let's let's go somewhere and and that's the truth Church whether people want to hear that or not or they want to feel like you know you guys are in the message y'all are arrogant and y'all think y'all the only ones and uh uh that that's not that's not really it right it's not that we feel like we but we We've Come to an understanding and and we know in this computer is done went to acting up on me y'all bear with me I'mma take my time I ain't going nowhere I got to make sure I got some internet I wish I can go back to my old way see paper I'm trying to be like brother Jack now but they they smart at this stuff and I I'm still learning and and and see this computer don't move without some internet so uh y'all bear with me the devil is a liar I I done got this this far this morning and uh I make it this the rest of the way by his grace his grace his grace is Grace to serve a la yes yes I'm still loing Lo in I was telling now I could just preach cuz n but but but I I want to I want to try to I want to try to uh I want to try to read some quotes because I think it just the statements will be we be beneficial is to us and Lord have mercy oh Lord y'all help y'all pray with me pray for me I done just the whole thing done disappeared I can't okay I I I can but I don't want to do it that way this morning I want to take my time okay there we go now watch this in in the message of uh the Mighty God unveil before us 1964 uh trying to give us a paragraph here I ain't got it but it says it starts out God in the beginning was life he said and the Eternal one in him and and see we we gotta begin to um uh just just follow uh the the thoughts of the word right amen that that's that's always been for me something behind the statements that the prophet of God makes right and he always would take us back to before Genesis 1 and one right glory to God and and for the Young Generation for all of us we we got to be able to go all the way back before let there be back to to the thoughts that was in his mind right he says in him was attributes and those attributes became words and and the word became flesh he says Jesus was the Redeemer and the redeem means to bring back he says if he has to bring it back it had to be somewhere to be brought back to right amen now we ain't necessarily trying to go back to to his mind but in his mind his stinking brought everything to the Earth right right amen he says if he has to bring it back it it had to be somewhere to be brought back to he say so you see all people will never be able to see it we still working that's hard all people will not be able to see it right because all people wasn't in the beginning in his in God's thoughts see that's a that's a powerful statement amen right amen not eternally now now yeah God God saw right he knew who would be here and and everything that would be done but we're talking about what's what's Eternal right and see if you wasn't eternally in the thoughts of God you wouldn't be here this morning come on and see that's that's why I I'm I'm make statements see you know from these statements you you got to know your surroundings you you got to know what you a part of this we're not playing games this this is the time where you you you got to know and and and it's not my job to tell you what to do and the choices to make but it is my job to give you the the right information so that you could make an in informed decision not a decision based upon feelings and flesh and things of that nature but you make a decision you make your choices based upon the knowledge and understanding your Association where you go to church right amen it matters it means something glory to God well I'm over here and this and that and the other and I'm not telling people what to do and where to go not my job my job is to know why I'm here amen amen right cuz cuz you can't make anybody do anything you know uh you you you can only pray and things of that nature and and just thank God right that that you were in his thoughts in the beginning and if they were in his thoughts in the beginning there'll be where he has ordained for them to be in that season right glory to God well they over here and they doing this and it's so it ain't okay but it's okay you got to you know when you when you start dealing with adults you got to let them make adult choices and decisions you can't spend all your energy fighting with them you just got to you then here's where your understanding has has got to be uh quickened to you a promise brother ja and I been preaching on this for a while and Acts chapter 2 right you got a promise and things of that nature right unfortunately and and we we may not like to hear this but I'm going say it anyway it might be people that that ain't ordained to be a part of the bride's body come on Church come on church this deep preaching now right cuz the B the Bible say the rest of the Dead live not again for a thousand years and then they has to come up to the judgment and things of that nature right so so there may be people right family members friends alike people that go to church you know that that will get eternal life but they may not never be in the city come on church we preaching the city Folk huh right I I'm preaching to people that we trust that that'll find their place positionally right in the pyramid we're we're not down here we're in the head right I never forget that time I don't know if Sister Brown and and and sister burs and all of them remember that time we went we first went to South Carolina and we went to um brother Gibbs and we had some meetings but I think I preached the service maybe no I wasn't preaching then I can't remember but I know brother James did but I remember brother Gibbs and boy brother Gibbs shook the house down I heard brother tro mention brother Gibbs the other night and uh man let me tell you something brother GB said you want to go in the head now y'all know he was real theatrical you want to go in the head and it was like a bomb dropped because that was the first time I think we we really grasp our position maybe not up here so much but in here it was something about that statement it shook the building this back when the floors was wooden y'all ought to talk to me oh W Church wooden flows we stomp that building down we let me let me tell you something y'all see we we be playing sometime let me tell you something back in them days we used to shout it out we used to get it in SC I'm talking about folk like sister B Sister Brown the cap we used to shout it down we shouted that place down why because he asks us a question that our heart our heart amen Iden ified with see if he would have said y'all want to go in De feat no no that was Paul's age that was Paul's dispensation and on up and on up even to the the Pentecostal day right amen no that's not where I want to be right right amen not in a in a uh denomination Pentecostal Revival no amen I I want to be identified with a head Revival a seven Thunder Revival come on church amen glory which takes place in the head we we've been elevated the the message amen has elevated us and and you know what I I ran across a quote there was a time where brother brandham said you know uh up under the early part of his Min he said the bride wasn't even woke and then when I was studying I ran across the another quote where he said she's woke right she's in Revival are you in Revival this morning are you in a seven Thunder Revival this morning see one thing about the one thing about the the the welchman he wasn't trembling he wasn't trying to figure it out well no right his Revival was so real that he was willing to identify a cop on the corner you looking at it see amen I'm the Revival you're the Revival right amen amen but you're not at defeat you're not identified at defeat right at the start amen of the building of a bride it started at defeat at emphasis but it has moved itself up come on yes woooo but TR start to feel good right amen see we're not down there we're we're up here see and and and uh I Sing Because I'm happy I sing because I'm free see why because of my own personal knowledge I amen y'all amen because of what's revealed to you what strikes you and I amen what strikes me glory to God glory to God let's let's keep moving let's keep moving we got time we got time man I'mma take my time today uh we we were look we we read a scripture we read a scripture this morning in St John chapter 4 right and you know it it deals with it deals with you know a woman that to the outside work now now this is important right she wasn't prominent right she you know I don't know how much education she had I you know I didn't we do know she couldn't come out and get water with the so-called good women right huh she couldn't why cuz her her testimony tell testimony was trash right you know probably even some of the men who slept would have probably looked at her like she was trash but if she was much trash you know you you see how people think sometimes Righttime it's like our mentality you know uh they didn't want to be identified and because I guess the laws and things you know she had to come out uh uh at a certain time and here here's the thing she might have didn't mean a whole lot to a mama yeah she might have didn't mean a whole cuz y y'all don't talk to me now to a daddy to people in the family see might have didn't mean a whole lot to the community you know brother R he talks about that at a time where you know his testimony was bad cuz of his daddy they was drunks they they were Fighters they were Shooters and but they had a bad reputation and folks would see him amen and walk cross the street yes they didn't want to be identified with a kid who had no nothing to do with his his his pedigree his he had nothing to do with his daddy Dr drinking his Granddaddy and them drinking his uncle what they were he had nothing to do with that especially as a kid right amen and and and what's sad folk come up and and then we'll point we'll Point our kids and say negative thing oh you going to be really why why would you put that on me if that wasn't good for him why would you put that on me don't be just like your daddy well my daddy be be on the corner somewhere with bugs flying around his lips cuz he done fell out on the corner somewhere drop and so you up set really with him and because I might look like him or be named after him right come on church and then and then you know for for this this young lady you know her testimony was was bad and and you know Jesus being smart I'm glad you know what I'm glad God is smart right I'm glad GL God see in things and in people what people don't see in people right glory to God glory to God it it's like it's like Jesus say you know what uh man y'all go to town to get some viddles right cuz Jesus was smart Jesus knew they ain't going to be able to handle me talking to her cuz she got a bad name she got a bad testimony what you know I'm going say this cuz it feel good see back back back in them days you know what there was a representation that those folks had even when I was coming up right prostitutes had a representation in the way that they looked y'all ought to talk to me somebody in the in the in you know the way you know might be old feathery something and you know they they had an identity they had an identity when I was coming the street Walkers walking up Broadway they had a look they had a dress Cod and right hallelujah hallelujah they had a standard and and and all of the pass and all of the guys they they knew riding down the street am man who was who now you can't hardly tell well praise the Lord I'm going be finished after a while whenever after a while come I'm going be done right it's the truth be because you you you can see now more than in the 60s in the 70s cuz I I'll be honest with you in the 70s in the 60s folk dressed up huh white folk 50s 40s go back and look at them pictures folk put on suits men wore suits right glory to God men dressed up to go to the bar I still remember my uncle them walking down with they little swaggle with they hat tilted to the side they go to the bar to get drunk yeah but they had Integrity somebody know what I'm talking about when even when we went to school you know um especially when I was up north man people went to school dressed up with gators gators and and ostriches and all of that y'all don't talk to me man I had guys and we was a little bit poor cuz my dad drunk you know he drunk up all the money so I couldn't dress but I used to admire them guys be like God D what up boy boy got Gators on even if they had to borrow sometime for the big brother have one of my friends named darl Washington he about the size of his older brother so he throwing his brother's clothes but but that was the error but but you you look at you just look at the spirit and and we couldn't grasp things back then that we we we see now where the prophets talked about you could prove that you've never committed adultery but the spirit on you based upon the way that you dress is a prostitute spirit yes amen right it's it's the spirit that's on you you know you see the things provocative and all of this stuff that the folk come out with they never would have wore that stuff in the 70s it's the truth everybody was trying to everybody was trying to look look good put your finest on Sunday go to meetings uh close on huh now we want to see how sexy right right bosoms out back out everything out nothing to the imagination right now he just you know let me leave that alone Lord have mercy see that's one of the spirits that's been prophetic for the age if I get to it uh uh uh Revelation chapter 3 where it talks about uh uh um people being blind wretched and naked and and not really even you know they not even knowing it yeah listen there's there's been such you know thank God there's been a holy Veil placed upon our eyes right but there's a Unholy where they don't people don't recognize the spirit that's on them come on church and to me it this has always been crazy if some if if a young man come into your room while you trying to get dressed and you're in your underclothes right you'll cover up and scre go go right then go right to the beach what sense does that make you will go right right to the beach in a two-piece and you just screamed his head off what's the difference in the attire nothing really nothing well let me preach let me but but okay getting back on on on this woman at the wellb when when you look at her you wouldn't think that looking at her and and all of her flaws and her failures and what she's gone through and The Whispers And and everything to think that the son of man would come to her yes right would come to her not just come to her but she she would have something in her that was redeemable yes right that they did not have so so sometime we look at but they say they listen let me tell you something let me let me tell you something you know who missed Christ the religious people church folk church folk people that was going to church and so-called looking for amen the first coming they were the ones who totally totally missed it right but it it was it was these people people fishermen and people that you wouldn't think that would grasp it that wouldn't understand understood when he makes simple statements that they grasped and held on to right but then the prophet he makes a statement in the Mighty God unveil uh I think it's is it might be uh verse 72 he says but look at the priests right the priests they were the religious men they were the the the men that were supposed to be guiding the people reading the Scrolls to the people that was that was studied that were learned men right they didn't get it they didn't get it he says but when they see him expressing him ex exactly with the word right that's key that's key I'm going tell you some church now this this Beyond just being excited right see because if you miss the word you miss Christ amen if you're if you're missing the prophetic word being Vindicated you just got religion you may get eternal life at the white throne judgment but that we ain't preaching a white Throne judgment message I'm not preaching a tribulation message to y'all we we're preaching we're preaching an a an exodus right amen I got something I wrote down but I'm me stay with this for a second this for Exodus people this for people that that got amen the token appli amen that's ready to go that can see the flashing red light signs of his coming amen this is for a redeemable people Oh Glory okay so he says um now look at the priest when when they see him expressing himself exactly with the word and what he was they said it's Bey b see you got to follow the spirit and make sure you're not under that same Spirit come on church because the spirit on those that were not redeemable say but he's beyb and for for the people who can't follow the word right so so with these statements they anchor us because we we can see no I don't want to be under that Spirit see I want to be under the spirit of knowing because there's a spirit of not knowing right come on he says they showed where their nature was it was it was in the modern thought of the day but church it's powerful see why I didn't want to I ain't want to pass over this what's your thoughts is it in the modern thoughts of the day come on but okay if it is look at the Modern thoughts of the right look look at how they're being inspired look at like like I I heard brother Jack the other day he made reference to uh Kurt Franklin the stuff you see him doing he never would have did that back in when I was coming up man them Pentecostal mothers and them deacons would have sat bro you got a demon on you here's the altar you get down there and you do not move all that gting and and and and you know James Brown Michael Jackson and Prince and you know and and y'all know I'm all for looking good and dressing and all that some of that stuff is like bro you can't wear you you just you just can't wear glory to God he coming out man it's like he's making a mockery and see because we all say we Christians they want to they want to pack us up in all in the same box we ain't in this I'm not in the box with that man and and realistically he's gifted I'm not even saying that but gifts and callings without repentance but watch watch the the spirit he like the spirit of the pie Piper that's it y'all how to talk to me church I do still know some kids stories just woo and everybody and and and everybody and everybody just following him [Applause] he y'all think I can't move don't y'all I just cut it short cuz I don't want to be under his Spirit right and and and see it it's a lot of things that we brought into church that you know ain't a part of church you cuz you look you go back to David when he danced before the Lord right it wasn't all of this cute you know we we done brought so much stuff in that that kind of borderline and something a lot of it ain't even scriptural that you could tie back to this man was just it was no form no fashion to David right with that kind of excitement I ain't going to try to do that I don't feel like the bones feel that but I can just feel like him just just going wow nothing put on it was it was inspired from the heart it was a worship from the heart that's why when his wife told her boy I tell you what boy you was looking crazy L have mercy a king oh you ain't seen not yet but not in the way that KK Franken say You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet the inspiration of that coming from the pit of Hell see David knew that once he get inspired right Bo I'm going dance before the Lord the word watching watching the word come back yes un listen Church we're excited for the word the Vindication of the word that has come in our midst yes right and it don't it don't make us braggadocious or Pious or anything it it it just makes us blessed you know the the prophet makes a statement here and I I wrote this down because I ain't no uh if I will get to it but in recognizing your Dan in this message he says I feel that we're not grateful enough for the things that God is making known to us right we we're not grateful enough for the things right like that song say grateful great we ought to be so de grateful huh for the for the things and the understanding of the things that's not surface right glory to God Amen he says he said that's show where their nature was it was in the modern thought of the day but when this little prostitute that he met at the gate and told her Express his Messiah sign and the Messiah sign was discernment when he told us oh go get your husband she say boy I ain't got none I well well you told the truth see that was a messiah sign he could discern he said yeah the one you we ain't yours you didn't had a few of them before him that did something for her right because she realized somewhere maybe in her uh Sunday school class right aren't youall glad for Sunday school class somewhere in the Sunday school class you know or her upbringing before her fall she knew that Messiah was coming right right right and here's something that's deep even though her life was a wreck turned upside down something deep in her right that was redeemable was predestinated had representation said you know what Messiah coming she messing up but Messiah coming right right man after man but they said Messiah coming right that's powerful church that that in her shape she could recognize that right when when people that you know want to be identified with her amen uh uh here come a man that was willing to be identified with her to to sit to sit and have conversation right glory to God that you know Jesus know the these guys here they not going to be able to handle this I'm going send them off for a minute I I don't want them to mess up the atmosphere amen right I want to be in the right channel I don't want no unbelief right I think brother Mark was saying you know Jesus couldn't do great Miracles where there was unbelief Jesus knew them guys right cuz before they went Amen to the upper room they they just had all kind of spirits on them they was wanting to call just one man was doing man call let's what you want us to do with this guy Jesus said if he ain't if he ain't uh against us any for don't bother with him leave him alone leave sometime y'all need to just leave stuff alone leave people alone glory to God we we can't hardly get our own selves and our own Christian lives together and our own lives and our own thoughts and we busy about and medling sometime folk just need to mind their business and I ain't talking to no Sinners I'm talking to people that go to church be busy by this well praise the Lord see she saw the express Messiah sign by telling her what she had done right and see this the thing in the 60s when when we had uh brother brandom on the scene uh uh with the Messiah sign because a part of his ministry was to reveal the son of man to make him known right glory to God that was a his ministry to declare he is here come on church that's a quote huh he was making Christ known he wasn't just a man trying to build a a dynasty that's what they doing today he wasn't doing that he was declaring Christ Christ is here greater than Solomon is here now somebody that's greater than a man is here but see the the smart the priest the people that should have known didn't know glory to God glory to God God Amen he says um she said sir watch this I perceive you're a prophet a prostitute could perceive that and people can't today we know that the Messiah when he comes he will tell us all these things she was recognizing him as the Messiah what in her her condition right in her condition when everybody was walking away when people wouldn't come out but people of her kind look what she was saying and versus what they were saying they were saying be elub she was saying man bro I know that you you got to be a prophet right say you we know the Messiah when he comes he will tell us all these things she was recognizing him as the Messiah the anointed one because he met this he met the scriptural qualifications don't you see amen the two pieces of paper we're coming together she we know that when the Messiah cometh right amen she saw his scriptural qualifications J listen we we got to go back and you know and I believe we understand this but for those who don't you know I'm just make like nobody don't know nothing this for this morning service you got to go back to what he was preaching identification and and recognizing your day in this message a mighty God unveil right all of these things he was trying to point us to Christ he was trying to point us to to to scripture Jesus came according to scripture he came as a virgin he came to set the captives free I mean all the things that he done was scriptural but the priests and the scholars and the great men that should have saw that reading the Scrolls but yet seeing the Vindication of it they was like Bey bu why because he didn't come according to their way of thinking a lot of times our thinking is trash right you don't even know how to think till you get converted come on church amen you you don't even know how to think right till you get converted and and and then it take years upon years here little there little to to help you to think right come on church amen to help you to think right cuz you don't know cuz we rubbing elbows and and we we got so much information and so much I'm talking about me too you it's it's a it's a it's a constant growth and maturity a constant unveiling y'all think cuz y'all been to church these few well I've been to church 30 years 40 years in this message and you still still got to grow cuz people people still prejudice come on culturally and in every other way there's biases right come on Church woo right it it it's and and we we got to grow out of that I heard a young man say uh somebody posted this it was a young man he was he was reverting back to his script scripture talking about we we're known by our character right and when when we put our character and we base our thinking and all of that on the word you be like woo Jesus I got to grow some more come on church I ain't trying to hurt your feelings or nothing like that y'all ain't alone I'm talking about me too right you you start you start realizing after all of these years is you know I'm still not where I supposed to be but but I'm not standing still neither and and then and then I appreciate right I'm come back to this quote see I feel that we're not grateful enough for the things that God is making known to us now okay how do we feel about that statement that I just made brother Smile In the Flesh no I'm not in no flesh I am in the skin but not like you think right glory to God because this goes along with it this this goes this this individualized it causes us to check ourselves to look at ourselves not to think more highly well some of y'all got degrees I don't but but you ain't going in but cuz you got a degree and I don't I'm going somewhere let me see if I can how much time I got oh love a little time gone preach brother all right blame it on him he told me to go ahead praise the Lord I'm glad you sitting on the front row he says uh and the Mighty God unveil before us he said not what did this he said putting the old scriptures with the experience that Jesus was giving to her what did it do it made the Messiah he said and did you notice quickly her sins were forgiven because watch this because at the beginning she was redeemable right what her sometimes you see people cleaned up and you can't hardly believe it boy not you yeah see Jesus Jesus can do great things right but see because he was redeemable I'm afraid to think about where I would be today if I wasn't redeemable 1988 you know you know um we had a lot of years with brother Westco and uh a lot has happened there a lot of a lot of things happened over the years but you know I always look back and I'm always grateful that he was there in his position with with the kind of faith that I needed I don't know what y'all needed but he was there he might not have had the Revelation that I got this morning but that that wasn't what I needed at that time what I needed at that time was a man who understood his position who was positionally place in the world to be in in at that point at that time at That season when when I needed it see amen I was the I was kind of like the woman at the well I was jacked up huh glory to God but but you know a few minutes you know and it was so simple but so profound yes right yall know brother W's go back in the day where I used to talk fast ass move fast brother West CO walk you to man come on them long legs and brother brother W say young man you all right come the office come office y know back there what you talk real fast and everything office huh what you want young man what you want I was like I'm about te and all that and um just saying you know I need see I get te now he said get out on your knees got out on my knee cuz I I went to the Pentecostal church and they had me Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus and I get got right back up they didn't have enough Faith they didn't have what I what I needed right I need somebody with a headship message glory to God and I got down on my knees and and he just said repeat after me I don't know what the prayer was but it was something real simple and I'm standing on my knees and and I'm still I'm waiting on them Jesus to come again Jesus Jes Jesus Jesus what what you doing young man young man what you doing oh don't no I'm trying to find get out of that it's over I didn't I didn't I didn't spiritually understand it was over but my heart said it was over let me tell you something I'm grateful for 30 almost 37 years of being drug free I lost I lost the desire I let me tell you something I lost a desire for that you know even you know I got friends that's you know churchgoing guys and this and that when they look at me they be like astounded and some of the things that they tell me and I and I can't explain to them my position and where I am right now right with with with the things that I'm going through in my life and all that it's you can't explain those things to people you you just can't am amen you you some of the thing you can't explain that to a man amen because you know as two men we'll talk as men and they'll give me a manly perspective but I I'll be looking at that be like but you don't even understand where I am see I understand where you at and and what you how you're trying to you know inform me but I'm levels above that in in the way in the way that I'm processing things right because because and and and this will be good for everybody right this this would be good the for the married this would be good for the ones who going to get married uh and and and and this for the ones who got children and and this good for the sisters and listen it's it's just not about you right especially you get married and no matter what happens and you got children it's still no longer just about you you too right right you you got to think about the moves that you make and the things that you do and the statements that you make right it it's it's about them it's about your grandchildren it it's so much it's so much involved right it's it's so much involved you know can I say this and not seem arrogant especially today that's an easy thing to do for a man you know to just go get somebody but sometime it's like what are you getting Bo she bad she bad she is she bad not the way you think she might got bbl's and push-ups and this and that I ain't I ain't on no I ain't in no box I be around I got children huh glory to God wash your face take all them lashes off take all that stuff out what's a conversation come on what's a what's a thought processing I I declare take my glasses off of this one I'm F to go I ain't get to where I wanted to I I I I need two hours to preach what I really wanted to pre uh uh uh the thought process of this generation I'm I folk crazy it's the truth folk crazy it's like where do we get this stuff from and I'm not just talking about uneducated them too but the the the thought process of educated people therapists well I'm going to a psych I'm going to a therapist you better be careful I'm telling you because their thought processes are carnal they're not spiritual they're not they're not going to line you up with Biblical principles I'm not saying if you need a therapist by all means go but but I I will say this if if you need help God gave you a pastor right I I would I would I would say for my for for me go talk to brother Jack and sister Erica yes right be before before you you go to these folks out here I mean like I say I I'm not here to tell people what to do if if you feel that's what you need you know you go you do that but then you know one thing I understand about Ministry God gives Ministry something that the the the psychologist and psychiatrists don't have see even even brother brandom he talks about the this another message but but y'all don't know the struggle that I had when trying to find the mind of God but I got some things that I wanted to preach but listen to this you you when this young girl when this young girl you know uh she she kind of went off a little bit because of a boy because of a relationship you you needed an anointed gift to pick all of these things up with the woman that committed uh an adultery on a husband when he was in the service right and she thought she was losing her mind right the PES couldn't pick that up she was hiding that she was hiding that but the gift picked it up oh see she could have gone to all the doctors she wanted took all the medicine she wanted they never would have got it right God gave it to amen a gift in his place see there's things that brother Jack might not know but sitting there talking to you God is real God can Elevate him say you know what speak right to him in his heart she did this she did that she was over here this boom something break show him the guy show him where he was show him the whole account right glory to God when brother B made a statement to that lady she said ah don't scream now you wasn't screaming then huh don't tell him that well if I if you don't get this right that demon got a right to stay there huh he has a right to stay there as long as that's unconfessed sin glory to God I'm hiding hide on when them demons fin finish whooping you goingon to be glad to tell it brother BR brother B he he say oh okay wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute is your husband a such and such man yeah he got a secretary look like this that go get him and tell him to come here okay cuz he done done with you not my husband flesh is the flesh brother Maurice used to say the flesh is a mess that's the truth husband and he came back he they came together and and she got some Deliverance because of that right but those things had to be exposed amen am right amen glory to God and that brought that brought that brought the results let me tell boy I tell you I got to go let the music come boy but I feel like preaching now cuz I tapped into something that that I was trying to run from for from from this service y'all make me nervous sometime where I don't know really what what to preach because I don't know if y'all can handle it it's it's the truth let the musicians come because because I got I got some things you know and and I I don't be trying to be bigger and better or nothing like that but God got a fivefold ministry right God got a fivefold Ministry for the Perfection of the church and and you know sometimes with experience and just sitting in a chair I get inspired and I probably get inspired unlike you know right now some of the younger guys coming up CU I got let's be realistic man I I'm older than them and I got more years behind this desk than they do some of them got what two three years behind the desk right how many years you've been preaching brother Mark BR qu five put them all three put them all together they still don't don't have 30 some years but I'm not saying that you know but you know you can't y'all can't expect me to be them y'all can't expect me to approach things the way that they approach things did they right glory to God but I hope you know next year you know y you know we we're understanding I I didn't tap really into that the way that I wanted to but but we we're we're under we're understanding we we we're we're Desiring more we're Greatful for for this year of services I don't know about y'all but I'm grateful for that I'm grateful for this year's services and what what God but that ain't all there are times where I feel like man I'm still on the surface right because this is this is a inexhaustible Fountain you can't exhaust this where I preach this so what go back to it again and God will show you one point different and and expand it the prophet makes a statement he said man if if if I could preach to y'all what's given to me in the back room he said boy it'll be marvelous but when you get here you pressed and nervous and all of that you you just kind of Hit the highlights of stuff and sometimes even with brother Brandon God gives him stuff that's so so deep so so intense that he like boy they'll pass out if I preach this up in here marriage and divorce he said I had to take out things that I wanted to say because I didn't want to hurt the people and and you know he preached a little bit and have to you know almost apologize and and and this ain't for y'all Christian sisters right so that they don't get offended right cuz the statements are so profound but it's like I'm not really trying to hurt you but I'm trying to illuminate right help you to be able to walk and especially in this Society right man it's it's going to be in the minority right this why we got to pray for this Young Generation cuz it's going to be in the minori it's a lot of people going on church and all of that but that ain't what we talking about what we talking about is so much more deep than just going to a building and shouting and all of that y'all give me some music I don't knowes let me let me try something pass me not oh to [Music] say let stand he my am B cry was brother Troy why [Music] that oh to pass me by I'm crying say oh [Music] say here my hble cry while on Earth Thou Are [Music] calling do not pass me oh let me at thy Throne of Mer Mercy find the sweet [Music] really kneeling there in the [Music] country oh H my unb [Music] I'm crying say oh saor here my humble [Music] cry w on others Thou Art ho do not me amen glory to God Amen we appreciate brother Smiley amen for getting himself out of the way man I know when you I kind of panicked last night couldn't find my tablet oh lord I can't do so I got I need this just that luckily I found it all wife said you need to get more organized I said Yes [Music] dear amen but we appreciate the word on this morning amen was a lot a lot said there amen it just like you know one of the things that stand out to me is just the processing the processing of how see once you've been exposed to something you can't be unexposed to it that that go both ways so that's why you know with the younger ones and even the old ones be careful what you expose yourself to because you can't never be unexposed and now you got to carry that yes you done you done release something Pandora's box but on the other side when you when when you set up under listen now a prophet's message and and and You Begin that that that you begin to your eyes begin to open and you see the day that we're living in yes you see the the the the the the impact of what you're really that the gospel is still moving amen and understand uh how we got here see then you then you're you're going into the head now that's what he was getting that when brother giz I was there when he's made that statement it it was like a bomb went off in the place because it was like I read one where Revelation comes down if you could just see it at the come down and set upon you a re Revelation and when you get it you get it you your whole world changed because your eyes are now open and you just you can't you can't go back you can't you you you can't just you can't just be religious anymore you can't just and and then you got to walk that line you got to walk that line of how not to be arrogant you struggle with not being being arrogant but it's because of what God has done because of the Revelation that you have you you you you you you got to God bless you and this that you treat everybody right and and and you try but you want them to see it but you can't you can't shove it down their throat and we'll stand up here behind the behind the pull pit and we trying to preach this Revelation to you try to preach this Revelation to you and sometime it seem like some people still not getting it but let me say this and I ain't going to do what I I ain't going to do it I'm I'mma BR it un preached already don't set up under this message and sit there and don't get it don't don't come see I'm you know sometime I'm I really pray for people who who come they visit and they and they come this this ain't no ordinary church this this is this ain't this this is this is God's church amen this is a special Church why because we re receive a prophet now I'm not talking that many people out there claiming themselves to be a prophet with no Vindication whatsoever ain't been Vindicated on nothing but we are confident that we've heard the word of God through a prophet's lips that has shown us who we are what time it is yes and our eyes have been open that's why it may seem a little strange man they do things a little bit different yeah we know we know we know we do things just a little bit different and and you know what and even in that there's struggles and we're still in flesh and we still got to contend with flesh we still going to battle flesh until we get out of here but don't sit here don't sit here under this now that sound arrogant don't sit here under this and halfhazard that's why we say the song please do not pass me by While others may be called and do not pass me by reveal to me the secrets of your [Music] heart I'm here crying savior do not pass me by cuz it ain't nothing to play with now everybody going to have to stand in and make an account of of what you heard some that have never heard from may may have a easier time if they ain't never heard it but you sat here up under the gospel the true gospel will be held accountable for it you heard this you heard it and you reject see the word is Christ and you ain't rejecting me you ain't rejecting brother smiling you ain't rejecting CH you rejecting him amen praise the Lord praise the Lord I'm crying savior oh sa oh here my [Music] home cist oh why long thou AR cold only do not P be oh [Music] say oh sa oh yeah oh
