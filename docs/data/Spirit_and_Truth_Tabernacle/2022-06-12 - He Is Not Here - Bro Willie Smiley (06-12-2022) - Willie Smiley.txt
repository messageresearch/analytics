overtime blame brother troy ford hey man i'm gonna try to i'm gonna try to be quick this morning but uh let's remember brother jack matthew 28 brother jack in prayer this morning and um brother solomon in the family and the ones that's not here this morning appreciate the lord it's good to be back home we shot up the south carolina uh last week we left about four o'clock in the morning saturday and preached that night and sunday morning and jumped back in the car after eating soul food and drove home boys hey that's one reason why i love going to south carolina folk get tired of south carolina i'll never get tired of going to south carolina the folk the only place we ain't got no soul food out here we got jamaican food that ain't soul food that's jamaican food i love it now don't get me wrong i'm cultural but i still like me some collard greens and macaroni and cheese and man y'all ought to talk to me sweet potatoes and yams and man they bought sister birds they had some of them flat biscuits hey i tell brothers jeremiah brother jerry my boy ain't got no syrup brother jeremiah we knocked the man said hey y'all they got no syrup the man told me jeremiah boy you must be for the country well i tell you what we we had a real wonderful time and uh really good results so we appreciate the lord and he sent us greetings let's read the scriptures and we'll get out the way in about 45 minutes the lord say the same uh from the first verse it says in the beginning of the sabbath as it began to dawn towards the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other married to the sepulcher and behold there was a earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it his countenance was uh was like lightning and his raiment white as snow and for the fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for i know that you seek jesus who jesus which was crucified he is not here but he has risen as he said come see the place where the lord lay may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word this morning you may be seated i want to use as a topic this morning he is not here uh and i'm not gonna preach an easter message this morning it's it you know i know um oftentimes ministers they take these scriptures and they they they preach a easter sermon and things of that nature which is appropriate for easter but i know easter has passed but we've been inspired since easter one of the things i've learned in studying scriptures there's there's a real depth of scripture and i think i said it last time there's so many layers to scriptures it's that writing it and i think it's it's so easy um um when we look at scripture to get become historical right i'm glad brother branham preached a message raising him out of history um i'm i'm grateful that for just the inspiration of the holy spirit and i think too this this for all of us as you study in the scriptures and studying the message i mean i know you're not ministers you probably don't get inspired like a minister but uh i'm grateful for the holy spirit that we we can be inspired and see see things that a lot of times people uh do not see as it relates to the scripture and i just try to be able to be inspired by the holy spirit um and we i just kind of as we we build want to look at the life of christ and and and just try to bring out some things that we hope that'll help us as as believers is that right we need help is there no matter no matter how long we we we we've uh we've been in church and things of that nature we we all need help we all need something to to just kind of elevate us a little bit more like brother troy was just saying brother jack has been talking about change i i got inspired off with that too but uh i guess inspired by hearing the brethren um uh and and we we all do it's it's it's the scripture says um it's it's here a little there a little in in the old testament talks about uh the the children and going in there and he'll give him the land not all at one time but he'll give it to him just a little bit by a little bit by a little bit but now let's stop a minute he's going to give you a right it's not like you're not getting anything i can't stand to hear people that talks about ain't nothing going on and ain't nothing happening in church and well i don't even know what church you go to i just haven't i have to wonder what your feet know amen that that you have this this mindset that there's nothing happening there's there's nothing going on if that's the case we ain't never gonna make a rapture we're never gonna get a body change if there's nothing going on amen we'll never change we'll never see any sort of change but sometimes y'all just ought to pray for me now sometimes change just takes place in increments you know sometimes we want to see big changes dramatic dramatic no no it don't happen like that because sometimes we get ourselves in positions and places over time and you know we find ourselves just out here but that's not what i come to preach on this morning y'all keep praying for me um we i as i was studying the scripture um i realized church you know the the modern day society they want to mirror uh individuals right we want to mirror athletes you you find young kids out you know on the court and they want to you know mimic step you know uh uh lebron you know they they got all of these mimics and they want to mirror these individuals that you can do that but that won't never make you that you know patting your chest and throwing your your three up won't make you step is that right he's a he's uh filthy and wonderfully made but but i i think that when when we look at scripture uh and if we really want and i don't you know i'm like troy i love church and i want to i don't want to mirror a man you know i've sat the men as ministers and and i just don't want to be like anybody else i don't like to be put in no box don't try to force me into something that i'm not because i'm fearfully and wonderfully made but but if if i mirror anybody i want to mirror jesus christ [Music] [Applause] i want to i want to mirror the the because when we look at christ we see the great masterpiece is that right how many believe that christ was the great masterpiece if you don't go back and read the masterpiece and listen to the tape he's the he's the the greatest example that humanity has ever had is that right uh is is jesus christ and and one of the things that uh maybe if if we could pull up the quote from perfect faith um 1963 i want to maybe read this uh quote before we get started to lay a foundation because if i don't i'll take off and then probably never read it but it'll be okay if i didn't uh i i want to read us something that just to get give us a a a little background i think it'll be important for us as as we go along um this morning uh because when we look at when we study the scripture and we look at at christ as things that you know i see that's important for me as a person in my spiritual life and in my natural life um we'll start at at um verse 63 i'm y'all bad with me my printed on work i'm troy told me oh and i i need to get like them and um this just be too much work for me this stuff don't be wanting to act right and i've been got vexed up up here uh but here here in the message of perfect faith and here's the background of it but there's a part that i want to get to where jesus christ was talking about the the disciples and and how they they failed in situations and things of that nature right he says now remember uh they had the word and the word was flesh then that was christ christ was walking with them he wasn't in them yet and i'll be the first to tell you without christ you automatically gonna fail amen as a christian is that right amen you can't have it up here you know that won't be enough you just can't have it in your spirit be religious and traditional you gotta be born again you gotta have a birth is that right we we've heard those things okay he says um and the word told them i give you power amen he said i give you power and they had the power but they didn't have the faith to operate uh the word that was in them right see you you you can have something uh but but it's it's like benjamin franklin he said i got it he was all excited he didn't have a clue of what he really had he knew he had something but somebody had the amen come on the scene and just kind of put things together thank god for it we got lights we ain't got to worry about candles we got ac praise the lord hallelujah because you know us we with ac we'd be around here fanning right so but he had something right and we have something but but we we just need to learn more about it right and how and how to operate uh in what we have is that right glory to god i i'm glad god has bought us from a mighty long way is that right uh uh because if we were still in some of the places we we just we just have our names on the book right and we won't know how to operate what we got we got something and it's and it's powerful all right uh but he says i give you power they had the power but they didn't have the faith to operate the word that was in them see what i mean but jesus had it this is the part i wanted i want to get get to jesus had it he was the word right and and see we are too and we are also y'all real quiet on me we out of word is that right we are the word all right i don't want to leave you out there on no island no we we got to get a perspective of if we're born again if we're not just religious and things of that nature right we ain't we're not here preaching religion and church membership i heard brother jack kind of kneeling that down i said boy i'm glad better you than me cause that was me preaching everybody to be shut down i'm glad the pastor was saying those things so i could amend the pastor i could i could come back but he said oh bring him here how long would i suffer you uh he had faith with his power how did he he said i can i uh can do nothing in myself why now he said he relied upon and this is the part that i kind of want to maybe get us into the layer foundation as we we go along right uh because a lot of times what we find people don't know who we are we we we really don't we don't know who we are as an individual we don't know what we got you know uh and things that people walk away from from from truth and and this is just because of a lack of knowledge or lack of understanding is that right glory to god but that was not so for him he said uh why he relied upon what he was [Music] now i'm not i'm not just attaching that to him we got to be able to rely upon who we are it's so it's so important right who are we right now i'm not going to do the natural i'm going to do the spiritual this morning who are who are we as as individuals in this building this morning right that's that we say we're part of spirit and true tabernacle and we are but but who are we by the word it's the most important thing right he says uh he relied upon what he was he relied in knowing that he was the word important points right important points these things are so important for when when we when we're faced with with trials when when you know we're faced with situations when our children are sick well i gotta call the pastor why right i i know the scripture the scripture that says you know for us when we run into problems to call the elders but the bible also says they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover well praise the lord now now what y'all going to do brother jack is in canada right now probably with no connection maybe what thank god we got all this technology because in times gone by you couldn't have been able to reach him now we got what's happening all this you might be able to give him a call but think about it what it was you had to rely upon who you were and what's been given to us amen uh as christians is that right he said who uh so he says he had faith in god who made him the word he was god the word and they was in him and and that give him faith because he understood his position right all of these all of these things are so important for us right we have positions outside of this building right as husbands as wives we have positions outside of the local church outside of the local body and and and we gotta learn how to uh uh uh and rely upon that and understand our position and understand what goes along with that because jesus did and this is the reason why in the age that we let me finish this and then i'll i'll move on i'll pick up some speed and we'll we're going out of here right um and that gives him faith because he understood his position he know what he was because the scripture had said he was this and he every scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was therefore he relied upon what god had made him and if he did that then can't we rely upon what god has made us as believers i'm about to do a brother digs i felt a brother digs on that right see it's it's so important for us amen to know who we are and understand all of these things because these things is important listen jesus lived and and operated under conditions about like we under the the climax of the old testament we could see for the most part uh laotian conditions blindness right the the people were blinded the the evils of that day just look at how how uh evil the age that jesus christ operated in was so much so that when a man got his ear cut off right jesus picked it up and put it back on and they still cried for his blood that's that's a real evil that's real evil right so much that when when i'm watch the spirits because spirits don't die a man that was right according to the word of god and they still cried for his blood crucify him let's get rid of watch this so much so they were willing to take the wrong for the right is that right and we we right here we we right here wrong has become right and right has become wrong now and people will fight you tooth and nails regardless of of of you could present to them all of the bible that you want to and answer all of the questions that that they have but once people get up under a spirit it takes god to a man quick and uh or like you know uh paul knock them off of the high horses a whole lot of folk need to be knocked off for their horses is that right it's it's the truth glory to god but when when we look at jesus right he relied upon he knew positionally who he actually was so he was not deterred right now i'm preaching this morning right because see so often with we're thrown off with with uh little happenings and different things that take place in our life they throw us off they shake us we we shake them to the core people get so shook up sometimes they can't hardly come to church we we we christians as long as as as the power of god is moving and and we're being pulled down and preached with somebody right and and we we we're happy and things of that nature but when we leave the building and the front we we kind of like the children of israel the first little thing first a little attack of the enemy and we just ready to quit we're ready to throw our hands up and we're ready we're ready to go back and things of that nature but you don't find that when when you look at the masterpiece show me one place in the scripture where jesus christ was ever deterred by anything he was never he was never traumatized he was never moved by anything that that amen uh came in his life nothing nothing bothered jesus christ why he he understood who he was listen jesus understood scripture now i'm preaching to me when when i look at these things i'll be like ouch wow right because i mean and here's the thing jesus jesus uh lived in in the same elements that we live in come on he as as much as deity was veiled he was human he ate he cried at the grave of his friend is that right so so he had compassion he had feelings his homie died come on his homeboy died i got to bring it in 2022 on for y'all his homie died and you know i don't care gangsters cry let the homie you see him they might be in the cut with it right but he wasn't detoured got to a place and say take me where you laid him why you know what at all at all times at and every point jesus had a confidence and who he was and he had a confidence in scripture we one day we're going to realize we it's so important for us to be scripturally sound right and and not emotionally dependent well praise the lord i'm gonna get some praise up in here after a while right see and i'm learning this more and more as i go along right because i ain't no different than y'all i get in my feelings in a heartbeat right and that's a real battle for all of us come on that's a real battle for all of us i get offended i get insulted come on now right y'all y'all the same way y'all gonna feel offended and all of that and things of that nature but you know i come to realize man that's just a part of of what i got to go through as a christian but i gotta constantly try to and it's a real battle remain amen uh uh scriptural at all time understand scripture one of the things that i realize in and looking at at jesus's life jesus had an ultimate destination come on sometimes people in church don't know where they going that's naturally and spiritually we don't know what we're doing and where we're going i'm i'm i ain't trying to hurt your feelings but can i preach this morning right it's the truth it's so important because see jesus realized he was destined to certain things right it was only one point in scripture and i i can't say i fully understand that in gethsemane and maybe that was we could say that that was the flesh part of the man that that that actually prayed boy if there's any way you know possible come on we didn't all been there let this thing pass but but he got to the point where he said well once he find found out this going to be a real powerful statement once he found out what the will of god was he said you know what not my will wow wow now i set a mouthful then because a lot of times we we can no we we get kind of like uh balaam right he had the perfect word of god but uh he would rather be in the permissive will of god than the perfect will of god he had the perfect will of god don't don't touch it don't bother with it and things of that nature but he was willing and sometimes we do that we'd rather be in the permissive wheel because you ain't one or the other you're either operating and walking in the permissive wheel or the perfect wheel right that's the entire world right come on i mean you you you deal with different subjects scripturally and and you we look at the nominal world we look at all of these different things and what we find is either the the perfect will or the permissive will of god right but we we want to be scripturally in the uh perfect will of god is that right that's why you you have to appreciate amen uh elijah's ministry son of man brother branham however you want to place it you you have to appreciate it because of what what he taught scripturally right amen and there's a difference right it's a will but what will permissive or perfect jesus never operated in the permissive will of god he was always in the perfect will of god he understood a man from the very beginning amen what the will of the father was for him [Music] right and and if you got after the word he would correct you because when his mother in them came your father and i whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa right i'll say that again right he like listen man if joseph was my father i'll be building but but you know what the what the will of my father is is that uh with the right kind of sacrifice right we the right kind of example for the church is that right glory to god my my life will show the church how to operate right glory to god you know i when i look at the the life of christ sometimes i get ashamed of myself as a christian well i ain't gonna get much praise this morning i'mma preach to y'all whether you say a man or not i don't really need them i'ma give you something to go home with is that right it's sometimes when we look at when we look at our life's lives based upon the word we should spiritually be ashamed of ourselves because because you know what it it it kind of shows us that that um we're not on the level that we should be amen as saints of god that have been around the gospel for for as many years as we we've been around the gospel is that right and and so when when hey i can use me as an example when i look at myself and i see things like this in the scripture it's like lord help me right uh i don't try to make any excuses when i go down in prayer when excuses start coming out like lord i ain't here to make no excuses come on what i did this because of this no don't make excuses and don't make people your excuse is that right i did it because i chose to do it right and wrong was before me and i made the conscious choice to do the thing that i did so so i'm not going to use my husband i'm not going to use my wife i ain't going to use my boss right no you did it you made a decision you made a choice to do it you over you overrode the the perfect will of god to do it come on we're full of excuses now god i ain't be trying to hear it though but we be trying to you know give it to him you know doll it all up and you know god this guy like look man just be real with yourself just say come i just come to the lord say lord help me i i'm just i'm still a work in progress huh we all are we all are we all still work in progress right gloria we might be looking good this morning and all that but you know we still are working but ain't nothing wrong with that you know what church i'm not ashamed to say that i'm i'm a work in progress glory to god wow right we all i was i was i was looking at uh td jake's talking to his daughter in this little some kind of little segment that they was having and you know here's a here's a man that man clearly probably is above me that's where the way the world looks at him and in a manner you know i know he nominated we we like to bash bash denominations and things of that nature but i i think we can learn some stuff right from from different people and talking with different different people you you can you can still grow and learn see i'm you know why i ain't afraid you know what i'm not really afraid of anybody because i know who who i am as a person i i understand scripture right so so i'm i'm not afraid sometimes i hear brother jack talk and he said it sunday but folas about how he he read such and such books and see you don't read other folk books and some people are crucified for that but that's just to me nonsense right but he said he read uh i can't think of a guy's name i know i was actually with brother jack when he bought them books right we we we uh we went out i don't know it's a minister huh yeah y'all helped me right now did he say it now now do we crucify him for that right because it's it's all info information that's needed but he made it he made a statement being married to his wife 37 years right he still saw where he still needed after 37 years to grow kids out the house and everything else but but you know he realized in areas that still room for growth let's never get to the point or place where we feel like we don't need to grow you're only kidding yourself you're only kidding yourself that's the youngest i mean you know i've been around for a while that don't mean much right that don't really how long i've been around what i understand what means more to me is how much of what we're understanding we're applying that's becoming tangible not just intellectual because with a gift i can preach from one level to the next just depending on the inspiration of god but how much of it is a reality how much of is see when we look at jesus jesus life was a living breathing reality of what a lighthouse looks like what salt looks like right see jesus could come in in a community and people get thirsty well praise the lord jesus met the woman by the way right and all of a sudden she was coming to get some water but he had he had something that was far beyond and think about it think about it by being influenced by by being in the presence of of of jesus christ she forgot what she was coming for her whole life was transformed she forgot about the pot she probably forgot all her worries all of her cares everything was can can people say that about us come on now now cause we're looking at the masterpiece and if it and if it was good enough for christ and then if it's christ in bright form what about us this morning oh glory to god glory can can the people leave our presence and say come see a man right come see a man now you know we everybody's in that category well i'm a female no can see a man the man is christ come see a man right a man that that could influence people's lives right so much and let's think look at the conditions right because we we get bothered by laid out of sin and lay out of sin conditions these things were pathetically spoken to be here right the all of these agendas and everything things that brother jack been preaching on these things has been pathetically spoken right before these conditions ever ever fully come to maturity the bible said as it was in the days so shall it be right and and sometimes we get all throwed off for what why am i throwing off about it the bible say these things will be here right jesus wasn't moved why he was reliant see and this this is the thing when we leave here this morning it's it'll be important for us to really fully a man sit down and really look at ourselves from a scriptural standpoint get a have a scriptural absolute right have a scriptural absolute knowing scripturally amen who i am and and why i am based upon this little bull cause if it's just emotions and my mama take me to church buddy those things go those things gonna fall off i'm telling you look at this look at the amount of people we've seen over the years right that have come to church and where they at that's right and see by the grace of god we still here i'm grateful the blood ain't lost his power brother quaker right glory to god i'm grateful for that huh but but but think about it right it's important to be able in the midst like sister bird singing song when i don't feel nothing see regardless of what i feel i can look at the word and the word says i'm this i'm king and priest i am now am i a son of god not down the road right now i'm a son of god [Applause] and i just went off come on oh whoa we were at a quick church because we just went off we just we just yelled at somebody that pulled in front of us i do that all the time but i'm still y'all do too but i'm still a son of god huh i'm still a son of god you cannot take that away from me when we make bad decisions we still got to know i'm a son of god we all make bad decisions bad choices in so many areas but that that that see one thing about it is what flesh and blood didn't reveal this to me right so flesh and blood can't take this away from me hallelujah when i don't and sometimes man i don't feel i don't feel good in the flesh i don't feel good mentally psychologically but something that's real deep yes right come on i hope y'all got that that deep that deepness that that depth in the soul that that helps you to override because i'm quite sure jesus christ living in the flesh right and coming and not light right being different come on because we we're different and people don't like to be different especially young people right now i'm a little older now i got a few more weeks and i'll be joining the 60 clue god but i feel all right [Applause] you know i was talking to somebody he said man it feel good to be a blessing because i got friends in the past who passed away and everything else and i'm still here by the grace of god but you know the the hardest thing is to live in a society where everybody is is is going one way and you you you going upstream against the current all right that ain't easy i'm gonna say that again y'all didn't get that right cause constraint is the gate broad is the way right your broadway's a lot of folk on broadway go to new york city you'll find a lot of folk on broadway been there several times in my lifetime you know i used to live i used to be paul i'm gonna leave that alone we stayed in new york doing something foolish but i was foolish then 20. but narrow is the way and few that right and and these are principles you know uh that that our young generation needs to know it's okay to be different it's okay to sound different to talk different you don't necessarily have to have all of the the street lingo and be polished in that and and empty well praise the lord these things as parents you need to tell your children right my kids were you know they they you know they different and i mess with them and they don't especially one of my children boy they don't like that and not be just be kidding because they believe that alone children they because they sound different than me you know but can i just preach to y'all i'm black too i'm black you know but you hear them talk you'll be like put you behind that wall i'll be wondering wondering who back there then you come from round the wall oh that's all i'm saying but i'm saying that to say there's nothing wrong with that and sometimes kids need to know that you don't have to be versed right and and you know the the black american culture right it's okay to be different it's okay to teach your children see nobody told me coming up i'm just preaching that that you know it was gonna be okay for me to be different you know could i always want to be identified with with the homeboys and things of that nature instead of living a life and letting the home boys right be like me i was listening to this guy he was talking to uh i can't i can't remember the black reporter name and uh they was having conversation of the kid with the went to jail he not a kid now about 50 something he went to prison when he was 19 for drug trafficking got 15 years he did six years uh in prison and the rest uh on paper to it till he got off and he was saying when he got to prison he said it was buckwild he said he was so wild he said but the oh geez he said they got together they said they saw something in him that was different right and and and he said they said if we could if we could get this one individual right here we get the rest of the young fellas in prison that's real that's real insight right that's that's real insight if we could transform this and they say they got it and when they got him he was able to change the prison system in texas because of the knowledge that he obtained he was able to influence uh sit-ins and things of that nature and they would move them around because they don't like you to have that kind of influence and power right come on preach with me somebody see the devil does not want us to recognize the power and authority that's been given to us right all power's been given to us right when he descended but sometimes we operate like we powerless and jesus right we we ran the call he never operated that way you know jesus christ had had a praise the lord i had to take up some abroad trust true our time i've been moving slow now ain't going to be that long right um um um but i lost my train of thought jesus you know i enjoy watching this jesus understood who he was right he understood his surroundings yes yes right come on church people don't these things trouble me sometimes just on on different on different level levels it's so much going on out here where you gotta understand your surroundings and the people that you're dealing with right jesus christ was was so powerful he could discern uh uh the hearts of different individuals the young rich ruler right the woman at the well see we got to have real discernment especially in this hour that we're living in and and young people and young girls and young guys right we go we get so effectuated right by looks and features and things of that nature where where we we lose our sense of discernment vice versa of preaching don't teach this kind of stuff hardly no text books this come by life folk growing up right we're coming in contact with folk jesus came in contact with folks all the time right amen get the discernment peter came and said you this you ditch your name this right uh uh one brother came he said well how you know me rabbi he said but let me tell you something i know you when you was way over there come on preach with me somebody see and and as you grow and mature amen you know things when you see it way over there i know sometimes i seem like i'm crazy i ain't all right not not at no time right it's the truth anyhow you arrogant brother smiley i'm truthful i'm honest that's all that is right i i ain't gonna be naive for the sake of folk i guarantee you that i try not to put my foot in my mouth about things but i'm i'm not gonna be naive you can't be y'all real quiet on me all right this this won't get you shouting but i guarantee you to get you thinking we and realistically we're living in a society where we we got people interacting with people these young sisters my little nieces and things of that nature my daughters and my sons and and and and you know they got to be told these things right these young fellas that ain't married and and you know you can't be naive right you you gotta you gotta operate amen under another spirit right discerning things is happening dude look at the world we living in people kidnapping and all this kind of stuff and you got to teach folks something well i feel like i feel like peter said in the scripture well as long as i'm here i guess i'll just have to teach on these things that won't make you shout but but it'll give you something when you leave here to hold on to is that right i i say that i shouldn't say that i told the lord lord help me bother with folk by shout because i don't necessarily need y'all to hey man i'll shout right but i just bother with y'all i i like to pick a little bit but i don't really need it but i said lord help me not to do that because i don't know people might take offense to it and i'm not here to be offensive i'm here to educate us right but let me move on can i get about 15 minutes to just wind this up because i always have a lot to say right you know cincinnati should always tell me pastor and when you say you're gonna be short then the times you'll be real long i said i was going to be short but i might be real long she's always you could hear in the back huh she would hit me with she would hit me with one of them like not but i'm a i'm but but let's let's kind of maybe wind up because i it's so like i say it's it's so many layers and it's it is so so much to say it's so much need to be said it's so much it's so much going on that that we just need to talk about it be be real and talk about it everybody want to be hush-hushing and don't say this and don't talk about this why not it needs to be talked about why wait why wait till you to folk in jail or folk pregnant or folks messed up or folks mentals is gone before we talk about anything you know the prophet of god he talked this he talked about the young girl who lost her mind over a boy i don't want to see nobody losing their mind over old nappy head boy who don't even understand who he is right glory to god come on but you see it all the time like i say this layers there's layers to life right and you know what i'm i'm finally realizing you know what what my uncle meant when he was trying to talk to us when we was 20 and he was 40 and we didn't give him the time right to listen i realized boy i'm up now right i've got some years and some experiences you know i was working i was working with with one of my my youngest first cousin's son this week and he's not a kid he's 25 years old and man that kid caused such a ruckus on the job that not that i was scared of him because i don't i ain't scared of a man but i i was i was afraid because if he would have did the wrong thing that would by by us being family it would have caused a domino effect it would put his daddy in a position and then it would put me in a position because that's my cousin but that's his son and he was blowing up at everybody and i was saying to myself look you don't want the old man and the kid the guy he was was talking noise to it's like you don't even know that man that man a preacher today but he ain't always was no preacher [Music] see you don't even know his story you just see him as some older guy working on the job and you blowing up and you tense and you feel like you're ready and you know to do a will smith [Music] he tell my he was all huffing and puffing i'm trying to i'm trying to you know defuse the situation and he you know blowing it up and i feel like just slapping him and walking away and i'm saying to myself you ain't gonna slap that dude right there and walk away so let me walk away so i'm gonna be busting you upside your head will smith got away with that because he was on primetime tv but you if you hit that guy and walk away you're gonna be in trouble and you know but these things need to be said okay let me let me get on track here here watch watch the leadership of god the destination of god look at look at the environment you you always got three kinds of believers right and and here jesus i'ma say this and it's gonna hurt there's times where believers not making believers or unbelievers believers don't understand prophecy times where believers do not live under uh a scriptural expectation believers not make believers or unbelievers because believers right it's and i'm saying this for a reason we gotta live under a scriptural expectation we gotta live pathetically y'all with me right because that's how jesus lives if you notice jesus said all times jesus went to church they gave him the bible he turned to the to the scriptures that were pertaining unto him it was it was all and i thought boy that was masterful jesus gave a master class on living like a son of god and all the times he could turn to the world and say this here is pertaining unto me and and this is pertaining to somebody else at all times right he was just gave a master class well we ought to really get in the book right and really study the class right so so that we're not failing at what we call christianity and being a christian right because jesus never did show me one passage right it was not by chance right that that jesus you know found himself a man in the position that he was in amen with the romans and and and and having to go to pilate and things like that that those things wasn't by chance right when pilar said listen like man i got power to you know dude jesus man you ain't got no power over me but what my father's giving you right jesus understood scripturally that's what he relied upon i just said to my fool that's what he relied upon he relied upon the scripture he spoke pathetically is that right he told he told the disciple he said it's a lot of stuff that i'd like to tell you but he said y'all ain't even ready for it huh there's a lot of things sometimes you know you can preach but you'll be wondering and the people ready for it right because you kind of sometimes you just wonder if i say this how they gonna take this come on preach with me somebody right listen let me tell y'all something i don't never have no ill will towards anything or anybody right but sometimes i i'll be hesitant because you know you know people take you wrong sometime but but i just can't help looking at things based upon the scriptures i was taught by a prophet i don't know who you always talk about come on well praise the lord likes i was taught by a prophet and and i realized even brother branham and his ministry amen it it was the same thing the people attitude see we got to watch our attitudes because it really shows us who we are not what we say we are but who we are right because when when when you know he preached he got the same results and that's william brown me crazy look at all the story go on the internet and look at the things that they said about her right and then people come to you and you got any problems with the message no why i don't see what you see i just don't see what you're looking at when i when i see look at the world i see life right when when i look i see myself i see what he's try he he brought to us right glory to god amen but but jesus in in his life that was an ultimate destination right and the grave wasn't it right the the grave was a a temporary stopover the grave had a purpose right you said why you say that to say this sometimes you know uh and i'll say this as christians every segment of our life right we've always got to keep in mind there's a purpose if i'm here there's a purpose in me being here just like you look at joseph right you look at daniel you look at the three hebrew boys you look at you look at jonah even jesus told him about jonah as jonah is it was three days in in the the the belly of a whale so shall the son of man be right he was speaking pathetically right there there's a power associated in prophecy and see we have got to be prophetic at all times we got to see ourself in the scripture from a prophetic standpoint and we gotta prophesy cause life and death is in the power of the tongue see and so we have got to be pathetic in what we're saying regardless of where we're at come on come on cause we get down and you know i ain't nothing and i ain't isn't it that would be saying show lane you right you're dead right hundred percent right right and instead of and it's so easy to say i'm the head and not to tell you ain't got two nickels to rub together you feel like you're the last person in line but i'm the head and not the tail i'm above and not believed and you wonder how you gonna pay your next bill huh pathetically the power of prophecy we don't understand that sometimes or we we lose sight and and the first time something come i'm a living witness i do it but but i'm still growing right 30 something years it's this right here that gives me my problems but i thank god for this that gives me my solution right amen glory to god see jesus jesus was was pathetic at all times and speaking jesus understood his final destination he told him in the book of saint john he said boy in a little while the world won't see me no more they'll be searching everywhere wander into it but you'll see me right he said it's the coming of time i ain't just gonna be with you but i'm gonna be in you and then i'm gonna lead you and guide you into all truth so so death had its purpose here's the problem here's the problem you cannot let or allow folks to be your expectation watch this watch believers right when they got there right we know the people around them the ones who put them there they was expecting them to stay there they didn't understand the power of prophecy right they didn't understand scripture they couldn't see his ministry he was all the time fighting carnality they wanted him to be a natural king with a natural kingdom he said but if that's the case then my people will be fighting but this ain't that right glory to god i didn't come to establish uh a natural kingdom on this earth in this condition i'm gonna be king of a kingdom after a while by and by after this thing has been renovated done away with burnt up by fire right but not now i come from the work of redemption right glory to god they these individuals need to get paid huh and so and so as much as the grave was necessary death was necessary sometimes it's necessary for god to allow us to be in the states and the positions that we're in but but it's not the end goal of god see death is necessary in the natural we're all going to go there set for if you're lying remaining but it's just it's just it has its purpose right but it's not the in destination right glory to god death was necessary he needed to take some keys see calvary he took the stinger he needed to get some keys see there was a work being done and all of the people around them weren't doing number crime they was in depression come on that's us sometimes it's duel church for crying depressed right jesus hadn't got a grave and a group of brethren were walking around all sad in a moping moped spirit and everything else he eased up on didn't even know who he was see that's church folk sometimes you realize how much people really know about scripture when you get to talking jesus stopped talking to them about scripture the things that were pertaining to him they didn't get it all they were doing were crying these people had no expectations for jesus outside of the grave come on and here was they come they come down to the grave five minutes they come to the grave that day after they had crucified that was just a temporary stopover sometimes our situation is just temporary stopovers god ain't gonna leave you in that place [Applause] no matter no matter what people think no matter what people feel all all of what roman and and the the make believers you know thought god was not going to allow his son a man to stand that's that spot right his body would not rot because of prophecy the rotten ability was there but because of the word of god god said it ain't gonna be salt and see sometimes people around you expect you to be in a certain spot see when mary and them got there they was expecting jesus to still be in the grave huh these are believers they were expecting him sometimes this why you got to know who you are you got to prophesy over yourself and sometimes when you do it people may not get it right i said my food jesus was prophesying all the time of himself getting up they were not getting it huh they were just under this limited insight they they were expecting when we get there he gonna be there and we gonna go over there we gonna weep over him and we gonna cry cause they took our king they ain't here fang he said y'all know what i'm talking about y'all got children y'all got children sometimes sometimes you you talk to him like don't seem like nothing registered he's registered they just ain't got it yet sometimes right amen they got there thank god thank god and just say well i know how y'all here right i know where y'all come you ain't here right amen see that's the key phrase he ain't here having left from a given place too right or in some other place or places he's not there why wasn't he there prophecy said he wasn't going to be there right he says listen he's not here just like he said right right and listen church that's good for us if we ever gonna make it as christians out of layout a seer we gotta be pathetic we gotta think on a pathetic line we gotta see scripture pertaining to ourselves right if if we don't we'll always be the tail and never the head but that ain't what the bible said he said i'll be a i i'll be a lender not a borrower well how i ain't got no money right now that has nothing to do with it tomorrow amen three days brought a change come on now let the musicians make their way three three three days brought about a change the old timer say on the third day heroes and he did right but that wasn't the end because he had already told her i come from god i go back to god he he was going back to a position in a place but look at the people see in in and this is why as as believers we can't allow circumstances and situations to dictate to us we gotta dictate to situations and circumstances we got to be pathetic right you know what i i was saying this uh up in carolina man i'm in a position right now and i'd be like lord i i and his human reasoning right i need a roof on my house that man told me fifteen thousand dollars i could have passed out 15 what right faced with situation you don't know your way out you got to be prophetic come on you there's no way possible i could get out of where i am just looking at the situation and crying don't cry to me speak say something put a scripture amen on your lips and say it god don't want us crying god don't want us crying well no no no don't cry huh speak say it take the word and say it speak and stand there [Applause] see that's got to be your expectation right glory to god when you say it know that the same power that you prophesy is it's it's you know think about jesus i'm finna go god in the beginning say let there be light but with no light it was nothing it was nothing it wasn't nothing but there was a power that got behind the word yeah and hoovered that's what the prophet talked now i ain't got to read all these quotes to y'all y'all need me i'll go outside cause my computer won't work back there hoovered over the word and brought it forth right god had to believe his own word if you the word you got to rely upon what god has made you [Applause] the word [Music] [Music] you know you want to make a child mad cry back with them when they cry then they get real man [Music] they be looking at you you crazier than i thought i was i thought i was i was trying to get something over on you by crying you went to making the same faces that i'm teaching y'all something too now i i ain't my kid grown y'all still babies praise god mind grown now they be like look at mama mocking me now we trying to just get you to pipe
