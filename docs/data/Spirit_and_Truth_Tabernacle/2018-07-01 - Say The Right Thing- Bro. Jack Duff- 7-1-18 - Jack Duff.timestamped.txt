[1:08:04] Sunday so I want to just take time to do
[1:08:06] that a man just give you a quick update

[1:08:13] the word of the Lord

[1:08:34] Lord as well appreciated me a man but so
[1:08:40] I just want to quickly just give you a
[1:08:42] brief update on now some things here on
[1:08:45] our progress and and the thing that I
[1:08:49] can say is that we have making progress
[1:08:52] a man and I'm grateful for that I'm very
[1:08:56] very thankful to the Lord that he allows
[1:09:00] us to be able to make progress and so I
[1:09:03] just want to give a brief update I have
[1:09:07] something here that
[1:09:09] [Music]
[1:09:13] help me read these numbers a lot easier
[1:09:16] [Music]
[1:09:22] so just really really quick what we what
[1:09:28] we pledged at the beginning of the year
[1:09:30] we took a vote and you know we were
[1:09:34] grateful that God has given us this
[1:09:36] place to worship but our focus a man is
[1:09:40] to be able to own our own place that
[1:09:43] that that's that's that's the the gold
[1:09:45] we pay a lot of money and rent a lot of
[1:09:48] money and rent per month
[1:09:50] amen to be able to come here and and
[1:09:52] rather than give it to somebody else you
[1:09:54] know we ought to own it ourselves so
[1:09:56] that's that's really what our our prayer
[1:09:58] and amen what our focus is so we pledged
[1:10:01] that the at the beginning of the year a
[1:10:04] hundred and five thousand dollars I'm
[1:10:06] sorry that place but we our goal was set
[1:10:08] at one hundred and five thousand dollars
[1:10:10] is what we need to raise over the next
[1:10:11] three years a hundred and five thousand
[1:10:14] each year and now we receive pledges we
[1:10:18] have a little forum out there that you
[1:10:20] can fill out if you want to be a part of
[1:10:22] the pledge and we receive pledges of
[1:10:24] fifty thousand three hundred twenty-five
[1:10:26] dollars which is a blessing and the
[1:10:30] other thing I want to say about that is
[1:10:31] as of last month that number actually
[1:10:35] rose okay so that number rose as far as
[1:10:39] people getting on board and saying that
[1:10:42] hey I want to help do this right so that
[1:10:45] number went from one place to another
[1:10:47] place all in one month so I'm grateful
[1:10:51] for that and we also a man wanted to let
[1:10:54] everybody know that as of as of today we
[1:10:57] have received on our pledges fifteen
[1:11:00] thousand one hundred sixteen dollars and
[1:11:03] four cents so we thank God for that
[1:11:04] let's give God praise for that
[1:11:07] praise the Lord amen and the other thing
[1:11:12] is at the beginning of the year I
[1:11:14] mentioned to you all that read and I
[1:11:18] thank God since the beginning a year it
[1:11:19] stage where it is so whether what that
[1:11:23] transfer means is that we had to take
[1:11:25] money from our building fund to help
[1:11:27] cover our monthly expenses here the
[1:11:30] church and and that's something that we
[1:11:32] never want to do because that really
[1:11:34] does not allow us to get to where we're
[1:11:36] trying to go if we keep pulling money
[1:11:37] from where we're saving and trying to
[1:11:39] cover expenses so and all of us not to
[1:11:43] do that
[1:11:44] amen what we ask everyone to do a man is
[1:11:47] if we had 37 people that would
[1:11:51] contribute $100 towards the offering
[1:11:54] every month every month and I know
[1:11:56] summertime it gets tough but I want you
[1:11:59] to remember your commitment to the Lord
[1:12:00] put God first 37 people give $100 a
[1:12:04] month an offering we will never see that
[1:12:06] rain again a man so and now thus far
[1:12:10] we've been able to do that and I want to
[1:12:12] just encourage us continue to do that
[1:12:13] that's just offering now the Bible tells
[1:12:15] us to pay time and offering all right so
[1:12:18] so you know we have and then we have
[1:12:21] what we call special offer which is for
[1:12:23] building funds but these are the three
[1:12:25] ways of giving are the three levels of
[1:12:27] giving according to scripture tithing
[1:12:28] offering and then you know special
[1:12:31] offerings like this so we're asking a
[1:12:33] man that 37 people just give $100 a
[1:12:37] month and offering and we'll never see
[1:12:40] any more range never see any more in a
[1:12:43] man glory to God so since we had to take
[1:12:46] $400 a transfer at the beginning of the
[1:12:49] year
[1:12:50] it makes our net profit or what we've
[1:12:54] saved thus far fourteen thousand seven
[1:12:57] hundred sixteen dollars and four cent so
[1:12:59] we're grateful we're very very grateful
[1:13:01] we are making progress it's not going
[1:13:03] down it's actually going up and God is
[1:13:05] good amen all the time so this is uh
[1:13:08] this is the
[1:13:10] our golden waves a brother Jack why do
[1:13:11] you do that the Bible say write the
[1:13:12] vision make it play and then he'll run
[1:13:16] that reason so that's why I do that I'm

[1:13:20] a bank god bless you can take that down

[1:16:26] towards the word of the Lord and I tell
[1:16:30] you what yeah let's just turn in our
[1:16:33] Bibles here to mark chapter 7 so man
[1:16:36] mark chapter 7

[1:16:47] certainly do that mark chapter 7
[1:17:04] praise the Lord mark chapter seven and
[1:17:07] I'm gonna start reading your verse 25
[1:17:17] to says this for certain woman whose
[1:17:22] young daughter had an unclean spirit
[1:17:25] heard of him and came and fell at his
[1:17:30] feet the woman was a the woman was a
[1:17:38] Greek Sarah Phoenician violation and she
[1:17:44] besought him that he would cast forth
[1:17:47] the devil out of her daughter but jesus
[1:17:52] said in a herd let the children first be
[1:17:56] feel for it is not meet to take the
[1:18:01] children's bread and to cast it unto the
[1:18:05] dogs and she answered in 7 a.m. yes Lord
[1:18:14] and you notice that this the colon there
[1:18:20] yes Lord just yeah
[1:18:25] stop right yes Lord no she just got
[1:18:28] called a dog but yes Lord and notice
[1:18:37] after the colon it says yet the dogs
[1:18:42] under the table eat of the children's
[1:18:48] crumbs and and he said unto her for this
[1:18:54] same right for this scene because you
[1:18:59] said the right thing goes our way the
[1:19:03] devil is going out of our daughter oh
[1:19:06] lord help us God and when she was when
[1:19:10] she was come to a house she found the
[1:19:12] devil going out and her door to lay the
[1:19:13] fun the bed can we pray father we are
[1:19:19] grateful for the privilege that we have
[1:19:21] to read the word of the Lord but it
[1:19:23] takes the Holy Ghost to bring and bring
[1:19:26] clarity to the things that we're reading
[1:19:28] we prayed it - it just anoint a man this
[1:19:31] portion of the service as you have
[1:19:33] anointed a man everything else we
[1:19:37] appreciate being in your presence and
[1:19:40] even at this moment we take every spirit
[1:19:43] that is against the Spirit of God
[1:19:45] underneath the control of the Holy
[1:19:48] Spirit and God our hearts as we just
[1:19:52] scan the congregation our hearts go out
[1:19:55] to those Amen that are not in our midst
[1:19:58] today and you know whatever the reason
[1:20:00] is so we send a man this prayer after
[1:20:04] them God in between the words and in
[1:20:09] between our hearts God our thoughts are
[1:20:12] understood by you
[1:20:14] and you know exactly what we're asking
[1:20:16] for you know exactly we were praying for
[1:20:18] I remember a lot was asking for 50 and
[1:20:24] 40 and 30 and got all the way down to 10
[1:20:27] but you gave him what he didn't ask for
[1:20:30] you gave him his family a man he'd never
[1:20:32] asked for a lot he just asked the axe
[1:20:35] for 10 in the city but you gave him lot
[1:20:37] to come out so God you know exactly what
[1:20:40] we're asking for and we pray that you
[1:20:42] would grant that this morning we bind
[1:20:44] the hands of the enemy that is at work
[1:20:47] and the lives of the people
[1:20:49] Satan loose God's people and let them go
[1:20:53] and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:20:56] pray amen amen you can be seated
[1:21:00] amen
[1:21:07] so we are just just just looking at this
[1:21:12] scripture this woman a man approaches
[1:21:20] the Lord Jesus she really doesn't have a
[1:21:24] right to approach him because at this
[1:21:28] time a man Jesus is actually coming to
[1:21:32] the Jews right this his ministry a man
[1:21:36] is coming to the Jews the Bible says it
[1:21:38] came to his own and his own received him
[1:21:40] not but he was coming to the Jews so so
[1:21:43] when Jesus used this terminology like
[1:21:47] you know it's not meat right it's not
[1:21:50] right for us to take the children's
[1:21:53] bread and when he's talk : that the
[1:21:55] children's bread he's talking about the
[1:21:57] Jews and it's been this particular
[1:21:59] instance a man but uh but it's casted
[1:22:02] unto the dogs now we realized that the
[1:22:07] Israelites rejected Christ we realized
[1:22:11] that and the Bible tells us that they
[1:22:13] were made blind intentionally a man so
[1:22:17] that we Gentiles would have an
[1:22:18] opportunity to see so since we are in
[1:22:22] the in the in the season or in the
[1:22:25] through to seven churches we've been
[1:22:27] given us this privilege to be able to
[1:22:29] see who Christ is then we can also take
[1:22:31] this scripture personally ourselves we
[1:22:33] are the children and healing is our
[1:22:35] bread
[1:22:37] hallelujah if healing is our bread then
[1:22:40] we don't have to accept being sick right
[1:22:43] if healing is our bread then you know we
[1:22:45] don't have to accept whatever the doctor
[1:22:47] says right because healing is something
[1:22:50] that you're supposed to be partaking of
[1:22:52] healing is something that that God has
[1:22:55] orchestrated this is one of the
[1:22:57] attributes that God had inside of him
[1:23:00] that he wanted to release to his people
[1:23:02] but he needed the right situation the
[1:23:05] right circumstance in order to be able
[1:23:07] to express the attribute of healing to
[1:23:09] his people
[1:23:10] a man so so we can take this personally
[1:23:13] as well but when we look at it a man
[1:23:14] from this angle today that this just
[1:23:17] woman be
[1:23:18] a menace our Phoenicians Jesus told us
[1:23:21] that it was it was not meet to take the
[1:23:24] children's bread and to cast it unto the
[1:23:27] dogs what uh what a statement for a
[1:23:29] later that's coming out of desperation a
[1:23:32] later that means his attention a later
[1:23:34] that is concerned about her daughter
[1:23:36] Amen a later that's really it men in
[1:23:39] dire straits and when she finally gets
[1:23:41] to the only person that can actually
[1:23:44] help her out he tells her it's not good
[1:23:47] for me to give bread to dogs what a
[1:23:52] statement to be good to be made and you
[1:23:55] know and and and and you know when we
[1:23:57] look at this lady she should actually
[1:23:59] speak to all of us because I don't think
[1:24:02] there's too many of us in here that
[1:24:04] would have been able to take words like
[1:24:06] that from Jesus right I mean we wouldn't
[1:24:08] have been able to continue the
[1:24:10] conversation I think we would have
[1:24:11] walked away with our heads down and and
[1:24:13] maybe we would start I mean we would
[1:24:15] have posted some things on on the
[1:24:17] internet right on social media we would
[1:24:21] have you know I went to Jesus and he
[1:24:23] said this about me we would have put all
[1:24:24] that out there right but but but not huh
[1:24:27] Amen this lady when she heard this these
[1:24:30] birds from Jesus she says yes Lord
[1:24:35] not just that just gets me yes Lord yeah
[1:24:38] yes sir I mean you might have called me
[1:24:40] a dog but you know you're still my lord
[1:24:42] you might have said this but you still
[1:24:44] my look you might allowed me to go
[1:24:46] through this but you're still my god
[1:24:47] Amen I don't care what I'm going through
[1:24:49] you a still king of my life
[1:24:51] right amen did this lady had the right
[1:24:54] attitude right and I am and you know
[1:24:57] which but I can just kind of see a man
[1:25:00] just in my own mind with that with that
[1:25:02] with that : being there that maybe she
[1:25:04] paused a little bit yes Lord and then
[1:25:07] she thought about what she was going to
[1:25:09] say and the next words are you know yet
[1:25:14] the dogs under the table and the
[1:25:17] children under the table eat of the
[1:25:19] children's crops and verse 29 when we
[1:25:22] looked at it notice what Jesus says he
[1:25:25] says and he said unto her for this
[1:25:28] saying go thy way the devil
[1:25:32] is going out in that daughter and let's
[1:25:35] let's place the sticker day he never
[1:25:38] prayed for the little girl
[1:25:44] he never prayed for he never even said
[1:25:49] anything
[1:25:50] amen I mean from his words I mean from
[1:25:54] his mouth he never formed any words
[1:25:56] about this young lady never but he told
[1:26:00] her mama for what you said mama bit
[1:26:06] because of what you said oh my god I
[1:26:10] want I want you to you know and then the
[1:26:13] title today is say the right thing say
[1:26:19] the right thing he said because the way
[1:26:23] you said it not let me let me let me
[1:26:26] take a little further not just what you
[1:26:29] said but who you said it to what you say
[1:26:34] and who you said it to if you told your
[1:26:37] daughter took me home so I want to
[1:26:42] encourage the church this morning say
[1:26:45] the right thing then you have to watch
[1:26:48] what you see because your words have
[1:26:50] power your words can change the
[1:26:54] circumstance your words can change the
[1:26:57] situation do you realize it was the Word
[1:27:00] of God then allowing us to even come to
[1:27:03] this earth the radius right now God's
[1:27:06] word changed nothing and made something
[1:27:08] out of it your your words have power and
[1:27:15] notice this is this is what she said
[1:27:19] when she said it and who she said it to
[1:27:24] that actually created a man of changed
[1:27:28] enough situation Jesus didn't have to
[1:27:31] say anything
[1:27:32] all he had to do was actually a man get
[1:27:35] her to recognize the faith that was
[1:27:38] already inside of her glory to God all
[1:27:42] I'll be here with you trying to get a
[1:27:43] few already got it go
[1:27:45] your way right go go go your way and sin
[1:27:48] be cut because of what you said say the
[1:27:50] devil is gone out of your vote based on
[1:27:53] what you said that she's trying to get
[1:27:56] Jesus to say it but Jesus ain't no based
[1:27:58] on what you said the devil just left
[1:28:01] Oh God lord help me to say the right
[1:28:06] thing I want to you know the word words
[1:28:11] and where is the powerful you know you
[1:28:13] this not the first time this happened a
[1:28:15] man over in the book of Matthew and you
[1:28:22] know also Luke 2 tells the same story
[1:28:23] but you all remember Amen the story of
[1:28:26] the Centurion and the Centurion he had a
[1:28:30] situation where he had a servant that
[1:28:32] was home that was sick and and and and
[1:28:35] and and you know this man said look I
[1:28:37] mean this he say he said I'm not worthy
[1:28:39] to go present myself before the Lord
[1:28:42] Jesus you know and and I don't want to
[1:28:45] approach me that wait so he sent some
[1:28:47] other Israelites right to go and
[1:28:49] approach Jesus they say just maybe you
[1:28:51] know maybe he'll do a favor you know and
[1:28:53] and and let him know this not for me
[1:28:55] right I'm not coming for myself but but
[1:28:58] but I gotta serve him and this service
[1:29:00] he sees he does been he treat me good
[1:29:02] right so so um I you know just on my
[1:29:05] behalf would you approach Jesus and try
[1:29:08] to get a met just a little favor so so
[1:29:11] the Bible says that he you know he was
[1:29:13] on his way
[1:29:14] Jesus was incident to Capernaum and and
[1:29:17] when Jesus was there in Capernaum this
[1:29:19] man comes and you know and see now when
[1:29:22] I read scripture and I think about being
[1:29:24] in Cooper do you know it means something
[1:29:26] to me now right I can just see this man
[1:29:29] sin in his are his little group to Jesus
[1:29:32] and and and Jesus stepping up stand up
[1:29:34] say okay I'll come and go with them and
[1:29:35] I've come to the man's house but when
[1:29:38] you read this
[1:29:39] the story of Centurion a man in an EM
[1:29:43] mark I'm I'm sorry Matthew and one in
[1:29:45] Luke it kind of it kind of presents it
[1:29:47] in two different ways so I'm kind of
[1:29:48] using both stories as I presented to you
[1:29:50] today but as as as they are approaching
[1:29:53] a
[1:29:54] in the house the Centurion leaves the
[1:29:56] house set sail all a lot the reason that
[1:29:59] I didn't even come because I don't even
[1:30:00] feel worthy for you to come underneath
[1:30:02] my room it says but uh but but I
[1:30:04] understand a couple things he say I'm a
[1:30:07] man of authority I say go and he go and
[1:30:10] I say come and he come I realized that
[1:30:13] whatever I say it's gonna be just
[1:30:15] exactly how I say it
[1:30:18] this man had even had a revelation of
[1:30:21] his position right and Jesus when he
[1:30:25] heard this man he said he said now i'm
[1:30:27] not got your indigo he gonna go with
[1:30:29] when i tell him to come he gonna come if
[1:30:31] he don't come it's gonna be some trouble
[1:30:33] if he don't go it's gonna be some
[1:30:35] trouble right so not only not only do i
[1:30:39] understand my place but these fellows
[1:30:41] around the understand their place they
[1:30:44] understand who's speaking to them come
[1:30:47] on somebody they understand what I'm
[1:30:49] trying to say right and it hang up
[1:30:51] seeing too many times
[1:30:53] i'ma say it once go come I got anger
[1:30:58] yeah I'm not gonna use a paragraph I'm
[1:31:01] not gonna use a sentence one word it
[1:31:06] cause this from the move and it calls
[1:31:07] that with the movie say I understand
[1:31:09] that I understand authority he's saying
[1:31:12] I also understand that you got power
[1:31:13] over every devil you say so
[1:31:15] if you would just speak the word then my
[1:31:19] servant will be made hope write some
[1:31:21] stuff so here Jesus looked at him in and
[1:31:25] you know and and when Jesus heard he was
[1:31:27] gonna a student and the Bible say that
[1:31:31] Jesus say yeah I haven't found this kind
[1:31:34] of faith in Israel I never seen nobody
[1:31:37] would just kind of faith so they may go
[1:31:39] find it just the same way you act you
[1:31:40] said it's supposed to be go find your
[1:31:42] servant come be made whole based on what
[1:31:43] you just say it
[1:31:44] Church I want you to I want to encourage
[1:31:47] you say the right thing now you know you
[1:31:49] can't even get godly get God to move if
[1:31:51] you ain't saying the right thing he's
[1:31:54] the high priests of your confession
[1:31:56] right and if you're not confessing the
[1:31:59] right thing you ain't gonna get nothing
[1:32:00] if you confess negative you get negative
[1:32:04] you confess positive you're gonna get
[1:32:06] positive
[1:32:07] all right let's not let me just go back
[1:32:10] to a couple of quotes that I read on
[1:32:12] Wednesday night a man will go forward
[1:32:14] from there
[1:32:16] hallelujah this is not only ours come
[1:32:18] thank you Jesus
[1:32:20] amen the Prophet says now the right
[1:32:23] mental attitude all you along here do
[1:32:27] you understand what I mean when I say
[1:32:29] the right mental attitude that that's in
[1:32:33] Tyrian had the right mental attitude the
[1:32:36] supination woman had the right mental
[1:32:40] attitude right listen say say say the
[1:32:44] right mental attitude your right mental
[1:32:46] attitude towards God's divine promise
[1:32:48] will bring any promise to parents now
[1:32:52] maybe you don't believe that you say
[1:32:54] well my faith is weak look at that say
[1:32:56] when my faith is weak he says I wouldn't
[1:32:59] confess it see that that's the thing
[1:33:02] even if your faith is weak don't ever
[1:33:06] let the devil here you see it's one
[1:33:12] thing to think it but don't say it right

[1:33:53] over old opt-in and novel you see as
[1:33:55] long as you take out it's worth in the
[1:33:57] word will produce what it promised to do
[1:33:59] is that right and I have faith believe
[1:34:02] him with all your heart glory to God let
[1:34:06] me go on I got another one here and as I
[1:34:08] was with Moses glory to God he says let
[1:34:12] him a man let him that's reach say I am
[1:34:16] strong and that that's that's what the
[1:34:17] Bible says in Joelle 310 it says you let
[1:34:20] that we
[1:34:21] Sam stone it says let let him last week

[1:35:22] sudden some of the grease pop out on you

[1:35:30] just keep moving on so soon as I thought
[1:35:32] that things I know in the name of Jesus
[1:35:33] I just kept walking right I will not
[1:35:36] stop to consider the pain I'm not
[1:35:40] waiting for pain

[1:35:54] till you lay down you waits in it now
[1:35:55] anyway donut better healing right I'm
[1:35:59] not gonna say the wrong thing I'm a
[1:36:01] sailor right hang in there by His
[1:36:05] stripes I am already healed he was
[1:36:09] wounded for my transgressions bruised
[1:36:11] for my iniquities the chastisement of my
[1:36:15] peace is upon him and with His stripes
[1:36:18] I'm already healed that's what we got a
[1:36:20] safe Church
[1:36:23] a man you know and I'm just telling you
[1:36:26] gotta say the right thing right glory to
[1:36:29] God glory to God glory to God a man what
[1:36:33] you say changes the situation what you
[1:36:35] say I'm sick oh I'm getting worse it's
[1:36:39] getting worse but eventually it'll get
[1:36:41] better well I don't want to even go
[1:36:43] through the worse I just want to go from
[1:36:46] I want to go straight to data all right
[1:36:50] let me keep going uh hallelujah since I
[1:36:56] let the weak say I'm strong
[1:36:58] see just in your heart the CC just said
[1:37:01] in your heart that I am now strong I
[1:37:03] have now accepted Jesus as my healer and
[1:37:06] never have any negative testimony
[1:37:10] anymore right so so after you confess
[1:37:13] that you can't you can't see anything
[1:37:15] negative after that anymore right amen
[1:37:17] so now we're having a negative testimony
[1:37:19] anymore just believe it and what's just
[1:37:23] attacked me first they were saying all
[1:37:25] right there it is I don't know I don't
[1:37:28] know I can't explain it I don't
[1:37:30] understand it but I just believe it
[1:37:32] right so just believe it God is under
[1:37:36] obligation or Jesus Christ is sitting at
[1:37:39] the right hand of the Father to accept
[1:37:41] you for he's setting there the high
[1:37:43] priest of your confession to make good
[1:37:46] before the Father anything that he died
[1:37:49] for right that you're confessing that
[1:37:52] he's done there you are now divine
[1:37:54] healing cannot be any plainer than that
[1:37:56] is to the weakest you do it and remember
[1:38:00] God's Word will defeat Satan anywhere
[1:38:04] any place any time and any condition
[1:38:13] [Music]
[1:38:16] whatever your condition is this morning
[1:38:19] it can be defeated and notice what it
[1:38:23] takes to defeat the devil God's Word we
[1:38:27] talked about it last week right all you
[1:38:30] you don't need a superpower right you
[1:38:33] you've got the greatest superpower you
[1:38:35] can have you get the word all you have
[1:38:39] to do is stand on the promise of God's
[1:38:40] God you sing I don't know I and
[1:38:43] oftentimes you don't have to be afraid
[1:38:45] let me tell you if you don't have to be
[1:38:46] afraid to remind God of what he said
[1:38:49] actually he likes to hear that you know
[1:38:53] I don't know if you've ever experienced
[1:38:56] this before but maybe to one of your
[1:39:00] loved ones you make a promise that you
[1:39:01] don't purchase something right and in
[1:39:04] time slip by and you ain't got that yet
[1:39:09] but they remember and they have a way of
[1:39:13] coming back and saying you know could I
[1:39:16] get this now no no no no you can't get
[1:39:18] that you can't get that but you see and
[1:39:24] when they remind you of of what you see
[1:39:26] there's something that kicks on the
[1:39:30] inside right were you like look I gotta
[1:39:33] come through because they remember I
[1:39:35] don't want to be up gonna be found
[1:39:37] Elijah right I don't want this child to
[1:39:40] think that I'm alive so I gotta come
[1:39:41] through somehow you begin to just think
[1:39:44] of ways that you can get this thing done
[1:39:46] if you were like that
[1:39:48] what you think your God is like when you
[1:39:51] remind him of what he said he will not
[1:39:55] be made a liar all right let me go on
[1:39:58] with one more here says and this is out
[1:40:01] of who was God since when the
[1:40:02] inspiration of the Holy Spirit is here

[1:40:29] want to sin you'll be right into it

[1:40:34] believe it all alone
[1:40:35] God will bring it your your testimony

[1:40:39] believe in healing and believe that God
[1:40:41] has healed you confess it and God will
[1:40:43] make your body obey your confession for
[1:40:47] he's the high priest of your confession
[1:40:49] I mean you know III find it quite
[1:40:52] amazing let me finish reading this I
[1:40:54] used to high priest of our confession
[1:40:55] Center at the right hand of the Father
[1:40:56] now with his own blood to make
[1:40:58] intercession for any confession about
[1:41:00] anything that he died for him and eat
[1:41:02] and he died to rid sin and sickness as a
[1:41:04] result of sin he was wounded for our
[1:41:06] transgressions with his stripes were
[1:41:07] healed remember that half think don't
[1:41:09] waiver stands on it you know Church you
[1:41:13] know in this hour there are different
[1:41:14] ways that the devil's attacking and as
[1:41:16] believers we got to know what our place
[1:41:18] is right we got to know you know the
[1:41:21] power of our words we have to understand
[1:41:24] that sometimes we make things worse on
[1:41:26] ourselves by what we say right amen but
[1:41:31] you know I've noticed that you know
[1:41:32] sometimes I've sat back and I watch me
[1:41:35] but I know they're going through I know
[1:41:37] they need prayer I know it but the other
[1:41:41] thing I've noticed that they too proud
[1:41:42] to ask for too proud we do you have a
[1:41:51] condition that you're going to the
[1:41:53] doctor about we having a prayer line
[1:41:55] service we're trying to elevate people's
[1:41:58] faith come to the prayer line service
[1:42:01] and watch what God do we got we got
[1:42:03] testimony what God is already there I
[1:42:05] mean here we got people in this church
[1:42:08] that's been healed of cancer other folks
[1:42:11] get cancer and will not actual prayer
[1:42:14] but I'm not now and it's one thing you
[1:42:17] know to know that I'm that God did it in
[1:42:20] brother branham's meetings that that's
[1:42:21] wonderful you can hear the tapes and all
[1:42:23] these other things you can read the
[1:42:24] books but that same God is still living
[1:42:27] right and he's right in your church they
[1:42:30] believe in healing all you gotta do is
[1:42:32] come to us provide a way and watch what
[1:42:35] God dude
[1:42:37] ain't no way if I knew God heals
[1:42:39] somebody might in my church if it's a
[1:42:42] guy here's somebody in my church of
[1:42:43] cancer and the doctor diagnosed me y'all
[1:42:46] pray for me I mean I know y'all Prince
[1:42:48] working here somebody somebody called me
[1:42:50] this morning say look I want to call the
[1:42:52] church and have them pray that I got
[1:42:53] confidence in these are people outside
[1:42:58] that don't even come to church got
[1:43:00] helping us in in the church you go to
[1:43:02] but but the people sitting in the chairs
[1:43:06] don't have confidence that something
[1:43:09] wrong with that hallelujah see this
[1:43:13] woman here in Scripture she knew where
[1:43:14] to go she knew exactly where to go and
[1:43:17] it's like look I got a I got a door
[1:43:19] that's vetch with a devil and this thing
[1:43:20] ain't right so I got an evil spirit and
[1:43:24] I need her to be free from it she know
[1:43:26] exactly who to get in contact with
[1:43:27] because if she knew who could get the
[1:43:29] job done it was nothing but the
[1:43:31] Lord Jesus but notice when she got there
[1:43:34] it was based on what she said not based
[1:43:38] on what Jesus said but it's based on
[1:43:40] what what she said can we can we just
[1:43:44] look at another scripture here amen
[1:43:48] hold glory to God let's look at this out
[1:43:51] of Matthew 17 Matthew 17
[1:44:04] hallelujah thank you Jesus say the right
[1:44:08] thing
[1:44:08] hey man Matthew 17 and picking up here
[1:44:12] verse 14 look at it says and when they
[1:44:17] were come to the multitude there came to
[1:44:22] him a certain man kneeling down to him
[1:44:23] and saying lord have mercy on my son for
[1:44:27] he is a lunatic and sore vexed for all
[1:44:31] times he falleth into the fire and oft
[1:44:35] into the water and I brought him to my
[1:44:38] disciples and they could not cure him
[1:44:42] then jesus answered and said o faithless
[1:44:45] and perverse generation how long shall I
[1:44:50] be with you how long shall I suffer you
[1:44:54] bring him hither to me jesus knew what
[1:44:58] he could do with it and this man knew
[1:45:00] what Jesus could do with it and Jesus
[1:45:02] rebuked the devil and he departed out of
[1:45:06] him and the child was cured from that
[1:45:09] very hour it goes on to say this then
[1:45:12] came to the cyclist of Jesus apart when
[1:45:15] they got separated from everybody then
[1:45:17] came two cyclists of Jesus apart and
[1:45:19] said why could not we cast him out verse
[1:45:24] 20 says and Jesus said unto them because
[1:45:28] of your unbelief oh my god now you know
[1:45:32] now we're gonna you know later on in the
[1:45:34] scripture you'll see them talking about
[1:45:36] faster than praying but the first issue
[1:45:38] that stopped this from happening is
[1:45:41] because of their unbelief right because
[1:45:43] of your unbelief of bearly I said to you
[1:45:46] if you have faith as a grain of a
[1:45:50] mustard seed ye shall say unto this
[1:45:54] mountain hallelujah amen if you if you
[1:45:59] should say to this mountain Amen remove
[1:46:02] him see I'm the place and it shall
[1:46:05] remove and nothing shall be impossible
[1:46:08] unto you
[1:46:12] like we have faith if you have faith as
[1:46:21] a grain of a mustard seed can you see
[1:46:26] that now can you see that can you see
[1:46:31] that you sitting pretty close to me you
[1:46:33] still can't see them come here first
[1:46:36] thing
[1:46:40] can you see you still can't see open up
[1:46:44] your hand can you see
[1:46:49] that's the size of a must-have see right
[1:46:51] there and now he couldn't see it but
[1:46:57] when I gave it to me knew he had it and
[1:47:00] once he got it then he knew I can see it
[1:47:04] because it's in my hand now right it's
[1:47:08] in my hand not now while I had it he
[1:47:10] just didn't I can't see that I can't see
[1:47:12] nothing but once I put it in his hand oh
[1:47:15] yeah I see that what God trying to just
[1:47:17] put some stuff in your hands keep it
[1:47:21] keep it and put it on this scripture in
[1:47:24] your Bible all you need is faith the
[1:47:32] size of a mustard seed this lady didn't
[1:47:34] even realize the faith that she had
[1:47:35] inside of her Jesus had the cavalettis
[1:47:38] think I'm gonna sit because you're
[1:47:39] saying the right things you can have
[1:47:42] what you said you all remember the story
[1:47:44] of Hattie right you remember the story
[1:47:48] had it right had it right a man had
[1:47:50] given a little offering for the building
[1:47:53] fund $20 that was a lot of money back
[1:47:56] then had it right gave $20 towards the
[1:47:58] building fund and the prophets say you
[1:48:00] know what I can't let that lady give
[1:48:01] that money that's just way too much
[1:48:03] money fun to give I'm going back down
[1:48:04] there to give this money back to her and
[1:48:06] as he was on his way the Holy Spirit saw
[1:48:08] say no no no no I did not stop the woman
[1:48:10] that gave her two pennies and put it in
[1:48:13] the Treasury I didn't stop her so don't
[1:48:14] stop handy right now why why why did the
[1:48:18] Holy Spirit stop him from from from
[1:48:20] doing that
[1:48:21] because the Holy Spirit knew that he had
[1:48:23] another blessing for Hattie right so so
[1:48:26] if you go if you go back and you give
[1:48:28] her that money you gonna hinder Hattie
[1:48:29] writes blessed right he didn't tell he
[1:48:32] didn't tell him everything right he said
[1:48:34] but just don't give the money back to
[1:48:36] just go down and you know just visit her
[1:48:38] have fellowship whatever so they sit
[1:48:40] around and they fellowshipping around
[1:48:41] the world and they talk in him and
[1:48:44] brother Branham begin to share some
[1:48:45] testimonies and one of the testimony
[1:48:47] share it was about the the squirrels
[1:48:49] that were created out of nothing he
[1:48:51] spoke them into existence amen uh here
[1:48:55] he you know he just sitting out there
[1:48:57] hunting and and the Holy Spirit's say do
[1:48:59] you believe that a man if you say to the
[1:49:01] mountain be thou removed
[1:49:03] Casa de see you don't doubt me heart you
[1:49:04] believe you can have what you say so
[1:49:06] yeah I believe that's it what you what's

[1:49:09] having fun Martin for squirrels how many
[1:49:11] you want three where you want a man like

[1:49:17] to me right he say okay I'm gonna make
[1:49:19] this thing do something so impossible
[1:49:20] that it just it can't it can't be
[1:49:22] nothing but God make it come from this
[1:49:24] way here come from that way shot the
[1:49:26] squirrel he say when he got it picked it
[1:49:28] up he said he thought he was in a vision
[1:49:30] but when he picked up the squirrel he
[1:49:32] realized visions don't bleed
[1:49:35] this ain't a vision this is reality
[1:49:38] right so he said where do you want a
[1:49:40] second one shot I mean 71 what the
[1:49:42] second second will to do shot the second
[1:49:44] one winning got it right where you want
[1:49:46] a third one when it shot that ones and

[1:49:50] but God still challenging that you might
[1:49:52] not find it but it's gonna be like you
[1:49:54] see right and they went through a whole
[1:49:56] scenario he went back to the camp talked
[1:49:58] to a couple brothers and a man and when
[1:50:00] he got there talking to the brothers
[1:50:02] when the brothers prayed a prayer he

[1:52:04] the same house but had it right it
[1:52:07] something struck up and and and and and
[1:52:09] and the reason is trucker because
[1:52:12] brother branham brought it all back to
[1:52:14] scripture said he said the same God that
[1:52:17] provided a ram for Abraham put him up on
[1:52:21] the top of the mountain where Rams don't
[1:52:23] don't live right say the same God that
[1:52:25] provided a ram for Abraham is the same
[1:52:28] God that provided squirrels for me and
[1:52:32] had it right all she said was that's
[1:52:36] nothing but the truth and do you realize
[1:52:40] because of what she said right God was
[1:52:46] pleased with what she singing
[1:52:49] and when God got pleased he total
[1:52:51] preface a now
[1:52:52] don't give her $20 back but now tell her
[1:52:55] whatever she asks for she can have her
[1:52:58] right now in this presence
[1:53:01] hallelujah Church and just like she
[1:53:04] didn't say whatever you actually you can
[1:53:05] have right now or my first problem
[1:53:08] say you say he says she said well what's
[1:53:11] gonna actually say look I can't take
[1:53:12] with actual but what I can taste that
[1:53:15] whatever you actually you can have had
[1:53:17] it right if I could put it this way she
[1:53:20] had a : and she had to think about what
[1:53:24] she was going to say Oh glory thank God
[1:53:28] you need to think about what you say she
[1:53:30] had to think about what she was Stanzler
[1:53:32] he say she say he say look your mama and
[1:53:34] daddy's sick little elderly want you
[1:53:37] acts you know you can actually heal us
[1:53:38] there you got a sister's been on the
[1:53:41] wheelchair for years we pray for her
[1:53:42] many times but right now I guarantee
[1:53:44] that girl gonna get up out that
[1:53:45] wheelchair if you actually she looked
[1:53:50] around and she had they say you pull you
[1:53:53] need money
[1:53:54] once you X for a million dollars you'll
[1:53:57] get it right now she looked at all those
[1:54:01] things and did she's looking in that
[1:54:02] same room two little boys sitting there
[1:54:06] my god laughing and snickering and and
[1:54:09] and and and and and and and and I'm
[1:54:12] concerned about the things of God and
[1:54:14] when she looked at them two boys she
[1:54:16] said no no no no no I don't need money
[1:54:18] I don't need my parents heal my sister's
[1:54:21] just fine she she got found peace with
[1:54:23] her situation cuz son must need to find
[1:54:29] peace with where we are right and until
[1:54:33] you found peace with where you are you
[1:54:35] ain't gonna go no further than where you
[1:54:37] are right you got it you gotta find
[1:54:41] peace in the midst of your storm all
[1:54:44] right but she found peace if she like
[1:54:47] she even gonna be just fine I mean Edith
[1:54:50] already you know the way the way to
[1:54:51] either bleak like look by the time I get
[1:54:53] to the other side I'm gonna get my new
[1:54:54] body so I'm good with it right here I I
[1:54:56] it's okay I keep I keep willing to my
[1:54:58] wheelchair see what the greatest thing I
[1:55:01] can ask for the salvation of these two
[1:55:02] boys say I'd like the salvation my two
[1:55:05] boys and underneath that anointed
[1:55:08] because she said that God saved her boys
[1:55:11] right there they went from laughing and
[1:55:12] giggling and snickering and you know how
[1:55:15] she got that through an offering
[1:55:20] through it all free that's how she got
[1:55:23] it right so so so you know it was if she
[1:55:26] said the right thing and by saying the
[1:55:29] right thing she received problems
[1:55:32] can I go a little further with this
[1:55:34] there's a little testimony believe that
[1:55:37] that said the right thing and I want to
[1:55:39] read about her if I can't
[1:55:42] oh my hold on one second I can't read
[1:55:45] that just yet I can't read it just yet
[1:55:48] images of Christ giving images of Christ
[1:55:52] this is something to build your faith
[1:55:54] today if I can images of Christ so it's
[1:56:00] just like his been said about a woman
[1:56:02] that maybe when she's married if she's
[1:56:06] so anxious to embrace her first little
[1:56:09] baby that she doesn't hardly know she
[1:56:11] and the heart can't can wait but her
[1:56:15] anticipation is though but behind that
[1:56:17] there is a fear if it doesn't quickly
[1:56:21] show up that she will not have this baby
[1:56:24] right so she's anxious to have it right
[1:56:28] and if it doesn't happen fast enough
[1:56:30] dishes begin to fear that she won't be
[1:56:32] able to have babies right listen say
[1:56:35] then that drives her further away all
[1:56:38] the time listen now there's a remedy
[1:56:42] there's a remedy to this there's a
[1:56:45] remedy that they do in these days and
[1:56:47] it's worked in all ages if that woman
[1:56:50] sees or believes that she's not going to
[1:56:54] give birth to this baby if she would
[1:56:57] just go out and adopt a baby right then
[1:57:01] the first thing you know she will have
[1:57:04] one of her own listen now that's proven
[1:57:08] correct 9 out of 10 times because that
[1:57:11] strain of wondering oh maybe I won't
[1:57:14] have it but that takes that little
[1:57:16] satisfaction there and and it's maybe
[1:57:18] God's Way of getting her in condition
[1:57:20] and then she would have our own baby
[1:57:22] because that scare and anticipation will
[1:57:25] finally leave her the thing that's
[1:57:28] stopping her is the anticipation and of
[1:57:30] scare
[1:57:31] now notice this he says and I love this
[1:57:34] I call this the adopt a baby faith right
[1:57:38] if you're going through something like
[1:57:40] that you adopt a baby and watch what God
[1:57:42] do to you right you said that's the same
[1:57:44] way about people who want to get healed
[1:57:47] if they can just have one little visible
[1:57:49] evidence like your ID you when he said
[1:57:50] Gihon zi stick crowd about the size of
[1:57:53] man hands Elijah says I hear this town
[1:57:55] of an abundance of rain he saw the
[1:57:57] evidence that's why many times I tell
[1:57:59] people go on start praising the Lord see
[1:58:02] because that is the adopted baby you
[1:58:07] don't see it yet but you're praising God
[1:58:09] for it anyway right that's the adoptive
[1:58:11] baby things right so start praising
[1:58:14] lordship because that is the adopter
[1:58:16] bathing because it's in her intellectual
[1:58:18] it's in its in their in their
[1:58:22] intellectual unit it comes into their
[1:58:23] soul that they're healed then the faith
[1:58:25] makes it right you got to know what
[1:58:27] you're doing you got to have confidence
[1:58:28] in what you're doing
[1:58:29] Lord I'll tell you what we need to
[1:58:32] practice some of that see it'll be like
[1:58:34] you say church it'll be like you say now
[1:58:37] this uh this woman that I want to just I
[1:58:40] want to hit and maybe I'll catch the
[1:58:44] ending of this this poet I won't read
[1:58:46] the whole thing I'm going to make the
[1:58:48] valley full of ditches and I'm gonna go
[1:58:49] to just put it at paragraph II - 5 but
[1:58:53] don't pull it up yet I want to just set
[1:58:54] it up that this woman that I want to
[1:58:57] talk to you about her name is Miss
[1:59:01] Webber and Miss Webber was dying with
[1:59:06] tuberculosis and you know she was you
[1:59:10] know whatever was there was some real
[1:59:11] real serious situation it was even so

[2:00:54] three days there was some ladies from
[2:00:56] the government Depot here where she
[2:00:58] worked

[2:01:03] if I could said if I could only have
[2:01:05] brother brother bill to pray for me once

[2:01:17] doctor just give her till morning to

[2:01:25] reminded of somebody else being healed I
[2:01:27] know what God has done but done in the
[2:01:28] past so she said said the girl come
[2:01:30] girls from out at the government where

[2:01:36] saying about brother branham right there
[2:01:38] ain't nothing to that guy he is nothing
[2:01:40] but a hypocrite said that's that's all
[2:01:44] that's all that religion is it's just a
[2:01:47] bunch of fake fanaticism and so Miss

[2:02:14] Weber she said she said not now look I'm
[2:02:16] dying and I know that but I just won't
[2:02:18] stand still for that before she died
[2:02:22] she's gonna let the devil know whose
[2:02:24] side she goes I like this I like this

[2:02:40] want to she said but I seen it just so
[2:02:43] much it seen God heal the people she
[2:02:44] said and I know the man's life but I
[2:02:47] know it's the truth now look at this and
[2:02:50] it happened to be the angel the Lord
[2:02:55] heard that Oh glory see it's all about
[2:02:59] what you're saying it's not it's not
[2:03:01] just what you see here Church what

[2:03:16] room after I got up and went and got a
[2:03:17] drink of water about three o'clock in

[2:03:39] I heard her what she said and tell her
[2:03:43] left saith the Lord
[2:03:46] she'll live and not die now Miss Webber
[2:03:51] wanted brother Branham to pray for Jeff
[2:03:54] like this lady wanted Jesus to pray for
[2:03:57] her daughter hallelujah brother Brandon
[2:04:00] a chance to pray for her because she was
[2:04:03] healed by what she say all right let's
[2:04:14] go so there you are you can go down and
[2:04:16] see if you like to been about seven
[2:04:19] years ago all right see his presence was
[2:04:22] there when she was what when she was
[2:04:24] taken up for what was right see his
[2:04:26] presence was there he found her so he
[2:04:29] come and told me what she had said what
[2:04:32] she said to these women and he had
[2:04:35] respect to her because she had respect
[2:04:39] unto what was representing God
[2:04:43] she had right and the he had respect her
[2:04:47] look if you respect God God I respect
[2:04:50] you Oh God
[2:04:54] right he had respect to her because she
[2:04:56] had respect unto what was representing
[2:05:00] God so God would do the same thing to
[2:05:03] you not to respect to me but respect to
[2:05:06] respect to him to Christ the one who
[2:05:08] died for your healing if you just give
[2:05:10] her specks to him and his word God will
[2:05:12] do the work for you a man that is right
[2:05:16] Church miss Weber said the right thing
[2:05:20] and it pleased God it brought it healing
[2:05:23] a man to her because she said the right
[2:05:25] thing we gonna leave here there's gonna
[2:05:28] be different trials that come into our
[2:05:29] life but in the midst of those trials
[2:05:32] you still got to say the right thing no
[2:05:38] matter what the devil bring don't don't
[2:05:40] don't change your testimony based on
[2:05:42] your trial don't do that
[2:05:44] he's still just saying God you know he
[2:05:46] got to be God in the good times and he
[2:05:49] also got to be God in the bad times and
[2:05:52] that's why that's why I David David did
[2:05:54] say I will bless the Lord in the good
[2:05:56] times he even say how I bless the Lord
[2:05:59] at bad times no he said I will bless the

[2:07:49] seen and I'll testify that God is
[2:07:52] already healed so I know he said God had
[2:07:56] shoes this ministry and I know what God
[2:07:58] has done and because she respected God
[2:08:01] God risk did her say the right thing say
[2:08:11] the right thing say the right thing
[2:08:13] Church I can't I can only encourage you
[2:08:17] to say the right thing my God my God my
[2:08:21] God my God my God
[2:08:23] all glory glory glory this woman we pick
[2:08:27] up over here in Matthew 15 the same
[2:08:31] letter later we read about in mark 7 all
[2:08:39] glory thank you Jesus
[2:08:45] verse 21
[2:08:53] then Jesus went thence and departed and
[2:08:57] to the coasts of Tyre and Sidon behold a
[2:09:03] woman of Canaan came out of the same
[2:09:05] coasts and cried unto him saying have
[2:09:07] mercy on me O Lord
[2:09:08] I'm son of David my daughter is
[2:09:10] grievously vexed with a devil but he
[2:09:13] asked her not a word ignored her and his
[2:09:16] disciples came in from Saul but besought
[2:09:18] him saying sent her away for she crieth
[2:09:21] after us so if I can get his attention
[2:09:24] I'm gonna get your attention since y'all
[2:09:25] hang it around him but he answered and
[2:09:29] said I am NOT sent but unto the lost
[2:09:32] sheep of the house of Israel being came
[2:09:36] she and worshipped him saying lord help
[2:09:38] me but he answered and said it is not
[2:09:42] meet to take the children's bread and to
[2:09:44] cast it to dogs and she said truth Lord
[2:09:50] another : yet the dogs either the crumbs
[2:09:56] which fall from the master's table then
[2:10:00] jesus said unto her look at what he said
[2:10:03] a woman great is thy faith C be it unto
[2:10:09] thee even as thou wilt and her
[2:10:10] daughter's made hold from that very hour
[2:10:12] C great is your faith what it is this
[2:10:14] was what we would consider mustard seed
[2:10:16] faith it was a pure faith and the reason
[2:10:20] Jesus told me how faith the size of
[2:10:21] mustard seed or like a mustard seed the
[2:10:24] reason that he would say is because a
[2:10:25] mustard seed can't be mixed with
[2:10:28] anything else right so so your faith
[2:10:31] ain't gotta be big it can be just as
[2:10:36] small as that little seed that I just
[2:10:37] gave really near mine but when it's pure
[2:10:40] like that then it'll bring any promise
[2:10:43] to pass
[2:10:52] this last little thing I want to share
[2:10:59] the Prophet was going to this young
[2:11:01] girl's house to pray for her Eid
[2:11:04] she was uh you know she was she heard
[2:11:09] testimonies about him praying for others
[2:11:11] they had been healed and so on and so
[2:11:12] forth and she's like you know I know God
[2:11:14] can do it for me I know God can do it
[2:11:16] you know and we and we say those things
[2:11:19] but we don't really believe it
[2:11:20] our faith is like God can do it for you
[2:11:23] but I'm not sure he can do it for me but
[2:11:28] God don't want us to have that kind of
[2:11:29] faith you're gonna have faith has got to
[2:11:31] be I know God will do it for me right so
[2:11:35] so so this young lady she was daring
[2:11:38] she's like yeah I've seen this in a
[2:11:39] scene ends like she's just all excited
[2:11:41] the brother branham say sister you have
[2:11:43] faith just say yeah I got I got so you
[2:11:46] sure you got faith yes I got faith okay
[2:11:49] Acts everybody leader room and they got
[2:11:52] into the room by herself

[2:11:56] yes this is okay look at the ceiling
[2:11:59] there there is a they call it a bracelet
[2:12:03] or string he say that's Fingaz hang in
[2:12:05] there he says now you got faith make the
[2:12:07] string move
[2:12:08] oh she's old no that's spiritualism you
[2:12:13] say I thought you would say that sister
[2:12:15] it's just no that's that's not
[2:12:17] spiritualism
[2:12:18] that's not spiritualism that that's
[2:12:20] faith he said he said magicians use it
[2:12:22] all the time that's not a break glasses
[2:12:23] in all kind of stuff they use it faith
[2:12:25] they use it in the wrong way but it's
[2:12:28] faith that's doing it and if she said
[2:12:31] she said she said well you know if it's
[2:12:33] faith that's doing it can you make it
[2:12:36] move it say yeah I can you say just just
[2:12:39] turn your head just a little bit just no
[2:12:41] we just you know and just you know just
[2:12:44] watch don't watch me watch them and
[2:12:47] whatever he did that like that that that
[2:12:51] string began to move and then stop that
[2:12:57] girl looked at that she said brother
[2:12:59] branham what is this you know she said
[2:13:02] sister that's faith he said she said she
[2:13:04] said no I'm you know I'm not sure about
[2:13:06] this brother man
[2:13:08] say he said I know that's why I actually
[2:13:09] did you have faith because faith will do
[2:13:11] that if you say well prove that to me
[2:13:13] the Bible said Jesus said if you say to
[2:13:17] the mountain be thou removed be thou
[2:13:18] cast into the sea and don't doubt in
[2:13:20] your heart you can have what you say
[2:13:24] that's what Jesus said
[2:13:26] instead I applied that same faith to
[2:13:28] that string and that's why I moved just
[2:13:30] say did the devil move that string no
[2:13:34] did God move that string no who moved
[2:13:39] the string he said I did what see my
[2:13:43] faith move the string my faith deity and
[2:13:48] when you have faith your faith can do
[2:13:51] the exact same thing just say oh my
[2:13:54] so let me just finish this by reading a
[2:13:59] portion of this quote my god
[2:14:02] I mean I'm in faith as a substance and
[2:14:06] I'm at paragraph II - 43 I'm gonna read
[2:14:10] this quote that I'm gonna read a
[2:14:11] scripture and I'm gonna do something for
[2:14:15] y'all this morning this is a faith as a
[2:14:21] substance he says and I said one day
[2:14:23] Jesus passed by a tree and you wanted to
[2:14:26] find some fruit on it and there was no
[2:14:28] fruit on it he put a curse on it and and
[2:14:30] the tree begins to wilt and when they
[2:14:32] passed by at noon the tree was wilted
[2:14:34] down Peter and marked have said how
[2:14:36] quick the tree was wilted he said if you
[2:14:39] would say in your heart for this tree to
[2:14:41] be plucked up in cast into the sea and
[2:14:42] dumped and walked down him it would obey
[2:14:44] you did he say it and I said he said if
[2:14:47] you say to this mountain be removed and
[2:14:49] don't down don't doubt it not in your
[2:14:51] heart by and by it would come to pass
[2:14:53] did he say it sure he did I said I know
[2:14:56] your unbelieving pastor trying to
[2:14:58] justify his unbelief said that was a
[2:15:00] mountain of sin I went to school myself
[2:15:03] and he was kneeling by Mount of Olives
[2:15:06] it was Mount of Olives if you say in
[2:15:08] your heart for it for it to be moved and
[2:15:10] don't doubt it
[2:15:12] I said now how much more faith and he
[2:15:15] said if you're not faithless I
[2:15:16] mustardseed i said now the faith the
[2:15:19] size of mustard seed would move that
[2:15:21] mountain
[2:15:21] how much more smaller faith would you
[2:15:23] have to have just to move the bracelet
[2:15:26] it goes on you see what I mean
[2:15:28] I've often wondered why he said mustard
[2:15:31] seed I might drop this thought mustard
[2:15:33] seed is the smallest among all seed
[2:15:35] that's right but there is is it nothing
[2:15:40] will mix with mustard seed it's all
[2:15:42] mustard you can't mix it with AK with
[2:15:45] kale or nothing and make it grow it's
[2:15:47] all mustard if you've got that much
[2:15:49] faith all faiths not mixed up with
[2:15:52] something else asked what you will it
[2:15:53] will be given to you but it can't be
[2:15:55] wavering it's gotta be genuine mustard
[2:15:58] if you know what I'm speaking of alright
[2:16:00] and I said how much more would it take
[2:16:02] why she said looking here I want to ask
[2:16:05] you something she said did God move that
[2:16:08] or did the devil move that I said
[2:16:10] neither one moved that she said then how
[2:16:12] did how did it move I said I moved it
[2:16:15] she said well you're 15 feet are better
[2:16:17] away from it I said no that's my faith
[2:16:20] that moved it see if you ask anything
[2:16:22] and don't doubt it
[2:16:24] see what I mean this woman you know
[2:16:28] eventually got heal but he had to prove
[2:16:31] to her that this is what faith actually
[2:16:33] does right and and and if we would just
[2:16:36] just approach God with the right or the
[2:16:39] right mental attitude towards enemies of
[2:16:41] divine promises guess what church we
[2:16:43] don't see it come to pass I need you to
[2:16:45] open up your Bibles
[2:16:50] I got two places that I want to read
[2:16:53] from first Luke 17 that's gonna be
[2:16:57] shorter than Matthew Matthew 17 I think
[2:17:01] that I might be let me just make sure
[2:17:03] here yes Luke 17 verse 5 and 6 it says
[2:17:12] this apostle said unto the Lord increase
[2:17:16] our faith and Lord said that they had
[2:17:21] faith as a grain of a mustard seed you
[2:17:24] might say into the sick of mine tree
[2:17:26] be thou plucked up by the root and be
[2:17:31] thou planted in the sea and it should
[2:17:33] obey you let's go back over to Matthew
[2:17:36] 17 and while you got Luke 17 if you want
[2:17:41] to put a little whoa maybe a place
[2:17:43] marker in your Bible but I want to do
[2:17:46] something for y'all today I got some
[2:17:48] mustard seed that I want to give you and
[2:17:51] I want you to take one seed maybe put it
[2:17:54] in Luke and another one put it in
[2:17:56] Matthew and just hold on to it and when
[2:18:00] you when you when you read that
[2:18:01] scripture think about that little seed
[2:18:03] that you gather your Bible because
[2:18:04] that's all God asking you to do is have
[2:18:06] this type of this type of faith and
[2:18:09] you'll see mountains moving Matthew 17
[2:18:17] we started reading it a little earlier I
[2:18:19] got the verse 20 and Jesus said in them
[2:18:22] because again believe for verily I say
[2:18:23] unto you that if you have faith as a
[2:18:25] grain of a mustard seed ye shall stand
[2:18:26] to this mountain remove hence to yonder
[2:18:29] place in the shell remove and nothing
[2:18:30] shall be impossible nothing shall be
[2:18:32] impossible unto you
[2:18:38] howbeit this Karen goeth not out but by
[2:18:41] prayer and fasting are we've Church that
[2:18:44] practices prayer
[2:18:46] are we search that practices Basti well
[2:18:51] we should expect this type of power
[2:18:59] on a prayin I was there in Jericho
[2:19:03] standing that foot of Mount temptation
[2:19:08] looking a man to see how Jesus had
[2:19:11] overcome
[2:19:12] that's just imagining just imagine man
[2:19:14] Jesus was up there on top of this
[2:19:15] mountain devil presenting these trials
[2:19:18] to him but yet he overcomes by saying it
[2:19:20] is written it is written it is written I
[2:19:23] said man heathen using super power God
[2:19:26] helped me just take it you weren't great
[2:19:28] just just to confess what your words say
[2:19:30] and to be satisfied to find peace with
[2:19:32] what the word sins right and and as I
[2:19:35] was sitting there there was a little
[2:19:36] shop and we walked inside a little
[2:19:38] shopping and when the brothers say
[2:19:40] brother Jack you know what it is say no
[2:19:43] what is that he say that's must've seed
[2:19:45] I say that muster see let me get me some
[2:19:48] of that you know as I'm taking it back
[2:19:50] to the church and the number of years
[2:19:52] ago I come to the church I had some
[2:19:55] mustard seed that we got from brother
[2:19:57] Perry green and we were out there in
[2:20:00] Arizona he gave us some that he got from
[2:20:02] Israel and we gave it to the church and
[2:20:04] just kind of poured inside everybody's
[2:20:06] Bibles and I said you know some of y'all
[2:20:08] and man weren't here at that time to get
[2:20:10] that so I got some for you this time
[2:20:12] amen and others you might have a new
[2:20:15] Bible like me right so you don't have
[2:20:18] your old Bible with the muscle see there
[2:20:20] so with your new Bible
[2:20:21] you want some us to see but I want to
[2:20:24] tell you something you don't it's not
[2:20:26] just a muster seat that's just a
[2:20:29] reminder of the faith that you need all
[2:20:33] it needs to be is faith like they must
[2:20:36] have seen and you'll move mountains
[2:20:38] anybody believe that praise the Lord
[2:20:42] let's pray let's pray let's pray father
[2:20:46] God we would move by you were removed by
[2:20:53] Lord your promises and father we just
[2:20:57] acts that as we would Lord just kind of
[2:21:02] turn our attention father to
[2:21:06] just a little thing that you laid in my
[2:21:08] heart as we were there as we would their
[2:21:13] dog as we were there in Israel and
[2:21:19] looking at this mustard seed my my
[2:21:24] thoughts Lord just came upon the
[2:21:27] congregation and God at this moment I
[2:21:31] don't know what people face and I don't
[2:21:32] know every situation I don't know every
[2:21:34] circumstance but I do know that you told
[2:21:37] us in your word that if we had faith the
[2:21:40] size of mustard seed and we could see
[2:21:42] mountains move I also know that your
[2:21:46] prophet told us that the Word of God
[2:21:49] would defeat the devil any place any
[2:21:53] time any condition so God whatever the
[2:21:58] conditions might be I pray that they
[2:22:00] would take a hold of this and as they
[2:22:02] would just be reminded when they see
[2:22:03] just these couple of seeds Lord and
[2:22:07] their Bibles that they would be reminded
[2:22:09] that all they need is faith the size of
[2:22:11] this mustard seed or or like this month
[2:22:14] muster see where it cannot be mixed with
[2:22:17] anything let them have that pure
[2:22:19] unadulterated faith and they'll see
[2:22:22] mountains move Oh God
[2:22:27] we're giving you praise in advance for
[2:22:31] the things that you're gonna do on our
[2:22:34] behalf it's in Jesus name we pray amen
[2:22:39] amen
[2:22:43] there was one other little quote that I
[2:22:45] wanted to read to you all
[2:22:55] praise the Lord this is as as the eagle
[2:22:58] stirreth up her nests let me just read
[2:23:00] this and I'm gonna have you just get
[2:23:04] your Bibles ready and we're gonna put
[2:23:05] some mustard seed in there for you today
[2:23:08] the Prophet says you'd have to come with
[2:23:11] the right kind of an approach to God if
[2:23:13] you come selfish if you come in any
[2:23:18] other approach but the right mental
[2:23:21] attitude towards God or any divine gifts
[2:23:23] you'll never receive any benefits from
[2:23:26] it you've got to come with your
[2:23:29] surrender all to God look at the south
[2:23:35] initial woman when she was told by Jesus
[2:23:37] is not right for me to take the
[2:23:39] children's bread and the feed you dumps
[2:23:42] what would you have said if he that
[2:23:45] called you a dog
[2:23:47] you just said I'll join the next church
[2:23:49] but not her she knew who she was talking
[2:23:52] to she said Lord that's right
[2:23:55] you're so right in that but the dogs is
[2:23:57] willing to eat the scraps of the
[2:23:58] master's table that guy that was in
[2:24:02] that's what he's waiting for you to do
[2:24:04] humble yourself into such a place no
[2:24:06] matter how God sends it to you if you're
[2:24:09] healed instantly if you heal by degrees
[2:24:13] if you're put off like Abraham was
[2:24:17] twenty-five years waiting for the
[2:24:19] promise but instead of getting weak and
[2:24:21] weaker he got stronger up all the time
[2:24:23] giving praise to God just so that you
[2:24:26] know that God promised it and you accept
[2:24:29] it for yourself it's got to come to pass
[2:24:34] amen I believe that so you all line up
[2:24:39] have y'all wanna line up I got some
[2:24:43] mustard seed that I brought back for you
[2:24:45] on all you have just opened your Bible

[2:24:53] reminded when you open up your Bible

[2:24:58] you to do is have the mustard seed faith
