in the back waiting and and while sister Shonda was singing a song sister Dixon just up and worshiping and praising the Lord and it reminded me of something I just began to think about sister Dixon and you know one of the things I want to say a real Christian don't don't wait Sunday morning uh to worship and uh sister Dixon has been one of those uh warriors uh through the years and and I just remember I went way back in my mind I remember just being a young man and we were we were at choir choir Hustle and uh sister Dixon used to be the one that would clean the church she would come and vacuum and and she would uh you know clean the pews and she would clean the bathrooms she was doing all of that and she would come during a time of choir hustle and uh sometimes you have a vacuum cleaner in one hand and a hand lifted it just reminded me of those those old days and how she she didn't wait till Sunday morning anytime she could give God praise that she was giving God praise and and I was just I was just happy [Music] I was happy going down memory lane a man and just just just just just just just just seeing that so we thank God for her we thank God for all the the Saints amen I thank God that the Lord brought us all through this amen this terrible storm that a man that for me it just came out of nowhere uh I was there at the meeting last week and uh y'all be seated just for a moment I won't I won't I won't keep you standing but I was there at the men's meeting last week and um I don't even know what but brother brother Quinton say Hey you know there's a hurricane coming I was there a hurricane where this hurricane come from he says one sitting out there right now on the way I'm like gonna be there by by Monday or something and say what I say oh Lord and so I just began to pray like Lord you know we we don't have time to get prepared for things like this and and uh just just trusting God would just give us a little Grace and and certainly he did um you know here on our side but I know uh some of the other Saints on the west coast of Florida um not just Saints but people have their own lives amen have been turned upside down uh because of a storm like this and certainly we want to continue remember uh so many in prayer um they need they need prayer they need encouragement they need strength and you know that they would just come through but but I am grateful I mean that that was a that was a big storm uh even you know you you um um you know we didn't have a lot on this side but the wind and the rain and even the um tornadoes that kind of uh spun out of it uh you know I was I went outside I just just looking a little bit and man I just saw them clouds just moving so fast you know Crossing I said my God this thing covering up all of us Florida you know and I said it could it could have been another way for us it really could have been another way and and uh so we're grateful we thank God for for keeping us one more time amen I think that [Applause] a song to say um one more time one more time he allowed us to come together one more time amen I want to uh appreciate brother Smiley a man for for last Sunday uh wonderful wonderful word from the Lord amen the necessity uh of light and uh you know just how we just appreciate just how the Lord dealt with him to uh to minister to us and just just very very grateful for that um uh the uh you heard the announcement that we had a little conflict there so there is a youth service on next Sunday it won't be I'm sorry next Friday not a tape and now the tape you can listen to that through the day then gotta wait till the night but through the day and what we try to do is you know just once a month amen we try to find a tape that we can all listen to together and uh you just never know maybe the holy spirit will pick it up and uh preach it right back to us and we're all being the same channel and and the guide is a really really good sermon amen a really good sermon if you've never heard it before I encourage you to listen to it and all you're listening to amen when you're listening to a tape you're just listening to a sermon that brother Branham happened to preach praise the Lord now you know sometimes some folk don't have problems listening to a sermon that other preachers preach hello somebody I can call out names right now and if I call that if I call that uh somebody sent me a a a a a a a little link to TD Jake's sermon amen they said listen to this you'll be blessed now and if I say hey everybody listen to this TD Jake sermons okay yeah I'm listening to that is that right so when I say let's listen to the prophet amen we shouldn't have no problem with that it's just listening to the word amen Church all right so don't let the devil steal your blessing all right but sometimes you know we have to just kind of balance these things and and so what I try to do is just you know just once a month let's encourage the church let's listen to let's listen to the word together listen to what God's Prophet had to say to us all right church amen amen I'm a preacher I promise you I'm a preach but I wanted to just uh encourage Us in that and you know you can listen to that through the day but we are going to have a youth service on next uh uh Friday night and then Saturday night be coming back for a service with brother Jason Watkins um you know brother Jason is one of those Brothers uh he um he has some history with this message his parents um grew up kind of in the Tabernacle his mom had a dream about uh looking for the bride find the bride wanting to find the bride and um and um you know and when some kind of way they got kicked out of the church that they were in and when they got kicked out they walked outside and I think across the street was another young couple coming out of church that just got married so she saw the bride and uh so then you know she she kind of kept that in her in her spirit and and they found their way to brother Branham you know to the Tabernacle and when they got there uh she told Brother Branham a dream and brother Branham interpreted for and once she got interpreted she was settled you know that was it she knew she had found the bride oh hallelujah we're not looking for the church or a church we're looking for the bride amen even brother Brandon I read a quote this morning brother random say don't they say the Holy Spirit told them don't even call them Church say the churches are called out people they call them lodges it's not a church call them lodges the Holy Spirit told them to say that amen and I looked up the definition of Lodge and they said it's just a organized Gathering of people like the Freemasons that's in the dictionary like the Freemasons and Freemasons nothing but uh Witchcraft and and and and and and and and a demonic um stuff idolatry so brother I mean so the Holy Spirit tied the denomination churches Hallelujah to idolatry all right and if you go to a church and they pray in the name of the father in the name of the son in the name of the Holy Ghost idolatry all right because ain't no power in the name of the father ain't no power in the name of the son ain't no power in the name of the spirit you need to know his name and you need to call him by his name amen if I just said a father so many brothers could respond to that I need to know who am I talking to called a man by his name all right amen So you you're watching this idolatry going on out there in these churches and and it's all underneath the name of Christianity but it's idolatry Oh I Feel Jesus amen so we I tell you we want to um just uh just encourage the church and everywhere we can let's let's all just unite together throughout the day but we'll be here Friday night for the Youth service I know you're going to be blessed when you come Saturday night we're coming back brother Jason and then uh Sunday morning he'll be here also Sunday night just another service has been added not for us but for Boynton Beach amen uh uh brother uh Jason's going to be going down to brother uh jeans and preaching on Sunday evening I think the service starts at six o'clock and um I think I I think it's time for things like this to start happening again covet has kept us kind of at Bay but it's time to pick it back up and get back in Fellowship again so uh we're looking forward to that as well so amen keep that all in mind all right musicians thank y'all so much I I um I Heard a little beat back there I said oh brother Tanashi God bless you hey man good day good to have you all and I also wanted to give special greetings to brother Gabriel amen being here with us a man uh good to have you with us brother God bless you God bless you uh understand that they are streaming our service and he's interpreting to the Saints back home um so you know my my I would thank God it's a brother Gabriel that told me uh he'd come visit us uh last year I think it was last year that he was here and it came through and uh he took a picture outside and he says um they say brother uh is something about being here in this place there's something about this and they say he said I need to take a picture in front of this address here because you know the address is 377. all right you don't have addresses like that too much but three seven seven there's something like something about this you know so a real encouragement to my spirit uh you know there sometimes I tell you what I get a little discouraged you know and I'm like Lord I'm waiting I'm waiting on God what else we need to do Lord what else we need to do and uh but uh but I tell you what what we need to do I I got the answer I got the answer I got the answer what we need to do is is wait don't get in a hurry just just wait just wait that's all God wants us to do and uh he'll manifest in his own due time you know so so why I say while I'm waiting I'm gonna be faithful we're gonna serve God and we're gonna do everything we can we're going to treat it like it's our own amen as long as we got somebody to come and open up these doors we'll become right here to worship amen so uh uh brother Jason it's just kind of the first of some that will be passing through but I've been getting contact from a lot of different people brother Andrew Glover want to come in January uh brother Dale Smith wanna come brother Daryl Ward want to come uh and I'm Gonna Make Room a man for these brothers to come like y'all just come on to the school where we at we don't have a problem coming to the school so y'all come on too amen amen join us in this chapter all right glory to God so so I just said to myself we just gonna invite you know I was talking to brother Gene the other day said brother I noticed y'all gonna move to another spot I said well we're at the same school brother say just in a different room because they can see the difference in the background it looks much better to me uh but uh but he said brother just send me the address because I might just want to pop in sometime you're welcome anytime amen we gonna be right here serving the lord a glory to God so uh we we just thank the Lord for all things I am going to read um two scriptures my my thoughts are still uh back with Esther when I got there to the the meeting um brother Paul picked up a thought on eston just just preaching like wow this beautiful disconnection there and um I'll I'll use a little bit about her today but um we also want to uh just kind of share some other things amen here if the if the Lord would allow us a man I I'm going back into my archive and I'm pulling something out um that was a blessing to me years ago but it seemed like in this season uh it's speaking a little bit more and man so we we want to we want to just try to uh be obedient to the spirit of God um um I I also want to say um I was at before I I came I was just out and I have to make my pit stop before I come to the pulpit you know and uh I saw brother Chris and he was telling me a little something that happened there this morning and um at the house and brother Chris I'm happy to see you and sister Gabby pressed through a man uh that trial uh sometime the enemy would just kind of throw things in our path to try to disrupt us last week we had a plan to um um we knew that we wouldn't have all our vehicles here to help you know break down so we had a plan brother brother uh Quentin that left his truck in the parking lot like okay y'all just pick up the truck on Sunday and uh and then y'all can take all the stuff back to the storage and and my brother Troy drove by the parking lot on Sunday morning and the truck wasn't there and uh so like okay well we'll uh figure out what we're gonna do and we had to sort through it and brother Troy did the research and found out the truck was towed and um you know I'm like you know here's what you have to do you have to expect the devil to fight and uh you know he's got some kind of way he's gonna do something but uh but I I thank God a man that uh we was able to get the truck back and no no no no no issues but you know that's fine that's fine if that's uh like I like to say it like this if that's your best punch if that's all you got that's all you got sometimes you need to tell the devil that's all you got they stand like Muhammad Ali come on somebody Muhammad Ali boy he'll he'll get them all I mean they didn't work that everything through everything they had them Muhammad look look him in the eye that's all you got cause I'm getting ready to go to town on you amen but but you know we we we we we we realize that the enemy is gonna fight but press through amen whatever it is that he throws in your your direction keep pressing press Little Lily press amen y'all stand with me and let us read two passages of scripture Romans 8. verse um 18 and 19 so this is even a scripture for this morning amen uh for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed and us so the glory is not uh just the glory that'll be found in our savior and the glory is not just the glory that will be found uh in God's prophet but according to the scripture the glory is supposed to be revealed in US for the earnest expectation of the creature wadeth for the manifestation of the sons of God all right let's uh go back over here to Esther and I'm in chapter four and we are reading here just start at verse 10 if we can let's start there uh and it says again that's to speak unto a talk and gave him commandment unto Mordecai all the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces do know that whatsoever that whosoever whether man or woman shall come unto the king into the inner Court who is not called there is one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live but I have not been called to come in unto the king these 30 days and they told to Mordecai Esther's words then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther think not with thyself that thou shall Escape in the King's house more than all the Jews for if thou all together hold is thy peace at this time then shall their uh enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou in that father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether Thou Art come to the kingdom for such a time as this uh that has to be them return Mordecai's answer go gather together all the Jews that are present in shushan and fast she for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day I also and my maidens will Fast likewise and so will I go in to the King which is not according to the law and she put these words a man there for Uncle Mordecai to see and if I perish Hallelujah I perish good God Almighty so Mordecai went his way and then according to all that Esther had commanded him amen let's pray father we thank you uh for your word and uh that has been read but may the Holy Spirit now take father what has been read and uh Lord just make it come alive for us at this time that we would not just see a Bible story but we'll see Lord ourselves Amen in the scripture and we'll see your great plan for us I pray God that you would open our understanding spiritual understanding open it father that we would uh we would rise to a higher level in you God on today May the light of the Gospel shine into our circumstances and situations and may it bring change just as it did in the beginning when the spiritual Earth was without form and it was void and darkness upon the face of the deep deep it was light that brought change so may light uh bring change again today in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated um I'm taking the title uh for such a time as this a man we want to just uh use that and um there is um so much plaguing us amen uh even in the day in which we live I was just you know just kind of thinking to myself um one of the big things that our children are growing up under is a a world that is absolutely confused amen uh who would have ever thought that uh people would be trying to redefine uh what a boy is and what a girl is right I mean that that to me is one of the most basic uh things of life it's very obvious for us to know what a boy is and what a girl is but they're they're teaching our children that they can be whatever they want to be uh when they want to be in so this morning if you feel like a girl then you can be a girl amen if you feel like a boy then you can be a boy uh none of this stuff uh is is a is in alignment with the word of God Amen completely outside of the word of God right when God made man he he made him he made them male and female that's when God made them but God took the female Spirit out of a man and he made a woman that's what God orchestrated and uh and here we are living in in some of the most difficult times I I I you know I just begin to as I meditate this I think about the teachers and man what about our teachers that that have to go to school and here comes uh John amen and you know that boy is John but today he feels like Janetta and and he wants to be called Jeanetta and the teacher has to sit there and be uh she has to call him by this this name that he want to be called but that's not what's on your birth certificate son John is your name on the birth certificate praise the Lord but you know you can imagine that and even some of the co-workers that we have I mean the people that are working in the workforce and and some of your co-workers that are going through some of these things and like you know one day they this and the next day they that I mean it's just all kind of things that's going on and I know sometimes I remember one of the brothers um uh from Africa he come and he had he got a job here and uh he was working and and and and somebody went through a change over the weekend and uh and he knew them as whatever their name was and they come in underneath this change uh that have been changed over the weekend and now they don't want to recall that no more but he kept calling them by their original name and uh Danny got in trouble with ar HR said you got to call him by that and I said no this is who they are and that's what I'm calling by by his original name and I said well no they don't want to be called at no more I'm sorry I'm gonna call about original he end up losing his job because he wouldn't call him by another name what about our saints that are working in human resources my God all kind of stuff you and all you want to do is just get a job and go to work but we we uh uh uh uh surrounded by sin everywhere we turn is sin hallelujah amen but but yet and still we are Christians in the midst of Satan's Eden and and and being Christians we have a we have a conviction Upon Our Lives that amen we got to do things in accordance to the word of God hallelujah amen amen let me just kind of uh slip into something else here real quick but uh here just a a little little statement that's coming from this message adoption or placing um and I'm gonna I think quote from this sermon maybe three different times uh but here you know this first one brother Brandon makes this statement says but the purpose of this and I want to make sure that we uh we we understand what's your purpose for coming to church well what's your purpose for being here what's your purpose for serving the lord right I mean you you got you got a greater purpose than just filling up chairs this morning come on somebody amen you got a greater like like brother um Chris Kathy said the other day think about you know all the other churches that gather around us why why would God bring you to the message why would they allow your family to get connected to this message God has a greater purpose than what we realize Hallelujah it said but the purpose of this he says this is seeing your position in Christ glory to God Amen the purpose of this is you seeing your position in Christ oh Hallelujah let me just pause just for a second I'm I'm I'm gonna get all this while I was here in prayer this morning the Lord just kind of brought something to my attention amen and um you know when we come to church uh the word is what changes us the word is what transforms us the word is what makes a difference inside of our life it's got to be the word not the singing amen it's got to be the word that makes the difference in your life it's the word that gives you overcoming power it's the word that gives you strength over the enemy it's the word that does these things right so so you know the Lord just kind of saying oftentimes we come to church and amen we will we will hear a word about this so about that and sometimes we say uh second Pastor get them Pastor get them talk about that Pastor yeah because you're right where I need you to be Pastor hey Lord let let the word get my wife let the word get my husband let the word get my children and I was just thinking about to see see we won't change to happen from the outside come on somebody that's what the Lord just kind of told me this morning we want change to happen from the outside and what I mean by that is that you want to see everybody else change but you remain the same but change does not happen like that amen change happens from the inside so rather than worried about everybody else come on get that moat I mean get the Beam not your own eye and stop worrying about the molding somebody else's eye let the word change you and if you let it change you it'll change the situation come on somebody change happens from the inside we all think we're right we all think we're right but there's no no the reason you're going through what you're going through because you're wrong amen so God God said let the change happen from the inside stop worrying about your neighbor worry about you hear the word for you today the purpose of this is seeing your position in Christ seeing that it's not something that you just stumbled into oh Hallelujah this message is not something that I stumbled into hey I was predestinated to come to this amen look he says he says not just something you stumbled into a something that might uh you married it somewhere but it's what God did for you himself not that you were so good that you went to church one night that some poor brother LED you up to the Altar and it wasn't that it was God before the foundation of the world predestinated you to eternal life you need to think about your journey now how did you get here God predestinated you to eternal life when you get there that day no wonder the 24 Elders laid off their crowns everybody laid down the crown everyone fell on their knees they didn't have one thing they could say no preacher no Elder no nothing all praise to the lamb God will gather in him all things at that day oh if we'd ever know and recognize who that was who they crucified so so he just kind of letting us uh see just in this little thought here that it's not by mistake that you hear it's not by accident you stumbling into this message that's not what happened God Amen by predestination allows you to come in contact with light that's why brother Smiley was trying to tell you and he and he's saying say had he not experienced light he would not be the man he is today had we not experienced light we would not be the people that we are today thank God that his son Delights Amen in our in in in in our souls I want to just pick up another little thought here Christ is the mystery of God revealed oh Hallelujah to the Lamb of God amen just a few thoughts the prophet just kind of shared with us and I want to share them with you he says this the new birth is Christ amen it's the revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery now that's a powerful statement God has revealed to you this great mystery you know there's many people walk around on the Earth today without a revelation they have no understanding been around church for years but still don't have a revelation of what this is all about and I'm gonna tell you something I I'm not just going to church for uh a hiccup Messiah and I'm not just going to church to hear good choir amen I'm not going I want to hear the word of God something that'll Transform Me something that has changed me from the inside right I mean I really I want to draw closer to God Amen that's my purpose of going to church the new birth is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth now that now now what are you gonna do when you get all that group together where the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same anxious the same things that he did making the word manifest I love this statement oh if the church only knew its position and I like this this is the promised part of it this is amen this is what I feel like we're coming to right now he says it will one day Glory that tells me you might struggle with certain things right now but there's a promise looming over your life you will understand one day the revelation will unfold to you one day but just walk in a little light that you do have amen oh is the church newest position it will one day look at this then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is so my my purpose my purpose is to try to help the people realize who they are in Christ now you know um oftentimes we don't realize it and and I didn't bring the quote but I'll just tell you what the prophet said he said we let little things pull this out of us uh he says you you let it no no I'm not talking about the devil brought a trial on my way and and and and and and I I wasn't expecting this and the devil did this that no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no you you mature enough in Christ now that's right you've been in this for 20 something years now 30 years you've been in this 10 years you've been in this you were maturing up in Christ now where you are allowing certain things to keep happening over and over and I'm gonna tell you something you are allowing it to happen y'all ain't got me yet you are allowing yourself to get into that argument come on Church practical teaching again you are allowing yourself to go through them struggles on the job like that you allowing your boss to do certain things to you come on Church you are allowing that you're not even taking a stand for nothing you have not even changed your strategy or how you're gonna fight in the battle you have not made any adjustments at all you looking for other people to change but change starts on the inside you without you allow the devil to take these things from you but you know what you know we we're not we're not going we're not gonna lower ourselves to where the devil is amen we gonna raise this thing up and I want I want to I want to just get this to church you got a purpose for being here you you got I got God God had a much greater plan in his mind than you just sitting in a chair just to say I go to this church God God got a greater plan than that in mind why would he bring you to the truth why are we allow your ears to hear it why would they allow your eyes to see these things why would God do that all the other people on the Earth that are just just just just running right by truth standing right next to the truth and won't give no ear to it why would God allow you to see it it's a big word it's called predestination and and let me tell you another thing God didn't just bring you here just so you can just hear it God brought you here so you could be it oh yeah amen amen God wants you to be it not just hear it but you're gonna be it let's look at a scripture Psalms 82. brother Solomon caught this one a few weeks ago and he was make mention of it and I and when he called me about it I said you you talk about you talk about this you say yeah that's exactly what I'm talking about it's just things that's written in the Bible that we just been reading and it's just going right over the top of us i i before before I even get to the scripture before I get to the scripture before I before I before I pull it up on the screen you know where you know where I'm worshiping that this morning and know who I'm worshiping with I'm in the congregation of Gods I am sitting in the congregation of Gods amen amen my god oh glory and you're gonna allow I mean as a God I mean God ain't never surprised by nothing God ain't never caught off guard by nothing I mean when situation rise he just act who he is right it just bring out certain attributes in him and that's the same way it should be for us as Believers when certain things come it should just bring out certain attributes this happens speak to it yes sir yes sir and you have the authority because of the Holy Ghost living inside of you you have the authority to use God's word your children acting up speak to it no not fussing fight with them why you still fussing you don't tried that strategy it has not worked stop fussing and fighting and just speak and move forward when God said let there be light hey that's the Bible right there amen I don't care if it took a billion years before light came the Bible declares there was light speak to your situation speak to your circumstance speak to it out of your own mouth speak to it [Applause] oh I'm dwelling in the midst of Gods Not A group of defeated people Gods people who have control amen people Rule and ring you know as an overcomer as an overcomer in the Legacy in church age you are granted to sit in the throne you are a ruler you a Rainer you're a God you're in control praise God you have the greater one living on the inside of you you will not be defeated I don't care what you going through praise God the devil is still a liar it is not based on how you feel it's based on what God has already said hey I'm a God and I'ma take care of this situation [Applause] he's God Church you know I didn't think about this till now but one time in Brother random's house man the devil just started running rough shots all these people coming in and out and you know as they were coming in and out you know different ones coming for prayer whatever uh sister Brandon the kids just screaming and yelling and she just I mean I gotta get then I got to do this I gotta take care of these kids I gotta I just can't I can't handle all this and all these people keep knocking on the door won't pray I just can't handle it so the Branham just got just a little frustrated and then she got frustrated brother Branham noticed it now I know I want you to notice some things about the prophet now he's praying for the other ones coming through his house but he never laid hands on his wife he never laid hands on his wife even though he saw the frustration he never went and cast The Devil out his children y'all gonna work with me he I mean he saw the kids doing what they were doing let me tell you something parents let your kids be kids you gotta beat him for everything let your kids be kids hello somebody right but brother random then didn't go beat the kids and say y'all need to straighten up y'all need to uh you're driving your mama crazy he didn't go yelling and screaming like that you know what I know the prophet did he went and grabbed the apron no prayer over this wife no prayer where the kids just went and grabbed an apron he put an apron on saw some dirty dishes praise God saw some dirty dishes in the sink and he walked over to the dirty dishes with his apron a prophet walk to the dirty dishes and say let me get some Dawn out amen and filled up the sink glory to God began to wash the dishes amen maybe singing a little song in his heart his wife noticed his actions she began to calm down and amenity begin to talk about buying a dress Change Your Atmosphere by watching dishes and the prophet said when his wife was upset like that by him washing the dishes he says I became [Applause] God we'll wash dishes God will fold clothes God [Music] [Applause] [Music] will cook for his wife if he know how to cook if he knows how to cook God will do these things [Music] if you can't cook like me I can't cook I don't know how to cook but I take my wife out to eat and and I a long time ago I made a I made a commitment I just watched my pastor I made a commitment a long time ago my wife cooked all these other days during the week she ain't gonna cook on Sunday I'm gonna have some money together to take her out somewhere amen I appreciate it God will do those things God recognizes this and God said I got to change the situation yeah so God puts himself an apron on who [Applause] now I hope you understand what I'm saying I'm not saying bro in one way I am saying brother Brandon was a God just like I'm saying you are a god I ain't leaving it all on brother Brandon you are a god and you can change situations with your actions [Applause] stop trying to change stop trying to have God change everybody let change start on you with you on the inside of you is that all right [Applause] if this one would do that I'll do this if this or no no no no no no no no no no no no [Music] no Lord let it start in me I'm gonna tell you something about a god before I read the scripture a God got to be willing to die [Applause] amen yes Lord yeah oh God got to be willing to take up his cross and follow I'm talking about the one that's really in control and one that understands their role amen he's got to be willing to die she's got to be willing to die I ain't just making it up it's in the word David actually wrote about it all right the purpose is you know your position look at what David said here in Psalms 82. standeth in the congregation of the mighty hello not the weaklings not the defeated ones but the mighty and I'm standing in the congregation of the mighty he judges among the Gods I'm talking about you he judges among the gods skip down here to verse 6. I have said this God now I have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high but look at this one but ye shall die like men and fall like one of the princes so yes one thing to recognize your position as as a God because he's living on the inside of you right but but I understand that as a God you're gonna have to do some things that's going to cause you to die to yourself die to your flesh that are your emotions that are your feelings die to your thoughts and let me tell you something except the corner wheat go on the ground and bye you know what happens a one that refuses to die they abide alone hello somebody if you refuse to die you will abide alone but once you take your corner wheat into the Earth and you die the process is not death come on the process is not just being buried y'all ain't gonna let me preach the process don't stop it you just being bare bear because once the seed goes in the ground and dies the Bible says it'll bring forth much fruit but before you can start producing fruit you got to go through the process of growth come on Church you got to be willing to go through the process of growth and at the end of that process of growth you'll see just so much fruit coming out of your life but it started with a death Life Starts with the death all right all right let me keep on reading here I'm a uh I gotta skip some of these things I I won't I won't read um I won't read this out let me just quote these these three things to you uh out of Crisis and Mr God revealed uh brother random you know told us there that God had a threefold purpose and uh and this threefold purpose was uh first thing that God wanted to do let's first reveal himself to his people and I want you to know who I am uh I don't want to be so mysterious to you that that you don't know who I am I want to make myself real to you that was the very first thing God wanted to just reveal himself to his people right uh the second thing amen that God wants is to have the preeminence uh in his body of Believers and what that means is that God want to be able to lead you God want to be able to guide you God want to be able to kind of talk to you and have you uh just following his instructions and I'm it makes it much easier when we just follow what the Lord tells us to do amen not fight against his will and what what is but but let them have the preeminence let him live through you his word don't fight don't fight him don't fight him with that amen just just Lord if this what your word said and I just want I want to yield to that God wants to have that type of PM another thing is I'm I'm I'ma just put it like this um God is a gentleman and um God won't won't force himself on you God want to see you you know it's just like in a husband and wife relationship it's got to be love going in both directions praise the Lord I mean people want and God want to feel love coming in in his Direction and the way that you show God that you love him that no matter what trial you're going through that you still serving Faithfully in the midst of it that's how you show God that you love him all right so so God wants to have the preeminence Amen in you and the third thing that God wanted to do was restore the kingdom to his right position that failed by sin uh by the first Adam God wants to restore us back to Eden conditions again this is why as a God you can speak out of your mouth we are going back to that condition that's what Jesus going to the Cross was all about to take us back to that place you understand amen so now just just follow me here amen uh these three things first God wanted us to reveal himself to his people secondly have preeminence in his Believers third restore it back to the position that it fell uh When sin entered into the world he want to restore us back to that condition this is where we're headed back to all right now let me um just kind of oh my I'm going towards the end of my my notes there is probably going to be on the second page I want to just bring in a quote from things that are to be things that are to be I want you to hear what the prophet says about you Amen in this things that are to be all right now the only way you can be a son or a daughter of God because you have to have eternal life he says there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life look at this amen it says only one form eternal life and that was God now now this is important you cannot die and go to hell and live eternally the church is missing this mixing mixing it up a little bit there's only one form of eternal life and that's the life that you receive from Christ you can't reject Christ and get eternal life it don't happen like that at some point in time it's going to come to an end that life in hell will come to an end right so so there's only one form eternal life and that's what you receive from Christ look at this he says there there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always to be a Son of God you had to be in him always I like this statement the gene of your life I wish I could just stop there and preach the gene of your life your spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule the gene of your life oh I could just walk y'all through some some you know each one of y'all got a story and I could just walk you through your story how you come in contact amen with real life how light was expressed to you and when light shined upon the gene of your life praise God you couldn't go anywhere else some of y'all don't try to go other places amen you done tried it amen but something it's something that that just caused you to be magnetized right back to sometimes you don't even agree with everything that's being said from this Pulpit but you can't go nowhere else why do you think you're having a problem why you think the other one that go to the to that church don't have no problem why you got to have a problem I'm talking real good now sometimes you want to look like them sometimes you want to act like them sometimes you want to be like them but deep down inside you know you're not like them why am I so connected to this there's a gene inside of you a gene that came from God and everybody ain't got that team oh my if that let me just make it let me make it a little bit more simpler um and families there are certain genes that run yeah those are certain genes amen and everybody don't get every Gene hello you know like like it's sometimes a gene that a young man start losing his head a certain age it's a gene that came out of that family maybe in the way that the young lady might be built her shape it's a gene and then one sister might not get the gene y'all ain't gonna talk to me but it's a gene that flows through some got it some don't I'm so glad that I got the gene from God and I know some got it and summed out but I doubt it that's why I'm magnetized to this truth it's like a magnet I'm just connecting you get a real serious magnet it's hard to pull them apart it take I mean you got to really work to pull that thing apart stop working on this one you ain't gonna pull this one apart all right um the dream of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule and you are nothing I I I'm I'm talking to you you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a son of God look at this now you're expressed after his word come in you and what the word come in to do to light up this age the necessity of light The Light Came to you so you can light up the age not be afraid in this age not be a run of a cover in this age but God got you specifically a place where he got you he put you on that job he put you in that school he put you in the HR department he put you wherever he wanted to put you so you can light up the Saints because some people are never dark the doors of a church but the only church they're gonna see is the church that's inside of you why are you so different well actually I'm not I'm normal you different I'm a Christian I follow the word of God you believe in God you believe a Creator well I I you know there's a creator that created you for a purpose and when you're standing there and just kind of sharing your testimony they realize and see God had to use you to light up the age you you you you you are the city upon a hill which could not be hid you're the one that they look into amen and don't be afraid to be different [Music] yeah oh his word is coming you to light up this age you are expressing God's life in you because you are son or daughter of God therefore says you get what I mean see you are now mate you're getting it says you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation and remember that your your duty not you're not coming to church just to say I went to church gave my tithes gave my offering Lord I did something good no no no no no no no it's so much more than that so much more I mean your duty after you leave here your duty is to go and express God to your sphere of influence sir the people that follow on social media Express God people on your job Express God the people in your school Express God amen even as a student you have to express God right so it's because your son and daughter God says uh uh you send the church tonight because your duties Express God to his nation and his people and this neighborhood where you associate wherever you are God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you've ever if you've got eternal life then it was always it always was eternal life and God before there was a foundation World knew that you would be here I like this and the word or the washing of the water of the word fell upon you you was expressed in a being now you have fellowship with your father God just as you as you have with your Earthly father see your citizens of the king not citizens but your children Sons and Daughters of the Living God if it be that the eternal life dwells in you now then if it was Jesus was the fullness of God manifested he was the fullness of the godhead bodily therefore for when he came to Earth and was manifesting flesh you were here in him then because he was the word in the beginning was the word glory to God Amen um it says uh the word was with God the Word was God the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and I don't have this quote but I'm just tell you this brother Braham say the word that was made flesh and Jesus has now been made flesh in US that same word is now made flesh in us right it says in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelled Among Us the word was made flesh therefore you walk with him you were in him when he was on when he was on Earth you suffered with him you died with him you was buried with him and now you're risen with him and manifested attributes of God setting in Heavenly places already raised I like that statement right there you're not waiting to get up you already up amen amen you're not waiting to get the victory already fighting from a place of Victory amen already raised resurrected to New Life and setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus oh that means so much nowadays church that means so much to us to see ourselves positionally placed in Jesus Christ now this is uh to me very very important last week you know um I was um while we were there at the meeting brother Paul just began to kind of go back to Esther and just it blessed me and just just a little thought now let's let's just walk through a story just a little bit amen just for a few minutes Esther uh lost her parents at a very young age and had to be raised by her uncle Mordecai and uh you know Esther's in his household and and I was just reading something I think earlier where it said that this whole story of Estes is is something that happened really over a 12 year period the whole story I want you to think about that I mean just look back over the last 12 years of your life for the last 10 years of life and think about the various things that have happened Right Now esther going through I lost my mama I lost my daddy now I'm an orphan and now I I I'm being raised by my uncle and and maybe when she looking at her uncle man this guy's a very strict guy you know and like I really just it's the only household I can be raised in ain't no other relatives that I could go to why Uncle Mordecai why Uncle Mordecai but seeing that that's the way we question God sometimes why am I a part of this and why that God got purpose God had a purpose for why Esther was raised in Mordecai's house oh Hallelujah Esther couldn't understand the purpose asked to concede the things that God saw but God specifically placed her under a house that had very restrictive rules sometimes our children may get a little upset while you would have let me do this and maybe this and maybe that mamas and daddies you ain't got to apologize for how you raised them especially when you raise them in the ways of God now if you raise them in the ways of the devil that's a different thing but if you raise them the best you could in the ways of God don't you apologize amen the reason being you know why if you were to let down the bars at that stage in their life they would have been much worse than they are right now they would even much worse than where they are right now I had to hold up a standard to keep that thing away from you I knew what you were fighting see when you get away from the standard look at what happens to your life but they got to come to their own Revelation someday but Paris you ain't got to apologize for that no I did the best I could I tried to raise you the right way I tried to do things the right way now listen if you did some things wrong you go back and apologize for what's wrong I'm gonna just say that to someone's too big to apologize way too big you got too much pride that's too much pride when you came apart and especially if you can't say sorry to young children amen amen where you expect that where you expect children to see Christ at at home demonstrated by the parents all right so truth in it high that they hear you calling somebody on the phone brother I'm sorry sister I'm sorry you know I ain't really mean that them kids hear you say that and they sitting right there next to him you can't say sorry to them well you you you you no you you were you're a human being made in God's image and you deserve my apology boy that thing get quiet Lord but but here here is is in his house of Mordecai Mordecai very very strict uncle does things by the word very unique guy and we we realize this because Mordecai you know is the only one in this in this area that will not bow down the Haman this guy got a a different temperament this guy built from I mean he's built differently made differently he act differently yeah but this is this is Esther's uncle well God allows for a little situation to rise up in the Kingdom with vastly don't want to come and do her duties as as the wife amen she'll want to come do it and and say well you know put her away and get us another queen and as they go looking through the land and find themselves a a fair virgin they find Esther she takes some advice from from uh from an uncle said now don't tell them who you are don't tell them you're a Jew don't say nothing about that just gotta go right on through like like if they don't act don't tell so Esther makes it through and she becomes a queen Hallelujah and you can imagine something that happened over a 12 year period she's a young lady when this is going on here she is she's made the queen and I want you to just kind of kind of get this because here's the thought that brother brother Paul brought and I just appreciate it being Queen was not the ultimate place that God had for Esther being Queen was not where God wanted to stop no that was a place a man to allow you to do what I need you to do amen you know as Queen Hallelujah as Queen she was the only one it was only really two people in the Kingdom that were higher than Haman Haman was actually going to change some things for the Jews but because there was a woman sitting there on the throne amen glory to God a woman that recognized her position At first she didn't she didn't catch it at first that's why she was going back and forth with her Uncle glory to God she's like now now look look look look uh you know if I go and the King does not hold out that golden scepter to me I could die Hallelujah say and I don't want to die I just got here to this job I I just got this job I don't want to lose this job I mean I I just walked out of my career and I don't want to lose my career oh Hallelujah the reason you got that job and the reason you got the position that you had is because you can stand in a certain place for such a time as this you can display Christ to the world for such a time as this you can light up this age for such a time as this the job is not just to provide for your needs now that your service able to give you another job what's the guy that refused to make a cake for a uh a bake a cake for a couple same-sex couple and pretty much they come against them and pretty much you know try to take his business now look so you want to stop me from working as uh jacks cake maker you want me to shut that business down okay no problem I'm just going to open up as JD's cake maker but Jack's taking can't make it on exist no more and you can't bring that against me that was it that was Jax that did that but this is JB's now you come over here to JD's and you asked me to do that I'ma say nah I'm not doing that you're gonna take me to court and I'm gonna shut down JD's and then I'm gonna open up J E D's look you got oh Hallelujah if I get that same church don't give up just because they be throwing different things at you God will provide some kind of way but God put you here for such a time as this you in that school for such a time as this you're in the HR department for such a time as this praise the Lord amen you're on that job for such a time as this you are living in the neighborhood you live in for such a time as this them neighbors that God put next door to you for such a time as this he told Esther that's just like now you know if I don't get the scepter you know I'll die and I just pretty much I just got this job at 30 days 30 days I've been hearing he ain't called for me and I don't want to lose I don't want to lose my job they look he has to don't think because you're in the palace don't don't think because you're in the palace that thing's gonna be different for you and here's the other thing that I think Esther came to realize that by being a Jew with haman's order she was gonna die just because she was Jew she would have died as a Jew so she said you know what if I die let me die but I'm gonna go in to see the king I'mma take my chance with the King she walked in there and and and after the fasting and the praying and everything and and here's the thing God had to put her in this place as a queen because she's the only one that can overturn what Haman is doing let me tell you something let me tell you something God always got his people a little higher then everything the devil trying to do can I can I ask you something are you living a little bit higher are you walking a little bit higher than what your trials are trying to bring you down to don't let your trials don't let your boss don't let your husband don't let your wife don't let your children keep bringing you down God God trying to elevate you see your spiritual position you are a god amen you got control and you don't want to know how to control cook wash dishes fold the clothes that's practical ain't it amen pick up behind the children stop fussing all the time God I'm talking to gods you can't ain't no sense in you leaving church leaving church and going home and having an argument how many years you've been doing that how many years you've been doing it I mean in church ain't man and up something at home today I'm just like I don't know you know how you get yeah yeah I mean you're yelling and screaming and and Pastor having a call at a certain time or some other Saint can call oh God bless you just finished yelling and screaming and everything you know how the prophet went to that house marrying them two couples one couple you eat see him just sitting there and they barely can get along and living in a in a box car barely can get along but the other one living up on the top of the hill it's got a beautiful house nice cars all kind of stuff I mean people can be so blessed but so miserable walk up Danny just sneak up on them they just fussing and fighting by dancing with a you shouldn't have been dancing with him you should have been you should and brother Brandon just kind of sat there and heard him out for a little bit then he knocked on the door oh God bless you brother Branham how you doing brother Brandon so good to have you all right we were just talking about you brother random weren't we dear he heard everything they said can I tell y'all something let's stop being actors and let's be Christians [Applause] Esther had to come to a reality that it wasn't just because of her beauty that she got promoted to this position actually Esther had a higher position just being Queen of the land Esther position now now here's a here's a thing that I want to I want to say about this book of Esther here just in a little note in the front of my Bible to say the name of God does not not once secure occur uh but in no other book of the Bible is its Providence more conspicuous so his the name God does not even show up in the Book of Esther but his actions show us God all through his actions remember I said you know um uh as a as a God you have to be willing to die David told us that do you realize Esther as a god oh y'all Esther as a god was willing to die amen if I perish let me perish amen I'm willing to put my life on the line so Esther Esther had a higher role than just being Queen Esther Rolle in God's mind savior [Applause] in your family savior Amen in your household savior yeah except the corner wheat go in the ground and die it'll live alone but when that corner wheat is ready to die be buried and now that's when the process of life begins to start now you'll see fruit come but you got to be willing to be like a god bye our Lord and savior went to a cross and died and through his death look at all the fruit and it's been fruit from years and years and years all right let me um it's you know it's it's so important that we recognize our position Who We Are in Christ it's so important uh let me just read a couple more quotes here for you Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory here out of the message adoption or placing brother Brandon makes this statement tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside of this time now oh my God it's at the top of the uh that the the top quote the second uh selection there so it's outside of time now says uh when were there ever time in the history this that manifests the time to deliver all nature right nature itself is groaning if you don't see that just with the storm that just came out of nowhere I mean out of nowhere typically you know we can see them coming off the coast of Africa and it'll just be weeks and weeks and weeks of turning the turning out there like okay y'all better get ready y'all better get ready this thing coming this thing just popped up in like a a day or two days a tropical storm go from tropical storm to Hurricane I mean it was it was only two uh two miles per hour less than being a category five and if a category four can do that type of Destruction and not just here I mean after it left Florida it kept moving and went on up in in South Carolina and trees uprooted in houses I mean one storm do all that they heard somebody saying that they need to think about rebuilding in these on these coastal towns maybe not setting up not not building again on the coastal towns because we're prone to have uh um storms like this let me tell you something I don't care whether you put the house right on the beach or you put it in the middle of the land God's judgment is striking the Earth but you know here's the thing here's the thing and and and and I'm I'm careful about this um we can't speak to Every Storm [Music] some of y'all don't want no trials y'all speak to everything coming your way now you got to go through something that's how you develop character y'all ain't talking to me come on that's why you want to open up your mouth and speak I don't want to go through nothing no God know what he's doing yeah can I say it like this God gave you that boss for a reason amen Hallelujah if my boss would change no why don't you change [Music] hello somebody hey glory to God I'm a witness at Unseen folk change State attitude towards their boss the next thing you know the bosses talking them up the Boston change about them but you had to be the one to change first change from the inside and when you change from the inside it impacts the outside accept the corner weak go on the ground in about us alone but when it when it's willing to die then it can bring forth much fruit nature itself is growing and waiting for the time of the manifestation why before the atonement was made before the Holy Ghost was ever poured out before the Old Testament on down there there couldn't have been manifestation it had to wait till this time now all things has been brought coming shaping up to headstone to the manifestation of the sons of God coming back and the spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly oh the spirit of God coming in I'm talking about men and women the spirit of God coming in so perfectly and to their Ministry would be so close like Christ till to join him and his church together I was listening to brother Jason recently he was preaching and he was talking about um um brother Branham you know and I think uh here take me to uh proving his word that's where I'm going to go next uh it was saying how and brother Ram's Ministry was just very very unique and so much the Holy Spirit just used me in so many ways so many Supernatural things happened and uh one of them uh oftentimes some of the old-timers uh that was with him and and saw the hand of God they they began to just kind of come I want to say they had strange doctors I'll say that it was strange doctrines but I learned to have a little Grace with the people because of what they went through and um in one of the strange man they was they were saying brother Brandon was Jesus they were saying that but but you know and I don't agree with that I don't agree with that at all now to a certain part if I can say it like this just as Jesus is Manifest himself in you makes you Jesus I can see him in the same light man right I hope y'all I hope y'all can kind of Follow The Line there okay uh but but sometimes it's it's worship and adoration and all that and that's not it now when I quote the prophet it's a reason why I quote the prophet I could come up here and quote Billy Graham I could come up here and quote Oral Roberts and people would have no problem or Robert said but when I say William Branham why do you have a problem with that I'm just telling you where I got this from I ain't make this up on my own and it's a Vindicated word that came to us right but but brother brother Jason Walker was saying say you know um brother brother Perry green May testified one time he says you know I know these brothers go around they make brother Brandon more than what he needs to be and all that and I understand he says I don't you know uh he says but but just just y'all try to put yourself in their shoes well what if it was you what if it was you in Florida fishing with the prophet and y'all caught up you got a big bass on the line and it's bad about about to pull you in and in the basket hung up in the weeds down there so you decide you know what I'm gonna help we ain't gonna lose this one I'm gonna help you I'm gonna jump out there and I'm gonna get this bass and brother jump out down the excitement grab that bass and when he grabbed the bass a rattler got him in the middle of nowhere no hospital around and typically when you get bit by a rattlesnake it's immediate death brother random looked at the brother and said ain't no way I can carry that big old man out of here and by the time I get him out of here uh the poison be all through his body he'll be he'll be a dead man I can't do nothing the best I can do at this time is just pray for this brother laid hands on the brother prayed for him brother Evans prayed for him and uh after after he prayed for the brother said he didn't feel no pain and says he kept fishing the rest of the day no no no no no no no poison coming up his bloodstream and just just went the rest of the day and and that night he saw his brother and told his brother what happened say I got bit by a rattler today and the brother had just been bitten by a snake like a few weeks before and he knew everything he went through in the hospital all kinds of stuff he said he says he said I got bit by a rattler today and I'm feeling fine he said you better get to the hospital as soon as you can and say I I I've been out the hospital for all these hours ain't nothing happened to me ain't nothing gonna happen to me you know later I said I'ma just just believe God he said but you need to have some sense and look I'm sorry I got bit the man prayed I ain't feeling no pain I ain't feeling no pain an hour ago I didn't feel it five hours ago I ain't feeling it right now I ain't gonna feel it in the morning a week later I ain't feeling it a year later I ain't feeling no pain walking by faith he said let that happen to you and let a man pray for you what would you think [Music] if it happened to you see soda stop putting people down all the time try to understand where they're coming from I'm trying to get out of here um yesterday I was I happened to go to the hospital and I was going for some business and um I'm sitting there and and security guard looking at me and like uh she's like I know you I say sorry I I don't know you um you say she said it's your only job you you that's your only job you this is your business right it's your only job I said no I do a whole bunch of stuff I say uh but most importantly I'm a pastor she said yeah uh okay uh what are your church at in Riviera I said no no we meet in school in West Palm says um I know you just kept working I'm like I don't I don't know you should say you know uh in West Palm there was a church on Haverhill said now we used to meet on Abbey Hill see I walked into a church one day on Haverhill over there by the Dollar General and said I came in that church and I asked the pastor to come to the hospital room and pray for my twin and he came and prayed for my twin and I never got around to tell them but after he prayed and that he said my she said my twin they gave her a five percent chance of living but that Pastor came and prayed and the very next day she was back up on her feet they say you the pastor I said yeah I remember coming to pray for your sister [Applause] our God is real I said y'all need to come and share the testimony to the church she said but my sister been doing fine ever since you came five percent chance of living oh my God now you let me tell you something yeah yeah if God can do that for a person that's not really a Believer and I don't want to I don't want to say they they have not come to recognize the gene that is in their life is that better those that have recognized the gene that is in their life we expect God to do great things for you it's his will that we prosper and be in good health [Music] let me try to finish this here out of proven his word now he had to believe his old crop had died off the unbelievers who said we couldn't take it you let everyone in them perish why every one of them but the Believers who was left Moses had been taking the glory and the unbelievers had um perished in the wilderness and this was their children they were the only two that crossed over that that was the Believers Joshua and Caleb they was a believers they was the one who was crossed over it's only it's the only way God can do it is by his believing children you believe that all right his Believers was the ones that done it he used them to cross over with C now I want you to notice he does it that way in every age he does it every time by the same method he has to take believers praise God amen he has to take believers glory amen and then in order to have Believers to meet that word he's got to Pro destinate it to that age so what am I trying to say God predestinated me God pro destinated you to be a believer and that's why you can't go nowhere else because you were predestinated to be a believer my I thank God for that uh you see it he's got to predestinate this thing to be there can I go a little further he had to put you on the job that he gave you he had to prodestinate you to be there with the disposition that you have in order to light up the age uh look at what he said he says he got he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age did it get you that statement he's asking did it get you did you feel it did you see it did you understand it that's what's happening today he predestinated to this by his foreknowledge when he predestinated in Malachi 4 is got to happen when he come over and predestinates anything to happen in his word he had to prove his word to be so that's why I asked people all the time anytime you're having a problem anybody that's brother Brandon's not the prophet brother Brandon okay okay okay okay okay I'm not gonna argue with that I'm not brother Brandon is a prophet and I ain't arguing about that that's that's ridiculous that's a crazy argument you say he not the prophet okay open up your Bible listen for me behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord now this is what God promises were brother Branham you say is not the prophet okay tell me who is that's all I need to know just tell me who is and I'll stop wasting my time amen but since you don't know who is I'm gonna keep this imma hold on to this until that comes I'm just talking about what the Bible say I see him as a manifestation of the word of God just like I see John the Baptist as a manifestation of the word of God you know what I see else what else I see I see you as a manifestation of the word of God the Earth is grown and waiting for the manifestations of the sons and daughters of God I'm here to tell the Earth you ain't got to wait much longer they here they recognizing who they are and when they recognize who they are you know what's going to happen Rapture amen let me finish here did you get it did you feel it did you see it did you understand it that's what's happening today he predestinedated to this by his foreign got to happen when they come over and predestinates anything to happen in his word he had to prove his word to be so when he predestinates anything that happened and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there it might be covered underneath Darkness but that seed is there he knows that seed would be there just at that time he predestinated a bribe she's going to be there going to be a Rapture she's going to be there he predestinated by his foreknowledge see there's nothing going to stop it I am so happy about that let me give you one last statement out of Oneness just to encourage you oh ye are gods ye are Gods amen that means you're going to rise up you're going to take control and you're going to stop letting the devil just do whatever you want to do in your life and one of the brothers said last week you know um it's a brother Brandon made the statement it says when we fighting one another when we're fighting one another the devil not fighting us double not fighting us you know what the devil's doing man with a hand in the father look at this callers demons will watch this one look at this look at what he said to her look at what she said look at this the devil not even fighting you fighting each other amen free make the devil do some work don't do all the work for the devil make him do some work here we go watch this this is this is for this this gives the little little spiritual vitamin we know we make mistakes but you mustn't look at that it's not your mistakes because you're always going to have them but you see it's following his rules following what he said do stumbling and falling doesn't have one thing to do with it a real true servant it feels stumble he'll get up again if he wobbles God pulls him right back in the path as long as he's in the path of Duty but if he's off of the path of Duty God's not obligated to him but as long as he's in the path of Duty God's obligated to him knowing that he's just a man or a woman he's obligated to that person as long as they're in the path of Duty so don't You Wobble in your mistakes and don't you sit there and just be pulled me pull me but no no get up you are a god and you don't handle yourself like that you were born for such a time as this let's pray father we thank you for your word Jesus thank you for uh God your truth that just speak to us and calls us out of where we are to where we're supposed to be sometimes we go through life like Esther not realizing the full purpose and the full plan that you have for us Lord but as you started Discerning the purpose here is that we would know our position we would recognize our position and father I just pray that uh through the Revelation word that we would come to that knowledge change has to happen from the inside to affect the outside so a lot let us allow the word the changes we want you to be glorified we want you to be magnified in and through us something says in my life Lord be glorified and my home Lord be glorified and My Heart Lord be glorified that's my desire of Jesus it's the Lord we prayed that you would just let your word take root let us take this corner wheat go in the ground and let us die that we might bring forth fruit things that would make you happy we don't want to be like that fig tree Lord that you saw on Earth that was not producing fruit so you cursed it God we want to be fruitful in our lives I pray your blessings Lord upon your people the Lord Jesus that you would just continue to get all the glory and all the praise from all that we do in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord amen I want a brother Solomon have you come but uh brother Gabriel come and discreet the church amen before you leave maybe brother will sway can just kind of do an interpreting for you back there amen or we can get brother Quaker who you want to do The Interpreter really quickly after after brother Gabriel greets brother Solomon you can come and just take the service that's awesome oh wonderful times right wonderful wonderful preaching and I'm so glad that I am one of them amen hallelujah yes we are here with the purpose and and well today I have greetings from my people there in Colombia we have been working hard in our missionary doing in in my country having really good results by the way you know it's just beautiful the missionary work you know everywhere you go when you are in the pulse of Duty the Lord does really good things in your life amen so we're thankful I appreciate all of your prayers brother cueco has been twice in my country Colombia helping us out in the things that we are doing in this missionary trying to reach that last soul that probably is in Colombia probably is here in the states probably he is here in the building right and the Rapture will come right so we praise the Lord so greetings from my people there in Colombia we have two missions right now since we started doing this missionary work in November last year we're going in the streets and we are giving food to the people to the poor people to the needy people you know we have a lot of Venezuelan people that has come to our country trying to find a path to go down South America trying to find jobs trying to find a new way of living we also have a lot of poverty in our country we have elderly people that are working in the streets recycling trash and that's the kind of people that we are working with okay so so far for you to understand this work until today since we started in November the 13th last year until today we have given away 13 000 meals to people 13 000 meals to people yes [Applause] time for for Ministry like ours you know that's a huge amount of food that we have given but the the thing that we have to praise God you know is that when we want to bless the people with the food we ask them do you want to be more blessed the people mostly they say yes of course so we ask them right do you want us to pray for you and the people say okay pray for me you know and mostly say I pray for my family pray because I need a job you know so we have been seeing good results okay and out of those people some and start asking questions are you guys Christians because you know that in Colombia mostly we are Catholic right so mostly come your Christians yes where do you gather so so we have a place by the grace of God that we gather people in the center in the downtown of the city where I live which is called fusagatsuga and so far we are mostly 45 people in that place by the grace of God that's something wonderful most of the people that are coming come from that work that we are doing that's this that's very very awesome you know and we started not so far you know like three or four months ago we started another place another spot to have another mission where we one day we were 62 people there listening to the word of God by the grace of God okay well you know that people comes up and come down you know and they start making questions so but you know the last thing which is something amazing and wonderful we found this little spot in a river that is called Jordan River nearby where we live you know those waters are cleared you know I'm pure it's just a beautiful place and so far since we started we have 19 people baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ foreign [Music] is happening in Colombia please keep us in your prayers okay and out of those people you know that we're unmarried you know living together you know for 12 years you know another for six years

because of me it's his it is all his work is his and all the glory is he is the one that deserves it okay and we are just preaching the same gospel that brother Branham preached we're not preaching something different amen because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and he's the same today and he's the same forever amen because like brother I just love what is happening I just love what is happening you know when I was coming in I was Broadcasting and and I did the same thing that brother Jack said when he was up here when we met out there you know let's take a picture with that number three seven seven it has a meaning because we know that William Marion Branham had seven numbers in his name right but we know that if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday to him forever you know he's bringing a price that is going to be the manifestation of the children of God I truly believe it and if I am here witnessing and giving this testimony to all of you is because I really believe that something good is happening in this world in these last days we love you we remind you you know and I give thanks to God because I met Brooke who in Texas and he was the point of connection with all
