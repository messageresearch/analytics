[56:42] of the nations and they shall draw their

[57:25] evolution of Satan we see that in this
[57:32] day and time that uh as the scripture
[57:37] read here that he's he's certainly very
[57:44] wise we understand through the
[57:50] scriptures that he was the angel
[57:55] that was cast down a man that wisdom and
[58:01] beauty was his tools and he's still
[58:07] using those things to deceive mankind
[58:11] even today I'm going to read another set
[58:17] of scriptures here you can take your

[58:59] First Samuel chapter reading from the
[59:05] fourth verse he says then all the elders
[59:08] of Israel gathered themselves together
[59:10] and came to Samuel unto Rama and said
[59:15] unto him behold there are old
[59:19] and our sons walk not in their ways and
[59:24] now make us a king to judge us like all
[59:32] the nations but the thing displeased the
[59:42] prophet Samuel when they say give us a
[59:46] king to judge us and Samuel prayed unto
[59:51] the Lord and the Lord said unto Samuel
[59:55] hearken unto the voice of that people
[59:58] and all that they say unto thee for they
[1:00:03] have not rejected thee
[1:00:08] but they have rejected me that I should
[1:00:14] not reign over them according to all the
[1:00:19] works which they have done which I'm
[1:00:22] sorry
[1:00:23] according to all the works which they
[1:00:25] have done since the day that I the Lord
[1:00:30] brought them out of Egypt even unto this
[1:00:35] thing and I'll say even unto this thing
[1:00:41] wherewith they have forsaken me and
[1:00:45] served of the gods
[1:00:49] so do they also unto me now therefore
[1:00:56] hearken unto the voice howbeit yet
[1:01:00] protests solemnly unto them and show
[1:01:04] them the manner of the king that shall
[1:01:09] reign over them and as we look oh here
[1:01:14] Samuel begin the sake night now you ask
[1:01:17] for this thing not now what's going to
[1:01:21] happen is this week this this man is
[1:01:28] going to select a group of men okay
[1:01:34] and what they're going to do here is
[1:01:38] he'll take your sons and appoint them
[1:01:42] for himself for his chariots and to be
[1:01:49] his horsemen and some shall run before
[1:01:56] his chariots not ride run
[1:02:02] before his change him making himself a
[1:02:07] big man in London when the Samuel was
[1:02:12] just the opposite meek lowly and put God
[1:02:20] first not puffed up and was all about
[1:02:28] himself and his own desires so we see it
[1:02:36] goes on that he says he will appoint him
[1:02:40] captain's over thousands and captain's
[1:02:45] over the fifties and will set them to
[1:02:50] ear his ground and to reap his harvest
[1:02:55] we're talking about king man to ear his
[1:03:00] ground let me know what the word is
[1:03:03] among the people who among some and
[1:03:08] befriend some and hear what he's saying
[1:03:10] it's about control now I want you to be
[1:03:17] aware they came out of Egypt by the
[1:03:22] strong hand of the Lord and through
[1:03:30] deceit trickery and unawareness slip
[1:03:37] right back into bondage the same thing
[1:03:43] Pharaoh did he had taskmaster they just
[1:03:46] had different names but it was the same
[1:03:50] bondage we're gonna get into some in a
[1:03:53] minute here
[1:03:54] a man y'all bear with me I might be
[1:04:00] slogan we thorough amen
[1:04:04] a man now though the word religion means
[1:04:16] a covering it means to cover something
[1:04:21] now we look back in Genesis and we see
[1:04:24] that uh Adam had started though first
[1:04:30] religion well I would say first Adam
[1:04:36] they had the first church to members
[1:04:41] Adam and Eve they met in the Kulin
[1:04:46] evening to meet and fellowship with God
[1:04:51] and then what happened
[1:04:56] we see that uh sin Christine and we'll
[1:05:01] just leave a day we won't go and all of
[1:05:03] that but see it crappy and just like man
[1:05:09] instead of embracing it and going into
[1:05:12] the bank and confessing it then Lord I'm
[1:05:16] sorry I did this they ring realizing
[1:05:23] because of the sin that they were naked
[1:05:29] before then they had no awareness of it
[1:05:34] they were veiled to the whole situation
[1:05:38] much like the dogs cats animals they
[1:05:43] walk around naked but it don't bother
[1:05:46] him see they not working around said
[1:05:50] lord I got to put something I know they
[1:05:53] just being who they are because they are
[1:05:56] veiled but because of the sin in the
[1:06:01] garden we now have to cover it just came
[1:06:05] naturally so what happened
[1:06:08] Adam started the first denomination when
[1:06:15] he took some fig leaves and sold them
[1:06:19] together and for covering to cover what
[1:06:25] his shame we didn't go somewhere y'all
[1:06:29] to cover his shame when God forgot God's
[1:06:36] provided weight was a death for
[1:06:41] atonement the Adam Adam walked out they
[1:06:46] hid themselves and came up with that
[1:06:49] denominational covering on but first of
[1:06:53] all we got to address this hill so he
[1:06:56] went and killed two lamps now not
[1:07:00] because of your shame an innocent lamb
[1:07:04] has the gun perfect type of Christ and
[1:07:12] took the bloody skins from that innocent
[1:07:16] lamb the Prophet said that that lamb
[1:07:19] skin was still wet with the blood of the
[1:07:24] Lamb put the cloud road of this freshly
[1:07:31] slaughtered innocent lamb the blood
[1:07:35] running down the back of Adam's leave
[1:07:40] and they realize them now not only their
[1:07:45] shame but their guilt this lamb at that
[1:07:50] time nothing had to lose its life it was
[1:07:52] a perfect situation
[1:07:55] it's the cruelty of sin that it brings
[1:08:00] death
[1:08:02] it's going to bring death you know if
[1:08:06] it'll bring that to you those around you
[1:08:11] it'll bring death to things that you're
[1:08:14] not even aware of it is a law that sin
[1:08:18] brings death now they got this covering
[1:08:25] off and we go home that we see that
[1:08:29] there's a vast difference a man between
[1:08:33] religion and salvation
[1:08:38] religion is a covering salvation is a
[1:08:45] birth salvation is the birth it is a
[1:08:51] gift of God and it cannot be achieved by
[1:08:55] any man or in a group of men it is an
[1:09:00] individual that God brings to this gift
[1:09:05] Adam started that and failed he tried to
[1:09:14] start his own religion and it failed now
[1:09:18] we see that uh there was another fella
[1:09:20] that tried to start his own religion
[1:09:23] followed by the name of Nimrod Nimrod
[1:09:26] tried to make an organization after the
[1:09:30] ants alluvion flood and they began to
[1:09:35] civilize civilization they begin to
[1:09:41] select men of renown supposedly educated
[1:09:48] and Nimrod this man of sin took Babylon
[1:09:55] and his sister churches and places
[1:10:00] around which a type of it in the last
[1:10:03] day the apostasy of Christianity today
[1:10:07] fraud with their education and man
[1:10:14] knowledge and wisdom to reach God they
[1:10:20] built the tower that say okay if it's
[1:10:24] loud again we'll just go up to the top
[1:10:27] of the tile and be safe
[1:10:30] but God provided a way from the
[1:10:34] beginning all you had to do was listen
[1:10:37] to the prophet Noah get in the boat
[1:10:42] very simple there was a provider now if
[1:10:46] you want to circumvent around God's Way
[1:10:51] with your own intellect select a man or
[1:10:58] group of men as your leader and they say
[1:11:03] well they had a council meeting say will
[1:11:07] fill the tower that's man stinking God's
[1:11:12] thinking this will tear down and will go
[1:11:16] to the altar will listen to will go
[1:11:21] God's provided wait and God destroyed
[1:11:25] that denomination because that's what it
[1:11:28] was those were not sinners building this
[1:11:34] power they were religious men men of
[1:11:38] renown if not the people wouldn't follow
[1:11:41] them the devil is not crazy he is not
[1:11:48] going to come to you with something
[1:11:51] that's altogether out the scripture he
[1:11:57] is going to come to you with birth and
[1:12:04] then don't slip a line now
[1:12:08] amen
[1:12:09] y'all pray for me we see in the
[1:12:13] scripture Cora tried to do the very same
[1:12:18] thing
[1:12:20] he got all the Levites together
[1:12:24] Levites were the ministers of that day
[1:12:27] and he got a the Levites in some of the
[1:12:34] celebrities at that time so now you got
[1:12:38] ministers who being influenced by
[1:12:43] popularity with the celebrities and
[1:12:48] these habían and great men and holy men
[1:12:51] Nathan got together saying it's not
[1:12:56] right that one man be over us and so
[1:13:00] they tried to get an organization
[1:13:01] started and they come up and for Moses
[1:13:05] in there and God had chosen for the work
[1:13:11] and told them they took too much upon
[1:13:17] themselves
[1:13:17] Moses you evil you're doing too much
[1:13:20] you're doing too much and the whole
[1:13:26] congregation was only the whole
[1:13:31] congregation was solely Clara I believe
[1:13:35] he was a sincere man believe that demand
[1:13:40] that it means to do wrong it was his
[1:13:44] ignorance or lack of understanding that
[1:13:49] he didn't see the hand of God moving and
[1:13:53] know the scriptures and that's the
[1:13:57] reason he just brought it to I'm sorry
[1:14:03] he just brought it to reasoning now we
[1:14:07] try to inject our own thinking and to
[1:14:12] the program of God we're not supposed to
[1:14:17] try to interject our thinking into God's
[1:14:20] program but what we're supposed to do is
[1:14:24] surrender to his will surrender our
[1:14:29] thinking to the will of God
[1:14:34] clora with good intent went around with
[1:14:36] false doctrine telling these brothers
[1:14:39] showing them by reason that God had only
[1:14:42] blessed Moses the Prophet the messenger
[1:14:46] he said the whole congregation was holy
[1:14:48] Moses is not just you mr. hope the whole
[1:14:52] congregation is holy and so they got men
[1:14:55] and Levites that is God's choice not to
[1:15:00] leave ice so would be called today
[1:15:02] ministers did not Moses called Levites
[1:15:07] he called them and there he never went
[1:15:11] and run and and got a revenant talking
[1:15:17] about core 9 he told them to take
[1:15:19] sensors put holding fire in it and put
[1:15:24] the incense over the top and to wave the
[1:15:27] holy incense which was the commandment
[1:15:30] of Lord oh it seemed pretty good it
[1:15:36] seemed like a pretty good Church day
[1:15:37] going through all of the right steps are
[1:15:40] all the right motions God said to Moses
[1:15:44] and Aaron separate yourself get away
[1:15:49] from them come out from among them for
[1:15:54] later oh they would call sinners and
[1:15:57] unbelievers but they thought they was
[1:16:02] going in the correct way but they was
[1:16:06] deceived by a group of men instead of
[1:16:12] following God's prophet they were
[1:16:15] deceived by a group of men now amen
[1:16:22] most of the time religion is the
[1:16:30] convenient cover for Satan
[1:16:35] all of us that are Christian today have
[1:16:39] come out God out of some sort of a
[1:16:44] struggle and we can maybe look back and
[1:16:47] said well I'm glad God delivered me from
[1:16:49] that and I'm where I'm at but make no
[1:16:53] mistake about it he is always trying to
[1:16:57] pull you back into a world of sin that
[1:17:03] you struggle so hard to get out of he's
[1:17:06] not going through in the way that you
[1:17:09] Willis expect he has no problem with you
[1:17:14] not running the streets he has no
[1:17:18] problem with you not drinking liquor
[1:17:23] rebel rouser murderers whoremongers
[1:17:29] thief
[1:17:31] most of us wouldn't break in the bank we
[1:17:33] got the courage to do it
[1:17:36] but what he will do is use religion to
[1:17:43] get you off track to where you were
[1:17:50] worship him without knowing it his whole
[1:17:57] plan is to be worshipped as the Most
[1:18:03] High now you know he taught my life is
[1:18:07] look Satan is wise he realized how I got
[1:18:14] this gotta get you if I can get you
[1:18:15] going I'll pray behind the road you
[1:18:20] gonna be son lost you won't know how to
[1:18:23] get back
[1:18:29] proper guy said this big i'ma say it in
[1:18:36] half cause it's on my heart
[1:18:37] he said the Catholic Church with the
[1:18:39] first Pentecost and he said look at how
[1:18:45] far they are from the truth today he say
[1:18:50] instant i'ma say if the current
[1:18:54] Pentecostal Church in two thousand years
[1:18:58] there be so much farther from the truth
[1:19:01] if they continue to travel off the word
[1:19:04] at the rate that they're going we we we
[1:19:11] have to recognize if we don't recognize
[1:19:15] the state's tactics will fall fall it's
[1:19:21] the same tricks all through time is to
[1:19:25] get you to worship Him without doing it
[1:19:30] to get you off the mark but be religious
[1:19:36] you don't mind being religious because
[1:19:39] he knows no power in there there's no
[1:19:44] power there's no birth there's no
[1:19:48] transformation Satan knows that there is
[1:19:58] one God I'm gonna put that out there he
[1:20:02] was there he knows that there is one God
[1:20:07] but harmony no he's a deceiver and a
[1:20:10] liar at one time all the people of the
[1:20:16] earth believed in one God a man supreme
[1:20:21] eternal invisible who vowed a world of
[1:20:26] his mouth spoke all things into
[1:20:29] existence and and that in the character
[1:20:34] he was loving good and just but I Satan
[1:20:40] will always come up
[1:20:42] whatever he can we find him corrupting
[1:20:46] the minds and hearts of men so that they
[1:20:48] reject the troops he always attempt to
[1:20:53] receive worship as though he were God
[1:20:57] and not the servant but the creation of
[1:21:03] God he drew his worship away from God to
[1:21:08] the end that he might draw worship unto
[1:21:12] Him unto himself and so be exalted he
[1:21:17] certainly did accomplish that desire to
[1:21:22] spread his religion throughout the whole
[1:21:26] world amen
[1:21:29] later but you see the sovereign God
[1:21:34] displayed himself a man as a savior to
[1:21:41] reconcile me and back unto himself now
[1:21:46] we see the Bible said the serpent was
[1:21:52] the most subtle beast of the field
[1:21:54] he was the smarter he almost had a soul
[1:22:00] he had a place for soul but what did he
[1:22:06] do he sold out to deceive God to try to
[1:22:16] Satan himself the spirit knew that was
[1:22:23] the only scene that would impregnate the
[1:22:27] woman the chimpanzee wouldn't do it
[1:22:32] couldn't do it it wouldn't mix and
[1:22:35] everything else so all he know that the
[1:22:40] germ of life that was in that chimpanzee
[1:22:43] would not come to the field of a woman
[1:22:46] but he know the serpent she would do it
[1:22:51] and Adam had new Adam had never knew
[1:22:58] Thank you very
[1:23:01] that me I could be done had no need to
[1:23:07] know it he never knew they didn't know
[1:23:11] they was naked
[1:23:12] he had these I wasn't even over there
[1:23:16] but Satan knew a man he uh they made
[1:23:29] y'all pray from the government look some
[1:23:30] mixed up here a man
[1:23:45] any man a double life any man
[1:23:57] hey man we realized that Adam knew that
[1:24:02] uh the uh what uh my more at the
[1:24:08] freelancing manner but be the lower want
[1:24:10] me to do the law that that that Satan
[1:24:13] knew a man that uh he must have left
[1:24:20] some someone knows was back in the bag
[1:24:22] that Mister someone knows a man that uh
[1:24:26] he knew what God's plan was and Satan
[1:24:32] wanted to be a worship as a man the
[1:24:38] Messiah now now one of the things that
[1:24:48] Satan desired to do was to get people
[1:24:51] off he if he can get the people off for
[1:24:56] the word just a little bit so what what
[1:25:01] he what he did is he introduced a
[1:25:08] polytheistic form of worship now at that
[1:25:13] time when they came out of the flood
[1:25:17] you had him Sam and Jacob now him that
[1:25:22] his genealogy keep the got cush cush
[1:25:26] begat Nimrod Nimrod built the tower and
[1:25:32] out of that Babylon they begin this
[1:25:37] polytheistic worship now remember that I
[1:25:40] say say knew that there was one God knew
[1:25:44] it but they began in this polytheistic
[1:25:47] form of worship that mean the worship of
[1:25:51] multiple gods no say so well there maybe
[1:25:55] that's an open door I could probably get
[1:25:59] in there amen and that's how he's going
[1:26:02] to draw worship Him to himself I stay
[1:26:04] with me he he they they build this tower
[1:26:08] and they begin to fall
[1:26:10] on this religion he went when God
[1:26:15] destroyed the tower he confounded the
[1:26:19] languages and they spread out to all
[1:26:22] parts of the earth Buddha has a
[1:26:29] representation of God as a man with
[1:26:33] three hands also India they have a
[1:26:37] representation of God as a man with
[1:26:43] three hands all throughout the world
[1:26:47] there's different forms but it's a
[1:26:50] polytheistic form of worship that there
[1:26:54] is multiple gods started through him to
[1:27:03] cush who never because of the scene now
[1:27:09] we look on the other side through well
[1:27:14] Seth they win oh and if she said hero is
[1:27:26] real
[1:27:27] now if we talking about the same time
[1:27:28] frame one week this week and did one
[1:27:31] thing started civilization why would
[1:27:33] another way and begot Abraham Abraham
[1:27:39] begat Isaac and Jacob and they say here
[1:27:47] o Israel the Lord our God is one now
[1:27:55] over here they got this polytheistic
[1:27:58] form of worship and and we we see here
[1:28:04] in this country is the most deceiving
[1:28:07] polytheistic form of worship
[1:28:11] representing the father has an old man
[1:28:17] representing the Sun as a baby in the
[1:28:22] manger and representing the Holy Ghost
[1:28:27] as a dovetail so we do things in the
[1:28:32] name of the Father the Son and the Holy
[1:28:38] Ghost polytheistic where does it come
[1:28:43] from they come right there from the same
[1:28:46] cush Nimrod wait he's introducing a seed
[1:28:53] that cannot produce itself and through
[1:28:58] his trickery and through his deception
[1:29:01] has deceived many we pray in the name of
[1:29:07] the Lord Jesus Christ the first thing
[1:29:11] you curl up when you scared of something
[1:29:13] to happen bumpy with a large egg has
[1:29:15] helped me
[1:29:16] we don't say Lord father son Holy Ghost
[1:29:19] come quickly
[1:29:22] we do everything in the name of the Lord
[1:29:28] Jesus Christ but he wants you to baptize
[1:29:33] in the name of the Father Son in the
[1:29:35] heart of good what is that
[1:29:39] nobody will argue with you when you say
[1:29:42] your you crazy I pray in the name of the
[1:29:44] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:45] you got no argument none whatsoever but
[1:29:49] the minute you say have baptize you in
[1:29:54] the name of why because you cannot
[1:29:57] receive the baptism of Holy Ghost any
[1:30:01] other way
[1:30:04] and if he can keep you know listen then
[1:30:08] the new birth and the fact of the middle
[1:30:13] Holy Ghost is different you're born into
[1:30:16] this body by election I didn't choose to
[1:30:20] be averse
[1:30:21] I was chosen it wasn't an idea as it
[1:30:26] showed up and they I was already born
[1:30:30] into it the fact that you're sitting
[1:30:34] here the fact that you're here and if
[1:30:37] this word is producing a car shows that
[1:30:43] you weren't chosen for him elected and
[1:30:47] that you are elected to the birth yeah
[1:30:52] what you have to do is to go out to be
[1:30:55] placed in him he knows that what that
[1:31:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost is gonna do
[1:31:02] give you power
[1:31:04] power to overcome power to withstand
[1:31:09] there will be a bride without a spot or
[1:31:12] wrinkle why because he promised it
[1:31:17] simply because he promised it Abraham
[1:31:22] and Sarah
[1:31:24] he says Abraham I will bless you
[1:31:29] according to the time of life Abraham
[1:31:32] already being wailed in age his wife
[1:31:35] buried well over the yay age of
[1:31:39] childbearing years he had this promise
[1:31:47] he held that his promise the older he
[1:31:51] got it seemed less likely to the next
[1:31:55] rely for this to happen the worst it get
[1:32:01] in this world it's seen the less likely
[1:32:07] that the full manifestations of the sons
[1:32:11] of God how in this evil place
[1:32:15] with all of the calamity and destruction
[1:32:19] of men wait this is the most all of the
[1:32:24] scenes of every age is congested bottled
[1:32:29] up right here in this time but the Bible
[1:32:37] says when Satan comes in like a flood
[1:32:41] that means wave after wave after wave
[1:32:48] the Spirit of the Lord a raise up a
[1:32:52] standard against it why because he
[1:32:56] promised it and he's a God that cannot
[1:32:59] lie there will be a full manifestation
[1:33:09] those three angels came up to the tent
[1:33:12] of Abraham he said Lord now remember on
[1:33:18] the other side of town
[1:33:21] faithful worshiping three gods
[1:33:25] Abraham saw one Lord saw one Lord
[1:33:31] so it show he was right on the scripture
[1:33:34] he was right there he was it wasn't it
[1:33:37] wasn't something that somebody taught
[1:33:39] him it was in his heart it was a party
[1:33:44] knew cuz he talked with God he prayed he
[1:33:47] had a fellowship with God talking to
[1:33:54] Abraham I will visit you according to
[1:33:57] the time of life Sarah laughed in the
[1:34:01] tent
[1:34:02] within a heart he said why does Sarah
[1:34:06] laugh he said I will visit her the
[1:34:11] promise of that flesh the child became
[1:34:18] the full and complete manifestation when
[1:34:23] she gave birth
[1:34:26] she gave birth to the promise she gave
[1:34:32] birth to the promise I'd like to say to
[1:34:37] you today we have a promise we will give
[1:34:43] birth to the promise there will be the
[1:34:50] sons of God that will produce in flesh

[1:35:07] be in do with power from Oaxaca that
[1:35:12] will prove that there will be a pride
[1:35:16] without a spotter Winkle wrinkle that's
[1:35:20] manifesting all the promises all the
[1:35:25] gifts of God again on this earth but say
[1:35:32] what he wants to do is to try to confuse
[1:35:34] the people he know that if you don't
[1:35:39] know God's provide away you'll never get
[1:35:41] it you'll never get it the reason so

[1:41:13] the Word of God is calling you urging
[1:41:17] you pulling you Satan is pulling you
[1:41:23] pulling you into the opposite direction
[1:41:26] using schemes and tactics not like I
[1:41:30] said if the target is straight in front
[1:41:33] all he has to do is nudge you just a
[1:41:36] little bit and you miss the target it
[1:41:41] has to be line upon line precept upon
[1:41:45] precept now I want to go back into this
[1:41:50] now that I found my nose no let me go
[1:41:52] back over here we see
[1:41:59] that anytime an organization organizers
[1:42:07] and a lot of people try to say that
[1:42:11] we're denomination as well but I say
[1:42:15] unto you that it's not the case we don't
[1:42:18] have bylaws and we don't have the
[1:42:20] headquarters we don't have a boy neither
[1:42:23] do we have a board of directors we have
[1:42:26] of sovereignty of the pastor the local
[1:42:29] church that is led by the Holy Ghost to
[1:42:34] preach to a body of believers the
[1:42:36] unsearchable riches of God and that's
[1:42:39] the way it should be
[1:42:39] I see here I have this I cannot just did
[1:42:45] some low research says Amy McPherson
[1:42:49] after the death of a mimic spiritual in
[1:42:51] 1944 her son Roth Kate McPherson became
[1:42:56] president and leader of the Church a
[1:42:58] position held for 44 years the 4-square
[1:43:02] Church formed the Pentecostal Fellowship
[1:43:06] of America in 1948 in Des Moines Iowa in
[1:43:10] the alliance with the Assemblies of God
[1:43:11] and the Church of God the open Bible
[1:43:14] standard churches the Pentecostal
[1:43:16] Holiness and others in in 1994 46 years
[1:43:21] after the founding of the Pentecostal
[1:43:23] fellowship it was reorganized as the
[1:43:27] Pentecostal charismatic churches of
[1:43:28] North America after combining with
[1:43:31] African American organizations most
[1:43:33] significantly Church of God in Christ
[1:43:37] built by Amy McPherson a man as one
[1:43:44] organization under one body under one
[1:43:49] board that is where the Pentecostal
[1:43:54] church went to they just said they all
[1:43:56] bound them together up under their
[1:43:59] leader of Amy McPherson which she was
[1:44:02] not a bad lady she pre started she new
[1:44:05] headquarters in Los Angeles California
[1:44:12] which spurred out of a revival of piece
[1:44:17] of the street in Los Angeles California
[1:44:21] when the gifts first failed in this
[1:44:26] country the gifts first fail in this
[1:44:29] country there was a great revival people
[1:44:33] was coming from all over the world right
[1:44:36] there started from a prayer meeting at a
[1:44:39] house went to a barn people were being
[1:44:42] healed speaking in tongues the power of
[1:44:46] God was moving people come from all over
[1:44:50] and from this there was a revival
[1:44:53] started God was moving revealing
[1:44:59] themselves to people all kind of
[1:45:02] denominations spear from that time
[1:45:07] people meeting will just like Cora but
[1:45:14] not staying with the word the word
[1:45:18] always always you look from Genesis to
[1:45:23] Malachi to the day the word always come
[1:45:28] to a prophet God is always but another
[1:45:31] present on the scene to direct the
[1:45:34] people to truth and it's the only way
[1:45:38] that you're going to be able to escape
[1:45:41] the trickeries of the devil the only way
[1:45:48] to have a puff is God's provided way you
[1:45:55] see that that common Christianity is so
[1:46:02] far off the word that they're accepting
[1:46:06] anything accepting anything they're not
[1:46:12] preaching the true on adultery
[1:46:14] they're not preaching repentance anymore
[1:46:18] come have coffee socials
[1:46:24] be a good person many a good people died
[1:46:28] in the flood because they did not heed
[1:46:32] to the word of the Prophet it's going to
[1:46:35] take more than being a good person it's
[1:46:37] gonna take being on the word it's going
[1:46:41] to take having the baptism that already
[1:46:43] goes it's going to take dying out to
[1:46:47] your whole self to your own wheel it's
[1:46:50] gonna take surrendering you all to
[1:46:52] Almighty God it's gonna take a thirst
[1:46:55] and hunger in your soul cuz he that
[1:46:59] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[1:47:00] shall be filled if you think you're a
[1:47:07] starving man to eat out of a garbage can
[1:47:11] and feel full but there's no nutrients
[1:47:15] to it it's not gonna build anything it's
[1:47:19] not gonna be a sale you're just gonna be
[1:47:24] a weak Christian it's not gonna produce
[1:47:28] what it's supposed to produce let me
[1:47:34] move on Satan truly became the god of
[1:47:38] this world an exact worship that he grew
[1:47:42] to cause them to believe that he was the
[1:47:45] Lord through this polytheistic religion
[1:47:49] of the enemy began with the Trinitarian
[1:47:53] doctrine it was way back there in a
[1:47:57] there where God in three persons the
[1:48:01] idea came into existence how strange
[1:48:05] that our Martin theological ogres have
[1:48:08] not spotted this but evidently they're
[1:48:11] just as do this justice duped by Satan
[1:48:14] as their forebearers is it not strange
[1:48:18] that while the descendants of him went
[1:48:23] on their way in satanic worship involved
[1:48:27] a basic concept of three gods one trace
[1:48:32] of the descendents of sham believing
[1:48:34] such thing
[1:48:36] having any ceremonial worship involved
[1:48:39] even a type of it it is not strange that
[1:48:42] the Hebrew believe here o Israel the
[1:48:45] Lord thy God is one a man
[1:48:48] Bev wit might want to get to a certain
[1:48:50] point and now and we see that Satan amen
[1:49:06] took them a step at a time away from
[1:49:11] truth the evolved concept of deity the
[1:49:17] Eternal Father the spirit incarnate and
[1:49:21] the human mother a devil is not content
[1:49:27] he has to achieve worship for himself
[1:49:30] now he diluted the water he diluted the
[1:49:35] gospel by hitting them off the word
[1:49:37] first with these three gods okay now he
[1:49:41] has to achieve worship for himself
[1:49:43] expect except in a indirect form he has
[1:49:48] it in an indirect form but he want it
[1:49:50] directly he takes the people away from
[1:49:52] the truth still further through his
[1:49:55] mysteries he revealed to the people that
[1:49:59] since the great invisible father God
[1:50:04] does not concern himself in the affairs
[1:50:07] of men but remaining silent relative to
[1:50:12] them then it follows that he may well be
[1:50:18] worshiped in silence see so now what is
[1:50:25] he trying to do they saying that well
[1:50:28] okay we got three gods or three concepts
[1:50:34] of three people in heaven now we going
[1:50:38] to take you a little bit further from
[1:50:40] the truth
[1:50:41] and let you know that well you know God
[1:50:43] is somebody powerful and you can just
[1:50:46] pray in your heart
[1:50:49] you can just worship him silently it's
[1:50:52] an individual thing
[1:50:54] so you just bother throughout halibut
[1:50:59] yeah hallo would be thy name remain
[1:51:02] quietly let's not upset the Holy Ghost
[1:51:07] real quiet when the people of God sing
[1:51:14] praise our God if he can take the
[1:51:20] worship away from God now he can direct
[1:51:25] it towards himself his first plan is to
[1:51:30] get you to not worship God to not
[1:51:35] worship God holy we don't take all of
[1:51:37] that just like I said earlier this is
[1:51:40] the quietest place you've ever gonna be
[1:51:43] the quietest place you've ever gonna be
[1:51:46] he said since it's not necessary to
[1:51:48] worship creator the Father it was only
[1:51:51] natural that the worship swung to the
[1:51:55] mother and the child as the objects of
[1:51:59] adoration sweet baby Jesus ain't no baby
[1:52:09] they got him in the manger steel but
[1:52:13] what he going that's all about it's all
[1:52:16] by design let's look on all about design
[1:52:22] y'all have become a notes all this stuff
[1:52:29] amen
[1:52:30] his whole point amen
[1:52:36] Egypt there was the same combination of
[1:52:40] mother and son call Isis Norton in Oriya
[1:52:45] and in Rome in the Greece it follows
[1:52:49] suit in China same thing it all went to
[1:52:53] the mother and the son amen
[1:52:59] in her arms let me see here most of
[1:53:04] classic writers
[1:53:13] but we want to see want you to see that
[1:53:16] that uh the whole thing he's trying to
[1:53:20] get you to is I'll put it this way my
[1:53:26] wife called me earlier this week and she
[1:53:33] said you know I would just listen to the
[1:53:34] radio and that was a lady on the radio
[1:53:37] preaching and she was just oh man the
[1:53:40] Catholic Church is so long and all they
[1:53:43] decently that not saying wow you know
[1:53:46] she could see all of this about the
[1:53:48] Catholic Church and it called him the
[1:53:51] great woman agree or is pretty amazing
[1:53:57] that they can't see that she has seven
[1:53:58] daughters that they cannot they can see
[1:54:05] the Catholic Church because now like I
[1:54:07] said it is so far off they not even
[1:54:11] confess in the god no more they confess
[1:54:13] it to me
[1:54:15] they go into a rooming our Father well
[1:54:18] I've done this and I've done that got a
[1:54:20] lot a lot around and they feel like
[1:54:21] where they go out little like they want
[1:54:23] a little come back and confess again
[1:54:25] everybody no that's that's ridiculous
[1:54:29] absolutely ridiculous
[1:54:32] how far is off the word but they can't
[1:54:37] see that that same spirit has crept in
[1:54:42] under the form under the cover of
[1:54:46] religion in denominations in
[1:54:50] denominations if
[1:54:56] come out of her my people yeah
[1:55:00] you'll never be Hangul within them see
[1:55:05] the true light of the gospel because
[1:55:07] it's cluttered with all of it garbage in
[1:55:11] the field you wonder well why can't you
[1:55:16] know I try I go to church and I and I
[1:55:20] try to live the best that I can
[1:55:21] I do the best that I can and I just
[1:55:24] failed I just can't come out of her my
[1:55:27] people come to the true light of the
[1:55:31] gospel the system just broken cisterns
[1:55:37] are all full of with the tales and and
[1:55:38] and things you come out and into the
[1:55:41] true light of the gospel we're not
[1:55:44] putting at one time they were truth but
[1:55:48] what happens is they organize and
[1:55:52] instead of following the Holy Spirit
[1:55:56] when Moses came out when he when he when
[1:56:01] he delivered the people out of bondage
[1:56:04] of Egypt and the people followed Moses
[1:56:10] but Moses followed that pillar of fire
[1:56:15] that same vilify that got his attention
[1:56:18] on the mountain and spoke to him I the
[1:56:23] pill if I say I have heard the cry of my
[1:56:28] people what does that tell me dead car
[1:56:35] here's your cry
[1:56:40] don't believe the devil's life when you
[1:56:44] pray pray talk to God never harkening he
[1:56:50] he proves over and over that he hears
[1:56:54] your voice your voice your voice science
[1:56:59] this microphone is amplifying my voice
[1:57:02] right now and carrying it further at the
[1:57:08] day of judgment there will be a
[1:57:14] everything that you've done so as you
[1:57:17] know some people say that they've got my
[1:57:19] father dealing my father was getting
[1:57:22] ready to pass on over he say his life
[1:57:25] came back before him he said he just
[1:57:29] seems they thought they've been able to
[1:57:30] see everything that happened from a
[1:57:32] childhood all the way up it never dies
[1:57:35] it never goes anywhere you think it just
[1:57:38] goes out and falls short that's why you
[1:57:42] got to be careful of what you say
[1:57:44] careful of idol communication but if
[1:57:49] that never dies neither does the praise
[1:57:52] and the worship neither let's praise
[1:57:56] worship and your prayers they go
[1:57:59] straight to the heart ago you want to be
[1:58:03] you if you get tired of playing Church
[1:58:09] sin such hypocrisy at every turn and
[1:58:14] it's gotten you to a point to where you
[1:58:16] say that's just is there a god anymore
[1:58:23] we see where things have degraded to in
[1:58:29] the lie in mankind we've been here
[1:58:32] before and it's said he said it i repent
[1:58:36] that I even made man do you think we've
[1:58:40] got there again look around
[1:58:45] a blind man could see that but this
[1:58:50] shall be like in the meantime there will
[1:58:56] be a bride without a spot or wrinkle
[1:59:01] that would manifest the fullness of God
[1:59:08] in flesh not some angelic being in flesh
[1:59:15] and we will have fellowship with him
[1:59:18] again just like he intended for it to be
[1:59:21] before sin came into the picture but
[1:59:27] will be better than because we know
[1:59:29] where we came from we will realize that
[1:59:32] it was the love of Almighty God just
[1:59:36] like I said earlier when I started he
[1:59:38] knew that it took death for the
[1:59:41] atonement of that sin they so sig fig
[1:59:44] leaves know and after the blood of that
[1:59:47] man I'm still dripping down the back of
[1:59:49] his leg we had a savior they committed
[1:59:55] him to death they put him on this white
[1:59:59] outfit robe and they began to beat him
[2:00:05] he said then it started out as a little
[2:00:08] blood spot on the back of that road and
[2:00:11] as he went to through the crowd they
[2:00:15] shove thorns in his head now a man of
[2:00:22] sorrows and acquainted with grief had
[2:00:25] done nothing wrong
[2:00:26] he was that spotless lamb from the
[2:00:34] throne of Almighty God came to reconcile
[2:00:36] us back to where we had lost that
[2:00:40] position to where we have pure
[2:00:42] fellowship with him and that lamb skin
[2:00:48] that he had put on Adam and Eve as they
[2:00:53] walk thinking on the kill
[2:00:57] of what they had done all of a sudden
[2:01:01] the animals wasn't their friends anymore
[2:01:08] it was a little bit tougher to find food
[2:01:14] everything was provided for him it was
[2:01:17] just a beautiful place and they would go
[2:01:20] and sit and just talk with God and have
[2:01:22] a wonderful evening
[2:01:24] but then after all of that ended they
[2:01:26] had to put on this cut skin realized
[2:01:31] that this lamb died for them and the
[2:01:34] blood running down their leg and our
[2:01:37] Father Christ bleeding
[2:01:41] bloody carrying his cross to Calvary the
[2:01:49] blood running down the back of his leg
[2:01:52] as he's bearing all of our sins upon
[2:01:55] himself reconciling us back to where we
[2:02:01] came from hung on that cross he had the
[2:02:07] power to come down as I said before we
[2:02:12] go through this life and through our
[2:02:15] day-to-day tasks not realizing that we
[2:02:18] travel with an entourage of bodyguards
[2:02:20] angelic bodyguards all around us imagine
[2:02:25] the hosts of angelic bodyguards around
[2:02:27] them all you had to do was say one word
[2:02:30] and it would have killed every soldier
[2:02:32] around but he said not a mumbling word
[2:02:39] because he had to bear our sins that
[2:02:44] sacrifice why so that Isaac can be
[2:02:50] produced again so that the promise can
[2:02:54] come forth again in this hour
[2:02:57] he wasn't looking at those people of
[2:03:00] that day when he hung on that cross
[2:03:04] those people were there you know who he
[2:03:07] was thinking about
[2:03:09] that group way down in the 20th century
[2:03:13] where all of the scene is gonna consist
[2:03:16] up into this one time they're gonna need
[2:03:19] this they're gonna need this blood to
[2:03:24] keep them how sad would it be to reject
[2:03:31] such a greater sacrifice such a greater
[2:03:37] sacrifice it's a trick that a enemy to
[2:03:43] try to give us off the word all those
[2:03:48] that hunger and thirst after
[2:03:50] righteousness shall be fear are you
[2:03:57] hungry

[2:05:21] me musicians come a man you know we've
[2:05:29] come a long way I couldn't remember a
[2:05:34] man I was a young lad going to church
[2:05:37] with my grandmother and as a young man
[2:05:46] had experience with God I used to have
[2:05:52] asthma real bad
[2:05:54] my parents to tell it a state in and out
[2:05:57] of the hospital but I would go to church
[2:06:01] grandmother was taken to the church in

[2:06:04] line and my mother my grandmother didn't
[2:06:08] have to ask me you want to get in the
[2:06:09] prayer line she didn't have to ask me I
[2:06:12] was maybe 7 8 years old and I would go
[2:06:16] up and get in the prayer line and
[2:06:18] believing that I would not have to go to
[2:06:20] the hospital no more believing at that
[2:06:25] age that I wouldn't have to go to the
[2:06:26] hospital no more I knew then that God
[2:06:29] was real and I'm sure at some point in
[2:06:33] your life you know you know God is real
[2:06:36] but through the deceit of man through
[2:06:40] the failures of man through the trickery
