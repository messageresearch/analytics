to be in the house of the Lord a man on this Saturday morning weekend want to thank everybody to attend on last night and the banquet we really enjoyed ourselves thank God for all things [Music] certainly before the banquet you know that I've heard about so many different trials that Saints went through a man to get there and one of my brothers they have spoke for the air in the address in the GPS after they got from the airport and it took them to a whole lot of city hours away and I saw delay them all gonna get here and I say well what God is God is still God and now and then brother Jerry last night he spoke in there for the Jerry's Russian to get there to the to the to the banquet but is key on top of its car and you know the end of the story and we went looking all last night trust try to find that key you know and though we just produced live it in the hands of the Lord and and you know the devil just fighting everybody everybody and any time I see him fighting like that I know he must know that God got some [Applause] [Music] and since we made it here we have proved that we are more than over cameras what was that for the Sam say we look at problems as a opportunity for testimony [Music] man I like that Isaac we appreciate you all these brothers they've been and how they just shared with us so last night and just just just just a wonderful wonderful atmosphere as we just prepare to turn a mental order of the service I wanted to just kind of share just a quick quote with you and also before I do that brother what's gotten into me this morning that that sister wesco wasn't feeling well and we want to pray for sister wesco and then we want to pray for her that go to devil can attack him and I even brother Danny it's kind of going through something but devil attacking him to his body so we we just we just say the devil's a lie and we impress through this but it may let's just Bauer is it was just awful word of Prayer for our precious sister father we've become in the name of the Lord Jesus on behalf of Russia's sister West going God we're asking that you would touch her you know the condition the devil is attacking but you have a great position that God you are currently present accident you would touch her and that you would lay your hands on earth oh god the blood that flowed from Calvary that brings salvation to our souls is the same blood that flows healing top bodies so father we pray that you would just let her leave here different from the week she came and father may she be careful to give you the border there's anybody else here that is going through anything and everybody we by name they giving me right now and we pray that the Spirit of God would touch your feet the Lord he'll set free and deliver goddess I'm here we can fit it all into your hands some Jesus name we pray a Manny Manny Manny man we call it under Jesus name praise the Lord so just quickly in have a speaker come but for I mentioned last night and we'll read this quote a man again and then I got another one I want to read to you about light the fire again started this I want to say a few years ago the Lord just kind of put a little sermon in her and her spirits and we just been really flowing with this brother branham makes this statement here in the exposition of the seven church ages says now history keeps repeating itself says in the generations of Israel we see revival in one generation only to see the fires in the necks says in the third-generation embers maybe glowing slightly who says but in the fourth maybe no vestige whatsoever of that original flame and we see how the devil should spend really just attacking people left and right this that would even criticize whether God sent a prophet or whether brother Branham was the Prophet this port is actually fulfilling what they're safe [Music] right in the fourth generation this is where these things came out and you know when we look at women tweet last night we count from a property you count brother branham then you count a son then you count grandchildren you count to where we are right now it's it's we're in the fourth generation stage where where it's clear it's clear that no vestige of the original flame no vestige of the original flame however I'm so grateful that the quote goes on to say then God lights the fire again and this is what we're looking for this is what we're under expectation is God what light the fire again I don't want it just to be meetings Amen that we just came to some more meetings I want to see God do something at some pie a man if if there was a time that you need you used to be able to see this word I won't dr. Amen I'm not just seeing again hallelujah I want him to restore the side of the blind because it's one thing to be physically blind but it's a much worse day to be spiritually blind hallelujah he's come the noise in his tongue to restore sign again the anointing has come to set the captive free the anointing has come to make the difference then God likes the fire again in the same process is repeated December the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth any more than is there any truth to apostolic succession so we're under expectation you know it was a fourth generation and Moses Dave's that third and fourth generation was the ones that went into the Promised Land amen it was that Generation X experience I'm said they saw their their their parents kind of died out in the wilderness ooh but it was them that went into that promise so church they meant among expectation of God gonna do some specialist generation and I'm gonna be holding with my eyes glory to God this is just another cool I want to read a man from the message then Jesus came and called the date is 64 - 0 for 1 7 I don't have the paragraph number but this in this one of the reasons why we have meetings was the purpose of it the Prophet says now that book holds her name since that book holds her name and and and and brother Sam was talking about that redemption you know last night that book holds her name he came to redeem whose names was on that book I want it I got good news for you if your name was on that bull hey man you got to speak back to the devil can do to take your name off that hook I want to say that if your name was on that book ain't nothing that devil can do to take your name off that book hallelujah he come to redeem whose names was on that book redeem means bring back from where it fell from if there's anybody unfeeling for falling from somewhere and God it's this weekend we expecting God to bring you back from where you fail from look he goes on to say this he says and in the human race she when she was filmed and she can't accept it now she's too young so the church was slugged right alone just play alone we'll have meetings and so forth till that last person is brought in then that book is closed there's no more added then it's all over well maybe this could be the last week if the last person comes in a man if they don't come with have another meeting but we're looking for that last one to come in and my prayers even so come Lord Jesus hallelujah Church we're here under expectation just believing God to meet us in a very special way the Lord has just laid it in my heart to have my brother Danny steamin a man come and minister for us and and I'm so grateful he's a dear friend of mine we connect in many areas amen in ministry outside of ministry and it's just been a real dear friend of mine and you know it's been a while since we've had brother Steven come ease and many of the brothers from his churches help carry this church times that I would the Lord would call me out and I were traveling I'd be able to lean on sister Church in Sarasota by 3 hours driving away you know west of us and they would just come in and just just hold the church down I'm so grateful for friends like that I'm so grateful hey man and so we've used a lot of the brothers in his church but this I've just been waiting and waiting in last year he came and you know supported the services and I'm like this year I knew we'd do something a little different and and I reached out some say brother Danny would you be able to speak for us hey man this year and I serves he said sure I'll be glad to do it so I'm so happy to have him thank God for his precious wife a man some of the Saints for his church are here with us and I went under expectation this morning a man forgot to move in this place let's stand to our feet let's welcome God serving a man to the pulpit this morning a man hallelujah every hand lifted every eye closed you are great you do miracles so great say you are great [Music] he recalls so great there is go one else No come on everybody say [Music] [Music] for you [Music] [Music] a man honey see that's a truth there's none like You mr. big you could be seated for a moment I just wanted to take this opportunity to say what a privilege it is to be able to be here and be a part of this meeting amen all the things that brother Jack said well we just repeat them right back to him brother Jack has been a just a wonderful friend sister Erica and their family have been such a blessing to our church and encouragement to us I like to say that his brother Jack and I have a lot in common that we both turn in our 50th year within the number of months of each other we both had our first grandchild within about a month or a few weeks of each other we both started our singing careers at the same time hey man I don't know why you're laughing I mean the Lord asked Jill where were you a man when the sons of God shouted for joy and the morning stars sang together so I had a singing career I might have left it there but I'll pick it up again a man raised the Lord so a man so thank you brother Jack we love you and appreciate you and your family your church and just a real privilege to be here and we're looking forward to all that the Lord will do amen looking forward to here brother Aaron he was saying last night it's been eight years since he's been to our place and I just took me back and just time has moved so fast and and that that's not good in that sense it's good we're going home but so we're certainly looking forward to here your brother Aaron and I certainly enjoyed the banquet last night The ministers that spoke bless you I trust you're all here I trust you is here 30 minutes early amen and is ready for the service amen it made you feel better I wasn't here 30 minutes early either but amen God is good and I I would be remiss if I didn't mention this as well as we also agreed to all the other ministers and pastors here god bless you but I wanted to say today's a special day for me where the Bible says whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth favor of the Lord and today is my wife and me of course our 28th anniversary thank the Lord for Michelle and then like the Lord has used her for to help me and a real help mate a man to raise our children and the fear and admonition of the Lord and they're serving the Lord today that that's money that's wealth not your bank account it's what God has put in us amen so praise the Lord and so we thank the Lord for that and I I since brother Jack had asked us to preach to just one thought it just kept coming to me someone a minister on this with the help of the Lord and we're going to title these service the opportunities of godly Dominion the opportunities of godly Dominion and let's all stand together and bow our heads for a word of Prayer Lord Jesus it's our turn now to come and stand in the pulpit and to open the Bible how often have we heard brother Branham say any man can open the Bible but it takes you to open the word to us we would ask you Lord that you would come in a special way Lord that you would use this meeting to encourage to bring strength to the feeble Lord to bring understanding Lord it's your desire that we would understand you and understand the things of God Lord not just not just in a way of an intellectual conception but a revelation that the enemy cannot prevail over may you help me Lord get myself out of the way my lips Lord we believe these meetings are not just put together with the mind of man but by the burden of God the leadership of the Holy Spirit for sons of God are led by the Spirit of God have your way father Hill is sick among us Lord and encourage each one and have your way in the hearing and reading of the word in Jesus name amen amen y'all bless you let's turn in our Bibles to the book of Ecclesiastes the eighth chapter amen the eighth chapter my brother Branham had said that when he was asked the question about his ministry wouldn't your name be in the Bible brother Branham said that you wouldn't necessarily have to have your name in the Bible but as long as you are in the Bible and you can see yourself in Jesus Christ you see yourself in your full position seeing yourself in him is seeing yourself in your full position when you're in him so how important it is for us to see Christ and to see ourself identified through him amen Ecclesiastes 8 4 where the word of a king is there is power and who may say unto Him what doest thou whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing in a wise man's heart discern ahthe both time and judgment because to every purpose there is time and judgment therefore the misery of man is great upon him you can be seated may the Lord bless arena of his word amen the opportunities of godly Dominion that word power where it says where the word of a king is there is power that word power means mastery there's a mastery of the situation it means having power over it means where the word of a king is there is legitimate Authority not just a say-so Authority or I'm in the message authority it's actually legal authority that would stand up not just in the courts of law but in the courts of heaven that's legitimate Authority it means one who has dominion over another it can be used to mean powerful as in the words of a king that are described as being supreme so we know Amen the Word of God is supreme how many say man not my word not your word his word his word is supreme now amen his word is supreme authority and Satan fights that authority of the word because he knows there's nothing of such prevailing power as revelation in that word right I love the statement that brother Branham made he said that God never told a man to labor thirty years and harvest nothing God never caught a preacher for them to just stand behind the pulpit and have nothing to follow it you say man hey man I took courage in that when I passed my 30th year in ministry to know that God is faithful for all those years that he never called me to preach amen it just be a sounding symbol but he said he gave us an open door of Word and power that we are to use now every one of you have been given an open door in that open door of the word and that is our opportunity we have an opportunity given to us by the work it's not good enough for me to stand and say hey you know I'm in the bride and I know what H I'm in because the Prophet told me that's not the manifestation the manifestation is when that time and that purpose begins to live in your hearts praise the name of the Lord now we have the examples in Scripture brother Branham said about Adam and Eve all they had was just a few words that they had to keep and they couldn't keep them right and what did a man who was given dominion over all the earth what did he do with that Dominion he turned an Eden into a waste howling desert he turned what God had given him something beautiful something good a relationship a Dominion a discernment he turns all of that into a desert because of choice he already had the position but because of choice he walked away and turned it into a desert why he left the word it's how he handled the message of his day that caused corruption God never asked him to change the message he asked him to cultivate it put an atmosphere around it that the seed will bring out exactly what he said so now here's what brother Adam said I'm just trying to say a few things here oh I forgot to start my watch I don't want to go for hours but maybe three and a half amen amen but now it's how he handled the message of his day now in saying this brother Branham said in fundamental foundation of faith he said the power that he was given he was a secondary God on earth right Adam is secondary God he was not the God he was secondary God but was offered a God positioned by Satan right now he was secondary God he was given power to control all things all elements of the earth you understand he was given power and then he couldn't boast in it he was given it man what you have is given to you that's the grace of God if you're not entitled he gave it to you with that giving there should be a Grace and a humility to say it's you not me and so now he said that was Adam to control all the elements of the earth one of the brothers spoke last night about the atmosphere the elements of the earth Adam had that given those powers but then he said the power he was given to make his own self is where he fell he fell in the power that he had to make his own self to be what God had called him to be you see Adam never came to where God had called him to be he was given the position but he fell because he didn't bring forth everything that God had required of him praise the Lord now we thank the Lord for the change of covenant where it was if you do this I'll do that but then God changed it and told Abraham it's not what you do but it's what I do right amen but notice this because brother branham is very brother ben was very clear in saying these things he said that power without character is satanic so what is Satan gonna attack he's going to attack what makes the character of the church power without character sect in fact he said characters of victory not a gift right so a man without character cannot rain no matter how much he wants to no matter how many quotes he reads no matter how much he dominates the people amen he cannot rain without character because power apart from character is satanic but power with characters fit to rule so where the word of a king is there is power brother branham preface that by saying that it's the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us so the little temporary suffering that we go through is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed on us when he comes right so what is suffering suffering is not just losing your job suffering is not just getting sick there are material things in fact this age is more material than it is spiritual and I'm saying age I'm talking about people that claim to know God well I lost my car I must be getting tested let me tell you the world gets tested in that the world gets cancer as well come on search the world loses their jobs too when you go through depression they go through depression when you go through a recession they go through a recession but you're a believer you don't go through it the same way they go through it but what is the testing then the testing is a man when God tests you with the word and you believe my words then you stand up on my word and you stay with my word change it God never asked you to it he never asked you to take from it he never asked you to embellish brother Branham he asked you to cultivate it stay with him so that the word will bring forth exactly what it said the Prophet said stay with the word so that the spirit of the word will be upon the people let me just say it right now I don't have to impress you by acting like another preacher I don't have to throw my hands out and have a mannerism to impress you or to say a buzzword that'll get you going no but if I stay with the word the Holy Spirit is upon you will bring forth exactly what he said it [Applause] that should be the name of the well I'm glad there's young preachers coming up brother Aaron when I fall apart in five minutes you just come right here and help me so let me just say a couple things brother Branham said here he said in prayer and how can I overcome the message how can overcome which which incidentally my father was at that meeting he wasn't a believer only service my dad was ever at was how can I overcome he slept through the whole thing so hey man everything there's a purpose and a time now he said Lord we're standing here trying to take your word and explain it to the people how to overcome you told us how it's done you didn't only tell us but you showed us you let us you showed us how to do it you showed us receive the word inside of us and be sure to hold to that word it is written in every temptation but be humble and walk humbly then we have conquered through you through your power which has already conquered our enemy and the only thing we have to do is walk humble with faith believing that in our badge of identification of the Holy Ghost and Satan has to move again he said in a man running from the presence of the Lord he said may all the great mysteries how many believe the mysteries have been unveiled now it's not a minister's job to make him more mysterious alright he said may all the great mysteries that we're supposed to know at this age be unveiled to us Lord and will see the plainness of God so that we'll know how to behave ourselves an act and correct ourselves and bring the members of our body into discipline to the word that we might know how to live in this present day at the approaching all the Lord Jesus you mean the mysteries were supposed to come so that I could know how to live man's made to rule but he's made to rule by the Word of God so then again he said in the Laodicean Church age he says now we came naked physically into the world but naked we won't go out there's only one thing we're take with us and that is our character then he goes on to call this age a character less age if we ever had an age where everything is blended together and there's no character there's no character of man there's no character of woman there's no character of goodness hey man if you want to be a girl you can be a girl if you want to be a boy you can be a boy you can be trans you can be whatever you want to be you can marry a box you can marry a desk you can marry a cat and that's the truth I'm not even joking that's the age we live in character less but it's in that most evil age why did God pull a bride in the most evil age he called a bride dare to prove to Satan that this woman would not be like the first one but this woman would stand upon the word through the test of the word and believe it still laying a foundation here again he said in Satan's Eden as a businessman that's not a Christian now Satan's calling I'm in risk use me brother man was calling Satan a businessman and he tells he there he said as a businessman that's not a Christian here work every scheme he can to make you see something the wrong way so Satan's in the business of making you look at the word the wrong way why because the word produces character hey man again he goes on to say if he's got a purpose and a personal gain and make you doing that making you see it that way he'll show you everything he can and keep you off from the truth of it because he's only got a feeling for himself and then he goes on to saying that's why Satan has done this and he's worked through the ministry the ministry to do what to try to get the people to see something the wrong way now you forgive me you have to go ahead and forgive me right off the front ok so again why would God call a people in this most evil age now what did God call this age - a prophet of God he called it harvest time they ought to see an ageist harvest time that's what he said in resume of the age it's harvest time the gathering together of the tares and of the wheat he called it harvest time he called it the rapture in time he called it the wheat time he caught it the bride aged why it's the age of maturity it's the age when the word has gone back looking like the first one it's the age Amen where the prophet of God was successful Malachi for turning the hearts of the people back to the original faith again that's the age that we live in can you say man so then brother branham said in this age that the bride will be tried by the words so now you see everything Satan can throw brother Jack every doctor and every man everything he can throw in this age is God allowing it it's not a tragedy when your church gets split by false doctrine it's God allowing it because he is trying to people God would rather have two people believe the word and 500 people that don't God would rather have one that stands on a word and 5000 that act like another preacher come on somebody help me with one man God can take one man and take a dominant super force and bring for nothing one man was a beard in 80 years old walked down to Egypt and said let my people go [Applause] praise the Lord so I'll start this meeting this service by saying this what would cause a revival to die out tell you what would cause a revival to die out says when man leave the world what's God has never left his people [Applause] let's take my opening scripture now first Kings 11 yeah please thank you the opportunities of godly Dominion first Kings 11:28 I'm going to talk to you for the this time the Ranger of this time on this man by the name of Jeroboam helm he's ever heard of him the Bible says he was a mighty man of Valor in Solomon's scene the young man that he was industrious he's creative he's gifted he made him rule over all the charge of the house of Joseph it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem now now watch for a minute man jerub-baal thank you brother Jack Jeroboam not to be bossy but can you open it Ilia thank you Jeroboam is given a position he's gifted he's given a position by the church though that the church can look at him and see this man's gifted he can help the people he's industrious and the king himself list him to this position being tests being over the house of Joseph it was told of of Jeroboam that Jeroboam is the one that completed the walls of Jerusalem at that time and it came to pass at that time now it's not only he's caught the eye of man he's caught the eye of God at that time when Jeroboam when I'm Jerusalem the prophet Elijah the shillin I found him in the way and he had clad himself with a new garment and they were alone in the field and not the way God does to you then look you may be put in somewhere by a man but then God gets ahold of you here Bowie to the side by yourself and the world of a prophet comes to you by yourself because that's how he works with individuals and he begins to reveal to him now Solomon didn't hear this it was Jeroboam that was hearing this a word of the Prophet now you know what that has put everyone of us on the level playing field here this morning we have all heard the word of a prophet and hopefully not just corporately but we're hearing it individually and they caught the new garment a highs across the new garments on him in here in it in 12 pieces and he said to Jeroboam take the 10 pieces for thus saith the Lord the god I hear Israel behold I will wring the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give ten tribes to thee power but he Solomon shall have one to try for my servant David sake and for Jerusalem's sake the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel because that they have forsaken me your revivals died out they have forsaken me and have worship asteroth the goddess of the sidonians and k-much the god of the mall bites of Malcolm the God of the children of Ammon and have not walked in my ways to do that which is right in my eyes and to keep my statutes and my judgment as did David his father I'll be it I'll not take the whole kingdom out of his hand but I'll make him Prince all the days of his life for David my servants sake whom I chose because he kept my Commandments and my statues now what generation are they in brother and sister we've heard two quotes a brother Jack that he gave this is the third generation REO bulma's they're fixing to come out of Solomon right this is the third generation from David amen in the years he said now he said but I'll take the kingdom out of his son's hand out of Solomon's hand the third generation I'll give it unto you ten tribes and unto his son I'll give one tribe that David my servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem this is important in Jerusalem the city which I have chosen me to put my name there then God said where I put my name you're not going to change and I'll take you I will take you and you will reign according to all that your soul desires you know that God is here this morning to release into you all that you desire in him God will give you your souls desire that's not my word that's the word of the Prophet a man and he says and if thou shalt be if you will hearken unto all that I command thee and will walk in my way and do what is right my sight to keep my statutes and my Commandments as David my servant did and I will be with you and build the assur house as I built for David and will give Israel unto thee now God is not a man that he should lie he meant exactly what he said that if you follow my word I'll make your house sure and I'll give Israel to you I'm giving you ten tribes now but if you follow me I'll do more I'll prosper your house it'll be like a sure house of David what was in the house of David Heyman there was great victory in the house of David Giants were killed repentance was in his house man and David himself didn't even have to get all the glory when he found out he couldn't build the tabernacle he went up and laid up treasures for it so that the coming generation could go out and it could be built in there let me tell you this is not about all of us preachers it's about the word o'clock going out so that the next generation can rise up in faith and know they are in the world there's no big eyes or little use in here hey man and I will for this afflict the seat of David what is he going to afflict the seat of David for the houses of Devils they built amen afflict them because they left the word but I will not forever grace marvelous grace now watch this is very interesting Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam into something that as soon as the word comes to you you're a target here's a man that's hurdle it to ear from Gaea from God and God as has given him wisdom like no other King but that man now tuck the same spirit that Saul had because spirits don't die and he tries to kill one God as anointing and he said Solomon salt therefore to kill Jeroboam and here's where Jeroboam made a great mistake he has the word of the Lord and he arose and fled into Egypt there's always somebody going to give you a refuge outside of the word you can always find a pulpit to preach in that will compromise there's always gonna be somebody outside of the word that'll be your friend all you gotta do is post it on Instagram or social media you'll have a sympathizing spirit out there that'll sympathize with your affliction but if you're a believer if Jeroboam would have just stayed with the word he did not have to go down to Egypt you have to go to the world to find your resource even we have a source this morning there is a fountain open in the house of the Kings after him whether one of the King is her father there's a greater king that is given him his word and where the king is there is power who you want to believe an earthly king or the heavenly king the earthly king wants to kill you the heavenly King says I'll make your house sure he's not gonna lie well God saw it will kill me if I stay here but I'm the power of Resurrection I'll raise you up again you just stay with my word even if it meets your life so he takes refuge in Egypt he went to the wrong place in this crisis you always to tell you about the character of people what they do in a time of crisis where they go find out the challenge of a pastor brother Jack is as you can't judge the situation by the emotion and everybody wants to judge it emotion you got a judgment by the word if you want to come out live you got to judge it by the word but everybody else they want to judge it by emotion you know the young people I don't have no friends my friends went to the world while they're cutting their hair why can't I cut my hair they're doing this why can't I do that they're doing it that's emotion where's the word and if we have a sure message it's different brother banners message this is not currently devised fables this is not a Mormon Bible this is not another message outside of the Bible come on churches here's the Bible he's talking in the office back there and I had I had a sister I had a woman excuse me come to the church and she she was had hair up to here and she was sitting in sitting in the in the churches she began to read a track that we had out there in a vestibule the original sin and says he got so angry at reading that that she jumped up and ran out of the church I used that met you that bent our church you know where in the country we're way out in the middle of nowhere she disappeared off the ground so you ran so we had deacons going up and down the road looking for her and there was a there was a lane across the street said no trespassing of course that's where she was a man she was way up that road and sitting on somebody's house and porch and so I went up there and I found her sitting there and I and I said I started out by calling her sister which was the wrong thing to do because that made her angrier said I'm not your sister don't call me that so I so I start calling her ma'am I said let's go this is no this is private property let's just go back and talk about what's troubling you she goes well I'll tell you what's troubling me says is your your church is a cult they're in a cult and your people need to be helped and they need to be exposed to realize here they're just following a man and in a cult and I said well let's go back here and talk about we're still trespassing and so thus we begin to walk back to the church and and she put her hand up when it came and said Oh God deliver those people bring him out of their bondage so forth she's praying like and I says ma'am I said you know what my daddy was just like you he hated the message he said her brother bamps in heaven I don't want to go she goes bless his heart and I said yeah and he's the one that built that church [Applause] hallelujah amen that's why you get angry about it if it's an honest anger God will it God will come in and here show you if you're really sincere so I would took her out under the pavilion here so let's just sit down and talk and she goes well you guys are wrong about cut here let's talk about the Bible let's let's talk about 1st Corinthians 11 I said okay no problem it doesn't mean what you guys say it means she began to quote man and books and terminologies at brother Aaron I'm not even sure if you would understood even though you're a lawyer you might I might have needed you there so you could have said but I told her I says ma'am that word is not in the Bible that's it let's bring it back to the Bible so she kept quoting men and I kept quoting the Bible she quoted another thing and I quoted a Bible she got mad again she jumped up out of her chair and says I know where you're getting that I said well where am I getting I'm just quoting the Bible she goes you're getting that from William Branham I says ma'am that you're not my sister ma'am you have just gave William Branham the greatest compliment you could I have not stopped quoting the scripture you have quoted denominations you've quoted men but a prophet will always take it back to the word amen brother and sister the message we have is not built upon sand it's built upon a solid rock the rock of salvation the rock of Revelation and the gates of Hell will not prevail it's not an organization we're not in an organization we're not in the denomination it's men that's done that we got word from heaven heaven the reason it's called the message the message is not an unbiblical term it's not the right for turn brother Darrin you you're more grammatically correct than I am amen what did I just say unbiblical yes it's not an unbiblical term a man John wrote in the end of and in his books he said this then is the message that you have heard why the message brother branham said is the current word amen being brought to pass the current promise being brought to pass it is not a william branham terminology it is a God terminology [Applause] and man has no copyright over God why because the world is meant to quicken his seed and his seed is his not man [Music] let's look at jeroboams just a moment let's take your study the opportunity of godly Dominion the Jews say that the name of Jeroboam means if you look it up his meaning me his mean name spear yes then that great I'm gonna start a new language right here in the public amen Jeroboam means the people contend so the Jews say it means it means that his want his name means one that cause strife between the people and their heavenly Father a man who calls strife between the people and their heavenly Father now the opportunity that he has to walk with the world the word that when it came to him he was a servant but it lists him from servant to king only a king can do that only a king can make a servant a king and you also were servants to sing but he hath made us kings only a king can make you a king and he's been made a king if he will walk with the Lord every one of you had that same opportunity this morning the opportunity of revival we just read to you the opportunities that were just described in God was there to give him the desires of his heart but there is a test that comes with that word and that is can you stay with the word there is a consequence of turning from the word he already has a word of a profit that prophesizes Dominion God wants him to rule in godly Dominion so as the scripture says he's a mighty man of Valor scripture says he's industrious he's a gifted man and where there is a man with the gift Satan is there to try and deceive that man so that that gift itself will become a stumbling place to the people right so as soon as the word comes to Jeroboam Solomon tries to kill him just like Amen as the word comes to you Satan will try to take away the desire you have in him and make it about you now let's read another scripture this is this is jumping over a lot of history but we're going to go back through it and you just you just just bear with me if we don't finish it all this morning we're finish it tomorrow morning and the 20th verse of 2nd King 17 we haven't read yet what Jeroboam did but we're going to show you the results of what he did and the Lord rejected all the seed of Israel and afflicted him and delivered them into the hand of spoilers until he had cast them out of his sight for he rent Israel from the house of David and they made Jeroboam the son of the bat King and Jeroboam drove Israel from following the Lord he drove his row from following the Lord and made them sinned a great sin for the children I listen to st. all gonna be depressing this morning alright this is a man's opportunity for the children of Israel walked in all the sins of jeroboam what you did there had to be a man show them how to walk in sand ah but to them it wasn't sin to them it was God so the children of Israel walked in all the sins of jeroboam which he did and they departed not from them until now watch until the Lord removed Israel out of his sight as he had said by all his servants of prophets so was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day so what is it about this man Jeroboam Jeroboam inaugurates the policy that Israel's going to follow there has to be an idolaters before there's an idolatry okay there has to be something in a man's heart before there's the act that comes forth the sin does not force itself into Israel it's introduced by a king sin is introduced by a man in power and it's up to the people to believe it opportunity now let's just let's just just just give you a preference yeah 16 if you read the northern kingdoms of Israel there was 19 kings in Israel and Northern Kingdom and 16 of them follow Jeroboam 16 out of 19 followed the sin a Jeroboam 16 of 19 hundreds of years after Jeroboam as spirit was still there so now look at the opportunity given to him I want to drive that home God has given him his heart's desire in the word and in his house this would not only mean Amen himself it would mean his children God is here not just to save you he's here to save your children for this promises unto you and unto your children brother Branham said your attitude you take to Christ will have a great effect on your children so watch what he said now amen I promise you a sure house if you stay with the word so what is Jeroboam offered he's offered a revival I'll give you a revival with God what other what other revival do you want he offered him the flame of God he offered him an established house of God the potential that laid in that land to follow God would be generational generational but Garibaldi never loved what God had told him when God opened the word to him he just never loved it so let's look for a moment at the spirits that get involved in the downfall of this man we'll see spirits don't die they're still here in this age still making men in power take away from the word or turn away from the opportunity have we ever had an age you just excuse me we ever had an age where we've seen men making themselves God more than this age in the message men making themself God men receiving worship as God have we ever seen it happen and where did it come from it was introduced by men in power through doctrine you just forget me I'm not going to be an evangelist this morning amen brother Branham said I might drop a little something here now we're of the people that still believe and and just let you know brother Bantam said and the layout of see nature could be the resume age a resume of the ages you know that is we get a little older brothers all you older brothers sympathize with me some things blur event even your eyes and and and and so brother venom said that there's art there's has to be teachers to bring the tears to have maturity but who did God give to bring the wheat to maturity brother Branham says that God gave Malachi for to bring the wheat to maturity so if I preach what Malachi for priests I'm not preaching my own message this morning I'm preaching of indicated divinely vindicated full message from the throne of God that matures the people of God not by my might not by my power but by his spirit saith the Lord [Applause] lelou you now he said he said now the two spirits Matthew 24 he said the two spirits in this last day would be so close it would to see the very elect if it possible now I said if you look at right hand and a left hand they both got thumbs they got fingers they got nails they got small fingers middle fingers index all different fingers and they're both thumb prints only one just turn one way and one the other but they're both the same they're made the same the thumb prints everything is identically alike the only difference is the characteristic of it one thumb turns in this some turns in so they're not turning the same way the only difference is the characteristic they look the same the only difference is the characteristic ones left ones right that's the only difference and that's the way the spirits will be in the last day they look just exactly the same but only the characteristic is different one of them will be right yeah they will be wrong you're only known by the characteristic of God just perfectly amen so the only way you can know it is by characteristics that's in the message God is in I'd buy his characteristics 1964 March 11th now david told us in the book of psalms he said that god refused the tabernacle of joseph and he chose not the tribe of ephraim oh who came out of the tribe of ephraim Jeroboam but he would have he would have took him but he chose and where was he from in Ephraim was Shiloh and in Shiloh where the tabernacle was at first you know into something that people that think they have the message first think that they have the right to the entire message and it's where Shiloh was was in ephraim and we say well in my tribe was Joshua who did you have in yours well and so but he said I chose the tribe of Judah to the Mount Zion which he loved so now we don't think of spirits as opinions and so forth but that's how they present themselves their present themselves as spirits or present themselves in attitudes that present themselves an idea in ideas and brother Graham said Satan see he said right here at this last age he said all the deceit intact to every tactic to Satan has ever used and been successful with to deceive with he's gathered it all together and reinforced himself and he came down like God now what did I just say little bit ago that people were making himself God you see now there's a fine line to be in God and being identified in him there's a fine line to saying I am God or saying she is him power of his power life of his life come on there's a fine line between I'm him or I'm God you see because there's another spirit coming down through the ages and it's called that Catholic spirit where they put the woman before the man a man they put the lowman as the intercessor instead of the man as the intercessor there's a fine line between you being the judge and the Holy Spirit in you judging right I hope this is a revival hey man brother Ram said there's three powers that Satan attacks with three powers are making the devil that's political power religious power demon powers they all mix together Satan's the king of politics I'm sorry sorry if that offended you here on the East Coast but he is still the king of politics don't try it out with him see now fourth generation we all just become political hey man now we're gonna learn a lesson here from two kings King Jeroboam and King ray of bone what God offered to Jeroboam when Israel was divided he offered him a house like he built David I'll be with you this is the offering he gave him but the lesson here is immediately after the word comes to Jeroboam the test comes from a man in power he runs to Egypt there he's corrupted because he's given a wife in Egypt if we get entangled in a relationship in the wrong place then we're going to try to bring it back to God's promised land and he said but she's so beautiful brother Danny but yeah but it said the king gave the Pharaoh gave this woman to Jeroboam you know not only does God show you you have potential but Satan recognizes your potential if I can just Wed you off to something a little bit off it'll affect your worship it affect everything you do it affect the way you walk it affect the way you filter low how many of us if we started out in the wrong place in the message listen we've all been there brother Jack we're false doctor tries to come through what does false doctrine do it becomes our filter it's how we think about any quote any scripture we think well what is so and so think about that and so we raise up apostles and somehow apostles become above the Prophet and we didn't realize we just got given a life we got a wife that's gonna help you how to think the opportunity the opportunity of godly Dominion hey there's only one way any of us can be cleaning this higher if we are the children of God we gotta be like Aaron and his sons we gotta be taken by the Prophet before the congregation and watched in the prophetic word washed of your ideas washed of your opinions washed of the way you think the message is let God wash you that's not the way my culture teaches away with your culture away with your countries we come from a heavenly country my this world it's not my home I'm just a passing through brother we're not from Malawi or Haiti a Minar America we're from heaven my Sartre from heaven my walk is from heaven my talk is from heaven we're not from South Carolina were from glory [Applause] you're not even from Zimbabwe I know you're confused but we are not hallelujah were from glory [Applause] I'm not to have a benefit you didn't think we did that in Sheriff so too did you job let me ask you a question where were you before the foundation of the world where were you in the sons of God shouted for joy you may be sick you may have lost everything but I have one question I'm not gonna talk about your loss I'm gonna talk about your seed [Applause] I'm able to give you all your loss back [Applause] [Music] we have just passed I pulled over into the side where they wrestled me we've just passed the 75th anniversary of Auschwitz and the Holocaust I read an account of a man is a doctor of psychology him and his he was in his early 20th at his wife was in the early twenties I think she was 24 or so so he was around the same age they didn't have any children and he's both taken into the concentration camp and in there he lost everything his wife was killed they would tell him in there where's my wife and the people had been in there for for time they'd look point to the smoke coming out Jimmy says there goes your wife they lost everything he said I felt like as I was coming in there that's coming in there Barun my wife was dead and I was childless I'd have no children it said the only thing I took with me was my clothes on my back and I had smuggled in in my coat a manuscript I had written of a scientific manuscript so but they took us into a shed and they told us to strip all our clothes off and I couldn't hide that manuscript anymore he said I even lost Eddie six wives I was childless in my scientific world now he's childless physically I had no wife now not only that they shaved every hit or every hair off of my body and they put a number on my my body and I no longer had a name they took my heritage away they took my name away they took my identity away they took my possessions away they took my family away now all I am is a number I cannot be referred to as a name I'm a number and then they made me put on a coat in clothes of a man who's already been burnt in the crematorium I'm putting on a dead man's clothes now I want to tell you friend you think you lost everything I'll tell you the power where the word of a king is there's power he said I reached into that said I've lost everything said I've lost my my scientific baby I'll have no baby in the physical I said I've lost my identity have lost everything he said but I reached in that pocket and in there was at one page of paper torn out of the prayer book of the Jews and it was the holiest prayer here o Israel the Lord your God is one God then you shall love him with all your heart and with all your soul I want you to know it don't matter where death is and loss here's where the world of a king is there is power and it's a supreme word Satan may act like he's in control but one slip of paper brought a man up from the ground still have meaning in my life that's what one word from God will do to you the enemy wants to take your meeting take your purpose take your identity but one word from God here old Israel they might have took your name what I call you Israel a prince with clock your prints with God yes somebody left power was God you may have lost your wife your father your mother your children your possessions but I am still with you opportunity I kept track of how long y'all sung I still got time now here is another thing about Jeroboam you may not have realized what the Jews the reason why a man could make could make the decisions he did to make a choice that is still being felt today that two tribes would have their names blotted out from under heaven and they're still blotted out today right only in heaven were they raised are they restored but even today jeroboams decision is still moving on took away identity took away meaning by an introduction here's the thing what he introduced he thought was new and it wasn't now here's one way that could make it one thing that could make him make that step become one of the most corrupted King in the history of Israel was that people called him the second Moses read your Bible you find out that when he came back he had built cities for a king of one to kill him it's what the Bible says built a garrison for Solomon Solomon one to kill him to Pharaoh when the kyoya is Egypt kill the children of Israel but they built cities for him and then in rare bomb here comes Jeroboam and he asked them to relieve the burden upon the people Moses went into Pharisees let my people go right Jeroboam goes to Rael balm and says can you not be so hard and what did rare balm say said what my father did in a little form I'm gonna do in the big form what did Pharaoh say to Moses I don't know that God you're talking about go ahead and take the straw away from him now here's a man getting an idea he's the second coming to Moses there's a way you can start introducing things to the bride is when you think you're greater than the Prophet God sent that somehow the people need brother Branham and you to explain what brother Branham could not if I hurt your feelings it's okay because we're judging by the word aren't you glad I said that first hey man here's a man thinks he's Moses again what a positive thing brothers what an opportunity you all have you can be brother branham again the growth the greatest prophet Israel has ever known at that time and they're telling a servant here just like Moses he didn't have the discernment to realize Satan had come right in and is offering him a God offering I'm gonna give you an offering here so what did he do he became king of ten tribes and now because he's been down in Egypt he thinks politically not spiritually in spirit he has is a worldly one not a spiritual one huh III I'm not preaching to any jeroboams here hey I'm just telling you about him I'm telling him you have an opportunity he never has because he turned his down you have yours he turned his flame down you have yours so now here he is looking like Moses so when he take when when Rea a bomb takes a throne we can just step over into his kingdom for just a moment into Rey Obama's Kingdom and find out here's a mistake a young King made his zeal his zeal for his father's Kingdom caused him to judge a situation wrong God allowed it because judgment had to come in on the house of Solomon but he had old counselors and he had young counselors the old counselors taught peace and the young counselor says bring the hammer down young brothers this is just just a little word here cuz I was also a young but I tried to call myself a young brother for as long as I could until finally an older brother told me you're not young anymore alright but I know what it's like to have the seals pull the sword but there's a reason sometimes older brothers don't pull the sword as quick as the younger brothers it's not because they're just tired why is it brother Jack acting out on that situation if I was the pastor God is tired of jeroboams and he knows if that pastor might move too quick that idolatry might spring up that much quicker sometimes our zeal to cut a head off leaves a vacuum that Satan cut comes in on real bomb didn't listen now the kingdom is divided and Jeroboam takes over ten tribes now let's turn to 1st Kings 12 I really want to get something real fast real fast stay there for an hour - now I'm not going to be like a brother I know overseas that he preached for eight hours and let off for after four hours so the kids could go the bathroom because they were crying I'm not going to do that I promise you we're get out on time you have lunch because I'm older I need to go back to the hotel I have to eat I have to go to bed it's cause brother Aaron's long-winded a man well your friends right or we was hey man no brother heard wonderful preach I'm just I feel too loose all right all right okay first Kings 1225 then Jeroboam built second in mount ephraim and he dwelt therein and he went out from thence and he built Peniel and he said in his heart the heart that God wanted to have the heart that God said I'll give you the desires of that heart if you stay with my word he said in his heart now shall the kingdom return to the house of David he has a word of the prophet but he is figuring out the message on his own he said if the people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord of Jerusalem then shall the heart of this people turn again into their Lord even unto ray of balm king of Judah and they shall kill me and go again to Ray a bomb King of Judah whereupon the king took counsel man is this some we just take counsel we always fight we can find somebody agree with us we think we're right he took counsel and they made two calves of gold and sudden to them it's too much for you to go up to Jerusalem especially to get their half-hour early we live in the last age it's the more tired people and there's ever been it's too hard to go up there to Jerusalem then he said I behold like God's o Israel which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt into something what a man built he says this is the power that brought you out of Egypt what I built brought you up out of Egypt see that's the way we all can get sidetracked think it's what I preach has to be given to the people because that's the power of God they didn't just hold on put it right back down in the sheath already and then he sent one in Bethel and one and Dan and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before one even unto Dan so what Dan isn't way up in the north okay it's a long ways away so it's a god of convenience it's easier to worship that than to make your trick down there to Jerusalem three times a year for the feast that God is instituted it's just go up here God will accept it because this is the power that brought him out and then he put one in Bethel which is only about 12 miles from Jerusalem another god of convenience real close we're getting to stragglers do you know I believe it's 250 years later art could be a hundred feet there's a big difference 100 years but you know anyway 150 or 250 years later they still called Bethel the King's chapel the courts of the King this is where they worship God people's filter gets all changed and messed up and he made a house of high places and made priests of the laws of the people which were not of the sons of Levi so this was also a spirit against the priesthood that ministered we spirits are still fired and Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month now here's something real important on the 15th day of the month like unto the feast that was in Judah here it's closed it's closed and he offered upon the order so did he and Bethel sacrificing the calves he had made and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made so he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the 8th month even in the month which he had devised of his own heart he's making up his own feast day and he's putting importance the eighth month and he learned a ordained a feast through the children of Israel and he offered upon the altar and burnt inside incense now history in the Bible tells us those Levites that was around Bethel and then you see I'm not all just briefing about Jeroboam I'm blowing off the Levites in brother bands also said the Levites are a type of the bride he said the Levites around Bethel and Dan refused to take part in the worship of Jeroboam so Jeroboam left them and they left Jeroboam and they went down to Jerusalem and made Israel strong because they stood upon the world and Judah became strong and worshiped the Lord for three years because there was some bride that refused to follow the doctrine of Jeroboam and Jeroboam said we don't need the flat fold ministry anyway we would just raise up men that aren't caught of God the men of low nature there interpret the word for me spirits don't die so even though Jeroboam was raising up false gods there was a revival amongst the Levi just said I'll not stand for this I'll make my stand in this evil hour to stay with what God has already brought I choose to stay with the original word I told our church back home listen you don't have to be afraid you don't have to sit here and wonder am i in the truth or not or do I believe the right doctor or not if you got the Holy Ghost he promised to lead you and to guide you into all truth we don't have to say hold god oh god if i don't believe it that way no no no just get right in the middle of the stream God will bring his revelation right in you'll be able to stand and discern between right and wrong [Applause] my eye is not upon my friends to see if I'm in the truth my eyes upon him am i and the truth [Applause] you will Levite yuan the priests of the Lord he's made you kings and priests into Claude has a king right now I roll over a kingdom that's a spiritual Kingdom I roll over sin I roll over flesh I rule over the world and I roll over the devil the devil is under my feet the devil is under my reign he has to listen to my word because I got the supreme authority that comes from dog and I'm also a priest that brings spiritual sacrifice of praise that's what I'm doing this morning bringing a praise unto my god but cleanness says I believe in stay with you notice as soon as soon as Jeroboam builds this altar his child goes sick and will die he introduced sickness into his home whole this I'm not doing it oh you mean if I get sick I'm on the run on it's not what I mean you understand what's going on God had said I'll make your house sure but as soon as he put up an altar his son dies Oh God give us discernment let's lead on something here just a man I got 13 minutes he put up calves and said these are your God's ain't that great we got something new didn't you realize there was once a true priest by the name of Aaron that had made it God supernaturally of course it's all supernatural because when Moses gave him the questionnaire why did this happen he said you know they gave me their their jewels and stuff and I threw it in the fire and out it comes into something that all these false doctrines start supernaturally I was in the sea and I saw the angel of the Lord I was here and I saw God I had a dream I had this and I don't care about one of them all brother branham I had a dream that I'm gonna go with this woman overseas and you know she's been married five times but I'm over there he's got a brother man said you're gonna ruin your ministry all but she had a dream and I had a dream and it was of God he said your dream was mighty sweet but it's not the word I don't care how supernatural you say it is if it's not the word it's not the word I don't care if you had a dream I don't care if you had a vision I don't care if you had an angel tap you on the shoulder Paul said if an angel from heaven comes and says anything different than what has already been a preacher you're not qualified to change the times you're not qualified to change the worship what did Jeroboam do when he puts up these these uh these gods he changed the approach to God and he changed God's present office work what was the present office work of God at that time it was right there at the Temple in Jerusalem it was the blood of the lambs being put upon the altar and he offered him a religion without the blood he changed God's present office work you know man he'll come in today and make their doctrine so important that if you don't believe it you missed it and they changed God's present office work even so much so that they say there's the mercy seat the Mercy's over I'll tell you how can mercy be over as long as the devil is here brother Ram says when the bride goes up that's when Satan comes down he said Satan right now the Devils are contaminating the atmospheres around us and accusing us before God future home he said but there's a blood come on church don't change God's office work and as long as there's one seed that has not come the life there must be Amen a kinsman redeemer [Applause] but what does Jeroboam do changes it even changes the feast day the Feast of the Tabernacles the seventh day which brother branham's said in future home that's the time we're in right now we were worshipping under the Feast of the Tabernacles and in the Millennium would be in the Feast of the Tabernacles again what he said but what was the Feast of Tabernacles as the end gathering and he said in that time you have to be joyful and then God commanded through Moses said and when you come don't come empty let me tell you when I came here this morning I came full up and I came toys fall and I came worshiping in the right hour let me tell you when you come God's Way God will speak back to you I'm worshiping in the time of his feast not yours brother BAM said the church age book he said they sing the song of Moses the servant of God the song of the lamb saying great and marvellous so that works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways thou king of saints do you see it the lamb the high priests holding his blood as an atonement on the mercy seat for our sins is the Lord God Almighty that is his present office that is what he's doing now pleading his blood for our sin Deborah today I'm the virtuous bride of Jesus Christ and how are you by him don't make the word make you proud hey man so what what was Jeroboam doing he was taking mercy away from Israel and given him a golden calf and an altar which incidentally and that altar there were still supernatural works even though his withered hand was healed at his altar come on but it was an altar he built not God so he took away mercy from Israel and he put up his own golden calves and they're coming worshiping and they think they have new revelation and they're only believing what has been all the way back since Genesis since the Garden of Eden the same spirit the trail of the serpent came on down hit Eve hit him at Mount Sinai when since identity brother Branham compared Mount Sinai to the giving of the seals the ten commandments he said is in type the giving of the seals and what was happening when the seals were being given at the bottom man was making his own idol and that spirit left Sinai and traveled on down to the land of promise and waited for his opportunity for a person who would compromise but there are some Levites and see what he's doing and they said Jeroboam I don't believe the way you believe your power is corrupt your power satanic your power is introducing into Israel a man and idolatry that will blot their names out from under heaven listen we often talk my trust this is alright this morning we often talk about we've returned to Pentecost the original Pentecost is nothing what people think Pentecost is people often compare Pentacles to what happened on Azusa Street that's not Pentecost that's what they called Pentecost brother Bram said they thought it was the long-awaited restoration but it was not because there wasn't a prophet there amen they had gifts but there wasn't a prophet there but when the Prophet came then the long-awaited restoration could come and when the restoration of the word came that came the restoration of the power and brother Branham said that original outpouring of Pentecost which outpouring Kerr came direct from Jesus on the mercy seat is in doing his church through all the seven ages and showing forth perfectly Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever say brother Denny I'm not in the seven ages anymore but where are those lost ones act help me you're in time whether you like it or not you brother Jack I'm closing not just pick it up but I want to tell you something I know what it's like I'm not preaching something I don't know I know what it's like for for my own family to come up to me said hey you know where the rapture is over you know we're in the Millennium hey since we're in the Millennium we don't need fivefold ministry anymore we don't need you we're already in the Millennium I'll tell you where their lives ended up amen it ended up their children came up in divorces in the world or following a man in false doctrine none of them stand today as a record of righteousness none of them and I say this I just open up my life all of my uncles that believe the message all of them followed false doctrine all of them and that false doctrine will always look down upon somebody trying to stand for truth and point a finger of accusation and try to tell you where you're wrong and that you don't have the Holy Ghost and you don't know what you're talking about tell you I saw them I saw them gather around my daddy when he was pastoring and they pinned him in the kitchen and they begin to tell him you don't have the Holy Ghost this is your problem this is my and I say this to our shame brother BAM says we have a family tree he said I got to say the bad parts I don't say the good parts and I love them has nothing to do with love right here I'm just telling you to help you they stood around on my grandfather and my three uncles and they all accused him of not having the Holy Ghost my mom had a mental collapse right there had to be physically carried out of the kitchen and they set there and my dad just in his own house it kept his head down and then he finally looked and says you know this is my house I don't have to stand for this and he stood up to walk out and they physically threw him back and when they did that the whole atmosphere change because where the word of a king is there's power my dad walked right up to him now listen I'm not saying this to you but stand up you're almost tall enough to be in the NBA but you're not this is not nose to nose this is nose to chest hey man but he put his nose right up at him and looked at him as calm as I'm looking at you says Satan get behind me and when he said that the whole thing broke who had the power this doctrine or the Holy Spirit that tell a man I don't have to have this in my home anymore it broke the spirit of the whole thing I watched him deflate go right down they all walked out of the house and eventually came back and repented Hey you may look simple but stay with the word honor his word [Applause] we may have a Jeroboam that tries to present his own gods and present his own quote to presented his own way I'm not interested in that I want the life of God came off the mercy seat can I say it brother just one more testimony hey man I feel like Timothy this morning who Paul taught he said hi he said that the same faith is in you and your grandmother isn't as in your mother and I'll tell you my grandmother begin to believe the message when brother Branham was on earth and she begin to follow him she worked for build down and managed to begin to follow him and go down to the meetings and so forth she was a little Mennonite woman but she was converted under brother branham's ministry she began to witness to my mother my mother begin to go down and then my dad who was just a denominational man who didn't even serve God welfare but he got all stirred up when he tried to persecute 1964 my grandmother asked brother Branham you can read it in the in the book because she says brother Branham said I have two daughters married amenity nominations they have received persecution what should they do brother Branham says hold fast show your colors in other words stand on the words when you got honest and then stand there for you want to revival stay with the word said show your colors in other words even though it's going to get hard and pressed you never came in compromised with what you believe she says now I don't tell you not to go around and fellowship with them he said but I tell you this when it comes to changing your diet a dove cannot eat with a buzzer so brother Branham said three things to my grandmother hold fast show your colors don't change your diet you say brother Danny that's real simple advice well it is real simple but it's real true aim it of my mother for 10 years a men went through hell on us and my daddy made her make a decision me or what you believe me and the children or what you believe now I could stand here today brother Jack with a complex that my mom was going to give me up for the message hey man but I don't have that complex in midnight 1973 for around that time they made my but my my uncle who was a hippie and a dope addict and everything else had benefit nah war vet hey man he gave his rock to the Lord was gonna get baptized and my mother went to my dad after 10 years let me tell you my dad moved my mother all over the country trying to get her out of the message 1965 they was up in San bernandino up in the mountains there and Big Bear Lake he was living in California working trying to get her out of the message how you moved from Ohio to California brother dant brother Bannon was down in the valley preaching things that are too being dads up there in the mountain saying I'm getting my wife out of the message I went on a 25th anniversary here three years ago and and and we retrace the steps all those places are still there where my dad lived is still there though the store my mother would go to and call back home and receive encouragement still there all of it's still there I believe it's a testament and my dad trying to get her out moved her to Florida to try to get her out of the message after but he would another Bentham died he goes all the message is over he'd found mother's books and destroyed them all I can remember him taking her clothes and throw them in the yard saying get out of my house go back call me send her home to her parents and she would call my grandmother up who just died about three years ago my grandmother incidentally was healed in when brother Branham came in and fellowship with him and said in the hotel talk to him and he begin to talk about another woman said I see this woman she's got tumors and it's such a such kind of catch he looked at my grandmas is that right and my grandmother's thought she was talking but he was talking about somebody else yeah yeah that's the kind it is and then he looked we said I see she's gonna be well and he went off my grandmother was healed at that moment of cancer she only died about three years ago you want to tell me brother battles false but I'm Tony there was somebody there that knew what she was somebody was there outside of brother Branham who knew what she was one day she's working in the phone rings up there in Ohio a man in Mandan and sister Gladys got a real strange look on her face she says said sister Edna's brother branham and he's asking for you so she picks up the phone and brother Brahim says hello sister Edna said I just wanted to call you to wish you happy birthday I want to ask you a question who told him it was her birthday I tell you this is how I believe God told him because he knew there would be a church over here and he needed somebody encourage that woman called my mother because the one that was going to preach the gospel wanting a believer yet and was persecuted somebody had to stand so somebody could be quickened you think you standing is in vain it's not in vain there's another generation watching you stand and their lives will be quickened by the same Holy Ghost quick and you left quicken down that should be the name I can remember holding on to my mother's skirts and crying it's my dad screaming at her and going off but I can also remember Haman that day that image she told my my daddy said I want to go to that baptism he said I'll tell you whatever you go when you get back I'm gone and the children's gone this is it my mom looked at him and she didn't know what to do and then something rose up and says I'm gonna go right there she made a choice I'll follow God more than the word excuse me I'll follow God more than my family oh now the pressure is on now the pressure is on lose your family what you going to do my mother just told me the other day again what it was like she goes it wasn't a process it was immediately said my said my daddy was an arrogant man hard the people of the church were scared of him he would interrupt the services he'd have house service he'd go outside rev the engine squeal the tires call on the phone interrupt the services do whatever he could in Florida when he moved down here he'd go around the town telling the church telling the Mennonite people said my wife's in a cult they believe it there's a snake in the garden and adultery and all that kind of he said she's in the cult he did everything he could to disrupt the influence but she held fast showed her colors and kept feeding on the word it's mom mom told me it was just two days ago told me it was instantaneous said I'm standing there and I've made my stand brother branham has already said 1964 hold faster because 10 years later my daddy turned and he started to cry said there's crocodile tears said I really didn't want to lose my family but I didn't know what to do and is in that moment God dropped down and he turned around and looked at my mind said I'll take you and a week later he was baptized my mom said it was instantaneous he went from being a get man to somebody just like this you want to tell me that a birth is a process let me tell you a mean the processes God works on you to get you to that point that you can be changed I'm telling you but when God calms and when God meet you you can never ever be the same again [Applause] hallelujah my god is Abraham's God when there's nowhere else to turn he still provides around [Applause] I saw that change I can remember my dad taking me the Mennonite Church and telling us as kids don't believe what your mother believes you say brother Danny what did you do what do you think who was more powerful denominational man or a testimony of truth I'm telling you the truth will always prevail you don't have to stand up and try to explain it defend it you just let it loose and it'll do the work itself just a few years later 1974 1977 God might God called my dad in the ministry moved down here to Florida and he prayed he says God I'll live anywhere in Sarasota but Pinecrest goes pinecraft swear he testified against the message all those years and of course my dad lived for 30 years right in the middle of pinecraft god will make you pay you may use take a stand against he says you go back where you came from and you tell him him and that God you a man spoke against his the one true Living God and I want you to know including that God it's still able to light the flame we may have terrible's but we also got a priesthood I'm not going with him [Applause] hallelujah let the bride chase'll I'm going all the way I don't need something new I already got it [Applause] already you came too late to tell me that God's not real you came too late to say this message is wrong you came too late to say brother man is not a prophet [Applause] this message is the gospel and power of Jesus Christ that'll save you this should be the name of the Lord and that same God is here this morning it's your opportunity my dad's has come and gone amen I tell you I saw a man fight the message in hatred and I saw a man die in peace calling on God the last words I ever heard my daddy say was the I'll renew my strength like the Eagles i watch the Bible resurrect a man who was in a coma amen they was having church and I said I'm gonna go have Church with my dad brother Jack I laid the Bible up beside his head here in the hospital and he's laying there his mouth was open his eyes

Amish boy another Amish we must be related you know the roots of the Mennonite and Amish kind of goes straight down a man and their brother Willie hanging around one day my dad sitting in the living room looking and says what do you think about the message Willie he turned red as a beet he was under pressure but that man got in prayer you got a prayer about his wife and you got in prayer about

said no and I don't believe that god I'm gonna make your jobs harder no more no more we are straw you go find it yourself and they became so distressed by their burdens Israel did they couldn't hear the word because of stress more bondage of their spirit and Moses went back to God and said God you messed up you know what God did I didn't love this did you read that scripture it gives a genealogy Moses tells God do people won't listen to me their heart and a heart and God says no they're my people is gonna go free and then he gives a genealogy you know why because God said okay Pharaoh says

I hope you got some people to be like Levi success stood against Jeroboam I met he was industrious he was annoying and doing some of the things but wrong way and in the fourth generation if we were honest we have seen some really anointed people come out but they begin to lead in the wrong way if they're leading you away from what a prophet said they are leading you in the wrong direction if they tell you that you don't need the Prophet something's going wrong do you realize Jeroboam was anointed by prophet can I put it this way you wouldn't even have you managed [Music] the teachings of a prophet [Music] I sing that song brother Danny was singing in it and I tell you the truth I see the real started at the same time I agree with that he got into that that's this Oh Lord all wonderful
