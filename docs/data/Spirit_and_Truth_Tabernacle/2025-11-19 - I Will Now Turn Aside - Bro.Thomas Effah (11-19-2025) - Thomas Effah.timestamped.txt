[9:01] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[9:04] Thank you, Jesus.
[9:06] Amen. We certainly thank the Lord to be
[9:09] uh in his house tonight. Praise God. As
[9:13] brother Maris was just mentioning, um
[9:18] God sent us a surprise. Amen. Uh for
[9:22] tonight. And and I always like to say um
[9:25] it's like being in the field of Boaz.
[9:28] And um when Ruth was in that field, the
[9:31] reapers had to drop some things on
[9:33] purpose uh just for her to get. And
[9:37] sometimes when God sends us a little
[9:38] surprise like this, then he's dropping
[9:40] something on purpose for us to get.
[9:42] Amen. And we're looking forward to that
[9:44] tonight. But brother brother Thomas
[9:46] Epha, amen, is with us. He is passing
[9:50] through these parts from Ghana. Amen.
[9:53] and um you know he had reached out to me
[9:55] and told me he was coming but I didn't
[9:57] think it would fit uh because of some of
[10:00] the other things we had going on but it
[10:01] just so happened to work out and uh and
[10:04] I believe the Lord has ordained it. So
[10:07] we want to prepare our hearts to receive
[10:09] the word of the Lord tonight uh from
[10:12] brother Thomas Epha. Amen. He's a
[10:14] minister uh from the from Ghana. Amen.
[10:18] Praise the Lord. Let's uh go to Amazing
[10:20] Grace. Amen. And then might need to
[10:22] lower the monitors just a little bit
[10:24] with this microphone. Amen. Hallelujah.
[10:32] Zing grace,
[10:35] how sweet
[10:38] the sound
[10:42] that
[10:43] saved
[10:45] a rich
[10:49] like me.
[10:54] Oh, I once
[10:58] was lost. Oh, but now
[11:04] I'm found. Oh, was blind.
[11:11] But now
[11:14] I see.
[11:17] Praise God. Praise God. Oh, praise God.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[11:33] Praise God.
[11:36] Praise God.
[11:39] Praise God.
[11:44] Praise God.
[11:48] Praise God.
[11:51] Praise God.

[11:58] Praise God.
[12:02] Praise God.
[12:05] Praise God.
[12:09] Amen.
[12:12] It's amazing grace indeed.
[12:16] Sometime we don't
[12:18] Just stop for a while
[12:22] and take inventory
[12:25] and just think of the grace of God,
[12:28] the love of God towards us.
[12:32] And the prophet said, "Millions and
[12:34] million of people are on earth today.
[12:37] But why did God select you?
[12:40] Why did Jesus pick you?"
[12:43] Then when you come to understand
[12:48] this grace of Jesus Christ,
[12:52] the grace of God,
[12:55] then something in your heart will be
[12:58] burning
[12:59] toward appreciate the love of God.
[13:04] So we thank the Lord that we have
[13:08] been selected
[13:10] from this wicked and adulterous
[13:12] generation.
[13:16] Let us pray.
[13:18] Heavenly Father,
[13:21] we don't have words
[13:24] to justify or qualify
[13:27] father this wonderful opportunity
[13:31] that is being granted unto your people.
[13:35] Father, one thing is certain
[13:37] because we were before the foundations
[13:42] of the world, we were in you.
[13:45] That is why you cannot get us missing or
[13:48] we cannot allow any one of us to perish.
[13:52] Father, we have gathered here tonight.
[13:55] Something has pulled us together.
[13:58] That's the word of God. Our heart is
[14:02] looking for this meal
[14:05] that it will energize. It will give us
[14:07] quickening power
[14:09] so that we can take up from this wicked
[14:12] world and be with you in eternity. Help
[14:16] us
[14:17] as we approach the word of God. Come
[14:21] deliver your word.
[14:23] Speak to your people.
[14:25] Bring everything under control
[14:28] and let your power manifest in Jesus
[14:32] Christ's name. Amen.
[14:36] Okay. While we are standing, maybe you
[14:37] want to turn your Bible with me. Let us
[14:40] go to the book of Exodus,
[14:43] second book of Moses,
[14:53] chapter 3.
[14:59] Chapter 3, verse 1
[15:02] to 4.
[15:12] Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his
[15:17] father-in-law,
[15:19] the prince of Midian,
[15:21] and he led the flock to the backside of
[15:24] the desert, and came to the mountain of
[15:28] God, even to Herob.
[15:31] And the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[15:33] him in the flame of fire out of the
[15:36] midst of the bush. And he looked, and
[15:39] behold, the bush burn
[15:42] with fire, and the bush was not
[15:45] consumed.
[15:47] And Moses said, I will now turn aside
[15:51] and see this great sight where the bush
[15:54] is not bent. And when the Lord saw that
[15:58] he turned aside to see, God called him
[16:02] out of the midst of the bush and said,
[16:06] "Moses,
[16:07] Moses." And he said, "Here
[16:11] am I." May the Lord add blessing to
[16:14] reading of his word. You can have your
[16:16] seat for now.
[16:20] May the Lord bless each one of you. It's
[16:23] good to come into the presence of God.
[16:26] So if you make it in God's presence, it
[16:28] means you are victorious because you
[16:30] have you have really fought battles
[16:33] before you could get here.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; The enemy is always trying to hinder
[16:37] you. He always want you to have an
[16:40] excuse.
[16:41] &gt;&gt; And you you you you dump a lot of
[16:44] excuses on you.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; But thank God you have been able to
[16:48] break through. That's right. Amen.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; So, may the Lord bless you for coming to
[16:52] church
[16:54] &gt;&gt; and uh I thank the Lord that I've got
[16:56] opportunity to to be with you this
[16:59] evening. Uh things seem not to have
[17:03] worked like this but the Lord wor it
[17:05] out. I appreciate my friend
[17:07] &gt;&gt; for granting me opportunity because it
[17:10] was not really planned like this
[17:14] but at the 11th hour
[17:17] &gt;&gt; yeah something changed so God bless you
[17:22] and I will take this opportunity to turn
[17:24] the church
[17:26] may the Lord bless you because I told my
[17:30] friend bra I don't have a car to do the
[17:32] ministry m ministry in Africa, Ghana. So
[17:37] I managed to get a car that was ordered
[17:39] from Japan. But when it got to Ghana, it
[17:42] was difficult to pay the duty, you know,
[17:44] Africa very expensive duty to clear the
[17:47] car from the port. So I told my friend,
[17:51] I told some other friends and this
[17:53] church supported me to clear that car.
[17:56] May the Lord bless you. I appreciate
[17:57] that. Let us give let us give a hand.
[18:02] God rich bless you. So when brother Jack
[18:06] comes to Africa, maybe he will come to
[18:08] Ghana. He will ride in that car like the
[18:12] very the very beast that Rebecca
[18:15] nourish. I believe Rebecca he rode. So I
[18:18] will be expecting you to come and ride
[18:19] in it. May the Lord bless you. I
[18:21] appreciate that. God bless you all.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; Uh tonight
[18:26] we are here for one purpose and we are
[18:28] here to see Jesus.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; The prophet said it depend what you want
[18:32] to see.
[18:34] If you are here to see a founder, you
[18:37] see a founder. That is maybe you say
[18:38] this man is a founder.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; If you're here to see a bishop, maybe
[18:42] you can call him a bishop.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; But if you are here to see Jesus,
[18:47] &gt;&gt; your eyes will go beyond this man's
[18:49] flesh and you will see Jesus.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; Because that is what we are here to see.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:58] &gt;&gt; There is a song here. I s I love to sing
[19:01] that one that I think 946 if it is only
[19:06] believers. Wasted years. Wasted years.
[19:11] Wasted years.
[19:15] Wasted years. Oh, how foolish.
[19:22] As you walk
[19:24] on in darkness
[19:26] and in fears,
[19:30] turn around.
[19:32] Turn around. God is calling.
[19:39] He's calling
[19:41] you
[19:43] from a life of wasted
[19:47] years.
[19:50] Wasted years.
[19:53] Oh, wasted years. Oh, how foolish
[20:00] as you walk
[20:03] in darkness
[20:05] and in fears.
[20:08] Turn around.
[20:11] Turn around. God is calling.
[20:16] He's calling
[20:19] you.
[20:21] from a life of wasted
[20:25] years.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; It's time to turn around.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; That is the subject that we want to stay
[20:33] on this evening.
[20:35] He said, "I will now turn aside."
[20:42] &gt;&gt; And tonight,
[20:44] if your focus is set on somewhere else,
[20:47] I want somebody to turn aside. I want to
[20:49] present Jesus TO YOU TONIGHT.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; TURN ASIDE. Turn your eyes from all the
[20:54] stuff, all the attractions.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; There will be attraction tonight.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; And I want somebody to turn aside.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; Look unto him.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; He's standing beside you. He has got
[21:06] something to talk to you. He has
[21:08] something to give to you. Turn aside.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Now, this was Moses.
[21:19] God's anointed prophet. He knew his
[21:21] commission. You supposed to know your
[21:22] calling.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; You don't come to church and sit here
[21:26] without knowing your purpose.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; You supposed to know your purpose where
[21:33] God has called you.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; You are not following your father. You
[21:36] are not following your mother. You have
[21:37] been brought here for the purpose. Don't
[21:39] say I am just a little guy, small boy or
[21:42] girl. I'm following my father. You are
[21:43] not following your father. You are
[21:44] following Jesus.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; Therefore, you supposed to know where he
[21:52] has called you. Moses, he knew his
[21:53] calling. He knew his purpose. He knew he
[21:56] was anointed man. He knew he was a
[21:58] deliverer.
[21:59] He went to the camp and he tried to use
[22:02] it by his physical, his strength and he
[22:04] could not work.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; FRIENDS, MOST OF THE TIME WE HAVE TRIED
[22:08] TO EXERT OUR OWN ENERGY TO DO STUFF BUT
[22:11] IT CANNOT HELP US BECAUSE you never met
[22:14] with God. All right.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; The reason WE ARE FAILING MOST of the
[22:17] time is because we have taken the wrong
[22:19] way.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; All right.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; Friends,
[22:26] but when Moses became a running away
[22:30] prophet because HE HAS KILLED an
[22:32] Egyptian and he was a wanted man,
[22:35] &gt;&gt; GOD KNOWS HOW TO BRING YOU to his
[22:37] presence.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; Maybe you put sickness on you and you
[22:40] run to God. Amen.
[22:42] &gt;&gt; Maybe you put problem on you and you run
[22:44] to God.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; He put Moses in problem and he was a
[22:49] wanted man. He has to run.
[22:53] And then you got to the wilderness. God
[22:54] says, "I got my man, but I have to give
[22:57] him training. He has to be a shepherd."
[23:02] GOD HAS TO PULL AWAY ALL YOUR STUFF,
[23:04] YOUR EXPERIENCE. HOW TO GET OUT OF you
[23:06] until God can use you. your experience,
[23:08] your ambition, your me and me, me, ME ME
[23:11] HAS TO GET OUT OF YOU. GOD HAS TO EMPTY
[23:13] YOU AND FILL YOU with his purpose.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; He did that to Moses
[23:23] after Moses about 40 years that
[23:25] experience that God said this is the
[23:28] time that I can use my prophet.
[23:34] Re said God always give a sign always to
[23:38] attract the people and after he has
[23:40] gotten the people attention to the SIGN
[23:43] THAT A VOICE WILL SPEAK.
[23:47] It is not the sign that is the purpose
[23:51] of God. He is only giving you a sign to
[23:54] attract you so that he can get a message
[23:57] for you.
[24:01] &gt;&gt; The voice of the SON
[24:04] NOW WE FIND out here the burning bush
[24:09] was a sign. It was given to attract the
[24:12] attention of Moses.
[24:15] And that is what God gives a sign for.
[24:17] To attract the attention of the people.
[24:19] That is what a sign is for. To attract
[24:21] attention. And we go down through the
[24:24] scripture here as we teach it now for a
[24:28] few minutes and we find out if that
[24:30] isn't so that he give these signs to
[24:33] attract attention and then when he gets
[24:36] the attention of the PEOPLE THEN THE
[24:38] VOICE OF the son begin to speak.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus healed the sick to attract
[24:43] attention. You see then he be he begin
[24:47] to speak. You see he always it always
[24:49] attract attention. The burning bush was
[24:52] was given to Moses to attract the
[24:56] runaway prophet attention and he turned
[24:59] aside to see what it was. Then the son
[25:02] gave a voice. The son always gives a
[25:06] voice.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; When the attention or when the
[25:13] attraction WAS GIVEN TO CATCH THE
[25:16] ATTENTION OF THE RUNNING AWAY PROPHET,
[25:18] then there was a voice
[25:22] And WHEN THE VOICE SPOKE TO MOSES,
[25:28] &gt;&gt; HE WAS VERY VERY CONCERNED TO SEE TO
[25:32] COMPARE THAT VOICE WITH THE SCRIPTURE.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Any attraction that you RECEIVE IS OKAY.
[25:41] BUT AFTER THE ATTRACTION, look at the
[25:43] voice.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; And after you LOOK AT THE VOICE, COMPARE
[25:47] IT TO THE SCRIPTURE. If it is a
[25:49] scriptural voice,
[25:55] &gt;&gt; Moses,
[25:57] Moses, he turn aside.
[26:00] God is calling somebody.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; HE'S CALLING YOU TONIGHT. TURN ASIDE. HE
[26:06] HAS A MESSAGE FOR YOU.
[26:13] WHEN HE TURNED ASIDE, THEN GOD SPOKE TO
[26:15] HIM.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; I HAVE REMEMBERED MY PROMISE.
[26:21] I MADE A COVENANT WITH ABRAHAM.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; I'M GOD OF ABRAHAM. I'M GOD OF ISAAC.
[26:29] I'M GOD OF JACOB. AND I HAVE COME DOWN.
[26:34] MOSES SAID THAT IS SCRIPTURE
[26:36] PROPHET THIS IS SCRIPTURE THIS WHAT GOD

[27:06] BIBLE VINDICATED PROPHET. HIS VOICE WHEN
[27:09] YOU HEAR, YOU LISTEN, it's a scriptural
[27:11] voice
[27:12] &gt;&gt; always.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:23] Isaiah
[27:25] one time he said, "Look and leave."
[27:27] Isaiah 5 50 55 45 21 TELL ye and bring
[27:32] them near and let them take counel
[27:34] together who have declared this from the
[27:37] ancient time who have told it from that
[27:40] time have not I the Lord and there is no
[27:44] God else beside me just God and a savior
[27:48] there is none beside me look unto me oh
[27:52] ye
[27:54] look unto me and be ye saved all the
[27:57] ends of the earth, for I am God and
[28:00] there is none else.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Look unto ME ALL YE THE WHOLE EARTH.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; You understand? That's why you have the
[28:11] song. Look and live.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[28:15] &gt;&gt; my brother live.
[28:18] Look unto Jesus
[28:20] now and leave
[28:23] &gt;&gt; for it is recorded in his word.
[28:27] Hallelujah.
[28:29] It is only that you look and live.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; Somebody want to live AND THERE IS ONLY
[28:37] ONE place to look. TURN ASIDE and look
[28:39] unto Jesus.
[28:42] &gt;&gt; That is life.
[28:44] AMEN.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[28:46] NO PERSON, BROTHER, no person can claim
[28:49] to be a Christian OR A PASTOR UNTIL YOU
[28:52] MEET GOD face to face.
[28:55] THE PROBLEM IN THE MESSAGE IS HERE LOT
[28:58] OF CONFUSION PEOPLE DOING THEIR STUFF IS
[29:00] BECAUSE THEY NEVER COME INTO THE
[29:02] PRESENCE OF GOD. LET US BE honest to
[29:04] ourselves.
[29:08] Hallelujah.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; No person HAS GOT THE RIGHT to claim to
[29:13] be a Christian or even a right to come
[29:16] behind the pulpit until he has MADE A
[29:20] PILLAR OF FIRE FACE TO FACE THAT NOBODY
[29:23] CAN TALK IT OUT OF HIM.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND?
[29:28] JUST LIKE MOSES EXPERION,
[29:31] HE CAME FACE TO FACE with God AND TO
[29:35] TAKE HIS GOD ORAINED responsibility
[29:39] just like Saul.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; The same way God commissioned his people
[29:46] to bring them face to face before he
[29:49] commissioned them.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; If you have a gift even speaking in
[29:53] tong, God has to bring you gift and
[29:55] callings without repentance. It is
[29:57] sitting in you right there. But God has
[29:58] to bring you face to face before him.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; Before your commission will be
[30:04] effective.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; God cannot send or COMMISSION ANYONE
[30:12] UNTIL HE has brought him face to face.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE BRINGS you face TO FACE, HE
[30:17] GOES WITH YOU. God has never left a man
[30:19] to GO BY HIMSELF. IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED.
[30:23] HE ALWAYS GO WITH HIS MAN
[30:27] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORK IS NOT MAN'S business
[30:30] as we missionary we are going. It is not
[30:31] the business of THOMAS NEITHER IS THE
[30:33] BUSINESS OF IT IS GOD'S business
[30:36] &gt;&gt; and if it is God business God must
[30:39] execute his business. Nobody can do it.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; So when you see a man commissioned
[30:46] brother you should know that it is not a
[30:49] man God in the man.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; GOD TOLD MOSES IN EXODUS 23:20 said, "I
[31:00] WILL SEND my angel before after he has
[31:02] called him." And he commissioned him. He
[31:05] said, "My angel will go with you." Look
[31:07] at Elazar. When Abraham sent him to
[31:10] fetch Rebecca, Elazar said, "If the
[31:13] woman will not per adventure, you will
[31:14] not go with me. You will not come with
[31:16] me." He said, "Let me tell you, the
[31:18] angel of the Lord will go with you.
[31:23] Hallelujah.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Then Elazar was satisfied. He was okay.
[31:30] Master, what did you say? Said the angel
[31:32] of the Lord will go with you.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:39] WHEN MOSES HEARD THAT COMMISSION WHEN HE
[31:42] COMMISSION was given, he said, "BUT I
[31:44] WILL SEND my angel before thee
[31:48] &gt;&gt; and he will bring you to the promised
[31:50] land. Listen to his voice. THERE IS A
[31:53] VOICE IN THE ANGEL. OBEY HIS VOICE.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; Obey his voice
[32:00] because if you don't, I will not forgive
[32:03] YOU. HE SAID, "BEHOLD, I SEND MY ANGEL
[32:06] BEFORE THEE to keep you in the way and
[32:08] to bring thee the place where I have
[32:10] prepared. Beware of him and obey his
[32:12] voice. Provoke him not for he will not
[32:15] he will not pardon your transgression,
[32:18] for my name is in him." BUT IF THOU
[32:20] SHALT NOT obey his voice and do all that
[32:24] I speak, then I will be an enemy. I will
[32:28] be an enemy unto your enemies and
[32:30] address unto if only you obey my voice.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[32:38] &gt;&gt; THERE IS ALWAYS ATTRITION. THAT IS WHY
[32:41] WE MUST HEAR go what God want to DO IN
[32:44] THIS GENERATION. THAT IS WHY HE GAVE US
[32:46] A PROPHET. A prophet IS ALWAYS A SON.
[32:49] BROTHER SAID WHEN YOU HEAR OF a prophet,
[32:51] A VINDICATED PROPHET, IT'S A SIGN
[32:53] &gt;&gt; THAT GOD IS READY TO SPEAK.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Look at PAUL AND SILAS
[33:04] WHEN they preach and then that dance who
[33:10] was giving his m a lot of money
[33:13] because of enchantment.
[33:16] That girl was giving the master a lot of
[33:18] money. But Paul and Silas, they saw that
[33:21] devil, that demon, and they cast IT OUT.
[33:24] GET OUT FROM HER.
[33:27] And when the master got to know that he
[33:29] was he has now been paralyzed because
[33:31] all his power has now gone and the way
[33:34] he was making money was really seized.
[33:37] His everything is seized. Now they
[33:39] arrested Paul and Silah and put them in
[33:41] prison.
[33:45] BUT THERE WAS ATROCION IN THE NIGHT.
[33:47] THEIR CHAINS, EVERYTHING FELL FROM THEM.
[33:50] THE PILLAR OF FIRE, GOD CAME DOWN AND
[33:54] released their chains and lose their
[33:56] chains.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; AND THE JAILER TOOK THE SOUL TO KILL
[33:59] HIMSELF because
[34:02] the his master or his he his officer big
[34:06] man is going to find get problem.
[34:10] We gave you prisoners. Where are they?
[34:14] IT WAS AN OPPRESSION. WHEN THE POWER OF
[34:17] GOD CAME DOWN, PRISON DOORS, everything
[34:20] was loose.
[34:22] Then there was a voice.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; PAUL SAID, "DON'T KILL YOURSELF." I
[34:26] SAID, "WE ARE HERE."
[34:28] &gt;&gt; It was just God giving you attraction so
[34:31] that we can speak to you.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; What must I do? If you will believe with
[34:39] all your heart that Jesus Christ is the
[34:41] son of God, thou shalt be saved.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said right away he was
[34:46] baptized
[34:48] because he saw God.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; When you see God, you'll be convinced.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[35:00] Now you go got to a crucial time. JESUS
[35:03] CHRIST HAS COME TO THE CLIMAX OF HIS
[35:05] MISSION.
[35:08] He has to go TO CALVARY.
[35:10] EVERY ONE OF US, WE MUST GO TO CALVARY.
[35:13] WE HAVE TO COME TO THAT ROAD OF CALVARY.
[35:16] THAT'S WHAT BRAB PREACHED THAT DAY at
[35:18] Calvary.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; You must take a trip to Calvary.
[35:28] Jesus has come to that place
[35:32] and they have taken A HOLD OF HIM. THEY
[35:34] ARE DRAGGING HIM TO CALVARY AND PETER
[35:36] SAID, "I WILL GO AT ANY LENGTH. I'LL GO
[35:39] WITH YOU.
[35:40] I'll go with you. Let everybody desert
[35:43] you. Let everybody run away." That is
[35:45] not Peter. I will stay on.
[35:49] Jesus said, "Peter, you can do that. you
[35:51] can
[35:53] this way
[35:55] unless I go before you
[35:58] when the high priest is the lord that
[36:01] has gone before us that's why we are
[36:03] able to walk this way
[36:07] &gt;&gt; so Peter wait until I go before you
[36:09] Peter said no I'll go with you said let
[36:12] ME TELL YOU BEFORE THE ROLL
[36:15] you will deny me three times
[36:19] amen Amen.
[36:22] The prophet SAID WE HAVE COME TO THE
[36:24] GROWING TIME. THERE IS GOING TO BE
[36:27] A TIME JESUS IS GOING to turn to you
[36:30] because you have denied him. Many of us,
[36:33] most of us has denied Jesus.
[36:37] We have PUT HIM TO SHAME. WE HAVE
[36:38] BROUGHT REPROACH to the message.
[36:41] Remember
[36:42] all the things that you did, you and
[36:45] your husband, how you are fighting in
[36:46] that community. People are really
[36:47] disappointed.
[36:50] reproach.
[36:55] Listen,
[36:58] AS I THOUGHT ON MY WAY 59 0 says 1 0
[37:03] 0 1 0 number paragraph 37.
[37:07] AFTER THE HAS grown three times and
[37:11] Peter look up in the face of the Lord
[37:13] Jesus, he begin to think on his ways and
[37:17] what he has done to our our Lord. And
[37:20] the prophecy, the word of the Lord came
[37:23] into his view. For he KNOW GOD HAS SAID
[37:29] THE SAME GOD THAT TOLD HIM THAT HAS TOLD
[37:33] US WHAT to do also.
[37:35] What did what did it DO WHEN HE THOUGHT
[37:41] on his ways THAT HE HAD TREATED HOW HE
[37:45] HAS TREATED JESUS and how he had denied
[37:49] him before the classical people and how
[37:53] he has tried to be one of the world and
[37:58] he tried to act like the rest of them.
[38:01] And when he begin to h be AND WHEN HE
[38:04] THOUGHT on his ways it drove him into
[38:07] the darkness to weep bitterly.
[38:11] I BELIEVE IT IS GROWING TIME NOW
[38:14] FOR the church of THE LIVING GOD TO GET
[38:16] ALONG ALONG WITH GOD AND WEEP in
[38:19] bitterness.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; IT IS COCKROINING TIME. THE IS
[38:25] COCO.
[38:29] It is cocky in town.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; WHY?
[38:33] WHEN JESUS TURNED HIS EYES, IT CAUGHT
[38:36] THE EYES of Peter.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus is turning his eyes tonight.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; It is touching your eyes
[38:43] &gt;&gt; and remember how you have treated him.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Then Peter remembered
[38:52] but THANK GOD. PETER LOOKED FOR A CORNER
[38:55] AND HE WEPT BITTERLY. BROTHER, IT IS
[38:58] TIME OF WEEPING. WE HAVE TREATED JESUS
[39:00] IN SUCH A WAY. THIS IS THE TIME FOR YOU
[39:02] TO WEEP BITTERLY AND SAY, "LORD, FORGIVE
[39:04] ME."
[39:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; IT IS TIME TO GET UP FROM HERE. FRIENDS,
[39:11] LET US TELL YOU, WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME
[39:13] TO STAY HERE. IT IS TIME TO GET UP FROM
[39:16] THIS WICKED WORLD. LET US BE UP IN DOING
[39:19] IT IS TIME TO get out from this wicked
[39:22] world.
[39:24] Turn a look to Jesus and then remember
[39:28] how you have treated him. It is time to
[39:30] weep.
[39:32] Didn't the time to make amusement of
[39:34] Mary. It is weeping down.
[39:39] Peter the reason he WAS NOT CONVERTED.
[39:42] PETER WAS NOT CONVERTED
[39:45] although he has WALKED WITH THE MESSAGE
[39:46] for several three and a half years but
[39:48] he was not converted. That's how he be
[39:50] behaved that way.
[39:52] YOU WILL ONLY BEHAVE THAT WAY TO DENY
[39:54] JESUS BECAUSE YOU NEVER RECEIVE THE HOLY
[39:57] GHOST.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; LET IT BE VERY SINCERE TO OURSELVES. YOU
[40:00] DON'T REALLY PAT ON YOU DON'T PUT
[40:02] PEACOCK FEATHERS IN your in your wings
[40:05] &gt;&gt; and presume that you're a peacock.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; It will fall apart.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; BE HONEST TO YOURSELF. IF YOU DON'T HAVE
[40:16] WHAT IT TAKES TO TO STAND THE SHOCK, YOU
[40:20] MUST CLIMB THE STEPS. MOVE TO THE upper
[40:25] room. I am inviting somebody tonight.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; LET US COUNT THE STEPS AND MOVE TO UPPER
[40:31] ROOM.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU COME FROM UPPER ROOM, THE
[40:34] NARRATIVE, THE STORY WILL CHANGE.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Everything will change.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[40:45] God have mercy.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Was given two signs to attract the
[40:50] people. We know vibration when he people
[40:54] had vibration his son healing.
[40:57] Second discernment.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS GOD DOING? HE WAS ATTRACTING
[41:02] THE PEOPLE TO BRING THEM TO THE THIRD
[41:04] POOL.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT THE THIRD
[41:09] POOL. NOT THE FIRST POOL, NOT THE SECOND
[41:11] POOL. The first and the second pool was
[41:12] JUST AN ATTRACTION. BUT GOD WAS
[41:15] CONCERNED WITH THE TEMPLE, THE OPENING
[41:17] OF THE WORD.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; EXACTLY.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; That was the ministry of Jesus Christ.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus also came the same place. The
[41:28] anointed one at the end 65 TABLE NUMBER
[41:31] 0725 PARAGRAPH 359. NOTICE THE VERY DAY
[41:36] WHEN THIS MESSENGER NOT WHEN HE START ON
[41:39] BUT WHEN HE BEGINS to declare his
[41:41] message. You see the first pool healing
[41:43] the second pool prophesying the third
[41:46] pool the opening of the word the
[41:48] mysteries revealed. No more THERE IS NO
[41:52] MORE HIGHER ORDER TO REVEAL the word
[41:54] than prophets.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; We are talking of A PROPHET A VINDICATED
[42:00] PROPHET.
[42:02] NOBODY can take IT FROM US. WILLIAM IS
[42:05] THE SEVENTH ANGEL AND WE have to be very
[42:08] careful and we don't add, we don't
[42:10] subtract. Whatever he said, leave it
[42:12] like that.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[42:19] NOW WHAT IS THE FASHION ON THE MOUNTAIN?
[42:22] The prophet said
[42:24] THE VOICE CAME BACK AND said it is not a
[42:28] king saw but the KING SAW
[42:32] THE WORD OF the Lord said fear not this
[42:34] is the tailpool the vindication of your
[42:37] ministry
[42:40] that is the trashing when God Abraham
[42:44] got that trash and he saw the sword in
[42:47] his hand there was a voice
[42:50] &gt;&gt; always a voice follow a sign.
[42:57] You cannot
[43:00] GET A SCRIPTURAL SIGN without a
[43:02] scriptural voice. THE LORD SPOKE UNTO
[43:04] MOSES
[43:06] THAT HE HAVE COMPASSED AROUND THIS
[43:08] MOUNTAIN so long enough. TURN NOT TOWARD
[43:12] IT IS TIME TO GO AND POSSESS THE LAND.
[43:15] In Deuteronomy chapter 2 verse 1-5, then
[43:19] we turned and looked and took our
[43:22] journey into the wilderness by the way
[43:24] of the Red Sea, as the Lord spoke unto
[43:26] me, and we compass man cell many days.
[43:33] And the Lord spake unto me, saying, Ye
[43:35] have compassed this mountain long
[43:37] enough. Turn ye notward
[43:40] and command thy the people, saying, Ye
[43:44] are compare ye ARE GOING TO PASS through
[43:47] the course of your brethren, the
[43:49] children of Esau that dwell in S, and
[43:53] they shall be afraid of you. Take ye
[43:57] good heed unto yourself, therefore,
[43:59] meddle not with them, for I will not
[44:02] give you of their land. No, not even one
[44:07] foot breath because I have given man
[44:10] unto Esau for possession.
[44:13] That's why we are moving through this
[44:15] stuff. We are moving out.
[44:19] PENTECOST CANNOT STOP US. We are moving
[44:22] out because there is an attraction. WHEN
[44:27] MARTIN LUTHER GOT THE ATTRACTION, HE
[44:30] MOVED THE PILLAR of fire move and it
[44:32] moved them to that is justification.
[44:38] The pill of move further to
[44:40] sanctification.
[44:42] THE PILL MOVE FURTHER to Pentecost
[44:44] restoration of the gift.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; But today it has moved to the promised
[44:50] land.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; That's why you sit here tonight. You
[44:54] have come back to your inheritance.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; You are back home.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; I SHALL RESTORE US, SAYS THE LORD.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; I will bring you back to this land.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; That's why you sit here.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Back to the promised land. The word of
[45:09] God.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; That is your inheritance.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; It is set. The stage is set to go for it
[45:18] to go to the promise. That's why we
[45:19] here. GOD
[45:21] GAVE ISRAEL A SUPER SIGN, BUT THEY
[45:25] REFUSE TO SEE THEIR SIGN. A VIRGIN SHALL
[45:28] CONCEIVE. THERE IS NO SIGN THAT CAN
[45:30] SURPASS THIS ONE. NO SIGN.
[45:34] No sign.
[45:37] I WILL GIVE THEM A SUPER SIGN.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT DID he do with their son? They
[45:42] rubbish it.
[45:45] They refuse to take their sign.
[45:49] But rather they went back to Jesus
[45:52] Christ. Please give us a sign. Jesus
[45:54] said you guys you are asking for a sign.
[45:59] I HAVE GIVEN YOU A sign and NOW YOU ARE
[46:01] CALLING ME THAT I was born out of
[46:05] wedlock. You are calling me a
[46:06] fornicator. You are calling me that I'm
[46:08] born of fornication.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Look at how you are treating your sign.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE CALLING ME BB. LOOK AT HOW YOU
[46:16] ARE TREATING YOUR SIGN. YOU HAVE SEEN
[46:18] THE SIGN OF THE MESSIAH. Look at what
[46:20] you are talking about.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Now you WANT TO SEE A SIGN. NO SIGN WILL
[46:24] BE GIVEN UNTO YOU BUT THAT OF JONAS.
[46:27] THREE DAYS IN THE HEART OF THE of the
[46:29] whale. So the son of man,
[46:32] &gt;&gt; this your sign
[46:36] friends.
[46:39] Jesus
[46:42] told them that I you will receive the
[46:45] son of Jonah.
[46:47] THEY PREDESTINATED
[46:49] WHEN THEY TURN ASIDE WHEN THE angel was
[46:52] with his his master John the Baptist he
[46:55] saw Jesus walk past said behold the lamb
[47:00] of God that taketh away the sins of the
[47:03] world
[47:05] MASTER SO YOU COULD NOT TAKE AWAY my
[47:08] sins no that's not my business it's not
[47:10] my job
[47:12] this one he will take away said master
[47:15] baba you finish your
[47:17] Bye-bye. If you couldn't take away my
[47:19] sin, I'll follow this one.
[47:22] He followed Jesus.
[47:24] Jesus turned around
[47:27] said, "My friend, whom do you whom do
[47:30] you seek?" said, "Master, I want to know
[47:32] where you live." Said, "Come on." HE
[47:35] STAYED WITH HIM THAT NIGHT and he OPENED
[47:37] THE SCRIPTURE. HE TOLD HIM ALL ABOUT
[47:39] HIM.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; HIS HEART,
[47:42] &gt;&gt; ALL WAS IN him was told. Amen.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "MASTER, MY FATHER JONAS TOLD
[47:50] ME THAT MESSIAH WILL COME. WE HAVE
[47:52] RECEIVED FAKE MESSIAHS, FAKE MESSIAH,
[47:55] PRETENDERS,
[47:57] &gt;&gt; BUT I am convinced
[47:59] &gt;&gt; you a scriptural messiah."
[48:05] &gt;&gt; I'll go and call my brother. Brother
[48:08] said, "Don't be a selfish Christian when
[48:10] you see Jesus. Call somebody."
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When you see Jesus, the
[48:15] reason we can't call people is because
[48:17] our character is not good.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Let it be honest
[48:21] &gt;&gt; because even if your mouth cannot speak,
[48:23] your attitude, your behavior, YOUR
[48:25] CONDUCT, YOUR CHARACTER WILL CALL
[48:27] PEOPLE.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Like somebody TOLD THE PASTOR WHEN YOU
[48:32] WAS convinced for baptism, the pastor
[48:33] said, "You want to baptize?" He said,
[48:35] "Yes, I want to baptize today." What
[48:36] happened to you? Is it the message I
[48:39] preach? I said, "No, it was good, but
[48:40] not the message. is the sons that is it
[48:43] was good but not but what happened he
[48:46] said pastor there is a brother in the
[48:49] church he's in the same company we work
[48:51] together that brother you kick him he
[48:55] will not talk you abuse him he will not
[48:57] talk whatever you do to that brother
[49:01] pastor I want to be like that brother
[49:08] &gt;&gt; hallelujah I want to BE LIKE THAT
[49:12] YOUR CHARACTER WILL CONVINCE SOMEBODY.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; YOUR CHARACTER WILL WIN SOMEBODY to
[49:17] Jesus Christ.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you honestly, there are some
[49:22] people you go closer to them is death.
[49:24] Some people you go closer to them is
[49:25] life.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Listen, MANY PEOPLE SAW ZAKIEL SAW THE
[49:35] SIGN. ANDREW SAW THE SIGN. NAT SAW THE
[49:39] SIGN. THE WOMAN AT THE WELL THEY SAW THE
[49:41] SIGN THEY WERE ATTRACTED AND WHEN THEY
[49:43] SAW THE SIGN THEY SAW A SCRIPTURAL
[49:46] PROPHET BECAUSE THIS WOMAN at the well
[49:48] master I know that Messiah cometh and he
[49:53] come this will be his sign this will be
[49:56] the Messiah sign he will know our heart
[49:59] who are you by the way woman I cannot
[50:02] hide from you you are Abraham's seed I
[50:05] that speak unto you I am He
[50:10] &gt;&gt; he saw the sign and the voice came
[50:12] forth.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[50:17] THE PROPHET IS A SIGN. A sign that the
[50:19] word of God is ready to be fulfilled.
[50:23] Anytime you see the voice that the a
[50:26] sign, a prophet, God is ready to speak.
[50:29] AGAIN, THE COMING OF THE prophet is a
[50:31] sign. Do you know that the coming of the
[50:33] prophet to the age is a sign? Now I
[50:36] don't mean a doctor of divinity.
[50:39] I don't mean some royal pastor, some
[50:42] good person. That is fine. Them is also
[50:45] God's servant. But a prophet is a sign.
[50:50] THE BIBLE says so here. And what's the
[50:53] sign of? It is a sign that the word of
[50:57] God is fixing to fulfill
[51:00] &gt;&gt; to fulfill for the voice of this prophet
[51:04] sign. Notice the coming of the prophet
[51:07] is a warning sign of judgment is at
[51:10] hand. Did you know that judgment is
[51:12] ready to strike?
[51:15] &gt;&gt; That's why God sent a prophet to the
[51:16] land.
[51:18] That's why he told you I will give you a
[51:21] ledger. I'll send you a ledger, the
[51:22] prophet otherwise I'll come and strike
[51:24] the earth with a curse. Which means
[51:26] there is going to be a curse. GOD IS
[51:29] GOING TO STRIKE THIS EARTH. BUT BEFORE
[51:31] THAT, HE WILL GIVE us a prophet. He will
[51:34] send a prophet
[51:35] and the prophet is a sign that God is
[51:39] ready to strike.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:45] The trouble
[51:48] with the Pentecostals and all the other
[51:49] churches, they fail to recognize the
[51:52] God-given son.
[51:55] Abraham said, "Hear me, thus say the
[51:58] Lord. This is your last sign. If
[52:00] anything rises greater than this, call
[52:03] me a false prophet.
[52:06] That is why nobody, nobody can really
[52:09] joke WITH THIS MESSAGE. DON'T DON'T
[52:11] DON'T PRESUME. PEOPLE WANT TO really put
[52:13] their finger in this message. Don't try
[52:15] to do it.
[52:18] God sent a prophet
[52:22] and we will take from the prophet and
[52:24] give to the people.
[52:26] You don't you don't have to bring your
[52:27] revelation, your ideas or your your
[52:29] intellectual. No, we don't need that.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; We don't need that. That's what people
[52:36] are trying to do.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going on the field. I know what I'm
[52:39] talking about. People want to try to put
[52:40] something to to make them big bishops.
[52:45] They have the privilege. They understand
[52:47] the Bible. They understand everything.
[52:48] All the messages in their bosom.
[52:54] May God HAVE MERCY.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS SIMPLICITY.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Like I told my friend Brah Quinton when
[53:03] a a minister called me to preach in Togo
[53:07] and he has really called a big big name
[53:09] in Ghana. One big name in Ghana and that
[53:12] big name excuse him said no I cannot
[53:14] come. So my friend Brad Don the voice of
[53:16] God represented in Rome he said I have a
[53:19] friend Thomas if you get his number and
[53:21] call him. So he called me. I said,
[53:23] "Okay, I'll go and then hold the
[53:25] convention, the meeting for them in
[53:27] Togo." When I got to the station and the
[53:30] brother drove to pick me, when he saw
[53:32] me, he this brother, what can he preach?
[53:40] So he said he was very disappointed. So
[53:42] he took me in the car, he went and then
[53:45] took me to the hotel. Then he he the
[53:47] service start. I went to the poopy like
[53:49] this. After the SERVICE
[53:53] FIRE FELL EVERYWHERE and after the
[53:55] service he came to the office and he
[53:57] knelt down beside me like I was sitting
[53:59] he come
[54:01] brother forgive me I said brother what
[54:03] have you done to me
[54:06] said no let me tell you when I pick you
[54:09] at the station I was disappointed in you
[54:14] but brother forgive me
[54:17] from that time any He is always calling
[54:21] me to come
[54:25] prayer. It is not the big name THAT
[54:27] PREACH THE MESSAGE. IT'S THE HOLY GHOST.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; BUT PEOPLE GIVE GIVE THEY PUT premium on
[54:34] big names.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; When you have a good pastor is a gift,
[54:43] &gt;&gt; not a big name. Maybe brother Jack might
[54:46] not have a big name in America but we
[54:49] are not dealing with big names.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; We are dealing with Holy Ghost.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAID YOU ARE RECEIVING YOUR LAST
[55:00] SIGN.
[55:02] THIS IS THE LAST SIGN TO THE GENTILES.
[55:04] ABRAHAM RECEIVED THE LAST son and Isaac
[55:07] appeared. No sign was given to him AGAIN
[55:09] WHEN HE SAW GOD IN FLESH. That was THE
[55:12] LAST SIGN. WHEN ISRAEL ALSO RECEIVED THE
[55:15] LAST SON, they saw God in flesh.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; TODAY WE THE GENTILES, WE were not
[55:20] privileged. BUT TODAY, THIS IS our day
[55:23] to SEE GOD IN FLESH. AND THAT IS OUR
[55:26] LAST SIGN.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; That's our last sign to see God in
[55:35] flesh. And that is why we should not
[55:36] make mistake. Brother is not God.
[55:39] Brother Abraham IS NOT CHRIST. BUT GOD
[55:41] HAS REVEALED HIMSELF IN human flesh.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; That's why today I'm confident that God
[55:49] is on earth. Brother said God is on
[55:51] earth.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Not this one. This one is a polluted
[55:55] earth. God has to cleanse it and
[55:57] renovate it.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; But he has finished with you.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; He has renovated you.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; That's why he is SITTING IN YOU.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; GOD IS ON EARTH. This earth
[56:10] &gt;&gt; is where Jesus is.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus on earth.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus in you.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; The hope of glory.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[56:21] &gt;&gt; BUT HE'S GOING TO CLEANSE this one in
[56:24] the millennium and he'll bring it down
[56:26] here. But today when I see you, I've
[56:28] seen Jesus. That is why you should not
[56:30] disappoint me. You should not disappoint
[56:32] your brother. Let your brother see Jesus
[56:34] in you. AMEN.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; YOUR CONDUCT, EVERYTHING.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; LET US SPELL OUT JESUS.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; BROTHER, we must be honest TO OURSELVES.
[56:45] IT IS TIME TO TURN ASIDE. LET US TURN
[56:48] ASIDE FROM ALL THIS WORLDLY THINGS. ALL
[56:50] THIS STUFF. YOU AMERICA, YOU are you are
[56:52] saddled with many. I know lot of things.
[56:56] Lot of deaths. Lot of So you are
[56:57] working. It's not easy. We know. We
[57:00] know. And then you support missions. You
[57:03] stop a lot of things.
[57:05] But you must also have time AND TURN
[57:08] ASIDE. TURN ASIDE.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; LOOK UNTO JESUS.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Have time for God.
[57:21] That's the last sign.
[57:24] Beloved,
[57:26] you must turn aside.
[57:29] And when you turn aside, be very
[57:31] attentive. Listen to the voice. DON'T
[57:34] ONLY BE ATTRACTED with a sign but look
[57:36] at the voice. Brother said LOOK
[57:40] MAYBE YOU ARE looking for a wife and
[57:42] then you see a sister he he he fit all
[57:45] the qualifications all your
[57:47] requirements. The sister fit into that
[57:49] category
[57:51] but she is not your wife yet. You are
[57:54] just admiring her.
[57:58] Just open your mouth and give her you
[58:00] are that is offer. And when he she
[58:03] accept then he becomes yours.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Otherwise you'll be admired. Oh this
[58:08] sister is nice. Oh
[58:15] you understand?
[58:17] If if I was a young man I'm looking for
[58:20] a wife to be married and there stood a
[58:23] girl he met every qualification that I
[58:25] thought it would be good to take him for
[58:28] a wife. Why morally? She was a queen, a
[58:31] lovely, fine personality, a fine
[58:34] Christian, everything that I could think
[58:36] of to make me a good wife. NO MATTER HOW
[58:38] MUCH I say she's perfect, she is exactly
[58:42] right. She isn't mine till accept her
[58:46] and the responsibility of her being my
[58:49] wife.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE JUST ADMIRING. SO ALSO THIS
[58:53] MESSAGE that is the same thing like the
[58:55] message you must say it IS RIGHT. THE
[58:58] MESSAGE IS RIGHT or this that and that
[59:01] you become a sympathizer sympathizing
[59:03] with the message I believe this that is
[59:06] the truth I BELIEVE IT BUT YOU HAVE GOT
[59:08] TO ACCEPT IT AND IT HAS GOT TO BECOME
[59:12] PART of you and you become part of it
[59:16] &gt;&gt; then it become yours
[59:20] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST BECOME PART OF THE MESSAGE
[59:22] BECOME PART OF MALACHI 4 DON'T STAND ON
[59:25] THE SIDELINE ON the fence and the admir
[59:28] Malachi 4. Oh, that's good. That's a
[59:30] good message.
[59:33] You must be part.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said that day you shall
[59:38] know I in God, God in me and I in you.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; This is the day
[59:46] then you are part of Jesus. He look onto
[59:49] you and say flesh of my flesh, bone of
[59:51] my bone.
[59:55] Samson was a GREAT MAN AS HIS FOCUS was
[59:58] turned on God. Said he was a great man
[1:00:01] as long as he followed the Lord and kept
[1:00:04] his commandment. The same thing as long
[1:00:06] as the church walk with God and keeps
[1:00:08] his commandment, God can use the church.
[1:00:10] But when the the church GET OFF ON THE
[1:00:14] SLAND AS Samson did, then God can't use
[1:00:16] the church anymore.
[1:00:18] What can you say more? Because you have
[1:00:22] turned from God's requirements.
[1:00:29] SAMSON, HE WAS A STRONG man because he
[1:00:34] was complying with all God's
[1:00:37] requirement. His laws were there.
[1:00:40] Everything the covenant was there. So he
[1:00:42] was a strong man. But when
[1:00:46] he went flirting with the world
[1:00:49] and then Delila put her to sleep
[1:00:53] on her lap. May God have mercy like a
[1:00:57] pre David is that awake from your sleep.
[1:01:01] It is time to awake brother. But when
[1:01:03] you awake from your sleep be careful
[1:01:05] that your locks are not off. All right.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; When you wake up, make sure your loss
[1:01:15] are not off.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Noah, they they were unlookers.
[1:01:23] Unlookers that stay with the scientists
[1:01:26] and rejected the God-given sign and the
[1:01:28] voice. They rejected it. Noah, there's
[1:01:31] no way rain can come from heaven. Look
[1:01:34] at the signs. Look at the machines. It
[1:01:36] proved that there's nothing nothing rain
[1:01:38] comes from the the ground. It doesn't
[1:01:40] come from heaven. Science dispute
[1:01:43] disputed they disprove what Noah was
[1:01:46] preaching. Today we are facing the same
[1:01:49] challenge. Leave that man. He he he was
[1:01:52] trying to call himself God and God kill
[1:01:54] him. That's what the Pentecost are
[1:01:56] talking.
[1:01:58] The man was trying to say he was God. He
[1:02:00] was something else and God kill him.
[1:02:04] May God have mercy. But brother, YOU
[1:02:06] HAVE PULLED THE LENS. YOU HAVE FOCUSED
[1:02:08] IN AND NOW YOU ARE CONVINCED THAT THIS
[1:02:10] IS A VINDICATED PROPHET.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; NOTHING, nothing can pull you away from
[1:02:15] this.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Nobody can deceive you
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; because you are part of this message.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; The 10 spires, THEY WENT TO THE PROMISED
[1:02:25] LAND. BUT Pet I mean Joshua and Caleb,
[1:02:29] they were keenly following the pillar of
[1:02:31] fire. You understand this message? Set
[1:02:34] your eyes on Christ.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Don't look onto anyone. You look onto
[1:02:39] your sister, you'll be disappointed.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; You look onto Brian Thomas, you'll be
[1:02:44] disappointed.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; LOOK ONTO JESUS.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; HE IS YOUR EXAMPLE.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? JOSHUA AND CALEB BECAUSE
[1:02:56] THEY WERE FOCUSED. THEY WERE LOOKING AT
[1:02:58] THE PILLAR OF FIRE. THEY HAVE TURNED
[1:03:00] ASIDE. THEY DON'T CARE WHO WHATEVER IS
[1:03:03] GOING ON. ALL THEIR CONCERN was to look
[1:03:06] onto the pillar OF FIRE. WHEN IT MOVES,
[1:03:08] they move. When it stop, they stop.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God,
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; friends. And finally, the pillar of fire
[1:03:16] got to the promised land.
[1:03:20] And it hang on the promised land. And
[1:03:23] Joshua and Kell saw it. Said, "Finally,
[1:03:27] we have come to our destination.
[1:03:32] WHEN YOU WATCH, you look at THE PILLAR
[1:03:34] OF FIRE AND YOU ARE SICK AND THE PILLAR
[1:03:36] OF FIRE PROMISE YOU AND HE PUT YOU ON
[1:03:38] YOUR INHERITANCE. BY MY STRIPES YOU ARE
[1:03:40] HEALED. WHEN YOU SEE THE PILL OF FIRE
[1:03:41] RIGHT THERE, you'll be convinced that
[1:03:43] you have arrived.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; You'll be convinced. Nobody can take it
[1:03:49] from you. No doctor can take it from
[1:03:52] you.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Doctor, you say I would not be healed.
[1:03:54] The pillar of fire has brought me to the
[1:03:57] promised land.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:04:03] Caleb and Joshua once they were looking
[1:04:07] at father Abraham footprints
[1:04:09] BECAUSE IN GENESIS 13 REMEMBER WHEN
[1:04:12] ABRAHAM GOT TO THE LAND AFTER HE HAS
[1:04:14] SEPARATED from Lot, you have to get away
[1:04:17] from all those KIND OF STUFF UNTIL GOD
[1:04:19] can show you your inheritance.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR INHERITANCE, YOU
[1:04:23] HAVE TO SEPARATE YOURSELF and God will
[1:04:25] show you your inheritance.
[1:04:27] Amen.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; That's what he did to to to Abraham.
[1:04:32] Abraham, separate yourself from this guy
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; before I can show you your inheritance.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; And when they separated, he did not HE
[1:04:41] DID NOT TELL ABRAHAM TO SIT ON THAT ON
[1:04:44] THAT on that e
[1:04:48] or that tree and then begin to draw a
[1:04:50] plan. Abraham could have tell God, Lord,
[1:04:52] I am a good architect. I can draw. Let
[1:04:54] me stay here and then draw that mountain
[1:04:57] river Ephites. This Yeah, let me draw
[1:05:01] it. No, God said, "Walk through the
[1:05:04] land."
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; That's what God told him. Walk through
[1:05:09] the land, the length and the breath
[1:05:14] because footprints is the possession.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; JOSHUA AND KALEB COME TO THE SAME PLACE.
[1:05:24] THEY KNOW FATHER ABRAHAM'S FOOTPRINTED
[1:05:26] THERE. SO THEY WERE looking at the
[1:05:28] footprint OF FATHER ABRAHAM. TODAY I AM
[1:05:30] LOOKING AT THE FOOTPRINT OF JESUS
[1:05:32] CHRIST. JESUS STEP HERE. JESUS step
[1:05:34] here. Jesus step here. Jesus step here.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Nobody can take that from me.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; You understand? And because I'm stepping
[1:05:43] in the footprints of Jesus Christ
[1:05:45] brother I am confident.
[1:05:49] Far Abraham STEPPED HERE. BUT THE OTHER
[1:05:51] 10 GUYS, they were looking at the
[1:05:53] opposition.
[1:05:54] Wow. Golth,
[1:05:58] these guys are giants.
[1:06:01] Hey, he can't take the land.
[1:06:06] Brother,
[1:06:07] you are looking AT THE CANCER. YOU ARE
[1:06:10] LOOKING AT THE SICKNESS.
[1:06:12] OH, I cannot be healed.
[1:06:14] WOW.
[1:06:15] A CHILD OF GOD, YOU YOU CANNOT MAKE YOUR
[1:06:18] CLAIM.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; DON'T PUT JESUS TO SHAME. HE PAID THE
[1:06:24] PRICE OF SIN. HE PAID THE PRICE OF YOUR
[1:06:26] SICKNESS.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; HE DIED SO THAT YOU LIVE.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Turn aside. We'll be closing very soon.
[1:06:38] This is evening service. We cannot stay
[1:06:39] long. Brother, I want somebody to turn
[1:06:42] aside.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Turn aside
[1:06:46] and look unto Jesus. Is that right?
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Jonah
[1:06:55] when he turned from his responsibility
[1:06:58] and he he joined the ship of Tashes.
[1:07:01] Many people have joined that ship. You
[1:07:03] remember the time you joined the ship of
[1:07:04] Tashes? You were also riding the ship of
[1:07:06] Tashes. One day you were going the wrong
[1:07:09] direction.
[1:07:11] You took the wrong route.
[1:07:15] But you got to a place
[1:07:18] that there was a tumble. There was a
[1:07:22] great storm. And what happened? They
[1:07:26] have to throw you overboard.
[1:07:30] THEY THROW YOU FROM THE CHURCH. THEY
[1:07:32] THROW YOU because they could not contain
[1:07:34] you. denomination couldn't contain you
[1:07:37] again
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; because you have pulled the focus.
[1:07:45] Jonah said, "Hey, my friends, you are
[1:07:47] trying to throw all stuff into the sea.
[1:07:50] If you don't throw me, you will never
[1:07:52] have peace.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; You don't have peace."
[1:07:57] And when they throw him,
[1:07:59] there was the the storm was calm.
[1:08:03] Everything was calm. Wow. They were
[1:08:06] astonished and they were afraid because
[1:08:09] Jonah identify himself to these guys. I
[1:08:12] am the servant of the most high God.
[1:08:18] FRIENDS, TURN ASIDE WHEN ELISHA he saw
[1:08:22] THE MESSAGE OF HIS DAY ELIJAH AND HE SAW
[1:08:25] THE MANTLE WHEN HE PUT THE MANTLE ON HIM
[1:08:28] AND HE WEAR IT. It didn't fit him at
[1:08:30] that time. He has to go through some
[1:08:32] training.
[1:08:35] You understand first king 19 when you
[1:08:38] put the mantle on him it couldn't fit
[1:08:41] him he said master said you have to be
[1:08:44] trained you need training
[1:08:48] so I'll follow you
[1:08:51] they come to battle
[1:08:54] said Elisha this is where the altar is
[1:08:58] this where they kill the sacrifice when
[1:08:59] you are here you eat meat meat
[1:09:02] they kill lot meet here. This is the
[1:09:04] altar better. So stay right here.
[1:09:08] Said, "Master, my belly is not is not
[1:09:12] for food. I am my eye is on the mantle.
[1:09:16] My eyes is ON THE POWER THE HOLY GHOST
[1:09:19] in you. That's what I'm eyeing.
[1:09:23] I will FOLLOW YOU." HE TURNED ASIDE FROM
[1:09:26] ALL THOSE THINGS, ALL THE PRIESTS, HOW
[1:09:28] THEY WERE KILLING SHEEP, KILLING GOATS
[1:09:30] AT BATTLE. HE TURNED ASIDE,
[1:09:33] FOLLOWED THE MASTER. They come to
[1:09:35] Jericho. There was the sons of the
[1:09:37] prophet. They maybe they were
[1:09:39] prophesying. They were prophesying. They
[1:09:41] were prophesying to exile. It was just a
[1:09:44] a great excitement. It was an
[1:09:47] attraction.
[1:09:48] But Elisha, he turned aside. He said,
[1:09:51] "Master,
[1:09:53] don't ask me to go and join those staff.
[1:09:55] I will follow you." HE GOT TO JORDAN. HE
[1:09:59] SAID STAY AT THIS SIDE OF the door that
[1:10:01] I'm crossing over. Said master you you
[1:10:04] mean I should stay at THE BANK BEFORE
[1:10:06] ELIJAH REALIZE HE HAS to cross over to
[1:10:09] the land THE OTHER SIDE. WHEN JESUS IS
[1:10:13] crossing cross also
[1:10:16] DON'T WAIT CROSS OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE.
[1:10:20] And when he cross
[1:10:23] Elijah look at him say my friend you
[1:10:25] have prevailed. You made it. You made
[1:10:29] it. Ask whatever you want. It should be
[1:10:32] given unto you.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE COME TO. WE HAVE
[1:10:37] CROSS JORDAN. JORDAN MEANS DEATH. WHEN
[1:10:39] YOU DIE, WHEN ALL THE WELLIES, EVERY
[1:10:42] STUFF DIE OUT OF YOU. Ask whatever you
[1:10:45] want. It should be given unto you.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; How many want to take a trip to Jordan?
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Cross Jordan. Die.
[1:10:58] Friends,
[1:11:00] it is time to turn aside.
[1:11:03] Turn aside.
[1:11:07] WHEN MOUNTAIN SUNSET, LOOK AT THE
[1:11:09] PEOPLE. THEY SAY IT WAS A JET PLANE.
[1:11:11] Some smoke, some smoke formed the cloud.
[1:11:14] When they turn aside, that's what they
[1:11:15] saw
[1:11:17] by their opinion.
[1:11:20] BUT WHEN I TURN ASIDE, I SAW THE
[1:11:22] CONSTELLATION OF ANGELS. AMEN.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; That's what I saw.
[1:11:30] God, the angels returning to glory after
[1:11:34] they brought a message.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; But if you saw cloud, take it. That is
[1:11:38] you.
[1:11:44] That's why we have str interpretation in
[1:11:46] this message. Strange strange.
[1:11:50] And you the youngest people are putting
[1:11:52] all those fool THINGS ON THE ON THE
[1:11:53] INTERNET AND PEOPLE ARE READING READING.
[1:11:56] How many books have you read and then
[1:11:57] you are looking at people's opinion on
[1:11:59] the internet.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; What will that research do you? It will
[1:12:05] not do you good but it will do you harm.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Turn aside from all those things. Look
[1:12:12] onto Jesus. Focusing. Jesus is the same
[1:12:15] yesterday, today and forever. Focusing
[1:12:17] from Genesis to Revelation. You will see
[1:12:19] him. Amen.
[1:12:21] Saul, he was persecuting the church. But
[1:12:24] when the pillar of fire strike him that
[1:12:26] day, he turned aside and he remembered
[1:12:28] his father Moses said, "This is the fire
[1:12:31] that my father met right away." He
[1:12:34] called him, "Lord, what do you want me?
[1:12:37] What do you have me to do for you?"
[1:12:42] Can you recognize him?
[1:12:45] The pillar of fire in the message shalom
[1:12:48] said the pillar of fire started this
[1:12:49] church. It to end this church. Paul
[1:12:52] pillar of fire. William pillar of fire.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; PILLAR OF FIRE IS RIGHT HERE WITH US.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; HE NEVER LEFT US.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; HE'S RIGHT IN THE CAMP.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; IT'S BECAUSE THAT WE DON'T PULL THE
[1:13:06] FOCUS. YOU HAVE TO ROB YOUR EYES. LET US
[1:13:10] AWAY FROM OUR SLUMBER. YOU WILL SEE THE
[1:13:12] SAME PILLAR OF FIRE. YOU SEE THE POWER
[1:13:14] OF GOD. THE WORKS THAT I DO, he shall
[1:13:16] also do
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; that the commission. Otherwise, he told
[1:13:20] a lie.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; He's with us.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; He can never leave us. He said, I will
[1:13:29] never leave you nor forsake you. I will
[1:13:31] be with you until the end of the world.
[1:13:33] That's a promise. You understand? So, it
[1:13:37] is time for us to turn aside. Let us
[1:13:39] look onto Jesus. Turn aside from all the
[1:13:43] fake imperson impersonators people TRY
[1:13:45] TO IMPERSONATE. TURN aside the
[1:13:48] prophesied in the message. Look the same
[1:13:51] message. Look the this is 63 0428
[1:13:55] paragraph 2 292. The same in this group
[1:13:59] brother. This is re genuine spiritfilled
[1:14:02] men and women. Re you can't put finger
[1:14:06] on their life. Won't you look and leave
[1:14:11] this evening?
[1:14:13] It was morning. Look away from the imp
[1:14:16] impersonators.
[1:14:18] LOOK AWAY FROM THEM. THE ones that will
[1:14:22] be fanatics.
[1:14:24] Look away from all that and look to the
[1:14:27] real Jesus.
[1:14:29] We are it recorded in his word.
[1:14:32] Hallelujah. To those that look for him.
[1:14:36] the second time he will appear. We are
[1:14:39] looking for his second coming. That is
[1:14:41] in the book of Hebrews. Hebrews chapter
[1:14:43] 9 vers 28. Those that look for HIS
[1:14:45] SECOND COMING TURN ASIDE. DON'T JOIN the
[1:14:48] moners who are always making preparation
[1:14:50] to appoint cap captains to take them
[1:14:52] BACK TO EGYPT.
[1:14:54] MERS THEY WERE weeping mourning. Moses
[1:14:56] why do you bring us here? WE ARE GOING
[1:14:58] TO APPOINT captains and go back to Egypt
[1:15:01] and eat garlic.
[1:15:05] May God have mercy. How many people want
[1:15:08] to go back to Egypt?
[1:15:12] Brother, you don't need any captain. The
[1:15:15] captain is in the camp, the pillar of
[1:15:16] fire. Moses, the anointed prophet. But
[1:15:20] these people, they wanted to appoint
[1:15:21] captains and go back to Egypt in the me
[1:15:24] in Numbers 14, chapter 4. Numbers
[1:15:27] chapter 14. And they said one to
[1:15:29] another, let us make a captain, and let
[1:15:32] us return to Egypt. Why do you need
[1:15:34] another captain?
[1:15:39] May God have mercy on us. The captain is
[1:15:42] in the come.
[1:15:44] Is somebody ready as we going to pray?
[1:15:46] Are you ready TO TURN ASIDE? TURN YOUR
[1:15:48] ASIDE FROM ALL THIS KIND OF THING. All
[1:15:50] this thing that give you attention be
[1:15:53] attracted by the Holy Ghost. If you are
[1:15:56] not born again, let us not take chances.
[1:15:59] This time the message we have to preach
[1:16:01] to you guys is Holy Ghost fire. You need
[1:16:04] it. You need that perpetual FIRE TO BE
[1:16:07] BURNING IN your life.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; It to consume ALL THE WORLDLY THINGS,
[1:16:11] all the stuff. It to consume. That's
[1:16:12] what the fire is SENT FOR TO BURN ALL
[1:16:15] THOSE THING OUT OF YOUR life
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; and then Christ will get a good place to
[1:16:21] stay. The fire comes first before
[1:16:25] Christ.
[1:16:26] You understand?
[1:16:28] The same
[1:16:30] said, let us put a smile on the face of
[1:16:32] Jesus Christ. Put a smile on HIS FACE.
[1:16:35] THE REPORT THE HOLY GHOST IS ALWAYS
[1:16:37] periodically sending report. Your
[1:16:39] conduct is always being reported to
[1:16:41] Jesus to the Lord.
[1:16:43] And what report is the Holy Ghost
[1:16:46] carrying along?
[1:16:48] Ask yourself
[1:16:50] in a message say hear him say he go WITH
[1:16:53] A REPORT. FATHER, your son is doing
[1:16:56] good. Oh, your daughter. I'm proud of
[1:16:59] your daughter. She's good.
[1:17:02] Then Jesus will sit and then chess out.
[1:17:04] That is my daughter.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; THAT'S MY DAUGHTER. BUT WHEN THE REPORT
[1:17:11] becomes otherwise,
[1:17:14] oh Jesus, is that your daughter? Oh,
[1:17:19] she has brought such a shame and
[1:17:21] reproach. Then Jesus head will drop like
[1:17:23] that.
[1:17:26] FRIENDS, LET THE LORD JESUS HEAD NOT
[1:17:29] DROP. LET HIS HEAD BE STRAIGHTENED LIKE
[1:17:32] THIS AND SAID, "THAT IS MY SON.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; THAT is my daughter."
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Make Jesus proud tonight.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; We are going to turn aside. Are you
[1:17:42] ready to pray?
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Turn aside.
[1:17:46] Look unto him. He's calling you.
[1:17:50] He's calling you.
[1:17:53] When you call Moses, Moses turn aside.
[1:17:55] So, can't you hear his voice?
[1:17:58] He's calling you. It is time to turn and
[1:18:02] look onto Jesus. Forget about all the
[1:18:06] obstacles, whatever, the hindrances, the
[1:18:08] all the the the hangings, whatever. Turn
[1:18:12] and look onto him.
[1:18:16] We are going to pray.
[1:18:18] Are you ready to pray?
[1:18:23] Will you turn aside?
[1:18:26] God is calling you.
[1:18:29] Like I love that son.
[1:18:32] Wasted years.
[1:18:35] Wasted years. Oh, how foolish.
[1:18:43] As you walk
[1:18:45] in darkness
[1:18:47] and in fears,
[1:18:51] turn aside.
[1:18:53] Turn aside.
[1:18:56] God is calling.
[1:19:00] He's calling
[1:19:02] you
[1:19:05] from a life of wasted
[1:19:09] years.
[1:19:11] I want somebody to talk to Jesus.
[1:19:16] Let Jesus hear your voice tonight. Talk
[1:19:18] to him. Tell him, "Lord, I've heard I've
[1:19:21] seen the attraction. There's such an
[1:19:23] attraction and I turn I'm turning aside
[1:19:25] tonight and THERE IS A VOICE IN THAT
[1:19:28] ATTRACTION. THERE'S A VOICE in the sun.
[1:19:30] Jesus will speak to you. Your heart
[1:19:33] desire will BE MET TONIGHT. JUST TURN
[1:19:35] ASIDE. HE HAS A PACKAGE FOR YOU. Jesus
[1:19:39] has your solution." Braan said don't
[1:19:41] look at the problem. The problem is
[1:19:43] always there. What is important is the
[1:19:45] solution.
[1:19:48] The problem will always be there. But
[1:19:51] the solution is what count. Look at the
[1:19:53] solution. IF YOU ARE SICK, SICKNESS WILL
[1:19:55] always be with us as long as we are in
[1:19:57] this flesh. But the solution is in Jesus
[1:20:00] Christ.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; We need that.
[1:20:04] Just talk to him for a while.
[1:20:08] open up for him that Lord I am turning
[1:20:11] aside
[1:20:19] all the things that mostly attract you
[1:20:22] God is calling you turn aside
[1:20:26] he has something special
[1:20:29] the enemy always said sin is appealing
[1:20:33] sin is very nice Satan will package you
[1:20:36] very beautiful
[1:20:38] to attract somebody. That's how he pack
[1:20:41] sin. Sin is very attractive.
[1:20:44] But may God have mercy. Let that not
[1:20:47] attract somebody here. Turn aside and
[1:20:50] look at Jesus. Look at the blood.
[1:20:55] I'm going to pray.
[1:20:58] If somebody is here tonight
[1:21:00] and he has really battled it all by
[1:21:03] himself
[1:21:04] to no avail,
[1:21:07] the hour has come.
[1:21:10] You can walk out here and say,
[1:21:12] "Ministers, pray for me because I've
[1:21:17] tried. I've tried. I've fought the
[1:21:20] battle by myself."
[1:21:23] But still
[1:21:26] you couldn't come with any success.
[1:21:29] Who is here tonight among us that has
[1:21:31] been fighting battles?
[1:21:34] You can be on your feet while we are
[1:21:36] going to pray for you. It's time to turn
[1:21:39] aside.
[1:21:42] Don't look at somebody. Close your eyes
[1:21:44] everyone. Let somebody stand up.
[1:21:45] Somebody that is fighting battles
[1:21:49] and then you want Jesus to touch you
[1:21:51] tonight.
[1:21:53] The power of God is here.
[1:21:59] His ambassador is here on earth. The
[1:22:01] Holy Ghost is still here to do God's
[1:22:04] will.
[1:22:05] God bless you. God bless you, precious.
[1:22:08] God bless you,
[1:22:11] heavenly father.
[1:22:15] Nobody can pull somebody from his seat.
[1:22:18] IT WILL TAKE THE HOLY GHOST TO DO THAT.
[1:22:21] IT WILL BRING SUCH A CONVICTION TO YOUR
[1:22:24] SON, YOUR DAUGHTER THAT NO I CANNOT
[1:22:27] FIGHT THIS BATTLE ALONE. I need a strong
[1:22:30] hand. AND THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE STOOD
[1:22:33] UP. THEY STAND UP
[1:22:36] BECAUSE THEY WANT JESUS TO GIVE THEM a
[1:22:39] hand. Father, IN THE NAME OF JESUS
[1:22:43] CHRIST, YOUR SERVANT,
[1:22:46] I PRONOUNCE ON THIS SISTER AND THIS
[1:22:49] BROTHER, LET THE HAND OF GOD GIVE THEM
[1:22:51] THE TOUCH. FATHER, TOUCH THEM TONIGHT.
[1:22:55] GIVE THEM VICTORY IN THE NAME OF THE
[1:22:57] LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[1:23:00] WHATEVER THE CHALLENGE MIGHT BE,
[1:23:02] WHATEVER THE OPPOSITION, WHATEVER THE
[1:23:04] FAILURE, whatever it is, IN THE NAME OF
[1:23:07] THE LORD JESUS CHRIST, I PRONOUNCE
[1:23:09] VICTORY IN JESUS CHRIST'S NAME. FATHER,
[1:23:13] grant unto your children. Father, the
[1:23:16] whole congregation maybe they could not
[1:23:18] stand up, but they are battling with
[1:23:19] some stuff. Father, may you remember
[1:23:21] each one of THEM AND ADDRESS ALL ISSUES
[1:23:24] AND LET YOUR PEOPLE GO FROM HERE
[1:23:26] REJOICING WITH TESTIMONIES, WITH JOY,
[1:23:28] WITH HAPPINESS.
[1:23:30] BECAUSE SHE SAID YOU ARE JOY YOU GAVE
[1:23:32] UNTO US NOT THE JOY AS THE world givers
[1:23:36] this peace of God will stay with us
[1:23:38] through all this eternity help your
[1:23:40] people help my friend pastor Jack for

[1:24:37] use that name and people have never
[1:24:39] heard it before. So they they go
[1:24:42] straight to Google and they they do all
[1:24:45] their research and and uh after Google
[1:24:48] brings the results and maybe even AI
[1:24:51] bring the results uh they feel like
[1:24:54] they're experts on who brother Brandon
[1:24:56] was based on what Google said and he
[1:24:59] said he asked the question say have you
[1:25:01] read any of the sermons
[1:25:04] uh that he preached just the same amount
[1:25:06] of time that you put in Google to study
[1:25:08] that just study just one or two sermons
