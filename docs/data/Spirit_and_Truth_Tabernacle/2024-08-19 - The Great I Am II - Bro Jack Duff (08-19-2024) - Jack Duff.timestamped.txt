[50:54] seated Amen in the presence of of the
[50:57] lord we are uh continuing a journey we
[51:04] started on last week with the thought of
[51:08] The Great I Am amen The Great I Am and
[51:14] there are a couple things that I have in
[51:16] my spirit and I I I don't know uh which
[51:21] way things will go but um I won't
[51:24] release this I won't be released from
[51:26] this thought until I get all those
[51:28] things out of my
[51:29] spirit uh but we we we we started this
[51:34] last week I was explaining amen a uh a
[51:37] quote that I was a sermon I was
[51:40] listening to recently perfect faith and
[51:43] as I was listening to that uh brother
[51:45] Brandon was talking about a young man
[51:48] who was being criticized because he
[51:51] believed in Divine
[51:53] Healing and uh so he says you know he
[51:58] get moody sometime y'all heard me uh
[52:01] quote that and he was talking about how
[52:03] sometimes Satan throws things in his
[52:05] face and then when God uh performs a
[52:08] miracle uh he loves to throw that right
[52:11] back at the Devil and say what about
[52:14] that sometimes you have to uh uh reflect
[52:18] on what God has done and throw things
[52:20] right back at the Devil don't don't sit
[52:22] and let him just talk to you all the
[52:24] time you know what you can can do you
[52:27] can talk to the
[52:29] devil and and I even when he ain't
[52:31] saying nothing to you you can go to him
[52:33] now what about that did you hear that
[52:36] testimony did you hear what God did for
[52:39] my brother did you hear what God did for
[52:41] my sister what about that and and
[52:44] because that begins to build your faith
[52:46] where you realize if God Did It For My
[52:49] brother or my sister then that same God
[52:52] is capable of doing it for me praise the
[52:56] Lord
[52:56] so this young man you know heard these
[52:59] people criticizing Divine Healing and
[53:02] and then he knew that there was a
[53:03] situation in their in their Community
[53:05] where this lady had been diagnosed with
[53:08] cancer but uh and everybody just kind of
[53:10] gave up on this lady but when when the
[53:13] Lord touched her uh he went to these
[53:15] critics and said what about that what I
[53:18] mean now you talk about divine hilling
[53:19] a't right but what about that you know
[53:21] you say God is not the same yesterday
[53:23] today and forever but what about that so
[53:25] he began to you know kind of put them in
[53:27] a place and brother Brandon made the
[53:29] statement say no he he he is The Great I
[53:32] Am Not the I will be not the I was but
[53:36] he is the I am and I like him uh even
[53:40] revealing himself to Moses when Moses
[53:43] want to know what is your name you you
[53:45] want to send me down here to the to to
[53:47] uh the the the children of Israel but
[53:49] they're going to ask me well what is his
[53:51] name what's the what's this God that
[53:53] you're talking about that we that we all
[53:55] serve but we want to know his name name
[53:57] he said well you just tell them that I
[53:59] am that I
[54:00] am has has sent you down and and when
[54:03] God took that name with with with with
[54:06] Moses what he did was take a present
[54:08] tense name for every
[54:12] generation oh Hallelujah he is not just
[54:16] a God that opened up a Red Sea for the
[54:19] children of Israel if you are facing a
[54:23] Red Sea this morning the I am is still
[54:28] present yes he is hallelujah he is the
[54:31] same yesterday today and forever and
[54:33] often times we have to be reminded of
[54:35] who our God is and and and and hopefully
[54:39] in this in this in this journey we'll
[54:40] find out not only who our God is but if
[54:43] that God is dwelling on the inside of
[54:46] you then it's time for you to recognize
[54:49] who you
[54:50] [Applause]
[54:52] [Music]
[54:54] are yeah there's been many of
[54:56] testimonies of God moving in our midst
[54:59] and I I I went through a number of
[55:01] scriptures on last week I didn't finish
[55:04] him so I want to just kind of pick up on
[55:06] some more um Moses could have went back
[55:10] when I'm I'm sorry yeah when God told
[55:12] Moses um I am that I am you know he
[55:15] could have went back in scripture and
[55:18] found where God used that title in other
[55:22] situations when he spoke to Abraham
[55:25] there in Genesis 15 151 we talked about
[55:27] it he told Abraham I am thy shield and
[55:31] thy great reward amen I'm I'm I'm your
[55:34] Shield I'm where you place your faith
[55:37] amen I'm your shield and I'm your
[55:39] exceeding great reward and he uh you
[55:42] know there's many things that he could
[55:43] have looked back at and and there was
[55:45] one that I ended up on out of Song of
[55:47] Solomon 2 uh verse one says I am the
[55:50] rose of Sharon amen and the lily of the
[55:55] valleys and I wanted to read a quote
[55:58] that goes along with that particular
[55:59] verse of scripture out of the message
[56:01] the seed of discrepancy Amen brother
[56:04] brandom tells us here in this sermon he
[56:06] says but when it comes to that name of
[56:10] Jesus Christ they walk just as far from
[56:14] it as they can now you know people don't
[56:16] want you to pray anymore in the name of
[56:17] the Lord Jesus uh you know that you can
[56:20] you can say all kind of other things but
[56:22] just don't use the name Jesus right but
[56:25] when it comes to that name of Jesus
[56:26] Christ they walk just as far from it as
[56:28] they can they don't want nothing to do
[56:31] with it for he is the word and the word
[56:34] declares itself notice the only way of
[56:38] Escape he is the rose of Sharon the
[56:42] Bible said he was every title in the
[56:45] Bible uh of God uh of God belongs to
[56:50] Jesus Christ he was Alpha Omega the
[56:54] beginning and the end he he that was
[56:57] which is and shall come the root and
[56:59] offspring of David both root and
[57:03] offspring of David amen the Morning Star
[57:07] the rose of Sharon the lily of the
[57:10] valley the alpha omega father son Holy
[57:14] Ghost amen all in Jesus Christ he was
[57:18] the full manifestation of Jehovah God
[57:21] made flesh to dwell Among Us that's
[57:23] exactly what he was he was the Ros of
[57:26] sharing what did they do with the rose
[57:28] of sharing they squeezed it out come on
[57:32] they mashed it out to get the perfume
[57:36] out of it and and this is what I was
[57:37] referring to Amen on last week brother
[57:40] brother Smiley talked about that process
[57:42] amen and and many of us don't realize
[57:45] when we're going through trials and
[57:46] tribulations we're just going through a
[57:48] process amen it's not that God forgot
[57:50] about you it's not that God can't change
[57:53] your situation just like this but God is
[57:56] to Tak you through a process Amen in
[57:58] order to get his glory out of you
[58:01] hallelujah amen to get his character
[58:03] formed in you so so he says uh uh it's
[58:06] squeezed out mashed out to get the
[58:08] perfume out of it a beautiful rose has
[58:11] to be squeezed down to get the perfume
[58:15] from the rose and that's what a
[58:17] beautiful life there never was a life
[58:20] live like it but it had to be squeezed
[58:23] out on Calvary see they took the
[58:25] anointing of the Rose of Sharon and put
[58:28] it upon Aaron he had to be Anointed with
[58:31] that for to go in before the Lord in the
[58:33] Holy place in the Holy Veil he had to be
[58:36] Anointed with the rose of Sharon to go
[58:39] in to sprinkle The Mercy Seat each year
[58:42] and that anointing must be upon him a
[58:45] sweet smelling Savor unto the Lord
[58:48] packing the blood of the lamb before him
[58:51] after he had also been sprinkled by the
[58:53] lamb uh pom pomegranate Bells around his
[58:57] garments he had to walk a certain step
[59:01] playing holy holy holy unto the Lord now
[59:05] this is the priest that he's talking
[59:07] about now and we want to we don't want
[59:09] to just leave this back in the in the
[59:10] Old Testament amen even today with
[59:14] everything we do to do for the Lord we
[59:16] have to live a life that is Holy Holy
[59:20] Holy unto the Lord I can't come up here
[59:23] and preach and my life is filthy filthy
[59:27] filthy I gotta have holy holy holy unto
[59:31] the Lord you can't come up here and sing
[59:34] if your life is filthy filthy filthy
[59:38] your life got to be holy holy holy unto
[59:41] the Lord you can't get on the piano the
[59:43] instruments and play if your life is
[59:46] filthy filthy filthy but your life must
[59:49] be holy holy holy unto the Lord yes sir
[59:54] am glory to God we required to live a
[59:57] life of Holiness he says notice he is
[59:59] that Rose of Sharon that sweet smelling
[1:00:02] Savor the anointing upon his people you
[1:00:06] cannot come before him with any Creed
[1:00:09] any other thing but anoint it with that
[1:00:11] Rose of sharing the word he says and he
[1:00:14] all he also is the lily of the valley
[1:00:16] now how do you get opium he says you get
[1:00:19] opium when you take a Lily and squeeze
[1:00:22] it out you get opium doctors use it in
[1:00:25] their Laboratories take a man that's
[1:00:28] nervous and look at this not only that
[1:00:30] not only a man that's nervous but a a
[1:00:32] man that's
[1:00:34] flustrated and if I can just use that a
[1:00:36] man that's
[1:00:38] frustrated praise God Amen sometimes
[1:00:41] when we go on through trials and
[1:00:43] tribulations you can see the
[1:00:45] frustration amen it comes out brother
[1:00:47] brother Wesco used to make a statement
[1:00:49] he says don't tell us that you're in the
[1:00:51] fire because we smell the
[1:00:54] smoke we smell it all over you amen we
[1:00:57] know you in fire because everything
[1:01:00] around you just show that you in fire
[1:01:01] but one day you realize you're going to
[1:01:03] come out of that fire and the and the
[1:01:05] and the fire is there in order to take
[1:01:07] you through a
[1:01:10] process amen like like uh in in the when
[1:01:13] when they when they take gold and they
[1:01:15] put it in the fire the the very purpose
[1:01:17] of putting it in the fire is so that and
[1:01:19] not only put it in fire oh my they beat
[1:01:22] it while it's in the fire amen they they
[1:01:25] hit it here and they hit it there and
[1:01:27] there's one purpose that amen Thea has
[1:01:30] in his mind he said I got to see my
[1:01:34] reflection in the gold before I can pull
[1:01:36] it out of the fire you're not going to
[1:01:39] escape this trial until God can see his
[1:01:41] reflection inside of you yes sir you can
[1:01:46] run from here you can run to there but
[1:01:48] you going to keep going through that Tri
[1:01:50] until God can see his reflection in you
[1:01:53] yes amen so it's time just to start
[1:01:55] thinking God for what we're going

[1:08:07] could talk about him in the son of David
[1:08:10] work right which is a millennium time

[1:08:14] of man a prophetic office sir yes sir
[1:08:19] and and I'm here to tell you Amen
[1:08:21] brother Brandon was not the son of man
[1:08:25] but what brother Brandon was
[1:08:28] is a son of man
[1:08:32] revealing the son of man the son of man
[1:08:37] is the Lord Jesus Christ sir amen and
[1:08:40] every Prophet should have been pointing
[1:08:42] us to

[1:08:50] is um uh so is Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:08:53] not three Gods but the same God and
[1:08:54] three dis dispensations three office
[1:08:57] works as Father Son and Holy Spirit but
[1:09:00] like
[1:09:01] today oh my traditional blinded like
[1:09:05] they like like they was then
[1:09:07] traditionally blinded they don't see it
[1:09:10] why can't they see it they never will
[1:09:12] see it remember that thus sayth the Lord
[1:09:14] says why are you saying it then just the
[1:09:18] same as John did as the same as the rest
[1:09:20] of them there there is one sticking here
[1:09:24] and there see this this message only
[1:09:28] going to find just one here and one
[1:09:30] there I remember sister said we going to
[1:09:32] pray that the church be full and I say
[1:09:34] full of
[1:09:37] what I'm not here to try to win all West
[1:09:40] Palm
[1:09:41] Beach but the reason I'm here cuz there
[1:09:44] might be one seed here in West Palm
[1:09:47] Beach that I'm looking for praise God
[1:09:50] but we not here to win the whole city we
[1:09:51] not trying to be a mega church we we we
[1:09:54] want to be full of
[1:09:57] Believers glory to God and I know I know
[1:10:00] when this message begins to come across
[1:10:02] the people it's hard for them to believe
[1:10:03] everything this message says there's a
[1:10:05] lot of folk that want the Miracles of it
[1:10:08] they want those manifestations but they
[1:10:10] don't want the life of
[1:10:12] it praise the Lord let me go on a little
[1:10:14] further he says he says tradition
[1:10:17] tradition blinded like they was then
[1:10:19] traditionally bind they don't see it why
[1:10:21] can't they see they never will see it
[1:10:23] remember that thus say the Lord say why
[1:10:25] are you saying it then just the same as
[1:10:27] John did the same as the rest of them
[1:10:29] then there is there is one sticking here
[1:10:32] and there that's got to be brought out
[1:10:35] oh sheep of God hear the voice of God my
[1:10:37] sheep hear my voice I'm going further
[1:10:41] the woman at the well and I found that
[1:10:44] this was in our reading today if you if
[1:10:46] you following the Bible reading plan the
[1:10:48] woman at the well and I'm going to just
[1:10:50] read this because I think it's important
[1:10:52] I want to I want to make sure we get it
[1:10:54] the woman at the well recognized her day
[1:10:59] remember recognizing your message in
[1:11:00] this day the woman at the well recognize
[1:11:04] her day now how did she recognize it oh
[1:11:07] my by the sign of the
[1:11:11] Messiah look at this now she was in a
[1:11:14] bad shape she didn't want to fool with
[1:11:17] them old churches the way they were
[1:11:19] doing it they were living every way and
[1:11:21] things they were doing she didn't
[1:11:23] believe in that stuff now even though
[1:11:25] she was living any kind of way come on
[1:11:28] now she didn't believe in that stuff but
[1:11:31] she know there would come one day now
[1:11:34] now how can the prophet say she ain't
[1:11:35] beli in that even though she living like
[1:11:39] that oh y'all she didn't believe in that
[1:11:43] lifestyle even though she was living
[1:11:46] that
[1:11:48] lifestyle how could the prophet say that
[1:11:51] because when the word struck this lady
[1:11:55] amen her response to the word showed
[1:11:58] that she didn't want to live that
[1:12:00] way this lady had things taught to her
[1:12:04] while she was in Sunday school and she
[1:12:06] believed the things that were talk to
[1:12:08] her she she she she said she said now we
[1:12:11] knew that when Messiah
[1:12:13] comes they told us this when Messiah
[1:12:17] comes he's going to tell us these things
[1:12:20] oh my God yes sir yes sir Oho Lord I I
[1:12:25] tell you the truth I'm I'm I'm I'mma uh
[1:12:29] I'm I'mma read this but then I want you
[1:12:30] to just pick up John 4 maybe about verse
[1:12:35] 22 somewhere around in there I got
[1:12:37] something I just need to show you right
[1:12:39] right in there right in there somewhere
[1:12:40] in there
[1:12:42] some all right uh let let me just finish
[1:12:45] reading this it says uh they were living
[1:12:47] everywhere and the things they were
[1:12:48] doing she didn't believe in that stuff
[1:12:51] but she know there would
[1:12:53] come one woman one day the poor little
[1:12:56] fell up there on the way to the well she
[1:12:59] found that thing that she was looking
[1:13:01] for when he began to reveal to her the
[1:13:04] secret of her heart told her the sin
[1:13:07] that she was living in she said sir I
[1:13:09] believe that you are a prophet not get
[1:13:13] up out my
[1:13:19] business see see her response not not
[1:13:22] now who you think you talking to
[1:13:25] no that that's that's the present day
[1:13:27] woman at the well but back then she sir
[1:13:30] I believe you must be a
[1:13:32] prophet watch this now now they hadn't
[1:13:35] had one for 400 years said I perceive
[1:13:39] that you're a prophet and I know that
[1:13:42] when Messiah cometh he'll do these
[1:13:45] things he
[1:13:49] said this lady met the I am
[1:13:56] yes he was in the flesh and when she met
[1:14:01] him in the flesh she took off running
[1:14:04] into the
[1:14:05] City come see a man that told me the
[1:14:09] things that I've done oh my look at this
[1:14:12] I am he she recognized there was no more
[1:14:15] question how can you prove it it was
[1:14:17] already proven Messiah cometh this is
[1:14:19] what he'll do what if she what if she
[1:14:22] can recognize it by the scripture can't
[1:14:24] we recognize the even lights and the
[1:14:26] sign of today we know when Messiah
[1:14:28] cometh he'll show us all these things
[1:14:30] he'll tell us this he said I am he that
[1:14:33] speaks to you no more question she went
[1:14:36] and and she told the people come and see
[1:14:38] here he is no more question to her it
[1:14:40] was settled because she recognized the
[1:14:42] day she was living in she recognized
[1:14:44] let's just pick up you know that in in
[1:14:47] John 4 this lady caught it and and and
[1:14:51] the prophet told that she didn't believe
[1:14:53] in the that that lifestyle the living
[1:14:55] that she that they were doing she didn't
[1:14:57] believe in that she didn't believe in it
[1:15:00] and you know you you just yeah let's
[1:15:02] just pick this up I'm G catch it in in
[1:15:04] in in in um in John 4 I I think around
[1:15:10] um let's start at
[1:15:13] 19 it says uh oh um now I I'm I'm I'm
[1:15:18] leaving a lot out but the reason that
[1:15:21] this lady come to the spot is because he
[1:15:22] told us said go get your husband
[1:15:25] and
[1:15:26] come and the lady say you know what I
[1:15:28] don't I don't have a husband he said you
[1:15:30] spoke the
[1:15:32] truth he said you don't had five
[1:15:34] husbands now wait a minute I want y'all
[1:15:36] to catch that now this ain't just five
[1:15:38] men that she lived with at different
[1:15:40] times no she was married five different
[1:15:44] times five husbands and then then he say
[1:15:48] this because you know can I just y'all Y
[1:15:50] can I be playing it's all right for me
[1:15:53] to be playing and I know y'all tell me
[1:15:55] to get out y'all business but but I'm
[1:15:57] going just say it the way Jesus said it
[1:15:59] right he said you had five husbands and
[1:16:01] then he say the one you living with you
[1:16:04] acting like that man your husband but
[1:16:07] that man is not your
[1:16:09] [Music]
[1:16:12] husband the one you living with right
[1:16:15] now is not your
[1:16:22] husband now when he did he did it
[1:16:25] privately with
[1:16:30] her but but he had to make sure she
[1:16:33] understood that this lifestyle that you
[1:16:35] living is not
[1:16:37] right the one you liveing with right now
[1:16:39] is not your husband and you know when
[1:16:42] when he when when when when when she
[1:16:44] when she heard that she didn't get
[1:16:46] offended cuz she didn't want to live
[1:16:48] that lifestyle that's right she Ain get
[1:16:50] off and people that don't want to live
[1:16:52] in sin they won't get offended by the
[1:16:53] word when you want to keep that
[1:16:56] lifestyle Hallelujah to the Lamb of
[1:17:00] God sister was just telling me how she
[1:17:03] lost a job because of her social media
[1:17:06] it doesn't uh it doesn't it's not an
[1:17:10] alignment with what they job some of the
[1:17:12] things that happened in that job and and
[1:17:15] social media on her social media she
[1:17:17] post
[1:17:18] scripture and and and these people in

[1:17:25] just be honest the the the homosexuals
[1:17:27] leading amen the company and they say
[1:17:31] now your your your position amen is not
[1:17:33] in alignment with where we are but
[1:17:35] rather than put it that way cuz they
[1:17:36] know to get a
[1:17:38] lawsuit they they just say we are at whe
[1:17:41] uh company we can just fire you for
[1:17:43] whatever we want to fire you for you

[1:17:58] to hear him
[1:18:01] say I want to hear God say Well done thy
[1:18:04] good and faithful servant you've been
[1:18:06] Faithful over over over many uh into
[1:18:09] over a few things and ENT into the joys
[1:18:11] of the Lord so that's what we living for
[1:18:14] we're not living to please people we're
[1:18:15] living to please God all right I'm
[1:18:18] trying to get ahead I'm trying to get on
[1:18:20] up there

[1:19:35] truly and look at her response the woman
[1:19:37] sath unto him sir I
[1:19:41] perceive now how did she get this
[1:19:44] perception because her sins were
[1:19:47] revealed and and now I want you to
[1:19:49] understand when when he reveals uh the
[1:19:52] secrets of her heart this in itself is
[1:19:56] the sign of the
[1:19:58] Messiah
[1:20:00] amen hallelujah this is the sign of the
[1:20:04] Messiah so she says this to him she says

[1:20:10] prophet our fathers Worship in this
[1:20:12] mountain and you say that in Jerusalem
[1:20:15] is a place where men ought to worship

[1:20:32] cometh and now is when the true
[1:20:35] worshippers shall worship the father in
[1:20:38] spirit and in truth for the father
[1:20:39] seeketh such to worship him God is a
[1:20:42] spirit and they that worship Him must
[1:20:46] worship Him in spirit and in
[1:20:49] truth amen it's not just the name of a
[1:20:52] church but this is the place you can
[1:20:53] find in Christ

[1:24:36] in um John 8 because he he he's
[1:24:40] referring to this uh passage of
[1:24:42] scripture with that previous quote there
[1:24:45] about uh when Jesus comes in contact
[1:24:47] with the religious leaders of the day
[1:24:49] and he tells him um before Abraham was I

[1:25:04] 53
[1:25:06] um let's let's actually I'm sorry I
[1:25:08] start at
[1:25:10] 52 then said the Jews unto him now we
[1:25:13] know that thou H has a
[1:25:16] devil Abraham is
[1:25:20] dead and the prophets
[1:25:25] and thou sayest if a man keep my saying
[1:25:28] he shall never taste of
[1:25:30] death art thou
[1:25:32] greater than our Father Abraham which is
[1:25:38] dead and the prophets are
[1:25:41] dead who makest thou
[1:25:45] thyself verse 54 Jesus answered if I
[1:25:48] honor myself my honor is
[1:25:52] nothing it is my father that honth me of
[1:25:58] whom ye say that he is your god let's go
[1:26:01] a little further oh my yet ye have not
[1:26:05] known him but I know
[1:26:08] him and if I should say I know him not I
[1:26:12] shall be a liar like unto
[1:26:18] you don't Don't Mess With
[1:26:22] Jesus you got questions for Jesus he got
[1:26:25] answers for
[1:26:29] you I should be a like like an a liar
[1:26:32] like unto you but I know him and keep
[1:26:35] his
[1:26:36] saying now watch this
[1:26:38] statement your father
[1:26:42] Abraham
[1:26:44] Rejoice to see my day not not just
[1:26:49] Rejoice to see my day and watch this one
[1:26:52] and he saw
[1:26:56] it and was
[1:26:58] glad let me keep
[1:27:00] reading then said the Jews unto him Thou
[1:27:04] Art not yet 50 years old and and hast
[1:27:07] thou seen
[1:27:09] Abraham Jesus said unto them oh my my my
[1:27:13] verily verily I say unto you that means
[1:27:17] surely surely I say to you before
[1:27:20] Abraham
[1:27:22] was I am
[1:27:26] and watch watch watch the next verse
[1:27:29] then they took up Stones not like the
[1:27:31] woman at the well now they took up
[1:27:34] stones to cast at him but Jesus hid
[1:27:37] himself and went out of the temple going
[1:27:40] through the midst of them and so passed
[1:27:43] by they were getting ready to kill them
[1:27:44] in church
[1:27:56] the statement was made by Jesus he
[1:28:01] says your father Abraham
[1:28:05] rejoiced to see my
[1:28:08] day and he saw
[1:28:11] it and was
[1:28:14] glad how will Abraham see the day of
[1:28:20] Jesus H how is it that ABR I mean Jesus
[1:28:24] was not even living during that time how
[1:28:26] did Abraham see the day of Jesus and
[1:28:30] rejoice in the day when he saw
[1:28:36] it can I just put it this way even right
[1:28:40] now we are seeing the days of Jesus and
[1:28:44] we can rejoice and be glad when we see
[1:28:48] it the same way Abraham saw it and
[1:28:52] rejoice we can see it and rejoice
[1:28:54] yes sir amen amen let me just break it
[1:28:58] down for you I want to make it make it
[1:29:00] very very
[1:29:03] clear but my question is how did Abraham
[1:29:06] Rejoice to see the day of Jesus and he
[1:29:09] wasn't living during that time the Lord
[1:29:11] Jesus the Bible says that he saw it and
[1:29:13] was glad now this is how Abraham saw it
[1:29:17] and was glad because there was one day
[1:29:21] that Abraham was sitting yes in his
[1:29:25] tent and while he was sitting in his
[1:29:28] tent he received three
[1:29:32] visitors sir Hallelujah the prophet
[1:29:35] tells us it was about noon
[1:29:39] time that Abraham saw amen these
[1:29:42] visitors show up three men showed up at
[1:29:46] one time and when Abraham saw them
[1:29:49] Abraham gave a title to one of them he
[1:29:52] says my Lord
[1:29:54] he didn't see three Gods he didn't see a
[1:29:57] father a son and a holy ghost he saw one
[1:30:01] God and he said my
[1:30:07] Lord one of the
[1:30:09] visitors begin to speak to
[1:30:13] Abraham and you know the the the thing
[1:30:16] of it is is and this is I'm I'm I'm I'm
[1:30:18] coming out of Genesis 18 right now but
[1:30:21] but but what he said when he when he
[1:30:22] called him Abraham
[1:30:25] this visitor Abraham knew something
[1:30:28] special about this guy sir why would he
[1:30:31] rejoice in seeing him because the
[1:30:34] chapter before his name was
[1:30:38] Abram but but but God gave him a part of
[1:30:41] his name he changed him from Abram to
[1:30:44] Abraham amen God was Elohim and he gave
[1:30:48] him the high
[1:30:52] ham he just add added something to his
[1:30:54] name praise God so so only only God that
[1:30:59] gave Abraham the name change would know
[1:31:01] that his name is Abraham when he says
[1:31:04] when he comes to visit him and he calls
[1:31:06] him by name yes sir begins to talk to
[1:31:09] him Abraham Abraham where is Sarah not
[1:31:11] only did he change Abraham's name he
[1:31:14] changed Sarah's name it used to be Sarah
[1:31:16] but now it's
[1:31:18] Sarah only God could change those names
[1:31:21] so Abraham's rejoicing to see this day
[1:31:24] yes while he's there talking
[1:31:27] with
[1:31:29] Abraham say where's Sarah your wife
[1:31:32] didn't say
[1:31:33] Sarai but where is Sarah your wife she
[1:31:37] was in the tent behind
[1:31:39] them you see the sign of the
[1:31:44] Messiah sir is when the secrets of the
[1:31:48] hearts are actually being revealed the
[1:31:52] reason the woman at the well a man could
[1:31:55] know that this was Messiah because the
[1:31:58] secrets of her heart the secrets in her
[1:32:00] life were
[1:32:01] revealed the reason Abraham could
[1:32:04] rejoice in that day is because the
[1:32:06] secrets of what was going on in their
[1:32:08] tent were revealed where's Sara wife oh
[1:32:11] she's in the tent behind me behind you
[1:32:14] okay
[1:32:16] um I'm going to visit
[1:32:19] you at the time of
[1:32:22] life and Sarah not Sarai Sarah your wife

[1:32:29] something sir yes sir the name change
[1:32:33] was a a produ a character change you
[1:32:36] know even in the scripture y'all uh uh
[1:32:39] when you go I think it's Hebrews 11:11
[1:32:41] it say even Sarah got faith to believe
[1:32:45] that she was going to have a promised
[1:32:46] son now and this story that I'm telling
[1:32:48] you she was laughing but something
[1:32:50] changed somewhere along the line that
[1:32:53] Sarah received Faith she went from
[1:32:56] laughing about her situation to having
[1:32:59] faith in and if you can stop laughing at
[1:33:01] your situation if you can stop doubting
[1:33:04] your situation if you can stop just
[1:33:06] believing only what the doctor said and
[1:33:09] only what this report say you can start
[1:33:11] believing what God has said when God
[1:33:14] speaks directly to you it elevates your
[1:33:19] faith that's my promise and I'm not
[1:33:23] going to let Let It
[1:33:26] Go when you get Faith like that you'll
[1:33:29] see things begin to
[1:33:31] change I don't want to just mentally

[1:38:15] children when they reveal what was
[1:38:19] happening in the tent behind them that
[1:38:22] was a sign of the Messiah
[1:38:24] and that's why Abraham rejoiced to see
[1:38:27] the day that Jesus was speaking of he
[1:38:30] rejoiced to see it he was glad right uh
[1:38:33] that was verse 56 he says he Abraham
[1:38:36] your father Abraham rejoiced to see my
[1:38:38] day and he saw it and was glad that's
[1:38:41] how he saw
[1:38:42] it oh my you know we lived in a in a in
[1:38:46] a time period where we had a
[1:38:52] prophet he pray for the
[1:38:55] sick and and when he prayed for the sick
[1:38:57] he said now I know people just hard hard
[1:38:59] time for you to believe but said let me
[1:39:02] just do something a little
[1:39:04] different and he turned his back to the
[1:39:06] audience and he said there's a sister
[1:39:09] over here on this side and and he would
[1:39:11] even tell them their name not even
[1:39:13] looking at them tell them what their
[1:39:15] condition was thus sayith the Lord
[1:39:18] you're healed the people had no idea
[1:39:20] that when he did this they were looking
[1:39:22] at
[1:39:24] the sign of the
[1:39:27] Messiah now now you can either respond
[1:39:30] like the r religious leaders of that day
[1:39:33] and say who this man think he is or you
[1:39:35] can be like the woman at the well sir
[1:39:39] sir I perceive that thou art a prophet
[1:39:48] [Music]
[1:39:56] gen Matthew 16:15-16
[1:40:01] thank the Lord I got time to get all my
[1:40:05] thoughts out
[1:40:09] today he saith unto
[1:40:11] them but whom say
[1:40:14] ye that I
[1:40:17] am and so you got to have your
[1:40:20] own
[1:40:22] Revelation as is what this is all about
[1:40:25] because Peter Peter had a revelation
[1:40:27] Peter said in verse 26 and Simon Peter
[1:40:30] answered and said Thou Art the
[1:40:34] Christ the son of the Living
[1:40:39] God I'm picking
[1:40:43] up Matthew 8 8-10 I'm making a little
[1:40:47] turn now my second
[1:40:49] turn and here it's good to know who he
[1:40:54] is but he also wants us to know who we
[1:41:00] are this man in Matthew
[1:41:03] 8 his name is the
[1:41:07] Centurion watch the language that he
[1:41:09] uses the Centurion answered and said
[1:41:12] Lord I am not worthy that thou should us
[1:41:18] come under my
[1:41:20] roof but speak the word only yeah I just
[1:41:24] I I I was out visiting amen with brother
[1:41:27] Wesco this week and and I was talking
[1:41:30] with sister Wesco I said I just remember
[1:41:31] I think um yeah I remember we went to a
[1:41:34] meeting one time
[1:41:36] and I still remember the sermon brother
[1:41:39] Wesco got up there and preached speak
[1:41:41] the word
[1:41:42] only and then folk were
[1:41:45] like where this brother come from bro
[1:41:49] Wesco now he's already a tall man he was
[1:41:51] walking the chairs and all all kind of
[1:41:53] stuff I'm like what is I mean the the
[1:41:57] meeting was just never everybody going
[1:41:58] around speak the word on it speak the
[1:42:00] word on speak the word on I mean it was
[1:42:02] just it was
[1:42:04] contagious absolutely contagious but but
[1:42:06] look at this man he says he says but
[1:42:08] speak the word on and my servant shall
[1:42:10] be
[1:42:12] healed don't speak the doctor's
[1:42:17] report speak the word only
[1:42:24] and look at this look at this man he
[1:42:25] recognizes his position look at his
[1:42:28] language for I
[1:42:34] am and and and now Jesus makes a comment
[1:42:37] about this man because it says he say I
[1:42:39] ain't found nobody with this type of
[1:42:40] Faith a person that recognizes who they
[1:42:43] are in
[1:42:45] Christ for I am a man under Authority
[1:42:50] having soldiers under me and I say to
[1:42:54] this man
[1:42:56] go and he don't question

[1:44:34] the page uh the uh Prophet says this
[1:44:37] speaking the other night on
[1:44:39] Abraham and the seed after him how that
[1:44:43] God showed through Abraham and how he
[1:44:45] justified him the the 12th chapter of
[1:44:48] Genesis and on down 16th chapter and how
[1:44:51] he confirmed the Covenant through S
[1:44:53] ification on the 17th chapter let him
[1:44:55] nurse from his breast draw in the Holy
[1:44:58] Spirit and then he confirmed or placed
[1:45:01] him like you've heard me preach the
[1:45:03] sermon of hear ye hymn took Abraham out
[1:45:06] and changed his name from Abram to
[1:45:08] Abraham give him part of his name Elohim
[1:45:11] h m then we find out that after that he
[1:45:15] appeared to Abraham now to his seed
[1:45:19] watch how he's done the seed the same
[1:45:21] way the seed of ab come through
[1:45:23] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:45:26] the Holy Ghost manifestation of his name
[1:45:28] revealing of who he is that re the Revel
[1:45:31] that revelation of who Jesus Christ
[1:45:33] baptism in his name and so forth like
[1:45:35] that that Revelation dividing his name
[1:45:38] with his church dividing his name with
[1:45:42] his church calling them out then what
[1:45:46] did he do in that same church that he
[1:45:49] called his name Jesus name what did he
[1:45:51] do he appeared
[1:45:53] in the same form that he did to Abraham
[1:45:56] being able to discern the spirit discern
[1:46:00] Spirit behind him see appeared in that
[1:46:04] same name in that same thing in the same
[1:46:07] form we're just at the end of the road
[1:46:09] now we weren't living in the days where
[1:46:11] brother Brandon was turning his back
[1:46:12] some of us lived during that time but
[1:46:13] many of us didn't but I am here to tell
[1:46:15] you that uh there are many times that
[1:46:18] the minister comes up here and preaches
[1:46:21] something that you you know he has no
[1:46:24] idea that's going on in your house that
[1:46:27] is the sign of the Messiah can I put
[1:46:30] that again it's not the sign of the
[1:46:32] preacher It's The Sign of the Messiah
[1:46:35] that is in your
[1:46:38] midst kids have just done something you
[1:46:40] ain't even had a chance to tell the
[1:46:42] pastor and here it come right out of the
[1:46:44] pull pit get back in the C again now you
[1:46:47] know God was speaking to you today you
[1:46:49] should have been the first on the altar
[1:46:53] that's
[1:46:54] right it's a silent Messiah he is here
[1:46:57] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:47:02] forever let me catch this out of
[1:47:05] revelation of Jesus Christ out of the
[1:47:07] church age
[1:47:09] book brother random makes this
[1:47:13] statement and I and when I was wanting
[1:47:16] to make this turn I needed let me just
[1:47:19] say this sometimes you have thoughts as
[1:47:22] a minister and I and I I I knew that
[1:47:24] there was something here that I wanted
[1:47:25] to turn and and bring to show Who You
[1:47:28] Are The Great I Am is in you now and and
[1:47:32] and I want I want you to know who you
[1:47:33] are but but when when I'm thinking like
[1:47:35] that I always try to cement my thought
[1:47:39] with something that the prophet might
[1:47:40] have said so I went looking to search
[1:47:42] and search and then I found this one
[1:47:44] quote in the church his book I said
[1:47:45] there it is that's what I need to settle
[1:47:47] this in the
[1:47:49] church that's why no man can never come
[1:47:52] come along and say the holy man is a
[1:47:56] pope or the holy man is a bishop or
[1:47:59] priest he says the holy man is Christ
[1:48:03] the holy spirit in us I I actually put
[1:48:06] this one right under Ephesian Church age
[1:48:08] there's a little line that I wrote there
[1:48:10] you'll find it there uh it says the holy
[1:48:13] man is Christ the holy spirit in us he
[1:48:17] says how
[1:48:18] dare the
[1:48:21] hierarchy declare the
[1:48:23] leoty has no word to
[1:48:27] say each
[1:48:30] one has something to
[1:48:33] say oh
[1:48:36] my each
[1:48:38] one has something to say I like
[1:48:43] that each has a
[1:48:46] work each has a
[1:48:50] Ministry no side effects
[1:48:58] the Holy Ghost came at
[1:49:01] Pentecost and separate separated himself
[1:49:03] on each that it might be fulfilled where
[1:49:05] of Christ said at that
[1:49:09] day ye shall know that I am in my father
[1:49:12] I am I am I am at that day ye shall know
[1:49:16] that I am in my
[1:49:19] father and ye in
[1:49:21] me and
[1:49:23] I in you John
[1:49:26] 14:20 says The Great I
[1:49:30] Am the almighty
[1:49:33] God has come as Spirit to F his true
[1:49:40] church well where is the I am today it's

[1:50:05] come in spirit to fill his true church
[1:50:06] he has a right to move anywhere he wants
[1:50:10] to and upon anybody he wants to we don't
[1:50:14] make any holy men among us but the whole
[1:50:17] true Cong true Congregation of the Lord
[1:50:19] is hold now now I catch those things the
[1:50:21] whole true congregation
[1:50:24] cuz every Church got Believers make
[1:50:26] Believers unbelievers but the whole true
[1:50:30] Congregation of the Lord Is Holy because
[1:50:32] of the presence of the Holy Spirit if if
[1:50:35] uh it is he the holy spirit that is Holy
[1:50:38] not the congregation of
[1:50:41] itself he said The Great I Am the
[1:50:43] almighty God has come to fill his his

[1:54:12] for I
[1:54:15] am not
[1:54:17] ashamed of the
[1:54:19] gospel of Christ for for it is the power
[1:54:23] of God unto salvation to everyone that
[1:54:26] believeth to the Jew first and also to
[1:54:29] the
[1:54:30] Greek I am not
[1:54:33] ashamed Romans 8
[1:54:37] 37 through
[1:54:43] 39 this is we read a little early with G
[1:54:47] I mean Paul said if God be force and who
[1:54:48] can be against
[1:54:50] us and he said all things work together
[1:54:53] for good to them that love God to them
[1:54:54] who are the called according to his
[1:54:55] purpose but he says in this verse 37 n
[1:54:57] in all these
[1:54:58] things he's asking the question what's
[1:55:00] going to separate me from the love of
[1:55:02] God which is in Christ Jesus my Lord he
[1:55:04] said nay nay nay nay nay nay in all
[1:55:06] these things we are more than
[1:55:09] conquerors through him that loved us and
[1:55:11] look at what he say
[1:55:15] F oh tell your neighbor I am
[1:55:19] persuaded I I ain't talking about
[1:55:21] quitting I ain't talking talking about
[1:55:22] giving up I I I every day every day I am
[1:55:29] persuaded hallu they they they say they
[1:55:32] say something inside of me telling
[1:55:37] me you know that's something that's on
[1:55:39] the inside of you telling you that's the
[1:55:40] I am that lives on the inside of you oh
[1:55:44] my God my
[1:55:46] God like The Little Engine That knew he
[1:55:49] could
[1:55:52] you get from I think I can I think I can
[1:55:55] you get away from that type of thought
[1:55:57] process and thinking no no I ain't no I
[1:55:59] think I can when you get to the top of
[1:56:02] the hill and you start rolling down I
[1:56:04] knew I could I knew I could hallu
[1:56:09] brother everything your whole perception
[1:56:13] changes I for I am
[1:56:17] persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:56:20] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[1:56:23] nor things
[1:56:26] present nor things to come nor height
[1:56:29] nor depth nor nor nor nor any other
[1:56:31] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:56:35] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:56:38] Jesus our
[1:56:41] lord Galatians
[1:56:50] 2:20 says this
[1:56:53] I
[1:56:54] am
[1:56:56] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[1:57:01] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[1:57:05] and the life which I now live that means
[1:57:09] I used to live a different life but when
[1:57:11] Christ came in I start living the life
[1:57:14] that pleases Christ right it say he says
[1:57:17] uh and this life which I now live in the
[1:57:20] flesh I live live by the faith of the
[1:57:24] Son of God how could you have the faith
[1:57:26] of the Son of God you have to be
[1:57:29] dwelling hallu he got to be dwelling in
[1:57:32] you for you to have his faith
[1:57:35] amen I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:57:37] God who loved me and gave himself for
[1:57:42] me Philippians
[1:57:44] 411 y'all going to stop we're going to
[1:57:47] stop complaining we're going to start
[1:57:48] praising God and thanking God for the
[1:57:50] process that we're going through it's
[1:57:52] it's all good it's all working together
[1:57:54] for good look at Philippians 4:1 watch
[1:57:56] this now not that I speak in respect of
[1:58:01] want for I have
[1:58:05] learned in whatever
[1:58:11] state not whatever state I
[1:58:15] was or not whatever state I will be but
[1:58:19] wherever you are right now I have
[1:58:22] learned in whatever state I
[1:58:26] am
[1:58:28] therewith be content
[1:58:37] hallu I got these statements
[1:58:42] from the church age book that I wrote
[1:58:46] down and these are what I call I am
[1:58:50] statements and they coming from the
[1:58:51] church book and they also come from
[1:58:54] scripture first one says I am the very
[1:58:57] righteousness of God that's found in 2
[1:59:00] Corinthians 5:21 I am the very
[1:59:03] righteousness of
[1:59:07] God another statement says I am
[1:59:10] loosed oh my God I am loosed by the
[1:59:13] perfect blood of
[1:59:15] Jesus and no one can lay any charge
[1:59:18] against me that's Romans
[1:59:20] 8133 through 34 there is therefore now
[1:59:23] no condemnation because I am loosed by
[1:59:28] the perfect blood of
[1:59:32] Jesus also um Church a book it to say I
[1:59:36] am an heir to All God's power and
[1:59:39] omnipotence so therefore I need not to
[1:59:43] fear a fourth statement and and I I like
[1:59:46] to I may not have the material resources
[1:59:48] to fall back on but I am rich
[1:59:52] in spite of it all my security lies in
[1:59:56] Christ who is my shield and exceeding
[2:00:00] great
[2:00:03] reward Romans 8:37 actually tells you
[2:00:05] this I am
[2:00:10] more I'm more than a
[2:00:15] conqueror another statement Jesus said I
[2:00:17] will walk with him in white
[2:00:19] because I am worthy
[2:00:22] Revelation 3 and4 tells us that
[2:00:25] also Matthew 24:24 says this I am the
[2:00:29] very
[2:00:31] elect and I cannot be
[2:00:36] deceived
[2:00:38] amen this last little statement I want
[2:00:40] to give
[2:00:43] you last little I am statement out of
[2:00:47] the church AG book and I like to let the
[2:00:49] devil know this and and I want you to
[2:00:52] I'm going to have y'all repeat this one
[2:00:53] after
[2:00:54] me say I am a king I am a king and
[2:00:59] priest and priest and I have dominion
[2:01:02] and I have dominion over sin over sin
[2:01:06] the world the world My Flesh myh and the
[2:01:11] devil and
[2:01:19] theil let me leave you this with this
[2:01:21] scripture and we'll close here Matthew
[2:01:23] 28:18-20
[2:01:29] Jesus came and spake to them saying all
[2:01:32] power is given unto me in heaven and in
[2:01:36] Earth go ye therefore
[2:01:39] forth and teach All
[2:01:41] Nations baptizing them in the name of
[2:01:45] the father and of the son and of the
[2:01:50] Holy Ghost and Peter called the
[2:01:52] understand of who the name of the Father
[2:01:54] the Son and the Holy Ghost was every
[2:01:55] title points to
[2:01:58] Jesus that's why he said baptize in the
[2:02:00] name of the Lord Jesus Christ because he
[2:02:02] knew the father was Jesus the son was
[2:02:03] Jesus the Holy Ghost is Jesus not three
[2:02:06] different gods one
[2:02:07] God verse 20 says teaching them to
