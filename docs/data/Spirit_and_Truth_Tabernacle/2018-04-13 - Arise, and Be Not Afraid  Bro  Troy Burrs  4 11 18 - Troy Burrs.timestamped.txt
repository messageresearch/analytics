[24:11] man
[24:18] hey Mandy we have a wonderful service on
[24:21] Sunday yes a man still been a man
[24:25] feasting on that Hebrew six we'll just
[24:30] start that from the six verse six
[24:37] chapter six verse a man won't keep you
[24:41] standing longer than you can be seated
[24:43] and then we'll read a few other
[24:46] scriptures
[24:47] put in the context what was the point
[24:49] that we're trying to get across this
[24:51] evening
[24:52] a man if they shall fall away to renew
[24:58] them again unto repentance seeing they
[25:02] crucify themselves the Son of God afresh
[25:07] and put him to an open shame a man for
[25:12] the earth that drinketh up that drinketh
[25:17] in the rain that cometh oft
[25:21] upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat
[25:28] for them by whom it is dressed receiveth
[25:32] the blessings from God made a Lord out
[25:35] of blessings of the reading of his word
[25:37] amen
[25:38] and and you know the Prophet preached a
[25:41] message you may be seated
[25:44] to see the discrepancy and in that he
[25:46] brought that that scripture there out
[25:47] and he said that seven person said but
[25:52] the earth with drinketh in the rain that
[25:56] cometh often upon him often upon it now
[26:03] we realize that uh that rain that water
[26:08] even the pass have been talking on the
[26:11] lately about how you need that rain a
[26:13] man to sit to soften you up and man you
[26:17] go into a dry place and those that
[26:21] vegetation there become so hard and
[26:24] quickly because there's been no rain a
[26:29] manner we look back then
[26:31] in the in the in the children of Israel
[26:34] in the wilderness and the Moses smoked a
[26:38] rock and it brought forth water a man he
[26:43] said that that was a beautiful type of
[26:45] Christ being smitten and watching
[26:49] smitten he brought forth the water which
[26:54] is the holy spirit a man he said my
[26:58] whole life's in you a comforter a man
[27:01] but first that rock which was Jesus had
[27:05] to be still was spitting hey man which
[27:08] is the perfect type they're saying that
[27:10] that in you know the Prophet was
[27:12] bringing about he say he saw a picture
[27:14] one day and they had a someone had a
[27:18] recollection and they painted it and a
[27:21] show like a little drop coming out of
[27:24] that rock but he said oh no that rock
[27:27] said cattle that fed water cattle people
[27:31] and said that water came out of that
[27:33] rock just like gushing just water coming
[27:38] from the rock now how does water come
[27:41] from a rock but it's sustained life
[27:47] life-giving water and it man that if we
[27:51] want to be able to stain life in this
[27:55] hour
[27:55] amen we have to have life-giving water
[28:00] and we understand that that water types
[28:04] the Holy Ghost amen the baptism of the
[28:08] Holy Ghost is not a one time of it Amen
[28:12] you you you you you get thirsty
[28:15] your body is it's a way of letting you
[28:18] know that you need some water they give
[28:21] you if you don't drink enough water your
[28:24] body will shut down your organs will
[28:28] quit first things that start drying up
[28:32] on the inside you'll begin to have
[28:36] certain symptoms of crapping things of
[28:42] that
[28:42] your body's trying to say you need to
[28:45] get to some water you need to get to
[28:50] some water then if you ignore it then
[28:55] other things that happen that maybe
[28:57] you're maybe things are beginning to
[28:59] look dry you begin to be a bit of
[29:02] visibly see that that person is
[29:05] dehydrated you begin to get headaches
[29:09] and things of that nature and then if
[29:14] you continue to ignore that thing after
[29:16] a while what they call you go into a
[29:21] stroke from lack of water so you just
[29:24] need some fluids in it it'll be all
[29:27] right
[29:28] now if we type that in the spiritual a
[29:31] man you started out amen and uh in the
[29:38] presence of Almighty God a man in your
[29:42] end and you're running this race you
[29:45] begin to give of yourself when you give
[29:48] of yourself you so you and you you
[29:51] people if you perspire and along the way
[29:54] you lose a little bit if you don't get
[29:58] rehydrated you're not going to make it
[30:02] to the end you're just not gonna make it
[30:05] to the end amen now we want to take a
[30:11] little scripture read in him you can
[30:14] turn to it if you like if you don't like
[30:15] you don't have to we'll go right on
[30:18] we're gonna uh and my wife you're up
[30:23] sorry I just know what I just see the
[30:25] party about y'all flipping and going on
[30:28] got just want I'm gonna just keep going
[30:30] my wife always tell me said you read too
[30:32] much I say well I just do what I two
[30:35] doctors what I do do the best I can
[30:37] a man with technics reading here from
[30:44] Matthew 17 a man and we want to just see
[30:55] something here and
[30:56] we're gonna bring something out by the
[30:58] help of the Lord and after six days
[31:02] Jesus take Peter James and John his
[31:04] brother and bringeth them up into a high
[31:07] mountain and was transfigured before
[31:10] them and his face did shine as the Sun
[31:15] and his raiment was as white as life and
[31:19] behold there appeared unto their Moses
[31:22] and Elijah taken with him and Jesus and
[31:27] then then answered Peter and said unto
[31:30] Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here
[31:35] if that will let us make here are three
[31:39] Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses
[31:42] and one for Elijah and while he yet
[31:46] spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed
[31:48] him and behold a voice out of the cloud
[31:52] which said this is my beloved Son in
[31:57] whom I am well pleased hear ye him and
[32:02] when the disciples heard it they fell on
[32:04] their face I was so afraid and Jesus
[32:07] came and touched them it arrived and
[32:10] said arise and be not afraid and if I
[32:14] had the title this they were the title
[32:16] that tonight I would say arise and be
[32:19] not afraid a man now we see here in
[32:26] Matthew 13 a man uh Matthew 13:24 to say
[32:38] but I say unto you that it shall be I'm
[32:45] sorry I went back too far a man another
[32:50] power but put forth unto them saying the
[32:53] kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man
[32:55] that sword good seed in his field but
[32:59] Wow lien slept the enemy came in and
[33:05] sowed tares among the wheat
[33:09] when his way but when the blade was
[33:13] sprung up and brought forth fruit then
[33:17] appeared the tares now notice first the
[33:24] man came and sowed good seed you know
[33:27] and and and and and after that come the
[33:31] bad scene
[33:32] see so we see that the problem was
[33:35] talking about there that the person that
[33:39] so the good see was God see Satan is
[33:46] always coming behind and watching what
[33:49] God is gonna do so he said God sold seed
[33:53] in his field so now he wants to come and
[33:55] confuse the situation and so bad see in
[34:00] that same field because he he's the
[34:05] author of confusion so many times it's
[34:10] all he want to do if he can sow
[34:12] confusion into the situation a man a lot
[34:17] of times he can he can cause many
[34:20] problems in the message of seed of
[34:23] discrepancy the word discrepancy means
[34:26] to sow discord or being contrary and
[34:33] indifferent and then and then that
[34:37] messages II thank you brother that that
[34:40] the prophets constantly bringing out
[34:42] their that all we have to separate
[34:46] ourselves from unbelief it is vitally
[34:51] important amen
[34:53] that you you you keep yourself guarded
[34:57] from unbelief we see in the Garden of
[35:03] Eden that that Eve she had a barrier of
[35:10] protection Arama
[35:11] and then as long as she stayed fortified
[35:16] behind the Word of God
[35:20] but the satan is constantly looking for
[35:25] a weak point he's constantly looking for
[35:31] soft spot maybe it's something that
[35:37] somebody said to you that may cause a
[35:39] little room and it calls a little soft
[35:44] spot and seed hill of he'll attack right
[35:48] there and if he can ever get behind that
[35:54] that and and so that sea of discord in
[36:00] your heart you would do things that you
[36:06] didn't think you would do you would do
[36:10] things that you did not think you would
[36:12] do because what happened is that singing
[36:17] is laying there now hello now watch this
[36:19] the same Holy Ghost the same water that
[36:25] waters the good sea is warden of a sea
[36:31] that's why he's saying to be so close
[36:33] that are the deceive the very elect if
[36:37] it was possible but it's not possible
[36:41] why isn't it not possible because Randy
[36:46] they they realize that the devil came is
[36:50] so bad see they immediately wanted to go
[36:53] pluck up the bear scene but he say don't
[36:56] let them go together because if you go
[37:00] plug it up the bad scene while it's in
[37:04] seafoam your new damage to the goosey
[37:08] let them grow together
[37:11] you got the lake of manifest themselves
[37:16] because when the manifestation of that
[37:19] sea produces itself you need to be able
[37:24] to see which is which now on the other
[37:28] hand
[37:29] he said I'm not gonna leave it to
[37:31] anybody else
[37:32] he said I will do this Embry if it was
[37:38] possible it's not possible because Allah
[37:41] Himself is doing this separate he's
[37:44] doing the separate than the South glory
[37:48] to God
[37:49] amen amen so we see this discrepancy you
[37:56] have to separate yourself I want you to
[38:00] notice something a wild day the pastor
[38:05] made a comment he said I see what you're
[38:08] doing
[38:09] I see what they'd ever gone he was
[38:12] getting bombarded when I make a phone
[38:15] call this be then another one I make a
[38:18] phone call this thing and another one I
[38:21] make a phone call asking him questions
[38:24] about the message what about this and
[38:30] what about this and what about this and
[38:35] what about this he said I see you Devon
[38:38] I know what you're trying to do you try
[38:42] them well yeah I'm not gonna answer
[38:46] normal your questions get away I see
[38:52] what you're trying to do you're looking
[38:54] for a weak point you're looking for a
[38:58] weak point to try to so that bad seed in
[39:03] my heart you'd have to keep yourself
[39:08] protected and it's all of my brothers
[39:10] and sisters the devil mean business
[39:15] you gotta mean business because he's not
[39:21] playing amen so it's important when you
[39:28] find people that that's not speaking
[39:33] just right sowing discord
[39:40] you separate yourself now the purpose
[39:44] say it Hindu we say now you don't have
[39:47] to just have nothing to do with you say
[39:51] how to how to and goodbye because I'm
[39:54] not going to entertain your foolishness
[39:58] because I can I can't allow you to show
[40:01] that bad seed in my heart he'll slow
[40:07] that thinking you won't even know it all
[40:10] of a sudden you'll start just one don't
[40:16] like me then that thing agro next thing
[40:22] you know fine I'm leaving at shirt Oh
[40:28] from a conversation the Word of God is
[40:36] the sea so if the Word of God is the sea
[40:41] that bringeth forth good fruit it's
[40:45] gonna be a word that's so advancing it's
[40:52] through conversation through
[40:57] conversation does that seem answer if
[41:02] all you got to do
[41:03] bless you except me you ain't even got
[41:05] the acceptance oh you've got to do it
[41:07] reason with it maybe you right baby oh
[41:13] he got you that seed has been planted
[41:18] now it's going to take God to unplug
[41:24] that see you have to keep yourself
[41:30] protected let's look at an example turn
[41:35] the second Kings you love the Lord a man
[41:50] you caught up and get ahead of myself
[41:55] second Kings the third chapter
[42:17] we're gonna read from I'm sorry the
[42:20] second chapter now we're going to read
[42:22] from the ninth verse
[42:41] man he says and it came to pass that
[42:45] when they were gone over that Elijah
[42:51] said unto Elijah as what I shall do for
[43:00] thee before I'm taken away I've been
[43:04] taken away from thee and Elijah said I
[43:08] pray thee let a double portion of thy
[43:14] spirit be upon me and he said thou has
[43:20] asked a hard thing but nevertheless if
[43:25] thou see me when I am taken from thee it
[43:30] shall be so unto thee but if not it
[43:35] shall be so
[43:37] amen and it came to pass as they still
[43:42] went on and talked that behold there
[43:47] appeared a chariot of fire and horses of
[43:51] fire and parted them both of sunder and
[43:56] Elijah went up by a whirlwind into
[44:00] heaven and Elijah saw it and he cried my
[44:08] father my father
[44:11] the Charities of Israel and the horsemen
[44:15] thereof and he saw him no more and he
[44:20] took hold of his own clothes and ripped
[44:22] them to pieces
[44:24] he took up also the mantle of Elijah
[44:30] that fell from him and went back and
[44:35] stood by the bank of Jordan I mean it he
[44:39] took the mantle of Elijah and fell and
[44:41] he smoked the water and said where is
[44:44] the Lord God of Elijah and when he also
[44:48] had smitten the water he parted they
[44:51] parted hither
[44:53] and tither and he went over and earlier
[44:56] that it says he went over when they came
[44:58] over the first time when he lied you did
[45:00] he went over on dry ground amen
[45:05] so we see here a man Elijah
[45:11] a man asked for a double portion a man
[45:17] of what he has saw a man from Elijah now
[45:28] keep it on the same concept here this in
[45:33] enduring this time there was believers
[45:37] and there were borderline believers amen
[45:45] there was churches many different
[45:49] churches now we see that a hab was a
[45:56] borderline believable man a very
[46:00] religious amen he had heard the message
[46:05] from Elijah a member but he refused to
[46:08] listen I mean he just couldn't seem to
[46:11] bring himself to believe the word from
[46:15] the Prophet he had a religious
[46:17] conception Amen in a you know he said Oh
[46:22] a borderline believer a man is worse
[46:28] than an infidel a borderline believe him
[46:34] is worse than an infidel Revelation 3:15
[46:38] says I know thy works that thou I need
[46:42] the hot or cold and I will work to steal
[46:46] you out of my mouth you see work that I
[46:48] wasted she was either hot or cold but
[46:51] the worst thing you can do is be
[46:54] borderline is be borderline see we need
[47:00] to make sure
[47:02] Amen that we go all the way with the
[47:05] Lord
[47:06] now now we understand this word saying
[47:12] we don't know God we take what we get
[47:18] seen now the Prophet brought this out
[47:20] and here you him and he says you can
[47:23] either be safe physically or you can be
[47:25] saved spiritually he said the same word
[47:28] is used for both the prayer of faith
[47:30] shall save the sick in the city and your
[47:34] loss into the silent prayer which I've
[47:37] saved the lost as well amen now the
[47:40] Prophet was bringing out a situation
[47:41] here about a fella a man who had a
[47:46] prostate trouble and I'm not going to
[47:48] read the whole thing I'm just gonna
[47:49] paraphrase it and everything just for
[47:51] the sake of time and he went to the
[47:54] mezzanine and he was healed from from
[47:57] from the situation went back to the
[47:59] doctor his fella name was dr. Church and
[48:02] he was a Methodist believer and he said
[48:07] well - he's going with you over there he
[48:08] said well you know for about six or
[48:10] eight months everything was good but all
[48:12] of a sudden it came back say my god came
[48:15] back he say see he said that's why I
[48:18] don't believe God she say that's why I
[48:20] shut that show like that brother Branham
[48:22] is false
[48:23] he said the same man over there he's
[48:26] this got the church talking said I say
[48:27] man over there it means every year going
[48:29] down the road a bunch of Nazarenes and
[48:31] pilgrim holders that backslide during
[48:33] the year and claim that they were saved
[48:35] at the altar but I better say healing is
[48:41] just as wrong as your faith holds out
[48:45] and so is your salvation he said you can
[48:50] be saved tonight and also next week you
[48:55] can be healed tonight and crippled
[48:58] tomorrow it is as long as your faith
[49:04] holds out the word save is translated
[49:09] sums up which means you're saved
[49:11] physically and spiritually
[49:16] now we want you to come to stand my
[49:19] brothers and sisters that the salvation
[49:21] yeah it is the beginning of the journey
[49:25] you can't stop there you can't feel it
[49:31] well a lot of time we confuse salvation
[49:37] and sanctification with the Holy Ghost
[49:43] don't make that mistake of getting right
[49:47] to the river and saying I got enough
[49:51] it's not enough just because you stopped
[49:55] listening to a world of music and enough
[49:58] that's sanctification you are now ready
[50:04] to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[50:08] if you have went through you've taken
[50:11] the inoculation repent and be baptized
[50:16] for the remission of your sins now when
[50:21] you repent and be baptized you are
[50:25] baptized for the remission of their sins
[50:27] they say and ye shall receive the gift
[50:31] of the Holy Ghost there's something you
[50:34] got to the Prophet was telling about it
[50:38] story uh one fella he said uh I don't
[50:42] know if there be and it Holy Ghost he
[50:45] say well we're not working today I can
[50:48] show you I can show you why you don't
[50:49] have the Holy Ghost took him to a field
[50:52] and he say you just follow me Walt
[50:55] hey Walt when took him to a field and
[50:57] then they started to say well is this
[50:58] what we getting no let's keep walking
[51:00] and he took him over to a grassy area
[51:03] what a rest
[51:04] with a little bit higher and you say
[51:07] well is this what we did nope let's keep
[51:09] walking let's follow me and he walked up
[51:11] to this Pigpen but old man took off his
[51:14] shoes and a Sutton rolled his pants leg
[51:17] up and this mud slapped my leg about
[51:19] camp I went trunks and in it and he
[51:22] turned around and the fella was still on
[51:23] the sideline he said well what are you

[51:31] problem you don't want it bad enough
[51:34] that's your problem you don't want it
[51:37] bad enough what are you willing to go

[51:44] we distinct it well coming to church and
[51:48] set up underwear and it's just gonna no

[52:05] not for two hours I'm sure they were
[52:08] brother like well wait a minute what's

[52:25] it
[52:26] shame on you he's not gonna give it to
[52:29] you you don't want it bad enough come in
[52:34] with DISA oh my god
[52:36] it's Lester attitude the church my god
[52:43] once you receive the Holy Ghost you're
[52:47] not there yet we have to go all the way
[52:52] until Matthew 17 NCC said this is my
[52:57] beloved son hear you him what is that
[53:01] Holy Ghost
[53:02] once you receive that Holy Ghost he said
[53:05] that is the tutor that instituted what
[53:08] is the tool to do the tutor goes back to
[53:12] God and say well God not you got
[53:16] yourself something right there he's
[53:18] doing a wonderful job I tell you what a
[53:20] church time he's first thing then get
[53:22] that our full service bringing up well I
[53:24] take it will you be real proud of it oh
[53:25] he's just worship and having himself a
[53:27] good time well you go to the Lord say
[53:32] Lord I tell you what I hate to tell you
[53:35] this that fella stayed home to watch
[53:37] talking on TV basketball games so he let
[53:41] all
[53:42] kind of pains getting away he's doing
[53:44] this they're doing that he's just real
[53:48] slow just real slow for my god
[53:59] thank you lord
[54:13] now he says uh listen I just wanna I
[54:17] just want to bring that out the right
[54:18] way now remember those condoms
[54:24] nope let me go back here he says here
[54:26] and hearing him
[54:39] he says an English student must be just
[54:41] he don't pull any punches he must bring
[54:44] the direct truth to the father and how
[54:48] that tutor my blush when he come up to
[54:51] the father to his face and he said your
[54:54] son is not going to good he's fallen in
[54:58] his studies
[55:01] he's a dilatory how the tutor must feel
[55:08] to come before the father with such a
[55:11] message that about his son I see he's
[55:14] still a solid he just can't give you the
[55:20] keys to the kingdom yet and often wonder
[55:24] how the Holy Spirit must feel in the
[55:26] presence of God bringing the conduct of
[55:28] your modern-day Church which so much
[55:32] world in it such dilatory those things
[55:36] that been graceful - and giving the new
[55:40] birth oh it must be terrible
[55:44] and to think that in these last days how
[55:48] corrupt church is getting to be on wind
[55:53] at night instead of going to prayer
[55:54] meeting they stay home and watch
[55:58] television
[55:59] remember those conducts of yours go
[56:04] right straight in the presence of God by
[56:08] somebody who won't pull any punches no
[56:12] matter how good a neighbor you are no
[56:15] matter how fine of a pillow you are in
[56:18] the church the Holy Spirit brings the
[56:22] truth to God how he must feel when he go
[56:27] and see the woman the daughters of the
[56:30] church stripped themselves down and with
[56:32] him little short coat get out there in
[56:35] the lawnmower yard before me that might
[56:39] burn you up but at all - and he says he
[56:45] say what's the matter today
[56:48] two minutes sitting behind the pulpit
[56:52] and a lot of Hollywood evangelism we
[56:55] need that good old-fashioned gospel that
[56:57] gospel of st. Paul Paul's revival and
[56:59] the Bible Holy Ghost back to the church
[57:02] again
[57:02] it used to be robbed for the holiness
[57:05] people and the Methodist people a man
[57:08] that tried to live right for the women
[57:11] to wear that medic you stuff or whatever
[57:16] you call it that stuff that they put on
[57:18] a face I know that's the wrong word but
[57:21] I can never think of it anyhow it used
[57:23] to be wrong for them to do such a thing
[57:25] it used to be wrong for Christians who
[57:27] were to Bob hair something went wrong
[57:30] somewhere the Bible says it's wrong now
[57:34] either you go out of the harness of your
[57:38] pastors got out of the will of God and
[57:41] quit preaching it but the truth and the
[57:44] Holy Spirit bears record for God that's
[57:46] right it used to be wrong for people to
[57:49] go out to the picture shows of
[57:51] entertainment of the world but today you
[57:56] can't tell one from the other people
[58:00] will miss prayer meeting and attain some
[58:02] kind of large meaning and how in the
[58:06] world can a Christian who calls
[58:09] themselves a child of God ever go to
[58:11] these places to eat and so forth these
[58:15] little old Nickelodeon's are playing
[58:17] rotten time in rock songs of Elvis and
[58:21] all these other things and being shook
[58:23] up you say you're gonna be all shook up
[58:25] one day for sure but hi not only young
[58:30] folks now not only you folks but Grandma
[58:35] and Grandpa does it that's right
[58:37] babysitter's while Mama and Papa is out
[58:40] getting a ride over the country Sunday
[58:43] morning they go to church with the long
[58:45] sanctimonious face what you need is a
[58:50] good old-fashioned Holy Spirit shaking
[58:52] it's what this country needs you know
[58:57] the truth and Oh years ago it used to be
[59:02] wrong for women to smoke cigarettes but
[59:05] it
[59:05] popular now and no matter how much the
[59:09] medical science says that there's car
[59:12] loads of cancer in every pack of
[59:14] cigarettes yeah they still do it you
[59:18] talk about feels my god
[59:22] a man so Church we see a man that day is
[59:31] a tutor and he is going back to the
[59:34] Father tell him everything
[59:38] amen that's the Holy Spirit now we see
[59:44] that the Holy Spirit is trying to get us
[59:46] to a point trying to get us to matthew
[59:49] 17:2 where we a man can can say this is
[59:55] my beloved son and and hear you him a
[1:00:00] man I want to just bring out the problem
[1:00:06] was talking about in the message you had
[1:00:11] the same message he knew him I believe
[1:00:13] it was how we we need to get back to the
[1:00:23] basics he was in a meeting and he said a
[1:00:29] meeting was so successful it was things
[1:00:35] that was happening in that meeting said
[1:00:37] was in Canada and a bunch of Indians but
[1:00:41] all during the song service there was a
[1:00:45] young girl who was outside the church in
[1:00:49] the field frame for the service she had
[1:00:56] got there and I will before service and
[1:01:00] she started praying for the service and
[1:01:03] she would pray clean through the song
[1:01:06] service and then she would come me he
[1:01:09] said that
[1:01:10] one thing alone made the difference made
[1:01:19] the difference we have a problem Church
[1:01:26] the reason I can read it I have it here
[1:01:29] he said the reason you don't see God
[1:01:32] moving the church is we treated like
[1:01:35] luster we come in late we don't come in
[1:01:41] with the right attitude we come in with
[1:01:44] little things on our minds and he say
[1:01:48] God is displeased with that he said he
[1:01:54] this is what he called it I wish I can
[1:01:55] find it right now but he said that
[1:01:58] coldness that coax up that starchiness
[1:02:02] that you feel he said it's because of
[1:02:06] your approach it's because of your
[1:02:11] project many know my testimony how I
[1:02:17] left the gospel for a while
[1:02:19] church i'ma tell you when I came back it
[1:02:23] took a little bit but I said this ain't
[1:02:25] the same message I left at first time I
[1:02:29] went over to the meeting immediately the
[1:02:33] preachers finished preaching it looked
[1:02:36] like intermission at the basketball game
[1:02:40] take the time to move that's the time
[1:02:46] the sense feeling wait for God
[1:02:55] had the deacon in that one side what my
[1:02:57] trunk I could say that I was how do you
[1:03:03] finish looking at your clock their
[1:03:10] preachers look at that your clock name
[1:03:12] I'm trying to get up out of here I got
[1:03:13] something to do
[1:03:13] I left a pot over all of a sudden what
[1:03:17] if the rapture happened in the morning
[1:03:19] you don't even get to eat that food
[1:03:23] it's our approach Saints it shows in
[1:03:30] second Kings I was heading somewhere but
[1:03:32] for sake of time I'm a just jumped
[1:03:34] forward
[1:03:34] he went onto me sick uh-uh
[1:03:39] your valley full of ditches go and dig
[1:03:46] your valley full of dishes he says that
[1:03:49] you were don't hear any thunder or rain
[1:03:51] but in the morning you'll wake up and
[1:03:53] those ditches would be full of war what
[1:03:55] does the water represent the Holy Ghost

[1:04:01] it's how deep you dig your ditch Heidi
[1:04:06] are you digging yo ditch how bad do you
[1:04:09] want it perfect I was talking about he's

[1:05:40] Holy Ghost my brothers and sisters not
[1:05:43] one time but a constant the rain come
[1:05:47] often upon earth often upon the earth
[1:05:53] let's change our attitude let's change
[1:05:57] our attitude about the gospel and we'll
[1:06:00] see God do something while families for
[1:06:04] us
[1:06:05] they'll keep brother Josue in prayer
[1:06:08] amen we expecting a miracle

[1:06:36] service time is at 7:30 let's break it
[1:06:40] down about 6:00 and going to prayer
[1:06:45] going to prayer have a real concern
[1:06:50] about the gospel there's so much work
[1:06:55] for us to do God want to do great things
[1:07:01] we was looking at Kings he said a double
[1:07:04] portion say that's what that's us say
[1:07:08] when we see him go he say come back it's
[1:07:10] a greater work shall we do that's our
[1:07:12] double portion
[1:07:16] we see him when he go see means to
[1:07:19] understand greater works that's the
[1:07:25] double portion but we see them it's our
[1:07:30] attitude immediately Elijah - and he
[1:07:36] said that the Lord God did it for look
[1:07:38] but Elijah you do it for me but he had
[1:07:44] to come with the same approach to the
[1:07:48] gospel god bless my auntie she wrote a
[1:07:54] song C common to you don't you let this
[1:07:59] gospel become common to you C key the
