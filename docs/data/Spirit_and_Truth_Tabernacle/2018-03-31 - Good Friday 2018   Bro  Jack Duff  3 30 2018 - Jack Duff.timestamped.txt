[30:48] [Music]
[30:55] I make this coupon
[30:58] I just wanted to take the opportunity to
[31:00] give God praise and glory he's done so
[31:04] much for me even know where to start
[31:07] but I guess the most recent thing I
[31:09] would say I thank God for the job that
[31:12] he blessed me with just came out of
[31:14] nowhere I really really love it
[31:17] it's a really important job I didn't
[31:19] realize it was that important till I got
[31:21] to it but for those of you don't know I
[31:25] work for the government and I'm a case
[31:29] manager so I'm in charge of keeping
[31:32] tuberculosis out of the community
[31:35] basically but I really love the job and
[31:38] it was tailor-made for me because while
[31:41] I was off for two years going through
[31:44] therapy you know I was praying to the
[31:47] Lord I need to get back to work I want
[31:48] to get back to work but I knew I
[31:50] couldn't go back doing patient care in
[31:53] the hospital because I can't lift the
[31:55] patient's so lord I need something that
[31:57] I can do well I don't have to lift
[31:58] patients but at the same time I don't
[32:01] have to sit all day because I can't sit
[32:03] for a long period of time either
[32:05] okay lord I don't know what kind of job
[32:07] this is but you know so I just was a
[32:09] plan you know I have no recollection of
[32:13] applying for this job in Fort Lauderdale
[32:14] I have no idea of how they got my resume
[32:16] but nevertheless they called me so and
[32:20] you know and it's just been a blessing
[32:22] ever since I've been there and I don't
[32:24] know why he has me going down there but
[32:26] you know I know it was for a reason so
[32:29] and I just pray that God will help me to
[32:34] be a light and just get myself out of
[32:37] the way that he may use me for a tool to
[32:39] be a blessing for somebody
[32:44] amen amen
[32:47] wonderful Savior amen I know sister
[32:50] Birds just walked in and but she has
[32:53] quite a testimony similar to that
[32:56] Amen about how to go Lord just blessed
[32:58] her with a a really a really good
[33:02] position I wonder honey if you want to
[33:05] give the testimony a man claims
[33:08] glory to God
[33:09] [Applause]
[33:19] I have been working for this agency
[33:29] it's a senior citizens AG's agency and
[33:33] their main purpose is to help seniors
[33:37] get back into the workplace and the
[33:41] positions that they send you out on
[33:44] they're not permanent he's supposed to
[33:47] constantly be looking for a job for a
[33:49] real job so I have been doing as they
[33:54] wanted me to do wasn't really looking
[33:56] for too hard but that was what I was
[34:00] supposed to do but anyway I have been
[34:04] going on a quite a few interviews and
[34:06] some of them really looked promising
[34:08] sounded promising but I guess once I got
[34:15] there to the different abuse they saw no
[34:17] matter what my qualification they told
[34:20] my age when they saw me and that really
[34:24] worked against me there really is age
[34:27] discrimination and it's kind of hard to
[34:30] swallow sometime but uh I came upon this
[34:36] ad for a position and Hospice about a
[34:40] couple of months ago and that's kind of
[34:42] half-heartedly said well I'll try that
[34:47] and I did one day at work about two
[34:53] weeks ago I got a call from a recruiter
[34:55] there at hospice and asked me if I was
[34:59] still interested in the position and I
[35:02] said yes yes I am so she explained all
[35:04] that it was to be for me and she says
[35:07] well you look like you know you have all
[35:09] the qualifications and I'm pretty sure
[35:12] this would be a good position for you
[35:13] now the position is for a clerk within
[35:17] the bereavement department that would
[35:20] assist the different counselors in
[35:21] meeting with families after their loved
[35:24] ones have deceased as part of the
[35:27] position and and it's something that
[35:29] really struck to my heart
[35:31] heart because when I was a volunteer for
[35:35] host hospice a couple years ago I really
[35:38] had a desire to become an employee there
[35:42] and different times I looked at
[35:45] positions that were open us maybe one
[35:48] day I'll I'll try that so I did try it
[35:51] so the recruiter called me on a Thursday
[35:54] then she called me back the following
[35:58] that know she coming back to a couple
[36:00] days and she said well I'm really gonna
[36:04] push your resume and your application
[36:07] through to the HR department
[36:11] she said just kind of want yours on top
[36:13] of everything else that's it well sure I
[36:14] thank you
[36:16] there kind of looked out of my heart I
[36:17] said once they seated a little old lady
[36:20] they may not worn it so they arranged
[36:23] for the interview I went to the
[36:25] interview last Monday and it went very
[36:28] well really really well I felt good
[36:31] about it they interviewed me like 10
[36:33] o'clock that morning and I knew that
[36:35] they had some more that afternoon didn't
[36:38] know how many more they would be doing
[36:39] but they did have some more so about 3
[36:42] o'clock I got a call from the recruiter
[36:46] again and she was a sister she said well
[36:49] how did it go I said well I thought it
[36:50] went well she said you should you sure
[36:52] you want the job here
[36:53] I say well I said yes I would I said I
[36:57] think it would be a good fit for me is
[37:00] something I deeply desire and I believe
[37:03] I'd be a good real good for your team so
[37:07] she says well I call you to offer you
[37:10] the job
[37:14] [Applause]
[37:21] she said yes they want they want to give
[37:25] you the job say yes I will take it I
[37:28] will take it
[37:29] so I will be starting with them on
[37:32] Monday and it's a part-time job that's
[37:34] that's as much as I want it I really
[37:36] didn't didn't want a full-time job

[37:41] I mean 9:00 to 1:00
[37:43] Monday through Friday just what I want
[37:45] and it's just the type of position that
[37:48] I want dealing with the people that I
[37:51] wanted I you know I I pray that God can
[37:53] use me there because it's a time when
[37:57] people the most vulnerable when they're
[38:00] going through their pain and and I just
[38:03] want to be a a light a blessing I'm
[38:05] Elena
[38:05] I truly thank the Lord for this to all
[38:07] the positions that I tried for I didn't
[38:10] get and I'm so glad that I didn't
[38:13] because that would have closed the door
[38:14] for this when so God knew what he knew
[38:16] what I wanted and he knew what he was
[38:19] preparing for me and I'm just so
[38:21] thankful really thankful for that and
[38:24] you'll keep me in your prayers
[38:25] amen hey man ain't God good wonderful
[38:34] Savior anybody else amen
[38:47] her standard I just want to thank a last
[38:55] semester I found out that this this
[38:57] current semester I was gonna have to
[38:59] take an internship through my English
[39:00] Program at school and there was a
[39:04] certain amount of hours that I have to
[39:06] work on my internship every week in
[39:09] order to meet the requirement and with
[39:13] my job and with school it was gonna be
[39:16] really hard for me to meet that
[39:17] requirement so I just worked it out with
[39:21] my schedule but it was a very hectic
[39:23] schedule sorry there were days I would
[39:28] go to work and then go to my internship
[39:30] and then go school or whatever it was
[39:32] just a lot going on every day and and I
[39:36] was getting extremely worn out by and I
[39:39] was sitting at my desk one day at the
[39:41] internship just thinking like okay I
[39:43] need to talk to my professor and just
[39:46] tell her I don't think that this is
[39:47] working out this semester maybe I hope
[39:48] to save it for the summer or something I
[39:50] just I don't know if I can handle all
[39:52] this and that day as I was getting ready
[39:56] to leave the lady who was training me at
[40:00] the internship she walked me outside and
[40:02] she never did that like she always just
[40:04] say Oh bye I have to let myself out type
[40:06] of thing so she walked me to the door
[40:09] and she took me outside with her and she
[40:11] was like I know you said you have a job
[40:13] but we're looking for a full-time writer
[40:17] here and you have been doing a really
[40:19] great job and we were wondering if
[40:21] you're interested and I have been there
[40:23] for a little less than two weeks and I
[40:26] had a lot to learn very very interesting
[40:31] position something I've never thought
[40:33] about but it definitely uses my degree
[40:36] and and she said you know we'd like for
[40:40] you to quit chick-fil-a so you can work
[40:42] here and I kind of like about quitting
[40:45] my job now know y'all yet so but but the
[40:49] more that I worked there and interned
[40:51] there I realized that I felt I felt like
[40:56] I was really supposed to be there
[40:57] especially because
[40:59] I've been kind of wondering what I was
[41:01] going to do when I graduated I knew I
[41:03] wanted to do something in my field of
[41:04] study but I wasn't quite sure what and
[41:07] and as I was just kind of working
[41:10] through it I was trying to figure out
[41:11] what I should do just some different
[41:13] things started changing on the job at
[41:16] chick-fil-a to where I I just honestly
[41:18] felt like it was time to leave and I
[41:21] didn't quite know what to do but I just
[41:23] prayed about it and I you know I one
[41:28] thing that I really needed was
[41:29] flexibility especially because I'm not
[41:32] done with school I really want to finish
[41:34] school and I don't want anybody to or
[41:36] anything to take away from my studies
[41:40] especially because I'm so close to the
[41:41] end and so I told the internship I told
[41:45] them I said you know I I do want to
[41:46] finish school and I do have classes that
[41:48] I'll have to take next semester as well
[41:50] and I'll need to be able to do that and
[41:54] she said well well let me talk to you
[41:56] let me talk to the owner and we'll see
[41:57] what he says the owner and his wife had
[42:00] to sit down with me and they said well
[42:01] what can you give us I told them the
[42:03] hours that I could work and they say
[42:05] well what we'll do is we'll bring you on
[42:08] and you work whenever you want to work
[42:10] you can work from home if you need to
[42:13] we'll pay you for that just make sure
[42:15] you tell us what hours you do and at the
[42:18] end of the week just send us a log of
[42:19] what you've been doing throughout the
[42:21] week and you'll be fine and whenever you
[42:23] graduate let us know and we'll put you
[42:25] will put you full-time and so I I am so
[42:29] thankful for that because these people
[42:31] don't know me at all they don't know if
[42:33] I'm gonna be honest with my hours and
[42:35] all of that but they told me I don't
[42:36] care what you do as long as you get the
[42:38] work done you know if you need to just
[42:40] take your work home and you can't finish
[42:41] it here just do that and if you don't
[42:44] have time to work at home that's fine do
[42:45] what you can in the office and and they
[42:48] they told me you know that basically
[42:50] whatever I needed from them I could have
[42:52] and I'm really really thankful for that
[42:54] so I thank God for a new job

[55:46] sinners like us how grateful we are Lord

[55:54] why we come to worship tonight we we

[56:38] praise
[56:39] [Applause]
[56:44] please the Lord can be seated thank you
[56:47] musicians I appreciate amen
[56:50] your service tonight my heart is a man
[56:57] just a little torn with a number of
[57:00] things that I have to minister own but I
[57:05] feel that it is most important for us to
[57:13] just go back and read what is Good
[57:17] Friday all about and then what what is
[57:20] what is Good Friday all about and the
[57:24] Gospels amen tell us the story and I
[57:27] chose a man to read from the book of
[57:30] mark 14 I'm gonna just accent you remain
[57:35] seated because this is a very lengthy a
[57:38] man scripture that will read and I don't
[57:42] want to have you standing all the way
[57:45] through it but I don't want to shortcut
[57:48] it either a man so I want to read from
[57:52] there and I had a couple other things
[57:53] that I had but maybe the Lord might turn
[57:58] that and will go a different direction
[58:00] we'll see what the Lord has but when we
[58:04] talk about Good Friday a man as
[58:08] Christians Amen this is a very important
[58:13] date just one of the greatest days to
[58:18] the Christian faith a man and and if
[58:21] there is ever time to go to church this
[58:27] is the weekend that you go right Amen
[58:30] then it an honor of what our Lord and
[58:32] Savior did for us nobody else could do
[58:36] it no no but nobody amen no no great
[58:41] preacher no profit no apostille no
[58:46] disciple nobody else could do this but
[58:49] the Lord Jesus Christ a man and
[58:52] and brother Ram said that God made the
[58:54] penalty so great that nobody could pay
[58:58] it only he himself could pay this price
[59:02] for us so if he is he is worthy of the
[59:09] glory he's worthy of the honor
[59:11] he's worthy of the priests and and and
[59:14] we need to give it to him Amen because
[59:17] he he he's done so much for us Amen but
[59:21] here I want to just pick up a man out of
[59:24] mark 14 and I am starting at verse 32
[59:32] and this is the Lord has just had
[59:37] communion with the disciples and
[59:42] actually a start at verse 26 after after
[59:45] communion the Bible tells us this that
[59:49] when they had sung a hymn they went out
[59:53] into the Mount of Olives jesus saith
[59:56] unto them o ye look at all the disciples
[1:00:02] all ye should be offended because of me
[1:00:04] this night for it is written I will
[1:00:08] smite the Shepherd and the Sheep shall
[1:00:10] be scattered but after that I am risen I
[1:00:14] will go before you into Galilee the
[1:00:18] Peter said unto Him although all shall
[1:00:21] be offended yet will not I write and
[1:00:25] this is Peter you know now Jesus has
[1:00:27] said everybody but Peter want to stand
[1:00:29] up and say not me I'm not gonna be
[1:00:31] offended in three sets verse 30 says and
[1:00:34] Jesus said unto Him verily I say unto
[1:00:35] thee that this day even in this night
[1:00:40] before the crow twice thou shalt
[1:00:44] deny me thrice so he's prophesying and
[1:00:47] telling him every everything that's
[1:00:49] gonna happen but he spake the more
[1:00:51] vehemently if I should die with thee I
[1:00:55] would not deny thee in any wise likewise
[1:00:58] also said they all but he's already told
[1:01:00] them what was getting ready to happen a
[1:01:02] verse 32 says and they came to a place
[1:01:04] which was named
[1:01:05] gethsemane and he said to his disciples
[1:01:09] sit ye here while I shall pray and he
[1:01:13] taketh with him Peter and James and John
[1:01:15] and began to be sore amazed and to be
[1:01:18] very heavy and saith unto them my soul
[1:01:22] is exceeding sorrowful unto death tarry
[1:01:26] ye here and watch and he went forward a
[1:01:29] little and fell on the ground and prayed
[1:01:31] that if it were possible the hour might
[1:01:35] pass from him Amen if it were possible
[1:01:39] the hour might pass from him now if I
[1:01:42] can I pray the Lord will help us you
[1:01:44] know get in there but I want to just
[1:01:46] drop this but I was listening to this
[1:01:49] sermon that day on Calvary and and
[1:01:52] brother Branham made a comment there he
[1:01:55] said that not just it wasn't just Jesus
[1:01:59] a man that had a Calvary a man but he
[1:02:03] says that every Son of God must have
[1:02:08] their day at Calvary and and what that
[1:02:12] means is that there'll be some things
[1:02:14] that's gonna come in your life the way
[1:02:16] that this came in the Lord Jesus life
[1:02:18] and you're gonna be praying and asking
[1:02:20] God to remove that thing from you but
[1:02:23] you're gonna have to get to a point
[1:02:24] where you're gonna have to humble
[1:02:25] yourself to the will of God and say Lord
[1:02:27] not my will but your will be done
[1:02:30] amen you got to have your own Calvary
[1:02:33] something that will shake you down
[1:02:36] hallelujah it will try your Christianity
[1:02:39] right but we all as believers have to
[1:02:42] have our own Calvary a man you can't run
[1:02:44] from it all right but he goes on to say
[1:02:47] this it says verse 35 and he went
[1:02:50] forward a little and fell on the ground
[1:02:52] and prayed that if it were possible the
[1:02:54] hour might pass from him and he said
[1:02:56] Abba Father all things are possible unto
[1:02:58] thee take away there's cut for me
[1:03:00] nevertheless not what I will but what
[1:03:03] thou wilt and he cometh and findeth them
[1:03:06] sleeping and saith unto Peter Simon
[1:03:08] sleep is down could it's not thou watch
[1:03:10] one hour watch II and pray the less she
[1:03:15] enter into temptation the Spirit truly
[1:03:18] is ready
[1:03:19] the flesh is weak and again he went and
[1:03:22] went away and prayed and speak the same
[1:03:24] words and when he returned he found them
[1:03:26] asleep again for the eyes were heavy
[1:03:29] neither whist day what to answer him any
[1:03:32] Kenney and he cometh the third time I
[1:03:35] said unto them sleep on now and take
[1:03:37] your rest
[1:03:38] it is enough the hours come behold the
[1:03:40] Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of
[1:03:42] sinners rise up let us go lo he that
[1:03:46] betrayeth me is at hand
[1:03:47] and notice now it says and immediately
[1:03:50] while he yet spake cometh Judas one of
[1:03:52] the twelve with him a great multitude
[1:03:54] with swords and staves from the chief
[1:03:57] priests and the scribes and the elders
[1:03:58] and he that betrayed him had given them
[1:04:01] a token saying whomsoever I shall kiss
[1:04:03] that same as he take him and lead him
[1:04:06] away safely so when we come into church
[1:04:08] especially on this Good Friday night
[1:04:10] this is the event that we have in our
[1:04:13] hearts and in our minds this what
[1:04:15] happened to the Lord Jesus you know so
[1:04:17] going let's go into says and they they
[1:04:19] laid their hands on him and took him did
[1:04:22] I skip verse 45 all right it says and as
[1:04:25] soon as he was become he going straight
[1:04:26] way to him and said master master and
[1:04:28] kissed him and they laid their hands on
[1:04:30] him and took him and one of them that
[1:04:33] stood by drew a sword and smote a
[1:04:35] servant of the high priest and cut off
[1:04:37] his ear and jesus answered and said unto
[1:04:39] Him are you come out as against a thief
[1:04:41] with swords and with stage to take me I
[1:04:43] was daily with you in the temple
[1:04:45] teaching and you took me not but the
[1:04:48] Scriptures must be fulfilled and they
[1:04:51] all forsook him and fled this is what he
[1:04:54] just told them they would do they all
[1:04:55] forsook him and fled and there followed
[1:04:58] him a certain young man having a linen
[1:05:00] cloth cast about his naked body and the
[1:05:03] young man laid hold on him and he left
[1:05:05] the linen cloth and fled from them naked
[1:05:09] and they led Jesus away to the high
[1:05:12] priest and with him were assembled all
[1:05:16] the chief priests and the elders and the
[1:05:17] scribes and Peter followed him afar off
[1:05:20] even into the palace of the high priest
[1:05:22] and he sent with the servants and warmed
[1:05:24] himself at the fire and the chief
[1:05:26] priests and all the council sought for
[1:05:29] witness against Jesus to put him to
[1:05:31] death and found none
[1:05:32] for many many bear false witness against
[1:05:35] him but their witness agreed not
[1:05:37] together and there rose certain and bear
[1:05:40] false witness against him saying we
[1:05:41] heard him say I would destroy this
[1:05:44] temple that is made with hands and
[1:05:46] within three days I will build another
[1:05:47] made without hands but neither so did
[1:05:51] their witness agree together and the
[1:05:54] high priest stood up in the midst in axe
[1:05:55] Jesus saying answerest thou nothing what
[1:05:59] is it which these witness against thee
[1:06:01] but he held his peace and answered
[1:06:04] nothing again the high priest acts him
[1:06:06] and said unto Him aren't thou the Christ
[1:06:08] the Son of the Blessed and Jesus said I
[1:06:11] am and ye shall see the Son of man
[1:06:13] sitting on the right hand of power and
[1:06:14] coming in the clouds of heaven then the
[1:06:17] high priest rented clothes and saith
[1:06:19] what what need we any further witness
[1:06:22] now according to scripture the high
[1:06:23] priest was not supposed to tear his
[1:06:25] clothes like that he actually broke the
[1:06:27] word by doing what he just did alright
[1:06:29] so you have heard the blasphemy what
[1:06:31] think ye and they all condemned him to
[1:06:34] be guilty of death and some began to
[1:06:36] spit on him think about this this is our
[1:06:39] Lord and Savior a man on Good Friday
[1:06:42] this is what this was the treatment that
[1:06:45] was given to him some began to spit on
[1:06:47] him and to cover his face and to buff it
[1:06:49] him and to say unto Him prophesy and the
[1:06:52] service did strike him with the palms of
[1:06:54] their hands and as Peter was beneath in
[1:06:57] the palace there cometh one of the midst
[1:06:59] of one of the maids of the high priests
[1:07:01] and when she saw Peter warming himself
[1:07:03] she looked upon him and said and thou
[1:07:05] also was with Jesus of Nazareth but he
[1:07:08] did not say I know not and I don't
[1:07:10] understand I what thou sayeth and he
[1:07:13] went out in the porch and the crew
[1:07:15] any animate saw him again and began to
[1:07:18] say to them that stood by this is one of
[1:07:21] them and he denied it again and a little
[1:07:23] after they that stood by said again to
[1:07:27] Peter surely thou art one of them for
[1:07:29] thou are a gal aaliyan and thy speech
[1:07:32] agree there too but he began to curse
[1:07:35] and to swear he changed this language
[1:07:39] because of the situation but he began to
[1:07:43] curse and to swear saying I know not
[1:07:45] this man of who
[1:07:46] you speak and the second time the
[1:07:50] crew and Peter called to mind the word
[1:07:53] that Jesus said unto him before the
[1:07:56] crew crow twice thou shalt deny me
[1:08:00] thrice thrice and when he went and went
[1:08:04] and when he thought there on he wept
[1:08:07] now if oh my y'all just stay with me I
[1:08:12] want to keep reading here going on the
[1:08:14] chapter 15 in a straight way in the
[1:08:16] morning the chief priest held a
[1:08:17] consultation with the elders and scribes
[1:08:19] and the whole council and bound Jesus
[1:08:22] and carried him away and delivered him
[1:08:24] to Pilate Pilate acts him are without a
[1:08:27] king of the Jews and and and he
[1:08:29] answering said unto Him thou sayest it
[1:08:31] and the chief priests accuse him of many
[1:08:33] things but he answered nothing and
[1:08:36] Pilate acts him against answering saying
[1:08:38] answerest thou nothing big bow behold
[1:08:40] how many things they witness against
[1:08:42] thee but Jesus yet answered nothing so
[1:08:45] that Pilate marvelled now at the feast
[1:08:48] he released unto them one prisoner
[1:08:50] whomsoever they desired and there was
[1:08:53] one named Barabbas which lay bound with
[1:08:56] them that had made insurrection with him
[1:08:59] who had committed murder in the
[1:09:00] insurrection and again many of you all
[1:09:03] know Barabbas first name was Jesus they
[1:09:07] meant his name was Jesus Barabbas and
[1:09:10] you know the problem here is that they
[1:09:12] chose the wrong Jesus how they lose you
[1:09:15] a man they chose the wrong Jesus so they
[1:09:18] wanted Jesus Barabbas which was a
[1:09:21] murderer rather than Jesus to Christ
[1:09:23] which was a redeemer and a savior look
[1:09:26] at this verse verse 8 and you know even
[1:09:29] today we're still choosing the wrong
[1:09:31] things right we need that we need that
[1:09:33] we need to choose Christ a man don't
[1:09:36] choose the world choose Christ and the
[1:09:38] multitude crying hallelujah choose
[1:09:41] Christ amen
[1:09:43] you know oftentimes young people they
[1:09:46] get to a certain age Amen in life and
[1:09:49] they feel like once I cross this
[1:09:50] threshold I can do whatever I want to do
[1:09:52] when you get to the threshold choose
[1:09:54] Christ's a man don't don't choose the
[1:09:57] world choose Christ amen some do it at
[1:10:00] twenty-one some do it at 18 but choose
[1:10:02] Christ's when you get to that threshold
[1:10:04] choose Christ praise the Lord don't
[1:10:06] choose the world choose Christ alright
[1:10:09] verse eight and says that and the
[1:10:11] multitude crying aloud began to desire
[1:10:13] him to do as he had ever done unto them
[1:10:16] and but Pilate answered them saying will
[1:10:19] ye then I release him to you the King of
[1:10:21] the Jews for he knew that the chief
[1:10:24] priests had delivered him for envy he
[1:10:26] detected their spirit right but the
[1:10:29] chief priest moved the people that he
[1:10:32] should rather release Barabbas unto them
[1:10:34] and Pilate answered and said again unto
[1:10:36] them what will you then that I shall do
[1:10:39] unto him whom he called the king of the
[1:10:41] Jews and they cried out again crucify
[1:10:44] him this is this is Good Friday then
[1:10:48] Pilate said unto them why what evil hath
[1:10:51] he done and they cried out the more
[1:10:53] exceedingly crucify him and so Pilate
[1:10:57] willing to content the people released
[1:11:00] Barabbas unto them and delivered Jesus
[1:11:03] when he had scourge him to be crucified
[1:11:06] and the soldiers led him away into the
[1:11:09] hall call Praetorian and they called
[1:11:11] together the whole band and they clothed
[1:11:14] him with purple and planted a crown of
[1:11:15] thorns and put it about his head and
[1:11:18] began to salute him hail King of the
[1:11:20] Jews
[1:11:20] and they smote him on the head with a
[1:11:23] reed and did spit upon him and bowing
[1:11:26] their knees worshipped him they were
[1:11:28] mocking our Lord and when they had
[1:11:30] mocked him they took off the purple from
[1:11:33] him and put his own clothes on him and
[1:11:37] led him out to crucify him and they
[1:11:39] compared one Simon a Cyrenian who passed
[1:11:42] by coming out of the country the father
[1:11:44] of Alexander and Rufus to bear his cross
[1:11:47] and they bring him unto the place called
[1:11:50] Gotham which is being interpreted the
[1:11:52] place of a skull and they gave him to
[1:11:55] drink wine mingled with mirth but he
[1:11:58] received it not and when they had
[1:12:00] crucified him they parted his garments
[1:12:02] casting Lots upon them or whatever what
[1:12:05] every man should take and it was the
[1:12:08] third hour and they crucified him and
[1:12:11] the superscription of his acuse
[1:12:13] was written over the king over the king
[1:12:16] of the Jews and with him they crucified
[1:12:19] two thieves the one on his right hand
[1:12:21] and the other on his left and this and
[1:12:23] the scripture was fulfilled which saith
[1:12:25] he was numbered with the transgressors
[1:12:27] and then and they that passed by railed
[1:12:30] on him wagging their heads and saying ah
[1:12:33] thou that destroys the temple and
[1:12:35] buildest it in three days save thyself
[1:12:37] and come down from the cross likewise
[1:12:40] also the chief priests mocking said
[1:12:42] among themselves with the scribes he
[1:12:44] saved others himself he cannot save let
[1:12:48] Christ the King of Israel descend now
[1:12:50] from the cross that we may see and
[1:12:52] believe and they that were crucified
[1:12:54] with him revived him and when the sixth
[1:12:58] hour was come there was darkness over
[1:13:00] the whole land until the ninth hour and
[1:13:02] see there was never a day like this day
[1:13:05] brother Branham say there was never day
[1:13:07] like it and there never will be a day
[1:13:09] after that was like this day says that
[1:13:12] look at the Sun Sun went down you know
[1:13:14] in the middle of the day here the Bible
[1:13:16] said when the six hours come live
[1:13:17] darkness over the earth the whole land
[1:13:19] the whole land until the ninth hour and
[1:13:22] at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a
[1:13:24] loud voice ting LOI LOI lama sabachthani
[1:13:29] which is being interpreted my God my God
[1:13:33] why hast thou forsaken me now it's being
[1:13:35] interpreted they don't know what he
[1:13:37] actually said now I have a statement
[1:13:40] hopefully I can get to it here in a
[1:13:41] little bit but they don't know what he
[1:13:43] said they're saying it's being
[1:13:44] interpreted okay it's being interpreted
[1:13:47] my God my God why hast thou forsaken me
[1:13:50] and some of them that stood by when they
[1:13:52] heard it said the holy calleth Elisha
[1:13:55] and one ran and filled a spunge full of
[1:13:57] vinegar and put it on a reed and gave
[1:13:59] him the drink saying let alone let us
[1:14:01] see whether your logic will come to take
[1:14:03] him down and Jesus cried with a loud
[1:14:05] voice and gave up the ghosts and the
[1:14:08] veil of the temple was rent in twain
[1:14:10] from the top to the bottom
[1:14:11] and whether its interior which stood
[1:14:14] over against him saw that he's so cried
[1:14:17] out and gave up the ghost he said truly
[1:14:18] this man was the son
[1:14:23] god I want to just hit a couple things
[1:14:28] here if I can I'm gonna read from the
[1:14:33] sermon that day on Calvary and I'm gonna
[1:14:37] start here at paragraph 66 and if you
[1:14:41] all bear with me we will go as far as we
[1:14:44] can tonight I got I got something else
[1:14:49] that I wanted to present on Sunday but
[1:14:51] we'll just see what the Lord what the
[1:14:53] Lord does I'll go as far as I can
[1:14:55] tonight and I might have to pick up some
[1:14:57] of this and bring it in and bring it
[1:14:59] into Sunday amen as well but we just
[1:15:03] give it to the Lord
[1:15:04] but tonight being Good Friday we just
[1:15:07] want to just take a little time and just
[1:15:08] just just focus on amen on that tonight
[1:15:11] the Prophet says this and and this
[1:15:14] message that day on Calvary says Abraham
[1:15:16] don't have to wander no more cross the
[1:15:19] country seeking a city
[1:15:21] it says the sinner don't have to wander
[1:15:23] anymore whether he can be saved or not
[1:15:27] the sick man doesn't have to wonder
[1:15:29] whether he can be healed or not right
[1:15:32] because of what happened at Calvary we
[1:15:33] don't have to wander about saying when I
[1:15:35] have to wander a man about about
[1:15:37] sickness amen all those things were
[1:15:39] taken care of at Calvary he says the
[1:15:42] opening veil on that day at Calvary
[1:15:44] revealed the way to total victory God
[1:15:48] give us the powers of his spirit to live
[1:15:51] triumphantly over all of these things
[1:15:54] ask only access to do access only to
[1:15:57] believe it that happened on that day at
[1:16:00] Calvary there never was a day like it
[1:16:03] there never will be one like it it is
[1:16:06] not necessary no more the price is paid
[1:16:10] and we are redeemed thanks be to God we
[1:16:14] are redeemed he said there's no way you
[1:16:18] have to wonder about there's no more
[1:16:20] guessing about it it's all took away the
[1:16:24] veil pulled back the curtain and we're
[1:16:26] set on a highway not to wander anymore
[1:16:28] but to believe and just walk right on
[1:16:31] we'll walk right into the into God's
[1:16:33] very presence Amen everything was
[1:16:36] settled
[1:16:37] at Calvary now it makes it I'm gonna
[1:16:39] just hit some comments here a man that
[1:16:42] we pulling from that del cavalry
[1:16:44] it says if this day being so important
[1:16:48] one of the greatest days he says let us
[1:16:51] look at it three different things that
[1:16:53] that they meant to us let's look at it
[1:16:56] we're going to look at three different
[1:16:57] things as to why you know you say
[1:16:59] there's thousands of things we can look
[1:17:00] at but he chose three things and he said
[1:17:02] let's focus on those three things to
[1:17:04] show what that day actually means to us
[1:17:06] the first thing he says it's settled the
[1:17:10] same question hallelujah Calvary settled
[1:17:14] the same question the reason it's a good
[1:17:16] Friday to me right because it's settled
[1:17:20] the same question right sin started in
[1:17:23] heaven and you can you can get ready
[1:17:26] from the revelations twenty and ten see
[1:17:28] it don't pull it up yet I'll tell you
[1:17:29] when to pull it up but but sin started
[1:17:31] in heaven the privacy when Lucifer was
[1:17:35] given the preeminence is to make his
[1:17:37] choice he wanted something better than
[1:17:40] God and that started the trouble he says
[1:17:43] but the Bible said the soul that sinneth
[1:17:46] it shall surely die not the man that
[1:17:50] sinneth but the soul that sinneth and he
[1:17:53] goes on the city says so
[1:17:55] so Satan must surely die to be
[1:18:00] completely destroyed hallelujah it's
[1:18:03] settled the same question he says Satan
[1:18:05] must surely die to be completely
[1:18:07] destroyed uh saying we found that in
[1:18:09] Revelation 20 and 10 look at this a and
[1:18:11] the devil that deceived them was cast
[1:18:15] into the lake of fire and brimstone
[1:18:17] where the beast and the false prophet
[1:18:19] are and shall be tormented day and night
[1:18:22] forever and ever
[1:18:24] Satan will come to an end a man Satan
[1:18:28] started this unbelief Satan started this
[1:18:30] sin and Satan's gonna have to die for it
[1:18:33] now you can see what Satan was trying to
[1:18:35] do he knew that you know what his
[1:18:37] penalty was some but he also knew that
[1:18:38] there was a penalty for sin in the
[1:18:40] garden oh y'all y'all stay with me here
[1:18:43] tonight the penalty with sin was death
[1:18:45] God established that in Genesis 2 and 17
[1:18:48] hallelujah y'all just go with me on
[1:18:51] journey tonight through Scripture God a
[1:18:53] step if with the penalty for sin was
[1:18:55] death
[1:18:56] Satan established it Satan sinned in
[1:18:59] heaven Satan will die for his sin
[1:19:02] hallelujah amen if since he knows that
[1:19:05] he's going to die he's trying to bring
[1:19:07] some other people into it with them now
[1:19:10] imma tell you something when people get
[1:19:11] involved in seeing they don't like to go
[1:19:13] down by himself they like to try to
[1:19:16] bring other people into a rhythm and
[1:19:18] Satanist ROM that brings some people
[1:19:20] into it with them but count early set
[1:19:25] you free from that you ain't got you
[1:19:27] ain't got a joint Satan's gang you can
[1:19:29] follow Jesus Christ hallelujah Genesis
[1:19:33] 2:17 this is where God establish the
[1:19:36] penalty for sin says by the tree of
[1:19:38] knowledge of good and evil thou shalt
[1:19:40] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[1:19:43] eatest thereof thou shalt surely die
[1:19:46] right so if they if they if they
[1:19:48] disbelieve the Word of God they come
[1:19:50] from behind the Word of God it will
[1:19:52] produce death amen I understand that law
[1:19:55] that God just gave Adam a man that law
[1:19:59] always existed their law didn't just
[1:20:02] come into coming to come into place when
[1:20:06] God put it in Genesis - oh I hope y'all
[1:20:09] with me now let me just let me let me go
[1:20:12] back a little further Moses is the one
[1:20:15] that told us what happened in Genesis
[1:20:17] but now how did Adam know that law when
[1:20:21] Moses it was not even written in
[1:20:23] Scripture we didn't have a Bible before
[1:20:25] Moses come along and wrote these things
[1:20:26] that law always existed in God's mind
[1:20:29] and not only did the law existing God's
[1:20:31] mine for the earth that law existed for
[1:20:33] Satan in heaven that's why the purpose
[1:20:37] said that he has to die as well he was
[1:20:40] the one these are one that committed sin
[1:20:42] in the beginning he has to die for his
[1:20:45] sin but you ain't got a time for yours
[1:20:47] because Christ went to Calvary and died
[1:20:49] for yours oh you don't know what
[1:20:52] Redemption means a man you don't have to
[1:20:55] worry Church it meant you in a good spot
[1:20:57] tonight but Satan got a lot to worry
[1:20:59] about and he's trying to pull some
[1:21:00] people in with all glory to God look at
[1:21:03] that the penalty
[1:21:04] sin was death now that we just read here
[1:21:06] in Genesis 2:17 but let me get Romans
[1:21:08] 5:17 amen it says this for if by one
[1:21:12] man's offense death reigned by one much
[1:21:16] more they which receive abundance of
[1:21:19] grace and of the gift of righteousness
[1:21:22] shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ
[1:21:27] amen I'm no longer under Amen just just
[1:21:30] because of what Adam did when he sold us
[1:21:32] out to sin
[1:21:33] amen and yes he's certainly I mean death
[1:21:36] settled in for the for humankind and
[1:21:38] Satan probably thought man I got him
[1:21:40] down because death is sudden but Jesus
[1:21:42] took the keys of death hell and the
[1:21:44] grave right so we don't have to fear
[1:21:46] death anymore the same question has been
[1:21:48] settled amen the bill has been settled
[1:21:52] with God that's what Jesus did at
[1:21:54] Calvary look at this and in our wrong
[1:21:56] and in Psalms 51 and five and I just got
[1:21:59] a few scriptures that I want to read to
[1:22:01] you a man to show you that it has been
[1:22:04] settled and first of all we got to
[1:22:06] acknowledge that we are sinners amen we
[1:22:08] are sinners and we need at this price to
[1:22:11] be paid Christ paid that price Psalm 51
[1:22:14] and five establishes behold I was shapen
[1:22:17] in iniquity and in sin did my mother
[1:22:21] conceive me hallelujah we have to
[1:22:24] establish that we are sinners and Romans
[1:22:27] 3:23 also tells us this for all have
[1:22:31] sinned and come short of the glory of
[1:22:35] God even if you were born on the back
[1:22:37] peel of the church you still a sinner
[1:22:39] and you needed a savior
[1:22:41] hallelujah calimary produced the Savior
[1:22:44] amen
[1:22:45] Romans 5:8 tells us this says but God
[1:22:49] commendeth his love toward us in that
[1:22:51] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[1:22:57] for us a man what a beautiful picture
[1:23:01] right while we were yet sinners Christ
[1:23:05] already died for us now Satan don't have
[1:23:08] their testimony but I got that testimony
[1:23:11] that's what Calvary means for me that
[1:23:13] cry
[1:23:14] took my place before I was even born
[1:23:16] before I knew what he had done for me
[1:23:19] all the sin that I had a meant that I
[1:23:22] had committed it was felt and God's
[1:23:25] account it was already settled
[1:23:28] hallelujah glory to God I came from God
[1:23:31] and I'm going back to God hallelujah
[1:23:34] hallelujah hallelujah look at this he
[1:23:37] also says this and Isaiah 1:18
[1:23:40] says come now and let us reason together
[1:23:44] saith the Lord though your sins be as
[1:23:47] scarlet they shall be white as snow
[1:23:49] though they be red like crimson they
[1:23:53] shall be as wool see Calvary it's
[1:23:57] settled the same question we can
[1:24:00] approach God Amen we can come to God
[1:24:03] because he wants to watch us from our
[1:24:06] stands brother Branham also said the
[1:24:08] second thing Calvary provided a
[1:24:10] deathblow to Satan
[1:24:12] he says Calvary provided a deathblow he
[1:24:16] also say it broke the Devils back now
[1:24:19] i'ma tell you when your back is broken a
[1:24:21] much you can do it's pretty hard to get
[1:24:25] around it's been pretty hard to do
[1:24:27] anything you can't get up when you got
[1:24:29] problems with the back right and the
[1:24:31] Devils back has been broken
[1:24:34] Calvary broke his back ain't no sis's
[1:24:38] not sparing a gavel to broke back he
[1:24:40] can't even fight ain't nothing he can do
[1:24:44] right and Calvary broke the Devils back
[1:24:47] Oh glory to God they want one thing I
[1:24:50] tell you Calvary did it released us from
[1:24:52] the fear of death no longer are we
[1:24:56] afraid to die as believers actually we
[1:24:59] come to understand that we don't die we
[1:25:02] sleep Oh glory to God thank God for
[1:25:06] Calvary
[1:25:07] can we pull up 1st Corinthians 15 verse
[1:25:10] 55 halleluiah look at this he said Oh
[1:25:13] death where is thy sting o grave where
[1:25:16] is thy victory the sting of death is sin

[1:26:17] not our backs but his back is broken be
[1:26:19] working for the Lord Calvary produced
[1:26:21] that if there's a quote that I want to
[1:26:24] just read here out of that day on
[1:26:26] Calvary I'm at paragraph 69 hallelujah
[1:26:29] and now this goes back to what we were
[1:26:32] saying a man when Jesus was on the cross
[1:26:34] and he began to scream I LOI LOI lama
[1:26:40] sabachthani and the scripture says it
[1:26:42] was being in which is being interpreted
[1:26:44] my God my God why hast thou forsaken me
[1:26:46] now the Prophet introduces something
[1:26:48] says that that was a deathblow of
[1:26:50] Satan's power - Satan's power he says it
[1:26:53] ended everything and I can see him there
[1:26:56] he was
[1:26:57] Eden's lamb from the very first shadow
[1:27:00] that come of it
[1:27:02] when Abel by faith offered unto God a
[1:27:04] more excellent sacrifice than King he
[1:27:07] must have tied a grape vine around a
[1:27:10] lambs neck drugged him up to the rock
[1:27:13] took a rock in his hand for a lamps and
[1:27:17] pulled this little head back and chopped
[1:27:20] and hacked him until he died and his
[1:27:23] wool bathe with his own blood he wallow
[1:27:27] in his and in his blood it was a shadow
[1:27:31] this is how about Abel and Abel offering
[1:27:33] God a lamb he spent but on that day at
[1:27:36] Calvary there wasn't a lamb of this
[1:27:37] earth but it was a lamb
[1:27:39] God that was dying wallowing in his own
[1:27:42] butt
[1:27:42] blood he what he has he was hacked and
[1:27:45] chopped and beat and and spit on and
[1:27:48] slammed and and smacked and everything
[1:27:50] by the world and the blood dripping off
[1:27:52] of his locks when Abel's lamb died it
[1:27:56] died speaking in a language that Abel
[1:27:59] cannot understand it was bleeding and
[1:28:02] when God's lamb died that dead Calvary
[1:28:05] he spoke in a language that no one
[1:28:08] understood him my God my God why hast
[1:28:12] thou forsaken me it was God's lamb
[1:28:15] hacked to pieces
[1:28:16] chopped up he was a very lamb that Abel
[1:28:20] had in mind when he seen the promised
[1:28:23] seed of the woman he was the Lamb that
[1:28:25] Daniel saw that was hewn out of the
[1:28:27] mountain without hands he was the wheel
[1:28:29] in the middle of the wheel for the
[1:28:30] Prophet all they had foresaw was meant
[1:28:33] on that day at Calvary that brought the
[1:28:35] great thing in that broke the back of
[1:28:38] Satan see when when Abel's lamb start
[1:28:42] bleeding Athy was f he was there on the
[1:28:45] altar there in Genesis brother Branham
[1:28:48] say he spoke in a language that they're
[1:28:50] able could not understand and say the
[1:28:52] same Lamb of God as he was there on the
[1:28:54] cross when he cried out ello ello ello
[1:28:56] by loi suboxone he spoke in a language
[1:28:59] that nobody understood because the same
[1:29:02] Lamb he was a type of the same land that
[1:29:04] Abel offered hallelujah he was that same
[1:29:07] he was that lamb for us oh my that's why
[1:29:12] he that's why he spoke those words lol
[1:29:14] oh by soo bahk Denis Amen a perfect
[1:29:17] landing you all remember you remember
[1:29:20] there was a skull do you remember there
[1:29:23] was a skull at gum Gotha right and and
[1:29:27] that that skull happened to be able
[1:29:29] swather
[1:29:30] come on y'all Abel's father had his
[1:29:33] skull so when that when that blood a man
[1:29:36] began streaming down it redeemed not
[1:29:40] just Adam but redeemed the entire fallen
[1:29:43] race of Adam thank God for Calvary the
[1:29:48] brother brother Branham goes on a little
[1:29:49] further here it says when we you know
[1:29:53] understand what Calvary is all about a
[1:29:58] man needs two things first it's settled
[1:30:02] the same question and secondly if it
[1:30:05] broke and delivered a deft load of
[1:30:07] Satan's power it delivered a death blow
[1:30:09] i'ma tell you there's just no area in
[1:30:11] our life where Satan should be
[1:30:13] victorious not even in death can the
[1:30:16] devil be victorious to a believer death
[1:30:20] is a buggy that pulls us into the
[1:30:24] presence of God right we're not even
[1:30:27] afraid of death as believers Calvary
[1:30:30] gives us that type of confidence no fear
[1:30:34] because of Calvary he says but the last
[1:30:38] thing here is that now we should do some
[1:30:41] things in return for the great sacrifice
[1:30:44] of Calvary and one of the things that he
[1:30:47] said and line me up a couple scriptures
[1:30:49] here the first one I'm going to hit is
[1:30:51] John 1719 and then I'm gonna go to
[1:30:55] Romans 6 verse 6 through 13 but these
[1:30:59] are some things that the prophecies say
[1:31:01] you become because of Calvary you become
[1:31:03] sons and you take the place of Christ
[1:31:06] you become sons and daughters of God and
[1:31:09] you take the place of Christ and he also
[1:31:11] said every Son of God not and becoming a
[1:31:14] son of God becoming a daughter of God
[1:31:16] say every son of God must have their day
[1:31:18] at Calvary glory to God like there's
[1:31:22] gonna be a death to yourself alright and
[1:31:25] and the last thing you said is when we
[1:31:27] get there and we've had a mint our day
[1:31:30] at Calvary then what it should do is he
[1:31:33] says eternal life
[1:31:34] a man is something that we give to
[1:31:36] others and eternal life is living for
[1:31:39] others eternal life is living for others
[1:31:46] eternal life living for somebody else
[1:31:50] you know that's that's what Christ did
[1:31:53] when he went to the cross when when he
[1:31:55] went when it when he was there on the
[1:31:56] cross and he yelled out Father forgive
[1:31:58] them for they know not what they do that
[1:32:01] was life being lived for others oh my
[1:32:04] god
[1:32:05] all this all the spit and all the
[1:32:07] hitting all the chastisement that he
[1:32:09] went through he did that because he had
[1:32:11] to do something for others oh my god
[1:32:14] you're gonna have to go through some
[1:32:15] things and you're doing it for somebody
[1:32:17] else not for yourself you're having your
[1:32:20] personal Calvary oh Jesus
[1:32:24] and when we have that personal Cavalry
[1:32:27] it strips us it really it really shakes
[1:32:30] us down amen we and we all got to have
[1:32:34] it church we can run from it this is the
[1:32:36] hour where we need to understand that
[1:32:39] great trial you're going through some
[1:32:40] personal Calvary you dime to yourself Oh
[1:32:44] hallelujah
[1:32:46] look at this and it says eternal life is
[1:32:49] living for others now reach something a
[1:32:50] little bit about that but I want you to
[1:32:52] try to get some of these things that he
[1:32:55] makes mention of oh my John 1719 says
[1:33:00] this and for their sakes I sanctify
[1:33:03] myself that they also might be
[1:33:07] sanctified through the truth
[1:33:08] oh you can't live like a devil you got
[1:33:12] to live like Christ you're gonna have to
[1:33:13] sanctify yourself oh yeah you came
[1:33:17] talking to when they talk if they
[1:33:19] letting all kind of curse words fly
[1:33:21] their mouth you can't talk that way you
[1:33:23] got to sanctify yourself for their sake
[1:33:25] Oh hallelujah
[1:33:29] hey man you have to sanctify yourself
[1:33:32] for the sake of others amen they get
[1:33:35] round up you get calm down
[1:33:38] praise the Lord somebody but this is
[1:33:41] what this is what uh you know this is
[1:33:43] this is what we get back to Calvary
[1:33:46] we're grateful for what Calvary gave us
[1:33:48] but now what are we giving back to
[1:33:50] Calvary look at this he also says this
[1:33:54] in in Romans 6 verse 6 through 13 Paul
[1:33:59] says knowing this that our old man is
[1:34:00] crucified with him that the body of sin
[1:34:04] might be destroyed that henceforth we
[1:34:06] should not serve sin but he that is dead
[1:34:10] is freed from sin now if we be dead with
[1:34:15] Christ we believe that we shall also
[1:34:17] live with him
[1:34:18] knowing that Christ being raised from
[1:34:21] the dead dies no more death hath no more
[1:34:24] dominion over him for in that he died he
[1:34:28] died unto sin once but in that he liveth
[1:34:31] he liveth unto God and this is the verse
[1:34:33] that brother branham's referred to it
[1:34:35] says likewise reckon you yo Rick and you
[1:34:38] also yourselves to be dead indeed unto
[1:34:40] sin but alive unto God through Jesus
[1:34:43] Christ our Lord let no sin therefore
[1:34:46] reign in your mortal body that you
[1:34:48] should obey it in the lusts thereof
[1:34:50] neither yield ye your members as
[1:34:53] instruments of unrighteousness
[1:34:54] understand but yield yourselves unto God
[1:34:58] as those that are alive from the dead
[1:35:00] and your members as instruments of
[1:35:02] righteousness unto God see every son of
[1:35:06] God you got to have your own personal
[1:35:08] Calvary now there's a statement that it
[1:35:13] makes here that ties right into what we
[1:35:16] were talking about on Wednesday night
[1:35:18] and I want to read this this is out of
[1:35:22] that day on Calvary paragraph 79 says
[1:35:28] this then when he died at Calvary he
[1:35:31] made a way he gave up the spirit the
[1:35:34] holy spirit that sent it back he gave up
[1:35:38] the spirit the holy spirit that sent it
[1:35:40] back to the earth for you and I to live
[1:35:42] by that's what Calvary means to us to
[1:35:46] follow him first look look into it see
[1:35:50] what it did for us and how and now what
[1:35:52] must we do in regards to int what must
[1:35:57] you and I do now we say well I
[1:35:58] appreciate that that's very fine but
[1:36:00] we've got to accept him and to accept it
[1:36:03] is to accept his person Christ in our
[1:36:06] heart then we are free from sin
[1:36:08] therefore there's no sin shackles
[1:36:11] hanging on us at all God just like we
[1:36:15] had never sinned you see that there's no
[1:36:17] sin shackles hanging on us it's just as
[1:36:19] if we never sinned Calvary wiped it all
[1:36:22] away
[1:36:22] Calvary settled the same question
[1:36:25] Calvary placed it in the sea if a gift
[1:36:28] for this think about it since but we got
[1:36:31] takes
[1:36:31] tipped and to accept it is to accept
[1:36:35] this person Christ in my heart then
[1:36:37] we're free from sin there's no sin
[1:36:38] shackles hanging on us at all got just
[1:36:40] like we had never sinned the perfect
[1:36:42] sacrifice the perfect sacrifice made us
[1:36:46] perfect
[1:36:47] so Jesus sent being therefore perfect
[1:36:49] even as your father in heaven is perfect
[1:36:51] then there's no more to be done but we
[1:36:54] are perfect we are made perfect in the
[1:36:56] presence of God he goes on now there's
[1:36:59] where we lose our position if we don't
[1:37:01] watch we try to look back to what what
[1:37:03] we was and as long as we look back to
[1:37:06] what we was the sacrifice means nothing
[1:37:08] to us I wanna I wanna I just want to
[1:37:11] hang out there I want to hang out there
[1:37:13] I can I'm a just I'm gonna tell y'all
[1:37:15] it's some pictures that you don't need
[1:37:18] no more some pictures you need to just
[1:37:22] go ahead and get rid of I just want to
[1:37:26] see where God brought me from no as you
[1:37:27] if you keep looking back right if you
[1:37:30] keep looking back like brother branham
[1:37:32] say if you don't watch we try to look
[1:37:33] back to what we was as long as we look
[1:37:35] back then the sacrifice don't mean
[1:37:37] anything so what we need to get rid of
[1:37:40] what happened in the past and we need to
[1:37:42] move forward into the future brother
[1:37:44] Willie told us that last last Friday say
[1:37:46] that that they said the young man went
[1:37:49] home told dad said son so say you you
[1:37:51] did this daddy you did this you used to
[1:37:53] do this used to that's that's that's not
[1:37:55] no I know I didn't
[1:37:56] so dad as the man said you did it said
[1:37:59] no I didn't do it he said he say well
[1:38:01] you say without what you need to just
[1:38:03] tell that man that toy you tell him that
[1:38:05] guy died that man dead there's no
[1:38:10] history of him anymore he's gone and
[1:38:12] saying and tell him I'll let him know if
[1:38:14] he want to know let I let him know how
[1:38:16] the man died I give him my test on how
[1:38:19] that man died but we need to get rid of
[1:38:20] the pass let the past stay in the past
[1:38:23] and move forward in the future
[1:38:26] [Music]
[1:38:27] hallelujah because sometime the past
[1:38:30] keeps us there right God trying to bring
[1:38:33] you forward but you keep looking
[1:38:35] backward and what was that somebody sent
[1:38:37] to the brothers little group we look at
[1:38:40] in a rearview mirror we'll crash we
[1:38:42] don't want to do that
[1:38:43] life you'll crash looking in the
[1:38:45] rearview mirror hey you gotta stop
[1:38:47] allowing that devil to bring up your
[1:38:49] pass if you know you cook you're not
[1:38:52] confessed it then it's underneath the
[1:38:54] blood and tell the devil if he keep on
[1:38:57] swimming he gonna drown in the sea of
[1:38:59] forgetfulness my God my God amen we got
[1:39:04] to know what the blood means to us
[1:39:06] alright Church come on I'm going further
[1:39:08] here
[1:39:09] Amen he says now Oh glory to God he says
[1:39:13] if you if we don't watch it we try to
[1:39:16] look back to what we was and as long as
[1:39:18] we look back to what we was that
[1:39:19] sacrifice means nothing to us Oh can't
[1:39:22] you see a church I wouldn't I would not
[1:39:25] try the job I can't and neither Nathan
[1:39:28] neither can you
[1:39:29] there's no need of trying you're lost to
[1:39:31] begin with as long as you look at what
[1:39:33] you've done but don't look to what
[1:39:35] you've done look what that day o Calvary
[1:39:38] did to you it paid your price it's
[1:39:42] settled the question your sins be as
[1:39:45] scarlet there's white as snow red like
[1:39:48] crimson white like wool then you have no
[1:39:52] sin what you have no sin that's what
[1:40:02] Calvary did it wipe your sins out none I
[1:40:06] mean you know they had all the same how
[1:40:09] the the it's not Jesus in the going
[1:40:17] through a filing cabinet this person saw
[1:40:19] Jesus going through a filing cabinet he
[1:40:21] would look at the filing cabinet and
[1:40:23] pull out an Aldus record you know of all
[1:40:25] the sins that a person didn't just look
[1:40:27] at my own mind my mind this person walks
[1:40:30] up and say Oh Lord that he when he found
[1:40:32] my file Oh God 25 my file and when he
[1:40:36] goes and he looks to just a bunch of
[1:40:38] blank white papers there's empty papers
[1:40:41] and they all
[1:40:43] Lord Jesus no I ain't gonna make it in
[1:40:45] because all that and when Jesus pulls
[1:40:48] the paper out
[1:40:49] it says forgiving it was wiped out the
[1:40:54] slate was clean and there was nothing
[1:40:57] there in the file you need to know
[1:40:59] there's nothing in your file there's
[1:41:00] nothing against you that's why that's
[1:41:04] why we celebrate Calvary that's why we
[1:41:06] celebrate Good Friday to the world some
[1:41:09] might think it was a really sad day that
[1:41:11] our Lord had to be crucified the way
[1:41:13] he's crucified but no what he brought to
[1:41:15] us makes it a good Friday and there's
[1:41:19] never been a day like it and there never
[1:41:22] will be a day like it thank God for Good
[1:41:25] Friday can I go on
[1:41:30] you have no sin you have no sin I told
[1:41:36] y'all God don't waste this time giving
[1:41:37] y'all words like this there's other
[1:41:40] churches you might go to you'll never
[1:41:42] hear nothing like that
[1:41:43] you have no sin listen you are perfectly
[1:41:47] sinless can I go further no matter what
[1:41:55] you done perfectly sinless no matter
[1:42:00] what you've done and what you do you're
[1:42:03] still sinless as long as you've accepted
[1:42:06] Jesus Christ as your Savior your sins
[1:42:08] are forgiven
[1:42:09] anything that's forgiven is remitted and
[1:42:11] forgot about then what does it do it
[1:42:14] gives you after that condition his
[1:42:15] spirit to follow him and do as he did
[1:42:18] for others who was following on let's go
[1:42:21] on he says he was just one man the
[1:42:23] perfect man He gave His life and he made
[1:42:24] an example for you now what must we do
[1:42:27] now the first thing I want to say Jesus
[1:42:29] never live for himself his life was
[1:42:33] spent for others
[1:42:34] that's perfectly eternal life when you
[1:42:37] say you go to church and you do good
[1:42:39] things that's fine but when you live
[1:42:41] your life for others you have you have
[1:42:43] but when you live your life to yourself
[1:42:46] you have an eternal life eternal life is
[1:42:49] living for others my god and so now when
[1:42:54] it when we're taught live others he said
[1:42:56] as many churches that were to they haunt
[1:42:58] about we went into this city and we we
[1:43:00] did this for this group and we did that
[1:43:02] for this group we fed this many poor
[1:43:03] people in this many you know people we
[1:43:06] get clothes or whatever there's many
[1:43:07] homeless people they say you know when
[1:43:09] you're doing that you actually missing
[1:43:10] the point when you got a two-tone horn
[1:43:12] you missing the point it's like what it
[1:43:14] should be is like if you were thirsty
[1:43:16] and you're going you know to get
[1:43:18] yourself something to drink and you knew
[1:43:20] your brother was thirsty or your sister
[1:43:22] was thirsty all you would do is go to
[1:43:25] the refrigerator and get them a drink as
[1:43:26] well if you're getting one for yourself
[1:43:28] you get one for them and when you give
[1:43:30] it to them they don't even have to say
[1:43:32] thank you right you're not trying to get
[1:43:34] your horn Tooting right for them to say
[1:43:36] thing it was just something that was
[1:43:38] natural and that's the same way it
[1:43:39] should be when you serving God and doing
[1:43:41] something for somebody else you don't do
[1:43:43] it to get your horn to dit you do it
[1:43:47] because it's natural eternal life is
[1:43:52] living for others it proved it when it
[1:43:57] come in the Lamb of God he lived and had
[1:44:00] eternal life because he did not live for
[1:44:02] himself he lived for others and you
[1:44:04] receive your eternal life by receiving
[1:44:06] that day and you don't live for yourself
[1:44:08] no more you live for others let me go on
[1:44:11] it says someone said how can you stand
[1:44:14] and let anybody call you such bad names
[1:44:17] look at it you don't live for yourself
[1:44:20] you live for others that you might
[1:44:22] redeem that man huh y'all not getting
[1:44:26] this yeah I'm not getting this you allow
[1:44:30] a person to say all kind of stuff treat
[1:44:32] you any kind of way because you're
[1:44:34] trying to redeem them oh my see this
[1:44:39] girl's deeper than what he did at
[1:44:41] Calvary now is what you're doing in your
[1:44:43] personal Calvary you become sons and the
[1:44:47] trouble of it is that Church has forgot
[1:44:49] they were sons you assumes you're taking
[1:44:52] Christ place now everybody want to talk
[1:44:55] about the caste mountain Delos Park but
[1:44:57] no in order to get to that part you got
[1:44:59] to go through this part listen you're
[1:45:01] taking Christ place your sons so don't
[1:45:04] live for yourself live for others Amen
[1:45:07] well brother branham I can live
[1:45:10] for this brother because he sure is a
[1:45:12] nice man that's not it live for that man
[1:45:16] who hates you
[1:45:19] live for that person who kill you if
[1:45:22] they could you know how to say looks
[1:45:26] Coquille live for that person look at it
[1:45:32] they say he says live that person who
[1:45:34] kill you if they could that's what
[1:45:36] they've done to him they killed him and
[1:45:38] he did that he died that he might save
[1:45:42] them that's eternal life when you get
[1:45:46] that's in your bosom your face in heaven
[1:45:49] then you know remember the Braniff say
[1:45:54] he went to the other side and say he can
[1:45:55] really describe what happens right but
[1:45:57] he said it's perfect love perfect love
[1:46:04] and we can't wait to get there to have
[1:46:06] it so you can have your perfect you're
[1:46:08] gonna have your personal Calvary here
[1:46:10] you can die to yourself you can learn
[1:46:13] how to love like Jesus I'm going further
[1:46:18] when you get that that's in your bosom
[1:46:20] you're facing heaven then but you
[1:46:22] sacrifice your own things give them up
[1:46:25] like sheep give its wool you look on
[1:46:28] tourists Calvary he says we're not and I
[1:46:31] got another statement we'll stop there
[1:46:33] on that quote he says we're not just
[1:46:35] becoming church members see we're not
[1:46:36] just coming to church just to be coming
[1:46:37] to church we're not becoming church
[1:46:38] member but we're becoming sons and
[1:46:41] daughters of God and I just want to just
[1:46:44] share a couple other things with you
[1:46:46] amen a couple scriptures in there now
[1:46:48] I'll close it out for tonight Matthew 5
[1:46:51] we go back to that because brother Brown
[1:46:53] just quoted it about being perfect as
[1:46:55] I'm perfect and look at it says you have
[1:46:58] heard that it hath been said thou shalt
[1:47:00] love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy
[1:47:01] but I said to you love you and he miss
[1:47:03] bless them that curse you do good to
[1:47:07] them that hate you see this is a
[1:47:10] personal Calvary right and pray for them
[1:47:13] which despitefully use you and persecute
[1:47:15] you that you may be the children of your
[1:47:19] father which is in heaven this is this
[1:47:21] is what makes you like like Christ right
[1:47:23] this is that you may be the children of
[1:47:26] your father which is in heaven for he
[1:47:27] maketh his Sun to rise on the evil and
[1:47:31] on the good and sendeth rain on the just
[1:47:34] and on the unjust verse 46 for if you
[1:47:37] love them which love you what reward
[1:47:40] have ye do not even the publicans the
[1:47:43] same he says and if you salute your
[1:47:45] brethren only what do you more than
[1:47:48] others do not even the publicans so be
[1:47:51] ye therefore perfect even as your father
[1:47:55] which is in heaven is perfect
[1:47:58] see Calvary otta produced this type of
[1:48:00] life out of us he goes on in a couple
[1:48:03] other scriptures that I want to bring to
[1:48:05] you John 14:12
[1:48:09] so we're taking the place of God the
[1:48:12] priests place with Christ on the earth
[1:48:14] it says verily verily I say unto you he
[1:48:16] that believeth on me the works that I do
[1:48:18] shall he do also and greater works than
[1:48:21] these shall he do because I go unto my
[1:48:23] father now I want you to understand the
[1:48:25] greater works that brother Branham was I
[1:48:28] mean brother Branham brought to our
[1:48:29] attention in that scripture say the
[1:48:30] greater works was not just a man healing
[1:48:34] the sick or casting out Devils that's
[1:48:37] not the great works that's where a lot
[1:48:38] of people leave it but on that date
[1:48:40] Calvary say the greater works was to
[1:48:42] impart eternal life he says he had this
[1:48:47] he says what does he turn a life the
[1:48:49] life that he lived the life that was in
[1:48:52] him and part that to others can a man do
[1:48:55] that he said a son of a son of God can
[1:48:58] and he quoted this scripture when he
[1:49:00] said a son of God can impart eternal
[1:49:03] life John 20 verse 22 through 23 I'm
[1:49:06] telling y'all Calvary takes us a little
[1:49:08] further than where we've been we talked
[1:49:12] about his death but I wonder if we're
[1:49:14] ready to come to our own person to death
[1:49:15] at Calvary John 20 verse 22 and 23 and
[1:49:20] when he had said this he breathed on
[1:49:23] them and said unto them receive ye the
[1:49:24] Holy Ghost and notice this this is what
[1:49:27] imparting eternal life is all about
[1:49:29] whosoever since year Ament they are
[1:49:34] remitted unto them and whosoever Sanji
[1:49:37] retain they are retained you have the
[1:49:42] power to either remit it or retain it
[1:49:46] now you know that that if you go back in
[1:49:48] scripture did not Joseph have that same
[1:49:51] power when they come to a place of
[1:49:53] authority there in Egypt and his family
[1:49:56] showed up they thought for sure Joseph
[1:49:59] wouldn't forgive them but Joseph
[1:50:00] actually told them God meant it for good
[1:50:05] he had the power to impart life Joseph
[1:50:10] had that power and you as sons and
[1:50:12] daughters of God had that same power
[1:50:14] tonight
[1:50:14] Lord I tell you who service says here
[1:50:17] admit there a minute but who services he
[1:50:20] retained their retained brother Brandon
[1:50:24] when that when that couple came to
[1:50:25] church and they was hugging in the
[1:50:27] church they were back there hugging in
[1:50:29] the church now you need to understand
[1:50:31] that's not what church is for church is
[1:50:34] not for cuddling churches for worshiping
[1:50:37] right but they were cuddling and I went
[1:50:40] from cuddling to kissing and while they
[1:50:43] were in the church that started all this
[1:50:44] kissing and brother em say uh please
[1:50:47] don't do that so that's that's very you
[1:50:49] know disrespectful to the Spirit of God
[1:50:51] please don't do that so they say they
[1:50:53] wouldn't stop the kepco has it please
[1:50:55] don't do that and you know and they they
[1:50:58] just kept going kept going so finally
[1:51:00] you know the Holy Spirit says whatever
[1:51:02] you say they are in your hands right now
[1:51:04] whatever you say will be done so brother
[1:51:07] Brandon like well what do I say and they
[1:51:09] say he looked at him and and and the
[1:51:12] Holy Spirit told him days before he said
[1:51:14] I'm sending a big test your way they
[1:51:16] call it a big test and he never told him
[1:51:18] what the test was and if the test was
[1:51:20] that couple in the presence of the Lord
[1:51:22] doing something that they weren't
[1:51:24] supposed to be doing and he said he said
[1:51:26] he said uh it says well he said whatever
[1:51:28] you say to him if you tell the drop dead
[1:51:30] they'll drop that right now my brother
[1:51:33] branham say I don't know what to say he
[1:51:35] said whatever you say it could happen
[1:51:36] and he looked at him and said I forgive
[1:51:38] you and the oldest Pierce a I'm pleased
[1:51:42] with that that was a big test how you
[1:51:46] handled it and it had every right to
[1:51:50] come down on oh my come on yo yeah I'm
[1:51:53] not y'all not with me tonight he had
[1:51:55] every right to come down on them because
[1:51:59] of what they had done he had every right
[1:52:02] but to sacrifice that to forfeit that to
[1:52:07] give that up is a Calvary
[1:52:11] Oh
[1:52:18] whoever says here emit they're emitting
[1:52:20] and who service sins you retain they are
[1:52:23] retained and brother and Peter for the
[1:52:27] branch that was the one that gave us a
[1:52:28] prescription for remission so how do we
[1:52:32] remit sin how do we impart eternal life
[1:52:35] it's not like we just walk up and give
[1:52:37] it to somebody but it's the way that we
[1:52:40] testify to him and lead them to Christ
[1:52:42] and the one Scripture when we want to
[1:52:44] remit and we want to show somebody how
[1:52:46] to get their sins we admit it we tell
[1:52:47] them acts 2:38 then Peter said unto them
[1:52:51] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:52:54] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:52:56] remission of sins and ye shall receive
[1:52:58] the gift of the Holy Ghost for the
[1:53:01] promises unto you and to your children
[1:53:03] and to all that afar off even as many as
[1:53:06] the Lord our God shall call Calvary had
[1:53:12] a couple things that the Prophet looked
[1:53:14] at one of those was what what happened
[1:53:20] there is settled to send question the
[1:53:22] second thing is that it it delivered a
[1:53:25] death blow to Satan's power and with
[1:53:28] those things in mind now we should have
[1:53:31] something that we do in return for the
[1:53:33] great sacrifice we are here to carry on
[1:53:35] where Jesus left off and in order for
[1:53:37] Jesus the character of Jesus to be
[1:53:39] expressed the way it was that same
[1:53:42] character has to be expressed to us but
[1:53:44] in order for that to happen Church we
[1:53:46] got it down to ourselves and we got to
[1:53:48] be willing to go to a personal Calvary
[1:53:50] hey man it ought to be a good Friday for
[1:53:54] you now if you got some things that
[1:53:56] you've been holding on to that you need
[1:53:57] to let go of let the let the Holy Spirit
[1:53:59] deal with your heart so you can get rid
[1:54:01] of it maybe it's people that you need to
[1:54:03] forgive amen we talked about it on
[1:54:06] Wednesday night how you can you can't
[1:54:08] you can't go to the president Lord and
[1:54:09] pray amen for somebody as a mortal and
[1:54:13] and hold things against them while
[1:54:16] you're praying for what you need to do
[1:54:17] is go and kind of kind of enter to you
[1:54:20] know think the way that they would think
[1:54:22] act the way they would act and try to
[1:54:24] understand why they might have did what
[1:54:26] they did get into their channel right
[1:54:29] and as you get into that maybe
[1:54:31] to show you a few things about them so
[1:54:32] then when you come out of that then you
[1:54:34] can just kinda shake the hands and God
[1:54:35] bless you and never say a word about it
[1:54:38] say calibre is when you can just give up
[1:54:40] when you can just quit you can lay it
[1:54:42] aside say Lord forgive them they don't
[1:54:45] know what they're doing
[1:54:46] that's a true gallery we all need that
[1:54:51] we all need that
[1:54:59] I want to end there we'll have a time of
[1:55:03] Prayer here and maybe I'm Sunday there's
[1:55:08] some other things I have here but I'll
[1:55:09] try to slip that in on Sunday father we
[1:55:13] are grateful for Calvary
[1:55:21] and when we really think about these
[1:55:23] things and what would occur there some
[1:55:27] 2,000 years ago we wouldn't be sitting
[1:55:29] where we are had it not been for that
[1:55:33] Lord your prophet helps it challenge
[1:55:36] this isn't lets us see that it goes
[1:55:38] further than just what you did but now
[1:55:41] it's what we need to do we got to die to
[1:55:44] ourselves divert our thoughts down to
[1:55:46] our feelings our flesh we got to die to
[1:55:51] it so yes there are things that would be
[1:55:55] that'll happen things that'll be sad
[1:55:56] things have to be done and it'll hurt
[1:56:00] that's what happened to you God those
[1:56:02] things that were said the people
[1:56:03] spitting on you and hitting you and my
[1:56:06] turnin on you we just talked about last
[1:56:08] suddenly how you you wrote in to the
[1:56:11] city and Lord into Jerusalem and all the
[1:56:13] people yelling and screaming Hosanna
[1:56:15] blessed is he who comes in the name of
[1:56:16] the Lord
[1:56:18] but within one week's time those same
[1:56:20] people had turned and now they're saying
[1:56:22] if if if this be the Son of God then let
[1:56:27] them come down off the cross but they
[1:56:31] didn't understand that had you come down
[1:56:33] off that cross then these things that we
[1:56:35] talked about tonight wouldn't be settled
[1:56:37] so thank you for paying the ultimate
[1:56:40] price thank you for doing what nobody
[1:56:44] else could do there was no man worthy
[1:56:47] nobody could take the book and loose the
[1:56:49] seals thereof only the lamb can do it so
[1:56:53] we think you got and help us Lord to to
[1:56:57] constantly be reminded like the prophets
[1:57:01] the addition just be a one day a year
[1:57:04] thing that we think about this but every
[1:57:06] day should be a day of Calvary every day
[1:57:11] should be a day where we're dying to
[1:57:12] ourselves every day should be a day
[1:57:14] where we're thinking about giving more
[1:57:15] to you we want to be steadfast unmovable
[1:57:19] always abounding in the work of Lourdes
[1:57:25] not compromising in any way but giving
[1:57:29] you everything we have

[2:02:05] thank you Jesus man if you have the
[2:02:10] opportunity on tomorrow let's go back
[2:02:13] and listen to that sermon that day on
[2:02:14] Calvary the Prophet just brings in so
[2:02:17] many things that just challenges our our
[2:02:21] spirits a man we just appreciate that I
[2:02:25] wanted to once again just thank everyone
[2:02:28] for those that participated during this
[2:02:33] time of fasting technically last night
[2:02:38] would have been the last last night of
[2:02:41] the fast today it would be over for
[2:02:44] myself I wanted to go through this Good
[2:02:46] Friday amen and thought that it was just
[2:02:49] very appropriate that it was ending on
[2:02:51] this Good Friday and just kind of make
[2:02:53] it right through and at 12 o'clock
[2:02:55] tonight the fast will well actually and
[2:02:57] but I wanted to thank you all for
[2:03:00] participating amen and whatever way you
[2:03:04] did
[2:03:05] certainly appreciated it's not many
[2:03:08] churches today that even do any of these
[2:03:11] things but we're under expectation for
[2:03:13] God to do great things and I miss amen
[2:03:16] and one of the one of the greatest
[2:03:18] things is to be able to see Souls
[2:03:20] delivered and their lives changed amen
[2:03:24] and as we have prepared for Sunday
[2:03:26] morning a lot of time to get visitors
[2:03:28] you get people that you've never seen
[2:03:29] before a show of the church but we want
[2:03:32] God to do something and then walk God to
[2:03:34] speak to their hearts and let the Holy
[2:03:36] Spirit just kind of come and just flood
[2:03:38] souls and just just cause a change and I
[2:03:41] just believe God will honor a man our
[2:03:43] faith in and honor our position in the
[2:03:46] fast so I pray that whatever you might
[2:03:48] have had in your heart that God would
[2:03:50] even grant that to you and man as you
[2:03:54] were going through the fast may God
[2:03:55] grant that may you see not many days
[2:03:58] hence but I wanted to thank you all once
[2:03:59] again for participating you know the day
[2:04:03] of Pentecost did not come until they
[2:04:06] were all in one mind and in one Accord
[2:04:09] amen and that's what we need as a church
[2:04:11] to get in why my
[2:04:13] in one Accord and we'll see God do
[2:04:15] mighty things amen in our bids and then
[2:04:18] let's have a word of Prayer before we
[2:04:20] prepare to dismiss you on today tonight
[2:04:23] father we are once again grateful for
[2:04:27] all that you have done we can never take
[2:04:32] Calvary lightly Lord so much that you
[2:04:37] suffered so much that you went through
[2:04:39] is the worst death that any man could
[2:04:41] ever die you did that for us
[2:04:44] and I'm selfish enough to believe
[2:04:46] tonight that had there not been anybody
[2:04:50] else
[2:04:51] God to go to Calvary for you would have
[2:04:54] went just for being and God I'm grateful
[2:04:57] for that love that that you were
[2:04:59] demonstrating that you would show I'm
[2:05:01] grateful for amen the struggle that you
[2:05:05] had there in the Garden of Gethsemane
[2:05:06] and brother Adam told us that that was
[2:05:09] where the death really took place was in
[2:05:11] the Garden of Gethsemane oh by Calvary
[2:05:13] was just an act but but when you died to
[2:05:16] your thoughts you died to your ideas you
[2:05:18] died to your your desires you said
[2:05:20] nevertheless not my will but your will
[2:05:21] be done God
[2:05:22] that's where Calvary took place and God
[2:05:26] let that be our testimony let it happen
[2:05:28] tonight that we would come to a place
[2:05:30] Lord not my will but your will be done
[2:05:32] that we went yield completely to you and
[2:05:35] allow you God to be manifested in us Oh
[2:05:39] God our sins have been forgiven we are
[2:05:43] perfectly sinless
[2:05:45] there's nothing held to our account
[2:05:48] God we're grateful for what you've done
[2:05:51] nobody else could do it but you Lord
[2:05:53] Jesus as we are bringing ourselves Lord
[2:05:56] to a close and this time of fasting
[2:05:59] lord I I pray your blessings upon each
[2:06:02] and every one that has participated more
