bless the words that will be that will be spoken and touch every heart in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen so um in this first you you you may all be seated in this first verse that we have here in ecclesiastics uh the verse one here it says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven and it's very very important to remember that word that statement of of under the heaven all right so as we go into the message God's appointed time uh God has a time for everything God has everything planned out and the beautiful thing about this is he's already set the dates and the times before anything has ever happened right so we're just fitting in to whatever Vision that he had uh so that's where we can find our confidence for whatever we're going through because he's already solved the problem right he's already came up with a resolution we're just here just to hear it and to receive it right so in order to talk about God's appointed time we have to look at some natural phenomena so um one of the most beautiful things that you'll ever see in this earth is uh is sunlight right and it's something that no matter what country you live in no matter what race you are no matter what whether you're a Christian a a Believer not a Believer or no matter your um a denomination that you belong to it's something that we all love and enjoy it's something that we all have a a a common ground on right and we love to all see when the Sun rises like the rising of the sun people love to see the rising of the Sun and when you look at a lot of nature uh when when the Sun rises everything else Also Rises with uh uh um with with the Sun as it goes so regardless if you're black or white regardless if you're in the denom denomination regardless if you believe God or you don't we all love to rise when the Sun rises it's something that's very natural to us right as human beings um because science has found out that we have a biological clock that is inside of us that it's sets a rhythm to when the Sun rises up and it helps us to wake up right it helps us to wake up because we weren't made to live during the night time right we weren't made to live in the dark you know um I and I know that some people may say they work at night but I I actually have a um an experience with this because I used to be a night auditor for comfort and hotels I think back in 2011 and I did that job for maybe 3 or 4 years and we had to do we had I had a shift that was called the graveyard shift and that was from 11:00 p.m. I did that from 11:00 p.m. all the way to 7:00 a.m. so I had to do my sleeping during the daytime and then I had to try to stay up at night um uh stay up at night and so it was it was tough trying to get sleep during the day like it's nothing like sleeping at night right and it's nothing like being up during the daytime uh and I remember I would go in my closet you have no window and it be pitch black and I put the little put a little cloth under the door to block out all the light and it' be pitch black dark in there but it is nothing like just sleeping at night and then waking up to a sunrise that feels natural right and and so science has has found out these things is that your body actually produces a chemical called melatonin when it's dark outside and what that does is it's your body's way of trying to get you to relax and get you drowsy so that you can sleep so it's it's it's God's design of trying to help you uh uh live uh uh according to the laws of this land right um and and no one wants to start their day at 12: at midnight or or 1 p.m. or 2 p.m. you'll never hear anybody say they want to start their day uh at midnight no people want to start their day at the rising of the Sun and and it's no matter your denomination whether you believe God or you don't believe God you want to rise when the Sun rises right so in order to experience the rising of the sun uh there's a couple of uh things you have to factor in one is going to be your time zone whatever time zone that you're in that'll be that'll that it it it'll show you uh uh exactly when you'll experience a sunrise so with all the saints in London right now they have a different time zone that we're in and they'll experience Sunshine different when we than we'll experience sunshine and uh and an important thing about that is they have to their bodies are working right now to help them to adjust to that change right because the body still seeking to see the sun regardless of where you are in the world this body wants to rise when the Sun rises right it is something so natural to us that we don't have to think about it our body just goes to work at it right and it's important to type these things from natural to the spiritual right and so another uh another factor that you have to think about is uh the season changes right so um in the fall time uh in the fall and winter time the Sun will rise at different times and even in the springtime the sun will rise and fall at uh at different times right and it's important to realize because I and I've and I've I studied about this uh I'm going to tell you a story about uh this this astronomer that kind of had this uh debate with the Roman Catholic Church uh I think it was in the 1600s but it's important to realize that in the right rising of the sun cuz we say rising the the sun rises and the sun sets and it's true from our viewpoint but we have to realize that in actuality the sun is just setting there regardless if it's dark regardless if it's uh uh uh whatever time uh uh day it is regardless wherever you are in the world the sun is always setting there but it's the Earth that's constantly going through different changes right and so the Catholic Church actually in the 1600 they had a doctrine that they tried to base off the Bible that said the Earth is in the center of the universe and the Sun is revolving around the earth and uh they tried and they tried to back it with the scripture which we'll we'll we'll see that is not true right um uh Ju Just just alone in Ecclesiastes that first verse when it says in a time and person a time and purpose under the heavens it's under the heavens where a lot of changes go through and a lot of changes happen and stuff like that that but when you get above the heavens and it comes to God he's just there in his word there's no frustration there's no worry there's no argument there's no debate it's just the word and that's and that's exactly how the Sun is the sun is just sitting right there in the center of the center of the universe and it's just shining it's job is just to shine it's the Earth that goes through the different changes so the Catholic Church tried to get people to believe that it was the Sun moving around the Earth and the Earth was one that was set and still and then and so there was this uh astronomer named Galileo and of course they didn't have as many technological advances that we have today to kind of see these things but he but based off the research he had and what he saw he said well no uhuh I I believe that it's the Earth is the one that's revolving around the sun and the Catholic Church got upset with him because he was a Catholic as well and by him saying that it would have gone against the Catholic Doctrine so then they set a trial for him and they accused him of you know going against the doctrine or whatever and they put him in on house arrest come to find out later on down through history as we begin to get more advanced with science they found out that the sun is in the center of the universe and the Earth is revolving around and the Pope in 19 I believe it was 1992 had to give an apology to this man that they had put in jail 300 years ago to say that no we had it wrong right we had itong wrong right and the reason why I'm talking about the sun in this kind of aspect is like I said before the word of God is likened to sunlight and that it always stays the same it's something you can trust no matter how no matter what you're going through in life no matter how where you're at in the universe because the sun doesn't move but the Earth does move and the Earth does move in different points of the universe and no matter where you're at in one point of the of the universe the sun is sitting there remaining the same with the Sun light just blazing through and even when we and and it's not the Sun that gets storms right storms don't happen on on the sun hurricanes don't happen on the sun uh uh earthquakes and all those things don't happen to the Sun so that's what happens in the earth the earth is what gets storms and the Earth can get to a point where it's so cloudy to where you can't see any sea any sunlight but that does not mean that the sun is still not shining right it doesn't matter how how how much the uh the thunderstorm is going on you can really hear you can hear the you can see the lightning you can hear the thunder very very loud right you can see and you're from if you're from Florida you y'all know about hurricanes and hurricanes is are no joke right and uh uh but regardless of all the destruction that's going on you know people if you go to the Midwest of the US you'll see people in tornadoes and just devastating tornadoes but regardless of all that's going on the sun is still shining right and it's very very important to remember remember that um I actually had an experience and I don't know if it happens down here in Florida but one time I was in the uh I was on the military based with my dad in the commissary which is just a grocery store back when we were in uh Virginia and one and all of a sudden we were shopping going down the aisle and all a sudden the Earth just shook and just started shaking and I was so scared in that moment stuff was flying off of the shelves and I in that moment I realized that there is no Foundation right when you're in when you're in an earthquake and you're feeling that Earth just shake Beneath Your Feet you realize you ain't standing really on nothing right but regardless of what was going on the sun was still shining right it didn't stop the Sun from shining right so we have to get that thinking out of our our we have to get that thinking out of our head that when things are going on uh all of a sudden the sun is no longer there no it's always there it's always been in there right and and you have to you have to realize that when you're going through a situation and it's it's it's it's important to recognize that Christ is the head right because Christ is not in a position where he is where he goes through storms now that he's seated in Heavenly places he doesn't deal with those kind of things all he has is directions and what you should do and where you should go and how to handle the situation because when you're going through a situation and you're trying to reason your way out the problem with us and what makes us different is that we have emotions that come with it when we get in trouble you know we not so when we get into a trouble situation you know we feel sad we feel discouraged right we feel flustrated we feel angry and so you can't reason when you're in that state because in your mind you're trying to figure out a way to get out of this thing but you're also trying to manage these emotions that you're dealing with so now you're split in between two places and what you need is another voice right you need another voice and a clear voice from somebody that is not in the same position as you that can give you a word that you can rest on right something that you can rest on and and I'm here to tell you that uh uh you're going to go through a lot of hard things in life the Earth was God made it that way and and so a lot of times people wonder about you know why do I got to pay bills why do I got to pay taxes why do I got to go why do I have to go to work and ecclesiastic says there's a time and a season for everything so you're not it's it's never going to be good 100% you're only fooling yourself right and so and and this this this Bible verse wasn't it wasn't put into the Bible to make you afraid but it was there it was put it was put in the Bible it was put there to get you to realize that you have help while you're going through right and you don't have to figure out everything yourself and there's somebody that you can call on to when you're going through these things right there's somebody that knows when these appointments are going to happen and he can come down and step into your situation right it's also to let you know uh just how not in control you are when I was in that earthquake it made me realize I can't run I was like I can't you you can't run nowhere when that Earth is shaking and things is crashing all around you you have no control you can't run you can't jump you just got to sit there and hope for the best right and that's kind of life is right uh so um so no matter the situation the son will always arrive at the pointed time because in the beginning God spoke that the Sun would rise and the sun would set and the sun has obeyed the voice of God ever since day one right and just because you don't see anything doesn't mean that the sun is not there right so getting into appointments now um because you know when the sun arises is it signifies a time when things need to get done or when things begin to happen right and so I've never seen a human being or I've never heard of someone waking up in the middle of the night going outside and Yelling to the Sky for the sun to rise sooner I don't think I've ever seen anyone do that right I don't think I've ever seen someone get up in the middle of the night and yell to the sky son why are you taking so long to come right no we know the sun will rise right because we saw it rise yesterday we saw it Rose the day before and we saw it raise the day before and we saw it raise the day before and no matter what we're going through in life because like I said everyone goes through troubles nobody is exempt from ecclesiastics 3 right everyone's going to go through troubles but even people in the world that don't have God they even they know that the day will still be that there will still come another day all right to try again all right to or to see that Sunrise so we know for a fact that the sun is going to keep Rising right there's an innate belief inside of us to just trust the process and that's very very very important to trust the trust the process because every help that you get every single help that you receive in life is going to be an appointment God always makes an appointment with man for everything in life uh uh and it's always in his timing right so um and uh and also you know cuz when I explained about the seasons changing as well you know how you have the uh I think it's fall back the daylight savings where you fall back spring you spring forward and you lose an hour you might complain for a little while but after a while it's like hey back to business right it's back to business you trust the process right uh um and and also a key thing for resting uh uh a key thing for resting is is is a part that we play play the reason why you want to rest at night while the sun is not there is because what are you doing you're resting and knowing that the sun will rise again and you will wake again right and that's a key thing to remember in all things in life uh uh even uh uh I think one time the prophet even said even when you're on your death bed you can expect Christ to be there you have to have some kind of faith and some kind of hope that when you're sitting there and you're changing through those Realms and you're experiencing that death process that Christ is going to rise in that situation to take you home right so uh uh the night reminds us to rest and rest in what rest in knowing the process that the sun will rise again right so when God makes an appointment right uh he keeps all of them right he keeps all his appointment and he keeps all his appointments on time uh I'm going to turn to Genesis um I know they they don't have this up but I just we're going to turn to genesis8 18 and read verses 9 through 10 we're going to read a couple verses here um y so turn to Genesis 18 and it says here and they say and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him so God knew that they had this issue of having a kid and so here is God coming down and here's God setting the appointment now I want you to it's important to realize God sets your appointments you don't set your appointments when you set your appointment it's going to get very very frustrating right because things won't move in the way that you expect them to but when God comes and sets an appointment right he just gives you his promise or his word that he's going to do something right so we're going to turn to Genesis uh 2 uh 21 and we're going to read from verses uh 1- two and it reads and the Lord visited Sarah as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken for Sarah conceived and bear Abraham a son in his old age at the set time oh which God had spoken to him I want you to realize that God kept his word god kept his appointment and notice it didn't it didn't say anything about it didn't say anything about how Sarah and Abraham felt about it God just said I was going to do what I said I was going to do right so it's important to receive a word from the Lord because there's a lot of stuff that's going to happen in between right but you but you have to have you have to have confidence that no matter what that word is still there you're going to experience a lot of things in life that are are that are going to try to bring you down and it's important to have a head it's important to have somebody with a clear voice right with a clear word so that when you're going through a situation and you feel like nothing's going to happen you have to go back to the word that says hold on a second God said this was going to happen and I want you to realize that Isaac was already there right Isaac was already there so it wasn't something that they had to do it's just something that they had to believe for right it's predestination right it's a predestinated path where God says if something will be there it will be there and you just trust in it no matter what you're going through because you're going to get frustrated there's going to be frustrations there's going to be times where you feel like giving up you know uh uh it's not easy to have faith it's not easy to try to have faith in your own time of wanting things to happen right it's going to get you frustrated but when you can go back to God and bring and uh uh and and God loves it God loves it when you challenge him with his own word when you go back to God and bring him his word and say Lord you promis this thing right Lord you promis this thing you set this thing all right you showed this thing to me in your word and if God has revealed something to you he has to do it all right and you can remind them every single Sunrise because the sun is a the sun is is is an exact EX example of his word just remaining no matter what is going on right so when we make appointments in the natural sense what we do is you know let's say let's say if you're uh let's say your garage is is broken or something like that you'll call someone they'll make an appraisal and they'll say hey yeah this situation we can fix this thing and then when they set an appointment they'll give you a uh uh they'll give you they'll tell you what they're going to do we're going to resolve so and so issue and they also give you a date and time of when they're going to do it right but God works a little different than how man does when he schedules his appointments right so I can see if we can dramatize this situation of Abraham uh God coming to Abraham I can see God in heaven uh take out some planner let's say if he had a cabinet file next to his throne he took out some planner and he said Abraham you're going to have a son right I'm going to meet you at the time of life and you're going to have the son right God told told him what was going to happen but never told him when it would happen right but when we make appointments we like to know the time we like to know the date we like to know the time we like to know the location we like to know all the specifics and that helps build us confidence and we have to be careful when we're going to God now with appointments because you can't come with that same level of faith and the same level of confidence because a lot of times God doesn't tell you when it's going to happen true God want tell you when it's going to happen he'll promise something but he'll never tell you when it's going to happen he'll never tell you what you have to go through right so so they knew when the appointment was but God never told him it's going to happen now sometimes he may tell you sometimes he won't but there's a reason why he doesn't like to say things right uh uh sometimes he likes to wait because one of the things about God that a lot of people don't realize is God is a tester right God loves to test God loves to test everything right uh uh uh I can it it's just it's just one it's just one of his attributes that we probably don't praise enough you know we love him as a blesser we love him as a Healer you know we love him as all of these uh joyous things but God likes to test you God likes to put you through fire God likes to try you out just to God likes to stretch you out to see how much can you bear I want to see how much I can get out of you right he's kind of like a a uh one of those um I and I remember those shows where you see those people that like uh those rich people where they're very very concerned I mean they got this wealth of knowledge and they're very very concerned about just one penny of it right and God I feel kind God's kind of the same way where he wants to he wants he wants to test every single aspect of your life every single part of you he wants to make sure that that thing is solid right so God loves to test and test and test and test uh and and Peter actually said that our trials and tribulations are actually more precious than gold so we tend to look at uh uh the earth and the worldly things uh uh in the things of the world but Peter is coming here and saying that when you're going through a trial when you recognize that you're going through a trial or a tribulation it's counted joy and we kind of tend to take the opposite view where we think oh man things is going hard but you see God likes to test that faith in what you believe in the word and God says no I said it's Joy right I said it's Joy what are you looking sad for what are you looking down for right he's trying to test that Faith to see do you really believe the word amen right do you really believe the word right so when God uh um when God doesn't give you a time of the appointment when it's going to happen he's looking for something else right he's looking for something else to happen uh uh out of that situation right so when we make appointments like I said we just want to get the thing done we just like okay set time here it is we just want to get it done right um but God likes to see our reactions God likes to see our reactions when we're waiting uh uh one to see do you really believe him right two to make sure that uh uh that uh your desire is a real good desire to have right right in uh uh in that waiting period so there's a uh there's a story in the Bible of um of Hannah and so uh sister Hannah she was um the Bible says that the Lord struck her womb so that she couldn't have kids so it's not that she it's not that uh uh it was something that she did herself God caused this Affliction to come upon her and the Bible says that she went through years and years and years and years dealing with this thing the Bible says she couldn't eat her husband had came to her and said why aren't you eating uh the Bible says that her was fail so she's at she's at a time where she wants a child just like Abraham uh uh did uh uh and so she wants an appointment with God God's the one that shut up her womb and now he's and now it it seems like he's not saying nothing now right but just like the sun right the word is still there doesn't matter how down you are it doesn't matter how much continent you've lost or or or enjoyment of life that you lost the word is still there right and so in that time that Hannah was going through what she was going through it I believe it caused her to reflect about the desires that she had until one point she came to the Altar and we know the story how she began to cry and the Bible says that this prayer uh uh she was uh she was praying inside of her heart but what she was saying on the outside just looked crazy God wants authentic prayers God wants an authentic talk God wants something when you come to God he wants you to be authentic 100% authentic he wants every deep part of your heart in order for him to respond back and so now she's in a position where she can talk to God without anything blocking and she says and she ask God for the right thing she says Lord give me a child uh uh um and I will give him to you I'll give him back to you and God's like you ask for the right thing right you ask for the right thing and then of course you know the the story how God had given her a um a a prophet right so the Prophet The Prophet was already there right so in her crying and in her countenance down in her not eating nothing her son was already there God just needed her to say the right words in order to release him amen right and she had no selfish motives behind that and when she spoke the right words she said all right now he can come amen and we can go to another story if we uh turn to the uh if you go to the New Testament uh uh uh of the sis of the of the woman that um she had a a child that was uh vexed by a devil I believe it says and she came to God because she knew that Jesus Christ could change her situation around and she had come to him uh uh uh looking for him to uh uh uh touch a situation and spoke to him and he didn't say a word back right now see God wants to like I said God is always a tester and I believe that uh the word of God said Jesus Christ it said Jesus uh uh Jesus Christ said he does nothing unless the father shows him first so I believe he knew exactly how the situation was going to happen and he had to act according to the vision right just to see the fruit come from this lady right and so he did he he didn't say anything to her he didn't say not not one word to her and I want you to realize that can look like a a a a cloudy situation right but this sister knew that no matter what I'm going through the sun is still shining right the sun is still there no matter what I'm going through no matter how hard it looks her disciples even uh told her hey this woman is coming to you man just just just take her off and uh he made the comment that you know I only come to the house of children I've only come to the uh uh to the Israelites during that time and the Bible says she didn't turn away she still worshiped so I want you I want to let you know that even when you're going through a troubling time you still have to worship now you have to understand that when she was sitting there this was her talking face to face with God just as we see each other face to face this man Jesus Christ God and flesh said nothing to her so can you imagine being in that situation if you were coming to brother Jack asking him to help you with a situation and brother Jack didn't say nothing to you right and then brother Troy came up and said hey hey we we need you to get out of here right or some of the other brother said hey hey we need to get out how would you react in that situation right and then he makes the comment you know I only come to the house of I only come to the house of Jose I'm not sent to these guys and then it says she still worshiped right because she still believed in that son being there regardless of her situation and then like I said God loves to test God just loves to test and test and test and test if you can get that concept planted in your heart you'll be successful in life you'll be successful with God in life when you understand his expectations it makes life a lot more easier uh uh to go through and so then he comes to the point where he says you know it's not meat for me to give the children's bread to a dog right and it's it's another level of a test that he just Slams on her so she came to him he didn't say anything she still came to him he still didn't respond to him still worshiped him still was praising him in his car going to work you know how we all praise him praise him on Sunday and then he comes and says I don't give it's not meat for me to give the children's bread to a dog you know but in her heart right and and just as in our bodies we have this natural this innate belief in us to know that no matter what the Sun what the clouds look like what the night looks like the sun is still going to rise she had something in the spiritual level saying hold on a second no no no no no I still believe the Sun is going to rise on my situation right and she agreed with the word even in her situation and God said you said the right exact thing now I can touch you now I can bless her situation so you see God loves to test and God loves to test and test and test and test right just so we can say the right things is not to hurt us right because if it um you have to realize that a lot of people go through life and they pray and God doesn't answer not one prayer God doesn't speak to them not one God even said himself uh uh when he was on Earth that when he gave Parables it was to blind people right so you have to understand that God some God doesn't speak to some people but for us when he speaks to us he speaks to us through test so that we meet the word test and say the right thing right and be appear worthy before him right so he wants to see our reactions while we're going through the appointment right uh because um you know what because here's the thing about it when you've received something when you received an appointment from God or you've received something from God do you know what God does after that he tests you again right he test you again after youve prayed for and after you receive what you've gotten he just throws on another test right and the test that you go through this time is greater than the one you went through before all right it's levels to these things right it's always levels to these things and the test before the test after you've come through another one will always be greater uh than the one that you uh that you uh faced before right so um and that's how you know we we look at Abraham who received the promised son right and uh he had his appointment he had to wait 25 years in order to receive his son and the Bible says he ain't get nothing but stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger right now in Genesis 22 uh and we're going to read through uh I'm I'll just read through verse one and two while you turn it says and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham now I I believe that tempt is I don't I believe that tempt mean he was trying to test Abraham right he was trying test Abraham and it's a weird thing because Abraham just spent 25 years showing he believe God that should have been enough for God but there's always a there's always another level of Faith there's always a deeper experience that you can have with God and maybe even Abraham thought that 25 years was just enough that he went through in order to get his son right and it says that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am and verse two he says and he said take thy son and just see how look at how God says this thing take thy son thy only son whom thou lovest can you imagine after you've waited 25 years for God to give you something and he did it in such a miraculous um such a miraculous way and you've and I believe uh uh he was a he was a boy now right so AB Abraham spent birthdays he spent uh they they uh they work together they travel together they had so many experience uh God knew that he loved them right and then and then just this one morning the spirit just wakes him up and says hey take thy son thy only son thy only son Isaac whom thou lovest and give thee into the land of Mariah offer him there for burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I tell of thee can you imagine how Abraham now feels all right can you imagine what he's the thoughts that are going through his head cuz he's still obeyed God right he still obeyed God but he had this innate belief within the spiritual realm that says I know the sun can rise again and the prophet said that Abraham was able to go out with that request because he knew that if God gave him the son he could cause him to rise again right but he wanted but but God but God wanted to get something out of Abraham because when they came up to the mountain and Abraham was ready to sacrifice his only son God sent the angel down and said hold on a second now I know you love me you see God's always looking to see inside of our hearts a deeper walk we can get with him see it's not our job to decide when we're ready it's not our job to decide our appointments you know when you're going through a trial you're like okay Lord I've been going through this for 2 months now I think it's ready now oh no no no no no no no no God sees something that you don't see right God sees a deeper walk with him a deeper love for him and he's trying to get investment on that right he's trying to prove that his word is true all right um the waiting also what it does uh there's another piece of this thing is the waiting is not just to try you as well but it's also to show the faithfulness of God of his word to you and that it has nothing to do with you right the rising of the sun has nothing to do uh uh with us it's not our job to go out in space and hop on a spaceship and go out in space and you know uh try to uh cowboy tie the Sun and pull it up right it's not our job to do that it's our job just to trust that hey when the Sun rises it'll rise in the time that it's supposed to do and when it rises I'm going get up and something's going to happen right right so it's it's uh uh God also wants to show his faithfulness to you because a couple of things happened when Abraham had promised his uh son to Isaac one Abraham laughed at it right and then uh uh further down the road uh I believe that um and brother Jack has actually preached about this thing um brother Jack said that you know when um Abraham and uh Sarah God had changed their bodies back to Young they were still old but it gave them a body change it came before The King and Abraham lied to the king saying oh no no no just just tell him that you're my uh tell him that you're my sister because he going to kill me because I know he wants to marry you right and uh Abraham should have had faith that hold on a second I have a kid coming out of you so this situation has got to turn around I don't know what's going to happen I can't just give you up like that right and then also it came to the time where Sarah um also um tried to uh uh Sarah tried to set a a premature appointment right and giving Hagar a believe the manservant to Abraham that says okay Abraham you just go with her and then produce a son that'll be our son so she tried to uh uh um make the appointment to stop the appointment at a premature date right and all of this is just to show our type and how that the sun just sets still it's us that moves around and turns night and day and storming and up and down and frustrated and you know oh man I don't want to serve God I don't want I I don't believe God no more no I just want to walk off and do this thing or or God you ain't working fast enough maybe I need to do this thing it's to show that that's us kind of going around but the word like the sun is just setting in the middle just shining just as much as the truth right and in order to experience faithfulness you got to be unfaithful there has to be a there has well it's not a purposely being unfaithful but there's a weakness in you that has to be that that gets exploited because when we're Unfaithful it's our own choice you got to realize that God ain't causing you to be unfaithful no when God the spirit came into the body Jesus Christ he kept the word he went exactly through what uh me and you and I went through he went through sickness he went through heartache he went through portrayal he went through tough times he went through confusion and he always kept the word every single uh second every single Temptation the Bible says he was Secure so he could help those that are secur showing that he is worthy to be ahead which is someone to make decisions he was worthy to be someone to make decisions right and to show and it's also to show that uh uh the faithfulness of his word because I like how it said in uh uh um in Genesis um give me one second while I turn to it uh in Genesis 21 and and the Lord has said when the Lord had visited Sarah he said the Lord said to Sarah he said um and the Lord visited Sarah as he had said he said he was going to visit Sarah no matter through what Sarah did cuz one she laughed right she when God spoke the word she laughed right there and God could have took her out but because she was tied to a head someone that believed God was like I can't touch you without touching that and that is our privilege in Christ am you have to realize that God can't do nothing to us now you got to be careful don't don't just go out there doing whatever you want to do now right because you going to pay for it but God can't touch us without touching Christ you have to realize that God cannot touch you without first touching Christ right so it says and the Lord visited Sarah as he said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken so this is something that he said he would do even though she laughed even though she tried to bring about a son uh another son which that son that she brought about called so many issues for them in the future and to the point that they're still dealing with those issues right to this day with ishmail and his children right it's the same exact decision that Eve did the that one decision that Eve made affected Humanity for so long and that one decision that Sarah made has still affected Humanity right now right it says for for Sarah conceived and bear Abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God had spoken to him right at the set time at which God had spoken to him God had a time in his mind when he wanted this thing to happen right and when Sarah tried to rush that process it didn't change the time right and a lot of times you know when we go through our troubles when we go through our our our battles and we feel that our faith is shaken sometime you know uh it sickness when you're really really sick and I'm talking about really really really really sick it will try your faith um it's a faith isn't something that is a um uh um uh an expression or an emotion they say faith is a sword it's something you fight with right it's not something that you're you're using to uh be happy all the time it's something you're using to slice things away to stand on the word of God I remember one time I had caught the stomach bug and it put me on my back for some days and I'm telling you right now and and in your mind you know God can heal you right then and there right and so it's tough to think about these things while you're sitting there and you're struggling and you're and you're going through and it's like Lord I know you're here and you can do something about it and then and and and I believe it's in those moments is well what do you think about it what do you still think about me right and it's those moments that God is trying to test because God loves to receive worship when you're really really really going through things I believe that's when God really really really is uh uh uh gets gets gets Glory out of uh uh out of worship when you're really struggling right you know what God can do you know what he's done in your life you know how fast he can act but you're going through a trial right and you're still having to worship him you're still having to uh uh uh um give him praise right so um when you're wanting to receive something from God the first thing that you have to realize is if God has said something it's already done that has to be the Genesis that has to be the uh uh that has to be your foundation that has to be everything that you hold dear to one that God has said it it's already done right it's already there uh uh no uh you don't need to figure out how to get to it you don't need to figure out how to uh uh how it's going to happen you don't need to uh you don't need to trust in feelings and what your feelings saying all those things no God said this thing is going to happen and it's going to happen what do you want to get the holy SP whether you want healing whether you want Deliverance whether you want a job or anything if you have Wayward kids um you can't look at what happens in between because just like that situation when God came to Sarah and promised Sarah that she would receive the son a lot of stuff happened in between a lot of stuff happened in between that wasn't uh uh NE necessarily uh giving God the glory with Abraham lying and uh Sarah kind of uh Sarah doubting the word of God and La you can't look at what happens in between because a lot of times when we ask God for something and then we're expecting it to happen we're thinking about nothing is going to happen in between we're not really thinking about what can happen in between right but you have to realize that when you pray for that wayward child it could get worse and the prophet even said that he said sometimes when you prayed for and God gives you the word things get worse true things get worse things get worse and that's opposite to how we think when things should happen so for example that with that situation with the garage when he says hey I'm going to fix the garage you're expecting this thing to go by with no problems and no issues and just it's going to work again but the prophet says that when you get prayed for and God says you're healed or promis you to something things can get a lot worse and it's in those moments that we have to always look back at what he said right and it's and it's a beautiful thing that we can we can look at the sun uh uh uh as an example and you know we can think about Job um you know when job was going through his situation right when job was going through his trial um and he was a um friends forsake friends didn't believe him uh uh wife forsook him right no more resources um I I and he had and he had the stars as a Bible I wonder if he ever took a look at the rising of the Sun the rising and the setting of the sun right but the thing about uh uh the rising and the setting of the sun is you have to wait for the sun to rise to shine on you God has to give you the Revelation that something's going to happen right it can't be somebody else give you the revelation God has to give you your own personal revelation and when Jo caught that Revelation that my redeemer liveth there was nothing that could take him out of that trial there's nothing that could shake him out of that trial when God revealed to him personally you're going to come out of this thing job said I know for a fact my redeemer liveth right right so you can claim hold you can lay hold of those claims and I want you to realize that while you're going through the testing while you're going through the trials while you're going through the waiting God's trying to build something else up inside of you God is trying to build Roots because a lot of times you know we want something we want a blessing right but it's there's more levels to God the world just wants things they want riches they want money they want good jobs they want families but there's more to stuff that we don't see as uh uh as uh uh as men uh living in the earth God doesn't want you just to have a blessing he wants you to be able to keep a blessing all right and that's another part of the equation that people don't realize is that when you receive something can you keep it and can you still be the same you when you receive it right oh people want to be healed but what are you going to do after you get healed am right while you're sitting there uh crying on the on a bed of Affliction I mean you're in pain I mean you're you're you're really really going through and you're saying God touch me and God says if I touch you what you going to do after this if you're just going to go back into the world you know you treat God like some kind of entertainment or something like that where he just heals you you just go do what you want right so um when you're going through a situation when you're waiting God is building Roots inside of you so that when you've gotten what you've received you can keep it right so you know in the waiting for a church you know there are a lot of problems that come with having a big church there's a lot of problems that we don't see and we can't conceive about we don't know what to uh what what what's going to come with it because if let's say God blesses us with a 200 member church or 300 member church right what comes with that that's right right it's not just coming to church and sitting down and just hearing a message and uh seeing this seeing uh uh same seeing the same fa that we always seen no it's more levels to this thing cuz now you're attracting different kind of spirits and all that kind of stuff and God in you're waiting God wants to root you down so that when you come to that thing you ain't changing right things don't change you're still spirit and truth right you're still telling the truth of the spirit of God right so God wants to build those roots down inside you so that when you get that job or that promotion right because when you get a promotion there's a lot of stuff that comes with it I want to tell you I want to tell you right now that job God gave job a double blessing and it was a beautiful blessing but I guarantee you it came with more troubles and the only reason I can say that is because ecclesiastics said there's a time and season for everything as long as we're on this wor and as long as God gives you something you going to have ups and downs when Sarah and uh um Sarah and um Abraham received Isaac Isaac made Isaac got on their nerves sometimes right hey you know you're going to go through some and when God gives you a job you're going to go through some when God gives you a promotion to get more money you're you're going to go through things that were even you're going to go through more harder tests than what you had felt before and so what God likes to do is before he gives you something because when God puts his name on to something it's got to be smooth it's got to be firm it's got to be settled it's got to be just like the sun in the middle of the of the uh of the universe not moving but just shining all the time right when he puts his name on something so he's got to root you first before giving you the blessing and so in the waiting in the trying times and in the tribulation God's trying to mold you to be worthy to hold this blessing or else we'd all be like the prodal son the prodical son uh uh which is an example God has given us the prodical son had a blessing with no roots and when he took that b and when he took that blessing and left his father's house he squandered it right next thing you know he's inside of a pig pin right eating brother Jack he's a uh with pork and Jews didn't even believe in pigs they thought that they were Unholy things and now he's in the midst of this pig right uh uh in a situation that was opposite of what he came from right because he had a blessing but he didn't have roots with it right and God's a good father and when God because a lot of times you know you'll see people on social media you'll see a lot of kids that have wealthy parents and they'll you know give them nice cards and they'll give them nice things but they don't really understand what it took to get that stuff and to keep those things and so they look at it as if it's something uh of little value because there was no work that they had to put in to receive it God is the exact opposite right and and and that's why cuz a lot of times when God said I'll when God told the Israelites I'll send you a king right Jesus Christ was that King Jesus Christ was that deliverer but he was born in a manger God wanted to make sure that before he gave Christ that seat in heaven that he had roots to go with that blessing so God Christ was born in a major right he rose up as a k he rose up he was a kid he was a carpenter he did humble work he was tried he was tempted he was tested right even on the day when he went walked through calary they spit on him and uh uh they whipped him and uh the prophet says he didn't say nothing back he didn't say nothing back and he had all power in his hands to turn the situation around but he didn't say nothing back because he knew that Roots were being built below him so that when God raised him up into the position of King and all power in his hand he can trust his judgments and when God wants to put you into a situation you know bless us with a bigger Church bless us with a job he wants to be able to trust the judgments we make when stuff happens and you have to realize that judgments uh judgments don't happen when things are always good judgment happens when emotions are flying high all right and can try to shake you and try to move you but when you've been tried and fired when you've been staying with the word you've been rooted down when something comes across cross you you can say no no no no no we're staying with the word right we're staying with the word whether 150 people leave our church or not and we're just in a big building with us what we had before we're going to stay with the word right we're going to stay with the word you know we get our healing right and uh God heals our body we've been stressing we've been growing and some people you know deal with uh uh diabeties and all these things you know Lord if you heal me even after you heal me I'm going to stay with the word I'm going to going to stay serving you I'm not going to use this time where I was once in pain to just go back to just living in the world no I'm going to come and serve you I'm going to come to your house when Hannah made that prayer and said Lord when if you give me this kid I'm going to raise him to serve you right God said you said the exact thing that I wanted to hear and gave her a son that did a mighty work right so God is looking to make Roots inside of us so that when we get that promotion and that next step that next level in our life it's it glorifies him because God is a God that uh people don't realize God is a God that doesn't always want to just kind of control you around and just move you around and force you around God wants to trust you God wants to say hey man if I just walk push you out that way I trust you're going to make the right choices and if I just send you off this way I trust that you're going to make the right choices the prophet one time he was he was going to heal somebody he said I'm waiting on what the Lord's going to say and angel came back said I'm looking to see what you going to do right so God wants to build that confidence in us that he can just send us right off and we'll make the right choices but we first have to be rooted in him and in closing um it's it's it's it's the love of God that does this for us because the whole theme of this year has been restoration and when God created Adam in the beginning of the garden he trusted him he didn't have to put Adam through trials you have to realized that Adam wasn't born by sexual means that we are born which is a weakness which is something that God had to purify us from but Adam was a direct spoken word of God and God had confidence in Adam to make the right choices even when he fell he still made the good choice of deciding not to put his wife away and that was a type of Christ of taking on Eve sin and Christ taking on our sin he still made a good choice right and God is looking for us that when he elevates us to the next level no matter the pressures of life no matter what uh um no matter what the next level brings the the uh the stresses the uh because it's these these stresses in life are serious you have people living on the street that don't even know who they are strung out on drugs right and I'm I'm here to tell you they were once just like you they were once just like you they once had a right mind they once knew knew left from right they once knew how to get a job they once knew how to function in society they once had a father a mother a sister but somewhere along the way the stresses and the toils of life just put them down into a position to now they're a prodal son don't even know who they are don't even know where they came from and living like that day after day after day after day after day no God wants us to be strengthened God wants us to be rooted so even if we were to be in a position where we were like that we'd still be giving him glory we'd still know our identity we'd still be giving him praise right and that builds Roots right so we're going to say a prayer a closing prayer Lord Jesus we thank you for your word oh Lord God Lord God we know oh Lord God that you're the infallible God lord there's nothing too hard for you oh Lord God lord we know Lord God that you can come on the scene oh Lord God and change things around in a second oh Lord God we know oh Lord God that that power belongs to you and you only but Lord sometimes you want us to wait Lord sometimes you want us just to set still Lord God and go through the trials and the and and the tribulations oh Lord God so it'll purify us oh Lord God it'll make us worthy in your sight oh Lord God so that when you take us up to the next level oh Lord Jesus Christ we're we're pleasing to you oh Lord God the decisions we make we're pleasing to you because it'll there'll be situations where you know if we get that promotion you know somewhere else high up will want us to come compromise on the job oh Lord God and if we haven't been rooted in you Lord we would fall oh Lord Jesus Christ but Lord you're trying to get out all that unbelief and the doubt oh Lord Jesus Christ so that when we get to the next level oh Lord God if it comes between your word and the word we choose your word and not the world oh Lord Jesus Christ to please you oh Lord God to make sure everything that we're doing in our life is pleasing unto you oh Lord God Lord we thank you for the word oh Lord God lord many are out there with different situations oh Lord God lord you never promise that you'd give us the time or when it would be over oh Lord but you promise that you'd always be with us oh Lord so Lord I pray over them oh Lord Jesus Christ Let Your Presence be known to them oh Lord God Let Your Presence always be knowing oh Lord God that you're with them and that you're going through the trial with them oh Lord God let that be the the at the center of their souls oh Lord God to know you're with them oh Lord God and that's enough oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord we we bless this meeting oh Lord God we pray pray for the saints that are um in London oh Lord God May the services be fruitful oh Lord God and you bring them back safely Lord and we ask this in the precious name of Jesus Christ [Applause] amen amen amen praise the Lord such a wonderful edifying message amen I just found it just so I don't know if he planned it that way but you know the prophet preached a message rising of the sun and it was an Easter message amen so we're just getting our Easter getting ready for Easter brother Quin just preaching there about the rising of the Sun and uh the different changes and the dark times that you go through in your life you know and the prophet was talking about there and that message that very Mage is the rising of the Sun that uh the first time that the Sun rose up on the earth amen it was uh uh uh there in Genesis when he said let there be light amen he didn't know we didn't know how long we were seeds laying there in the in the ground in that dark place he said it was a gloomy time amen laying there in darkness but it was the rising of the Sun that woke us up and quickened us into into life amen uh just see how uh like he was saying some of us work at night some of us got to go to work tonight amen but I thank God that my maybe my body has to go to work at night but it's a deeper Revelation amen that it's the rising of the sun and the revelation of this hour amen that has woken me out of the darkness amen and quickened me to a a life of immortality amen beyond the mortality that we see amen that has taken us to another place of Revelation amen taking us out of the Dark Places of the world Amen and giving us that Faith amen that no matter what we go through we understand and we realize amen that God is still in control amen that the trials uh uh that we go through are just there to make us stronger amen and one of the most profound things he said he talked about how uh uh it's preparing us for the next level amen the trials and the tribulations some of the things that we're going through just to prepare us for the next level I had been saying for the longest is that uh uh uh when we when when he promote us to the next level Amen to another church and beware just get ready cuz the trouble is coming amen the trials and the tribulation are coming people will start coming they see a building there and they see you doing well and everything people come amen but they're bringing all kind of spirits with them amen they're babes in Christ and different things that we're going to have to be able to deal with those things amen and not all amen and not not fighting in the parking lot and carrying on Amen and how to how to handle situations he's preparing us now and he's grooming us that sometime we go through these clouds amen see the cloud sometime block out the Sun and and it's dark and it's a little bit gloomy man and you get a little bit down or whatever but you need those kind of days those days where you just stay inside it might be a little drizzly it might be a little gloomy but those are the times that we r on him we know that the sun is going to come out after a while amen we don't let it we don't just run away and quit when times get hard amen when the sun don't come out one day we don't just run and hide and say lord it's over with we know that soon as the cloud has passed over amen the Sun is going to come out again amen so we just appreciate brother Quenton for getting himself out of the way and uh uh just a real timely message there about the the rising of the Sun and how he started that out there amen being that with the the service just before Easter amen so uh I believe that uh it was it was uh ordained and a real really good message amen that was uh amen that we heard tonight so just be encouraged my brothers and sisters that whatever amen you go through whatever the things that you might be uh battling with it's all for the glory of the Lord it's all for the glory to take you another step higher he's preparing you for something amen you see different ones we're going through different it is preparing us for something amen so just rest amen rest in the hands of the Lord and be sure and very sure that your faithfulness in the in the trial in the battle he wants you to still be faithful not give up and not squ and not go slack no cuz then see what's going to happen is you're going to have to go through the trial again you're going to have to continue cuz he wants to make you amen a strong he allow your roots to go deeper in him amen that when that trial come amen you don't just topple over not what your high brother Jack T it a mushroom Christian but a solid oak tree amen a solid tree amen we just thank the GL for the word tonight amen just remember I'm not going to read all of the I guess we can't see birthdays and uh remember your
