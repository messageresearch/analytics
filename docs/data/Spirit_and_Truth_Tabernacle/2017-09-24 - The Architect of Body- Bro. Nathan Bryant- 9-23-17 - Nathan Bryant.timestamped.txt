[29:37] they didn't have rules and get him in so
[29:41] he acts as friends to take them to the
[29:44] roof and they began to just take that
[29:46] roof apart and they dropped the man down
[29:49] inside of the presence of the Lord I was
[29:52] just digging itself you know the story

[51:36] praise the Lord so a man we're not going
[51:38] to take too much time we we were we
[51:42] wanted to dedicate this service tonight
[51:44] to preaching on the word and then we
[51:47] wanted to have a prayer line and
[51:50] initially what I want to do is a man I
[51:53] know that everybody certainly welcome to
[51:55] come to the prayer line but but the the
[51:58] first one is right after the minister
[52:00] comes from under these anointing the
[52:03] first ones that I would like to come
[52:04] into the Carolinas those that have
[52:07] really really
[52:09] you know you know that you're going
[52:11] through something really tough you need
[52:12] or you need a touch from ground I'm not
[52:14] talking about a headache I'm talking
[52:16] about you got something we just saw God
[52:18] heal cancer here in our church and we
[52:22] praise the Lord
[52:26] and man it's not the first time that
[52:30] he's done it he's done it before but you
[52:32] know we were we were there brother
[52:33] Nathan and our sisters wanted prayer and
[52:36] he'll share it a little bit later on but
[52:38] we saw God humor
[52:39] we saw got healer and and when we saw
[52:42] that we just felt like there was a
[52:43] spirit was moving a man at this time and
[52:47] when the angels trouble in the water
[52:48] that's when you got to jump in right
[52:51] that's when you got to jump in so we
[52:53] wanted to just invite anybody was sick
[52:55] in their bodies I've called people that
[52:57] I knew had cancer and I invited them to
[52:59] come out and you know and even though
[53:01] they might not have been able to make it
[53:02] there's there's some that was telling me
[53:04] sometimes you're going through your body
[53:06] state you just attacked you so much and
[53:09] he just you know even it starts changing
[53:10] the way that you're looking the way you
[53:12] feel about yourself and sometimes people
[53:14] just don't want to come a man because of
[53:17] that but you know we can still pray for
[53:19] them in anyway you know that the word of
[53:21] the Lord can go right where they are and
[53:23] bring healing to their body if they're
[53:25] open to it so tonight a man will have
[53:28] those that are really initially at the
[53:31] start of the prayer line we want those
[53:32] that you know that you're going through
[53:34] something a man and you need God to
[53:36] really touch your body we want you to
[53:39] come into prayer line first and a man we
[53:41] want you just to come and take your time
[53:43] and just let let brother Nathan pray
[53:44] with you and for you and then you know
[53:46] those that like I got a little something
[53:49] I'm going through my body my leg been
[53:50] bothering me about three months I want
[53:52] to get prayer tonight you know but but I
[53:54] want to give first space to to those
[53:56] that I know that might have something
[53:58] like serious a lot more serious than
[53:59] what I'm going through
[54:00] but I believe God's concerned about Amy
[54:02] in every case tonight even if you come
[54:05] with faith I believe God can heal you
[54:07] and the other thing that we would teach
[54:08] her in this church a man you don't have
[54:10] to be a Christian to get your healing
[54:13] you don't have to be a Christian to get
[54:15] healing you don't but if you want to
[54:17] keep your healing then you got to become
[54:20] a Christian amen that's why Jesus said
[54:24] go and sin no more
[54:25] alright cuz if you want to keep your
[54:27] healing you've got to become a Christian
[54:29] but in men we just want to open up this
[54:31] we just were just concerned about people
[54:33] tonight and we want to we just want to
[54:35] pray for years the Lord would allow amen
[54:37] our precious brother just to deal with
[54:39] those situations and and we're not here
[54:41] to try to push people down and knock
[54:42] them down and and in the name of Jesus
[54:45] not just gonna be a simple word of
[54:46] Prayer you become a simple faith you

[1:00:56] service
[1:00:58] there was a man that died in the middle
[1:01:01] of the service for the West Cohen
[1:01:03] brother Ferguson but the Billy Paul went

[1:01:42] not mine but I'm gonna try not to preach
[1:01:44] very long tonight because the prayer
[1:01:46] line but I want to just take a little
[1:01:48] thought here for a little bit and then I
[1:01:51] want to read you some scriptures and
[1:01:52] quotes in the line of thought for
[1:01:54] healing since we're gonna have a prayer
[1:01:56] line with the help of the Lord tonight I
[1:01:58] want you to first turn with me if you
[1:02:00] would to Genesis chapter 2 Genesis
[1:02:04] chapter 2 and just want to look at one
[1:02:06] verse there tonight brother Branham
[1:02:14] taught us that Satan hates this book and
[1:02:16] the book of Revelation more than any
[1:02:19] other books in the Bible because the
[1:02:23] book of Genesis tells us where he came
[1:02:25] from and all of his tactics what what we
[1:02:27] see today the evils in the world today
[1:02:29] started back in Genesis and the book of
[1:02:32] Revelation shows him where he's going to
[1:02:34] wind up at so he hates these two books
[1:02:37] Genesis chapter 2 verse 7 and the Lord
[1:02:41] God formed man of the dust of the ground
[1:02:44] and breathed into his nostrils the
[1:02:48] breath of life and man became a living
[1:02:52] soul I want to speak to you tonight
[1:02:55] with the help of the Lord on the
[1:02:56] architect of our bodies the architect of
[1:03:00] our bodies let's just bow our heads
[1:03:02] together your heavenly father Lord as we
[1:03:04] approach your throne again tonight Lord
[1:03:07] feeling your presence here is the songs
[1:03:09] of Zion we're sang and roar just feeling
[1:03:11] an atmosphere of worship to be able to
[1:03:13] come together Lord and the scripture
[1:03:17] teaches us that where your Spirit is
[1:03:19] there's Liberty Father and Lord what a
[1:03:21] blessing it is to have liberty and
[1:03:23] freedom in the spirit Lord to have the
[1:03:25] truth that we've rallied around in this
[1:03:27] age Lord that that there's been a
[1:03:29] restoration of the word back and those
[1:03:31] things that have been lost down through
[1:03:33] the ages yet they were right there in
[1:03:35] the pages of our Bible all along but yet
[1:03:37] in this age there's been a restoration
[1:03:39] back to the original truth we thank you
[1:03:41] for that father we thank you for eyes to
[1:03:43] see and ears to hear father we thank you
[1:03:46] Lord that you've given us a love for the
[1:03:49] truth because the Bible teaches us that
[1:03:51] there would be many in this last day
[1:03:53] that wouldn't have a love for the truth
[1:03:55] and they'd be turned over to evil
[1:03:57] thoughts and they'd be turned over to
[1:03:59] believe a lie instead of the truth
[1:04:01] because they didn't love the truth but
[1:04:03] we thank you for a love for the truth in
[1:04:05] this age Lord we thank you for placing
[1:04:07] that down in our hearts Lord we need
[1:04:09] more of you tonight or there's many here
[1:04:11] that are sick and body and order that
[1:04:13] have scars whether they be physical or
[1:04:16] emotional or spiritual whatever it would
[1:04:18] be Lord as they come through the prayer
[1:04:20] line tonight I just ask that you would
[1:04:22] touch each one Lord and give them a
[1:04:24] touch from you in a way that only you
[1:04:26] can Father are our hands as human
[1:04:29] vessels are a poor substitute Lord for
[1:04:31] yours but yet we're taught that you have
[1:04:33] no hands but ours no lips but ours no
[1:04:36] feet but ours Lord if you're gonna do
[1:04:38] work down here on earth that you work
[1:04:40] through the body of Christ which is
[1:04:41] present here in the form of your bride
[1:04:43] Lord and that if someone's going to be
[1:04:46] encouraged Lord that she'll use a person
[1:04:49] to go and encourage them if somebody's
[1:04:50] going to be healed you'll use a person
[1:04:52] to go pray for them or to lay hands on
[1:04:54] them lord if and whatever it would be
[1:04:56] father you're still using the body
[1:04:58] tonight Lord and it's a body move of
[1:05:00] believers around the world not just in
[1:05:02] West Palm Beach or not just a New Albany
[1:05:04] Indiana but the
[1:05:05] have a body move in this age that you're
[1:05:08] still moving Lord in China and Zimbabwe
[1:05:11] in South Africa and up in Europe and
[1:05:13] down into Australia and all over the
[1:05:16] world father there's members of your
[1:05:18] bride that are working together Lord to
[1:05:20] try to get us ready Father for that day
[1:05:23] that's approaching when you would come
[1:05:24] back for its Lord and we just want to
[1:05:27] make our hearts ready tonight father if
[1:05:29] there's anything that would be I'm
[1:05:30] pleasing to you in our life Lord may we
[1:05:32] lay it aside tonight and if there's
[1:05:34] things that have hindered our walk with
[1:05:35] you and we recognize that Lord maybe
[1:05:38] they prevented us from getting into the
[1:05:40] fellowship that we should have with you
[1:05:42] father help us to lay them aside tonight
[1:05:44] and to run quickly to you father the
[1:05:46] author and finisher of our faith we give
[1:05:49] you the glory and the praise for the
[1:05:50] testimonies that we believe will come
[1:05:52] forth from this service tonight
[1:05:53] in Jesus Christ's name the church said
[1:05:57] amen god bless you can be seated tonight
[1:06:07] the Bible says here that God formed man
[1:06:10] of the dust of the ground now originally
[1:06:15] if we go back to the very beginning it
[1:06:17] tells us in Genesis chapter 1 in the
[1:06:20] beginning God created the heavens and
[1:06:22] the earth and when God began to speak
[1:06:24] there was nothing there had never been
[1:06:27] anything God was out in eternity and we
[1:06:30] think many times in our humanistic way
[1:06:33] we think in measures of days and weeks
[1:06:36] and months as we just sang about we
[1:06:38] think of you know we can imagine a
[1:06:41] hundred years pretty easy a thousand
[1:06:43] years is really hard for us to grasp but
[1:06:45] we can think back into history for a
[1:06:47] thousand years or even back to the
[1:06:49] beginning of time but to think of
[1:06:51] eternity it's really hard for our human
[1:06:53] mind to grasp it that there never was a
[1:06:56] beginning there never was an end that
[1:06:58] God in His infinite power was out there
[1:07:01] in eternity with his own thoughts and
[1:07:03] there had never been light he was
[1:07:05] dwelling out there in darkness but one
[1:07:08] day he begins to speak and when he
[1:07:10] begins to speak these thoughts that he
[1:07:12] had in his mind throughout eternity
[1:07:14] God's not like us he doesn't learn
[1:07:16] something new every day
[1:07:18] he can't change and make a better way
[1:07:20] than what he did in the first place but
[1:07:22] God in his in his eternal thinking he
[1:07:25] had these thoughts but he had never
[1:07:27] vocalized them and he he had held this
[1:07:30] in his thinking he had never spoke it
[1:07:32] forth because it wasn't time yet and he
[1:07:35] knew that at least spoke these thoughts
[1:07:37] they would spin into existence and one
[1:07:40] day he recognizes that it's time for a
[1:07:43] light to come into existence and he said
[1:07:45] let there be lights now he didn't have a
[1:07:48] Zippo lighter he didn't have a
[1:07:49] flashlight he didn't have a spotlight he
[1:07:52] didn't have anything to produce this
[1:07:54] light except his spoken word but when he
[1:07:58] began to speak the word weather had
[1:08:00] never been light before life began to
[1:08:02] burst forth and separate the darkness
[1:08:05] from the light it's still doing it today
[1:08:08] light is still dividing the darkness
[1:08:11] from the light and he begins to speak
[1:08:14] and I'll skip ahead a little bit and
[1:08:16] read Hebrews chapter 11 verse 3 it says
[1:08:18] through faith we understand that the
[1:08:20] worlds were framed by the Word of God so
[1:08:25] that things which are seen were not made
[1:08:28] of things which do appear that means
[1:08:31] when you look around the room tonight
[1:08:33] you can look at your own hand you can
[1:08:35] look at these walls you can look at the
[1:08:37] seat you can look at the carpet you can
[1:08:39] look at this leather-bound Bible or this
[1:08:40] wooden dansker whatever you would look
[1:08:43] at anything you can see visibly with
[1:08:45] your eyes was formed by things that were
[1:08:48] invisible by things which we couldn't
[1:08:51] see you Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 says
[1:08:54] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:08:56] for the evidence of things that we can't
[1:08:59] even see faith produces things that
[1:09:03] aren't even tangible to us faith
[1:09:06] produces things that you know it's even
[1:09:08] hard for us to imagine but faith goes
[1:09:11] out and proclaims that brute venom
[1:09:13] teaches it this way he said that God
[1:09:15] believed his own word and that was what
[1:09:18] produced it when God spoke it forth he
[1:09:21] believed his own word and when he said
[1:09:24] let there be light there was
[1:09:26] when he said let there be a heavens and
[1:09:28] let there be an earth he didn't have
[1:09:30] timbers he didn't have plaster he didn't
[1:09:32] have nails and screws he didn't have
[1:09:34] anything if we were to go and build
[1:09:36] something we could tangibly go down to
[1:09:38] Home Depot or Lowe's or whatever you
[1:09:40] have and we could pick out the boards
[1:09:42] that we thought were the best and we
[1:09:44] could pick out the best drywall and we
[1:09:46] could our most brothers could I'm not a
[1:09:47] very good carpenter but some brothers
[1:09:49] can begin to design something they could
[1:09:52] build up walls and they could make you
[1:09:53] nice pillars for you know to support
[1:09:56] while ceilings in your homes and they
[1:09:59] could begin to design all this and you
[1:10:01] can sit back and think oh my there's the
[1:10:03] gift that God has gave them to be able
[1:10:05] to build but God when he went to build
[1:10:07] he didn't have any materials to build
[1:10:09] with he couldn't go down to Lowe's or
[1:10:12] Home Depot and buy him some dust he
[1:10:15] couldn't go down to Lowe's or Home Depot
[1:10:17] and buy him a tree or buying the flower
[1:10:19] or buying some grass he couldn't go down
[1:10:22] and get grass seed and fertilizer but he
[1:10:24] began to speak and the first lanes of
[1:10:27] grass and the first trees and the first
[1:10:30] tangible things the first speck of dust
[1:10:32] begin to come into existence where it
[1:10:35] had been invisible a few moments before
[1:10:37] but the spoken word of God began to go
[1:10:40] forth and he began to create dust and
[1:10:44] some of you sisters do your best to keep
[1:10:46] it out of your house it's a creation of
[1:10:48] God he began to speak dust particles and
[1:10:54] sand particles and dirt particles and he
[1:10:57] began to speak and where there was
[1:10:59] nothing hid begin to form and it began
[1:11:01] to form the first tree and from that
[1:11:03] tree there was the seeds in these trees
[1:11:05] that he spoke forth that would be in
[1:11:08] every tree down through the ages what
[1:11:10] was needed was in these original trees
[1:11:12] that he planted every piece of grass
[1:11:15] that covers the face of the earth I
[1:11:17] don't know how big he started with I
[1:11:19] don't know if he started with the
[1:11:20] football field I don't know if he
[1:11:21] started with the one by one square or
[1:11:23] one blade of grass but every seed that
[1:11:26] would ever need to be for grass for all
[1:11:28] of the earth was in that original grass
[1:11:30] that he
[1:11:31] created every seed for every son and
[1:11:34] daughter of God that would ever be was
[1:11:36] in that first man that he created and
[1:11:39] all I know today in this age you know
[1:11:41] people divided over race and over
[1:11:43] culture and over jock geographic
[1:11:45] location but every one of us was in that
[1:11:48] first man that God spoke forth and
[1:11:51] created at the seed for every man and
[1:11:53] every woman that would ever live was
[1:11:55] right there placed in the Garden of Eden
[1:11:57] and God speaks it and there was nothing
[1:12:01] but he begins to form man out of the
[1:12:03] dust of the earth now I don't know about
[1:12:05] you if we were to go out here you know
[1:12:07] we in Indiana about every third year we
[1:12:10] get enough snow to make a snowman you
[1:12:12] probably don't get enough snow to make a
[1:12:13] snowman in 50 years but but about every
[1:12:16] three years we get one you know if you
[1:12:18] go out and make a snowman but he made
[1:12:21] man out of the dust and if you was to go
[1:12:23] out here and get you some dust and begin
[1:12:25] to pack it together and get you some
[1:12:27] water and you make it the best that you
[1:12:28] could make it and it would probably look
[1:12:30] like a mess and you go out and get you a
[1:12:32] carrot for a nose and some sticks for a
[1:12:34] hands and some sticks for legs and you
[1:12:36] set it out there and you know it might
[1:12:38] resemble somebody might be able to say
[1:12:40] you know that kind of resembles a human
[1:12:42] being but I don't know what it is it
[1:12:44] looks like a mess but when God began to
[1:12:46] speak and to be able to create this a
[1:12:48] man from the dust of the earth where
[1:12:54] there was nothing and he takes a handful
[1:12:57] of destiny says and there's a man
[1:13:00] standing in the garden with the same
[1:13:04] amount of teeth that you have maybe more
[1:13:07] depending on how many you've lost with
[1:13:12] the same amount of bones that you have
[1:13:14] with the same amount of arteries and car
[1:13:17] puzzles and the same amount of brain
[1:13:20] cells the same lungs the same heart
[1:13:23] everything that you have God just goes
[1:13:25] let there be
[1:13:27] [Applause]
[1:13:30] he didn't hatch him as an embryo for
[1:13:33] nine months he didn't have an incubator
[1:13:36] that he could raise him in he didn't
[1:13:37] grow him up from a little tiny cell and
[1:13:39] into a baby and then to a teenager he
[1:13:42] speaks and hears
[1:13:43] full-grown man standing in the garden
[1:13:46] God formed the man of the dust of the
[1:13:49] earth where there was nothing to form
[1:13:52] him with he couldn't go down like some
[1:13:55] of these guys do you know under harvest
[1:13:57] a kidney from somebody and and put in
[1:13:59] somebody else and he couldn't go down to
[1:14:01] a heart transplant there was no heart
[1:14:02] there was no kidney there was no nothing
[1:14:04] to form it from but he takes the dust of
[1:14:07] the earth and he says let there be and
[1:14:10] there was now I'm gonna read you some
[1:14:11] statistics here about the human body if
[1:14:14] some of your doctors or nurses or things
[1:14:16] like that you may already know this but
[1:14:17] it says I'm gonna read a few from
[1:14:19] Wikipedia first it says almost 99% of
[1:14:23] the mass of the human body is made up of
[1:14:26] six elements oxygen carbon hydrogen
[1:14:29] nitrogen calcium and phosphorus 99% of
[1:14:35] your body is made up of those six
[1:14:38] elements now recognize there's some of
[1:14:40] us here that have more of those elements
[1:14:41] and some of us that have less of those
[1:14:43] elements because there's more or less of
[1:14:45] us here than somebody else but we all
[1:14:48] have these same six elements within us
[1:14:52] oxygen carbon hydrogen nitrogen calcium
[1:14:55] and phosphorus 99% of your body is made
[1:14:59] up of those six elements down about 0.85
[1:15:03] of the rest of you is composed of
[1:15:06] another five elements potassium sulfur
[1:15:08] sodium chlorine and magnesium and all
[1:15:11] eleven of these of these elements are
[1:15:15] necessary for you to have life you take
[1:15:19] any one of these elements you take the
[1:15:21] calcium out completely or the phosphorus
[1:15:24] or the potassium or the sulfur any of
[1:15:26] these eleven elements you take it
[1:15:28] completely out of the human body and you
[1:15:30] will cease to exist as far as a life a
[1:15:33] breathing living body now there would
[1:15:35] still be a shell of a human being laying
[1:15:36] there like we've taken put in the
[1:15:38] graveyard but you couldn't have life
[1:15:40] without these eleven that are necessary
[1:15:42] now the remaining elements which I guess
[1:15:44] would be 0.15 elements of your body are
[1:15:48] trace elements of which are more than a
[1:15:51] dozen are thought on the basis of good
[1:15:53] evidence to be necessary of life so God
[1:15:56] when he
[1:15:57] put this together he was very specific
[1:15:59] he didn't just randomly and haphazardly
[1:16:01] put it together and then when the next
[1:16:02] person came out you know this wouldn't
[1:16:04] had a little bit more of this and that
[1:16:06] went a little bit more of that he places
[1:16:08] all of these elements in the human body
[1:16:09] that are necessary for life now people
[1:16:12] want to teach us about random selection
[1:16:14] and evolution and things like that but
[1:16:16] I'll be honest with you I don't have
[1:16:17] enough faith to believe all that I don't
[1:16:21] have enough faith to believe that we
[1:16:23] that all this just randomly happened and
[1:16:24] that you're just randomly sitting here
[1:16:26] tonight because you know some speck
[1:16:29] crawled out of the mud 50 million years
[1:16:31] ago and it begins to evolve gradually
[1:16:33] I've got a little bit more confidence in
[1:16:35] the human specie than that and you know
[1:16:37] some of some people you know it makes us
[1:16:39] wonder sometimes but we have a little
[1:16:41] bit more confidence than the human
[1:16:42] specie than that and just see even let's
[1:16:45] just do away with the human race and not
[1:16:47] even look at that right now but to look
[1:16:49] at nature and to look at the solar
[1:16:51] system to look at galaxies and to look
[1:16:53] out in the vast expanses of space and
[1:16:57] bodies and solar systems and Suns and
[1:17:00] stars and moons and in God places this
[1:17:03] earth just the right distance away from
[1:17:05] the Sun that we won't burn up any places
[1:17:08] it's just close enough to the Sun so
[1:17:11] that we won't freeze and he puts a
[1:17:12] rotation to where there can be changes
[1:17:15] in the climate and changes in the
[1:17:16] seasons and so that brother Nathan wants
[1:17:18] to come evangelize Florida around
[1:17:20] November and December January and and he
[1:17:22] places all this in a cycle and the Sun
[1:17:25] will rotate you know or the earth will
[1:17:27] rotate around in its orbit and it'll
[1:17:29] cross around the Sun in a specific
[1:17:31] pattern in the year and it'll spin
[1:17:33] itself around in a 24-hour cycle and you
[1:17:36] know the watches no matter how good to
[1:17:38] watch you get after a few days or a few
[1:17:40] weeks or a few months it's gonna be off
[1:17:42] a few seconds or a few minutes or fast a
[1:17:44] few minutes or a few seconds but it
[1:17:46] keeps perfect timing has never missed a
[1:17:48] beat has never missed a second except
[1:17:51] for that time that Joshua said son stand
[1:17:53] still
[1:17:56] and the spoken word of a man stopped in
[1:17:59] earth that God had put into Herbet orbit
[1:18:01] because it wasn't the man that was
[1:18:03] speaking it was God that was speaking
[1:18:05] through the man no man can do that if
[1:18:09] you can go out here tomorrow and prove
[1:18:10] it to me there's no human being that can
[1:18:13] produce that but it was the spoken word
[1:18:15] of God being quickened through the human
[1:18:17] lips of a man
[1:18:18] and so God places all this now if you
[1:18:21] were to go and you were to buy a Swiss
[1:18:23] watch
[1:18:24] you know maybe several thousand dollars
[1:18:25] and you were to take it apart into
[1:18:27] little bitty pieces in the frame and and
[1:18:29] the band and the glass cover and each
[1:18:32] gear and each each little band and
[1:18:35] needle and and every little hand and all
[1:18:38] that and he was to take it apart into a
[1:18:39] hundred tiny little pieces and you was
[1:18:41] to take a little silk bag and put it in
[1:18:44] that and he was to sit there and shake
[1:18:46] that in a bag for about five million
[1:18:48] years could you expect to open that out
[1:18:51] and the watch speed not only put
[1:18:52] together the way that it was designed to
[1:18:55] be but then it would be keeping perfect
[1:18:57] time and with the correct time I don't
[1:19:00] have that much faith but that's what
[1:19:03] these people yes what a lot of college
[1:19:04] professors will teach you that all this
[1:19:06] just happened randomly and it was just
[1:19:08] random choice but if it takes an
[1:19:10] intelligent design to make a faulty
[1:19:12] watch that will lose a few seconds or
[1:19:14] gain a few seconds how much more would
[1:19:16] it take an intelligent design to create
[1:19:19] a solar system in a world in a moon and
[1:19:22] a Sun in a galaxy that keeps perfect
[1:19:24] time and perfect rhythm and that he
[1:19:26] would place at Earth in a certain area
[1:19:28] that where it wouldn't burn up and yet
[1:19:30] it wouldn't freeze up and where we had
[1:19:31] just enough just enough of pressure on
[1:19:37] it that you wouldn't suffocate but yet
[1:19:39] that you wouldn't just float off into
[1:19:41] space somewhere that there would be
[1:19:42] enough gravity that would hold your feet
[1:19:44] on the earth so you wouldn't just fly
[1:19:46] off out into space but yet not so much
[1:19:48] gravity that it wouldn't just crush you
[1:19:50] into the ground that it would have just
[1:19:52] enough oxygen to where you could breathe
[1:19:54] but not so much oxygen that we would
[1:19:56] just combust and all these different
[1:19:58] elements that God would place in our
[1:20:00] atmosphere specifically so that we could
[1:20:02] live on it I don't have enough faith to
[1:20:04] believe that it just happened randomly
[1:20:05] but just as it would take an intelligent
[1:20:08] design to create a watch so to create a
[1:20:10] are to create a house it takes an
[1:20:12] intelligent design to be the architect
[1:20:15] of these bodies that are so complex your
[1:20:17] body is composed of 206 bones by
[1:20:20] adulthood after some bones are fused
[1:20:22] together you have approximately 320
[1:20:26] pairs of bilateral muscles that means
[1:20:28] you've got a 320 on this side and 320 on
[1:20:31] that side that they act you know the
[1:20:33] arms on your left arm act like the arms
[1:20:35] on your right arm and vice-versa 320
[1:20:37] pairs of bilateral muscles now some of
[1:20:40] you you know some of these are more
[1:20:41] defined than others as you know but but
[1:20:44] they're still you got the same amount of
[1:20:46] muscles the small intestine in an adult
[1:20:50] is about 23 feet long and the large
[1:20:53] intestine is about 5 feet long if all of
[1:20:57] your arteries and your veins and your
[1:20:59] capillaries in your human circulatory
[1:21:01] system were laid in to end how many how
[1:21:05] long do you think the length would be
[1:21:06] anybody want to guess a couple football
[1:21:10] fields okay anybody else
[1:21:13] five miles anybody else
[1:21:18] 60,000 miles you go and search it on
[1:21:22] Google when you get home tonight if you
[1:21:24] were to lay out all of your arteries and
[1:21:26] your veins and your capillaries it would
[1:21:31] be 60,000 miles stretched Indian some of
[1:21:35] you haven't even drove your your little
[1:21:37] minivans that far 60,000 miles and God
[1:21:43] places it and winds each capillary and
[1:21:46] each artery into each place that it's
[1:21:49] supposed to be this architect designs
[1:21:51] this if we were to try to divide to
[1:21:54] design 60,000 miles you know Trump's
[1:21:57] trying to build a wall that's just a few
[1:21:58] thousand miles long and it's gonna take
[1:22:00] forever to build if he ever gets it
[1:22:01] built and by the time he does there'll
[1:22:05] be a bunch of Mexicans on pogo sticks
[1:22:07] that will figure out a way to get over
[1:22:08] it but God plays 60,000 miles of
[1:22:14] arteries and veins and capillaries in
[1:22:19] your body and he didn't just throw them
[1:22:20] in there you know brother
[1:22:23] some of the brothers you know they'd
[1:22:25] have different types of jobs my daddy's
[1:22:27] a plumbing contractor and he you know he
[1:22:29] he puts pipes and things together in
[1:22:31] homes and and brother Troy he's an
[1:22:34] electrician he takes wires and he puts
[1:22:36] them through places but if they were
[1:22:37] just to jam all these wires into the
[1:22:39] wall and just jam about you know 50
[1:22:41] yards of them in there and then turn on
[1:22:43] the light switch and expect it to work
[1:22:44] nothing would happen because every every
[1:22:47] wire has to be connected to the right
[1:22:49] circuit and to the right breaker and
[1:22:50] it's got to go to the right outlet if
[1:22:52] you're going to expect a response and
[1:22:54] God wires 60,000 miles of arteries and
[1:22:59] capillaries so that your heart can pump
[1:23:01] and move things to the right place at
[1:23:03] the right time so that you can breathe
[1:23:05] and they say it's just as random
[1:23:07] selection I don't have that much faith
[1:23:09] your brain is made up of a complex
[1:23:12] network of billions of nerve cells
[1:23:16] called neurons and the number of neurons
[1:23:17] is estimated at roughly a hundred
[1:23:20] billion I know a lot of people think I
[1:23:22] have less than that but approximately a
[1:23:25] hundred billion neurons in your brain
[1:23:29] through faith we understand that the
[1:23:32] worlds were framed by the Word of God
[1:23:34] now you think about each one of us here
[1:23:37] how many how many millions of miles of
[1:23:40] arteries and capillaries if we put just
[1:23:42] everybody in this city together then you
[1:23:44] think about all the state of Florida
[1:23:46] then you think about all the United
[1:23:47] States and all of the world as a whole
[1:23:50] how many millions and billions of miles
[1:23:53] of veins did God have to place into this
[1:23:56] one seed in this man that it would come
[1:23:58] forth and it would produce and reproduce
[1:24:00] and reproduce and yet it wouldn't you
[1:24:03] know it wouldn't after 50,000 people say
[1:24:05] sorry this is just this is all there is
[1:24:07] to it everything was in those original
[1:24:09] seeds that God had placed back there at
[1:24:12] the beginning
[1:24:12] now you take a tape and you make a copy
[1:24:16] of a copy of a copy after a few copies
[1:24:17] it gets to where you you can't even
[1:24:19] hardly hear it or don't want to be
[1:24:20] around it but God made a copy of a copy
[1:24:22] of a copy of a copy down through the
[1:24:25] ages and it's still working the way that
[1:24:29] he intended it to work
[1:24:32] the impersonation of Christianity 1957
[1:24:35] brother Branham says remember here's
[1:24:38] encouragement for you people that's to
[1:24:40] be prayed for he's talking to you
[1:24:43] tonight for you people this to be prayed
[1:24:45] for if the Holy Spirit by brooding made
[1:24:48] the physical being who is the ARCA he
[1:24:51] says who is the architect of our bodies
[1:24:54] Oh God made people see it the Holy
[1:24:56] Spirit gave you your appendix your eyes
[1:24:58] your nose your mouth your hearts he goes
[1:25:01] on a little further he says if God did
[1:25:02] that without you having any say-so in it
[1:25:05] you never said make me thus who taking
[1:25:09] any thought could add one cubit to his
[1:25:10] stature but if he made you thus without
[1:25:13] you having anything to say how much more
[1:25:17] can he threw his routeing give you a
[1:25:19] choice if he could bring brother Troy
[1:25:22] here brother Troy couldn't pick you know
[1:25:24] and say I want to be a NFL football
[1:25:27] player son or I want to be a jazz
[1:25:29] musician son or I want to be a a
[1:25:31] Hollywood star son because I want to be
[1:25:32] able to have all the finances that I
[1:25:34] needed and he couldn't pick which family
[1:25:36] he was going to be connected with he
[1:25:38] couldn't pick what color hair he was
[1:25:39] gonna have what color skin he was gonna
[1:25:41] have what color eyes he was gonna add
[1:25:42] how tall he was gonna be how short he
[1:25:44] was gonna be what size shoe he couldn't
[1:25:46] pick any of that God just placed him
[1:25:48] here and if God could bring you here and
[1:25:51] give you an appendix and the eyes and a
[1:25:53] nose and a heart lungs and all that
[1:25:54] without you having any choice in it how
[1:25:58] much some more when something begins to
[1:25:59] break down in your body you say oh
[1:26:01] brother Nathan pray for me
[1:26:02] doctor says I have diabetes doctor says
[1:26:04] I have cancer doctor says have liver
[1:26:06] failure doctor says I have kidney stones
[1:26:08] how much more when some of these things
[1:26:10] begin to break down can you want you to
[1:26:12] have a choice and you say God I need
[1:26:14] your help you can say God I need your
[1:26:17] help when he was back there and your
[1:26:18] great-great Grandaddy somewhere as a
[1:26:20] seed that came down through your history
[1:26:22] of your genealogy you can pick back
[1:26:24] there and say God I need your help God I
[1:26:26] need you to get my
[1:26:27] great-great-granddaddy with my
[1:26:28] great-great grand mama so they can have
[1:26:30] my great-grandparents and they can have
[1:26:31] my grandparents and then my parents can
[1:26:34] meet you know at some restaurant and
[1:26:35] they can fall in love and they can have
[1:26:36] me
[1:26:37] god I need your help to get me here you
[1:26:39] couldn't say all that
[1:26:40] but God coordinated all of that and
[1:26:43] brought you here and placed you here
[1:26:45] without you having any choice in it how
[1:26:49] much some more can he do for you now
[1:26:51] that you can say god I need you God I
[1:26:55] need your help I recognize that I'm a
[1:26:57] needy person tonight I need your help
[1:27:00] tonight there's a story that's told back
[1:27:04] in the days of Henry Ford that he had a
[1:27:06] great warehouse and and there was a
[1:27:08] boilermaker in this warehouse a great
[1:27:11] boiler rather and and they were having
[1:27:13] some problems with it getting into work
[1:27:15] and so they hired this this famous
[1:27:17] boiler maker to come and work on this
[1:27:20] great boiler in the steam room that they
[1:27:21] had and he comes in and other men have
[1:27:24] tried to work on it they went back and
[1:27:25] they looked at the original diagrams of
[1:27:27] the boiler and they couldn't figure it
[1:27:29] out and so they called for this great
[1:27:30] renowned boiler maker to come in and he
[1:27:33] walks around the thing and he listens to
[1:27:34] it for a little while and he goes over
[1:27:37] to his tool bag and he unzips it and he
[1:27:39] gets out just a little bitty hammer and
[1:27:41] he comes over and he taps on the side of
[1:27:45] the thing and it begins to chug and the
[1:27:47] sputter and to run perfectly normal and
[1:27:51] he goes home and he mails the company a
[1:27:54] bill for $1,000 and they called the man
[1:28:00] they said sir we have a problem with
[1:28:02] this bill they said we know the amount
[1:28:04] of time that you were here and we would
[1:28:06] like you to send us an itemized bill to
[1:28:08] explain to us why this was so expensive
[1:28:11] that you would come in and spend five
[1:28:12] minutes downstairs and send us this bill
[1:28:15] for $1000 and so he sends a Mack a bill
[1:28:18] and he said $50 for the service call
[1:28:22] time and 950 dollars for no and where to
[1:28:25] knock nobody else could do it
[1:28:33] $50 to go and knock on the thing but
[1:28:36] nine hundred and fifty dollars for
[1:28:38] knowing where to not now doctors do
[1:28:41] their best and we're not here to
[1:28:42] belittle doctors I thank God for doctors
[1:28:44] I believe that God heals through doctors
[1:28:46] I believe that God heals through
[1:28:48] medicine he heals through loud the heals
[1:28:50] through music he he heals through touch
[1:28:52] he heals for many
[1:28:53] different things in many different ways
[1:28:54] but it's God that ultimately gets the
[1:28:57] glory for whatever it would be if you go
[1:28:59] down here and you fall and you slip on
[1:29:01] the sidewalk and break your arm you
[1:29:02] don't go to the doctor and say doctor
[1:29:04] can you heal me you say doctor can you
[1:29:06] set my arm and then God comes and does
[1:29:08] the healing yeah if you get the flu and
[1:29:11] you go to you don't go to the doctor say
[1:29:13] doc I've got the flu can you give me
[1:29:14] some medicine to heal me he gives you
[1:29:16] some medicines to try to fight off those
[1:29:18] bad antibodies and things in your body
[1:29:21] and then once that begins to clear up
[1:29:23] it's God that comes and brings in the
[1:29:25] healing they can give you something to
[1:29:27] clean the germs off they can give you
[1:29:29] something to try to fight off whatever
[1:29:30] it is but it takes God to produce the
[1:29:33] healing and so what God does where many
[1:29:37] of us you know no matter how good are
[1:29:39] our motives would be or how good our
[1:29:41] intentions would be we don't know
[1:29:43] sometimes exactly where it is that we
[1:29:45] need to knock we know we know we can
[1:29:48] explain about the human body and the
[1:29:49] doctor can give you this and tell you to
[1:29:51] try that they can try to diagnose but
[1:29:53] sometimes it takes God just to come by
[1:29:55] and knock at your heart and say I
[1:30:00] already healed you I already healed you
[1:30:03] hey man I paid a price that nobody could
[1:30:06] pay I came and I knew right where to
[1:30:08] knock because I was the architect of the
[1:30:10] original thing in the first place I'm
[1:30:13] going to share with you a few
[1:30:14] testimonies tonight to try to build your
[1:30:16] faith and and my we've seen some
[1:30:18] incredible things over the years that
[1:30:19] God has done in this age and but I want
[1:30:21] to just bring it right down to the last
[1:30:23] couple of years some things that we've
[1:30:25] seen God do in our church this isn't the
[1:30:27] give Nathan Bryant Maury this is you
[1:30:28] give Jesus Christ glory we have a
[1:30:31] watch-night service a few years ago and
[1:30:33] there's a young man that he comes to our
[1:30:34] church now and attends regularly and he
[1:30:37] sings specials a lot at our church but
[1:30:39] his name is brother Isaac Webber and he
[1:30:41] was just visiting for I think it was the
[1:30:42] first time he'd ever visited our church
[1:30:44] that night and he'd been in a car wreck
[1:30:46] I believe just a couple days before and
[1:30:48] in the car wreck he had broken his foot
[1:30:50] and he came in on crutches with a big
[1:30:52] cast on our big boot wrapped around his
[1:30:55] foot and he came in on these crutches
[1:30:56] and at the end of this watch night
[1:30:58] service we had a little prayer line and
[1:31:00] he came up for prayer and at the end of
[1:31:02] the service he laid down his crutches
[1:31:03] and he walked out of the building
[1:31:05] perfectly home
[1:31:07] amen amen
[1:31:09] [Applause]
[1:31:13] if there's a man that can do that I want
[1:31:16] you to show him to me it's not something
[1:31:19] a man that can produce I can't do that
[1:31:20] if I could I'd go down to every hospital
[1:31:23] that I could find and there would just
[1:31:24] be people coming out with broken feet
[1:31:26] healed but it wasn't me that did it it
[1:31:28] was Jesus Christ that did it we've got a
[1:31:31] sister we just read the quote Jesus said
[1:31:34] can any man by taking thought add to his
[1:31:36] stature you know could you just think
[1:31:38] real hard and say all night I'm six foot
[1:31:40] four but I'd really like to be six foot
[1:31:41] six and add to your stature we can't do
[1:31:44] it we can't do it but there was a sister
[1:31:47] that comes to our church she's from
[1:31:49] Germany originally but she moved here
[1:31:50] years ago and her and her sons come to
[1:31:52] our church her name is sister burek Huli
[1:31:54] and she for 20 years her leg one of her
[1:31:58] legs had been 2 inches shorter than the
[1:32:00] other and so she wore a lift in her shoe
[1:32:02] for 20 years we sometimes we come up and
[1:32:06] we get prayed for and if it doesn't
[1:32:07] happen like that but sometimes God
[1:32:09] doesn't like that we've seen God do that
[1:32:11] and sometimes it takes a day sometimes
[1:32:13] it takes five days sometimes it takes
[1:32:15] five years for Abraham it took 25 years
[1:32:18] for the promised son to come into view
[1:32:22] but he he looked at those things which
[1:32:24] were not as though they were and they
[1:32:27] can make fun of him and say grandpa
[1:32:28] Abraham the father of many nations
[1:32:30] where's that verse boy it's been you
[1:32:32] know 15 years where's the at he said
[1:32:34] it's more of a miracle now than it was
[1:32:36] 15 years ago they said all my he's crazy
[1:32:39] going down here and buying baby clothes
[1:32:41] at Babies R Us and here he is he's old
[1:32:45] and his wife's old here he is a hundred
[1:32:47] and his life's 90 and they didn't even
[1:32:49] have children back when they were kids
[1:32:50] yeah how is he gonna have a child now he
[1:32:52] said it's more of a miracle now than it
[1:32:55] was 20 years ago twenty four years ago
[1:32:58] by a father of many nations how you
[1:33:00] doing all my the promised sons aren't
[1:33:03] the way anytime now he staggered not at
[1:33:06] the promise of God through unbelief but
[1:33:09] he just kept going so this sister for 20
[1:33:11] years she had struggled with this
[1:33:13] physical situation in her body where one
[1:33:16] leg was two inches shorter than the
[1:33:18] other and she came up at our fourth of
[1:33:19] July meetings
[1:33:20] prayer and and see we've just laid hands
[1:33:23] on her and prayed for just a simple
[1:33:24] prayer and she went back to her seat and
[1:33:26] a couple of weeks later she text
[1:33:28] messaged me said brother Nathan I want
[1:33:29] to share a testimony for 20 years I've
[1:33:32] had this two-inch lift in my shoe and I
[1:33:34] was able to take it out because my legs
[1:33:36] are exactly the same length now amen
[1:33:40] amen we still serve a God of Hebrews 13
[1:33:46] and 8 he's the same yesterday today and
[1:33:49] forever he's not a changeable God he's
[1:33:53] an unchangeable God what he did on the
[1:33:55] shores of Galilee if he's not able to
[1:33:58] perform the same tonight then he got
[1:34:00] weaker somewhere not my god he's still
[1:34:04] able if he could if he could heal the
[1:34:05] blinded eyes back there on the sands of
[1:34:08] Galilee he can do it tonight if he could
[1:34:10] raise the dead back there and when
[1:34:12] Lazarus came forth that had been dead
[1:34:13] for days we saw him do the same thing 16
[1:34:16] years ago in West Palm Beach and the
[1:34:18] man's still alive tonight he's still the
[1:34:21] same God sister sherry virgin a sister
[1:34:25] that goes to our church seat came up for
[1:34:27] prayer about a year ago or maybe two
[1:34:30] years ago now
[1:34:31] she had a.m. she had had some test run
[1:34:34] and her numbers showed that she was in
[1:34:38] the pre leukemia stages that hurt her
[1:34:41] bled her white and blood red cells the
[1:34:43] numbers on him had elevated to a spot to
[1:34:46] where they said she was pretty leukemia
[1:34:47] and needed to start having treatments
[1:34:49] for leukemia and she came up one Sunday
[1:34:51] morning we had prayer for and she went
[1:34:54] back for the follow-up and they said
[1:34:55] your numbers are perfectly normal Amen
[1:35:01] sister Sizemore an elderly lady at our
[1:35:04] church just a couple months of those she
[1:35:06] came up for prayer and she was going to
[1:35:08] have to have surgery on her legs because
[1:35:09] her primary arteries in her legs had
[1:35:12] become so blocked that she couldn't have
[1:35:14] she didn't have any circulation in her
[1:35:15] legs and they were gonna have to do
[1:35:17] surgery and she went in to have the
[1:35:19] surgery and they did some final testing
[1:35:21] on her right before the surgery and they
[1:35:23] found out that after prayer her
[1:35:25] collateral arteries which are normally
[1:35:27] arteries that are closed had opened up
[1:35:30] and those arteries had bypassed
[1:35:33] main arteries in her leg on their own
[1:35:34] and she had perfect circulation amen
[1:35:37] amen
[1:35:41] so God can do bypass surgeries in fact
[1:35:46] God performed the first surgery in
[1:35:48] Genesis chapter 2 there where he took
[1:35:50] from the side of Adam and he created a
[1:35:52] wife and he sealed his side back up he
[1:35:54] didn't have to use stitches he didn't
[1:35:56] have to use pain medicine
[1:35:58] there wasn't any scar he didn't have any
[1:36:00] side effects he would except he got a
[1:36:02] wife I guess that was a side effect but
[1:36:04] that was a real side effect brother Jack
[1:36:10] [Laughter]
[1:36:14] God did that perform the first surgery
[1:36:16] so he's still he's still the great
[1:36:18] physician tonight brother Joel one of my
[1:36:21] deacons brother Joel Hammond basak he
[1:36:23] had worked at a hospital for many years
[1:36:24] and and he had began to feel some pain
[1:36:27] in his leg and he thought he had a blood
[1:36:28] clot and they went for some testing and
[1:36:30] they found out it wasn't a blood clot
[1:36:31] but they diagnosed him with hepatitis B
[1:36:33] and after testing it I've got the
[1:36:35] paperwork if you'd like to see it
[1:36:37] sometime they they said anything greater
[1:36:39] than a 12-point o in this number
[1:36:41] whatever it was for hepatitis B was a
[1:36:43] positive and he his reading was a
[1:36:45] thousand point oh so he was an extreme
[1:36:47] positive and he came up for prayer on a
[1:36:50] Sunday morning and we rebuked that demon
[1:36:52] of hepatitis and prayed for him and he
[1:36:54] went back for the follow-up to see kind
[1:36:56] of how long he'd had it and how fast it
[1:36:58] was progressing and they said mr. Harun
[1:36:59] basak we cannot find any of the
[1:37:01] hepatitis B DNA in your body they said
[1:37:06] not only that but our tests show that
[1:37:08] you're immune to hepatitis V a man when
[1:37:12] God does something he does it right he
[1:37:16] doesn't do something halfway Amen if you
[1:37:20] got that picture of Olivia a harem
[1:37:21] basset show the first of the first
[1:37:23] picture Olivia harem bastard she's about
[1:37:26] my little boy Philips age she's 9 or 10
[1:37:28] years old and and she was they took her
[1:37:32] to the chiropractor and they said that
[1:37:34] she had scoliosis if you can see here
[1:37:37] there's a 54 degree curve on her spine
[1:37:39] and her hip here where it's supposed to
[1:37:41] be straight in line with this vertebrae
[1:37:43] her hip was way off and then there's a
[1:37:45] curving here of this
[1:37:46] in this way and she was two inches
[1:37:48] shorter than they should be and they
[1:37:51] diagnosed her with scoliosis and we had
[1:37:53] prayer for and I've got the recording of
[1:37:55] the prayer still I told the church I
[1:37:57] said the x-ray shows because they just
[1:37:59] had it on a little flip phone at the
[1:38:00] time the picture so I was explaining it
[1:38:02] to the church I said the x-ray shows
[1:38:03] that our backs like this but we're gonna
[1:38:05] pray that it's going to be like that and
[1:38:07] a few months later they went for a
[1:38:09] follow-up and this is the x-ray the
[1:38:12] second one there should be another photo
[1:38:24] technology is a blessing and a curse
[1:38:27] thing amen but you you can imagine what
[1:38:36] its gonna be or I wouldn't be showing
[1:38:37] the picture Lot's wife she's pulling
[1:38:44] that up I'll go a little bit further
[1:38:45] this the same little girl her sister had
[1:38:48] had a deficiency
[1:38:51] she had an iron deficiency where her
[1:38:53] numbers were extremely low and they were
[1:38:55] gonna have to put her on supplements and
[1:38:57] things for her iron and we had prayer
[1:38:59] for her and she went back to the doctor
[1:39:01] and her numbers every follow-up visit
[1:39:02] since her iron numbers have been
[1:39:04] perfectly normal
[1:39:05] amen god knows what he's doing there
[1:39:10] should be a third one but it's okay if
[1:39:12] there's no I can show it later on this
[1:39:13] if anybody wants to see it there should
[1:39:16] be a third picture I may have it on here
[1:39:19] I can pull it up no I don't have that
[1:39:26] one on here well let's go ahead his
[1:39:28] sister Tanya for now and maybe she can
[1:39:29] pull that one up later her sister Tanya
[1:39:31] November 2016 we were here preaching and
[1:39:34] she came up for prayer and her shoulder
[1:39:36] she had arthritis and bursitis of the
[1:39:38] shoulder and she had bone fragments in
[1:39:40] the shoulder and she couldn't move her
[1:39:42] arm about any higher than this and
[1:39:44] couldn't move it back it would cause her
[1:39:46] extreme pain and she came up for prayer
[1:39:47] and that night she went home and began
[1:39:49] to iron their clothes for Sunday and
[1:39:51] when she did she was a recognized you
[1:39:53] know I could move the iron back a little
[1:39:54] further than I could
[1:39:55] and she'd begin to take her arm and move
[1:39:57] it like that and she was able to move it
[1:39:59] can you still move it like that sister
[1:40:00] Tanya
[1:40:01] praise the Lord amen God's good she came
[1:40:10] for the Labor Day meetings and she was
[1:40:12] supposed to have some treatments they
[1:40:15] had diagnosed her with cancer she had a
[1:40:16] cancer on the top of her head we we have
[1:40:19] these things back home they're called
[1:40:21] Buckeyes that it was about the size of a
[1:40:23] Buckeye on top of her head right now a
[1:40:25] hairline there and and they had said it
[1:40:28] was cancerous and they wanted to start
[1:40:29] doing treatments and so she came she
[1:40:31] said let's move it back a week I've got
[1:40:33] some meetings I'm wanting to go to and
[1:40:35] so she pushed the appointment back a
[1:40:36] week and she came for prayer
[1:40:38] and she came up at the end of the Sunday
[1:40:40] night service and we had prayer with her
[1:40:41] and so the sisters of the picture sister
[1:40:44] Tanya before and after this was about 24
[1:40:46] hours after that the after prayer this
[1:40:50] is the before and that's the after a man
[1:40:59] God is good god is good he's still the
[1:41:03] healer she went back to the doctor and
[1:41:05] they they said we think still think you
[1:41:07] should have some treatments and she said
[1:41:08] what can you do a PET scan they said it
[1:41:10] it doesn't even show up on a PET scan
[1:41:11] that there's any cancer I said God
[1:41:14] doesn't do something 99% he does it all
[1:41:16] the way a man he does it all the way the
[1:41:22] picture of little Libya if they can't
[1:41:24] get it it's her the spine is perfectly
[1:41:26] straight now as far as the 54 degree
[1:41:28] curve her hip is in line now the
[1:41:30] sideways curb that you saw there in the
[1:41:31] first picture there was still a little
[1:41:33] bit of a curve there but her
[1:41:34] chiropractor said that the just basic
[1:41:36] treatments through him will correct that
[1:41:38] and he said he gives a hundred percent
[1:41:40] chance of a hundred percent recovery a
[1:41:42] man a man there's that there's the
[1:41:48] corrected x-ray there her back work was
[1:41:50] curved as straight her hip is straight
[1:41:52] and there's just a gradual curve that
[1:41:53] way but he said just his treatments will
[1:41:55] correct that God's good God's good
[1:42:02] before we go into the prayer line
[1:42:04] tonight I just want to read you a few
[1:42:05] things to boost your faith we've shared
[1:42:07] some testimonies that we've shared how
[1:42:09] that God is the architect of our bodies
[1:42:11] but I want to read you a few things that
[1:42:13] his word says because we have to have a
[1:42:16] foundation somewhere to place our faith
[1:42:18] and we believe that the Word of God it's
[1:42:22] infallible when he speaks something it
[1:42:24] has to be and when he speaks something
[1:42:26] he's not a respecter of person if he
[1:42:28] heals one person and this another person
[1:42:30] approaches him on the same word with the
[1:42:33] same amount of faith if he doesn't heal
[1:42:35] the other person then he's unjust but
[1:42:38] the problem is many times it's just we
[1:42:40] don't approach him with the same faith
[1:42:41] that somebody else had approached him
[1:42:43] with Isaiah chapter 53 verse 5 says but
[1:42:46] he was wounded for our transgressions he
[1:42:49] was bruised for our iniquities
[1:42:51] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:42:53] him and with His stripes we are healed
[1:42:56] not we might be not we hope to be not we
[1:42:59] should be we are healed third John
[1:43:03] chapter one verse two says beloved I
[1:43:05] wish above all things that thou mayest
[1:43:06] prosper and be in health even as thy
[1:43:09] soul prospereth so that's what brother
[1:43:11] Jack was talking about earlier you don't
[1:43:13] have to be a Christian to get healed but
[1:43:15] you have to be a Christian to get set it
[1:43:17] is to stay healed to stay healed he told
[1:43:19] the woman he didn't say you know God
[1:43:21] just loves you and you go off and do
[1:43:23] your sin he said go your way and sin no
[1:43:25] more
[1:43:25] amen mark chapter 16 verse 17 says these
[1:43:28] signs shall not a hope so now - maybe
[1:43:31] these signs shall follow them that
[1:43:33] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:43:36] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:43:39] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:43:41] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:43:43] them they shall lay their hands on the
[1:43:46] sick and they shall recover hey man when
[1:43:49] somebody comes up for prayer anymore
[1:43:51] we've seen God do so much I don't wonder
[1:43:53] can't he do it I just expect a miracle a
[1:43:55] man I expect a testimony because he said
[1:43:58] they shall lay their hands on the sick
[1:43:59] and they shall recover that's a promise
[1:44:02] amen either that's the truth or it's not
[1:44:04] the truth but we've seen it confirmed
[1:44:06] too many times we know that it's the
[1:44:08] truth Amen if we can approach it on the
[1:44:11] basis of faith that God I believe your
[1:44:13] word is true and I believe that it's
[1:44:15] already a finished work at Calvary
[1:44:17] brother Nathan doesn't have to heal me
[1:44:18] brother Jack doesn't have to heal me in
[1:44:20] fact they cannot even if Jesus Christ
[1:44:22] was here in a physical body himself he
[1:44:24] couldn't heal you it's something that he
[1:44:26] already did he doesn't have to come and

[1:44:49] amen he already healed us he's already
[1:44:53] saved us you just have to accept what he
[1:44:55] did for you
[1:44:56] Saint John chapter 14 verse 12 verily
[1:44:59] verily I say to you he that believeth on
[1:45:01] me the works that I do shall he do also
[1:45:04] and greater works than these shall he do
[1:45:08] because I go unto my father and
[1:45:10] whatsoever you shall ask in my name that
[1:45:12] will I do not I might do not I'll think
[1:45:16] about it I will do that the father may
[1:45:18] be glorified in the son if you shall ask
[1:45:20] anything in my name I will do it now all
[1:45:24] these is on the basis of faith hey maybe
[1:45:26] you can get up here and just quote
[1:45:28] scripture but if you don't have faith it
[1:45:29] won't do you any good no matter how
[1:45:31] annoying that I am or how much God would
[1:45:33] give me a gift to pray for the sick or
[1:45:34] whatever it would be if you don't have
[1:45:35] the faith to receive it what good is it
[1:45:37] going to do you Amen Jesus he went into
[1:45:41] the city of Galilee in the earth into
[1:45:43] the region of Galilee into the city of
[1:45:45] Nazareth that he was from and it said
[1:45:47] the Bible says you go check your Bible
[1:45:49] and see if it doesn't say this he did
[1:45:51] not many mighty works there because of
[1:45:54] their unbelief wasn't that he didn't
[1:45:57] have the power wasn't that he didn't
[1:45:59] have the faith but they didn't believe
[1:46:00] it how is he going to help somebody that
[1:46:02] didn't believe it in the first place
[1:46:04] Matthew chapter 18 verse 18 verily I say
[1:46:07] to you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth
[1:46:09] shall be bound in heaven whatsoever you
[1:46:12] shall loose on earth shall be loosed in
[1:46:14] heaven again I say to you that if two of
[1:46:16] you shall agree on earth as touching
[1:46:18] anything that they shall ask it shall be
[1:46:22] done unto them he goes on to say of my
[1:46:25] father which is in heaven for where two
[1:46:27] or three are gathered in my name there I
[1:46:29] am in the midst of them doesn't have to
[1:46:32] be a big crowd doesn't have to be great
[1:46:34] large amount of numbers wherever there's
[1:46:36] two or three in his name he's in the
[1:46:39] midst that means that he promised he'd
[1:46:42] be here tonight that means that he
[1:46:44] promised that if we would show up in his
[1:46:46] name that he would show up mark chapter
[1:46:49] 11 verse 22 Jesus answering said unto
[1:46:52] them have faith in God for verily I say
[1:46:54] unto you that whatsoever shall say unto
[1:46:57] this mountain be thou removed and be
[1:46:59] thou cast into the sea and shall not
[1:47:02] doubt in his heart but shall believe
[1:47:03] that those things which he saith shall
[1:47:05] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[1:47:08] saith he's not just talking about
[1:47:10] physical
[1:47:10] go healing he's not just talking about
[1:47:12] salvation he's talking about whatever
[1:47:14] mountain is in your way maybe it's a
[1:47:17] mountain of you know a spouse that's not
[1:47:20] a believing spouse maybe it's a mountain
[1:47:22] of the backslidden child maybe it's a
[1:47:24] mountain of a job that you got fired
[1:47:27] from maybe it's a mountain of
[1:47:28] unemployment whatever the mountain is if
[1:47:30] you say to this mountain be moved and be
[1:47:34] cast into the sea and it might not
[1:47:36] happen today might not happen tomorrow
[1:47:38] but as soon as you say it and believe
[1:47:40] God's Word some of that mountain begins
[1:47:43] to fall off of the back of it might just
[1:47:45] be a teaspoonful might be a five-gallon
[1:47:47] bucket full but the mountain begins to
[1:47:49] move right then therefore I say to you
[1:47:55] what things soever you desire when you
[1:47:56] pray believe that you receive them and
[1:47:58] you shall have them but the Brent says
[1:48:01] this and Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:48:03] today and forever 1958 the Word of God
[1:48:06] will defeat the devil anywhere any time
[1:48:10] or any place he will defeat the devil
[1:48:12] that's how Jesus defeated him when he
[1:48:14] was here on earth when Satan came to him
[1:48:16] and began to tempt him he said it is
[1:48:18] written it is written he could have
[1:48:20] spoke the devil out of existence with
[1:48:21] his power he could have spoken to a
[1:48:23] saint you know until I'm gone from the
[1:48:25] earth in a physical body I'm gonna
[1:48:27] confine you to Mars and just leave me
[1:48:29] alone stop driving me crazy but he
[1:48:31] didn't do it because he wanted you to
[1:48:33] know that the same way that he fought
[1:48:34] the devil you can fight the devil the
[1:48:37] same word that he used you can use it'll
[1:48:42] defeat the devil anywhere any time or
[1:48:44] any place he will defeat the devil and
[1:48:45] the right mental attitude towards any
[1:48:47] divine promise of God will bring it to
[1:48:50] pass
[1:48:50] if you can look at it the way God wrote
[1:48:52] it and accepted in your heart God will
[1:48:55] make that word become life st. Paul says
[1:48:58] in Hebrews chapter 3 verse 1 that he's
[1:49:00] the high priest of our profession Jesus
[1:49:04] Christ is the high priest of our
[1:49:06] profession that word profession if you
[1:49:08] look it up in the Greek lexicon it's the
[1:49:10] same word it's interchangeable with
[1:49:12] confession that whatever you confess
[1:49:14] with your mouth brother Branham says and
[1:49:16] show us the father 1959 God will make
[1:49:19] your body obey your confession you go
[1:49:22] out of here and say all mine
[1:49:24] worse than I ever have you better be
[1:49:26] careful God will make your body obey
[1:49:27] your confession you say oh my I just
[1:49:29] don't think I'm going to make it brother
[1:49:31] Troy I just I just don't know if I can
[1:49:33] keep serving god there's so many
[1:49:34] temptations out of here you better watch
[1:49:35] what you confess with your mouth but you
[1:49:37] go out of here and you begin to confess
[1:49:39] I'm healed oh I may still have symptoms
[1:49:41] but they're just lying Vanity's I may
[1:49:44] still have aches and pains but it's just
[1:49:46] a lie of the devil I'm healed I'm
[1:49:49] healing it's already a finished work at
[1:49:51] Calvary God will make your body obey
[1:49:53] your confession oh my see and he's the
[1:49:57] high priest of our confession before you
[1:49:59] can be healed you have to confess it
[1:50:01] first you have to believe that you're
[1:50:03] healed and then when you believe you're
[1:50:06] healed God makes your body obey your
[1:50:08] testimony your confession rather he says
[1:50:10] again who is God 19:50 your testimony
[1:50:12] will bring you right into it going Jesus
[1:50:17] 1963 he says now right out in front of
[1:50:20] you stands a person just like he was a
[1:50:23] few minutes ago you were sit down here
[1:50:25] but there is a well person standing
[1:50:27] there in other words he's saying as you
[1:50:29] come into the prayer line you're here in
[1:50:31] a sick body but visualized at the other
[1:50:34] end of the platform
[1:50:35] that there's a well body standing there
[1:50:37] there's a sick you here at this side but
[1:50:39] there's a well you standing on that side
[1:50:42] stands the person just like he was a few
[1:50:44] minutes ago you were sick down here but
[1:50:46] there is a well person standing there
[1:50:48] Jesus Christ is calling to that well
[1:50:51] person right beyond it now you just by
[1:50:53] faith as you close your eyes walk right
[1:50:56] into that well body see then just keep
[1:50:59] on walking just keep on going Saint Paul
[1:51:05] teaches us in Acts chapter 19 verse 11
[1:51:08] to 12 it says they took from the body of
[1:51:10] Paul because so many miracles were being
[1:51:12] wrought by him when he was laying hands
[1:51:14] on people and things they took from the
[1:51:15] body of Paul handkerchiefs and aprons
[1:51:18] and laid them on the sick and when they
[1:51:22] would take these prayer cloths and
[1:51:23] things from the body of st. Paul and lay
[1:51:25] them on the city it said that diseases
[1:51:27] departed them and evil spirits went out
[1:51:30] of them James chapter 5 verse 14 says is
[1:51:33] any sick among you let him call for the
[1:51:35] elders of the church and let them pray
[1:51:37] for him anointing him with oil in the
[1:51:39] name of the Lord and the prayer of faith
[1:51:41] shall save the sick and the Lord shall
[1:51:45] raised him up and if he have committed
[1:51:47] these sins they shall be forgiven him so
[1:51:51] when you healed you're forgiven too but
[1:51:53] you can't go back out and do all the
[1:51:54] same sins that you used to do leave it
[1:51:56] right here leave it right here and walk
[1:51:59] on don't sin no more but give God the
[1:52:01] glory say I'm not only healed
[1:52:03] I'm delivered I used to be bound by a
[1:52:04] nicotine demon I'm delivered of it I
[1:52:06] used to be bound by alcohol demon
[1:52:08] whatever it is drug demon lust demon
[1:52:11] whatever it is I'm free tonight I mean
[1:52:14] not only healed
[1:52:15] I'm delivered oh my that's why we
[1:52:19] believe in anointing with all and
[1:52:20] praying for the sick and laying hands on
[1:52:23] I'm anointing with all these things it's
[1:52:25] a commandment in the Word of God to do
[1:52:27] these things with the promise that the
[1:52:28] sick will be healed now it's not that
[1:52:31] there's any it's not that there's any
[1:52:33] healing quality in this oil if there was
[1:52:36] we'd get a whole bath tub and just
[1:52:37] baptize people in it it's not that
[1:52:40] there's any healing quality in my hands
[1:52:42] if we was let's go down to the hospitals
[1:52:44] and I'll just lay my hands on everybody
[1:52:45] it's not that there's even healing power
[1:52:47] in the prayer cloths that have been
[1:52:49] prayed over about 90 minute God it's not
[1:52:51] that there's healing power in the little
[1:52:53] piece of cloth if there was let's let's
[1:52:55] go down to the you know the the diseased
[1:52:57] in the sick written let's just lay that
[1:52:59] on them but it's obedience to God's Word
[1:53:02] that brings it to pass it's not my hands
[1:53:05] it's not the cloth it's not the oil it's
[1:53:07] not the prayer the words that I would
[1:53:08] say over you it's that we're obeying
[1:53:10] God's Word he said if you do this this
[1:53:13] is what's going to happen if you pray if
[1:53:16] you lay hands on them and oil with oil
[1:53:17] all these things if you do these things
[1:53:19] this is the result they shall be healed
[1:53:22] so we come in obedience to his word said
[1:53:24] God this is what you said and we're
[1:53:26] doing what you said now you come and
[1:53:28] back up your word if you can approach
[1:53:30] him with faith tonight let me tell you
[1:53:32] he will back up his word we've shared
[1:53:35] the testimonies of it we've seen it over
[1:53:37] and over again some chapter 103 verse 1
[1:53:40] says bless the Lord O my soul and all
[1:53:42] that is within me bless His Holy Name
