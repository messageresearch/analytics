[38:35] consider it a privilege that you've
[38:36] bestowed upon us
[38:38] that we could be here this morning to
[38:40] just worship your
[38:41] holy name but we know to god there's no
[38:44] name under heaven whereby we can be
[38:46] saved but by the name of jesus christ
[38:48] the lord we're just so grateful for this
[38:51] opportunity that we could come and just
[38:53] worship your holy name may you come and
[38:55] speak to us
[38:56] may you come and meet every need exceed
[38:58] every expectation
[39:00] you know the burden behind every handed
[39:03] and i pray to the lord that you're just
[39:04] moving a mighty way
[39:06] may you come and anoint this place to
[39:08] learn may your holy spirit just saturate
[39:10] this entire place
[39:11] may touch every individual soul that's
[39:13] here this morning
[39:15] and father i pray as they lay the
[39:17] burdens upon your
[39:18] the altar father there's not one need to
[39:21] god that's
[39:21] thought of there's not one need that's
[39:23] spoken and whispered in a prayer that
[39:25] you didn't know before the foundation of
[39:27] the world
[39:28] and father we know that you'll make up
[39:30] for uh you'll make a way for us
[39:33] may you bless us now as we turn back the
[39:35] pages of the bible and as we
[39:37] look into your scripture and father i
[39:39] pray
[39:40] dear lord that your holy spirit just
[39:42] come and open up the word to us
[39:45] have your perfect will in this morning
[39:47] service and the bride says
[39:50] amen amen god bless you saints that's
[39:52] all the thing that i'll be doing god
[39:54] bless you certainly good to be
[39:56] in the house of the lord just bring your
[39:57] greetings to my family
[39:59] um i would have loved to bring them down
[40:01] here but given the circumstances and
[40:03] everything else so
[40:04] um we're kind of going back and forth
[40:06] and ultimately i made the decision that
[40:08] you know i'll just come down early this
[40:09] morning and
[40:10] be part of the services and um but they
[40:13] bring you their greetings and
[40:14] the lord's just been really good to my
[40:16] family and i you know i was telling
[40:18] brother
[40:18] jack you know the scripture in isaiah
[40:22] where the bible says you know they that
[40:23] wait upon the lord
[40:25] shall renew their strength and you know
[40:27] i look at my little blessings that the
[40:29] lord has given unto me
[40:31] um and my wife um little naomi and caleb
[40:34] you know there's just a renewed strength
[40:35] that comes when you've been patiently
[40:37] praying
[40:38] and just seeking god and finally you
[40:40] know you stand in a position where
[40:42] that prayer has been answered there's a
[40:44] renewed strength
[40:46] and um and i was telling brother jack i
[40:48] said you know to you know
[40:50] for someone else who read that very same
[40:52] scripture
[40:53] it's just another verse and that's fine
[40:55] but for me
[40:56] it's much more than a verse it becomes a
[41:00] revelation
[41:01] when that verse becomes realizing you
[41:03] know and i started to apply that in
[41:05] other parts of the scripture where
[41:07] you'll find where you know for me a
[41:09] verse might just be a verse in
[41:11] in and i appreciate that verse but for
[41:13] you that experience that you're going
[41:15] through that verse would become
[41:16] something completely different
[41:18] and so and that's the reason why the
[41:20] prophecy says we can look at this book
[41:21] and it becomes a new book to us
[41:23] for everyone else they could kind of
[41:24] tuck it under their arms and say i got
[41:26] the bible
[41:27] for us it's much more than that my
[41:29] salvation is rested upon this word
[41:31] my ticket to heaven is rested upon this
[41:34] word
[41:34] so um so i'm just grateful to the
[41:36] blessings of god and i'm also humbled
[41:38] because you know i was telling brother
[41:40] jack you know you go so many years it's
[41:42] one thing if you pray for something and
[41:44] the next day you get it
[41:45] you know how much of an appreciation
[41:47] what you have for it
[41:48] and but when when you wait when you
[41:50] waited a little while
[41:52] and you've been patient a little while
[41:54] and you've been you've been you've been
[41:55] fervent a little while and you've been
[41:57] pursuing a little while and then finally
[41:59] the
[42:00] the the the prayer has been answered
[42:02] your action and your behavior is far
[42:05] different you become that much more
[42:07] appreciative
[42:08] you become that much more delicate you
[42:10] now know it's like the lord answered
[42:11] my prayers it becomes personal to me
[42:15] so so i'm just i'm just very
[42:18] very excited and i go back to that
[42:21] scripture isaiah
[42:22] where the bible says they that wait upon
[42:23] the lord shall renew their strength
[42:25] so there's a boost of energy there's a
[42:28] there's there's a strength that's
[42:29] renewed
[42:30] and and and and no one can tell me
[42:33] different
[42:33] all right you know it may not mean much
[42:36] to them but that scripture means
[42:37] everything to me
[42:39] so i just thank god for for his word so
[42:42] we bring
[42:43] your greetings we just bring you love
[42:45] and we're just so excited amen
[42:47] amen what the time we've been living in
[42:51] amen if you wouldn't mind just stand
[42:54] with me and
[42:55] turn with me to isaiah i mean
[42:59] psalm 119. it's funny because um
[43:04] at my church i was telling them you know
[43:06] when we were when we got a chance to
[43:07] kind of assemble and we all had our face
[43:09] mask on and
[43:10] i told them we all look like ninjas in
[43:12] church you know
[43:16] amen
[43:19] praise the lord psalms 119 say amen if
[43:22] you're there
[43:24] verse 105.
[43:34] but jack i'm okay to grab this water
[43:36] right here right okay
[43:38] psalm 119 105.
[43:41] we'll have a couple of opening
[43:42] scriptures so psalm 119
[43:44] verse 105 it reads thy
[43:47] word it is a lamp unto my feet
[43:51] and a light unto my path
[43:54] verse 130 of the same chapter
[43:59] the entrance of thy words giveth light
[44:03] it gives understanding unto the simple
[44:07] the first part of verse 133
[44:10] order my steps in thy word
[44:15] amen may the lord have his blessings to
[44:17] the reading of the word you may be
[44:18] seated
[44:21] as a as a point of as a point of
[44:24] reference
[44:25] um the bible says in john 16 how be it
[44:29] when he the spirit of truth is come
[44:32] he will guide you into all truth
[44:36] and he will show you things to come
[44:39] so this scripture has been a source of
[44:42] inspiration to me
[44:44] because i realized the importance of the
[44:47] revelation of god's word
[44:50] and we just read what the bible says
[44:52] god's word
[44:53] is a lamp unto my feet and it's a
[44:57] light unto my path so which means to
[45:01] tell me that we're living
[45:02] in a dark time and the only way that we
[45:06] could have a sense of direction
[45:08] is that our path has to be illuminated
[45:12] and the only way that our path could be
[45:14] illuminated is that the word
[45:17] has to shed light upon the direction
[45:19] where we're going
[45:21] and so if we don't have light if we
[45:24] don't have a sense of where we're going
[45:26] then we could stumble anywhere we we
[45:29] could stumble
[45:30] we could fall we could trip we could
[45:32] fall into danger
[45:34] but i'm encouraged because the bible
[45:36] says thy word is a lamp unto my feet and
[45:39] a light
[45:40] unto my path so our path is guided by
[45:44] god
[45:46] so we're living in a very dark time and
[45:48] the only way that we know where we're
[45:50] going is that our path has to be
[45:52] illuminated
[45:54] so we realize that we can't take this
[45:56] path by ourselves
[45:58] we can't walk this walk by ourselves so
[46:01] we need
[46:02] some sort of leadership all right we
[46:05] need
[46:05] someone to hold our hand and navigate us
[46:08] through these dark
[46:09] turmoil times and it's only gonna get
[46:12] darker but the light's going to get
[46:15] brighter
[46:16] [Music]
[46:17] i'm i'm trying to tell you this this is
[46:19] a time where there is going to be a
[46:21] difference
[46:22] and that difference is going to be
[46:24] noticeable and i'm okay
[46:26] being different because i am from a
[46:29] different breed
[46:30] i am from a different group i'm from a
[46:33] different tree
[46:35] i am from the tree of life
[46:38] and so there is that differentiation
[46:41] time
[46:42] and as it becomes darker the light
[46:44] becomes brighter
[46:46] so there's no more places to hide
[46:49] there's no more places to blend in
[46:53] and i'm okay looking different in the
[46:55] world i'm okay
[46:56] acting different in the world i'm okay
[46:59] talking different in the world
[47:01] i'm okay being different because god
[47:03] made me for who i
[47:05] am i'm a reflection of who he is
[47:08] and i'm not ashamed of that
[47:11] [Music]
[47:11] [Applause]
[47:13] [Music]
[47:15] the world is completely in chaos
[47:20] but god is a god of order i'm not in
[47:23] chaos
[47:26] the bible says order my steps in your
[47:29] word
[47:30] as long as i know where i am in god's
[47:32] word
[47:33] then i know that my footsteps are
[47:35] ordered of god the world is in confusion
[47:40] i am not in confusion
[47:43] the world doesn't know what to do i am
[47:46] trusting in the word of god
[47:48] that's been proven
[47:52] let me tell you saints this is not the
[47:53] first pandemic
[47:55] that god has gone through
[47:59] amen this is not the first pestilence
[48:06] praise god the same god that brought the
[48:10] saints in the past through whatever the
[48:12] world went through
[48:13] it's the same god that i am worshiping
[48:18] today
[48:20] [Applause]
[48:24] we live in a dark world that's void of
[48:27] god
[48:30] violence in every corner
[48:34] natural disasters that's taking place
[48:39] pestilence this is not an epidemic this
[48:42] is a pandemic
[48:45] before things were concentrated to a
[48:47] region or
[48:48] a location the world is beginning to
[48:50] feel the impact
[48:51] because the world has fallen away from
[48:54] god
[48:58] violence natural disasters
[49:02] pestilence wars the rumors of wars
[49:05] are you familiar with that scripture the
[49:08] bible says look up
[49:10] your redemption draw is nigh we're the
[49:13] only people
[49:14] that in the middle of sorrows that we
[49:17] can have a jubilee
[49:21] we're the only people that can walk
[49:23] around with smiles on our faces
[49:26] [Applause]
[49:26] [Music]
[49:29] people don't know what's going on
[49:30] they're trying to look for an answer
[49:31] they're running here and they're running
[49:32] there
[49:34] god is my answer amen
[49:37] when we see these things begin to unfold
[49:41] the bible says look up your redemption
[49:45] draweth nigh
[49:48] that scripture is becoming more and more
[49:51] of a reality
[49:56] our ability to get through this world
[50:00] is only by god's words alone
[50:03] amen amen
[50:07] no words of man can carry you through
[50:11] the trials
[50:14] this is a little bit of this is a little
[50:17] bit of that squeeze
[50:19] that we've been preaching about right
[50:22] yes sir
[50:24] yes sir this is a little bit of that now
[50:27] don't get all comfortable with your
[50:28] on your chairs but we're gonna get we're
[50:30] gonna go some places
[50:32] now i know for at least for us we hadn't
[50:35] had church in
[50:36] a little bit
[50:39] and the prophet did preach that one of
[50:41] these days
[50:42] the church doors will be closed
[50:47] so being able to assemble here
[50:50] right we always took that for granted we
[50:53] say yeah we believe the church store's
[50:55] gonna be closed
[50:56] but we always came to church that sunday
[50:59] we'll stay in the church that tuesday
[51:01] that wednesday whenever the church
[51:02] source was open
[51:03] we came to church and now we entered a
[51:06] predicament for a little bit
[51:08] where the church doors were closed
[51:11] and the pastor was not around the
[51:14] deacons was not around
[51:16] so people don't see you acting a
[51:20] christian
[51:24] in the days that you couldn't be in
[51:26] services
[51:28] how did you keep yourself edified in
[51:30] god's word
[51:32] how did you keep yourself enthusiastic
[51:34] about god's words
[51:36] how did you keep yourself motivated
[51:38] about god's words
[51:41] because there's no one now telling you
[51:43] to build a family altar
[51:46] there's no one telling you to read the
[51:48] bible
[51:54] i don't know about y'all but it was it
[51:56] was a really
[51:57] challenging time for me and my family
[51:59] all right
[52:01] because we had to constantly find
[52:03] ourselves
[52:04] i as the head of the house i had to
[52:06] constantly find myself
[52:07] how do i engage my family
[52:11] and reading the scripture daily
[52:16] singing songs daily creating the
[52:20] atmosphere
[52:21] constantly the only atmosphere that some
[52:24] people some of us know is only when we
[52:26] get to church and it shouldn't
[52:27] be that way because we leave it to the
[52:31] soul leader to create an atmosphere
[52:34] the man i'm so happy to praise god all
[52:37] right
[52:38] and then we bring and then we leave it
[52:39] to the minister to come and just preach
[52:41] us happy
[52:43] and we leave that atmosphere here
[52:49] but when the tables have been turning
[52:51] you don't have the luxury to sit in this
[52:53] place like
[52:54] like we are today and now you got to
[52:56] take it home
[52:58] you got to make your home a sanctuary
[53:02] hallelujah and when you begin to look at
[53:05] the state of your home they're staring
[53:07] things
[53:08] that don't belong in the home so
[53:10] therefore it becomes difficult to make
[53:12] your home a sanctuary
[53:18] so you got to start removing certain
[53:20] things so that way the holy spirit can
[53:22] feel very
[53:23] comfortable in your home
[53:26] i said lord you can have access to every
[53:29] room in my house
[53:30] amen y'all could say amen amen
[53:34] lord you can have access to every closet
[53:36] in my house
[53:38] and lord i don't want you to feel like
[53:40] you're a guest here's the keys to my
[53:42] house
[53:47] so this has been a little bit of a test
[53:50] on how we come together in the absence
[53:54] of one another
[53:55] fellowshipping because we thrive off of
[53:57] fellowship
[53:58] right when i see another brother that's
[54:00] our brother jack duff i haven't seen him
[54:01] in a while
[54:02] my spirit just lifted i was so excited
[54:04] we
[54:05] thrive off of fellowship we strive off
[54:07] of communion
[54:08] but when you got to take a stance by
[54:10] yourself and you're
[54:12] got to take a stance with your family
[54:14] every sermon that was preached on this
[54:16] service behind this pulpit
[54:18] is now for you to put into practice
[54:26] because it's easy in the company of
[54:28] others to say amen
[54:29] preach your brother but when you're by
[54:31] yourself
[54:33] and you have to create the same
[54:34] atmosphere and all you got is just the
[54:36] scripture that's laying before
[54:38] you you got to be able to read that
[54:39] scripture and not hear my voice
[54:41] but hear god's voice and still say lord
[54:44] i believe this word to be
[54:49] true amen
[54:52] so that way when we come back we come
[54:55] back with our little licks of fire
[54:57] already on
[54:59] we're already enthusiastic we're already
[55:03] edified to continue that spirit of
[55:06] worship
[55:10] because in the stage of loneliness
[55:11] people kind of resort back to their old
[55:14] ways
[55:16] they become discouraged
[55:20] so david himself reached a point in his
[55:23] life
[55:25] well he felt by himself
[55:29] and he had to encourage himself that's
[55:32] it
[55:33] sir and the lord
[55:36] i encourage myself and the lord
[55:39] right amen i appreciate your prayers i
[55:42] appreciate the god bless you
[55:44] i appreciate you know move on brother i
[55:46] appreciate these things
[55:47] but when i've got to stand by myself and
[55:49] there's no one around me i'm going to
[55:50] encourage myself
[55:53] in god's words
[55:56] can we say praise the lord
[56:00] so only he can light the path
[56:03] he gives you clarity of direction
[56:07] it's interesting because we have more
[56:09] knowledge today
[56:10] but we have more ignorance we have more
[56:14] technology
[56:15] but more deaths we have a lot more goods
[56:18] and products that sold
[56:20] but a lot more people die of hunger and
[56:22] thirst
[56:24] what a world we live in
[56:27] you know it kind of goes back to where
[56:29] the bible says that the earth
[56:31] was without form and void
[56:35] and that's in genesis chapter one the
[56:38] bible says in the beginning god created
[56:40] the heavens and the earth and the earth
[56:42] was without form and void
[56:47] and darkness was upon the face
[56:51] of the deep and the spirit of god
[56:55] moved upon the face of the waters
[56:59] all right so that's a lot to unpack so
[57:02] let me let me help out with this
[57:05] the earth was without form
[57:08] so something occurred where at one time
[57:12] perhaps the earth was in the presence of
[57:14] the s-u-n
[57:15] but it moved away from that presence
[57:19] and the earth was without form
[57:23] and the bible says it was void
[57:26] and darkness a a shroud of darkness
[57:31] covered this earth but there were seeds
[57:36] that were laying inside of the earth
[57:42] and so god could have looked down at
[57:43] that earth and says i'm going to start
[57:45] all over again
[57:48] but out of a dead situation because the
[57:50] earth
[57:51] was not moving the earth was without
[57:54] form let me bring this home to you i was
[57:58] a
[57:58] i was that earth i
[58:01] was without form of godliness i was
[58:04] void of dark i was void of god and
[58:08] darkness was upon this flesh
[58:12] amen i was born with the spirit
[58:15] let me tell you back in my day you
[58:16] wouldn't want to spend time with
[58:18] gene that brother gene gene
[58:21] because at that time i didn't view you
[58:23] as a brother and i didn't view you as a
[58:25] sister
[58:26] but within that same verse the bible
[58:29] says that the spirit of god
[58:30] moved in the midst of something that was
[58:34] dead god was alive
[58:37] moving action
[58:41] took place god moved
[58:44] upon his creation god didn't just cast
[58:47] you away
[58:48] he worked with that same creation
[58:54] so this earth that was without form
[58:57] didn't have any form of godliness
[58:59] whatsoever
[59:01] wouldn't even step his foot into church
[59:04] wouldn't even open a bible but there was
[59:08] this undeniable seed on the inside
[59:12] that could that could not deny the
[59:14] likeliness of the father
[59:18] and in that same scripture the bible
[59:20] says end
[59:21] she says by the way it's not all over
[59:24] yet
[59:25] it's not finished yet and the spirit of
[59:28] god
[59:30] moved
[59:33] upon the face of the waters
[59:38] so this earth that was probably out in
[59:40] this
[59:41] realm of darkness and just cold and
[59:45] and shallow and this shroud of darkness
[59:49] covered it and god
[59:52] said let there be
[59:55] light one of my favorite scriptures
[59:58] let there be light
[1:00:03] i wish my voice was deep enough just to
[1:00:04] kind of let that kind of come across
[1:00:07] let there be light let me say god was
[1:00:10] not
[1:00:10] asking for permission
[1:00:15] god didn't go to some angels and thomas
[1:00:17] they said what do you think about this
[1:00:20] god looked at his creation who was a
[1:00:23] part of him
[1:00:24] and he saw through the dark veil a seed
[1:00:27] that's a reflection
[1:00:28] of himself and god stepped on the scene
[1:00:30] and said
[1:00:31] let there be light yes
[1:00:33] [Music]
[1:00:39] god looked down at you
[1:00:42] when you were drinking your beer smoking
[1:00:45] your cigarettes
[1:00:47] running with the wrong crowd having a
[1:00:50] fine
[1:00:50] mouth and god said let there be light
[1:00:58] there was not a devil that could step
[1:01:01] forward
[1:01:01] and prevent that word from coming to
[1:01:08] pass
[1:01:19] god looked down at you
[1:01:22] when you were just soaking in your beers
[1:01:26] running wild with your friends thinking
[1:01:29] you had your whole future planned ahead
[1:01:30] of you
[1:01:31] and god said let there be light before
[1:01:34] you even thought about him
[1:01:36] he was thinking about you
[1:01:44] in the darkness that overshadowed the
[1:01:47] seed on the inside
[1:01:49] that others could not see others could
[1:01:51] not see because all this all
[1:01:53] was the outer shell all they saw was
[1:01:55] your attitude
[1:01:57] all this song was your behavior all they
[1:01:59] saw was your conduct
[1:02:03] but god looked right past the veil he
[1:02:06] looked right past the darkness
[1:02:09] he looked right past the the foul
[1:02:11] talking
[1:02:12] the the all these different things and
[1:02:14] he got right into where that seed was
[1:02:17] and he saw a reflection of himself and
[1:02:19] the darkness had to give way
[1:02:26] that's that's why this message is so
[1:02:27] unique because this message is not
[1:02:30] giving birth to you by accident
[1:02:32] amen it was planned
[1:02:35] by god amen hallelujah
[1:02:38] he said i have no idea why i'm sitting
[1:02:40] here god
[1:02:41] has a plan god has a purpose
[1:02:46] god has a reason virgin i don't know why
[1:02:50] we're in a pandemic god knows what he's
[1:02:52] doing
[1:02:53] amen
[1:02:56] and god said let there be light
[1:03:00] and the bible says and god saw the light
[1:03:03] that it was good
[1:03:05] and he divided the light from the
[1:03:07] darkness
[1:03:08] god now i felt i'm all over the place so
[1:03:10] bear with me turn with me to exodus
[1:03:12] chapter three
[1:03:14] this is where i'd like to spend a little
[1:03:15] bit of time
[1:03:17] exodus chapter three a very familiar
[1:03:20] scripture to all of you
[1:03:25] again we need that leadership of god
[1:03:27] because the footsteps of the righteous
[1:03:29] are ordered
[1:03:30] of god and we read in that same
[1:03:31] scripture where we want the lord to
[1:03:33] order my footsteps
[1:03:35] i want him to dictate my direction
[1:03:38] you know it's so funny because i said
[1:03:40] this to the church before or
[1:03:41] by the home church i say you know we we
[1:03:44] kind of we put our plans together
[1:03:46] and we write them down which is good you
[1:03:48] know i'm going to do this and i'm going
[1:03:50] to do this and i'm going to do this i'm
[1:03:52] going to do this and i'm going to go
[1:03:53] here i'm going to go there
[1:03:54] god looks at you says that's cute
[1:04:01] god looks at us that's cute because your
[1:04:04] ways
[1:04:05] is not god's ways
[1:04:08] and god's ways is not your ways
[1:04:11] but god will watch your step every step
[1:04:14] of the way
[1:04:15] and you'll find yourself directly in the
[1:04:17] lying in the path of god
[1:04:21] you can't be lost he won't lose you
[1:04:26] he's invested too much into you
[1:04:33] in exodus chapter three verse one now
[1:04:36] moses
[1:04:36] kept the flock of jethro his
[1:04:39] father-in-law
[1:04:40] the priest of midian and he led the
[1:04:43] flock
[1:04:44] to the backside of the desert and came
[1:04:47] to the mountain of god
[1:04:49] even to orb so
[1:04:52] moses kept the flock
[1:04:56] of jethro and here you find that
[1:05:00] it's almost as if it's symbolic
[1:05:03] that he's leading uh this flock
[1:05:08] this herd of sheep if you will
[1:05:11] to the backside of the desert
[1:05:14] it's as if it's a a prelude a a
[1:05:18] a a a a forthcoming of what he was going
[1:05:21] to
[1:05:22] do by leading the children of israel
[1:05:25] into the wilderness
[1:05:28] and so you find the scene has been set
[1:05:31] the stage is set and so
[1:05:35] you find where moses is doing this
[1:05:39] and as he's leading them god realizes
[1:05:42] that
[1:05:42] moses can't do this by himself
[1:05:45] [Music]
[1:05:47] and moses had still been reliant
[1:05:51] on his education his learning
[1:05:55] his confidence his abilities not to say
[1:05:59] there's anything
[1:06:00] wrong with that but you can't put that
[1:06:02] before god
[1:06:04] because the bible equally says according
[1:06:06] to proverb
[1:06:07] lean not to your own understanding
[1:06:11] so here you have moses going into the
[1:06:13] back side of the desert
[1:06:15] and i i'm sure he probably had his day
[1:06:18] outlined as far as where he would bring
[1:06:20] the the flock
[1:06:22] and he also had it pictured what they
[1:06:24] would go through
[1:06:25] the path that they would go through and
[1:06:28] so
[1:06:29] as if to say god was not in all of this
[1:06:33] but god already knew the plan that moses
[1:06:36] had outlined for the day
[1:06:38] and so he brought them to the back side
[1:06:40] of the desert and came to the mountain
[1:06:42] of god even to orb
[1:06:44] and the angel of the lord appeared onto
[1:06:46] him in a flame of fire
[1:06:48] out of the midst of a bush
[1:06:51] and he looked and said and he looked and
[1:06:54] behold
[1:06:55] the bush burned with fire
[1:06:58] and the bush was not consumed
[1:07:02] so you got to give some credit to moses
[1:07:05] that he was raised in the in the halls
[1:07:09] of
[1:07:09] pharaoh so he received the best
[1:07:12] education that education can offer
[1:07:14] exactly right so he had all of the great
[1:07:17] scientists
[1:07:18] at his disposal he had all the engineers
[1:07:21] and all of the
[1:07:22] mathematics he had all of the physics
[1:07:24] folks and everyone
[1:07:25] of of of great of great success
[1:07:28] that guided his education right and so
[1:07:31] when he
[1:07:32] saw this burning bush he quickly
[1:07:35] deduced that something is supernatural
[1:07:39] taking place because how is it
[1:07:43] that this bush would burn but it was not
[1:07:47] consumed especially in the middle
[1:07:50] of a hot desert
[1:07:55] and so azure as moses was going along
[1:07:58] his life journey if you will like you
[1:08:00] and i something
[1:08:02] caught his attention
[1:08:05] something supernatural not what we see
[1:08:08] every day but something different i've
[1:08:11] heard a lot of preaching
[1:08:13] i've heard of a lot of testimonies but
[1:08:15] nothing compares
[1:08:17] to this divine word that has caught
[1:08:20] my attention
[1:08:24] i needed a supernatural intervention
[1:08:27] i needed more than a psychiatrist to
[1:08:30] talk to me i needed more than someone
[1:08:32] who i needed more than a theologian i
[1:08:35] needed more than a preacher
[1:08:37] i needed god to step in the scene
[1:08:40] and do something supernatural in my life
[1:08:47] [Music]
[1:08:49] and an angel appeared
[1:08:53] unto him in the flame of fire
[1:08:57] glory god is a consuming fire
[1:09:04] amen moses was getting comfortable in
[1:09:08] the backside of the desert
[1:09:10] so god needed something to ignite moses
[1:09:13] i was getting too comfortable in the
[1:09:16] world and god needed something
[1:09:18] to ignite this soul of mine
[1:09:21] [Music]
[1:09:25] let me ask you are you still excited
[1:09:26] about god today
[1:09:29] amen are you so crazy about god today
[1:09:33] does this word still excite you oh come
[1:09:37] on saints
[1:09:37] you gotta be loud into that i want the
[1:09:39] devil to know that in the year 2020
[1:09:42] in the middle of a pandemic i'm still
[1:09:45] excited
[1:09:46] about my god
[1:09:49] [Music]
[1:09:54] it's going to take a lot more than this
[1:09:56] day satan devil is going to take a lot
[1:09:59] more than this
[1:10:00] it's going to take a lot more than a
[1:10:01] little sickness it's going to take a lot
[1:10:03] more than
[1:10:04] my economic turmoil it's going to take a
[1:10:06] lot more than these little problems here
[1:10:07] and there
[1:10:08] it's already too late if this is if this
[1:10:10] is what you got you got to come
[1:10:12] bigger than that because my god is a big
[1:10:15] dog
[1:10:16] he's able to keep me he's able to
[1:10:18] deliver me
[1:10:25] [Music]
[1:10:28] and the angel of the lord appeared unto
[1:10:30] him
[1:10:32] in a flame of fire
[1:10:35] out of the midst of the bush
[1:10:40] the bush burned he probably sat there
[1:10:42] and watched this bush
[1:10:43] burning and just watched
[1:10:47] and just watched and just watched
[1:10:53] and then in verse three right this is
[1:10:56] this testimony moses says
[1:10:58] i'm going to go see what's happening up
[1:10:59] there
[1:11:04] god knows how to get your attention
[1:11:08] he knows how to get your attention
[1:11:14] moses was going this way he saw that
[1:11:17] burning bush
[1:11:19] i listened to this he saw a burning bush
[1:11:22] he forgot about the path he was going
[1:11:27] that was not accidental god knows how to
[1:11:30] distract you
[1:11:31] you might be going the wrong path god
[1:11:34] knows how to put your stomping dead in
[1:11:35] your tracks
[1:11:36] and have you look directly at the
[1:11:38] promise and say i shouldn't be going
[1:11:39] there
[1:11:40] this is where i need to go praise the
[1:11:43] lord
[1:11:44] get the path of god that your path is
[1:11:48] ordered by god
[1:11:50] thy word is a lamp unto my feet and the
[1:11:52] light unto my path
[1:11:57] not accidental and moses said i will now
[1:12:01] turn aside
[1:12:05] and not even see this sight
[1:12:10] y'all gotta give god some credit i don't
[1:12:12] just be reading the bible just to read
[1:12:13] it because it's fun
[1:12:14] god's trying to tell me something there
[1:12:16] was something special
[1:12:18] about that sighting this was beyond
[1:12:22] his knowledge this was beyond his wisdom
[1:12:24] this was beyond his schooling
[1:12:26] he couldn't explain it right he says
[1:12:30] i need to see this great site
[1:12:33] and what was the site why the bush
[1:12:37] is not burnt
[1:12:41] he haven't even heard the voice yet
[1:12:47] he haven't even heard the voice he
[1:12:48] hasn't even heard the voice yet
[1:12:50] all he saw was just a burning bush and
[1:12:52] he's wondering why is it not burning
[1:13:01] soldier when i came across this message
[1:13:04] i saw some wonders
[1:13:06] but i haven't even heard the voice of
[1:13:07] the sign yet but when i heard the voice
[1:13:10] that completely changes everything
[1:13:18] moses said i will now turn aside
[1:13:22] and see this great
[1:13:25] great sight our god is a great god
[1:13:31] he does wonderful things
[1:13:34] marvelous things
[1:13:38] his ability to do
[1:13:41] beyond what you and i could ever imagine
[1:13:44] or
[1:13:44] think of it was beyond reasoning
[1:13:49] moses had to gather his entire herd
[1:13:53] this was not accident of god this is
[1:13:55] part of the lesson that god was giving
[1:13:57] him
[1:13:58] because you can't do this by yourself i
[1:14:01] got a mission
[1:14:02] he already got a mission for moses he
[1:14:04] has he has he has something he needs of
[1:14:06] him
[1:14:07] but moses can't do it by himself so he
[1:14:09] he he takes moses off his path
[1:14:14] so if you're not on the course that you
[1:14:15] were on before
[1:14:17] it's no accident oh my god
[1:14:22] order my steps in your word
[1:14:25] you can't say that scripture and not
[1:14:27] mean it
[1:14:29] i've entered into a contract i've
[1:14:31] entered into agreement
[1:14:33] when i say amen that means so be it
[1:14:36] order my steps
[1:14:46] now listen to this and when the lord
[1:14:49] saw that he turned aside because god's
[1:14:53] watching all of this
[1:14:55] unbeknownst to moses unbeknownst to him
[1:14:59] have no idea god's god is watching over
[1:15:03] this
[1:15:06] and the lord said the lord and the lord
[1:15:08] saw that he turned aside to sea
[1:15:13] god called him called on to him out of
[1:15:17] the
[1:15:18] midst of the bush
[1:15:21] and said moses
[1:15:24] moses
[1:15:28] the reason why that's important is
[1:15:31] because god
[1:15:31] knows you by name
[1:15:39] god knows you you're you're not just a
[1:15:41] member of the church
[1:15:45] god knows you yes each and every one of
[1:15:48] you sitting here
[1:15:50] by name amen over 7 billion people
[1:15:54] on planet earth and god knows you by
[1:15:57] name
[1:15:59] hallelujah when adam fell
[1:16:02] god didn't just came down in the cool of
[1:16:04] the evening and say hey
[1:16:06] where you at
[1:16:10] hey where are you at
[1:16:15] god knew his boy's name
[1:16:18] he
[1:16:36] [Music]
[1:16:46] that's important saints amen because you
[1:16:48] respond to your name
[1:16:50] amen imagine if jesus went to the grave
[1:16:53] of lazarus he says hey
[1:16:55] come forward every dead saint
[1:16:59] would come forward but because god is
[1:17:02] particular
[1:17:03] god knows every individual by name he
[1:17:06] had to be specific
[1:17:07] he says lazarus come forth
[1:17:15] and lazarus came forth
[1:17:19] when you were dead in sin
[1:17:23] shaping iniquity buried in sin
[1:17:27] that was your lifestyle that was your
[1:17:29] life condition
[1:17:30] and god looked down at you and saved
[1:17:33] gene
[1:17:34] come forth he brought me back from the
[1:17:37] dead saints
[1:17:41] he brought me back from the grave i know
[1:17:43] what it means like to be resurrected
[1:17:45] because i was dead in sin
[1:17:55] so he says moses
[1:17:58] moses
[1:18:03] and moses said this and i want you to
[1:18:04] pay close attention because it's going
[1:18:06] to connect to another verse
[1:18:08] he says here m
[1:18:12] ah three words
[1:18:15] here am i
[1:18:20] moses was saying lord
[1:18:23] i'm available
[1:18:29] you know what's particular about that
[1:18:31] verse
[1:18:35] he didn't say who are you
[1:18:41] he recognized that voice
[1:18:46] you don't make yourself available to any
[1:18:48] spirit that calls you
[1:18:51] to any voice that calls you
[1:18:55] but something about that voice
[1:19:00] especially that that voice knows your
[1:19:02] name
[1:19:04] especially that voice caught your
[1:19:06] attention
[1:19:08] moses didn't dispute say well how did
[1:19:10] you know my name
[1:19:12] moses didn't get into the basis well
[1:19:14] well well
[1:19:15] who are you moses just said
[1:19:19] hear mine that's the same thing
[1:19:23] samuel said when the lord calls samuel
[1:19:26] he says
[1:19:27] hear my.
[1:19:30] make yourself available to god make
[1:19:33] yourself available
[1:19:34] for the service make yourself available
[1:19:38] for god not when you feel like it
[1:19:42] every time you hear this word preach to
[1:19:45] you
[1:19:46] lord hear my
[1:19:50] now holding that thought we'll continue
[1:19:52] reading we'll come back to that this is
[1:19:54] going to be important
[1:19:56] and he said in verse 5 and he said draw
[1:19:58] not
[1:19:59] nigh hither put off thy shoes from
[1:20:04] off thy feet for the place
[1:20:08] where on thousands is holy ground
[1:20:13] so the place that he stood
[1:20:16] was holy ground
[1:20:19] and i could preach another message
[1:20:21] because around this because it really
[1:20:23] links to redemption
[1:20:25] we see that in the story of booth and uh
[1:20:27] uh boyas and ruth
[1:20:30] we see that in in john when john
[1:20:33] uh had to uh was when jesus was
[1:20:35] approaching john and
[1:20:36] and john looked at jesus says behold the
[1:20:38] lamb of god whose shoes i'm worthy to
[1:20:40] unloose
[1:20:41] all types in in there it's it's it's a
[1:20:44] type of redemption
[1:20:47] and so he he as he got closer he says
[1:20:51] take off your shoes and brother bram
[1:20:53] says he didn't ask him to take off his
[1:20:55] hat
[1:20:55] all right god's very specific about
[1:20:59] certain things
[1:21:00] he says take off your shoes for the
[1:21:03] place
[1:21:04] that you stand is holy ground
[1:21:09] perhaps moses have gone places that he
[1:21:12] shouldn't have gone
[1:21:17] perhaps you know he's gone to he's done
[1:21:20] things that he shouldn't have
[1:21:23] but god was getting ready to work with
[1:21:25] him
[1:21:26] so he says remove your shoes
[1:21:30] and i could only but also think that
[1:21:33] god's
[1:21:33] probably saying this is not going to be
[1:21:35] your journey this is my journey
[1:21:39] i'm using you as a vessel to get to my
[1:21:42] people
[1:21:45] can you just imagine what the experience
[1:21:48] must have been
[1:21:50] no one else around but moses
[1:21:53] and god having communion
[1:21:59] there's nothing more uplifting more
[1:22:02] refreshing
[1:22:03] than when you find yourself concentrated
[1:22:06] in
[1:22:06] prayer i'm talking about be prayer
[1:22:10] where you're uttering things to the lord
[1:22:13] that he himself
[1:22:14] only knows in you and you find that
[1:22:17] you're in communion
[1:22:18] with god and
[1:22:21] he's carrying a conversation with you
[1:22:26] and in verse six the bible says from
[1:22:27] over he said i
[1:22:29] am god i am the god
[1:22:32] of your father the god of abraham the
[1:22:36] god of isaac and the god of jacob
[1:22:40] bo so god was trying to identify
[1:22:43] moses with his lineage yes
[1:22:46] yes the first revelation where did that
[1:22:50] come from
[1:22:52] where am i going and so god had to
[1:22:55] address that and put out the way he says
[1:22:57] i'm of the god of
[1:22:58] abraham isaac and jacob
[1:23:02] right and that was important
[1:23:06] because i realized it was much more for
[1:23:08] me as an individual
[1:23:11] to know that my my my roots doesn't go
[1:23:13] back to just my natural tree
[1:23:17] but it's like it's an experience that's
[1:23:19] deeper than that
[1:23:22] and it goes all the way back to the tree
[1:23:24] of life
[1:23:27] my branches are connected to each one of
[1:23:29] you glory
[1:23:30] because your roots go back to the tree
[1:23:32] of life
[1:23:34] amen so when god took that family
[1:23:36] portrait way back in the beginning
[1:23:38] one of you was probably standing right
[1:23:40] next to me
[1:23:43] because god took a family picture i was
[1:23:46] in that photo
[1:23:48] i was right there you know when you're
[1:23:49] like behind somebody you want to make
[1:23:50] sure you're in the
[1:23:51] you're in the picture
[1:23:55] there's no denying that i am part of
[1:23:57] god's family
[1:23:59] you don't don't deny your part you're
[1:24:01] part of god's family
[1:24:03] amen i don't care how many people
[1:24:06] goes before me there's a name there's a
[1:24:08] seat with my name written on it
[1:24:12] and that seat cannot be touched
[1:24:16] amen because i'm part of that family
[1:24:20] i'm part of adam i'm part of abraham
[1:24:24] i'm part of isaac i'm part of jacob
[1:24:29] i'm part of that you're a part of that
[1:24:31] that's the reason why this word
[1:24:33] has more meaning to it than anything
[1:24:35] else
[1:24:40] so god addresses that now listen to this
[1:24:44] in verse 7 and the lord said i have
[1:24:47] surely seen
[1:24:49] the affliction of my people which are in
[1:24:51] egypt
[1:24:53] and i've heard their cry by reason
[1:24:57] of their taskmasters for i know
[1:25:01] their sorrows
[1:25:05] three key words you want to point out i
[1:25:07] have seen
[1:25:11] he's he's observant
[1:25:14] in the midst of your pain and your
[1:25:17] tragedy
[1:25:18] and your everything that you're going
[1:25:20] through the hurt
[1:25:22] the agony the tribulation yes sir
[1:25:25] he's talking to his servant he says i
[1:25:27] have seen
[1:25:28] the affliction of my people
[1:25:32] he said lord you say reggie i've been
[1:25:34] praying for such a long time
[1:25:37] i am i i define myself constantly on my
[1:25:40] knees just praying
[1:25:41] i'm calling upon god and god god looks
[1:25:44] to moses and says i have heard
[1:25:46] their cry
[1:25:49] we're not we're not worshiping an idol
[1:25:51] saying something tell you
[1:25:53] i'm worshiping some some some god that
[1:25:55] doesn't listen
[1:25:56] some god that doesn't see the bible says
[1:25:58] i've seen your affliction
[1:26:02] i have heard your cry
[1:26:06] you might come to church and you're
[1:26:08] happy everything is good
[1:26:10] but when you're at home and you're just
[1:26:11] shedding tears
[1:26:13] and no one has no idea god says i've
[1:26:15] heard your
[1:26:21] and he cry to moses and says i know
[1:26:24] they're sorrows and that's what
[1:26:25] that's for the people that can't even
[1:26:27] find the words to express
[1:26:29] hallelujah sometimes our heart is
[1:26:32] so deep you can't even find the words to
[1:26:34] express
[1:26:35] and god says you don't need to say
[1:26:36] anything but i know
[1:26:43] what a great physician that we worship
[1:26:46] wouldn't it be something if you can step
[1:26:48] into the doctor's office and the doctor
[1:26:49] says i
[1:26:50] know
[1:26:53] i appreciate the doctors but i only know
[1:26:56] one
[1:26:57] who's a great physician the moment i
[1:26:59] step into his practice
[1:27:01] he says i know your problem i know
[1:27:04] your situation and i got the solution
[1:27:07] for you
[1:27:12] amen he's the only physician the great
[1:27:17] physician
[1:27:20] that he can take one look at you and
[1:27:23] says i know what you're here for
[1:27:25] i know why you came to see me i know the
[1:27:28] diagnosis
[1:27:29] and i have an answer for you
[1:27:33] amen that's the god i worship
[1:27:42] moses couldn't have drawn that
[1:27:43] conclusion
[1:27:45] god had to start there with him it says
[1:27:47] i've seen the affliction
[1:27:50] it reached to heaven
[1:27:52] [Music]
[1:27:56] you know the one scripture i like is in
[1:27:57] the book of daniel
[1:27:59] daniel was praying he was praying
[1:28:02] he was praying for an answer from god he
[1:28:04] was praying for an answer from god he
[1:28:05] was praying for an answer from god
[1:28:07] i believe the bible says around 21 days
[1:28:09] later an angel come up to daniel
[1:28:12] and say daniel highly favorite of god
[1:28:15] he says i've come to answer your prayers
[1:28:18] but daniel but the angel had to get this
[1:28:20] straight
[1:28:21] he looks at daniel he says daniel let me
[1:28:23] tell you something the first
[1:28:24] day that you begin to pray god heard
[1:28:28] your prayers
[1:28:31] 21 days later you can say 21 years later
[1:28:35] [Music]
[1:28:38] my prayers i've been praying for 20
[1:28:42] some years and when the answer came
[1:28:45] god says the first day i heard your
[1:28:47] prayers
[1:28:50] jesus
[1:28:54] think about that saints god is so
[1:28:56] mindful of you
[1:28:59] he doesn't forget
[1:29:02] oh yes now
[1:29:06] in verse 8 it says
[1:29:09] and i am come down to deliver them
[1:29:14] out of the hand of the egyptians
[1:29:19] because they didn't belong there
[1:29:23] i am come down
[1:29:26] man there's just so many to this a
[1:29:29] personal pronoun he is
[1:29:31] he says about he says i i am come down
[1:29:35] he set aside his glory you know the way
[1:29:38] the prophet illustrates
[1:29:39] he says when that when his when uh when
[1:29:42] when the atom race fell
[1:29:43] you know michael says i'll i'll do this
[1:29:46] god says it's not for you
[1:29:48] gabriel says i do this and god says it's
[1:29:50] not for you
[1:29:51] the bible says he could not swear by
[1:29:53] anyone greater
[1:29:55] so he swore by himself he says i gotta
[1:29:58] do this
[1:30:00] i am come down to deliver them out of
[1:30:03] the hand
[1:30:04] of the egyptians they were in the grips
[1:30:08] of satan's hands and to bring them up
[1:30:12] out of to bring them up out of that land
[1:30:16] onto a good land in the large
[1:30:20] onto a land flowing with milk and honey
[1:30:23] so i am come down
[1:30:26] dot dot dot to bring them up
[1:30:32] i have come down to bring them up
[1:30:38] i come down so that way he can bring you
[1:30:41] up
[1:30:43] you don't belong here he's called you to
[1:30:46] a higher dimension
[1:30:47] he scolds you to a higher purpose that's
[1:30:49] the reason why the bible says in
[1:30:51] revelation 4
[1:30:52] come up hither you're seated in heavenly
[1:30:54] places
[1:30:55] in christ jesus
[1:30:59] he's brought you he's come down
[1:31:03] think about that how far down did he
[1:31:06] come
[1:31:09] how far down did he come the bible says
[1:31:12] without controversy great is the mystery
[1:31:14] of godliness
[1:31:15] for god became flesh but how far down
[1:31:18] did he come
[1:31:21] he saw his servant's feet they were
[1:31:23] unclean
[1:31:24] so he took a bowl and he came all the
[1:31:26] way down
[1:31:29] he started to wash their feet
[1:31:34] that was your god the creator of heavens
[1:31:38] and earth
[1:31:39] of the galaxy in the universe that we
[1:31:40] gave him credit to
[1:31:42] he stooped so low and started washing
[1:31:44] your feet
[1:31:46] washed your feet but i wasn't low enough
[1:31:52] he bore your sins and my sins
[1:31:57] he went to a place called calvary the
[1:32:00] prophet says that heaven couldn't
[1:32:01] receive him because he was sinful
[1:32:04] he had the sins of the world on him and
[1:32:07] earth didn't want him
[1:32:08] so he was suspended between heaven and
[1:32:10] earth so he went further down
[1:32:13] he went down to hell that's right that's
[1:32:16] right
[1:32:17] he went to the regions where the saints
[1:32:20] were at
[1:32:21] he went even further down and took the
[1:32:23] keys
[1:32:25] of hell and death
[1:32:28] so that way he could bring you up
[1:32:33] the saints came up with them
[1:32:37] he elevated them oh my goodness saints
[1:32:41] listen to me now
[1:32:42] that's the reason why there was an
[1:32:43] injunction that was given to you and i
[1:32:45] an ego's anointing because god is saying
[1:32:49] you're not
[1:32:50] you're not supposed to be down here
[1:32:55] the first beast the lion he was grounded
[1:32:57] to the earth
[1:32:59] the second beast the ox he was grounded
[1:33:01] to the earth
[1:33:02] the third beast the man he was grounded
[1:33:04] to the earth but god said in this stage
[1:33:06] i'm going to give you an anointing of an
[1:33:08] eagle
[1:33:09] we're not grounded to the earth oh by
[1:33:11] the old testament in the new testament
[1:33:14] you ought to take flight above all types
[1:33:16] of things
[1:33:21] he's elevating you to a position
[1:33:27] elevate that's why we elevate one
[1:33:28] another we edify one another
[1:33:30] brother i'm praying for you sister i'm
[1:33:32] encouraging you
[1:33:34] we want to lift each other up because
[1:33:36] that's what we're designed to do
[1:33:41] he came down to bring them up
[1:33:45] out of that land until land that is
[1:33:49] flowing with milk and honey i
[1:33:50] reserved this for some other time but
[1:33:53] there's a reason
[1:33:54] why there's a land a land that's
[1:33:58] over abundance in milk
[1:34:02] and honey the
[1:34:05] the thought that could believe that it
[1:34:06] could be gleaned there a land
[1:34:09] that is theirs
[1:34:12] these were promises that god had told
[1:34:14] the children of israel
[1:34:15] but they had forgotten about it but god
[1:34:17] never forgot about it
[1:34:20] i'm winding down bear with me verse 9
[1:34:23] now therefore behold
[1:34:26] the cry of the children of israel is
[1:34:29] come unto me
[1:34:31] and i have and i have also seen the
[1:34:34] oppression
[1:34:35] where the egyptians oppressed him
[1:34:39] come now therefore and i will send thee
[1:34:42] unto pharaoh
[1:34:46] i will bring you before the very thing
[1:34:48] you fled from
[1:34:56] because what you left
[1:34:59] you left in a different state you were a
[1:35:02] different person when you fled that
[1:35:04] thing
[1:35:05] but you will confront it again but this
[1:35:08] time you're different
[1:35:10] this time you're not by yourself this
[1:35:12] time you got strength
[1:35:14] this time you got power beyond the
[1:35:16] imagination
[1:35:18] i'm gonna send you to pharaoh
[1:35:23] moses didn't that that was not according
[1:35:26] to his plan
[1:35:28] because he tried it himself the first
[1:35:29] time it did not go as planned
[1:35:32] he had to throw the playbook away it
[1:35:35] just it just
[1:35:36] it just didn't work so he drew that
[1:35:40] conclusion
[1:35:40] i gotta find somebody else clearly i'm
[1:35:44] not qualified
[1:35:47] your your criteria is not what god
[1:35:50] uses to dictate your ability
[1:35:54] to do something
[1:35:57] you might be the least spoken person in
[1:35:59] here and god sees the most virtue
[1:36:01] that needs to come from you my god
[1:36:06] each of you have a potential that god
[1:36:09] could use
[1:36:11] we say god not me i'm just gonna be
[1:36:12] happy in the backside just taking care
[1:36:14] of the sheep god's like all right
[1:36:15] you can put that that aside i need you
[1:36:17] for something bigger
[1:36:21] i will save you to pharaoh that you may
[1:36:24] bring
[1:36:26] forth my people
[1:36:29] god says i'm using you as a vessel
[1:36:31] they're my people
[1:36:32] be careful how you treat them
[1:36:34] [Music]
[1:36:36] god's always putting things in
[1:36:37] perspective
[1:36:40] he says these are my people bring forth
[1:36:43] my people
[1:36:44] the children of israel out of egypt
[1:36:48] now listen to this verse 11. and we'll
[1:36:50] wrap up with this
[1:36:53] and moses said unto god who
[1:36:57] am i
[1:37:03] who
[1:37:08] now we had just read
[1:37:11] previously he says lord
[1:37:14] here i am here am i
[1:37:17] use me and now that god says here's the
[1:37:21] task
[1:37:22] he says lord who am i
[1:37:29] it's too late to back pedal now god
[1:37:32] already got you
[1:37:36] amen you've come too far
[1:37:40] for the lord for the lord to lose you
[1:37:41] now you've come all the way here
[1:37:44] god's not going to lose you now saints
[1:37:48] amen
[1:37:54] being available is one thing right
[1:37:58] thinking you're somebody is something
[1:38:00] else
[1:38:03] lord i i i'm a nobody
[1:38:08] who am i that i of all people
[1:38:11] surely you got other people that's
[1:38:14] better
[1:38:15] to go before pharaoh and that i should
[1:38:18] bring them forth
[1:38:19] he started to doubt himself
[1:38:23] let me tell you something when god makes
[1:38:25] a decision
[1:38:29] when god makes a decision about you no
[1:38:32] one can change that decision
[1:38:33] all right praise god amen
[1:38:36] it's a done deal
[1:38:39] like i illustrated too much to like my
[1:38:41] church back home
[1:38:43] i say he took a pen he dipped it in
[1:38:45] blood
[1:38:48] and he wrote your name in the lamb's
[1:38:50] book of life
[1:38:53] in blood in the lamb's blood
[1:38:56] wrote your name
[1:38:59] that's it no one
[1:39:03] no one could ever take that name
[1:39:07] from the lamb's book of life
[1:39:10] it wasn't written today it wasn't
[1:39:13] written yesterday
[1:39:14] it wasn't written 20 years ago before
[1:39:19] the foundation of the world
[1:39:22] before he created the heavens and the
[1:39:25] earth
[1:39:26] before an atom came into existence
[1:39:29] before there was a celestial ball called
[1:39:31] the sun
[1:39:31] before anything
[1:39:35] your name was dipped in blood and wrote
[1:39:38] in the lamb's book of life
[1:39:43] so moses looked to god and says i know i
[1:39:46] told you i was available
[1:39:50] but who am i
[1:39:54] when you're confronted with such the
[1:39:57] awesomeness of god
[1:40:00] and you're in in the task that's at hand
[1:40:05] you feel inadequate
[1:40:08] you feel am i worthy of such a blessing
[1:40:10] and that's the thing what satan tries to
[1:40:12] do
[1:40:13] god sends a blessing to you like am i
[1:40:15] really worthy
[1:40:16] god made you worthy
[1:40:20] he's bestowed such a blessing upon you
[1:40:26] and to give him some ease and comfort
[1:40:28] because that's who our father is
[1:40:31] that's how he operates verse 12 he looks
[1:40:34] to moses and he said
[1:40:36] certainly i this ain't about you most
[1:40:42] god's always correcting the error all
[1:40:44] right
[1:40:46] what do you want me to do i just need a
[1:40:48] vest
[1:40:50] so i got this
[1:40:55] i'm doing this i'm the one that came
[1:40:58] down
[1:40:58] to bring the people up i'm the one
[1:41:00] that's going to deliver them
[1:41:02] out of pharah's head i just need a
[1:41:04] submissive vessel
[1:41:06] you didn't hear the cry i heard the cry
[1:41:08] you didn't see the affliction
[1:41:10] i see the affliction you're back here
[1:41:13] with the jethro
[1:41:14] i know what's going on i needed a vessel
[1:41:16] i
[1:41:17] will do this
[1:41:21] all we are is just a vessel
[1:41:24] in god's hands
[1:41:34] and he said certainly i will be with
[1:41:37] thee
[1:41:38] and this shall be a token unto thee that
[1:41:40] i have sent thee
[1:41:42] word for when thou has brought forth the
[1:41:44] people out of egypt
[1:41:46] you shall serve god upon this mountain
[1:41:51] let's all stand to our feet
[1:41:59] we started the scripture thy
[1:42:02] word is a lamp
[1:42:05] unto my feet and a light
[1:42:09] onto my path
[1:42:14] no matter where life brings you
[1:42:18] you need direction you need
[1:42:22] some illumination to know where you're
[1:42:26] going
[1:42:28] you know what's interesting about that
[1:42:29] the pathway is not
[1:42:32] lit behind you
[1:42:37] the pathway is not lit behind you
[1:42:41] because there's no turning back
[1:42:44] the path is only lit forward
[1:42:49] so that path is illuminated before you
[1:42:53] there's no going back you've come this
[1:42:56] far
[1:42:57] by god's grace
[1:43:01] the bible says in a moment
[1:43:06] in a twinkling of an eye you know how
[1:43:09] frequently
[1:43:10] we bat our eyes and we don't even think
[1:43:12] about it
[1:43:15] some of us done it like in the last five
[1:43:17] seconds that i said that
[1:43:20] but yet the bible says in a moment
[1:43:23] in the twinkling of an eye this mortal
[1:43:28] must put on immortality this corruptible
[1:43:32] must put on incorruption paul was so
[1:43:35] absolute about that word
[1:43:38] he was so certain he spoke with
[1:43:41] authority
[1:43:42] he says it must take place
[1:43:46] must not perhaps maybe must
[1:43:50] so the fact that paul spoke it it has to
[1:43:53] happen
[1:43:57] so that scripture has been preached
[1:44:00] it's been it's it's it's it's it's
[1:44:04] it's made its way through the ages
[1:44:07] you and i should be able to step in and
[1:44:09] say that scripture
[1:44:10] is for me and if i go by the way the
[1:44:14] grave
[1:44:15] this corruptable must put on
[1:44:17] incorruption
[1:44:19] it has to happen but until
[1:44:22] then lord illuminate my path
[1:44:26] guide my decision
[1:44:29] it's about hearts
[1:44:35] heavenly father we i just want to say
[1:44:38] thank you for your
[1:44:39] the richness of your word the purity
[1:44:43] of your word and how true it is
[1:44:47] we thank you for the path that's been
[1:44:51] illuminated before us that the the light
[1:44:53] that's been shed

[1:44:59] we know in whom we have confidence in
[1:45:03] the scriptures say that the footsteps of
[1:45:05] the righteous
[1:45:06] are ordered of god thank you to the lord
[1:45:10] for watching my footsteps for dictating
[1:45:13] my path
[1:45:16] the lord there's a lot of things in life
[1:45:18] that we are uncertain of

[1:46:06] would like to bring some
[1:46:08] some point of division but father i pray
[1:46:11] that you just
