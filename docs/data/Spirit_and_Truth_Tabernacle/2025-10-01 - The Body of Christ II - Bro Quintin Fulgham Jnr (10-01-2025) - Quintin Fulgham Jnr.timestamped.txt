[7:58] [Music]
[8:08] As the musicians play softly, let's go
[8:11] before the Lord in a word of prayer.
[8:14] Lord God, we humbly come before you, oh
[8:16] Lord God, thanking you for another night
[8:19] to worship you, oh Lord God, in spirit
[8:21] and truth, oh Lord God. Lord, is what
[8:24] you seek to desire in this day and age,
[8:26] oh Lord God. Lord, you've gone through
[8:28] all the ages from Adam, oh Lord God, to
[8:31] the Old Testament prophets and believers
[8:33] to the the the new prophets, the new
[8:36] prophets in the New and the New Saints
[8:38] in the New Testament, oh Lord God. But
[8:40] Lord, it was all for this moment right
[8:42] here, oh Lord God, to finally see your
[8:44] sons and daughters restored back to you,
[8:47] oh Lord God. In the beginning, oh Lord
[8:49] Jesus Christ, you said that you made man
[8:52] and woman in your image, oh Lord Jesus
[8:54] Christ, and now this is the day and hour
[8:56] where you can finally see that
[8:58] masterpiece restored back to its former
[9:00] glory. Oh Lord God, the painting that
[9:03] you had in the beginning, oh Lord God,
[9:04] when the devil uh messed it all up, oh
[9:07] Lord Jesus Christ, but now that painting
[9:09] is coming back to its majesty, oh Lord
[9:11] God, the people are realizing who they
[9:14] are in you, oh Lord Jesus Christ. Lord,
[9:16] we are healed. We're blessed, Lord.
[9:19] We're abundantly blessed, oh Lord God.
[9:22] Lord, you blessed us with finances, with
[9:24] health, oh Lord God. Restoration of our
[9:26] families, oh Lord God. Lord, this is the
[9:29] day and age. Oh Lord God, Lord, even
[9:32] though we're still in the flesh, oh Lord
[9:34] God, after receiving the baptism of the
[9:36] Holy Spirit, oh Lord, we're the closest
[9:38] thing to what Adam was. Oh Lord God,
[9:40] restored back to you, oh Lord. Lord, you
[9:43] see your people, oh Lord God. They have
[9:45] needs, oh Lord Jesus Christ. But Lord,
[9:48] we're in a different age, oh Lord Jesus
[9:50] Christ. Lord, we have the fullness of
[9:52] your word, oh Lord God. We've submitted
[9:54] yourself, oh Lord God, to your head
[9:56] messenger, oh Lord Jesus Christ. We know
[9:59] who we are and we know who you are, oh
[10:01] Lord Jesus Christ. We know who you are
[10:04] completely. We know what you desire
[10:06] completely, oh Lord Jesus Christ. Oh
[10:08] Lord, I ask that you would touch every
[10:10] single need. Oh Lord God, every single
[10:12] sickness leap lifted up from them. Oh
[10:14] Lord God, every single financial burden,
[10:17] oh Lord Jesus Christ, your children are
[10:20] supposed to be blessed, oh Lord Jesus
[10:22] Christ, not struggling, oh Lord Jesus
[10:24] Christ. Lord, we thank you, oh Lord our
[10:27] God, and we will we ask that you would
[10:29] continue, oh Lord God, to show us
[10:30] yourself, oh Lord, to us, oh Lord. Help
[10:32] us, oh Lord God, to reach out, Lord, to
[10:35] those final pieces, oh Lord God, of your
[10:37] children that have not that have yet to
[10:39] known you, oh Lord God. Lord, we just
[10:41] want to thank you for your grace and
[10:43] mercy, oh Lord God, and help us always
[10:45] to keep you first in our hearts, oh Lord
[10:48] God. Be with the message, oh Lord God,
[10:50] from the beginning to the end, oh Lord,
[10:52] and we ask it in the precious name of
[10:53] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[10:57] Amen. Thank you, musicians. Uh God bless
[11:00] you, uh saints. Um we'll get right into
[11:03] the message right now. Um
[11:06] we're we're going to uh so the title of
[11:08] the message is the body of Christ part
[11:10] two. We're continuing off from where we
[11:12] left off uh last week with a subtitle of
[11:15] position for a rapture. Uh so we're
[11:18] going to do our opening verse out of 1
[11:20] Corinthians 11 uh 1 through3. So just uh
[11:25] say amen once you're able to get there.
[11:34] All right. And it reads, "Be ye
[11:36] followers of me, even as I also am of
[11:39] Christ. Now I praise you, brethren, that
[11:42] ye remember me in all things and keep
[11:44] the ordinances as I delivered them to
[11:47] you. But I will have you know that the
[11:50] head of every man is Christ, and the
[11:52] head of the woman is the man, and the
[11:54] head of Christ is God." Amen. So, you
[11:57] may take your seats.
[11:59] Um and so we'll begin this journey right
[12:02] now. Uh and here we can see in these
[12:05] Bible verses uh specifically Bible verse
[12:10] uh verse uh number one be followers me
[12:12] even as I also am of Christ. We can see
[12:17] and also in verse three it says but I
[12:18] would have you know that the head of
[12:20] every man man is Christ. And the last
[12:23] part part says the head of Christ is
[12:25] God. We know that the prophet revealed
[12:28] uh the mystery of what the godhead was,
[12:30] which was Christ is the head. Right? So,
[12:32] we can see in these Bible verses where
[12:35] the 144,000 or the Jew and the foolish
[12:38] virgins fail to see the word, right?
[12:41] Because they're living in a day where
[12:42] they are virgins, which means they've
[12:44] kept themselves from the word and they
[12:46] believe the scriptures, but they don't
[12:48] have a head. Right? The bride is the
[12:50] only people in this last day that have
[12:52] the ability to recognize the Godhead,
[12:55] which is the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
[12:56] which is Christ coming inside of your
[12:58] heart, completing uh completing the
[13:00] structure. All right. And so, we're also
[13:03] going to read 1 Corinthians 11 uh 7
[13:06] through3 as well.
[13:09] If you could pull that up,
[13:13] right? And it reads, "For a man indeed
[13:17] ought not to cover his head, for as much
[13:19] as he's the image and glory of God, but
[13:21] the woman is the glory of the man.
[13:24] Uh, for the man is not of the woman, but
[13:28] the woman of the man." Um,
[13:31] and neither was the man created for the
[13:33] woman, but the woman for the man. For
[13:37] this cause ought the woman to have power
[13:39] on her head because of the angels. Verse
[13:42] 11. Neither nevertheless neither is the
[13:44] man without the woman, neither the woman
[13:46] without the man in the Lord. For as the
[13:49] woman is of the man, even so is the man
[13:51] also by the woman, but all things uh by
[13:55] God. Right? And so we want to uh go to
[13:58] Ephesians also chapter 5 and uh read
[14:02] verses um 20 23- 24
[14:08] and then yeah. So there we go. So the h
[14:10] for the husband is the head of the wife
[14:11] even as Christ is the head of the church
[14:13] and the savior of the body.
[14:16] Uh therefore as a church is subject
[14:18] under Christ so let the wives be to
[14:20] their husbands and everything. Um
[14:23] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[14:26] also loved the church and gave himself
[14:28] for it.
[14:30] Uh that he might sanctify it and cleanse
[14:32] it with the washing of the water of the
[14:35] water by the word. And we'll also read,
[14:37] we'll keep going on to uh verse 33 all
[14:40] the way to uh 33. There we go. So that
[14:42] he might present it to himself a
[14:44] glorious church, not having spot or
[14:46] wrinkle or any such thing, but that it
[14:48] should be holy and without blemish. So
[14:51] ought men to love their wives as their
[14:53] own bodies. He that loveth his wife
[14:55] loveth himself.
[14:57] So for no man ever yet hateth hated
[15:00] Well, let's stop. We'll stop right
[15:02] there. Yeah, that's first. Oh, no, no,
[15:04] we'll keep going then. Sorry. So for no
[15:06] man ever yet hateth his own flesh, but
[15:07] nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as
[15:10] the Lord the church. For we are members
[15:13] of his body, of his flesh, and of his
[15:14] bone. For this cause shall a man leave
[15:18] his father and mother, and shall be
[15:19] joined unto his wife, and they too shall
[15:21] be one flesh. Uh this is a great
[15:24] mystery, but I speak concerning Christ
[15:26] and the church. And verse 33,
[15:28] nevertheless, let every one of you of
[15:30] you in particular so love his wife even
[15:33] as himself. And the wife see that she
[15:35] reverence uh her husband. Right? So we
[15:38] can see here in verse 33, you know, how
[15:42] it calls for a unity between these two
[15:45] pieces, right? And this unity allows for
[15:47] a sweetness, right? So if a husband is
[15:50] not loving his wife, he's in the wrong.
[15:52] Completely in the wrong, right? And if a
[15:54] wife is not reverencing her husband, no,
[15:56] she's completely in the wrong. But when
[15:58] you can get both of these pieces working
[16:00] together, the enemy cannot touch a
[16:03] household that is working in tandem with
[16:05] the scripture like that. Satan can't do
[16:07] nothing with it, right? And so, and we
[16:10] see it's the same as the body of Christ,
[16:12] right? So, Christ has to love his wife
[16:15] as well. And Christ has already proven
[16:18] his love for the uh for the church when
[16:20] he died on Calvary. Not only did he die
[16:22] on Calvary, he sent the gentile pish uh
[16:25] gentile people who were idolatry
[16:27] worshiping people. He sent them a
[16:29] prophet that had Elijah's spirit on
[16:32] them. Right? So he proved his love
[16:34] because he sent these people that didn't
[16:36] deserve anything. He sent them the
[16:38] fullness of the word. Right? So now he's
[16:40] waiting for the church to reverence him.
[16:43] Right? Follow his word. Follow his lead.
[16:45] And when she does so completely, the
[16:47] rapture will take place. Right? meaning
[16:50] death can't touch death cannot touch
[16:52] someone that is completely sold out in
[16:54] Christ. Right? It's a beautiful thing to
[16:56] be uh in in the Lord.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; And uh you don't have to turn to it. But
[17:00] Ephesians 1:2 also talks about you know
[17:03] children you know obeying your parents
[17:04] in the Lord uh for this is right. Uh so
[17:08] we're going to start our journey. Um if
[17:11] you could pull up the uh slide
[17:14] um with the you'll see it has like the
[17:17] ox on there. It's a slide with like
[17:19] you'll see a bunch of ox on there and
[17:20] we'll get to that. Uh but now we're
[17:22] going to take a uh we're going to take a
[17:23] little uh detour from we were talking
[17:25] about last time we left off we talked
[17:27] about the prophets the major prophets
[17:29] how how it's important for the body to
[17:30] reference that. Now we're going to come
[17:32] down to the portion of the diagram we'll
[17:35] see it later uh focusing on the men the
[17:37] women and the children. Uh, and so I
[17:41] like um I like this because you know God
[17:44] is in nature and anytime anytime and I'm
[17:48] a person that loves nature like I love
[17:50] animals and I love science because I can
[17:52] see God in it. So when I made that
[17:55] diagram of a circle, right, and it
[17:57] showed Christ was covering everybody in
[18:00] there and he had all of these different
[18:01] layers. I liked it because, you know,
[18:03] you see here these these um animals are
[18:06] called musk oxen and they're hurting
[18:09] animals and you'll see a lot of um
[18:11] you'll see a lot of these different
[18:12] types of animals. You'll see them with
[18:14] water buffalo. They'll do this thing
[18:15] called circle defense where if a threat
[18:18] comes, right? And so one of the threats
[18:20] that the oxen have are wolves. And so
[18:22] the pack of wolves will come and try to
[18:24] attack. What they'll do is they'll put
[18:26] the the youngest ones in the middle of
[18:28] the circle and all the strong ones will
[18:30] stand on the outside and they'll cover
[18:32] the they'll cover the young ones and
[18:34] it's no way for those wolves to get to
[18:36] them little baby ones, right? There's no
[18:38] way for them to get to that. And I like
[18:40] how that types how God has his church
[18:43] covered because Christ is the strongest
[18:45] one, right? And when you receive the
[18:47] baptism of the Holy Spirit, yes, it puts
[18:50] God in your heart, but it also puts you
[18:52] in God, right? So now the enemy can't
[18:54] come and do anything to you,
[18:56] &gt;&gt; right? So um that's why I like I like
[18:59] the structure that we have. And so you
[19:01] can turn to the next slide where we have
[19:03] um it should be the next one right
[19:04] there. Okay. So now we have this little
[19:06] uh diagram that I have. And those black
[19:09] arrows show the enemy right on the
[19:11] outside of the circle. So you see fear,
[19:13] you see sin, you see sickness, and it's
[19:15] trying to get to you, right? It's all
[19:18] trying to get to you, right? The prophet
[19:20] said, "If your life is totally hidden in
[19:22] Christ though, the enemy has to go
[19:24] through the blood in order to get to
[19:26] you. But by the time he passes through
[19:28] the blood, he turns into your brother,
[19:30] right? So there's there's nothing that
[19:33] nobody uh can do to you, right?
[19:36] &gt;&gt; And it also shows that, you know, the
[19:39] further you are in there, you have to do
[19:41] a lot to get out."
[19:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; You got to do a whole lot of work in
[19:46] order to get out on the outside of the
[19:48] circle. Right. So sin doesn't sin comes
[19:51] with a price because you got to pay
[19:53] something. You got to put a sacrifice in
[19:55] something in order to get to sin because
[19:56] that's not how God designed for man to
[19:59] be living in sin. God God never did.
[20:02] When Adam and Eve before Adam and Eve um
[20:05] experienced what they did in the garden,
[20:07] uh uh God, the prophet said God gave
[20:11] Adam and Eve the strongest thing that he
[20:12] could give them, which was his word.
[20:14] Right? If you eat from this tree, you'll
[20:16] be blessed. and if you don't eat from
[20:17] this tree, you know, of course you'll
[20:19] you'll deal with this the things that
[20:20] they had to deal with. So, uh God um God
[20:25] had to fortify his children uh with the
[20:28] word. Just give me one second. My
[20:30] laptop's kind of acting funky. Um
[20:34] okay, there we go. So, um so, and also
[20:38] you'll see a lot of a lot of these other
[20:40] things in here. We're going to talk
[20:41] about these different arrows. So the red
[20:43] arrows, those red arrows that you see
[20:45] that are coming in, that represents the
[20:47] pressure that the enemy is putting onto
[20:50] the people.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; So the further you are inside, the less
[20:54] pressure you feel. I
[20:55] &gt;&gt; mean, Christ is bearing all the weight,
[20:58] &gt;&gt; right? When Christ went to Calvary, uh
[21:00] he beared all the sins in the world,
[21:02] right? And he had to die a death of a
[21:05] sinner, right? And that that was so me
[21:07] and you wouldn't have to do that.
[21:09] Meaning that you could be on your
[21:10] deathbed, right? You could be going in
[21:12] between out of this life and the next
[21:15] life, but you know, you don't got to
[21:16] scream, right? Brother Brandham talked
[21:18] about the story of a man that was dying
[21:20] and they was singing this sad music. He
[21:22] was like, "No, play something snappy."
[21:24] Right? The man recognized where he was.
[21:26] He recognized who his sacrifice was and
[21:29] you can leave this earth smiling while
[21:31] other people are worried or stressed.
[21:33] Right?
[21:34] &gt;&gt; So, it also shows that the further you
[21:36] are in there, the less pressure you
[21:39] experience. Meaning that the major
[21:40] prophet, he has such a responsibility,
[21:43] right? When he went into the veil of
[21:46] time and he talked to the angel, you
[21:49] know, even though he was there cuz God
[21:52] wanted to encourage him, he asked the
[21:53] angel, he said, "Is Paul here? Is Peter
[21:55] here?" And the angel said, "Yes." We
[21:57] said, "Well, then I know I'll make it."
[21:59] So, it just showed the weight that was
[22:01] on him where he was so careful that he's
[22:03] like, "I want to make sure the thing
[22:04] that I'm telling the people is the
[22:06] truth." Right? It shows you the
[22:08] responsibility and the pressure that's
[22:10] uh uh placed upon the people. You know,
[22:12] as you go down further, you know, you'll
[22:13] see different pressures. Uh and it also
[22:16] represents uh pressure can also
[22:18] represent temptation. Uh and so
[22:22] some of the problems is, you know, when
[22:24] uh when we feel temptation or we feel
[22:26] pressure, sometimes people feel like
[22:28] they're on the outside of the circle,
[22:30] right? And that's just the enemy trying
[22:32] to trick you, right? But no, as long as
[22:34] you're in Christ, you're going to feel
[22:35] temptation. When Christ came on the
[22:37] earth, he felt the Bible says he was a
[22:39] tempted above all things. That was God
[22:41] himself. God himself and all his power
[22:43] could not stop temptation. That's right.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? The the prophet
[22:47] said that uh well, the Bible says that
[22:49] Elijah was a man of like passions. He
[22:51] had problems just like me and you,
[22:53] right? The five-fold ministry has
[22:55] problems. Men have problems. Women have
[22:57] problems. We all have problems. We can't
[22:59] escape temptation. But that doesn't mean
[23:02] that you're not in Christ.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. you know, so you don't don't
[23:07] allow the enemy to uh uh to attack you
[23:09] like that. And so you now you'll see
[23:10] this blue arrow on the side where it has
[23:13] the enemy coming out and coming into
[23:15] you. That represents when God allows the
[23:19] enemy to come to you, right? So
[23:20] sometimes God allow the enemy to come
[23:22] and attack you. But the thing about it
[23:24] is it's in a weakened state, right?
[23:27] Enemy doesn't have his full power like
[23:29] he uh like he usually has. So when God
[23:31] decided to test Job, right? And he told
[23:35] he told Satan, he says, "Hey, you can do
[23:36] whatever you want, but you can't take
[23:38] his life." Right? That was a that was a
[23:40] weakening moment for Satan. He stripped
[23:43] Satan down and said, "Hey, you can do
[23:45] whatever you want, but you ain't going
[23:46] in your full form. You got to you got to
[23:49] you got to go and handle him and attack
[23:50] him with what I give you to do." So,
[23:53] which means that God's got you in mind,
[23:55] right? God knows just how strong you
[23:57] are. God knows exactly what you can
[23:59] handle. God knows exactly what what
[24:02] would push you to the edge and what
[24:03] would not push you to the edge. So if
[24:04] you're going through a trial, just know
[24:06] God thought about that already before
[24:08] the trial began. And whatever you're
[24:10] going through, you are more than enough,
[24:13] right, to overcome that thing.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; It's like if you know if Josiah was uh
[24:17] told to play some God pl some God in his
[24:20] neighborhood and the ref said, "Okay,
[24:22] you playing Josiah, but what's your
[24:24] strongest hand?" It's like, "What's my
[24:25] right hand?" You got to tie your hand
[24:26] behind your back. It's a easy victory,
[24:28] right? And so when God gives us trials,
[24:30] they're easy victories, right? And all
[24:33] it does is magnify him and also show the
[24:36] strength uh that he has in us,
[24:39] &gt;&gt; right? And so the yellow arrow is
[24:42] another important one because you got to
[24:44] stay in Christ because a lot of times,
[24:46] you know, brother Jack talked about this
[24:48] thing. You know, a lot of times when you
[24:50] sin, right, it can affect so many
[24:53] people,
[24:54] &gt;&gt; right? Yes.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; So, you know, when the prophet when the
[24:57] prophet decided, we'll come back to that
[24:58] story again. When the prophet decided
[25:00] that he wouldn't go preach to the people
[25:01] that God wanted him to preach to,
[25:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[25:05] &gt;&gt; That gave the enemy access to his wife
[25:07] and his baby girl.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; Right. So, we don't know what the baby
[25:11] girl could have accomplished in life.
[25:12] God had a plan for her.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; But because of disobedience from the
[25:16] prophet,
[25:17] &gt;&gt; right, that ended it right there. the
[25:19] five-fold ministry. Brother Jack has
[25:21] been talking about that Eli when he
[25:23] failed to take responsibility what he
[25:25] did a lot of people suffered there right
[25:28] so anytime you fail to take
[25:30] responsibility on the word you also give
[25:32] access uh to the enemy and it's uh the
[25:36] the uh it's hard to talk about those
[25:38] things nowadays because it's a very very
[25:39] emotional time but in the time of Christ
[25:42] when they saw a blind man the first
[25:44] thing that the uh that the disciples
[25:46] asked was who sinned was it his mother
[25:48] or his father right because They were
[25:50] speaking the word. They was trying to
[25:52] figure out why is this guy suffering,
[25:54] &gt;&gt; right? And Jesus said, you know, of
[25:55] course, it wasn't it wasn't none of
[25:57] that. It's just so his power could be
[25:58] showed. It was the it was the blue
[26:00] arrow, right? So, it just goes to show
[26:02] like especially for you you young kids,
[26:04] you know, you don't you want to obey
[26:06] your parents. The Bible says that you
[26:08] your life is attached to obedience to
[26:11] your parents. And you know, you see all
[26:13] these stories of kids dying young and
[26:15] stuff and you know, and we always feel
[26:17] sorry for it, but the spiritual mind
[26:19] will ask, you know, you know, were they
[26:21] obedient to their parents?
[26:23] &gt;&gt; Right. That's what the spiritual mind
[26:25] would ask first because if they weren't,
[26:27] then they have no promise to life.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying? So, it just
[26:30] shows that we have to be careful about
[26:32] uh uh these different things. Uh another
[26:35] example would be David. Like when David
[26:38] committed that sin, he had no idea what
[26:41] it would do to his daughter, right? His
[26:43] daughter was taken advantage of. And
[26:44] could you imagine how David felt having
[26:47] to look at his daughter, seeing her in
[26:49] that state, and realizing that was my
[26:51] because of my choice, she's got to
[26:53] suffer like this. So it behooves us to
[26:56] stay on the word, right? Your life
[26:58] depends upon it. Everyone else that
[27:01] you're associated with life depends upon
[27:03] it. When Noah was preaching to get into
[27:05] the ark, there was kids on the earth.
[27:07] And when them parents said, "No, I ain't
[27:09] getting on." and kept the kids, the kids
[27:11] all lost their life. God didn't spare
[27:13] not one kid, right? Every single one of
[27:16] them lost their life. So your life is
[27:18] not just your own, right? Uh uh and God
[27:21] God's trying to call his people out of
[27:23] isms. And one of them is individualism,
[27:26] right? Where people get wrapped up in me
[27:28] me I I I, right? But no, that ism can
[27:31] not only just hurt you, but it can hurt
[27:33] all the people you're connected to. And
[27:35] God is trying to call his people out of
[27:37] these things. Right?
[27:39] So, accepting uh as we begin this
[27:42] journey, accepting leadership is a very
[27:44] important thing for us to fulfill as
[27:46] Paul talked about uh in the Bible verses
[27:48] that we uh read. And everybody has to
[27:51] have a head. Everybody has to have a
[27:52] leader, right? And I like how the Bible
[27:55] verse talked about how uh God is the
[27:58] head of Christ. that they're the same
[28:00] exact thing, right? God is Christ,
[28:03] right? But God wanted to show an example
[28:05] that when he was on earth, he couldn't
[28:07] just do whatever he wanted to do,
[28:08] &gt;&gt; right? He had to submit himself to what
[28:11] he said he would do on earth. Meaning
[28:13] that Christ had a head.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of times people, you
[28:17] know, God just don't come around and
[28:19] just say, "Well, I'm going to do this.
[28:20] I'm going to do this." No. No. God has
[28:21] to obey his word. The Bible said because
[28:24] he could swear by no one greater, he
[28:25] swore by himself. Meaning when he says
[28:27] he's going to do this, he's got to do
[28:29] that. If he says it's got to be this
[28:31] way, it's got to be this way. When he
[28:32] came on earth, he didn't need to be
[28:34] baptized. He was already clean. But
[28:36] because he told people and said in flesh
[28:38] you got to get baptized, he says suffer
[28:40] not me to be baptized.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Right? So God leading by example, right?
[28:44] That's the kind of leader in head that
[28:46] you that that you want uh uh in a
[28:48] person,
[28:48] &gt;&gt; right? Um and we kind of um talked about
[28:51] how, you know, even the prophets have to
[28:53] be subject to God. We talked about that
[28:54] story with uh brother Brandham and
[28:57] remember we referenced before how you're
[29:00] you're a pyramid. You're a pyramid and
[29:02] you can't have any shadows,
[29:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[29:04] &gt;&gt; So the reason why the enemy was able to
[29:06] get to brother Brandham is because
[29:08] during that time he had a shadow which
[29:10] was his wife. You know the enemy checked
[29:12] brother Brandham and he just checked him
[29:14] around looked around and said man I
[29:15] can't see nothing but there was a little
[29:17] shadow and that was his wife and that
[29:19] shadow led to hope. Then he went over to
[29:21] hope. She said, "Okay, I see the shadows
[29:23] leading from him to her." And he looked
[29:24] around hoping and said, "Okay, where
[29:26] this thing leading to?" It was leading
[29:27] to the mother-in-law. And he found a way
[29:29] to get into the mother-in-law, right?
[29:31] And then from the mother-in-law, when
[29:32] brother Brandham said, "Yeah, I'm going
[29:33] to go and preach to these people." She
[29:34] said, "You don't you go preach to them
[29:36] people." I think he said, "Don't take my
[29:38] daughter. Go preaching to them people,
[29:39] right? And called them called them
[29:41] trash." Right? And brother Brandham
[29:44] listened to the mother,
[29:45] &gt;&gt; right? Because there was a shadow there.
[29:47] And God got upset. He said, "Oh, no.
[29:50] This is
[29:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; That was a major prophet, right?
[29:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; That was a major prophet that had that
[29:56] chose not to be that chose not to accept
[29:59] Christ as his head, but instead this
[30:02] woman, right?
[30:03] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said when God said when
[30:05] God took away his uh his uh wife was uh
[30:08] sick and his daughter was sick, the
[30:10] prophet said that when he would pray the
[30:12] prayer to try to save them, he said it
[30:13] was like a black streak, right? Meaning
[30:16] that God had made a final decision. He
[30:18] was never going to hear a prayer like
[30:20] that. Right? So don't get put in a
[30:22] position where God ain't going to answer
[30:24] certain prayers. Like we don't want to
[30:25] be we don't want to be caught in a
[30:27] position where because of disobedience,
[30:29] God won't we're suffering with something
[30:31] and God won't even hear what you got to
[30:33] say,
[30:33] &gt;&gt; right? So it behooves us, you know. So
[30:36] uh prophets, they have to be uh uh under
[30:38] under uh uh headship, right? Headship
[30:41] and leadership,
[30:42] &gt;&gt; right? Um and so now we want to uh start
[30:46] uh like I said we want to start looking
[30:48] at the structure of the men, women,
[30:49] children. And we'll we'll start with the
[30:51] men. Right. So the man is the headold uh
[30:54] is the head of the household. Right.
[30:56] Right. And that comes with a lot a lot
[30:59] of responsibility. Right. You know God
[31:01] is trusting which is why I have that
[31:03] trust circle. You'll see between Christ
[31:05] and everyone God has trust right uh uh
[31:08] in a man to lead his household. Not the
[31:11] way he wants it to be led, but the way
[31:13] that God has it designed for him to be
[31:15] led. Right? It can't be you uh uh where
[31:18] you want to go or what you want to
[31:19] achieve in life. No, a man has to be
[31:21] submitted to God and a man has to know
[31:23] God, what do you want to do with this
[31:25] household?
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Right? Um and as uh we read in
[31:30] Corinthians uh the Bible verse, uh the
[31:32] Bible said that the man uh uh is the
[31:35] glory of God. And if we could pull up
[31:37] the um the uh message uh the choosing of
[31:40] a bride preaching 65 paragraph 141. So
[31:44] yo well my clicker is not working. So
[31:46] but yeah you can you can I I'll keep
[31:48] talking until you and you pull it up.
[31:50] But we're going to read a Bible verse
[31:51] from here just to show you uh you know
[31:53] how God uh originally uh uh designed
[31:57] things uh for his people. You know, God
[31:59] makes God made a man in a certain way,
[32:02] right? To uh uh to be able to to lead
[32:05] and handle leadership. And uh uh and
[32:08] when I showed that diagram of those red
[32:10] arrows, you know, a man feels a lot of
[32:12] pressure, right? A man should be feeling
[32:14] a lot. If a man is in a household where
[32:15] he don't feel any pressure, he's leading
[32:17] the wrong way, right? He's got to have
[32:19] some kind of pressure on him. There has
[32:21] to be something, you know, he has to
[32:23] have some kind of concern for God where
[32:25] he can wake up, you know, every morning
[32:27] and um, you know, say, "Lord, am I
[32:29] leading the family right? Is is is
[32:31] everything good? Is every is everything
[32:32] in check?" So, are we good on that?
[32:34] Okay, perfect. So, in the choosing of a
[32:37] bride? Yeah. Preaching 141. Yes. So,
[32:39] we'll start here. It says, "The prophet
[32:40] said, I want to ask you and say
[32:42] something here to you. I want you to
[32:44] notice a few minutes of all the species
[32:46] in the world, birds, animals. We find
[32:48] that on the animal life, all besides
[32:51] human, it's the male that's pretty and
[32:54] not the female. Why that? Look at the
[32:56] Look at the deer, the beautiful big buck
[32:58] with his horns and the little muy do.
[33:01] Look at the hen, the the little speckled
[33:03] hen and the big beautiful feathered
[33:05] rooster. Look at the male bird and the
[33:07] female bird. Look at the malor duck and
[33:09] the female. See, there isn't one species
[33:11] in the world that's made that can
[33:13] deceive and stoop as low as a woman. So
[33:16] read 142. Uh it says, "Now sister, don't
[33:18] get up and go out. Just wait till we
[33:21] hear the end of this." See, see, there's
[33:23] nothing, no female besides a woman could
[33:24] be immoral. You could call a dog a
[33:26] You could call a hog a soul, but morally
[33:29] they got more morals than half the movie
[33:30] star. So he's talking about the world,
[33:32] not sisters that are in Christ, right?
[33:34] Uh movie stars that out there, they
[33:36] cannot be nothing else but moral. And
[33:38] the woman was the one that was changed
[33:41] uh over for the perversion, right? So
[33:43] here we have the prophet uh uh showing
[33:46] that it's the man that's supposed to be
[33:48] the majesty, right? And in the world
[33:50] it's changed over. You know, the female
[33:53] is the one where everyone puts the uh um
[33:56] puts the uh uh the fame at and people
[33:59] worship the women and it's the women.
[34:01] But in reality, it's supposed to be the
[34:03] man that's being uh glorified because he
[34:06] uh he is he's the glory of God. God
[34:08] designed it that way. You know, God gave
[34:10] a man strength. He gave a man
[34:12] durability, endurance, right? And he can
[34:14] lead a household to the destination that
[34:16] it needs to go to. You know, God just
[34:18] built him that way, right? And so men
[34:21] should be reverenced. You know, it's and
[34:22] it's funny because, you know, nowadays
[34:25] in society, you know, it's it's so easy,
[34:28] you know, when you're at a time of
[34:30] peace, it's so easy to get lolled away
[34:32] and fall asleep, not knowing that, you
[34:34] know, in America, we have a lot of
[34:36] freedoms. We got a lot of freedom of
[34:38] speech. You can do what you want. You
[34:40] can say what you want, but you're not
[34:41] knowing that the lives that have died in
[34:44] order for you to keep that, right? The
[34:45] men that have, you know, uh, children
[34:48] that have lost their fam, the their
[34:50] their fathers and stuff in order for you
[34:52] to have these rights, right? Because not
[34:54] everybody in the world agrees that you
[34:56] should have freedom of speech, right?
[34:57] Not everybody in the world agrees, you
[34:59] know, a woman can go to college nowadays
[35:01] and it's fine for a woman to go to
[35:02] college, but there's some countries they
[35:04] will not allow a woman to go to college.
[35:06] They will lock you down just as that.
[35:08] But in America, we have this freedom
[35:10] where we have the ability for us to do
[35:12] these things, right, from men, you know,
[35:14] that have died, right? So the world is
[35:17] the world says patriarchy is wrong. But
[35:20] that's the way God designed things,
[35:22] right? So if you noticed uh in the story
[35:25] of Job, when Job tried uh when God tried
[35:28] Job, you know, it was his woman that
[35:31] wanted him to give up, right? His wife
[35:33] that wanted him to give up. She said,
[35:34] "Curse God and die the death, right?"
[35:36] And Job was like, "No, that's we're not
[35:39] that's not what we're doing." Right? You
[35:41] know, he said, and and notice he told
[35:43] her because he loved her, right? Because
[35:44] a righteous man to marry a righteous
[35:46] woman. He said, uh he said, "You speak
[35:48] like a foolish woman." And the prophet
[35:50] was saying that he wasn't calling her
[35:52] foolish, right? No, that was his little
[35:54] sweetheart. That was the uh the woman
[35:56] that he grew up with a family with and
[35:57] that he loved and he said, "You just not
[35:59] speaking right right now." Right? But
[36:00] honey, we can't do that. We have to
[36:02] stand on the word.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Right? So that was uh uh that was Job
[36:06] and it was understandable for her
[36:08] because the Bible says the woman is is
[36:10] the weaker vessel. You know she was
[36:12] upset because she had lost all her kids,
[36:15] right? Can you imagine all those kids
[36:17] that you nurtured and you raised and you
[36:19] love and she was very very upset, right?
[36:22] But the thing about it was God wasn't
[36:24] looking for her response, right? When
[36:26] and all that was going on. God was not
[36:28] looking for her response. He was looking
[36:30] to see what Job was going to say. He was
[36:32] waiting to see, all right, I I I see all
[36:34] that's going wrong. I see what everyone
[36:35] else is saying. I see what your your
[36:37] church your friends from church are
[36:38] saying. I see all of that. But Job, what
[36:40] do you have to say about all of these
[36:41] things?
[36:42] &gt;&gt; God was looking for the man. That's
[36:44] right. So, it's not even the job of
[36:46] friends in church to run a household. A
[36:48] man has to run his household by the
[36:50] authority and leadership between him and
[36:52] God.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; You can't have anyone else try to come
[36:54] in your household and say what you need
[36:55] to do. No. God gave that household for
[36:58] you to lead,
[37:00] &gt;&gt; right? God gave the household for you to
[37:01] lead, right? And so we know the story.
[37:04] You know, Job, he stood with strength
[37:06] and durability and resilience. And when
[37:08] Job got the restoration of his
[37:10] blessings, his wife enjoyed it. And she
[37:13] was the one telling him to give up. But
[37:15] at the end of the day, she was the one
[37:16] that got to enjoy the double blessing,
[37:18] too.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Job didn't just up and pick and get a
[37:21] new wife and say, "Man, you weren't with
[37:23] me when it was when times were down. You
[37:25] weren't with me, so I'm going to go get
[37:26] another one." No. And I and I like it
[37:28] because it's a beautiful type of Christ,
[37:30] right? You know, Christ, you know, he
[37:32] could have said, you know, oh, y'all
[37:33] don't want to follow my word. I'll just
[37:34] go find somebody else. But no, God said,
[37:37] okay, I I know you you guys are just you
[37:40] doing all these things out of ignorance.
[37:41] I understand it, but I still love you.
[37:43] And he stood the test of the cross. God
[37:46] exalted up and now sent back us his
[37:48] spirit and gave us power when we didn't
[37:51] deserve it. Right? So, it's just a
[37:52] beautiful type there to see a a man uh
[37:55] leading his household. So, um, and you
[37:58] can go ahead and pull up, uh, questions
[38:00] and answers number two, 54, uh,
[38:02] paragraphs 78 to 75. I'll keep talking.
[38:06] So, uh, you know, a a wives, you know,
[38:10] they have to trust their husband because
[38:12] he's got a connection with God, right?
[38:14] You might not know what's going on. Job
[38:16] didn't know what's going on, but he
[38:18] still had this innate trust inside him
[38:20] for God. Even though everything was
[38:22] going wrong, he was like, I still trust
[38:24] God. even though everything's going bad,
[38:26] I'm still trusting God. The wife
[38:27] couldn't see it, but Job could see it,
[38:30] right? Because God made made made the
[38:32] man uh the head, right? And so now men
[38:36] have been given this position and God
[38:38] will hold you responsible for everything
[38:40] that you do, right? You know, uh you're
[38:43] not leading just to chill around like a
[38:45] king and just sit back and just order
[38:46] everybody around just to go and get you
[38:48] something to eat and all that. No,
[38:50] that's that's that's not true
[38:51] leadership, right? you know, which means
[38:53] that you know, uh, everything you say is
[38:55] not thus sayeth the Lord, right?
[38:57] Everything a man says in a household is
[38:59] not thus sayaith the Lord, right? It's
[39:03] not. It's just not, right? And your your
[39:06] family, they have the right to call you
[39:08] out on that, too, right? They have a
[39:10] right to say if you if you say if you
[39:13] come with some weird stuff, they have a
[39:15] right to say, "Is that the word?" Right?
[39:18] So, uh, David, you know, David when, um,
[39:22] Uriah, you know, he David said, "Hey,
[39:24] you can go and have relations with your
[39:26] wife or I was like, no, that's not the
[39:27] word." And that was the king. To say no
[39:29] to the king was deaf. But no, if the
[39:31] king in on the word, you can stand on
[39:33] the word. God gives you ability to stand
[39:36] on the word. So, reading from questions,
[39:38] if you could pull that back up,
[39:39] questions and answers. This is number
[39:41] two, preaching 54. So it says here now
[39:44] these um well hold on a second.
[39:49] Uh is that is that number two?
[39:54] Are you sure that's a no this is that's
[39:56] not the right one. Hold on. It should be
[39:59] questions and answers. Uh number two
[40:02] 54013e.
[40:03] [Music]
[40:06] That's it. Are you sure?
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Hold on a second.
[40:11] that you can pick up what you're
[40:13] reading.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Uh I'm trying to but my mouse is like
[40:15] messed up on the computer on my
[40:17] computer. Yeah. Yeah. Um
[40:20] okay. So just read up the ver just
[40:22] search up um uh angel of the Lord and
[40:27] Zapora, right? And you'll see it's in
[40:30] questions and answer. If someone asked
[40:32] about, you know, did God sought to kill
[40:34] Moses? Uh just search just search that,
[40:39] right? All right. And I can actually try
[40:40] to also search it as well on my phone.
[40:42] Bear with me. I'm very I'm very sorry
[40:44] about that. Uh
[41:02] All right, here we go. Perfect. All
[41:04] right. And this is uh so I'll just start
[41:07] reading from here. Um,
[41:11] someone that asked the question,
[41:16] hold on.
[41:19] Okay. Yeah. So, someone that asked the
[41:21] question, question answers. They they
[41:23] they said they they said they said,
[41:24] "Please explain Exodius the 24th the 4th
[41:27] chapter 24 verse. What does this
[41:28] scripture mean that God aimed to kill
[41:30] Moses or his son and why?" The prophet
[41:32] said, "We know where that's at." at
[41:35] Exodus 4:24. That's Exodus 4:24. That's
[41:38] a good question. Now, here we're here.
[41:40] We'll read it right here just a moment.
[41:42] Exodus 4:24. And it came to pass by the
[41:45] way in the end that the Lord met him and
[41:47] sought to kill him. How many remembers
[41:48] the story? Now, God gave Abraham
[41:50] generations before Moses the sign of
[41:52] circumcision. And that was the covenant
[41:54] that God made that every Jew should be
[41:57] circumcised. Is that right? Every man
[41:58] should be that was a that was a sign.
[42:00] And we are circumcised today with the
[42:02] Holy Spirit uh by the flesh. Now God
[42:05] gave this commandment. Every male must
[42:07] be cir circumcised. And God when he
[42:09] called Moses to go down there and
[42:10] deliver the children of Israel, Moses
[42:12] hadn't performed on his son the very
[42:14] delivering sign. See what I mean? Well,
[42:16] be like me saying all you church now,
[42:18] every one of you, you come in, you come
[42:20] in and be baptized here of water and we
[42:22] put you on the church membership. We're
[42:24] going we're all going to glory. Why
[42:26] brother? That's not scripture. Unless
[42:27] you are born again, circumcised of the
[42:29] Holy Ghost, you got to I don't care how
[42:31] good you are, what church you belong to,
[42:32] how good your parents was, except you as
[42:34] an individual been born again by the
[42:36] Holy Ghost, you'll never go in the
[42:37] rapture. And what he's saying is you got
[42:39] to have headship, right? The Holy Spirit
[42:41] is your headship, right? And without
[42:43] headship, you can't go into the rapture,
[42:45] right? You that's the very delivering
[42:47] sign of circumcision and circumcision by
[42:49] Holy Ghost. Now, the questioner asked
[42:51] this, here's what we want to get to.
[42:52] Does does the scripture mean that God
[42:54] aimed to kill Moses? Uh God means his
[42:57] word, right? Uh
[43:00] uh does the script this scripture mean
[43:02] that God aim to kill Moses, her son? And
[43:03] why? God was after Moses and Zapora was
[43:07] the only one that saved him there. So
[43:09] Zapora got a sharp rock, went and cut
[43:11] the foreskin off her baby and threw it
[43:12] before Moses and said, "Thou art a
[43:14] bloody husband to me." Is that right?
[43:17] And God would have took Moses' life. But
[43:19] no, but but listen to this. But perhaps
[43:22] an angel was standing there and said,
[43:23] "Zapora, catch it quickly." You see, and
[43:26] Zapora went and circumcised the baby,
[43:28] said, "Moses, you're so so concerned
[43:30] about everything else and about your
[43:32] journey that your own boy hasn't been
[43:34] circumcised." Right? So, it's, you know,
[43:38] a man, everything a man does, every
[43:40] decision you make, you might be busy
[43:42] making this plan, the household, we're
[43:43] going to do this, we're going to make
[43:44] this move, I'm going to take this job
[43:45] and stuff like that. And you don't and
[43:47] if you haven't consulted God, you know,
[43:50] God has a problem with that, right? And
[43:52] I like this Bible verse because you know
[43:55] uh uh when it said Moses sought to kill
[43:58] uh when God sought to kill Moses when
[43:59] Moses when God was coming down he wasn't
[44:01] looking to reason it out with Moses
[44:03] right he wasn't looking to say hey fella
[44:05] you know you failed to do this thing or
[44:06] hey man you need to do a better job it
[44:08] said it sought to kill Moses take him
[44:11] out right and Moses played a very very
[44:13] big role but because you know he had a
[44:16] wife that was spiritual that could catch
[44:18] the things the angel was saying she went
[44:19] and did this thing and saved the whole
[44:21] program of God, right? So, as a man, you
[44:24] know, you can't just you can't just not
[44:26] listen to your wife at all times.
[44:28] Sometimes God, if you ain't doing what
[44:30] you need to do, God will come and speak
[44:31] to her, right? And and uh uh to show you
[44:34] what the right way is to be. So, Zapora
[44:37] actually helped Moses, right? It was a
[44:40] really, really big help for Moses
[44:42] because God had just given Moses all
[44:44] this power. He said, "You'll be God to
[44:45] the people." And now here he is trying
[44:47] to take him out, right? and uh and we
[44:50] don't know what would have happened to
[44:51] the children of Israel. So she helped a
[44:53] lot of people, right? So yeah, so so
[44:56] women uh it's it's a woman can be
[44:59] inspired by God to help when the man is
[45:02] not taking his role which is submitting
[45:04] to the word of God,
[45:06] &gt;&gt; right? And we can see the difference in
[45:08] leadership of househo of households when
[45:11] we talk about Abraham and Lot as well.
[45:13] You know, Abraham's lineage went on to
[45:16] be the chosen people of God. You know,
[45:18] but Lot, not only did he lose family
[45:21] members at Sodom and Gomorra, it was
[45:23] 5050 about who was saved. In fact, only
[45:25] three only three people were saved, but
[45:27] after that whole thing, you know, and he
[45:30] was in the cave, his daughters, they did
[45:32] this disgraceful thing, right? And they
[45:34] they slept with their uh with their
[45:36] father. Brother Brandham said that was
[45:38] such a disgrace because it produced a
[45:40] people called Moabites, right? And these
[45:43] Moabites will eventually go against
[45:45] God's chosen people, right? Uh so you
[45:49] know it's and then during that time the
[45:52] false prophet Balam actually came on
[45:54] there and convinced them to all come
[45:56] together because they said we all the
[45:58] same. And brother Brandham said God
[46:00] never forgave his people for that sin
[46:02] that they did. Right? And so it's it's
[46:05] important for you know you know uh if a
[46:08] husband has a household make sure you're
[46:10] not a lukewarm believer. Right? and you
[46:13] want to come to church and you got real
[46:15] believing husbands that want to keep
[46:16] their household in check because your
[46:18] kids are going to interact, right? And I
[46:20] wonder sometimes, you know, if we we get
[46:22] into these lukewarm, you know, states,
[46:25] you know, uh uh that we begin that our
[46:29] kids begin to see you live a certain way
[46:31] and they're just copying off of what
[46:32] you're doing. Right? So, his daughters
[46:34] probably didn't know any better, but
[46:35] they just but because they've been in
[46:37] lukewarm so long, they didn't know what
[46:39] else to do. Right? And so a lot of times
[46:41] we may be raising up these kids that,
[46:43] you know, go against the true revelation
[46:45] of the message, right? And so now we're
[46:47] wondering when we get in a conversation
[46:48] with a brother and he just got this
[46:50] weird doctrine. It's like, where did you
[46:52] get that from? Right.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Right. Sometimes it might be a lukewarm
[46:55] state in the family where that's all
[46:57] that they saw, right? And now they're
[46:59] trying to attack the real revelation,
[47:01] &gt;&gt; right? So it's important for men to uh
[47:04] uh not be lukewarm believers, but be
[47:06] full believers, right? And when your
[47:08] children see a full believer, they'll
[47:09] make the same choices. That's why when
[47:12] Isaac was offered up, the prophet said
[47:13] he didn't kick and scream and say, "No,
[47:15] you ain't killing me, daddy." No, he
[47:17] said, "No, he didn't. He he he knew the
[47:21] walk that he had with his dad. He knew
[47:23] the sacrifice that his dad went through.
[47:25] He had seen it so much and he said, "I
[47:27] trust this plan." Right? Which was why
[47:29] he was the chosen seed and a
[47:31] representation type of Christ because of
[47:33] what he saw in his household.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Right? So moving on to the um moving on
[47:39] uh to the women and women uh play an
[47:42] important role, right? There are certain
[47:44] things that I just can't go to my dad
[47:46] for and and I love my dad. I love him
[47:48] with all my heart, right? But there's
[47:50] just there's just whenever I'm going
[47:51] through some things, you know, um it's
[47:53] it's something about going back to my
[47:55] mom where she just understands me and
[47:57] she just gets me and it's kind of like,
[47:59] you know, uh you know, there it's an
[48:03] understanding that just can't be
[48:04] replicated by a father. Like a father,
[48:06] when you go to a father with a problem,
[48:09] you know, he'll give you like a solution
[48:11] or he'll just kind of, well, you just
[48:13] need to grow like that. But a mother
[48:15] will be like, you know, she'll be
[48:17] understanding. She'll be right. And it's
[48:19] a and and a lot of times, you know, a
[48:21] mother, you don't even have to tell her
[48:23] something's wrong. She just knows
[48:25] something wrong. That's one thing that
[48:26] that I I'll say with my mom that now
[48:29] that I'm older, and I still depend upon
[48:30] her for a lot of stuff. I don't realize
[48:32] it, but sometimes she just knows when
[48:35] you upset. You You be on the phone, you
[48:36] be like, "Hey, what's going on?" She be
[48:38] like, "What's wrong?" I'll be like,
[48:40] "Geez."
[48:42] Like, she just knows there's something
[48:44] wrong there, right? It's just something
[48:46] about a mom that's got that sense. She's
[48:48] got that power and she's someone that
[48:50] you can just like put your head on like,
[48:52] you know, mom, this is what's going on.
[48:54] I mean, all the psychologists we have in
[48:56] the world and uh all the psychiatric
[48:59] medicine we got and self-help books, you
[49:01] know, a godly mother, right, in a
[49:03] household, man, I mean, that can be that
[49:05] can be a big cure.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; I remember one time when I was sick with
[49:09] the flu when we were living in Georgia
[49:11] and I remember my mother, she stood by
[49:13] me the whole entire night. It's one of
[49:14] it's one of the memories that is locked
[49:16] in my soul. I was so sick, but I felt so
[49:19] much better just because she was right
[49:21] there. I remember she was in this she
[49:22] was in that brown rocking chair and she
[49:24] stood with me all night and she put her
[49:25] head on my forehead and I remember it
[49:27] and I was sick but I felt so much better
[49:30] just because she was right there and
[49:31] that memory is uh still in my in my
[49:34] heart uh to this day. Right? So, a
[49:36] mother has a um a mother has a very very
[49:40] uh uh important role,
[49:41] &gt;&gt; right? Um now, with all of that, you
[49:44] know, a woman a woman uh uh a woman's
[49:48] head is supposed to be the husband,
[49:50] right? That's that's the way uh uh God
[49:52] designed it. Meaning that there are
[49:54] there are some things like I said with
[49:55] the story of Job, God will talk to the
[49:57] husband about, but he won't tell you,
[49:59] right? He will not tell the woman. And
[50:02] sometimes, you know, a woman can try to
[50:04] take uh uh try to take charge or take
[50:07] over the uh the position of the man. And
[50:09] we see a lot of that comes in the
[50:11] beginning. Uh you know, when Eve thought
[50:14] she could she could lead because she got
[50:16] smart, right? She got a lot of
[50:17] intellect.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; When Eve committed adultery, uh in the
[50:21] beginning, the the enemy promised the
[50:23] enemy told her a lot of lies, but he
[50:25] gave her some truth,
[50:26] &gt;&gt; which was why it was such it was so
[50:28] deception. You got to be careful. That's
[50:30] for the five-fold ministry. I'm not
[50:32] coming here to give you my idea, right?
[50:34] I'm taking my revelation. I'm putting it
[50:36] through the word and then I'm searching
[50:39] the message to say, "What did the
[50:40] prophet say about this thing?" Right?
[50:42] Because I I don't want to come and tell
[50:43] you some things that's word and
[50:45] something that's off the word, right?
[50:47] No, I I I admit I might be a smart guy,
[50:50] but the prophet is a lot smarter than me
[50:52] when it comes to spiritual things. I'm
[50:54] in college. He had a seventh grade
[50:55] education, but the man is my head,
[50:58] right? And so when I come with you for a
[51:00] message, I'm going to make sure I pass
[51:01] it through what he says because I don't
[51:03] want to be deceived.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Right?
[51:05] &gt;&gt; G.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; That's that and that's the uh the
[51:07] position uh that a head should take. So
[51:09] Eve when she when she committed
[51:11] adultery, the the serpent, he did
[51:14] promise her something and and he
[51:15] promised her that she would be like God,
[51:18] meaning that she would get and she would
[51:19] get uh intelligence, right? She would
[51:21] get intellect and she did get that
[51:23] thing, right? Um, but notice with all
[51:26] that intellect that she got, she failed
[51:29] two things. One, she forget. She she
[51:31] failed to ask forgiveness from her
[51:34] husband for what she just did, right?
[51:36] There was nothing convicting her to say,
[51:38] "Hey, I'm sorry. I messed up." You know,
[51:40] I just went and just committed adultery
[51:42] to you. And and you know, she should
[51:44] have felt wrong, but she didn't feel
[51:46] that way. You see what I'm saying? Uh,
[51:48] and the second thing was that she stayed
[51:51] naked, right? she didn't clothe up. But
[51:54] um and that's the condition that we
[51:57] actually have in the world today. We
[51:59] have more women with degrees. There's
[52:01] more women that get accepted into
[52:03] medical school. I mean, PhDs all over
[52:05] the place. I'm going to college now. And
[52:08] some of the things that these girls are
[52:10] wearing, it's like, and it makes me feel
[52:12] old, but when I was in high school, they
[52:15] didn't wear stuff like that. I mean,
[52:16] they're showing things I ain't know it
[52:17] could get that worse, but they showing
[52:19] stuff that it's like I ain't even know
[52:21] you could you would like why would you
[52:23] lead a house like that?
[52:25] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? And these
[52:27] kids, you know, they're not under
[52:28] headship because they're in college. So,
[52:30] they can do these things, right? Because
[52:32] maybe if they would have been under
[52:33] headship of a father and a mother and
[52:35] tried to walk out the house like that,
[52:37] they would have had some protection. You
[52:38] know what I'm saying? But, but everybody
[52:40] on campus is not like me. You got some
[52:42] wolves out there and when they see stuff
[52:44] like that, you you are an easy target,
[52:47] right? And that's why we have certain
[52:48] things that uh happened on on college
[52:50] campuses, right? But listen, when when
[52:53] Adam also went and committed this sin
[52:56] with Eve, he also got smarter, right?
[52:58] Because his they said they said his eyes
[53:00] open. But what what what did Adam do
[53:02] when his eyes were open? He clothed both
[53:04] of them, right? So even in a fallen
[53:08] state, God still has confidence in a
[53:11] man, right, to make the right choices,
[53:14] right? So even though they were in this
[53:15] state, now he shouldn't have used fig
[53:17] leaves, right? That's why he was wrong
[53:19] for using the fig leaves, but he was
[53:21] still right for trying to cover them up
[53:22] because God still even though he took
[53:24] the fig leaves away, he still covered
[53:26] them up, right? So he had enough of God
[53:28] inside of him to say, "No, no, we can't
[53:30] just walk around God's garden like this.
[53:32] We can't be we can't be looking like
[53:34] this." You know? All right.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; No. So, could you imagine if God would
[53:38] have came down to the garden before Adam
[53:41] got to her and seen Eve naked like that?
[53:43] How would he have reacted? He would have
[53:45] probably took her off the scene, right?
[53:47] But uh Adam had sense enough, right, to
[53:50] say, "No, we have to be covered. We got
[53:52] to cover up. We can't just go before God
[53:55] any old way, looking any old way,
[53:57] right?" And that's what Christ has come
[53:59] come to do for us. That's why he sent us
[54:01] the the prophet. He sent us the
[54:02] five-fold ministry to cover us up
[54:04] because God's coming back and he can't
[54:07] just have a bride looking any old way
[54:09] and wearing any old thing,
[54:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:12] &gt;&gt; So, um, so God, so you know, you and you
[54:16] and and I'm not saying, you know, you
[54:18] know, sisters shouldn't go to college.
[54:19] That's not what I'm saying. um you know
[54:22] you might be able to go to college you
[54:23] know but even in all of that because we
[54:25] got a lot of women that get you know the
[54:28] MBAs and the masters and the PhDs and
[54:31] you know you might God might lead you to
[54:33] marry some plumber that is just you know
[54:35] he don't
[54:37] &gt;&gt; he don't got a he don't got to lick a
[54:39] culture or language or nothing right and
[54:41] you might be very very smart very very
[54:44] intelligent you know you can invite all
[54:46] the top experts in your field you come
[54:48] to the house you're sitting down talking
[54:50] and the husband there, you just there
[54:52] just words going around and say he don't
[54:54] know what you're saying, right? He don't
[54:57] know what's going on, right? But God has
[55:01] more confidence in that man to lead the
[55:03] house even in that state. He might not
[55:06] be able to spell his name. He might not
[55:08] be able to talk about the what's going
[55:09] on with of politics, but God has
[55:12] confidence that that man can lead the
[55:15] household. When we look at the story of
[55:17] Jeremiah, uh Jeremiah was a young kid
[55:20] and he said, and when God was calling
[55:21] Jeremiah, he was like, "I'm young." God
[55:23] said, "Don't say I'm young." Right? And
[55:26] he said, "I've put my word in your
[55:28] mouth." Now, there were a bunch of
[55:29] ministers there that knew the scriptures
[55:31] back to front. There was very
[55:33] wellversed. The priesthood was still
[55:35] going on, but God had confidence in that
[55:37] little kid that didn't even want to get
[55:39] out, right? He said, "I put my I've put
[55:41] my word in your mouth. You can build
[55:43] kingdoms and you can destroy kingdoms.
[55:45] And all that power was in a little kid,
[55:47] right? But because he was a prophet, God
[55:49] had confidence in him that he would make
[55:51] the right decision, right? And that's
[55:53] why God has placed us in each of our
[55:55] positions because he has confidence that
[55:57] we'll make the right choices.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, we'll make mistakes. Adam made
[56:01] mistakes, but you could tell from Adam's
[56:03] heart that he was trying to keep the
[56:05] family together,
[56:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, um, and you know, and that's
[56:11] why some, you know, fathers, you know,
[56:12] you have to be careful when you're
[56:14] raising, uh, daughters, uh, because, you
[56:17] know, you can't baby them, right?
[56:18] They're not going to be in your
[56:20] household forever. You know, they might
[56:22] be your little your little baby, your
[56:24] little queen. Um, but eventually they're
[56:27] going to be somebody's wife, right? And,
[56:29] you know, and then you you and you give
[56:31] them you give them to the husband like
[56:33] that and he's got to unwind things and
[56:35] like, you know, I can't just do whatever
[56:37] you want me to say. like your dad did,
[56:39] right? Dads, man, they'll I mean,
[56:41] they'll drop everything for their
[56:42] daughters and stuff like that, right?
[56:45] But when you become when you when you
[56:46] come married to a man, you know, he
[56:48] can't do that, right? If God's telling
[56:50] him to do this thing and you saying this
[56:52] thing, you know, you're putting him in
[56:54] like a a tough spot cuz he don't want to
[56:56] make you upset, but he don't want to he
[56:58] don't want to say no to God. So, now
[57:00] he's like, "Man, what do I do?"
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[57:03] So we have to we have to make sure that
[57:06] you know and that's for guys too. You
[57:08] know you know you know moms can't be
[57:10] babying boys right you can't just sit up
[57:13] there and say you know oh that's my baby
[57:15] boy I'll just drop everything for him.
[57:17] Nah nah he's got to learn how to respect
[57:18] you right you know he needs to learn how
[57:20] to carry the groceries. He needs to
[57:22] learn how to you know if you tell him to
[57:24] move the desk from over there he needs
[57:25] to put his back into it and move that
[57:27] thing over there. Right? You know,
[57:29] you're trying to raise kids that, you
[57:31] know, uh uh when they when they get into
[57:34] relationship, they have respect for each
[57:35] other already.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; You see what I'm saying?
[57:38] &gt;&gt; And we're missing a lot of that. We're
[57:40] missing a lot of good examples that kids
[57:43] can see, right? And so, because they
[57:45] can't see it, what do they do the next
[57:47] best thing? They try to get an education
[57:48] about it. But that don't do it. That was
[57:50] not ever God's original plan. God wanted
[57:53] you to see parents and see an example,
[57:55] right? That's why the Bible said the
[57:57] gospel didn't just come in word only,
[57:59] but it came in action. Right? When Jesus
[58:01] Christ came, he was physically baptized.
[58:03] He physically cast out devils. He
[58:05] physically died on the cross. He
[58:07] physically made a rapture just so we
[58:09] could see these things to believe. And
[58:11] that's what kids are looking for, uh, in
[58:13] parents.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. So, um, so when you're, you
[58:18] know, you know, some of your young
[58:20] sisters here, you know, you're looking
[58:21] for a husband. Uh, you know, don't just
[58:24] don't just stop at having the same
[58:26] hobbies, right? You know, oh, we got the
[58:28] same hobbies. We got the same favorite
[58:30] color. We listen to the same gospel
[58:34] artist. You know, I mean, he just
[58:36] completes every word I say, he just
[58:37] completes it. You know what I'm saying?
[58:39] You know, no, that's that's a quality,
[58:41] right? But you have to be able in your
[58:43] heart to say, can I submit to this man?
[58:46] &gt;&gt; All right.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; All right.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; You learn submission. And this is just
[58:50] wisdom. Learn submission before you get
[58:53] married. Don't try to learn it while
[58:55] you're married, right? Because y'all are
[58:57] still trying to figure things out. And
[58:58] that just adds another layer of
[59:00] complication, right? Men know how to
[59:03] work. Know how to work to the bone.
[59:05] Don't just try to be a hard worker when
[59:06] you get married. No. Know how to do that
[59:08] thing, you know, before you get into a
[59:10] marriage.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, uh, if you could turn to,
[59:16] uh, 1 Peter, uh, 3:7. Uh, we just want
[59:19] to read a little bit of verses here, uh,
[59:22] about, uh, what, um, what Peter had to
[59:25] say about this thing
[59:28] um about, you know, the the household.
[59:32] Here we go. So it says, "Likewise, ye
[59:34] husbands, dwell with them according to
[59:36] knowledge, giving honor unto the wife as
[59:38] unto the weaker vessel, and as being
[59:40] heirs together the grace of life, that
[59:42] your prayers uh be not Oh, it's five
[59:44] 5-7. Yeah. Five. For after this manner
[59:48] in the old time, the holy women also who
[59:51] trusted in God adorned themselves, being
[59:54] in subjection unto their own husbands."
[59:56] And verse six, even as Sarah obeyed
[59:59] Abraham, and look at that, calling him
[1:00:02] Lord, right? And that's the New
[1:00:04] Testament. Now, I'm not saying you got
[1:00:06] to call your husband Lord. That
[1:00:09] that would be a lot that would be way
[1:00:11] way too much. But from your heart, you
[1:00:14] know, he's got to be the person that you
[1:00:15] have confidence in. Like, you got to
[1:00:17] have confidence in this man. And and so,
[1:00:20] uh uh submission is not supposed to be
[1:00:22] like this scary thing. You know, a lot
[1:00:24] of times when you when you talk about
[1:00:26] submission, it just gets quiet. It's
[1:00:27] just it's just I mean, everyone just
[1:00:29] it's like you it's like you're trying to
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; I don't know how to explain it, right?
[1:00:35] Um but and and you have to remember now,
[1:00:39] this only works if you have the Holy
[1:00:42] Ghost,
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; right? If if you marry a man that don't
[1:00:46] got the Holy Ghost, submission is going
[1:00:48] to look totally different for you. You
[1:00:49] know, if you're a man and you marry a
[1:00:51] girl that don't got the Holy Ghost, your
[1:00:52] household is going to look totally
[1:00:54] different. Everybody needs the Holy
[1:00:56] Ghost for this to work, right? The Holy
[1:00:58] Ghost puts you both under subjection to
[1:01:01] the It gives you the power. That's why
[1:01:03] the Bible said, "I'll give you a new
[1:01:04] heart." Don't just stop there. He said,
[1:01:06] "And I'll give you my spirit to do what?
[1:01:08] To cause you to walk into the word."
[1:01:11] Right? So, it'll help you walk into the
[1:01:13] word when you surrendered totally
[1:01:15] surrendered uh to the to to the word.
[1:01:18] And so you and so you know and feminism
[1:01:20] yeah that's another ism has made has
[1:01:23] made uh submission look so so scary and
[1:01:28] so like bondage in this time right but
[1:01:31] you know there's a there's a girl in the
[1:01:32] Bible that I like and that's Esther
[1:01:35] right and Esther was a very very sweet
[1:01:37] wife and when it came time to go before
[1:01:40] the king to ask the king for help you
[1:01:42] know with the people we know that we all
[1:01:44] know that happened she was afraid just
[1:01:46] to approach him right And I like that
[1:01:48] because it showed reverence that she had
[1:01:50] for her husband. Like she just didn't
[1:01:52] want to come to him any old way. Like
[1:01:53] and if you notice, he had made a mistake
[1:01:56] cuz he got deceived into uh causing Mori
[1:02:00] deceived him into causing uh him to take
[1:02:02] out her Heymon. Yeah. Hmon deceived him
[1:02:05] to take him to take out the Jewish the
[1:02:07] Jewish people. So the king had made a
[1:02:10] wrong decision and didn't know it. And
[1:02:11] Ezra ain't going there and just say,
[1:02:12] "You big dummy. You know this is my
[1:02:15] people that you about to go kill.
[1:02:17] Right? She didn't just go up there and
[1:02:20] at night time slap him side the head or
[1:02:22] pour water on his face while he's
[1:02:23] sleeping. Look, you know what you just
[1:02:25] did to to to my people, right? She
[1:02:27] didn't do that. She was afraid to
[1:02:29] approach him and it's it's it's a it's a
[1:02:31] it was a sign of reverence, right? And
[1:02:33] so when she finally got the courage to
[1:02:35] go and approach him and you know, she
[1:02:37] was dressed a certain way and I like
[1:02:38] that because she was clothe I like
[1:02:40] clothed in humility. She came before him
[1:02:42] and the king the uh the king put forth
[1:02:44] the scepter and she touched it. Before
[1:02:46] she said anything, he said, "Whatever
[1:02:48] your request is, I'll give you half the
[1:02:50] kingdom if you if you want it." So
[1:02:52] that's what submission looks like.
[1:02:54] Right? And so that's why you need a Holy
[1:02:55] Ghost fil husband. If you can submit to
[1:02:58] your husband, he ought to give you half
[1:03:00] of everything.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Right? He ought to give you half of
[1:03:04] everything.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about no $15 Starbucks
[1:03:09] gift cards. No, he got to give you
[1:03:11] something that makes it hurt, you know,
[1:03:13] makes he got to give you some, you know,
[1:03:15] the newest Mercedes. Right. If he's got
[1:03:18] to Amen.
[1:03:20] Amen.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. When when we're when when
[1:03:28] it's it's the truth, right? When when
[1:03:31] when
[1:03:33] we have submitted to Christ, what does
[1:03:36] he do? He gives us everything, right? He
[1:03:39] gave us everything. Anything the Bible
[1:03:42] says, if if you abide in me and my word
[1:03:44] abides in you, ask what you want, right?
[1:03:48] And so a wife submitted to her husband
[1:03:50] ought to be able to ask anything, right?
[1:03:53] And if the husband loves a wife, just as
[1:03:56] God said, husbands, love your wives as
[1:03:58] Christ loved the church, you ought to be
[1:04:00] able to deliver. All right? You ought to
[1:04:02] be able to deliver.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Ought to be able to deliver for her
[1:04:05] because she's doing everything she can.
[1:04:07] She's sacrificing a lot for you. So, she
[1:04:10] deserves the world.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Right. So, we love we love to see uh uh
[1:04:16] women are very very special in the
[1:04:18] economy of of God. And if you could turn
[1:04:20] to the um the message uh questions and
[1:04:23] answers uh number three uh 64, preaching
[1:04:26] 64, paragraph 1 uh through 14.
[1:04:31] And I'll try to pull it up as well.
[1:04:39] Okay. Yeah, this is good. Perfect.
[1:04:40] Perfect. Perfect. So, we can we want to
[1:04:42] see just how strong a woman can be,
[1:04:44] right? So, it says here, "Well, then if
[1:04:46] the wife if the wife is saying this to
[1:04:48] you when she's saying has a right to say
[1:04:50] it, you better get right." See, then if
[1:04:52] and if someone was asking a question
[1:04:53] about if you're living with someone that
[1:04:55] is like not a believer and you're a
[1:04:56] believer, then if see if she is saying
[1:04:59] it just to be evil, remember the Bible
[1:05:00] said it was better that a millstone was
[1:05:02] hanged at your neck and drowned in the
[1:05:03] depths of the sea. Then even to offend
[1:05:06] offend the Lisa these my little ones.
[1:05:07] Now that's what that's just your and
[1:05:10] maybe this wife is not that type of
[1:05:12] person. Maybe she's a different maybe
[1:05:13] she's a good person. Maybe she's just
[1:05:15] testing to see what you'll do. Now stay
[1:05:17] in love with her and let her see Jesus
[1:05:20] in you. You do that. See, you just go on
[1:05:22] some I give a little illustration this
[1:05:24] morning about a person that one time and
[1:05:25] this is the story we want to get to. One
[1:05:27] time this little woman had received the
[1:05:29] Holy Ghost. She was very she was a very
[1:05:31] sweet little person. They said, "Well,
[1:05:33] she had a hard life and her husband was
[1:05:35] an alcoholic." And so she just kept on.
[1:05:38] She bore with him. He says, "You want to
[1:05:40] go to church, honey? Take off." But now
[1:05:42] he went down to the saloon down at the
[1:05:44] old Brown Derby down here going on. They
[1:05:47] had they had hung out there all the
[1:05:49] time. Used used to be the Bonafires.
[1:05:51] Many of you old-timers here remember
[1:05:53] when Bonafire had there on the corner of
[1:05:55] it. It's called Brown Derby now, I
[1:05:57] believe it is. So hanging around down
[1:05:59] there and the first thing you know one
[1:06:01] night come up a question about church
[1:06:03] and Christians. One of the old drunks s
[1:06:05] set s set s set s set s set s set s set
[1:06:05] s set s set s set sitting there said
[1:06:06] there ain't no such thing as Christians
[1:06:07] anymore and there is there's no such a
[1:06:10] thing all this bunch of hypocrites said
[1:06:12] you see them out here smoking drinking
[1:06:15] doing the same thing that we do and
[1:06:16] that's why it's so important for us to
[1:06:18] live the message of the hour because
[1:06:20] people are seeing what an example of a
[1:06:23] Christian is and if you're displaying
[1:06:24] something false you can't be pleasing
[1:06:26] God
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; right the same thing that and we do said
[1:06:30] call themselves Christian there is no
[1:06:32] such thing and Uh, paragraph 18. This
[1:06:35] one drunk raised up and said, "Just a
[1:06:36] minute. There's one that I know about."
[1:06:39] Said, "Who is it?" Said, "It's my wife."
[1:06:41] See, she'd become salty. He was catching
[1:06:43] it all the time. He said, "I bet if I
[1:06:45] bet if she was put to a squeeze," he
[1:06:47] said, "No, she's still a Christian. I'll
[1:06:49] prove it to you." Said, "I tell you
[1:06:51] what, I'll tell you what. Let's do Let's
[1:06:52] go up home and I'll show you whether
[1:06:54] she's a Christian or not." Said, "Let's
[1:06:56] go up home and now let's really be
[1:06:57] drunk. We're going to act like we're
[1:06:59] we're really drunk." knocked at the door
[1:07:01] coming staggering over everything and
[1:07:03] while the chair sitting around this way
[1:07:05] and everything and she set them all a
[1:07:08] chair and his guests, you know, and
[1:07:09] tried to make them just as welcome as
[1:07:11] she could be. She was a real Christian.
[1:07:13] Said, "I want you to fix us some
[1:07:15] supper." And they said, she went out and
[1:07:17] fixed them. Said, "We want ham and
[1:07:19] eggs." He know that they had it. So they
[1:07:22] fixed the ham and eggs. When he got
[1:07:23] there at the table, he looked at them
[1:07:25] like that, picked up his plate, and
[1:07:26] slammed the stuff on the floor. Now, I
[1:07:29] want you to take inventory right now. If
[1:07:32] your husband did that to you, how would
[1:07:34] you respond?
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. You know, or if your wife
[1:07:40] came and responded to towards you a
[1:07:42] certain way, how would you respond,
[1:07:44] right? Because we want to take we want
[1:07:46] to take inventory about, you know, our
[1:07:48] life and who's in control and who is
[1:07:49] Lord of our life. He said, he looked at
[1:07:52] them like that, picked up his plate,
[1:07:53] slammed his stuff on the floor, and
[1:07:54] said, you know, I don't like my eggs
[1:07:56] like that. Come on, boys. Let's get out
[1:07:57] of here. Anyhow, like that. Like that.
[1:07:59] They went out and sat down like that,
[1:08:01] you know. And she come out. She said,
[1:08:02] "Dear, I'm sorry. I didn't get them
[1:08:05] fixed. I'll fix some more for you." Old
[1:08:07] nonsense. You know, I didn't want want
[1:08:10] them that way in the first place. Just
[1:08:11] carrying on like that. They went out
[1:08:13] there and sat down and act like they was
[1:08:14] drunk. They heard her in there kind of
[1:08:16] stubbing to herself singing real low
[1:08:19] voice. Must Jesus bear the cross alone.
[1:08:21] All the world go free. There's a cross
[1:08:23] for everyone and there's a cross for me.
[1:08:26] This consecrated cross I'll bear till
[1:08:28] death shall set me free. One drunk
[1:08:30] looked at the other and said, "See,
[1:08:32] she's a Christian. She got it." And that
[1:08:35] little woman led her husband plus these
[1:08:38] others to Christ that night, right? No
[1:08:41] sermon preached, no arguing, right? Just
[1:08:45] a woman that was in her place. And like,
[1:08:47] and we've had we've had I mean, we've
[1:08:50] had so many self-help books. We've had
[1:08:52] so many marriage books. We've had so
[1:08:55] many feminist uh um meetings and all
[1:08:58] these things and no people have been
[1:09:01] saved, but this little woman with the
[1:09:03] Holy Ghost that was living the position
[1:09:06] that God gave her was able to lead her
[1:09:08] husband and these other people saved to
[1:09:11] Christ. And so her husband probably
[1:09:13] didn't start off start out that way, but
[1:09:16] brother Jack said when you catch the
[1:09:18] devil stealing from you, right, he's got
[1:09:20] to return back double. So, not only did
[1:09:23] she get her husband back, but she saved
[1:09:25] a lot of other people, too, in her
[1:09:27] position, right?
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; God's got a double blessing for everyone
[1:09:31] that is in their position.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; And finally, we'll go over just in in
[1:09:36] closing in a little bit, we'll we'll go
[1:09:38] over uh the children, right? Because the
[1:09:41] children uh children was in the uh the
[1:09:43] little circle of that. And of course, we
[1:09:45] know the Bible says to obey your obey
[1:09:47] your uh obey your parents. You know, you
[1:09:49] got some of these youth out here that,
[1:09:51] you know, they'll say that, you know,
[1:09:52] the message is a cage. Or they'll say
[1:09:54] like, you know, living under their
[1:09:56] father, it feels like you're in a cage.
[1:09:58] It's nonsense. Like, you just don't know
[1:10:00] what you're saying. You don't know what
[1:10:02] you're talking about. You don't know
[1:10:03] what is being uh um you don't know what
[1:10:05] you're being um protected from, you
[1:10:08] know. And I like to think about the the
[1:10:10] the the story of the prodical son, you
[1:10:12] know. It's like can you imagine living
[1:10:14] in a mansion and you just upset, you
[1:10:17] know? You got servants coming to you.
[1:10:19] It's like you you got the prodical son
[1:10:20] probably on his bed. Man, dad is just
[1:10:22] hard, man. He's just he got all these
[1:10:24] rules. And servant coming in here
[1:10:26] saying, "Hey, you want the uh Egyptian
[1:10:28] cotton uh night robe, the purple or the
[1:10:30] red one? I'll take the purple one." And
[1:10:32] he's coming back, man. All these all
[1:10:34] these, you know, rules in the house. And
[1:10:36] the servant come says, "Hey, you want a
[1:10:37] blueberry scone or or a strawberry
[1:10:39] scone? I'll take the strawberry one."
[1:10:41] And it's like, what do you mean you
[1:10:42] locked up? I mean, you you eating better
[1:10:44] and living better than a lot of people
[1:10:46] in the world, right? So, it's it it it's
[1:10:49] it just goes to show you how, you know,
[1:10:51] he went from living in that situation
[1:10:53] all the way down to a pig pin, right?
[1:10:56] And so, you know, you're um parents
[1:11:00] don't don't stop li don't stop teaching
[1:11:02] the message, right? Just because your
[1:11:04] kids, you know, are are are
[1:11:07] trying to, you know, challenge your
[1:11:09] authority. Every leadership comes with
[1:11:11] challenge, but you have to stay strong
[1:11:13] on the word, right? And uh and and your
[1:11:15] kids will thank you for it later in
[1:11:17] life. A lot of times parents want to be
[1:11:19] best friends with kids, but you're
[1:11:21] looking further beyond that, right? The
[1:11:24] same way Christ looks at us, he just he
[1:11:25] just doesn't want to bless us right now
[1:11:27] while we're in sin. He's looking further
[1:11:28] beyond that. He's looking for when we'll
[1:11:30] be re be reunited uh uh in eternity. You
[1:11:33] see what I'm saying? Uh so
[1:11:36] you know and uh uh you know so you young
[1:11:39] ones you know your parents are trying to
[1:11:41] teach you to be parents right they're
[1:11:44] trying to teach you leadership skills.
[1:11:45] They're trying to teach you how to uh
[1:11:47] how to grow up and be responsible kids.
[1:11:49] And that's why that's why they're uh
[1:11:51] they're they're they're doing these
[1:11:53] things like this. But a lot of kids want
[1:11:54] an accelerated growth. They want to grow
[1:11:56] up fast. They want to get to the they
[1:11:58] want to get to a fast. I used to have a
[1:11:59] mentor that said heavy is the head that
[1:12:02] wears the crown. Meaning that when you
[1:12:04] come in a leadership role and that crown
[1:12:06] comes on, it feels good for the first 10
[1:12:08] minutes, but then the next day you're
[1:12:10] like, man, this thing is getting a
[1:12:11] little bit heavy. Uh, and the thing is
[1:12:13] you can't take it off, right? So, if you
[1:12:15] grow up too fast, you know, so, you
[1:12:18] know, so you have to be careful about
[1:12:20] certain things you do in life. You know,
[1:12:22] if you go out there and you get a kid,
[1:12:24] you know, you can't just reverse that
[1:12:26] thing back. You're stuck. You know what
[1:12:28] I'm saying? And the thing about it is
[1:12:30] it's a it's it's a bittersweetness
[1:12:32] because you love the kid, right? You
[1:12:35] love them, but you're not ready to take
[1:12:37] care of them. So now you'll see all your
[1:12:39] friends moving along, having success in
[1:12:41] life, and you're just kind of taking
[1:12:43] care of your kid, and you want to love
[1:12:44] them, but you still want to have those
[1:12:46] opportunities. Like, don't do that to
[1:12:48] yourself. Just wait until your parents
[1:12:50] have taught you everything that you
[1:12:52] need. Right? When you want to when you
[1:12:54] want someone to come to your house, take
[1:12:56] them through that structure. Let them
[1:12:58] come through Christ. If they come
[1:12:59] through Christ, that's really, really
[1:13:01] good. They're a Christian. But don't
[1:13:03] stop there. Take them through the
[1:13:04] prophet. Do they believe what the
[1:13:06] prophet says? They might just be saved,
[1:13:08] but you don't want someone just saved.
[1:13:09] You want someone that believes the
[1:13:11] message just like you believe the
[1:13:12] message, right? Take them to the
[1:13:13] five-fold ministry, the pastor, see what
[1:13:15] he got to say about it, right? Then take
[1:13:17] them to the parents, and if they checks
[1:13:19] through, then you're safe. You know that
[1:13:20] you have uh something safe. Don't try to
[1:13:23] make these decisions uh uh on your own,
[1:13:26] right?
[1:13:27] Don't try to make the decisions on your
[1:13:28] own. And parents have a responsibility.
[1:13:30] God's trusting you to raise these kids.
[1:13:33] Right? Um Proverbs 26 says, "Train a
[1:13:36] child in a way that it should go and it
[1:13:38] will not depart from it." Right? Uh so
[1:13:40] train means don't just tell them what to
[1:13:42] do. Nah, you need to train them. You
[1:13:44] need to n you got to read your Bible.
[1:13:45] You got to wake up every morning and
[1:13:47] read your Bible. You got to go to Sunday
[1:13:48] school. Right? Sunday school lessons,
[1:13:50] you need to be doing your Sunday school
[1:13:51] lessons. You got to train these kids how
[1:13:53] to do No, you need to dress up. We going
[1:13:55] to church and you need to dress up. why
[1:13:56] they in your household, right, under
[1:13:58] your control. They got to follow your
[1:14:00] rules,
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; right? They have to follow your rules.
[1:14:03] And that's training them. So when they
[1:14:05] get older, then they'll know. And the
[1:14:06] key thing, the Bible says, train a
[1:14:08] child, not a teenager, not a young
[1:14:11] adult. So God's promise has a time
[1:14:13] limit. You ain't got a lot of time to
[1:14:14] keep that.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; You got to make sure you're on it just
[1:14:17] like that. So God can keep his end of
[1:14:19] the bargain,
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; you know. So it's uh um so yeah train
[1:14:23] train your kids uh and children respect
[1:14:26] your parents you know you're in a
[1:14:28] helpless position right you're in a very
[1:14:30] very helpless position you don't got
[1:14:32] your you know you don't have your own
[1:14:33] clothes you don't you don't got your own
[1:14:35] food that's not your that's not your
[1:14:36] food that's not your house you know
[1:14:38] that's not your clothes your parents
[1:14:39] provided these things for you right if
[1:14:42] you didn't have them you'd be struggling
[1:14:44] if you go if you could go and talk to
[1:14:45] some of these kids that are growing up
[1:14:46] in uh orphanages their life rough right
[1:14:50] that life is rough tough that ain't easy
[1:14:51] being passed from home to home and and
[1:14:53] and and the hope of you know someone
[1:14:56] coming and adopting you and taking care
[1:14:57] of you. Someone comes and then it
[1:14:59] doesn't work out and then you get old
[1:15:01] and they just throw you out there. It's
[1:15:02] rough out there. You know, appreciate
[1:15:04] your parents that are sacrificing uh to
[1:15:07] give these things. So uh in closing, you
[1:15:09] know, the prophet had made a statement.
[1:15:12] He said that God does not need us,
[1:15:15] right? But we need him, right? So God um
[1:15:19] and God didn't need the God don't need
[1:15:22] the prophets. He want to use them. When
[1:15:23] Moses smashed that rock two times, God
[1:15:26] said, "You ain't going in the promised
[1:15:27] land." Right? I'mma I'mma let uh Joshua
[1:15:30] go and lead these people. Right? So
[1:15:32] don't your your your position don't
[1:15:34] think that you can't be you're not
[1:15:36] replaceable. Right? And uh uh major the
[1:15:38] major prophets, they don't need the
[1:15:40] five-fold ministry. There was a time
[1:15:42] when the king was saying, "Hey, I got
[1:15:44] 500 uh ministers here that said we can
[1:15:47] go and take the land." And there was
[1:15:48] this one prophet that came in there and
[1:15:50] said, "Hey, if you if you come back
[1:15:52] successful, you can call me a false
[1:15:53] prophet." Right? One prophet against the
[1:15:55] whole entire ministers. And his word was
[1:15:58] right. Right? The prophets don't need
[1:16:00] the five-fold ministry. Five-fold
[1:16:02] ministry uh doesn't really need the
[1:16:04] congregation. Right? You know, I I'll be
[1:16:06] fine teaching to a rock in my backyard.
[1:16:08] I'll put a smiley face on this smiley
[1:16:10] face on a rock and just start teaching
[1:16:12] it from Genesis all the way to
[1:16:13] Revelation, right? Um, you know, we the
[1:16:17] congregation needs the five-fold
[1:16:18] ministry to be successful. You know, men
[1:16:21] don't need women. The Bible says it is
[1:16:23] better for a man to live alone in the
[1:16:25] corner than with a brawling and
[1:16:26] contentious woman, right? So, a woman
[1:16:29] needs a man and and children, your
[1:16:31] parents don't need you. God blessed them
[1:16:32] before you came and they'll be blessed
[1:16:34] after you leave. Right? So God doesn't
[1:16:38] the these are these are God has these
[1:16:40] structures in place but the thing about
[1:16:42] it is God wants to use you right God
[1:16:44] wants to uh a relationship with you God
[1:16:47] wants you know your ch your uh parents
[1:16:50] they want your kid the kids in their
[1:16:52] life but we you got to follow right you
[1:16:54] got to follow the instruction you have
[1:16:55] to follow uh the leading right and so in
[1:16:58] closing you know um we've gone through
[1:17:00] this journey of positioning uh and just
[1:17:03] to kind of type it to a um to a diamond
[1:17:05] If you've ever seen the way that, you
[1:17:07] know, sometimes they cut diamonds when
[1:17:09] you turn it upside down, you know, uh
[1:17:11] it's it shows as a pyramid, right? And
[1:17:14] that's go that that kind of goes back to
[1:17:16] how God wants us to be a pyramid, right?
[1:17:18] Just shining, no shadows, right? That he
[1:17:20] can see his own reflection uh inside of
[1:17:23] us, right? So, it's important for us to
[1:17:25] make sure that we're in position. And
[1:17:26] when we've gone through all of these
[1:17:28] stages, we've gone through the ups and
[1:17:29] down. God's not rapturing coal, right?
[1:17:32] God wants to rapture diamonds that have
[1:17:34] been pressure pressurized and tested and
[1:17:37] he can see his own reflection inside of
[1:17:38] it. Right? So that's why God, you know,
[1:17:42] tells us these things to to help us to
[1:17:44] uh uh stay in order and also it's to
[1:17:46] keep our families blessed, right? So the
[1:17:48] children are dependent upon the parents.
[1:17:50] The wife is dependent upon the husband,
[1:17:52] right? The congregation is dependent
[1:17:54] upon the ministry. The fatherful
[1:17:56] ministry is dependent upon the major
[1:17:57] prophet and the major prophet is
[1:17:59] dependent upon the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:18:01] God bless you all. and we're going to um
[1:18:04] we'll end this in a in a word of prayer.
[1:18:08] Lord God, we thank you for your word, oh
[1:18:10] Lord God, and these nuggets that you've
[1:18:13] given us, oh Lord God, this revelation
[1:18:15] that you've given us, oh Lord God, in
[1:18:18] the day and age that we're living in, we
[1:18:19] can see the world is headed into the
[1:18:22] opposite direction. meaning that there
[1:18:24] are children out there that are
[1:18:25] suffering because the parents aren't in
[1:18:28] place in their own households, oh Lord
[1:18:30] God, and they're suffering under that
[1:18:31] thing. But Lord, because of your grace
[1:18:34] and mercy, oh Lord God, in this day and
[1:18:36] age, as brother Gwyn said, where it's
[1:18:38] complete darkness, oh Lord God, there is
[1:18:40] light, oh God. And that light is right
[1:18:43] here in West Palm Beach on a Wednesday
[1:18:45] night. Right, Lord? You've come to visit
[1:18:47] us, oh Lord God, and given us this
[1:18:49] light, oh Lord God, so that we can shine
[1:18:51] in the darkness. We can see the enemy
[1:18:53] and what he tries to do and how he tries
[1:18:56] to break families, oh Lord, but you've
[1:18:58] given us the weapon, oh Lord, to not
[1:19:00] only defeat him, oh Lord, but to keep
[1:19:02] our families blessed, oh Lord God. Lord,
[1:19:04] you want to bless our households. You
[1:19:06] want to you want to extend our
[1:19:07] boundaries, oh Lord God, you want to
[1:19:09] bless us abundantly and keep us healthy,
[1:19:11] oh Lord God. Lord, help us to to to to
[1:19:14] take these principles that we've
[1:19:16] learned, oh Lord, to heart, oh Lord God,
[1:19:17] so that we can continue to glorify you
[1:19:19] and you can continue to glorify us, oh
[1:19:21] Lord God. Lord, you the prophet said
[1:19:24] that you're looking for someone that
[1:19:25] when you bless them, they get lower. And
[1:19:27] when they get lower, you can bless them
[1:19:29] with more and they just go lower. And
[1:19:31] then you can bless them with more, they
[1:19:32] can just go low. The more you give to
[1:19:34] them, the lower they get, oh Lord Jesus
[1:19:36] Christ. Let that be our testimony today,
[1:19:39] oh Lord God, that we pleased you, oh
[1:19:41] Lord God, and that we're a people that
[1:19:43] are preparing for the rapture, Lord, and
[1:19:45] your return in the precious name of
[1:19:47] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:19:52] [Applause]
[1:19:59] Thank the Lord for uh the word uh on
[1:20:03] tonight. Certainly appreciate uh brother
[1:20:05] Quinton and uh boy, he put some
[1:20:08] pressure. My wife said amen real loud
[1:20:11] about that Mercedes. I said, "My God, my
[1:20:14] God, bro, this man got to get married.
[1:20:20] My lord, he'll be under the pressure
[1:20:22] then."
[1:20:23] But we sure thank God for them. We
[1:20:25] really really appreciate. Amen. The
[1:20:28] Lord. Let me get uh tonight's um uh

[1:22:23] Oh, God bless you, church. Um, I don't
[1:22:26] know if you remember, I want to say
[1:22:29] maybe 3 months ago, um, I asked for
[1:22:31] prayer for one of my customers. Her her
[1:22:34] name is Felicia. Um, she had cancer.
[1:22:37] Um, I spoke with her today. Um, she said
[1:22:40] that she's going for a final checkup
[1:22:42] just for them to make sure she all in
[1:22:44] all clear. She has been healed.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:48] Amen. So, Amen. I talked to her and she
[1:22:52] was like, "Yeah, I got one more
[1:22:53] checkup." And I was like, "It's already
[1:22:55] done."
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; I just I was so happy. I just was like,
[1:22:58] "Man, I can't wait to tell my church
[1:22:59] that, man, just prayers are real. God is
[1:23:03] real. Just we we need it. God need it."
[1:23:06] And Amen.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank God
[1:23:10] for proving himself once again. Amen.
[1:23:15] Praise the Lord. Anybody else want to
[1:23:16] share uh tonight?
[1:23:20] All right. Okay. All right. Come on up,
[1:23:23] brother. Amen.
[1:23:32] It's okay. He might want to share, too.
[1:23:35] So,
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; I guess I'll share.
[1:23:48] Well, um, when Joshua and Caleb went
[1:23:54] to check out what was going on over
[1:23:56] there, they came back with a report.
[1:23:57] Right.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; I'm here to give a report.
[1:24:01] I'm pretty sure there was quite a few
[1:24:03] here that one night that I got up here
[1:24:06] and I let you guys know that we had a
[1:24:08] little situation with the computer,
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Um,
[1:24:13] this this is this is big for me.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; This is big for me because uh
[1:24:19] if they were writing a Bible,
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; they would have been writing about this
[1:24:24] right now. All right.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Because this is a a miracle what
[1:24:27] happened.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. Uh we just had a preacher
[1:24:30] over here that was uh uh testifying
[1:24:32] about something that happened in the
[1:24:34] time when brother Brandham was around
[1:24:36] with that lady and all the all these
[1:24:38] things that he's preaching about,
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; you know, are miracles that God is
[1:24:42] doing.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; And brother Jack preach uh uh uh prayed
[1:24:48] and he said that um Peter when he was he
[1:24:52] was talking about it, he he said that
[1:24:54] when Peter walked in the water, he
[1:24:56] didn't even get wet,
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; right? And he said, "Let that water
[1:25:00] don't even touch this computer."
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Correct. When I got to the house, the
[1:25:04] computer had been wet for about an hour
[1:25:06] and a half and she had it upside down.
[1:25:07] And I got there and I hit it with the
[1:25:09] with the
[1:25:11] um with the air with the with like a air
[1:25:13] compressor
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; and water was pouring out. I got Linda
[1:25:16] was standing next to me, so she's a
[1:25:18] witness of that.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; And that computer got not wet, it got
[1:25:21] soaked.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; I took it over there. uh with those
[1:25:25] computers when they get wet and they
[1:25:27] open them, you couldn't tell them that
[1:25:28] it didn't get wet, they have some seals
[1:25:30] that they change color and they know
[1:25:33] that they got wet,
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; When I took it over there, the guy that
[1:25:35] that um that I was taking it to, I had
[1:25:38] told him what happened. He said, "Since
[1:25:40] it's through the insurance, just bring
[1:25:41] it in and and tell him that it's not
[1:25:44] turning on," which it wasn't turning on.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "We'll figure out what it is.
[1:25:48] If it's soaking and wet, then we'll tell
[1:25:49] you what it is." But so I took it over
[1:25:51] there. I gave them the computer's not
[1:25:52] turning on. They said they couldn't
[1:25:54] figure out what was going on. They had
[1:25:55] to send it to the um like to the the the
[1:25:58] shop where where the warranty shop and
[1:26:01] they sent it over there. Nobody would
[1:26:03] talk to me. They wouldn't tell me
[1:26:05] anything. They said they're working on
[1:26:06] the computer. Then like four days later,
[1:26:10] I get an email from UPS, a delivery at
[1:26:14] the house. The computer's at the house
[1:26:17] and I'm like I'm like, "Okay." I was
[1:26:20] happy that the computer was back and the
[1:26:22] computer was
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; turning on and all the data was there
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; and I'm like, "No, no, no. I I got to
[1:26:27] check this." So, I called back. I talked
[1:26:29] to this guy to and I said, "What
[1:26:30] happened to the computer? What did you
[1:26:31] guys do? There's nothing wrong with the
[1:26:33] computer. We just changed the battery."
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; So, I I don't know, but but when Jack
[1:26:43] when brother Jack prayed, he said that
[1:26:45] the water wasn't gonna it wasn't going
[1:26:47] to touch the computer. And that's
[1:26:48] exactly what happened.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; The water did not touch the computer.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; They changed the battery and the
[1:26:54] computer, we got the computer back and
[1:26:56] nothing was lost. All the data and we
[1:26:58] got everything back.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; That's the first one. That's the first
[1:27:02] one.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; The second thing um
[1:27:07] when uh I I just I went we I went away
[1:27:11] for the weekend and to the men meeting
[1:27:14] and we had a wonderful time over there.
[1:27:16] And when I came back, the the devil has
[1:27:19] been trying to take me out. And and when
[1:27:21] I'm telling you guys he's trying to take
[1:27:23] me out, he's been trying to take you
[1:27:25] out. And that's what I'm going to
[1:27:26] testify about.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Um on Monday morning when I woke up,
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; um I was putting in some we were going
[1:27:33] to the bar and I was putting some
[1:27:34] shaving in the back of the truck and I
[1:27:37] like the second bag that I lifted up,
[1:27:40] I something happened to my back. I mean,
[1:27:42] I'm I'm I'm literally I've been my back
[1:27:45] went out and I couldn't move my arms. I
[1:27:47] couldn't walk. I couldn't So, I drove
[1:27:49] from there straight to the to the
[1:27:51] chiropractor and they they did some
[1:27:54] stuff and and but I still couldn't I
[1:27:57] couldn't I couldn't move. I couldn't
[1:27:59] walk. I couldn't drive. Um so, I went I
[1:28:02] worked that day, pushed through it. Um,
[1:28:04] and then Tuesday I went to the doctor to
[1:28:07] the chiropractor again and then I went
[1:28:09] again today and it's getting a little
[1:28:11] better, but um I had I think Abby was
[1:28:14] with me and I had Abby uh pray for me
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; and um I lay my hands on my own self. I
[1:28:20] didn't even pray. It says lay your hands
[1:28:21] on the sick and they shall recover. So I
[1:28:23] can't tell you that I prayed. So, um I I
[1:28:26] I I I
[1:28:28] that happened and and and and till today
[1:28:31] I'm just now getting better, but my back
[1:28:33] something happened to my back, you know.
[1:28:35] Um and um and then on Tuesday, we're
[1:28:38] driving, we're coming back from Jupiter
[1:28:41] and
[1:28:43] driving down this this back road and
[1:28:46] there's like a curve coming. I don't
[1:28:47] know what happened to me. I kind of doze
[1:28:49] off
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; and it was a big curve like that and I
[1:28:54] literally if I would if it would have
[1:28:55] been one second later when I opened my
[1:28:58] eyes the truck was going
[1:29:01] towards four vehicles that were turning
[1:29:03] like that and they all swerved and went
[1:29:05] to the side. Nobody nothing happened to
[1:29:07] anybody. And I woke up and I swerved the
[1:29:09] the truck and the trailer like swerve to
[1:29:12] the side and I just back in the road.
[1:29:13] But if it it would have been one more
[1:29:16] second with my eyes closed. I don't
[1:29:18] know. I wasn't even sleeping. Just
[1:29:19] closed. So, he's been trying to take me
[1:29:21] out and I I was talking to somebody and
[1:29:25] and they were asking me um you know,
[1:29:27] how's everything? And and my answer was
[1:29:31] just like the the I was listening to a
[1:29:33] message and brother Brandon was talking
[1:29:35] about the uh um uh the shammite woman
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; and and like when when when when Elijah
[1:29:44] was uh uh saw her, he was like, "Oh, oh,
[1:29:47] there something's wrong with the woman,
[1:29:48] you know,
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; and and but I but the Lord hasn't told
[1:29:51] me what's wrong what's wrong with her."
[1:29:54] And then she came up to him and she was
[1:29:55] like, "H how you how you doing?" you
[1:29:58] know, how are you? And she was like,
[1:29:59] "All is well."
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; That was her answer. All is well. But
[1:30:02] yet her her
[1:30:04] uh kid was dead. The the husband was uh
[1:30:08] uh sick or something like that. Uh or
[1:30:10] crazy. He was like insane or something
[1:30:12] like that. And her answer was all as
[1:30:14] well. I had some brothers call me, hey,
[1:30:16] how's how's everything? All my back is
[1:30:19] broke. I almost crashed. Like I got a
[1:30:22] couple other things that that are
[1:30:24] happening. And I was like,
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; all is well.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:28] all this was, you know, so I just wanted
[1:30:30] to testify about that and and just to
[1:30:33] stay encouraged and you guys just uh uh
[1:30:36] keep on testifying these things that
[1:30:37] happened to us. I I couldn't wait to get
[1:30:40] here and testify because these are the
[1:30:42] things that are real that are happening
[1:30:44] and and and and we give all the glory to
[1:30:47] God.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; But give props to ourselves because if
[1:30:50] we're not standing
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; the way God tells us to stand, he cannot
[1:30:55] perform these miracles in our life. If
[1:30:56] we would have been like, "Oh, the
[1:30:57] computer's done. It's over. I mean, it's
[1:30:59] wet. I mean, computer get wet." No, no.
[1:31:01] I I don't care if the computer's wet. I
[1:31:03] believe that prayer that was said that
[1:31:04] the water wasn't the water. There was
[1:31:07] water all over that. That thing was
[1:31:09] soaked.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; No water damage.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:17] Certainly thank the Lord for
[1:31:20] uh just honoring his word and honoring
[1:31:22] prayer. Amen. on on their behalf and
[1:31:25] also watching over uh brother Jose.

[1:32:06] in the weather like since the beginning
[1:32:10] of the year. It was like really uh windy
[1:32:13] and um like just cool. And
[1:32:17] I was walking inside from feeding uh our
[1:32:20] dog and I was singing Holy Forever.
[1:32:24] And as I was singing it, I kind of like
[1:32:26] stopped on the porch. And I was like and
[1:32:29] I was and I was watching the trees like
[1:32:31] as they were moving and I just kept
[1:32:33] singing the song and it was like kind of
[1:32:36] like the wind and the trees were like
[1:32:39] singing with me
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; and I was I was like thinking about it
[1:32:44] and and like every time I would like
[1:32:45] slow down in the song the trees and the
[1:32:47] wind would like slow down and I was like
[1:32:50] wow that's actually like amazing and
[1:32:52] like seeing God like be there you know
[1:32:56] like as I'm just singing a song, walking
[1:32:58] inside, you know, just seeing God
[1:33:00] revealing himself right there.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.

[1:33:10] Appreciate that. Anybody else want to

[1:33:16] All right. Thank the Lord.
[1:33:18] Amen.
[1:33:27] God bless you. I don't like coming up
[1:33:29] here. Um, I did want to say a little
[1:33:33] testimony. So, I've been having a neck
[1:33:37] pain or shoulder pain. I don't even know
[1:33:39] where it is. Lower upper back. And for
[1:33:43] like ever since I started riding horses
[1:33:45] for like three years and I didn't put
[1:33:48] any thought to it. I would literally
[1:33:49] have to sometimes cry myself to sleep or
[1:33:52] like take a goodies packet or anything.
[1:33:55] I was just dealing with the pain. And
[1:33:57] then Monday when he broke his back. Um
[1:34:04] he uh went to the chiropractor and I
[1:34:07] told uh they were doing something and it
[1:34:10] just I just said it and he was like,
[1:34:12] "Sit down on the table." And I was like,
[1:34:14] "Okay."
[1:34:15] So, I laid down on the table and he's
[1:34:17] like, "Oh, yeah. What were you doing?"
[1:34:20] And I was like, "I don't know. I was
[1:34:21] just dealing with it and he was like,
[1:34:24] "This if you would have waited a couple
[1:34:26] more years, this could have turned into
[1:34:27] like arthritis." And I was like, "Oh,
[1:34:30] okay." So, he did whatever, cracked my
[1:34:33] neck and all this, whatever. I don't
[1:34:35] even I've never been to a chiropractor.
[1:34:38] So then we went Tuesday, Wednesday and I
[1:34:43] literally wasn't before I wasn't able to
[1:34:46] move my neck this way.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Now I can literally touch it with my
[1:34:49] shoulder and like do I can lift it up. I
[1:34:53] can I wasn't wouldn't be able to like
[1:34:55] sit there at the computer and type for a
[1:34:57] while and then leave my hand there. I
[1:34:59] would have to drop it down because it
[1:35:00] would hurt so much. Now I'm just like
[1:35:03] so.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; All right. God bless you.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
