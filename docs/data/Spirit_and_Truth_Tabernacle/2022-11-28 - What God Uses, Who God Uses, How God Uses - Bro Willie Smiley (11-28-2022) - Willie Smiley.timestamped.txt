[41:51] out to them and how one system is just
[41:53] healed uh instantly they're in service

[42:04] weeks but uh but nonetheless it's the

[47:32] Arizona and going with my wife and
[47:35] brother Smiley and sister smiling we're
[47:38] all going out I was uh
[47:41] reflecting on something
[47:44] that
[47:45] just in the past I remember a minister
[47:48] friend of mine
[47:50] uh we're going to some meetings and my
[47:53] wives and uh at the time you know he was
[47:57] going through something and uh but
[47:59] something happened at the meeting
[48:01] that shifted his wife and uh she has
[48:06] never been the same since that meeting
[48:09] and uh and as I began to reflect on that
[48:12] God you can do it
[48:15] again
[48:17] you can do it again and uh so I'm
[48:20] expecting to come back uh just just what
[48:23] you know I'm expecting God to do
[48:25] something like that I know that brother
[48:27] Caleb has been just really keeping his
[48:29] church under a um uh atmosphere of the
[48:33] Holy Ghost and uh you know I think
[48:36] that's very important so it it uh told
[48:39] the church they had a wonderful
[48:41] wonderful service a few months ago and
[48:43] he says he says um you know church I
[48:44] know this is a great service but God
[48:46] promised me more than this what we just
[48:48] got
[48:49] and uh and he put some pressure on me
[48:52] say brother Jack I'm expecting God to
[48:54] move
[48:55] on that Saturday night service that
[48:57] you're scheduled to speak I said brother
[48:58] that's a lot of pressure but it's not me
[49:01] it's gonna be gone
[49:04] so uh if that's what God lead in his
[49:06] heart I ain't gonna put no straws in his
[49:08] way imma just show up and do my part
[49:11] amen but I just trust God will move in a
[49:13] very special way and I ask that you
[49:15] would just really pray for us amen we're
[49:17] scheduled to speak there Saturday night
[49:19] brother smile they've been preaching on
[49:20] Friday night and um and also brother
[49:22] Smiley's scheduled to preach on Sunday
[49:24] morning uh for the Israel poll and I'll
[49:28] be speaking Wednesday night at brother
[49:30] Israel post so uh keep us in in prayers
[49:33] we travel uh going there to the West
[49:37] Coast amen uh so these are the things
[49:41] that are coming the other thing I need
[49:42] to make mention of you on last week I
[49:44] mentioned to you that uh
[49:46] Christmas Day
[49:48] the school told us that they had nobody
[49:51] that would uh
[49:54] volunteer to open up and close up for
[49:56] some Christmas Day Christmas is on a
[49:58] Sunday amen this year and uh a perfect
[50:02] time to Worship the Lord hello somebody
[50:06] a perfect time the worship of the Lord
[50:09] on Christmas day
[50:11] amen
[50:13] amen amen amen
[50:16] hey man we're gonna bring our gifts to
[50:19] the Lord
[50:20] we're gonna worship God so they wouldn't
[50:24] open up the school and said that uh
[50:27] sorry pastor
[50:29] so I just started you know praying and
[50:32] just seeing what the Lord would do and
[50:34] start calling around to a few places and
[50:36] different ones said no we're not
[50:38] available
[50:39] [Music]
[50:47] the only charging that's a hundred and
[50:49] fifty dollars for the whole time that
[50:52] we're there
[50:53] amen so we gonna be going to the
[50:55] Fairfield Inn
[50:57] which is right down the street here on
[51:00] Vista Parkway if y'all know where the
[51:01] Hampton is behind uh LongHorn Steakhouse
[51:05] uh but fairfield's a new hotel that just
[51:08] got put there and they got a room at a
[51:10] seat about 50 to 60 people and I'd say
[51:13] we can handle that amen so we're going
[51:15] to be there on Christmas Day and uh
[51:17] we're gonna have service amen right
[51:20] there at Fairfield Inn so God is good
[51:24] [Music]
[51:28] um and I got this scripted that my
[51:30] mother-in-law gave me again and gathered
[51:32] in the back but I I don't have it in
[51:34] front of me right now but I'm a it's
[51:36] something about how
[51:38] she was just encouragement not gonna
[51:40] establish us in our own place in in the
[51:44] scripture say you're gonna stop moving
[51:46] from City to city and said she said when
[51:49] the Lord showed it to us they want to
[51:51] see the city we're just going from this
[51:53] place to that place in that place
[51:55] the god gonna stop that and give us all
[51:57] our own place I say I received what he
[52:00] did it for Israel he'll do it for us
[52:04] amen he has no respect of purses how we
[52:08] thank the Lord for all things amen so uh
[52:11] I don't want to prolong the time I think
[52:15] of our giving amen uh we got cash out we
[52:19] have cell and uh uh PayPal but and
[52:24] PayPal is only for those that only got
[52:27] PayPal if you got some if you can use
[52:29] cash episodes we prefer that because
[52:31] PayPal does take fees out of God's money
[52:34] and we don't want to give PayPal God's
[52:37] money amen uh so uh uh y'all know God's
[52:43] money is as times
[52:45] both of them is money
[52:48] thousand is ten percent of your salary
[52:51] by offering is whatever you want to give
[52:56] so if you want to give God 90.
[53:01] I'm just kidding I'm not don't don't go
[53:04] with slacking in your bills and stuff
[53:06] like that because you talk about you
[53:07] gave by faith no no don't do that don't
[53:11] do that but uh often there's no limit on
[53:14] it it just it comes from a cheerful
[53:15] heart
[53:16] [Music]
[53:22] same thing for PayPal if you want to
[53:25] mail something in spirit of Tabernacle
[53:26] PO box two two two four six two West
[53:28] Palm Beach Florida 33422 and those that
[53:31] are inside the sanctuary we have a box
[53:34] in the back uh that you can put your
[53:36] offering in it's a wooden box that you
[53:39] can put your offering other thing I just
[53:40] want to make mention we have another box
[53:42] there in the back this is for our gift
[53:44] cards there are some cards there that we
[53:47] ask that when you put your gift card in
[53:49] the car just make sure you put a little
[53:50] note a little script or something it's
[53:52] for what we do for different people
[53:54] during this Christmas season we just
[53:56] give them a blessing from us to them and
[53:59] uh so just write something special to
[54:01] somebody you don't know who's going to
[54:02] get it we don't know who's going to get
[54:04] it but uh we just want to leave them
[54:06] something and and just give them the
[54:09] hope of Christ during this Christmas
[54:10] season so uh there's another box that's
[54:13] the gold box that you'll see back there
[54:15] are the cards are writing running you
[54:17] can fill it out and I'll ask that you do
[54:19] it this way if you broke give cars today
[54:20] that you want to put in a card uh and
[54:23] then put the card in the box if you have
[54:25] if you want to do that today just make
[54:27] sure let everybody kind of clear out
[54:29] first and then you can come back in and
[54:31] uh and put your uh fill out your card
[54:33] and put in the box but we'll have that
[54:34] there for the next few weeks and then
[54:36] we'll plan to be doing our Christmas
[54:39] giveaway amen as a church and uh as I
[54:43] mentioned last week if we can get our
[54:44] young people involved in it I'll let you
[54:46] know in a day that we'll do it but we
[54:48] can have our young people come out and
[54:50] volunteer just be the ones maybe handing
[54:52] out the cars and telling somebody God
[54:54] bless you invite them at church
[54:56] you know just whatever you can you know
[54:58] one of the system was telling me back
[55:00] and our day moves growing up we used to
[55:02] go out and do Christmas Carolyn
[55:04] some of y'all remember that right and we
[55:06] go out and just sing those songs of uh
[55:09] just worshiping the Lord through
[55:10] Christmas caroling that's kind of hard
[55:12] to do that uh people don't want to come
[55:15] in and saying nothing about Jesus right
[55:17] but uh but we can find some way to touch
[55:19] our community amen and this is one of
[55:22] the ways that we're going to try so God
[55:23] bless you uh I don't want to prolong the
[55:26] time we want to have a brother Smiley
[55:28] come so you all just understand amen

[1:00:56] my grace is sufficient for thee for my
[1:00:58] strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:01:01] most gladly therefore will I rather
[1:01:04] glory in my infirmities that the power
[1:01:06] of Christ May rest upon me

[1:01:33] and depending on you to see us through
[1:01:37] we trust that you give us action of the
[1:01:40] Holy Spirit the power of God to break
[1:01:43] Yokes Lord as the word go forth Lord God

[1:02:03] give you the praise the glory and the
[1:02:06] honor in Jesus name amen amen you may be
[1:02:09] seated this morning
[1:02:11] which is
[1:02:17] um I like to use as a topic this morning
[1:02:20] um what God uses who God uses and how
[1:02:25] God uses
[1:02:27] strange topic but we'll get into it and
[1:02:31] and and trust that the holy spirit will
[1:02:34] help us out this morning to uh give us
[1:02:38] something that'll that'll help us on our
[1:02:40] journey I I I had I've had this little
[1:02:44] thought on my heart uh for a couple of
[1:02:48] days couple of weeks and uh uh on
[1:02:52] weakness and and strength especially in
[1:02:55] the age that we're we're living in and
[1:02:58] uh
[1:02:59] we we was also thinking about the little
[1:03:02] message and that's where we'll pull our
[1:03:04] quotes from this morning uh perfect
[1:03:06] strength by Perfect weakness and now
[1:03:08] it's not not something that we probably
[1:03:11] haven't heard but this just the way that
[1:03:14] I I feel to go this morning and um one
[1:03:18] of the things I learned early on as as a
[1:03:21] minister something that brother Charles
[1:03:22] Page told me uh years and years ago he
[1:03:26] said uh always approach the gospel like
[1:03:29] nobody don't know anything all right and
[1:03:32] if you come come this morning uh like
[1:03:34] you know something you're probably not
[1:03:36] gonna get anything I might as well just
[1:03:38] start that all right sometimes we we
[1:03:41] feel like we we know a lot but a lot of
[1:03:44] times our actions just really shows us
[1:03:46] how much we do not know
[1:03:49] about the gospel in 30 years of ministry
[1:03:53] and I'm still learning and I'm still
[1:03:56] growing and uh we we fortunate enough to
[1:03:59] have some brother and brother Jack
[1:04:02] teaches this study on Wednesdays and
[1:04:05] some other brothers down through the
[1:04:07] week and and just listening to these
[1:04:09] Brethren they they you know just really
[1:04:12] helped me as as as a servant of God
[1:04:15] because I sharp at this iron amen and so
[1:04:19] we we need we need the ministry to to
[1:04:23] help us uh on the journey that that we
[1:04:27] own
[1:04:29] just something I want to read as I was
[1:04:31] studying
[1:04:33] to just maybe draw a little platform and
[1:04:35] I'm gonna move a little slow but I'm
[1:04:36] gonna pick up steam I may not run down
[1:04:39] the aisles this time but we'll we'll
[1:04:41] just see uh uh
[1:04:44] and this is for me and this is for all
[1:04:46] of us we must uh have a basis for our
[1:04:49] stand how many can say Amen to that it's
[1:04:54] without question we we can't just make
[1:04:58] it Church going and and church
[1:05:01] affiliations and we gotta we gotta take
[1:05:04] it further than I'm in the message
[1:05:07] right because there's a lot of people
[1:05:09] that's in the message that ain't in the
[1:05:11] message or really the message ain't in
[1:05:14] them which the message is only the word
[1:05:17] is that right we we gotta we gotta have
[1:05:20] these bases uh we're gonna always be on
[1:05:24] the fence
[1:05:25] and I believe this morning God wants to
[1:05:27] get us off of the fence
[1:05:30] and continually moving forward
[1:05:33] is that right I believe I believe this
[1:05:36] is what I believe I believe God wants us
[1:05:38] anchored God wants us stable right God
[1:05:42] wants to give us a basis for our stand
[1:05:46] if if we're coming and we're shouting
[1:05:49] and I love that we've been having some
[1:05:51] wonderful uh messages the bishop has
[1:05:54] been preaching the word of God
[1:05:57] not just joking we we do that with one
[1:06:00] another we you know that's my
[1:06:02] brother-in-law y'all and I got one in
[1:06:04] the back back there we we get together
[1:06:07] we had a real wonderful trip a couple of
[1:06:09] weeks ago I had a wonderful wonderful
[1:06:12] time and brother Jack really preached
[1:06:14] you know I like traveling with brother
[1:06:16] Jacka he spoil you
[1:06:19] so praise the lord we going on a trip
[1:06:22] next week so you know I can't help that
[1:06:26] but we we must have a basis for our
[1:06:29] state
[1:06:30] we got to understand there's a source of
[1:06:34] our strength right we we
[1:06:37] here's here's a just a real like brother
[1:06:40] Jack would say a key statement all right
[1:06:42] right we we have to be sound yes amen
[1:06:47] right amen amen uh we we must be sound
[1:06:52] and I believe in being sound
[1:06:55] this is for me too because I I go I face
[1:06:59] my challenges yeah you you know I'm I'm
[1:07:02] in a spiritual about if you're not in a
[1:07:04] spiritual battle something's wrong this
[1:07:06] morning
[1:07:07] so if the devil is not fighting you if
[1:07:10] he's not fighting your marriage if he's
[1:07:12] not biting your children if he's not
[1:07:14] fighting your home something's wrong
[1:07:17] just maybe you don't have anything right
[1:07:20] right because if you got something this
[1:07:24] morning
[1:07:25] Satan is fighting it
[1:07:27] I'm gonna say this again if you have
[1:07:30] something this morning Satan is fighting
[1:07:34] it if you're in the revealed word this
[1:07:38] morning Satan is fighting it and that's
[1:07:43] okay
[1:07:45] see we get our bit out of shape they
[1:07:47] said something about us being in the
[1:07:49] message so what
[1:07:52] so what
[1:07:55] the reveal weren't made flesh
[1:08:00] son of man Ministry they fought Jesus at
[1:08:05] every Junction
[1:08:07] so so if they find us that just shows me
[1:08:12] it's an indication that we have
[1:08:14] something is that right
[1:08:16] but it's important for us to understand
[1:08:19] what we got we gotta be we have to be
[1:08:22] sound
[1:08:23] right
[1:08:25] in our emotions and being emotional we
[1:08:28] got to be sound
[1:08:30] our instability is because of a lack of
[1:08:35] soundness in Scripture
[1:08:39] I'm gonna say that again
[1:08:42] amen our instability the reason we are
[1:08:46] not stable
[1:08:48] the reason we're on the fence
[1:08:52] the reason we got a lot of questions
[1:08:55] the reason why we can't move forward in
[1:08:59] God is because a man of of you know our
[1:09:04] our lack of soundness in Scripture
[1:09:10] right amen we we this is not the time to
[1:09:15] be be going backwards we got to be
[1:09:19] moving forward we we got to be sure
[1:09:22] about what we believe either you believe
[1:09:24] it or you don't
[1:09:27] either you either you believe a certain
[1:09:30] thing or you don't if you don't you just
[1:09:33] don't
[1:09:35] right
[1:09:36] amen but make sure if you don't it's
[1:09:40] because you could see a scripture that
[1:09:43] it don't line up not not in emotions or
[1:09:47] feelings you don't
[1:09:49] we're gonna go somewhere this morning
[1:09:51] right it can't just be any emotions and
[1:09:55] feelings and and and what somebody else
[1:09:58] said because it's got to be an
[1:10:01] individual thing an individual
[1:10:03] Revelation right because if not you're
[1:10:06] not gonna go in the rapture
[1:10:08] right and that's SS the thing gets to
[1:10:11] tighten it up on us you will not have
[1:10:15] what it takes to make it in this
[1:10:16] generation
[1:10:18] because this is what I believe I can
[1:10:20] only preach to y'all what I believe now
[1:10:22] this morning I believe that God sent
[1:10:25] William Marion Branham not to
[1:10:28] personalize himself
[1:10:30] but to give us a revelation of the word
[1:10:34] of God that will
[1:10:36] stabilize Us in the day and hour that
[1:10:39] we're living in right it was never about
[1:10:42] him as a person
[1:10:45] right it was only pointing us to Christ
[1:10:48] which is the further part of the word uh
[1:10:51] evening time light or evening time
[1:10:54] message a a light that'll ripen the
[1:10:58] fruit
[1:10:59] I'm starting to feel something now
[1:11:02] right but listen let's get this out of
[1:11:07] our mind let's let's get this one thing
[1:11:09] out of our mind the message William
[1:11:12] Branham had his part Accord to scripture
[1:11:17] now I I do believe that like brother
[1:11:20] Jack say well you know if he ain't the
[1:11:23] one to show me the man all right I I and
[1:11:25] I'm kind of with him on that
[1:11:28] right uh if he was not the one with a
[1:11:32] Ministry to turn our hearts
[1:11:34] and and to introduce because if it's the
[1:11:38] same type all right of of John the
[1:11:41] Baptist John the Baptist ministry was to
[1:11:45] forerun the coming word
[1:11:47] yeah his his ministry was to for a
[1:11:51] forerunning Ministry also
[1:11:56] am I in the book
[1:11:58] am I in the book
[1:11:59] am I in the book
[1:12:01] right so brother balance Ministry was to
[1:12:05] forerun
[1:12:06] Christ
[1:12:09] the word
[1:12:11] right glory to God so so you know we
[1:12:16] typologists all right because of the
[1:12:19] message
[1:12:21] see we can see the types
[1:12:24] but y'all oh Lord have mercy
[1:12:27] I feel like spinning around now
[1:12:31] hopefully I'm gonna get the way I want
[1:12:34] to do it this morning right this is we
[1:12:37] gotta be scripturally sound
[1:12:40] I believe that that's the approach of
[1:12:42] brother Jackson ministry that's my
[1:12:45] Approach brother Troy the Brethren is to
[1:12:48] make sure we're scripturally sound
[1:12:51] get off the fence
[1:12:55] this morning we you got to leave the
[1:12:58] fish
[1:12:59] we got we gotta if if this is your your
[1:13:02] church this has got to be your church
[1:13:06] get off the fence
[1:13:09] right
[1:13:11] yeah
[1:13:13] well this week that's my church but at
[1:13:16] the church I just don't know
[1:13:19] get up be be sure be sound I went
[1:13:23] somewhere this morning
[1:13:25] is that right I come to work
[1:13:28] is that right
[1:13:29] glory to God but but we we gotta get off
[1:13:32] the fence we we gotta be standing alone
[1:13:36] on the word
[1:13:38] standing alone individually on the word
[1:13:42] of God
[1:13:43] right not on reasoning right we can't be
[1:13:47] presuming God don't want us pursuing
[1:13:50] that was the purpose of opening the
[1:13:53] seals
[1:13:54] right so so that you know because down
[1:13:58] through the history of the church they
[1:14:00] pursue
[1:14:02] right Luther Luther had a portion of
[1:14:06] light for his day
[1:14:07] he did not have complete life
[1:14:11] Right Wesley didn't have they were just
[1:14:15] reformers
[1:14:16] this is not just this is not a a
[1:14:19] reformer's message
[1:14:21] this is the message to turn us back
[1:14:25] and to also reveal the thing that was
[1:14:28] covered up
[1:14:30] down through the history of the church
[1:14:33] we we have more understanding this
[1:14:37] morning than Luther had
[1:14:40] right but we do not throw away the the
[1:14:45] understatement
[1:14:47] Amen brother Brandon never threw away he
[1:14:49] just showed you what Luther had
[1:14:52] right
[1:14:54] he he by having a gift was able to look
[1:14:57] back down through scripture
[1:15:01] right and and see what those great men
[1:15:05] of scriptures brought to the people for
[1:15:08] their day
[1:15:11] see amen Luther because he wasn't
[1:15:15] predestined he could not do what William
[1:15:18] Branham did
[1:15:20] right is that right amen because the
[1:15:24] anointing that was on him he could only
[1:15:26] preach the gesture live by faith
[1:15:29] but y'all pray for me
[1:15:31] right that's all he could preach see he
[1:15:35] didn't even have a sanctification
[1:15:38] message because he still went to the pub
[1:15:40] and he still kind of you know
[1:15:44] yeah right right and see people are
[1:15:46] still confused because they say well you
[1:15:48] know I believe in Jesus Christ and
[1:15:51] everything yeah you just Justified
[1:15:53] though
[1:15:54] right amen you you got to keep moving
[1:15:58] into another stage
[1:16:00] you got to get your life cleaned up and
[1:16:02] then you got to get filled up and then
[1:16:04] once you get filled up then you you you
[1:16:07] just you know
[1:16:11] you're just getting right okay let me
[1:16:13] let me put my glasses on so I can see
[1:16:15] something
[1:16:18] but but but y'all y'all follow me
[1:16:21] God wants for us to be stable
[1:16:24] just just really uh uh sound things of
[1:16:28] that nature right
[1:16:30] um
[1:16:31] for me
[1:16:32] this this this little thought because I
[1:16:35] didn't know which direction I just you
[1:16:37] know knew I had some things out there
[1:16:38] and I wanted to look at it and as I
[1:16:42] started uh to studying I said okay Lord
[1:16:44] I'll just follow the path that you take
[1:16:46] me down and that's all we can do is as
[1:16:49] ministers because God is a sovereign God
[1:16:51] and God knows what we all stand in need
[1:16:54] of and and I think I think a thought
[1:16:57] like this is good for the Christian and
[1:17:00] the non-Christian because because you
[1:17:02] know especially for a younger generation
[1:17:04] not even just young I won't even say
[1:17:06] that because you you got older adults
[1:17:08] that struggling
[1:17:10] and struggling in areas where they feel
[1:17:13] uh insufficient and and weak and and and
[1:17:17] and we have this tendency and it's
[1:17:20] because we we lack soundness of
[1:17:23] scripture we we look at somebody else
[1:17:25] and then we we get into this like moping
[1:17:28] little well and and see when you know
[1:17:32] who you are
[1:17:34] when you know who you are you don't care
[1:17:36] what anybody else says or how anybody
[1:17:39] feel about you you know who you are as
[1:17:42] an individual
[1:17:44] amen right I say this don't never let
[1:17:48] nobody put you in a box
[1:17:52] right amen I refuse to be put in a box
[1:17:56] for anybody
[1:17:57] all right I am who I am you are who you
[1:18:00] are
[1:18:01] right I ain't mad at you for who you are
[1:18:04] but don't be mad at me for who I am
[1:18:06] because you don't really know me like
[1:18:08] that
[1:18:09] I don't know you like that God God God
[1:18:13] brought us here
[1:18:15] uh because we different
[1:18:18] because we could peculiar help you say
[1:18:22] it sometimes
[1:18:25] but praise the lord
[1:18:27] we we we're peculiar we're different all
[1:18:31] of them are different it's things that
[1:18:34] certain people can do that other folk
[1:18:36] can't do right you know I I hope my
[1:18:39] sister-in-law don't mind me uh uh use it
[1:18:41] as an example sister Tanya she got such
[1:18:44] a gift
[1:18:45] she can transform
[1:18:49] help me preach
[1:18:50] huh you'll be like hey there ain't no
[1:18:53] all this was up in here
[1:18:57] a 10 by 10 could come out be like God
[1:19:00] day you want to go in there and sit back
[1:19:03] on the couch and gaze and look but
[1:19:06] everybody ain't got that
[1:19:09] you'll be having purple and
[1:19:12] well somebody help me
[1:19:14] laughs
[1:19:16] okay
[1:19:17] different ones people people are gifted
[1:19:20] to do those things
[1:19:22] and others they get cross-sided
[1:19:25] you get discouraged and like man please
[1:19:28] I'm going to see that some people can do
[1:19:30] it that some of us that just got the
[1:19:32] paper to do
[1:19:34] and that's all right
[1:19:36] now I get God give you a little coins
[1:19:39] don't call up The Decorator uh I'd like
[1:19:41] for you to come and decorate a room
[1:19:44] come on now
[1:19:47] see I say this while I'm on it God
[1:19:50] places gifts in the body
[1:19:54] for a reason
[1:19:55] right and and because every gift's
[1:19:59] Supply
[1:20:02] we don't we ain't all the same y'all
[1:20:05] look I can't be I can't be nobody but me
[1:20:09] it's taking me 60 years to try to figure
[1:20:13] out who I am and be good with who I am
[1:20:22] brother cow
[1:20:24] y'all better watch out
[1:20:27] I've been I've been having myself a ball
[1:20:29] preaching on the road
[1:20:31] couldn't clean up shouting everything
[1:20:35] you know I told Lord I say Lord I need I
[1:20:37] need more power to preach
[1:20:41] just the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:44] they used to have real holy ghost power
[1:20:48] their brakes changed
[1:20:53] um
[1:20:54] I'm letting out my time getting away
[1:20:56] from me
[1:20:57] right so it sounded subscription now
[1:21:00] let's let's let's look at something here
[1:21:03] uh
[1:21:05] brother Branham he he preaching this
[1:21:06] message called uh perfect faith I mean
[1:21:10] perfect Spirit by Perfect week
[1:21:13] right and and this is the beginning
[1:21:15] quote and I don't have a number
[1:21:20] okay he says uh I I like to use this
[1:21:24] perfect Strip by Perfect week
[1:21:27] right he says if we have weakness
[1:21:31] let's watch this statement we have
[1:21:33] strength because sometimes the only
[1:21:35] thing that we major on I'm insufficient
[1:21:39] and I'm weak
[1:21:41] but we don't see where we have strength
[1:21:44] also
[1:21:45] right we we don't have the ability
[1:21:48] that's why when I was when I was
[1:21:50] thinking about this thought and as I
[1:21:52] started reading I was like Lord this is
[1:21:54] this is profound because uh you know
[1:21:57] even coming up we we could look back on
[1:22:00] our life and a lot of times all we saw
[1:22:03] was our inabilities and our weaknesses
[1:22:06] and we still do some of us like we say
[1:22:10] 50 60 years old you know we we find
[1:22:13] ourselves over here in a pity party
[1:22:15] that's the devil
[1:22:17] amen that and the devil that's all he he
[1:22:21] wants to show you
[1:22:23] he don't want this he don't he don't
[1:22:26] ever want you to see the fullness of Who
[1:22:29] You Are
[1:22:31] right amen when I can't dress like this
[1:22:35] one and I I can't talk like this one and
[1:22:38] uh
[1:22:39] don't try
[1:22:41] see
[1:22:43] just be who you are
[1:22:46] if we could get from The Young all the
[1:22:49] way to the older just be and be good
[1:22:53] with that
[1:22:56] do one of these numbers I'm good you
[1:22:59] know
[1:23:00] do us do a Steve Harvey on
[1:23:03] what what you say something
[1:23:06] I'm good with see
[1:23:09] I remember when I was young
[1:23:11] that was a part of my struggle not being
[1:23:13] good it's okay to be intellectual
[1:23:18] right
[1:23:20] listen you don't have to dumb yourself
[1:23:21] down to fit into no
[1:23:24] group of people
[1:23:27] so so so often we find young men and
[1:23:30] young women dumbing themselves down uh
[1:23:33] uh fake smiling
[1:23:36] to be able to fit in with the folk at
[1:23:39] the bus stop
[1:23:41] we do a lot of silly things we indulge
[1:23:45] in a lot of silly things because we
[1:23:47] ain't good with who we are well if you
[1:23:50] don't fit in you don't fit in that's
[1:23:52] somebody that you will be able to fit in
[1:23:55] with
[1:23:58] see if one thing about it if you believe
[1:24:02] this word you'll fit in with brother
[1:24:04] spout
[1:24:07] you ain't got to like my quirks and all
[1:24:09] of that I ain't told you you ever had to
[1:24:11] do that right but but as long as a man
[1:24:15] we got the word right
[1:24:17] right we believe the same Prophet the
[1:24:19] same word the same Jesus Christ we we're
[1:24:22] transforming ourselves into a condition
[1:24:24] that we're going to write so we good
[1:24:27] yeah we we good right okay so he says if
[1:24:32] we have weakness we have strength
[1:24:35] he says it's an unusual text
[1:24:38] Amen in a Pentecostal uh assembly
[1:24:42] right to take weakness because we always
[1:24:46] testifying how strong we are
[1:24:49] especially men
[1:24:51] I don't know women but women barely die
[1:24:56] Lord have mercy
[1:24:59] yes this thing is this thing is crazy
[1:25:03] because women are becoming more dominant
[1:25:05] than the men
[1:25:07] it shouldn't be that way
[1:25:12] it should it should not be that way but
[1:25:16] it is
[1:25:18] women wants to be the dominant figure
[1:25:21] in the church
[1:25:23] in the home
[1:25:25] should be that way that's that's a bad
[1:25:29] spirit
[1:25:31] that's a bad Spirit to be operating up
[1:25:34] under well I had to raise my children I
[1:25:37] didn't have a man
[1:25:39] you better you better get a balance
[1:25:43] you gotta have a balance
[1:25:46] right you might have had to do that
[1:25:48] don't mean that it was right but you got
[1:25:50] to find a balance
[1:25:51] oh let me leave that alone all right
[1:25:55] praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:25:58] that could see there's a position and a
[1:26:01] place a masculinity
[1:26:04] and a woman should not have a masculine
[1:26:08] that's right
[1:26:10] barely let me tell you
[1:26:15] you're gonna be talking to the hand
[1:26:18] so we got let me leave that alone Lord
[1:26:20] Jesus
[1:26:22] I gotta put my glasses on I start
[1:26:23] getting in trouble y'all to shut me down
[1:26:29] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we'll see
[1:26:32] y'all saying preach but we'll see
[1:26:35] foreign
[1:26:38] and for men we we have this thing
[1:26:44] you know we we are masculine but but
[1:26:47] that's still uh I don't say
[1:26:50] I want to phrase it right I don't have
[1:26:51] the right terminology for it but there
[1:26:54] is a place I think that we could operate
[1:26:57] in that's not so Burly and not so uh
[1:27:04] especially in my generation when we was
[1:27:06] coming up they always told us men don't
[1:27:09] cry
[1:27:10] shut up boy men don't cry
[1:27:18] you know I think it's it's good where
[1:27:20] where men can express their emotions
[1:27:25] right and not
[1:27:27] be
[1:27:29] not that
[1:27:34] something wrong
[1:27:39] y'all listen that's something wrong with
[1:27:41] that not that
[1:27:43] about that
[1:27:48] but but being sure but being sure you
[1:27:52] know of of who you are as a man
[1:27:55] not where you gotta walk around with
[1:27:58] your chest stuck out and you you you
[1:28:00] just have all of this stuff going on in
[1:28:04] your head right that that you think is
[1:28:06] you know you know we ain't nobody this
[1:28:10] ain't prison is it
[1:28:21] with this
[1:28:23] yeah
[1:28:25] yeah you know you you can you can
[1:28:27] operate you can break yourself down
[1:28:29] that's real I'm gonna say this that's
[1:28:32] real strength
[1:28:34] that's real real power that's not
[1:28:37] weakness
[1:28:39] see they used to tell us that that was
[1:28:41] weakness that's not weakness
[1:28:45] that that for a man to be able to break
[1:28:48] himself down on different levels
[1:28:51] hey that's real strip that's real power
[1:28:56] come on
[1:28:58] I know my man my kids
[1:29:02] you know you gotta just be I think
[1:29:04] everybody should know
[1:29:07] where everybody who everybody is and
[1:29:09] where everybody's staying sure
[1:29:12] I know it's a lot of confusion out here
[1:29:15] with all of this nonsense and agendas
[1:29:17] and this and that the others but
[1:29:19] but uh
[1:29:21] you know like you say we everybody wants
[1:29:24] to have this I'm stronger I'm strong
[1:29:27] black women
[1:29:29] he got so much nonsense out here let's
[1:29:33] feed people's Egos and all of that and
[1:29:37] maybe sometimes that's why women are
[1:29:39] seen
[1:29:48] come on
[1:29:49] cause you too strong
[1:29:54] can I preach
[1:29:58] I'm gonna get into trouble but I don't
[1:30:00] care I know who I am
[1:30:03] made a strong statement right years and
[1:30:06] years ago
[1:30:07] he said it's gonna hurt a little bit
[1:30:10] it's just picture just a little bit he
[1:30:12] said when a woman get out of her place
[1:30:13] out of the kitchen
[1:30:15] well praise the Lord somebody help me
[1:30:19] huh and what he said
[1:30:22] but but it's it's more behind that
[1:30:26] we just can't take that and throw that
[1:30:28] out there
[1:30:30] Society is different things there's
[1:30:32] different things has changed and you
[1:30:34] know we got Egos and we got you know the
[1:30:36] lust of the eyes too and you know
[1:30:38] everybody wanted to find a house in the
[1:30:40] back that come with a price
[1:30:42] yeah
[1:30:44] but it but it's but it has taken it has
[1:30:47] it has taken the backbone out of its
[1:30:50] place to a certain degree
[1:30:53] come on got a lot of Say Amen
[1:30:57] we we couldn't see the detriment when
[1:30:59] they sent all the men over the wall and
[1:31:02] put all the women in the workplace well
[1:31:04] who home when your children come on
[1:31:06] somebody
[1:31:07] who who dare When the Children get home
[1:31:10] my bad what and when she get home she'll
[1:31:13] feel like that this ain't no family
[1:31:17] but I can't say this I can't say this
[1:31:22] I'm grateful that God had it set up for
[1:31:26] me that with six children
[1:31:29] my wife a man was able to be there for
[1:31:33] my children
[1:31:36] right
[1:31:38] I'm grateful for that
[1:31:40] God did that I didn't do that God set
[1:31:44] that up like that because when I got
[1:31:46] married I was just like y'all
[1:31:48] right it was set up she was supposed to
[1:31:51] work I was supposed to work and and we
[1:31:55] were supposed to not have six children
[1:31:57] but well whatever
[1:32:01] but you know God had it set up where she
[1:32:04] was there she wasn't in the workplace
[1:32:08] right
[1:32:09] all right and I think too you know it's
[1:32:11] a lot it's a lot of mental battles that
[1:32:13] goes along with this is
[1:32:18] I could preach right I mean it's been a
[1:32:23] it's been it's been a detriment to
[1:32:25] society as a whole
[1:32:28] right because you got you got
[1:32:31] they're real
[1:32:33] but I'll just say yeah I'd rather put a
[1:32:35] woman in the place than to put a man
[1:32:40] huh no matter how educated he is
[1:32:44] right yeah because it it it demoralizes
[1:32:49] it breaks him down they got to come over
[1:32:52] and see my boss
[1:32:55] when she should be home when Johnny get
[1:32:58] there but praise the Lord this ain't
[1:33:00] gonna go over well
[1:33:01] yeah I ain't got no notes for that
[1:33:04] huh but it's the truth anyhow just just
[1:33:07] look at it holistically
[1:33:10] holistically
[1:33:11] right what because I I look back and I
[1:33:14] realized what made the difference in in
[1:33:17] my six but they're not perfect that's
[1:33:19] not what I'm trying to preach right but
[1:33:21] it gave her the time to instill certain
[1:33:25] things
[1:33:26] if you if you're if you were home these
[1:33:30] things change or if you are home amen uh
[1:33:34] you ought to thank God
[1:33:36] that that you you had those vital years
[1:33:39] to really uh interject Christ into the
[1:33:44] hearts of your children while you had
[1:33:46] the chance like I say things change
[1:33:51] well let me go into the next book
[1:33:55] because I'm gonna get in trouble
[1:33:57] but why he says we try to make our
[1:34:00] weaknesses excuses
[1:34:04] right now now watch the soundness of
[1:34:07] teaching
[1:34:08] see we we grow up watch this from the
[1:34:12] natural to the spiritual we grow up with
[1:34:16] no real understanding and all we see is
[1:34:19] our weaknesses our stutters
[1:34:22] people that stuff
[1:34:25] there's a lot of people that does
[1:34:26] different things is that right
[1:34:29] foreign
[1:34:31] but he said we try to make our
[1:34:33] weaknesses excuses
[1:34:35] he said we want to tell how big we are
[1:34:40] how great we are
[1:34:45] that's where we are now
[1:34:47] I'm telling you it takes real strength
[1:34:51] to stay humble
[1:34:54] the real power of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:57] go back to the choosing of a bride we
[1:35:01] got a lot of Chinese humility but not a
[1:35:03] lot of real humility
[1:35:05] we we see how how low we could bow
[1:35:10] right
[1:35:12] see amen but a real real great men make
[1:35:16] you feel special real real Great Men try
[1:35:19] to make you feel like you the man
[1:35:24] right amen we ain't hardly seeing that
[1:35:28] now things are changing see you know
[1:35:31] people might start up I'm preaching this
[1:35:34] because you see this in Ministry I
[1:35:36] thought I've been doing this for a
[1:35:37] little while now
[1:35:39] you you see people start off they they
[1:35:42] humble but once they start getting five
[1:35:44] or ten doors opening
[1:35:47] and then they get with a certain crowd
[1:35:49] of of of men
[1:35:51] right things start changing the
[1:35:54] attitudes start changing this position
[1:35:57] changes the way they walk changes
[1:36:01] right so and it should not be that way
[1:36:06] you setting yourself up for a fall when
[1:36:09] you do that but but you know it's it's
[1:36:12] hard to stay down
[1:36:16] know what he said now I'm paraphrasing
[1:36:20] it but I I can read and I can go get you
[1:36:22] the quote I don't have it but I know
[1:36:23] it's where it's at
[1:36:25] yeah see it's hard for Humanity to just
[1:36:29] you know stay humble because if we get
[1:36:33] too low we stop pulling ourselves up now
[1:36:35] that's too low
[1:36:36] right why we because we want to be
[1:36:39] something
[1:36:41] this this is where this is where we see
[1:36:44] a lot of mistake in young Ministry also
[1:36:48] all right come on
[1:36:50] we we this is this is why a lot of young
[1:36:54] ministers pull off my glasses down
[1:36:57] this is why a lot of young ministers
[1:36:59] don't go that far
[1:37:01] right
[1:37:03] because they cannot humble themselves
[1:37:07] and stay humble
[1:37:09] what now remember what my text
[1:37:12] right
[1:37:13] what God uses who God uses how God used
[1:37:19] right amen see and that's the problem
[1:37:23] you you see so much when me and brother
[1:37:26] Jack them we was coming up
[1:37:29] we just we just
[1:37:33] came up under that atmosphere you knew
[1:37:36] you had to be humble
[1:37:38] you had to be submissive you had to be
[1:37:40] respectful
[1:37:42] and you know and we didn't it didn't
[1:37:45] bother me
[1:37:47] even even As I Grew and started
[1:37:49] pastoring the church and all that I
[1:37:52] still gave homage to you know senior
[1:37:56] ministers no matter no matter how much I
[1:37:59] understood about the word and my ability
[1:38:01] to preach the word of God I still held
[1:38:06] them in high regards
[1:38:08] right as seniors you you see such a
[1:38:12] fallacy sometimes and I don't probe I I
[1:38:15] try to stay away from the things that
[1:38:17] people do but when I see things I say
[1:38:20] this hurts you know you see I saw a
[1:38:23] podcast I ain't gonna call nobody named
[1:38:25] nothing like that but I'm just gonna
[1:38:27] preach this right quick while I'm here
[1:38:29] now I I saw some young ministers and two
[1:38:33] sisters
[1:38:35] in a podcast right
[1:38:38] uh and they were going on and I I didn't
[1:38:41] look at it long
[1:38:42] I didn't want to indulge but I just I
[1:38:46] just watched the appearance of it I said
[1:38:49] first of all here's here's the first
[1:38:52] place where it's wrong
[1:38:54] the Bible says for a woman not to to to
[1:38:57] teach
[1:39:00] or to put ourselves in a place of
[1:39:04] authority over a man is that still in
[1:39:06] the Bible
[1:39:07] now unless y'all got another Bible than
[1:39:08] me
[1:39:10] huh
[1:39:11] is that right
[1:39:14] that's what the Bible said so when when
[1:39:17] you see something like this and you see
[1:39:20] the host
[1:39:21] a sister
[1:39:23] right then and there you know that that
[1:39:27] that's an error
[1:39:29] and and the information behind it ain't
[1:39:32] gonna be no good information
[1:39:34] I'm preaching now
[1:39:36] y'all may not like it but
[1:39:38] hey I'm gonna preach it
[1:39:41] right because it's writing it's writing
[1:39:44] the theme of what we're talking about
[1:39:46] this morning what God uses who God uses
[1:39:52] how God you see
[1:39:55] that that that's got to be the right
[1:39:58] approach
[1:40:01] this got to be the right approach
[1:40:03] and you say well why are you saying that
[1:40:05] be look I'm getting older brother Jack
[1:40:09] is getting older right that's got to be
[1:40:11] young men amen coming up
[1:40:14] behind us that'll be able to take the
[1:40:18] mantle
[1:40:19] you know we might get to the place where
[1:40:21] you know after some time where we might
[1:40:24] not want to preach but maybe wants to
[1:40:25] try some
[1:40:27] but let's let's look around us there's
[1:40:30] hardly no young men around the area
[1:40:35] that can take the medal they're not
[1:40:38] season enough they're not humble enough
[1:40:41] to sit down and be taught anything
[1:40:47] come on Church
[1:40:50] come on all right hey you listen to the
[1:40:53] information it's like man flesh and feel
[1:40:55] it it's intellectual religion we gonna
[1:40:58] get into that if we can all right we're
[1:41:00] probably gonna have time but right and
[1:41:03] this this is what kills young preachers
[1:41:07] right
[1:41:09] the moment the moment
[1:41:12] see can I can I preach see the first
[1:41:16] thing if the young ministers wanted to
[1:41:19] do something as young ministers they
[1:41:21] first should have gotten amen direct uh
[1:41:26] uh uh okay from the shepherd
[1:41:32] but because even brother Brown taught
[1:41:34] this he said you know what the shepherd
[1:41:37] should be at
[1:41:38] primary
[1:41:41] huh why
[1:41:43] why
[1:41:45] come on help me preach
[1:41:47] I know y'all don't shut me down y'all
[1:41:49] just told me to preach but now y'all
[1:41:51] don't want to preach with me
[1:41:54] come on help me
[1:41:58] with me
[1:42:00] huh is it too many how did he say that
[1:42:04] why
[1:42:05] because it's immaturity the devil
[1:42:10] right amen false information
[1:42:15] based upon feelings and bad experiences
[1:42:18] and things of that nature
[1:42:22] all right
[1:42:24] you may have had bad experiences in
[1:42:27] church but that's no reason Amen to to
[1:42:30] act in accordance to things that's not
[1:42:33] scripture yes people get hurt in church
[1:42:37] if you get hurt on your job if you get
[1:42:40] hurt in your home you'll get hurt at
[1:42:42] church you'll get hurt at the bus stop
[1:42:45] what's up
[1:42:51] but if you got hurt God allowed you to
[1:42:54] get hurt
[1:42:57] but God is still in the thing with you
[1:43:02] see how we try to use things as excuses
[1:43:05] I'm so hurt I'm so hurt
[1:43:09] have you ever sat back and thought that
[1:43:11] just maybe God you know what
[1:43:14] allow that thing to happen
[1:43:17] the sea what you would do now that's
[1:43:21] what brother Gene just preached y'all

[1:44:58] amen and we and I know we're weak
[1:45:02] and we we've heard it and all of that
[1:45:05] but let's not use these things as an
[1:45:08] excuse
[1:45:11] right if that was the case I would have
[1:45:14] been left

[1:45:18] still here
[1:45:21] I'm still here

[1:45:26] this ain't about nothing but the word
[1:45:28] come on Church
[1:45:30] come on we don't went through so so
[1:45:34] we supposed to be moving forward what
[1:45:36] we're supposed to be getting about to
[1:45:37] change
[1:45:38] Church some of this stuff I can't even
[1:45:40] go with I just I just ain't in agreement
[1:45:42] with a lot of things that I see not as a
[1:45:45] servant of God
[1:45:46] I understand I understand the human
[1:45:49] element but we're going to get into that
[1:45:50] in a minute if we can I know I ain't got
[1:45:53] much time right
[1:45:55] come on Church yeah I I know the fight
[1:45:58] in the human element well I've I've been
[1:46:01] I've been hurt and I've gone through
[1:46:03] something and we've been missing and
[1:46:05] they say all of it is exhausting
[1:46:07] yeah right
[1:46:10] and and we want to use all of this to
[1:46:12] make excuses
[1:46:14] and God said I'm not accepting that
[1:46:17] though
[1:46:18] let me let me just say this let's start
[1:46:21] right here
[1:46:22] God is not accepting your excuses nor my
[1:46:26] excuses he ain't accepting that nope you
[1:46:30] say why you say that because the book is
[1:46:32] open
[1:46:34] come on now
[1:46:36] come on now because the book is open we
[1:46:39] have the mind of Christ
[1:46:42] we supposed to know what God wants done
[1:46:44] with his word
[1:46:46] come on now come on preach with me
[1:46:49] somebody
[1:46:51] glory to God
[1:46:53] we we have it's not coming we have so we
[1:46:57] we're without excuse amen
[1:47:00] amen right
[1:47:01] amen amen that was a time scripturally
[1:47:04] you know where God winked that the
[1:47:08] ignorance God ain't weaken at no
[1:47:10] ignorance
[1:47:11] right amen no not because he has
[1:47:15] revealed himself
[1:47:17] right he has exposed himself to his
[1:47:20] elect so he's not weakening anymore
[1:47:24] he's trying to get us off the fence and
[1:47:26] get us in line because a lot of us is
[1:47:29] out of step and if you add a step you
[1:47:32] ain't gonna rap
[1:47:35] because because the the church might rap
[1:47:39] you going this way but you you don't
[1:47:41] went that way

[1:48:11] right
[1:48:13] amen he says uh
[1:48:15] God gave me the he said that's why God
[1:48:18] gave me this check was to get that stuff
[1:48:20] out your mind
[1:48:22] right there's little things that we do
[1:48:27] and that's what we come to church for is
[1:48:31] to find out where our false is
[1:48:35] and the things that we might better
[1:48:38] ourselves by
[1:48:42] that's really our statement Church
[1:48:45] come on Church
[1:48:46] amen we want to find out our faults and
[1:48:50] see what it takes to better ourselves
[1:48:52] right sometimes we say things it might
[1:48:56] not make you feel good
[1:48:58] I I mean this thing that be preached I
[1:49:01] just have to say
[1:49:06] huh
[1:49:08] but it's doing me some good
[1:49:11] see we like to walk around like we ain't
[1:49:14] got no faults
[1:49:16] you don't lie you didn't lie
[1:49:18] in a lot
[1:49:20] we all have them
[1:49:22] don't nobody point no fingers at nobody
[1:49:25] we all have faults
[1:49:29] come on come on we all got them
[1:49:32] I know I got them
[1:49:35] but you got them too
[1:49:38] you can't get no more smokes out of my
[1:49:40] eye when you gotta beam me yours
[1:49:43] praise the Lord
[1:49:45] well Lord help us
[1:49:49] I ain't trying to hurt y'all feelings
[1:49:51] I'm just trying to preach preach well
[1:49:54] brother Branham sought that this was a
[1:49:57] good message to preach to the church why
[1:50:00] to give us soundness
[1:50:03] of Doctrine
[1:50:05] right
[1:50:06] that's that's what brother Jack does is
[1:50:09] giving us sound
[1:50:11] series on prayer
[1:50:12] soundness of Doctrine
[1:50:15] right all the other series is to give us
[1:50:19] soundness
[1:50:20] sound teaching
[1:50:23] right
[1:50:24] we shout and that's great
[1:50:29] but it's soundness of teaching the
[1:50:32] underlying effects of the whole thing
[1:50:37] okay almost done
[1:50:40] I got 10 minutes
[1:50:42] okay give me 10.
[1:50:44] all right
[1:50:46] hey man so he said if we come to church
[1:50:48] for any other objective than this she
[1:50:51] said I'm afraid we won't get much out of
[1:50:54] coming to church
[1:50:56] we must come to find out our weaknesses
[1:50:59] find our bad places what yes
[1:51:05] to see how little we are and to put our
[1:51:09] trust in somebody that's strong but when
[1:51:12] we when we have weaknesses we have
[1:51:14] strength
[1:51:16] come on church it's not to be offenses
[1:51:19] I'm not here to be offensive
[1:51:21] but I'm I'm here to bring soundness of
[1:51:26] Doctrine
[1:51:27] right because you know and I ain't gonna
[1:51:31] know it all but I do know some things
[1:51:34] and when you see things you'll be like
[1:51:37] oh man
[1:51:39] and I don't care how long you've been
[1:51:41] preaching
[1:51:42] your brother Brandon ordained you and
[1:51:45] all that that stuff don't mean nothing
[1:51:46] about a smile I ain't even impressed by
[1:51:48] none of that stuff who you are who your
[1:51:51] pastor is and how great a man can we we
[1:51:53] didn't die I just seen all of that
[1:51:55] nonsense
[1:51:58] all right in 30 years Great Men great
[1:52:02] preachers and we dancing y'all ain't
[1:52:03] this and we this we all
[1:52:05] can't use God can't use that like that
[1:52:09] right
[1:52:10] uh not according to what brother Branham
[1:52:13] amen being a sin is teaching us here
[1:52:17] right come on yeah
[1:52:20] yeah amen because because God can't use
[1:52:22] human ability
[1:52:24] no no no no no no
[1:52:27] amen he says there are so many of us
[1:52:30] like to testify likes to think that
[1:52:32] we're insufficient
[1:52:34] right
[1:52:36] now watch this statement because we got
[1:52:39] to have something that that we're
[1:52:42] standing on something that's solid right
[1:52:45] therefore we we make that an excuse I
[1:52:49] don't have no education
[1:52:51] I'm a living witness I guess I've said
[1:52:53] that
[1:52:54] I've have no ability
[1:52:56] I remember I'm I'm able to do this
[1:53:00] and he said but if you keep that up and
[1:53:03] do that in that way keep going like that
[1:53:06] then you can't amount to anything
[1:53:10] that's right right
[1:53:11] see as great as Moses was he came
[1:53:17] man I can't speak
[1:53:20] who asked you that first of all
[1:53:23] where did that even come from I never
[1:53:26] even what did you think did you think
[1:53:28] God let him off the hook with that
[1:53:30] speak
[1:53:32] [Music]
[1:53:33] I could make you speak now
[1:53:36] I got that much ability in me okay if
[1:53:39] that's the case because your brother
[1:53:41] he'll be your voice you'll be God he'll
[1:53:44] be the problem
[1:53:46] right see this is why our excuses don't
[1:53:49] mean anything to God
[1:53:52] see
[1:53:54] if God is calling you to something
[1:53:57] God's Got Your Back
[1:53:59] God's got it worked out
[1:54:02] while he was talking about what he
[1:54:04] couldn't do God already knew what he
[1:54:06] couldn't do
[1:54:08] I remember when I when I first took the
[1:54:10] church boys to cry all the time
[1:54:13] oh Lord have mercy
[1:54:16] them brothers used to come in and boy
[1:54:19] they would tell the church uh
[1:54:23] and I would just cry
[1:54:26] oh God no what am I gonna do the church
[1:54:31] in pieces Jesus
[1:54:33] ah
[1:54:34] I said don't worry about it you got some
[1:54:37] trials coming
[1:54:39] you got some work coming you got some
[1:54:41] trials coming he's gonna strengthen you
[1:54:43] It's Gonna Get You Up see
[1:54:46] well I was crying God God already knew I
[1:54:49] place you there the ability is there to
[1:54:53] do the job but I'm gonna need I'm gonna
[1:54:56] use this to pull the
[1:55:03] Lord have mercy I felt something huh
[1:55:07] it's all right
[1:55:09] see it's it's those things that pull the
[1:55:13] ability in this y'all still ain't with
[1:55:15] me
[1:55:18] come on somebody
[1:55:23] don't those trials and everything
[1:55:27] see it was through that way I I felt I
[1:55:31] felt vulnerable and I felt I felt weak
[1:55:34] and insufficient and God said I don't
[1:55:37] want everybody's on boy you gotta try
[1:55:40] out next week
[1:55:42] huh
[1:55:44] and when it came it was the gift of God
[1:55:47] in Me yelling myself to the Holy Ghost
[1:55:51] and it was the Holy Ghost in me that
[1:55:54] rose up
[1:55:56] but folks thought that they could
[1:55:57] manipulate and and put their thumb on
[1:56:00] you because the god in me I don't know
[1:56:03] where y'all think I come from
[1:56:05] but I I ain't that guy
[1:56:08] I ain't that guy
[1:56:10] one thing I know about that young man
[1:56:11] right there he ain't that guy
[1:56:17] huh that's right
[1:56:19] see people people think they can be
[1:56:22] smart and manipulative cause a man don't
[1:56:24] say nothing you getting by with nothing
[1:56:28] come on Church it don't
[1:56:31] my parents know what I'm talking about
[1:56:33] you know you know your children so well
[1:56:35] because they they they sneaking again
[1:56:38] but you ain't getting bad or not
[1:56:40] after a while they just come in I come
[1:56:42] in a minute let me talk to you for a
[1:56:44] second
[1:56:45] and you'll be sending that dumbfounded I
[1:56:48] do that all the time I knew when that
[1:56:50] started
[1:56:52] I knew when that started
[1:56:54] I just I just wanted to give you time to
[1:56:57] see if you would straighten that out but
[1:56:58] so since you ain't gonna straighten it
[1:57:00] out I'm going straight and help you
[1:57:02] straighten that out
[1:57:03] well praise the Lord
[1:57:06] see sometimes God be watching us and say
[1:57:08] see they ain't finished ain't trying to
[1:57:10] straighten that out well I'm gonna help
[1:57:11] him straighten it out
[1:57:13] right
[1:57:15] why because God knows amen uh what he's
[1:57:19] he's using who he gonna use how he can
[1:57:23] use you
[1:57:25] right
[1:57:27] see God can't use us in any old way in
[1:57:30] your fashion
[1:57:32] see and this is this is why I made
[1:57:34] reference I got a lot to go with I'm I'm
[1:57:37] gonna give it up that's why I made
[1:57:39] reference to to Young ministers and some
[1:57:43] of the things that we see and how I I
[1:57:45] I've watched the devil uh uh
[1:57:50] help me see Wipe Out the last generation
[1:57:55] oh young ministers
[1:57:57] wipe them out
[1:58:01] wipe them out why they couldn't come
[1:58:04] subservient to leadership
[1:58:09] two or three scriptures in a quote and
[1:58:12] because maybe they Grandma's a little
[1:58:14] bit better you know the pastor don't
[1:58:17] know nothing
[1:58:21] because you got an ability because you
[1:58:24] got the ability and I'm gonna get to the
[1:58:26] crazy part about the whole thing I'm
[1:58:28] gonna say this it's the pastor the one
[1:58:31] who taught you the majority of what you
[1:58:33] even know
[1:58:40] understand how folk could put my ex
[1:58:44] preachers above me with what they knew
[1:58:47] they got it from sitting up under the
[1:58:49] Holy Ghost Ministry
[1:58:57] come on y'all real quiet
[1:59:00] they're real quiet
[1:59:05] they grew from babies sitting up under
[1:59:09] a Ministry that God built
[1:59:14] and then they supersede where how
[1:59:19] that don't make sense
[1:59:21] that stuff don't make sense
[1:59:25] young ministers under brother Jack right
[1:59:28] you know the reason why they ain't
[1:59:30] preaching today they couldn't sit still
[1:59:33] they couldn't be obedient
[1:59:36] right
[1:59:38] people spoil babies
[1:59:40] when they don't get their way
[1:59:42] I'm going over here you ain't gonna get
[1:59:44] your way over there neither
[1:59:49] I told a brother one time I didn't felt
[1:59:51] like he he would call he took her
[1:59:54] you know what makes you think if you go
[1:59:57] over there
[1:59:58] you got a minute
[2:00:00] never had one
[2:00:02] never didn't work
[2:00:04] Church
[2:00:11] huh come on Church
[2:00:13] boy I tell you I wish I had another two
[2:00:16] hours
[2:00:18] that's what it's going to take to preach
[2:00:20] what I got right here
[2:00:22] and information
[2:00:24] right over the car
[2:00:26] look at this look take a look don't be
[2:00:29] afraid
[2:00:31] oh no I want to say that I don't want to
[2:00:33] see that I want to look look open your
[2:00:35] eyes
[2:00:37] all right
[2:00:39] open your eyes
[2:00:41] the reason why the Ministries ain't
[2:00:44] productive is because they could not
[2:00:47] yield human ability they couldn't
[2:00:49] separate human ability and to give
[2:00:55] two of these people start calling their
[2:00:57] name
[2:01:01] they call it my name God
[2:01:10] humble yourself
[2:01:12] did what he gave me the preacher I'm
[2:01:13] preaching and I ain't apologizing either
[2:01:18] soundness of Doctrine
[2:01:21] we gotta build on that
[2:01:24] right we we got to get a Biblical
[2:01:27] Foundation if not you gonna wreck up
[2:01:31] with that Ministry God know that
[2:01:36] God knows that you gonna wreck up cause
[2:01:39] you're gonna get lifted up I'm telling
[2:01:41] you
[2:01:42] I'm telling you
[2:01:44] see you you know I ain't that popular
[2:01:47] because I just say what's on my heart
[2:01:51] and they don't really like brother
[2:01:52] smiling because they feel like really
[2:01:54] smile is you know listen
[2:01:58] you can kind of see why a lot of people
[2:02:00] didn't get brother Brown's Ministry
[2:02:03] right they felt like it was it wasn't
[2:02:06] that he was trying to be difficult he
[2:02:08] was constantly trying to apologize but
[2:02:10] he was just trying to bring scripture
[2:02:13] soundness
[2:02:16] right
[2:02:18] because you can never really be used of
[2:02:20] God
[2:02:21] right without being sound and Doctrine
[2:02:24] I'll I'll say this I remember when I
[2:02:27] first started preaching some of y'all
[2:02:30] probably don't even remember this I
[2:02:32] first my first one or two sermons I
[2:02:34] preached at brother West picture
[2:02:39] I remember one of them to be made over
[2:02:42] on a New Year's Eve night
[2:02:45] and and I got shot down
[2:02:48] and I was happy that I got shut down
[2:02:52] was because
[2:02:55] we were being taught one thing
[2:02:57] and I was reading another thing
[2:03:00] and I couldn't put those two things
[2:03:02] together they weren't lining up right
[2:03:05] and so in my heart I was always like
[2:03:08] Lord I got to give account I got to be
[2:03:12] responsible then if then if I have to be
[2:03:15] responsible for what I'm preaching I got
[2:03:18] to know what I'm preaching
[2:03:21] come on and at that time I didn't know
[2:03:25] what I was preaching
[2:03:27] right I was starting to try to preach
[2:03:29] little you know things on faith you know
[2:03:32] because that's what we you know we was
[2:03:34] kind of taught that way
[2:03:37] I
[2:03:38] thought Lord have mercy right we we were
[2:03:42] talking things that people would come up
[2:03:43] to you I remember I had to preaching
[2:03:45] that little message some brothers came
[2:03:47] up to me and said
[2:03:50] we need to talk to you say okay all
[2:03:54] right
[2:03:54] see
[2:03:56] brother West Coast first they told me
[2:03:58] about another Ministry
[2:04:01] they Pastor preach this and the
[2:04:04] associate preached this and so you know
[2:04:07] our pastor he preaches this and so we
[2:04:10] got to preach this and I looked at them
[2:04:11] brothers I said where y'all get that
[2:04:13] from
[2:04:15] the pastor preached Revelation and we
[2:04:18] just preached Faith where do y'all get
[2:04:20] that from first of all
[2:04:22] show me that by the Bible
[2:04:26] right
[2:04:27] that ain't scriptural that's nonsense
[2:04:33] because because this is some brothers
[2:04:35] that's evangelizing
[2:04:37] can really break into some some things
[2:04:41] under under that but they evangelists
[2:04:45] right
[2:04:46] that's it they supersede the pastor we
[2:04:50] built differently
[2:04:52] right and I think as long as we could
[2:04:55] yield our vessels to God God could
[2:04:59] inspire you
[2:05:01] we know an evangelists normally is the
[2:05:03] five brand they normally come in like
[2:05:05] brother they're coming in a couple of
[2:05:07] weeks ago
[2:05:08] you know I kind of gave y'all a little
[2:05:10] upsert but he gonna stay down there now
[2:05:13] see I'm a little older than Diggs I like
[2:05:16] to be a little bit more poised
[2:05:19] you know
[2:05:20] but he gonna definitely run that out
[2:05:22] but I'm not brother D's I'm like brother
[2:05:24] land Nichols that see them young
[2:05:27] fellas up there kicking and stopping and
[2:05:29] screaming and all that when you get up
[2:05:31] there first thing he tell you I'm not an
[2:05:33] evangelist
[2:05:34] so don't expect me to act like one
[2:05:38] we built different and and right now you
[2:05:43] know I'm doing the work of an evangelist
[2:05:46] right I I have I have experience as the
[2:05:49] past 23 years but I know brother Jack
[2:05:52] the pastor I don't try to get in this
[2:05:54] way
[2:05:55] right
[2:05:57] amen but I know my thoughts my thought
[2:06:00] pattern is not necessary evangelistical
[2:06:05] I can be a little bit evangelistical but
[2:06:08] my thoughts amen is not evangelistical
[2:06:11] type thoughts all together
[2:06:14] right
[2:06:17] amen you can never push me back down
[2:06:19] into a little box
[2:06:22] it's too much too many years and too
[2:06:25] much experience
[2:06:26] but but I have enough experience to know
[2:06:29] that you know what brother Jack is is
[2:06:32] the shepherd and there's a there's lives
[2:06:35] that you know I'm not gonna cross
[2:06:37] because I used to pass
[2:06:40] I'm not gonna cross the certain there's
[2:06:42] certain lines right whether whether I
[2:06:46] could teach them or not teach them
[2:06:47] there's certain things I will not teach
[2:06:50] in this church
[2:06:52] I ain't gonna do
[2:06:54] and I learned that as an evangelist some
[2:06:56] of those things
[2:06:58] right amen I just it's just things that
[2:07:02] you know I'm not hit around on things
[2:07:04] but there's just certain things that you
[2:07:08] know a couple of things that I just to
[2:07:10] leave brother Jack
[2:07:11] has nothing to do with ability a
[2:07:14] capability because I you know I got here
[2:07:17] I can get down into some stuff now but I
[2:07:20] I just I just I just rather him to do
[2:07:24] right because he's
[2:07:28] how many can agree
[2:07:30] birthday Pastor right
[2:07:32] okay
[2:07:33] I want everybody to be clear on who the
[2:07:35] pastor like I told y'all when I first
[2:07:37] came here that first year because that
[2:07:40] the pastor don't ask me no questions
[2:07:42] you know and we'll be fine I laugh and
[2:07:45] joke with you when I'm up here I might
[2:07:47] tell a joke but I ain't joking
[2:07:52] I might tell a joke because like y'all
[2:07:54] should get too serious for y'all you
[2:07:56] know so I have to loosen you up a little
[2:07:58] bit but I ain't joking
[2:08:01] right yeah this is part one
[2:08:04] yeah
[2:08:06] because it's it's really it's really a
[2:08:09] lot it's really a lot and we we do not
[2:08:12] want to lose another generation of
[2:08:14] preachers we do we do I'ma say this so
[2:08:17] y'all we do not want to lose another
[2:08:20] generation of preachers
[2:08:22] then I mean we gotta wait till he grow
[2:08:24] up us up I don't know if you really
[2:08:27] gonna be called by that time but we'll
[2:08:28] see
[2:08:29] I just like to call the preachers
[2:08:31] because he reminds me so much of my son
[2:08:34] that's what Justin said his whole life
[2:08:37] until he stopped playing instruments he
[2:08:39] sat right on that front bro sippy
[2:08:41] cupping off

[2:09:28] because because there's got to be a
[2:09:30] nature and a character associated

[2:11:07] and uh we just tried to be obedient uh
[2:11:11] to you to just your spirit leading
[2:11:15] the lord it's it's so much Lord God that
[2:11:20] we've been giving Lord
[2:11:23] through our seventh Angels message Lord
[2:11:26] and God
[2:11:27] which is
[2:11:30] looking at re-looking at things or to
[2:11:33] just make sure we are sound
[2:11:36] with sounding doctrine that
[2:11:42] begin to really use as you use it
[2:11:45] we have something that we could look
[2:11:47] back to
[2:11:48] and know that that we're stable that
[2:11:51] we're anchored we're just not just a
[2:11:54] group of fanatical people
[2:11:56] Corinthians Church they were still they
[2:12:00] had something but the thing was just so
[2:12:03] fanatical and out of order and you know
[2:12:06] Paul had to bring them soundness of
[2:12:09] Doctrine to settle them amen and placing
[2:12:14] order even brother Branham did it in COD
[2:12:16] taking these things and placing all
[2:12:19] these things so that we could be a sound
[2:12:22] group of people uh I mean there was
[2:12:25] times where even in the message he had
[2:12:28] to get on his own Pastor being a prophet
[2:12:31] and set him in order so that he wouldn't
[2:12:34] make a mistake with the gift in his life
[2:12:37] so Lord I Thank you I praise you oh God
[2:12:40] I appreciate this opportunity to just
[2:12:42] share this morning

[2:12:46] bless this little church Lord and just
[2:12:49] continue to lead us and guide us bless
[2:12:53] us Lord God open up that door that you'd
[2:12:55] have us to go in that we could set Our
[2:12:58] Roots Lord Lord I Thank you and I prayed
[2:13:00] for all things in Jesus name
[2:13:02] [Music]
[2:13:10] praise the Lord
[2:13:12] [Music]
[2:13:14] certainly appreciate brother smiley and
[2:13:16] today and
[2:13:19] um
[2:13:20] just the the thought of
[2:13:24] what God uses
[2:13:26] who God uses
[2:13:29] how God uses very uh
[2:13:35] and uh you know he's kind of bringing
[2:13:37] out things not and I just don't feel
[2:13:38] like he's here trying to pick on people
[2:13:40] that's that's not what that's going on
[2:13:42] it's actually trying to pick off and
[2:13:45] there was a you know a statement that
[2:13:47] brother random made out of the Statue of
[2:13:48] a perfect man
[2:13:50] um
[2:13:51] says so many of us trying to do the
[2:13:53] works of Christ before the reflection of
[2:13:55] Crisis
[2:13:56] so now there's the trouble
[2:13:59] they find those things happening you
[2:14:01] know it I know it
[2:14:03] you know it and I know it it says we see
[2:14:05] these stumbles
[2:14:07] along the road
[2:14:09] we find the scrap people Ministers of
[2:14:12] Christians and notice now he says the
[2:14:14] ministers are going to realize because
[2:14:16] what happens in the Pulpit starts
[2:14:18] affecting what's happening in the
[2:14:19] congregation and you get Scrappy of
[2:14:21] ministers and of Christians piled along
[2:14:24] the side up side of road and the reason
[2:14:27] brother random said it's like this he
[2:14:28] says because they didn't go into it
[2:14:31] right
[2:14:34] and uh you know as he was just saying
[2:14:36] you know we come from a generation where
[2:14:37] we we respected our elders
[2:14:42] we didn't always agree
[2:14:46] with our illness
[2:14:48] but we respected our elders
[2:14:51] [Music]
[2:14:53] amen
[2:14:55] and you I mean and sometimes you know
[2:14:57] you might have conversations with
[2:14:58] somebody about something that you didn't
[2:15:00] you know agree with
[2:15:02] but you have enough respect to know when
[2:15:04] to hush your mouth can I just put it
[2:15:06] that way you knew when to stop talking
[2:15:09] right because if that will get you over
[2:15:11] a little bit too far now you don't got
[2:15:13] took on a spear and you don't even know
[2:15:14] how you got it on you
[2:15:17] oftentimes you know y'all can be seated
[2:15:19] just for a moment I'm gonna change the
[2:15:21] order of the service but oftentimes
[2:15:24] um
[2:15:25] people will see that a pastor will make
[2:15:27] a decision
[2:15:28] [Music]
[2:15:32] sometimes the pastor's doing that
[2:15:34] because he has a little bit more
[2:15:35] information than what you have
[2:15:38] sometimes you only see just a little bit
[2:15:40] and you're making a decision based on a
[2:15:42] little bit that you see oftentimes you
[2:15:44] know uh I I I I'll say it like this uh
[2:15:48] I've learned in over the years is that I
[2:15:50] can come out here and just kind of crush
[2:15:52] certain things immediately
[2:15:54] but oftentimes I learned that if I crush
[2:15:56] this one person
[2:15:58] it's gonna affect this person's gonna
[2:16:00] affect this person's gonna affect this
[2:16:02] person I even lost a whole family
[2:16:04] and sometimes you just gotta let God
[2:16:06] just work things out
[2:16:08] and I appreciate sister Dixon years ago
[2:16:11] she gave me some wisdom and I will never
[2:16:13] I'll never forget it I'll never let it
[2:16:15] go she gave me that wisdom you know out
[2:16:18] of James 120 and all she did to pass I
[2:16:20] just want you to read this scripture
[2:16:22] I say okay James 1 20.
[2:16:26] the wrath of man
[2:16:28] does not work the righteousness of God
[2:16:31] I look baby
[2:16:33] [Music]
[2:16:35] and I was trying to come up with a a a a
[2:16:38] response
[2:16:40] let me uh
[2:16:42] let me come up with something no no no I
[2:16:45] had nothing to say but thank you sister
[2:16:48] thank you sister
[2:16:50] praise the Lord
[2:16:51] I learned that you know you can't do
[2:16:53] this in your own righteousness and all
[2:16:55] my brother smile said we learned some
[2:16:57] lessons over the years and and those
[2:17:00] scrap heaps that's on the side of the
[2:17:01] road
[2:17:02] the God that I served he's able to get
[2:17:04] him off the side of the road and put
[2:17:06] them back in service
[2:17:07] and I believe God can do that uh but I
[2:17:10] do I do know it's going to take some
[2:17:12] humility
[2:17:16] that prodigal son came back home
[2:17:19] and come back with no chest out
[2:17:23] like he was blessed with being out there
[2:17:26] no no no he lost every you know that's
[2:17:29] that's people trying to turn that story
[2:17:30] around you know really but you know it
[2:17:32] was one Soul save so God must have been
[2:17:35] using it
[2:17:37] I ain't gonna you on that one Soul
[2:17:39] being safe but you know you had a bad
[2:17:41] Spirit you need to repent God can use
[2:17:45] you again
[2:17:46] oh I just love the Lord
[2:17:48] what God uses
[2:17:51] who God uses
[2:17:54] how God uses
[2:17:57] keep it in the word y'all
[2:17:59] keep it in the word
[2:18:00] [Music]
[2:18:02] um I told you this morning that we had a
[2:18:05] precious brother with us
[2:18:07] uh the Lord has blessed him in his
[2:18:10] ministry
[2:18:11] to pray for sick
[2:18:14] and uh and God has heard many of his
[2:18:17] prayers people have been sick he was
[2:18:19] telling me the other night that someone
[2:18:21] that had
[2:18:22] um
[2:18:23] cancer in three places in their body
[2:18:26] and after you pray God brought healing
[2:18:30] to that person
[2:18:32] um in all three places in the body
[2:18:35] and um
[2:18:37] um
[2:18:39] I just appreciate you know just the
[2:18:41] fellowship that it did have with them
[2:18:43] because uh brother Darren just told me I
[2:18:44] used to run from this he just ran from
[2:18:46] it didn't feel like he was worthy to be
[2:18:48] able to do it but how God just uh caused
[2:18:51] him to surrender amen and now God has
[2:18:54] just really been blessing his ministry
[2:18:55] and with him being here today I I didn't
[2:18:58] know who all would be here but I knew
[2:18:59] whoever would be here God intended for
[2:19:01] this to happen and
[2:19:03] um uh brother George just tell them we
[2:19:05] had two sisters that came they were
[2:19:07] coming to visit one of the other
[2:19:08] churches over here and they weren't
[2:19:10] having service so they heard us and they
[2:19:12] came to be with us so God bless you all
[2:19:13] thank you I'm so good to have you all
[2:19:15] with us I don't thank you nearby
[2:19:17] accident or by mistake
[2:19:19] brother Darren amen I just want to
[2:19:21] change the order of service if you would
[2:19:22] just come and just kind of take the
[2:19:24] pulpit if you would just kind of share a
[2:19:26] few testimonies we will open the floor
[2:19:28] for anybody that wants to be prayed for
[2:19:31] I want to tell you something about about
[2:19:33] prayer prayer is open to any and
[2:19:35] everybody healing is open to any and
[2:19:38] everybody
[2:19:39] uh you don't have to be a Christian
[2:19:42] in order to get a healing
[2:19:45] but in order to keep your healing
[2:19:48] that's where you have to talk about
[2:19:49] becoming a Christian
[2:19:51] but right here on the spot he he could
[2:19:54] tell the testimon that God did things
[2:19:55] instantaneously to people others it
[2:19:58] might have been amen just a span of time
[2:20:00] but however God wants to use our brother
[2:20:02] we want him to just come and share from
[2:20:04] his heart and those that would want to
[2:20:07] be praying for we want to give
[2:20:08] opportunity for that this morning even
[2:20:10] if you want to stand in the gap for
[2:20:12] somebody you want to give opportunity
[2:20:13] for that God is still God
[2:20:17] he's the same yesterday today and
[2:20:19] forever brother Darren God blessed if
[2:20:21] you would come at this time

[2:24:09] right we've been married for 36 years
[2:24:11] and allow me to say after our precious
[2:24:14] Brother Willie Smiley spoke some very
[2:24:18] touchy things there bro God bless you I
[2:24:22] appreciate your man
[2:24:23] who can take the word
[2:24:26] brother there are not many people that
[2:24:29] touch on some quotes like that
[2:24:31] things are very sensitive in the layout
[2:24:33] just in church age but I'm gonna put
[2:24:36] food out there and I'm going to say in
[2:24:39] complimenting what the brother said
[2:24:41] you see behind every good man
[2:24:44] there is a good moment let's take it up
[2:24:47] a notch behind every really good man
[2:24:51] is a really good woman okay and here we
[2:24:56] go getting sensitive but I'm gonna
[2:24:57] support now
[2:24:59] that quote is a quote the prophet did
[2:25:03] say check it out in the table when a
[2:25:05] woman
[2:25:06] leaves the kitchen
[2:25:08] she is out of her position that is a
[2:25:12] quote I didn't say it
[2:25:14] brother Branham City okay now we're just
[2:25:17] gonna just bring this in a little bit
[2:25:19] and say
[2:25:20] reason why it's so important is that a
[2:25:23] woman
[2:25:24] in the home
[2:25:26] is the backbone of a Nation
[2:25:30] what a woman a wife a beloved wife can
[2:25:33] do
[2:25:34] in the home
[2:25:36] is more than even pastors
[2:25:40] deacons ministers can do from behind
[2:25:43] this desk
[2:25:45] a woman's role in the home is of
[2:25:47] Paramount importance
[2:25:50] to Future Leaders
[2:25:52] preachers
[2:25:54] pastors so don't you sisters ever
[2:25:59] underestimate your role in the home
[2:26:02] we are in laodicea it is an age of
[2:26:05] female empowerment
[2:26:07] sisters humbly I say do your very best
[2:26:10] to fight it because I we're all aware of
[2:26:13] what's going on but your role is vital
[2:26:17] I have three daughters
[2:26:19] I am aware of what it's like for young
[2:26:22] sisters to want to have a career
[2:26:26] know about all that right
[2:26:28] if you want your career and you're
[2:26:30] single have that career when you get
[2:26:33] married
[2:26:34] reconsider your position just reconsider
[2:26:37] it and say okay do I want to continue to
[2:26:39] be CEO in this if that's your aim book
[2:26:42] you do what you're gonna do but remember
[2:26:44] there's a price to pay in the family
[2:26:46] okay because you have to bring up your
[2:26:48] children Your Role is to bring those
[2:26:51] kids up to love and serve the Lord and
[2:26:52] that role is vital
[2:26:55] I'm gonna repeat that the role of a
[2:26:58] woman in the home is vital
[2:27:01] us Brothers can only do so much but
[2:27:04] honestly a woman is essentially in the
[2:27:07] home and I want to take this opportunity
[2:27:09] to ask my wife to stand up
[2:27:11] and I am going to say sister Ellen block
[2:27:14] is my beloved wife thank you
[2:27:18] for everything you have done
[2:27:21] in our home and in bringing up our
[2:27:24] children
[2:27:25] she is an example
[2:27:28] of what a woman is supposed to be
[2:27:31] so God bless you honey
[2:27:34] it's all right you know we've been
[2:27:37] blessed our Union has been blessed with
[2:27:39] four children son Daniel is 35 three

[2:31:16] we don't have time
[2:31:17] I want you to listen very carefully now
[2:31:19] to what happens
[2:31:21] listen very carefully as the French
[2:31:22] would say hey yeah listen well
[2:31:27] the inspiration that God has given me
[2:31:30] for today
[2:31:32] it's just one word
[2:31:34] and that word is now
[2:31:38] now
[2:31:40] gonna say it again
[2:31:41] now
[2:31:43] that means at the present time
[2:31:46] the present moment
[2:31:48] and it's not in the past and it's not in
[2:31:52] the future
[2:31:53] now
[2:31:55] God said to Moses I am
[2:31:58] that I am
[2:31:59] that is a now God
[2:32:01] all right he's a present time God he's
[2:32:06] not in the past
[2:32:07] is not in the future
[2:32:09] he is a now God he said in Ezekiel but I
[2:32:14] know the things that come into your mind
[2:32:16] every one of them what you're thinking
[2:32:19] right now about this random brother from
[2:32:23] the United Kingdom but it's picked that
[2:32:25] up he he knows your very thoughts right
[2:32:28] now
[2:32:29] so if you are under expectation right

[2:32:33] to receive something from God you're
[2:32:35] going to get it now
[2:32:38] I am

[2:32:44] am tired of seeing God's people
[2:32:47] suffer okay this is not an age for
[2:32:51] suffering
[2:32:52] this is your time
[2:32:55] it's now time all right and in Ezekiel

[2:35:02] I'm not gonna have time to pray for
[2:35:04] every one of you we will do we'll do a
[2:35:07] fast prayer line because that's all
[2:35:08] that's all we got

[2:35:28] no
[2:35:29] exactly where
[2:35:31] I know exactly what I've been called to
[2:35:33] do and because Satan knows about this I
[2:35:37] am fought at a big level
[2:35:40] the brother was talking about marriages
[2:35:42] yeah
[2:35:44] I'm telling you 36 years of marriage
[2:35:47] don't you ever think that it was all
[2:35:49] roses
[2:35:51] ain't roses
[2:35:54] you need to understand marriage is hard
[2:35:59] work
[2:36:00] you want to get married you better be
[2:36:02] sure you want to get married
[2:36:04] you be sure you'll be prayed up and God
[2:36:07] will lead you to the right woman but
[2:36:09] it's not a bit of roses we all have
[2:36:12] trials and tribulations and a marriage
[2:36:14] that's been there for 36 years old Satan
[2:36:17] will attack you in a big way and you'll
[2:36:20] shake you
[2:36:22] so you may think you've been married a
[2:36:25] couple years and it's all going Grand
[2:36:26] wonderful
[2:36:28] enjoy it enjoy the moment
[2:36:31] because this coming a time when a child
[2:36:33] is going to hit you
[2:36:34] may hit you real hard
[2:36:37] so
[2:36:39] God bless your marriages God bless my
[2:36:41] marriage 36 years with my wife she's a
[2:36:44] wonderful woman
[2:36:46] now the Bible says are we the sons of
[2:36:50] God now are we the daughters of God
[2:36:55] the third pool
[2:36:57] is here
[2:36:59] the third Paul is in The Ether ways it's
[2:37:02] here
[2:37:03] all right
[2:37:05] spoken word creation is in the bright
[2:37:10] spoken word creation is in you
[2:37:14] okay it's in you
[2:37:16] I want to say these few words now
[2:37:20] is the hour
[2:37:23] for the third pull power
[2:37:25] let's say it again now
[2:37:27] is the hour
[2:37:29] for the third pull power
[2:37:30] and now is the hour for spoken word
[2:37:33] creation power
[2:37:36] the time is now it is not tomorrow and
[2:37:40] it is not next week and it's not next
[2:37:43] year it's now and the bride Revival is
[2:37:48] now and just like that little police
[2:37:50] Welshman he said to the great doctors of
[2:37:54] divinity
[2:37:55] turned back College
[2:37:57] from USA interestingly
[2:38:00] they wanted to know where the Welsh
[2:38:01] Revival was at and what did he say sir
[2:38:03] you have a right I am the Welsh Revival
[2:38:07] the Welsh Revival is in me here is where
[2:38:10] it's at so I'm telling you
[2:38:13] the bride Revival is in you
[2:38:17] and when it comes to healing and
[2:38:18] deliverance now
[2:38:20] I'm gonna quote the scripture which
[2:38:22] almost every Christian Knows by heart
[2:38:25] all right and if you don't I strongly
[2:38:29] suggest you learn it by heart
[2:38:31] Isaiah 53 verse 5. but he was wounded
[2:38:36] for our transgressions he was bruised
[2:38:39] for our iniquities the chastisement of
[2:38:43] our peace was upon him and with his
[2:38:46] stripes we are healed does everyone
[2:38:49] agree that we are healed is a present
[2:38:52] tense now statement
[2:38:57] it is not in the past and it is not in
[2:39:00] the future it is now okay and it's
[2:39:04] already been done
[2:39:06] Jesus Paid the price for you on the
[2:39:08] cross of Calvary and with these Stripes
[2:39:10] you are healed
[2:39:12] it's now
[2:39:13] I've got one quote
[2:39:15] if God came down
[2:39:18] and healed me positive
[2:39:21] right up
[2:39:22] with a Merc
[2:39:24] y's brother Brandon it wouldn't it would
[2:39:27] not be as great as it would be if I can
[2:39:31] see the promise of God and take it into
[2:39:33] my heart
[2:39:35] stand it I can say Jesus is now healing
[2:39:41] for I have accepted these words it's in
[2:39:45] my heart
[2:39:46] he is now interceding for me before the
[2:39:49] father I shall be well
[2:39:53] there is what God loves
[2:39:57] stand there on his word and say it's
[2:40:00] right he's healing me now
[2:40:03] every day
[2:40:06] the prophet said now is the time to be
[2:40:09] healed no matter what is wrong with you
[2:40:14] no matter what is wrong with you
[2:40:18] I am a QBE
[2:40:21] when I preach I am preaching from
[2:40:24] experience as well I have tested these
[2:40:28] quotations that the prophet speaks about
[2:40:30] and when the prophet tells you to hold
[2:40:32] on to the word of God and testify I
[2:40:35] speak from experience God has given me
[2:40:37] Grace
[2:40:39] it is rare humbly I say it is where the
[2:40:42] representative doctor because my first
[2:40:44] protocol is the word of God
[2:40:46] and God has graciously healed over and
[2:40:51] over and over again so I am telling you
[2:40:55] that this message of the hour
[2:40:57] is true
[2:40:58] it works every time
[2:41:01] do not ever be discouraged
[2:41:04] whatever you want if it's that mansion
[2:41:08] you testify about your Mansion if it is
[2:41:12] your church
[2:41:14] you need to testify about your church as
[2:41:17] in I thank God for our new church my it

[2:42:11] and waiting we're running out of time
[2:42:14] we won't go into church ages but if we
[2:42:16] look at the number of years and this is
[2:42:18] supposed to be the shortest Church age
[2:42:19] yeah 1906 at 116 years 2022 is kind of
[2:42:24] like now is the time I want that job now

[2:42:30] a plane now
[2:42:32] it's time to get it
[2:42:34] stop waiting you got the power you got
[2:42:37] the quotes now do it so I'm going to
[2:42:39] give you one testimony I got strings of
[2:42:42] them by the grace of God I'll give you
[2:42:43] one test to me because of time
[2:42:46] and this is what happened when the
[2:42:49] ministry was manifested in my life for
[2:42:52] the very first time it happened
[2:42:53] completely unexpected
[2:42:56] all that happened is my teenage daughter
[2:42:58] the youngest one April just around about
[2:43:01] 13. just in the early team
[2:43:04] at the time April used to play netball
[2:43:10] netball everybody
[2:43:12] I want you to listen to this test
[2:43:15] because unfortunately in the message
[2:43:17] there's a lot of legalism in the message
[2:43:20] of legalism a daughter a teenage girl
[2:43:25] playing netball we all know what natural
[2:43:28] children were don't we
[2:43:32] yes
[2:43:34] remember God will deal with April who's
[2:43:38] 13. different to the way he will deal
[2:43:40] with brother Jack or myself a man I'm in
[2:43:43] my 50s this was a April's desire was for
[2:43:47] Daddy to go and watch Network hey
[2:43:50] message believer going to go watch girls
[2:43:53] playing Network
[2:43:54] ideal
[2:43:57] listen carefully I didn't want to
[2:44:01] I know about
[2:44:02] aware of the message all about it but my
[2:44:06] daughter at that time
[2:44:09] really well in a team and she said yeah
[2:44:14] okay I'm going to go watch the nip
[2:44:17] went to the network April was playing
[2:44:19] she was playing defense very good at it
[2:44:23] when April jumped up in defense to get
[2:44:27] the ball when she landed one point in
[2:44:30] the game
[2:44:31] what
[2:44:32] was over like that complete
[2:44:34] it's almost like it snaps
[2:44:37] she was done for
[2:44:40] you it was over
[2:44:41] the game was done
[2:44:43] she could not play the game anymore well
[2:44:45] this is a child of 13. it was dead yes
[2:44:47] taking the time out to come and watch
[2:44:50] so she really wanted to play Nepal watch
[2:44:54] how God works now I did I I did not go
[2:44:59] looking for this
[2:45:01] you need to understand this I didn't go
[2:45:03] looking for this
[2:45:04] they were on the netball Court my
[2:45:07] daughter April is very upset
[2:45:09] on the court in front of all those white
[2:45:12] people around me my daughter April asks
[2:45:16] me
[2:45:17] quite to my amazement
[2:45:20] Dad can you please pray for me
[2:45:26] um in a worldly environment
[2:45:28] watching Nepal
[2:45:31] come on guys legalism legalistic guys I
[2:45:34] said those guys
[2:45:36] his brother's gone
[2:45:38] gone
[2:45:42] shorts
[2:45:44] it's gone
[2:45:46] I'm on the I'm on the I'm on the nipple
[2:45:48] Court
[2:45:49] and I simply laid hands on aprils
[2:45:54] and they said Lord Jesus according to
[2:45:55] your word
[2:45:57] use it I put God in the corner now
[2:46:01] you see my
[2:46:04] you tell God today God use it
[2:46:09] they shall lay hands on the sick
[2:46:12] and they shall recover Lord God I cannot
[2:46:15] heal anyone no You Are the Healer I lay
[2:46:18] hands upon my daughter according to her
[2:46:20] faith my Jesus said according to your
[2:46:23] faith
[2:46:24] it has nothing to do with my faith
[2:46:28] according to April's Faith the desire
[2:46:31] was strong she wanted to play Nepal she
[2:46:34] wanted the daddy to watch the faith was
[2:46:36] high a laid hands upon her and all I can
[2:46:39] tell you is that this is what happened
[2:46:42] I'll demonstrate April was on the floor
[2:46:44] like that she couldn't walk I laid hands
[2:46:46] upon it she did this she got up
[2:46:49] she stood and she started walking and
[2:46:52] said Dad
[2:46:54] I'm Healed
[2:46:57] dad
[2:47:00] whoa
[2:47:01] and she continued to play in that
[2:47:03] netball tournament and that's how we
[2:47:06] give first manifested
[2:47:07] in an environment which you would never
[2:47:11] ever consider
[2:47:13] now that same Jesus is the mighty healer
[2:47:16] and he is here today
[2:47:18] and he wants to take care of you
[2:47:21] I cannot I I don't have time one time I
[2:47:25] prayed for our dog which was very sick
[2:47:27] I will not give the full Testament at
[2:47:29] some point I will in the future I laid
[2:47:32] hands upon our dog
[2:47:34] and it was as if a bolt of lightning
[2:47:36] came from my hands I honestly
[2:47:39] God healed the dog that was sick for
[2:47:43] three days it hadn't eaten at all it was
[2:47:46] fading away and dying
[2:47:49] but after I lay down on that dog
[2:47:51] it somehow started walking not only that
[2:47:54] it ran down the stairs and went and get
[2:47:56] his food and started eating and eating
[2:47:58] and God healed a dog miraculously I
[2:48:02] prayed for another man who loved his dog
[2:48:04] and God saved him three thousand British
[2:48:07] pounds in vetfield because God healed
[2:48:10] his dog
[2:48:11] I have prayed for a Hoover

[2:49:01] Powerful sharper than any Jewish sword
[2:49:03] piercing even to the divining a son of
[2:49:05] Soul and Spirit and of the joints of
[2:49:07] marrow and it is a discern of the
[2:49:09] thoughts and intents of the heart and it
