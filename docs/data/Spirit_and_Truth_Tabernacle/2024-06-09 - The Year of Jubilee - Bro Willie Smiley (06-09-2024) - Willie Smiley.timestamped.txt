[55:44] nervous this morning sometimes I feel
[55:47] like that
[55:49] so uh I've been kind of moving around a
[55:52] lot back there we just trusted God
[55:55] Leviticus chapter we're going to read a
[55:57] couple of places in the scripture we'll
[55:59] read um what Leviticus and I have you to
[56:03] be seated and then we'll read a couple
[56:05] of more places and then we'll get
[56:07] started uh Leviticus chapter 25 we want
[56:11] to start at the eth
[56:13] verse it says and thou uh shall number
[56:17] seven sabbaths of years unto
[56:19] thee I see some of us still turning you
[56:22] got to say amen amen okay and thou shalt
[56:26] number seven Sabbath of years into the
[56:29] seven time seven years and the space of
[56:32] seven sabbaths of years shall be unto
[56:35] thee of 49
[56:38] years then shalt thou cause the trumpet
[56:42] of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day
[56:46] of the seventh month in the day of
[56:48] atonement shall ye make the trumpet
[56:51] sound throughout all your land and ye
[56:55] shall Hollow follow the uh 50th year and
[56:58] Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land
[57:02] until the inhabitants thereof and it
[57:05] shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall
[57:09] uh return every man unto his possessions
[57:12] and he shall return every man into his
[57:16] family amen uh you can be seated and we
[57:19] want you to turn to Isaiah 61 I don't
[57:23] really like to have people standing too
[57:25] long
[57:26] some brothers will have you standing 30
[57:28] minutes while they read the
[57:30] scripture I just think that's a little
[57:33] bit much we want to look at a scripture
[57:35] in the book of Isaiah chapter
[57:40] 61 amen we want to read the first two
[57:43] verses it said the spirit of the Lord is
[57:45] upon me because the Lord has anointed me
[57:48] to preach the Good Tidings unto the meek
[57:51] he has sent me to bind up the
[57:53] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[57:56] captives and to open up the the prison
[58:00] to them that are bound to proclaim the
[58:03] acceptable year the Lord and the day of
[58:07] Vengeance of our God to comfort all that
[58:10] mourn and one more place uh in the Book
[58:14] of Luke chap 4 verse uh
[58:19] 18 the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[58:22] because he has anointed me to preach the
[58:24] gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[58:27] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[58:29] Deliverance to the captives and recover
[58:32] and the sight to the blind to set at
[58:34] Liberty them that are bruised to preach
[58:37] the acceptable year of the Lord amen may
[58:42] the Lord a blessing to the reading of
[58:44] his word this morning um I like to use
[58:47] as a little topic this morning um The
[58:50] Year of Jubilee or Jubilee
[58:53] year and uh just as as a uh context to
[58:58] the text is uh seeing God's Provisions
[59:02] in our present
[59:05] circumstance now y'all just kind of bear
[59:07] with me I I I approach the gospel
[59:10] probably a little bit bit different than
[59:13] uh the other brothers is just we all
[59:16] made up up different and and uh so uh
[59:20] one of the things brother Burley always
[59:22] used to say uh uh when he preached uh he
[59:26] can't be anybody else but he know how to
[59:28] be himself I struggle with just trying
[59:30] to find out who I am so don't you try to
[59:33] imitate me because you'll be a quirky
[59:35] type of a person but I I I appre I just
[59:39] appreciate you know I'm I'm I'm not very
[59:42] schooled I don't have a lot of uh uh I
[59:46] guess book education as we would say now
[59:50] I'm not ignorant I have to say that as a
[59:53] disclaimer because when you start saying
[59:56] that then people think that you know you
[59:58] don't really know what you're talking
[1:00:00] about and but it's not much you can push
[1:00:03] past me uh I may not have all of the
[1:00:06] kind of education that a lot of us might
[1:00:08] have this morning but uh just in the way
[1:00:12] that uh we I've I've learned over the
[1:00:15] years to
[1:00:17] study you know we all have our different
[1:00:20] approaches but I when God gives us
[1:00:23] something I just I'm the type of person
[1:00:26] I just like to sit and let God uh
[1:00:28] inspire me let God uh open up the
[1:00:32] scriptures to us because you know there
[1:00:35] is a veil over the
[1:00:37] scriptures where where the prophecy that
[1:00:42] uh men have eyes and can't see and ears
[1:00:46] and can't hear that's just scriptural
[1:00:48] that's that's prophecy so it's it's it's
[1:00:51] a blessing this morning to be able to
[1:00:55] see right now remember our context is
[1:00:58] seeing God's Provisions right that's a
[1:01:02] real blessing because everybody can't
[1:01:05] see and the word see translated is to
[1:01:09] understand everybody can't understand
[1:01:12] God a lot of times we we we find that uh
[1:01:16] I think I see but uh M hey what up buddy
[1:01:19] uh we we find people Miss God just in
[1:01:23] the way that God uh does
[1:01:26] things and the way that God reveals
[1:01:29] himself we we know in studying and
[1:01:31] having a prophet he lets us know that
[1:01:34] God does hides himself in in
[1:01:39] Simplicity and reveals himself the same
[1:01:42] way God does things in such a you know
[1:01:46] we prone we we're built uh in a way we
[1:01:50] you know we look for God to you know uh
[1:01:53] do things in a in a big
[1:01:56] way but God comes down and does things
[1:01:59] in such a simple way you know like the
[1:02:02] birth of of of of the king come right
[1:02:06] down Amen in the wound of a woman went
[1:02:09] to a stable and who would say that's a
[1:02:12] king we know Kings now nowadays with all
[1:02:16] the the the the pump and all of these
[1:02:19] different things that's associated with
[1:02:21] their births our King came down
[1:02:23] according to scripture and went to a
[1:02:27] manger and because of that he was
[1:02:30] rejected but that was that was
[1:02:32] God is that right but but watch this
[1:02:37] great men of that day smart men couldn't
[1:02:41] comprehend that is that right they they
[1:02:44] totally missed the Simplicity of God so
[1:02:47] amen and and you know God can do
[1:02:50] something and and it'll go right past us
[1:02:54] and we won't even know it scriptures can
[1:02:57] be fulfilled and we know that already
[1:02:59] this morning that scriptures can be
[1:03:02] fulfilled and and you know like when
[1:03:05] Jesus was on the scene and he was
[1:03:07] speaking to his disciples about John
[1:03:11] John had already come on the scene amen
[1:03:13] and fulfilled his part of the word but
[1:03:16] yet still people were still
[1:03:18] looking and then it was quickened to
[1:03:21] them you thank God for the quickening
[1:03:24] power this morning say that again you
[1:03:26] ought to thank God for the quickening
[1:03:27] power this morning because if God
[1:03:30] doesn't Quicken the revelation of the
[1:03:32] word of God to you then you'll miss
[1:03:34] totally what God is
[1:03:36] doing and sometimes you know you you
[1:03:39] listen to people and mainly critics is
[1:03:42] what I'm dealing with right uh and and
[1:03:45] how they try to uh uh disqualify the
[1:03:50] Bible and and just different things it's
[1:03:53] it's just to me I listen you know I Len
[1:03:56] and it's like it's just that people just
[1:03:58] lack uh
[1:04:00] Insight they they they miss they miss
[1:04:04] the
[1:04:05] unfolding we going somewhere this
[1:04:08] morning they miss the the the the nature
[1:04:12] and the character of of God Amen as he
[1:04:16] moves through the scripture as he
[1:04:19] unfolds himself through the scripture we
[1:04:23] we've had a sear in this hour
[1:04:26] right that's right boy that's only
[1:04:29] brother
[1:04:30] Troy let me say that again we've had a
[1:04:33] sear in this
[1:04:35] hour that was a little bit better we've
[1:04:39] had a sear in this
[1:04:41] hour all right that's a little bit
[1:04:43] better this morning y'all said y'all
[1:04:46] woke up this morning and you didn't have
[1:04:48] no
[1:04:50] doubt yeah that's a lot of doub in there
[1:04:52] that's a lot of trembling and shaking
[1:04:55] I'm not going to throw you off because
[1:04:58] to do that I'll be the wrong type of
[1:05:00] trumpeter we going somewhere this
[1:05:02] morning right the Trump the sounding of
[1:05:05] the trumpet has got to give a certain
[1:05:08] kind of
[1:05:10] sound and and and you you all have got
[1:05:13] to be taught to the
[1:05:15] sound right come on to understand what
[1:05:19] what this this sounding is all about but
[1:05:22] I'm getting ahead of myself
[1:05:25] but but you know uh we we have to always
[1:05:30] go back to and this just the way that I
[1:05:32] look at the scripture and and trying to
[1:05:36] follow God to make sure that that
[1:05:39] nothing is offbeat I I always go back to
[1:05:42] the
[1:05:44] beginning right and and this is just how
[1:05:47] the the the spirit of God works with me
[1:05:50] in studying because I'm I'm I'm I'm not
[1:05:53] I never been to a Bible school or
[1:05:55] anything things so I always have to look
[1:05:58] back to the beginning and and and
[1:06:02] research and and watch the nature and
[1:06:06] the character of God Amen as it moves
[1:06:09] through the scripture and and that gives
[1:06:12] me a peace when I'm looking at scripture
[1:06:17] when I can see the
[1:06:20] characteristics the nature the makeup
[1:06:24] the mind of God
[1:06:26] God in
[1:06:28] scripture then then then I I you know I
[1:06:31] get a little settled in the
[1:06:33] spirit
[1:06:35] right see for me it might be something
[1:06:38] different but I'm going just help us
[1:06:39] this morning all right one of the things
[1:06:43] we know and looking back in the
[1:06:46] beginning uh from the beginning it's
[1:06:49] always been the nature of God for for
[1:06:53] Humanity to be free
[1:06:57] yes God made man and man made
[1:07:02] slaves come
[1:07:05] on and I mean sometimes you know I'mma
[1:07:08] bust a bubble or two here this morning I
[1:07:10] know we like to we like to say the white
[1:07:12] man did this and the white man brought
[1:07:14] us from Africa and all of that well you
[1:07:17] know what before the white man ever
[1:07:19] bought us here the black men had
[1:07:22] slaves get that off my chest right God
[1:07:27] made man and man make
[1:07:30] slaves it's never been the intent of God
[1:07:34] I hope that don't hurt y'all little
[1:07:36] feelings it's never been the intent of
[1:07:40] God for us to be
[1:07:43] slaves it's it's always been the intent
[1:07:47] of God for us to be uh
[1:07:51] dominant not dominated
[1:07:56] huh our our true position in restoration
[1:08:00] is to have
[1:08:02] dominion come on come on we talking
[1:08:05] about the will of God y'all going to
[1:08:06] make me shout I'm starting to feel
[1:08:08] something the the nervousness starting
[1:08:10] to move
[1:08:13] now I done walk back and forth I done
[1:08:16] ate peanuts I done did all kind of stuff
[1:08:19] Garen like you're all right man you know
[1:08:22] I'm St but I'm starting to feel good
[1:08:24] because the pre is starting to move in
[1:08:26] all right but the intent of
[1:08:29] God right is for us to uh have
[1:08:35] dominion not to be
[1:08:38] dominated we look back in scripture see
[1:08:42] one thing about this the Bible say he
[1:08:44] say I'm God and I don't
[1:08:46] change right God God's uh objectives has
[1:08:52] to always line up with the original
[1:08:57] thoughts and plans from the beginning
[1:09:00] this is what the prophet taught us true
[1:09:03] watch if you study the message he always
[1:09:06] talks about going back to the original
[1:09:09] God's provided
[1:09:12] way and over the years you know you say
[1:09:14] those things and the people cringe it's
[1:09:17] like you you just don't understand the
[1:09:19] sounding of the
[1:09:21] trumpet is that right and and What Makes
[1:09:24] You free
[1:09:26] yes see glory to God so so in in looking
[1:09:31] at this thought you
[1:09:34] know I see God I try to see God you know
[1:09:37] like brother B talked about you see God
[1:09:39] in nature you know God is in music maybe
[1:09:43] not some of this stuff that we see we
[1:09:46] see now you don't see God in it you know
[1:09:49] when you watching Kirk Franklin up there
[1:09:51] hair dressed and you know gyrating
[1:09:54] around uh you be like I no don't care
[1:09:57] how you dress that up boy that ain't
[1:10:00] God cuz cuz God is not going to do
[1:10:02] anything that's
[1:10:04] unseemly everything in God is going to
[1:10:06] be done in decency in order see when you
[1:10:10] come to me amen with anything I want to
[1:10:13] see amen the order of the thing see the
[1:10:18] characteristics the makeup of the thing
[1:10:21] and how it lines up with the original
[1:10:24] plan and program of God no matter what
[1:10:26] it is is that right if if you start
[1:10:30] moving away amen from the original plan
[1:10:33] and program you getting yourself in
[1:10:35] trouble it ain't God it's something
[1:10:37] else right glory to glory to his name
[1:10:40] but here here's the thing Amen in the
[1:10:44] the the sovereignty of God you know what
[1:10:47] I'm glad that that and we talk about God
[1:10:50] being infinite right and I'm glad he is
[1:10:54] I'm I'm glad
[1:10:55] he's not getting a a a a new plan or a
[1:10:58] better plan or having a better way and
[1:11:02] and things catching him off God no
[1:11:05] matter what has happened to me or you
[1:11:08] Amen in our life it never caught God off
[1:11:12] God is that right amen God has never
[1:11:15] been thrown off no matter what our
[1:11:18] situation no matter what our
[1:11:20] circumstances might have been it never
[1:11:23] caught God of God
[1:11:26] God is that right if it if it catches
[1:11:29] God off God I don't know what kind of
[1:11:31] God that we say we serve him is that
[1:11:34] right God has always been well aware
[1:11:38] amen of of situations and
[1:11:41] circumstances if not he never could have
[1:11:44] put his plan and program into to
[1:11:50] motion right be because his first Bible
[1:11:55] was written in the
[1:11:58] Zodiac right and in writing in the
[1:12:01] Zodiac he had to have some sort of
[1:12:05] understanding that that Eve would fall
[1:12:08] and circumstances would present
[1:12:11] itself right glory to God Amen this this
[1:12:16] is just you know God and letter form
[1:12:19] right but uh we we could look back to
[1:12:23] the Zodiac we could look to the
[1:12:27] pyramids y'all might quiet on me this
[1:12:30] morning well I'm going preach Amen to
[1:12:32] y'all
[1:12:35] quietness but is that the truth we've
[1:12:37] been taught that there's three
[1:12:40] Bibles right glory to God and so uh uh
[1:12:45] nothing nothing could be altered nothing
[1:12:48] could be changed is that right it didn't
[1:12:51] catch God off of God that that you know
[1:12:55] Eve Eve would be deceived and and Adam
[1:12:58] would you know Adam would do what he did
[1:13:01] now I got into trouble the last time I'm
[1:13:03] leave this alone cuz you know maybe
[1:13:05] y'all just ain't where I am when I start
[1:13:08] preaching cuz sometimes I feel like
[1:13:11] things might offend us but I but I but
[1:13:14] uh I I'm so sorry that that that under
[1:13:18] grace and
[1:13:20] truth under grace and truth you got to
[1:13:22] follow the
[1:13:24] word come
[1:13:26] on I'mma I'mma medal just a
[1:13:29] second right right CA cuz you could take
[1:13:33] you could take a quote out of
[1:13:38] context huh and and see when brother
[1:13:41] brownon made this statement about about
[1:13:44] uh uh uh Adam back in Genesis walking
[1:13:48] out with his wife and things of that
[1:13:50] nature because of love that was for that
[1:13:53] day for that at time yes sir see under
[1:13:58] under under the baptism baptism of the
[1:14:01] Holy Ghost and truth of the word of God
[1:14:04] love will not require you to do that
[1:14:07] come on Church don't get scared now
[1:14:10] brother Jack is straight me when he come
[1:14:12] back right that would that a't in my
[1:14:15] notes but I thought I'd say that cuz you
[1:14:18] know the last time I was like oh I don't
[1:14:20] know if they followed me on that not to
[1:14:22] be offensive I don't say things to be
[1:14:24] offensive
[1:14:26] but but we have to present truth that
[1:14:29] was trueth for for Adam's
[1:14:32] day right but but under great in truth
[1:14:36] the second Adam right that's not
[1:14:41] required glory to God that's not
[1:14:44] required with agap of love I wouldn't
[1:14:47] require that of my
[1:14:51] wife if if I would require her to go to
[1:14:55] hell with me something's wrong with the
[1:14:57] kind of love that I say I
[1:14:59] got come on church Preach with me I'm
[1:15:02] not
[1:15:04] going come
[1:15:06] on this see I'mma get I'mma say it
[1:15:10] before I get to it this this is
[1:15:13] what the good news and freedom is all
[1:15:16] about the sounding of the Gospel trumpet
[1:15:19] up under the seventh seal is all
[1:15:22] about right it's it's it's a about
[1:15:26] truth right because
[1:15:29] look uh uh the son of man Ministry came
[1:15:33] to bring us
[1:15:35] Liberty he let the sun set
[1:15:39] free and he's the word right right not
[1:15:44] not a portion upon the the opening of
[1:15:48] the seventh seal it's not a portion
[1:15:51] right because when that which is perfect
[1:15:54] is come
[1:15:55] that which is in part is done away with
[1:15:58] so we don't have a part
[1:16:02] understanding come on we we we got a
[1:16:05] full seven course
[1:16:07] meal right glory to God we have a full
[1:16:12] seventh course meal we got a complete
[1:16:15] understanding that's the only way amen
[1:16:18] we'll get uh total Liberty total freedom
[1:16:22] is up under the seventh seal yes sir
[1:16:25] y'all going to make me preach for my
[1:16:27] time this
[1:16:28] morning and so it it will not require
[1:16:32] that cuz the debt was
[1:16:35] paid so so we we're we're walking Amen
[1:16:39] in the word because we've been taught
[1:16:42] that one word off produces
[1:16:48] death and man shall not live by bread
[1:16:51] alone but by y'all going to preach with
[1:16:54] me in yeah I know it right but but uh to
[1:16:59] just kind of get back to where I'm going
[1:17:02] y'all still with me y'all ain't left the
[1:17:05] building you know your body still here
[1:17:08] but but but but watch but watch but
[1:17:11] watch this the sovereignty of God see I
[1:17:15] need to understand these things right
[1:17:18] for myself personally I'm preaching to
[1:17:21] me if nobody else it's important for me
[1:17:24] to
[1:17:25] understand uh uh how God moves and how
[1:17:30] God works in my present
[1:17:35] circumstance and the only way that I
[1:17:38] could do that I got to go back to the
[1:17:40] word of God in order to be able to see
[1:17:44] God how he moves down through the
[1:17:46] history of the
[1:17:49] Bible right and how he's worked through
[1:17:52] the the Old Testament how he's worked
[1:17:55] through the New
[1:17:57] Testament is that right that's important
[1:18:01] for
[1:18:01] me glory to God Amen the sovereignty of
[1:18:06] God before the fog and then knowing that
[1:18:10] there would be a fall God knowing that
[1:18:12] there will be
[1:18:15] circumstances right
[1:18:17] circumstances surrounding Humanity's
[1:18:20] life realizing we're in a
[1:18:23] battle and talking they've been talking
[1:18:25] about that for three services we we've
[1:18:28] been in a battle this is not a picnic
[1:18:31] this is a war this is this is you know
[1:18:35] we we're we're Humanity even the great
[1:18:38] Apostle Paul says you know what when I
[1:18:40] would do good evil was
[1:18:43] present Paul said man things that I
[1:18:46] would do good man I don't even do those
[1:18:49] things the things I know that's
[1:18:53] right right why because we in in this
[1:18:57] however many elements you want to argue
[1:18:59] about it is right we in this we bypassed
[1:19:05] our theophanies to come to be tested and
[1:19:08] tried put through the test is that right
[1:19:12] encounter circumstances encounter issues
[1:19:16] encounter arguments encounter
[1:19:19] frustrations to encounter drugs and to
[1:19:22] encounter amen prostit institution
[1:19:26] and all right y going to make me run up
[1:19:29] in this place this morning all right
[1:19:32] right glory to God God knew what
[1:19:36] Humanity would
[1:19:40] face right amen and so with with the
[1:19:44] knowledge of what Humanity would face
[1:19:48] right and in writing the word the laws
[1:19:53] came from God can I get a
[1:19:56] witness you know uh people that
[1:20:00] criticize they try to make this a man's
[1:20:03] writing right but it it it it can't be a
[1:20:08] man's writing cuz we can't hardly put
[1:20:10] two thoughts
[1:20:12] together with without tripping ourselves
[1:20:15] up and to see to
[1:20:18] see how uh
[1:20:22] perfect in in the the time AP and the
[1:20:26] Shadows of the scriptures actually
[1:20:29] are right amen I'm glad I ain't go to
[1:20:32] Bible
[1:20:34] school did I come in
[1:20:36] contact with with sound
[1:20:41] Doctrine right I come in contact with a
[1:20:44] prophet cuz now I bounced around in
[1:20:46] church too you know I had one
[1:20:48] grandmother was
[1:20:50] Baptist and one Grandmama was
[1:20:53] Holiness right right amen glory to God
[1:20:57] that's most people grew up that way
[1:21:00] right amen and so it in all of that I
[1:21:04] still didn't get what I needed but now
[1:21:09] through the teachings of the Prophet I
[1:21:13] can understand the the sounding of the
[1:21:17] trumpets Amen in the different
[1:21:21] ages is that right and and why and why
[1:21:25] uh uh Luther sounded the trumpet right
[1:21:30] amen uh in his day with the message of
[1:21:34] justification and the just shall live by
[1:21:36] faith right uh calling the the Believers
[1:21:43] to a
[1:21:44] jubilee a coming
[1:21:47] out or a a word I was looking at I I
[1:21:51] shouted at my house a reset
[1:21:56] right they needed a
[1:21:59] reset and when Luther and and Luther was
[1:22:02] considered a Fanatic in his
[1:22:05] day right when he wrote those thesis and
[1:22:09] and and placed them on the y'all know
[1:22:12] what I'm talking about right sir y'all
[1:22:14] familiar with that you know he was
[1:22:17] considered a
[1:22:19] fanatic right but but he was a
[1:22:23] trained
[1:22:25] Trumpeter by almighty God to sound a
[1:22:30] trumpet in that day to liberate the
[1:22:34] people from
[1:22:37] Catholicism right because what
[1:22:40] Catholicism had was a lot of man-made
[1:22:44] Creeds and
[1:22:46] Doctrine right things that were so
[1:22:49] contrary to scripture kind of like what
[1:22:52] it was amen when Jesus came on the scene
[1:22:55] sounding the trumpet according to the
[1:22:59] scripture right opening the the eyes of
[1:23:02] the Blind and all of the things that
[1:23:05] amen he was required to do according to
[1:23:08] scripture right in in his day what was
[1:23:13] that that was
[1:23:16] Liberty that was true
[1:23:18] Freedom that was you know because the
[1:23:21] people sometimes people don't even
[1:23:23] really know that when they bound people
[1:23:26] really don't know what bondage really is
[1:23:29] sometimes right you might think it's
[1:23:31] having your hands tired and this and
[1:23:33] that and the other that's a
[1:23:35] form but but there's a greater level of
[1:23:39] bondage that you find Humanity on and
[1:23:42] they walking every day up and down going
[1:23:45] to work and everything else but yet it's
[1:23:48] still they're Bound in so many ways and
[1:23:51] we going
[1:23:52] there right yeah glory to God but but in
[1:23:57] the sovereignty so
[1:23:59] so God God you know God understand that
[1:24:04] Humanity we sometime we think we the
[1:24:06] only ones that can't hardly pay our
[1:24:10] bills money short you working hard and
[1:24:13] come on preach with me somebody well I
[1:24:15] know y'all got a whole lot of money in
[1:24:17] here but y'all just stay with me work
[1:24:18] with me I know y'all got plenty of money
[1:24:20] in the bank and all that but I don't
[1:24:23] glory to God
[1:24:24] well I'm preaching it myself brother
[1:24:27] Smiley God
[1:24:29] knew right oh glory to God cuz y'all
[1:24:32] y'all sit there looking like y'all got
[1:24:33] plenty of money now when when when when
[1:24:35] this you know service over I'm stand at
[1:24:37] the door y'all just slip me little
[1:24:39] something I won't say
[1:24:40] nothing you know I W Ain nothing praise
[1:24:43] the Lord thank you thank you thank you
[1:24:45] thank you thank you thank
[1:24:48] you but but God knew that that the
[1:24:52] people in the Old Testament I'm I'm move
[1:24:54] moving us along right God knew that the
[1:24:58] people would
[1:25:00] move into heart times Believers having
[1:25:04] hard times that that seem like it's hard
[1:25:07] to
[1:25:08] F right so you know CU sometime we might
[1:25:12] turn turn our heads up and then no God
[1:25:15] you know God knows who's going to do
[1:25:17] what and who's going to have what and
[1:25:20] this that and the other and no matter
[1:25:21] how much we try to preach Prosperity
[1:25:23] everybody ain't going to have no
[1:25:24] millions of
[1:25:25] dollars you know if he feel led to drop
[1:25:29] me off I'm going to be all right praise
[1:25:31] the
[1:25:32] Lord but but God but God God understands
[1:25:36] that you know uh uh uh through
[1:25:41] struggle Humanity will take advantage of
[1:25:46] humanity right glory to God come on Amen
[1:25:52] but see in the watch in the writings of
[1:25:55] the levitical
[1:25:59] law God had to write with the original
[1:26:04] thoughts in
[1:26:07] mind glory to God watch this God it's
[1:26:12] never been been amen uh God's motive or
[1:26:15] objective for us to be being bondage to
[1:26:19] be to be slaves God has always wanted us
[1:26:23] to be
[1:26:24] free God has always wanted for us to to
[1:26:28] to be a
[1:26:30] family right and I'm preaching now I'm
[1:26:33] I'm about to cut up but I'm preaching
[1:26:36] watch what brother Jack and them been
[1:26:38] preaching see you said well you just out
[1:26:40] there no I'm not while y'all shouting
[1:26:43] I'm
[1:26:44] listening right I'm I'm getting
[1:26:48] contacts right plus I can't jump up
[1:26:51] quick like y'all you know these joints
[1:26:54] don't let me after a hard week all right
[1:26:57] but but I'm trying to bring in to
[1:27:01] perspective uh uh the holy spirit in the
[1:27:06] inspiration in the
[1:27:08] church right glory to God see in the
[1:27:12] writing of the levitical
[1:27:15] law uh God pended or had it pinned in a
[1:27:19] way that that that it lines up with his
[1:27:25] original uh uh
[1:27:28] thought for the church for the family
[1:27:33] God has never wanted for the family to
[1:27:34] be
[1:27:37] separated
[1:27:40] dysfunctional come on Ah that's never
[1:27:44] been
[1:27:45] God huh amen that's never never you
[1:27:49] can't show me no scripture
[1:27:52] nowhere right but God wrote in such a
[1:27:56] way right
[1:27:59] knowing by having knowledge being
[1:28:03] infinite that hey let's face it things
[1:28:06] will
[1:28:07] happen right but but but when he writes
[1:28:11] he's always looking back to the
[1:28:14] original right in the Old Testament
[1:28:17] right with
[1:28:18] the with the
[1:28:20] levitical uh preet he had them to write
[1:28:23] a about this Year of
[1:28:26] Jubilee right at this this this 50th
[1:28:32] year right it shall be uh
[1:28:38] uh uh reset
[1:28:41] time where where you know cuz Hard Times
[1:28:44] come and and we see it all through the
[1:28:46] scriptures where you know father it I
[1:28:50] don't think I could do it but you know
[1:28:52] had to sell their daughters
[1:28:55] right come on
[1:28:57] Church well I would say something but I
[1:28:59] know it hurt some folk
[1:29:02] feeling I'll just say it like this this
[1:29:04] is why it's so important as as
[1:29:07] men we we
[1:29:10] watch how we train our our our children
[1:29:14] up and train them up they gonna do what
[1:29:16] they want to do I know when they get of
[1:29:18] age where they can make their own
[1:29:21] choices but while they're plyable is so
[1:29:25] important uh to train them up in a
[1:29:29] certain way right dress them a certain
[1:29:31] way is that right you you make it your
[1:29:35] business to show them the right way even
[1:29:39] the even though you know they they have
[1:29:43] Choice before them right choice is a big
[1:29:46] thing choice is something that can never
[1:29:48] be taken from us but you you give them
[1:29:51] the right way from the beginning
[1:29:55] beginning right amen so that so that uh
[1:29:59] your sons and your daughters
[1:30:02] understand because you know you you look
[1:30:04] at Society now you just like now now I'm
[1:30:08] a little older than them most of
[1:30:10] everybody in here set for a few
[1:30:12] folk right and and and just when we were
[1:30:16] coming
[1:30:18] up we just believe in dressing
[1:30:22] up even when the were going to hang out
[1:30:25] on the corner and do wrong they went out
[1:30:27] on the corner like
[1:30:30] this with a pair of gators on I I mean
[1:30:35] as a youngster growing up in New Jersey
[1:30:37] you know I I used to just you know kind
[1:30:40] of
[1:30:41] admire I guess that's why I am the way
[1:30:43] that I am but it's like you you know I
[1:30:46] used to see Tyrone and Tony and them

[1:34:28] little bit and man you I'm not taking
[1:34:31] you nowhere like
[1:34:33] that what you call with
[1:34:36] that huh but you know I wasn't I wasn't
[1:34:41] uh 250 something pounds now back in them
[1:34:44] days you know I was too now I was even
[1:34:48] 200 lb and it's like there's no sense of
[1:34:51] me getting beat up because I allow you
[1:34:54] to come out with all your good showing
[1:34:56] and it's attracting attention and and I
[1:34:59] can't say nothing without getting
[1:35:01] knuckled
[1:35:03] up come on talk to me
[1:35:08] somebody
[1:35:09] amen see glory to God so so I mean even
[1:35:14] as as brothers you
[1:35:17] know I I I know sisters like fashion but
[1:35:20] you can't wear
[1:35:22] everything I mean some things you can
[1:35:25] you you know you can wear and some of
[1:35:27] that stuff you just can't wear you know
[1:35:31] and if if if it's pushing the borderline
[1:35:34] you know as a a husband or whatever dad
[1:35:38] you got no baby go honey you know I love
[1:35:41] you but I just can't let you go out like
[1:35:45] that huh now men used to do that let me
[1:35:49] get on topic Lord have mercy y'all done
[1:35:51] pull me way out there i a I didn't I did
[1:35:55] not come to medal with nobody's
[1:35:57] Affairs I had a good nice hallelujah
[1:36:01] praise the Lord
[1:36:03] thought well I guess because I see
[1:36:06] things you know in the Run of a day and
[1:36:08] all of that and it's like you know I can
[1:36:12] see now why uh the prophet of
[1:36:16] God uh made those
[1:36:19] statements in a time where women still
[1:36:22] wore dresses right for the most
[1:36:25] part in the 60s women hadn't fully
[1:36:30] gravitated or the 50s and the 40s to
[1:36:33] pants
[1:36:35] yet come on now go go search your
[1:36:39] history look at your history books look
[1:36:42] at all the pictures from back then women
[1:36:44] had not gravitated towards pants yet now
[1:36:49] I'm going to say this like I want to uh
[1:36:51] I'm just sounding a trumpet you can do
[1:36:53] whatever whatever you want to do you
[1:36:54] could you could accept it or reject it
[1:36:57] I'm still preaching I ain't got nowhere
[1:37:00] yet but it's the truth we you you got to
[1:37:04] be able to to follow the spirits and the
[1:37:09] anointing that that that be on things be
[1:37:13] but Lord help me to get away from this
[1:37:17] Lord right be because look at the just
[1:37:20] the the the anointing that follows those
[1:37:24] things is what people and we wonder why
[1:37:27] the world is is is is all uh upside down
[1:37:31] and right is wrong and wrong is right
[1:37:34] right and because the ministry is more
[1:37:36] concerned about uh uh uh um you know
[1:37:41] membership and popularity instead of
[1:37:43] sounding a trumpet that will prepare
[1:37:46] people for a
[1:37:50] Rapture huh amen and I know we got to
[1:37:54] have a balance on things but but true
[1:37:59] Liberty and true Freedom comes from amen
[1:38:03] the sounding of the trumpet let let me
[1:38:06] hit this and then I'm I'mma Dash into
[1:38:08] what I want and then I'm get on out of
[1:38:09] here right watch watch the mind of God
[1:38:13] right and and Leviticus knowing that man
[1:38:19] folk will be in slavery folk will be in
[1:38:21] bondage but watch the
[1:38:25] provision right watch the provision of
[1:38:29] God God set that
[1:38:32] up right right God set that up to stay
[1:38:37] with a
[1:38:38] standard it's like yes they they'll go
[1:38:42] in there but in the 50th year amen I'm
[1:38:46] I'mma send the high priest through right
[1:38:50] and watch this to sound the trumpet
[1:38:56] right types and shadows to sound the
[1:38:59] trumpet and here's the next thing it's
[1:39:02] important for you to be trained to the
[1:39:05] sound of the trumpet right what does
[1:39:08] this sounding
[1:39:10] mean for me preach huh this sounding of
[1:39:16] the trumpet in the 50th year what does
[1:39:21] it mean
[1:39:23] what what does it
[1:39:25] signify right it signifies amen that I
[1:39:30] can go
[1:39:31] back that it's it's time for a
[1:39:35] reset right I want when this when when
[1:39:38] when the trumpet sound in the 50th year
[1:39:42] it says I once was a slave but boop
[1:39:45] boop come on I I don't I no longer have
[1:39:50] to obey
[1:39:51] you God s that up God is always a
[1:39:57] provider is that
[1:39:59] right the nature in the mind of God
[1:40:02] doesn't change she say God I can't
[1:40:05] change I I always want for my people to
[1:40:08] be free I always want for my people amen
[1:40:12] watch the sounding of the trumpet the
[1:40:14] last couple of weeks oh that's just
[1:40:16] brother
[1:40:18] Troy oh that's just brother Jack no no
[1:40:23] that's the high priest after the order
[1:40:25] of
[1:40:27] mzd right sounding sounding a trumpet
[1:40:30] under the seven seal telling his church
[1:40:34] to get rid of the isms and the
[1:40:37] schisms right under the voice of the
[1:40:40] seventh angel amen that sounding was
[1:40:44] getting rid of the isms and the
[1:40:47] schisms the things that was so contrary
[1:40:50] to the word just like when Jesus came on
[1:40:53] the scene Jesus say man y'all with all
[1:40:56] of this stuff y'all make the word of God
[1:40:58] of non
[1:40:59] effect right the word of God cannot
[1:41:03] affect you properly with all of this
[1:41:09] stuff right Jesus understood he had the
[1:41:14] year of of acceptance Ministry a
[1:41:18] Ministry that would call a people out
[1:41:22] right CZ they just they had a lot of
[1:41:24] religion in the days of
[1:41:27] Jesus right that's that's why they blast
[1:41:31] them they couldn't see God hidden in
[1:41:33] revealing Simplicity they couldn't see
[1:41:36] the unfolding of
[1:41:38] scripture boy I got some man I don't
[1:41:41] know which way to get I got quotes I
[1:41:43] thought I was gonna read but I'm feeling
[1:41:45] good now I feel my
[1:41:49] rhythm right I feel my rhythm right
[1:41:54] but but may maybe maybe maybe we'll
[1:41:56] we'll do this I got about 30 minutes
[1:41:59] y'all got 30 minutes y'all can hold with
[1:42:01] me for for 30 minutes right you see I'm
[1:42:06] just trying to show us God's God's
[1:42:10] Provisions God God provides for us in
[1:42:14] such a way that we don't understand
[1:42:19] sometime right we don't understand God's
[1:42:22] provided way
[1:42:24] is
[1:42:25] Liberty is freedom is that right glory
[1:42:29] to God we we want to go our own way we
[1:42:32] want to do it our own thing that's that
[1:42:36] just shows you you fulfilling prophecy
[1:42:39] right because the the Bible talks about
[1:42:42] uh the women in this day they want to
[1:42:44] take on the name but but I'm going do my
[1:42:47] own
[1:42:48] thing come on no I'm not being critical
[1:42:51] cu the woman type the church that's the
[1:42:53] same thing with the
[1:42:55] church right we we want to we want to
[1:42:57] try to hold on to whatever we trying to
[1:42:59] hold on to as far as what we feel is
[1:43:03] Christianity but yet still we want to do
[1:43:06] our own thing go where we want to go it
[1:43:10] it don't work like
[1:43:12] that everything has been governed by God
[1:43:16] everything has got to meet a certain
[1:43:19] standard sir right if God is going to be
[1:43:22] Iden identified with it see God is not
[1:43:25] going to be
[1:43:26] identified you know we think that God is
[1:43:28] just going to wink at at at our
[1:43:30] ignorance it's not happening not not now
[1:43:33] because the word has been uh uh revealed
[1:43:38] unfolded right glory to God so so no
[1:43:42] longer is God just winking at
[1:43:47] ignorance right see if if we say we
[1:43:50] believe God said his voice
[1:43:53] to the Earth right to call a people
[1:43:59] out then then then you know we can't
[1:44:04] reject the voice and and and have
[1:44:08] Liberty now I'm going somewhere on that
[1:44:10] note right y'all bear with
[1:44:14] me y'all all
[1:44:19] right um
[1:44:23] oh
[1:44:27] Lord y'all give me a second te
[1:44:31] NY I think
[1:44:40] my okay I could read use this quote okay
[1:44:44] y'all Y my my my power went out but
[1:44:48] watch this in the choosing of a bride uh
[1:44:51] 1965 he said says remember when the
[1:44:55] Jubilee year comes the UB the purpose of
[1:44:59] this coming is so that the people can go
[1:45:03] free y'all with me that's all I'm
[1:45:06] preaching right I want to you know
[1:45:08] meding
[1:45:09] that he said Remember When the Jubilee
[1:45:13] comes the priest rides with his trumpet
[1:45:18] sounding right amen and see the of the
[1:45:23] trumpet is the good news that's good
[1:45:27] news right what cuz if you was a
[1:45:31] slave and you hear this sounding of the
[1:45:35] trumpet that ain't bad
[1:45:38] news right not not for the elect that's
[1:45:43] good news but I'm done with
[1:45:46] this right I'm done with this it's a
[1:45:50] time for a reset it's a time to now go
[1:45:54] back and and and read the entire uh
[1:45:56] levitical 20 25 from uh verse 8 all the
[1:46:01] way to verse 55 I just wrote a couple of
[1:46:03] vers read a couple of verses it it
[1:46:06] signifies okay you can go back now you
[1:46:10] can go back to your inheritance you
[1:46:12] could go back to what's yours God always
[1:46:16] wants for us to get our stuff
[1:46:20] back come on Amen
[1:46:23] you might you might have lost some stuff
[1:46:26] Amen on the journey but now at this
[1:46:29] sounding you can get it back amen right
[1:46:34] glory to God but you got to be able to
[1:46:37] recognize that sound and the importance
[1:46:40] of it we still working with it right his
[1:46:44] trumpet sounded that every slave could
[1:46:47] go
[1:46:48] free right watch this next statement
[1:46:52] though
[1:46:53] right but if they refuse to accept their
[1:46:57] freedom freedom this present tense now
[1:47:01] right because we hear the gospel we go
[1:47:05] to church why are you
[1:47:14] coming it's not F every 50 years under
[1:47:17] the Old Testament is every
[1:47:20] week we we see
[1:47:23] every week we're hearing the gospel
[1:47:25] trumpet
[1:47:27] sound right and see every week you can
[1:47:31] go
[1:47:32] free right of
[1:47:36] something but I was pondering this all
[1:47:39] week long I said you know
[1:47:41] what could you could you and we all can
[1:47:45] imagine being slaves cuz we were once
[1:47:47] were right come
[1:47:50] on but could you imagine the the the
[1:47:54] trauma right and all the things that a
[1:47:59] slave even though the the trumpet
[1:48:02] sounding that they
[1:48:05] physically right can go free
[1:48:09] right there's a lot of bondage up
[1:48:14] here right see all of us free right now
[1:48:18] this morning we we free to praise him we
[1:48:20] free to come to church but amen all of
[1:48:24] us ain't free up
[1:48:27] here all of us ain't really totally free
[1:48:30] in
[1:48:31] here there there's still things that's
[1:48:33] got us in in abundance I'm a living
[1:48:38] witness huh there's there's things and
[1:48:41] this is why we have got to preach a
[1:48:44] holistic gospel so that amen the
[1:48:48] liberated redeemed attribute of God can
[1:48:52] go totally
[1:48:55] free
[1:48:57] right sometimes we can't highly
[1:49:00] Fellowship because of something up
[1:49:03] here come
[1:49:05] on sometimes it's hard fac us to even
[1:49:09] have uh the proper relations with our
[1:49:13] spouses because of trauma and things
[1:49:16] that's up here come on Church come on
[1:49:19] church this thing goes deeper than chch
[1:49:22] get the Holy Ghost and just jumping and
[1:49:25] shouting cuz people shout and jump and
[1:49:28] and just as
[1:49:31] bound just as
[1:49:33] bound that that shouting and jumping
[1:49:36] only good for a church
[1:49:40] service we we we we we liberated you
[1:49:43] know long as somebody pumping and
[1:49:46] pulling and you know but then we leave
[1:49:48] here we just as as bound
[1:49:53] right we
[1:49:55] bound especially if you could get
[1:49:57] offended at the word you definitely
[1:50:00] bound right but see the sounding of the
[1:50:04] Gospel
[1:50:06] trumpet let me let me read this and
[1:50:08] I'mma comment and I'm gonna get out of
[1:50:09] here in a few few minutes I ain't GNA
[1:50:10] hold you I Ain gonna wear yall out but I
[1:50:12] like this it it it gives me perspective
[1:50:16] and and it and it gives us perspective
[1:50:19] if you're here this morning why are you
[1:50:22] here
[1:50:23] here cuz Jack is a good guy I know
[1:50:27] that but Jack being a good guy Won't Set
[1:50:31] You
[1:50:35] Free his
[1:50:38] personality his character alone Won't
[1:50:41] Set You
[1:50:43] Free what sets you free is when he takes
[1:50:47] that
[1:50:50] trumpet and gets to sounding it it
[1:50:53] that's the thing that sets you
[1:50:58] free right cuz we got a lot of hangups
[1:51:01] in
[1:51:04] church huh we cheese and we smile and
[1:51:08] all of that and you know and we got
[1:51:12] issues right and I'm not saying that to
[1:51:15] be negative I'm just saying that to be
[1:51:18] realistic right but we thank God that
[1:51:23] that we have the son of man
[1:51:25] ministry right we thank God that that
[1:51:29] Christ takes amen the trumpet and sounds
[1:51:35] it right and see you could even re uh
[1:51:40] you could even accept the liberty of the
[1:51:44] word right or you could reject it it's
[1:51:48] up to you right amen he says but if they
[1:51:52] refus to accept their
[1:51:55] freedom right how many people refus to
[1:51:58] accept their freedom then he had to be
[1:52:02] taken to the temple to a post
[1:52:06] right amen and a ABB boarded through he
[1:52:11] through uh the
[1:52:13] ear and then he served his master
[1:52:18] always right it was put in his ear as a
[1:52:23] type of of Faith coming by
[1:52:26] hearing right he heard the trumpet but
[1:52:30] he didn't want to listen to
[1:52:36] it see see how

[2:01:04] refusal right see in in one place he

[2:01:11] trumpet is to take the mark of the
[2:01:14] beast boy I got some information up here
[2:01:17] now I ain't going to get to it this is
[2:01:19] deep the natur the natural type in the
[2:01:23] spir spiritual takes on feet right it
[2:01:27] just gets so much broader in the
[2:01:30] spiritual right glory to his wonderful
[2:01:33] name but you know one of the things I'm
[2:01:35] I'm I'mma dash out of here I know my
[2:01:37] time is just about up uh I I wanted to
[2:01:41] just dwell on so much is
[2:01:45] is being able to
[2:01:48] discern right and wrong
[2:01:52] standing God's provision right amen why
[2:01:57] God did this understand what's actually
[2:02:00] going on well this ain't hate speech
[2:02:04] this is not uh uh uh I don't listen
[2:02:07] church I Don't Preach to just try to
[2:02:09] hurt people feeling I'm not made up like
[2:02:11] that right but I will say this when I
[2:02:15] get anointed I don't see nobody I don't
[2:02:18] see none of y'all y'all ain't my friend
[2:02:20] till I get get somebody this
[2:02:23] mic my kids my wife so if you you might
[2:02:26] hear me say I try to dial it down cuz I
[2:02:28] know y'all get a little nervous if I say
[2:02:30] something like that but I'm not nervous
[2:02:33] because they got to come God's provided
[2:02:35] way just like right glory to God now
[2:02:40] amen every all of y'all and all of y'all
[2:02:43] children and all of y'all husbands and
[2:02:45] all of y'all wives right you cannot make
[2:02:49] it by passing the word and I'm not
[2:02:52] trying to be
[2:02:54] destructive right or belittle it's none
[2:02:58] of that but amen you know if because if
[2:03:02] a trumpet don't give the right kind of
[2:03:07] sound how could you
[2:03:10] prepare what are your
[2:03:12] hearing see what like if if you're
[2:03:16] listening to the sounding of the
[2:03:18] trumpets the trumpeters now you never
[2:03:22] make own
[2:03:25] Rapture that's hate speech for some
[2:03:28] people but it's the truth right because
[2:03:32] they only had part interpretation of the
[2:03:35] word right they had the at Ephesus God
[2:03:41] gave them the complete word right his
[2:03:44] complete thoughts right but then in the
[2:03:48] next age they started to drift go back
[2:03:51] to the church age book I know what I'm
[2:03:53] talking about they started to drift away
[2:03:57] from amen and brother J done Tau on this
[2:04:00] away from the original word right glory
[2:04:04] to God Amen they got
[2:04:07] tasa then they they brought in false
[2:04:10] baptisms they brought this they brought
[2:04:13] that they brought this then they brought
[2:04:15] that right then in the next age and in
[2:04:19] the next age and then it's like man what
[2:04:21] in the world do we got what do what do
[2:04:23] we have
[2:04:24] here this thing is so far away from the
[2:04:28] original thought and intent of
[2:04:30] God then God started uh restoration back
[2:04:35] to the word with Luther come on church
[2:04:40] but Luther was just a reformer he goes
[2:04:42] off the scene before the complete
[2:04:45] understanding of the word could be
[2:04:47] revealed he had a portion then then m
[2:04:52] Luther right I mean
[2:04:54] Wesley right did Pentecost great
[2:04:59] Revival huh great Revival Pentecost had
[2:05:02] a great Revival but it was only the
[2:05:04] restoration of the
[2:05:06] gifts right it wasn't the complete
[2:05:09] interpretation the complete
[2:05:11] interpretation didn't come to the
[2:05:14] sounding of the voice of the seventh
[2:05:16] angel right according to Revelation
[2:05:20] 10 right when he shall begin to sign the
[2:05:23] mystery of God shall be
[2:05:25] finished now it's no more part word
[2:05:30] right the the the trumpeter has to sound
[2:05:34] out complete
[2:05:37] word or you won't go
[2:05:40] free so if y'all want me to sugarcoat it
[2:05:44] and baby it I'm
[2:05:46] quitting cuz I can't do it it ain't in
[2:05:48] my
[2:05:49] makeup it ain't in my makeup up church I
[2:05:52] could go to heaven sitting in the back
[2:05:54] back
[2:05:56] seat right amen but but amen I won't
[2:06:01] compromise the Integrity of the word of
[2:06:03] God for a group of people that that
[2:06:06] that'll turn down God cuz when you turn
[2:06:09] down the revelation of the word you
[2:06:11] turning down
[2:06:12] God you turning down your actual
[2:06:19] freedom is that right so I can't do it I
[2:06:22] ain't built like that I ain't built like
[2:06:26] that people like you know I I had all
[2:06:29] kind of labels over the years boy
[2:06:31] brother Smiley boy he it's you just like
[2:06:35] understanding that's all that is if you
[2:06:37] knew and un really knew and understood
[2:06:40] me you wouldn't say that right come on
[2:06:43] Church you'll see that you know what
[2:06:46] this man is is trying to give me
[2:06:49] something that produces more more
[2:06:52] freedom more freedom in my life more
[2:06:54] freedom as a adult more freedom as a
[2:06:57] young person is that right more more
[2:07:01] freedom as a family glory to God the the
[2:07:04] more the more brother Jack digs and get
[2:07:09] inspired right and elevates that's to my
[2:07:12] benefit that sounding is to my benefit I
[2:07:17] don't know about y'all right sometimes
[2:07:20] it might it might hurt hurt me in the
[2:07:22] flesh but it serves as a benefit to
[2:07:26] me right glory to God as a son yeah it's
[2:07:32] chastisement you know ain't good for a
[2:07:35] moment but but after it's over with you

[2:07:40] there and said
