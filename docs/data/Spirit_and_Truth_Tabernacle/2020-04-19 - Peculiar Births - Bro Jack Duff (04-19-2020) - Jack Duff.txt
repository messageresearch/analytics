notice it seem like things are starting to turn and go the other way and grateful for that and I've just been praying that as our governor made the decision to allow us to be able to get together he said church was essential I've been praying it well we want to see less cases in Florida then more cases and I think a lot of people love to prove that he was wrong but I say Lord working a miracle on this man's behalf and show him that because he opened the churches that things got better humble themselves and pray turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven then I will heal the lane so we want to see the Word of God for feel amen underneath his leadership so we think God for them all right I think that's all I need to announce I want to read a couple well at least one scripture it's gonna be quite lengthy a man here on the scripture reading for today but I pray that the Lord will just bless amen our journey amen thank you thank you sister Rachel a man praise the Lord praise the Lord I want to read from Acts chapter 7 on today and we'll start at verse 17 and then I'll let you be seated oh Jesus lord help us have your way a man here in this service acts 7 verse 17 and it says but when the time of the promise true 9 which God had sworn to Abraham the peoples grew and multiplied in each so when the time of the promise drew 9 which God has sworn to Abraham the people and multiply in Egypt till another king arose which knew not Joseph the same dealt subtly with our kindred and evil and treated our father so that they cast out the young children to the end they might not live so there was a this is really a time of persecution that is happening there and in the days that Moses is actually coming to be born there's a time of persecution also we know that the same thing happened in the time of Jesus let's go honest verse 20 says in which time Moses was born and was exceeding fair and nourished up in his father's house three months when he was cast out Pharaoh's daughter took him up and nourished him for her own son Moses was learned and all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was mighty in words and in deeds and when he was full forty years old it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel and seeing one of them suffer wrong he defended him and avenged him that was oppressed and smoke the Egyptian for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them but they understood it not and the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove and would have set them at one again saying Sergi a brother and why do you wrong one to another but he did but but he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away saying who made the ruler and a judge over us wilt thou kill me as thou didst Egyptians yesterday the Egyptian yesterday then fled Moses at this saying and was a stranger in the land of Midian where he began two sons and when forty years were expired there appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai and Angel Lord and a flame of fire in a bush when Moses saw it they he under at the site and as he drew near to behold it the voice of the Lord came unto him saying I am the God of thy father the God of Abraham and the god of Isaac and the God of Jacob then Moses trembling and Durst not behold then said the Lord to him put off thy shoes from my feet for the place where thou standest is holy ground I have seen I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt and I have heard their groaning and come down to deliver them and now come on and now come I will send thee into Egypt this Moses whom they refused saying who made the rule in a judge the same that God seemed to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush my god let me just a couple of more verses you brought them out after that he had showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness 40 years this is that Moses which said unto the children Israel a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear a man the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow and a brief word of Prayer father we thank you for the ability to read the Word of God thank you for being able to gather once more in the house of the Lord thank you for the time of service that you're given us though God and Lord as we just continue to pray for our governor Lord him just making the decision to allow churches to gather he said it was essential we pray God that it won't be any additional cases but Lord that things will change that even somebody might be at the brink of leaving here the to bring them back they would see miracles because people are praying father I just pray that you would just move by your spirit all over the land and we thank you for the various testimonies that we have heard Society Liam father Lord last night was going was turning for the worst but God after prayer he began to get better and Lord we thank you for here in prayer we the millage daughter Lord she was in ICU and they didn't think much of her but God after prayer now she's sitting up in a chair eating and celebrating life with her family Lord there's many other testimonies that have come forth our precious brother Jew wasn't with the virus but Lord he had to had a stroke then I had a blood clot but God you brought him through the surgery now he's sitting up and and and fellowshipping with his family and friends God you're moving by your spirit on these knees and we thank you for showing yourself strong on behalf of the prayers of the saints and God we want to continue to pray there's the hIG's family there in South Carolina that is going through a lot they've lost one loved women and the wife was passed on the husband is in a coma the daughter just got admitted to the hospital yesterday Lord they need that they need a touch from you they need your help and only you got can move on the scenes so we execute move by your spirit upon that family and God we want to remember our precious brother Jeff who had to have surgery this morning God we

that have come thank you for those that are joining us align speak to every heart God is our prayer in Jesus name we pray amen and amen praise the Lord God bless you you can be seated in the presence of the Lord we just want to we've read the scripture we want to continue amen our a journey through step into division we'll use a different title for today the title for today will be peculiar bursts amen peculiar verse a man but we're still in that channel of stepping to the vision and I was so blessed by the sermon this morning because brother Troy walked right into that channel and everything he was saying this fit was just connecting right with with the with the inspiration that Lord gave us and I was just so really really blessed by that so we want to just kind of continue down that path and and just bear with me here as we just kind of look at this we're still trying to comfort you with the words of God all right here I want to just opened up with just a quick here from the profit out of the message why I speak a man we're talking about peculiar bursts peculiar bursts says Moses was born with a gift of faith a man great faith Moses had we see it after a while coming out in him and this is beautiful you know the thing of it is is that a lot of times we are born with specific gifts but it take a certain amount of trial and tribulation to cause those gifts to come out of us glory to God it it takes a little pressure a man front from the enemy and and actually the devil thinking he's squeezing you and and maybe gonna put you in a position where you about to give up or whatever but he doesn't realize when he squeezes you there's something else about to come out a man there there's a there's a gift there's an anointing there's a revelation there's an understanding there's a faith there's a it meant my boldness that will come out in the midst of your trial hallelujah as Christians were not afraid of trials glory you know when when Goliath was there faced him a man of children of Israel he could go for forty days just posting like crazy that's because he hadn't ran into the right one hallelujah it's time for the devil to run into the right one hey man and I claim that you are the right one hey man and it's only when David saw the pressure that the peoples under he said don't don't nobody need to be afraid anymore I will fight this Goliath if nobody else will go I will stand toe-to-toe with this guy my David was not speaking that to be arrogant David was speaking that because he said a God that delivered me from the lion and the God that delivered me from the bear is the same cover that will deliver me from this uncircumcised philistine holy amen we got to know who we are and where we stand and nothing will be able to stand before us blessed be the name of the Lord it takes pressure to pull these things out of us hey man so look at what he says here it says we see after a while coming out in him and he was born in a great family as we know how that his father and his mother and come from a family of Levi which the story here prevalences to this in the book of Exodus says so beautifully gives the life of this great character and he was one of the greatest characters of the Bible for he was strictly tight of the Lord Jesus he was born in a very odd birth like the Lord Jesus he was born in the time of persecution like the Lord Jesus he was born to be a deliverer like the Lord Jesus Oh hallelujah amen he says how he was he was he and of his parents away from the enemy like the Lord Jesus oh it's just blesses my heart i'ma keep reading but you know I was early this morning when we heard the sermon there our brother Troy went back to Psalm 27 and and he finished up on that last verse because brother Brandon preached a raptor message from the book from some Psalm 27 which was very I would say very unique for him to take that angle but in verse 5 of Psalm 27 verse 5 and and and I want you to I want you to catch this because I think it just fits real closely Moses was hit a man from that from the enemy Jesus was hit from the enemy can I tell you what's gonna happen to you you are also going to be heat from the enemy hey man even if they tell you to go on lockdown they don't realize they helping you out you're being heat from the enemy because the me in his pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle silly hot me and he shall set me up upon a rock and as brother Troy told us that rock is a rock a revelation that's the word of the Lord that's what we have ourselves in that's what we wrap ourselves in hey Moses was here Jesus was here now the bride is being here he will hide me let's say be the name of the Lord a man church Saint Manny Manny man we gotta know the Scriptures not just there just to be there when the Prophet preached that I mean everybody brothers in high could he preach the rapture from here and then what he's trying to say I'm a no sense of me trying to keep it all together I might as well just let it flow right but the purpose right brother Brandon with tusk us in at the time of the rapture we can expect trouble trouble right so when you see all the trouble all around you got to go back to the scripture that he gave us as it's time I'm gonna hide you not only that not only am I gonna hide you I'm gonna keep you in the hour temptation huh I mean we got all these promises - no no it's gonna be all right glory to God Church nothing to worry about hey man it's gonna be alright it's gonna be alright if God kept Moses at that time a man God will keep you at this time God kept the prophets and God gonna keep doing this thing the reason that God is keeping you because you are a part of a vision a man and you must step into your place in the vision the reason Moses could not die because God had him as a part of the vision and there came a day that Moses had to step into the vision the Bible said I ain't tried it now after for 40 years he tried it but he got you only got one dead Egyptian after this for 40 years then he had to go to the backside of the desert for another 40 years hallelujah can you imagine God using a man at 80 years old 80 80 80 80 before he can actually move on to his ministry and many of us cannot just many of us have actually gotten ahead of the vision we're trying to step into the vision but sometimes you can get ahead of the vision hallelujah the Prophet told us this he showed us this how he was uh he went to the person Houston he Hannah that God had already showed him I'm off my notes God had already showed him that this boy was gonna be healing God already showed him say now this is what's gonna happen when you get there this person got to be here this person got to be there this person over here and say say that boy gonna be healed when you pray for him brother Brandon was so excited the father pulls up to the house and it's a brother Brandon minority been serving the Lord but do you mind coming to my house and pray for my son you know I know god I hear your prayer of your mind he says hey brother I don't mind I'll go with you right now and say brother it's your house like this and do you have that and do you have this in the house the brothers say yes women when did you ever come to the house brother Branham I've never had you at my house how do you know these things he said brother Jeff praise God I just left your house God took him and transported him in a different room to go amen and he saw the brother's house that he was in the vision spiritually in the vision but when he when he come out he said it's a brother who got this she got fans we got this and he didn't tell her brother so you know give you pretty son I mean he just say brother let's just go it encouraged his faith that something can happen here but when he got there he got ahead of the vision he got there and in here you know he took the baby and pray for the baby the baby had more fish than it ever had and he couldn't understand what was going on then God showed say look the reason that this term happened because you didn't wait on the vision Oh see and the reason a lot of stuff happening cuz people not waiting come on church hey man you got to learn how to wait hey man God God God's Word can not fall to the ground in return for but we must learn how to wait hallelujah we're too busy trying to make it happen on our own but wait on the Lord and be a good courage wait I say on the Lord he should've waited he said the only thing missing was this old lady coming to the house and everything god I got in chaos bro see I got to go to work I can't stay here no longer and brother branham say now if that man leave I'm have to stay here til tomorrow till he come back because he's a part of the vision hallelujah he's a part of the vision so I gotta wait for him to come back he say any and he couldn't he couldn't go tell brother Graham don't leave he couldn't tell him that he can't tell nobody nothing just had he had to sit there and wait just wait just wait so so why he waiting a man he saw brother Graham a man getting ready to leaving and right before brother Graham get relieved here comes this old woman walking a man behind the house come in through the back door and brother branham saying the vision she was wiping the glasses hollering she come and she had to sit in a certain chair glory to God our God perfect can I tell you sitting in the right chance to get chopped listen you are sitting in the right chair to get blessed Santa wait for the to come in and sit in that chair right them glasses and then sooner she did it he stood up he said my brother do you believe me to be God's prophet so yeah brother Brennan say brother I got ahead of the vision the last time I'm so sorry I did that I got ahead of things but if you bring your son to me I guarantee God with healing this time brought that boy prayed for them and and and and and he was ready he jumping out the hands of the of the daddy daddy I want to get down I want to go play brother Rams are gonna take three days here get better in three days but I guarantee he's gonna be perfectly fine and when I'm gonna come back in three days and he gonna tell me brother bill I'm all right now the vision was fulfilled but he got ahead of it and that's why now let me say two things there we get ahead of it we hinder it but we don't stop it even though he got ahead of it he didn't it didn't stop God was still gonna manifest himself in that way through the Prophet all right Church glory to God glory to God let me let me let me go on in this code I got two lines let's go on a little further here in this quote he was born in a very odd birth okay I see I see that he was born to be a deliverer like the Lord Jesus he was hit of his parents away from the enemy like the Lord Jesus and it come to his time of service like the Lord Jesus he was a leader like the Lord Jesus he was a prophet like the Lord Jesus and he was a lawgiver like the Lord Jesus and we find out that he died on the rock when he must have rose again and everything because 800 years later he standing on Mount Transfiguration talking to the Lord Jesus see angels packed to my weight no one knows where he is bear talking about Moses no one knows where he's buried buried even the devil didn't know that frankly I don't believe he was ever buried he ever was buried I believe that God packed him away and he died on the rock that he had followed all the days of his life oh I like that brother if I'm gonna die my down the rock what rock am I died knowing this revelation ain't man that God sent us a profit i'ma die on the rock when God called my aunt T home he called her home on a day to testify of what she was believing she died on the rock God called home October 7th what is that the tenth month and the seventh day hallelujah and God sent her revelation ten and seven she died on the rock and she left us with some good songs right hey man she finished a course in fact I put it that way she she she left it's gonna take a stronger wind in this my god my god hallelujah amen what church doors are closing what's that other one people all through the gonna take a stronger wind in this and it's already done right I mean all kinds of things the more that I surrender all of this auntie left us with some good stuff glory to God the church all over the world is still fellowshipping around the sons that she left us amen if I'm gonna die my died on the rock glory glory glory glory glory amen look at this he says he died on the rock that he fell all the days of life and he was a perfect type of Christ he was a king over the people he was a lawgiver he was a sustainer to the people he was everything and type that Christ was my lord my lord now this Moses had a very peculiar birth and I want to just go back and look at this in Exodus chapter 2 and as I you know I was just kind of meditating on this and I can't I won't read the whole thing but just a little bit as I was meditating on this it just I was just imagining what was really going on here glory glory glory let's just work with it just a little bit Exodus chapter 2 says and there when a man of the house of Levi and took the wife a daughter of Levi now as I was just imagining this a man I was just maybe thinking about this couple and how they got started out I can see Moses father and it's just my imagination right maybe being a little shy and man I don't really want to approach no sister I don't know what's he gonna say I don't I mean she might tell me no and I'm afraid to kind of approach her I can just see him being a little shy about this I can see maybe Moses mom was saying I got my mind on Jesus and I don't need no man of the tribe of Levi bother me right now come on somebody y'all work with me maybe there was all kind of things playing into this relationship but but no matter what their feelings are the emotions wasn't maybe who knows maybe the relationship might have went for a little bit and broke up and then they got back together again and the reason that they would get back together again because God had ordained through this relationship through this man and through this woman I'm gonna bring Moses oh I don't care how many Amen difficult times she might have had in her first two pregnancies because Miriam was born before Moses and Aaron was born before me I don't care how difficult those pregnancies were God had ordained that he was gonna bring the deliverer through this family through that boom praise God through that womb he was pregnant and somehow someway covered touch somebody and here comes Moses I'm just looking at this there went a man of the house of Levi took to wife a daughter of Levi now look at this and the woman conceived and bare a son and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hid him three months now you know we want to just kind of Lord just help me God we want to just kind of look at this a man because what was going on here at this time and in in biblical history the the the the children of Israel were there in Egypt and and I can't I think it yeah it was a quote that I was reading for the random sentence he said seem like in the households where the children of Israel were what we're living they were giving birth to children maybe one household would have 20 kids another I also have 17 kids he'd say but down in Egypt they'd only having one or two kids so now they've got a problem saying now wait a minute because uh you know he really got one or two and they got they got a 17-2 one he said this they're starting to grow so we gotta come up with a plan in order to minimize what these people can do for us so they began to put them in hard labor if I say persecution came upon the people glory to God and they were they were so concerned about how these people are outnumbering them and what they were and maybe they rise up in a revolted and all this and why they're trying to snuff out the plan here goes by Moses father praying to God every day Lord we meet a deliverer the persecution god with tyler going through this and we're tired of going through that father we are your people we need a deliverer and God not only answered his prayer by sitting on the liver God did better than that he made the deliverer come through his loewen's bless his household were the deliverer so here Moses finally comes on the scene during this time of great pressure they had this boy and they're they're nursing him feeding him but there is a law in the land say look we're gonna have to go ahead and kill because of the the the children Israel they all praying and talking about a delivered a they're looking for they're I mean they're I'm the expectation for say say they're all talking about say you know what we're gonna have to do something special we have to get rid of every boy that is under the age of two and they set this law in the land and so when they set the law they went running from house to house they had they had multiple things in place to try to snuff out the deliverer oh I like this they they first had let's find them to a number and then they said midwives when y'all go into the house if you find a boy being boy kill the boy Amen if it's a girl a lot of girly but if it's a boy kill the boy and they're in the house maybe the midwives come the very day that Moses was born oh I I hope you always stay with me and I know a man even if you've never let me put it this way if you've never really a man in Scripture like this praise the Lord you still say man because it's there is that I'm just kind of adding a little a little bit of my own imagination to it but it's there praise the Lord but not and and and the good thing about this is that I'm not going to leave it at Moses you just got to you got to work with me through Moses but I said peculiar purse I just say Birds I said verse so work with me here amen but by here here may be the midwives get to Moses them house at the time of Moses birth all this pressure they looking for boys they're trying to kill but when the midwives get there he was already born and they could not bring it to themselves to kill that baby so they told Pharaoh say when we get there the Hebrew women are not like us they already had the baby by the time we get there we just you know and here god bless simple because the things that they did hallelujah glory as we go on in the story Moses is born mama and daddy got him for three months but here the depressions on this seeking these boys seeking these was anybody two years old and I'm there's a boy got to die mama say you know what I can't take it no more they got this close to Moses yesterday she told she told us that we got have to do something different and can you imagine this can you imagine a mama taking her three-month-old child putting them in a basket that the daddy had made for putting it in a basket and just sending it down the river what face it took for that mama to do something like that now i'ma tell you when you got that type of pressure on you you don't know what you'll do hallelujah when you get to a spot like that where it's so much pressure you have no idea what you will do so we don't criticize Moses mama I do know this much that according to Scripture by her giving her baby up to them now God gave her back her baby because Miriam watched a little art go down a man threw along the Nile River and here this are in Pharaoh's court Pharaoh's daughter says I'm gonna take this baby amen and I'm gonna raise it like it's my own son God allowed the deliverer to be raised right in the home amen of their persecutor not only that when Miriam saw who had the baby she went running it's a do you need a nurse for the baby do you need a nurse yeah I need a nurse for the baby can you go get me one she said yeah I got the perfect person and ran back to my house and got mama mama you released the baby to them now the baby ended up in pharaoh's court with Pharaoh's daughter raising the baby and they need a nurse mama you got a job so God gave Moses mama amen a job to raise her own baby and get wages for it how many all been paid to raise your own children praise God but God did this to Moses mama because she moved by faith you moved by faith you don't know what God will do for you here you know this peculiar birth that happened at this time of persecution brother Branham say it was just like the Lord Jesus and and I'm up the next quote that i'ma read as the Ange of God so just get that lined up for me in a second he said he said just like the birth of the Lord Jesus and you know the Lord Jesus when he came there was persecution on the earth at that time and here virgin first of all just think about how peculiar is it a virgin conceit that's peculiar right a virgin actually conceived and and she bore a child she bore a child that is absolutely a man like I said before and I said again if there was anything impossible that's the one thing that should have been impossible but God did exactly what he said he was going to do in his word here come Jesus a virgin conceived bear child it was a time of persecution they they decided that they don't do some taxation in the land amen hallelujah raise the taxes in the land and in hallelujah glory glory glory and they did this while it was her third trimester right now why didn't they do why didn't they come up with this plan at a first trimester but here the lady at any moment could give birth to this baby and they come up with the law they didn't even care about her being pregnant get on the donkey and leave nobody cared ruthless people heartless people lived at this time and I want to tell you even in this hour the bride Amen is living there ruthless people there are some heartless people amen they don't care anything about anything all they want to do is push they're up there but their their agenda ruthless people not even thinking about the greater good of everybody else hallelujah but when we see things like this we can see the types of scripture if that happened in the days of Moses and God kept Moses if it happened in the days of Jesus and God kept Jesus when it happens in the days of the bride God will keep his bride look at this you know they they finally get to the land to the city where they want to you know stop for the night and when they get there there's no room in the end and have to go down to a man a stable and here in the stable our Lord chooses to be born in a stable identifying him as the Lamb of God amen because lambs are born in stables not in hospital roofs praise God identify him as the Lamb of God the other peculiar thing at his birth angels came down and starts singing because when Kings are born a man people sing but here the King of Kings was born and angels began to sing amen shepherds were gathered in there and watching their flocks at night and here they got an announcement from the Angels a peculiar thing happening separates him from angels say go and find the babe wrapped in swaddling cloth you'll find them a man in this table go down there now God had to you separates because Kings didn't want to go to stables governor's didn't want to go to stables amen important people didn't want to go to stables but a shepherd had no problem going to a place that he was fully identified hallelujah glory to God so shepherds came running from the fields to find him in a stable later on you know at the same time his verses another peculiar thing happened there was a star a man that was placed in the sky and wise men followed that star for two years till it brought them to the place where Christ was born peculiar things happen at his birth let's look at this going back to Moses here just little thought out of the angel God glory glory glory the Prophet says this says now who was he speaking to Moses many of you in your Sunday School lessons has read of this great Bible character Moses I like him because he was a shadow of the coming of Christ he was just a shadow of Christ coming now now when I read there in the scripture in the book of Acts chapter 7 there was a verse that said that the Lord would I'm gonna read it for you again just to make sure we got this I don't want to misquote it it was Acts 7 and verse 37 a man acts 7 and verse 37 the Bible says this says this is that Moses which said unto the children of Israel a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him show you here now clearly clearly that particular verse does speak of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ clearly that verse speaks of that however Amen we had the opportunity to look through prophetic lenses and we can see that even in this day God rose up a prophet that was like unto Moses Amen and that scripture could also be applied to that prophet today scripture can have compound meanings Oh hallelujah yes we do believe that applied to Christ but I believe it has a compound meaning to also apply to brother Branham we'll talk about that a little bit later on let's go on hallelujah look at this a man a man a man the same way Moses was given to science brother Branham was given to science Hollow it was it was it was a clear indication that God was using a prophet like unto Moses the same way Moses brought the Word of God to the people it's the same way brother Brown brought the Word of God to the people as they got all screwed up and mixed up amen throughout the ages God had to send a prophet to salute me too just to stabilize us and through the revelation of the word that has been given we have found the secret place glory to God that we can dwell in hallelujah glory hallelujah hallelujah amen now we can comfort one another with these words the reason we don't fear and the reason we're not afraid the reason that Amen we can keep moving on because we got an open vision before us hey man let's keep looking at this let's keep looking he says since a shadow of the coming of Christ he was just a shadow of Christ coming notice now when the people of Israel in Egypt and had come into bondage for four hundred and twenty years says which he had already told Abraham now this is this is important to me because we want I want I won't read it but I'll just give you the scripture Genesis 15:13 13 through 14 God had already told Abraham what was gonna happen to the children of Israel God already told him saying they're gonna go down this land they're gonna get in bondage but I'm gonna raise the deliverer so when Moses is born Moses is actually getting ready to be a part of a vision hallelujah I like that because I need you to understand when you were born you were actually coming here to be a part of a vision when Mary was born that's why I keep saying this the Word was waiting on Mary to get here oh I got so much I'm a Trotter I'm gonna I'm gonna get tall this the Word was waiting on Mary you know and even Moses Moses caught with his his his role was the reason Moses caught it is because his momma was teaching him his momma say now son you know you you were born to be the deliverer you would protect it from death you would protect it from this you protect it from that son you were born to be the love I know you inside of Pharaoh's house I know you there but God got you here for a purpose you were born to be the deliverer God don't make mistakes hallelujah amen every step it's ordered of God so his mama raised in Tulsa so Moses had that inside him that's why he went out of struct an Egyptian he thought that the people would understand what his role was he thought the people was ready but but when he went under trying to separate his brothers he realized they were not ready to receive him guess hallelujah glory glory glory sometimes you just have to wait Moses realized much after after 80 years not 40 years but after 80 as he realized now it was his time to go out there and do and God got brother Graham said God did more with that one man with a stick one man with a stick in his hand not not trying to kill Egyptians by yourself not trying to kill him buddies but one man with us yeah you come deliver him but you're gonna do it my way not your way Moses your way is to take out each Egyptian find them over here take them out burying final another one take them out there no Moses that's not my plan that's not my plan just just wait on me hallelujah glory to God all right let me let me let me keep going let me keep going amen sometimes you just gotta wait on the Lord wait on the Lord Amen hallelujah hallelujah and and now let me be clear we're not waiting for another messenger to come we're not waiting on that because you know sometimes you know people whether people think the people don't want me know now the question is who are you according to the scripture right then somebody else rise up saying that they got a message that's that's we know that that's out of the Word of God because it's only seven angels right if I ate one try to rise up we already know her oh no no no I'm sorry I'm not following that at all I got to read these quotes I got to read these quotes you know y'all bear with me because it's it's a lot here let's go let's go it says notice now when the people of Israel had going down in Egypt and that coming to bondage for 400 420 years which it already told Abraham that they would do when the time to promise true now then I want you to notice notice now how that when the time of promise drew nigh the people began at that time to see that there was something happening that something happened to them some troubles see in the time of trouble he gotta hide me right some some troubles and God look at this statement God always caused troubles mostly always to bring the people together now trouble is supposed to actually bring us together if trouble is dividing us there's a problem somewhere but what trouble is supposed to do is bring us together and God is the one behind trouble brother Branham said he but he takes trouble puts bits in its mouth makes it do what he wants you to do in order to bring people together all right God always cause trouble mostly always to bring the people together did you know that I'm gonna tell you something in the midst of this this right here this this this this this this this outbreak amen I've seen churches that ain't fellowship in years be able to fellowship because they concerned about their brother Oh hallelujah Amen Saints that might not have been able to fellowship they start fellowship for now because they concerned about their brother brother branham say pretty much when the trouble come that's when we find out the honey sticks brotherly comma sister honey this praise God thank God for this church the trouble is what brings us together look at this it says I believe there be a time when there won't be no more division amongst the people of God I want to read that again this is the proper sentence that there will be a time when there won't be any more division amongst the people of God such as I belong to this church and I belong to that church I believe the persecution will run all the big ransom Church of God together and will be one in Christ Jesus God I save man today amen and then he will take home so the persecution will drive us together hallelujah and then he'll take us home oh then he'll take a home if we can't get together now how are we gonna get together up there so the persecution is what's kind of bringing this amen the pressure is was bringing us he says and then he will take a home now we now we won't argue whether this doctrine is right or that he goes on and I noticed then that the at the at the time of the promised drew nigh there raised up a pharaoh who do not know Joseph and they put burdens upon the people when the people serve burden that they could not make the bricks and things that they were supposed to and then would you think now look at this would you think that God would play gets people in that manner I get made a they were clothes so stressful let me just you can take that down just for a second out just let me a personal plunk workload so stressful and you think brother branham say you think what God Plagueis people that matter because the first thing we say because I'm going through this can't be God this came to god I'm going through no no no that actually shows that it probably is God and I remember I was you know on the job and and and my lord the way than people sending me through where I was working in downtown and I that was my dream job to work downtown in a downtown I'm like I want to want to be like the geysers walk around New York and working in downtown but God didn't see me in New York he sent me to West Palm Beach and I was walking downtown West Palm Beach now and I'm working there and I'm and I'm just enjoying it and get this new boss and she said well you know what we're gonna send you out to the hospital I need you to work on a special project for me I sail to the hospital 45 miles out to Belle Glade middle of nowhere and I'm working on working on the project there and and and and and she got me working and and I didn't know why I was there and then the guy that I was you know out there supposed to be just kind of giving him a temporary reprieve for a couple days so he can get some time off he thought I was coming to take his job I'm like no I'm just doing what this lady told me to do and I get out there and and and man I'm getting calls two o'clock in the morning the system went down can you come fix it the hospital is is is essential so I gotta get up out my bed if I can't fix it over the phone I got to drive out to the hospital get it fixed come back home and then still be back to work at 8 o'clock in the morning 40 minutes each way no bad for me to sleep in out there I should have took one of the hospital beds just make me a patient but you know I mean I'm just going back and forth and you're thinking that not Lord what is this why would you send me through this and before you know it you know I got to a point on the job where the people got they got to like at me so much that they told my boss say please don't don't take him from here we got to keep him because he's doing a great job awesome job so she she said oh Lord night and went out there and tried pulling me off of the job back over here and I'm like what is this that I'm going through when I get here then she takes certain people from I got eight people to ever managing and then she say I need to have a meeting with you we're gonna take these four from you now what did I do nothing but God allowed this little thing to strike me in order to push me to where I'm at today had I not gone through that those type of pressures then I wouldn't be standing where I today look here I want to tell you Church I don't care what it is all things Oh things I don't care what you going through right now all things work together for good to them that love God and to them who are the called according to his purpose this ain't got nothing to do what your purpose this is all about his purpose your career and got nothing to do with your purpose this is all about his purpose praise God a man a man a man sometimes we look at things either from the wrong angle hey man look at look at this look at what look at what the Prophet goggle says would you think that God would plague his people in that manner he says yes for the Word of God is eternally true is that right and he promised he would deliver them and no other way he had to do it but this away so in order to deliver them they had to get in trouble in order to deliver them he had to have some ruthless people around amen to force him into this situation that they were in God had to Amen brother brother whisper made it made it he said he said God needed a dirty man for a dirty job that's why he that's why he allowed Judas to be born on earth not just born but imma let you get into the inner circle man I'm not known that you came you can't betray the Lord walking with the Pharisees Oh working as a ver see you got to be a disciple so you come right over here and I machine to church I'm with a message Jesus shoe the church let you eat my flesh drinking my blood you have no fur he should the church everybody walk by my and then the 70 that got ordained by Jesus say this are hard singing they say look you know will you also go the extra disciples and Judas was standing right there with her we also go act like he was a believer just say ain't going nowhere he soon as Peter say only thou had the words of you turn like I can see Judas a a me but within days Jew does that change everything and a sad part about Judas now I'm gonna be honest with you Judas had no idea he was fulfilling Scripture Judas accent out he was helping things out we'll get some more money for the bank account y'all gonna pay me this and I'm gonna take this and I add a little bit I had a little bit too the trench Judas had the money now I'm add a little bit to the Treasury but I'm gonna keep the rest of this he say because Jesus is gonna get out of this situation then realize that he was fulfilling the word he was actually stepping into a vision and had no idea he had stepped into it Church that's the way to be with us we don't realize when we'll step right into something hallelujah y'all coming to church you have stepped into a vision you're hearing the message of the hour you stepped into a vision come on let me let me let me go in a little further with this Oh God amen all right this he says this so says so therefore at the time of the persecution of Israel then God had an angel to come down to the earth but before he had the angel to come he had a little boy born down there by the name of Moses is that correct and this little boy Moses was born rather born a rather peculiar birth and then at the age of maturity he was sent out to deliver the children of Israel for they were in bondage and God told him before he went now says I'll send my angel before thee now God could have sent the angel down this is an important statement God could have sent the angel down couldn't he he could have left the angel coming himself but instead of that he sent the angel to speak through the voice of a man he said the angel to speak through the voice of a man God always used man for his work is that right he don't use organizations so forth and and he also and as a conjunction he don't use mechanic devices hope that we can shoot God what is the quote say God always if it's always that mean there is no other way oh the church can hear that I want to put emphasis on that God always amen amen I done lost my place here but I find it soon amen oh my okay right since our God always used man for his work is that right he don't use organizations or so forth and mechanical devices but he uses ma'am the Holy Spirit fell upon me the Holy Spirit did not follow your tape recorder Oh your your CD or your mp3 player the Holy Spirit falls upon me that's not my word but that's what the prophets say they're not the mechanical device not the mannequin God didn't call the mechanical device and I got you know people say got our ordained one brother just to play tapes why would God do something like that y'all don't cheapen my god got any ordained nobody to push play on a tape if he ordained he supposed to preach the gospel let's bring it back in line with the prophet see he did not ordain the Holy Ghost did not fall on a mechanical device the Holy Ghost falls on men hallelujah while Peter press PLAY that ain't what the Bible say while Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on there all right Church I told you I had to read these quotes I told you I had to read them alright alright stay with me here he uses men the Holy Spirit fell upon me and that's God's instrument here on earthnow I just I'm stopping there on that particular quote there's so much here I got I got I got a lot more that uh but I'm gonna just try to change a man just something I Oh Lord just bear with me there's a brother branham had a peculiar birth the Lord did something so special he was born in a household father was a drunk I was just reading like his life story again and and and they were just sharing how the data there's mama his mama actually a thing his mom and daddys mom was 14 years old and she got married to brother branham's damn she's living in Texas and her mother had died roughly about three years or so before she got married she was a very young woman had and she was the oldest of all the kids and she saw marriage as her way to get out of the situation that she was in some people do it that way they see marriage as the way out and actually when you see marriages the way out sometimes it leads you to a way in into some other trouble come on somebody alright our way of escape is Christ's Amen nothing else on this earth so she saw marriage as a way out and and she went running off and she got married to brother branham's dad and you know met him at a rodeo and she got married to him and and here she is 15 years old away from her family pregnant expectant in the very night that she's expecting brother branham's daddy took off to the to the to get his paycheck and and he was a drinking man so he stopped on the way home and got herself something to drink and he can come home too late that night and she was going through labor pains all day long waiting on you know the husband to come and just kind of work with him she just didn't know what was happening no she was there in the mountains by himself in his log cabin had no idea what was getting ready to happen no idea but she had nobody there to help her she's just sitting there waiting waiting crying like lord please send my husband home and finally a husband come home he got a little something in his pocket you know and he finally maybe they didn't really have lights but they had candles and stuff today with light back in that time and and he and he just heard his wife in there groaning he tried to just tip in the house but he heard in that moaning and groaning me like Oh Lord she said she said Charles Charles say this is this is it it's time it's time and he like he had just bought herself some overalls he like men I'm celebrating my baby being born with a new pair of overalls get that that's the way they celebrated they were very humble back then right you know I'm gonna celebrate this and and so he said she said go get your mama and and bring your mama because I think this is it tonight's the night and so he went down and got to mom and got back about our got some other people to come and said our mama had already had 17 kids so she should be a good Midwife and so here she comes and she starts helping her daughter-in-law and and and and and and they sent you know brother branham's father out the house while I was waiting on the baby to come in and happened to be in this month of April right that uh that this baby was being born and and here that morning April 6 1909 brother Branham comes to the earth and within 15 minutes of his arrival the daddy went and they really didn't have windows he said just like a would opening in the house and and so he said all he did daddy just went to just try to open and let the Sun come in Oh hallelujah but instead of s UN coming in the s OE n came into the room say that pillar fire came whirling into the room circling around say they had no idea what type of child this was this was a peculiar birth even so I don't say what this young and it's gonna be something special about this youngin a peculiar birth very very peculiar birth God gave that to the Prophet and now I want to just I wanna I wanna I want to bring this in let me just read this quote here God revealing himself to his people because as Moses was at a spot where the people couldn't receive him brother Branham also got to that spot where people can receive him as Moses was given to science brother branham was given to science so as I said earlier yes that Scripture does apply to Jesus yes it does but it has a compound meaning I believe it also applies this prophet now I got to read this and then I'm gonna get real fast on y'all because I want to talk about one other peculiar birth I talked about Moses I talked about Jesus I'm talking about the Prophet but I got another one I want to talk about now look at this guy reveal himself to his people oh Lord and he walked and he looked up to me with kind they looked pathetic to look at him he's talked about the angel the Lord this brother branham an angel Lord coming directly to him says he looked like he was a man well I just could not picture his characteristics of his character in his face he looked like a man that was sympathetic kind-hearted but yet he looked like a man if he speak it would be that way so I looked at him and he looked at me I was so scared I was biting my thumbnail till it was almost bleeding listen friend you'd be too you don't think you wouldn't and I was right like that he said fear not says I knew that was the same voice that spoke to me all alone that was the first time I'd ever seen it like that but I know that voice he said fear not I am sent from the presence of the Almighty God to tell you that your peculiar birth and peculiar life been always misunderstood with man so brother Branham got a peculiar birth he'll pick you your birth and you'll procure your life as always been always misunderstood with men said you're peculiar life and peculiar birth has been to indicate that you're to take a gift of divine healing to the people peoples of the world he said I'll be says certain and I said sir I cannot go now ain't that something similar what Moses God raised a prophet like unto Moses and not not just I mean Moses had a peculiar birth Jesus had a peculiar birth brother Branham has a peculiar birth you had a peculiar birth [Music] [Laughter] and I know you're thinking with me yeah you got a peculiar birth I'll tell you I'll tell you about in a second he said it's a prophet Moses was given he says he said I'll be with you I said sir I'm educated I said I could not go the people won't believe me he said as the prophet Moses was given two sons so will you be given two signs said first will be that you'll be able to detect the diseases by your hand taking the patient about the right hand a man in in your left and and if you'll be sincere when you pray get them to believe you and be sincere when you pray nothing she'll stand before your prayer not even cancer and I can just put not even covet 19c he spoke he spoke he spoke cancer that's the only disease he said he said then if you'll be sincere with that it'll come to pass that you would tell them the secrets of their heart saying them will be the two signs and he said and I said I would go he said I'll be with you and just in the light beginning to gather up and gather up to the angel and it got into the angel the angel went up into that little light pill of fire that you seen tonight and it went out of the room I didn't know what to do and I'm gonna just stop right there on that course I didn't know what to do so here that same pillar fire that came in at his birth that same pillar viola now is coming in to ordain him to go out with a gift into the land now brother Branham went with that gifting and where where am I yeah he went with that gift and it has blessed all of us it has I mean we're still standing on that now I'm going back to our thought that the angel the Lord gave a man to the prophet and pick up your pen and write let me let me go there I must say a couple of things and then we're gonna bring it home okay just bear with me now I usually read to you all out of this church age but today I want to read it from the spoken words original seat where he originally gay his thought this is where we've been getting stepped into the vision this is where because this is ultimately the vision so everything I'm reading to you is part of the vision that the angel gave up to the Prophet hallelujah waiting for people to come on the earth that will fulfill this all right watch the spoken words original seed she says now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb and I'm a think is on the second page if you turn the page over I'm there says let us stay like Joshua and Caleb now watch close this is going to have a spiritual background now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb it says as we see the promised land coming in sight it's nearing the time to be given Joshua and Hebrew means Savior and represents the promise in time leader to take the church over now right there two angels telling us that brother branham's ministry is a promise in time leader to take us over the edge was giving this time now look at what he also says Caleb represents the true believer who stayed with Joshua now that hit me after I read it again Amen justice week Caleb represents the true believer who stayed with Joshua that means that's me that's you glory to God and you know Caleb when it come time for them to go to the promised land Caleb had already walked on certain grounds Caleb had already seen certain things Caleb had already experienced the grapes in the land Caleb Caleb knew exactly what he wanted hallelujah when he went back into the camp and he told her people say say we're more than able to overtake them don't y'all fear though listen to the reporter these are the spots we're more than able to overcome them because if God be for us who can be against us Caleb had a different spirit hallelujah but there come a time because Caleb and Joshua was [Applause] this mountain mountainous one it might be your family your mountain might be your child your mountain might be your business you'll not - might be a career your mountain might be anything it might be cancer might be tired PT's whatever it is I won't the mountain so you heard God give me the promise there comes a day that we moved from just being a promise it becomes a manifestation caleb say i heard about this but i wont this mountain he brought ain't got time to go into what he brought me but I want this mountain it's time for us to stand up until there I want this mountain that that thing that seemed impossible you can't climb it you can't get over it that thing seemed like it ain't gonna happen I mean Lord I've

taking my mountain they say I'm just as strong right now to go to war if there's giants on this one I'm taking it he'd say remember the anarchists that they were talking about they live here I'm going up there to get them off my Mountain Caleb took his mountain and it's time for the that would Caleb represent the endtime believer that stood with Joshua and do you realize Caleb's get possession Kailas gets was not just possession they they actually get to claim what they want you don't get that they get to claim what they want Caleb's they can they can say this what I want I mean maybe maybe Caleb I mean the tribe that he was from maybe they're gonna get something no no no no no I want this because I brought back the right report amen because I said the right thing I want this I want my land to be blessed oh I want my children to be blessed but when she claimed this mountain she received what she acts carful I want to challenge the church you gonna see what you ask copper claim your mountain whatever it is claim it in Jesus name this is my Mountain this is my hallelujah glory glory glory glory Caleb look I'm following it's just to follow it there's promises here just trying to say I'm on Joshua's free no I won't problem promises a me glory glory glory and then then you know Caleb had a daughter I'm thinking see that this the spirit contagious I mean I mean cash she saw Caleb acts what sir I can act too because Caleb sinner who ever go up who ever got whipped me to give this mountain you can have my daughter the wife man this fellow said what man he got annoying it

Springs daddy give me give me these blessings Angie and what she asked for she got oh whatever you asked for a church you gonna get let me just finish reading this Oh hallelujah hallelujah look at this he says Caleb represents the true believer who stayed with Joshua got God started Israel as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different so did this last day church notice how God did not move Israel in tears on the point at time now listen you gotta wait and listen this this is going to mean something when you see the the parentheses like that this this is going to mean something that's brother branham injecting his thoughts he says Joshua waited for that time now no no how no matter how much people might have said God gave us the land that promise let us go now and take it they might have said Joshua you lost your commission you're all washed up and and how many people saying that today when you look you know you see all these different websites of brother branham's dis brother arms that no no no Joshua he loses commission ain't nothing go wrong everything was right right it says Joshua lost your commission you're all washed up why are you not doing something you used to do you used to know thus saith the Lord in a moment and what was the will of God but this wise God sent prophet the promise of God but also new to wait for that promise a clear-cut decision from God for his time see these parables now watch and when the time come God gave it to Joshua who is state with him by the word for he could not trust the others he could he could trust him so will it repeat then goes on says like the mighty anointed prophet Moses knew God would use him for he approved Moses to be a servant by his peculiar birth and at the right time that it deliverance for Abraham seat was at time he says are you getting it Moses never stayed in Egypt and argued scriptural points with them so brother Adam went to the wilderness he did not stay down in the Baptist Church arguing with his pastor he went to the wilderness waiting waiting for and what it is is the same way Moses went to the wilderness he had to wait for the people to receive him he thought they were ready but God didn't have him ready yet and there's people that we thought they was ready remember they weren't ready yet but this word coming right back around amen and typically is that at a time of pressure it's at a time of pressure when people a lot more open to hear what you got to say all right look at this says Moses never seen the age of menarche description points with them he never fuss with the priests but he went to the wilderness and waited on the Lord until the people's ready to receive him he had to come to testify of them but they would not receive him God called his prophet to the wilderness God testified he had chosen chose him but the waiting was not by Moses but for the people to get ready to receive Moses Moses thought the children would understand that he was sent and look what brother Graham said I never wrote it he did he talked about the angel the angel wrote these things the angel was saying Moses thought that the people Moses taught the children would understand that he was sent he said so is it now just like people didn't understand in that day that God was sending brother percent Moses people didn't understand today that God was sending his prophet according to Malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and 6 according to revelation 10 verse 7 according to st. Luke 17 verse 30 scripture after scripture after scripture supports this prophet coming on the scene and not only that if you just read his life story you'll see he had a peculiar birth just like Moses had a peculiar birth just like Jesus had a peculiar birth and I told you there was one other you had a peculiar birth you see brother Jack how well the Prophet told us that we were born in chicken coops I can understand why we look different while we act different while we talk different why we couldn't eat the stuff that they was eating because of where we was born he said but one day mama came screaming by with the Word of God and we could identify with what the mother Eagle scream was the mother Eagle knew she lost another egg she said I don't know where this egg is but I know it's time for birth I know it's time for so mama came screaming over this chicken coop just yelling and and here we looked up like mama Hymon where can we get up there you know we thought that we can't fly like that we talked that we can't go up there like that we taught that we earthbound creatures say that the momma said see screaming said son just flap them wings because it's it's in you to come out of that condition where you at do you know your resurrection is already in you and the same God that said I lay my life down and I take it up again brother Branham say that same God is dwelling you you can raise yourself up that eagle had to raise himself up even though he had a peculiar birth even though he was in the midst of some strange people yet he had something in him that could identify with a mother scream and when it come time to fly he flew himself right out of the situation he was in you know Eagles fly above storms geez that's why the storm don't bother the ego because egos get above storms bless it be the name of the Lord's God richly bless your church god bless you let's pray father God we are so grateful for your word Lord Jesus that has been given to us Lord we can look at these things scripture how an angel came to the prophet and God even gave him very specific words and well we look back at these different characters of Scripture and see how you have them come on the scene for a very specific purpose they were born to fulfill that lord help us to see ourselves God in Scripture that we would understand what it is that you have called us to in this hour Jesus [Music] father we're believing that the same God that manifested himself in the days of moves it's the same God that manifests himself even when you want earth yourself Lord Jesus it's the same God that's manifesting himself today you said you were hired us in your pavilion and the secret of your tabernacle your highness thank you for this safe place that we can go Lord we love you we praise and we thank you God for every promise that you've given us that's GNA man it will not fail thank you for your word Jesus thank you if you've given us a berth in this our God we can identify with the ROI that has been preached to us and as we learned this morning the same word that brings us comfort now we have to comfort others with the same word that's been given to us let us not be ashamed more to do two things that you've called us to do God let us be faithful in our calling we don't know where that last seat is so lord help us to reach out with everything we got with loved ones family members friends whoever it might be God help us to be mindful Jesus we praise you it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen let me just there was a quote that I was wanted to read to you how to recognize in your day in this message and let me just leave this myth that I heard this this week and it just blessed my heart the prophecy is not attractions not recognize her day like Israel forced back to Palestine she's going to be forced into the World Council of Churches he pressures coming why she didn't recognize our people come out of her be not partakers of her sin flee your life or you'll become with the mark of the beast and can't do nothing else about it that let's just connects right with the sermon this morning says Lenin that's filthy filthy still let him s holy not will be holy holy now let him that's holy not Bob hair woman she can't be he said she can't behold if she cut in the hair now that sounds very flat but that's the scripture bob says she dishonest a head and her head is her husband his head is Christ so she dishonest Christ how can she be dishonorable and not be filthy let's see that's got Bob here keep it and I look at what the Prophet said you wanted you want you know you're cut hair you keep on with your cut here she says let let him see that wear shorts kid wearing them Lee he denies the word keep on denying it but let him that's holy be holy still let him that's righteous me right - still the righteous Word of God the Son of God made manifest be holy still right - still recognized yes sir the church is not recognized today and I love this like Israel back in her Promised Land she don't know how she got back there she was just automatically oh thank you cheese Oh see that see he gonna hide us he's gonna put us in and it's in the safe place right he's gonna in a time of trouble he'd show how to us in this pavilion that's automatically that's automatic that's not you doing anything he says he says like Israel in the home I promise land she don't know how she got back there she was just automatically put back there Wow national force put her in her place now I'm gonna say something national force for Israel in her homeland Jesus glory national force amen we'll put the church in the World Council of Churches but the power of God will put the people in the bride and all this lockdown all over the world as national force but the power of God will put the people in the bride the royal forces this way and the world of course is that way but God forces upward Lori to God the spirit of God which is the word of God my way the spirit of life will put the blood in her place the Spirit of God of widows their church we got nothing to worry about because she'll recognize her position I like this she'll recognize her position in the word and that's what we're trying to bring the church to recognition of who according to the word hallelujah even as we've gone we started our journey through faeces that's the church trying to recognize his position and the word in the word and it's got to be in the word he says she'll reckon she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ we'll put her in her place no national force will do it but the National Forest did Drive Israel to the homeland the National forces of the Council of Churches will drive every organization into it but the power of God will raise the bride into glory out of it I say Amen national force is doing all that I mean they they had in one place it's the the practive under half Church and they threatened them so we're gonna have a you know somebody to come and they go they go shutting this down the National Guard coming down that's Augusta no we're not here to do that no we're not here to do that but national force will be used national force was used to shut all the countries down flashing force law was just enacted overnight just things that they they they said you know we we gotta exercise this right you know but when we
