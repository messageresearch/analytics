========================================
[Music] [Music] praise the Lord Happy Easter to everybody man this morning you want to open the service by reading the scripture she will just join me in reading Matthew 28 praise the Lord [Music] in the end of the Sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow and the fear of him the keepers did shake it became as dead men and the angel answered and said unto the woman fear not for a know that he seek Jesus which was crucified he is not here for he has risen as he said come see the place where the Lord laid and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and the whole we go off before you into Galilee there shall he see him lo I have told you they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy did run to bring his disciples word and as they went to tell his disciples behold Jesus spent them saying all hell and they came and held him by the feet and worshiped him then said Jesus unto them be not afraid go tell my brother in that they go into Galilee and there shall they see me now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept and if this come to the governor's ears we will persuade him and secure you so they took the money and did as they were taught the man is saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted Jesus came and speaking to them saying all power is given unto me in heaven in earth go a therefore and teach all nations baptizing them the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with You alway even unto the end of the world amen amen amen brother Josue would you just come and open up this

[Music] [Applause] [Music] I want to just just read a quote here and I didn't give this to you all in the back if you're just putting in a date of 65 - 0 for 1 8m for mourning and within that just look for the word do a dua L duel and it should bring us to believe paragraph 41 in this sermon I'm gonna start up a little early in that somewhere around paragraph 38 is where I started then once you find it there you can just pull it up on the screen give that 65 - 0 4 1 8 a.m. for morning and look for the word dua tell here the prophet makes a statement since then the Spirit of God as if done with love and compassion at that great day the first day of the dawn of creation upon the earth the Sun rose and swept across its Ray's and dried up the waters from the earth and made and that was fear above and for its first time it was to bring joy and life to the earth by the seed that was a great power says but oh it wasn't nothing that satirized like the sunrise on that Easter morning at this time with the Sun leaping into the skies it brought forth a greater sunrise than ever because it came because it came greater news with this sunrise than it did with the sunrise at the beginning this sunrise brought the news that he is risen he is quickened from the dead as he promised a man he's risen from the dead the first time the Sun rose in Genesis it was bringing a message that there will be life upon the earth mortal life but this time when the Sun rose a dual Sun rising another Sun rising it was not only the su n rising it was the som had risen to bring eternal life to all God's promised seed that by foreknowledge he had seen lay upon the earth we thank God for the dual sunrise amen the SU in and the som hallelujah let's say the course of this song worthy is the lamb and as we dis prepare to receive the word of the Lord today I mentioned to you all that this service man was I believe worth day my god man because I was I'm not one that dreams amen often I'm a very heavy sleeper but one morning I remember I was just sleeping and the Lord gave me a dream and he said sunrise service and then I showed me the preacher for the morning and that preacher was supposed to be brother Jerry and you know and I and when I saw it in a dream I start acting immediately and in I told her the Jerry about it and everything he said the Lord showed you that I'll be ready and you know some happy amen that he's he's he's here and you know gonna speak to her heart city and this whole week if I believe was birth around this like I said it's a it's a given you don't even have to think about whether you're gonna do a good Friday service that's just a given you don't make no plans for Good Friday but to be in church and you know so we we put that in and then I knew this morning I said but will also insert that Saturday night service the brother Quaker did a wonderful job come a Friday night and we appreciate him as well we had some church and ain't but a few of us but God has been good to us right man God thing good to us and the other thing I want to say to the church thank you all for embracing a man this time of fasting thank you for embracing these services thank you for your faithfulness and I pray that God would reward you tremendous sleep amen for the sacrifices that you have made and as we just prepare to receive our precious brother Jerry a man this morning les Cygnus course worthy is the lamb seated on the throne a man as we welcome him to the fulfil this Easter [Music] victorious [Music] yes you are [Music] oh say Jesus Son of God the treasure of heaven oh treasurer crews see fine were these [Music] Oh [Music] everybody signify your harm worthy is a lamp or we say [Music] his mouth [Music] dear Heavenly Father we approach your throne this morning father how privileged we are eternal that on this day you rose Lord God because you rose we have this day Lord God we come before you in honor and glory and we thank you Lord Jesus for your sacrifice father God we know this is the day that you have me will be glad and will rejoice you have ordained this day father so Lord God we come and we hide beneath your cross Lord Jesus then your word with having affected to our hearts that you would speak and it would fall on the grounds Lord God you know the needs of your people you know the hunger you know the thirst and you promised law that you would fill us so father God we invite you now Lord that you would take over God that you would pour his spirit Lord and provide your anointing God speak to our hearts this morning Lord Jesus and may once again you prove that you want everything we thank you and we ask that you would have your three minutes your Liberty in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen [Music] [Applause] I certainly am honored this morning to to be speaking on this day I think the day speaks for itself the magnitude of how special it was if you would turn with me to first Corinthians chapter 15 I'd start at the twenty first verse say a man when you're there now it reads since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order Christ the firstfruits afterward they that are Christ's at his coming then come at the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom of God even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power for he must reign - he had put all enemies under his feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death and I will read that again the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death for he hath put all things under his feet but when he saying all things are put under his feet it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be in all and all now if you would also turn me to Romans 8 and it reads if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you you may have your seat near the Lord out of blessing to his rear to his word now I just believe it's wonderful to know that the Lord has put everything under his feet but Romans 8:11 reads if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised the price from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you and if I could just use as a title this morning I would say the quickening spirit has not lost its power you see I think the greatest thing we we will celebrate is this very day yeah and the Prophet says a quote here he says he says this this day was the greatest event that ever taken place on the earth he says I don't think anything could surpass it you say well the crucifixion was great but many man has died many men has been crucified even the same days of our Lord but there was only one of them who rose from the dead and you see and reference that a quickening spirit I believe is going to take the same Spirit of God that fell on the day of Pentecost to be poured in into every believer right to break yokes to break chain so cause a release a bug cause a release of the pressure hose a release and you'll find it will unleash the power of the supernatural to make a bride ready for the wrath and I think about the Christian experience it's the experience of the resurrection because the resurrection is here so you can be a witness if you have been experienced Christianity right you you have any spares Christianity until you have experienced the resurrection and and I did a simple search on the word resurrection out of curiosity and and just to see what would Google had to say and it's commonly known as the rising of the dead now Christ ain't only come to die but in that he rose again he would restore life and you know there's something interesting about the restoration of life and what is it to have life is to be in existence but what's the point of existing without a purpose now the purpose is to be quickly and and and there's a difference between life and eternal life I believe your existence was purposed to bear record with his presence so this presence can quicken your existence but before you can be quicken you need a crucifixion and it's the same reason why Paul says I died a believer we need to be proofs if I'd in our lives so that we can be quickened in the spirit in other words we need to first die before we can be made in effect of the quickening power of his fear and you see Paul even says in 1 Corinthians same chapter 36 verse he says thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it does so when your spirit is planted in Christ your flesh must die and I believe what brings the spirit life is the Word of God alright quickened by the Spirit of God and when the Word of God can find a dwelling place in your heart it should abide there for the very purpose of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost needs a dwelling place profit those are to say here he says I believe that Pentecost began without an ending I believe it's to be the very that I believe it's to every creature all times at all places that Pentecost should always remain the Pentecostal blessing should be upon the people and now what is the Pentecostal blessing it's the confirmation of the resurrection right now it's the spirit that quickens it's not the word that quickens it's the spirit that quickens the word or gives the word life gives it wings to fly gives it access it's the spirit that does that and I want you to know church you are a living testament that he is alive today because he lives on the inside is that right wherever you go what shall proceed you is your testimony that's right it's your experience that has been renewed by his resurrection and when you come from the Word of God every word has to find a resting place as a paragraph 45 prophet says I'm wondering today it's what's happening are we really getting the people to God or are we just getting them to the church we must get them to church where this quickening power it's good to go Church sewer but if that's as far as we go it's not far enough when you come to church that's good but going on to price from the church because we must receive this quickening power if we ever expect to be in that general resurrection because it's the only thing that will ever bring us from the dead for if this spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you right it also quicken make bring your life your mortal bodies to life water promised to us and there's a seed in you and that seed was planted from the very beginning that seed is in you for divine purpose then a seed is what came from the very mind of God they see your birthplace is not on earth your birthplace is not even in heaven but your birthplace took place at the very beginning what was at the very beginning and Saint John the 1st chapter says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and in the beginning the Prophet says the Great Spirit he wasn't even God he was the eternal one God is an object of worship he had nothing to worship Him there was no angels no nothing just got alone him alone is eternal but in order to be God there had to be something to worship Him so he created angels and beings and cherubims and so forth to worship Him his great plan beginning to unfold began to unfold but remember you and the statue that you are in this morning if you wasn't in his thinking then you're not now there's some part of you that's eternal and eternal only belongs to God and in God was thinking of setting right of you sitting right here this morning and his thinking I stood at the pulpit this morning because he's infinite and knows all things and and you see I will when you when you come from God you go back to God that's according to the scripture and when you can recognize your origin then you can find your destination because where you come from will determine where you go and I'm not speaking of an earthly perspective because I'm sure everyone here has a different background right right but that is by no means an indication that you are a product of your past but to look further ahead you are a manifestation of an eternal purpose and later on in age there's so many promises that God is made to us and with these promises we have access to them and what good is a promise if you have no access to it what good is a check if you can't cash it right and what good is the sacrifice of the Lamb if it is not accepted all right you see Jesus was predestinated before the foundation of the world to die for our sins and Jesus didn't just come to be a sacrifice but through the sacrifice he would redeem those that received a word and be quickened by the spirit paragraph 57 it reads and now if the same spirit that was upon him to be the Redeemer in that age that we have accepted now the promise ended in the last days what would take place if we become part of the word you are redeemed with him because the same spirit that dwells in Christ is dwelling in you quickening your life to this age and it it'll also in the end time quicken your mortal bodies resurrect them bring them up again now what effect does the spirit that raised Christ from the dead has on you if it's out dwelling you first you must recognize its purpose this purpose is to quicken is to bring to life and then the Spirit of God can quicken your body your life it's all right a new birth a new experience right in first Corinthians for the fortieth verse in the 15 chapter it reads there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one in the glory of the terrestrial is another there is one glory of the Sun and another glory of the Moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory so also is the resurrection of the Dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in corruption it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown in the natural body it is raised in a spiritual body there is a natural body and there the spiritual body and I believe that this generation will be the ones to close the last pages of the Bible and you see God took a part of himself to create you he created you a finished product he created you an overcomer he created you knowing that you were going to be sealed with the Holy Ghost and being sealed with the Holy Ghost having a predestinated scene and when when you can live a life having the seal of the Holy Ghost your body is a body of deliverance your body is a body of victory now God took a part of himself to pour out into you and the Christians filled with the Holy Ghost is a Christian that brings every promise of God to pass so the purpose in which that is sewn because there was a resurrection every aspect of our beings are raised from corruption to incorruption raised from this honor to glory right sown in weakness but raised in power now that's the power in effect of the resurrection to quicken your mortal bodies and the same spirit that wrecked that raised Christ from the dead that spirit has to have a dwelling place in you and how do you know when you have been quickened and brought by the spirit it will bring you to every to obedience with every aspect of the word and the midst of your beading scums victory in the midst of your obedience come perseverance and paragraph 86 reads now the Holy Spirit is here on earth looking out those individuals that God has ordained to life in this age and as soon as it finds it it does just like it did on Jesus Christ the great super Son of God who redeemed us all it comes down and takes its place and abode into the human life now notice brought the quickening power now the quickening power that come upon Jesus has quickened him to manifest every promise of the Word of God that day so does the Holy Spirit that come upon us in this day if it's not it's not the mockery Holy Spirit it's not the devil mocking the Holy Spirit but it is the real true Holy Spirit it'll manifest the promise of this very hour and you see the quickening power brings victory over you over the enemy there's a reason why the last enemy that needed to be defeated was death it's for the reason because the greatest fear of man is death and God had to prove that he could prove that he could finish the work that he started right and I believe you have to defeat the devil in your mind before you can defeat him in your actions the devil wants access to your mind but God wants access to your heart yes and I believe it's why David says God will give you the desires of your heart not of your mind you can be deceived by the influence of your mind rather than the influence of your faith when your faith is the foundation you can be inspired by the Word of God and when you when you realize you haven't hunger and thirst it's because you were created for there to be a dwelling in your heart and the message he cared for you the Prophet says why is it men thirst and hunger because when he is meant when he was made he was made and created with a little place in him that God dwelt to comfort him and when he shook his self away from God by sin then that place is vacant and that's why he's hungry for it reaching for it and you see the Holy Spirit leads to quick in that area so that it can do all that himself and I believe what the devil has access to cannot sustain your walking God but what God has access to can be used to do supernatural things because you are in omnipotent of God and when the Spirit has found you now that gives you that allows you to enter into a realm of the potential of eternal inheritance of God and when you can realize the inheritance of God that is your potential profit goes to say when you receive the Holy Spirit of God as God's potential waiting upon you that's already recognized you and he see in your sealed by the spirit of promise of God into the body of Christ when God looked down at Calvary and Jesus dying he not only died for his bride the body which is the word church the church that believes the word for the age whether its feet body head or whatever it is see its Christ bleeding and dying and God looking upon him saw his resurrection in the church and that is the potential when the Spirit of God can quicken our mortal bodies I believe that's the purpose that's why he rose he rolls so that the power that is on the spirit can be an effect to us today Church I'm here to say that the Spirit of God has not lost the quickening power and as I would come to a close I read paragraph 177 it says now let me show you I don't care if you're dead or where you're at the quickening power never leaves years and years after his death his meat and had rotted away the skin of rome's the skin worms had eat it up but they were packing a dead man one day thrown him in that bones and there was so much quickening power there till the man coming back to life hallelujah wait raise him up from the dead because that quickening power that was upon the sin of God never left and because heroes we have the power to be quickened because hero we have eternal security because heroes we can rest our assurance that we can live and when Jesus overcame death there was a shake in the whole world right the scripture says there was an earthquake right now I believe what happened on earth had a reflection in heaven and the resurrection is our greatest victory because his overcame the greatest fear of men which is death and the resurrection proved to us that the Spirit still has the quickening power and as I would come to a close I believe when the Spirit of God keep quicken your heart it allows you to enter into another dimension it brings you into a renewing of your faith or renewing of your victory of renewing of your spirit a scripture I'd like to read in Matthew 24 it reads says take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet reading from the first verse I believe it says for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilence and earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and he shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved a church I say that we're called to be overcomers the Spirit of God is what quickens to calls a persevering life to cause an overcoming life and I believe as a rapture stands on in the door at the door it is our positions to yield to the quickening power of the Holy Ghost may the Lord bless you days BAM Heavenly Father we thank you for your Divine Word we thank you for your divine purpose father God I asked Lord that every word that was spoken by your inspiration would have the same power that raised up Christ from the dead father God may we experience a true resurrection in our own lives Lord that our lives would be made alive through the experience of the Holy Ghost father God may you have control and dominion over our spirit over our purpose of our lives father because you live we can live and we can see this day Lord may you brought your spirit into our hearts Kai and Lord may you call ya'll a people father that we will be made ready that we will be found under the blood of Christ Lord God fill us with your Holy Ghost father may you revive us Lord may you cause the same meet Lord as it was in a day of Pentacost father Lord God may we have Fire Lord revival father God may Lord Jesus your resurrection guide would be our testimony daily Noah God we thank you for this day that you have read and provided in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I pray amen [Applause] god is good when brother Jerry came up to pull it would give us a scripture walked over to brother Quaker I said he wasn't here last night and he read your exact same scripture that to me is the mind of Christ that is in operation and just a small demonstration that he is risen a man that he is living in our band and was living amongst us Friday night and after last night after this morning my cup runneth over my cup runneth over and you know just just looking at what the Lord has done like I was mentioning a man that we we wanted to just have this weekend of services just just just for us right we we we did let a few things nobody in minutes see brother Jairaj miss precious wife amen there and he reached out to me and say brother Jiang I was there and I heard y'all say something bout a sunrise service yes yes yes we'll be doing this he said well me and my wife want to come I said brother this open everybody and we invited brother West Coast Church and brother Smiley's Church there's only two churches that we invited and and you know we just just wanted to do something here local you know and and I've been blessed just you know just what I'm blessed by is just seeing how the Lord is using the different ones just just right here in our midst so now he's just proving himself amongst us and it just it blesses blesses my heart a man it blesses my heart god is good god is real good amen when you recognize your origin if you know where you come from you remember the story that the Prophet told about the I think it was a bomb or something like that and the man come to get something to eat you say well you uh where you going I don't know just where were the wind blow around I may end up but where you come from well wherever the wind was blowing that's where I ended up the man had no destiny he had no idea of no identity somehow he loves himself amen in the wave of life he lost his way and you know and unless you can have like the brother said unless you have a origin you recognize your origin then and only then you can recognize your destiny and my origin as I came from God and I am going back to God and that's my destiny then nothing in between oh praise God my origin in my destiny nothing in between that will stop me from reaching where no sickness gonna stop me you gotta defeat the devil in your mind first and if you can't get them under your feet in your praise [Applause] because he lives [Applause] there's quickly power in this room to quickly do from whatever you ate whatever situation this Quitman power change to believe it you got to take these things and eat these things don't just sit in your mind alright this can't be a mental understanding right but but God is really trying to elevate this is you know what brother Troy's heart was a set of foundation of faith anything possible right when we come into this like I promised say I was gonna choke it but i'ma say it and I'm glad he said it said I was gonna choke it but I'm a safe and it's a man is I'm nipa tonight that's what he said and we'll meet again a recognize that church and start walking in that man this world won't be able to hold this do we have to go on a rapture cuz we would we would disrupt everything but we're on nip ative creatures because we're made in His image a man one of what a mighty God what a mighty God what a mighty power what a mighty God I don't even know what to do but I'm gonna let y'all go i see some of y'all got to go back home to change of clothes y'all in the unaccompanied church we thank god we changed things around typically every Sunday morning at 7 o'clock ever since we've been in this building and we've been here 12 years but the Lord gave us a scripture out of Psalm 63 and we'll read that as we as we close Psalm 63 is where we were we're with where we birthed this from but we come every every Sunday morning and we have a prayer hour of prayer here at the church and but this morning we changed it in this did our you know did the sunrise service and so so grateful for the presence of the Lord and your spirit just being here but our time of prayer was birthed out of the scripture it says O God thou art my god early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longer for the unit in a dry and thirsty land when the water is to see that bow and I go read so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary because I loving-kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless thee while I live I will lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when I remember the in front of my band and meditate on the in the night watches because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy Wings will I rejoice my soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand upholdeth upholdeth me but those that seek my soul to destroy him shall go into the lower parts of the earth they shall fall by the sword they shall be a portion for foxes but the king shall rejoice to God every one that's where if I am chef glory but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped and you know David said he saw God really that was the thing that kind of heard this because we the first day of the week amen and the first thing we do amen on the first day of the week has come and get into the presence of the Lord just through a time of prayer and you know we thank God for that I believe has been this friends to prayer wings of prayer that have been carrying this church amen and you know and it's been carrying us into deeper and greater things of God and and I believe that prayer has brought us here that we got to keep for him because God won't even take us brother this we just scratching the surface hey man we just scratching the surface we've got gagaga got so much more amen that he wants to do so we're on the expectation but but again we want to just thank everybody for just kind of coming and being part of this and we have one more service and at 10:30 today are normal Amen Sunday morning service and certainly everyone Amen is invited but we understand those that will have to go back to the home churches and take care of things they're want to be opposed to do to be understand that but we do thank you for being a part a man of this and just celebrating Easter with us we want to thank

Eric snow a man from Loxahatchee I said it was invited by Jared and man so god bless you mr. Harrison [Applause] it's just about a word for you dear God our hearts rejoice and what you have done and we realized Lord if there had been no resurrection that we would be without hope we're thankful for this time that we're able to come this weekend and that you've given us some services God I am blessed thank you for brother Troy to share with the Sun Friday night and wake up coming on last night and now brother Jerry coming this morning we did these things according to a dream and God as you as you gave us that we just followed and we obeyed and how we have been able to just receive from it God we believe that you even have a even something more in store not just this week give the Lord even after this weekend it's over there'll be more things unfolding and got our expectation is that as we bring this service to enclose but Lord we enter into the Sunday morning service we don't know who walked through the door but our expectation is that you would meet each one in a very special way all it takes is one words if there's a seed there it will be no again and there is nothing that can stop that sea from being go again hallelujah you're the same God that looked at the earth it was it was void darkness was upon the face of the deep but God you looked at nothing and you saw something but in order to make it something you had to speak and create so Lord you spoke let there be light hallelujah that light that came forth was the light of the Son of God that shine on the earth because the sunlight did not come into the fourth day and Oh God we say the same thing a man that you say Lord if there's any dark circumstance a dark situation is somehow to go through the dark time in their life let there be life and let that be the Esso and light that was shining their life God to bring them a man to life so we trust Oh God that he would use our lips that you would just continue to use this dis church let all this all the difference things everybody find in their places God we just appreciate it no spirit of jealousy glory to God a man no comment but everybody trying to do something to bring the bride closer to Christ Lord we appreciate this a man we know the devil don't like it but the devil didn't started and ain't nothing he can do about it worried to God every time he arrives this is he prays God will put it right back in its place under our feet because that's where he belongs glory to God so we trust o God that you would continue to get all the glory and get all the honor and get all the praise out of everything that happens in spirit and truth Tabernacle may we not take on an arrogant spirit hallelujah but Lord let us remain humble in depressives glory to God as it's been spoken to us we gotta a man just strip myself so we could be dressed in the wedding carbon of the word glory to God so we trust O God that you would get glory out of all that we do and Lord as we as we as we come back to the 10:30 service may the Spirit of God meet us here the Spirit of God fall fresh on each and every one of us is our prayer it's in Jesus name that we pray amen and a man can we give the Lord a hand to freeze hallelujah amen we'll have the brothers come to dismiss you if there any that do want to stay a man in the church feel free to do so man you can read your Bible and if or three or whatever you want to do will certainly do that and if it's uh and willing we'll just be here to service stars those that need to leave time to go back home and do the things you need to do but let's common expectation they manulis let's be here expecting God just to meet us in the various moves away god bless you [Music]
