[1:14] [Music]
[1:20] in the end of the Sabbath as it began to
[1:26] dawn toward the first day of the week
[1:29] Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
[1:32] to see the sepulchre and behold there
[1:36] was a great earthquake for the angel of
[1:39] the Lord descended from heaven and came
[1:41] and rolled back the stone from the door
[1:45] and sat upon it his countenance was like
[1:49] lightning and his raiment white as snow
[1:53] and the fear of him the keepers did
[1:57] shake it became as dead men
[2:01] and the angel answered and said unto the
[2:04] woman fear not
[2:06] for a know that he seek Jesus which was
[2:08] crucified
[2:10] he is not here for he has risen as he
[2:13] said come see the place where the Lord
[2:16] laid and go quickly and tell his
[2:20] disciples that he is risen from the dead
[2:22] and the whole we go off before you into
[2:25] Galilee there shall he see him lo I have
[2:29] told you they departed quickly from the
[2:32] sepulchre with fear and great joy did
[2:36] run to bring his disciples word
[2:39] and as they went to tell his disciples
[2:42] behold Jesus spent them saying all hell
[2:45] and they came and held him by the feet
[2:49] and worshiped him then said Jesus unto
[2:52] them be not afraid go tell my brother in
[2:55] that they go into Galilee and there
[2:58] shall they see me now when they were
[3:01] going behold some of the watch came into
[3:04] the city and showed unto the chief
[3:06] priests all the things that were done
[3:08] and when they were assembled with the
[3:11] elders and had taken counsel they gave
[3:13] large money unto the soldiers saying say
[3:18] ye his disciples came by night and stole
[3:21] him away while we slept
[3:25] and if this come to the governor's ears
[3:28] we will persuade him and secure you so
[3:31] they took the money and did as they were
[3:32] taught the man is saying is commonly
[3:36] reported among the Jews until this day
[3:39] then the eleven disciples went away into
[3:41] Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had
[3:43] appointed them and when they saw him
[3:45] they worshiped him but some doubted
[3:48] Jesus came and speaking to them saying
[3:51] all power is given unto me in heaven
[3:55] in earth go a therefore and teach all
[3:59] nations baptizing them the name of the
[4:04] Father and of the Son and of the Holy
[4:08] Ghost teaching them to observe all

[11:35] I want to just just read a quote here
[11:38] and I didn't give this to you all in the
[11:40] back if you're just putting in a date of
[11:43] 65 - 0 for 1 8m for mourning and within
[11:52] that just look for the word do a dua L
[11:56] duel and it should bring us to believe
[11:59] paragraph 41 in this sermon I'm gonna
[12:03] start up a little early in that
[12:05] somewhere around paragraph 38 is where I
[12:08] started then once you find it there you
[12:11] can just pull it up on the screen give
[12:13] that 65 - 0 4 1 8 a.m. for morning and
[12:20] look for the word dua tell here the
[12:25] prophet makes a statement
[12:27] since then the Spirit of God
[12:30] as if done with love and compassion at
[12:35] that great day the first day of the dawn
[12:38] of creation upon the earth the Sun rose
[12:42] and swept across its Ray's and dried up
[12:47] the waters from the earth and made and
[12:50] that was fear above and for its first
[12:55] time it was to bring joy and life to the
[12:59] earth by the seed that was a great power
[13:05] says but oh it wasn't nothing that
[13:09] satirized like the sunrise on that
[13:11] Easter morning at this time with the Sun
[13:15] leaping into the skies it brought forth
[13:18] a greater sunrise than ever because it
[13:22] came because it came greater news with
[13:26] this sunrise than it did with the
[13:28] sunrise at the beginning this sunrise
[13:31] brought the news that he is risen he is
[13:36] quickened from the dead as he promised a
[13:40] man he's risen from the dead the first
[13:42] time the Sun rose in Genesis it was
[13:46] bringing a message that there will be
[13:48] life upon the earth mortal life
[13:51] but this time when the Sun rose a dual
[13:54] Sun rising another Sun rising it was not
[13:59] only the su n rising it was the som had
[14:03] risen to bring eternal life to all God's
[14:07] promised seed that by foreknowledge he
[14:10] had seen lay upon the earth we thank God
[14:13] for the dual sunrise amen the SU in and
[14:17] the som hallelujah let's say the course
[14:21] of this song worthy is the lamb and as
[14:24] we dis prepare to receive the word of
[14:27] the Lord today I mentioned to you all
[14:30] that this service man was I believe
[14:36] worth day my god man because I was I'm
[14:39] not one that dreams amen often I'm a
[14:43] very heavy sleeper
[14:44] but one morning I remember I was just
[14:49] sleeping and the Lord gave me a dream
[14:51] and he said sunrise service and then I
[14:55] showed me the preacher for the morning
[14:57] and that preacher was supposed to be
[14:59] brother Jerry and you know and I and
[15:02] when I saw it in a dream I start acting
[15:05] immediately
[15:06] and in
[15:08] I told her the Jerry about it and

[20:19] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[20:21] pray amen
[20:24] [Music]
[20:26] [Applause]
[20:29] I certainly am honored this morning to
[20:38] to be speaking on this day I think the
[20:45] day speaks for itself the magnitude of
[20:49] how special it was if you would turn
[20:55] with me to first Corinthians chapter 15
[21:01] I'd start at the twenty first verse say
[21:11] a man when you're there now it reads
[21:16] since by man came death by man came also
[21:22] the resurrection of the Dead for as in
[21:26] Adam all die even so in Christ shall all
[21:31] be made alive but every man in his own
[21:34] order Christ the firstfruits afterward
[21:37] they that are Christ's at his coming
[21:40] then come at the end when he shall have
[21:43] delivered up the kingdom of God even the
[21:46] father when he shall have put down all
[21:49] rule and all authority and power for he
[21:52] must reign - he had put all enemies
[21:55] under his feet the last enemy that shall
[21:59] be destroyed is death and I will read
[22:03] that again the last enemy that shall be
[22:07] destroyed is death for he hath put all
[22:11] things under his feet but when he saying
[22:14] all things are put under his feet it is
[22:17] manifest that he is excepted which did
[22:19] put all things under him and when all
[22:22] things shall be subdued unto him then
[22:24] shall the son also himself be subject
[22:27] unto him that put all things under him
[22:30] that God may be in all
[22:32] and all now if you would also turn me to
[22:37] Romans 8 and it reads if the spirit of
[22:46] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[22:49] dwell in you he that raised up Christ
[22:53] from the dead shall also quicken your
[22:56] mortal bodies by his Spirit that
[22:59] dwelleth in you you may have your seat
[23:02] near the Lord out of blessing to his
[23:05] rear to his word now I just believe it's
[23:09] wonderful to know that the Lord has put
[23:11] everything under his feet but Romans
[23:15] 8:11 reads if the spirit of him that
[23:18] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[23:20] you he that raised the price from the
[23:23] dead shall also quicken your mortal
[23:25] bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in
[23:28] you and if I could just use as a title
[23:31] this morning I would say the quickening
[23:34] spirit has not lost its power
[23:38] you see I think the greatest thing we we
[23:43] will celebrate is this very day yeah and
[23:47] the Prophet says a quote here he says he
[23:52] says this this day was the greatest
[23:54] event that ever taken place on the earth
[23:57] he says I don't think anything could
[23:59] surpass it you say well the crucifixion
[24:03] was great but many man has died many men
[24:07] has been crucified even the same days of
[24:10] our Lord but there was only one of them
[24:13] who rose from the dead and you see and
[24:19] reference that a quickening spirit I
[24:21] believe is going to take the same Spirit
[24:24] of God that fell on the day of Pentecost
[24:27] to be poured in into every believer
[24:31] right to break yokes to break chain so
[24:34] cause a release a bug cause a release of
[24:38] the pressure hose a release and you'll
[24:40] find it will unleash the power of the
[24:49] supernatural to make a bride ready for
[24:52] the wrath and I think about the
[24:57] Christian experience it's the experience
[25:00] of the resurrection because the
[25:02] resurrection is here so you can be a
[25:05] witness if you have been experienced
[25:09] Christianity right you you have any
[25:12] spares Christianity until you have
[25:15] experienced the resurrection and and I
[25:18] did a simple search on the word
[25:19] resurrection out of curiosity and and
[25:22] just to see what would Google had to say
[25:25] and it's commonly known as the rising of
[25:28] the dead now Christ ain't only come to
[25:32] die but in that he rose again he would
[25:35] restore life and you know there's
[25:38] something interesting about the
[25:39] restoration of life and what is it to
[25:42] have life is to be in existence but
[25:47] what's the point of existing without a
[25:49] purpose now the purpose is to be quickly
[25:52] and and and there's a difference between
[25:55] life and eternal life I believe your
[25:59] existence was purposed to bear record
[26:01] with his presence
[26:03] so this presence can quicken your
[26:06] existence but before you can be quicken
[26:09] you need a crucifixion and it's the same
[26:12] reason why Paul says I died a believer
[26:16] we need to be proofs if I'd in our lives
[26:19] so that we can be quickened in the
[26:21] spirit in other words we need to first
[26:23] die before we can be made in effect of
[26:27] the quickening power of his fear
[26:29] and you see Paul even says in 1
[26:32] Corinthians same chapter 36 verse he
[26:35] says thou fool that which thou sowest is
[26:40] not quickened except it does so when
[26:44] your spirit is planted in Christ your
[26:47] flesh must die and I believe what brings
[26:51] the spirit life is the Word of God
[26:53] alright quickened by the Spirit of God
[26:55] and when the Word of God can find a
[26:58] dwelling place in your heart it should
[27:00] abide there for the very purpose of the
[27:03] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost needs a
[27:07] dwelling place profit those are to say
[27:10] here he says I believe that Pentecost
[27:14] began without an ending I believe it's
[27:18] to be the very that I believe it's to
[27:20] every creature all times at all places
[27:23] that Pentecost should always remain the
[27:27] Pentecostal blessing should be upon the
[27:29] people and now what is the Pentecostal
[27:32] blessing it's the confirmation of the
[27:35] resurrection right now it's the spirit
[27:40] that quickens it's not the word that
[27:42] quickens it's the spirit that quickens
[27:45] the word or gives the word life gives it
[27:48] wings to fly gives it access it's the
[27:51] spirit that does that and I want you to
[27:55] know church you are a living testament
[27:58] that he is alive today because he lives
[28:01] on the inside is that right
[28:03] wherever you go what shall proceed you
[28:06] is your testimony that's right it's your
[28:08] experience that has been renewed by his
[28:11] resurrection and when you come from the
[28:16] Word of God every word has to find a
[28:19] resting place as a paragraph 45 prophet
[28:24] says I'm wondering today it's what's
[28:30] happening are we really getting the
[28:32] people to God or are we just getting
[28:35] them to the church we must get them to
[28:38] church where this quickening power it's
[28:41] good to go
[28:42] Church sewer but if that's as far as we
[28:46] go it's not far enough when you come to
[28:49] church that's good but going on to price
[28:51] from the church because we must receive
[28:54] this quickening power if we ever expect
[28:58] to be in that general resurrection
[29:00] because it's the only thing that will
[29:02] ever bring us from the dead for if this
[29:05] spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[29:07] dead dwell in you right it also quicken
[29:10] make bring your life your mortal bodies
[29:13] to life water promised to us and there's
[29:19] a seed in you and that seed was planted
[29:22] from the very beginning that seed is in
[29:25] you for divine purpose then a seed is
[29:29] what came from the very mind of God they
[29:32] see your birthplace is not on earth your
[29:35] birthplace is not even in heaven but
[29:38] your birthplace took place at the very
[29:40] beginning what was at the very beginning
[29:42] and Saint John the 1st chapter says in
[29:45] the beginning was the word and the Word
[29:47] was with God and the Word was God and in
[29:54] the beginning the Prophet says the Great
[29:57] Spirit he wasn't even God he was the
[30:01] eternal one God is an object of worship
[30:05] he had nothing to worship Him there was
[30:09] no angels no nothing just got alone him
[30:13] alone is eternal but in order to be God
[30:16] there had to be something to worship Him
[30:18] so he created angels and beings and
[30:21] cherubims and so forth to worship Him
[30:23] his great plan beginning to unfold began
[30:26] to unfold but remember you and the
[30:30] statue that you are in this morning if
[30:32] you wasn't in his thinking then you're
[30:35] not now there's some part of you that's
[30:38] eternal and eternal only belongs to God
[30:41] and in God was thinking of setting right
[30:45] of you sitting right here this morning
[30:47] and his thinking I stood at the pulpit
[30:51] this morning because he's infinite and
[30:53] knows all things and and you see I will
[30:56] when you when you come from God you go
[30:59] back to God that's according to the
[31:01] scripture and when you can recognize
[31:04] your origin then you can find your
[31:07] destination because where you come from
[31:10] will determine where you go and I'm not
[31:15] speaking of an earthly perspective
[31:16] because I'm sure everyone here has a
[31:18] different background right right but
[31:22] that is by no means an indication that
[31:24] you are a product of your past but to
[31:28] look further ahead you are a
[31:29] manifestation of an eternal purpose and
[31:35] later on in age there's so many promises
[31:39] that God is made to us and with these
[31:42] promises we have access to them and what
[31:46] good is a promise if you have no access
[31:48] to it what good is a check if you can't
[31:51] cash it right and what good is the
[31:54] sacrifice of the Lamb if it is not
[31:56] accepted all right
[31:58] you see Jesus was predestinated before
[32:01] the foundation of the world to die for
[32:02] our sins and Jesus didn't just come to
[32:06] be a sacrifice but through the sacrifice
[32:09] he would redeem those that received a
[32:12] word and be quickened by the spirit
[32:15] paragraph 57 it reads and now if the
[32:19] same spirit that was upon him to be the
[32:22] Redeemer in that age that we have
[32:25] accepted now the promise ended in the
[32:27] last days what would take place if we
[32:31] become part of the word you are redeemed
[32:33] with him because the same spirit that
[32:36] dwells in Christ is dwelling in you
[32:38] quickening your life to this age and it
[32:40] it'll also in the end time quicken your
[32:43] mortal bodies resurrect them bring them
[32:46] up again now what effect does the spirit
[32:49] that raised Christ from the dead has on
[32:52] you if it's out dwelling you first you
[32:55] must recognize its purpose this purpose
[32:57] is to quicken is to bring to life and
[33:01] then the Spirit of God can quicken your
[33:05] body your life it's all right
[33:09] a new birth a new experience right in
[33:15] first Corinthians for the fortieth verse
[33:17] in the 15 chapter it reads there are
[33:20] also celestial bodies and bodies
[33:24] terrestrial but the glory of the
[33:27] celestial is one in the glory of the
[33:30] terrestrial is another there is one
[33:32] glory of the Sun and another glory of
[33:35] the Moon and another glory of the stars
[33:37] for one star differeth from another star
[33:42] in glory so also is the resurrection of
[33:45] the Dead it is sown in corruption it is
[33:48] raised in corruption it is sown in
[33:51] dishonor it is raised in glory it is
[33:54] sown in weakness it is raised in power
[33:56] it is sown in the natural body it is
[33:59] raised in a spiritual body there is a
[34:01] natural body and there the spiritual
[34:03] body and I believe that this generation
[34:08] will be the ones to close the last pages
[34:11] of the Bible and you see God took a part
[34:15] of himself to create you he created you
[34:18] a finished product he created you an
[34:21] overcomer he created you knowing that
[34:24] you were going to be sealed with the
[34:26] Holy Ghost and being sealed with the
[34:29] Holy Ghost having a predestinated scene
[34:32] and when when you can live a life having
[34:38] the seal of the Holy Ghost your body is
[34:41] a body of deliverance your body is a
[34:43] body of victory now God took a part of
[34:50] himself to pour out into you and the
[34:54] Christians filled with the Holy Ghost is
[34:56] a Christian that brings every promise of
[35:00] God to pass so the purpose in which that
[35:04] is sewn because there was a resurrection
[35:07] every aspect of our beings are raised
[35:10] from corruption to incorruption raised
[35:13] from this honor to glory right sown in
[35:16] weakness but raised in power now that's
[35:19] the power
[35:20] in effect of the resurrection to quicken
[35:22] your mortal bodies and the same spirit
[35:26] that wrecked that raised Christ from the
[35:28] dead that spirit has to have a dwelling
[35:31] place in you and how do you know when
[35:37] you have been quickened and brought by
[35:39] the spirit it will bring you to every to
[35:43] obedience with every aspect of the word
[35:45] and the midst of your beading scums
[35:49] victory in the midst of your obedience
[35:51] come perseverance and paragraph 86 reads
[35:58] now the Holy Spirit is here on earth
[36:00] looking out those individuals that God
[36:03] has ordained to life in this age and as
[36:07] soon as it finds it it does just like it
[36:10] did on Jesus Christ the great super Son
[36:12] of God who redeemed us all it comes down
[36:15] and takes its place and abode into the
[36:18] human life now notice brought the
[36:21] quickening power now the quickening
[36:23] power that come upon Jesus has quickened
[36:26] him to manifest every promise of the
[36:28] Word of God that day so does the Holy
[36:31] Spirit that come upon us in this day if
[36:33] it's not it's not the mockery Holy
[36:36] Spirit it's not the devil mocking the
[36:38] Holy Spirit but it is the real true Holy
[36:41] Spirit it'll manifest the promise of
[36:44] this very hour and you see the
[36:48] quickening power brings victory over you
[36:52] over the enemy there's a reason why the
[36:55] last enemy that needed to be defeated
[36:57] was death it's for the reason because
[37:01] the greatest fear of man is death and
[37:03] God had to prove that he could prove
[37:08] that he could finish the work that he
[37:10] started right and I believe you have to
[37:15] defeat the devil in your mind before you
[37:19] can defeat him in your actions
[37:23] the devil wants access to your mind but
[37:26] God wants access to your heart yes and I
[37:30] believe it's why David says God will
[37:32] give you the desires of your heart not
[37:34] of your mind you can be deceived by the
[37:41] influence of your mind rather than the
[37:44] influence of your faith when your faith
[37:47] is the foundation you can be inspired by
[37:50] the Word of God and when you when you
[37:56] realize you haven't hunger and thirst
[37:58] it's because you were created for there
[38:02] to be a dwelling in your heart and the
[38:06] message he cared for you the Prophet
[38:09] says why is it men thirst and hunger
[38:12] because when he is meant when he was
[38:15] made he was made and created with a
[38:17] little place in him that God dwelt to
[38:19] comfort him and when he shook his self
[38:22] away from God by sin then that place is
[38:25] vacant and that's why he's hungry for it
[38:28] reaching for it and you see the Holy
[38:33] Spirit leads to quick in that area so
[38:37] that it can do all that himself and I
[38:40] believe what the devil has access to
[38:43] cannot sustain your walking God but what
[38:46] God has access to can be used to do
[38:49] supernatural things because you are in
[38:52] omnipotent of God and when the Spirit
[38:56] has found you now that gives you that
[38:59] allows you to enter into a realm of the
[39:03] potential of eternal inheritance of God
[39:06] and when you can realize the inheritance
[39:12] of God that is your potential profit
[39:18] goes to say when you receive the Holy
[39:22] Spirit of God as God's potential waiting
[39:25] upon you that's already recognized you
[39:27] and he see in your sealed by the spirit
[39:31] of promise of God into the body of
[39:33] Christ when God looked down at Calvary
[39:36] and
[39:36] Jesus dying he not only died for his
[39:40] bride the body which is the word church
[39:44] the church that believes the word for
[39:46] the age whether its feet body head or
[39:49] whatever it is see its Christ bleeding
[39:52] and dying and God looking upon him saw
[39:55] his resurrection in the church and that
[40:01] is the potential when the Spirit of God
[40:04] can quicken our mortal bodies I believe
[40:08] that's the purpose that's why he rose he
[40:12] rolls so that the power that is on the
[40:16] spirit can be an effect to us today
[40:20] Church I'm here to say that the Spirit
[40:23] of God has not lost the quickening power
[40:29] and as I would come to a close
[40:32] I read paragraph 177 it says now let me
[40:39] show you I don't care if you're dead or
[40:43] where you're at the quickening power
[40:45] never leaves years and years after his
[40:48] death his meat and had rotted away the
[40:51] skin of rome's
[40:52] the skin worms had eat it up but they
[40:55] were packing a dead man one day thrown
[40:58] him in that bones and there was so much
[41:00] quickening power there till the man
[41:03] coming back to life hallelujah
[41:06] wait raise him up from the dead because
[41:09] that quickening power that was upon the
[41:10] sin of God never left
[41:15] and because heroes we have the power to
[41:19] be quickened because hero we have
[41:22] eternal security because heroes we can
[41:26] rest our assurance that we can live and
[41:30] when Jesus overcame death there was a
[41:34] shake in the whole world right the
[41:38] scripture says there was an earthquake
[41:39] right now I believe what happened on
[41:43] earth had a reflection in heaven and the
[41:49] resurrection is our greatest victory
[41:51] because his overcame the greatest fear
[41:53] of men which is death and the
[41:57] resurrection proved to us that the
[42:02] Spirit still has the quickening power
[42:06] and as I would come to a close I believe
[42:11] when the Spirit of God keep quicken your
[42:15] heart it allows you to enter into
[42:19] another dimension it brings you into a
[42:24] renewing of your faith or renewing of
[42:27] your victory of renewing of your spirit
[42:45] a scripture I'd like to read in Matthew
[42:47] 24
[42:57] it reads says take heed that no man
[43:05] deceive you for many shall come in my
[43:08] name saying I am Christ all these things
[43:12] must come to pass but the end is not yet
[43:17] reading from the first verse I believe
[43:22] it says for nation shall rise against
[43:25] nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and
[43:28] there shall be famines and pestilence
[43:30] and earthquakes in diverse places all
[43:34] these are the beginning of Sorrows then
[43:37] shall they deliver you up to be
[43:39] afflicted and shall kill you and he
[43:41] shall be hated of all nations for my
[43:43] name's sake and then shall many be
[43:46] offended and shall betray one another
[43:48] and shall hate one another and many
[43:51] false prophets shall rise and shall
[43:54] deceive many and because iniquity shall
[43:57] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[44:00] but he that shall endure unto the end
[44:04] the same shall be saved a church I say
[44:10] that we're called to be overcomers
[44:14] the Spirit of God is what quickens to
[44:20] calls a persevering life to cause an
[44:25] overcoming life and I believe as a
[44:33] rapture stands on in the door at the
[44:36] door
[44:37] it is our positions to yield to the
[44:43] quickening power of the Holy Ghost
[44:46] may the Lord bless you days BAM Heavenly

[53:10] typically every Sunday morning at 7
[53:13] o'clock ever since we've been in this
[53:15] building and we've been here 12 years
[53:19] but the Lord gave us a scripture out of
[53:24] Psalm 63 and we'll read that as we as we
[53:28] close Psalm 63 is where we were we're
[53:32] with where we birthed this from but we
[53:34] come every every Sunday morning and we
[53:37] have a prayer hour of prayer here at the
[53:40] church and but this morning we changed
[53:44] it in this did our you know did the
[53:46] sunrise service and so so grateful for
[53:48] the presence of the Lord and your spirit
[53:51] just being here
[53:53] but our time of prayer was birthed out
[53:56] of the scripture it says O God thou art
[54:00] my god early will I seek thee
[54:06] my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh
[54:08] longer for the unit in a dry and thirsty
[54:10] land when the water is to see that bow
[54:16] and I go read so as I have seen thee in
[54:19] the sanctuary because I loving-kindness
[54:21] is better than life my lips shall praise
[54:23] thee thus will I bless thee while I live
[54:27] I will lift up my hands in thy name my
[54:30] soul shall be satisfied as with marrow
[54:32] and fatness and my mouth shall praise
[54:34] thee with joyful lips when I remember
[54:38] the in front of my band and meditate on
[54:40] the in the night watches because thou
[54:42] has been my help therefore in the shadow
[54:44] of thy Wings will I rejoice my soul
[54:48] followeth hard after thee thy right hand
[54:49] upholdeth upholdeth me but those that
[54:53] seek my soul to destroy him shall go
[54:55] into the lower parts of the earth they
[54:58] shall fall by the sword they shall be a
[55:01] portion for foxes but the king shall
[55:03] rejoice to God every one that's where if
[55:06] I am chef glory but the mouth of them
[55:09] that speak lies shall be stopped and you
[55:14] know David said he saw God really that
[55:17] was the thing that kind of heard this

[55:36] have been carrying this church amen and
[55:39] you know and it's been carrying us into
[55:41] deeper and greater things of God and and
[55:45] I believe that prayer has brought us
[55:46] here that we got to keep for him because
[55:48] God won't even take us brother this we
[55:50] just scratching the surface hey man we
[55:53] just scratching the surface we've got

[57:27] God as you as you gave us that we just

[57:44] weekend it's over there'll be more
[57:45] things unfolding

[57:49] bring this service to enclose but Lord
[57:52] we enter into the Sunday morning service
[57:54] we don't know who walked through the
[57:55] door but our expectation is that you
[57:57] would meet each one in a very special
[58:00] way all it takes is one words if there's
[58:03] a seed there it will be no again and
[58:08] there is nothing that can stop that sea
[58:11] from being go again hallelujah you're
[58:14] the same God that looked at the earth it
[58:17] was it was void darkness was upon the
[58:21] face of the deep
[58:22] but God you looked at nothing and you
[58:25] saw something but in order to make it
[58:27] something you had to speak and create so
