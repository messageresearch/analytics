[46:03] announcements that we want to make
[46:06] mention of is also there was a prayer
[46:13] request that I wanted to just mention
[46:16] found out about this on the on the
[46:19] Lifeline application there was a
[46:21] gentleman that was a lack of missionary
[46:25] for voice of God a father of couple
[46:29] children and young man and they were on
[46:33] vacation and they were his son got
[46:36] caught in a Riptide
[46:37] and the father went out to save the son
[46:40] and he got his son's life spared but
[46:42] when the father got his son out the
[46:45] father got swept in and and he ended up
[46:48] losing his life there in a Riptide
[46:51] and you know this is like the second
[46:53] event that I'm aware of in the last year
[46:57] or so where some men of God have been
[47:00] swept away by water and you know we want
[47:04] to pray for his family a man that got
[47:06] would just give them strength and
[47:08] everything as they go through this this
[47:10] season
[47:11] I have a friend of mine his wife just
[47:14] had back surgery and and they've been
[47:16] having all kind of complications from
[47:18] the surgery it's fluid metal leaking and
[47:22] things of that nature and they just you
[47:25] know the doctors are doing everything
[47:26] they can just to kind of keep her you
[47:29] know but they're asking for prayer we
[47:31] want to remember them in prayer her name
[47:33] is Gwen a man so we'll take those
[47:36] requests before the Lord that we have
[47:39] any announcements we wanna make mention
[47:40] of here quickly
[47:42] [Music]
[47:43] sister Zion be celebrating the birthday
[47:46] on Wednesday so happy birthday that's
[47:49] just a Zion a man we certainly thank the
[47:52] Lord for that also brother Quentin he's
[47:56] actually coming back on Tuesday
[47:58] he'll be back home on Tuesday and his
[48:01] birthday is on Thursday the 19th so will
[48:03] we certainly thank God for allowing both
[48:06] of them to see another year a man that
[48:09] this this Tuesday night sisters will be
[48:13] here at prayer amen at 7:30 all the
[48:16] sisters are invited to come a man and
[48:19] participate in the prayer service and
[48:21] man on Tuesday at 7:30
[48:24] also don't forget next Sunday the
[48:27] pinnacle Palms service will happen at
[48:30] 5:30 next time get pinnacle Palms and I
[48:33] forgot to mention this but just
[48:35] yesterday they did change to combine
[48:38] services that will be held at rapture
[48:41] and faith they've changed it it's gotta
[48:42] happen on Sunday the 29th rather than
[48:44] next Sunday so to be the last Sunday
[48:47] this month that they're going to be
[48:47] doing that at brother westcoast church
[48:49] sunday the 29th and don't forget the
[48:53] 10th meetings that's coming up we'll be
[48:54] going out to Okeechobee Florida there
[48:57] with brother smiley and the church their
[48:59] Bible truth tabernac we'll be having our
[49:01] first 10 meeting
[49:03] to be held there on a Friday night and
[49:05] on a Saturday night
[49:08] it's Friday 27th and saturday 28th at
[49:11] 7:30 we have invited a number of
[49:13] churches around so we're expecting this
[49:16] believers as well as we're expecting
[49:19] amen
[49:20] those that don't know the Lord to them
[49:22] come walking through there and you know
[49:24] we want to be very attentive to that and
[49:26] I'll be praying for that because we want
[49:28] to see God just bring deliverance to his
[49:31] people our theme a man for these
[49:34] services is light the fire again
[49:37] amen light the fire again and there's a
[49:39] quote that I've listed on the back of
[49:41] our forms there that I had first to give
[49:44] out and it just kind of talks about how
[49:47] you know God moves in a particular
[49:49] generation and then you know I mean that
[49:52] generation is on fire and then that fire
[49:55] is actually affecting the next
[49:56] generation but once it gets to about the
[49:58] third or fourth generation down he says
[50:01] the fire begins to go out until it's
[50:03] just embers it's just this embers until
[50:06] God likes to fire again and and I feel
[50:09] like we have entered into the season
[50:11] where we see just embers and we're doing
[50:14] everything we can in order to see God
[50:16] like the fire again
[50:17] a man we need Holy Ghost fires a man it
[50:22] keeps us all clean keeps the church
[50:24] clean over when we're all amen operating
[50:28] underneath and man the presence of God
[50:30] so just keep that in mind
[50:33] amen and whether it's whether it's
[50:35] backsliders that come let not light the
[50:38] fire can even some of us need to go and
[50:40] get on fire real it again all right and
[50:42] you know and even for the church there's
[50:45] no controlling more like the fire again
[50:47] so we were just under expectation that
[50:49] God's going to do something mighty force
[50:51] and we want to approach those services
[50:52] with prayer if you want to fast a man
[50:56] for them I'm sure that that would be
[50:58] appreciated they men but we're just
[51:00] expecting God to move in a very special
[51:02] way praise the Lord so that's thumb that
[51:06] concludes the announcements will have
[51:09] the brothers also prepare to come for
[51:11] this morning Tizen offering and while
[51:13] we're praying over the Tizen off from a
[51:15] previous request amen that we have as

[1:00:24] about how when you're going through
[1:00:27] trials and tribulations if you're a
[1:00:30] songwriter that's where God actually
[1:00:31] gives you your your songs is through
[1:00:33] your trial and often times a man you
[1:00:37] think the song is for you during your
[1:00:38] trial but actually what variety it was
[1:00:41] let you go through something to give a
[1:00:43] song for a trial that become a much
[1:00:46] later alright maybe 20 years later but
[1:00:50] that song would be right there to
[1:00:53] minister to the need that some say

[1:01:02] that I walk away I mean mama didn't know

[1:07:11] Lord I just remember the Johnson family

[1:07:16] little vacation and I think that's
[1:07:18] that's needful amen for for everybody at
[1:07:22] different times try to get yourself a
[1:07:24] little rest or vacation a man and you
[1:07:28] know I think I think it's it's just
[1:07:29] always very appropriate just just only
[1:07:32] thing I accept you don't do is when it's
[1:07:34] like a big service get ready to come up
[1:07:37] don't plan for vacation on the big
[1:07:39] service time right that's one we want
[1:07:41] all hands on deck so you can take the
[1:07:44] vacation after the big service right or
[1:07:46] before the big service but don't do it
[1:07:48] oh you know the same week that we've
[1:07:50] been announcing this for 14 weeks all
[1:07:53] right so don't don't do it like that aid
[1:07:55] man praise the Lord but but we just
[1:07:57] thank God for all things I'm gonna read
[1:07:59] a man a couple scriptures
[1:08:02] I feel the sermon that I'm a priest
[1:08:05] today is something that I know the Lord
[1:08:07] Lord have didn't want me to preach this
[1:08:09] a long time ago
[1:08:10] and and I felt like I might have failed
[1:08:12] the Lord and not preaching this a man
[1:08:15] but uh but now I want to just kind of
[1:08:18] touch this but there's so many different
[1:08:20] angles a man that we can hit from this
[1:08:23] and I'm just praying that the Lord help
[1:08:24] us to find where where
[1:08:26] where we supposed to be but I've been
[1:08:28] telling you all for a while that I had a
[1:08:30] sermon on containment a man containment
[1:08:34] and I want a minister on that today so
[1:08:36] I'm gonna read this out of numbers 12
[1:08:39] and verse 10 through I think I got 10
[1:08:47] through 16 praise the Lord
[1:08:52] numbers 12 verse 10 through 16 a man and
[1:08:57] it says this and the cloud departed from
[1:09:01] off the tabernacle and the whole Miriam
[1:09:04] became leprous whitest know and Aaron
[1:09:08] looked upon Miriam and behold she was
[1:09:11] lepers and Aaron said unto Moses alas my
[1:09:15] lord I beseech thee late not to stand
[1:09:17] upon us wherein we have done foolishly
[1:09:19] and wherein we have sinned let her not
[1:09:23] be as one day of whom the flesh is half
[1:09:26] consumed when it cometh out of his
[1:09:29] mother's womb and Moses cried unto the
[1:09:31] Lord saying heal her now o God I beseech
[1:09:34] thee and the Lord said unto Moses if a
[1:09:37] father had but spit in her face should
[1:09:40] she not be ashamed 7 days
[1:09:43] let her be shut out from the camp seven
[1:09:46] days and after that let her be received
[1:09:49] in again and Miriam was shut out from
[1:09:52] the camp seven days and the people
[1:09:55] journey not til Miriam was brought in
[1:09:58] again and after what the people removed
[1:10:01] from hazarat and pitched in the
[1:10:03] wilderness of Iran a man the Lord and a
[1:10:07] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:10:09] can be seated
[1:10:10] Amen here in the presence of the Lord I
[1:10:15] have a couple things that I just want to
[1:10:19] try to make mention we'll see how the
[1:10:21] Lord just kind of brings this all all
[1:10:23] together a man we want to talk on this
[1:10:30] this thing of containment and just
[1:10:34] quickly you know looking at the
[1:10:37] scripture that we just read this
[1:10:40] you know there was there was something
[1:10:44] happened here where Miriam a man ended
[1:10:48] up actually becoming leprous alright
[1:10:53] that this uh and and just so that we we
[1:10:55] we understand what calls the leprosy and
[1:10:59] Miriam's case was that Miriam
[1:11:02] began to criticize God's servant a man I
[1:11:10] want you all to stay with me on this
[1:11:12] Miriam begins to criticize my like
[1:11:14] Miriam but Aaron also began to criticize
[1:11:17] God's servant now now understand
[1:11:20] Moses was Miriam's younger brother Moses
[1:11:25] was Aaron's younger brother a man but
[1:11:29] but what they fail to be able to do a
[1:11:33] man is actually separate right their
[1:11:38] younger brother from being the servant
[1:11:41] of God not just the servant of God but
[1:11:43] being a prophet of God right and here
[1:11:46] they are you know if you were read that
[1:11:48] the beginning part that chapter they
[1:11:50] were they were talking amongst
[1:11:51] themselves criticizing and and one of
[1:11:53] the things that that was said a man in
[1:11:57] verse two of that stain chapter they
[1:11:59] said half the Lord indeed spoken only by
[1:12:03] Moses happy not spoken also by us and
[1:12:09] the Bible say the Lord heard it right so
[1:12:11] so here here there there there they're
[1:12:13] criticizing Moses now now I want y'all
[1:12:15] to catch something here this is numbers
[1:12:17] 12 a man that Amen that this is spoken
[1:12:21] and they're saying half the Lord indeed
[1:12:23] spoken only by Moses hath he not smoke
[1:12:27] spoken also by us and yes God they used
[1:12:31] him yes there were there were plenty of
[1:12:33] times where I mean I mean Miriam was
[1:12:35] actually considered a prophetess so God
[1:12:37] didn't use or God they used air and God
[1:12:40] God used them but gosh they had a
[1:12:42] special place for Moses amen
[1:12:45] now now here's the thing that I want you
[1:12:46] to catch this is numbers 12 but when you
[1:12:48] get over amen in the Book of Numbers
[1:12:50] amen you get over into amen I believe
[1:12:54] it might be us chapter 16 and and things
[1:12:58] like that you know Cora comes up and
[1:13:02] Cora makes a similar statement and in
[1:13:06] verse three in chapter 16 verse 3 Paul
[1:13:08] says and they gather themselves together
[1:13:10] against Moses lie and against Aaron and
[1:13:14] said unto them you take too much upon
[1:13:17] you seeing all the congregation are holy
[1:13:19] and then every one of them and the Lord
[1:13:22] is among them let wherefore then lift ye
[1:13:24] up yourselves above the congregation a
[1:13:26] man of the Lord so now here what color
[1:13:29] is doing if it's kind of trying to put
[1:13:31] Moses on the same platform a plateau as
[1:13:35] everybody else hallelujah I hope y'all
[1:13:38] stay with me on this the car car is
[1:13:40] trying to a man belittle Moses as
[1:13:43] ministry and then cross trying to
[1:13:46] counter dumb it down and make it make it
[1:13:48] seem like it's nothing but but but I
[1:13:50] want you understand in numbers 12 that
[1:13:53] spirit started and more and Moses family
[1:13:58] numbers 12 Korah got ahold of it Oh God
[1:14:01] Korah got hold of it but that thing
[1:14:04] started with Miriam and with Aaron you
[1:14:09] see and notice now when it started with
[1:14:12] Mira Nair Aaron God came down corrected
[1:14:15] man and Aaron he told sin now now and
[1:14:18] you know back over in numbers 12 let me
[1:14:20] just you know just kind of will work
[1:14:21] with this here just a little bit just
[1:14:24] the Bible say this a man I want to I
[1:14:27] want to just stay with me here a man
[1:14:29] says I'm a verse 5 I'm back at numbers
[1:14:33] 12 verse 5 it says so the Lord came down
[1:14:35] in the pillar of the cloud and stood in
[1:14:37] the door the tavern I can call Aaron and
[1:14:39] Miriam and they both they both came
[1:14:40] forth now before I go too much further
[1:14:43] net I wanted all we're always we also
[1:14:45] remember they are criticizing Moses for
[1:14:49] the woman that he married right they're
[1:14:52] criticizing Moses because he married an
[1:14:54] Ethiopian okay and him being an
[1:14:56] Israelite they're criticizing his
[1:14:58] marriage okay
[1:14:59] now now now you know not his revelation
[1:15:06] not-not-not is understanding of alert -
[1:15:10] teaching own godheads night is teaching
[1:15:15] on water baptism but but they got they
[1:15:18] got other little things that they coming
[1:15:20] up with but they're criticizing that God
[1:15:22] heard it
[1:15:24] stay with me here today all right you
[1:15:27] know because the same spirit is
[1:15:28] repeating in the land today okay and I
[1:15:30] so so here in verse five says and the
[1:15:32] Lord came down in the pillar of cloud
[1:15:33] and stood in the door of the tabernacle
[1:15:35] call Aaron and Miriam and they both came
[1:15:37] forth and they said here now my words if
[1:15:40] there be a prophet among you I the Lord
[1:15:43] will make myself known unto him in a
[1:15:45] vision and will speak unto him in a
[1:15:48] dream but says my servant Moses is not
[1:15:51] so who is faith when all my house so no
[1:15:55] matter how much the other people trying
[1:15:56] to belittle Moses ministry God was
[1:15:59] exalting it they said my servant Moses
[1:16:02] is not so was faithful on my house with
[1:16:05] him will I speak mouth to mouth even
[1:16:08] apparently and not in dark speeches and
[1:16:10] the Simla tune of the Lord shall be
[1:16:12] about behold well for them were you not
[1:16:15] afraid to speak against my servant Moses
[1:16:17] and the anger of the Lord was kindled
[1:16:19] against him and he departed as we just
[1:16:22] read what happened after dang the Lord
[1:16:24] was kinder pon them when the glory to
[1:16:27] lifted up they looked install a Miriam
[1:16:30] was lepers now she wasn't left wrist
[1:16:33] before the pallet that this was the
[1:16:35] Spirit of God came down but when the
[1:16:37] Spirit of God came down and lift that
[1:16:38] they found out that she was left with
[1:16:39] Aaron diagnosed that she was lepers and
[1:16:43] here God you know God had that upside
[1:16:45] now what when a person is leprous what
[1:16:47] you have to do is actually isolate them
[1:16:51] alright now why why are they being
[1:16:56] isolated why it's containment
[1:17:00] Oh y'all stay with me here I I want to
[1:17:04] just kind of talk to y'all just a little
[1:17:05] bit about this if I can its containment
[1:17:10] its containment because leprous well I
[1:17:13] mean when a person was actually full of
[1:17:15] leprosy
[1:17:16] what I mean they became
[1:17:18] just right and in order to contain it so
[1:17:23] that other people are not introduced to
[1:17:25] it right then they had to isolate the
[1:17:28] person now notice notice now here
[1:17:30] another person goes into isolation they
[1:17:33] meant they not to stay there they they
[1:17:38] may have to go there but they're not to
[1:17:41] stay there if you notice down the
[1:17:44] scripture God did not even move the camp
[1:17:47] God did not even move the children of
[1:17:50] Israel until and until our medium came
[1:17:54] back in now she had to go through a
[1:17:57] period of time where she had to be
[1:17:59] isolated but the isolation is not amen
[1:18:03] it's not to keep you there eventually we
[1:18:06] want to see you made home and go back
[1:18:08] into the circle bear with me here today
[1:18:15] right containment was the reason that
[1:18:18] she was placed out of the camp and
[1:18:21] anytime a person had leprosy they was
[1:18:23] placed outside of the camp right this is
[1:18:26] this is just what the law was and in the
[1:18:28] law that that whole thing on containment
[1:18:31] it was not a punishment to the person
[1:18:35] it's not a punishment to them but but
[1:18:39] what we're doing is because you got with
[1:18:41] you
[1:18:43] because you've been infected in order to
[1:18:47] protect everybody else then we have to
[1:18:52] contain you it's not just this I mean I
[1:18:59] you know what you know just a few weeks
[1:19:01] ago my wife was uh was was feeling a
[1:19:05] little sick a man and you know when she
[1:19:09] was feeling a little sick she she would
[1:19:13] avoid you know every every morning
[1:19:15] before we leave the house and everything
[1:19:16] we gather round and we have a little
[1:19:19] word of Prayer and and and I give my
[1:19:21] wife a kiss she give me a kiss and you
[1:19:23] know we and we part for the day and but
[1:19:27] when my wife was feeling a little sick a
[1:19:29] man she would she would avoid kissing me
[1:19:32] you know she pretty much just picked me
[1:19:34] on the check on the cheek I should say
[1:19:36] she'll pick me on the cheek cuz she want
[1:19:38] me to pick him see but don't don't kiss
[1:19:39] me in my mouth because because I'm sick
[1:19:42] and I don't want you to get what I got
[1:19:46] now
[1:19:47] when she tell me to peck on the cheek
[1:19:48] it's not that she upset with me it's not
[1:19:55] that she mad at me right it's not it's
[1:19:59] not that she feel indifferent towards me
[1:20:02] but but the reason she said no no kiss
[1:20:04] me right in the mouth because what I'm
[1:20:06] trying to do is prevent you from getting
[1:20:09] sick so just pick me on the cheek but
[1:20:12] it's not a punishment a man it's a
[1:20:15] protection right and when you can see it
[1:20:19] from that angle a man then you can do
[1:20:22] you can really help somebody because
[1:20:24] because sometimes we think that that's
[1:20:25] just but no it's not punishment or glory
[1:20:29] because I'm not following you on
[1:20:32] facebook that's not punishment because
[1:20:34] I'm disconnecting from your Instagram
[1:20:36] that's not punishment
[1:20:38] get a mix I'm trying to protect myself
[1:20:43] and I'm trying to protect you let me let
[1:20:47] me let me work with it here a little bit
[1:20:48] a little bit you know a little bit more
[1:20:50] you know I was I was thinking about when
[1:20:54] I preached the sermon I was gonna get
[1:20:56] myself a little table and put it out
[1:20:58] here and all my computer man that at
[1:21:01] that in the church they're gonna
[1:21:02] understand you know this but as I was
[1:21:04] thinking on this from the sermon you
[1:21:06] know I'm just I was like man how can i
[1:21:08] really bring this out so that everybody
[1:21:09] can understand and I thought about
[1:21:11] sister Tonya being in the medical field
[1:21:14] and as some of the things that she have
[1:21:16] to deal with in the medical field right
[1:21:18] and some of the people that got certain
[1:21:19] cases you know when they find out that
[1:21:23] the person got it
[1:21:24] they try to isolate and they have to go
[1:21:29] through certain protocols right and let
[1:21:33] me let me also just just just interject
[1:21:35] this certain people are qualified to go
[1:21:39] through the protocols so when they sit
[1:21:43] in the nurse out to visit they know the
[1:21:44] nurse has been properly trained or y'all
[1:21:47] gotta stay with me the nurse has been
[1:21:49] properly trained to be able to deal with
[1:21:51] that right don't just send anybody in
[1:21:54] there because they might come back with
[1:21:55] the same disease sometime they come in
[1:22:00] have no stuff all over they face that
[1:22:02] stuff that that's not you know from the
[1:22:05] you know be be be mean to you anything
[1:22:08] like that but but I got a family that
[1:22:10] I'm going back to my gosh I got some
[1:22:15] funk that I need to tend to at home and
[1:22:17] I can't take what you got back to them
[1:22:19] so I gotta come in in a protective way
[1:22:22] you can't expose yourself to everything
[1:22:26] [Music]
[1:22:30] hello somebody you can expose yourself
[1:22:34] to everything you gotta know how to
[1:22:35] handle it
[1:22:37] and the reason that they have to
[1:22:40] approach it that way sometimes lewd area
[1:22:43] insensitive let them look like they
[1:22:46] don't have any feeling look like they
[1:22:49] just don't have any emotion I could
[1:22:52] start but no it really is concern the
[1:22:55] reason that I'm acting this way is I
[1:22:56] gotta protect some other people now I'm
[1:23:01] using a natural type but I hope you can
[1:23:04] follow me spiritually then disturb this
[1:23:08] topic this ain't got nothing to do that
[1:23:09] I don't love you yes I do love you and
[1:23:11] the reason I love you is I got to
[1:23:14] contain what you got because I don't
[1:23:18] want other people to get it I thought
[1:23:24] about so now you know I'm a computer guy
[1:23:27] and I have to I have to look at things
[1:23:29] from a computer perspective so I said
[1:23:31] man I've thought about this bringing me
[1:23:33] a table and having y'all bring y'all
[1:23:35] laptops and I was going to plug your
[1:23:38] laptop's into our network don't create a
[1:23:41] little network so yeah with a network I
[1:23:45] don't have I wish I would have all the
[1:23:47] props here for y'all I wish I would have
[1:23:48] but the network you have a hub oh my god
[1:23:53] you have a hub and and and in order to
[1:23:57] plug your computer this is before Wi-Fi
[1:24:01] before Wi-Fi they have what we call
[1:24:04] wired connections and it'll be a cable
[1:24:07] that looks something like this it's an
[1:24:10] Ethernet cable it's about this thick and
[1:24:13] when you plug one end into your computer
[1:24:15] and then you take the other end you have
[1:24:17] to put it inside the hub or the switch
[1:24:19] and in order for you to get the
[1:24:22] information off my computer you're gonna
[1:24:24] have to be connected to the hub huh yeah
[1:24:27] I'll talk about the full Wi-Fi not now
[1:24:29] with Wi-Fi you know they still have you
[1:24:31] with Wi-Fi you can still get connected
[1:24:33] because we all get on the same router
[1:24:35] right and and you have some that you
[1:24:38] have to know the name
[1:24:39] the network halleluyah not only know the
[1:24:42] name of the network but you have to know
[1:24:44] the password through the network and
[1:24:47] once you get the password in the name of
[1:24:49] the network and you can get onto the
[1:24:51] Wi-Fi hallelujah
[1:24:54] some us a man we're so attached to Wi-Fi
[1:24:57] a man but when we walk to a person's
[1:25:00] house and we've never been to before
[1:25:02] praise the Lord we walk in a man with
[1:25:08] this you know why God bless you how you
[1:25:11] doing yes yes you sit down and pull your
[1:25:15] phone out and and the first question
[1:25:17] that's your mouth
[1:25:18] you know they got Wi-Fi because you see
[1:25:21] it pop it all up right you know what you
[1:25:24] know they got a network in there but you
[1:25:26] want to know what is the password
[1:25:27] because you're trying to get home oh
[1:25:30] you're trying to get connected right and
[1:25:33] then this this is the you know the
[1:25:35] society which we live today everybody
[1:25:38] want to be connected but but when you're
[1:25:40] on the network and in my day we have
[1:25:45] these things you know I'm just y'all
[1:25:47] just bear with me I wanna I wanna I want
[1:25:49] to give you just a couple of things here
[1:25:51] you know in my day when you got on the
[1:25:54] network right in your computer got a
[1:26:00] virus what we would have to do in order
[1:26:05] to contain the virus we actually have to
[1:26:09] take you off the network we have to
[1:26:12] disconnect your computer now look we
[1:26:16] want to use your computer there's a lot
[1:26:18] of processing power there and you've
[1:26:20] been you've been able to get some work
[1:26:22] done
[1:26:22] amen but but but when you get infected
[1:26:25] it's a possibility that they think is
[1:26:29] sprayed onto some of the other computers
[1:26:31] alright y'all y'all bear with me here
[1:26:33] let me let me let me let me go into this
[1:26:35] just a little deeper for you if I can
[1:26:37] anybody ever been impacted by malware
[1:26:42] now let me just tell you let me give
[1:26:45] some to some definitions now where is
[1:26:47] malicious code a software that secretly
[1:26:52] insert it itself into the system to
[1:26:55] compromise the confidentiality malware
[1:26:59] compromises the competition malware
[1:27:03] compromises the integrity and malware
[1:27:07] compromises the availability I wish I
[1:27:10] could preach all that but some of the
[1:27:14] stuff that's been released only on the
[1:27:16] internet about this message that we
[1:27:19] believe it's compromising the integrity
[1:27:22] of our messenger you see CC chief of the
[1:27:30] intelligence is doctrine nearly came
[1:27:35] against things that that that that devil
[1:27:37] is integrity the person that he married
[1:27:41] and what these people come up with is
[1:27:44] things that deal with the integrity of
[1:27:46] the puppet I'm talking about the
[1:27:48] doctrine but when you recognize this
[1:27:54] spirit then we gotta do certain things
[1:27:56] to contain it and whether he is his ways
[1:28:01] to contain something is disconnect from
[1:28:13] I'm gonna tell you something I'm gonna
[1:28:15] change something I want to change some
[1:28:20] only a priest dealt with leprosy only a
[1:28:27] priest that's in Leviticus 13 and 14
[1:28:30] only the priest could pronounce whether
[1:28:32] you had it or didn't have it and then
[1:28:35] they have different forms of leprosy
[1:28:36] they had they had leprosy that be in the
[1:28:38] skin and in Miriam's case she got it
[1:28:43] enough for hint no no no no is that
[1:28:46] right no I'm sorry oh my it wasn't her -
[1:28:54] Gavin forehead I want to see this Lord
[1:28:58] has his name Uzziah used I got it in his
[1:29:01] forehead now I want you to know
[1:29:04] something about
[1:29:05] about values aiya the way that he
[1:29:07] obtained leprosy and this is why only a
[1:29:11] priest should be able to deal with this
[1:29:12] state and this is a statement on they
[1:29:14] preach to deal with it because Uzziah
[1:29:16] try to usurp the position of a priest
[1:29:21] and when he tried to take the place of a
[1:29:25] priest he ended up with leprosy and
[1:29:28] yelling get it when you're trying to
[1:29:32] correct everybody and get them straight
[1:29:33] on the word before you know it you can
[1:29:37] infect it with leprosy that's why you
[1:29:39] turn that thing over to peace and let
[1:29:44] the priests and lit the way he had it
[1:29:46] brother Troy so y'all alone from
[1:29:48] Wednesday night and I was I mean there's
[1:29:50] been things I've been able to detect
[1:29:52] because I get a call from out of nowhere
[1:29:54] I better call them and you know I got
[1:29:56] questions about the message you know I
[1:29:58] don't mind answering people's questions
[1:30:00] one thing that I'm I'm not gonna say
[1:30:03] that because I don't want the devil to
[1:30:05] get ahold of that and did start creating
[1:30:06] some problems around here I'll say this
[1:30:09] that our church has been blessed so far
[1:30:11] and I thank God for that
[1:30:13] but I know that the more we keep
[1:30:15] entertaining this stuff somebody gonna
[1:30:18] end up with some leprosy around here
[1:30:20] spiritual leprosy yeah hallelujah the
[1:30:24] more we keep entertaining it it's gone
[1:30:26] it's gonna come right but but so what
[1:30:29] we're trying to do is you know when you
[1:30:30] recognize something I got a lot to say
[1:30:33] here right when you recognize something
[1:30:35] there's certain ways that you should
[1:30:36] handle lips right because because you
[1:30:40] got to get it back to the police and let
[1:30:42] the priests be the one to judge whether
[1:30:44] it's Darren I'm not there you know it's
[1:30:46] bad leprosy in your clothing the priests
[1:30:51] were the one to say that that piece of
[1:30:53] garment has to be destroyed
[1:30:56] burn it they they they whether was in
[1:31:02] the skin wear those in the fire wherever
[1:31:04] it was the police gonna want to diagnose
[1:31:06] it and the priest wouldn't want to deal
[1:31:09] with it hallelujah oh my god cuz you
[1:31:12] know people tell you oh you know this
[1:31:14] brother hearing them this and he ain't
[1:31:16] done that hearing them missing
[1:31:18] than that and and see next thing you
[1:31:20] know you start sympathizing with them
[1:31:21] can I tell you all something evil spirit
[1:31:24] gets few fuel from when people
[1:31:31] sympathize with it
[1:31:32] y'all ain't going with me today I got I
[1:31:34] got things to read I got some things to
[1:31:37] read I got a lot to read here but when
[1:31:40] you're with it all right
[1:31:42] you know I'm trying let me let me read
[1:31:45] y'all just at least this one quote here
[1:31:46] give me this is a resurrection of
[1:31:49] Lazarus and this is the second one 1950
[1:31:52] 0 813 8
[1:31:54] I got something to read here I just want
[1:31:55] to read this ayah y'all just bear with
[1:31:57] me here just for just for a few minutes
[1:31:59] glory to God look at this now it says if
[1:32:03] you keep your stomach empty and it's
[1:32:05] talked about fasting you said the blood
[1:32:07] is that your ring if you keep your
[1:32:09] stomach empty the blood is at your brain
[1:32:11] and you must be ready right and if you
[1:32:15] if you're all full that's the power of
[1:32:18] fasting this was 1950 0 813 amen it says
[1:32:23] he said that's the power fashion when
[1:32:25] you're full the blood goes into your
[1:32:27] stomach to digest your food you see and
[1:32:30] then when you're empty it's in your
[1:32:34] brain so so you can be custom because
[1:32:37] them two spirits are so close they could
[1:32:39] deceive the very elect if possible
[1:32:41] hallelujah now listen is he says and
[1:32:44] many times you hear it cry I've heard
[1:32:47] people shout now as I told you I hope
[1:32:49] God that has let me find favor with you
[1:32:52] that you believe me I've heard people
[1:32:54] shout when it wasn't God
[1:32:55] I've heard people cry when it wasn't God
[1:33:00] see in their sympathy sometimes look at
[1:33:06] what they say their sympathy sometimes
[1:33:08] the devil wants to be paid you came back
[1:33:14] pebbles you cache pebbles
[1:33:21] notice notice notice how you pet the
[1:33:23] devil simply you know y'all getting that
[1:33:30] it's due sympathy they won't sympathy
[1:33:33] I'm gonna tell you how you know sir
[1:33:34] evil spirit as soon as this is asking
[1:33:36] for sympathy I would say Christians
[1:33:38] Christians are rugged if y'all don't
[1:33:46] believe that go back to David David was
[1:33:49] rugged David when when a man that should
[1:33:52] have been crying out for sympathy is
[1:33:54] when he got back to the camp and not
[1:33:57] only was the man's family gone but his
[1:33:59] family was gone right rather than each
[1:34:02] man all band together with David
[1:34:05] these men decide we gonna kill you
[1:34:07] thinking and the Bible say David
[1:34:12] encouraged him so nobody was dead in
[1:34:18] curse painted David encouraged himself
[1:34:23] Christians are rugged so when you don't
[1:34:26] you know the first thing that some men
[1:34:28] say what you know I went through this
[1:34:29] today nobody called me well now you know
[1:34:31] you put yourself through that you know
[1:34:34] that right
[1:34:35] you did that to yourself that's not
[1:34:37] that's not on me that's on you and if
[1:34:40] and if you got leprosy think too many
[1:34:43] people couldn't call you
[1:34:45] cuz leprosy is contagious alright
[1:34:53] alright it says and that's tripathi
[1:34:56] sometimes the devil wants to repent it
[1:34:58] now look now look at what he says here
[1:35:00] and it takes a real sheep razor to know
[1:35:04] the difference between the blade of a
[1:35:06] goat and the land a goat puffs and sound
[1:35:10] just like a lamb but they bucking the
[1:35:12] word hallelujah if you give a person the
[1:35:14] word and they can't receive that you
[1:35:16] know something wrong with this spirit
[1:35:17] right here but restore me to the faith I
[1:35:20] pray listen it takes a real sheep razor
[1:35:24] to know the difference and I've been you
[1:35:27] know i'ma just say this because people
[1:35:28] been said we're brother Jack you don't
[1:35:31] call and you don't do this you don't do
[1:35:32] that well I call she it takes a real
[1:35:40] cheap razor to know the difference
[1:35:42] between the blade of a goat and a lamb
[1:35:44] they're so close together you see prese
[1:35:57] love somebody I'm just trying to contain
[1:36:01] some things I don't we other one other
[1:36:05] one see stuff sweet little touch
[1:36:07] everybody get infected let's go back to
[1:36:10] this malware cuz we all but we've all
[1:36:12] experienced if you got a computer a new
[1:36:14] units based malware you know what what
[1:36:15] happens up to time with with malware is
[1:36:17] that especially when you're trying to
[1:36:19] surf the Internet and you go to click on
[1:36:22] something and then just something just
[1:36:23] pop up out of nowhere I then click on
[1:36:25] that and then you try to get that off
[1:36:27] the screen into your going and
[1:36:28] eventually what happened yep computer
[1:36:30] can't even be used because of the
[1:36:33] infection you need a specialist you need
[1:36:40] somebody knows something about computers
[1:36:42] to help you get rid of that hallelujah
[1:36:46] alright now let's talk about some of
[1:36:48] these there's pierce malware also is
[1:36:52] categorized a certain different ways you
[1:36:56] know and I won't use all of them but
[1:36:58] I'll just I'll just mention and one is
[1:37:00] viruses and others worms and others
[1:37:02] Trojan horses and others malicious
[1:37:05] mobile code and then another's tracking
[1:37:07] cookies alright these are things that
[1:37:09] happen on the computer you know and this
[1:37:14] is how how viruses spreads glory to God
[1:37:17] hallelujah
[1:37:19] have y'all ever noticed that you can be
[1:37:23] on the Internet
[1:37:24] I'm doing a little something just
[1:37:26] surfing this net and then all certainly
[1:37:28] trying to sell you something that that
[1:37:30] you just looked at a couple days ago
[1:37:33] they tracking your cookie I understand
[1:37:38] in tracking your cooking you don't put
[1:37:42] some information in because you saw
[1:37:43] something that you really liked
[1:37:45] and you put your information in there oh
[1:37:48] and then they know what even though you
[1:37:51] didn't go through with buying it you put
[1:37:52] your information in there so not a
[1:37:54] tracking and they keep presenting it to
[1:37:56] you keep throwing it at you keep
[1:37:57] throwing it and the only way you can get
[1:37:59] rid of that is you've got to delete your
[1:38:01] cookies I'm preaching but here here I
[1:38:14] want you to understand what a virus is a
[1:38:17] virus is a self-replicating code that
[1:38:22] inserts copies of of itself into other
[1:38:26] programs and data files right so it's a
[1:38:29] virus or something that's
[1:38:30] self-replicating all right so so it's
[1:38:33] self-replicating you get it over here
[1:38:35] and you click on something here and that
[1:38:37] reproduces itself over there and then it
[1:38:39] reproduce itself over here you drop you
[1:38:41] just trying to find where this thing at
[1:38:42] on your computer and you need special
[1:38:44] software to go onto your computer try to
[1:38:47] identify all the areas that have been
[1:38:49] infected all the files that have been
[1:38:50] affected and clean that up you need you
[1:38:53] need special software you can't do that
[1:38:54] on your own that's why they call it
[1:38:57] virus protection in order to contain it
[1:39:00] a worm is a self-replicating
[1:39:04] self-contained program that executes
[1:39:06] without user intervention so if you get
[1:39:09] a worm on your computer you don't even
[1:39:11] have to click nothing to be infected
[1:39:13] that's why you got to be very careful as
[1:39:16] to what to do with your computer and who
[1:39:17] you let you should confuse all right let
[1:39:20] me go a little further now this is this
[1:39:22] is one of the worst ones that can happen
[1:39:24] to a computer this one's called the
[1:39:25] Trojan horse and the Trojan horse is is
[1:39:30] self-contained
[1:39:31] it's non-replicating amen and the thing
[1:39:35] about the Trojan horse it appears to be
[1:39:37] benign but it actually has a hidden
[1:39:41] malicious purpose now Lord would you
[1:39:44] ignore me to help the people understand
[1:39:47] what I'm saying
[1:39:52] now in our history what happened is that
[1:39:54] there was a nation that was just
[1:39:56] dominating the southern nation every
[1:39:59] time they would go to battle they were
[1:40:00] they would constantly of defeat this
[1:40:02] nation well well what the nation decided
[1:40:04] to do is that we don't create a gift and
[1:40:08] we don't give them this gift you know
[1:40:11] sometimes even when you click it on
[1:40:13] gifts gif when you're clicking on them
[1:40:17] they have horses I mean they have they
[1:40:18] have stuff behind them that's why you
[1:40:20] got to be careful what you'll be posting
[1:40:21] you got to be careful and you'll get
[1:40:24] everybody everybody that you send it to
[1:40:27] will end up with the infection because
[1:40:30] they clicked on all right stay with me
[1:40:33] but but this nation was defeated this
[1:40:35] nation and in this upper nation and I
[1:40:37] saw the nation that was confident and he
[1:40:39] said oh we gonna give them a gift and
[1:40:41] they built this horse huge horse and
[1:40:44] they went up to the gates of the city
[1:40:46] they knocked on the gates of the city
[1:40:48] and then said we got a gift for y'all
[1:40:50] with all these walls and everything
[1:40:51] we've been having we can't penetrate
[1:40:53] these walls and we just got we just got
[1:40:56] a gift for you please please take this
[1:40:57] difference bigger a huge choice they're
[1:40:59] like well wonderful when I saw who the
[1:41:02] horse inside the gates of the enclosing
[1:41:04] gates and when they closed the gates not
[1:41:07] normally there were warriors inside the
[1:41:11] horse and when they opened up the roster
[1:41:14] warriors came out and just went to town
[1:41:17] and that nation got defeated because
[1:41:20] they allowed something in that should've
[1:41:22] never came here well know how people get
[1:41:27] viruses spiritually leprosy they allow
[1:41:31] things in that should have never came in
[1:41:33] and you want to know how they start it
[1:41:36] they allow it
[1:41:38] sympathy now you know I let me try to
[1:41:43] make this plain cuz I don't think I'm
[1:41:45] plain enough y'all I used this example
[1:41:49] many times before I told you all the
[1:41:53] story is my my my family going to this
[1:41:57] hairdresser and it was all going to the
[1:42:01] hairdresser enjoying the headdress I saw

[1:42:18] them had a bad experience who did you
[1:42:22] that so-and-so oh do you I mean out of
[1:42:29] all the others that had good experiences
[1:42:32] one of them had one bad experience and
[1:42:36] you know what you know what happened
[1:42:38] after that after one not six or seven
[1:42:41] one had one bad experience do you know

[1:42:51] for a reason ain't done nothing wrong to
[1:42:55] you what's your talk about going
[1:43:00] somewhere fun leave it what have I done
[1:43:03] to you what you're doing is connecting
[1:43:06] with sympathy oh yeah okay you you
[1:43:12] connect it with sympathy or somebody
[1:43:15] else and what and you know and
[1:43:17] oftentimes oftentimes you know I have to
[1:43:20] do what I have to do with certain people
[1:43:21] I see something there and I got to work
[1:43:24] with them where there but don't allow
[1:43:29] you to get connected with sympathy and
[1:43:31] that's not just me that's just with any
[1:43:33] of us I'm gonna tell you I'm going
[1:43:36] somewhere with these things that that's
[1:43:37] with any of us right if somebody tell
[1:43:40] you something about somebody else you
[1:43:43] start connecting with sympathy and
[1:43:45] trying to take up for them you don't
[1:43:48] realize you invite the Trojan horse in
[1:43:52] and before you know it you're in the
[1:43:54] church don't know either
[1:43:59] so Jesus give us a way to handle these
[1:44:01] things let's go let's go and see what
[1:44:04] Jesus said let's see what Jesus says
[1:44:13] 8:2 Matthew 18:15 this is what Jesus
[1:44:17] safe and it you know and what you when
[1:44:20] you hear this type of stuff its
[1:44:22] containment y'all right because if you
[1:44:25] if you if you don't contain it just
[1:44:26] spreads out and just keep spreading then
[1:44:28] so many people are infected and let me
[1:44:30] tell you something about a story if I
[1:44:32] tell you something and you tell us
[1:44:36] somebody else you are not going to see
[1:44:38] it exactly the way I said it and guess
[1:44:42] what the person that you tell comes tell
[1:44:45] somebody else they not gonna see it
[1:44:46] exactly the way you think and before you
[1:44:50] know it we got a rumor weed and when you
[1:44:55] get it all the way back to you know the
[1:44:56] person where I started I'm like nah that
[1:44:58] ain't even the truth and everybody is
[1:45:00] its operating under a lie
[1:45:03] Oh y'all and got it everybody is
[1:45:06] functioning and you come to church with
[1:45:08] a bad spirit because you actually
[1:45:10] controlled by Allah right right and you
[1:45:16] got you got what I call spiritual
[1:45:17] leprosy hallelujah you've been
[1:45:21] influenced by somebody else you don't
[1:45:22] dance on I mean and it should never be
[1:45:24] that way if we follow Jesus the churches
[1:45:29] taste safe we can contain it now look at
[1:45:33] this look at this Matthew 18 verse
[1:45:38] actually 15 yeah
[1:45:48] moreover if thy brother shall trespass
[1:45:50] against thee go and tell him
[1:46:05] go and tell him that's not what we do
[1:46:09] just saying what we do we would tell
[1:46:11] everybody else before we actually tell
[1:46:15] him or her right so if your brother your
[1:46:20] sister a man trust bats against thee go
[1:46:23] and tell him his fault between thee and
[1:46:27] him alone i'ma just i'ma just say these
[1:46:33] things I you know somebody that called
[1:46:35] me one time and they were still just
[1:46:37] just you know they they had they had all
[1:46:39] these issues about this person had all
[1:46:40] these issues I said would you meet with
[1:46:44] me and this person just to kind of go
[1:46:46] over the issues and I said no I think
[1:46:51] the way that we supposed to do that is
[1:46:52] that since you have issues that a person
[1:46:54] you're supposed to go directly to them
[1:46:55] and you're supposed to get that
[1:46:57] straightened out and and then you know
[1:47:00] then we go from there
[1:47:01] so it's say well I don't mind going to
[1:47:05] them but would you go with me I say I
[1:47:06] don't mind going with you after after
[1:47:12] you've done what Jesus see it do so I
[1:47:18] don't mind going with you but it's gonna
[1:47:19] be after I ain't going with you before
[1:47:21] right but after you do what Jesus saying
[1:47:25] can I be glad to be right there and join
[1:47:26] you because what you find out is that
[1:47:29] the thing has already been settled they
[1:47:32] just rehashing something or trying to
[1:47:35] and and if they call them me without
[1:47:37] going to that person first I already
[1:47:39] know it's a spirit behind it this is
[1:47:42] leprosy Oh y'all I hope y'all with me
[1:47:46] we've got to contain things let's go on
[1:47:49] let's go on see that and let me tell you
[1:47:51] another thing when you contain a leprosy
[1:47:54] you can't be there well I got them both
[1:47:57] together I got this one again I got that
[1:47:58] one together maybe maybe you like the
[1:48:00] one that should be getting everybody
[1:48:01] together maybe maybe you need to get the
[1:48:03] past involved I'll tell you what we're
[1:48:07] gonna do I'm want to stay out of this
[1:48:09] but I will I'm a car brother Jack and
[1:48:11] now if you say I'm a car brother Jack no
[1:48:13] no we'll need to go there you all
[1:48:21] that that should be a dead giveaway and
[1:48:23] when if this is a dead giveaway don't
[1:48:26] you entertain that conversation anymore
[1:48:30] you let them know right then the buck
[1:48:33] stops here we ain't talking about that
[1:48:34] no more you don't call my phone no more
[1:48:36] to talk about that we're gonna contain
[1:48:38] that now we can talk about other things
[1:48:40] but not that
[1:48:41] and as soon as they start going down
[1:48:43] that path and you know you can tell when
[1:48:44] they get ready to go they start working
[1:48:46] all the way around in here they come
[1:48:47] back so I did not tell you that I ain't
[1:48:50] talking about that number with you keep
[1:48:53] people on the word and you call me one
[1:48:55] more time me and you gonna go to brother
[1:48:57] Jack all right
[1:49:02] don't talk about containment this hot
[1:49:04] this how we keep the church clean that's
[1:49:09] the one moreover if thy brother shall
[1:49:11] trespass against thee go and tell him
[1:49:13] his fault between thee and him alone if
[1:49:17] he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy
[1:49:20] brother but if he will not hear thee
[1:49:25] then take with thee one or two more that
[1:49:29] in the mouth of two or three witnesses
[1:49:30] every word may be established now you
[1:49:33] know sometimes what we want to do is
[1:49:35] take people that we know gonna agree
[1:49:37] with us don't do that if you want to get
[1:49:40] to the bottom of the thing you want to
[1:49:42] sell it get somebody don't know nothing
[1:49:43] at all like the pastor because the
[1:49:46] pastor's the last one to know everything
[1:49:51] it's the truth in it hi I know what I'm
[1:49:54] talking about the past is the last to
[1:49:56] know
[1:49:56] leacy act like it
[1:50:02] you'd be surprised at what the pastor
[1:50:05] knows and just and and sometime you just
[1:50:08] got to hold it in just and sometimes it
[1:50:11] just be wondering just just bladedge you
[1:50:13] know right no don't see just just just
[1:50:15] just just let it go and the other thing
[1:50:20] you have know about a pastor the pastor
[1:50:21] is a person that can't start with nobody
[1:50:24] he's not supposed to you see a pastor
[1:50:27] side of something wrong somewhere right
[1:50:29] but a pastor supposed to be able to take
[1:50:30] both parties together listen to both
[1:50:32] sides and then come right down the
[1:50:34] middle
[1:50:34] amen all right all right y'all still
[1:50:40] here okay listen
[1:50:43] verse 16 right says but if you were not
[1:50:46] here thee then take with thee one or two
[1:50:48] more that in the mouth of two or three
[1:50:49] witnesses every word may be established
[1:50:51] and if he shall neglect to hear them
[1:50:54] telling them to the church but if he
[1:50:57] neglect to hear the church let him be
[1:51:00] unto thee as a heathen man and as a
[1:51:04] publican so what were they pretty much
[1:51:05] saying that you got personal I guess
[1:51:07] that don't want don't want to make
[1:51:08] things right in the church do you let
[1:51:11] them go
[1:51:12] that's what let me be is a key to the
[1:51:14] puzzle and I don't even you know you
[1:51:15] don't even want to make things right
[1:51:16] here we've gone through of the proper
[1:51:18] protocols and you don't want to make
[1:51:19] things right you won't you don't create
[1:51:21] problems here so we're gonna have to
[1:51:23] just let you go and we have to isolate
[1:51:26] you put you in containment
[1:51:28] our hope is that why you've in contained
[1:51:31] that you'll come to yourself I want to
[1:51:33] make that thing right and now we can
[1:51:34] come back and receive you you know when
[1:51:37] a person has done that way you know that
[1:51:39] the church not even supposed to pray for
[1:51:45] you know why because when you pray for
[1:51:47] them the blood of Jesus is actually
[1:51:49] covering them and can't actually get to
[1:51:52] them to do what need to be done we don't
[1:51:57] we don't we don't hear these things over
[1:51:59] but it's the truth anyhow
[1:52:01] so let me um you know when we talk about
[1:52:05] containment all right Jesus gives us how
[1:52:07] we spoil the handle things even amongst
[1:52:09] ourselves because you know that's not
[1:52:11] leprosy even spread through the church
[1:52:13] don't pet no devil don't pet a devil
[1:52:16] cast the devil out okay now let me just
[1:52:21] read a couple of things you know even if
[1:52:26] there's a terrorist attack
[1:52:28] citral intelligence will do all they can
[1:52:30] to contain the source of the attack if
[1:52:35] there was an oil leak out in the ocean
[1:52:37] they gonna do everything they can to
[1:52:39] contain the oil leak they're not just
[1:52:41] gonna let it keep spreading and you know
[1:52:43] and I have to be I have to come and
[1:52:45] preach sermons like this because I don't
[1:52:46] want stuff that just keeps keep spread
[1:52:48] so we gotta try to contain stuff listen
[1:52:53] when it's an outbreak of a flu or any
[1:52:56] other type of virus we isolate the
[1:52:58] infected person and isolating them amen
[1:53:02] what we're trying to do is just contain
[1:53:04] the virus so that it does not spread to
[1:53:06] anybody else now I'll talk to you about
[1:53:09] computers and with the computer world
[1:53:11] when I disconnect your computer I got to
[1:53:13] come and work on your computer in order
[1:53:16] to be able to get you reconnected but
[1:53:18] there are certain protocols I got to
[1:53:19] take your computer through before I feel
[1:53:21] comfortable about being able to get you
[1:53:22] back on the network now sometimes if
[1:53:24] you're if you're if you're if you're
[1:53:26] viruses is it's just a little bit too
[1:53:29] much the best thing for me to do rather
[1:53:32] than just put a program on there and try
[1:53:34] to clean it up and get the virus get the
[1:53:36] virus off and put you back on the
[1:53:37] network the best thing for me to do is
[1:53:38] actually to reimage your computer oh my
[1:53:42] god
[1:53:42] brother Devon you understand even man
[1:53:46] but I have to reformat start all over
[1:53:50] with your computer again and you know
[1:53:52] what that takes time sometimes you can't
[1:53:56] clean up viruses overnight so in your
[1:54:02] sympathetic ways don't be well I won the
[1:54:04] win no no no what you keep doing is
[1:54:06] praying but don't try to be the priest
[1:54:11] because you might get leprosy when you
[1:54:14] try to become the priest sometimes you
[1:54:18] ain't got to be the one to let people
[1:54:19] know where you stand
[1:54:20] they know where you stand they know
[1:54:23] where you stand you got to be the one I
[1:54:25] just I need to let them know they gonna
[1:54:26] throw something at you envy what you
[1:54:31] don't invited a Trojan horse in and
[1:54:36] you're trying to figure out why you
[1:54:37] feeling the way you feeling there's
[1:54:40] certain ways things need to be handled
[1:54:42] now when when a person realizes that
[1:54:46] they have been infected with malware
[1:54:47] there are actually six steps that they
[1:54:50] go through one is preparation where they
[1:54:53] develop a malware specific incident
[1:54:55] handling policy and procedure
[1:54:57] another is detection and analysis where
[1:55:01] the you deploy and monitor antivirus
[1:55:04] anti-spyware a spyware software and when
[1:55:07] you're monitoring it you're reading all
[1:55:08] the malware advisories and they're
[1:55:10] telling you all the new stuff that's
[1:55:11] been released that then how to protect
[1:55:12] yourself from it so as the detection and
[1:55:15] announces that happen and then the third
[1:55:17] thing that they said this is this is
[1:55:18] right off the internet all right
[1:55:19] the third thing they do is containment
[1:55:22] all right and and and and in the
[1:55:25] containment stage say be prepared to
[1:55:28] shut down a server or a workstation or
[1:55:31] block services like email web browsing
[1:55:34] the Internet access to contain a malware
[1:55:36] incident no let me be that in the
[1:55:40] containment phase you need to be
[1:55:41] prepared to shut down so so remember I
[1:55:46] came here a few weeks ago and I said
[1:55:48] some of y'all allow to go for seven days
[1:55:50] off of off of social media just take a
[1:55:53] break seven days off Assoc mean
[1:55:54] especially artists stuff that was
[1:55:56] spreading at the time and again people
[1:55:58] won't simple
[1:55:59] and you you just right there sympathize
[1:56:02] with no no no no a devil can't be petted
[1:56:05] and I'm not telling you to be the one I
[1:56:07] better you know you got a devil million
[1:56:09] I'm catch that mouth ain't betting the
[1:56:11] way you handle nothing ain't ain't no
[1:56:13] what you do I'm praying for you and I'm
[1:56:16] a Tina I'm not saying that you got to
[1:56:17] completely avoid people can't talk to
[1:56:19] know that it's just you got to know what
[1:56:21] to talk about and what not to talk about
[1:56:24] that's what containment is right you
[1:56:27] know not to go on that no we're not
[1:56:28] gonna go in there there I see that
[1:56:29] that's gonna be a problem let's just
[1:56:31] find something else to talk about the
[1:56:33] man the weather pretty good I've been
[1:56:34] enjoying this weather needed some rain
[1:56:38] on my grass and thank God for sin and
[1:56:40] rain talk about something else
[1:56:41] praise the Lord all right but but in the
[1:56:44] containment stage you need to be
[1:56:45] prepared to shut down or block services
[1:56:49] some calls you should just block some
[1:56:53] emails you shouldn't respond to
[1:56:56] hallelujah all right another one is
[1:56:59] eradication be prepared to use a variety
[1:57:02] of rear a dication techniques to remove
[1:57:04] the malware from infects the infected
[1:57:05] systems another fifth stage is recovery
[1:57:08] and in the recovery phase what we're
[1:57:11] trying to do is restore the
[1:57:12] confidentiality restore the integrity
[1:57:15] and restore the develop availability so
[1:57:20] so we have to restore that first we got
[1:57:22] to get you to a man do you do you do you
[1:57:25] have you been restored back to the faith
[1:57:29] amen oh no we're not talking about some
[1:57:32] of these other stuff that people Bri I'm
[1:57:34] talk about the faith you believe God
[1:57:36] sent a prophet do you believe it
[1:57:38] what was his name we got to restore that
[1:57:42] because that's what recreates the
[1:57:44] fellowship Amen church glory to God hey
[1:57:47] man listen in the last the last stage of
[1:57:52] this four year when you when you're
[1:57:54] recovering a man from malware the last
[1:57:57] stage is is report and what the report
[1:58:00] is you gather the lessons learned after
[1:58:04] each malware incident to avert you
[1:58:07] gather lessons learn in order to avert
[1:58:10] similar future infant
[1:58:14] so we got to get you you know what did
[1:58:16] you learn from that and now you see you
[1:58:18] can't be going every website reading
[1:58:19] everything how about you you're going
[1:58:22] deeper but then we got something beat
[1:58:23] for you all right I want to read
[1:58:28] something here for you
[1:58:29] a man Oh a couple things I want to read
[1:58:34] for you this is out of the message
[1:58:36] influence yes yes just give me give me
[1:58:43] just a little bit more of your time the
[1:58:44] will will bring this home I'm talk about
[1:58:47] containment don't pet no Devils once you
[1:58:51] recognize that they Devils you got a
[1:58:53] this separate amen that's that's in
[1:58:56] order to protect yourself and to protect
[1:58:58] others all right
[1:58:59] and the message influence the Prophet
[1:59:01] says God said preach the gospel
[1:59:03] demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:04] these signs will follow them that
[1:59:07] believe not go make organizations have
[1:59:10] schools and so forth nothing gainst it
[1:59:11] but that don't take this offices place
[1:59:14] and we see now that men and women who
[1:59:17] try to take the anointed office when
[1:59:20] they were deign when they're not
[1:59:22] ordained to do it
[1:59:23] we see what happens to them I'm gonna
[1:59:26] say something here I'm gonna say
[1:59:28] something here when Uzziah being a king
[1:59:35] was supposed to stay a king when he
[1:59:38] tried to usurp his authority as a king
[1:59:41] and then take the priests office that's
[1:59:43] when he got struck with leprosy now you
[1:59:47] know you can be anointed to do a
[1:59:49] particular thing but don't mean you in
[1:59:52] order to do everything can I say that
[1:59:54] again you can be in order to do a
[1:59:57] particular thing but don't mean you
[1:59:58] learn it to do everything now I'm gonna
[2:00:00] give you a couple examples now when I
[2:00:03] was a song leader right and I was
[2:00:07] serving the Lord just as a song leader
[2:00:08] it was never my intention just to try to
[2:00:11] take the pulpit and start preaching God
[2:00:13] had to force me into that right but
[2:00:15] oftentimes what you get is a man that
[2:00:17] stands up before the people even in the
[2:00:20] anything of just your song sir he
[2:00:23] actually feel that well doc got me here
[2:00:25] doing songs every night
[2:00:26] to be able to go further start preaching
[2:00:28] the gospel and then you get everything
[2:00:29] all confused within two years a person
[2:00:33] that might be a good singer don't mean
[2:00:36] that they're going to be a good preacher
[2:00:37] a person that might be a good news
[2:00:40] musician before the people don't mean
[2:00:43] they're gonna be a good preacher but you
[2:00:45] see often times a lot of musicians try
[2:00:46] to take the position of being a
[2:00:49] preacher's well don't mean that don't
[2:00:51] mean that you got the same anointing on
[2:00:53] you
[2:00:53] a man Church right you know so so so we
[2:00:56] got it we got we gotta kind of watch
[2:00:58] that it's best just to stay humble
[2:00:59] before God God don't need you God don't
[2:01:02] need me God don't need nobody God can do
[2:01:04] this thing all by himself right but but
[2:01:06] we got to understand that you know uh
[2:01:09] sometimes when we start to exalt
[2:01:12] ourselves that's what that's what this
[2:01:14] venue sided he lifted himself up took a
[2:01:17] position that he was not supposed to
[2:01:19] have ended up with leprosy let me keep
[2:01:25] reading don't don't exalt yourself let
[2:01:29] God exalt you let God exalt you I'm
[2:01:35] standing a lot and I hope y'all can read
[2:01:36] between the lines I know what I'm saying
[2:01:38] I know exactly what I'm saying if we
[2:01:41] learn from these things in Scripture
[2:01:43] then we can prevent them from happening
[2:01:45] again and you know you know you I got a
[2:01:49] quote here brother branham talk about
[2:01:51] how you know people just came to church
[2:01:54] yesterday and two days three days later
[2:01:59] date date but Jack I was at home I was
[2:02:03] reading and boy who something that I'm
[2:02:07] ready
[2:02:08] ready for what
[2:02:13] getting ready for nothing ready to keep
[2:02:17] reading your Bible right but people
[2:02:20] think that they got one of the
[2:02:21] revelations they rather just do whatever
[2:02:22] they were they ready to preach the
[2:02:23] gospel no you ain't you sit there and
[2:02:25] overcome some stuff then but then we can
[2:02:27] talk about you preacher's son amen
[2:02:29] all right but here you know he goes on
[2:02:32] to say this not gonna make organizations
[2:02:36] have schools and so forth nothing
[2:02:37] against it but that don't take this
[2:02:38] office its place and we see now that men
[2:02:41] and women who try to take that anointed
[2:02:42] office when they're not ordained to do
[2:02:44] it we Steve what happens to them
[2:02:46] there's our example ministers we see it
[2:02:48] in the teenage life we see it everywhere
[2:02:51] that's don't watch man watch God take
[2:02:55] your eyes from man put it on God not
[2:02:58] influenced say old glory to God the Lord
[2:03:00] tells me thus that the Lord do so-and-so
[2:03:02] and it never happens so you're trying to
[2:03:05] impersonate something that you know
[2:03:07] nothing about don't do that it's
[2:03:09] dangerous you'll be stricken with
[2:03:11] leprosy with spiritual leprosy unbelief
[2:03:13] your denomination trying to build trying
[2:03:15] to build up get a feather in your hat to
[2:03:17] be a Presbyterian I'm saying some things
[2:03:20] there and I'm just I'm just you know one
[2:03:23] person that called me and was mentioning
[2:03:25] something about a brother that felt that
[2:03:27] God had called him to be an apostille Oh
[2:03:31] was that right he's called to be an
[2:03:34] apostille and I said do they even know
[2:03:38] what the word apostille mean you know
[2:03:40] that you know what apostille does and
[2:03:43] say it's a yeah yeah you go around they
[2:03:45] set up churches well where have they
[2:03:47] done that when and where have they've
[2:03:49] done that to happen they just feel like
[2:03:53] they've been called to be an apostle
[2:03:54] okay let me tell you something it don't
[2:03:57] work that way
[2:03:58] right I mean typically if a person has a
[2:04:01] call and they life they already been
[2:04:03] operating in that before they got the
[2:04:06] title before the title comes they've
[2:04:10] already been operating like that you can
[2:04:12] see it already on them before brother
[2:04:15] Troy you know became deacon y'all
[2:04:17] already saw certain things on him right
[2:04:20] amen before I became a pastor I can tell
[2:04:23] you people
[2:04:24] certain things on me as a little boy
[2:04:27] this just didn't happen overnight praise
[2:04:30] the Lord right a minister you can sit
[2:04:32] down you've just been sitting there
[2:04:33] talking to them and certain things that
[2:04:35] there's a certain way to conduct
[2:04:36] themselves you know that there's a call
[2:04:38] in there people can identify it let's
[2:04:41] see you got you got you got you got a
[2:04:42] problem in the church some was called
[2:04:45] and sent others just got up and went and
[2:04:51] the ones that got up and went end up
[2:04:53] with spiritual leprosy
[2:04:54] alright let's go ball a little bit
[2:04:57] further y'all stay with me I want to
[2:04:59] preach Ramin reform respects respects
[2:05:03] respects as a Miriam failed to have that
[2:05:05] respect for the office of the Prophet a
[2:05:09] man and many people today are also
[2:05:11] felling to have the respect for the
[2:05:13] office of the Prophet they try to make
[2:05:15] him just like any other minister but God
[2:05:16] had a very unique ministry for him and
[2:05:19] we thank God for that
[2:05:20] listen so there stood Miriam God said
[2:05:24] call Miriam and called Moses
[2:05:26] I'll call Aaron here your brother and
[2:05:28] sister to stand before me and when they
[2:05:31] come in before God God said don't you
[2:05:33] fear God said that to the high priest
[2:05:36] and to Miriam the prophetess said if
[2:05:38] there be any man among you spiritual a
[2:05:41] prophet I the Lord will make myself
[2:05:43] known to him I'll speak to him in
[2:05:45] visions and reveal myself and dreams to
[2:05:47] him and so forth if he's spiritual a
[2:05:49] prophet but say my servant Moses I speak
[2:05:51] lips to ear with him said don't you fear
[2:05:53] God in other words look at this in other
[2:05:55] words you talk about Moses you're
[2:05:59] talking about me if you can't respect
[2:06:01] Moses you don't respect me so haven't I
[2:06:07] proved among you that he's my servant
[2:06:09] and you have no reverence for him at all
[2:06:13] what that would be a lesson for people
[2:06:15] of this day no respects no Hana now he
[2:06:18] said him because you didn't do that
[2:06:19] that's the reason you got leprosy that's
[2:06:22] the reason these things as wimps that
[2:06:23] because you ought to have know that this
[2:06:25] was my servant you do know it look at
[2:06:28] that you're not just you all don't know
[2:06:30] it you do know it so when you say
[2:06:32] something against him you're saying it
[2:06:34] against me
[2:06:37] so Moses great for her life to be spared
[2:06:39] and God spared her life she didn't live
[2:06:42] very long afterwards she died but she
[2:06:45] did get cleansed of her leprosy and was
[2:06:46] out of the camp for seven days you know
[2:06:48] for having a for purification getting
[2:06:51] herself clean clean again from her left
[2:06:53] seat God healed her but what he was
[2:06:55] trying to get them get to them was this
[2:06:57] you got to respect what I do and if that
[2:07:00] was the attitude of God in that date and
[2:07:02] God can't change God wants us to respect
[2:07:05] what he's doing he demands it said you
[2:07:07] either respect that but something else
[2:07:09] is going to happen all right
[2:07:14] let me just slip back up here to this I
[2:07:17] was telling you all earlier I was
[2:07:19] blessed by a sermon recently the brother
[2:07:23] Whisperer grip when I had preached and
[2:07:25] he the title for the sermon was
[2:07:26] delivered from demonic black streets and
[2:07:29] he was talking about you know in that
[2:07:30] sermon how you know people just get a
[2:07:35] demon on them and to say in order for
[2:07:37] that demon to get strength when it's
[2:07:39] been getting ready cast out in order for
[2:07:41] the demon to get strength it has to get
[2:07:43] sympathy from another demon right and
[2:07:46] that's that's why I say you got to be
[2:07:48] watchful that don't pet no devil that
[2:07:50] double look at the sympathy and when you
[2:07:51] give it sympathy you've given the devil
[2:07:54] strength the only way you go defeat
[2:07:58] Devils is not by sympathizing with them
[2:08:00] only way you're gonna defeat them about
[2:08:02] casting them out amen
[2:08:04] all right let me uh let me there's one
[2:08:06] other quote here that I want to read for
[2:08:08] you maybe it may be two more we're
[2:08:10] talking about these uh oh yes yes right
[2:08:16] in here somewhere
[2:08:17] oh my let me just find it okay this is a
[2:08:25] to one out of the Church of the Living
[2:08:27] God and then the last one would be out
[2:08:30] of exhortation I believe the church and
[2:08:33] living God stay with me here we're
[2:08:35] talking about how these demons and see
[2:08:36] brother Branham could tell us these
[2:08:37] things he's working there from the
[2:08:39] platform casting out Devils and praying
[2:08:41] for people and he can see the demons now
[2:08:43] watch this this is over this way how
[2:08:45] many believe how many of you believe God
[2:08:48] just a moment
[2:08:49] way back with your hands up who has not
[2:08:52] prayer cars back there have faith
[2:08:54] believe now there's so many you're
[2:08:56] sitting here looking so strangely at me
[2:08:57] with with a tie ohm you've been praying
[2:09:00] haven't you sir yeah I see you knelt in
[2:09:03] a room and you pray if you could ever
[2:09:05] get near me you be healed is that right
[2:09:07] you suffer with a kidney trouble isn't
[2:09:11] that true Jesus Christ makes you hold my
[2:09:14] brother you stand to your feet right so
[2:09:16] the brother you know stands to Speedy's
[2:09:18] he'll do kidney trouble he says now
[2:09:20] there goes that spirit a blackness of
[2:09:23] darkness leaving that man seemingly you
[2:09:27] could see it watching it's got a
[2:09:30] sympathizing partner just a moment don't
[2:09:36] be a sympathizing partner to no devil
[2:09:37] I'm telling it amen
[2:09:39] it's got a sympathizing partner just a
[2:09:41] moment they're false just just just a
[2:09:44] moment yes they're false over man
[2:09:46] sitting there with a white t-shirt on
[2:09:48] black headed man his hands in his face
[2:09:50] stand up young man you suffer with
[2:09:52] kidney stones isn't that right accept
[2:09:54] Jesus now as your healer that healed you
[2:09:56] nineteen hundred years ago have faith in

[2:09:59] count the spirit cast out at one man

[2:10:03] spirit is cast out because every
[2:10:05] sickness is a spirit right so the spirit
[2:10:07] is cast out me watch the spirit leave
[2:10:09] and go fall on somebody else but if fell
[2:10:12] on another person that had a kidney
[2:10:13] condition not just anybody but if they

[2:13:58] hit on the man there you see there and
[2:14:02] sympathy one with another you understand
[2:14:07] what I mean now see it's kindred spirits
[2:14:12] so you can have kindred spirits both
[2:14:14] good and or bad kindred spirits hey man
[2:14:19] we're trying to contain them you know
[2:14:21] what I mean dogs stay with doves
[2:14:25] scabbard I see it's like brothers you
[2:14:27] know they're together and that's the way
[2:14:29] this kindred spirit that cancer cancer
[2:14:32] is a demon it's a devil
[2:14:33] and I'll be real reverent and believe
[2:14:35] with all your heart all right I like the
[2:14:38] way you just said that does stay with
[2:14:39] doves brothers stay with buzzers you
[2:14:43] don't find them fellowshipping together
[2:14:44] they their diets are different and i'ma
[2:14:47] tell you since I just say they guys are
[2:14:49] different one other ways of actually
[2:14:51] obtaining leprosy is through what you
[2:14:54] eat you can actually get leprosy from
[2:14:58] what should be spiritually
[2:15:02] all right church be watch would be
[2:15:05] careful what you eat don't allow the
[2:15:07] devil to come in and give you the
[2:15:09] spiritual leprosy we want to contain
[2:15:11] that with everything we can and in the
[2:15:13] way that you contain it it's just follow
[2:15:15] what Jesus said a man just there's a
[2:15:18] problem go get the thing worked out and
[2:15:20] let's move on but don't let stuff just
[2:15:22] keep spreading all over the church and
[2:15:23] you know you know what this was said you
[2:15:25] know no no no we trying to contain
[2:15:27] leprosy amen when a person gets leprosy
[2:15:33] the other thing that you need to
[2:15:34] understand is leprosy can only be cured
[2:15:37] by God they cannot they I mean Ollie God
[2:15:42] can can fix that and if God don't fix it
[2:15:45] then it's over so everything that you
[2:15:47] try to do it ain't gonna work
[2:15:50] but if you put it in God's hands he can
[2:15:52] do great things and church I am like I
[2:15:56] said at the beginning when Miriam was
[2:15:58] called Amen - she's caught with the
[2:16:01] leprosy she had to leave the camp for
[2:16:02] seven days but they didn't move until
[2:16:04] she came back so the objective is not to
[2:16:07] keep them there the objective is to
[2:16:10] restore them back but understand there's
[2:16:12] a way that we have to do things and the
[2:16:15] reason that we do it that way is because
[2:16:17] we're trying to contain and protect
[2:16:19] everybody else praise the Lord god bless
[2:16:24] you god bless you hey man let's let's
[2:16:27] pray whispering father this little
[2:16:33] thought that you just put in my heart
[2:16:34] some time ago I first I want to
[2:16:36] apologize to you for failing to deliver
[2:16:39] this to the church god I ask that you
[2:16:44] would forgive me maybe Lord it could
[2:16:47] have helped somebody look earlier God
[2:16:51] helped me to be more sensitive to your
[2:16:53] voice into your spirit because you would
[2:16:55] just put things in my heart lord help me
[2:16:59] God just to share it I pray that today
[2:17:01] Lord that the church would be spiritual
[2:17:05] enough to really catch what you're
[2:17:06] trying to say when we look at the life
[2:17:09] of Miriam we see her actually Lord she
[2:17:13] she she she developed this leprosy
[2:17:15] because
[2:17:16] of her attitude course Moses your
[2:17:20] servant and God even though she went
[2:17:23] through this you still you still have
[2:17:26] mercy you still had grace and you
[2:17:28] brought it through you you did bring
[2:17:29] healing Moses pray for her healing and
[2:17:32] God you did bring healing and I know
[2:17:35] that your God that don't respect persons
[2:17:38] and I know today Lord that there's so
[2:17:41] many that has been impacted with this
[2:17:42] spiritual leprosy they have also
[2:17:44] rejected your word through your prophet
[2:17:46] some are confused don't even know why
[2:17:48] they feel the way that they feel but God
[2:17:50] I pray just as Moses prayed for Miriam I
[2:17:53] pray for so many that you would help
[2:17:55] them to see that's why that strong meant
[2:17:57] so much restored me to the faith I pray
[2:18:00] Lord has so many got this turn and
[2:18:02] walked away but God made you restore
[2:18:05] them to the faith give them
[2:18:06] understanding and revelation of your
[2:18:08] work Lord give them something that the
[2:18:10] devil can't take from them you said Lord
[2:18:13] upon this rock I'll build my church and
[2:18:16] the gates of Hell will not prevail
[2:18:19] against it so build it father on the
[2:18:21] revelation of who you are and what
[2:18:23] you're doing in this hour Lord let us be
[2:18:26] sensitive to the Spirit of God let us be
[2:18:31] mindful God of what what you're doing
[2:18:33] but also mindful what the devil is
[2:18:35] trying to do oh god don't let us miss it
[2:18:38] in this hour thank you for your love
[2:18:41] thank you for your mercy thank you for
[2:18:45] your grace it's in the mighty name of
[2:18:48] the Lord Jesus that we pray amen amen

[2:22:49] [Music]
[2:22:52] thank you Jesus
[2:22:54] more they got up and just do something
[2:22:56] real quick mama could you just share the
[2:22:58] testimony of how that song was perfect
[2:23:03] [Music]
[2:23:08] praise the Lord you know coming into
[2:23:16] this perfect word
[2:23:19] after going through denominational
[2:23:22] system all my life I searched and
[2:23:25] searched and searched and God brought me
[2:23:29] to it and when he brought me to it
[2:23:34] it was like new life took hold of me I
[2:23:40] found myself in a place that I've never
[2:23:44] been in before spiritually for the
[2:23:47] better I've ridden some little songs a
[2:23:51] little I call them little Diddley songs
[2:23:53] before but once I came into this message
[2:23:56] it just anointed a gift that was in me
[2:23:59] that I didn't know and it just there was
[2:24:03] a song I believe the line is just a
[2:24:05] saying everything you touches a song and
[2:24:08] that's the way it became for me the
[2:24:12] messages would go forth and it was a
[2:24:15] place I was in
[2:24:18] and I had to experience this joy this
[2:24:21] joy and been in this message and is that
[2:24:25] it was revealed to me I could never
[2:24:28] imagine welcome lately I could never
[2:24:32] ever and this power of thinking that I
[2:24:35] could leave this message just better
[2:24:39] take them hating on that the words begin
[2:24:42] to come they just begin the confident
[2:24:47] Psalm formed in my heart and I remember
[2:24:55] I had no confidence in myself as a
[2:24:57] singer a new Lord was given these songs
[2:25:00] to write but I didn't know whether they
[2:25:02] were for me and for somebody else and I
[2:25:05] would sing the song I get in my car and
[2:25:08] I rolled the windows up real tight it
[2:25:11] was just so in me just so in me I just
[2:25:14] rolled those windows up real tight and I
[2:25:16] just blast with everything I said but
[2:25:19] nobody with me in the Lord heard it so
[2:25:24] one particular day I was on my lunch
[2:25:26] hour and it was a co-worker that was
[2:25:29] driving beside me and I didn't notice
[2:25:30] because I was just so caught up in the
[2:25:32] song and when I got back to work he came
[2:25:36] up to my desk I said what are you
[2:25:38] singing I said what do you mean he say
[2:25:42] ours beside you and he said you were
[2:25:45] just going at it you would just go and
[2:25:48] add it and he said I just want to know
[2:25:52] what was it that had gotten ahold to you
[2:25:54] like that oh it's just a little song I
[2:25:59] was singing that did there try to
[2:26:01] explain it to him but it stayed pretty
[2:26:05] much like that and during that time I
[2:26:08] was a part of the Okeechobee Church and
[2:26:11] we were talking about getting together
[2:26:14] put into putting the CD together and the
[2:26:16] Lord had given me quite a few songs at
[2:26:18] that
[2:26:19] and I introduced that one to the group
[2:26:23] and immediately they loved it they
[2:26:27] really really loved it and sister Judy
[2:26:30] Williams was the one that recorded it
[2:26:32] first did a beautiful job on it
[2:26:36] it's a really beautiful job and those
[2:26:39] kind of things begin to give me
[2:26:41] confidence in the gift the Lord had
[2:26:43] given me
[2:26:44] and I was really really really blessed
[2:26:47] happen to be up in Ohio was this Luis
[2:26:50] and we were going to do a recording a
[2:26:54] live recording with brother as a Brooks
[2:26:58] and Galante's were very much a part of
[2:27:02] that product project and sister sherry
[2:27:09] LaFontaine she came up to me and she was
[2:27:11] talking about what a blessing the song
[2:27:14] was this was after this CD was actually
[2:27:17] done and she just shared with me what a
[2:27:21] blessing and she asked me she said would
[2:27:23] you mind if I record that song I really
[2:27:28] thought there highly of the la
[2:27:30] Fontaine's and ii wanted them to ask to
[2:27:36] record that song and she did record it
[2:27:47] she introduced it to a whole new area
[2:27:52] people because she was involved with the
[2:27:54] gaze of singers and she went all over
[2:27:57] singing it as well and sings it so
[2:28:01] beautifully she does and I've heard many
[2:28:03] many many different ones sing it through
[2:28:06] the years and it blesses my heart it
[2:28:09] really blesses my heart I don't know one
[2:28:10] thing I might sing and I don't know I'm
[2:28:14] blessed is hearing the other ones all
[2:28:17] over God took a simple thought from my
[2:28:20] heart
[2:28:22] I never dreamed that would mean today
[2:28:26] what it meant then to see some of my
[2:28:30] loved ones walk away from this world
[2:28:33] some will were right there part of the
[2:28:36] recording of it and it just grew richer
[2:28:41] and richer to me as the years go by but
[2:28:45] I still have the testimony I couldn't
[2:28:49] walk away from it
[2:28:50] I couldn't it's a part of who I am
[2:28:53] it's made me who I am I can never deny
[2:28:57] those songs and Lord gave me and I'm
[2:29:01] looking for him to give me more I'm
[2:29:04] looking for more
[2:29:07] I just think God could be an investor
[2:29:11] just reuse it me birthday
[2:29:14] [Music]
[2:29:17] [Applause]
[2:29:22] just want to encourage you all different
[2:29:26] gifts your yield and let the Lord use
[2:29:28] your gifts man sometimes it's not for
[2:29:31] you but it's for others to bless others
[2:29:33] a song that mama wrote and when she said
[2:29:37] at the concert there she actually never
[2:29:39] sung the song itself but as pinna song
[2:29:42] has been taken by others and sing it and
[2:29:45] they've singing they've done you know
[2:29:47] really good jobs and it's one of those
[2:29:49] classics that just kind of stayed you
[2:29:52] know with you have been around for well
[2:29:54] over 20 years I believe still just you
[2:29:57] have an anointing that goes with it
[2:29:59] anybody that seems that just there's
[2:30:01] something there and I certainly for the
[2:30:03] season in which we live the words are
[2:30:06] very important Church keep keep your
[2:30:09] other brothers and sisters in prayer a
[2:30:12] man that got would just somehow let them
[2:30:16] see their airing way and be restored
[2:30:18] back to the truth amen sometimes you
[2:30:21] just get caught up in what everybody
[2:30:22] else is doing but got got a way of
[2:30:23] getting this people out of the middle
[2:30:25] and I believe that I believe that let's
[2:30:28] have a word of Prayer say man before we
[2:30:30] depart for today father we are grateful
[2:30:32] for your spirit God that we even feel
[2:30:36] right now in this place thank you for
[2:30:39] your anointing that destroys yokes thank
[2:30:42] you God for what you're doing thank you
[2:30:45] that on
[2:30:46] what even as this video was seen by
[2:30:49] others Lord that maybe something will
[2:30:52] strike the heart of a believer you just
[2:30:55] begin a talk you begin the pool God you
[2:30:59] pull them right out of the condition
[2:31:00] that they're in and begin to restore
[2:31:01] them back to truth but we believe that
[2:31:06] containment is not Lord to completely
[2:31:10] shut off and never never receive again
[2:31:13] but God is to restore is to protect us
[2:31:17] to restore is to do all of those things
[2:31:19] God that would just just help everybody
[2:31:21] Lord and that's that's our desire so I
[2:31:24] pray father that you would discipline to
[2:31:26] receive it in the way that you were
[2:31:28] trying to give it to us bless us as we
[2:31:31] prepare to leave this place but not your
[2:31:33] presence may we go rejoicing and
[2:31:36] meditating on the words that we've heard
[2:31:38] here today may you bring us back at the
[2:31:41] point of time Wednesday night Lord
