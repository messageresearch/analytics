we just open your holy precious word Lord may you just send your Holy Ghost and bring it to life before our very eyes may the word that you speak this evening Lord just be written upon our hearts Lord and let us not just be hearers of the word but doers of your holy precious word thank you for letting us just gather here together Lord uh in your presence once again may you just have the preeminence Lord from the opening prayer to the ending prayer we ask all these things in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen so let's open our Bibles to to um Exodus 14: 8 sorry verse 8 first say Amen when you get there how many believe the church is in Exodus today amen right to the promised land amen so we'll start at verse eight and the Lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of Egypt and he pursued after the children of Israel and the children of Israel went without with out with a high hand but the Egyptians pursued after them all the horses and Chariots of Pharaoh's and the horsemen in his army and overtook them en camping by the Sea beside uh perro before uh bapon and when Pharaoh Drew nigh the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were so afraid and the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord and they said unto Moses because there were no graves in Egypt hast thou taken us to die in the wilderness wherefore has thou dealt with us to carry us forth out of Egypt is not this the word that we uh did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians that we should die in the wilderness and Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show to you today for the Egyptians whom you've seen today you shall see them again no more forever you may be seated so we we just see a picture right there where the children of is Israel have finally gotten uh Liberation and freedom what they've been crying for and uh we see now that they're in a situation where they just see sea they just see behind them the enemy and right now they weren't looking by faith but they were looking by human emotions and so we see uh how the children of Israel reacted they said would would it be better for us just to be in Egypt serving them and but yet the very thing they were praying for was being fulfilled before their very eyes but they were scared to walk in what they prayed for and so I love what Moses said he he uh he didn't let the the gang saying of the people uh fear in him and he said unto the people fear ye not and stand still like we we a couple weeks ago we talked about be still and see the salvation of the Lord and we go to verse 14 the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace and we go to verse 15 the Lord said unto Moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward so a lot of times there's a season to cry out to the Lord but there also a season that we got to walk in because if the word is living inside you you can speak that word and you got to believe that the word is living inside you because if Jesus Christ is living inside you then the word living inside you but the key is you got to make sure you're feeding upon the word of God so that word can stay fresh inside of you amen let's keep going go to verse 16 but lift up thy rod and stretch out thy hand Over the Sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go on dry land dry ground through the midst of the sea and I and I behold I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians and they shall follow them and I will get me honor upon pharaoh and upon all his hosts and upon his chariots and upon his Horsemen and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh upon the Chariots and upon the horsemen and the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them and it came between the the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel and it was a cloud of Darkness to them so now look at this picture the children of Israel see that God is moving behind them protecting him it's like the armor of God you don't have anything behind you but it's God protecting behind you so we see that they're seeing this Supernatural Miracle but yet time after time we see during their Journey that they kept doubting God and and and thinking God couldn't take him but he he proved him that he was faithful time and time again so it shows me that just being in the Supernatural isn't enough but you got to receive what God is doing during that time in the Supernatural because they saw more things than we could ever see in our lifetime but yet they still failed to enter into the promised land so let's keep going we'll go to we'll jump to verse 21 and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong East Wind that all the night made the sea dry land and the waters were divided so all night they were seeing this they were walking and seeing this and the children is went to the midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on the right hand and the left hand and we'll jump to um let's go to verse 26 and we'll stop at 28 and the Lord said unto Moses stretch out thy hand over the sea that the waters May Come Again upon the Egyptians upon their chariots and upon the horsemen and Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the Sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared and the Egyptians fled against it the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the Sea and the waters returned and covered the Chariots and the horsemen and all the the host of pharaoh that came into the sea after them there remained not so much as one of them so God showed them that he was faithful once again God and their enemies they were in bondage for over 435 years they were no more and but yet as soon as they got out of that that that situation A a test came the waters were bitter they were thirsty and and and God had to show them once again even though they're complaining so now let's get right into we'll get right into a quote now so I love what brother Braham says in the Paradox in 1963 but if it's in the line of duty when God has commanded you to do something so I believe that God has commanded us to do something that we're in a a restoration season right and so like he said to Moses why cry to me speak to the children of Israel speak to the children people people today is crying all the time lord what next what next just speak and go forward that's right God has commissioned us to do something let's do it don't stand around and think about it how could it happen well this and that make any difference if God said do it anyhow he's still the god of Miracles so God is still the god of miracles in each one of our Lives he's he's still I mean us being here is a miracle just think of the life we used to live and what we are now that's a miracle in itself think about to to love your enemy with with perfect love that's a miracle within itself because human affili love can't go that far right right and so we just see that there's a time to cry out to God and there's a time to speak and walk forward cuz uh the Bible tells us that God likes to be reminded of his word the Bible even says that to bring your strong reasonings to God and so we all have strong reasonings I think a lot of times we're we're scared to take God out his word because if you do if you do take God out his word then he's going to fulfill his word constantly time and time again just like the children of Israel even with their unfaithfulness he still knew there was uh uh seed that he has to protect for for us to be here and so we see I want to get ahead of myself so let's go to Exodus 3 so we see in Exodus chapter 3 that this was the time to cry out to God and we'll see it right now he says verse 7 says and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and I have heard their Cry by reasons of their Taskmaster so that was a time that they they cried and that was a perfect time but in the time of the Red Sea it was not a time to complain and cry it was time to go forward because God had commissioned Moses he he showed the children of Israel that he he he Liber this was a season Liberation and all they had to do was trust they saw all the the fleas and the the firstborns being dead in Egypt all the the light and ghost and all these things they saw so all they had to do was what trust God and move forward they may not understood how it's going to happen but I'm at this point they could see that God doesn't isn't uh Bound by human uh human ability God God can do anything he wants to do but yet they still fail to see what God can do even though Time and Time think sometimes that we've kind of we uh put God in this box or we kind of limit God's Powers but we can't limit God's Powers because we see what he's doing around the whole world right now we we see uh uh the the Believers he's brought back into the church and it's our family members and we saw the beautiful healing on on Sunday all these things that God is still doing that we can't limit go just to a couple things when God restores something he's going to full restoration so we got to walk in that full restoration don't be dissatisfied with uh this some things that he did but God is looking to do many things in your life we still got another what 6 and a half months left of this year let God do exceedingly and abundantly in your life right now amen amen amen for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them so God knows your Sorrows he knows your pain all these things he says out of the hand of the Egyptians and bring them upto the land of a good land a large land to a land flowing with milk and honey and the place of the Canaanites and the hites and the amorites and the pites and the hites and the jezeb byes now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel is come onto me I have seen the oppression whereof the Egyptians oppress them but but now we see the Red Sea show down and we see them a different story that the same crying they were doing they're crying and complaining now and and I think I think a lot of times complaining will always hinder your faith because you're no longer looking at God but you're looking at the complaint and and now you're wor you're worshiping the complaint instead of worshiping The God Who can get you out of the situation and we we can't put anything any God before God and a complaint is putting something before God because when you're complaining your attitude isn't good and God says the right mental attitude God is always looking at the attitude that you have to in order to fulfill his word in your life life amen and we notice that the children of Israel were wondering and questioning why why would God bring us to the situation why would God bring us to a sea where there's no access to get out and why would he God let the enemy come behind us because God is trying to what eliminate the enemy in your life the the the the thing that's going that's going to stop you but yet they were too blind to be able to see that and amen let's go to um we'll go to another quote now amen and every man that's born again in Christ Jesus check this out everything you have need of your healing I'm read this again every man that's born again in Christ Jesus everything you have need of your healing Satan will afflict you sure he will but everything you have need of uh in this whole life's journey is in you right then and you and we are planted in Christ Jesus you see what I mean when you're born again and the baptism of the Holy Ghost has come into your heart you have everything that you have need of for your journey the the only thing you have to do is start drinking pushing out I believe he hears my anal my analysis of Christ Jesus he's the inexhaustible Fountain of Life every man that's planted in him can drink and drink and push out and push out to every check this out every Redemptive blessing that God has promised belongs to you every Redemptive blessing that God has promised belongs to you and it's your personal property and the devil has hasn't got any tied to it at all he hasn't got any legal rights his legal rights was spoiled at Calvary so now when he says that that everything you have need of is inside of you only thing is waiting for to be uh is waiting to be gerz by the Holy Ghost because God has to bring that in in to life before you and so he says you got to drink and drink and drink you got to constantly be reading the word because this word has all these promises but it needs to be brought to life by God himself because no man can bring to life for you I can't bring to life or the Troy can't but the very God Of Heaven can bring it to life for you because God has given these promises personally to you every promise is your property don't let the enemy take it away because he has no legal rights anymore at Calvary Jesus took every legal right that he had he snatched it out his hands and now you have the the legal document to sign a check Jesus is giving you a checkbook whatever needs you have you fill it out and you give it in that situation amen then if we're God's children by Heir then Heirs of the Kingdom Heirs of Abraham then we shall walk as our Father Abraham walked and call those things which are not as though they were if God has said they were if God said they are then we don't know how it's going to be but God said so we just believe it and move forward walking by faith what a beautiful life we may not know how our restoration is going to happen in our life and all these things are going to change but we can walk by faith knowing that God makes everything beautiful in his time that's what the scripture says so your situation may be chaotic but God promised to make it beautiful because God doesn't leave things undone we serve a God who who makes everything work together for your good as Romans 8:28 says just think about it think about Abraham a 100 years old yet many disappointments many upsets he had all like Christians do waiting on the promise but yet the Bible said that he stab Ed not at the promise of God through unbelief there's many things taking place famine distress and things happen but Abraham didn't stagger he still believed that God was going to give him that baby so there's going to be many things going to happen in our lives sicknesses and and disappointments and all you can name it but God is still faithful he's looking to see how you going to react to those things that are going to happen in your life are you going to just cow down and cry like the children of Israel or are you going to move forward in faith knowing that God is is going to change the situation that God is calling you to something much greater than what we realize he's calling us to he's calling us to higher Heights a more in Intimate more deep personal relationship with him so he can show us more things and what am I trying to say you've got to go back to the word of God to get back restoration right as brother Jack started the year off he said that we got to get back in step when we get back in Step guess what happens restoration happens we got to get back in our position our l the duty because if a army is fighting in a battle and and everybody's on this way and that way nobody's in harmony then they're not going to win the battle so the same thing with us we all have to be in harmony if we want to see things change in the M our midst in our church I believe Sunday was a little taste a little taste of what God has to come cuz I I just love the the the presence of the Lord there and just bringing us together and love one another and we got to we got to uh build momentum from that don't just let that be the climax of what God's doing because God that's not his climax he has much more for us in store but we have to walk into that amen amen let's go to Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and read verses um we'll read verses 1-9 this is very familiar scripture I'm I'm pretty sure everyone uh knows about this scripture amen so the Bible says in verse one I love how it just right off the bat to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven God chose this word restoration for this season because this was the perfect season for it he couldn't choose last year he didn't choose the year before but this was the perfect season for Restoration in our midst it may not be for somebody else might get this word but this word is for us and so we got to walk in that this season of restoration a time to be born a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away a time to Rend and a time to Sue and a a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of Peace what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he labor so we just see that there's a season for everything and we got to recognize that we're in this season where we got to speak we got to speak back the word of God we got to speak our our financial Deliverance our Liberation maybe something in your life that's been been bound all these years and it's a time to be free of it God doesn't want to see us in bondage he he doesn't whether it's Financial bondage where you have you have some vices or some issues family issues God doesn't want to see that all your life God want to see you take his word I said this before a long time ago but God has given us the authority to speak peace in a situation cuz the Bible says a soft answer turth away wrath he's given us the ability to speak joy into a situation all all these things he's given a Sons and Daughters of God this is the time to utilize them in this season because speak he told the same thing to Moses why cry speak and that's what we got to start doing uh it's good to cry in certain situations but it's a time that God is looking to see are you going to use the word that I've given you I've given you everything you need I've given you the most powerful weapon on Earth which is my word and we got to be willing to to use that word amen so so we just not notice let's go back to the children of Israel again notice there was a time to cry when they were in bondage right Egypt but at the moment the Red Sea Showdown it was not a time to cry they saw God do things but the thing was they had a big habit of looking at their situation every time they would doubt God they'll be they'll be putting the situation over God and that's why many times that got they died the Brazen serpent uh they're complaining about the Mana see all these things they were complaining about but yet they asked to be out of Egypt they they literally asked God they cried for hundreds of years to be out of Egypt but yet when they got out of Egypt they were ungrateful and that's one thing God doesn't like to see is ungratefulness because God didn't have to do anything for us he did it because he loved us and so we should be thankful for what we get see a lot of times we're looking at things we don't need and God has given the things you need in your life and and we need restoration we need his restoration and if we want to be in the kingdom of God we need to be restored back to who we were because this body you see me is not who I really am the body I see you is not who who we really are what who we really are is inside of here amen let's go to numbers we go to numbers 13 read verses 30 through 33 and Caleb so before I guess we'll paint a little picture so before um this moment where Caleb and Joshua were about to talk um the children of Israel uh they they picked out 12 Spies and they got a chance to see the land that God had promised them and it was all the land they was all that God said the grapes and and the land full of milk and honey all these things and then now is the time of Showdown where they're going to give a report of what they saw and Caleb steal the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are able to overcome it so Caleb and Joshua the same things that they saw the other 10 spies saw they saw but what they saw was that that God promised this land he said he's going to be with us he's going to send his Angel before us and this is land is for us but the other 10 spies they saw the obstacles and the Giants and instead of walking by faith they were walking by fear and every time you walk by fear God can't fulfill anything in your life because once again you're putting fear above Faith so let's keep going in the scripture says but the men that went with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we see that may be true but God is stronger than all that yeah you can't do it physically yeah if you go out there physically and try to fight him you will die but God didn't say you physically had to go do it and die he said I'll go with you he he even we'll get a little later down in the sermon what what he actually told to him but um and he said they are stronger than we and brought up into evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search is a land that eateth up the inhabitants therefore and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and they saw the Giants and the sons of anch which come of the Giants we were in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so we are were in their sight I want you to remember that God told them exactly how he's going to take them to the land he literally broke it down how exactly they're going to get the land and yet they forgot that he said that and we'll get a little later in that scripture of when he said that so now let's go to numbers 14 so I just love that I love the atmosphere that Caleb and Joshua were in the atmosphere of unbelief of fear of their life being threatened they still kept the atmosphere of Faith they didn't let a bunch of game singers and doubters affect their personal walk with God because they knew the god that they saw was going to do the same thing he did in Egypt he did in the Red Sea he's doing the same exact thing in situation and I love too how that even it was we could say it wasn't fair they had to walk 40 years but I don't see Joshua and Caleb complaining that they had to walk another 40 more years and in fact I I believe they were even stronger after those 40 years getting the land that God promised them so that's something we could look at as an example that if they didn't let their faith get hindered then who are we to let our faith get hindered because they could they could walk they and they didn't have the Holy Ghost they weren't filled with the Holy Ghost but they could still stand upon the word of God and we got Christ Living inside of us the hope of glory so what excuse do we have let's keep going let's go to um verse one and all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried and the people wept that night so look they're crying again once again not that season to cry and complain never ceasing to cry and complain and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would God that we had died in the land of Egypt look they said it again again they saying this very same thing God took you out in the Red Sea and yet you complaining again the land of Egypt or where God had died in the wilderness one one thing we will always always kill our faith is is complaining every time and wherefore let's go to the next verse and wherefore ha the Lord brought us into this land to Fall by the sword uh and our wives and our children should be prey were it better for us to return into Egypt and Aaron fell on their faces before the Assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel and Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the son of Jeff which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes look what they said right here he said and they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel saying the land which we possess through the search it is exceedingly good land if the Lord Delight in us then he will bring us into the land and give us the land which floweth with milk and honey only he's giv a warning right here only Rebel not ye against the Lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bread for us their defense is departed from them and the Lord Is With Us fear them not so Joshua and Caleb weren't looking at their stature what looking at their weapons their Armory but they were looking at God because it don't matter how big you are how strong you think you are God can knock you down like you're nothing and so we got to remember that it doesn't matter if if work's going against you if your whole family's going against you if whoever's going against you if God is for you who can be against you the devil can send a thousand thousand men Army to your doorstep and just like we saw the Prophet Elijah he had those angels fighting for him and he opened gaz's eyes and he saw those angels is fighting so the same thing God's fighting for you no matter what you're going through let's go to verse 10 amen but all the congregation B SN and stoned them with stones and the glory of the Lord appeared in a tabernacle of a congregation before all the children of Israel so I want you to notice that they were still standing strong even though they're going to get stoned in the situation and so it shows me that your your walk shouldn't be based upon somebody else's walk because not everybody can see what you see in a certain time and season and and I'm pretty sure when we first give our hearts to the Lord and walk into the message of the hour our family didn't agree with it I remember I got kicked out my house for believing the message of the hour but one thing I didn't let that stop me I was homeless for a second not for a second but my my uh I got moveing with my grandma but I didn't know where I was going to go but I knew God was going to give me a place to stay and he gave me a place like three hours later I had like I had a place to stay and and so it's just like having that faith in God uh no matter what so if we had Faith to believe a message that we never heard before and and to serve a God who we never served before and we he showed us time and time again that he can be trusted that that he can change a situation at any given moment then we got to keep walking in what he's telling us to walk into because God's telling us this is the season where I I need to restore you I need to bring things back to to to to the the fullness of them amen let's keep going amen so one thing I noticed uh when Joshua's name is always mentioned it says says Joshua the son of nun and and so I looked that up in the Hebrew uh the word nun it means faithful one so I I just looking that Joshua and his dad was the faithful one so I'm I'm believing this that that uh that his dad this is just told him constantly and constantly how that they were going to be delivered one day and this and that and and maybe even though he didn't get to see it but his son got to see it and I believe that he he rubbed off on his his son because that name means faithful one and when I see Joshua he's a faithful one he he in the midst with everybody going against him he still stand he still stood strong with Caleb and Moses and Aaron even though there was no place to stand he still stood upon the rock amen let's go to Exodus 23 so I was explaining later or explaining earlier how that that God literally told the children of Israel how he's going to take him into the land like he literally told them exactly how how he's going to do it but yet they failed to to take God of his word and we'll start here in uh verse 20 so it said the Bible says in verse 20 behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way I I think that'll be enough for me if God say he sent an angel before me I think that's enough I could have enough Faith to believe that whatever comes in my way I can walk through it because he sent an angel before me and he said to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him now giving them a warning right here beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if thou shall indeed obey his voice obedience is better than sacrifice right amen and do all that I speak that then I will be an enemy unto thy enemies and an adversary unto thy adversaries just look at that promise right there I believe that promise is still going on today for us for my angel shall go before thee and bring thee unto the amorites and the hies and the pites and the Canaanites and the Hittites and the jezeb byes and I will cut them off th Thou shalt not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do their works but Thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images and He Shall Serve the Lord your God and he shall bless thee bless thy bread and thy water and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee there shall nothing cast their young nor Barren in thy land the numbers of thy days I will fulfill verse 27 I will send my fear before thee and will destroy all the people to whom Thou shalt come and I will make that all thy enemies turn their backs unto thee and I will send Hornets before thee which shall drive out the hivites and the Canaanites and the hites before Thee I will not drive them out before thee in one year lest th become the land become desolate and the Beast of the field multiply against the so so God does everything perfect so there's certain things that he can't take out your life for in a certain season because you're not you're not ready for because if he did it's going to utterly destroy you and so we see now that God is a the perfect season for us to be in restoration because we couldn't take it last year because we weren't ready yet but this year as we see the building is coming closer and closer you see what got guys at Sunday school we got adult Sunday school and a kids Sunday school we see all these things is happening slowly God is building our ranks our numbers our church is growing people are moving here and God is doing all these things before the great Exodus we go into the church because God is taking us into that church this year I I believe it by faith I'm claiming it by faith and so God doesn't God just doesn't start doing things and things start happening like this just just to do it but it's a perfect purpose behind it it's a season for us to happen and so we got to just be thankful that that God is looking at our faithfulness in this little church yeah we may we maybe we don't want to break down every service but I rather be break down every service and have a place to have a church than not have a church because God has blessed us with this this beautiful building it's not about the building you're in but we're the church all right we we can have church in the parking lot we can have church wherever we wherever we can but I'm thankful that we're here today because God has taken us step by step by step this is a build a building step till we get to our our building amen so like I said before we just see in the scripture how God broke it down plainly to them it was almost like a step-by-step GPS but yet they still couldn't fall into Faith because the Bible tells us that they uh they didn't enter in because their unbelief that the the word wasn't mixed with faith in them and so we got to mix our faith with the the word because the word is forever settled in heaven when when God speaks something it's going to happen whether it's next week or next year it's going to happen no matter what but Jo faith has to line into it see the word I said this before the word of God is not going to conform to your unbelief but you got to conform to the word of God see we see all the all these things I heard churches now are having bars and alcohol served in there and and and like what is that I I visited this church one time it had a you walk in it's a fullsize soccer field I'm like are we like is this church or is this a like a sporting event and and so I see all these things where the church the churches of these days are trying to compromise to the people because they want numbers and the thing is it's not about numbers cuz we see Joshua and Caleb if they looked about the numbers it was just a two people think about that two out of a million people and and so it's not about numbers always it's it's about the quality of the people I believe we got quality people here I believe we got born again Holy Ghost filled Christians in this church and I I believe we're all walking into that new building together amen amen amen so one more quote here and then we'll close here in next couple minutes so like like I see once again I just see these scriptures here this just laid out to us and the Bible says they're given to be in amples for us and it says in Hebrews it talks about how that that we can we can have that same type of uh issue if we don't hearken into what God's saying to us because we're not exempt for that we we make Free Will and free choices every day so we got to make the choice to to walk in what God's speaking to us and we got to make the choice to serve God each day see it doesn't matter how good of a week you had last week what matters is what are you going to do today with the life that God has G say again what are you going to do today with the life that God has giv you today cuz that's the most important thing I believe if you ask God for your heart and say Lord what do you want me to do today I believe he'll lead you and guide you to that because our heart needs to be to to to to uh help his the furtherance of his kingdom because he he used somebody to bring us the kingdom and so we ought to be used by God to bring somebody else that light hey they may not accept it that's okay but the thing is I'd rather bring the light to him so they make that choice and me not to bring that brother Bram said this statement he doesn't want to he didn't want to be um oh yeah he didn't want to be in the day of judgment and say the person say why didn't you tell me why didn't you give me a chance I want to be like Paul and said my hands are clean I I I I I I did everything I could I I I became thing all things to all men that I might win some and the thing is you're going to win some you might one one out of a 100 you never know but the thing is I rather have one Soul than no souls because the prophet said that one soul is what worth more than 10,000 worlds so you were worth more than 10,000 worlds to God think about that and that's a lot of Worlds right there think about that imagine 10,000 Earths that's a lot amen amen so like I said and God understands our Frailty our mistakes and mishaps and God understands those things but we can't use our human uh failures or our human our humanness to be an excuse a lot of times we'll we'll use oh God knows my heart yeah he knows your heart but don't use it as a crutch just to do what you want to do because God is looking to see God puts us in certain situations to see how we're going to handle it he he he may increase our workload he may whatever he may some family problems might arise up and he's looking to see what we're going to do in that situation and that's where the test really happens because the the I'll tell you this we're not going to get any less busier we're going to get more busy as as the world gets darker and darker we're get more busier and busier and God's looking to see how we're going to use that that time because we can use the excuse of I'm too busy to pray uh with quality or I'm too busy to read with quality we can make all these excuses but the only person is going to hinder is yourself and so we like I said always say before we got to carve time out because if we want restoration we got to make time for restoration because God made time to give us this word so we got to make time to walk in that word because we got to catch that Vision the Bible says the people perish without a vision so we need to walk in the vision that God has given us and that vision is is going to bring fruit every time God speaks is going to bring fruit and God is looking to see the fruit in our life because it even says in John how that we got to be connected to the vine and if we're connected to the vine the restoration's yours I don't care what the devil says I don't care what he brings before you if you're connected to the vine the restoration is yours and God will bring it to pass just in closing I'll read this this last quote we thank thee for the pillar of fire moving with us today who we thank thee for the signs and wonders we thank thee for the restored Mana of Glory the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be every generation we thank thee that we have tasted and seen the Lord is good oh God grant that every heart will be molded into one great big unit of the Holy Ghost that the that Holy Ghost Church will move forward I believe he's speaking to us and the power of God will sweep into this building right now and baptize every believer baptize save every sinner heal every sick person Lord and get glory for thy name's sake in Jesus Christ's name we pray let's say let's bow our heads in a word of prayer and we'll just just uh thank God dear Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for this Precious Moment Lord this precious opportunity Lord just to be in your house Lord just knowing Lord that this year is still young Lord just seeing that it's it's almost the end of May Lord and and father you're still working Lord and oh God may we not miss what you're doing in this season as that song says Lord may we just be in the proper place that we need to be Lord so you can just bring Restoration in each one of our Lives Lord just restore back the the the brotherly kindness Lord restore back the love Lord in families Lord just help us Lord just to to not be a hindrance Lord but to be a help to uh this this season of restoration Lord because oh God we're looking for big things to happen Lord and I remember our pastor always says we got to ask the big things as well as the little things Lord because you're a God who does many mighty Miracles still Lord you still operating the gifts Lord of your Bible Lord you you're stilling all these things Lord you're growing our church in numbers Lord you we see the the mothers just having kids Lord and and we see people just moving here Lord and wanting to move here Lord we see a deacon raised another Deacon raised up here in the church Lord we just see you just moving Sunday school this this just growing Lord we see all these things happening Lord this this uh we see the kids Lord just getting a hold of instruments Lord we're just seeing all the potential that's going to happen in our new church Lord and so father when we walk into the new church lord it's going to be miraculous lord it's going to be a breath of of fresh air Lord and father may we be faithful until that very moment we walk in Lord and after that moment let us be even more faithful Lord because father you you hear what we pray for how we want a building Lord and what you're doing right now Lord you're setting it up in order so we can walk in I I just think of a Time Lord when when Paul had to go through a window Lord you made that window just specifically for him to get Lord out Lord and that church that you have for us is specifically fit for us Lord You're just waiting for that perfect moment to give it to us Lord and God we we just want to wait patiently for you Lord because father your timing is always perfect Lord You're a god of perfect timing Lord may we just have the patience Lord may we have the faith of Abraham Lord and had the patience of Daniel Lord just to think that that your servant Daniel he waited 21 days father may we have that type of patience Lord like Daniel Lord and father the Lord is waiting upon you Lord because you're working everything out right now Lord to the counsel of your Good Will and almighty God we thank you for all these things and we thank you for and we're going to praise you right now for this building Lord because we we already know it's happening Lord right now we're going to praise you

grandchildren and how they'll take this message and I think that's probably about that age group amen so I'm I'm I'm uh excited Amen to see these young men oh father that's that's uh the way they're
