========================================
[Music] this evening time of bible study amen um let us go before the throne in prayer amen just now most gracious heavenly father lord god we come before you god thy heads bowed in our hearts bow to you lord god asking you o father god as we approach the lord god this time of father god of studying lord as we look through your word or father god we know lord that any man can open the pages of this bible or lord god but it takes you o father god to give revelation o lord lord god we ask you father that you anoint the scriptures anoint these words oh lord god may you take me father and hire me behind the cross lord god that your word is the only thing that penetrates our father lord god we ask you o lord god and this our lord god to touch those o father god that need a touch from you oh lord god as lord god we're still o father god in uh sort of an altered state lord god and we're streaming this evening o lord god i ask you o father god to give a special anointing to those o father god that might be tuning in o lord god may they hear from you lord may they hear your voice so father god through these words o lord god we ask these blessings in jesus precious name i pray amen amen truly is a blessing and an honor to be before you once again this evening i ask for you to uh keep me lifted up in prayer amen that um amen that uh god would be able to use this yielded vessel amen for his will and his glory amen it's my humble desire that all glory goes to him uh i am truly uh nothing before you i'm no great man no great preacher amen but uh i just come to do what the lord has laid upon my heart amen as we um begin to get into the word kind of picking up from where i was at last week and just going a little further in that um i like to title this if i may this spirit of obedience for the third exodus spirit of obedience for the third exodus amen if we grab our bibles we'll go straight to the word i'd like to read amen a passage of scripture here starting with joel chapter 2. man joel chapter 2 will begin reading from the uh 25th the 25th verse amen and we'll kind of go over um [Music] into revelation 4 amen and then uh we'll just go from there amen beginning that joel chapter 2 25 it says uh and i will restore to you the years that the locusts hath eaten and the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god and he hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed so god is here saying that he is going to restore amen the years amen that the locust has eaten the cankle worm the cattle pill and the palmer worm and we understand that these this insect is just described as the same insect amen revealing itself in four different stages amen let us go to revelation four and the seventh the seventh chapter i'm sorry the uh the fourth chapter in the seventh verse revelation the fourth chapter and the seventh the seventh verse hey man i'm in the fourth chapter in the seventh verse and it says and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast was like a calf and the third beast had the face of a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle now we see that these four this four stage insect here and that he's talking about that that that uh god said he will restore the years that it has eaten amen and then we see here in in revelation that these um uh uh what they are are anointings the first beast was like a lion the second beast like a calf and uh the third beast has that the face of a man and that's very significant and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle these are the anointings for each age or for that time that god has to combat the spirit amen of these insects amen so in other words these anointing amen that is that is released upon the earth and needs in these four beasts amen is is is sort of this insect my my father was a a a one a great gardener and and and we know that gardeners sometimes the uh uh they they use insecticide now my father got away from insecticide and he learned certain tricks and different things to keep bugs and things off of his uh uh uh uh what he's planted by what he plant next to it amen so uh but but but but but but these anointings amen is it sort of works as an insecticide amen to these uh uh uh this insect amen as is it is it is released in the land amen to combat amen what god is doing amen last week i kind of likened this the the building of a temple amen taking this taking the with the word from from as solomon built the temple dedicated it was it was it was a temple but the in in the old testament as a natural type but the spiritual type was that the temple was a body read in hebrews he said that a body thou shalt prepare so the temple amen this tree amen that that that is speaking of that these locusts is eaten at these locusts is trying to destroy is a man the the kingdom of god amen uh we we understand that this that that when we when we speak of these things we speak of these things a man uh in in in a uh in a broad matter let me explain what i'm saying we know that in genesis is the seed chapter so we understand that revelation is the harvest so that what happened in in in genesis it is just multiplied in revelation it is the the the revelation is genesis in symbol form multiplied amen so we see in in genesis that that that there was a woman by the name of eve that was deceived and then when we come over into genesis into revelation here we see that there is a woman amen that it will be deceived amen once again amen but this is not just a one woman it's meaning amen that makes up a a a a body it makes up an entity the church amen amen so we'll we don't want to go too far to that we're going to get into that a little later amen so but revelation here these four beasts these different natures released as an anointing on the people of god to overcome the enemy of their age so this flying eagle is the anointing that has been released upon the elect in this age that enables us amen to fly above the thinking and the understanding of the false church in this age amen that enables us to to to to rise above amen that level of thinking amen through a prophetic vision we understand that in the scripture a prophet amen is always likened unto an eagle a prophet amen another word is a seer amen and up under a prophetic anointing which is an eagle anointing amen you're able to rise above a little higher and able to see afar off amen you're able to the higher you go i leave sunday uh brother kwaku sort of hit this he uh the the higher you go amen the eagle has a unique ability that his vision amen is he's old he's an ordained bird he's a special built bird amen by god that the higher he goes the keener his vision gets amen if you notice sometimes when you go up higher amen the higher you go the greater your perspective amen there's an old saying that sometimes you can't see the forest for the trees why because you're you're right there among them but if you can ever get lifted up amen and above the entire thing you can see oh wow now i got a better perspective of what's really happening amen and that's what that eagle anointing does it gives us a man the right perspective amen that we can see amen what the tricks of the enemy we can see amen what the devil is doing amen we can see amen what god is doing amen so revelation 3 amen uh 18 amen revelation 3 18 says i counseled thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire now now it's cold outside but it ain't all that cold in here i'm gonna have to take this jacket off hey man i counseled the dubai of me now now now who counsels i counsel so the the council the one doing the counseling here amen is the lord he is the one doing the council amen and he is the one that you must buy of him gold that is tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white raiment that thou mayest be clothed the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with an eye so that thou mayest see again here we see the emphasis is on this age of the importance of being able to see the bible teaches us that uh uh uh this seeing and and we'll we'll we'll kind of back that up by the scripture to see amen is a revelation it means to understand to have an understanding now now now now if if a person a man was was literally naturally blind amen uh uh they have a a a a diminished level of understanding of where they may be or what's in front of them amen or what's going on around them amen because they really can't see amen but so so so so so being able to see a man like i said give you a perspective of what is happening around you so we take this this uh natural ability and we magnify it into the spirit world into a spirit realm to be able to see amen what uh what what the satan is doing in this hour that he has been doing to understand the tricks over thousands of years and even thousands of years ahead amen we see that amen that this is what jesus said i'll build my church on a revelation and the gates of hell shall not amen prevail against it so the counsel given by god is here that our spiritual eyesight must be sharp and clear in this age and so we realize that this is the most deceitful age deceitful i say we realize it but i i imagine some people just really don't realize it amen uh it is the most deceiving age the serpent beguiled eve the word beguiled means that he tricked her or seduced her into his thinking by how false teaching and when this happened amen a seed was planted into the womb of her mind into her thinking that caused her to disobey the word of god we're going to get into that a little further later let me stay with my notes i don't want to get ahead of myself so we see that the eyesight of this age by sending us to isaf in the form of the teaching of the word by a end-time vindicated prophet is that eagle anointing spoke about there in revelation amen so we see this while we must supply this ointment of the revealed word of the message of the owl to our eyesight of our standing or we will be walking around blind in this age like everyone else amen so we see in genesis you have one woman eve who was deceived in revelation you have a whole world who is deceived by the same thing but in a multiplied form as i said earlier genesis is the seed form of the same thing in revelation in a harvest form amen so we see here that the reason i'm sorry in 1963 let's go to 1963-0322 the fifth seal i like to read from that 63 03 22 the fifth seal now while she's getting that the church goes up in a sense that is actually the start of the rapture i made a statement last week that we are potentially in the resurrection a resurrection is someone coming back from the dead a resurrection is something that uh uh is being raised from from the dead we see that the resurrection the most notable christ being resurrected amen after amen calvary amen there was another resurrection amen where he called lazarus from the grave lazarus was resurrected from the grave amen another form of resurrection amen is when you who are dead in sin and trespasses amen dad amen in your sins amen resurrected to a newness of life amen by the revelation of the word by an acceptance amen of calvary amen if this same spirit the bible says that raise christ from the dead dwells in you it will also quicken your mortal body quicken your mortal body amen so we we we realize that our bodies have to be quickened amen quicken means that it has has has to be ignited amen amen by the revelation of the word to receive a body change what quickens the holy spirit we're going to get a little deeper into that but what actually does it amen is the revealed truth that eagle anointing amen that is giving us a greater understanding of truth in this hour amen that takes us to a higher level in christ jesus who are seated with him in heavenly places amen as he is resurrected we become our level of thinking our level of understanding has risen from old dead denominational creeds amen to a understanding a revelation of who we are in this hour amen exactly where we're at in this hour what's going on in this hour amen a revelation of who we are amen that very words amen that very understanding that revelation is the actual that gives us that quickening power amen that literally begins to change amen we are being changed right now from glory to glory a lot of people are misunderstood amen by uh a lack of understanding that is that that that we will be uh uh uh uh we will receive a body change amen but before there's going to be a literal body change there must be a change amen in our thinking there must be a change in our attitude there must be a change amen in our walk we'll get into that a little bit what is our and then walk bible says that how can two walk except they agree amen to be in agreement amen with some one is to be in fellowship to be in fellowship amen let us move on so we see here if you have the quote that in the fifth seal 87 paragraph 87 i'm sorry but the reason that he reveals the reason that he reveals it he says as i understand it that it is because the mystery of the book of redemption as far as the antichrist being revealed and at the time the church is gone and these things don't even happen in the church age at all that's right they're away from the church age the church absolutely is raptured at this time talking about uh uh thank you my brother it's talking about here between revelation 4 and revelation 19. amen church absolutely raptured at this time the church goes up in the fourth chapter of revelation and does not return till it comes back with its king in the 19th chapter this is the fifth seal now but these seals here are revealing what has been what is and what will be see and now what was to be for the church this age was revealed by these seals now watch what takes it so in a sense as i said the church is actually in the rapture because this is what has began to elevate her level of thinking amen to have the faith let me let me move on let me let me read them the voice of the message of the owl in other words you must first be caught up into the revelation of the word that will mature you into rapturing faith it will mature you into rapturing faith before you can physically change and caught up in a physical rapture at the last trump that is why the shout is the first part of the rapture it is to get your attention process because without the message there can be no faith released for a rapture to take place amen remember noah was in preparation for a hundred and twenty years before he physically taken up above judgment in the ship just as we have also been in preparation under a prophet's message for many years so if so so so so if we are caught up in the fourth chapter of revelation and return don't return until the 19th chapter then everything between the fourth chapter and the 19th chapter is a revelation being revealed to the bride right now amen what has been happening since we have been gathered up higher into this eagle message i made a statement last week that it's gathering time we are to begin matthew the 24th chapter the 18th first matthew the 24th chapter and the 18th verse says amen i'm sorry 24 28. the 28th amen it says for wheresoever the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together now see we're talking about here an eagle anointing amen and and and and if you're up under the anointing of that eagle that eagle amen at feeding time they gathered together one of the things that i noticed amen that in this time we talking about those four stage insects and i made the statement about how that insect eats away at the bride tree what is it god said in joel that he's going to restore it but at the time of the harvest here comes an invasion of locusts to eat away at what god has been restoring what god has been restoring so we see in this hour that there's a great spirit that is being released amen upon the earth that it uh uh uh upon the people to cause a man a separation amen to cause turmoil we see that they're threatening to close the churches we see that amen as as a result of what we have right now this is that locust that is trying to break the fellowship by this chewing locust that is eating the leaves of the tree the leaves of the tree is the fellowship of the people now i'm not talking about just getting together and lollygagging i'm talking about the bride of jesus christ coming together to worship amen we talking about amen the the rustling in the mulberry tree that when the when the when the wind begins to blow through the leaves or the marbles you say what's that that's the people worshiping god the tree is in a revival so what is that that's a spirit released in this time amen in abundance to divide i said last week dividing families dividing co-workers friends don't even speak to each other no more i hear so many uh uh uh say well now you know what you're who your real friends are because of her politics that is the locust being released from the bottomless pit upon the people in this hour amen yes luke 17 luke 17 first chapter um i have here and i was hoping to get through this today amen amen i think i might have nope i'm sorry 1737. luke 17 37. i was going to really go into that a little deeper but for the sake of time i won't but i want to read this scripture here and they answered and said unto him where lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is tither with the eagles be gathered together amen the eagles will be gathered together so we see again here at this last day there is a gathering there is a gathering amen and not just a physical gathering amen but there is a fellowship of common thinking there is a a union a binding a man of of of of a binding of love around the scripture amos 3 3 says how can two walk together except they agree walking together has to do with fellowship amen as you walk with god and i walk with god we're both walking with god we are in fellowship with him so what does that do for us that binds us even closer together amen understanding that we are a bride making herself ready for a husband there is a invisible union going on a union a man with jesus christ and a union of a body amen of believers amen for a rapture there is a gathering there is a binding going on amen but we see the spirit of this time is trying to come against that but we will get into that a little bit more as we go along please go to the uh well i'll just read this because it'll probably be a little bit tough to go to the lady'll see in church age 3 27. now this messenger of malachi 4 revelation 10 7 is going to do two things according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers 1 2 he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be divinely revealed these divinely revealed mystery truths that will literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers exactly so so in order for the bride to go up in the rapture at the last trump she must first be part of the shout and the voice as the process of the rapture we must first be taken up higher so that we can be shown things that we have never seen before so that we can be shown amen uh and that is now that things that are to come and so from revelation 4 to revelation 19 that is what's being shown to us now at this time under this message so if you are sitting in a church that the only preaching is a good denominational living standards then that is not going to prepare you to receive faith because it is the mystery truths revealed to you that will literally do it we should teach good living standards i am not saying that you don't preach good wholesome living standards but that will come with the baptism of the holy ghost that will come with the baptism of the holy ghost but good living is just good living the rich young ruler lived good he he was he live had good moral standards but he didn't follow jesus in other words he wasn't obedient to the word the bible in matthew talks about those ten virgins five having oil in their lamps all had lamps but five had all in their lamps and the other five didn't so good moral living standards is just having the lamp it's just having the lamp because see when you get the oil in your lamp what does it do it will light a path in the darkness that you can see see the holy ghost in you would do what it would lead you and guide you into all truth you can't have the holy ghost and bug the word of god now you can have a good feeling because the rain falls on the just as well as the unjust you can speak in tongues and have dreams and visions and shout and go to church and have a wonderful time and fee and and fear and i mean just have a ball just worshiping the rain rain is coming down everybody is just worshiping but what is it quickening what is it quickening on the inside is the word life growing in you are you hungering that little lily is hungering for life it is pressing up through all of the darkness reaching to the sun amen it comes it shoots up a little spurt and maybe one or two little leaves amen but it's getting it's it's it's it's raised from the sun and the rain falls on it and as it just wants more and more and more but the weed does the same thing but what is it is it are you producing fruit are you growing and producing fruit amen the seed that was planted amen there is there's let me put it this way there's only one form of eternal life amen and that seed amen is was was was was god himself zoe his own life that is the spirit that must be in you and that seed amen would do what lead you and guide you into all truth let me go on because we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna break into a little bit more of this time is getting away from me already exodus 19. you have seen what i did unto the egyptians 1904 exodus 19 4. ye have seen what i did unto the egyptians and how i bear you on eagle's wings and brought you into myself so we see this eagle anointing was even back there amen with moses he told i beared you up on eagles wings and brought you out of what dead conditions of bondage out of egypt where into the light of a new land amen that's what's going on today amen let's see here i want to skip down a little bit for the sake of time and they heard a voice of god read from genesis uh 3 8 and they heard the voice of god lord walking in the garden in the cool of the evening in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden we see that eve amen saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eye there we go again pleasant to the eye and the tree uh was to be desired to make one wise so what did eve do eve took education and man's thinking over the word of god so when when this happens what did it do we see that it broke fellowship with god it broke fellowship with god in the beginning man and a woman and woman listened to each other to and uh uh uh there was there was there was a union there was an order a man in the garden there was no strife there was no arguing there was no bickering there was it was it was it was peaceful but we see what happened is she began to listen to another voice apart from the word of god they hearkened to a voice that conveyed an idea that actually sounded quite reasonable quite reasonable the problem was the idea was contrary to god's word this is why we had to have in this age a restoration this is why we had to have a man an eagle anointed in this age that would take us and raise us above amen the nonsense amen that is being brother brother brother precious brother quaker said sunday that we must be in tune now when when when tuning a radio we all know if you're looking for a specific station and you may not know the call numbers or whatever you go up and down up and down the dial you're turning the dial and you hear all kinds of voices one may sound real good and you it may catch your attention and you stop just for a little bit nine times out of ten if you stop for a little while and begin to listen you're gonna leave it there that's what eve did she stopped and she listened just for a little while and it began to sound good to her now it began to sound good to her she began to receive a man the anointing that it was projecting the spirit that it was projecting and what did it do it planted a seed that altered her thinking contrary to god's word and by this my brothers and sisters what did it do we see this was the beginning of the fall amen that caused them to break fellowship to lose fellowship with god notice carefully here eve had received what seemed to be a higher education to that of the word education is all right science is all right but you can't put it above the word of god that is that tree of knowledge and good and evil i read earlier eve took of that tree by her receiving into her thinking her mind and then there was a seed of discrepancy to the word planted that caused her to go contrary and the ultimate end was what they began to realize the shame of their nakedness the shame of their nakedness see before then they had a veil that they didn't they didn't see it because there was no shame in it there was no shame so they didn't even realize revelation 3 amen 17 because thou says that i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and know it's not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor now look at this and blind and naked this is this lady of seeing church age this is not the bride why because the bride of jesus christ has received man what has taken place amen and this is she is she is she is up under an eagle anointing so up under that eagle anointing what is happening under that eagle there's a counseling going on revelation 3 18 he says i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich now see in revelation seeing they they they're rich with what rich with goods and have need of nothing but you see here there's another group that he's talking about here in revelation in in the 18th verse that is being counseled amen by me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raymond oh my it's a whole different kind of rich that thou mayest be closed no longer really like that that cloth and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i said that thou mayest may see amen so the anointing of the assad is what that eagle anointing being under that eagle anointing which is what a special teaching to do what to produce a rapturing faith but we see that when that happens that rapturing faith that that that that caucus that food amen at this time has been put out and the eagles amen are hungry thirsty amen commanded to eat and be full eat amen because these literal truths is what's going to literally change your body but what's happening there's an invasion of locusts to divide the people to separate them to interrupt what god is doing but he can't because of the teaching of the message we're not blind to his tricks anymore why because we have an eagle anointing we are under a prophetic anointing amen we know that people sometimes can disagree with one another just like i was talking about sometimes when people disagree with one another what does it do it breaks their fellowship it breaks their association they can no longer walk together because to truly be in fellowship and in oneness with someone who have been first you must first be in a union in an agreement an agreement is a spiritual thing of your thoughts and someone else's thoughts being in the same way of thinking and reasoning amen one of the hardest things in this world is for people to agree on anything everybody has an opinion but we have an absolute there is an absolute you don't know what it is love the lord with all your heart says lean not into your own understanding don't fall out with people that's the locust we're supposed to be producing fruit love joy peace patience long suffering kindness in spite of what the locusts are doing why because they can't touch the bride we'll get into that it's in revelation 9. as i said before amos 3 3 how can two walk together except they agree walking together is symbolic of being in agreement genesis 5 22 enoch walked with god after he begot methuselah 300 years and begot sons and daughters and all the days of enoch was 365 years and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him walking with god translates you from mortal to immortality i'm gonna say that again when you walk with god it changes you when you walk with god it elevates you the more you walk with god the more you rise above the thinking of this world the more you walk with god you rise above the thinking of denominational creeds and dogmas because you're in fellowship with the very life of god zoe you're in fellowship enoch is a type of us in this age remember he said i read there in the lady of sin and said uh uh uh that the bride will go up before any tribulation but what's happening here is there's a revelation going on amen of of what has has happened what is happening and what's to come see to do what produce a rapturing faith that's what these seals is literally turning our hearts amen so enoch typed but that before noah and the judgment of the flood enoch walked with god and received the body chain when eve agreed with the serpent and disagree with the word of god then that is what broke fellowship between god and man at the beginning so it would have to take man to come back into full agreement with the thought and mind of god in order to restore fellowship of what man lost in the garden a perfect oneness turn to the message if you will god's perfecting church 1954 december 4. preach december 4. in 1954 paragraph 24 this is all about relationship of man being restored back with god again by the means of being restored to the correct thinking of the word this is that eagle anointing to rise above that's lifting us up into heavenly places amen notice you have those four beasts the eagle being the ark the lion the ox the man and the eagle notice the eagle is the only one of those that is able to take flight all the other three are all earthbound that eagle is the only one that is able to to to fly above amen and see far amen it says here 24th chapter amen now notice here just a little farther as he went on god making himself known through fatherhood through sonship and through the holy spirit now see he brought into himself a blood cell wrapped himself into this broke forth a blood at calvary throwed out his blood that he might bring through this blood cleansing by the same atonement taking every sinner and cleanse him bring him into a fellowship that he can talk with man walk with man like he did in the garden of eden before sin ever come on the earth and our relationship is restored to jehovah through the offering of his son the lord jesus this is all about relationship of man being restored back to god as i said sunday i made the statement and i had this already in my notes the three things that man lost when he left eden he lost eternal life that had to be purchased lost fellowship with god that had to be restored and he lost dominion over the earth so we see the cleansing restored partial fellowship it was god it was emmanuel god with man when christ amen took that blood cell wrapped himself in a blood cell created a body amen he was able to walk once again with man with man but it wasn't until amen calvary and the resurrection and then those 120 receiving the holy ghost that he became god in man so what now it was that seed being planted into that earth again to produce what that tree to begin amen uh-oh that tree began to sprout new wings no new life once again so that at the harvest time amen it's no longer just adam it's no longer just eve but it's a gathered church and a many member body amen all producing fruit what is in fruit seed to reproduce the word again in that fruit is seed so what does that mean that in you with the baptism motor go holy ghost you have dominion the potential the power lies within you to produce once again the the the power amen lies within you amen to be amateur gods upon the earth god in man amen these things this level of thinking comes by a prophetic anointing so when within uh you so when within you you disbelieve god's word the very core of what you are as a spirit and soul is separated from god and fellowship by you and god being different in your spirit of agreement and everything that disagrees with god becomes separated in fellowship from god and anything that's separated dies dominion over the earth that was what adam and eve to have full control over the earth over all nature over bird over the animal life over the fish life over the body life over the wind over the weather there was no death anywhere genesis 1 28 god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish to see over the files of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth amen so back to revelation three eighteen i counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire and that may be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be closed they became naked in genesis but here the lord is telling us how to be clothed again and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes what i sat so that we can see in genesis eve eyes of understanding will open by obedience to a false word of the serpent her eyes was open to a false word which caused what for her to realize that she was naked there was a shame attached to her nakedness cause here to become naked but is how in revelation 3 we find that the church eyes are being opened being body atonement and that is what closes her again we want to look at how we are to have the right spirit within us in this hour we can be obedient to the word of god because there is a great power that is released by god when a person comes in full obedience to the word of god in the message blind bartimaeus 1954-0402 1954.04202.0402 while she's finding that i want to move on it says but to continue in obedience to the word requires a spirit of obedience to first be in the person there must first be a spirit of obedience there is a spirit associated with obedience to god's word just as there is a spirit that causes a person to obey what the devil wants them to there is a spirit associated with disobedience just as there is a spirit associated with obedience either way depending on what spirit is in you you will be obedient to something eve obeyed the serpent because something that changed within her spirit you are going to listen to somebody people so often says well why do you listen why do you do everybody is listening to somebody it's just you have to be in tune with the right voice but what's the right voice that's the question to be obedient with the wrong voice in this hour will cause you some trouble but you must be in obedience to the voice of god to the word of god there is your absolute god's word let me continue i'm not going to be before you much longer where when in ephesians 2 2 says wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince and the powers of the air the first the i'm sorry according to the prince of power the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience see the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience there is where the spirit in the people that cause them to be disobedient to god's word and so there must be a spirit in this hour in the believer that causes him or her to come back into the obedience of the word again if this same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwells in you it will quicken your mortal bodies as enoch walked with god in fellowship with god he was changed there was a change going taking place as he was walking in the right spirit as he was walking in obedience to god and he was he received a body change he was no more so today as we're walking in the reveal light of the gospel of this time of this age amen we're being changed amen as we as we fellowship with god as we fellowship amen the word of god is returning us back into a complete [Music] fellowship so that we are literally being changed amen as the word of god amen is changing us as we walk in complete fellowship with god it's not going to just happen all of a sudden because you want it to there must be a sacrifice there must be a dying out there must be a calvary there must be a a calvary of your old denominational thinking there must be a calvary amen of your own will not my will lord but thy will be done there must be a dying out to your own intellectual thinking amen and you must submit yourself amen to the holy spirit to lead you and guide you into all truth there is where the change is going to take place in this hour it takes an eagle anointing not a man anointing not an oxidanting not a lion anointing it's going to take an eagle anointing a prophetic anointing to produce the faith that it's going to take in this hour but we see in contrast everything that god is doing everything that he's promised in this hour there at this time an invasion from the bottomless pit these demon powers that is coming against the bride where everything is saying that she should be gathering together around the caucus gathering together in worship around the world coming together in fellowship with one another and in a perfect union without god we see that these demon powers are dividing tearing down everything that he's doing but joe said he said i will restore i will restore i want to read this last in closing i won't be able to get through this not even close i'm sorry it's first samuel 15 17 chapter i'm sorry let me do this first romans romans 5 19 then after that go to first samuel 15. start at the 17th verse romans 5 19 says for as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous look at how powerful obedience to the word of god is also look at how powerful disobedience can be by one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by obedience of one shall many be made righteous obedience to the word what did the serpent offer creed dogmas it it it offered good things it it it offered soup supples and women's day men's day family and friends no i got no problem with all of these things if you're coming together around the revealed truth but what happened is we had to come up with all of these gimmicks and different things because the world don't excite the people no more just the word of god don't excite the people don't know why don't the word tell why the word don't excite the people no more because it's not an eagle anointing where the caucus is the eagles will be gathered together now i'm not saying that you don't feel rain like i said before they off we all the the the the weed the wheat everything feels the rain but there has to be a prophetic anointing for you to be able to see your eye of understanding is open that will literally give you a faith for what is taking place in this album samuel the first 15th chapter samuel said when thou was a little in thine own sight was thou not made the head of the tribes of israel and the lord anointed the king over israel and the lord sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they were until they be consumed before then did its thou not wherefore then did it thou not obey the voice of the lord but did his fly upon the spoils and did its evil in the sight of the lord and saul said to samuel yea i have obeyed the voice of the lord and have gone the way which the lord has sent me and have brought a guy the king of a malachi and have utterly destroyed the amalekites but the people took of the spoils sheep oxen the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the lord thy god in gilgal and samuel said hath the lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord the lord has great delight in a burnt offering and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold it is better to obey is better than a sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the lord he has also rejected thee from being king amen and you know we are considered as kings and priests and saul said unto samuel i have sinned for i have transgressed the commandment of the lord and thy words because i feared the people and obeyed their voice and disobeyed the voice of god last quote in closing go to the token 1963 0901 no 901 uh paragraph 338 then i want you to go to the token again preached in 1964 or 0208 you see when you choose to obey the word of god when you choose to obey the word of god then that is what brings the spirit of the word into you when you choose to obey the word of god that is what brings the spirit of the word into you and then that causes you to continue in obedience the token preached 1963 september first the token is the sign that the purchase has been made and been accepted it the purchase have been made and accepted now you can't get the token from the railroad fare until you pay the price now the price has been paid for us and the only way you're going to pay the price is paid amen that's right he says believe it accept it full obedience to the word of god will entitle you to the token full obedience not part as it at not part of it as far as your denomination goes but all of it full obedience to the word which is christ which is christ brings you into christ full obedience to the word of god will entitle you to the token not part not your denomination as far as your denomination goes full obedience to the word which is christ brings you into christ amen the token preached again in 1964 february 8th on this wise full obedience to the word brings god the word eternal in you and that is the token when the word is in you it's christ in you full obedience amen to the word is christ in you amen i have a few more here but i'm not going to go in go on any further amen our time has gotten away from us amen so we see in closing that amen we we we we're trying to show you that the obedience to the word in this hour amen is the very thing amen that's going to bring revelation 3 18 into manifestation to anoint thine eyes with isil talking earlier about those 10 virgins they go out to meet the bridegroom what is this this is the rapture so five have their their lamps and their lamps are lit because they have oil in their lamps amen they they had enough oil in their lamps for the journey the other five there they had no more oil so they stumbled in the darkness so they went to the other five amen to ask for oily say go to them that sell so who they have to go to amen revelation 3 i counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire see they had to go back to him to get the oil i counsel thee to buy of me amen so we see that that that they're that they're in and closing out and i'm pretty close for real on this time getting ready to close there were three exodus there's an exodus there in the in in in in in moses day that called them out a man of of bondage there was a they they was they was in bondage there and and and and and an angel amen an angel came to moses and sent him a man to to to to bring lead the people out of bondage amen to lead them out of bondage and bring them to a place that that was prepared just for them amen and there was a mixed multitude that came out everybody wasn't obedient everybody didn't hearken into the voice of the messenger that the angel sent to bring them out of bondage and what happened they died in the wilderness the second exodus in this day amen that this very message this eagle anointing is what to resurrect you to bring you out of bondage once again you're in a bondage of old denominational idealism amen where you you you you're in bondage of of of false thinking just like false false thinking and disobedience to the word of god the uh eve a broke fellowship amen so to be uh uh to break break fellowship is to be in the bondage by another spirit so this and this hour this second exodus amen by a prophetic anointing is to anoint your eyes what i say amen to see to bring you out of the out of bondage of old denominational thinking into a land amen which he has prepared for you which is the baptism holy holy ghost amen that will raise you up amen and elevate your thinking to prepare you for a rapture and the third exodus is that when you are changed out of this old pest house a flesh into a new body amen out of the bondage of this body amen that that is going to go back to the dust of the earth this body that gets sick this body that feels tiredness this body that feels pain this body that feels depression this body that feels all of those kinds of things amen into a new body amen into a new body that he has prepared for you remember i said a body god has prepared for you amen a perfect body but in order to come into a perfect body you must receive a perfect thinking a perfect revelation amen a new way of thinking and what does that what did it back then the angel sent the messenger to the children of israel to lead them out a prophetic anointing led them to the promised land and today it's the same thing amen may the lord add a blessing to his word amen um maybe i'll get a chance to expound on this a little further another time amen i trust that you were enlightened amen by
