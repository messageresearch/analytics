TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so that's that's why the scripture actually say you have a name that you live but you're dead they organized just like the other churches and as soon as the church organizers they leave God out they leave God out and and man takes complete control but God's nowhere in the picture and brother Branham toes once organization sets in that's been deaths that's in I've seen that not only and denominational churches but even in the message where people try to organize things you might have maybe only certain preachers preach all the time that's the denomination right that's the spirit of denomination when people begin to do things like that and you know you just got to be ever so careful when you see that you know when you see that spirit rising up but what we've watched that over the years on a certain preachers you want Santa wait other people say you need to say it you weren't going to be involved and that was a denominational spirit and when when the leader passes away the denomination falls apart right and that's what you've seen in the message over the past few years so god help us to avoid that a man's avoid that completely okay just bring him back out to you this is what we call the labyrinth that that was generated from this age so like I said there's some good things that happen they broke free from Catholic teachings but when they broke free they started all of this and pretty much everything you see here is just German American churches which is more Lutheran type churches this that's that's not representing 45,000 that other denominations that are out there but you can see Church Christendom became a labyrinth became a big maze people trying to sort through to figure out what's right you know what's wrong who got the right teachers and who got the you know just people just confused as to which way to go but the only thing we can say that's right is the Bible that's what's right and that's where we're trying to get people back to his back to the Bible and that's what brother Brandon mission was to do turn our hearts back to the Bible back to the Bible so this labyrinth we thank God that he has brought us through like the at the top of that slide says there's there's only one life but death comes to us and a thousand forms there's only one Christ but a thousand Antichrist so we want to follow the one Christ a man that's what we want to follow and we'll find him and his word okay we hit this last week and we'll just touch this real again real quick again we're revelation 35 which will spend a little bit more time in tonight says he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I would not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and his oly angels now again I want to underline the section which says the same shall be clothed in white raiment and what brother branham said there was a statement that came forth from that scripture and that section of the scripture says the same should be clothed in white raiment he says the statement was keeping skirts clean that was a statement that was made just people used that over the years keep your skirts clean and what that meant was too it meant don't get involved in questionable things don't don't get involved and questionable things I remember a statement that the Prophet said if you if you if you got a decision that you got to make interview if you got questions about that decision don't do it you don't do it if you got any little question about if you're not clearing your heart about whether do that and not do that the best thing to do is don't do it right but but anything that's questionable don't don't get involved and I love the way you put this others will be involved and you might be tempted to be involved because others are doing it and I mentioned this last week I want to say it again do not measure your Christianity by what somebody else is doing measure your Christianity by what the Word of God tells you to do and not not not Lord they doing it now God and accept it not an act right it's going to be based on his word so you know if other people get involved let them do it right but but I mean me I got my own convictions and i'ma stay with what God reveals to me right but but don't get involved in questionable things others will be involved you might be tempted to be involved or someone might even try to involve you but stay clear at all by steering a course away from it and I tell you what that quote could probably circle a lot of things in our Christian experience as what stuff we shouldn't be involved with what stuff we should be involved with but just remember keep your skirt clean you know you as an individual keep your skirt clean nobody like to walk around with stains on their clothes nobody amen so keep your your skirt clean that's that's the key thing you want to get from that scripture where it says the same shall be clothed in white raiment all right on a little further here we want to we talked about this last week but I want to go a little little deeper in this where it says also in Revelation 35 it says I will not blot out his name out of the book of life that's found in this section so brother Brandon begins to talk a little bit more about the book of life Lamb's Book of Life beginni clarify for us last week that is the same but the other thing I want to bring into here is when we're talking about this it says the possibility of the removal of a name for the records the record of God deserves more than a casual study for up until now most students have merely drawn a conclusion that got places the names of those born again within the Lamb's Book of Life at the time of the rebirth there was a song we used to sing when we were in church man that we used to turn up just about every Sunday we were Baptist Church sign me up for the Christian Jubilee write my name on the roll I haven't changed this the Lord lifted me yeah something like that and I want to be ready when Jesus comes but my wee boy every time the offering bachelor come around they'd assign me up you know is what we had the church rocking but when you think about it but that song was completely wrong when you get saved is not when your name is being signed an opponent will let me let me tell you my god even for you to just be introduced to this message your name had to be there now now there are some people that's been introduced to this message but have rejected it and their names will be erased we're going to get into that tonight right Judas was Judas was in the message for his day when he was standing right there with Jesus Christ working signs wonders and miracles but Judas got to a point in his life where he rejected that word and his name was blotted out right so we brought that out last week and we're going to go a little deeper because brother Brandon brought some more things and you know it is this is a very serious subject to me it's because I look at the people that are rejecting the word today or trying to reject or they don't know what they plan whipped right you know if you add to the word of take away from the word that your name would be blotted out that's revelation 22 right if you add to this were to take away now if you take it and how you have we take away from the word when we deny that God sent a prophet we take away and we was walking in that fellowship and around it one day shouting around it and didn't get to Fort online don't oh god help us I'm going to tell you when it went when you when you get to to Revelation it causes a burden becoming your heart where you can't help but pray for people right when Abraham knew destruction was on the way to Sodom Gomorrah Abraham began to pray right that that was that was his response it was there was I mean he wasn't rejoicing and jumping and saying that man that man began to seek God / adventure / adventure and when you when you get a true revolution what you know what we're kind of going through here tonight it ought to be / aventure / adventure / adventure my God my God Church so you know this is a this is this is serious this is serious information that God has given us you know very serious it's almost best that you didn't know it then actually notice and don't do nothing with it it was better that you just never heard it one of the worst things you can do is and you know and I think all of us probably we're all in some way we've probably experienced this here you got this truth and you notice truth and you trying to live in the world but this truth just keep hitting yet it everywhere you go it just hit you right you can't even live comfortably you know it whether it whether it hit you and somebody said something and it hit you or just running into the Saints it hits you right this truth just got away of just ooh it dig and dig in deep it's almost better that you just didn't know because other people that ain't got no problem they like well why are you feeling waving because you don't know what I know alright god I'll tell you this is this is I think got that he called us to it that's that's all I can say listen the possibility of the removal of a name from the records of God deserves more than a casual study and that's we're going to take our time and go through this says for up until now most students have merely drawn a conclusion it got places the names of those born again within the Lamb's Book of Life at the time of their rebirth and if any reason that man must be removed the space on the record will simply be a blank as it was before name have been placed there this is one hundred percent opposite to what the word actually teaches so if your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life it was placed here before the foundation of the world amen and we thank God for that that's the good part about it because if it's there can't be lost no matter what you go through in life you cannot be lost what a beautiful revelation right to know that you belong to him and there's nothing against you if his blood wipes it clean my delicate hold nothing nothing on if our name was there it was there and it was dead before was even born e before any mistake the name was placed in thank God for that thank God for had all right here's some key statements of scriptures that came out of our reading this week and one of them descriptors deuteronomy 29 18 where it says left there should be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord our God we're going to read more on that scripture but basically if you skip you know get down to a few verses after that it says that if there's tribes would turn away you know from following the Word of God then that tribe if they turn towards idolatry then that tribe what that entire tribe would be blotted out right they were blotted out from under heaven is what the scriptures say that we want to we want to take our time and help you know try to help people understand what that really means i will read will read through it a little bit but but that was a key statement deuteronomy 29 18 also he says the tribe that turned out dollar tree was to have his name blotted out that was a key statement he also said you can't go along with just part of the word you have to take all the word glory now that's a that's a good one you cannot just to go at part of the word just the part that make you happy and a part that make you shout you got to eat the whole roll a man you came just half part of it you got that you got to take all of it listen Jesus did not die a partial death he went he went through the whole thing and he had purpose for doing that all right listen to this this is another says that great God who is bringing Israel back to Palestine knows exactly which tribe every true Israelite us from and from all the assembled 144,000 Dan and Ephraim will be missing and we're going to get into wise Dan and ate from missing you know from 144,000 when they were part of the original tribes that were that were going out of Egypt and into the Promised Land why they miss him over the book of Revelation we'll get him to that here's the other thing revelation 22 22 19 which says if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book brother Branham tells us that when Judas left and betray the Lord his name was removed from the book of life and the other thing that he did it went in our reading he told us that there are multitudes of people doing the exact same thing today I want to just forewarn you most of the people that are defecting from the message most of it is over money and money money's been behind a lot of that and thus the sad part is that the people that don't know that they just kind of get swept up underneath the spirit but don't realize that there was there was money there was various there was Lenny that was controlling that's causing people to do what they did right had no idea that that and let me you know why Judas left Jesus money a Judas Judas wanted to get paid right and and and if Judas would do that if Judas would forsake the word in his day because of money many people do the same thing today but a lot a lot of folk just don't know the real details behind it and it just gets swept we're just going a website just read a lot of nonsense right and not even going through their own Bibles that really sort through this you know cuz I'm gonna tell you if you want to find something wrong you'll find it you're fine it's there to be found if you if you want to be anointed by the devil to find wrong you'll find it no matter whether you're looking for it in the message if you want to find in the Bible you'll find some things that come for dick in the Bible it's there if you're a Bible reader you know it's there all right but but the thing it don't for me it don't shake me right I'm not putting the Bible down I'm fine I find nothing nothing else like it you know and I'm not looking for anything else right so you know but if you're looking for wrong you'll find it if that's what your spirit is annoying it for you're going to find it and you'll be operating and not even knowing that the reason that it even started the reason that that thing even triggers because somebody it was all about money for them all about money somebody wasn't going to give them no more money if they didn't come out and say that they denounced the message my all right that's why you can't have relationships like that glory to God all right he also said this Judas fail and multitudes fell right there and when they fail to go on and that word their names are taken off the book of life that was a very very strong statement when people fail to go on in the word their names are taken off of the book of life write their names are taken off if you fail to go on and the word it got revealed this to you and then you just kind of reject it don't want it you know just kind of throw it right back in God's face oh that's like crucifying Jesus all over again I mean my you look at him on that crossing and all the pain everything he daughter Jess to you and like you know I'm doing this so that you don't you don't have to die for your sin but i don't care i'm a die for my scene anyway what how could we how could we respond that way to someone that would show us that type of love the first thing we ought to do like man if you would give all your heart for me I can't help but give all my heart for you that's what God wants all right last week we hit this and I'm going we're going to go a little further again this is not when we talk about this book of life your name was put there before the foundation of the world it's not being added right now for the brand instead in the church age but let it let it be known that there's not one scripture that teaches that God is presently compiling a record of names this was all done before the foundation of the world and when we look at the last book of life also called the book of life the first we're going to find like I said there's three groups but that would have been on the book of life and then there's one group that never even never their names was never even there so we're going to be going through over the next couple of weeks you know talking about the names that were on the record before the foundation world and no matter what oh caps our names were on that record before the foundation world and they will have their names remove so Judas would have been one of those people that had his name on the book but had her lube now we went through a scripture mount and we we we pointed out where Jesus over in Luke chapter 10 the total disciples don't rejoice because the Devils are subject unto you you say rejoice because your name is written in heaven right and when he said that Judas was standing right there as one of the disciples where he told him your name was written in heaven so Judas name was on that book of life but his name was removed when Satan entered into him and he did what he did when he sold out Jesus that's where his name was removed my the other other big thing I'll tell you that what Satan really annoys people with is the spirit of rebellion and rebellion is something that comes in so many forms people repel against their parents people rebelled against the pass two people rebelled against you know they rebelled against a deacon in the church there I mean and it's sometimes it's just any anybody and authority they rebelled against teachers administrators they were just rebelled against anybody right they were rebelling against the government you know it's Jeff it's just rebellion is all over the place and that is a spirit that's in my land the day the Bible say rebellion is that the same as the sin of witchcraft that's where we got to be careful don't let the devil anoint you with that don't let the devil anoint you with that fight rabay with everything you got just the Riddler to God surrendered a whole situation to God don't don't just don't cuz we're begging to take you further than you ever want to go alright so there's the names that were on the record before the foundation world and they will have their names removed Judas it's one of those we're going to talk about some others tonight another statement when we talk about the sections of the book of life there's names that cannot be removed under any circumstances and I am by faith declaring that everybody within the sound of my voice is in that section that name that cannot be removed under any circumstances no matter what I do my name can't be taken out now I'm going to tell you when you when you have a revelation of that you don't want to sin see it's not it's not what no matter what I do I ain't goin on oh you mean he loved me that much that he put my name man no matter what I did he I can't help but there was a brother branham told a story of them the husband that got married and he was a man of the world didn't know too much about the things of God and when they got married his wife had been a woman of a Christian for a number of years and she told them she said you know I've didn't walk in in this way for quite some time I've been I've been a Christian for a number of years and Sam know that you just getting to become a Christian you're just accepting Christ and you know you're going to go through some trials you go and go through some tribulations and you know things don't get a little difficult sometimes here and there just saying if you if you ever slip up you know and something go wrong you know when you your way from home something wrong she said whatever you do don't stay away from the house you come right on back home no matter what you do I want you to always come back home and that man looked at his wife he went to work and told his friend what his wife said he said now with a woman talking like that to me how can I do anything to hurt her right see I'm going to tell you there some people look for escape clauses they want to frustrate God's grace but there's others that actually appreciate his grace and like Lord of you can give me grace like that I can't help but serve you a man no matter what the circumstance there's a group of people their names will never be removed from that Lamb's Book of Life thank God for that brother branham also gonna bring to our attention look at this multitudes who were not even born again we'll go into you're going to eternal life not even be the bride not as a difficult one but we're gonna dig in there and we don't get it right multitudes going to receive eternal life and they were not even a bride now I didn't say they'll make the rapture but they're get eternal life right it didn't say that they live in the palace but they'll give eternal life right and actually the scripture exitos that God remembers people that just give you a cold glass of water God remembers them a man will get him taller that I tell you I look forward to this is this is good and also this this group is not in the book of life that's why I said I couldn't say four sections would be three sections but there's another group that we need to identify there's a group their names were never on the book of life never never there never and we'll we'll start talking about some of them as well as we go forward so try to keep that in mind the section that we are focusing on for tonight is the names that were on the record before the foundation world but their names were removed their names were removed all right we're starting with this tribal idolatry and it says that the names will be blotted out from under heaven brother Branham brought to our attention here Genesis 35 verse 23 through 26 he there is these are the twelve tribes as it was in Genesis as it was in Genesis we had Reuben we had Simeon we had leave on Judah Issachar Zebulon joseph benjamin dan Naphtali GAD and Asher now that's where it started out in Genesis if we moved over to numbers chapter 10 where the children of Israel you know kind of recording when they're coming out of Egypt brother branham makes this statement thus when Israel left Egypt and God gave them the tabernacle on the witness we wilderness in the wilderness we find the tribe of Levi ministering to the twelve twelve tribes named Reuben Simeon it's a car Judah zebulon Benjamin Dan Naphtali GAD Asher Ephraim and Manasseh now here that was that would be again found in the Book of Numbers Levi is ministering to this to this group now there was a statement that brother Branham made and I just want to kind of bring this for it don't worry about pulling this up on the screen will leave the screen as it is but in your church age book on page 269 brother Branham said he said these twelve sons descendants become the twelve tribes of Israel with the exception that Joseph did not have a tribe named after him but in the Providence of God there were to be 13 tribes and josephs two sons were given the honor bringing the twelve to thirteen you know of course that that this was necessary to leave I was separating to God for the priesthood so Levi to the other 12 and what we got there if there was a scripture that I wanted to just kind of bring in to you really quick yeah Genesis 48 and five Genesis 48 and five when this is when Joseph got reconnected with his family all know the story of him being sold into slavery and so on and so forth and down in Egypt but when he was when he finally met his father he brought his father down to Egypt and finally met his father his father action to bring his two sons and he's and he says Jacob actually tells him it says now that two sons Ephraim and Manasseh which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt our mind and Reuben and Simeon as Reuben and Simeon they shall be mine so here Jacob is actually adopted taking these two two sons of Joseph and making them his so that's why we see their names actually also going to be a part of the twelve tribes because Jacob took them as his own on boys okay so so when we read there if we were to go back and read their out of Numbers chapter tim brother branham already kind of you know summarizes it for said at the bottom of the screen since that's when Israel left Egypt and God gave them the Tabernacle in the wilderness we find the tribe of Levi was ministering to twelve tribes named Reuben Simeon it's a car Judah zebulon Benjamin Dan Naphtali GAD Asher Ephraim and Manasseh Ephraim and NASA happened to be Joseph sons okay so these were the twelve tribes as they were leaving Egypt going to the promised land now when we pick them up these twelve tribes over in the book of Revelation we got different names okay and when we get here to over the book of Revelation we got Judah we got Reuben we got gap we got a sure we got enough tally we got Manasseh we got Simeon we got Levi we got it's a car we got zebulon Joseph and Benjamin all right now I highlighted leave I'm and Joseph because when I when I share with you all over in numbers 10 Levi was serving the other tribes right and Joseph his name was not there because his two sons actually took his place ok but now over the book revelation receive Joseph's name has been added and Levi's name has also been added back in the book of Revelation now what happens in Revelation during the Tribulation Period just 144 thousand that God is going to deal with its 12,000 out of each one of these tribes that we have listed there from Judah Reuben GAD Asher Neftali Manasseh Simeon Levi instacart zebulon joseph benjamin well what happened is that we missed dan and we miss Aoife dan which you can see right here I'm sorry to give you that but dan is missing over here in this section dan is missing and then also this was now here Ephraim that was substituted and numbers ten Ephraim that's what Joseph sons Ephraim and Dan and no longer showing up over here in Revelation now this is important the reason that is important God made a promise of his word and we're going to read that scripture promise here in a second actual read it right now there's a reason why they're missing this is the reason the Bible says here in Deuteronomy chapter 29 verse 16 says for you for you know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt and how we came through the nations which you passed by and he have seen their abominations and their idols wood and stone silver and gold which were among them let's there should be less there should be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord our God to go and serve the gods of these nations let's there should be among you a route that birth gall and wormwood and it come to pass when he here at the words of this curse that he bless himself in his heart saying I shall have peace though I walk and the imagination of my heart to add drunkenness to thirst the Lord will not spare him but then the anger of the lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written in this book shall I upon him and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven alright so if they turn into idolatry if a tribe went towards idolatry then God was going to block their name out from under heaven so what I'm trying to what I'm trying to show you that if I can go back yeah when God made this promise in Deuteronomy and we never show in the scripture out of first King's and also out of other book of Isaiah where Dan turned to idolatry and Ephraim also went to idolatry and because they went to idolatry god remember what he said way back and Deuteronomy and it showed up in the book of Revelation the promise that God said if thats right turn the idolatry then that would be blotted out from under heaven so what that meant is that when these trials are dealt with in the tribulation dan will not be a part of the 144,000 and Ephraim will not be a part of that because that would break God's Word here Deuteronomy 29 God left them out over here because we remember what they did when they and I'm going to read the scripture you remember what they did when they went after false gods they went into idolatry I'm gonna tell you something if God remember his promise on something negative he certainly remembers it on something positive all you got to do is hold to it God did not forget what he said let's go back let's go Andrea turn with bring your bibles first Kings chapter 12 we're talking about names being blotted out Judas was one that was blotted out now we're picking up some other examples in scriptures in Scripture of others that have been blotted out the God said he would block the name out from under heaven that's what exactly what he did here in first Kings chapter 12 verse 25 now just so that you understand what happened here in this particular passage of Scripture Solomon King David had a son and Solomon who reigned in his stead when turned David pass Solomon because he began to serve Idol gods he got married to the wrong women and those women pulled his heart from God and he ended up serving their Idol gods that's why you got to be careful who you marry praise the Lord you just can't get connected with anything it's so important you believe this message you find somebody else that believe this message don't you be out there fooling around with somebody don't know this message that that would set you up for a lifetime of heart ache and right now I see my oh it's just so beautiful I don't just you you keep playing that devil and you watch what your life turned out to be don't play games don't thank you smarter than a devil even using these tricks for years and and you know what you want to know why the devil use the same trick over and over generation after generation because it works that's why he uses he ain't got to change it it works and i haven't seen people my generation thought they were smarter than the devil now i'm watching another generation come up they think they smarter to the devil you're not it's the best that your best fortification to stay behind this word and get the Holy Ghost all right but outside of that the devil got you on the owner you just wait you just wait oh that's all you got to do look you know that's why when the truth were going to different countries and God were giving the land he tell them destroy the babies kill the babies killed the babies now most people say why would God cute little innocent babies you know why cause I'm David's gonna grow up one day and one letter gonna ax what happened to their mom and daddy and when they found out you killed a mom and daddy what you thinking a little baby don't want to do to you you better kill the baby it looked things your life little baby things right man you better kill them because if you don't kill it is going to kill you I'm just church i'm telling you look at this because so what happened redbone a Solomon because he because he went out to these I ragazze God told him say I'm going to split the kingdom I'm a split the kingdom and i'ma give ten tribes to one leader and then i'ma give another two tribes to another leader and and at this time Raya bone actually became the leader of a couple of the tribes and then Jeroboam was given ten other tribes right so Jeroboam was it was a prophecy that he was going to lead to lead the children of Israel God had given them ten tribes prophet came to him told me exactly what was going to happen here God has already manifested it and Jeroboam does something that he should not have done verse 25 says then Jeroboam bill Shechem and mount ephraim Ephraim Ephraim right and dwelt therein and went out from dense and built a pinwheel and Jeroboam said in his heart now shall the kingdom return to the house but David now what he was afraid of is that as as he built these the you know different places in these when it when it's time for the people to go to worship oh my help us Lord right here so when it's time for the people to go to worship he was afraid that when they went back into Jerusalem or something like that the worship that their hearts would turn towards rainbow so what he did was actually build a tabernacle set of people did not have to Oh to talk to Jerusalem to worship now God have established certain places for the people to go worship even me Jeroboam building nothing else but Jeroboam did this because he was afraid that the people when they went to worship my when they went to worship he was afraid that he was going to lose the people that same spirit lives today that's why some people don't fellowship because when the church go to worship they afraid that they might lose some of the people so to actually keep the people away from the fellowship you got the oh my god you got to be confident in the God that is called you remember brother Anderson made a comment one time said of God told you to God called you to Pastor 500 you are not going to have 499 you like I have 501 you're gonna have 500 if God called you to pass 25 you're not gonna have Tim they're not gonna have 20 you're gonna have five you got to be confident what God called you to do but you got people now that but if they come up with all kind of things as why they can't they will not announce meetings amen they're not going to announce the meeting because they're afraid if they go so I oh lord have mercy I've seen people know that a meeting meeting been announced for months and then they set up their own meeting on the same weekend that keep day people waiting from that other meetings in the message that's that's that's way if God gave you God gave you and the other thing I found out my church is that every Church could have a group of people that's what you call the pillars the backbone no matter what happened nectars that group right there going nowhere every church got him I could I could tell you churches that we we grew up in you know Pentecost Baptists all that their families still hitting them churches that we was there that was there when we was there 35 40 years ago they still there they're not going nowhere and I've watched the churches through all kind of changes guess what their families are still right there every church got families like that every church got got a group like that and all you got and those ones that are called a bill that that community praise the Lord church as a pastor you you never thought you don't want to be like this don't be like this this this guy right here Jeroboam God God gave him them tribes he didn't have to do nothing to try to keep them people God gave him that but look at what he does verse 27 if this people go up to do sacrificing the house of the Lord at Jerusalem then she'll the heart of this people turn again unto their Lord even unto redbone king of Judah and they shall kill me and go again to rebel king of Judah so he's afraid look at what he does whereupon the king took counsel me two calves ago oh and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem but hold on God's Oh Israel which brought the up out of the land of Egypt and he set the one in Bethlem Bethel and the other put he in dan and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one even unto Dan so brother branham tells us here is that when they did that that's when their names were blotted out and that's why you don't the ones that went to Dan that's why I Dan right here is not over here in the book of Revelation during the Tribulation Period 144,000 12,000 out of each tribe dan is not represented because what just happened here in first Kings 12 that's why dan is not their God remember his word and even all the way over the book of Revelation let that promise was still in effect that's powerful to me if God remember what he said in first king I mean action Deuteronomy and saw the peg manifests in first Kings 12 he would not let dance now another other thing i want you i want to make it clear is that it's only under heaven under heaven but will read another scripture where when things go back into the millennium millennial reign when it gets back to their then all wrongs are made right and you'll see dan is back in at that point in time my god alright so let's another scripture here Hosea for and 17 wise a will see that he from is not there because of Hosea for and 17 oh my alright says this and Hosea for and 17 Ephraim is join the idols let him alone because II from winning ty dolla tree they also were their names were blocked out under heaven which mean that they would not be represented here in 144,000 leave on Joseph was substituted for Dan and Ephraim over here in 144,000 when Godzilla with the Jews again the the that that day I mentioned you all a few weeks ago how they're even right now in Israel there are families that have a table set and they have a chair sitting there at the table and while they're sitting there eating their meal I have a certain time of the mill the oldest boy of the family get up and go to the front door just open the front door and when he opens that door they are actually under expectation that he lied the Elijah will come and join them for meal this is happening right now in Israel been happening for years they're actually looking for their witnesses and if they are actually under expectation church we don't have much longer where God's going to stop dealing with the Gentiles and he's going to start dealing with these Jews right we don't have much longer so we got to get things right now get our skirts clean now right we don't have much longer other thing I want to since we there in the book of Hosea verse 6 it my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou has rejected knowledge i will also reject thee that thou shall be no more no no priest to me seeing that has forgotten the law of thy God I will also forget that children and here it is people are rejecting knowledge rejecting the Word of God that is happening in our day and when you reject it you'll be destroyed because of that right so be very very careful that's what God has given to us is special it's precious we ought to cherish it let's thank God for it alright let's go on a little further here let me see i think i have i got something that I want to read maybe we'll pull this up this is a pretty long quote here let me just see something I want to just trying to go back and show you yes under heaven under heaven according to Revelation 743 these are these tribes Dan and Ephraim were missing because of the idolatry they found themselves involved in so what we're seeing is their names were blotted out under heaven that's what the Bible actually told us see if I can just pull this up for you can I go to the next / Deuteronomy it told us that they would be blotted out I want to just remember I'm going to try to read a quote here for you and this is a if you could just fill up the quotes also on on slide 11 and your church age book if you would get to page 270 alright actually go back down that's where i'm going to start it in your church age book if you have it it would be a lot easier for you just follow me here in your church age but others you could just follow right on the screen this will be a lungful i'll read this and then we'll actually stop at this point tonight I do have a like I said there's I got a few more slides on this subject as far as people that would be blotted out their names were there but they were actually blotted out but I just want us to take up time to really get this the way that brother Branham just brought it to us so here the key thing that I wanted you to get is that it was under heaven according to Deuteronomy 29 verse 20 says the low but not stare him but then the anger of the lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written in this book sure lie upon him and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven from under heaven now let's pick this up page 2 71 right in the middle of the page is that right 270 yes yes the first paragraph where it says note particularly that the punishment for idolatry was that the name of that tribe was to be blotted out from under heaven Deuteronomy 2920 it does not say that it would be blotted out in heaven but from under heaven that's very key it wouldn't be blocked out in heaven but under heaven and that is exactly as as it is for now Israel is back in Palestine and soon the Lord will seal the 144,000 of them but from that number dan and Ephraim are missing and he's rereading here at the book of Revelation verse of chapter 7 verse 43 four through eight and I heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the children Israel of the tribe of Judah were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Reuben were still 12,000 of the tribe of gad we're still 12,000 of the tribe of Asher Asher were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of neft alum were still 12,000 of the tribe of manassas were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Simeon were sealed 12,000 the tribe of Levi was still 12,000 of the tribe of Issachar were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of zebulon were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Joseph was sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed 12,000 note Dan and Ephraim missing now you know the average person going through that particular scripture you just looks at the 12 tribes of Israel but the Prophet picked up no there was two things missing then he took his back in the scripture showed us why they were missing right very very important statements there it goes on said now with this see Daniel 12 1 which refers to these 144,000 being sealed during the sixth seal and the time of the Great Tribulation or Jacob's trouble and at the time and at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of that people and there should be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and that and and and at that time by people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book however after this period of tribulation during the Millennium as seen by Ezekiel in chapter 48 verse 1 through 8 and verse 22 to 29 we see the tribes back once more in divine order but from the time that Ephraim and Dan joined themselves to idols they died and those tribes have no more recognition now I realize that since the destruction of Jerusalem all records of all tribes have been lost so that no one can say for sure what tribe he is from but God knows that great guard who is bringing Israel back to Palestine knows exactly which tribe every true Israelite is from and from all the assembled 144,000 Dan and Ephraim will be missing now let me also inject because there's people that feel like there's this lost track and they feel like a lot of african-americans are part of the Lost Tribe of Israel that's not they not even reflected in the book of Revelation they're not there the Lost Tribe is not there right and like I try to tell you if I saw you I'd know where he was born I was there at your birth you came telling you from Israel you can't tell me that I'm not buying it right are you from pleasant City you're not from Israel right but you know it's just a lot of this stuff that people getting into we don't have to you know please talk just just a void that it's just it's a sad and I people surfing searching for knowledge and all they got to do is just follow profit they have everything they need it's right there thank God listen he goes on to bring out here in Ezekiel 48 verse 13 and verse 22 through 29 it says here the tribes of Israel so now these are the names of the tribes he's reading right out of the Bible now these are the names of the tribes from the north end to the coast of the way of Heflin and again what is telling us in Ezekiel this is after Tribulation Period descriptors represent the Millennium it's representing a millennium so they were blotted out under heaven but not blotted out in heaven all right so which meant that God was not going to deal with them when the word went back to the Jews those two tribes would not be dealt with during that time when the word went back to the Jews but it's not that God forgot about them two tribes it's just they would not be dealt with right so we want we just want to kind of catch that but it also shows that people can have their names blotted out you separate from the word your name can be blotted out it happened to two tribes it happened to Judas and we're going to find where it happened to some others as well so let's just go on and try to finish this tonight now these are the names i'm reading from ezekiel 48 verse 1 now these are the names of the tribes from the north end to the coast of the way of hell I'm as one gorph to Hamas has a rent in the board of Damascus north wit to the coast of Hamas for these are his his side's east and west a portion for Dan so you can see Dan's name is brought back in and by the border of dan from the east side I'm to the west side a portion for Asher and by the board of Asher for the east side and to the west side a portion for Neftali and by the board of natalia from the east side them to the west side I portion from the NASA and by the border of Manasseh from the east side into the west side of portion for Ephraim you can see Ephraim's name is brought back in all right and by the border of Ephraim from the east side and to the west side a portion for Ruben and by the board of Ruben from the east side into the west side of portion for Judah by the board of Judah from the asylum to the west side etc says moreover from the possession of the Levites and from possession of the city being in the midst of that which is the princes bench between the border of Judah and the board of Benjamin shall be for the prince as for the rest of the tribes from the east side them to the west side Benjamin shall have a portion and by the border of benjamin from the east side them to the west side Simeon shall have a portion and by the border of Simeon from the east side them to the west side it's a car a portion and by the Board of it's a car from the east side them to the west side zebulon a portion and by the border of zebulon from the east side and to the west side gad a portion and by the by the border of gap at the south side southward etc so he's bringing in you know those scriptures out of Ezekiel chapter 48 verse 13 and verse 23 through 29 showing how the tribes are back in perfect order at that time that was during the Millennium rain that they were back in perfect order but when it was time for them for God to deal with 144,000 those two tribes of missing because they went into idolatry I would not want to take a chance as a Gentile and I turned towards idolatry and have my name removed from this Lamb's Book of Life I also went on to sell Christ out for for money I wouldn't want to do that I won't want to take my chance there's others that with you know when we get to the section that will talk about others that will receive eternal life and they weren't even a part of the bride it's because they actually gave a cup of cold water there is people that if they heard that they'd probably be out trying to give a cup of cold water to everybody you don't know who brought her new not so it's not giving that cold water it's living right that's what it's all about you living for Jesus that's what you want to do right but uh but you know some people have a back-up plan i'm gonna give cold water to everybody because i don't know i don't know and that just in case just in case I miss it I want to make it now now trust me i think the people that's gonna make it as people that didn't even know they gave cold water somebody had no idea but but the lord will remind me you know you said when he said when matthew 25 when can i do this you know that what you've done it to the least of these my little when you did it up to me not even realize that you actually did something nice for somebody amen all right so much more to go into will cut off there tonight and we'll get started I will pick up that and go in a little deeper next time we get together let's pray father we thank you for this time will we get a chance to study your word and as your profit is bringing Lord the depth of God to us revelations when we talk about in the book of life now you can't just take a casual study and try to go through this but Lord just really going through the scripture and following it to seeing Lord all the all the little nuggets that are there we thank you for that we thinking that you would give us eyes to see and ears to hear and our prayer God is that as we hear these things that would just cause us all to fall more in love with you we trust father that you continue to be glorified and magnified in our hearts and in our lives some Jesus name we pray amen [Music]
