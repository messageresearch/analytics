always want to feel the anointing because it's the anointing that makes the difference a man in our circumstances and our situations I think to think we give the devil mind battles when we worship no matter what we're going through everything that the devil sends in your direction is his attempt to try to steal your praise Amen but I'm so glad we still got a praise on the inside it's a god man sloths I've been through the fire and the flood been broken in pieces left all alone but do it all God kept me man I thank God and I still got a praise on the inside of him and a man God is good appreciate you musicians a man and the The Specials I heard my daughter and a man and she pulled out her stringed instrument this morning and a man and he played us a song as something that was real good thank God for that him a man praise the Lord I heard sister Tina just singing man her testimony is so long and even entertaining noting that the devil trying to frame the Mia bye-bye sometime you gotta just tell the devil talk to the hand Oh God but I appreciate that and a man just just solder the Lord storm III promise you last week that I would to give you an update cuz I missed that last week and I hate to have to change the order of the service like this but I just quickly want to give you a building fund update and amen and then we'll go from there musicians thank you and then I'll let you have your seats at this time but we do want to thank the Lord for our our pledges the Lord is certainly blessing us a man the Lord is blessing us right now a man and last month a man this is for the month of August we received one thousand four hundred seventy-five dollars and seventy sent a man or last month and that brings our receive year-to-date Justin pledges to eighteen thousand nine hundred ninety nine dollars and 63 cents praise the Lord [Applause] our our goal for this year was 105,000 our pledges were fifty six thousand eight hundred nine than what we have received towards so splendors been eighteen thousand nine hundred ninety nine dollars and sixty three cent also we have been gaining interest on the money that has been pledged and thus far we've gained three hundred and sixty dollars and forty three senate interests it gives us a net of nineteen thousand three hundred sixty dollars and six cents for this year a man for this year [Applause] so i am so grateful the numbers are not negative they're always positive a man every month they are always positive they always going up they never going down and and and i'm just so grateful I'm thinking God in advance for the new church in the school that's that's what we're saving for we're believing got from the church in the school and a man and and and and I say all things are possible a man if we just believed so thank God for that god bless you can turn on the lights and a man I this morning on a why but for some reason the the sermon that I prepared wouldn't update on my my I got two tablets and it didn't update on on either of them and so I had to bring my laptop a man to preach from this morning so just bear with me a little bit larger than what I usually have up here but you know hopefully you still get the message a man and you know just some time the devil like to just throw a little wrenches and things and it's like you know what there's another way around that you just gotta look at the dough so you know this too shall pass it okay we'll go around that and we'll go you throw something else up we'll go around that too and a man if we have to push it or push it over you know what whatever tape right but but we just thank the Lord for all things thank God brother Martin from Boynton came to minister for us on Friday night and we had a wonderful time here a man him preaching I will restore saith the Lord and he made a real good emphasis on saith the Lord mean that God signed it and and and if God signs a promise you understand if if a king signs a decree there is nobody not even the king himself can change what he saw no circumstance can change him no situation can change it right and I mean when the king was feeling so sorry for Daniel he wanted to change it but he knew that the laws a man stated that once the King signed it they had to go through with it hallelujah I thank God for that right because if God said I will restore then I don't need I don't need nobody else to sing nothing [Music] I ain't looking at nothing I'm looking at the signature hey man when you argued certain things a man in court or whatever it is this your signature is this your signature did you sign for this if you sign for this yours right and so I know God signed it and it's my promise because he gave it to me and I'm just under expectation for him to bring it to pass but I will restore sayeth the Lord they made everybody ought to take that and run with that but man that is your promise don't let no situation change it don't let no devil change it nothing nothing nothing I will risk lost power restore your health I restore your finances I'll restore your family I will restore save the Lord he didn't put limits on nothing Oh glory to God Church I was blessed you know he said he just had that in his heart to bring to the church he'd been they've been telling me for some time that brother Jack I just got this sermon that Lord gave me and he's and he said the Lord told him don't go nowhere else to preach first you go to spirit and truth Tabernacle first and any and you know and some of you all were witnesses cuz it told you all the Lord gave me a message he'd been waiting about a good year I would say to deliver that's it that's a that's that's that's a good thing right you know I appreciate brothers that can just wait for the Lord to open up the doors for them right the man's gift maketh room for himself and bringing him before great men this is what the Bible said but he waited I want to say at least at least a year and and and and you know I thought the time was perfect because on Friday night amen my grandson came to church and you know just by God's predestinated plan my wife was watching him for Friday night Friday night so he spent a night Friday night and he come to church and and brother Martin preaches that and I say brother to be tonight because Elias was here right any lie is according to the scripture Elias shall come and restore some things come on I take the five wood epoxy Elijah shall come and restore all things so on the same night that Elias come that brother preached that I had a double confirmation glory to God I'm under expectation so y'all see me shout let's just get out just hold my Mueller let me shout hey man gonna take it where I got something to shout about me you know he's restoring right now [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I mean if you wait let's do something you actually miss them what are you doing I say he's doing it Manny Manny man yeah I just I believe that and I receive that and yeah I tell you you know we ought up we oughta just go ahead and start worshipping and praising him because there's so much happening there is so much happening amen amen amen and I want you to remember sometimes you look at troubles and trials that come into your life and you know this one said this this one said that this one doing this just when doing that remember those are not angry clouds a man but those are angels wings beating together right and the reason that you see it as angry clouds because you standing too far back you got to get closer to it to see that God is using this thing for his glory will you buck attack I say when you pluck it out is there something you can throw right on in the bucket amen all things are working together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose amen I just I praise them I know y'all got things to do and I'm gonna try to get on that child way but I just feel good I feel not only I feel good I feel God I feel God just just talking this morning and in Sunday school and and brother Branham was saying that at church age book he said how do we know that Jesus is in you know the bosom of the Father how do we know these things he said the reason that we know that is because he sent the Holy Ghost they say the Holy Ghost came that's how we know Jesus is with the father because the promise was that after he goes away he was sending the Holy Ghost and I actually the classes say now how you know the Holy Ghost came hey then how do you know the Holy Ghost came and and each one start gets kind of chiming in because it came in me say man that's good I say say I start thinking I started thinking about services like this the reason we know the Holy Ghost came because we got together to worship and there was a different atmosphere that was in the place that's how we know the Holy Ghost came and can I tell you something the Holy Ghost come we come to change he come to disrupt right he comes to make move he makes us start something fresh inside of you amen and and and the other thing I won't say when the Holy Ghost come what you're supposed to do is just worship come on somebody rather Simba said I see how you know the Holy Ghost came brother Simba say you know when brother brother whispers here he is preaching and we know the Holy Ghost came how y'all heard them but that real good because something got ahold of brother Garen on the corner over there hey some some revelation from heaven just went straight towards him you can't do nothing but something shouting Russian people that did not come here to give God a praise maybe they came because they mama made him come by they data made him come or just they're so out a little bit it meant to say that you came to church but when the Holy Ghost comes he wants to change your life we are the expectation for him to come again every time we gather in these dolls we're looking for the Holy Ghost to come please and you came to the wrong place if you if you came to the wrong place there's somebody creating the sphere place if you did want to be set free you came to the right place this is a place where the Holy Ghost will have recourse going to God and he will do the exceeding abundant above all we can ask or even thing [Applause] Oh God hey man hallelujah Church right all right I'm gonna try to get into this look thought today but let God have his way yeah I'm on the expectation I'm under expectation oh Jesus Jesus Jesus thank you Lord Jesus let me His Holy Name God have your way in this place yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord amen amen amen yes ain't nothing wrong with worship him hallelujah Church a few weeks ago we came in here to listen to a tape on a Friday night and there was an anointing in this place as brother Branham was preaching there was a real anointing that was released in this place and amen and I that anointing is still here I mean God want to do something for somebody hallelujah we're not coming to church out of tradition and then we come because we need something from God lord I need a change a man I need a change I need you to do something for me so Amen I pray this month at your gift that God has in store for you hallelujah glory to God glory to God thank you Lord Jesus [Music] hallelujah hallelujah amen he is here to meet your needs he's here to set captives free man Jesus Christ is here Oh glory to God thank you Lord Jesus glory amen praise is what I do we were talking a few weeks ago it's it's when we praise that the situation begin to change right when a by gee I believe his name was a bye-bye Joe day but they were surrounded by the enemy and and they just began to worship and to praise God and before you know it God had defeated the enemy on their behalf I'm talking about things you can't fix God can fix it and man God can do it God can take care of it glory to God amen but as you worship Him you actually give him permission you understand [Applause] as worse if you given him permission [Applause] already take control Oh glory to God [Applause] giving him permission you don't understand some y'all in that place right now oh my god is my worship and that's all I need is my worship my worship gives them permission to change my circumstance they may rather get this despondent and a made an upset about this and upset about that give God permission [Applause] and your worship is what you're doing before the manifestation as Christians we all wait until you see a manifestation a man to worship now [Applause] God's praises saying that it's color change your praise is not based on how you feel your praise is not based on what you think your brain says that God is gonna get involved in this [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] this is this place sir continually beware go to the next verse not my flesh but my soul some caboose in the Lord come on somebody please cut things change in her situation phase change in a

Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles verse seven says the angel of the Lord in Campus round about them that fear him and what does he do so so so many y'all just forget about it when you know when the angel comes he comes for deliverance brother Jack how can you say that because at a certain season and this is that certain season I'd assert they would be sitting at the Pool of Bethesda and at a certain scenes in the angel would come and he would get in the water come on somebody and the first person to jump into the water see when the angel [Applause] [Applause] [Applause]

in their spirit but you leave here delivered glory to God I'm telling you this anointing came a few weeks ago and all we've been doing is just a man just watering that anointing a man we've been anointing the anointing with our place you get what I'm saying with our place we have Norton via Norton it's already here and this morning when we hit that that that little statement from brother branham saying you know when Jesus went to the bosom of the Father how do we know because the Holy Ghost came and we just start talking about him i'ma tell you something if you will learn to just talk about the Lord his presence will draw near we talk too much about our problems we talk too much about our circumstance we talk too much about our sickness it's time to talk about the Lord let's talk about Jesus [Applause] the angel alert and careful round about him that fear him and when he come he delivers them so if you haven't done this I want to invite you to do the next verse [Music] there was a professor he stood before his his his his audience and it's a he said God is not real and they just start proving different things you know according to his research how God was just not real and it's if there's anybody in this auditorium that wants to you know stand up and say something against what I'm saying then raise your hand and nobody raised their hand but that day there was just

because you ain't tasted the Lord you don't know whether he real or not the Bible sale tasting chief not only that is real but taste and see that the Lord is the Lord is good so when I'm going through I rather go through with the Lord everybody going through something but you might as well go through with God taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him [Applause] [Music] [Applause] verse nine or fear the Lord ye who Saints for there is no want to them that fear him can I skip down to verse 15 now in all actuality this was a part of my sermon this was at the end of the sermon Michelle made me Pete reached the end God know what he doing here today God know what he doing here today yeah this is what this we in Florida and not now now now now now there's some people that don't understand this and they do crazy things when hurricanes and stuff come right but but the reason they do that is because when you know they know they'll never get a wave like that and and normal conditions we don't get waves like that so when things are stirred up people are willing to take a chance and this morning things are stirred up and some of y'all was willing to take a chance I'll taste and see that the Lord is good [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] let me let me also say something y'all just stay right where ya don't move don't move don't stir yet you all have to wait for God to do this for you to do that you can come to church like that every week and when you come to church like that then God gonna do something brings along a man Naomi got she got her praise and ecstasy ain't worry about whatever happened over here don't happen if I fall I fall but I'm a prison right now right and what you have is other folk that get concerned about I want to make sure that see you don't see don't fall but you know what happened that was just a invitation from God because when you got close to a man that's the way it's supposed to be let there think it contagious like like like a virus you know on the day of Pentecost they caught a virus a hundred and twenty of them came on sick in the spirit verse 15 the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open unto the Craig I hear what you're going through you know his very existence is because of you God exists because of you the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open until their cry look at this the face of the Lord is against them that do evil so you ain't got to fight your own battle you don't have to fight your own battle y'all know how y'all be fighting our battles some of the posts that y'all put out people can see you fight in the battle hey man you got I mean everybody know when you're going through watch your posts it say a lot about you we don't know who you're attacking but you attacking somebody your PO said it but what you got to learn to do it just let God fight your battle put something encourage it out there the face of Lord is against him that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth the righteous cry and the Lord heareth here's the second time David said it in this verse in this chapter deliver them from all out of all their troubles verse 18 the Lord is nigh he's close to you right now the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and save us such as be of a contrite spirit see sometimes the devil anoint you with a really bad anointing and your spirit can actually be against God and I was saying this early remember brother gene told us that you know specially if a family get into a little disagreement full Church the husband and wife and you know and they get into a little disagreement and and they wear that thing as they come into the house of the Lord they're just wearing it and and then they get and one of the one of the spouses just start worshipping and praising God and the other spouse is sitting there looking at you know what we just went through and you in here praising God like this you ain't nothing but a hypocrite so your spirit becoming contrite getting number two hypocrite and so so so so at the church they get into the car and they talk now you know what I just got something to say how could you praise God know what we just went through and I and now y'all know the story I'm gonna just say the other spouse i'ma say it like that the other spouse say well you know I know we went through but goddamn do nothin tell me and since God didn't do none to me I'm not gonna have what we call emotional leakage my emotions have leaked into my praise and my emotions have stopped my praise right I'm not gonna have a motional leakage praise God I don't mean that you don't go fix it but understand don't let the devil take your brace your praise that's what's gonna give you victory says the Lord is not unto them that of a broken heart and save it such as beat of a contrite spirit look at this Mimi I think somebody could see it Lord that's just father ask me go I hear you Jesus I hear you Jesus many some I say don't even start me to testify many are the afflictions oh wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute see if the afflictions are righteous if many of the fictions are for the righteous that means God did not forsake you when you start going through them that mean that means you didn't you didn't do nothing to get that kind of like Joe Jobe didn't do nothing wrong to get that trial it was just it was simply a suggestion it was a godly suggestion the trial that Joe had that almost took his life was a godly suggestion with stipulations so all you under right now is a godly suggestion with stipulations have you considered my servant joke now you can do this and you can do that but you can't take his life stipulations and I guarantee no matter what you do Joe will still love me send some friends by that don't don't mean no good you got all kind of negative things to say but jobs still gonna love me raise up his wife the closest thing to let us start talking a different talk Joe still gonna love me I wonder if anybody still love God no matter what you're going through the promise on this is many other afflictions of the righteous but you know what bud is right a conjunction and conjunctions change functions but the Lord delivereth him out of some of them the Lord delivered him out of them all he keepeth all his bones not one of them is broken evil shall slay the wicked and they that hate the righteous shall be blessed they die hating the righteous shall be desolate let God fight it the Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate God will make a way where there seems to be no way he opens doors we cannot see he will make a way for me he will beat my god drive me closely to his side through love and strength for each new day he will make a way oh my god my god my god Lord how we just love you Jesus how
