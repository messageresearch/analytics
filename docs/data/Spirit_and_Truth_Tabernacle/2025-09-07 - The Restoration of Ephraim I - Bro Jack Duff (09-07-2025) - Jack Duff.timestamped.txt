[37:46] we're going to read from it anyway.
[37:48] Hosea
[37:49] Hosea
[37:51] uh chapter 14. I'm going to need just
[37:53] the Lord the monitors for me. Um thank
[37:57] you just a little bit. Hosea uh chapter
[38:00] 14. Um, and I do have this uh on the

[38:17] should be an email and um if she should
[38:22] have the PowerPoint that I sent and
[38:25] everything is there in the PowerPoint.
[38:27] Praise the Lord. Uh let's read from
[38:29] Hosea chapter 14. Um
[38:35] it um
[38:38] says this in verse one.
[38:41] Uh oh Israel,
[38:43] return unto the Lord thy God, for thou
[38:46] hast fallen
[38:48] by thine iniquity.
[38:51] uh take with you words and turn to the
[38:54] Lord, say unto him, take away all
[38:57] iniquity,
[38:59] and receive us graciously, so will we
[39:02] render the cows uh of our lips.
[39:07] Asher shall not save us.
[39:10] Uh we will not ride upon horses. Neither
[39:13] will we say uh anymore to the work of
[39:17] our hands. Ye are our gods.
[39:22] Uh for
[39:24] in thee the fatherless find findeth
[39:28] mercy.
[39:30] I will heal their backsliding.
[39:33] Uh, I will love them freely, for my
[39:37] anger is turned away
[39:40] from him. I will be as the dew unto
[39:44] Israel. He shall grow as the lily and
[39:48] cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
[39:51] His branches shall spread and his beauty
[39:56] shall be as the olive tree and his smell
[40:00] as Lebanon.
[40:02] Uh they that dwell under his shadow
[40:05] shall return. They shall
[40:08] uh revive as the corn and grow as the
[40:12] vine. The scent thereof shall be as the
[40:15] wine
[40:17] of Lebanon.
[40:20] Ephraim shall say, "What have I to do
[40:23] anymore idols? I have heard him and
[40:28] observed him. I am like a green fur
[40:31] tree. From me is thy fruit found. Uh who
[40:35] is wise and he shall understand these
[40:38] things prudent and he shall know them.
[40:42] For the ways of the Lord are right
[40:46] and the just shall walk in them but the
[40:49] transgress transgressors shall fall
[40:52] therein. Amen. The Lord had a blessing
[40:56] to the reading of his word. You can be
[40:58] seated. Praise the Lord.
[41:02] Um,
[41:05] let me just get myself together here.
[41:12] We uh have a
[41:16] title uh for today
[41:19] and uh the title is the restoration of
[41:22] Ephraim.
[41:24] Amen. the restoration
[41:26] of Ephraim. And my inspiration, I was
[41:30] kind of um as I was debating on what
[41:33] what to title this um I I actually
[41:36] started off with the restoration of
[41:38] Ephraim. Then I went to what have I to
[41:40] do anymore with idols and then um I just
[41:44] settled back on the title be restoration
[41:46] of of Ephraim. But the inspiration will
[41:48] be what have I to do anymore with idols?
[41:54] Praise God. Amen. And we pull that right
[41:58] out of the scripture in Hosea 14:8. Uh
[42:01] the scripture says, "Ephraim shall say,
[42:02] "What have I to do anymore with idols? I
[42:06] have heard him and observed him. I am
[42:08] like a green fur tree. From me is thy
[42:11] fruit f fruit found." Um it's just
[42:15] amazing how the Lord uh just does
[42:17] things. I have uh read through the Bible
[42:21] many a times and uh you know and on the
[42:26] journey this year of reading through the
[42:27] Bible uh once again and uh as I was
[42:32] reading I ran into the scripture and I
[42:34] saw something there that I don't think
[42:36] I've seen um before uh with with Ephraim
[42:41] this being the last chapter of the book
[42:43] of Hosea and uh and Ephraim has
[42:46] separated from the idols The other thing
[42:48] that we found here is that uh we read
[42:52] there in scripture where God said, "I'm
[42:53] going to heal their backsliding." Amen.
[42:56] I'm I'm I I'm going to do this. And and
[42:58] and what I see here, if God is healing
[43:01] the backsliding, then God is blinging
[43:04] bringing a work of restoration
[43:07] uh to Ephraim. Amen. And and as we go
[43:11] through this journey uh here we'll see
[43:14] Ephraim got involved in a lot of uh
[43:18] sinful things uh the book of Hosea
[43:21] speaks a but much of this Ephraim got
[43:24] away from God you know and uh the other
[43:27] thing is that we have to as we navigate
[43:30] this we have to see that this is not
[43:32] just talking about uh Israel or this
[43:35] tribe of Israel the tribe of Ephraim. Uh
[43:38] sometimes we can look at ourselves and
[43:41] be able to see where we have gotten away
[43:43] from God. Hallelujah, somebody. Amen.
[43:47] And and when and if we could just
[43:48] sometimes just take a a inventory,
[43:51] praise God, of where we are in our walk
[43:54] with Christ, how uh we used to be a
[43:56] little closer to him. Amen somebody.
[44:00] Amen. He used to get more of our time,
[44:03] but but uh but somehow we end up
[44:06] backsliding.
[44:08] Amen. But God says, "I will heal your
[44:10] backsliding." Praise the name of the
[44:13] Lord. Amen. I thank God for this promise
[44:15] that he has given us. But let us take
[44:17] our journey. Amen. Uh this morning, the
[44:20] next uh slide uh says, and I and I I was
[44:24] just thinking on this, Brother Quinton
[44:26] made a a statement. I I don't know if it
[44:28] was early this year or last year but we
[44:30] when we started on this journey of I
[44:31] will restore sayeth the Lord uh and then
[44:34] this year this this year being a year of
[44:35] overflow he made a statement says we can
[44:38] see restoration
[44:40] throughout the scriptures. We can see
[44:42] restoration throughout the scriptures
[44:44] and I'm sorry that our our screen is is
[44:46] like this. We might have to we might
[44:48] have to help
[44:50] uh but uh but but you you'll get the
[44:53] gist of it. But we can see restoration
[44:56] uh throughout uh the scriptures. And you
[44:58] know, so when we look at this this
[45:00] scripture, Amen. Today, we're going with
[45:02] and if we get through it all, but we're
[45:04] going to see restoration here in the
[45:06] scripture here. Brother Random says this
[45:08] next uh uh just hit next. uh uh in the
[45:11] sixth seal he says this but when you see
[45:13] scripture dovetelling with scripture
[45:16] making it a constant continuity
[45:20] where they come together the scriptures
[45:23] where this one leaves off here this one
[45:25] this other one over here comes and
[45:27] dovetailes in and draws the whole
[45:29] picture out like putting a crosswork
[45:32] puzzle together like you find the piece
[45:34] that fits in there's nothing else can
[45:37] fit it then you're getting the picture
[45:39] fixed And there's only one can do that.
[45:42] That's the lamb. So, we're looking to
[45:44] him. And as we're looking at this uh uh
[45:47] uh Hosea, we're trying to get Amen. the
[45:51] scriptures doveetailing one with the
[45:53] other. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[45:55] Because you know what we what we have is
[45:58] um you know and as we as we read just
[46:00] one other scripture in a little bit uh
[46:02] Ephraim got so engulfed in their idols
[46:06] that God said I mean away with Ephraim
[46:09] away with them. But here what we what
[46:11] we're going to see is that even though
[46:14] uh they get to a spot like that, God
[46:16] promises that he's going to heal their
[46:18] backsliding.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So amen. Sometimes people
[46:22] can be in some really bad situations.
[46:25] Lord,
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I mean, they they they've turned
[46:28] to just complete idolatry. But if God
[46:32] has promised that he is going to heal
[46:34] your backsliding, then there's nothing
[46:36] that you can do that'll stop God.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. From getting glory out of your
[46:41] situation.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your story is for his glory.
[46:46] [Applause]
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. But our
[46:50] our our responsibility is to make sure
[46:53] scripture dovetales with scripture.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us go amen to the next slide
[46:58] here. Uh here we see amen with um with
[47:03] Israel. I I like to call this
[47:05] backsliding Israel. All right. And in
[47:08] Hosea 4 uh verse 16 and 17 it says this,
[47:12] for Israel slideth back as a backsliding
[47:17] heer.
[47:24] That's some strong language, ain't it?
[47:26] &gt;&gt; But it's in your Bible.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; For Israel slideth back as a backsliding
[47:34] heer. Now the Lord will feed them as a
[47:38] lamb in a large place. Praise the Lord.
[47:41] Amen. Now, I I know sometimes you you
[47:44] see things like that in the Bible and uh
[47:47] it'll jolt you, you know, but but it's
[47:49] in the word, right? It's in the word.
[47:51] And and sometimes God have to use
[47:53] language like that to jolt us,
[47:57] &gt;&gt; right? To get us to kind of think a
[47:59] little bit more, right? But uh but here
[48:01] it says uh for Israel slideth back as a
[48:04] backsliding heer. Now the Lord will feed
[48:06] them as a lamb in a large place. Ephraim
[48:10] is joined to idols. Let him alone. Now,
[48:14] let me tell you something. Uh you never
[48:17] want to get to a spot in God
[48:20] &gt;&gt; where God say just leave them alone.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; I don't even want to deal with them
[48:25] anymore. I'm I'm tired of them. You You
[48:29] never want to cross that type of line
[48:31] with God.
[48:32] I I'm tired of they sin and I'm I'm
[48:35] tired of them going back and I'm tired
[48:37] of them up and tired of them down. I'm
[48:39] tired of it
[48:42] &gt;&gt; here. Here the scripture says Ephraim is
[48:44] joined to to idols. Just just let him
[48:48] alone. This you have reached a really
[48:49] bad spot when you're here with God.
[48:54] Hallelujah. It's good to know that you
[48:57] know the scripture didn't stop at Hosea
[48:59] 4. When we get to Hosea 14, we see God
[49:02] going to hear they backsliding. But but
[49:04] you never want to get yourself to a spot
[49:06] where God is just frustrated with you.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; You know, I mean, that happened with the
[49:12] children of Israel one time. I mean, God
[49:14] told God told Moses, he says, "You know
[49:15] what? I'm just so tired of them. I'm
[49:18] tired of they complaining. I I'm tired.
[49:21] I mean, they're not grateful. They
[49:22] they're very ungrateful people. I don't
[49:25] I don't care how much I do for them,
[49:27] they're never satisfied.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right. But but God say
[49:33] Moses, you know, just just move to the
[49:35] side. I'm going to wipe the whole
[49:36] generation out and I'm going to raise up
[49:39] somebody else to take their place.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; And Moses had to stand in the gap
[49:44] &gt;&gt; for the children of Israel because God
[49:46] was ready to wipe them out. You never
[49:48] want to bring yourself to a spot.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Hallelujah. Amen. We we we
[49:54] we we can't we can't uh we can't treat
[49:56] God like a grandfather.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where he just We always want
[50:01] We always want We always want give me
[50:04] this. Give me that. Give me this. Bless
[50:06] me with this. Bless me with that. No,
[50:08] no, no, no, no. You Amen. You going to
[50:10] have to have a re a relationship with
[50:12] him.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; And it's not a oneway relationship.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; If he's going to give to you, what are
[50:20] you giving back? Amen.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Here we go.
[50:27] I I I want to just I I I want to camp
[50:31] here just for a little bit. Ephraim is
[50:33] joined to
[50:35] idols.
[50:37] Idols.
[50:38] Not just one idol.
[50:41] Multiple idols.
[50:44] Now, an idol is an image
[50:47] or representation
[50:50] of a god used as an object of worship.
[50:54] Another definition for idol is a person
[50:57] or thing that is greatly admired,
[51:00] loved
[51:01] or reverent.
[51:04] And they gave some def some examples in
[51:07] um in uh in the dictionary.
[51:11] Uh the de the the example they gave was
[51:13] a soccer idol.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Now and uh and and if anybody know
[51:20] anything about soccer, I I really that's
[51:22] not a sport that I follow too much. So
[51:24] it it don't hit me the way it might hit
[51:27] a soccer a soccer fan. I I know I know
[51:31] Messi. I I've heard of his name and uh
[51:34] there's a whole bunch of others out
[51:35] there that you know really really good
[51:37] when these guys score goals and they
[51:39] score goals all the time. Uh I mean they
[51:41] become they become idols.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But uh I have to get to
[51:46] something that's a little closer to
[51:47] where I'm at.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; I like basketball
[51:51] &gt;&gt; and I like football.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; And I got to be very careful that I
[51:55] don't allow these things to become idols
[51:57] in my life.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I'm rushing out of church
[52:03] &gt;&gt; because I got to get home.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Can I talk to y'all this morning?
[52:09] &gt;&gt; I'm rushing out of church because I got
[52:11] to get I can't fellowship with the
[52:12] saints.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; I got an idol at home.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; It's called a television.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; And and I want to go and see something
[52:21] on that television. Hello, somebody.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; I want to see them catch that ball. And
[52:27] and and you see and and nowadays we got,
[52:29] you know, they they they we we get rid
[52:31] of one idol and then they give us
[52:32] another one.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; And and it's not them. It's the devil
[52:35] that get rid of one idol and then give
[52:37] you another one. I mean, maybe one one
[52:39] one player he has to retire and he can't
[52:42] play anymore, but they got somebody else
[52:44] they raising up.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. And they keep
[52:48] presenting this person before you. Now,
[52:51] you know, in football, uh, what I got, I
[52:53] mean, they they got they got the the
[52:55] Sanders boys. Everybody got their
[52:57] attention on these boys. Every and even
[53:00] though even though Shu is third string
[53:02] quarterback, everybody know he ain't
[53:03] going to stay there very long. That the
[53:05] devil want to use that guy.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; He got all the boys walking around doing
[53:10] like this.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. You're making
[53:15] that man an idol.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. And and then they
[53:19] got some coming up in college with NIL
[53:21] deals.

[53:30] Sunday,
[53:31] &gt;&gt; and we can't get you to come to church

[53:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, church.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; But but but but Ephraim was joined to
[53:42] idols, and we don't want to be this way
[53:45] in this hour. This is rapture hour. We
[53:48] don't need to be joined to any idols.

[54:09] fan, it's time for hockey. The devil
[54:11] just got you on a cycle
[54:13] &gt;&gt; and you just locked into the television.
[54:17] You miss prayer meeting because you want
[54:18] to watch television.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Am I telling the truth?
[54:24] &gt;&gt; All right.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Here, here here the the I'm giving you
[54:27] just the the the basic def definition
[54:30] from the dictionary. The dictionary says
[54:33] a person or a thing that is greatly
[54:37] admired,
[54:39] loved, revered.
[54:42] Hallelujah. Some guys, you can't even
[54:44] talk to them while they watching the
[54:45] game. Amen.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Are we talking to anybody?
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Right. You can't even get in their way
[54:51] while they watching the game.
[54:53] Hallelujah. That thing has become their
[54:54] idol.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The other other other uh
[54:59] definition they got is a movie idol.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; And I'm just reading the definition.
[55:04] They say Robert Redford is a movie idol.
[55:08] Now, I don't know all these different
[55:10] actors and everything out there, but I
[55:11] know that there are some actors people
[55:13] love to see them inside of movies.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whether they got cursing in
[55:19] the movie or not,
[55:21] &gt;&gt; sex scenes in the movie or not, because
[55:24] your favorite actor is in the movie.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Abram is joining
[55:32] God
[55:34] &gt;&gt; to idols.
[55:36] All right. Now, here, you know, we have
[55:39] we have movie celebrities, sports
[55:42] celebrities, music celebrities. Can I
[55:44] talk just a little bit more?
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Y'all don't shut me down just yet.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But but music idols and and
[55:52] and I don't know all the people out
[55:54] there. I don't listen to all their
[55:55] music. I I don't know. But I I do know
[55:58] some of the Christian artists and and I
[56:00] just got to say a lot. Let y'all just
[56:01] let me just unload my spirit. But I got
[56:04] but but but even in the Christian world,
[56:09] &gt;&gt; some of these guys have become our
[56:10] idols,
[56:11] &gt;&gt; right? And and um and what happens here
[56:14] even in the Christian world? Uh uh I
[56:16] mean they they are compromising in every
[56:20] area of of Christianity. I mean they not
[56:24] even Christians no more.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; What's that saying that that you say?
[56:30] I'm a I'm not a Christian artist. I I'm
[56:34] an artist. That's a Christian. What are
[56:35] you trying to tell us?
[56:37] &gt;&gt; I mean, you your the anointing that you
[56:40] got came from the church,
[56:43] &gt;&gt; right? But all of a sudden now you get
[56:45] out on this platform and you become some
[56:48] idol to somebody and you don't want to
[56:50] be identified as a Christian anymore.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; And we just buying up everything they
[56:56] got. Lord.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; My Lord.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; And uh recently we had a situation here
[57:03] where a young fell
[57:05] went to Sunday Best
[57:09] and he couldn't make it. No.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; But
[57:16] &gt;&gt; when he switched over to
[57:20] was it American
[57:22] &gt;&gt; American Idol,
[57:25] &gt;&gt; all of a sudden he becomes an
[57:26] ex-American Idol.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; And and and and the way he did that, he
[57:30] had to sing secular music in order to
[57:33] win over the secular crowd.
[57:35] And so he sings the secular music, wins
[57:37] over the secular crowd, and then he goes
[57:39] back to the the church to show everybody
[57:42] that he's on top of the world. And when
[57:46] he sings in church,
[57:49] hello somebody.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; I guess some of y'all ain't seen it.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; And if you ain't seen it, don't go look
[57:54] for it.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; But now this boy, when he come to sing
[57:57] in church, he sing with no shirt on.
[58:00] Yeah,
[58:01] &gt;&gt; in the house of God,
[58:03] &gt;&gt; you trying to be a idol to somebody,
[58:07] &gt;&gt; right? I mean, you won't sing here like
[58:09] that, my brother.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Put some clothes on.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To the lamb of God.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; But but but we allow these things and we
[58:19] just be following. I mean, I wouldn't
[58:21] even want to see a man singing in church
[58:23] like that.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; No reverence for God. no respect for
[58:30] God. And then not only that, even the
[58:32] church that every church just trying to
[58:33] get this fell in because he won American
[58:36] Idol.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Ephraim is joined to
[58:43] &gt;&gt; idols.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham makes some statements
[58:50] here and I won't I'm just giving you
[58:52] some some highlights. Says you can make
[58:54] God an idol.
[58:56] You say, you know how you make God an
[58:58] idol is that when you pray and you have
[59:01] it already fixed in your mind how God
[59:03] got to answer your prayer,
[59:05] &gt;&gt; you don't give him the ability to answer
[59:07] the way that he desires to answer it,
[59:09] but you fix it the way that he has to
[59:10] answer the prayer. You make God an idol.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; The brass serpent was given for healing
[59:19] in the Bible to the children of Israel.
[59:21] But but you know, but they got to a spot
[59:23] where, you know, the the thing was if
[59:26] somebody got bit by a snake, turn to the
[59:28] brass serpent and you'll be healed. But
[59:30] they got to a spot people ain't even bit
[59:32] by no snake. They still going to worship
[59:33] the brass serpent.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, watch this now. Because see,
[59:39] idols uhh can be a person. Idols can be
[59:43] a a a sport. Idols can be movie stars.
[59:47] Uh, idols can be anything that's admired
[59:50] or anything like that. You You got to be
[59:52] very very careful. Hallelujah. Can I Can
[59:55] I just make a statement? Just because
[59:57] you got Brother Brandham's a a replica
[1:00:00] of Brother Brandham's belt buckle,
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; it don't make you a believer.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; You know what the Bible say? These signs
[1:00:10] shall follow them that believe.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; It's not just because you have replica
[1:00:15] of things. That don't make you no
[1:00:17] believer. Everybody walking around with
[1:00:18] a briefcase ain't a believer.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Truth, brother.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; All right. I'mma just I mean, because
[1:00:25] we've sometimes even in the church,
[1:00:27] we've made Brother Brandham an idol.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'mma just tell it tell it like it
[1:00:32] is.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. We We made the prophet an idol.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; And that's not the way this is supposed
[1:00:38] to go.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was pointing us to the
[1:00:41] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm going just say it like
[1:00:46] this. That's why we don't sing songs
[1:00:48] here that don't glorify Jesus.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham told us that Jesus is
[1:00:55] the principal theme of the whole thing.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; We don't sing songs that just glorify
[1:01:03] the prophet.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; I know y'all heard them. Don't make me
[1:01:08] call them out.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Y'all done heard these songs that only
[1:01:11] glorify the prophet. You don't hear
[1:01:13] Jesus nowhere in the psalm.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Nowhere in the song. But they talk about
[1:01:17] the prophet. No, we not here worshiping
[1:01:19] brother Brandham.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; We worship the Lord Jesus.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; No, he's not supposed to be an idol.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here here's here's another one.
[1:01:32] Brother Brandham says uh you know uh and
[1:01:35] and I want to first the scripture
[1:01:37] actually say the commandment was not to
[1:01:40] have another god before the one true and
[1:01:42] living God. We're not supposed to have
[1:01:44] any other gods before him. Right? But
[1:01:46] but sometimes we make idols out of other
[1:01:48] things. We make gods out of other
[1:01:50] things. Right? It says uh brother Random
[1:01:53] says, you know, sometimes you get to
[1:01:54] church and you get so proud of your
[1:01:56] church,
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; so proud of your pastor,
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; you make your pastor an idol.
[1:02:03] We don't want none of that around here.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. The these brothers, they have to
[1:02:10] try to push me to the side. I was here
[1:02:12] the other night and and I saw him
[1:02:14] breaking down and I'm like, I can't just
[1:02:15] let them sit there and break down by the
[1:02:16] cell. Let me let me let me help out. The
[1:02:18] brothers say, "No, Brother Jack, I got
[1:02:20] it. No, brother Jack. I soon as I pick
[1:02:21] up something, another walk over, Brother
[1:02:23] Jack, I got it, brother. I now I
[1:02:25] appreciate that.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; I really appreciate that, but I never
[1:02:29] want to allow myself to get too high,
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:32] that I can't do things that just
[1:02:35] everybody else can do.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Even as the pastor, I can clean the
[1:02:41] bathroom.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; I mean, and my and my my mother-in-law
[1:02:50] says, "I walk by and see in that little
[1:02:52] desk and it just it just hurt me. I just
[1:02:54] want you to I want you to have your own
[1:02:56] office. One day God going to give me my
[1:02:58] own office, but right now I sit right
[1:03:00] there at that little desk and prepare my
[1:03:02] sermon and come out here and preach.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; I don't ever want to get too lifted
[1:03:06] high.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; God God allows things that happen in
[1:03:10] your life to keep you humble.
[1:03:14] [Applause]
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; So not only do you make your pastor an
[1:03:19] idol, he say sometimes you can make your
[1:03:21] church an idol.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Especially when you
[1:03:27] prosteliting people out of another
[1:03:29] church.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Why don't you leave there and come on
[1:03:32] over here where we at now? Don't talk to
[1:03:34] them like that.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Don't proite nobody. Let them be led of
[1:03:38] the spirit the same way you was led of
[1:03:41] the spirit.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah,
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; brother. When I I I remember brother
[1:03:45] Thomas say, "I'm just praying about some
[1:03:46] things." All right, you keep on praying.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; But you ain't going to hear me calling
[1:03:51] you on the phone say why don't you come
[1:03:52] over here. Uh-uh. You going to have to
[1:03:53] pray about this.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Amen. Amen. God has
[1:03:59] given you options. I'll tell you that
[1:04:01] much. But pray about which option you
[1:04:03] should take.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Amen. He
[1:04:10] said, "Brother Random said, you can make
[1:04:12] an idol out of an evangelist."
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Who preaching?
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Why you need to know?
[1:04:26] Because if my favorite preacher
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; ain't preaching,
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; I won't be there.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Well, you you got the wrong favorite
[1:04:34] preacher.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; You got a favorite preacher as a human
[1:04:37] being.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; But my favorite preacher is the Holy
[1:04:41] Ghost.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; And he can use anybody to speak to my
[1:04:46] needs.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; But we're not going to allow evangelists
[1:04:50] to become our idols.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; True. Oh, hallelujah, somebody. I'm
[1:04:56] talking about Ephraim join to idols.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give y'all another one that
[1:05:03] brother Brandham said can be your idol.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "Yeah, you can make your
[1:05:08] clothing."
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. True, Lord.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; An idol.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; It's a direct quote.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; You can make your clothing an idol. And
[1:05:19] this is what this is what they say.
[1:05:20] Because you want to be and spam
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; all the time.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; The prophet say you want to be and
[1:05:31] span
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; all the time. Some of us don't wear the
[1:05:36] same outfit twice
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; because we want to be sp and span
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; all the time.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Hello somebody. You can make your
[1:05:47] clothing
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; an idol. That's good.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Especially when you remember you ain't
[1:05:53] even have nothing in your closet
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; and you used to have to wear that same
[1:05:57] old outfit over and over and over again
[1:06:00] and you didn't bother you. But then God
[1:06:03] blesses you,
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; And now you can't be caught in the same
[1:06:06] outfit twice.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Boy, it's getting quiet up in here.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about what the prophet said.
[1:06:17] He say you can make your clothing an
[1:06:20] idol.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; It's all about you, ain't it?
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; The next on this um slide because here
[1:06:38] it says, "Israel slideth back as a
[1:06:42] backslide in heaven. Now the Lord will
[1:06:44] feed them as a lamb in a large place. E
[1:06:46] from his joint to idols. Let him alone
[1:06:48] hit next for me. Brother Random says,
[1:06:51] "But on backsliding, remember you
[1:06:53] backslide every day.
[1:06:56] There's no way at all for you to keep
[1:06:58] out of it." All right? But you backslide
[1:07:00] to the people in the church, not before
[1:07:03] God. You backslide on Christ, but you
[1:07:06] don't on God. It says, "Cuz if when when
[1:07:10] you sin, you're gone. But you're
[1:07:12] constantly fallen." Constantly fallen.
[1:07:16] constantly falling. Yes, sir.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; It says this uh it says Paul had to die
[1:07:23] every day.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Is that right? He had to die every day.
[1:07:27] Repent every day and just constantly
[1:07:29] repenting all the time. See, and if Paul
[1:07:31] had to do that, then I'm going to have
[1:07:34] to I'm going to have to to aren't you.
[1:07:36] That's right. So Paul said, "I die
[1:07:38] daily." And guess what? As believers, we
[1:07:40] have to die daily.
[1:07:44] True.
[1:07:47] Lord, I want to die daily.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Here, this next slot says again, Hosea
[1:07:54] 14:8, Ephraim shall say, "What have I to
[1:07:56] do anymore with idols? I have heard him
[1:07:59] and observed him. I am like a green fur
[1:08:02] tree. From me is thy fruit found." So,
[1:08:04] Ephraim this question uh what what have
[1:08:08] I to do anymore with idols? What what
[1:08:11] what what do I want to do with Lord? I
[1:08:13] don't want to be associated with these
[1:08:14] things. I want to be so so so so tied up
[1:08:18] in Jesus that these the worldly things
[1:08:20] don't mean nothing to me.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We got to get that way.
[1:08:26] Few observations here about um uh the
[1:08:29] book of Hosea. Hosea is located just
[1:08:31] before Joel in a canical uh uh canonical
[1:08:37] uh order of scripture. So I I noticed
[1:08:39] that cuz Joel talks about the
[1:08:40] restoration. But here Hosea is coming
[1:08:42] right before the book of Joel in the
[1:08:44] canonical order of scripture. The other
[1:08:48] thing we find is Hosea's name actually
[1:08:51] meant salvation.
[1:08:53] The name Hosea meant salvation. And uh
[1:08:56] and and I find it very strange because
[1:08:58] Hosea was a prophet that was told to
[1:09:01] marry an unfaithful wife. She was an
[1:09:05] adulteress. and what would happen in
[1:09:07] their in their marriage. Now, here God
[1:09:09] tells the man to marry this woman
[1:09:11] knowing that this woman is is
[1:09:12] unfaithful. She's a prostitute. And he
[1:09:15] goes and he marries her and she she she
[1:09:18] uh she she she slips out on him once and
[1:09:21] he finds her and he brings her back to
[1:09:23] his house and then she slips out on
[1:09:25] again. He goes back and he finds her and
[1:09:27] he brings her back to constantly going
[1:09:30] through this this cycle of restoration
[1:09:32] with his wife.
[1:09:34] Now, now, now most men would not want to
[1:09:36] marry a woman that he knew was going to
[1:09:38] be unfaithful to him.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; No man would want to do that. But, but
[1:09:42] you got to understand something about
[1:09:43] this is when you look at uh what what
[1:09:46] God is doing in the life of Hosea. Amen.
[1:09:48] It was symbolic of what was happening
[1:09:50] with the children of Israel.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not only was it happening
[1:09:53] with the children of Israel, sometimes
[1:09:55] our lives reflect the same pattern.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is constantly coming to get us
[1:10:02] out of something that he done delivered
[1:10:03] us from once before.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Y'all, I'mma say it again. God is
[1:10:07] constantly coming to get us out of
[1:10:09] something that he has already delivered
[1:10:11] us from.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; But somehow we find our way right back
[1:10:16] into these things.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Didn't God deliver you from makeup?
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Why you back into it?
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hm.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; And brothers, God deliver you from short
[1:10:34] pants.
[1:10:35] What? Oh, you got an excuse cuz you
[1:10:37] playing basketball. You can play
[1:10:38] basketball in sweatpants.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Hello. God deliver you from gossip and
[1:10:44] you find your way right back into it.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Hello, church.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Y'all still here today?
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about being been I mean
[1:10:52] delivered from these idols in our life.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here
[1:10:59] told to marry a a unfaithful wife. She's
[1:11:02] an adulteress. But also what we see is
[1:11:04] Israel. Amen. Is Jehovah's adulterous
[1:11:07] wife. The next uh just hit next. Israel
[1:11:10] is Jehovah's adulterous wife repudiated,
[1:11:13] but ultimately to be purified and
[1:11:16] restored. That's the theological
[1:11:18] definition. Amen. When you look at the
[1:11:20] book of uh Hosea, it's it's talking
[1:11:22] about a a a greater picture here. Not
[1:11:25] just Hosea and his wife and and but but
[1:11:27] it's it's this Ephraim, the tribe of
[1:11:29] Ephraim, how they get just engulfed
[1:11:33] in idolatry, right? But here, you know,
[1:11:36] it's it's a it's symbolic of Israel
[1:11:37] being Jehovah's adulterous wife,
[1:11:40] repudiated, which means she refused to
[1:11:42] accept or to be associated with. My God,
[1:11:46] repudiate, but ultimately to be purified
[1:11:48] and restored. Ultimately, she's going to
[1:11:50] be purified and ultimately she is going
[1:11:53] to be restored. I'm telling you, amen. I
[1:11:55] don't care what the devil got you in
[1:11:57] today. Ultimately, you will be restored.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Ultimately,
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Let me go a little further here. I want
[1:12:08] to on this next slide just bring in
[1:12:16] a little thought because we're we're
[1:12:18] going to when we look at um the book of
[1:12:21] Hosea we have to look at it from both
[1:12:23] the spiritual and the natural natural
[1:12:26] types of spiritual. I think we heard
[1:12:28] that on the tape on Friday night
[1:12:29] wonderful tape that we listen to on the
[1:12:31] countdown. Uh but brother Brandham
[1:12:33] talked about how the natural type the
[1:12:35] spiritual and when we look at uh how uh
[1:12:38] Hosea's wife was constantly committing
[1:12:40] adultery on him or fornication. Amen.
[1:12:43] Brother Random uses those word
[1:12:45] interchangeably. He says the church is
[1:12:46] also committing spiritual fornication
[1:12:48] and adultery. The church is doing that.
[1:12:51] Now let's look at something here.
[1:12:54] Bear with me here. I want to I really
[1:12:56] want to camp out on this one. What did
[1:12:57] they do from the Pergamian church age?
[1:13:00] What did they do? Bailac's teaching come
[1:13:03] down amongst Israel and they invited all
[1:13:06] the Israelites up to this big feast, the
[1:13:10] big blowout. He's talking about Balam.
[1:13:11] And Bailac, remember uh Bailac had hired
[1:13:14] Balum to come down and curse Israel, but
[1:13:16] he couldn't curse him three times. He
[1:13:18] blessed Israel uh rather than cursed
[1:13:20] him. And and and and that that's the
[1:13:22] thing when you know when God has blessed
[1:13:24] you, can't nobody curse you.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Can't nobody curse you, right? And and
[1:13:28] here even even had God had a donkey
[1:13:30] talking to you know the uh the prophet
[1:13:33] and letting him know why he didn't go a
[1:13:35] particular way and and the man after
[1:13:37] even talking to the donkey should have
[1:13:38] known to just turn around and go back
[1:13:40] home. But yet he got this he's he's
[1:13:42] headstrong.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you another thing that he
[1:13:45] was going for. They were going to give
[1:13:47] him prestige and they were going to give
[1:13:49] him money.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; So he he disregarded everything God was
[1:13:53] all the supernatural things God was
[1:13:55] doing. He disregarded all that in order
[1:13:57] to press forth for prestige and for
[1:13:59] money.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of us are running
[1:14:04] after money and running after prestige.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; You want to become an idol.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; So Balam could not
[1:14:16] curse him. So what he did was tell
[1:14:18] Bailac, "Invite them to church. Invite
[1:14:21] them to a service. And uh and when they
[1:14:23] get here to the service, there gonna be
[1:14:25] certain things happening here that's
[1:14:26] going to cause God to kind of come
[1:14:28] against them himself.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; My Lord.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; And watch this. Bailak's teaching come
[1:14:33] down amongst Israel and they invited all
[1:14:35] the Israelites up to this big feast.
[1:14:38] That's where you better know where
[1:14:39] you're going.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; The big blowout they had. Oh, some big
[1:14:43] party shindig of a thing up there. they
[1:14:47] had when they got up there. Why these
[1:14:51] Israelite people began to see these
[1:14:54] pretty sexy dressed Moabitete women.
[1:14:59] Now, let me just camp out there for a
[1:15:02] little bit. You know, when the
[1:15:04] Israelites Oh, let let me Oh, thank you,
[1:15:07] Jesus. Thank you. Um,
[1:15:10] you know, uh, it used to be a time that
[1:15:14] you could identify Pentecostal people,
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; It used to be a time we, you know,
[1:15:21] Baptist people carried a certain they
[1:15:23] they carried themselves a certain way.
[1:15:25] They dress a certain way. Uh,
[1:15:27] Pentecostal people dress a certain way.
[1:15:30] Uh, Catholic people kind of dressed a
[1:15:32] certain way, right? I mean, you can kind
[1:15:33] of see the difference, especially with
[1:15:35] the Pentecost people, cuz they only wore
[1:15:37] dresses and skirts.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about back in the day.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I mean, you can tell
[1:15:43] holiness people by the way that they
[1:15:45] dress.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. And
[1:15:49] and and I want to tell you that I mean,
[1:15:51] being a message believer, there is a
[1:15:54] certain way that we dress as message
[1:15:57] believers that we do not look like the
[1:15:59] others. Right. Amen.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; We're not supposed to look like the
[1:16:03] others. We're not trying to look like
[1:16:05] the others.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Let me
[1:16:11] This quote says that they went amongst
[1:16:13] the Moabitish women and they were sexy
[1:16:16] dressed.
[1:16:18] Sexy dress.
[1:16:22] I wonder what that looks like.
[1:16:26] Sexy dress.
[1:16:29] I can tell you part of what it looked
[1:16:31] like is a sister with a big old split
[1:16:36] up her dress.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; And you know, my pastor used to say it
[1:16:41] like this.
[1:16:42] You ain't got nothing for sale.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Take your signs down.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; But when you walk in that split, the way
[1:16:51] it it the what? Just just notice where
[1:16:54] they put the split at. Cuz when you
[1:16:55] walk, a man just looking right up your
[1:16:57] legs.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; And then when you sit down, you can't
[1:17:00] even sit down even to fix the dress to
[1:17:02] come on. Right.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; If it's too If it's too low,
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; that's sexy dress. If it's too tight,
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; that's sexy dress. If it's low cut,
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; that's sexy dress.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something, sisters.
[1:17:18] We don't want to be sexy dress.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; We want to use a different word that end
[1:17:23] with a Y. It's a four-letter word that
[1:17:24] end with a Y.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Holy dress.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; And And can I can I go a little further?
[1:17:31] Because that word holy, h O L Y, can
[1:17:34] also lead into another word, holy. W H O
[1:17:39] L L Y.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Holy dress.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Not sexy dress. That's not what we
[1:17:45] looking for here.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Let me Let me go further. I'm We going
[1:17:52] to get rid of these idols.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; We're going to get rid of these idols.
[1:17:57] [Applause]
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; I went to a funeral yesterday
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; and we there just, you know, bringing
[1:18:13] our support to this pastor who lost his
[1:18:16] wife. the pastor lost his wife and wife
[1:18:19] in the church, the wife that's married
[1:18:21] to the pastor is considered the first
[1:18:23] lady of the church
[1:18:25] and we're there, you know, and and I
[1:18:28] just so much that I'm seeing of how far
[1:18:32] the church has gotten away from God.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; It used to be a time where you saw the
[1:18:38] the homosexual men coming and they
[1:18:40] leading the choir and playing the
[1:18:41] instruments. I'm talking when I was back
[1:18:42] in Baptist, there was a we had
[1:18:44] homosexual musicians,
[1:18:47] multiple homosexual musicians. One of
[1:18:50] them got caught in the bathroom somebody
[1:18:52] with some boys or something like that.
[1:18:53] Just I mean just it was just always
[1:18:56] problems like that with with men. But
[1:18:58] now you see the women kind of coming out
[1:19:00] too.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; And this one woman I mean my uh the way
[1:19:05] you dress you telling us what you are.
[1:19:08] You are the man in a relationship.
[1:19:11] and and and and you the man in
[1:19:13] relationship, but you going to come up
[1:19:14] here and sing and say, "Come on, put
[1:19:15] your hands together. Come on, everybody.
[1:19:17] I I I can't clap my hands to this.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; I just and and the church won't say
[1:19:26] nothing about it. Spirits everywhere."
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something. I'm going
[1:19:32] just say it like this. I was just just
[1:19:34] meditating on and and I want to say
[1:19:35] these things. Church has simply become a
[1:19:38] sound.
[1:19:39] [Applause]
[1:19:41] Exactly. I
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; if it sound if it sounds good and and
[1:19:45] and and and there's no sound like the
[1:19:48] church sound.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Right. I mean, so so so you get some
[1:19:52] singers, you get some musicians, you get
[1:19:54] all this together and they create that
[1:19:55] church sound and these people feel like
[1:19:57] they had church, but nobody is condemned
[1:20:00] about the lifestyle that they're living.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Church is not just a sound. Church is
[1:20:05] where our lives are changed by the power
[1:20:08] of God.
[1:20:12] How can I sit here and and enjoy this?
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Now, now let me tell you something. As a
[1:20:17] human being, if I can sit there and I
[1:20:20] can't enjoy that, I know God don't enjoy
[1:20:23] it.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; What did you get delivered from? How you
[1:20:29] going to sing about deliverance and sing
[1:20:31] you going to heaven like that? No. No.
[1:20:34] You You ain't going to bypass the
[1:20:36] scripture. All people got to do when you
[1:20:38] see people coming to church like that,
[1:20:39] just read the word of God. Read read
[1:20:41] Romans, read read uh uh Genesis 19. I
[1:20:44] mean, they talk about homosexuality in
[1:20:46] the scripture, it is not accepted by
[1:20:48] God. Just like a adulterous life is not
[1:20:50] accepted by God.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; You know, somebody living in a life of
[1:20:55] adultery, they up there preaching and
[1:20:56] singing, "No, man. Come on, man. That
[1:20:58] ain't going to work." Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Something in my spirit just don't agree
[1:21:02] with it. Amen. But I'm sitting there and
[1:21:10] ladies were sitting behind me
[1:21:14] and I heard the ladies say, um,
[1:21:17] cuz brother Bram say it went the
[1:21:21] Israelites began to see these pretty
[1:21:23] sexy dressed Moabitete women,
[1:21:26] not Israelite women, Moabitete women.
[1:21:28] Right.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; I'm sitting there and and this will
[1:21:32] happen when you kind of go into some of
[1:21:33] these circles.
[1:21:35] You you'll get amongst the Moabitete
[1:21:37] women and you'll get inspired by these
[1:21:39] Moabitete women
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; rather than being inspired by the
[1:21:42] Israelite women.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Now the Moabitete women, I'm sitting
[1:21:47] there and and and we had a funeral. Lady
[1:21:51] uh there was it was a packed funeral. So
[1:21:54] people moving all over the place and
[1:21:55] everything. So lady got up and sat with
[1:21:59] her friends. And as she was getting up
[1:22:00] to sit with her friends, her friends
[1:22:01] say, "Hey, before you sit down, take a
[1:22:03] picture. Take a picture. Take a picture.
[1:22:05] Take a picture of me." I'm like, "You
[1:22:08] doing selfies
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; at the funeral."
[1:22:15] But it's not it's not just doing
[1:22:18] selfies. It's more than that. is how she
[1:22:21] did the selfies
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; in the church
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; at a funeral.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; I'mma shock you. I'm going to say
[1:22:30] something that's going to shock you, but
[1:22:31] this is what I heard and I'm just
[1:22:33] telling you what I heard. She said,
[1:22:34] "Take my picture. Take my picture and
[1:22:36] make sure you get my butt
[1:22:38] [Music]
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; in the church
[1:22:46] at a funeral." And then to come to find
[1:22:49] out it was her own pastor's wife that
[1:22:52] was dead.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; And all you can say is make sure you get
[1:22:57] my butt in a selfie picture.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Sin in the church.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; can I tell y'all something? See y'all
[1:23:06] young people that want to take these
[1:23:08] selfies. If that's the spirit that's on
[1:23:09] you that you want people to see your
[1:23:11] butt,
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; you got a bad a evil spirit on you.
[1:23:17] Amen.
[1:23:18] Yes, sir.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; That is not how you take no picture. No,
[1:23:21] sir.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; That ain't nothing holy about that at
[1:23:24] all.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; That's That's why we got to be so
[1:23:29] careful where what what what influences
[1:23:31] we pick up on,
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; You you I mean, let me tell you
[1:23:35] something. I mean, uh we talk about
[1:23:37] celebrities as idols. We talked about uh
[1:23:40] sports stars as idol, but you know,
[1:23:42] social media got all kind of idols all
[1:23:44] over it.
[1:23:45] influencers
[1:23:47] influencing you to do the wrong thing.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; You follow this page, you ought to see
[1:23:54] what they doing. You got to and you
[1:23:56] better watch it because AI is all
[1:23:58] intertwined. Soon as you click on one
[1:24:00] person here,
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; next thing you know, they start sending
[1:24:03] you all these other people because, oh,
[1:24:05] you like that and you like that. Maybe
[1:24:07] you're going to like this and maybe
[1:24:08] you're going to like they just keep
[1:24:10] flooding you with stuff.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; I said to myself, what in the world is
[1:24:17] going your pastor's wife
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; is here in a casket and all you can
[1:24:21] think about is taking a selfie picture
[1:24:24] in the church and ask people to make
[1:24:26] sure you take a picture of my butt.
[1:24:30] I sat there and I said, "Lord have
[1:24:33] mercy."
[1:24:35] Yeah,
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Ephraim is joining the idols.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; The problem with these, you know,
[1:24:51] selfies is a is a word that was never
[1:24:53] even
[1:24:54] a word until this day.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; And and and and I know there's a
[1:25:00] scripture there in Timothy that talks
[1:25:02] about being lovers of themselves.
[1:25:04] more than lovers of God. Right? And and
[1:25:07] the problem with most of these self I'm
[1:25:09] saying most of them are t are taken in a
[1:25:12] sensual or a sexy way.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; You don't get no likes.
[1:25:19] You just standing there looking plain.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; So you got to do a little something
[1:25:27] something in order to get some likes.
[1:25:30] Let me ask you a question. Who's liking
[1:25:32] your material?
[1:25:35] [Music]
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; If I as the pastor can't like it,
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; sometime I see something,
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; a saint
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; post something like that.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; That's because you're getting your
[1:25:55] influence from somewhere else.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me tell you, brother Brandham
[1:25:59] say it's really it's like you you get
[1:26:01] you either get an influence from the
[1:26:03] underworld trying to pull you down
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; or you get an influence from the upper
[1:26:07] world trying to pull you up.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Powerful. Amen.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; I tell you, if you want to test to see
[1:26:13] how how popular you are, how much an
[1:26:16] idol you are, post a scripture
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; and see how many likes you get.
[1:26:26] Lord,
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; y'all going to let me talk to y'all
[1:26:31] today?
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm going just make some more
[1:26:35] comments cuz this what came to me while
[1:26:37] I was thinking on this. Why do people
[1:26:41] drag up their past pictures
[1:26:44] and show them to the world?
[1:26:48] I'm talking the pictures of you in your
[1:26:49] makeup, you in your earrings, you in
[1:26:51] your, you know, I mean, you and your
[1:26:53] your your your pants, right? You know,
[1:26:56] brothers in their shorts. Why y'all drag
[1:26:58] up the old pictures and show them to the
[1:27:00] world? And you just put the picture out
[1:27:01] there with no explanation,
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; But then when somebody question say,
[1:27:05] "Oh, I'm just trying to show people
[1:27:06] where I came from." Well, tell them
[1:27:08] where you came from.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; And then show them a picture where how
[1:27:13] God delivered you.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; I used to be this way, but this is the
[1:27:16] way I am now.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go a little further.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Sisters want to look pretty.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham told us that. Sisters
[1:27:31] just want to look pretty.
[1:27:34] I'm going to say amen. I know sisters
[1:27:36] want to look pretty. Y'all ain't Y'all
[1:27:38] ain't going to tell me. Y' ain't going
[1:27:39] to say nothing cuz y'all don't know
[1:27:40] where I'm going.
[1:27:42] I I'm I'm going towards your idols.
[1:27:44] That's what I'm going.
[1:27:46] Sisters want to look pretty. That's what
[1:27:48] brother Brandham told us. Sisters, y'all
[1:27:50] have to always fight
[1:27:52] that spirit.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; They fought it in brother Brandham's
[1:27:57] day. They're going to fight it today.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Sister, let me just tell you something.
[1:28:04] When you push the envelope
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; with your high heels,
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; somebody going to always go further than
[1:28:12] you.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; And they're going to use you as the
[1:28:15] example. As this I saw sister so and so
[1:28:18] do this,
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; so I'm just going to go a little
[1:28:20] further. You don't want to be that
[1:28:22] sister that they look at as example
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; in a negative way. Right,
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; sis.
[1:28:32] Well, you just want to just do a little
[1:28:34] bit with my fingers
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; and just a little bit with my toes.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Now, it's not actually painting them,
[1:28:41] but it's right on the
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; right on the edge.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Guess what? Somebody
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; going to take it further
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; looking at what you just did,
[1:28:55] right?
[1:28:58] I'mma just do a little something here
[1:28:59] with my eyebrows.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Somebody
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; going to take it further.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; What about the hairstyle?
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Somebody
[1:29:11] going to take it further. And let me
[1:29:12] tell you something. It's always the
[1:29:14] younger generation that suffers the
[1:29:16] most.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; So the older generation got to set a
[1:29:19] better example
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; because the younger generation going to
[1:29:21] take it further. Way out there.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you can't stop them. And
[1:29:27] and and I I just I just I just got a I I
[1:29:29] got a question. Where does it stop?
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; What what's the stopping point?
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; And I I mean we got quotes for
[1:29:36] everything. I I remember somebody showed
[1:29:38] me a quote where they got one quote from
[1:29:40] Brother Brandon said that if you had a
[1:29:42] blemish in your face, then just put a
[1:29:44] little something on your face. Why is it
[1:29:45] that they grabbed to one quote
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; one that say that when he got thousands
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; that say don't put on makeup? Mhm.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; See what I'm going to tell you
[1:29:56] something. When you gravitate to the one
[1:29:58] quote,
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; it shows what's in your heart.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; That's exactly true.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Because you I can give you a thousand
[1:30:08] others that say he say don't do that.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Skint tight weenies.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Anybody heard them quotes before?
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Anybody heard that? Brother Ram say the
[1:30:18] lady look like a skin tight weenie
[1:30:20] dressing in clothes that look like look
[1:30:22] like skin tight women. Now I thought to
[1:30:23] myself now and you look at pictures way
[1:30:26] back way back in them days look like
[1:30:28] people look like no skin tight we wenies
[1:30:30] in and that but today
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; that form fitted dress
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; that ain't the right dress.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Hello somebody.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; And and here's the other thing now. Oh
[1:30:42] Lord Jesus. Some of us have different
[1:30:46] bills.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Right. You might be able to get away
[1:30:49] with a what they call it, a a A-frame uh
[1:30:52] skirt. A-ine skirt. A a a person that
[1:30:56] ain't ain't, you know,
[1:30:59] they might be able to get away with
[1:31:01] that. But another person is like,
[1:31:04] you can't get away with that.
[1:31:07] But I saw sister sister so and so with
[1:31:09] the A-ine. You can't wear that. God did
[1:31:12] not give you a A-line body.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:21] You're going to have to just
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; be
[1:31:25] grateful
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; for who God made you
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; and find the clothing that fit you
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; and make you look good.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Cuz when you go to the A-line, you look
[1:31:37] like a skin tighten
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; weenie.
[1:31:45] Straight. Straight.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Straight.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; This the straight.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Okay. Straight. You can't wear straight.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; You need flare.
[1:31:55] [Applause]
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; And you still look good in flare.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Now, I'mma I'mma just say this cuz I I
[1:32:04] really feel it it would be very good for
[1:32:07] my wife to do another modesty
[1:32:10] class.
[1:32:13] Now hold on y'all clapping. But here's
[1:32:16] the problem. Here's the problem. When my
[1:32:18] wife do that modesty class,
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; make sure people are here.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; If you got to go pick them up,
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; cuz you know, we don't want to be sexy
[1:32:29] dressed.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Modesty is the word that we're looking
[1:32:32] for.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:42] Did I get all my notes here? Let me just
[1:32:43] make sure.
[1:32:46] Oh. Oh, yeah. When you just decide just
[1:32:49] to show a little bit of your chest,
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; somebody else going to take it a little
[1:32:53] further than that.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; And and it's going to be sexy dressed
[1:32:57] women walking all around the church.
[1:32:58] That's not what we're looking for here.
[1:33:00] And brother Random say the Holy Ghost
[1:33:01] would not have a Holy Ghost fil sister
[1:33:04] dressed in such a way to cause a holy
[1:33:06] Holy Ghost fil brother to lust after
[1:33:08] her.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; That ain't the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; That's a ghost,
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; but not the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Why do I feel like it's April?
[1:33:24] Because April we do spring cleaning
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; and today the Holy Ghost wanted to do a
[1:33:30] little spring cleaning.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Ephim Ephraim Ephraim connected to them
[1:33:35] idols and God said let Ephraim alone.
[1:33:37] I'm tired of them being connected to
[1:33:40] these idols. I'm just I'm just tired of
[1:33:41] it. God don't want it no more.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; It's time to do an inventory. Personal
[1:33:46] inventory.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; I'm going further. We ain't we ain't
[1:33:50] where we where we want to be. This this
[1:33:52] I'm going to tell you this sermon goes a
[1:33:53] lot deeper, but we got have we got to
[1:33:55] deal with the surface things first
[1:33:57] before we can get to the deep things.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Let me read this quote.
[1:34:02] What do they do?
[1:34:05] Bailac's teaching come down amongst
[1:34:06] Israel and they invited all the
[1:34:08] Israelites up to this big feast and the
[1:34:10] big blowout they had. Oh, some big party
[1:34:12] shindig of a thing up there they had.
[1:34:16] And when they got up there, why these
[1:34:18] Israelites people begin to see these
[1:34:20] pretty sexy dressed women, Moabitete
[1:34:22] women. And now I I just even when
[1:34:24] brother uses a term shindig of a thing
[1:34:28] up there, they had what what he's
[1:34:30] telling you is that the music that they
[1:34:32] were playing
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; wasn't even appropriate. Right. Right
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; now in church nowadays,
[1:34:39] they done brought the
[1:34:42] brought uh uh secular music into the
[1:34:46] church.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; I just watched a little video uh uh um
[1:34:51] the pastor up there talking about we
[1:34:53] going to have to make some changes. We
[1:34:54] got to make some changes. And they had a
[1:34:56] a track and they would set it up just
[1:34:59] right for the church. Uh they had a
[1:35:01] track where when the pastor said we
[1:35:03] gonna have to make some change with our
[1:35:04] music. we have to elevate. We have to do
[1:35:06] this. They had the track that said,
[1:35:07] "Everybody dance now."
[1:35:10] And the pastor looked
[1:35:13] and the pastor took off and start
[1:35:15] dancing.
[1:35:17] And the musicians jumped in with the
[1:35:19] track and start playing the music. And
[1:35:20] I'm like, "Shindig
[1:35:23] in the church."
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Not here.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Not here. Yes, sir.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; If if you got to do that in order to win
[1:35:33] people, you ain't won nobody
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; cuz they life ain't been changed.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Let me go a little further.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm Brother Brandham said these
[1:35:41] things and sometimes we just read right
[1:35:43] over the top of them. Let's stop and
[1:35:44] really process what's being said to us.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. Oh why the Holy Ghost said
[1:35:52] that.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; What radio station you got on your car?
[1:35:59] What station are you listening to?
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; We don't We as believers don't feed on
[1:36:10] anything.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; We need We need the word. If you want to
[1:36:14] have a victorious day, you want your
[1:36:16] business to be blessed, you need to be
[1:36:17] listening to the word.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Not some secular radio station.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Secular talk people. You know the ones
[1:36:28] that just be cursing up and saying
[1:36:29] anything that go No, no, no. You can't
[1:36:31] feed your spirit that.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Hello church.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Some big party shindig of a thing up
[1:36:42] there they had. And and when they when
[1:36:44] they got up there while these Israelites
[1:36:46] people began to see these pretty sexy
[1:36:48] dressed moabitete women. Yes. Wasn't
[1:36:50] like their common girls down there.
[1:36:54] Lord have mercy. Jesus. Can I I'm just
[1:36:57] here now. Y'all just let me talk to you.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Um,
[1:37:02] my brothers,
[1:37:05] the sisters in the church will never
[1:37:08] look like them women out there in the
[1:37:09] world.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; And if you trying to compare a sister in
[1:37:13] the church with one of I mean them some
[1:37:16] of them women out Oh Lord have mercy.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; They done went through a lot of changes
[1:37:20] to get the body that they got.
[1:37:24] That's right. and you just looking and
[1:37:25] then you just No, look,
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; stay with an Israelite woman.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; If you want if you want one to take care
[1:37:32] of your your kids, you better stay right
[1:37:34] there. That praise God.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; And and some some fella, Lord have
[1:37:39] mercy, just heard an article of a pastor
[1:37:41] that got married.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Didn't even know.
[1:37:46] Didn't even know
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; he married
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; a man.
[1:37:58] [Music]
[1:38:00] in the church and he done courted this
[1:38:03] this man in the church. Man that's
[1:38:06] dressed like a woman and and and and
[1:38:08] made up like a woman. He like, "Boy,
[1:38:09] this a this is a nice nice sister right
[1:38:12] here." Come to find out when he got
[1:38:14] married, she wasn't a sister.
[1:38:20] You run out there and it chasing stuff
[1:38:22] if you want to.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; You better stay right here with one of
[1:38:25] these message sisters.
[1:38:29] [Applause]
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say you can't have
[1:38:32] it all.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Say one might have a great figure but
[1:38:36] not a great face and one might have a
[1:38:39] great face but not a great figure. I'm
[1:38:40] telling y'all what the prophet said.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; He said you can't have it all.
[1:38:50] Amen.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Anyhow, look, I I I
[1:38:54] mean, we might as well just let the
[1:38:55] rubber hit the road because I mean cuz
[1:38:58] cuz people, you know, this is why we do
[1:39:00] these selfie things. I mean, after that
[1:39:03] lady took that picture, then she say, "I
[1:39:06] don't like it.
[1:39:09] I look fat."
[1:39:11] [Applause]
[1:39:14] I it took everything in me just not to
[1:39:17] say nothing.
[1:39:19] You first of all, you shouldn't even be
[1:39:20] in here taking no pictures like this. I
[1:39:22] had a funeral and then you going to get
[1:39:24] upset by not liking the picture. I mean,
[1:39:27] it should have it should have been like
[1:39:28] in brother Brandham where the picture
[1:39:29] didn't even come out.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; You in here doing something like this in
[1:39:33] the church of the Lord, in the house of
[1:39:34] the Lord.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look, look y'all. Look, look,
[1:39:37] look, look, look.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; We We got to get back to, you know, we
[1:39:41] got to get back to the word.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; We We got to get away from this what
[1:39:45] society is pulling us into. We we we
[1:39:48] don't want to get to a spot where God
[1:39:49] say, I mean, you so join your idols,
[1:39:51] just let them alone. I don't want
[1:39:53] nothing to do with them.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Don't get that way with God.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; What God's trying to use is this word to
[1:39:59] bring you to a place of restoration.
[1:40:04] Brother Brandon goes on to say this
[1:40:08] says when they got up there while these
[1:40:10] Israelite people began to see these
[1:40:12] pretty sexy dress Moabitete women. Yes.
[1:40:14] Wasn't like their common girls down
[1:40:16] there. Oh, they look so pretty. my how
[1:40:20] how they were made and oh uh how they
[1:40:24] could show themselves
[1:40:27] and they fell for it and began to commit
[1:40:30] adultery
[1:40:32] and Balam know if God wouldn't curse
[1:40:34] curse them he'd take them over on this
[1:40:37] denominational side and cause the anger
[1:40:38] of God to kill them anyhow let God kill
[1:40:41] them himself if he could ever get them
[1:40:43] out of the way of the truth now what
[1:40:45] happened there in that story is you had
[1:40:47] a leader uh um uh uh like a a minister
[1:40:51] son that got with a priest daughter of
[1:40:54] the of the other nations. So a a
[1:40:57] minister son of the Israelites and then
[1:40:59] he gets with a priest daughter of the
[1:41:01] Moabites and he start he start they he
[1:41:04] would go get that girl bring her into
[1:41:06] the tent and and there in the amongst
[1:41:09] the children of Israel just sinning like
[1:41:12] crazy in the tent. There was one fell
[1:41:14] got so upset with what he brought into
[1:41:17] the tent amongst his own people. Some of
[1:41:19] us we lose the fear
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; of what we bringing into the church.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Especially when it come to some boy or
[1:41:26] some girl.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why it's best for you not
[1:41:30] to bring them. If they got if they got a
[1:41:31] spirit on them, don't bring you don't
[1:41:32] bring them. What you ought to be able to
[1:41:34] detect that spirit and say, "I'm going
[1:41:35] to get you connected to one of the
[1:41:36] brothers in the church. Let that brother
[1:41:38] bring it." Oh, I'm out here again.
[1:41:42] You mean he ain't got no car yet
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; and he need you to bring him?
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; That should be a red flag right there.
[1:41:49] Don't let the devil just give you
[1:41:50] anything.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; But this man brought brought this lady
[1:42:00] into the tent and and and one of the
[1:42:02] fellas got so upset, he took a javelin.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; While he was in the act of whatever they
[1:42:06] doing, he took a javelin and went
[1:42:08] through both of them.
[1:42:10] And God said, "I appreciate what he just
[1:42:12] did." Getting rid of the sin in the
[1:42:14] camp,
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; A lot of them died because of getting
[1:42:20] involved in this feast of Bal Peor. A
[1:42:22] lot of lot of them died. idol worship.
[1:42:24] God don't like it, y'all.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; People died in scripture because of idol
[1:42:29] worship. And we got to realize we got
[1:42:30] many idols right in front of us today.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Spiritually, we die because of idol
[1:42:38] worship. This next quote, Brother
[1:42:40] Brandham says this.
[1:42:44] It says, uh, "And as soon as you walk
[1:42:47] out and join church instead of receiving
[1:42:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you're
[1:42:52] dead." Not for you, but on here, I'm I'm
[1:42:55] letting that soak in. Soak a little
[1:42:57] while dead. You have a name,
[1:43:00] said to Luther, here of the Sardis Age.
[1:43:03] It says the word Sardis means dead. You
[1:43:06] have a name that you're alive, but
[1:43:07] you're dead. So you go to church, you
[1:43:09] got, you know, y'all got the music,
[1:43:11] y'all got the choir, but you dead as I
[1:43:13] don't know what
[1:43:16] the word sardis means dead. You have a
[1:43:18] name that you're alive, but you're dead.
[1:43:20] That's what God said. Yes. See, and when
[1:43:23] they had committed spiritual
[1:43:24] fornications
[1:43:26] up there, the church married from the
[1:43:28] baptism of Holy Ghost to denomination,
[1:43:30] they become dead. There you are. That's
[1:43:33] what the Bible said. That's what God
[1:43:34] said. Speaking to the churches. The next
[1:43:37] part of this quote, uh, brother Random
[1:43:39] says, "And God,"
[1:43:43] what did he do? He says, "And now when
[1:43:46] they did this evil thing," so when they
[1:43:48] brought when the children of Israel went
[1:43:49] there to the feast of Bal Peor, he says,
[1:43:51] "When they did this evil thing and they
[1:43:53] were in adultery, spiritual adultery,
[1:43:56] they worshiping an idol God, uh God
[1:43:59] killed 42,000 of them at one time." It
[1:44:02] says 42,000
[1:44:04] uh for committing adultery. And what is
[1:44:06] it? And what is it spoke of here in the
[1:44:10] church? Look at this. The spiritual
[1:44:12] adultery that you profess to be a
[1:44:15] Christian and still living like the
[1:44:18] world. So you know when you commit
[1:44:20] submit spiritual adultery is when you
[1:44:22] profess man I Yes, I'm a believer. Yes,
[1:44:27] I'm a believer. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Now how you living
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; after you singing? Right. Right.
[1:44:35] And if y'all just listen to the tape on
[1:44:39] on on on on Friday night, the countdown,
[1:44:41] if you didn't listen to it, I I I would
[1:44:43] tell you listen to it. Everything lot
[1:44:44] that we done dealt with, uh, Brother
[1:44:46] Brandon was telling people, it says, uh,
[1:44:48] you know, you want to be free, you know,
[1:44:50] from things that that God that that
[1:44:52] you've been bound with. He says, you
[1:44:53] know, you don't want to smoke no more.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; He also said this, you don't want to
[1:44:58] drink no more.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; He said it on the tape. So, so how
[1:45:01] believers gonna feel comfortable
[1:45:03] drinking when drinking is something the
[1:45:05] prophet say you get delivered from?
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; And that's that's just one tape. There's
[1:45:12] many others that Come on y'all. Look at
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; his daddy had a moonshield
[1:45:18] a a moonshine still.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; The man hated drinking.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; And even the angel said, "Don't you
[1:45:25] drink or smoke because I have a work for
[1:45:27] you to do when you get older." If the
[1:45:29] angel lord telling the prophet that he's
[1:45:31] also telling us the same thing.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; God don't God is not pleased with any of
[1:45:36] that. No sir.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; So how you going to justify that in
[1:45:39] scripture?
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; No, you can't do it.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Spiritual adultery
[1:45:46] is when you profess to be a Christian
[1:45:49] and you're still living like the world.
[1:45:54] I don't want to I I don't want to
[1:45:56] profess to be a Christian and still live
[1:45:58] like the world. I if I'm going to if I'm
[1:45:59] going to profess to be a Christian,
[1:46:01] I'mma be I'mma be a real Christian.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; And I used to say, me and my brother
[1:46:04] used to say like this. Look, if we not
[1:46:05] if I'm not going to serve God, if I'm
[1:46:07] not going to serve God, I ain't going to
[1:46:09] play with him.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; I ain't going to play with him. I'm
[1:46:13] going just go out here and do what I'm
[1:46:15] going to do, but I ain't going to play
[1:46:16] with God. If I if I made the choice that
[1:46:18] I'm not going to serve him, I'm going
[1:46:19] just go out here and do what I'm I'mma
[1:46:20] do. But I tell you what, when I decided
[1:46:22] that I was going to serve God, I stopped
[1:46:24] doing what I wanted to do.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. True.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; And I follow what God wants me to do.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Spiritual adultery
[1:46:33] is that you profess to be a Christian
[1:46:37] and still living like the world.
[1:46:39] Brother, receive you the Holy Ghost.
[1:46:41] Receive you the Holy Ghost. Get away
[1:46:42] from these old creeds and things.
[1:46:44] They're dead. Recite the Apostles Creed
[1:46:46] and some kind of creed and say a few
[1:46:48] prayers. Wrote out of a prayer book or
[1:46:50] something like that. Jesus never did
[1:46:53] tell his people to say a prayer. He
[1:46:56] said, "Pray, pray, pray." All right.
[1:47:00] Lord knows I I saw that yesterday, too.
[1:47:03] Somebody invited to pray. But then I
[1:47:06] wrote that prayer all the way out and
[1:47:08] had where I'm going to have certain
[1:47:10] inflections inflections at this point.
[1:47:12] This point I'm going to make my prayer a
[1:47:14] sermon because they didn't they didn't
[1:47:17] ask me to preach. So I'm going to preach
[1:47:21] in my prayer.
[1:47:24] sit down.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; I um I'm going to give you just a couple
[1:47:39] more things here and then I want to
[1:47:42] I got to I I I got to come back and do
[1:47:44] part two to this. I had to get the
[1:47:53] I had to get
[1:47:56] the foundation out of the way before I
[1:47:59] can bring
[1:48:01] the spiritual application here. And um
[1:48:06] Ephraim Ephraim made a statement,
[1:48:13] "What shall I do? What shall what have I
[1:48:16] to do anymore with idols? I have heard
[1:48:19] him, observed him. I'm like a green fur
[1:48:23] tree. From from me is thy fruit found.
[1:48:25] On the next slide there, let me just uh
[1:48:29] help you to see that in this
[1:48:33] um
[1:48:34] this prophecy towards Ephraim is not
[1:48:37] towards an individual,
[1:48:39] but this prophecy is towards a tribe.
[1:48:42] It's not a person. It's not this is the
[1:48:45] entire tribe of Ephraim that has gone
[1:48:47] through this um just being man sold out
[1:48:52] to idolatry
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; and God was God made a promise to them
[1:48:56] and and I want to just I want to show
[1:48:58] you something here that the the the
[1:49:01] scripture said I have heard him and
[1:49:03] observed him I am like a green fur tree
[1:49:07] from me is thy fruit found next for me
[1:49:11] let's find out who Ephraim is Uh Genesis
[1:49:14] 41 verse 51 and 52 gives us a little
[1:49:18] background of who Ephraim is and where
[1:49:20] this tribe comes from. Ephraim the Bible
[1:49:24] uh tells us Joseph called the name of
[1:49:26] the firstborn Manasseh.
[1:49:28] But God said he hath made me forget all
[1:49:31] my toil and all my father's house. And
[1:49:35] verse 52 says, "And the name of the
[1:49:38] second call he Ephraim, for God have
[1:49:41] caused me to be fruitful in the land of
[1:49:43] my affliction." Now look at that. Now
[1:49:45] Ephraim's original um uh uh his name
[1:49:50] actually meant to be fruitful.
[1:49:53] Hallelujah. But unfortunately we find
[1:49:56] the tribe of Ephraimid is they are in
[1:49:59] idolatry. But God actually established
[1:50:02] them to be fruitful. Now when they get
[1:50:05] restored, this is why when you look at
[1:50:07] the scripture in Hosea 148:18,
[1:50:10] uh uh it should be 14:8. I I made a
[1:50:12] mistake there. Uh Ephraim shall say,
[1:50:14] "What have I to do anymore with idols? I
[1:50:17] have heard him and observed him. I am
[1:50:20] like a green fur tree. For me is thy
[1:50:22] fruit found." When they come back to a
[1:50:24] place of restoration,
[1:50:27] the fruit will begin to bear again.
[1:50:31] Sometimes you've lost your ability to
[1:50:33] bear because of some of the stuff that
[1:50:35] you got in. You know what? You used to
[1:50:37] have dreams that God would give you. You
[1:50:41] used to have visions that God would give
[1:50:43] you. You used to walk in a certain place
[1:50:45] with God that he just I mean, you had
[1:50:47] fellowship with him. But somehow you
[1:50:48] lost that.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. When you can
[1:50:52] put away them idols,
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; you start seeing the fruit of that come
[1:50:55] back into your life.
[1:51:00] Let me just stop there for today because
[1:51:03] this is where we're going to make our
[1:51:04] turn and we're going to go into this
[1:51:06] deeper part of Ephraim, you know, and
[1:51:08] and how God's going to restore him. But
[1:51:10] I I I'm here to tell you like like
[1:51:12] Ephraim said, "What have I to do anymore
[1:51:16] with idols?" Let that be a question that
[1:51:21] settles and registers in your heart.
[1:51:23] What are the idols that are in my life
[1:51:25] and what have I to do anymore with them?
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; God, today is my day. I'm going free
[1:51:31] from these things.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; You done delivered me before and I need
[1:51:36] to stay delivered.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Not go back and pick these things up
[1:51:40] again. I'm telling church, we got to
[1:51:41] fight with everything we got. We got to
[1:51:43] fight.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; I don't want nothing to do with idols.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; I'm too close to a rapture.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; I don't need I don't need these idols. I
[1:51:51] don't need any of that. Look, some of
[1:51:54] the stuff that uh I get myself involved
[1:51:56] with, they won't be doing that in
[1:51:57] heaven.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; They won't be doing it in heaven.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; I can tell you right now, you ain't
[1:52:03] going to be sitting around watching no
[1:52:04] football game in heaven.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; That's not going to happen. Soccer game,
[1:52:08] that ain't going to happen.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Hello. Hello.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Looking for the next concert.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Ain't going to happen in heaven.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; And I'm not telling you that you can't
[1:52:19] do some of these things, but keep a
[1:52:20] balance with all this. Don't let Don't
[1:52:21] let it over overtake you.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, who the next movie? What's the next
[1:52:28] movie coming out? Uh-uh.
[1:52:30] I'm not following it. Cuz every movie
[1:52:32] they come I mean now they they got the
[1:52:34] thing now where where they try to give
[1:52:36] you um cuz all the curse and all that.
[1:52:38] So now they give you what's this new
[1:52:40] thing? Um
[1:52:42] yeah, it's Vid Angel. And they try to
[1:52:45] block out all the scenes and stuff like
[1:52:46] that. So you see you don't see nothing.
[1:52:49] It's still stuff slipped right on
[1:52:50] through all of that.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; What we need is just a heart where we
[1:52:54] don't even desire it anymore. God, I
[1:52:56] don't even want it. I don't even want
[1:52:57] it. I don't even need it. That that
[1:52:59] stuff don't need that stuff don't do
[1:53:00] nothing for me. It is not helping me
[1:53:03] spiritually.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; I want to put away my idols.
[1:53:08] I got I I want to give up my idols. I
[1:53:11] I'm reminded of a story there in in um
[1:53:14] Genesis 35.
[1:53:17] Um, Jacob was leaving his father, his
[1:53:22] his father-in-law, Laban. And as he was
[1:53:24] leaving Laban, he didn't realize that
[1:53:25] his wives had stole the father's idols.
[1:53:29] When he stole those idols, Laban came
[1:53:32] chasing Jacob down like, you know, y'all
[1:53:34] done left. You done left with my
[1:53:35] grandkids. You done did this. And the
[1:53:37] worst thing you did, you know, stole my
[1:53:39] idols. He said, well, who got the idols?
[1:53:40] He said, I ain't got your idols. I'm not
[1:53:42] taking your idols. He said, "I tell you
[1:53:43] what, anybody you find with the idols in
[1:53:46] this camp, you can kill them." Well, his
[1:53:50] beloved wife
[1:53:52] was the wife that had the idols. Rachel
[1:53:56] had these idols. And um and what she did
[1:54:00] was sit on the idols.
[1:54:04] And she lied to her dad and said, "Now,
[1:54:06] you know, it's my time of the month and
[1:54:07] I can't get up." But she's sitting on
[1:54:09] top of his idols and he couldn't find
[1:54:10] them. So, he left Jacob alone. but not
[1:54:12] knowing that the idols there. So, Jacob,
[1:54:14] Jacob, after after Laban left, Jacob
[1:54:17] come to find out that Rachel got the
[1:54:19] idols and and and and the and the
[1:54:21] sisters done come up with this plan
[1:54:22] where they took their daddy's idols.
[1:54:24] He's like, "Why would y'all do something
[1:54:25] like that?" And then he told him,
[1:54:27] "Before we go into the next step," he
[1:54:29] said, "Put away the strange gods
[1:54:33] that are in your midst."
[1:54:36] And you know what the Bible say they
[1:54:37] did? The strange gods were in their ears
[1:54:41] and in their hands and they had to put
[1:54:44] away them strange gods. Young people,
[1:54:47] that's why the sisters here don't wear
[1:54:48] earrings because it's a part of idol
[1:54:51] worship.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham taught us
[1:54:56] those things. Amen. And I know sometime
[1:54:59] you say, "What? How can we just not be
[1:55:01] like the No, no, no, no, no. We can't be
[1:55:03] like the Moabitete women."
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to be like the Israelite
[1:55:08] women. I'm going tell you,
[1:55:13] Pentecostal people used to look
[1:55:15] Pentecostal.
[1:55:16] Baptist people used to look Baptist. But
[1:55:19] I'm going to tell y'all something.
[1:55:21] Message people going to have to look
[1:55:24] message.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; You say you believe it,
[1:55:28] live it.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[1:55:34] Father,
[1:55:37] we thank you for your word,
[1:55:40] Lord. As the
[1:55:43] scripture has challenged us,
[1:55:48] we read there in the book of Hosea,
[1:55:55] Ephraim was so joined to idols,
[1:55:59] couldn't uh get himself free.
[1:56:03] from it. But Lord, you made a a promise
[1:56:07] that you, oh God, would
[1:56:10] you would heal the backsliding.
[1:56:14] We find ourselves in a situation like
[1:56:16] that today. We need you to heal our
[1:56:19] backsliding.
[1:56:20] We backslide every day.
[1:56:24] Lord, we we need uh a a checkup and
[1:56:28] inventory, Father. just where we are in
[1:56:32] our in our walk with you. For Lord, we
[1:56:35] want to live lives that are pleasing to
[1:56:37] thee. Sometimes we do things that are
[1:56:40] pleasing to us.
[1:56:42] But Father, uh when you went to a cross
[1:56:44] that wasn't pleasing to you, you went
[1:56:46] for the purpose of us. So now, Father,
[1:56:49] when we give up things of this world,
[1:56:52] Lord, sometimes it's it's not it's not
[1:56:54] pleasing to us, but it's pleasing to
[1:56:55] you. So we want to do these things for
[1:56:57] the for your glory and for your honor.
[1:57:01] Let the word give us direction. Let the
[1:57:03] word give us instruction.
[1:57:06] Let the word, Lord Jesus, just lead us
[1:57:08] and guide us. Those that are led by the
[1:57:10] spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[1:57:14] So Lord, I pray that uh you would help
[1:57:16] us, Lord, to be able to see ourselves in
[1:57:18] this that you, Lord Jesus, would would
[1:57:22] uh Lord, just bring us to a place of of
[1:57:25] true repentance.
[1:57:28] Just bring us to a place, oh God,
[1:57:32] Lord, where we can surrender all things
[1:57:35] uh to thee.
[1:57:37] We want to be more like you, oh God.
[1:57:41] Thank you for the inspiration, Father,
[1:57:43] of this sermon. And Lord, it's you you
[1:57:46] bring these things for a purpose because
[1:57:48] you don't want to see a church get to uh
[1:57:51] my Lord, like the the the denominational
[1:57:54] church today. You're you're nowhere even
[1:57:56] inside the church. The people have a
[1:57:58] sound just like Israel had a sound.
[1:58:01] Lord, when uh Moses and Joshua coming
[1:58:04] out of the mountain, it Moses Joshua
[1:58:07] thought, man, this is a great sound.
[1:58:09] There must be something great happening
[1:58:10] in the camp. Didn't realize the people
[1:58:12] were down there worshiping an idol god.
[1:58:15] Lord, this goes beyond a sound.
[1:58:19] A life must be manifested
[1:58:22] daily.
[1:58:24] So Lord, I pray that you would help us,
[1:58:26] oh God, to receive what the spirit is
[1:58:29] speaking to us.
[1:58:31] We lay ourselves on the altar, Father,
[1:58:34] that you Lord would consume us with your
[1:58:36] fire.
[1:58:38] It's in the name of Jesus
[1:58:40] that we pray.
[1:58:42] Amen.
[1:58:44] Amen. Let's stand to our feet. Let's
[1:58:48] sing a chorus of this song. I surrender
[1:58:50] all. Brother Solomon, I'll turn the
[1:58:53] service over to you and God bless you
[1:58:56] church. Amen.

[1:59:19] give.
[1:59:21] I
[1:59:23] will ever
[1:59:25] love

[2:00:04] I
[2:00:06] surrender
[2:00:08] all
[2:00:11] [Music]
[2:00:14] to Jesus
[2:00:17] I surrender
[2:00:21] humbly
[2:00:23] at his feet. I bow
[2:00:29] worldly
[2:00:31] pleasures.
[2:00:34] All
[2:00:35] forsaken.
[2:00:38] Take me Jesus.
[2:00:42] Take me now.
[2:00:46] Say I
[2:00:48] surrender
[2:00:50] all.

[2:00:59] all.
[2:01:03] All to thee, my blessed
[2:01:09] Savior
[2:01:12] I surrender
[2:01:16] all.
[2:01:20] All to Jesus
[2:01:24] I
[2:01:26] surrender.
[2:01:28] Make me savior,
[2:01:32] holy
[2:01:34] thine.
[2:01:37] Let me feel thy holy
[2:01:42] spirit
[2:01:45] truly
[2:01:47] know that thou are mine.
[2:01:53] Yeah.
[2:01:56] [Music]
[2:02:06] Oh,
[2:02:10] all to thee my
[2:02:15] [Music]
[2:02:20] serving.
[2:02:25] [Music]
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:31] Hallelujah. How many appreciates that
[2:02:33] message? Amen.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:38] [Applause]
[2:02:39] [Music]
[2:02:40] [Applause]
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; The Lord speaks things like this because
[2:02:44] he loves us.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; He don't want us to be wrong. Sometimes
[2:02:50] Satan will come in and a little thing
[2:02:52] just creep in your life and then he'll
[2:02:53] get a stronghold
[2:02:55] cuz you thought it was something, you
[2:02:57] know, something just nice, but then it
[2:03:00] becomes an idol to you. You start
[2:03:03] putting those things before God, then
[2:03:06] you start watching your whole family
[2:03:07] fall apart. Not just your life. It may
[2:03:09] start your life and then your whole
[2:03:11] family. And then you'll see things
[2:03:13] creeping into the church because we let
[2:03:16] we allow an idol to show up in our
[2:03:18] lives.
[2:03:21] When brother Brandon said, a true
[2:03:22] Christian life is living for others.
[2:03:25] You're not just living for yourself.
[2:03:28] The things that you do in your during
[2:03:30] your quiet time is not just for
[2:03:32] yourself.
[2:03:34] God is molding you and shaping you
[2:03:36] because you're a part of the body to
[2:03:38] benefit this body. You want to be an
[2:03:40] asset
[2:03:42] to the body of Jesus Christ. So when
[2:03:45] this word is preached, you take it. You
[2:03:48] go meditate on it. You re-evaluate your
[2:03:51] life.
[2:03:53] Get rid of the idols. You don't want no
[2:03:55] part of it.
[2:03:57] It may not be sin,
[2:03:59] but it's an idol. It's something that
[2:04:02] you putting before God.
[2:04:04] Sometimes he call us to
[2:04:07] get quiet, set aside and pray, but the
[2:04:10] game is on.
[2:04:14] Go pray. But Lord, the game is on. Then
[2:04:17] you hush that that voice.
[2:04:20] Then one of your brothers and sisters
[2:04:22] get in an accident and you could have
[2:04:24] been the one God wanted to use to pray
[2:04:27] to stop the accident from taking place.
[2:04:29] We're all a part of the body.
[2:04:32] We got to get rid of the idols.
[2:04:36] The prophet of God also said you can
[2:04:37] make your husband or your wife an idol.
[2:04:40] Your children can be an idol. Whatever
[2:04:43] you put before God is an idol. Let's get
[2:04:47] rid of the idols. Let's bow our hearts.
[2:04:49] Heavenly Father,
[2:04:51] we thank you Lord for your love for us.
[2:04:53] And truly, you put your love on display
[2:04:56] by taking our pastor, Lord, anointing
[2:04:58] him and using him and inspiring him to
[2:05:02] bring such a message at this time, Lord
[2:05:04] Jesus.
[2:05:06] Father God, thank you for our pastor,
[2:05:08] Lord, for yielding to you, Lord. Father,
[2:05:11] it's all your love being on display.
[2:05:14] Father, I don't get upset when I hear
[2:05:17] things like this. I don't get upset with
[2:05:19] my pastor. I love them even more. I love
[2:05:20] you even more because it's your grace,
[2:05:23] Lord, keeping us out of trouble. Father,
[2:05:26] I need my brothers and sisters and I
[2:05:28] believe they need me as well. So, I want
[2:05:30] to live, Lord Jesus, in such a way,
[2:05:33] Lord, that I can be a blessing to them
[2:05:35] and they be a blessing to me. Father,
[2:05:38] continue to use our brother. But I pray
[2:05:40] that you continue to use my brothers and
[2:05:42] sisters, Lord. Whether it be an
[2:05:44] encouraging word or a prayer or or a
[2:05:46] poem or or a song, Lord Jesus, or the
[2:05:50] musicians playing, we're all a part of
[2:05:52] the body and we need one another. This
[2:05:55] service would not be this service
[2:05:56] without your presence, but it wouldn't
[2:05:59] be you a service like it is without our
[2:06:01] brothers and sisters that believe. So,
[2:06:04] pro Father, I pray your blessings upon
[2:06:06] the children of Almighty God be with us
[2:06:09] as we leave this place. Lord, bring us
[2:06:11] all back at the appointed time. keep us
[2:06:13] all safe and out of harm's way. But
[2:06:15] Lord, this word that has gone forth,
[2:06:17] Lord, may it get down to the depths of
[2:06:19] our soul and cause us to have a spring
[2:06:21] cleaning, cleaning our hearts, cleaning
[2:06:24] our lives from everything that's not
[2:06:26] pleasing to you. Father, we pray that
[2:06:28] you will restore the strength, Lord, to
[2:06:30] our pastor. Lord God, strengthen him,
[2:06:32] bless him, bless all that he puts his
[2:06:34] hands to, not only he, but this entire
[2:06:37] congregation. We commit all things to
[2:06:39] you, Father, in the precious and lovely
[2:06:42] name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and
[2:06:44] Savior. Amen. Amen. God bless you,
[2:06:47] brothers. Brothers and sisters, you may
[2:06:49] have your seats. And our brothers will
[2:06:51] come and dismiss you at this time.
[2:06:58] [Music]
[2:07:06] [Music]
[2:07:11] Rest in pray.
[2:07:16] Keep my life clean every day. I want to
[2:07:22] go with him when he comes back.
[2:07:27] Come too far and I'm never turning back.
[2:07:32] Say God is
