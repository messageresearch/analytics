[38:23] shalt become a plane
[38:26] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[38:30] thereof with shouting crying grace
[38:33] grace unto you
[38:37] this morning i would like to ask a
[38:40] question in this title of this message
[38:45] what is the mountain in your life
[38:49] what is the mountain in your life we see
[38:52] here
[38:52] the ruber bell he said not what
[38:56] uh but who art thou oh great mountain
[39:01] that is before zerubbabel
[39:05] and you may be seated i'm sorry
[39:08] but we see a mountain
[39:12] it it represents
[39:15] a man a resisting power
[39:18] something that is an obstacle that is in
[39:22] your way
[39:24] amen a while back i preached a message
[39:27] uh
[39:28] from journey of the journey from law to
[39:30] grace
[39:32] and our christian walk is a journey
[39:36] we see that the uh israel when they left
[39:39] egypt they they had to embark on a
[39:42] journey to get
[39:43] to the promised land and along the way
[39:46] that came many
[39:47] obstacles in the way amen
[39:51] and we're going to talk on some of those
[39:53] obstacles us
[39:54] we we we have obstacles and mountains
[39:58] in our way of this day
[40:01] and we see here according to uh
[40:05] uh zerubbabel and many say that
[40:08] he shall bring forth the headstone
[40:11] thereof with shouting's crying grace
[40:13] grace
[40:14] amen the headstone represents
[40:18] the completion of the building
[40:22] amen while again the mountain
[40:24] symbolizing a resisting power
[40:28] an obstacle that is trying to keep you
[40:31] from
[40:31] uh from doing the will of god amen
[40:35] to keep you from completing what you
[40:37] started
[40:39] amen we see in hebrews the 10th chapter
[40:43] the bible says that a body thou has
[40:46] prepared for me
[40:48] amen and uh uh we see
[40:52] that that that there are many
[40:53] oppositions there's many
[40:55] things a man that uh
[40:58] that uh that that that we're going up
[41:01] against
[41:02] amen most of the time
[41:06] amen we find the opposition is not so
[41:09] much
[41:10] physical during the time
[41:13] of uh uh of the israelites
[41:16] there were physical battles but
[41:19] they are spiritual types those
[41:22] are spiritual battle the bible says that
[41:25] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[41:28] but against principalities spiritual
[41:31] wickedness in high places
[41:33] so our our enemy a lot of times
[41:37] amen uh uh is in our own mind
[41:41] amen some prophet brought out that
[41:44] that's the battlefield
[41:46] that is where uh our conflict is a lot
[41:49] of times within our own mind
[41:52] this is why the scripture says that we
[41:54] have to have our minds
[41:56] renewed amen but
[41:59] we we receive that uh uh the headstone
[42:03] coming down is a man to to uh uh
[42:07] not give us to to give do away with our
[42:10] mind
[42:11] amen but the headstone is the
[42:15] mind of christ coming down amen we're
[42:18] we're taking on his mind amen we're
[42:22] taking on his thoughts
[42:24] we're taking on the attributes of men of
[42:27] our god
[42:28] amen so we see here in ephesians 4 that
[42:33] it says we put off the uh
[42:36] cut off concerning the former
[42:37] conversations
[42:39] he said uh the man of the former
[42:42] conversations
[42:43] our manner of life and conduct
[42:46] and behavior see because our
[42:50] conduct and behavior amen
[42:54] is a learned behavior amen uh we may
[42:58] have somebody that we at some time
[43:00] looked up to or
[43:01] or or we have had to look to it and we
[43:04] kind of pattern ourselves after
[43:06] they call them role models and man and
[43:08] we take on
[43:10] their characteristics sometimes uh
[43:13] uh you put a child in front of the
[43:15] television he's gonna take on the
[43:17] characteristics and
[43:19] the habits of what he's watching so
[43:22] through time
[43:23] what happened was we as people and as
[43:25] christians
[43:26] oh amen as we have taken on
[43:29] sometimes bad habits
[43:33] and man we've taken on uh uh all the
[43:36] characteristics and things of
[43:38] of of things that were not what god
[43:41] intended
[43:42] amen so uh it says on here that
[43:47] the old man which is corrupt according
[43:49] to deceitful lust
[43:52] amen so the way to to
[43:55] put off amen something
[44:01] to how the way a man to get
[44:04] rid of something is to put on
[44:07] something else amen
[44:11] you it light light chases away
[44:15] darkness amen
[44:18] so if there's there's there's there's
[44:20] things about you that
[44:22] that may be a mountain that may be a
[44:24] hindrance
[44:25] amen we have to put on righteousness
[44:30] amen we have to as we receive more of
[44:33] god
[44:34] amen who is light more darkness
[44:37] is chased away in our lives
[44:41] amen this is why
[44:44] amen that we are a christian
[44:47] can't wait for those of the church to be
[44:49] open
[44:51] amen this is why a christian is
[44:54] constantly feeding amen on the things of
[44:57] god
[44:57] because it's a constant battle and you
[45:01] want to
[45:01] amen as i said the last time i preached
[45:03] we're constantly feeding
[45:05] the white dog amen because
[45:08] amen we don't want the devil to get a
[45:11] foothold
[45:13] amen it's not only that we have to
[45:16] conquer
[45:16] amen and and our
[45:20] the souls of our foot straight upon amen
[45:23] but we also have to
[45:24] fight to maintain the ground that we
[45:27] gain
[45:28] amen amen
[45:32] i'd like to read something here
[45:35] talking about those obstacles
[45:39] those things that hinder those things
[45:42] that are in the way

[53:21] devil is on your land amen keeping you
[53:25] from the full promises of god you drive
[53:28] that devil off your land

[55:15] your land the message here
[55:19] preached in 1961
[55:22] amen oh one seventeen
[55:26] amen i apologize
[55:30] uh i think it's going to be around
[55:33] paragraph
[55:34] 30
[55:38] paragraph 30. you can find it there
[55:41] amen the prophet was saying now
[55:48] you don't have to die to this
[55:52] not naturally he's saying you
[55:55] have to spiritually die
[55:59] but you don't have to physically die
[56:03] the inside is where god gets in
[56:07] to control you he presses himself
[56:11] forward into you
[56:14] don't let any root of bitterness
[56:17] hatred malice strife
[56:21] that'll run him right back again
[56:25] you drive those things off your
[56:29] it is hindering god it says he will
[56:33] he will leave because he can't dwell
[56:36] amen amongst those kind of spirits you
[56:39] drive those things off of your land
[56:42] amen he said just get all of the
[56:45] meanness
[56:46] and superstitions and
[56:50] all unbelief out of you
[56:53] now i would like to
[56:56] pause right there before i
[57:00] finish that quote and i would like to
[57:06] look at thessalonians
[57:11] amen the fifth chapter
[57:14] thessalonians the fifth chapter in the
[57:16] 23rd verse
[57:19] says and the very god of peace
[57:24] sanctify you holy
[57:29] and i pray god
[57:33] your whole spirit soul
[57:37] and body be preserved blameless
[57:41] unto the coming of the lord
[57:44] now we go back to this quote i want you
[57:47] to pay attention to what the prophet
[57:48] said here
[57:50] we are a triune being
[57:54] we are a body that is contacted by our
[57:58] five sentences of see taste hear smell
[58:02] touch amen but we have a spirit
[58:05] that is also contacted by
[58:09] imagination affection and and and i
[58:12] haven't written down i can't remember
[58:13] all the top of my head
[58:14] but you know what i'm talking about but
[58:17] you have a third room
[58:19] amen that is only has
[58:23] faith or doubt
[58:26] belief or doubt that is the three realms
[58:30] of a man so the prophet here
[58:33] uh is saying that
[58:37] you want to run him right back
[58:41] just get all the meanness
[58:45] which is on the physical realm
[58:48] superstitions
[58:50] which is on the spirit spirit realm
[58:53] and unbelief which is in the soul
[58:56] see because that devil can possess
[59:00] any one of those areas he can possess
[59:03] you physically
[59:05] he can possess you spiritually
[59:09] or he can possess your soul
[59:13] i'ma try i read it to you a bit but the
[59:16] prophet said
[59:17] that you can be totally insane
[59:22] and still have the baptism by the holy
[59:24] ghost
[59:26] i'm gonna read it to you totally insane
[59:34] bear with me i'll get to it let me
[59:37] continue reading this quote
[59:40] amen from the message messiah
[59:44] amen he says here

[59:50] meanness

[1:02:55] amen that you be renewed in your mind
[1:02:59] put off the former conversations
[1:03:03] amen to corrupt according to the
[1:03:05] deceitful lust
[1:03:07] amen that the way to put off something
[1:03:10] is to put on
[1:03:11] to take home more christ amen and run
[1:03:14] them doubles out
[1:03:15] the bible says amen in matthew
[1:03:19] 7 13 enter into ye gates
[1:03:23] for straight amen enter in
[1:03:27] enter ye in at the straight gate
[1:03:31] for why is the gate and broad is the way
[1:03:35] that leadeth to destruction amen
[1:03:40] and many there be will go
[1:03:43] and find they're at amen
[1:03:46] but the fourth verse in the seventh
[1:03:48] chapter says
[1:03:50] because straight is the way
[1:03:54] and narrow straight is the gate and
[1:03:57] narrow is the way that leads to life
[1:04:00] so you can't go around that mountain
[1:04:05] many times we see people trying to
[1:04:08] find an alternative route
[1:04:12] they try amen well i don't like
[1:04:15] i this is this battle is too hard
[1:04:19] this is a huge obstacle this is a
[1:04:23] difficult mountain is too high to climb
[1:04:27] and it's too wide to go around so
[1:04:31] instead of you possessing the gate
[1:04:35] instead of you speaking to that mountain
[1:04:38] that obstacle in your life you say well
[1:04:42] i'm just going to take the long way
[1:04:44] around you foolish virgin
[1:04:47] you won't make it the mountain's too
[1:04:50] wide
[1:04:51] and it's too high amen you speak to that
[1:04:54] mountain
[1:04:55] amen and possess what's yours that
[1:04:58] mountain is not a literal mountain
[1:05:00] it is an opposing force it is an
[1:05:03] amalekite
[1:05:04] or a jesuicise that is keeping you
[1:05:08] amen from the promises that god gave you
[1:05:10] it is something that is in your way
[1:05:13] you speak to that devil you claim
[1:05:16] victory in the name of jesus
[1:05:18] and possess your language you can't go
[1:05:22] around it
[1:05:23] hey man straight is the way
[1:05:27] narrow is the gate amen
[1:05:30] that lead it to life there's only one
[1:05:33] way
[1:05:34] you can't go round it you can't go over
[1:05:37] you got to go straight says that in
[1:05:40] zachariah
[1:05:41] he promised a man just to rub the bell
[1:05:44] as
[1:05:45] our shout become a plane amen and he
[1:05:48] shall bring forth the headstone
[1:05:51] what is the headstone the headstone is
[1:05:54] the bind of christ amen the mind of
[1:05:58] christ
[1:05:59] amen through seven church ages amen
[1:06:01] we're building a body
[1:06:03] amen through seven church ages god is
[1:06:06] preparing
[1:06:07] amen a body amen if we look on the
[1:06:09] dollar bill and we see that pyramid
[1:06:12] had no cap on it but if we are living in
[1:06:14] the time
[1:06:15] amen with a mind of christ the capstone
[1:06:19] has come down which is what the mind of
[1:06:22] christ
[1:06:24] amen to complete that building amen to
[1:06:27] give us a man
[1:06:29] i wouldn't say just the intelligence but
[1:06:32] to give
[1:06:32] us those things amen that we were
[1:06:34] lacking amen to give us the knowledge
[1:06:37] amen
[1:06:38] that would give us the ability to know
[1:06:40] right from wrong
[1:06:43] people don't know right from wrong why
[1:06:47] because they have born and sin shaped in
[1:06:50] iniquity
[1:06:51] come into the world speaking life and
[1:06:53] they have taken on the characteristics
[1:06:56] of the things around them amen
[1:07:00] the prophet was bringing out if your
[1:07:02] grandmother
[1:07:04] had dressed the way some of the people
[1:07:06] dressed today
[1:07:07] they would have locked her up in an
[1:07:09] insane asylum
[1:07:13] but because of the culture
[1:07:16] that are it seems okay
[1:07:21] we're going to get into something get
[1:07:23] ahead of myself
[1:07:24] you love the lord amen
[1:07:30] the 23rd chapter of ephesians says
[1:07:36] and be renewed in the spirit
[1:07:40] of your mind your mind is renewed
[1:07:45] and healed of false
[1:07:48] understanding of the word
[1:07:51] when true revelation and understanding
[1:07:54] of the word
[1:07:55] is made clear to you in other words
[1:07:59] you automatically put off your old
[1:08:03] thinking amen and replace
[1:08:06] your thoughts with truth of the word
[1:08:11] and then that affects your manner of
[1:08:12] life and conduct
[1:08:15] see that's what we're talking about amen
[1:08:20] healing is really just
[1:08:25] a restoration of what you lost
[1:08:29] amen god created you whole
[1:08:34] and a physical healing is just a
[1:08:37] restoration
[1:08:38] of where where you were amen
[1:08:43] now remember we are triune being
[1:08:46] so the healing
[1:08:50] can only can take place on the physical
[1:08:52] realm
[1:08:53] it can take place on that
[1:08:56] spiritual realm mentally
[1:09:00] and on the soul rim says in other words
[1:09:03] healing brings you back to the original
[1:09:05] condition of what god intended you
[1:09:07] to be in body spirit
[1:09:11] and soul we find out today
[1:09:15] that there are just as many
[1:09:18] mental hospitals as there are physical
[1:09:20] hospitals
[1:09:23] people are losing their mind
[1:09:28] i got a good quote for you a little bit
[1:09:29] later we get to it
[1:09:32] prophets say they are totally insane
[1:09:36] why because we got away from god
[1:09:41] but the headstone has come back
[1:09:45] amen we know since
[1:09:48] the fall of man in the garden man has
[1:09:51] endured
[1:09:51] sickness in both body mind and soul
[1:09:56] you can find this in the messages he
[1:09:59] preached on demonology
[1:10:00] he breaks it out amen we talk so much
[1:10:04] about healing of the body
[1:10:06] we focus our focus so much focus is on
[1:10:11] placed in that area of the healing of
[1:10:13] the body
[1:10:14] amen that was one of the main
[1:10:16] attractions in his first
[1:10:18] and second pull and draw big crowds
[1:10:22] amen for the healing of the body but
[1:10:25] many came through the line it was a
[1:10:27] mental
[1:10:28] healing that they needed it was
[1:10:31] nervousness
[1:10:32] it was some kind of mental devil that
[1:10:34] needed to be healed on that realm
[1:10:37] it wasn't nothing in the body they
[1:10:38] thought it was the mental
[1:10:40] uh uh or thing affected the body
[1:10:44] amen one place it was fear
[1:10:48] another it was uh uh or something
[1:10:50] menopause
[1:10:52] amen that would cause reaction somebody
[1:10:55] said
[1:10:56] you'll be all right you just need that
[1:10:59] it's fear on you see so
[1:11:02] they needed uh more than just physical
[1:11:05] healing
[1:11:06] however some
[1:11:10] came through the prayer line and was
[1:11:12] physically healed
[1:11:14] but still believed in the trinitarian
[1:11:15] doctrine
[1:11:17] they left with a sick soul
[1:11:20] a sick soul but see the pro the bible
[1:11:23] says that after
[1:11:24] that you be well holy
[1:11:27] in body mind and body spirit and soul
[1:11:31] amen amen now we see
[1:11:37] it attracted big crowds but when we get
[1:11:41] to the third pool
[1:11:43] we find that our focus is not on the
[1:11:46] healing of the body
[1:11:48] so much as it's on the healing of the
[1:11:51] way we
[1:11:52] think in regards to the revelation
[1:11:55] of the word we know
[1:11:58] that the pyramid was god's
[1:12:02] second bible the stars was his first
[1:12:06] bible
[1:12:07] amen his second bible was the pyramids
[1:12:11] and that the rejected capstone of that
[1:12:13] pyramid represented the mind of christ
[1:12:15] coming down
[1:12:16] connecting with the rest of the pyramid
[1:12:20] amen
[1:12:23] so which is speaking of this age when
[1:12:26] the body of
[1:12:28] christ amen down through seven church
[1:12:31] ages is to unite
[1:12:33] with the mind of christ the headstone
[1:12:37] of the word to complete the entire body
[1:12:41] amen of the second eve
[1:12:46] and this is our part in this age
[1:12:50] we are the part of the body that
[1:12:52] connects to the great
[1:12:53] capstone and headship
[1:12:57] of the word amen we we we've already
[1:13:01] come through
[1:13:01] amen the time of the the defeat
[1:13:05] amen and the the going up to chris but
[1:13:08] now we are right here we are the we
[1:13:10] right here
[1:13:11] this age lady yoseah
[1:13:15] this age this time we are with the
[1:13:19] headstone
[1:13:20] is to come back and fitly join
[1:13:24] so we have to be honed to perfection
[1:13:27] amen the mind of christ
[1:13:31] will fitly join nobody
[1:13:34] they without us cannot be made perfect
[1:13:38] what a time to be living in what are
[1:13:41] people to be
[1:13:43] amen so we see in genesis
[1:13:52] before i go on
[1:13:57] i'd like to
[1:14:07] the prophet said the angel
[1:14:12] 48 0304
[1:14:16] the angel of god
[1:14:20] amen the prophet preached
[1:14:23] he said
[1:14:27] trying to decide how far to go back here
[1:14:30] here a few weeks ago a woman came into
[1:14:32] the line
[1:14:34] who was somewhat uh he said the
[1:14:36] newspaper
[1:14:38] gave us an awful write-up about the
[1:14:40] ambulances
[1:14:41] blocking the streetcar and tracks
[1:14:44] and things and the lady
[1:14:50] the lady uh i went to
[1:14:54] touch her hand before i could touch her
[1:14:57] hand
[1:14:58] she said i have cancer
[1:15:03] she had around oh about 10 or 12
[1:15:07] cancers and they were hitting from all
[1:15:10] different parts
[1:15:12] and my hands swole quickly the
[1:15:15] vibrations running over it
[1:15:17] and she said can anything be done for me
[1:15:20] i said if you can believe but if
[1:15:24] i should rebuke it and send it away
[1:15:28] and if you doubt it it'll return back
[1:15:32] and if you do not serve christ
[1:15:36] then it'll return back i said
[1:15:40] i perceive that you're not a christian
[1:15:45] she said no i'm not then
[1:15:49] when she looked at me in the
[1:15:52] eye might as well
[1:15:55] tell you this because
[1:15:59] many of the people already know it
[1:16:02] when sometimes when i can catch their
[1:16:06] eyes that's how
[1:16:09] i get them into that channel
[1:16:14] you see and then
[1:16:18] it's not a mind reading
[1:16:21] it's not psychology
[1:16:25] if it is then paul used it when he
[1:16:28] looked upon a man and said i perceive
[1:16:31] you have faith to be healed
[1:16:35] i will grant you this it is
[1:16:39] psychology in this way
[1:16:43] if the word psych of course
[1:16:46] means mind and
[1:16:49] it's the mind of christ
[1:16:52] that the human being has the
[1:16:56] privilege to enter in
[1:17:00] and know the mind of christ
[1:17:03] hallelujah my what a reality to
[1:17:08] dwell in the channel of christ we
[1:17:11] unworthy mortals having brought
[1:17:15] into the sons and daughters of
[1:17:18] god to be fellow citizens
[1:17:21] oh how man i get shouting
[1:17:25] uh i get to shouting when i get as
[1:17:29] mortal beings think about it
[1:17:32] you have the privilege
[1:17:37] the privilege to enter
[1:17:40] in to the mind of christ
[1:17:46] what a honor that he is
[1:17:49] amen we're going to go on
[1:17:54] now we see in genesis
[1:17:58] the second chapter the 21st and the 23rd
[1:18:01] verse says the lord caused a deep sleep
[1:18:03] to fall upon adam
[1:18:06] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[1:18:10] and closed up the flesh
[1:18:13] uh and the real
[1:18:17] which the lord had taken from man
[1:18:21] he made woman and brought her
[1:18:25] unto the man and adam said
[1:18:28] this is now bone of my bone
[1:18:33] and flesh of my flesh she shall be
[1:18:36] called
[1:18:37] woman because she was taken
[1:18:41] out of the man
[1:18:44] i want you to notice
[1:18:47] that when god does something the first
[1:18:50] time
[1:18:52] it's perfect amen
[1:18:55] the way he did it the first time is the
[1:18:57] way
[1:18:58] amen was the perfect way amen he didn't
[1:19:02] have to go and prove
[1:19:03] improve on on his way amen
[1:19:09] it's always perfect
[1:19:12] the woman was meant
[1:19:17] to come out of the man
[1:19:21] but since sin has entered in to the
[1:19:24] earth we see
[1:19:25] that man has always
[1:19:28] come out of a woman
[1:19:32] contrary to god's original plan
[1:19:37] the bride is not supposed to come
[1:19:40] out of a woman which is the church
[1:19:44] but out of the man which is christ
[1:19:48] jesus amen
[1:19:51] the word of for each age
[1:19:55] that's where the bride come out of
[1:20:00] each age produces a bride
[1:20:04] a woman for that age
[1:20:07] and that woman bride came out of the
[1:20:09] word
[1:20:10] the man for that age
[1:20:14] so we see the first adam was put to
[1:20:17] sleep
[1:20:19] and his side was open and god
[1:20:22] formed eve from a part of adam
[1:20:27] and he presented to and he presented to
[1:20:29] her
[1:20:31] her to adam
[1:20:34] god was showing a prefigure
[1:20:38] how would put the second
[1:20:41] adam christ
[1:20:44] to sleep at calvary and
[1:20:47] open his side and for 2
[1:20:51] 000 years of seven church ages
[1:20:54] produce a second eve
[1:20:57] amen out of the
[1:21:01] of the word of god not out of the church
[1:21:05] but out of christ the man
[1:21:09] amen that is why we are
[1:21:12] part of him in bride
[1:21:16] for we are an extension of him
[1:21:20] amen we are born of his bone and
[1:21:23] flesh of his flesh
[1:21:26] so the story in the bible goes on in
[1:21:29] genesis that a woman in the eden
[1:21:32] and the story christ
[1:21:35] and his bride let me go back in
[1:21:38] and mention something we see in the
[1:21:41] beginning
[1:21:42] that it was adam and his bride eve
[1:21:47] in the beginning and it's going to wind
[1:21:50] up
[1:21:51] to christ and his bride in the
[1:21:54] millennium
[1:21:56] amen restoration
[1:21:59] amen the entire plan of redemption
[1:22:02] is to restore back what was lost
[1:22:07] the perfect condition again amen
[1:22:11] so if we look at this
[1:22:15] after eve was formed
[1:22:22] then she was taken to adam
[1:22:26] she came into his presence
[1:22:30] for the first time
[1:22:34] adam oh my i'm
[1:22:38] not so lonely anymore so
[1:22:42] by this time adam was awake
[1:22:45] and when she was first presented to adam
[1:22:50] she didn't know who he was
[1:22:55] she didn't know who she was
[1:22:59] she didn't know where they come from
[1:23:04] she didn't know where they was going
[1:23:07] but adam was in the image of god
[1:23:11] and before eve ever came he sat
[1:23:15] and spoke with god they had conversation
[1:23:18] in the evening so
[1:23:20] adam knew the will of god
[1:23:24] amen he had that knowledge he named all
[1:23:27] of the plants and the animals he had the
[1:23:29] mind of
[1:23:32] god
[1:23:35] but eve she didn't know nothing
[1:23:39] but she came into the presence
[1:23:43] of adam her husband
[1:23:47] by adam he knew
[1:23:50] all of those things in his great wisdom
[1:23:54] god had given him
[1:23:57] he began to reveal to eve
[1:24:01] who he was
[1:24:04] he began to reveal to eve
[1:24:08] who she was he began to reveal to eve
[1:24:14] where she had come from oh man
[1:24:18] you came from the real
[1:24:22] just under my heart you are part of me
[1:24:27] in me you dwelt in me
[1:24:31] you was taken out of me and
[1:24:34] formed to be my helpmate
[1:24:38] oh man she didn't know any of this
[1:24:41] but she came into the presence of adam
[1:24:45] and adam having the mind of god
[1:24:49] begin to reveal to her
[1:24:52] the secrets of his heart so that she
[1:24:56] can have an understanding of who she was
[1:25:00] who he was where they were going
[1:25:05] and where they come from she had to
[1:25:08] receive
[1:25:08] his mind in her
[1:25:12] by the word that she was receiving from
[1:25:15] him you see where i'm going
[1:25:19] in this day amen
[1:25:24] the mind of christ
[1:25:28] come down so this is what
[1:25:31] is going on right now because we have
[1:25:35] come into this same place again
[1:25:37] the second adam and the second eve
[1:25:40] because the bride of seven church ages
[1:25:43] is nearing completion
[1:25:45] she is coming to the headstone
[1:25:49] which is the word the mind of christ
[1:25:53] and so here we are and now at the stage
[1:25:57] where the mind of christ is being
[1:26:00] revealed
[1:26:01] to us by the word of the hour
[1:26:06] that is coming into us and revealing
[1:26:09] who we are where we come from
[1:26:15] where we are now and where we're going
[1:26:20] amen the mind of christ has come down to
[1:26:24] reveal to us
[1:26:26] who we are the power that lies within us
[1:26:32] amen to remove the philistines
[1:26:36] and those matters that that because of
[1:26:38] who we are
[1:26:40] no doubt adam said eve if you get a
[1:26:43] little cold just let me know
[1:26:45] i'll command the wind to blow a
[1:26:47] different direction
[1:26:50] if there's something i could tell that
[1:26:52] tree to get up and move out of your way
[1:26:57] we are all power there was no sin
[1:27:02] amen the second eve
[1:27:05] because we've taken on the mind of
[1:27:07] christ
[1:27:08] amen we know who we are we know where we
[1:27:11] come from
[1:27:13] amen amen
[1:27:17] you have the power you have the
[1:27:19] authority
[1:27:21] to speak to the mountain in your life
[1:27:24] because you know who you are
[1:27:28] amen the paradox of this age
[1:27:33] amen i'm sorry we look at this
[1:27:37] so insanity is a sickness of the mind
[1:27:42] but insanity in a person
[1:27:45] is not what you would always think
[1:27:50] a person can be an alcoholic
[1:27:54] but they call what we know of today as a
[1:27:56] functional
[1:27:58] alcoholic uh
[1:28:01] a person can be totally insane
[1:28:06] mentally totally insane amen
[1:28:09] but functional ted bundy
[1:28:16] was a smart individual
[1:28:20] he was able to blend on college campuses
[1:28:26] seems to be a well
[1:28:29] raised uh clean-cut
[1:28:32] and uh uh uh intelligent nice young man
[1:28:38] but he was totally insane
[1:28:43] totally insane we see
[1:28:47] hitler was a very prestigious man
[1:28:50] intelligent a man uh
[1:28:54] seemed to be a pillar of the community
[1:28:57] but was totally insane mind
[1:29:01] gone amen
[1:29:05] so we see that a person that we think
[1:29:08] about sometimes that's
[1:29:09] insane there's not always a person
[1:29:12] foaming at the mouth and
[1:29:14] talking to the trees and just you know
[1:29:18] nothing crazy
[1:29:22] what we think is normal god look at him
[1:29:23] say are you what's wrong with you
[1:29:27] you don't you're not going to church you
[1:29:31] you choose you insane
[1:29:34] now let's go on but the paradox at this
[1:29:36] age is this totally insane person can
[1:29:38] appear
[1:29:38] extremely normal and intelligent
[1:29:42] according to culture and lifestyle of
[1:29:44] today
[1:29:46] but yet be totally insane now here's
[1:29:49] that quote that i was referring to
[1:29:50] earlier
[1:29:51] now he said here in uh demonology
[1:29:54] physical realm
[1:29:55] uh paragraph 17. now
[1:29:58] there is demons that come into the soul
[1:30:01] of men
[1:30:02] and that is the phraseology
[1:30:05] that would be that would be in the
[1:30:09] uh i'd say this through
[1:30:12] the demon that comes into the soul
[1:30:15] is something that torments the soul
[1:30:19] how many know the word devil means
[1:30:21] tormentor
[1:30:22] many times you can see a person
[1:30:26] maybe of insanity now
[1:30:30] they may be yet a converted
[1:30:35] person filled
[1:30:38] with the holy spirit and
[1:30:41] yet be totally insane
[1:30:51] 1953-0608 paragraph 17.
[1:30:54] that's what the prophet said and yet be
[1:30:57] totally insane that's right
[1:30:59] that has nothing to do with the soul
[1:31:03] it's a tormentor something that torments
[1:31:06] them
[1:31:08] amen there's so many things that bring
[1:31:12] hurt to the mind
[1:31:15] amen so many things the spirits
[1:31:20] of this age how many know
[1:31:23] that you go to the grocery store
[1:31:26] and everything is concentrated you buy
[1:31:30] your
[1:31:31] dish detergent well you know my wife get
[1:31:34] on me i'm using it like it ain't
[1:31:35] concentrated
[1:31:36] she said no that's concentrated all you
[1:31:38] need is a couple drops
[1:31:41] it's concentrated everything is
[1:31:44] concentrated
[1:31:45] you know why because all of the demons
[1:31:50] down through time is concentrated
[1:31:54] in this day it's all
[1:31:57] concentrated so it ain't just one devil
[1:32:01] it's it's we got concentrated devils
[1:32:06] this is why we need our minds and hearts
[1:32:10] renewed
[1:32:11] regularly because we're living in
[1:32:14] a concentrated evil
[1:32:18] there's no way to get from from around
[1:32:20] it
[1:32:21] we're being tormented we're constantly
[1:32:25] bombarded
[1:32:26] with demonic thoughts and demonic
[1:32:29] amen uh uh uh pressure
[1:32:33] constantly
[1:32:38] what is causing the mental problems of
[1:32:40] this age is that we are
[1:32:41] almost as many
[1:32:44] faculties requiring the healing of the
[1:32:46] mind as the healing of the body
[1:32:49] you see mental in hospitals
[1:32:53] are not anew and everyone has all these
[1:32:55] different ones
[1:32:57] amen that's popping up all over the
[1:32:58] place
[1:33:00] the bible says revelation the third
[1:33:03] chapter 17 verse
[1:33:06] because thou says
[1:33:09] i am rich and increase with goods
[1:33:14] and have need of nothing
[1:33:18] no it's not that they are wretched
[1:33:23] miserable poor blind
[1:33:26] and naked because
[1:33:30] they are functional because they go to
[1:33:33] work
[1:33:34] every day and collect a good paycheck
[1:33:38] because they drive a nice car
[1:33:42] because they are uh astute members of
[1:33:46] the bridge club
[1:33:49] because they are stupid members of the
[1:33:52] church
[1:33:56] they have need of nothing
[1:33:59] but totally insane blind
[1:34:04] naked wretched miserable
[1:34:08] but don't know it going on in
[1:34:12] life thinking that they're all right
[1:34:16] but they are totally insane why because
[1:34:19] they are
[1:34:19] in their own the mind of that old man
[1:34:24] when the mind of christ in this age and
[1:34:26] this hour has come back
[1:34:28] let me tell you something unless you've
[1:34:29] got the mind of christ you ain't got no
[1:34:31] mind
[1:34:34] that old mind is going to lead you
[1:34:36] astray
[1:34:39] you must in this hour take on the mind
[1:34:42] of christ
[1:34:45] amen that is the only way that you're
[1:34:47] going to be restored back to the
[1:34:49] original
[1:34:51] let's take on his mind eve had to take
[1:34:53] on
[1:34:54] and she had to receive from the mind of
[1:34:57] adam
[1:34:58] and we have to receive our
[1:35:01] our everything who we are
[1:35:05] where are we going from the mind of
[1:35:07] christ in this hour
[1:35:10] because the thoughts of god is so
[1:35:12] different than the thoughts of this
[1:35:13] world
[1:35:14] amen that's how we end up getting caught
[1:35:17] up
[1:35:17] amen into these these different things
[1:35:22] god ain't concerned with this the stuff
[1:35:25] that's going on around here today
[1:35:28] the mind of christ the capstone has come
[1:35:30] back amen to unite with the body
[1:35:34] amen let's go on
[1:35:38] bear with me we look here
[1:35:45] then a certain in acts the 19th chapter
[1:35:48] 13 first
[1:35:49] then a certain of the vagabond jews
[1:35:53] the exorcists took upon them
[1:35:57] to call over which them which had evil
[1:36:00] spirits
[1:36:02] in the name of the lord jesus saying we
[1:36:04] adjure you
[1:36:06] by jesus who paul preached
[1:36:11] and there the seven sons of skeva
[1:36:15] a jew a chief of the priest
[1:36:19] which did so and the evil spirit
[1:36:22] answered and said
[1:36:24] jesus i know paul i
[1:36:27] know but who are ye
[1:36:31] and the man in whom the evil spirit
[1:36:34] leaked
[1:36:34] on him and overcame them
[1:36:39] and prevailed against them so that they
[1:36:42] fled out of the house naked
[1:36:47] and wounded
[1:36:50] nakedness is a result
[1:36:54] of an evil attack of the devil
[1:36:58] i'ma say it again nakedness
[1:37:03] is a result of
[1:37:06] an evil attack
[1:37:09] of the devil
[1:37:13] when you see
[1:37:16] i i almost said young girls but
[1:37:20] you see now young or it don't matter

[1:37:28] out there in the streets with your
[1:37:30] underneath garments on
[1:37:33] see we have to look through the mind of
[1:37:36] god
[1:37:37] you're looking through the eyes of some
[1:37:41] fashion devil you're looking through the
[1:37:44] eyes
[1:37:45] of some lustful designer
[1:37:50] and then the preacher tell you oh it's
[1:37:52] all right why
[1:37:53] cause he want to look at you
[1:37:57] oh it's all right if you wear that oh
[1:38:00] it's all right if you

[1:38:04] out with your
[1:38:04] tight soul and you it is and you
[1:38:09] nakedness is an attack
[1:38:14] from a devil
[1:38:19] and that devil has attacked your mind

[1:38:51] the way
[1:38:53] to eternal life and phil shall find it
[1:38:57] you have lost your everlasting mind
[1:39:02] and you need healing
[1:39:06] healing of the mind

[1:39:49] and they arrived at a country in
[1:39:51] gardenias
[1:39:53] which is over in gala against galilee
[1:39:57] and when he had went forth to land a

[1:40:35] this man had been attacked
[1:40:38] by the devil in his mind
[1:40:41] as a result of the attack
[1:40:44] he was naked
[1:40:50] then they went out to the sea
[1:40:54] the 35th verse when they went out to the
[1:40:57] sea
[1:40:58] what was done and came
[1:41:02] to jesus and found the man
[1:41:06] out of whom the devils were departed

[1:41:34] mind and take on the capstone which
[1:41:38] is the mind of christ

[1:41:45] manage by the that this mind our own
[1:41:49] thinking amen take on how do you take on
[1:41:52] the mind of christ
[1:41:55] amen you have to
[1:41:58] if eve took on the mind of adam by
[1:42:01] setting and receiving the words
[1:42:02] from adam and didn't doubt in her heart
[1:42:06] that what he was telling her was nothing
[1:42:09] but the truth
[1:42:12] as you hear the word of god faith cometh
[1:42:15] by hearing
[1:42:16] and hearing the word of god what are you
[1:42:18] doing you're taking on the mind of
[1:42:20] christ
[1:42:21] amen and as you take on the mind of
[1:42:24] christ you chase those devils off your
[1:42:26] land

[1:42:32] mountain that's in your way
[1:42:33] of getting to the promised land
[1:42:38] from that's keeping you from possessing
[1:42:40] everything that god
[1:42:42] gave you take on the mind of christ
[1:42:46] we see amnesia
[1:42:50] is a result of the effects of memory
[1:42:54] loss
[1:42:57] we find there are many different levels
[1:43:00] of amnesia
[1:43:02] amen we see
[1:43:06] amnesia affects the mind amen
[1:43:13] in many different ways in the message
[1:43:17] spiritual amnesia brother branham is
[1:43:20] referring to this problem
[1:43:23] at a level where like men are
[1:43:25] shell-shocked
[1:43:27] amen and they've forgotten
[1:43:30] who they were
[1:43:33] he's been so shocked by the horrors of
[1:43:37] war
[1:43:38] i want you to listen to me closely
[1:43:41] by the horrors of war in the heat of the
[1:43:45] battle
[1:43:47] bombs landing around them
[1:43:51] that it affects his mind
[1:43:55] he can no longer identify himself
[1:44:01] he forgets who he is and
[1:44:06] he doesn't know where he's going
[1:44:10] and that's a condition of many people
[1:44:15] spiritually in this age
[1:44:18] and so they need a healing
[1:44:22] in their mind many times
[1:44:26] in this christian journey we go through
[1:44:28] battles
[1:44:31] many times in this christian journey we
[1:44:33] go through
[1:44:34] uh um we go through really difficult
[1:44:39] battles within us maybe within our homes
[1:44:44] maybe within our church oh my
[1:44:49] i can remind that that that that in my
[1:44:51] christian journey
[1:44:53] oh my god i wish that i don't wish this
[1:44:55] battle on nobody

[1:45:48] there's a condition of the mind called
[1:45:50] amnesia
[1:45:51] they don't know who they are anymore

[1:45:58] i think one of those devils they talked
[1:46:01] about
[1:46:02] how they going back to the things that

[1:46:16] they are

[1:46:20] they do is go and
[1:46:21] cut their hair
[1:46:25] began to put on worldly clothes
[1:46:29] began to take off clothes
[1:46:33] they tormented by a devil
[1:46:36] tormented by a devil in their mind
[1:46:40] they need a healing
[1:46:43] not so much in the body but a healing in
[1:46:46] their minds
[1:46:48] they need something to happen to jar
[1:46:50] them
[1:46:52] can remember my own testimony
[1:46:56] the prophet talks about sometimes all it
[1:46:58] takes is getting them back into the
[1:47:00] a familiar atmosphere

[1:47:34] it
[1:47:36] i began to remember the things of
[1:47:39] that i always knew

[1:47:46] had to chase those philistines
[1:47:48] off my land i had to fall down on my
[1:47:52] knees and repent
[1:47:55] amen i began to chase those devils of my
[1:47:57] land
[1:47:58] to remove the mountain the obstacle that
[1:48:01] was in my way
[1:48:03] and it's still a battle every day
[1:48:06] amen we go through one mountain in there
[1:48:09] just to find out there's another one
[1:48:12] we chase out one mountain just to find
[1:48:14] out there's another
[1:48:17] we get around that mountain and that is
[1:48:19] another one
[1:48:21] the prophet said you're going to fight
[1:48:23] till you get out of here
[1:48:25] you're going to fight till you get out
[1:48:26] of here
