[15:10] wonderful name we pray amen amen praise
[15:14] the Lord God bless you I greet you in
[15:17] the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[15:19] Christ amen as brother Jack said I came
[15:22] in on Monday and uh just passing through
[15:27] amen so thought
[15:29] it'll be good to come thank you
[15:33] sir and
[15:36] uh just greet you amen and as preachers
[15:40] we only have one way to greet and that
[15:42] is to stand behind the
[15:44] pulpit amen and then uh we greet you
[15:47] amen praise the Lord um I know we don't
[15:51] have too much time so we just going to
[15:53] get straight into the word Mark chapter
[15:56] 10 um hope we going to do this in time
[16:01] Mark chap 10:
[16:02] 27 the scripture says and Jesus looking
[16:05] upon them saith with men it is
[16:08] impossible but not with God for With God
[16:13] all things it are
[16:16] possible I like that and then in the
[16:19] Book of Luke chapter 1 starting from
[16:21] verse 36 it says and behold thy cousin
[16:26] Elizabeth sheath conceived a son in a
[16:29] old age and this is the sixth month with
[16:32] her who was called baren for with God
[16:36] nothing shall be
[16:37] impossible and Mary said behold the
[16:40] handmade of the Lord be it unto me
[16:43] according to Thy word and the angel
[16:46] departed from her may God add his
[16:50] Blessing to the reading of his word we
[16:51] may be seated amen as we pray again
[16:55] father we thank you for the word we have
[16:58] read now your word we ask that you can
[17:00] give the unction in Jesus Christ's name
[17:03] amen amen I want to take um a title and
[17:08] I want to speak on prep to believe all
[17:13] things amen I trust that it will make
[17:16] some sense now that word prep comes from
[17:20] preparation when you go through a
[17:23] preparation process then we say you have
[17:26] been prepped all right isn't it yes sir
[17:28] and the inspiration comes from this
[17:31] quotation which is in the message
[17:33] preparation the prophet of God says you
[17:36] believe is the preparation time yes sir
[17:39] how many believe it's the preparation
[17:40] time it says notice it says don't notice
[17:44] don't notice your Edge don't notice the
[17:47] circumstances Faith Knows No ede Limit
[17:50] or
[17:51] circumstances Faith knows one thing God
[17:54] said so and that settles it where is our
[17:57] sister that plays the piano let us bow
[18:00] our heads a minute the great physician
[18:02] sister something come on my um heart
[18:05] then then the prophet says he begins to
[18:07] pray our heavenly father I thank thee
[18:11] tonight because we are leaving in the
[18:13] hour of preparation amen we are leaving
[18:17] when you are preparing the people to
[18:20] believe all
[18:22] things we believe that's the message of
[18:25] the day right the preparation time amen
[18:29] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[18:31] and forever and you are calling a people
[18:34] have give them the Holy Ghost and now
[18:37] you're trying to call out of that group
[18:40] of sons to adopt them amen
[18:43] amen now that's quite a striking
[18:47] statement yes sir we are leaving when
[18:49] you are preparing the people to believe
[18:52] all things amen we believe that's the
[18:55] message of the day the preparation time
[19:00] when I heard that listening to that
[19:02] seron it struck me glory and the prophet
[19:04] says here we are leaving at that time
[19:07] where we are being prepared to believe
[19:10] all things amen amen and that's the
[19:13] message of our day the preparation time
[19:17] amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[19:19] today and forever amen so it means that
[19:22] the message that we have in this day it
[19:24] is a message of preparation amen amen
[19:27] and it is preparing in us to believe all
[19:30] things amen sir Al as I say that's
[19:33] striking yes sir because you would think
[19:36] that the message of the hour is there to
[19:38] prepare us for the coming of the Lord
[19:40] all right and that's what will be
[19:41] palatable with us if we hear that the
[19:43] message is preparing us for the coming
[19:45] of the Lord it works right but when you
[19:48] say we are being prepared to believe all
[19:52] things and that's the message of the
[19:54] hour amen now that's striking amen we we
[19:59] know yes we are waiting for the second
[20:01] coming of the Lord amen and uh we we
[20:04] would be prepared for the coming of the
[20:06] Lord but in this quotation he's not
[20:08] talking just about that but he's saying
[20:10] that we are being prepared to believe
[20:13] all things yes sir now why are we being
[20:15] prepared to believe all things I believe
[20:18] the reason is because when it comes to
[20:20] this day there is a special requirement
[20:23] that God is looking for in a Believer he
[20:26] says in the Book of Luke chapter 18
[20:28] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[20:30] shall he find faith on the earth amen so
[20:34] we're not just being called to believe
[20:36] Jesus Christ we're not just being called
[20:38] for salvation we're not just being
[20:40] called you know to receive Christ and
[20:42] receive the Holy Ghost but they supposed
[20:44] to be a particular faith that comes in
[20:47] the end time Believers that is different
[20:50] from the ones that paor and them went
[20:52] through Glory why is it so because in
[20:55] our day we are required to have a
[20:57] rapturing Faith right amen that's right
[21:00] never before has there been a call for a
[21:02] Rapture right amen 1 Corinthians chapter
[21:05] 15 Paul speaking he says behold I show
[21:08] you a mystery we shall not all sleep but
[21:11] we shall all be changed now that was a
[21:14] scripture that was not for their day
[21:16] that was a scripture that is for our day
[21:18] Hallelujah in a moment in the twinkling
[21:21] of an eye at the last Trump for the
[21:23] trumpet shall sound and the dead shall
[21:25] be raised Incorruptible and we shall be
[21:28] changed
[21:29] and as I say this is a requirement that
[21:31] was there only for this age it is only
[21:34] for the end time believer down Through
[21:37] the Ages amen all they were required to
[21:40] do was to believe on the Lord Jesus
[21:42] Christ to believe on the resurrection to
[21:44] get themselves ready amen receive the
[21:47] Holy Ghost yes but they were all going
[21:49] by the way of death all right so they
[21:51] never had a requirement for a rapturing
[21:54] faith but now when it comes to this age
[21:57] we are required to have a rapturing
[21:59] faith and I want to believe that that
[22:01] rapturing faith it takes a believing in
[22:04] all things amen think about it that down
[22:08] Through the Ages people have struggled
[22:10] to believe even in the
[22:12] resurrection in the days of Paul you
[22:14] hear Paul saying that if some say that
[22:18] there is no Resurrection then we are
[22:20] found Liars so they were struggling with
[22:22] just the issue of Resurrection exactly
[22:25] right let alone with the issue of a
[22:26] Rapture right now in this day amen we
[22:31] are supposed to believe all things even
[22:34] unto the requirement of a Rapture yes
[22:37] amen we are not only just supposed to
[22:39] die come on but in a moment in the
[22:42] twinkling of an eye we supposed to be
[22:44] changed what a faith that is required in
[22:47] this day a faith that is able Amen to
[22:51] get this mortality to be consumed in
[22:53] immortality Hallelujah in a moment in a
[22:56] twinkling of an eye we shall be changed
[22:59] yes what a requirement of a faith that
[23:02] is now God knowing that we have such a
[23:05] challenge then God it's his duty to
[23:09] prepare us amen he then sends us a
[23:12] message of preparation and that
[23:14] preparation is for us to believe all
[23:17] things you see when God a man is
[23:20] demanding something that looks
[23:21] impossible then it is his duty to
[23:24] prepare the people and we can find that
[23:27] that is the pattern of God down through
[23:29] the Bible wherever God has something
[23:31] that looks impossible he just doesn't
[23:34] demand The Impossible but he prepares
[23:36] the people to be able to attain that
[23:40] impossibility that's why he says in the
[23:42] Book of Amos chapter 3 surely the Lord
[23:45] God will do nothing but he reveal his
[23:47] Secrets unto his servants the prophets
[23:51] he just doesn't come but he prepares the
[23:53] people that's a preparatory message is
[23:56] that right we also find it in Malachi
[23:58] chapter 3 behold I send my messenger and
[24:02] he shall prepare the way before me why
[24:06] was John the Baptist coming he was
[24:08] coming with a preparatory message to
[24:11] prep the people for the first coming of
[24:14] the Lord Jesus Christ so we can find
[24:17] that this is God's pattern whenever he's
[24:19] about to do something he prepares the
[24:22] people amen now that brings me to the
[24:24] story of Mary that I read here and I
[24:28] find that story quite amazing all right
[24:30] because in there I find a
[24:32] preparation and that is where my
[24:34] inspiration is centered on tonight
[24:37] Hallelujah and somebody say so where is
[24:39] this preparation in the story of Mary
[24:42] you see the story of Mary and the story
[24:44] of Zachariah it is quite an amazing
[24:47] story in the Bible all right we find in
[24:50] the Book of Luke chapter 1 the Bible
[24:52] says but the angel said unto him this
[24:55] was speaking to Zacharias fear not
[24:57] Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and
[25:01] thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son
[25:04] and thou shalt call his name John and
[25:06] Zachariah said unto the angel whereby
[25:09] shall I know this for I an old man and
[25:11] my wife well stricken in years all right
[25:14] now I want you to watch the scripture
[25:16] here he says fear not Zacharias for thy
[25:20] prayer is heard Amen in other words
[25:23] Zachariah was praying for a
[25:25] child they had been waiting for a child
[25:29] now they were old and well stricken in
[25:32] age amen but they were waiting for a
[25:35] child they were preparing they were
[25:37] praying for a child down through their
[25:39] marriage life they were expecting to
[25:42] have a child is that right that was
[25:45] their prayer right there and then the
[25:48] angel comes and he says Zachariah said
[25:51] unto and and he says Zacharias and
[25:54] Zachariah said unto the angel whereby
[25:56] shall I know this oh my so now the angel
[26:01] has said you are going to have this
[26:02] child and then Zachariah says how shall
[26:05] I know this seeing I'm now an old man
[26:08] and my wife is well stricken in Edge
[26:11] then we jump to verse 20 and verse 20
[26:13] says and behold Thou shalt be dumb and
[26:17] not able to speak until the day that
[26:20] these things shall be be shall be
[26:21] performed because thou believest not my
[26:24] words which shall be fulfilled in their
[26:27] season yes L that's quite amazing right
[26:31] there here is a man that was praying
[26:33] about this baby and the angel comes and
[26:36] he says your prayer has been heard the
[26:39] answer has now been has now been
[26:41] dispatched and right there Zariah then
[26:44] ask a question how shall I know these
[26:46] things
[26:47] wow wow and then Gabriel says because
[26:51] you have doubted my word we shall zip
[26:54] your
[26:55] mouth you will not be able to speak
[26:59] why because he should have sensed that
[27:01] there is a doubt that is behind this man
[27:05] he was asking a question but the
[27:07] question that was being asked was
[27:08] actually a question that was in doubt
[27:11] that's right amen and the angel say to
[27:13] Gabriel because of your doubt we don't
[27:16] want you to go preaching your doubt to
[27:18] your wife and Elizabeth will end up
[27:20] doubting what she's supposed to conceive
[27:22] so to stop that we're going to zip your
[27:25] mouth otherwise you preach the wrong
[27:27] things
[27:29] yes yes and you cause unbelief in the
[27:35] Family Faith cometh by hearing hearing
[27:39] by the word but unbelief also comes by
[27:42] hearing hearing the wrong type of a
[27:45] Preacher so God says we're not going to
[27:47] allow you to go preach the wrong things
[27:51] here and his mouth was zipped that's
[27:54] right but let's turn over and go to to
[27:56] to to to Mary's situation
[28:00] and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel
[28:03] was sent from God unto a seity of
[28:05] Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin
[28:08] exposed to a man whose name was Joseph
[28:10] of the House of David and the virgin's
[28:12] name was Mary and behold verse number 31
[28:16] and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy
[28:18] womb and bring forth a son and shall
[28:20] call his name Jesus verse 34 then said
[28:23] Mary unto the angel how shall this be
[28:27] seeing I know not a
[28:29] man now I want you to look at this too
[28:33] Zachariah asks a
[28:35] question and he told you shall be
[28:38] dumb Mary asks a question and instead of
[28:42] being told you shall be dumb the
[28:44] question is
[28:47] answered but both of them are asking a
[28:53] question God help us here Zachariah had
[28:56] been praying about this
[28:58] right but Mary was not praying about
[29:01] this that's right that's right I believe
[29:04] she was just living a holy life yes but
[29:07] Zachariah a man who was praying about
[29:10] this it shows that Zachariah was
[29:12] actually praying in
[29:15] doubt so you can be praying for
[29:17] something but yet you are praying in
[29:20] doubt that you're not even ready to
[29:22] receive the answer when it comes and
[29:25] when the answer then is delivered
[29:27] Zachariah begins to doubt the very
[29:29] answer and God's word is a deser of the
[29:31] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[29:33] and that is what was pronounced on
[29:35] Zechariah because of that doubt then God
[29:38] says your mouth shall be zipped but Mary
[29:41] asks a question and the question is not
[29:43] being asked in doubt amen amen amen God
[29:48] sees that this is a question that is
[29:50] being asked out of a genuine heart that
[29:52] is looking for clarity amen and then
[29:56] Gabriel gives the clarity vers ver
[29:58] number 35 and the angel answered and
[30:00] said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come
[30:03] upon thee and the power of the highest
[30:05] shall overshadow thee therefore also
[30:08] that Holy thing which shall be born of
[30:10] thee shall be called The Son of God
[30:13] Amen so an answer is given praise be to
[30:17] God and when the answer is given it is
[30:20] not only an answer but it is giv true
[30:22] Clarity unto Mary now I want you to
[30:25] watch with Mary what was being requested
[30:29] to do had never been done before exactly
[30:31] right never before had a virgin
[30:33] conceived that's right never before a
[30:36] man was a child born out of a virion
[30:39] right amen so because God is asking for
[30:41] something that has never been done he
[30:44] asking for the impossibility it is God's
[30:46] duty to prepare Mary
[30:50] Glory even in accordance to Amos chapter
[30:52] 3:7 God has to prepare that's right but
[30:56] when it comes to Zechariah Zechariah
[30:58] there were scriptural precedents of his
[31:00] case right there had been old people
[31:03] that had received children in the old
[31:05] days there was an Abraham and a Sarah
[31:08] they received a child in their old age
[31:11] there were people that were Barren that
[31:13] had received children there was a
[31:14] Rebecca there was a Rachel there was a
[31:17] Hana many other people that were in the
[31:19] olden days that had received children so
[31:22] with zachariah's case it was there in
[31:25] the Bible that's right but when it comes
[31:27] to case never before had it ever
[31:31] happened that somebody amen would be
[31:34] required to have a child when she's a
[31:37] virgin are you following me and because
[31:40] of that God had a duty to prepare Mary
[31:44] amen because it's a situation impossible
[31:48] so now we've got to get into the
[31:50] preparation how is Mary going to be
[31:54] prepared it's in the conversation praise
[31:57] God let's take it to verse 36 all right
[32:01] now verse 36 then says and
[32:04] behold thy cousin Elizabeth yes she had
[32:08] also conceived a son in her old age and
[32:12] this is the sixth month with ha who was
[32:15] called baren all right for with God
[32:19] nothing shall be
[32:22] impossible and Mary said behold the
[32:24] handmade of the Lord be it unto me
[32:27] according to Thy word and the angel
[32:29] departed from her right there I see a
[32:34] preparation and somebody says where is
[32:36] the preparation Preacher Man can we
[32:38] dissect the verse here yes sir yes sir
[32:40] look at what the scripture says the
[32:42] scripture says and behold thy cousin
[32:47] Elizabeth so the person that had a
[32:50] miracle that had been done was not just
[32:53] a sister but this was a sister who was a
[32:56] cousin to Mary
[32:59] so in other words when God wanted
[33:01] somebody Amen to to to conceive and
[33:04] bring forth this John it could not be
[33:06] any ordinary sister that was in Israel
[33:09] it not could be anyone that was not
[33:11] connected with Mary it had to be
[33:13] somebody that was a cousin of Mary yes
[33:17] so the situation of Elizabeth was a
[33:19] family story right everyone in the
[33:22] family they knew of the situation of
[33:25] Elizabeth they knew that this couple's
[33:27] Zachariah and Elizabeth who were priests
[33:30] in the temple who were living a faithful
[33:32] life who had done all they could but yet
[33:35] they had not had a child they' been
[33:38] praying about this and now they were old
[33:39] and well stricken in age and somehow in
[33:42] the family they should have written off
[33:44] that case but Zachariah continued to
[33:47] pray amen even in his old age though he
[33:50] was now doubting his own prayer but
[33:53] somehow it should have become a talk of
[33:55] the
[33:56] village It Should Have Become a talk of
[33:58] the family until everyone was talking
[34:01] about the case of Zachariah and
[34:02] Elizabeth to say how can an old man
[34:05] continue to believe in this how can this
[34:08] sister continue to believe this the
[34:10] situation was was well known within the
[34:13] family now God chooses somebody that is
[34:17] known within the family and that is the
[34:20] person and the candidate that God
[34:22] chooses to bring forth a John and then
[34:25] now the angel comes to Mary and says the
[34:28] Holy Ghost shall overshadow you
[34:31] situation impossible but before you
[34:33] begin to doubt let me prepare you and
[34:36] how am I going to prepare you let me
[34:38] tell you the news of what has happened
[34:41] already let me give you the testimony of
[34:44] sister
[34:45] Elizabeth and he says your cousin
[34:49] Elizabeth who was called Baron who the
[34:52] family has talked about that very one
[34:56] right now she has deed they were trying
[34:59] to hide the pregnant they did not want
[35:02] it known within the family but the angel
[35:04] came and disclosed the secret and he say
[35:07] something has happened in the house of
[35:10] Zachariah
[35:12] Hallelujah Mary should have been
[35:14] startled right there and Mary should
[35:16] have been saying what you mean Elizabeth
[35:19] my cousin the wife of Zachariah and
[35:22] Gabriel should have said that very one
[35:24] you mean to tell me that she is
[35:26] conceived yes is actually conceived now
[35:29] what you are saying to me is also an
[35:32] impossible situation but if God can do
[35:35] it for Elizabeth
[35:37] Hallelujah if God can do it for
[35:40] Elizabeth then the very same God he can
[35:43] do it for me as
[35:44] well and immediately the faith of Mary
[35:48] was boosted from zero and it hit
[35:52] 100% Mary was prad on the spot and
[35:56] watched the very next word that came out
[35:58] of the mouth of Mary Mary then said be
[36:01] it unto me according to Thy word I'm
[36:06] ready to believe it if it can happen to
[36:09] Elizabeth it can happen to me as well if
[36:12] the god of the impossibility can visit
[36:16] Zachariah oh Hallelujah he can surely
[36:20] visit me as well so Beed unto me
[36:23] according to Thy word hallelujah are you
[36:26] hearing this church
[36:28] are you hearing this church so let me
[36:31] say right here that
[36:33] Elizabeth was kept by God
[36:37] baren as an instrument to prepare
[36:40] [Applause]
[36:44] Mary oh did you hear what I said I said
[36:48] Elizabeth was kept Barren by God
[36:52] hallelujah so that she could be the
[36:55] vessel through which Mary would be
[36:58] prepared down Through the Ages they were
[37:01] praying a God was just in silent seeming
[37:04] as though he's not hearing the prayer
[37:06] because God knew I'm keeping Elizabeth
[37:10] to prepare a Mary Oh Glory to God in the
[37:14] eyes let me say God can allow you to go
[37:17] through a situation so that it can
[37:19] prepare you for something greater God
[37:22] can allow you to go through a situation
[37:24] so that he can prepare your sister's
[37:26] testimony
[37:28] so he can prepare a Brother's testimony
[37:30] are you hearing this church Mary
[37:34] Hallelujah God used Elizabeth to prepare
[37:37] Mary so that Mary would have the faith
[37:40] to be able to receive that which was
[37:43] supposed to come your way glory to God
[37:46] in the highest Hallelujah so Mary was
[37:50] prepared through the situation of
[37:53] Elizabeth but I look at Zachariah
[37:56] Zachariah God never gave him an on an
[37:58] ons spot preparation why because I
[38:01] believe that God wanted Zachariah to be
[38:04] prepared through the scriptures and the
[38:07] the me the messages that were being
[38:08] preached that's right that's right there
[38:10] was too much evidence that was behind if
[38:13] Zechariah was a student of the Bible you
[38:15] should have believed the word but with
[38:17] Mary this had never happened and because
[38:21] it had never happened Mary had to
[38:23] receive something that was special amen
[38:26] amen amen so God had to prepare Mary
[38:29] because her situation was
[38:32] impossible but not only that I also
[38:35] believe that Mary was special
[38:39] amen like I said Zachariah was praying
[38:42] about his situation right but Mary was
[38:44] not even praying that's exactly right
[38:46] she was just going on living a holy life
[38:49] doing what she's supposed to do every
[38:51] day she wasn't even thinking about the
[38:53] promise amen until maybe the very last
[38:56] days glory to God praise the Lord
[39:00] because the prophet of God says as they
[39:01] were walking with Joseph that's when
[39:03] they started to talk about it and they
[39:05] started referring to the scripture of
[39:07] Isaiah and he says if you want something
[39:10] to happen then begin to talk about it
[39:12] Hallelujah so they were now talking
[39:14] about it at the appointed time but you
[39:16] see over their life Mary never expected
[39:19] I believe that she was the chosen virgin
[39:22] Amen brother that's right there was
[39:24] nothing that was pointing to her that's
[39:26] right but what is it a am man that God
[39:28] God to come to Mary it was
[39:32] predestination she was the one that was
[39:34] predestinated of God to be able to bring
[39:37] that child am oh glory be to God and why
[39:41] was Mary the chosen one because she was
[39:45] favored amen of the
[39:47] Lord amen nothing else that we can talk
[39:50] about she was favored of the Lord until
[39:54] the scripture says and the angel came in
[39:56] unto him and say hail Mary Thou Art
[39:59] highly
[40:01] favored the Lord is with thee blessed
[40:04] art thou among women that's right there
[40:07] was no any other answer it was
[40:10] predestination it was the favor of God
[40:12] and because Mary was favored of God
[40:15] praise the Lord in the highest God could
[40:18] not allow Mary to
[40:21] fail with Zachariah God could allow
[40:24] Zachariah to fail but not with Mary
[40:28] Mary was special Mary was predestinated
[40:32] Mary had the favor of God and because
[40:34] she was she was predestinated and at the
[40:37] favor of God it was God's responsibility
[40:40] to make sure that Mary does not
[40:44] fail and somebody says but why it is
[40:47] just because of favor and you know there
[40:50] is something about favor favor ain't
[40:55] Fair it ain't Fair
[40:58] but praise God I'm on the side of the
[41:00] favor praise God you are the favored
[41:04] Hallelujah others might cry foul others
[41:08] might say it's not fair it's not fair
[41:10] okay it is not fair but praise God I
[41:13] have the favor of God
[41:16] hallelujah so Mary was favored but
[41:19] brother Mary he begins to tell me of
[41:22] Another
[41:23] Woman She's a type of another woman that
[41:26] is the bride of Jesus Christ in this day
[41:29] I'm looking at here tonight and I want
[41:31] to say Hail Bride of Jesus Thou Art
[41:35] favored among all women oh Hail Bride of
[41:39] Jesus Christ Thou Art highly favored oh
[41:43] do you believe it tonight do you believe
[41:46] it tonight the favor of God is with you
[41:49] why are you here tonight the Holy Ghost
[41:52] LED you here because God had a message
[41:55] for you and the message for you to
[41:57] tonight is you are the favor of the Lord
[42:00] favor ain't fair and because you are the
[42:04] favor of the Lord then God sends a
[42:06] message to prepare you to believe all
[42:11] things you are predestinated not to fail
[42:15] it is God's responsibility to make sure
[42:17] that you will not fail and I'm here to
[42:20] announce to you that this bride will not
[42:23] fail this bride is going to make it into
[42:26] the rapture whether the devil likes it
[42:28] or he does not like it but we're going
[42:30] to make it into the Rapture because it's
[42:32] not even our own making it is God's
[42:35] choosing can you say Amen we going to
[42:38] make it into the
[42:40] Rapture for with God the scripture says
[42:43] with God nothing shall be impossible I'm
[42:48] on Luke
[42:49] 137 Hallelujah for with God nothing
[42:54] shall be impossible amen how many
[42:57] believe it
[42:58] tonight glory to God in the highest
[43:01] brother when Mary heard these words that
[43:04] with God nothing shall be impossible as
[43:06] a student of the word scriptures should
[43:09] have started to run through Mary's mind
[43:11] connecting one verse to another and Mary
[43:14] should have started to think of another
[43:16] character Abraham and
[43:19] Sarah and he says with Abraham and Sarah
[43:22] God waited amen until there were 75 and
[43:26] 65 years to give them the promise and
[43:29] then after giving them the promise God
[43:32] then had to wait again for another 24
[43:35] years before he came to visit them amen
[43:39] and then 25 years for them to receive
[43:42] the
[43:43] child but the scripture says amen is
[43:47] anything too hard for the
[43:50] Lord Mary should have started thinking
[43:52] about all these things to say if God
[43:54] could come to Father Abraham father
[43:57] Abraham he had to receive a preparation
[44:00] right think about a church God had
[44:02] called him to do the impossible yes to
[44:05] receive a child at an old age that's
[44:07] right 99 years when they were well
[44:10] stricken in age yes you know there are
[44:14] others that don't believe that these
[44:15] people's bodies were turned into young
[44:18] young
[44:20] children but if you think about it the
[44:22] scripture actually says they were well
[44:25] stricken in age that's right that's
[44:27] right amen that's right so what happened
[44:30] there should have been a change of a
[44:31] body
[44:32] somewhere praise God in the high God
[44:36] Amen he had to take that Father Abraham
[44:39] through that period And when God took
[44:42] Father Abraham through that period what
[44:44] why was God taking him through all that
[44:47] I believe it was because God was
[44:49] training Abraham to believe all things
[44:53] let me say tonight that the things that
[44:55] you go through in your life life it is
[44:57] maybe that God is training you to
[45:00] believe all things am amen got to have
[45:03] some rapturing Faith before the Rapture
[45:06] comes you see if you're going to do
[45:09] something amen there's got to be a
[45:11] preparation before you get to that which
[45:13] you are supposed to do Hallelujah
[45:16] there's a training period that everyone
[45:18] has to go through think of these Olympia
[45:21] we've just come out of the Olympics
[45:23] isn't it yes sir they take years and
[45:26] years preparing in 4 years amen they've
[45:29] just come back now they are starting to
[45:31] prepare for the next Olympics in 4
[45:33] years every day they are training and
[45:37] think about these guys that Run 100 m
[45:40] they train four years for an event that
[45:43] is less than 10
[45:48] seconds that's right I reminds me of the
[45:51] Bride of Jesus Christ God is preparing
[45:54] us all these years for an event that
[45:57] will happen in a moment in the twinkling
[46:00] of an
[46:01] eye Oh Glory to God but we got to be
[46:05] prepared for that
[46:07] event so it's worth all the training
[46:10] it's worth all the suffering it's worth
[46:13] everything that we got to go through
[46:15] Hallelujah because when we shall make it
[46:17] into the Rapture it shall all be well
[46:21] for these Olympians amen when they put
[46:24] on the gold medal and is hanging on
[46:26] their necks they say it was worth it I
[46:29] feel I can do it again but brother they
[46:31] are doing it to obtain a medal of this
[46:34] Earth but you and I we are doing it to
[46:37] step into the
[46:39] Rapture to get into eternal life is it
[46:43] not worth coming to church on a
[46:44] Wednesday is it not worth coming to
[46:47] church every Sunday is it not worth
[46:49] listening to tape after tape is it not
[46:52] worth praying every day of the hour why
[46:55] it's a preparatory me message we need it
[46:58] Church
[47:00] Hallelujah so Abraham amen he had to go
[47:04] through this training and God came and
[47:06] he said is anything too hard for the
[47:09] Lord so now when God had prepared
[47:12] Abraham Hallelujah he now came to a
[47:15] place where he realized that all things
[47:17] amen are possible with God Mark chapter
[47:22] 10 tells me Jesus looking upon them say
[47:25] with man it is impossible but not with
[47:27] God for With God all things are possible
[47:32] and that's exactly the same words that
[47:34] he said to Father Abraham amen with with
[47:37] is anything too hard for the Lord and
[47:40] then in Mark 10 it says With God all
[47:43] things are possible God hallelujah amen
[47:47] the prophet of God says you believe is
[47:50] the preparation time don't you notice
[47:53] your he says don't notice don't notice
[47:55] your age don't notice the circumstances
[47:58] Faith knows no age limit or
[48:01] circumstances amen you know time is
[48:04] always our greatest problem I've been
[48:07] waiting for this I've been waiting for
[48:09] this I've been praying for this I've
[48:10] been praying for this
[48:13] wait they that wait upon the Lord hallu
[48:17] they shall renew their strength they
[48:19] shall Mount up with wings as
[48:22] Eagles Abraham had to wait for 25 years
[48:26] but after waiting for 25 years brother
[48:28] the journey was sweet when it now came
[48:32] to the victory time prise God it is
[48:34] always when you get to your victory that
[48:36] is where you now realize the sweetness
[48:39] of what you have had to go through with
[48:41] Abraham amen after that remember now
[48:45] he's walking in a new
[48:47] body as a young man looking at a
[48:51] beautiful young woman 90 years old but
[48:54] looking like 21
[48:57] now you talk about somebody that can
[48:59] believe all things there's just no way
[49:01] for Abraham after the body change to
[49:04] doubt anything that's right that's right
[49:07] that's right it's
[49:08] impossible because if he looks at Sarah
[49:11] and he thinks about what Sarah was two
[49:13] years ago and is looking at the miracle
[49:15] of God just that Miracle alone it is
[49:18] good enough to say if God demands
[49:21] anything of me I'm ready to accept it he
[49:24] can do it praise God hallelujah
[49:27] that's why when he was now going to
[49:29] sacrifice Isaac when God said to him go
[49:32] take your son Isaac your only son and go
[49:34] and sacrifice he didn't have a problem
[49:37] with it why did he not have a problem
[49:39] with it because he knew that God can do
[49:42] anything he had been preed to to believe
[49:44] all things amen so Abraham is asked by
[49:47] the young man he says to the young man
[49:50] as is now going up the mountain he says
[49:52] abide ye here with the US I and the Lord
[49:55] will go Y and worship and come again to
[49:59] you how do you know you're coming back
[50:02] I've been preped to believe all things
[50:05] my God is able to do anything oh glory
[50:08] to God in the highest brother when God
[50:11] has prepared you when God has taken you
[50:13] through certain situations you get to a
[50:15] place where you know that I can believe
[50:18] all
[50:19] things it says if God says slay your son
[50:23] he that gave me that son in my old age
[50:27] is more than able to resurrect that son
[50:30] if he ask me to take him and sacrifice
[50:32] him I know he can replace the son in an
[50:35] instant so though I can kill him but
[50:38] before I leave the mountain he would
[50:39] have resurrected him and I'll take him
[50:41] with me how do you know it is going to
[50:44] happen With God all things are possible
[50:47] or I don't know whom I'm preaching to
[50:49] tonight you might be going through a
[50:51] situation that looks impossible but you
[50:53] are being trained to believe in the
[50:55] impossibilities that all things are
[50:58] possible when you go through that trial
[51:01] Oh Glory you will now have a faith
[51:05] muscle that can face anything in your
[51:08] life with Abraham he was well prepared
[51:12] Hallelujah Genesis chapter 22 and Isaac
[51:15] SP unto Abraham his father and he says
[51:17] my father and he says here am I my son
[51:20] and he said behold the fire and the hood
[51:22] but where is the lamp for a bent
[51:24] offering and Abraham said my son God
[51:27] will provide himself a lamb for a band
[51:30] offering when you getting these words
[51:32] from Father Abraham I've been prepared
[51:35] to believe all
[51:37] things God can
[51:39] provide he will provide himself a
[51:43] sacrifice Hallelujah I don't know whom
[51:46] I'm preaching to tonight but I want to
[51:48] say that same Jehovah gy he's still here
[51:52] he can provide anything whatever your
[51:55] hearts desire
[51:57] it is not too deep for God to be a not
[52:00] to be able to touch it it is within his
[52:03] reach can you say Amen somebody
[52:05] hallelujah
[52:06] hallelujah God is more than
[52:09] able the prophet of God says it was a
[52:12] real Ram that then God Abraham saw
[52:16] caught in that Thicket where did it come
[52:18] from Jehovah gy had provided that Ram
[52:22] God spoke it into existence in one
[52:24] minute and it went out of existence in
[52:26] another minute for God is able to do
[52:28] anything that he desires to do I believe
[52:33] that our God is able to do anything
[52:35] praise God hallelujah conscious of our
[52:38] time we got to jump some things here but
[52:41] let me come to our day you see down
[52:44] through the Bible we see that there were
[52:46] certain things that were happening God
[52:48] preparing a people now we have read this
[52:51] quotation where the prophet of God says
[52:54] we are leaving when you are preparing
[52:56] the people to believe all things yes yes
[53:00] we believe that's the message of the day
[53:02] the preparation time Jesus Christ the
[53:05] same yesterday today and forever so this
[53:08] message is about a preparation yes sir
[53:11] and that's why this message came packed
[53:14] with the supernatural that's exactly
[53:16] right Hallelujah why did it have such a
[53:19] supernatural element so that we when we
[53:21] begin to hear that message remember Mary
[53:24] was prepared when she heard the miracle
[53:27] that happened to Elizabeth now with
[53:30] everything that we have heard in the
[53:32] message amen Faith cometh by hearing
[53:35] Romans chapter 10 hearing by the word
[53:39] and as we are hearing that word it is
[53:41] preparing us hallelujah to be able to
[53:44] believe all things and let me say God is
[53:48] not a respector of persons if he has
[53:50] done it for somebody he can do it for
[53:52] you as well
[53:55] Hallelujah what God has done before he
[53:58] can repeat the same thing amen so the
[54:01] things that you hear they are supposed
[54:03] to prepare you they are supposed Amen to
[54:06] push your faith to say if God has done
[54:08] it in the past where is that God glory
[54:13] that is like Gideon isn't it Gideon amen
[54:16] he had been hearing the word the word
[54:18] was preached to Gideon according to the
[54:21] Book of Judges chapter 6 one until amen
[54:24] when Gideon was now threshing we amen by
[54:28] when he was threshing Wheat by a wine
[54:30] press the angel came to him and when the
[54:33] angel came to him he says Thou Mighty
[54:36] Men of hell and Gideon started to ask
[54:38] and he says if God be with us then where
[54:41] Behold The Miracles that our fathers
[54:44] told us of Amen we have heard through
[54:47] the preaching of the word but where is
[54:49] that God is he a god of History he's got
[54:52] to be a living God Amen oh glory be to
[54:55] God he says where is that God of the
[54:58] Miracles brother when we hear what we
[55:00] hear on tap we must get to a place where
[55:03] we ask where is the god of brother Bram
[55:06] where is the god of the message of the
[55:08] hour I just don't want to believe in a
[55:10] message I want to see the effects of
[55:12] that message I don't want to believe in
[55:14] a God that ended in the spoken word I
[55:18] want the spoken word to become flesh in
[55:21] my day I want to see that very same God
[55:25] yes sir I don't want to leave on a
[55:27] second-handed Rob I want my own
[55:31] testimony we are living in a day where
[55:34] we have been prepared to believe all
[55:37] things yes the testimonies that come
[55:40] with this message they are just too much
[55:43] that's right brother I think of the
[55:44] testimony of
[55:46] geata bed reading for 9 years until she
[55:50] was reduced to just almost a skeleton on
[55:53] now but when she was in that state she
[55:55] came across some on William Branham and
[55:57] she said I want this man to pray for me
[56:00] amen and she had such a desire until the
[56:03] mother said she had gone hysterical and
[56:06] they said it is because of that man but
[56:08] praise be to God when when faith is
[56:11] reaching out there is a God that is
[56:14] ready to answer GL until the prophet in
[56:17] a vision he saw a lamb bleeding M Town M
[56:21] Town and then he knew I'm supposed to go
[56:23] to M toown when he went there then God
[56:26] led him to the house of Joi
[56:29] Cara he says God is going to heal Joi
[56:32] Cara says it's a situation impossible
[56:36] but God had visited that family the
[56:38] mother of joik was yet an unbeliever
[56:42] that's right he says that man is an
[56:44] impostor he's the one that has got my
[56:46] daughter to be in the situation that she
[56:48] is in I don't want to see that man but
[56:51] when she was in that state God knew that
[56:53] this woman must be predestinated for the
[56:57] miracle because when she was in that
[56:59] state then she saw a vision that's right
[57:02] God preparing her and what was the
[57:06] vision it was of brother Bram coming
[57:08] walking by Hallelujah and no sooner than
[57:11] the vision it ended then brother Bram
[57:14] walks past am exactly the man that she
[57:17] had seen and he steps into the building
[57:20] praise for little joat and little joat
[57:23] Rises up out of that bird Hallelujah
[57:27] and the prophet says there is no way I
[57:30] would have said to her rise up knowing
[57:32] that your legs were this thin there was
[57:35] no way that those legs could carry a
[57:37] body but brother when God visits it does
[57:40] not matter what the condition is it does
[57:43] not matter what the state is Joi rose up
[57:46] and she went outside and started
[57:49] blessing the
[57:51] grass that's the message of the hour I
[57:55] think of brother oh who the doctor had
[57:57] says he's going to jump overboard in 3
[58:00] days but when the vision came to the
[58:03] prophet the prophet of God says that man
[58:06] is going to leave and he called s there
[58:09] and he says hey that man that you said
[58:11] is going to jump over go board in three
[58:13] days he's going to leave glory and the
[58:16] doctor man says I would love to see that
[58:19] one how can it be he cannot leave
[58:22] without a lever wow and we can't replace
[58:25] the lever yeah and the prophet of God
[58:27] says you shall see
[58:31] it and he shall come and testify one day
[58:34] when the prophet was preaching then he
[58:36] says you see I was speaking about
[58:38] brother Hall and I see him somewhere at
[58:40] the back there do you want to testify
[58:42] brother Hall and he rises up from the
[58:45] back and he says Hey doctor the man that
[58:48] you said you want to see can you see him
[58:50] made the back
[58:52] there that's the god of the message of
[58:55] the hour
[58:56] [Applause]
[58:58] can you say Amen we know the story when
[59:00] he went to Finland that boy that had
[59:03] been mashed and dead and the prophet of
[59:05] God says if this boy is not willing up
[59:08] in three in five minutes then run me out
[59:10] of this place as a false prophet he went
[59:14] and he laid his hands on that boy and
[59:16] the boy came back to life on the spot
[59:19] that's the message of the hour why is it
[59:22] ped with the supernatural it is so that
[59:24] you and I can believe in the
[59:27] Supernatural so that you and I can
[59:30] believe in the
[59:32] impossibilities Oh Glory to God but
[59:35] whilst he was in Finland there was a
[59:37] case of another girl I like to read this
[59:40] one come on as we are winding up to
[59:42] close here I like to read this one and I
[59:45] want you to read your name into this
[59:47] quotation this little girl am man she
[59:50] was an orphan and the prophet of God
[59:53] says and I found out she was a little
[59:55] orful a little war often her father and
[59:58] mother was killed in the Russian war and
[1:00:00] looking at her I said oh sweetheart God
[1:00:03] bless your little heart I said you are
[1:00:05] healed but she couldn't understand what
[1:00:07] I was saying I know God would respect
[1:00:09] Faith like that I said you are healed
[1:00:12] honey and then them soldiers kept
[1:00:13] pushing me
[1:00:15] on you see the prophet was walking to go
[1:00:17] to the pulpit and as he was walking
[1:00:20] because it was city blocks amen blocked
[1:00:23] with people so he couldn't get right
[1:00:25] next to where he was supposed to be so
[1:00:27] he had to walk through these passages
[1:00:29] and then come through the L's toilets
[1:00:31] the doors were closed but as he was
[1:00:33] passing through then this little girl
[1:00:35] with her crashes then walks out of the
[1:00:37] room and comes to brother Branham and
[1:00:40] then brother Branham says I couldn't
[1:00:41] just help it I had to attend to that
[1:00:43] little girl and he says I love little
[1:00:46] children and then when he spoke to that
[1:00:48] girl he said little girl you are healed
[1:00:51] that's right amen but then she couldn't
[1:00:53] understand what the prophet was saying
[1:00:55] and remember she one leg that was
[1:00:56] shorter than the other so she was
[1:00:59] putting on a
[1:01:00] breast and then brother Branham went
[1:01:02] right straight to the pull pit left that
[1:01:04] girl but he had a burden in his heart to
[1:01:07] say I wish that girl could realize then
[1:01:10] the prayer line was going on and brother
[1:01:12] Bram was now getting tired but before he
[1:01:15] completely went out then something took
[1:01:18] place and the girl walked through and
[1:01:20] then brother Branham say to The
[1:01:21] Interpreter I want you to repeat these
[1:01:24] words after me just speak speak as I am
[1:01:27] speaking now let me read from here and
[1:01:29] he says by God's Great Providence I
[1:01:31] heard noise she was the next one to be
[1:01:34] on the platform I looked there and I
[1:01:36] tell you I never had such a feeling and
[1:01:39] here she come she was still crying I

[1:01:44] CAU my words repeat my words and I said
[1:01:46] God bless you honey you are the little
[1:01:48] girl that was out in the h a while ago

[1:01:54] already healed you sweet heart praise
[1:01:57] God I want to speak to somebody in
[1:02:00] here as I read your name into this

[1:02:16] but yet already healed amen glory to

[1:10:41] testimony amen amen right I'm ready to
[1:10:45] tell the testimony just just like the
[1:10:48] angel told Mary your your cousin your
[1:10:51] cousin she was called Baron but right
[1:10:55] now she is pregnant and been 6 months
[1:10:58] pregnant and like he said they might
[1:11:00] have been trying to hide it right
[1:11:02] because that you know according to
[1:11:04] scripture John wasn't even moving so
[1:11:05] there was a little concerned about this
[1:11:07] and and and and imagine cuz if um now
[1:11:10] John's not moving and imagine with the
[1:11:13] doubt that Zachariah
[1:11:15] had right with the doubt that he had how
[1:11:18] would he have responded right when his
[1:11:20] baby wasn't moving come on cuz God had
[1:11:24] to shut his mouth so he couldn't even
[1:11:27] talk couldn't say nothing and he
[1:11:29] probably got tired of writing everything
[1:11:32] down oh yeah right but but but when when
[1:11:36] when um Mary comes there and all this
[1:11:38] hiding right um uh but but when Mary
[1:11:42] comes there and and begins to tell
[1:11:44] Elizabeth now look I know cuz the angel
[1:11:47] told me that you pregnant well I wasn't
[1:11:48] trying to tell nobody that say well but
[1:11:51] but I'm also going to have a child wait
[1:11:52] a minute you and Joseph married no we're
[1:11:54] not married what you mean y'all not
[1:11:56] married how you going to have a baby and
[1:11:58] not be married married you know this is
[1:12:00] not good news he said well but the angel
[1:12:02] told me the same angel that told me
[1:12:03] about you told me I was going to have a
[1:12:05] child so what's the name of what's the
[1:12:07] name of the child the name going to be
[1:12:11] Jesus Elizabeth Elizabeth say say that
[1:12:14] name again
[1:12:18] Jesus John begin to move inside the womb
[1:12:22] and and and there was resurrection power
[1:12:24] in the name of Jesus
[1:12:29] Hallelujah and I just I just love that
[1:12:32] God's God is using God used Elizabeth's
[1:12:37] situation the barness for years the
[1:12:40] praying for years God used that to be
[1:12:43] Mary's
[1:12:45] encouragement see when you start
[1:12:47] thinking about things like that and and
[1:12:49] I as when brother brother GW said I I

[1:14:39] he spit the candy out and uh and the
[1:14:42] angel told him say you better eat that
[1:14:44] candy if you want the other boy to
