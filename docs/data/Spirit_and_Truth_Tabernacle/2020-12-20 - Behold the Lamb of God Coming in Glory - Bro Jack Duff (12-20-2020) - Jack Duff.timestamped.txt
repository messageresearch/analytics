[32:30] and just reading that scripture and
[32:32] seeing the challenges
[32:34] that were set right before right now
[32:37] actually i believe it's isaiah 54.
[32:42] maybe i'm wrong yes that's correct i'm
[32:46] sorry
[32:48] but when i got to reading this
[32:52] this chapter i i'm gonna start at the
[32:55] 13th verse
[32:57] and it was just a blessing to me it says
[33:00] and all thy children shall be taught of
[33:02] the lord
[33:03] [Music]
[33:05] and grace shall be the peace of thy
[33:09] and children shall thou be established
[33:13] thou shalt be far from oppression for
[33:16] thou shalt not
[33:16] fear and from terror for it shall not
[33:20] come near thee
[33:22] behold they shall surely gather together
[33:24] but not by me
[33:26] whosoever shall gather together against
[33:28] thee shall fall for thy sake
[33:31] behold i have created the smith that
[33:33] bloweth the coals in the fire
[33:36] and that bringeth forth an instrument
[33:38] for his work
[33:39] and i have created the waster to destroy
[33:43] no weapon that is formed against thee
[33:45] shall prosper
[33:46] and every tongue that shall rise against
[33:48] thee in judgment thou shalt condemn

[33:53] the lord
[33:54] and their righteousness is of me said

[56:32] uh also just last month wanted to just
[56:36] share
[56:36] the lord has also blessed us to uh have
[56:39] this pantry
[56:40] and uh as i as we go to the pantry uh
[56:44] this week you know just kind of struck
[56:46] me this is a place that god has given
[56:49] us to be able to do multiple
[56:53] outreach things and you all know that we
[56:56] do a back to school um
[56:58] uh giveaway and things of that nature
[57:01] and um you know so we're gonna be doing
[57:04] the back to school giveaway
[57:05] there when we do backpacks there's
[57:07] enough kids in the neighborhood for us
[57:08] to serve those kids
[57:10] right the other thing you know when as
[57:12] as we're you know preparing the food to
[57:14] give to the families
[57:16] uh sister ralon uh the daughter of the
[57:19] house
[57:20] a man she lives there in uh north
[57:22] carolina now but she's still a daughter
[57:24] this house and
[57:25] sister roland has this gift of
[57:27] witnessing
[57:29] not only witnessing but she puts
[57:31] together uh things like this she designs
[57:33] the cards and she puts different things
[57:35] on it
[57:35] uh just to encourage people with
[57:37] scripture and uh so
[57:39] with her gift like that you know she she
[57:42] she takes she'll take something like
[57:43] this she'll
[57:44] she'll uh design it and then she'll
[57:46] print it out herself
[57:48] and then she'll send it here to the
[57:49] church first pay for it print it out pay
[57:51] for it send it to the church
[57:53] and all we got to do is take it and put
[57:54] it in a box so every time somebody gets
[57:57] something
[57:57] you know um you know just a box of
[58:00] something there's also a message of hope
[58:02] going inside that box
[58:04] praise the lord
[58:07] [Applause]
[58:09] and uh there is you know there's uh
[58:12] other people that are finding out what
[58:14] we're doing outside of the church and
[58:16] they're saying
[58:16] tell us when we did this turkey giveaway
[58:19] you know
[58:20] they said you should have told us
[58:21] because we would have wanted to give the
[58:22] turkeys
[58:23] right and i'm like you know the lord
[58:24] just kind of seemed like god got his
[58:26] hand on this
[58:27] right and uh and and as as we just get
[58:30] involved and we do what the lord called
[58:31] us to do then god will do everything
[58:33] else so
[58:34] i'm gonna be certainly coming and just
[58:35] letting the church know what is going on
[58:37] because um
[58:38] uh you know we we even our like
[58:41] typically we do christmas giveaways
[58:43] and um you know and this year we didn't
[58:45] do it because we did the turkeys but you
[58:47] know we may have to
[58:48] modify that a little bit i heard of
[58:50] somebody that come through the line and
[58:52] amen and had a little need just to get
[58:54] some gas
[58:55] and uh my wife had told me you know
[58:57] about it i said oh i wish i would have
[58:59] told me right there
[59:00] i would have i would have took some
[59:01] money out of my pocket and gave it to
[59:03] the person
[59:04] right there right down the spot uh but
[59:06] uh the lord just led me to
[59:08] give a little christmas card and i did
[59:11] that
[59:12] and uh you know we have a way to impact
[59:14] lives
[59:15] um you know and you never know when
[59:17] people are hurting and
[59:19] and need hope you have a way to offer
[59:21] them some hope
[59:22] right just through your actions you
[59:24] offer hope to the people
[59:26] and and and ultimately what we're
[59:28] looking for is that these people be
[59:30] sensitive enough to the spirit of god to
[59:32] want to come to church
[59:33] amen if we only get one it's worth it
[59:37] all
[59:38] right praise the lord if we only get one
[59:40] it's worth it all so
[59:42] i want to encourage you church let's
[59:43] continue to do what we're doing for the
[59:45] lord
[59:45] i know the lord will bless us last month
[59:47] we um
[59:49] we gave out 170 boxes of food
[59:52] uh 47 turkeys and we served
[59:55] it looked like we served 500 individuals
[59:58] last month amen
[1:00:00] from the food pantry praise god
[1:00:06] praise god so uh you know what we're
[1:00:09] doing matters

[1:01:57] that god will give us deliverance amen
[1:02:00] all right uh y'all just bear with me
[1:02:04] amen all right let's um
[1:02:08] i think i got everything out of the way

[1:02:12] of god musicians thank you all so much
[1:02:14] we appreciate
[1:02:15] you and amen and those that are joining
[1:02:17] us online god bless you so good to have
[1:02:19] you
[1:02:20] forgive us for the time that we're
[1:02:21] taking today but we haven't been in
[1:02:23] church together for roughly two weeks
[1:02:26] and uh we miss each other we miss
[1:02:29] each other just miss coming and and
[1:02:31] fellowshipping together so
[1:02:33] so good to be back in the house of god
[1:02:36] amen i want to read
[1:02:40] um a couple scriptures here
[1:02:45] and this is um somewhat lengthy
[1:02:48] uh and i want to just maybe um
[1:02:51] maybe i'll read one i'll let you be
[1:02:53] seated and i'll pick up the other one
[1:02:55] uh but uh
[1:02:58] we uh want to turn to john three
[1:03:02] verse 26 through 30
[1:03:06] and i think i have to go back to john 1
[1:03:08] as well and just read
[1:03:09] a portion of that um
[1:03:13] we we read this red drum one just a
[1:03:15] couple weeks ago but i think it's going
[1:03:17] to connect
[1:03:18] with what we have to share today
[1:03:21] uh it will connect john 3
[1:03:24] verse 26 through 30 reads
[1:03:28] as follows it says and they came
[1:03:31] unto john said unto him rabbi
[1:03:35] he that was with thee beyond jordan
[1:03:38] uh to whom thou barest witness behold
[1:03:41] the same
[1:03:42] baptizeth and all men come to him
[1:03:45] now um what we see
[1:03:48] in this portion of scripture is
[1:03:52] um someone is actually trying to bring
[1:03:57] uh the spirit of division
[1:04:00] into the church and they want to divide
[1:04:04] over baptism
[1:04:05] now we see you baptizing but the one
[1:04:08] that you baptize not baptizing more
[1:04:09] people than you
[1:04:11] right so you know they want to bring
[1:04:13] division they want to bring
[1:04:14] competition into the church and uh and
[1:04:17] the church is not built on that
[1:04:19] right that that's the devil that does
[1:04:20] that he divides and conquers but
[1:04:23] we don't want to allow the enemy you
[1:04:24] know to to get any glory
[1:04:27] amen and and that so uh watch this
[1:04:29] spirit
[1:04:30] watch how people talk amen even in the
[1:04:32] church watch how people talk
[1:04:34] what is your motive for saying what
[1:04:35] you're saying come on church
[1:04:38] hey man why why are you saying that what
[1:04:40] are you trying to build up here
[1:04:41] amen we all together in this thing
[1:04:45] all right so so here you know um
[1:04:48] verse 27 says john answered and said
[1:04:51] a man can receive nothing except to be
[1:04:53] given him from heaven
[1:04:55] right we can't do anything lest god give
[1:04:56] it to us uh and he says
[1:04:59] you ye yourselves bear me witness that i
[1:05:02] said i
[1:05:02] am not the christ but that i am
[1:05:06] sent before him he that hath the bride
[1:05:10] is the bridegroom but the friend
[1:05:13] of the bright groom which standeth and
[1:05:16] heareth him
[1:05:17] rejoices greatly because of the bright
[1:05:19] groom
[1:05:20] because of the the bridegroom's voice
[1:05:23] this my
[1:05:24] joy therefore is fulfilled
[1:05:27] he must increase but i must
[1:05:30] decrease amen i'm just picking up over
[1:05:33] here
[1:05:34] in john 1 um
[1:05:38] i don't want to read all of that what
[1:05:40] i've had what i had here
[1:05:41] started verse 19 but let me just kind of
[1:05:44] um
[1:05:44] slip down i think um let's let's skip to
[1:05:48] verse 26
[1:05:50] uh verse 25 it says um and they asked
[1:05:53] him and said unto him
[1:05:55] why baptize us thou then if thou be not
[1:05:58] that christ nor elijah not neither that
[1:06:00] prophet
[1:06:01] john answered them saying i baptized
[1:06:04] with water
[1:06:05] but there standeth one among you whom ye
[1:06:07] know not
[1:06:09] he it is who is who coming after me is
[1:06:12] preferred before me whose shoes
[1:06:15] latch it i'm not worthy to lose these
[1:06:18] things were done
[1:06:19] in in beth bethabara beyond jordan where
[1:06:22] john was baptized in
[1:06:24] the next day he said the next day john
[1:06:28] see of jesus coming unto him and saith
[1:06:31] behold the lamb of god
[1:06:33] which taketh away the sin of the world
[1:06:36] this is he of whom i said after me
[1:06:39] cometh the man which is preferred before
[1:06:41] me
[1:06:41] for he was before me and i knew him not
[1:06:44] but that he should be made
[1:06:46] manifest to israel therefore am i come
[1:06:49] baptizing with water
[1:06:50] and john bear records saying i saw the
[1:06:53] spirit descending from heaven
[1:06:55] like a dove and an abode upon him and i
[1:06:58] knew him
[1:06:59] not but he that sent me to baptize
[1:07:02] with water the same said unto me upon
[1:07:05] whom thou shalt see
[1:07:07] the spirit descending and remaining on
[1:07:10] remaining on him the same as he was
[1:07:13] baptized
[1:07:14] with the holy ghost and i saw and bear
[1:07:16] record

[1:09:05] coming in glory
[1:09:07] as you saw there what we just read here
[1:09:10] in john 1
[1:09:11] uh john being the first forerunner
[1:09:15] he made this statement when he saw the
[1:09:17] lord jesus christ
[1:09:19] amen coming there after he was answering
[1:09:22] the questions of
[1:09:23] the uh the the religious leaders of that
[1:09:26] day
[1:09:26] uh pharisees answering their questions
[1:09:29] and and
[1:09:29] and then you know he uh he's after they
[1:09:32] come to church
[1:09:33] ask the question about you know john who
[1:09:35] are you we know you we got you got a
[1:09:37] very unique ministry
[1:09:38] uh we can see all the people are
[1:09:40] responding to it there's got to be
[1:09:42] something about you so they wanted to
[1:09:43] know they knew that certain scriptures
[1:09:45] were to be fulfilled
[1:09:46] and and they were watching john's
[1:09:48] ministry and they began to ask questions
[1:09:49] and
[1:09:50] and they're are you are you that prophet
[1:09:52] are you a liar so are you this you're
[1:09:54] like
[1:09:54] no no i'm not this i'm the voice of one
[1:09:56] crime in the wilderness
[1:09:57] you know and here he identifies himself
[1:10:00] in the scripture but yet they didn't
[1:10:01] want to believe
[1:10:02] that part right so uh so here john comes
[1:10:04] along and
[1:10:05] and and he says uh he's he says look i'm
[1:10:08] not he but he is standing
[1:10:10] in your midst amen the one that you're
[1:10:12] looking for the one that you're
[1:10:14] searching for the one that
[1:10:15] you you're looking to fulfill these
[1:10:17] scriptures i'm letting you
[1:10:18] know that man they went to a prophet the
[1:10:21] prophet told them
[1:10:22] that man that you're looking for is here
[1:10:26] now glory to god amen
[1:10:30] john the prophet identified that jesus
[1:10:32] was on the earth
[1:10:33] right then even though john himself
[1:10:35] didn't even know him can you believe
[1:10:37] that
[1:10:38] john didn't even know his own cousin was
[1:10:40] the fulfillment
[1:10:41] of this hallelujah to the lamb of god
[1:10:44] but but but as um you know as john told
[1:10:47] him this he says he's on the earth
[1:10:49] the very next day here comes jesus to
[1:10:52] church
[1:10:53] and he wants to be baptized of john and
[1:10:55] uh and john
[1:10:56] notices that as he sees the spirit of
[1:10:58] god descending
[1:11:00] and abiding on christ he knew this was
[1:11:02] the one this truly was the son of god
[1:11:05] so john screamed out to the people
[1:11:07] behold
[1:11:08] the lamb of god the first forerunner
[1:11:12] screamed out behold the lamb of god but
[1:11:15] our title
[1:11:16] today is behold the lamb of god coming
[1:11:20] in glory praise the lord stay with me
[1:11:23] here i want to just start reading from
[1:11:25] this message jesus christ the same
[1:11:27] yesterday today and forever
[1:11:29] and before um i i i i i go too
[1:11:32] too far let me just um back us up just a
[1:11:35] little bit
[1:11:37] amen this has been a wonderful year
[1:11:41] [Music]
[1:11:44] praise the lord hallelujah this
[1:11:47] has been a glorious year
[1:11:51] hallelujah church right you know so i i
[1:11:55] mean
[1:11:55] i was praying this morning i said i need
[1:11:57] to have an attitude of gratitude
[1:11:59] right forget about everything else that
[1:12:01] has happened i thank god for bringing me
[1:12:03] through this year
[1:12:05] amen and that hallelujah so much the
[1:12:07] lord has done for us
[1:12:09] you still got uh you still got food in
[1:12:11] your amen in your cupboards
[1:12:13] god has provided you got gas in your car
[1:12:17] god has provided you got a roof over
[1:12:19] your head god has provided
[1:12:22] amen they could not take your job god
[1:12:24] has provided
[1:12:27] this has been a glorious year amen so
[1:12:30] you know but as i as i begin to reflect
[1:12:33] on this year
[1:12:34] we started the year on a journey amen
[1:12:37] this being 2020
[1:12:39] we started a year on the journey of step
[1:12:42] into the vision
[1:12:43] amen and and we brought out how you know
[1:12:46] everybody got vision for all kind of
[1:12:48] things and god
[1:12:49] uh disrupted a lot of people's visions
[1:12:52] this year
[1:12:52] amen disrupting their visions now some
[1:12:55] people actually got
[1:12:56] new vision because of the disruptions
[1:12:59] come on somebody
[1:13:01] some people actually end up in a blessed
[1:13:03] position
[1:13:04] because of the disruptions right so so
[1:13:07] so we thank god that amen he had
[1:13:09] everything
[1:13:10] under control and he still does right so
[1:13:12] so you know
[1:13:13] we we started out the year saying step
[1:13:15] into the vision not just
[1:13:17] your own personal vision of your life
[1:13:19] and you know your personal vision for
[1:13:21] your business
[1:13:22] no but what is god's vision for me as an
[1:13:25] individual
[1:13:26] i want to step into that vision and what
[1:13:28] the lord showed us is that the vision
[1:13:31] that god had for us
[1:13:32] was where the prophet was told by the
[1:13:34] angel of god pick up your pen
[1:13:36] and write hallelujah and as we just
[1:13:40] begin to go
[1:13:40] paragraph by paragraph just trying to
[1:13:43] break that vision down
[1:13:45] get inspiration from each paragraph the
[1:13:47] lord has finally brought us to the last
[1:13:49] paragraph
[1:13:51] and we're closing out the year still
[1:13:54] stand step
[1:13:55] into the vision
[1:13:58] glory to god but in this last paragraph
[1:14:01] as we get to this
[1:14:02] you know we'll read this quote in a
[1:14:03] little bit if the lord would allow us
[1:14:05] but uh we're coming our inspiration of
[1:14:07] behold the lamb of god coming in glory
[1:14:10] is coming out of that paragraph we're
[1:14:12] still in
[1:14:13] the vision all right now let's pick up
[1:14:17] this message jesus christ
[1:14:19] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:14:22] uh here the prophet says we've had years
[1:14:25] now
[1:14:25] it says there hasn't been too much done
[1:14:28] but uh but i truly believe that we're
[1:14:32] entering into the greatest time this
[1:14:35] world
[1:14:36] has ever seen amen i'm saying amen to
[1:14:40] that
[1:14:40] they ain't seen nothing yet but we are
[1:14:44] entering into the greatest time that
[1:14:46] this world has ever seen
[1:14:48] i certainly believe that there there uh
[1:14:51] he said their comet there is coming a
[1:14:52] time
[1:14:53] and it's at hand now of god going to
[1:14:57] make himself
[1:14:58] manifested what
[1:15:01] hallelujah to the lamb of god it's at
[1:15:03] hand
[1:15:04] now where god is going to make himself
[1:15:07] manifested now you know church
[1:15:10] let us not take things for granted amen
[1:15:13] we um
[1:15:14] uh we come here a few weeks ago and the
[1:15:17] lord just began to show us how
[1:15:20] um you know david uh
[1:15:23] wrote he says uh uh uh i will
[1:15:26] enter his gates with thanksgiving in my
[1:15:29] heart
[1:15:30] and then i will enter his courts with
[1:15:32] praise
[1:15:33] and as the lord just begin to break that
[1:15:35] down say david as a king could only go
[1:15:38] as far as he out of court that was as
[1:15:40] far as he can go so when he came through
[1:15:42] the door with thanksgiving that was an
[1:15:44] attitude of gratitude
[1:15:46] but when he really began to think about
[1:15:48] what god had done for him danny
[1:15:50] entered into praise where you know and
[1:15:53] praise
[1:15:53] uh involves multiple things praise
[1:15:56] involves the clapping of the hands
[1:15:58] praise involves the raising of the voice
[1:16:02] praise involves just waving your hand
[1:16:04] like this sometimes
[1:16:05] praise will cause you to dance a little
[1:16:07] bit come on somebody
[1:16:09] praise when you just begin to think
[1:16:11] about how good god has been to you
[1:16:13] you can't help but give him praise
[1:16:17] praise record because of you to lift
[1:16:19] your voice and sing
[1:16:21] i will come into his house with singing
[1:16:24] praise god
[1:16:25] praise will do that for you right amen
[1:16:28] but see that's as far as david could go
[1:16:30] was he out of court
[1:16:32] amen but we know since jesus died
[1:16:35] that the temple veil was read from the
[1:16:37] top to the bottom
[1:16:38] and brother branham told us that before
[1:16:40] jesus death
[1:16:41] if any man went into that holy place a
[1:16:44] most holy place
[1:16:46] especially it was good as death if you
[1:16:47] went into that most holy place
[1:16:49] he says but now since jesus died if you
[1:16:52] stay
[1:16:53] out of the most holy place you'll die
[1:16:56] praise god so so when we got to that we
[1:16:59] realized that god we want to go beyond
[1:17:01] just
[1:17:01] entering the gates with thanksgiving we
[1:17:04] want to go beyond just
[1:17:05] entering the course with praise and what
[1:17:07] we found brother branham said god will
[1:17:09] take you

[1:18:48] there then we came into the world and we
[1:18:50] go
[1:18:51] out of the world back into the unknown
[1:18:53] to us now

[1:19:34] contentment
[1:19:36] it's the earnest of our salvation that
[1:19:38] we have now
[1:19:39] as a golden inheritance praise the lord
[1:19:42] let me go on a little further here
[1:19:44] amen this is coming out of the sermon uh
[1:19:46] trying to do god a service without it
[1:19:48] being god's will
[1:19:50] amen uh i'm reading from there paragraph
[1:19:53] 219
[1:19:54] it says now we find out glory to god
[1:19:58] that uh when these thoughts come uh stop
[1:20:01] uh when these stalks gathers
[1:20:03] come when when these thought gathers
[1:20:05] comes together
[1:20:07] they form their own idea and no matter
[1:20:09] when the new issue as they call it come
[1:20:11] forth out of the assemblies of god
[1:20:13] what did they do they couldn't receive
[1:20:15] it no matter how much truth it was
[1:20:18] the baptism in the name of jesus christ
[1:20:21] they were already the general counsel
[1:20:24] man had done took it over the spirit had
[1:20:27] done
[1:20:27] left them amen right and this come forth
[1:20:30] i've talked to some of your best leaders
[1:20:33] they say well what
[1:20:34] what uh well what would we do now they
[1:20:37] would embarrass themselves
[1:20:39] when they know it's the truth if they
[1:20:41] don't they're spiritually blind and
[1:20:43] ignorant to the bible not saying that
[1:20:45] nasty
[1:20:46] now saying that reverently because
[1:20:48] there's not a place in the bible
[1:20:51] where anybody was ever baptized using
[1:20:54] those titles
[1:20:55] look at this father son and holy ghost
[1:20:58] and never was used to the
[1:21:00] after the economical council the roman
[1:21:03] catholic church
[1:21:04] their own catechism witnesses the same
[1:21:06] thing
[1:21:07] it's a catholic dogma not a bible
[1:21:10] doctrine but a catholic dogma and you
[1:21:13] methodists brought out your catechisms
[1:21:15] and everything just like they had
[1:21:17] just gradually growing out of it and now
[1:21:20] when you come to pentecost
[1:21:22] and spread out some of those dogmas you
[1:21:24] still
[1:21:25] held on to them look at this and
[1:21:28] but now is the bride calling
[1:21:32] now is when the seven seals has been
[1:21:34] open now
[1:21:35] when the complete things that's the that
[1:21:37] the reformers left
[1:21:38] has to be open and only malachi 4
[1:21:42] can do that because it takes the
[1:21:44] revelation straight from god
[1:21:45] to an individual to do so that's right
[1:21:49] it can't come to a group never did
[1:21:52] one man that's what god promised in the
[1:21:54] shadows of the coming for his pride
[1:21:56] and eliezer see
[1:21:59] oh i love that see behold the lamb of
[1:22:02] god
[1:22:03] coming in glory now you know i i had
[1:22:06] that quote there
[1:22:07] and uh i was so blessed because brother
[1:22:09] troy just walked right up here on
[1:22:11] wednesday night
[1:22:12] and just walked right into my sermon i
[1:22:15] love when god does that
[1:22:17] i love when god does that it just
[1:22:19] vindicates where you're supposed to be
[1:22:21] and there were some things that you know
[1:22:22] he was just bringing out and
[1:22:24] and and i just want to kind of go back
[1:22:25] and hit this and
[1:22:27] in uh genesis 24. uh let's just kind of
[1:22:31] pick this up
[1:22:33] glory hallelujah thank you jesus
[1:22:37] now he says uh god was gonna sinner
[1:22:38] eliezer
[1:22:40] and what we realized is that brother
[1:22:42] branham's message
[1:22:43] brother branham's ministry was to be the
[1:22:46] eliezer
[1:22:47] and what his purpose was amen is to
[1:22:50] identify
[1:22:51] a bride a man to find a bride
[1:22:55] there was a time in brother branham's
[1:22:56] life where he kept having this dream of
[1:22:59] going back to the
[1:23:00] public service company he used to work
[1:23:02] for the public service company he
[1:23:04] kept having his dream of going back and
[1:23:05] he remembered some things that
[1:23:07] happened he remember uh paying for a
[1:23:09] breakfast and and maybe he didn't pay
[1:23:11] enough money for the breakfast and he
[1:23:12] just couldn't figure out why
[1:23:13] god kept bringing this dream wasn't
[1:23:16] something that he needed to make right
[1:23:17] and
[1:23:17] he just it just bothered him so much he
[1:23:20] began to pray and just seek the lord
[1:23:22] so finally one day he asked god uh for
[1:23:24] something
[1:23:25] he said god i asked for a vision you
[1:23:27] wouldn't give me a vision
[1:23:28] i asked for a dream you wouldn't give me
[1:23:30] a dream he says i'm gonna do something
[1:23:32] then and before he told the church
[1:23:34] what he did he told the church saying
[1:23:35] now don't do this don't do this
[1:23:38] he says but i i just needed something
[1:23:39] from god and it says uh he just closed
[1:23:42] his bible
[1:23:42] hallelujah it says god this this this
[1:23:46] this dream that keep coming and
[1:23:48] and i can't get the interpretation i
[1:23:49] don't know why you keep saying it
[1:23:51] if it's something i need to make right
[1:23:52] i'll make it right but god i just don't
[1:23:54] know what to do
[1:23:55] so lord i'm going to close my bible it
[1:23:57] says and when i
[1:23:58] open it hallelujah let me find a place
[1:24:01] somebody in scripture that i could
[1:24:03] identify with
[1:24:05] somebody that i can see myself in and
[1:24:08] say when i see
[1:24:09] that character in scripture then it will
[1:24:12] satisfy me then i know i got an answer
[1:24:15] to my dream
[1:24:16] hallelujah if you want an answer to your
[1:24:18] dream you better find it in the
[1:24:20] scripture

[1:24:36] just
[1:24:36] opened up the bible and when he opened
[1:24:38] up the bible here he landed on genesis
[1:24:41] chapter 24
[1:24:42] and when he saw the story of genesis 24
[1:24:45] he knew
[1:24:46] what his job was as a public servant

[1:28:04] his eldest servant of his house that
[1:28:07] ruled over all that he had
[1:28:09] he says put i pray thee thy hand under
[1:28:11] my my thigh
[1:28:12] and i will make the answer amen i'll
[1:28:15] make thee swear
[1:28:16] by the lord the god of heaven and the
[1:28:18] god of the earth that thou shalt not
[1:28:20] take a wife unto my son of the daughters
[1:28:23] of cain of
[1:28:24] the canaanites among whom i dwell
[1:28:27] now abraham can see how these people
[1:28:29] live abraham say i don't want my son
[1:28:31] marrying one of these women
[1:28:33] now look at this amen said no i don't
[1:28:34] want and and and i i might as well say
[1:28:37] this because
[1:28:38] i feel it's it's necessary our parents
[1:28:41] it's okay
[1:28:42] for you to tell your children no
[1:28:47] i'ma say it again it's okay for you to
[1:28:50] tell your children
[1:28:51] no no not that one
[1:28:55] it's okay to tell now if they go out and
[1:28:57] do it on their own that's on them
[1:28:59] praise the lord but it's okay for you to
[1:29:01] stand up
[1:29:02] and say no that ain't the one for you
[1:29:07] and someone said well i don't want my
[1:29:08] child to be upset with me no no no no
[1:29:10] it's okay
[1:29:11] if they get us upset they will get over
[1:29:15] it
[1:29:16] amen praise the lord amen
[1:29:19] abraham was very specific don't you give
[1:29:21] my son
[1:29:23] one of these women around here it's
[1:29:25] going to be trouble for him
[1:29:27] hallelujah to the lamb of god let's go
[1:29:30] on a little further in this
[1:29:31] he says verse 4 but thou shalt go
[1:29:35] unto my country and to my kindred
[1:29:38] and take a wife unto my son isaac
[1:29:41] hallelujah
[1:29:42] now look at eliezer says and the servant
[1:29:44] said unto him
[1:29:46] adventure the woman will not be willing
[1:29:48] to follow
[1:29:49] me until the land uh mo uh must i need
[1:29:52] to bring my son again into the land from
[1:29:54] west alcamus
[1:29:55] so he's saying this he says now if the
[1:29:57] if i go to try to find a wife for isaac
[1:30:00] and the woman won't follow me to this
[1:30:02] land because i'm i'm coming a long way
[1:30:04] how i know this lady gonna walk by faith
[1:30:08] come on somebody gonna trust me
[1:30:11] one man and maybe a few servants with
[1:30:14] him i know this lady gonna trust my
[1:30:16] story
[1:30:17] and come back with me he said he said he
[1:30:20] said now if she don't do it
[1:30:22] will i need to come and get isaac and
[1:30:24] then take isaac as
[1:30:25] proof this is what he's saying
[1:30:29] now look at abraham's response here in
[1:30:31] verse six glory to god
[1:30:33] and abraham said unto him beware that
[1:30:36] thou
[1:30:36] art thou that thou bring not my son this
[1:30:39] again i love that statement
[1:30:43] abraham is telling telling eliezer
[1:30:44] saying now look if the woman won't come
[1:30:47] we'll deal with that
[1:30:48] but one thing i want you to always
[1:30:50] remember eliza i'm
[1:30:51] old i'm well stricken and aged don't you
[1:30:53] ever praise god
[1:30:55] hallelujah to the lamb of god don't you
[1:30:58] ever take my boy down there to that land
[1:31:01] where he came from
[1:31:03] now abraham knew it was worse down there
[1:31:07] abraham had already come out of idolatry
[1:31:11] abraham had already been delivered so he
[1:31:13] did want his son to go down and get
[1:31:15] tangled up in that thing
[1:31:16] that he got got delivered from
[1:31:18] hallelujah that's why it's okay for you
[1:31:20] to tell your children no
[1:31:22] don't let them go get tangled up in the
[1:31:24] things that god has already delivered
[1:31:27] you from
[1:31:30] god look some careers you need to tell
[1:31:34] your children no
[1:31:37] every career is not of god
[1:31:40] the devil is sitting there waiting for
[1:31:42] them to get involved in some things
[1:31:44] hallelujah somebody amen it's okay to
[1:31:47] say no i don't think that's the will of
[1:31:48] god
[1:31:49] right no i i don't see that as god i
[1:31:51] don't see and sometimes people look at
[1:31:53] you and they think uh
[1:31:54] you're just so hard you're so no no no
[1:31:56] no i'm trying to keep you i'm trying to
[1:31:58] spare you from some trouble down the
[1:32:00] road
[1:32:00] you can't even see what the devil got
[1:32:02] got you set up for
[1:32:06] sometimes our youth only think about the
[1:32:08] money
[1:32:09] they don't think about the spiritual
[1:32:10] side of it you only think about the
[1:32:12] money you can have a big fat bank
[1:32:14] account
[1:32:15] but the bible asks you a question the
[1:32:18] bible got a question for you with a big
[1:32:20] fat bank account
[1:32:21] what does it profit
[1:32:26] the bible says what does it profit a man
[1:32:29] to gain this whole world and then
[1:32:32] lose his soul
[1:32:36] see i'm gonna watch over my soul before
[1:32:38] i watch over anything else
[1:32:41] amen i i i thank god you know i thank
[1:32:44] god for people that got conviction
[1:32:46] praise the lord i i thank god i mean
[1:32:49] everybody ain't got conviction
[1:32:51] you know i i'm just i'm gonna have to
[1:32:53] share this on one of my sisters i'm
[1:32:55] gonna call her name but i i must say i
[1:32:57] thank god for
[1:32:58] i've called at different times while
[1:32:59] she's been away and she's on her way to
[1:33:01] church
[1:33:04] i'm driving going to church trying to
[1:33:06] find the church wherever it's the city
[1:33:07] that she's going to
[1:33:08] i thank god for that type of conviction
[1:33:11] because i know some young people that
[1:33:12] don't think about church when they leave
[1:33:15] and then when they get back they don't
[1:33:16] forget about church
[1:33:20] that's why it's okay parents to say no
[1:33:25] i'ma say this um
[1:33:29] some of y'all want to be uh uh
[1:33:32] social media uh models
[1:33:37] social media models that's what you want
[1:33:38] to be i'm saying i'ma say this
[1:33:40] in the message you know brother branham
[1:33:42] had a brother that that was uh that he
[1:33:44] knew
[1:33:44] he said that the brother was approached
[1:33:46] by some uh
[1:33:47] organization they just want to take a
[1:33:49] picture of his daughter
[1:33:51] and put it on on front of something and
[1:33:53] the brother said no you will not take
[1:33:55] my daughter and and advertise her like
[1:33:58] that you won't do
[1:33:59] what the back then those people knew
[1:34:01] that there were spirits
[1:34:02] that was behind that stuff i know a
[1:34:05] pastor that had a daughter that wanted
[1:34:07] to be a model
[1:34:08] and the pastor couldn't get this thing
[1:34:10] out of her head couldn't get out of here
[1:34:12] so he told all he can tell us they say
[1:34:14] say dear what you need to do is set
[1:34:16] yourself some boundaries he says when
[1:34:18] you drive in a car
[1:34:19] you know especially when you're driving
[1:34:21] in the mountains they put a guard rail
[1:34:23] around the mountain
[1:34:24] that's to establish a boundary so you
[1:34:26] don't go off to go off the edge of the
[1:34:27] mountain
[1:34:28] so they put a guardrail saying what you
[1:34:30] need to do is put out your own
[1:34:31] guardrails
[1:34:32] how far are you going to go
[1:34:37] so that's all he could leave with her so
[1:34:39] one day while she was modeling
[1:34:41] praise the lord they uh they invited her
[1:34:43] to come to something and then
[1:34:45] and they uh they said now you're gonna
[1:34:46] walk the runway you're gonna walk with
[1:34:47] this dress on and you're gonna
[1:34:49] walk with this and next thing you know
[1:34:50] it got tighter and tighter
[1:34:52] shorter and shorter to eventually almost
[1:34:55] nothing
[1:34:56] and uh and when she got back from
[1:34:58] walking down the runway and should get
[1:34:59] back and see what the next thing they
[1:35:00] wanted her to go out
[1:35:02] she had a guardrail and she'd say i quit
[1:35:06] [Music]

[1:39:03] says uh
[1:39:04] uh from the land my kindred and were
[1:39:06] speaking to me and that swear unto me
[1:39:08] saying
[1:39:09] unto thy seed will i give the lamb he
[1:39:12] shall send his angels before thee
[1:39:14] and thou shalt take a wife unto my son
[1:39:17] from thence
[1:39:18] and if the woman will not be willing to

[1:39:41] environment
[1:39:43] now you know i mean uh uh let me just uh
[1:39:47] interject this had isaac ended up down
[1:39:50] there
[1:39:51] where uh where rebecca was it it's a
[1:39:54] possibility
[1:39:55] that isaac would have got connected with
[1:39:58] rebecca's brother
[1:40:02] y'all bible readers in here isaac could
[1:40:05] have got connected with rebecca's
[1:40:07] brother
[1:40:09] and rebecca's brother had a very strong
[1:40:11] influence oh y'all ain't gonna talk to
[1:40:13] me
[1:40:14] he had a he had a really bad influence
[1:40:17] praise the lord amen i mean and
[1:40:20] i mean sometime he blessed in the lord
[1:40:22] because when he heard about eliezer
[1:40:24] oh praise the god come on praise god i'm
[1:40:27] so glad to hear that you're here
[1:40:28] we got we got things worked out of the
[1:40:30] house come on down to the house oh my
[1:40:32] god
[1:40:33] and i'm glad elijah was the type of man
[1:40:35] that he was
[1:40:36] i don't want to stay here
[1:40:40] come on somebody preach back to me this
[1:40:44] morning

[1:40:48] with a purpose
[1:40:50] give me the pride i'm sharing my
[1:40:53] testimony will she go
[1:40:55] but you realize that daddy had nothing
[1:40:57] to say
[1:40:58] about whether rebecca was leaving or not
[1:41:01] according to the scriptures only two
[1:41:03] people speaking
[1:41:05] on rebecca's behalf until rebecca
[1:41:08] spoke for herself that was her mother
[1:41:11] and her brother and brother branham say
[1:41:13] the mother represent the church
[1:41:15] but the brother represent the preacher
[1:41:17] in the church
[1:41:20] come on somebody sometimes that's what
[1:41:23] you dealing with the church and the
[1:41:24] preacher in the church
[1:41:25] but rebecca you got to stand up on your
[1:41:28] own
[1:41:29] you can't let mama talk for you you
[1:41:31] can't let your brother talk for you
[1:41:33] you got to talk for yourself
[1:41:36] the question come to rebecca will you go
[1:41:41] the answer was yes i'll go here here
[1:41:44] here here her brother laban
[1:41:47] what we see about him you know is that
[1:41:49] he trying to delay the thing
[1:41:52] he tried to delay this testimony don't
[1:41:54] delay don't whatever you do don't delay
[1:41:56] when god speaks to you get in a hurry
[1:41:58] about what he's doing he tried to delay
[1:42:00] things but but
[1:42:01] laban got got something else in his mind
[1:42:05] how can we tell that how can we tell
[1:42:08] that
[1:42:09] because it comes out later in his life
[1:42:14] amen here comes jacob
[1:42:17] he ends up in laban's house amen
[1:42:21] and when jacob get down at a labor house
[1:42:24] he go through all kinds of trials with

[2:06:18] can you you got to see rebecca running
[2:06:21] to the well getting what dropping this
[2:06:23] picture down there
[2:06:25] getting getting the water out and then

[2:06:51] and rebecca didn't ask for no help
[2:06:56] rebecca can handle this on her own 200
[2:06:59] gallons
[2:07:00] very used to this can you imagine all

[2:07:48] you know oh come on church the reason
[2:07:51] that eliezer would help us because it
[2:07:53] was
[2:07:54] an answer to his prayer he got to see
[2:07:56] how she does things
[2:07:58] and by watching her and that instant he
[2:08:00] can see what type of character

[2:12:49] believe he will come this that is
[2:12:51] according to his word
[2:12:52] it will be at the end time which it is
[2:12:55] time now for to see
[2:12:57] uh he will be correctly dedicated to the
[2:12:59] word as they have
[2:13:00] always been indicated by god's word and
[2:13:03] vindicated
[2:13:05] god will vindicate what he preaches to
[2:13:07] be the truth and this is what
[2:13:08] you know uh the message he saw brother
[2:13:10] branham here's the angel actually saying
[2:13:12] this about
[2:13:13] brother branham's ministry brother
[2:13:14] branham didn't have to vindicate his
[2:13:16] ministry
[2:13:17] god did and i'm going to tell you
[2:13:19] something i don't have to vindicate
[2:13:20] brother brandon's ministry amen

[2:13:41] the word
[2:13:42] uh as they have always been indicated by
[2:13:44] god's word and vindicated
[2:13:45] god would vindicate what he preaches to
[2:13:48] be the truth
[2:13:49] as he did elijah for it is elijah coming
[2:13:52] making ready for the mount zion rapture
[2:13:55] jesus said in the last days it should be
[2:13:57] like
[2:13:57] lots time now i could drop in there
[2:14:00] real quick jesus said the last day to be
[2:14:03] like last time
[2:14:04] this election
[2:14:07] this election is bringing that scripture
[2:14:10] to pass
[2:14:12] praise the lord i'm just letting you
[2:14:14] know that this election will bring
[2:14:17] scripture to pass
[2:14:21] and when it comes to past what we're
[2:14:22] looking for is the coming of the lord
[2:14:24] i'm not looking to stay here
[2:14:25] this land is not my land praise the lord
[2:14:30] but one day this is going to be purged
[2:14:32] then i'll come back and live on it
[2:14:34] amen amen amen but he says
[2:14:38] in the last days it would be like lost
[2:14:39] time his preaching
[2:14:41] will be with the spirit and strength
[2:14:43] line of god's word
[2:14:45] because so much has been called god's
[2:14:47] truth many will misunderstand this
[2:14:49] messenger
[2:14:50] i got wrote here p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y
[2:14:53] prophecy because uh so much has been
[2:14:56] called god's truth by fakers
[2:14:57] many true ministers will misunderstand
[2:15:00] that messenger
[2:15:02] true ministers will misunderstand the
[2:15:05] messenger can you get that
[2:15:07] true ministers good men
[2:15:11] misunderstand
[2:15:14] amen no it wasn't he didn't brother
[2:15:16] branham didn't deceive nobody you just
[2:15:18] got a misunderstanding
[2:15:20] praise the lord look at this
[2:15:24] as the end time prophecies we'll repeat
[2:15:26] i believe
[2:15:27] and this is the last paragraph
[2:15:30] of this uh uh pick up your pen and write
[2:15:33] i'm reading it from the original time
[2:15:35] brother branham shared it out of spoken
[2:15:36] words original seed part two
[2:15:38] this is the last paragraph of it but i
[2:15:40] haven't got
[2:15:41] to you know the uh the church age book
[2:15:44] we'll save that for a later time but
[2:15:45] we'll come back next sunday we'll finish
[2:15:47] it off
[2:15:47] because i got some other things i got to
[2:15:49] share about the friend of the bridegroom
[2:15:51] but here uh as the as the end time
[2:15:53] prophecy will repeat i believe
[2:15:55] as the first forerunner came from the
[2:15:56] wilderness and crime
[2:15:58] behold the lamb of god the second
[2:16:01] forerunner which is brother branham's
[2:16:02] ministry
[2:16:03] the second foreigner forerunner will
[2:16:05] probably do the same by
[2:16:07] pointing the people now look at this
[2:16:09] statement pointing the people
[2:16:11] to a word born bride i like that
[2:16:14] statement
[2:16:15] pointing the people to a word born the
[2:16:17] bride of christ
[2:16:18] will be pointed to the skies at the
[2:16:20] appearing of jesus screaming
[2:16:23] behold the lamb of god will come forth
[2:16:25] from his lips
[2:16:26] god help us to be ready for this near
[2:16:28] event i better leave it
[2:16:30] from right here now that when i was
[2:16:33] just thinking on the the statement there
[2:16:35] that will be pointed
[2:16:37] uh they point the people to a word born
[2:16:40] bride
[2:16:44] not point to people to anything else not
[2:16:47] pointing to people
[2:16:48] you know i mean you would think he might
[2:16:49] say point the people to jesus
[2:16:52] he says point the people to not wasn't
[2:16:54] even brother bran i'm saying that that
[2:16:56] was the angel
[2:16:57] said that point the people
[2:17:01] to a word born bride
[2:17:05] what that tells me is that we as
[2:17:07] individuals got to recognize
[2:17:09] who we are see
[2:17:12] when when when rebecca recognized that
[2:17:15] she was a part of the vision
[2:17:17] she quickly got in step with the vision
[2:17:20] and when we recognize who we are
[2:17:22] we're going to get in step with what god
[2:17:23] has called us to be
[2:17:25] and a word born bride i want to just
[2:17:26] read these things about about
[2:17:28] what what this lord just kind of showed
[2:17:30] me say that the same word this is the
[2:17:32] quote that's coming out of the comforter
[2:17:34] but i won't read it
[2:17:35] the same word that was made flesh
[2:17:38] talking about jesus christ now the word
[2:17:40] in the beginning was the word the word
[2:17:42] was with god the word was god the word
[2:17:44] was made flesh and dwelt among us
[2:17:45] the same word that was made flesh
[2:17:48] and dwelt among us has become
[2:17:52] our flesh i'm talking to the word born
[2:17:55] bride
[2:17:56] the word that became flesh has now
[2:17:58] become
[2:17:59] our flesh let me go in with another
[2:18:01] statement that the prophet said
[2:18:03] uh if we don't compromise with that word
[2:18:06] we stay right with it if we don't
[2:18:08] compromise it
[2:18:09] that same word living in you will
[2:18:11] produce the same thing that it did
[2:18:13] when he was made flesh because your
[2:18:15] flesh
[2:18:16] holds it your flesh is holding
[2:18:20] the promise it may not look like it but
[2:18:23] i'm reading to you i'm reading to the
[2:18:24] word born bride your flesh is holding it
[2:18:26] right now
[2:18:28] it ain't coming you're holding it i got
[2:18:29] something else to say to the word born
[2:18:31] blind
[2:18:32] here's the secret of it the word
[2:18:35] is in the bride as it was in mary
[2:18:38] the word ain't coming in the word is
[2:18:41] already in
[2:18:42] just like it was in mary i'm talking to

[2:18:49] i hope you're ready for it i want to
[2:18:51] tell you something because
[2:18:52] he was looking for uh he was looking for
[2:18:55] uh this woman with character and what we
[2:18:57] found out
[2:18:57] is that rebecca not only had character a
[2:19:00] man she was
[2:19:01] she was pretty and she was a virgin
[2:19:03] glory to god
[2:19:04] and i want to tell you something you are
[2:19:06] the pure
[2:19:09] virtuous sinless pride of the son of the
[2:19:12] living god

[2:19:16] spirit of god
[2:19:17] and washed in the blood of jesus christ
[2:19:19] and believes every word of god
[2:19:20] stands as though you never sin at the
[2:19:24] first
[2:19:24] place you are perfect
[2:19:29] [Applause]
[2:19:32] this is the word born bride that he's
[2:19:34] talking to
[2:19:36] can i give you another one the bride has
[2:19:38] the mind of christ
[2:19:39] but she knows what he wants done with
[2:19:41] the words
[2:19:42] she performs the command of the word in
[2:19:45] his name
[2:19:46] for she has not gonna get but she
[2:19:50] already has thus saith
[2:19:53] the lord and since you have just said
[2:19:56] the lord

[2:20:00] and wider and wider
[2:20:03] please god amen
[2:20:07] amen the word is quickened by the spirit
[2:20:10] and then it comes to pass
[2:20:12] hallelujah here's another one that i
[2:20:14] want to give you my god
[2:20:16] when a spirit born word born
[2:20:19] amen spirit-filled man in
[2:20:22] faith takes that word into his heart
[2:20:26] places it upon his lips oh my
[2:20:30] talking to the world born why that is
[2:20:33] the same as
[2:20:34] deity speaking i love this promise
[2:20:37] every mountain has to go
[2:20:42] satan cannot stand before
[2:20:45] that man that's the word born pride
[2:20:48] we must recognize who we are
[2:20:54] i got one other statement i need to make
[2:20:56] to you
[2:20:59] the word born brought is ordained
[2:21:04] to destroy the works of the devil amen
[2:21:13] [Applause]
[2:21:20] there's a quote here where
[2:21:23] brother branham brings it out of spoken
[2:21:25] words original scene i'm going to
[2:21:26] paragraph 328 in this
[2:21:29] and it's a quoting from first john 3 8
[2:21:32] first john 3 8 says he that committeth
[2:21:34] sin is of the devil for the devil
[2:21:36] sinneth
[2:21:37] from the beginning for the purpose for
[2:21:39] this purpose the son of god was
[2:21:41] manifested that he might destroy the
[2:21:42] works of the devil in this quote he says
[2:21:44] now christ was manifested to destroy the
[2:21:48] works of the devil
[2:21:49] do you believe that he says now i can't
[2:21:51] explain all this
[2:21:53] i'm just gonna go through it just
[2:21:56] quickly now
[2:21:57] hit the high place so you won't stay too
[2:21:59] long
[2:22:00] christ was manifested to destroy the
[2:22:01] works of the devil is that right
[2:22:04] do you all believe that that's that's
[2:22:06] why what was he
[2:22:07] god's word he was god's word which
[2:22:10] destroys the works of the hybrid the
[2:22:12] devil
[2:22:13] is that right he was done to do that
[2:22:17] he was born to be that to destroy the
[2:22:19] works of the devil look at this
[2:22:21] now his body
[2:22:28] that mean don't run from no devils
[2:22:33] don't don't be running from the devil
[2:22:34] now you're the body of christ
[2:22:37] and if he was born to destroy the work
[2:22:38] of the devil then guess what your job is
[2:22:41] that's right and that that means don't
[2:22:43] pity pat with the devil
[2:22:46] if you see the devil destroy
[2:22:52] his body is to do the same
[2:22:55] because the body is head and body is
[2:22:57] together that's right
[2:22:59] if christ is the head was the word his
[2:23:01] body has to be the same thing as he
[2:23:03] as his head was that's right a church of
[2:23:05] the word born of the word
[2:23:07] virgin born from the word not
[2:23:09] denominational now virgin born from the
[2:23:11] word
[2:23:12] the way the body operates is by the head
[2:23:15] that's right see i thought about this
[2:23:19] story
[2:23:20] and i'm gonna say this in closing
[2:23:23] um we're born to destroy the works of
[2:23:26] the devil you know
[2:23:27] only only the bride only the bride the
[2:23:30] body
[2:23:30] of christ can can actually destroy the
[2:23:32] works of the devil
[2:23:34] on our little call that we have in the
[2:23:36] mornings when brothers are preaching and
[2:23:38] bringing out things and
[2:23:40] one brother brought out the story of of
[2:23:42] esther

[2:30:40] these different characters fit in
[2:30:41] scripture these stories are not just
[2:30:44] stories if we just go and just meditate
[2:30:46] and just just
[2:30:47] start putting people okay this is i'm
[2:30:49] represented as rebecca
[2:30:51] we look at her character and we see how
[2:30:54] we have to have that same type of
[2:30:55] character in this hour
[2:30:56] we can see abraham representing the
[2:30:58] father sending his servant
[2:31:00] eliezer eliezer representing william
[2:31:04] branham
[2:31:05] not just lord and that's that's for this
[2:31:07] day
[2:31:08] but we could go back into the first
[2:31:09] church age and we'd see eliezer would
[2:31:11] represent paul
[2:31:13] in the second church age eliezer would
[2:31:15] represent iranians
[2:31:17] in the third church age columbia martin
[2:31:19] and luther and wesley and so on and so
[2:31:21] forth it would represent these different
[2:31:22] messengers
[2:31:23] that were promised to come according to
[2:31:27] revelation 2 and 3 help us to see
[2:31:30] ourselves in scripture

[2:32:41] [Music]
[2:32:43] praise the lord what a message
[2:32:48] we were born to destroy the works of the
[2:32:50] enemy
[2:32:52] amen this brother jack was just
[2:32:54] preaching that
[2:32:55] you know earlier in the week
[2:32:59] i was thinking
[2:33:02] as brother branham said god hates a
[2:33:04] powerless church
[2:33:07] and as i thought on as i posted this in
[2:33:09] in the brothers chat
[2:33:12] i guess it was wild brother kwaku it was
[2:33:14] while brother quaker was actually
[2:33:16] preaching and we were streaming and he
[2:33:19] hit a point i don't remember exactly
[2:33:21] what he said
[2:33:22] but this thought hit me that god hates a
[2:33:24] powerless church and the scripture came
[2:33:26] to mind
[2:33:28] now unto him that is able to do
[2:33:30] exceeding abundantly above
[2:33:32] all we can ask or think
[2:33:35] according to the power that worketh in
[2:33:38] us
[2:33:40] and god hates a powerless church but the
[2:33:42] church that's here now already has
[2:33:44] power and we haven't woken up yet to use
[2:33:47] it
[2:33:48] but we were here at this appointed time
[2:33:51] for a purpose
[2:33:52] and we heard that purpose this morning
[2:33:54] to destroy the works of the enemy
[2:33:57] amen let's stand to our feet and we'll
[2:34:00] just sing this chorus a little bit

[2:37:00] oh
[2:37:03] that's what i will be that's what i

[2:37:22] apologize
[2:37:23] today um
[2:37:27] normally before church we normally get
[2:37:30] here about 30 minutes early
[2:37:32] you know we pray and do everything but
[2:37:33] today
[2:37:35] i ran in here right straight from the
[2:37:37] car straight to the pulpit
[2:37:39] that's something something that normally
[2:37:41] doesn't happen
[2:37:43] well in doing that i wasn't properly
[2:37:46] prepared you know had a very busy week
[2:37:49] and
[2:37:50] you know i have songs in my heart and we
[2:37:52] have a hour and 30 minute drive so i get
[2:37:55] things begin to move all the time and i
[2:37:56] come in and we just float
[2:37:59] but this morning it didn't happen like
[2:38:01] that you know we were actually
[2:38:04] here all day yesterday and we were up
[2:38:06] with the
[2:38:07] some of the saints from the boynton
[2:38:09] church last night pretty late
[2:38:11] photographing a party we got up and
[2:38:15] my wife had to had to do some things and
[2:38:18] just didn't get my family ready in time
[2:38:20] to come to church
[2:38:21] so we ran into the house of lord
[2:38:24] all rushed and everything so when i came
[2:38:28] in and sister rebecca was already
[2:38:31] playing
[2:38:33] so i whispered over in the ear sister
[2:38:38] i need you to just flow
[2:38:41] and that's what she did sister rebecca
[2:38:44] began
[2:38:45] the song service and i like to thank the
[2:38:48] lord for our musicians because they can
[2:38:51] get into
[2:38:52] a place where they are just anointed and
[2:38:55] they helped
[2:38:56] they helped me out so much here so as
[2:38:59] she began to play and she put me
[2:39:01] she was already in the first song we
[2:39:03] began to sing that song and then
[2:39:06] we read the scriptures she put me in
[2:39:07] another song and when she
[2:39:10] put us in that second song then finally
[2:39:13] i was able to get in the channel where
[2:39:15] i was supposed to be in order to have
[2:39:17] songs lined up to complement the
[2:39:18] ministry of the word
[2:39:20] and i'm grateful for the musicians that
[2:39:22] we say it all the time we bless the lord
[2:39:24] for our musicians but
[2:39:26] they put so much into the service and
[2:39:28] while the lord is moving sometimes
[2:39:30] they're just sitting here they don't get
[2:39:32] the opportunity to enter in like
[2:39:35] like they should but i'm so glad that
[2:39:37] they're able to
[2:39:39] rotate sister rachel she can stand back
[2:39:42] then just rejoice in the presence of the
[2:39:43] lord
