the right time the presence of the Lord got to move it in the place and I thought I was there out of Duty but I realized I had an appointment with almighty God and and by the time my appointment was over I was not the same man that walked through the door and I'm here to tell you this morning that he can change it he's here to bring a change in your life and even if you didn't want him he's still

good the reason I feel good is because I feel God I know that he is present amen and um and it's good to be able to come like I said and just feel his presence you know we we are in a temporary location but even where we are he remains with us and the the the the sermon that I preached at um their rock is not like our wherever we go our Rock goes with us he follows us wherever we go amen and we can feel the presence of the rock here this morning amen amen I say Lord hide me under the Rock protect me keep me he did that this week you know we a hurricane missed us by the grace of God amen we thank the Lord for his watchful hand amen God is good God is good amen um before I just um get this y'all can just grab your Bibles I'm gonna just mention it so quick we were we were short-handed uh this week with uh coming to set things up and and I put out a little text because uh the team that usually is here they weren't able to be here this week so put out a text and a few Brothers responded and um and and I was just grateful for those that responded but I was also told sister Tanya amen came to help help get set up and since the time we appreciate that hey man uh Deacon's wife is right there in the thick of things and just just really appreciate you know just just all the help and and I tell you this means something one one brother was saying well I just when y'all I just get uh I feel sorry for y'all having to set up and break down and break set up and break down I said don't feel sorry for us it's just time that we unite and we we build in relationships that amen that that won't be taken away through the things that we experience so so don't be sorry for us we're happy about where God got us and we know it's just temporary we know we got something else in store but while we're here we're going to worship him anyway we're gonna praise Him Anyway amen so we thank the Lord amen and I I saw sister Kayla there God bless you good to have you amen with us on

me yet and he gave me some some more material uh on this subject uh saying some I forgot to say last week so I'm gonna come make sure I see it this weekend and then we're gonna just kind of go forward in the subject but the effectual fervent prayer a manufactual fervent prayer it's what we talked about so we want to do a part two on that today amen thank you musicians God bless you appreciate you all amen appreciate you all foreign let us go to James 5 verse 13. amen oh how we love the Lord amen James 5 and verse 13. the devil don't like these uh uh this but you know he he can't stop it um I left here and just had a few things that just kind of came against me last week and I said boy this devil he hate me but the feeling is is mutual we hate each other praise God let them know he Swang the more I swing amen this week we have a oh I got so much here to say let me but this week we have turkeys that we're giving away and I went to we went and bought some turkeys and had them all in the car and I went to grab as many as I could just picked them up I'm gonna pick these turkeys up and take them in and put them inside the pantry and I think I picked up too many at one time and next thing you know I felt a little something go down this right here and I said oh man pull something but God is good amen God is good so uh y'all be in prayer we want to be a blessing to our community and we receive uh some funds for the Panthers somebody gave a five thousand dollar donation to The Pantry and uh we're able to take that and use that to buy turkeys so for the church since y'all not buying turkeys I'm gonna ask y'all to do me a favor just buy some gift cards and we're gonna give out gift cards at Christmas time to different people amen so just buy gift cards you can do it the Publix Walmart whatever you want to do just get gift cards we're gonna just hand them out and if you would do a little step further take a gift card and buy a cart and then put something put the gift card in the car and write a note to somebody sister wasting left that with me amen just write a note from your heart to their heart and just put that in the gift card and we're gonna just hand that out to people and let God speak through you to them amen but that's what we want to do at Christmas time so let's let's get that going you ain't got to worry about the turkeys they all taken care of but let's do gift cards amen praise the Lord all right James uh five amen uh verse 13 says is it among you afflicted let him pray cause any Mary let him sing songs is any sick among you let them call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointed him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that he may be healed the effect shall fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the Earth by the space of three years and six months and notice that prayer stopped rain prayer right and he prayed again and the heaven gave ring and the Earth brought forth her fruit so prayer stopped it and prayer brought it back amen so we thank God for the power of prayer uh here uh before

this is the original translation into English uh there it says confess Therefore your sins to each other a man that says and pray for each other amen so that you may be healed glory to God and says the earnest supplication of a righteous man is very powerful glory to God the earnest supplication of a righteous man is very powerful this this just just the language of the scripture ought to tell you that everybody can't pray for you I mean man you can't just have anybody and everybody praying for you right you want righteous people praying for you Hallelujah I want somebody to live right hey man I'm not I'm not talking about all of us make mistakes here and there but I'm talking about people that's trying to live right before God I need that type of person praying for me come on somebody amen because of the earnest supplication of a righteous man is very powerful glory to God very very powerful you know so so when when we're talking about this amen this this effectual fervent prayer amen this type of prayer amen I said last week it activates Angelica systems amen and there's a a little something that I want to just kind of show how it activates it just Prayer Changes Things prayer prayer prayer is our weapon we we can't don't let the devil take that from you amen and why is it that always the devil fight our prayer life maybe he knows something that we just don't know if the weakest Christian could just get to their knees it didn't say how long they sat down there only but if they just got there they were in a position of power they were in a position of authority they were in a position to change something core I'm talking about the weakest Christian once they got to their knees Hallelujah and begin to open a mouth father in the name of Jesus man as they begin to pray something began to happen hey the heavens begin to shake L begins to shake Angels begin to get a sign demons begin to turn loose glory to God things begin to happen when the Saints begin to pray Glory Hallelujah why is it the devil fights this area in our life he realizes the power that's there there's so much power when we pray glory to God I was reading a man a portion of this son last week I wanted to just bring it back out of the message Jairus a secret believer uh the prophet says this he says could you imagine the position that uh put that that put Isaiah in here he comes right back through the gate again thus saith the Lord is going to live and we're going to read the scripture a little bit later right up to the soldiers thus said the Lord is going to live right into the celebrities thus said the Lord is going to live without imagine they'd say what kind of prophet is that what was the big difference because before the prophet had walked in say thus saith the Lord you are going to die and now the prophet has a turnaround before he can get to amen the furthest gate he has to come back through the courts and they want to they want to Prophet what is it Hallelujah why are you walking back in here now what you got to say he gonna live well what happened I'm not going to tell you what happened but I do know this much he gonna live glory to God I'll tell him when I get to him what happened amen glory to Gods amen so so he says he says what kind of property is that what was the big difference prayer change from Death To Life it'll do it for every sinner here tonight from Death to life if I could just pause there amen mamas that you believe in God for your children start praying right now because prayer could change them from Death to life sometimes all you want just Lord just get him into the atmosphere you remember brother Troy was Shannon's testimony say the reason I didn't want to go to church because I realize if I got there in that atmosphere glory to God he says I couldn't hold on in that atmosphere I couldn't keep sinning in that atmosphere something began to grip my heart in that atmosphere so mamas and daddies start praying things can change in the atmosphere like this we don't have to leave here the same way we came and even if your children not here start praying I'm gonna tell you some famous words that all of us like to hear amen some of us like to hear thus saith the Lord amen but another group of famous words that we like to hear your prayer has been heard you have reached heaven and your prayer has been heard glory to God glory to God God can give you the words today God can anoint somebody to speak to you your prayer has been heard you've been praying for this you've been praying for that God has heard your prayer man it brings a peace that passes all understanding glory to God here the prophet says this what kind of prophet is that what was what was the big difference prayer changed from Death To Life it'll do it for every sinner here tonight from Death To Life it'll do it for every sick person tonight not say today from sickness to health Prayer Changes Things So always bear that in mind pray without ceasing now I want to just stop right there with that quote amen prayer without ceasing that that's coming from first Thessalonians 5 16. that's what it tells us pray without ceasing you know and this type of prayer like I said it it activates Angelic assistance we want to just pick up a scripture here amen um to show you what prayer without ceasing and this disinfectual fervent prayer is all about I want to before I pick up the scripture I want to make two two comments this kind of prayer Works While others are not even expecting it to this kind of prayer effectual fervent prayer Works While others are not even expecting it to Hallelujah another thing I want to say about this type of prayer Supernatural results can be shocking to one that offers this type of Prayer amen Supernatural results can be shocking to one that offers this type of Prayer all right amen glory to God in the days of Paul and Silas it caused an earthquake when they got they got the praying inside of a prison cell amen it caused an earthquake the other people were not expecting anything like that but the supernatural began to take place it activated Angelic assistance glory to God an earthquake and they were not only just a a Praying but they were praising God with their singing and that that activated Angelic assistance and it changed things I love what we we read last week where where uh Spurgeon said prayer and praise are the oars by which a man May roll his boat into the deep Waters of the knowledge of Christ Paul and Silas we can see an example that turn with me to Acts chapter 12. amen this kind of prayer works by others and not even expecting it and the supernatural results can be quite shocking to the one offering the prayer acts amen chapter 12. Glory Glory Glory Glory are you praying amen amen keep praying now even while you're in service be praying you ought to be praying Lord speak to me Lord speak to my condition speak to my circumstance amen even those that have joined us online you can you can be praying God can speak to your circumstance while you online we serve a god that is not limited by where we are the proximity where we are amen a word of prayer from here can go from here to wherever we send it in the world Hallelujah and it'll bring forth results oh Hallelujah all right here we go amen Acts chapter 12 uh verse 5. look at this Peter therefore was kept in prison amen Peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him and I'm telling you if our parents if your children not even here keep praying amen because it's what your prayer is going to get them delivered all right Peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him amen and when Herod would have brought him forth the same night Peter was sleeping now I like this I told you this kind of prayer Works While others are not even expecting it Peter was sleeping not knowing what was going on you might have lovers that are sleeping right now and have no idea what's going on but prayer is being offered to God oh hallelujah amen listen look look at this now when Harry would have brought him forth the same night Peter was sleeping Between Two Soldiers bound with two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison this was like an impossible situation for him to get out of and behold the aims of the Lord came upon him and a light shine activating Angelic assistance glory god and amen and a angel of the Lord came upon him and a light shined in the prison and he's and and he smote Peter on the side and raised him up saying rise up quickly and his chains fell off from his hands oh I love the way the Lord just worked I mean he didn't need a key to get out of this and you want you want to know what the key was the key was prayer amen prayer broke the shackles prayer provided Angelic assistance prayer changed things with Peter and if prayer could change things with Peter prayer would change things for you look at this he goes to verse 8 says in the angel said unto him gird thyself and bind on thy sandals and so he did and he said unto him cast that garment about thee and follow me my God and he went out and followed him and wished not that that it was uh that that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision see It'll surprise you glory to God let's go home amen when they were past the first and second war they came unto the Iron Gate that leadeth unto his own accord Elite lead uh lead us into the city which opened to them of his own accord and they went out and passed on through one one street and forth with the angel departed for him can you imagine that amen when we walk into the grocery store or Walmart the door just kind of slide up and you want to know where they got that idea from come on somebody you want to know where they got that from glory to God they got it right out of the scripture amen because the angel did it first wow Peter was in prison took him from two guards disconnected from two guards I don't care who's guarding your loved ones God is able to disconnect him maybe that girlfriend is trying to guard him maybe that boyfriend is trying to cuddle God away praise God through your prayer to separate them from the guards glory to God amen God I break those pants gotta break those relationships gotta break the influence so just follow me Peter and that's Peter begin to walk amen with an angel every go through the next Ward and the next word everybody's sleeping have no idea this is going on now now the people that were sleeping was the ones that was trying to keep him in bondage but the church was praying the church was actually praying and it was their prayers that was causing all this to happen so you can sometimes you can't see what God is doing on the other side all God wants you to do is just pray don't worry about how it's gonna get worked out you just pray and here's what I'm here I'm here to tell you it will work out but you just start praying glory to God amen verse 10 Again says when they were past the first and the second ward they came into the Iron Gate that leadeth into the city which opened to them of his own accord and they went out and passed on through one street and forth with the angel departed from him now he's on his own now what you're gonna do Peter hallelujah it's what Peter does and when Peter was come to himself my God what just happened amen when Peter was come to himself he said now I know of assured it he would now can you imagine a man waking up from sleep and all this happened he think he's having a dream and this ain't no nightmare either this is a glory mayor if that was a if that's a word I just made one up glory to God hallelujah amen that's what we want to experience some Glory marriage all right amen the devil like to bring you nightmares why can't God give glory to himself with a glory man all right all right all right amen uh it says um and I know of a shooting the Lord has said his Angel and have delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of people the Jews and when he had considered a thing he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was Mark where many not just a few many come on somebody amen where many were gathered together praying it's something about when we all pray together oh there is power when we begin to pray together glory to God like to look at this and and ask Peter knocked at the door of the gate a dancer came to Harkin named Rhoda amen and when she knew Peter's voice she opened not the gate for gladness but ran in and told how Peter stood before the gate now can you imagine us popping everybody in the midst of they praying hey y'all can stop praying the answer is here probably hey I'm telling you that some of the most famous words you'll ever hear God has heard your prayer when I said I can stop praying about that I can find something else to pray for cause God has heard my prayer man she disrupting everybody God has heard our prayer you ain't got to worry about it no more Peter is here I told you this kind of this type of prayer can cause the results to be quite shocking yes sir Rhoda was shocked not only Roder but now she goes here in verse 14. amen and when when she knew Peter's voice she opened up the gate for gladness but ran in and told how Peter stood before the cape and they said unto her thou are mad these are praying people can I ask you a question do you believe what you prayed for do you believe you receive what you praying for amen don't let it shock you now don't let it surprise you when you pray you activate Angelic assistance things you can't do God can do verse 15 it says this says in the center of Thou Art mad but she constantly affirm that it was even so then said they it is his angel man they didn't pray this Angel out of jail look at this look at this amen it is his Angel but Peter continue to knock him and when they had opened the door and saw him they were astonished oh my I want God to surprise me with some things amen I want him to surprise me with some things I'm telling you this type of prayer can activate Angelic assistant there was no way Peter could have got out of this situation but while the Saints prayer we pray without ceasing oh my just because it don't come today don't mean I'ma stop praying if it don't come tomorrow I'ma still be praying it don't come the next day I'm gonna still be praying and then y'all ever ordered some order something from Amazon and you you expected to be delivered on a certain day amen if it don't come a certain day you start looking forward the next day and you look for it until you get that package you won't stop until you get it hey man don't stop praying until you get your answer [Music] all right all right last week I gave you all some statements from Spurgeon amen but this week I want to give you some statements from Brother Branham things that he said about prayer so let's go and look at some of these praise God Amen this first statement that it says amen uh slot six is where I'm reading from says prayer is the most vital force that God ever put into the hand of mankind oh I like that prayer is the most vital force that God put ever put in the hand of mankind don't let the devil take this from you Hallelujah here's another one he says as you pray you lose sight of these Earthly things sit next the the right arrow um as you pray you lose sight of these Earthly things you sway out into somewhere else Way Beyond and on and on and on until you become uh into his presence I love that amen this next one that he says here Glory God says it's prayer that changes things oh hallelujah it's prayer that changes things all right here's another one glory to God he says with all true reverence there's not another force on the earth there's not nothing on Earth no matter what it is what kind of gift it is amen there's nothing in the world that will come ahead of prayer prayer is what does the work prayer is what does the word next one amen there it is glory to God all right here's another one that it says prayer is not exactly bringing God down to man is bringing man up to God hey prayers not you come having God come down to you is you good getting a godly perspective of what you're praying about especially when you're praying for somebody and I like to use the word for somebody you're not praying against nobody amen pray for your enemies not pray against your enemies God ain't hearing them kind of prayers God struck them dead for what for what they're not saved yet why you want them dead amen God help me to understand why they doing what they're doing Lord let me see what's going on in their life as as I get up into this atmosphere God you can show me maybe a little something about their life then I can then I can get why they did what they just did oh come on somebody oh Hallelujah you know remember uh brother Branham one time went to the restaurant and the the waitress was just treating them like I don't know what and some of them brothers like she won't get no tip for me oh some of y'all don't said that I guess and did that oh oh my Hallelujah hey Glory Glory Glory yeah Jesus hit a wall my God let's talk about it just for a little bit Saints of the most high God Christians we don't act like everybody else they don't have the spear to discernment like we got when somebody treating you all kind of ways don't get upset with them start praying God will help you to see okay uh brother Brandon said he was Darren the president oh she ain't gonna get no tip for me brother man say you know I'm gonna tell you something this morning she went through this at her house and because she went through that of the house it's it's what we call emotional leakage it is leaking over into this in the way she's serving us she don't mean to be this way it's just something that happened at her house it says so what we're gonna do is change her attitude and you know how we gonna change the attitude not just not just attempt but a real good tip something that got her attention whoa the way I just treated them and they treated me like this what kind of people is this we Christians and we praying for you [Music] praying is not exactly bringing God down to man is bringing man up to God so some of y'all might need to go back to that restaurant find that waitress give her a tip [Music] this next one says the Christian doesn't realize what a force he has when he kneels on his knees before almighty God In The Name of Jesus Christ he doesn't realize what power that is if the people could only realize that that was that what is given right unto them anything that you ask for will begin if you can appropriate the faith to believe it amen this last statement on this slide says one thing we can't do is pray too much as he said you can sing too much amen you can talk too much but you can't pray too much Hallelujah I'm telling you start praying it'll stop you from talking hello somebody cause you can't pray for somebody and talk about it at the same time you can't do it glory to God all right all right I'ma go on to uh another thing here in this word document um I just thank God for this uh pray uh when you said we can never pray too much reminded of Charles Spurgeon saying prayer can never be in excess Charleston Charles Spurgeon said that now here I want to bring you a little thought out of this message hear his voice now prayer certainly is uh is us coming into an atmosphere with God to maybe get his perspective on what it is that we're asking for sometimes God can let you know his purpose his plan his will when you just entering the prayer and prayer is not always you talking it's not always you talking Spurgeon told us last week he says you are before the Lord let your Words Be Few but let your heart be fervent now just look at what the prophet says here in this message hear his voice it makes a statement Amen in this sermon hear his voice it says then Moses just chucked full of theology amen he says he was to be the next pharaoh and we find him still not knowing god but one morning on the backside of the desert an old man of 80 years old his whisk is hanging way down low he's seeing a burning bush and he turned aside to see what was going on and when he got near the bush he heard a voice God had to quieten him for 40 years before he could ever speak to him and we don't and we won't stay quiet foreign 10 minutes so God can speak to us with all the rumble and Bumble we have of this day so when you start praying let me give you another little little thing you need to do when you're praying stop and listen don't don't get up too quick just just stop listen and brother random say we can't stop for 10 minutes our mind just gotta check this gotta do this gotta you ain't gotta do numbers stop and listen make your request known to God and now stop and listen for him to speak you know sometimes I come here on a Sunday morning and I'll be in prayer and you know I get the prayer and the next thing I start hearing God speak to me you know what I stop talking I get myself a pen and I start writing down whatever the Lord is telling me at that moment because you know the devil can try to steal that from me and it don't take God a long time to talk to you about some things oh Hallelujah somebody amen but you got to learn how to just get get in that channel be sincere in your heart and if if my words are gonna be few I'm gonna tell you right now the beginning of my prayer is going to always be adoration and we're in worship Lord I Praise You Lord I thank you God I I honor you that's gonna be my words now Lord I'm gonna tell you something God already knows what is in your heart he know what you're getting ready to ask before you ask it that's why he can start speaking to you before you even ask amen have your pen ready go get your prayer journals again get your prayer Jonas out again amen the glory to God it says this it says we won't stay quiet 10 minutes so God can speak to us with all the rumbling and Bumble uh we have of this day and yet Moses after 40 years stood there and in the presence of that bush and that one voice that called him he knew more about God in five minutes after that than all the 80 years of training that taught him it made a different man out of him it'll make a different man and woman out of you if you'll stand still long enough to hear his voice let me tell you something you don't heard your friend's voice you didn't heard your family's voice you're gonna heard your boss's voice but when are you going to listen to God's voice like Samuel did stand still don't be excited if you want something of God ask him then stand still and listen to see what he's gonna say about it oh Hallelujah I like that if you want something of God ask him now and then stand still and listen to see what he's going to say about it my brother was just telling me uh uh you know just a something advice somebody to do and you know just it's just pray about it because sometimes you know we got we we got these things well I gotta pray about that uh pray about what I'm gonna give you an example I'm just say this since I'm here I gotta pray about singing a special is that right you got to pray about it you really think God gonna tell you no I don't want you to sing now there might be some people in the church that might tell you that but God ain't gonna tell you that God ain't gonna tell you that God ain't gonna yeah ain't no sense you ain't no sense of you coming out here saying I pray like you that spiritually you ain't that spiritual if you got a life we want you to sing here do something for the glory of God well I'm praying about it all these years hello somebody you ain't got I'ma tell you right now the reason you got no answer because there ain't no prayer God wants you praying all right amen if you want something of God ask him then stand still listen to what he's got to say about just open up your heart say what about it Lord Jesus just stay there if he doesn't answer the first five hours then wait another if he doesn't answer today then he will answer tomorrow if he doesn't answer this week he will answer next week stay there till he answers that's effectual fervent prayer stay there till he answers you're gonna get an answer amen stay there till the answer hear his voice speak back in your heart hear his voice speak back in your heart and say yes I'm the Lord that healeth thee then it's all over you get settled then see I'm the Lord who forgives all thy sins now go on and sin no more I don't condemn you then you can go free you're all right but you want to be sure that you hear the voice hear that hear that voice speak Moses heard it he was a changed man I'm telling you when you hear God's voice in prayer it changes you your decisions change your actions change your attitude changes everything changes when you hear from God here you know I I was telling you all last week that um Schofield had a note and he was tying the script to James 5 15 and 16 he was tying that into Mark 11 22 26 and and uh 22-26 but James 15 says in the prayer faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise them up and if he had committed sins they shall be forgiven him verse 16 confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much now when he ties that into Mark 11 amen uh this is where in verse 23 Mark 11 says for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not down his heart but shall believe that those things which he said should come to pass he shall have whatsoever he's saith therefore I say unto you what things so ever you desire when ye pray believe that you received them and ye shall have them now I want to just kind of go back to that there's a little statement that uh brother Branham made regarding that scripture in Mark 11 out of the sermon show us the father now the the scripture told us when you stand praying uh well so it says there what what things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them them and you should have them now it didn't say that as soon as you finish praying that you was gonna get it no but while you're praying you got to believe that you receive it I'm gonna tell you that that'll cause your prayer to change to Thanksgiving if you really believe you received it while you were praying your prayer would begin to shift to Thanksgiving and you'll start thinking God for it before you even see it amen and your thanks is what will bring it into manifestation amen all right look at it now show us the father look at what the prophet says it says Jesus had all the fine qualities of God in him do you believe it he said he had powers upon Powers but when he met Satan he never used his power he'd give an example for the weakest of Christian all right when he met Satan he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God the weakest Christian Christian can take that stand hold it sure God's in his word look every time when he met the enemy when he when he meet the enemy he said it is written I believe he had power to do it but he met Satan on the same grounds with the same word that you can meet him with everyone is written look at this you believe it why it's written whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive them he says now watch the order of the word believe now present tense believe now you receive it glory to God and you shall have it believe now you receive it and you shall have it believe now that you receive it and you shall have it I believe now we're going to have a church in a school and we shall have it I believe now that my family is coming in and I shall have it I believe now praise God I believe now that I ain't waiting for it to happen to believe I believe right now believe now amen present tense you receive it and you shall have it it shall be given to you later but I'm believing right now he says but believe it now before you can get your crop you got to plant the seed and the way you plant it you dig it up dig up that Earth and plant get in prayer sometimes you have to break through just to get in prayer you got to break through all kind of stuff tiredness weariness amen stuff dude I went through on the job this one said that it doesn't I mean they all trying to get you to stop you from praying but you just got to break through it and just father in the name of Jesus God my mind is all over the place I don't even know what I'm but I'm I just want to come into your presence oh Hallelujah somebody say you're digging it up and you're planting seeds now in prayer amen look at this since you plant the sea and then water it with your Praises God I thank you I know you heard me hey I know you changing things hey man I know you're activating the Angels right now on my behalf and even though I can't see it I thank you for it because I know this request is in the words oh Hallelujah somebody amen say he says uh uh before you can get a crop you got to plant the seed water it believe it don't dig it up every morning to see amen he says every time you dig it up you delay it that much more Hallelujah it'll never grow you keep digging it up I ain't gonna be digging up my prayers I'm I'ma speak it I'ma release it and I'ma just start thanking God for it it is already done I'm gonna tell you start you start getting into that that Spirit of Thanksgiving gotta start giving you songs and next thing you're singing one song then God give you another song and just an anointing just kind of take over amen you know that thing is settled Hallelujah let's go back to the slides give you a few more statements from the prophet oh yes oh yes glory to God Amen this uh next little statement coming from uh slot seven it says now just go go and don't doubt nothing just go and don't doubt nothing see just go thanking God and now within about 72 hours if our prayers answered did you become sick real sick about three days and nights see you'll become sick nauseous telling already what's gonna happen says don't get worried that's when you thank God why why you start thanking God when when the nauseous is all over you and you're feeling sicker than you ever felt before I mean it seemed like the devil attacked me more now after my prayer or after somebody laid here it seemed like I'm an undergrade attack now than I was before I let them touch me brother random just tells it now now when you get sick maybe 72 hours like this he said don't get worried my say that's when you begin to thank God why it's gone he just kind of telling me what's even happening in another Realm yeah you got prayed for not seemed like it got worse after you've been prayed for but God when when you see that that process begin to happen that's when you begin to Rejoice more because you know something that life is gone that sickness is gone that trouble is gone that disease is calm oh I thank God for that here's another one prayer is what God told us to do that's why we pray because that's what God told us to do amen here's another one amen prayer is the most powerful weapon was ever put in the hand to mankind the prayer faith shall save the sick glory to God another one your prayer is answered lady some of the famous words can you imagine a man being there maybe at a at a prayer line and I want to tell you something about prayer oh my I got in my notes Here might as well say it now prayer is what pulled the angel of the Lord from the platform to the person out in the audience with no prayer card the power of God is here and and brother brand I'm Discerning this and praying for this and praying for that but somebody's sitting over there glory to God just begin to pray God speak to me God I ain't got a prayer card I couldn't get here early enough to get no prayer cards I tried but my condition's just a little bit too challenging but I'm here in the meeting God would you please speak to me Hallelujah next thing you know the prophet said hey hold on wait a minute sister over there glory to God in the red coats and I put that one there specifically I know if somebody's gonna be here today with a red coat because if you had a red coat I would have claimed this one for me glory to God Amen your prayer is answered lady sitting there with the red coat that's got that high blood pressure amen God bless you God be with you you go home and may the Lord God bless you I'm telling you what if I would have been the sister there with a red coat I would have left their heel and I would have known even without him touching me glory to God that my prayer chains things amen the prophet says this prayer is not a perhaps prayer is a sincere thing prayer is talking to God prayers not get down shut your eyes and thinking about your washing or your word you're doing say Lord help me and John and heal Miss Jones and so forth that's not prayer that's a that's repeating some words but prayer is to come into an atmosphere where you realize that you're in the presence of God and you're moving to a movement to then in the deepest of sincerity let's look at this next one it says this oh my thank God for this you see when you go to praying for somebody for somebody something's going to take place something something goes to taking place there is where we fail friends not praying prayer is the keynote ask and you shall receive you have not because you ask not amen you asked not because you believe not ask abundance that your Joys may be full ask and believe that you receive what you've asked for then hold on to it don't leave it that's effectual fervent prayer don't leave it it's a promise in the Bible and it's been revealed to you that God is going to give it to you hold to it hey ain't gonna let no devil take no promise from me I got another one here When you pray and your prayer is not answered it's a good question do you still love him oh see that's when we have relationship God I love you anyway uh you got to be like them Hebrew boys man they gonna take me to face fire seven times hotter than it's ever been and they tell the king and say now look let me just say something before we go here this my is this a testimony service I just want to tell you something say now we know that our God is able to deliver us we ain't got no doubt about that but if we choose not to we just want you to know we will not bow boy that made the king mad got his strongest man who gonna talk to me like that Believers can talk like that because they know they're God oh I look at y'all y'all young people saw the skit up there amen and they showed you how what was happening on the Earth but also what was happening in heaven amen and there was a conference happen in

well God what you gonna do about it yes boys this ain't an angel job this is a god-sized chop I'm going down myself hey praise God God showed up in the fire God showed up in the Lion's Den and God is going to show up in your situation [Music] hey do you still love them yes Lord we love you here's another oh if you only knew that in your hand Christ gave us the authority with his name by being Christians the most powerful weapon the world has ever known prayer it it even changes everything here's another one the factual fervent prayer of a righteous man and I know that a righteous man is not righteous in himself but entrusting in the grace of Jesus Christ so even when the devil come to church like you know you just did this you can't pray you know you just did that you can't pray just make that thing right like brother Branham did when he couldn't pray for the little baby he couldn't he could die he said he said now you just lie to that man and told him that you wasn't in the house you can't pray you got to go get that right then you can pray for the baby oh God what a what a what a what a wonderful uh promise that when you make things right you know your prayer is going to be heard and things are right maybe brothers or sisters and my husband and wife then got into a argument not his heart it's hard to have a prayer meeting y'all just finished arguing you don't fussed her out and then you're gonna tell her to pray about it or she didn't fuss you out and tell you to pray about how that's gonna happen yeah the atmosphere is broken go and make that thing right I'm sorry for the way I just spoke to you I should have controlled my tongue I shouldn't have said it like that that was wrong amen now I'm gonna tell you another thing when y'all can pray together hello you know what the Bible say one will chase a thousand but two two will pick ten thousand to a flight there is power When We Stand Together praying that's right you know me and my wife got to praying for a little situation and and and and I'm you know we just just looked at something we grab hands let's pray about it right now let's pray about this just begin to pray and I'm expecting God to answer my prayer there are some things I put in my prayer journal and I I still got them written down in it I'm expecting God to do it and as more come I'm adding more to it but I'm expecting God to do it Hallelujah here's a a thing okay I think uh yeah one more on that one how do we pray I missed that prayer is the key that's the answer now the next one how do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer I need to put that in and just make a little Clarity but don't be cute with your prayers we pray in the name of your son we pray we pray uh in in in in in in in our great in our Holy Redeemer blessed savior we play in his name we pray in his name let me give you another one we pray in the name of the father the Son and the Holy Ghost that ain't the prayer that's being heard Jesus said ask the father in my name that's right yeah ask the father anything in my name you better know his name and when you when you go to pray you better use his name because there is power in the name of Jesus demons have to back up at that name that's why we come in the name of Jesus and we always seal the prayer in the name of Jesus why you think they they blocking that name today they don't want you to pray in the name of Jesus just don't you you can say this you can say listen to any political prayer most of them are not using Jesus name [Music] why are they blocking there's power so the devil don't mind you just going through the motion just don't use that name but me I'm coming and I'ma open my prayer in the name of Jesus and I'ma close my prayer in the name of Jesus and while I'm in the middle of my prayer I'll be rebuking devils in the name of Jesus I do everything in the name of Jesus how do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name are there isn't any answer all right let me go back here let me go back all right I'm winding up I just thank God effectual fervent prayer oh yes all right here um this uh this scripture Second Kings 20. let's just read this we talked about a little earlier but let's read this from the script to Second Kings 20. that must start at verse one prayer can change anything in those days was Hezekiah sick unto death and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amos came to him and said said unto him thus saith the Lord sat down house in order for Thou shalt die my God and not live then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the Lord saying and let me let me just just just drop something here really quick um notice a prophet going to tell this man he gonna die and not live now we have many people that prophesy today but they never tell you things like this every prophecy you hear is you're going to get a blessing God gonna do this for you and God you don't hear nobody saying hey you God just showed me you're gonna die they start rebuking the person right they don't want to hear nothing like that but here a prophet has to tell you both bad and good sometimes if you hear the bad it might cause you to pray look at what happened to Hezekiah he just heard from a prophet thus said Lord you set your house in order you are going to die and not live this sickness you got gonna take you out of here look at this then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the Lord saying I beseech thee O Lord remember now how I have walked before thee in truth amen and with a perfect heart this man ain't telling God what he gonna do this man is telling God what he already done amen I beseech the O Lord remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and I've done that which is good in our sight and Hezekiah wept saw man begin to cry amen before the Lord oh hallelujah hallelujah sometimes you might need a good cry before the Lord amen there's something about when you just have tears in God's presence oh hallelujah hallelujah he says it came to pass a for Isaiah Isaiah was going out into the middle court that the word of the Lord came to him saying turn again and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the Lord see I now see look he got these two these famous words these famous words that most people love to hear everybody like to hear thus saying the Lord when you hear thus says Lord that means whatever you're asking for it's gonna happen if the doctor says not gonna happen you don't even care about the doctor you didn't care about what nobody said I just got thus saith the Lord this man didn't just get just the said the Lord he got two of the of the greatest phrases that a Christian can hear he got two of them in one situation I feel like shock he got two of it in one situation he got a thus saith the Lord look at this now amen verse five turn again tell Hezekiah the captain of my people thus say the Lord the god of David thy father I have heard thy prayer when you get one of them I heard your prayer you can just stop praying for it it is finished [Music] I heard that prayer I have seen thy tears behold I will heal thee on the third day Thou shalt go up into the house of the Lord and I will add them to thy days 15 years and I will deliver thee in this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria and I will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant David say look he got blessing after blessing after blessing because he turned in prayer one time I'ma hear your body imma defend the city I'ma save your children imma do this I'm gonna do just from one prayer and see why the devil try to fight you from your prayers he realized the power that is released when you begin to pray I want to read this quotas rather lengthy maybe we'll bring it home in here tell you when people hear I've heard your prayer that that just changes everything prayer prayer I told you early prayers what pulled the prophet from the prayer line that he was conducting over to the audience prayer amen can cause God to speak directly to your situation some of the most encouraging words you'll ever hear after you prayed is God heard your prayers that lets you know that God is active God is hearing and and if God is hearing it and he's responding to it there's nothing that the devil can do to stop you from receiving what you ask for I'm telling you right now in this moment God has heard some of your praise your praying has not been in vain you got to be you got to begin to thank God because the answer is on the way I believe I receive when I prayed I'm gonna start thanking God because the answer is on the way and some of y'all gonna see y'all answer before you realize it it's gonna shock you just like it shocked those Believers in the book of it's gonna shock you your answer be knocking at your door I haven't seen people pray for their bills to get met and the answer comes knocking at the door somebody deliver some mail to you weren't even expect it but that was the answer come knocking at your door oh Hallelujah this message here ye him I just want to show you where somebody's prayer just began to just change the the whole situation prayer line was going on and and hearing this prayer line God heard this lady's prayer watch this and the message here you hear him as I call for the prayer line he says I looked out there I seen a little doctor with with tortoise shell glasses on a little white thing around up here a little jacket he's shaking his head like this standing right out in front of me I looked down and he'd been looked down he operated on a little colored girl about five or six years old and it paralyzed her she was paralyzed I said I've seen a little doctor that's operated on a colored child way down way way down I heard an old typical Aunt Jemima raised up down there with uh let out a big screen and she grabbed a stretcher here she come knocking ushers right and left pulling that little child said lordy Mercy that was my child now somebody when your child being called lordy Mercy that was my child said here she is and that's exactly the kind of man that operate well a big bunch had called her cause she didn't have a prayer card and couldn't come to the platform I said now Auntie just be reverent her screaming the tears coming off those big black cheeks you know she said Oh Lordy person that was my child here here he is I I said that's right Auntie said will my baby get well said I can't tell you I don't know I can only say what I see and I started to call a little person a prayer line I said just keep praying God knows you I don't just then look like now now see when he told to keep praying that lady entered into prayer effectual fervent prayer you're talking about my child and I ain't leaving here without the answer [Music] I pushed this brother out the way I pushed that brother I'm gonna get my answer you talk about my baby the doctor that I will my baby get well yeah all they say just keep praying now he's now he's now he's he's working with the lady you know whoever this is at the platform but that that Mother's over there still praying oh hallelujah hallelujah it says I said Auntie uh he said he says um um uh God knows you I don't just just just just in look like a black street come right right across I looked on down through like like an alley or something here with this little girl with a doll on her arms rocking it going down the alley oh brother all the Devils of Hell couldn't stop it then God had already said it that's it that's right I said Auntie he didn't know her name but God knew her name and God knew her condition Auntie now I'm gonna tell you see anybody could have just jumped up and said I'm her no no no no did your baby have an operation did the man have tortoise shell glasses was he shaking his head no he talking to me and today my name is Auntie I said Auntie the Lord Jesus has healed your child your prayer [Applause] your prayer not mine not the prophets your prayer glory to God your prayer it was the same thing with Hezekiah it was an Isaiah's prayer it was hezekiah's prayer that changed the situation cause the prophet to go back in and pronounce life just one second take that down just for a second I'm coming back prayer is a powerful force here in this in this quote I'm not finished yet but I'm gonna keep reading but in this in this quote brother Brandon tell us that I didn't even pray for your child but Mama because you kept praying God heard your prayer effectual fervent prayer God heard your prayer and your child that child gonna be made hold I'm gonna tell you that I was I was I I was brought just meditating on this and I remember the testimony um brother Ron Lilly some of y'all heard his testimony but brother Ron was going through a really really tough situation with his business somebody had come against him and they were suing him for everything he had and it was just I mean the the money that it was like millions of dollars people have to pay out and he could do nothing but just kind of going back and forth to court back and forth to court and he just kept praying about it like Lord I need help I don't know what to do but it just kept praying just kept praying and um so one day he's going to court for like like they're gonna make some type of judgment or something and and they keep putting things off and say one day he's gone it's like this could be the day I don't know what's going to happen here I could lose everything I got Lord well uh he goes to court and while he's at court his daughter's at home him and his wife in the court and his daughter's at home and his daughter is there at the house and the phone rings and she picks up the phone she said uh she said God bless you say he said God bless you uh his brother uh he actually said I don't even know why I'm dialing stuff he says what happened was that I had a dream last night and in this dream uh it showed me this man and this woman that was going through this great trial and uh and when they was going through the trial uh brother Branham actually came to me in the dream and said see this couple right here they got some really bad things going on he says but they prayed and God has answered their prayer he said he says he says now what I need you to do is when you wake up dial this telephone number and tell them it's gonna be all right and it was brother Isaiah Brooks weigh in a whole nother State got a telephone number from the prophet in a dream because somebody over here in West Virginia was praying and here come the prayer being answered all the way states away dial this telephone number and tell him it's gonna be all right brother Isaiah wakes up in obedience dials the telephone number calls that house didn't even know who the house belonged to but just call say look uh this is what happened in my dream I'm telling what happened and and the prophet told me to tell you it's going to be all right my God man that daughter say praise God hung up the phone went and got the best meal that she could find in the house cooked up the meal put a little season in here and a little seasoning that you imma tell you cook different when you know your prayers been answered you walk different when you know your prayer

the number and he told me to tell you it's gonna be all right I don't care if the lawyers say I can't do nothing with it God said it's gonna be all right if the doctor say I can't do nothing with it
