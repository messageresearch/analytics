[26:27] in the house of the Lord on today and
[26:30] amen how we just thank God for just
[26:33] watching over us through another week
[26:35] and he has stayed the hands of the enemy
[26:39] a man from us and we're very very
[26:42] grateful for that as we are discovering
[26:46] daily our city here is becoming a hot
[26:51] spot for the kovat 19 it's spreading
[26:59] like wildfire the hot the hospital beds
[27:02] are full and a man running out of room
[27:04] for people and understanding putting
[27:07] tents and parking lots and just trying
[27:09] to treat some of the cases but we thank
[27:13] God for just keeping us a man and in a
[27:16] time like this we really really thank
[27:18] God for for watching over us I wanted to
[27:23] just mention that we do have a ordinance
[27:27] here in our city where they are saying
[27:30] that all of us we go in public that we
[27:33] are to wear our mass a man as an
[27:36] ordinance that has been passed this week
[27:38] in the city so thank you all for just
[27:41] abiding by what they are asking us to do
[27:45] and I know that if in public and I was
[27:48] told that if you get caught outside
[27:50] without without it in public there could
[27:53] be a 250 dollar fine issued to you so
[27:56] they want you to really take this
[27:58] seriously and and we all you know should
[28:00] do so but let's just continue to do what
[28:04] we can to keep our each other safe amen
[28:06] as well as ourselves a safe and I want
[28:08] to encourage that while we're going
[28:10] through this if there's ever a time
[28:11] where you're just not feeling well
[28:14] a man certainly called for prayer but we
[28:18] would want you to just just think about
[28:19] what
[28:20] you want to come to church or not
[28:21] because it might be better to stream a
[28:24] service if you're not feeling well that
[28:25] way we don't spread anything you don't
[28:27] know the others that around you what
[28:30] their bodies can take and what their is
[28:32] what their bodies can't take so please
[28:34] we don't want to spread anything in the
[28:36] midst of the church and let's just do
[28:38] all we can just to handle this season
[28:41] with as much wisdom as possible
[28:43] a man thus far God has been good to us
[28:46] and we know the enemy's just looking for
[28:48] some little crack that he could get him
[28:50] to create a pandemic a real pandemic a
[28:53] man so just let's just let's just be
[28:57] sensitive a man to to where we are this
[29:01] is a time that we have never it's what I
[29:04] call unprecedented I don't feel like
[29:06] it's like a normal flu or something like
[29:09] that
[29:10] I know sin produces sickness and things
[29:13] that nature but I know also that
[29:16] sometimes man can get inside the
[29:18] laboratory and they can do some things a
[29:21] man in the laboratory and it just seems
[29:23] like something here is just a little a
[29:25] little different and you know and
[29:28] granted I mean the way I feel is that we
[29:30] might not be able to stop it all but
[29:32] we'll just buy and what come our way
[29:35] praise the Lord
[29:37] and then we'll just buy what come our
[29:39] way a thousand may fall at thy side and
[29:42] ten thousand at their right hand but the
[29:44] Bible declares it shall not come nigh
[29:47] thy dwelling a man it didn't say it
[29:50] wouldn't stop it all over the world but
[29:51] it said it would not come nigh thy
[29:53] dwelling so we're just gonna believe God
[29:55] a man for that portion of the word to be
[29:57] fulfilled a man for us so a praise the
[30:01] Lord we just wanted to just make mention
[30:04] a couple of things a man here to you in
[30:07] the form of our announcements and then
[30:09] we're prepared to receive the word of
[30:11] the Lord a man on today I did want to
[30:16] mention that uh we had started
[30:20] collecting some funds for upgrades in
[30:24] our audio/visual area and I want
[30:28] thank God for those that have responded
[30:31] rather swiftly to the need and we were
[30:34] able to purchase one of the cameras
[30:36] actually two of the cameras we only got
[30:38] one install right now but we got two
[30:40] cameras amen that was purchased already
[30:43] and thank God for that a man and so we
[30:48] got we got some some things that we want
[30:50] to put put forth also we we got a new
[30:53] project it's not installed yet but the
[30:56] Lord blessed with a new projector as
[30:58] well during this time so that you always
[31:00] see some upgrades and changes there and
[31:03] God is leaving God is moving a man I
[31:09] just had to stop and just thank God for
[31:11] just you know just this season all these
[31:14] blessings that he has given us and we're

[44:41] John 1425
[44:53] 27 these things have I spoken unto you

[45:37] give unto you not as the world giveth
[45:40] give I unto you let not your heart be
[45:46] troubled neither let it be afraid a man
[45:53] made all law that a blessing to the
[45:55] reading of his word by title this
[45:57] message I would say this morning let not
[45:59] your heart be troubled a man let not
[46:03] your heart be troubled a man on a couple
[46:09] of weeks ago last time I had the
[46:11] privilege to stand before you I was
[46:16] speaking on be not afraid
[46:18] amen and I sort of just kind of took a
[46:21] little text from the disciples there
[46:24] being in the ship and the the sea began
[46:30] to rage and the sails were torn and the
[46:38] ship was battered waterlogged the
[46:42] scripture says and their oars were gone
[46:46] and they were in dire trouble and behold
[46:52] they be they were they was experienced
[46:56] seamen experienced seamen they they made
[47:02] that nude order no doubt that they have
[47:03] come had come into trouble
[47:05] waters before but this time seemed a
[47:09] little bit different this time it seemed
[47:12] just like this storm or this trouble was
[47:19] going to be the one that take them out
[47:22] they will afraid even though Jesus had
[47:29] just told them to go to the other side
[47:34] Amen Jesus that just gave them a
[47:39] commandment but along the way of
[47:43] fulfilling of the commandment trouble
[47:48] came and naturally the human response
[47:56] was that they were fearful and they
[48:01] began to scream I mean these men barely
[48:06] strong sailors begin to hold one another
[48:13] and scream in fear and they even
[48:19] compound their fear they saw something
[48:23] in the distance walking on the water now
[48:28] like I said this compounded that refresh
[48:30] they are afraid fearful that the end is
[48:34] coming surely this is it
[48:36] we can't even navigate the ship sails
[48:40] gone oz but we are at the mercy of the
[48:44] situation so they begin to look out over
[48:48] the water and they cease what is this
[48:52] off seeing no something walking on the
[48:55] water not a very thing that came to save
[48:59] them they were even afraid of it
[49:03] she fear had took over everything he had
[49:10] went out the window everything that they
[49:13] had been taught everything that God had
[49:16] told him
[49:18] had just gotten went out the window
[49:20] because he fear affects you I was I was
[49:26] went back a while 2017 and precious
[49:33] pastor here preached a message on fear
[49:36] not a man a midnight message he sort of
[49:41] broke down some of the things that how
[49:45] fear sort of effects the body so that
[49:50] fear is an anxiety caused by an
[49:56] expectation of evil fear is not now
[50:05] we'll get into something except about
[50:07] this fear but we're going to stay with
[50:09] me we're going to go somewhere
[50:12] fear is a learned behavior
[50:19] second Timothy the first chapter the
[50:22] seventh verse God has not given us the
[50:27] spirit of fear but of power and of love
[50:34] and of a sound mind that all right the
[50:42] spirit of fear right fear is a spirit we
[50:49] all familiar a man with Adam and Eve in
[50:53] the garden there was no fear until
[50:59] seeing kami then all of a sudden the
[51:04] body begins he that was a prop that was
[51:06] a curse there that this thing I began to
[51:11] die we know by medical science that fear
[51:15] brings on stress and one of the biggest
[51:20] things to our physical health distress
[51:23] right so now that they're beginning to
[51:26] feel it
[51:27] here's the sphere it begins to weaken
[51:30] their bodies fear weakens you
[51:37] amen now fear a man is a human emotion
[51:44] triggered by a perceived threat they're
[51:48] with me
[51:49] it is a basic survival mechanism that
[51:53] signals our bodies to respond to danger
[51:57] with a fight-or-flight response
[52:01] amen such as it is an essential part of
[52:06] keeping us safe now I want you to
[52:11] underline that in your brain there it is
[52:14] an essential part oh that is to keeping
[52:20] us safe
[52:21] Saeko that's two kinds of fear because
[52:29] it has a good fear there's a good fear
[52:33] but the paper but let you stand with
[52:36] this line of thought here we want to
[52:38] look at this fear and how how a
[52:40] prolonged fear amen Oh uncle Sextus
[52:46] physically it brings on sickness it
[52:53] prepares the body to receive the very
[52:56] thing you are afraid of in my line of
[53:03] work a lot of times it is the fear that
[53:09] hurts you you'll find yourself maybe on
[53:14] a venomous situation maybe on a ladder
[53:17] or in a bitter in a situation and
[53:21] something happens arc or Sparkle
[53:25] something blows and your natural
[53:28] response through fear causes you to fall
[53:31] and hurt yourself in most time
[53:39] oh my it's good to know that you have
[53:44] the comforter on the insides in those
[53:50] times of trouble in those times of
[53:52] crises that comes and catches us amen
[53:58] and our body responds maybe you need a
[54:01] car driving in a man I've just recently
[54:05] listening to the Bible studying brother
[54:08] jacking brother Willie oh my was in the
[54:12] car driving the church all right and his
[54:14] testimony was that he sold a car yeah
[54:17] and brother Willie was in the passenger
[54:20] seat and he said Jack look he's saying
[54:22] yeah brother I see it brace yourself he
[54:26] said that was the calmest in the car
[54:30] there was a piece in the car that they
[54:34] did panic now even though Satan was
[54:40] trying to to destroy the gift whoa
[54:43] trying to take out two ministers they
[54:47] white ministers day in st. so these guys
[54:52] here they gonna be trouble down the road
[54:55] [Music]
[55:02] to take out stars of God purpose was
[55:14] their protection
[55:15] [Applause]
[55:16] [Music]
[55:18] just like these disciples peak told him
[55:22] to go to the other side their purpose
[55:26] was their protection cut fit in because
[55:33] God said no oh God not even realizing me
[55:43] not even being able to see right away
[55:46] what God is doing but there was a
[55:49] supernatural paint come down in the car
[55:54] hey man it gave them a piece would not
[55:59] let fear take over
[56:01] they fear how to came in maybe he's a
[56:05] jerk the wheel a certain way and it
[56:09] would have been deadly could've jerked
[56:12] the wheel went off into a denture
[56:15] head-on into a pole
[56:18] but because the calmness of Christ came
[56:23] in they took the brunt and they were
[56:28] talking I'm reminded he said when are
[56:30] you all right and he looked over he saw
[56:33] will his feet climb an actor wouldn't
[56:37] let me say well if he could get out to
[56:39] the witness I can get out through the
[56:42] woman and I believe the testimony was
[56:46] but they stood there both had a scratch
[56:50] Oh both pinkies that was it he'll take
[56:57] care you
[56:59] in the midst of a crisis a man your
[57:06] protection is your purpose purpose your
[57:10] protection just don't it you got an
[57:13] angel
[57:14] amen you're not just anybody you're the
[57:20] bride of Jesus Christ no matter what
[57:25] comes
[57:26] Oh hold me
[57:29] [Applause]
[57:31] Maximus already God even we look at Joe
[57:45] Jesus said had you considered my servant
[57:47] job he said okay I'll move the hedge but
[57:53] don't touch it so that was the
[57:56] commandment do what you want to do but
[58:01] that's over all God they're all seeing
[58:05] eye watching the whole thing when the
[58:09] children of Israel was trapped by the
[58:12] Red Sea Amen Pharaoh's are becoming on
[58:16] the back in amen that all-seeing eye
[58:20] look down with anger and said look at
[58:25] addressing with this angry eyes it
[58:28] caused the sea to spread a man he's a
[58:32] protector in the time of trouble
[58:36] amen now we go on and look at this fear
[58:42] if slows shuts down I don't need it
[58:47] survival such as our digestive system
[58:53] fear weakens your immune system fear a
[59:00] man and can cause cardiovascular damage
[59:07] amen
[59:08] fear can impair
[59:12] your formation of long-term memory and
[59:15] caused damage to certain parts of the
[59:18] brain fear amen
[59:22] this can make it even more difficult to
[59:26] regulate fear you see and can leave a
[59:29] person anxious most of the time to some
[59:35] in chronic fear the world looks scary
[59:39] and their memories confirm that example
[59:44] if somebody go through something and
[59:48] then every time they get in that
[59:49] position again that's what comes back
[59:51] and causes an anxiety how many times
[59:55] people come to the prayer line and
[59:59] brother Brett up say oh you just got an
[1:00:00] anxiety
[1:00:01] I remember hearing the message about the
[1:00:05] young lady who a man was over she was a
[1:00:09] little child a dog chased her and she
[1:00:14] carried that fear throughout her entire
[1:00:16] life and it caused anxieties and the
[1:00:22] Prophet a man being a seer was able to
[1:00:25] go back all the way down to her
[1:00:27] childhood Switzer it's this whole bottom
[1:00:30] line though it was affecting her body it
[1:00:33] was affecting her health she could see
[1:00:44] when he take it out he'd take it out
[1:00:46] from the room
[1:00:49] amen the initial cause of that family
[1:00:54] amen so we're going to look at a few
[1:00:58] things here we see how fear can cause
[1:01:03] problems but that's a good fear as I say
[1:01:08] amen
[1:01:10] the Bible says in Proverbs amen to the
[1:01:14] first chapter the seventh verse that the
[1:01:18] fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:01:20] knowledge but fools despise wisdom and
[1:01:24] instruction amen and psalms says the
[1:01:29] fear of the Lord is clean enduring
[1:01:32] forever the judgment of the Lord is true
[1:01:36] and righteous altogether so fear a
[1:01:41] healthy fear of healthy fear it's a fear
[1:01:47] god it's difficult see the problem is my
[1:01:53] wife and i was just having this
[1:01:54] conversation was having a conversation
[1:01:55] with her a dear friend and and he said
[1:01:59] it well she was speaking about his
[1:02:01] father and had some issues and he said
[1:02:05] well I don't know I'm not afraid you
[1:02:07] know because I know my father's going to
[1:02:10] heaven well that sounds good amen and I
[1:02:15] pray that your father goes to heaven but
[1:02:20] there is a fact you know if we would be
[1:02:25] honest with ourselves I have been to a
[1:02:29] funeral yet where they preached nobody
[1:02:32] inhale
[1:02:34] but the Bible says hell has enlarged its
[1:02:38] mouth and let me tell you something
[1:02:40] everybody ain't going to heaven you
[1:02:43] can't live like the devil and expect to
[1:02:49] go to heaven that is a requirement for
[1:02:53] that reward everybody not
[1:02:57] going so he did the world today see this
[1:03:02] that were God in such a loving God that
[1:03:04] he will I beg your pardon I beg your
[1:03:08] pardon he is a just God and if you don't
[1:03:13] come God's provided way there is a
[1:03:16] Hellfire way don't you know that's just
[1:03:20] that's just flat but it's right Amen I
[1:03:24] was talking to a president and he said
[1:03:26] well what will your preach conviction
[1:03:29] what do you mean we don't preach
[1:03:31] conviction if you don't know the Lord I
[1:03:33] hope the convictions all over you
[1:03:37] the only thing is not going to get back
[1:03:40] and you find yourself on the right side
[1:03:42] if you find yourself on the winning side
[1:03:46] imagine that conviction turns the joy
[1:03:49] Amen that sulking turns to shouting Amen
[1:03:53] not sadness turns to joy in your heart
[1:03:57] Amen because you know a man that he has
[1:04:02] called you a man that you have not only
[1:04:04] called you but you've heard to call not
[1:04:09] only have you heard to call and made but
[1:04:12] you believe the call not only did you
[1:04:15] believe because it made but you applied
[1:04:18] to token not only did you apply to token
[1:04:24] but after you apply the token you find
[1:04:27] rest
[1:04:29] Amen you find rest
[1:04:32] Amen and knowing Amen that absent from
[1:04:36] this body present with the Lord no
[1:04:39] matter what calm are no matter what go
[1:04:41] there's a certain rest there's a certain
[1:04:44] peace he said I give you peace my peace
[1:04:48] amen
[1:04:50] the world know nothing about us right
[1:04:53] everybody he's scared
[1:04:57] Amen we have a certain societal group
[1:05:01] that isn't afraid that they're losing
[1:05:03] their grip on America
[1:05:06] we have a certain societal group that's
[1:05:10] steering that all I'm a fan oh I'm
[1:05:13] afraid of what might happen to me if I
[1:05:15] go out in the dark here you have another
[1:05:22] group that's afraid oh my god I'm gonna
[1:05:25] lose all of my money
[1:05:29] the world is take it on that spirit of
[1:05:34] fear amen
[1:05:41] don't want to get ahead of myself let me
[1:05:44] read a little something here you love
[1:05:46] the Lord amen amen
[1:05:53] bear with me here for one second I have
[1:05:57] a quote here brought a prophet if you
[1:06:01] can put this up here let me make sure I
[1:06:04] get it right
[1:06:19] help me Lord Jesus amen you know the
[1:06:24] prophet of God says that he says when
[1:06:30] the supernatural comes in amen
[1:06:33] he says that's the mind of Christ you
[1:06:37] become so far away from your own
[1:06:39] thinking till in your mind
[1:06:42] Amen this I said I don't want to let me
[1:06:46] try to explain that because I can't so
[1:06:50] what is happening my brothers and
[1:06:51] sisters what gives you and courage what
[1:06:54] gives you that that's something immense
[1:06:56] special it is when the preaching of the
[1:06:59] word is going forth you accept the way
[1:07:02] the prophets say is that supernatural
[1:07:04] Amen that come down he said that is the
[1:07:07] mind of Christ that is the mind of
[1:07:13] Christ when you hear the word of God see
[1:07:17] a lot of times we need a Sabbath because
[1:07:20] you get caught up in looking at the man
[1:07:23] a lot of times we can't receive from God
[1:07:27] because we're busy looking at them and
[1:07:29] say well that's just this person but
[1:07:32] knowing the preface say when a minister
[1:07:34] is under the anointing of God a man is
[1:07:38] no longer that man amen but it's the
[1:07:41] supernatural mind of Christ amen amen
[1:07:49] so you're looking for the Holy Ghost say
[1:07:52] amen to the word you're looking for

[1:14:52] bears and they come to pass I have peace

[1:15:09] what they do they like to do you know
[1:15:12] read between lines here same thing you
[1:15:15] see it's the heathen tree it's like that
[1:15:20] heathen he blessed himself in his own
[1:15:25] heart his own imagination in his own
[1:15:29] line to add drunkenness to thirst and
[1:15:36] this is why they have no fear that
[1:15:41] healthy fear now they got some fear it
[1:15:45] is killing them but see if you if you're
[1:15:49] able to rightly divide the word of truth
[1:15:53] it will put away that spear it off here
[1:15:58] a man and direct you to that healthy
[1:16:02] fear of the Lord that will cause you to
[1:16:05] call on him that will call you that will
[1:16:09] cause you to seek safety amen and not
[1:16:12] only safety a man is in the bosom of the
[1:16:16] Savior Jesus Christ amen that healthy
[1:16:19] fear would drive you to your knees at
[1:16:22] night and say Lord forgive me that
[1:16:26] healthy fear a man would drive you that
[1:16:29] every time the dogs or the churches open
[1:16:31] I can't wait to get down amen that
[1:16:34] healthy fear amen that when you when
[1:16:37] you're found watching Amen by the Word
[1:16:39] of God amen
[1:16:41] when that wouldn't that mind better come
[1:16:43] you yoyoyo shoot out mind out of the way
[1:16:45] I'm going to the altar
[1:16:48] that healthy fear amen I'll make you
[1:16:52] want to come to prayer me we're talking
[1:16:56] about that healthy fear now we saw what
[1:16:59] that unhealthy fear does but there's a
[1:17:02] healthy fear as well Amen that have
[1:17:05] caused you to do things a man to change
[1:17:07] your ways it'll cause a man you to put
[1:17:12] God first in your life it'll cause you
[1:17:15] to wake up a little early in the morning
[1:17:18] a man to get down on your knees
[1:17:20] it'll cause you a man to spend more time
[1:17:23] with healthy Oh it calls you to love you
[1:17:30] brothers and sisters it calls you a man
[1:17:34] to make sure Amen at your anchor holes
[1:17:37] grips of solid rock amen amen
[1:17:42] talking about that healthy fear amen as
[1:17:45] we read on here amen he says here they
[1:17:51] drunken thirst just drink that don't
[1:17:56] make any difference as long as you go to
[1:17:59] church you are right then the Lord will
[1:18:03] not spare him but the anger of the Lord
[1:18:06] his jealousies shall smoke against that
[1:18:10] man and all and of all the curses that
[1:18:15] are written in this book don't take one
[1:18:20] word from it or add one word to it sea
[1:18:24] shall lie upon him and the Lord shall
[1:18:28] blot out his name under heaven that's
[1:18:36] why he's here on earth under heaven
[1:18:42] remember last time I was talking about
[1:18:44] that preacher a man who just got so
[1:18:47] discouraged he just got so fed up a man
[1:18:52] he just said I quit and he went and he
[1:18:58] got up a case of beer
[1:19:01] and he drank that case of beer and
[1:19:05] within a week God had took him home
[1:19:08] blotted out his name from under heaven
[1:19:12] amen
[1:19:13] so we read on that while he's here on
[1:19:17] earth see under heaven and the Lord
[1:19:19] shall separate unto him evil out of the
[1:19:23] tribes of Israel according to the curse
[1:19:26] of the Covenant that's written in the
[1:19:29] this book of law therefore if any man
[1:19:33] serve an idol or keep an idol on him and
[1:19:39] bless himself in his own imagination of
[1:19:43] his mind and serve
[1:19:45] idols God said man woman family tribe
[1:19:48] his name will be completely blotted out
[1:19:51] from amongst the people now is this
[1:19:55] right purpose says a man how true
[1:19:59] idolatry did the same thing in the
[1:20:03] church years ago and does today and I
[1:20:07] noticed watch how the Antichrist tried
[1:20:10] to make an anti move how you know that
[1:20:16] the devil types and patterns after God
[1:20:20] thinks what is a sin is the right thing
[1:20:26] perverted what is a lie is the truth
[1:20:29] misrepresented what is an adultery the
[1:20:33] right acts legal act done wrong why now
[1:20:38] now in trying to do this blot out a name
[1:20:43] did you notice in the church age the
[1:20:47] same beasts Amen that serves the event
[1:20:51] that the images of dead people and so
[1:20:55] forth tried to block out the name of the
[1:20:58] Lord Jesus Christ and give titles Father
[1:21:01] Son and Holy Ghost did you catch that
[1:21:05] yeah amen
[1:21:08] that the same thing that he did the
[1:21:11] devil look and say okay
[1:21:13] gonna blot out some names he says I'm
[1:21:16] that the plan of the devil was to blot
[1:21:19] out the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by
[1:21:23] deceiving the people and taking the name
[1:21:26] of the Lord Jesus Christ and replacing
[1:21:29] it with titles amen
[1:21:34] this is what the date Satan amen was
[1:21:39] doing he was watching God and seeing how
[1:21:41] God does think and he took perverted
[1:21:44] amen
[1:21:46] let's go on amen
[1:21:49] so we see Dan and Ephraim did just that
[1:21:52] under a hypocrite of the king of Israel
[1:21:56] and imposter Jeroboam
[1:21:59] so we see that a man people like to try
[1:22:05] and say that God is not a Jessica but I
[1:22:10] beg to you to different Amen he is a
[1:22:14] loving God he's a righteous God but he's
[1:22:19] also a Jessica amen and once you begin a
[1:22:24] man to understand and have a revelation
[1:22:27] of that a man maybe you have a healthy
[1:22:30] fear because he was keeping people in
[1:22:34] the world a day from having a healthy
[1:22:36] fear is that he only feeds them killed
[1:22:38] one one side of the story only one he's
[1:22:43] a loving God he loves everybody if God
[1:22:48] so loved the world he gave His only
[1:22:51] begotten Son
[1:22:53] and all I got to do is be good to my
[1:22:56] neighbor feed the poor and half of me
[1:23:01] doing that and still think they going to
[1:23:05] heaven ain't doing nothing but chasing
[1:23:09] money I mean when it comes down to it
[1:23:14] that's all most people doing is chasing
[1:23:15] they wake up in the morning chasing
[1:23:17] money come home late chasing I been
[1:23:20] there I can't go I got overtime

[1:31:16] conversation with someone not long ago
[1:31:18] I'm talking on the evidence that our
[1:31:20] Holy Ghost and I say the problem I say a
[1:31:22] lot of people believe that speaking in
[1:31:24] tongues is the evidence of the Holy
[1:31:25] Ghost I said now that's not true
[1:31:27] it is a gift it is not the evidence of
[1:31:31] the Holy Ghost amen

[1:32:29] raggedy spirit in order to be able to
[1:32:33] put his spirit in you he say you mean as
[1:32:38] a spirit still like cussing folks out
[1:32:48] and putting all talking about you guys

[1:33:18] that what he said wasn't here what I've
[1:33:20] loved they said he said it comes by
[1:33:21] teaching of the word I'm going I'm gonna
[1:33:27] show you something here if you just bear
[1:33:28] with me a little bit we're going to get
[1:33:30] into something whom the father whom the
[1:33:33] father was sin in my name now I read
[1:33:36] from the 26th when the father will send
[1:33:38] in my name he shall teach you all things
[1:33:40] and bring all things to your remembrance

[1:38:39] then alright so we look at all into this
[1:38:44] and then he said the peace I leave you
[1:38:46] my peace I give you that the world
[1:38:48] giveth that know that has my peace I
[1:38:52] give you my peace I give unto you not as
[1:38:55] the world giveth unto you see in times
[1:39:00] of trouble the world may try to give you
[1:39:03] peace by certain means but jesus said
[1:39:06] that he would give us a peace but a
[1:39:09] different way and by different teaching
[1:39:13] that you that of how the world would do
[1:39:18] it and that it would be his own peace
[1:39:21] being transferred into you not on you
[1:39:25] being transferred into you my peace
[1:39:30] that's the comforter if there's anything
[1:39:33] that we should desire and more than
[1:39:37] anything in these trying time is the
[1:39:38] baptism of the Holy
[1:39:40] it'll bring you a piece it'll bring you
[1:39:44] a comforter amen let's go on Luke the
[1:39:49] twenty-fourth chapter 25th
[1:39:51] amen verse then he said unto them it
[1:39:56] meant all fools slow of heart to believe
[1:39:59] all that the prophet has spoken these
[1:40:03] two men on the road to Emmaus a man
[1:40:06] hadn't been very except hadn't been very
[1:40:09] experienced a lot of peace in their
[1:40:11] hearts at the time a man they was
[1:40:15] walking in their hearts were troubled
[1:40:19] they were saddened that countenance was
[1:40:22] down amen and all of a sudden as they
[1:40:26] begin to tribal a men are down this road
[1:40:30] a man being so we see a correlation
[1:40:35] between the unbelieving heart and the
[1:40:38] troubled heart amen
[1:40:41] and behold two of them went the same day
[1:40:45] to the village called Emmaus which was
[1:40:49] from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs
[1:40:52] now my wife and I was in the high glass
[1:40:55] place and I'm sitting here looking at
[1:40:56] this and she leave me alone I'm trying
[1:40:59] to share with her what the Lord is
[1:41:01] forgiving me and she was saying like you
[1:41:03] showed her prophet said all that I said
[1:41:05] well baby I'm gonna look there monk I
[1:41:07] won't make show tonight so I looked up
[1:41:10] this three school and three school is
[1:41:14] six comes to six three school and a
[1:41:18] furlong is about an eighth of a mile you
[1:41:21] know and so I begin to look at it you
[1:41:24] know I said well a furlong is the eighth
[1:41:28] of a mile so you go seven miles then you
[1:41:32] need my motor have a you know 7/8 one
[1:41:35] more to have a whole mile that's that's
[1:41:37] a whole mouth so in and threescore -
[1:41:42] 6:00 it meant one more before seven so I
[1:41:45] begin to just kind of look at that a
[1:41:46] little bit and now we see Jesus was
[1:41:49] walking with these guys amen
[1:41:53] emmaus on this road to emmaus amen
[1:41:57] I don't leave it this way so that cause
[1:41:59] any confusion a man he traveled this
[1:42:02] distance and I believe that through
[1:42:04] these seven churches but we are doing
[1:42:07] the same thing down through several
[1:42:09] Church ages amen well we're traveling
[1:42:12] down the road
[1:42:13] amen now I wanted to look at something
[1:42:16] he says and they talked together and all
[1:42:18] these things which had happened and it
[1:42:22] came to pass that while they could meal
[1:42:24] together a reason Jesus himself drew
[1:42:27] near and with them amen how many know if
[1:42:31] we start talking about him he'll draw
[1:42:33] near amen but their eyes well holding
[1:42:37] that they should not know him a man did
[1:42:42] I needed a little grease Proctor
[1:42:46] said when you when you sleep your sleep
[1:42:50] and you wake up you get all of that in
[1:42:52] your eyes and you just can't see see
[1:42:55] they needed to look cool Greece in
[1:42:58] Revelation the third chapter xviii first
[1:43:01] he called it though I say right that I
[1:43:04] may see he said that counselor they buy
[1:43:07] of me gold tried in the fire that thou
[1:43:10] mayst be rich and white raiment that
[1:43:13] thou may us be clothed and the shame of
[1:43:18] thy nakedness not be not appear and
[1:43:21] anoint my eyes with eyes that I may see
[1:43:25] see so he had about a revelation i'ma
[1:43:29] tell you he said they didn't know him
[1:43:35] they couldn't see him you know they they
[1:43:38] stay solemn but they couldn't see him
[1:43:41] you understand what I'm saying they saw
[1:43:44] him with their physical life but they
[1:43:46] just couldn't they didn't understand
[1:43:48] they didn't have a revelation of who he
[1:43:49] was amen
[1:43:52] now and he said unto them what manner of
[1:43:55] communications are these that you have
[1:43:57] one among another as you walk and I said
[1:44:02] Amen and the one of them whose name was
[1:44:05] Cleophus and
[1:44:07] said unto Him art thou only a stranger
[1:44:10] in Jerusalem and has not known the
[1:44:15] things that which have come to pass
[1:44:17] haven't you watching been watching the
[1:44:20] news
[1:44:21] mandus all kind of stuff going on Cobra
[1:44:30] ok I'm so rioting in the streets people
[1:44:35] scared all over the place who are you
[1:44:44] that you don't know what's going on
[1:44:46] people can't see ok that desert God made
[1:44:49] a promise he made a promise in the
[1:44:52] showers not bad with me let me go on and
[1:44:56] the one of them whose name was Cleophus
[1:44:59] answered and said are you a stranger
[1:45:01] here and has not known two things which
[1:45:03] have come to pass in these days and he
[1:45:06] said unto them what things and they said
[1:45:09] unto Him concerning Jesus of Nazareth
[1:45:13] which was a prophet mighty in deed and
[1:45:16] word before God and all the people now
[1:45:21] and now the chief priests and the rulers
[1:45:24] delivered him up and said condemned him
[1:45:26] to death and to have crucified Him but
[1:45:29] we trusted that it had been he which
[1:45:33] would have redeemed Israel mine and
[1:45:38] besides all this today is the third day
[1:45:41] since those things were done amen
[1:45:45] ye-yeah being a certain woman also of
[1:45:50] our company made us astonished when were
[1:45:54] early at thus approaches a man and when
[1:45:58] they found not his body came saying that
[1:46:02] they had also been seen a vision of
[1:46:07] angels which said that he is alive and a
[1:46:12] certain of them which were with us went
[1:46:15] to the supporter and found it even so as
[1:46:18] the woman had said
[1:46:20] but him they saw not then he said unto
[1:46:27] them o fools slow of heart to believe
[1:46:30] all that the prophets have spoken you
[1:46:34] see because over over over in Matthew
[1:46:39] the 17th chapter in the 22nd verse the
[1:46:45] Lord told him what they expect he told
[1:46:49] him what to expect now let's take a look
[1:46:51] at that and while they abode in Galilee
[1:46:54] jesus said unto them the Son of man
[1:46:57] shall be betrayed into the hands of man
[1:47:01] and they shall kill him and the third
[1:47:04] day he shall be raised again and he was
[1:47:10] not a man and they were exceedingly
[1:47:13] sorrow amen
[1:47:15] he was not talking to them in parables a
[1:47:18] man he was speaking to them in plain
[1:47:20] clear language that left no room for
[1:47:24] misinterpretation amen so what was their
[1:47:29] problem he told them exactly what was
[1:47:33] going to happen
[1:47:33] you see the prophet of God came and he
[1:47:37] preached a message called
[1:47:38] Martin and it's made clear by prophecy
[1:47:42] see and if you get thrown back and look
[1:47:45] through the message this is Martin the
[1:47:48] day Vince made clear by prophecy we had
[1:47:52] a prophet in this day that told us that
[1:47:54] these things were going to come to pass
[1:47:58] he told us that these things was going
[1:48:02] to pass but I have you to know that
[1:48:04] seems we looked at this time back
[1:48:06] through Jesus that when he had revealed
[1:48:08] he's walking on this road to Emmaus and
[1:48:10] about the seventh hour about the seventh
[1:48:14] mouth amen he began to reveal himself he
[1:48:21] began a man to expound on the word Amen
[1:48:26] he said from Moses all the way to show
[1:48:29] that the process of spoken
[1:48:31] and he began to too slowly reveal
[1:48:35] himself through them as they made this
[1:48:37] work and just like we are on this
[1:48:39] journey about the seventh time we had a
[1:48:42] revelation he began to reveal himself
[1:48:46] amen
[1:48:48] in this time of trouble and men told us
[1:48:51] that these things were gonna take place
[1:48:53] that there was going to be wars and
[1:48:55] rumors of wars there was going to be
[1:48:57] pestilence that was going to be all of
[1:48:59] these things take place
[1:49:02] amen now in Jesus time looking at this
[1:49:05] these things came place it took place
[1:49:09] after the first and the second pool of
[1:49:14] his ministry now he's coming to his
[1:49:17] third pool of his ministry what
[1:49:19] revealing himself to them it was a
[1:49:21] secret I got it right here
[1:49:23] I'm gonna just preach I'm a quick read
[1:49:25] he said he said it was a secret that was
[1:49:30] only for his followers amen
[1:49:34] there was a time that the Pharisees and
[1:49:38] the different ones they had heard these
[1:49:40] things too so they went and they made
[1:49:43] sure that the tomb a man was sealed it
[1:49:48] was sealed the rap was in front of it
[1:49:50] and they stood guard because they was
[1:49:51] afraid that the disciples would cut him
[1:49:54] steal his body sort of had made sure
[1:49:57] that the thing was sealed up see so when
[1:50:03] the time of the third day when the time
[1:50:05] take time for him the third day when he
[1:50:08] resurrected amen
[1:50:11] if the seals were broken amen they found
[1:50:15] the seal broken so once the seal is
[1:50:18] broken amen at any time amen
[1:50:21] for him amen tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu manifest
[1:50:25] himself amen to his believers they were
[1:50:30] running around scared they had
[1:50:33] barricaded themselves in the house from
[1:50:37] fear tell you a fool slow of heart to
[1:50:42] believe all
[1:50:44] that the prophet has spoken they believe
[1:50:47] part of it they knew that this day would
[1:50:50] come to me he said and he said we
[1:50:52] thought that he was gonna be the
[1:50:54] Redeemer but they killed him but he told
[1:50:58] him he and Matt did exactly what was
[1:51:00] going to take place but in the time of
[1:51:03] crisis
[1:51:04] he said he'll bring all things back to
[1:51:07] it remember he said I have to leave you
[1:51:10] but I will send you a comforter and that
[1:51:12] comforter is to do what it's there be
[1:51:15] the thing that's gonna bring in time of
[1:51:17] crisis it's gonna bring things to your
[1:51:19] remembrance it's gonna bring things to
[1:51:23] your remembrance to hold to God's
[1:51:26] unchanging hand amen because he's
[1:51:30] teaching you how one way of the Holy
[1:51:32] Ghost we can receive the whole ago we
[1:51:34] feel it on our flesh Peter but by the
[1:51:35] teaching right teaching when we get it
[1:51:39] into our soul we have to hear it believe
[1:51:43] it apply it and rest on it rest on it
[1:51:49] amen so we go on and they we go on and
[1:51:55] on eroded and and he begins more to
[1:51:59] expound and man him and reveal himself
[1:52:03] amen and once they caught the revelation
[1:52:06] a man of who he was they were exceeding
[1:52:10] great joy just like in this hour amen
[1:52:15] Christ came back the seal was broken a
[1:52:19] prophet through the lips of a prophet
[1:52:22] told us amen these things that would
[1:52:25] come to pass and but the Holy Ghost he
[1:52:29] will bring things to our remembrance the
[1:52:32] prophecy when these things start
[1:52:35] happening
[1:52:36] watch that third pool watch third pulled
[1:52:43] in amen
[1:52:45] I like to read a little something in
[1:52:47] closing

[2:04:46] scriptwriter Psalms 91 and put it there
[2:04:49] verse 5 we certainly appreciate brother
[2:04:52] Troy and just getting himself out of the
[2:04:54] way I thought that was very timely and a
[2:04:57] real good reminder a man if there was
[2:05:01] understand if I'm not mistaken I think
[2:05:04] the phrase fear not is spoken 365 times
[2:05:10] in the Bible right and so God's really
[2:05:14] trying to get a message to us especially
[2:05:16] at a time like this if there's any time
[2:05:21] that we should be a real answer nice to
[2:05:23] devil trying to bring down these spirits
[2:05:25] and you're coming from various angles
[2:05:27] they come with a pandemic then they come
[2:05:30] with something to divide the nation
[2:05:32] right and you know just just just things
[2:05:35] from everywhere and it's just a spirit
[2:05:37] of fear if we don't if we're not careful
[2:05:39] we'll fall for the spirit all right it
[2:05:42] will fall for we don't even realize that
[2:05:44] we are anointed by the spirit of fear
[2:05:46] amen amen amen God gonna take care of

[2:06:35] manna to carry us at the end of the
[2:06:37] carry us in between just hold on to the
[2:06:39] Word of God but it says this amen
[2:06:42] verse 5 thou shalt not be afraid
[2:06:47] hallelujah for the terror by night nor
[2:06:50] for the arrow that flies by day nor for
[2:06:54] the pestilence that walketh in darkness

[2:06:59] noonday a Thousand shall fall at thy
[2:07:03] side and ten thousand at thy right hand
[2:07:06] but it shall not come nigh V I believe
[2:07:12] that with all of my heart's a man it
[2:07:15] goes on says only with thine eyes shalt
[2:07:18] thou behold and see the reward of the
[2:07:19] wicked because thou has me the Lord
[2:07:23] which is my refuge even the most high
[2:07:26] the habitation there shall no evil
