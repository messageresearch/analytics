God bless you guys tonight. Who's happy to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. No other place I'd rather be. What is opening a word of prayer? Uh dear heavenly father, we just thank you so much, Lord, for allowing us to gather once again in your house. Lord, just thank you when the the prophet said one day the doors will be closed. And we're so thankful the doors of your house are still open today, Lord, that we can still worship from the dictates of our heart, Lord. That we could come and gather underneath your presence, Lord. And you speak to each one of us, Lord. We know tonight that you have a special word for us, Lord, because the Holy Ghost is here tonight, Lord. You promise to be here if two or three gather in your name, Lord. And father, we're so thankful, Lord, that we can have confidence in a God and his word. Lord, you're the only one, Lord. And we're so thankful that we could gather together as brother and sisters of like precious faith. Lord, may you just move me out the way, Lord. That you could have your preeminence. Lord, that you could speak to each individual. Lord, you have something special for each one. Lord, help us to be able to receive it, Lord, and walk in the light as you light the path for us. Almighty God, may you bless this little uh this little sermon you placed in my heart. Lord, may you hide me away, Lord, that you may have the glory and the honor. We ask all these things, the most precious, holy name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we'll take our scripture reading in uh John 5 and we'll read verses 1-9 and then I'll have you guys be seated. So, say amen when you get there. Let me set my timer so I won't be here for three hours. All right. So, we'll go to John chapter 5. Say amen when you get there. So, this is a very familiar scripture. Um the prophet ministered uh on this scripture many times. So, we'll go with verse one. After this, there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now there's at Jerusalem by the sheep market pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five porches. In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind halt and withered waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water. Whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of the whatsoever disease he had. And a certain man was there which had an infirmity 30 and eight years. And when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, "Will thou be made whole?" The potent man answered, "Sir, I have no man. When the water is troubled to put me into the pool, but while I am coming," another stepeth down before me. Jesus saith unto him, "Rise, and take up thy bed, and walk." And immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked on the same day was a Sabbath. You may take your seats. May the Lord add a blessing to his word. So it it I love how the how the Lord works. So this is actually uh the sermon that I preached in Puerto Rico actually. So and it's funny. I I didn't realize you guys were coming this week. So it's just funny how how God just does things. And the title of it is um and the title too is very fitting as well. Um me one second. The title is uh even now you are troubling the waters. So that that was a message that God gave me last year when I went to I went to Puerto Rico and I told you guys I was really nervous because I didn't think I was going to have to minister in Puerto Rico. I thought I got it. I was like I didn't have to do it. But Aquake was like better be ready. And so I'm just like just so nervous and and and God gave me this um this title and I didn't even start it. And Jose remember is out there at the airport and I was I was I was just so nervous. I was I was so nervous and I I thought I was going to faint. I've never been that more nervous in my life. And even when um they picked us to the airport, I got even more nervous. And I'm I'm waiting in the back waiting to get up to minister, I'm even more nervous. And then as soon as I get up there, God just takes all the nervousness away. And I don't even remember being nervous anymore. And so, let's get right into the sermon. So, now an angel has come down in our age. He has revealed the vindicated word to us. And I believe we're living in a season andor age where God is troubling the waters right now. We have a prophet that has came and vindicated the word of the Lord. And I love his voice is still speaking today. &gt;&gt; So, we can jump in the water right now. I believe we're in a season right now. If you have a need, whatever need it may be, it may be the Holy Ghost. It may be financial need. It may be for your home to be brought together as in unity. Jump in that water right now with faith. You don't have to wait for a certain angel to come down. The waters are already trouble right now. Just claim it by faith. &gt;&gt; Just believe it. I believe we're living in the greatest age right now because it's the blending of time and eternity. They asked the prophet, "What age would you like to live in?" He said, "If I could choose, I would pick this age." She said because the blending of time and eternity. So a quote from the prophet here lifting him up out of history. We're standing tonight upon the brim and watching come to pass the unfold two great scenes. And those two great scenes are these. One of them is the ending of history &gt;&gt; and the other one is the ending of time. And many great men down through the ages has longed to see this hour that we're approaching. Even Jesus said prophets long to see what we could see today. So we're a blessed people that we can live in this age where where it may be Satan may be Satan's Eden, but God is still greater than Satan. Doesn't matter what Satan may put before you, God has called you to become overcomers. So you can overcome any and everything that the enemy lays at your wake. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's keep going. As long as see this hour, we're approaching. And as we're living in this glorious setting of the mortal sun and the breaking of eternal light, I do feel that we're living in one of the grandest ages that ever man has been permitted to live because it's the closing out of time and the blending of eternity. History only tells us what we read, what has been, and what's in the future lays in the hand of God. And we find out today that there's not too much history being written because I don't think it'll ever be used. I I I every time I read that, it just gives me goosebumps. I I love that I that God chose us to live in this age. There was no other age he could choose but this age for us to live. &gt;&gt; So be thank we should be thankful and brother Bram said Christians we should be the happiest people in the whole entire world. &gt;&gt; Because we have we we have a a message that's been vindicated time and time again. We have a God. This is the only I won't say relig. This is the only we say religion where God lives inside of his his sons and daughters. There's no other religion like you go to you go to Buddhism, they do not believe in a God that lives inside of them. They may have some wisdom, but we have a God that is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Matthew 13. Another very familiar scripture. So it says in verse 16 of Matthew 13 um but blessed but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear. So I remember the prophet many times he says you got to see yourself in the word of God. That's talking to each one of us says blessed are your eyes. We can see things that other uh denominations can't see. We can see things that other religions cannot see because God has given us eyes to see. We we we place the Isav that God told us we needed to place in Revelations 3 and we can see the word because when we came in contact with the message of the hour, something inside of us just connected &gt;&gt; and we could say amen to it. We mayn't understand it, but we can say amen to it. And we kept walking in it until God gave us a revelation of what the message Malachi 4 is. &gt;&gt; Let's keep it going. Verse 17. For verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see. Think about it. Isaiah wanted to see a day like this. Abraham wanted to see a day like this. Jeremiah, you keep going. Paul wanted to see a day like this. But we we are blessed people. We can see this day. We're blessed people. Just seeing the pope um come from coming up from America to seeing all the prophecies being fulfilled bring us one step closer to to the rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; One step one step closer. [snorts] &gt;&gt; So it says have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them which you see uh to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them. Right? Then let's hop in another quote. How can I overcome? We see this age that we're living in is one of the greatest ages of all times. This leodia church age is the grandest of all the church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of eternity. And it's the greatest uh it's the greatest sinful age as well. It's more sin in this age than has ever been in the powers of Satan is many times harder to fight against than it was in any age. I look 10 years ago and now just to see how how people dress, how women dress, how men dress, you can't even tell who's a man and a woman. Sometimes you got people with colored hair. You got piercings all over the face. You you just see you're looking and and this world is completely gone insane like the prophet says. And but it just shows me that as Satan thinks he's getting powerful that my God cannot be stopped. Nothing is happening by coincidence and is everything is lining up so we can go home. &gt;&gt; So I'm thankful that people may people may be in the politics and this and that but I'll tell you this everything is lining up in the plan of God. So you have nothing to worry about little bride that God has got your back. God is God will be victorious. his word will not return void and you can put your weight on that. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; So I give a little inspiration of of how I got this sermon. So I I I love how how God just just just inspires you. I was listening to um I think this is actually right around the time when Sister Rebecca's album came out and um I was just listening to a certain certain verse and it says even now you're troubling the waters. So it says in in the lyrics, God, you're moving for me. You quiet my soul so I can be still and know that you are moving for me. God, you're moving moving even now you are troubling the waters. And when I heard that even now you're troubling the waters, something just struck me &gt;&gt; and God just began to dealing with me in that that subject. And that's how the sermon birthed in Puerto Rico. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let's keep it going. So now I want to point this. A lot of people um just think that uh you you have a good walk with God because he's blessing you naturally. &gt;&gt; But the most important thing is what's happening in here &gt;&gt; because God will bless you naturally. But don't just look at the natural things. You can jump in the water for spiritual things, a closer walk with God, a a double portion of the Holy Ghost. You name that thing. It doesn't have to just be financial things because the Bible says, "But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things be added on to you." So God knows you need a bank account. He knows you need your house paid. He knows you need a brand new car if you need a car. He knows you need those things. But put your eyes upon him first. Seek his kingdom first because he has a special work for you to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to John 3. John uh so um 3r John 1:2. So not St. John, but John chapter 3 or John the 3r John chapter 1. So it says, "Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prosper." Some people may just read the first part. I I beloved, I wish above all things that you prosper and be in health. &gt;&gt; But what about your soul? That's right. &gt;&gt; Because how many people are in perfectly good health, &gt;&gt; take good care of themselves, and the next day they die of a heart attack &gt;&gt; and they didn't worry about their soul. So it shows me your soul is so much more important &gt;&gt; because if the soul is if the soul is healthy, then the body's going to be healthy as well. Because God God wants you to have a healthy body. He wants you to have health. He wants you to be able to serve him in the full capacity. He knows you need uh healings. And so we don't have to worry so much about um praying necessarily for the the the outside shell, but the inside shell needs to be first because God promised healing. He he died for your healing. In fact, you're healed already. You just have to claim your healing. You're just waiting for your body to line up with your confession that you're just waiting for the manifestation of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So even God, he he when he's on the cross, he didn't die for the outside shell. He died for what's inside. when when when when he was on that cross, he saw you as a completed finished product. See, he's been waiting since the foundation of the world for us to to to uh be that finished product so he can have fellowship with us like he always longed to in the Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve. So, he's trying to restore us back to a a Eden condition. So each trial you go through, each heartache you go through, each tear that you shed is bringing you one step closer to that body change. &gt;&gt; And when that body change you, no more s no more sickness, no more long sleepless nights. The enemy can't tempt you anymore, but keep fighting a little bit longer because the Bible even says, I believe uh in let's go to Romans, not on my notes, but let's go to uh Romans. So, Romans chapter 8, um, and a very familiar scripture as we go here and we'll read verse, okay, Romans 8:18. Now, [clears throat] now check this out. I want you guys really listen to this. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. Check us out. For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was for the creature was was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who have subjected the the same in hope. Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groanth and travaleth in pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the spirit, even ourselves grown within ourselves, waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our body. So for I reckon that the present sufferings you're going through right now are not worthy to be compared of what is waiting for you on the other side. God promised streets of gold. He promised you a new body. You have so much uh over there to be thankful for. So keep fighting the good fight of faith right now. God has a plan, has a purpose for your life. Keep walking as he lights the path. You keep walking as he as he keeps lighting your way. &gt;&gt; And I promise you, God will never fail you. He promised to be with you and in you until the end of the world. So you have a when God says something, you can once again put your weight on it. &gt;&gt; Let's go. Let's go to first Peter um 1 vers7. So 1 Peter 1:7. So it says that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory in the appearing of Jesus Christ. As you remember last time we said in order to be an overcomer there has to be something in your way for you to overcome. Has to be has to be has to be. Has to be. And you have to be tried. It's a reason. Don't don't be don't be coming up to trial and say, "Man, why is this trial here again?" The scripture just told us that the trying of your faith. So, it's here to shape and mold you. God is trying to bring you into he's restoring you trial by trial restoration to get you back to how you used to be before the fall. &gt;&gt; So when we look at the trial, look at like Paul said like with joy because Paul even said, I forgot where he said it. I believe he said it when uh he he was praying to God. He asked him three times and God said, "My grace is sufficient." &gt;&gt; Let's go to that scripture actually. I think it's in uh I think it's second Corinthians I believe if I'm not mistaken if I'm not mistaken. Let me find it. Yep. So uh second 2 Corinthians chap 12 we'll do 8- 11. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, "My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness." So it's nothing wrong with realizing that you're weak. I need God. We all need God. &gt;&gt; And it's okay cuz I Let's keep going. Most gladly, therefore, I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore, I take pleasures in infirmities, reproaches, necessities, persecutions, distress. Now, check this last part right here. For Christ's sake, for when I am weak, then I am strong. &gt;&gt; So, God's strength can be made perfect when you're weak. &gt;&gt; So, it's okay to say, "Lord, I need you. Lord, I can't do this without you." Because at the end of the be beginning at the end of the day, God is your strength. He's your refuge. He's your strong tower. God wants to fight the battle for you, &gt;&gt; but we have to get out the way and play our part. Let's keep that going. Um, so I am became a fool in gloring. Ye have compelled me, for I ought to have been commended of you. For nothing am I behind the very chiefs of apostles, though I be nothing. So little bride, don't give up. You got to keep fighting the battle of faith. We are almost there. So you got to realize the enemy knows his time is limited. So he's going to throw everything he has in the kitchen sink at you. So what you got to do is be that much closer to God. Be that much surrender to God. That much in in rest with God. Be still with God. Because when you're hiding God, the enemy doesn't know what to do with you. He's like, I'm throwing everything I have and they're still praising God. So I I always think of this. It's easy to serve God when everything's in perfect harmony and setting. But to me, a true praise and worship is when you can still worship and praise God when everything is going wrong in your life. God is going to I believe God is is going to bless you more because you have to press through more because it's sometime sometimes it's hard to to to lift a praise up when it feels like your breath is just being taken out your body. But when you can have that say, "Lord, I bless your name." &gt;&gt; God is going to say, "That's my son. That's my daughter." [snorts] &gt;&gt; So, so if you woke up today, God is not done with you yet. &gt;&gt; He is not done with you yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, there are still battles to overcome. There's still victories to be had. There's still souls to be won. There's still when God filled you with the Holy Ghost, that's when it just began. That that's when your walk just really began. So God has a soul for you to win. God has a ministry for you. I'm not saying just because a ministry doesn't mean you have to you have to minister. You can have a song ministry. You can have a gift of helps. You can have a all kind housewife ministry. Whatever it is, that's a ministry in God's eyes because God can use you to lead somebody to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's [snorts] go to Revelations 3 21. So to him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne. So we can have confidence because Jesus has overcame. He He tried it. He he he's tried the inoculation as brother Brandham said. So he we know it's tried in truth. So if he overcame, then we can overcome &gt;&gt; because we're following in the steps of our overcomer. And it's once again, it's not you by yourself, but it's the overcoming the overcomer inside of you overcoming with you to give you the strength. Because without God, we're nothing. &gt;&gt; The the devil will have a field day with us. But when God's inside of you and and he has is he's he's sitting on the throne room of your heart, devil can't do nothing. &gt;&gt; He's defeated right there. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he's calling a bride without spot and wrinkle. I'm talking about the bride of Jesus Christ that's here tonight &gt;&gt; without spot or wrinkle. And let's talk about another quote. How can I overcome? And now we're speaking on this overcoming. The word overcome. Of course, you know what it means. You got to have something to overcome. In this church age that the Holy Spirit was speaking about here at the Leodysian church age, we have just uh been uh through it. Needed a rebuking. Leodysia had to be rebuked because of its indifference towards Christ. It had put Christ on the outside in their age. And I see that so much because you have so many churches that are gathering, but yet God is not in their midst. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they can have an anointed service that they can have a praise and cry and worship, but you see, man is just in control. They have to have certain times they have to be out. They have a certain program they got to follow. How can the Holy Ghost be in that? &gt;&gt; Cuz you're binding the Holy Ghost so he can't even do what he wants to do. And we see so many we see so much compromising. You see 50 years ago they didn't do certain things that they do today. We got so much filth amongst the nominal churches. &gt;&gt; And it to me it's just sad um because they don't realize when God is really in your life, you're going to have a change. You're not going to not going to go to church on Sunday and and c and and curse like a ser at your job the next day. No, that don't work. God don't live in that type of environment. God can't live in that type of environment. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible said that you need a a a new heart, a new spirit, and then he'll put his Holy Spirit. See, a lot of people, they get delivered from drinking, smoking, gambling, but they never go on to be filled with the Holy Ghost. Even brother Brandham said that in this age they can live clean lives and still not be filled with the Holy Ghost. You got to go one step further and be sealed to the day of your redemption. God isn't looking for how many your church attendance. God isn't looking for how many people uh you uh you you fed for soup suppers or donated to the Salvation Army or or $20 you gave to somebody begging on the street. God isn't looking for that. He's looking for the seal of the Holy Ghost. Even I think in the Old Testament, he was looking for those that cried inside uh for the abomination done in the done in the city. So God is coming back to see his seal of approval inside of you. When you get that seal of approval, God has accepted your faith just as he accepted Abraham's faith when he gave him the sign of circumcision. It's no more an outward circumcision, but it's a circumcision of the heart. And when you get that, it's not over yet. It's just beginning. Don't think, "Oh, when I get the Holy Ghost, I I I can just do nothing." No, you have a bigger target on your back because the devil knows you are a threat to his kingdom. And let's wreak havoc in the devil's camp. Let's take back what is ours. Whatever he's stolen from you, take it back right now. Take take your healing back. Take your money back. Take your children back. Take everything back. Cuz he has no right. He has no claims or nothing. He was defeated at Calvary and now he's a defeated creature. So don't let them have any more victories ever again. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Christ was on the outside trying to get back inside. That's love. After he had been put out of his own house was trying to come back in and said, "He that opened the door, I'll come to him." See, the church itself and the whole had put him out. So I I I love God so much because he's always knocking at the door. Even when we were living in sin and shame, he was still knocking at the door at your heart. And when you let him in, I that was the best decision I've ever made in my life because it it gave me a change. It changed my life completely. And I'm pretty sure all of you, all each one of us can testify of that change. And when I gave my life, I I thought I was living life, but when I gave my heart to Christ, then I was live really living life to the fullest. People say, "Oh, living life to the fullest is going to parties, traveling abroad, um drinking, whatever it is." But no, I I've did it. It's not life. It's death. And when I gave my heart to God, that I realized I was missing this the whole entire time. The devil was fooling me thinking a Christian was a boring life. But no, living a Christian life is the best life you can ever live. &gt;&gt; Ever live. You have a friend. You have a brother that will never forsake you or leave you. In fact, he stick is closer than a brother. Even when all your friends leave you, I I I I was talking to somebody. Um I I lost two best friends. Um when I I started serving God, we just going different ways and I would try to reach out and I just my uncle my uncle told me this. He was like, "You got to realize this. It's like an elevator. You're going this way and they're going that way." Not in a bad sense, but it's just it's two different spirits. the things you used to do, the atmosphere you were in, you can no longer enjoy that with that person. The dirty jokes, they try to tell you like, "I'm sorry. I just I don't do anymore. It's not who I am anymore." And and they get uncomfortable and they'll ignore your calls. And I was like, "That's fine." And and I told um I was telling somebody this. So, uh, Brother Jose, that's one of my he's my best friend. And um I was thinking about that. I was like, "So, I lost two best friends and God gave me him." &gt;&gt; Amen. Um because I I don't mind being alone, you know, like a person alone, but like it's good to have a a a friend that can challenge your faith that that can help you go higher. And so I really like that even first meeting him. I I never forget um at the men's meeting, brother Jose said, "You should have a testimony of God working and moving your life every day." And that challenged me because if God is moving and working in life, something something should change. even it's the smallest little things, something should change every day. And that that really challenged my faith right there. And it just shows me it's it's very important to have a good um a good group of believers around you. And I believe I have the cream of the crop here in West Palm Beach. And and I'm thankful to be a part of of of of Spirit and Truth Tabernacle um because I've grown so much a as a as a man, as a Christian, as a minister. And it's all because God knows what he's doing. God knows exactly what he's doing. Um, placing everybody here. Everybody can have a testimony of how they got here. And I'm thankful that I could be a part of this wonderful ministry here at Spirit and Truth. &gt;&gt; So, [clears throat] let's go to Mark 11:24. Another very familiar scripture. I think we'll start a couple verses ahead, actually. All right, let's go to um how much time? Okay, we're doing good on Wow. Okay, Mark 11 and we'll go with verses verse 22. And Jesus answered saith unto them, have faith in God. I love that simple statement. It is simple as that. Have faith in God. anytime you saw when Jesus was was uh was dealing with individuals who need healing, he said, "If thou canst believe," I love how he said, "You don't have to figure it out. You don't have to understand. You have to solve his math equation." But he just said, "If thou canst believe, even he told brother Brandham, if you can get the people just to believe, that's all he said. Get the people to believe. Keep your eyes on God." So he says, "Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, shall say in this mountain, Be thou removed, and be cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, that's a key right there, not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he say shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith. So when you're jumping in the troubled waters, you got to have no doubt in your heart. What whatsoever you believe, believe that's going to come to pass. Just jump in that water and say, "Lord, the waters are trouble right now. I'm claiming my healing. I'm claiming my kids. I'm claiming financial breakthrough. I'm claiming my business. I'm claiming my family. Whatever it is, you jump in that water and have faith that it the need will be met. It It'll be met right on time. Right on time. Every time it'll be met." &gt;&gt; It says, "And he shall have whatsoever he saith." Verse 24. Therefore, I say unto you, whatsoever things you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them. So, I already believe that you receive. Start start glorifying God right now. Thank you, Lord, in advance. Thank you for my Thank you for my children. Thank you for my family. Thank you for my cousins. Whatever it may be, say, "Thank you, Lord. It's already done. It's already done." &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; And when you stand uh and when you stand praying, forgive you, have if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may [clears throat] forgive your trespasses. But if you do not forgive, neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespass. That's that's something I I I had to learn um as a young Christian that the hardest thing to do is to forgive. &gt;&gt; Um ju just you know with different things that happen in your life, whatever it may be sometime it's so hard. But I'll tell you this, there's to me is no greater freedom than to be able to forgive somebody when they don't even say tell you sorry &gt;&gt; and God can only want to give you strength to do that because it's hard because as human beings we we want to try to justify this person hurt me so bad. But when you hold on it's like a rope somebody's pulling and you're holding on to it. It keeps hurting because the other person may never know or may never even care to say sorry. But you got to make peace within yourself. Make peace with your past. I've learned a lot of people don't make peace with their past and it causes so many other issues down the road in their families, uh, in their relationships, in their friendships because they're holding on to something and it's causing lash out because they can't make peace. So I I I tell I try to tell people make peace with your past is be the greatest thing you can do because you can move forward deeper on with God. And it's so it's so that's why God even said if you can't forgive then he can't forgive your trespasses. So for to in God's eyes forgiveness is important. I look at this. If he can forgive us look look how much um how much uh somebody is telling me today about the passion of the Christ and I was saying the I never seen it but I know it's really a bloody scenes when he was getting beaten. I said that can't even justify what he went through for you. He went through so much. Just imagine, I don't know how many people have been born since Adam until now, but just imagine taking on everybody's sins. Literally, the people you came uh to die for, they spit in your face. They slapped you. They mocked you. And he could still say on the cross, "Father, forgive them. They know not what they do." So, if Jesus could forgive us, then he can give us the strength to forgive whoever hurt you. Whoever hurt you. Hey, it happened. It's in the past. We got to move forward so God can give us more victories. So we can build better relationships w with with being forgiven. You can be a testimony to somebody else who may be going through the same thing you were going through. &gt;&gt; Let's go to um John 10:10. The thief cometh not but for to steal, to kill, and to destroy. I am come that they may have life and they may have it more abundantly. So God is trying to give you life and more abundantly each day. Each day you wake up, you have a chance to have life and have it more abundantly because it's another chance that God can show you who he is in a deeper uh a deep a deeper magnitude. Let's go to Matthew 8 18:e 19. So I I love right I love I love this I love this word right here. It says for where there are two or three gathered in my name there I am in the midst. So now no other religion can set claims on that. He said where two or three gather in my name there I am in the midst. &gt;&gt; Amen. So a message from who has believed our report. Now let's let's look what kind of group that was of [snorts] lame and halt and blind. So talking about the bull uh the pool of Bethesda. Now what a a mass of disfigured humanity waiting for the trouble of this waters. Historians tell us that even to fight and to get in the water, they would cut each other with knives and try to get ahead of one another to step in the sea if their faith was sufficient to make them whole. So, we don't have to fight one another. We don't have to stab one another. We can just jump in freely because we got the Holy Ghost here. So, don't no don't don't try to stab nobody. Just jump right in. Just jump right in the water and and put claims on what you have. Just put claims right on what you have. &gt;&gt; Let's go to another one. What here is thou Elijah? Under the porch where these great spouts run, the waters flowed around by the sheepool coming down. Now the people laid there in great multitudes. And they didn't wait just for one night, two nights, three nights. They would wait for months and year. Just imagine that. Waiting for years at at a pool for the troubling of the water. And some didn't even get it. And some of them had laid there a year and out and waiting for the troubling of the water. At the first time that somebody stepped in with faith enough to be healed, it draw the virtue out of the angel of the water. And they had to wait for another season. What a season was allowed, I don't know, perhaps weeks. But they waited patiently for it to come into the water. And historians tell us that they would stab one another trying to get in the water. See who get there first to test their faith? The angel of the Lord. So God in all ages at all times has always had a way of divine healing always. All the way back into the Old Testament, all throughout the New Testament down through the aged right to this present time, God has been a fountain open for those who believe for divine healing. So the fountain is open tonight. You can't exhaust God. Like brother Brandham said, a fish in water. It's not worrying about its last drink. It just drinks freely. So you can't exhaust God. Ask big things. Ask small things. God God said open up your mouth. He even said we said like we said last time bring your strong reasoning. &gt;&gt; He said you you haven't received because you ask not. &gt;&gt; Ask, seek, knock, it shall be open. We got to start. Brother Brandham said we live a million miles below our privilege. &gt;&gt; We got to we got to live above our privilege. God is calling us to live above our privilege. We we live in an age where the book is fully open from Genesis to Revelation. We have so many promises in this book we can lay claims to. Don't be scared. God sent a prophet to vindicate the word for you so you can use it. You're the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The the word get back in step with the word so God can start uh can start manifesting the word in your life. So, it's so important that we get back in step with the word of God. We have to cuz the bride has made herself ready. Brother Brandon, when you saw that vision, the bride got out of step, but she he said, "Get back in step." She got right back in step. So you might falter sometimes, but get right back in step. Right back in step. So let's go for another quote. Look, where are you looking to church? Oh, these last days. Oh, he's been right among us people and we forget it. He sit right among us and we didn't know it. The Holy Spirit is here this morning. Maybe we will go away and forget it. Maybe many that will that that sick will forget to believe and anchor their faith right now where it should be the truth. Truly, the pool is troubled. The waters are whirling backwards from the natural showing the supernatural. The Holy Spirit is here taking a normal bunch of people intelligent sitting here well-dressed, well educated looking, the Holy Spirit falling upon them and something rose around them. They holler, "Glory, hallelujah. What's the matter?" The troubling of the water. Okay, we're almost we got we got some time. Don't worry, I won't I won't hold you too long. I won't hold you hostage tonight. Um, so I'll say we once again, we don't have to wait for the troubling of the waters like they did in that time. The waters are troubled right now. Don't wait before it's too late. Do it right now. Let's go to Proverbs 8 18:10. Says, "The name of the Lord is a strong tower." Maybe somebody needs deliverance tonight. Maybe somebody's struggling in their mind because the the prophet said, "The greatest battle ever's fought is in your mind." The devil is constantly attacking at your mind. He's using psychology. He's using scientific. He's using voices on social media. He's constantly trying to attack your mind. Maybe you need to break from those chains. You can defy those chains. Don't Don't let the enemy give you an identity. Your identity is in Jesus Christ. Don't let the enemy tell you who you are. Let the word of God, let Jesus tell you who you are because he'll tell the truth. The devil won't The devil will tell you lies. Let God tell you who you are. It's the greatest revelation you'll ever have &gt;&gt; to find out who you are inside of Christ. That's where you'll find your identity. You are Miss Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Hebrews 4 uh 14-16. So, I I I love that we can serve a God who understands us. He He was in flesh like you and me. He drank water. He got hungry. He got sick. He got tired. Uh he had temptation above all measure, the Bible said. So he knows what you're going through. If you're a teenager, he knows what you're going through. He knows what's being thrown at you. So he can relate to who you are. If if he he can relate to any age, he can relate to you. He was sick at one point. He lost he had he experienced death in his family, death in his friends, and and he experienced those things. So he knows exactly what each teardrop what it means. Even you don't say anything, he knows you. He knows you from the inside out. He even knows the number of hairs on your head. So let's go to um so seeing that we have a great high priest that is passed into heavens, Jesus the son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of need. I'll tell you, Jesus is here for you. He doesn't want you to do this alone. He wants to hold your hand. He wants to lead you. He wants to guide you. He wants to be there for you, but you have to first let him into your life. Give him full preeminence. The prophet said, "There's there's there's doors in our heart that we have not opened up yet. Let's open the doors we haven't opened up yet." I promise you, it's it's hard, but once you do, Jesus can do the work he needs to do in your life. He wants to give you He wants to make you new inside. He he wants to give you he wants you to he wants to help you to be free and to break those those chains of things because sometimes in our life we we get so used to to living with um our our vices. So to so getting used to living to living with our our faults and our mistakes and all these things that we become a prisoner in our past. And God says he can break every chain. &gt;&gt; No, no matter how long the chain's been on for, he can break every chain. No matter how long uh you've been sentenced for the the jail cell is open, just walk out. Just walk out. Just walk out. &gt;&gt; All we're going to close here these last couple quotes. Uh so when sickness came into the camp, he had an atonement made. He promised to be the God in the time of trouble. He's still that same God today, a present help. He promised to do these things and to see them through. If he started a good work in you, he'll finish it. Don't worry. Now, as he was then in, he is today, the same spirit of God that led Israel leads the church today, bringing us through as it was in the wilderness to the promised land. We have a promised land. You believe that in my father's house are many mansions. I go to prepare a place for you. It's talking to you personally. And you will come again and receive you unto myself. We're on our way. We're going to the glorious promised land that was promised to us. Now along this journey, he's promised to supply everything that we need of everything. Whatsoever you ask the father in my name, that will I do. Whatsoever things. Whatsoever things you desire when you pray, believe you receive it. You shall have it. Now, he gave us the strongest I'm going to say this again. He gave us the strongest weapon that there is in all the world. And what is that? &gt;&gt; Prayer. Amen. That's prayer. Prayer is what changes things. The prophet said the Christian doesn't realize what a force he has when he kneels on his knees before the almighty God in the name of Jesus Christ. He doesn't realize what power that is. If the people could only realize that what is given right unto them. Anything that you ask for be given. You can if you if you can appropriate the faith to believe for God's word is true. Just let one of them um this is from the maniac of G of Garda Garda. Just let him find one sincere heart that he can get into that he will come anytime in any hour of the night. I love that. Anytime any hour of the night doesn't matter if it's 2 a.m. in the morning. Doesn't matter if it's 3:00 a.m. 1000 p.m. God is right there. I'm so thankful that we have a doctor that could come at any time. I'm so happy for that. He's the greatest psychiatrist. You don't need to go to no shrink. You have the greatest counselor right here, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm so happy for that to know that he's my refuge and strength and a very present help in a time of trouble. And last quote and we'll close here. And grant Lord that you'll send tonight your great divine angel, your healing spirit. May maybe it's the same angel that was on the pool Bethesda. We do not know. I don't know him. Father in that way, his name maybe it's the same angel that followed the children of Israel that led them rather in a sign of a pillar of fire. Maybe it's that same pillar of fire that we're looking at. Maybe he's here tonight. I trust that he will be and show great signs and wonders. And may there come a stirring among the people quickly for we realize the Lord that we just have a few days to be here. Just in closing, don't let this season pass by. Don't let the season pass by. God is restoring. He's in the restoration business. He said, "I will restore, sayeth the Lord." So ask what you have need of. We all need a restoration. We all need it. We all need to be brought closer to God. We all need things. Let your needs be ma made known before God right now. Don't be scared. Oh, God doesn't want know. God wants to hear you. He cares about the little things in your life. He cares about the big things in your life. He cares about the desires of your heart. So, God loves you. He wouldn't have died for you. He wouldn't have brought you. You're not here by coincidence. You're here tonight. Whatever you've been through, you stood the test and you're still here standing. So, keep marching with eyes of faith. God will never leave you. He promised that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads. Dear heavenly father, we're so thankful, Lord, that we're living in this day and age, Lord, where, Father, you you've been made so plain, Lord, through your prophet, Lord. You showed us, Lord, that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever, Lord. And Lord, you are the same God that led the children of Israel the pillar of fire. And you're the same God leading us with the pillar of fire, your Holy Ghost. And Lord, we all have many things here tonight, Lord. We all been through the fire. We all been through so many trials and tests, Lord. But we're a product of your grace because we made it this far because of you, Lord. Lord, you you've given us plenty of weapons, armor, a helmet, a shield, girdle, all the a sword. You've given us so many weapons, Lord, that we can utilize, Lord. But I love how you said it's your strength, almighty God. It's not our strength, but it's your strength, Lord. Father, help us from this day forward, Lord, to march on w with hearts of faith, Lord Jesus. This knowing that we only have a few more days here, Lord. That Father, you ordained us to be in this age for a reason to to to to run havoc in the enemy's camp. Father, may we destroy what the enemy, Lord, has brought to us. Help us to be sober and to be vigilant, Lord, almighty God, because we know the enemy is trying to going to set traps, Lord. May we be aware spiritually of what he sets before us, almighty God. And father, may you bless each individual here tonight, Lord. May you meet each need. May you help each individual, Lord. May you bring each one of them closer to Christ. And we'll be careful to give you all the praise and honor. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. [applause] Amen. We certainly thank God for his word on tonight. Um I just believe that when um the Lord sends someone to speak to us and they give us a a subject like that, then God is certainly trying to elevate our faith. Um the title was even now you're troubling the water. And um when we just go back in scripture and look at that whole situation and what the Lord Jesus was doing, this man was there bound with a condition uh for 38 years. And according to our prophet, um it wasn't anything that was going to kill the man. He he had this um this situation, but it wasn't something that was going to kill him. He had been living with it for 38 years. So um you know but when Jesus gets to him and um he begins to ask him very specific question and that was will thou be made whole. Um you know and and and the man hears the question but he begins to give a answer different than what Jesus asked. Uh his answer is, "Well, you know, whenever the angel come in trouble the water, there's nobody to help me get in." And um Jesus wasn't even talking about getting in the water. He asks, "Will thou be made whole?" Right? And um sometimes we miss what God is speaking to us at the time that he's speaking. And I just believe the Holy Spirit came to speak a word to each and every one of us here tonight. Uh and and that is right now the water's being troubled. So whatever your need is, you can get in. He didn't have to wait for the angel to come trouble the water. The one that was sending the angel was standing present and all he had to do is receive from the Lord Jesus. and and and and the good thing about is that even though he had given all the wrong answers, Jesus Jesus said, "Take up your bed and and and just, you know, go ahead and leave." And because of his obedience, &gt;&gt; because of his obedience, the man received his healing. And I tell you, I tell you, if we if we would just be obedient to the the word of the Lord tonight, because the angel of God is troubling the water. &gt;&gt; If we be obedient to God, will receive whatever we have need of. He comes sometimes in in the simplest of forms. Uh the prophet told us that he's hidden and revealed in simplicity. Amen. Thank God for brother Mark. Amen. On tonight. God bless you. Praise God. Amen. We we certainly uh appreciate the word of the Lord. Let me um uh get tonight's um announcements and uh don't forget some Sunday we'll be here. Um, and it's from uh our prayer time starts at 8:30 uh goes to 9:30 and then Sunday school run from 8:45 to uh 9:15 and the service will start at um at uh at um 9 service will start at 9:30.

Amen. So uh please keep that in mind. Uh we have um a a few services that are planned here uh locally here at our church.

And I know y'all can't wait to tell everybody what God is doing. Amen. [laughter] Amen. Praise the Lord. Just push it. God bless everybody. I really don't need a mic, you know. Uh, you know, I'm truly thankful and grateful for what God is doing in my life. Um, brother Steve came one Sunday and his message was season recover all &gt;&gt; and also in that he said that one testimony make room for another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm truly grateful to say and to be standing here to say that I've uh gone to Australia and made it back home. Uh during that time I wanted to go to Australia but uh you know the flesh was a little nervous about the amount this that and the other and after hearing brother Steve at the end of that message uh basically I was saying I want to go and at the end of the message I was saying I'm going &gt;&gt; and when he was saying that one testimony make room for another there was a testimony uh we had gone out to And uh there was a testimony and that basically a light bulb after hearing that testimony just came on and God just continued. He started opening up doors, continued opening up doors, continued opening up doors. And I tell you when I think about Australia, I actually never even thought about going to Australia. Um God has just blessed me beyond &gt;&gt; even my dreams or thoughts. &gt;&gt; Uh the time that we had is beyond measure. You all I can say is I know we going again so you better get on board. [laughter] It was just tremendous. The fellowship, the ministering of the word was just over the top. uh the fellowship, the people, it everything was just great. &gt;&gt; And I'm just so grateful that God would allow me, &gt;&gt; I mean me to uh I'll say experience, &gt;&gt; such greatness, &gt;&gt; with the people of God. &gt;&gt; I am I'm just in awe. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And I'm looking forward to more testimonies, opening up more testimonies, following more, and I know God has more in store. God bless. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Certainly thank the Lord for uh giving our sister that opportunity. And there's know a few other saints, roughly nine uh of us total from our church were able to go and and uh and I did mention to them while I was there, there was a a tape that we were listening to um early this year and uh sitting there on one of the Friday night tape services and as I'm listening to the tape, brother Rana makes a a comment and it says um it says uh these tapes are going a whole into the the jungles of Africa and way down in Australia. And it says where uh the way that they get sugar is that they have to take a ant and cut it in half and get sugar out the ant. And that's how they they live. And I had I'm like n when I go to Australia, I never seen nobody cut no ant or do nothing like that. And um and you know I read the quote and uh I said you know I'm sure this happens somewhere. I don't know if it's happening in Africa. I don't know where you know where where all this is connected. I said but brother Random said it's happening so it's happening. And um so I read the quote and I said there were two things. The first is I said this quote um actually was the thing that liberated me and my thought process of going to Australia because I was getting tired of the the journey. Uh but this time God gave us a different route that we took that made it a lot easier you know on the body and uh but I I said this quote liberated me and I realized because he said in quote there not only are ministers coming down praying playing the tapes but he said there are ministers that are interpreting what is on the tapes and I realized I was fitting right in that category. I like to read those quotes and interpret what is actually on the tapes. Right? So uh I realized that you know okay we done stepped into the vision and uh and I said so if the if the prophet said ministers are going down then I'm one of those ministers that's going down to do that. So I felt very you know free to commit myself as long as the Lord gives me health &gt;&gt; and as long as the Lord gives me strength I will be heading to Australia. Amen. So, anybody want to go uh you're welcome uh to get in on this. And uh after I I made that comment and one of the sisters had come to me and she says, "Brother Jack," and this is her first year actually in the meetings. And uh she come to me and she says, "Uh, brother Jack, I want to tell you that my father ministers to people in the bush land, the Aboriginal people, and they do exactly brother Brandham said that they do." So, I'm like, "Wow." Oh, I mean, I didn't know that this quote was actually real, you know, but uh and she said that's exactly what happens in in in the bush here in Australia. I said, well, praise the Lord. So, I know I'm I'm I'm I'm in the word. Amen. And the other thing that the prophet told us that anytime you go on the mission field, you're always in the perfect will of God. Amen. And the reason being is because he told us to go into Amen. uh all the world and to preach the gospel and going to Australia is on the other side of the world. They already into Thursday. They almost halfway done with Thursday and we we uh we you know trying to finish up Wednesday. So uh but we we thank God it was good to be there. Anybody else want to share a testimony? Come on, brother. And and sister after after No, you come on, brother. And then she'll come after you. Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you. Um I'd like to uh echo our dear sister in terms of the trip. Um going to Australia was a wonderful time. uh appreciate the Lord and allow us to experience that. It was my first time going to Australia as well. Um but uh I just wanted to give thanks to the Lord and praise the Lord for one of the something that happened while I was there. Um, I did um I came before you um a while back and I I told you that um that the Lord had done something for me and my family in that um when I was in the military um I had gotten um a disability rating of 90% and um he um um eventually the Lord increase that disability to 100%. Um, and they did that in 2020. And so when they did that, that allowed my um my kids to get educational benefits during that time. Um but they also when um when they did that they backdated it to when um tw um 2011. So um that backdating of the 2011 100% with that comes back pay. So when I was in Australia um they had gone through the process. So in 2024 they had um notified us notified me that they were they had approved it to backdated to 2020 and they my kids had already started school but they I've been waiting for them to go through the process since December of 2024 and so all this time I've just been watching and watching and waiting to see what was going to happen. But when I was in Australia, I kind of just happened to I wasn't looking for that. I was just opening up my my um my app and looking at my account. And then when I opened it up and I looked and I was like, "Oo, whoa, wait a minute here. Something's a lot is different here." And so this back pay is goes back Uh it was for nine years of back pay that they uh that popped into my account while we were there in Octure. So this is the our theme is the overflow. &gt;&gt; That was like a over overflow. [applause] &gt;&gt; So I just want to thank the Lord for the overflow. God bless you. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; CERTAINLY UM THE Lord gave us that theme at the beginning of the year about overflow and we're still hearing testimonies of what God is doing. And as Sister Brown said, one testimony will lead to another testimony. And uh while we were there in Australia, I was just sharing how I heard a preacher out of um out of um Zimbabwe, I believe, in the in the meetings in Dubai. He said he prayed a simple prayer. He said, "Lord, I need cash." And um and God heard that prayer &gt;&gt; and began to open up doors and send that brother cash. Uh so you know I I said when I heard that prayer &gt;&gt; I said I I'm using the same prayer. Lord I need cash. &gt;&gt; And um but God is God is God is able. We also mentioned how, you know, there there are a couple blessings God wants you to have. One is from the upper springs and that's what brother Mark was referring to tonight. We got to have that the spiritual blessings that that's that's more important than anything else, right? We got to have that. So, but while you're living on earth, he also has blessings in the Nether Springs for you. And uh we want those, too. Amen. I want all that God got for me. Amen. and I want all that God got for me. So, uh, thank God for the nether spring blessing that our brother just received. Sister Amanda, Amen. I saw your hand up. Praise the Lord. Amen. We thank God for all things. Now, some of y'all going to go looking at your account. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. God bless you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to try to get through this without one tear shed. Okay. I just wanted to come and give thanks to God because um as you all know not too long ago my father passed and um without giving too much detail that relationship was very strained and so with his passing it it brought about a lot of other issues for me. Um but I wanted to thank God because through everything he's been such a comfort and um you know there will be times during the day that I I um think of him for for something you know a lot of things because I grew up here. So lots of places and faces and things remind me of him and um you know instead of breaking down because of the sorrow and the loss and the sadness that comes with him leaving um I've just been able to have peace and just thank God because I know that because I love him and um he's just so precious to me. I know where he is. I know I'll see him again. And I also wanted to thank God because he gave me my wonderful husband who has been there every single time I've cried and every time I've called him and I'm like I'm at the gym and I don't want to cry and I need to talk to you. U every every time I've needed support he's been there and I just wanted to thank God for that because um that's a blessing. So, I just give praise to God and thank him [clears throat] for being there for me and being the biggest um positive thing in my life. [applause] &gt;&gt; Just hang right there for me one second. I I got a a prayer request and uh I want to uh uh pray over this request and it's your husband asking prayer for you. So I want to do that. All right. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. God is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Anybody else before we depart tonight? Okay. Come on, brother. Come on. Amen. Amen. Um, God bless you church. I just ask in prayer uh for brother Jeremiah. He's been uh having uh some irritation. um it seems like in his eyes. Uh but the past few days his eyes has been very swollen. Um very red. Uh today is is probably the only day that uh it's kind of gone down, but it's bothering him. You know, he looks different and we can we can tell we have an appointment with him to bring him in um for uh to his doctor tomorrow. Um, so we're trusting that, uh, whatever it is, they'll be able to, you know, find that everything's all right. But we just ask that for your prayers. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Let's anoint him with oil as well. Anybody else need prayer tonight? Amen. If you do, just come on up. We'll anoint you with oil. Amen. We'll pray over you. We believe in praying &gt;&gt; for the sick. We believe in that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Uh I believe that even now he's troubling the water and uh people got in tonight. We're expecting to hear testimonies of what God did on that Wednesday night that brother Mark preached even now he's troubling the waters. Amen. God God is good. Amen. Let us have a word of prayer. Amen. Before we dismiss, Father, we are grateful Lord for uh the word that we heard here tonight. And Lord, we even see, Lord, just results from what uh was ministered to our hearts. It wasn't by chance. It wasn't by accident that you allowed this to to happen. So, Father, we're asking that you, Lord Jesus, would get the glory from what would come forth from the word that was spoken. Um thank you, Father, for victory in the lives of the people. Thank you for healing virtue flowing through each and every circumstance and situation knowing there is nothing too hard for you God. No matter what it is that we're facing, Lord, we're trusting you and believing you.

May you meet us in a very very special way. Uh may the Holy Spirit just come, Father, and Lord just anoint us. Uh um and and Lord, just allow us, Father, to receive uh from you as we would also listen to the uh tape on Friday night in our homes. God, speak to us through the word that is spoken uh through your prophet. And we trust oh God that you would just get glory out of that uh time that we will share with you as uh brother Maris and his family preparing for this weekend Lord and uh Lord this homegoing service for his grandmother.

Help his grandfather Lord and just many others in the family that are that are enduring this loss. help them. We remember uh Sister Amanda and her family also during this time, Lord, and their loss. And pray that you would just continue to give strength and comfort uh to each one daily.
