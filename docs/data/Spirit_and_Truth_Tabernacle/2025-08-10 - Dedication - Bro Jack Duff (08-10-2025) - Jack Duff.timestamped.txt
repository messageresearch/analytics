[27:20] just pray that you anoint your children,
[27:22] Lord God, to be all you would have them
[27:24] to be. That somebody will see Jesus. And
[27:27] Father, we pray, Lord God, over our
[27:29] giving, Lord Jesus. We bring, Lord,
[27:32] Lord, with a cheerful heart, loing, Lord
[27:34] God, that you have blessed us in so many
[27:36] different ways, Lord God. Lord God, you

[27:41] financially, Lord God, you have blessed
[27:44] us in so many ways. the meetings, Lord,
[27:46] that we just came out. The revival that

[27:52] whole heart, Lord. Father, there are so
[27:54] many precious promises associated with
[27:56] our giving. And we know that we cannot
[27:58] outgive, God. So, Father God, we just
[28:01] pray, Lord, bless our giving. May it be
[28:03] used for the upbuilding of the kingdom.
[28:05] Lord God, may you bless the giver, each
[28:06] one. And those that did not have to
[28:08] give, Lord, Father, move in their lives,
[28:11] Lord. Do something special to them,
[28:13] Lord. Oh father, that there may there
[28:15] they may be able to give in abundance.

[39:32] passages of scripture this morning. Um
[39:36] as you all are aware, this is my first
[39:39] time preaching. Uh we had all the guest
[39:42] ministers coming through and I was going
[39:44] to ride them all out.
[39:47] Uh but but um you know being that it's
[39:50] our our first service that I'm
[39:52] ministering here uh on today and um I
[39:56] had a couple things in my heart but I
[39:59] felt compelled to uh settle with uh a
[40:03] dedication
[40:04] um sermon today because the Lord has
[40:08] blessed us with a new place to worship
[40:11] and uh we want to dedicate this uh to
[40:14] him for his glory. for his honor. Amen.
[40:17] So, let's just read a couple scriptures
[40:20] uh and we'll just Our sermon title today
[40:23] is actually dedication. Amen. Praise the
[40:27] Lord. Um
[40:29] 2 Chronicles chapter 5.
[40:33] Praise the Lord.
[40:38] And uh later we'll read Acts chapter 7.
[40:41] The Bible says, "Thus all the work that
[40:43] Solomon made for the house of the Lord
[40:47] was finished. And Solomon
[40:50] brought it all uh brought in all the
[40:52] things that David his father had
[40:54] dedicated and the silver and the gold
[40:57] and all the instruments put he among the
[41:00] treasures of the house of God." Then
[41:02] Solomon assembled the uh elders of
[41:05] Israel and all the heads of the tribes,
[41:07] the chief of the fathers of the children
[41:09] of Israel, unto Jerusalem to bring up
[41:12] the ark of the covenant of the Lord out
[41:14] of the city of David, which is Zion.
[41:17] Wherefore all the men of Israel
[41:19] assembled themselves unto the king and
[41:21] the and the feast which was in the
[41:24] seventh month. And all the elders of
[41:27] Israel uh came and the Levites took up
[41:30] the ark. And they brought up the ark and
[41:33] the tabernacle. The congregation and all
[41:36] the holy vessels that were in the
[41:38] tabernacle. These did the priests and
[41:41] the Levites bring up. also King Solomon
[41:44] and all the congregation of Israel that
[41:46] were assembled unto him before the ark
[41:48] sacrificed sheep and oxen which could
[41:51] not be uh told nor numbered for
[41:53] multitude. And the priests brought in
[41:56] the ark of the covenant of the Lord unto
[41:59] his place to the oracle of the house
[42:02] into the most holy place even under the
[42:05] wings of the cherubams. But the cherubam
[42:08] spread forth their wings over the place
[42:11] of the ark. And the cherubams covered
[42:12] the ark and the stays thereof above. And
[42:16] they drew out the the staves of the ark
[42:19] that the ends of the stays were seen
[42:22] from the ark before the oracle, but they
[42:24] were not seen without. And there it is
[42:28] until this day. There was nothing in the
[42:31] ark, save the two tablets, two tables
[42:33] which Moses put therein at Horeb, when
[42:36] the Lord made a covenant uh with the
[42:38] children of Israel when they came out of
[42:41] Egypt. And it came to pass when the
[42:43] priests were come out of the holy place.
[42:45] For all the priests that were present
[42:47] were sanctified, and did not then and
[42:51] did not them wait by course. Also the
[42:54] Levites, which were the singers, all of
[42:56] them, of Asaf,
[42:59] of Heman, uh, of Jedithan, uh, with
[43:02] their sons and their brethren being a,
[43:06] uh, arrayed and white linen having
[43:09] symbols and sulties and harps stood at
[43:11] the east end of the altar. And with them
[43:14] and 120 priests sounding with trumpets.
[43:19] Uh, and it came even to pass as the
[43:22] trumpeters and singers were as one to
[43:25] make one sound to be heard and praising
[43:27] and thanking the Lord, when they lifted
[43:30] up their voice with the trumpets,
[43:32] symbols and instruments of music and
[43:34] praise the Lord, saying, "For he is
[43:36] good, for his mercy endureth forever,"
[43:39] that the house was filled with a cloud,
[43:42] even the house of the Lord. so that the
[43:45] priests could not stand to minister by
[43:47] reason of the cloud for the glory of the
[43:50] Lord had filled the house of God. Amen.
[43:54] Let us turn also to Acts chapter 7
[43:59] um and just read a a passage there.
[44:06] Praise the Lord.
[44:10] verse uh 44 here in Acts chapter 7.
[44:18] The Bible says, "Our fathers had the
[44:22] tabernacle of witness in the wilderness,
[44:25] as he had appointed of speaking unto
[44:28] Moses, that he should make it according
[44:31] to the fashion that he had seen, which
[44:35] also our fathers uh that uh came after,
[44:39] brought up, brought in with Jesus into
[44:42] the possession of the Gentiles, whom God
[44:44] drove out before the face of our fathers
[44:46] unto the days of David, who found favor
[44:49] before God, and desired to find a
[44:52] tabernacle for the God of Jacob. But
[44:54] Solomon built him in house. How be it,
[44:58] the Most High dwelleth not in temples
[45:00] made with hands, as saith the prophet.
[45:04] Heaven is my throne, and earth is my
[45:08] foottool. What house will ye build me,
[45:13] sayeth the Lord? Oh, what is the place
[45:17] of my rest? The Lord add a blessing to
[45:20] the reading of his word. Let's bow in a
[45:22] brief word of prayer. Father, we thank
[45:24] you for all that has occurred thus far
[45:27] in the service. Thank you for the song
[45:30] leading, the musicians, Lord, the
[45:33] specials,
[45:35] uh the worship. Thank you, Father, for
[45:37] uh allowing us to gather here in this
[45:39] place once more this morning. And we
[45:42] trust God that as we come
[45:44] um to this portion of the service that
[45:46] you would minister to every heart, to
[45:48] every need uh through the word. It's the
[45:50] word that sets the captives free. And
[45:53] father, may you have the preeminence uh
[45:55] even at this moment. It's in Jesus name
[45:58] we pray. Amen. Amen. You can be seated.
[46:02] Amen. In the presence of the Lord.
[46:04] Again, uh our uh title today, Amen. is
[46:09] dedication. Amen. Dedication.
[46:13] Praise the Lord. Um, praise God. Also
[46:17] good to have Sister Gwenna with us.
[46:19] Amen. She's getting some extra time with
[46:22] the grandchildren.
[46:24] Amen. We thank God. Thank God for her.
[46:26] Um, so as we uh just journey here, we we
[46:31] are very very grateful for the Lord
[46:33] opening this new door for us. Amen. For
[46:36] a place of fellowship. Um and and I I
[46:40] did want to say uh thank you to all of
[46:42] Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. You all
[46:44] have been ride or dice. Amen. You have
[46:48] you have uh uh run with us. Amen. This
[46:51] race uh we we uh those that don't know,
[46:55] we actually started uh the church in our
[46:58] home over 20some years ago. But the
[47:00] first building we had was actually here
[47:02] in the city of Green Acres. Uh right off
[47:05] Lakew Worth Road is where we where we
[47:07] started. Uh then the Lord took us uh
[47:09] there to West Palm Beach there off of um
[47:13] uh Hill Road and we were there for
[47:15] roughly 13 years and from there we moved
[47:18] to the school and we were in the school
[47:19] for 4 years. August would have
[47:21] represented four years there in the
[47:23] school and uh as we read the scripture
[47:25] there they began to um do the dedication
[47:29] in the seventh month. And if you all
[47:32] recall, our first service here was
[47:34] actually in the seventh month on the
[47:37] 30th day that we came here, right? Uh so
[47:41] um you know, so after 4 years there in
[47:43] the school, now the Lord has opened up
[47:45] this new door uh for us to be in
[47:47] fellowship here at Eagle's Rest and
[47:49] we're very grateful uh for the church
[47:51] opening their door for us to be able to
[47:53] have fellowship here. Uh but we want to
[47:56] since God has given us place this place,
[47:58] we want to dedicate it. Amen to uh the
[48:02] presence of the Lord and the glory of
[48:04] the Lord. Uh this word dedication has
[48:06] multiple meanings. Uh one is uh is the
[48:10] quality of being dedicated or committed
[48:14] to a task or a purpose. So uh my
[48:18] objective in bringing this sermon is not
[48:21] necessarily to dedicate a physical
[48:24] building
[48:26] but uh I pray that this sermon would
[48:28] cause uh your beings
[48:32] to become dedicated to a cause or
[48:36] committed to a task or a purpose and
[48:38] that is the kingdom of God. Amen. The
[48:41] other uh definition for this word
[48:43] dedication is the action of dedicating a
[48:45] church or other building. Amen. So these
[48:48] are definitions and we are doing both of
[48:50] these. Brother Brandham makes a
[48:52] statement. Amen. Uh in the spurnian
[48:55] church age and as I mentioned to you all
[48:57] I'm I'm very grateful for all of you all
[48:59] just being a part of this journey with
[49:01] us. You didn't complain. You just roll
[49:03] right with us and we we really
[49:05] appreciate it. Amen. Really appreciate
[49:07] uh the hearts of God's people. Spurnian
[49:10] church age. Brother Brandon makes a
[49:11] statement here. He says, "Now a church
[49:14] says the church name is associated with
[49:20] the nature of its character."
[49:22] Amen. Did Did the brothers give the
[49:25] quotes?
[49:27] Did we give them the quotes? Okay. All
[49:28] right. The the church name is associated
[49:32] with the nature of his character. And
[49:35] and I like this statement that brother
[49:37] Brandham is making because uh oftent
[49:40] times when people are deciding to pick a
[49:43] church uh it's very important that you
[49:46] kind of uh understand that a church name
[49:50] has a certain character associated with
[49:52] that name.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. So so
[49:56] so sometimes you can tell a lot about a
[49:58] church if you just look at the name.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And brother brother Gwena uh
[50:04] picked it up on on um on u um Wednesday
[50:07] night as he was just talk preaching in
[50:09] his sermon. Uh the name of the church
[50:11] spirit and truth tabernacle ought to
[50:14] tell you something.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; It tells you exactly where we stand. Not
[50:18] not not only do we believe amen in uh
[50:21] the supernatural moving of the spirit of
[50:23] God. Amen. But we believe things must be
[50:26] based upon the word of God. That that
[50:29] allows us not to go off into chaos.
[50:32] Hallelujah. But it keeps us right in the
[50:34] middle of the road. The the the name of
[50:36] the church is associated with its
[50:39] character.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; It says, did you notice the Smyrna
[50:44] meaning bitter? And you notice each one
[50:46] of the church now the church name has
[50:48] something to do with the character of
[50:50] the church. Says I could say something
[50:52] here and I better not because you get me
[50:54] wrong. He says your name does too.
[50:57] Right.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Right. You might not know it but it
[50:59] does. Oh yeah. You say now it's
[51:01] numerology. No, it's not. When Jacob was
[51:04] born, they called him Jacob, which was
[51:06] supplant. Uh but when he wrestled with
[51:08] the angel of God, changed his name to
[51:11] Israel, a prince. Is that right? Saul
[51:14] was Saul of Tarsus, a mean fellow. But
[51:16] when he come to Jesus, he he he's called
[51:19] Paul. Simon's name was Simon. When he
[51:21] come to Jesus, he was called Peter, a
[51:23] little stone. Oh, yes, sir. Your name
[51:25] associates what you are. It it has an
[51:29] impression upon your character.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; If your your your name that your parents
[51:34] gave you at birth has an impression upon
[51:37] your character also the name of the
[51:39] church will have amen will be a part of
[51:41] its character.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You'll know a lot about just
[51:45] about the church if you just look at the
[51:47] name. Yes, sir.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, hallelujah. Let's go on
[51:50] here in the message dedication. Brother
[51:52] Random makes a a statement uh that I
[51:55] think is very uh precious to me. Uh he
[51:58] says uh now we are grateful. He says
[52:02] that God has given this place to these
[52:05] people and I'm trusting that it will be
[52:08] a great lighthouse in this part of the
[52:11] country. Amen. And he goes on, he says,
[52:13] "Now many times people think that we see
[52:17] a congregation and they think, well,
[52:20] this little church won't hold very many
[52:22] people." He says, "And I believe brother
[52:26] uh uh LG told me or some uh some way in
[52:30] this congregation is about 70 or 80
[52:33] people and something on that order. I
[52:36] may be a little under or a little over,
[52:39] but it's somewhere around there just
[52:42] starting off. I like I like that because
[52:45] this 70 80 kind of you know when they
[52:47] asked us about uh this church and said
[52:50] how many people you coming with? I I I
[52:51] said we coming with about 70 70 80. They
[52:54] they said you got about 200. Said, "No,
[52:56] no, about 70 80 is that that's, you
[52:58] know, we not going to tear up the
[52:59] church. We we we going to be we we going
[53:02] we going to have just just enough there
[53:03] and enough for us to expand and grow
[53:05] in." But but I like the statement that
[53:07] he says here. 7080 just starting off.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So make room for somebody else.
[53:18] You got family that still need to come.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; And and God, we already see God is in
[53:23] the middle of restoring people.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So 70 or 80 just starting
[53:29] off.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; All right. Where the Lord take it from
[53:33] here is up to him.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; And and and I was told that anytime you
[53:37] get a building, you ought to watch for
[53:39] growth.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Unexpected growth.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. He says this. He
[53:46] says, "Well, uh, they think, well, look
[53:48] at the church around the country today,
[53:51] their congregation ranks in the
[53:53] thousands, megaurches, right?" It says,
[53:55] "And may maybe some at each service uh
[53:58] uh at each service day there have they
[54:00] have thousands, but to encourage this
[54:03] little group, that isn't exactly what
[54:06] God's looking at, numbers."
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. He looks he doesn't always place
[54:11] himself on the basis of quantity.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; But where does God place himself? On the
[54:18] basis of quality.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; So, it's not the amount of people, it's
[54:23] the quality.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you, we got good
[54:27] quality at Spirit and Truth Tabernacle.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:32] I I I received a text from one of the
[54:34] pastors, local pastors. Uh he said he
[54:37] says, "Brother Jack, I just wanted to uh
[54:40] commend you all on how you all handled
[54:42] that meeting there a couple weeks ago."
[54:44] He said, "You all had tremendous
[54:47] organizational skills." So he said, he
[54:49] said, "I just want to commend y'all."
[54:50] And this is a small group doing
[54:52] something like that. It's not the
[54:55] quantity, but it's the quality of the
[54:57] people. God got people dedicated to the
[55:01] cause of Christ. God got people
[55:04] committed, amen, to the work of the
[55:06] Lord.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; It's not the quantity, it's the quality.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; It goes on to say, we see in the Bible
[55:14] in the 19th chapter of Acts where Paul
[55:17] passing through the upper coast came to
[55:19] Ephesus and there he found a church that
[55:22] was the Ephesian church which was the
[55:25] first in the church age considered in
[55:28] the revelation of Christ. It says, "And
[55:29] in this church, the Ephesian church, now
[55:32] notice this, in this church here, there
[55:35] was 12 people as recorded." 12 people
[55:39] was the number. They only had 12 people
[55:41] as members in this church, but they were
[55:44] a powerful church.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; All right. He says, "But if the church
[55:48] only had 12 or like that church did and
[55:51] completely surrender to God, he can do
[55:53] more with that 12 than he could with the
[55:57] rest of the world.
[55:59] It's the surrender that we have where
[56:01] the truth of the gospel not only goes
[56:03] from the platform but finds in the
[56:07] hearts of the people uh uh uh reacts
[56:11] back right but finds in and and and I'm
[56:15] sorry the truth of the gospel only goes
[56:16] from the platform but finds its bed in
[56:18] the hearts of the people and reacts back
[56:21] and I believe brother Gwyn was telling
[56:22] us that you know what good would it be
[56:23] to just come and just be hear the word
[56:27] you know and the word never have an
[56:28] impact on you.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; I'm just happy to be in church. Is that
[56:33] all? You're just happy to be in church
[56:36] &gt;&gt; because I'm not just I'm not coming to
[56:38] church just to go to church just to take
[56:40] it off my list. I went to church on
[56:43] Sunday.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; No, I'm here for a purpose.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; And and I can tell you right now before
[56:47] I I I'm already ahead of myself, but I'm
[56:50] here to meet God. Yes, sir.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; God God desires to have a place where he
[56:56] can fellowship with his people.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Do you realize, Amen, that the closest
[57:01] place to heaven
[57:03] &gt;&gt; on earth
[57:04] &gt;&gt; is behind this pull pit?
[57:07] &gt;&gt; So if you if ever you're trying to hear
[57:08] from heaven,
[57:09] &gt;&gt; amen, you need to come to church.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Because God can speak
[57:14] something from behind the pull pit to
[57:16] your situation. And when you hear God
[57:19] speak, not a man preaching to you, but
[57:22] when you hear God speak, you ought to
[57:24] respond to God.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; God, I thank you for speaking to me. I
[57:29] thank you because all it take is one
[57:32] word from God and your situation will
[57:35] change.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Brother, your sickness will be over with
[57:40] one word from God.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you lost a job, you can get
[57:44] another one with one word from God.
[57:48] Hallelujah.
[57:49] If you need papers for the country, God
[57:52] can change things in one word.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; The inspiration that comes from the pull
[57:59] pit.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Is able to change the circumstance.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[58:07] here you know we we we we we see uh
[58:10] brother Brandham is saying he says um uh
[58:16] not he says it it's it's the surrender
[58:18] that we have where the truth of the
[58:20] gospel not only goes from the platform
[58:22] but finds its bed in the hearts of the
[58:25] people and reacts back
[58:27] &gt;&gt; so I've deemed this a pleasure this
[58:29] morning he says and he says now all
[58:31] right that's good I'm I'm moving now
[58:33] over to God hiding himself in simplicity
[58:36] them revealing himself in the same. Let
[58:38] me just get a few of these uh
[58:41] foundational quotes out of the way as we
[58:44] not only dedicate this building. But we
[58:47] dedicate ourselves
[58:49] to the cause of Christ.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; We we want to give ourselves to him.
[58:54] Amen. We want him uh to receive all the
[58:57] glory and all the honor. Here in the
[58:59] message, God hiding himself in
[59:00] simplicity then revealing himself in the
[59:02] same. The prophet says, "Now I think
[59:04] it's our duty to make the inside right."
[59:08] And he's talking about, you know, the
[59:09] church. We we it's our duty to make this
[59:12] inside right.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let me make that make
[59:16] it very clear. We don't come in here and
[59:18] mess up mess up nothing.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; And and and and can I say it this way?
[59:24] Leave it the same way you left it. I
[59:26] mean, the way you found it,
[59:28] &gt;&gt; right? If if if if if you come and and
[59:31] want no paper on the ground when you got
[59:33] there,
[59:34] &gt;&gt; it shouldn't be no paper on the ground
[59:36] when you leave.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Right. I mean, it wasn't I mean, you
[59:42] didn't see nothing. Make sure it's left
[59:44] the way that we found it.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; And I and I know I believe uh they
[59:48] usually have that box of tissue right
[59:51] here.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Right now, when we take it down, it's
[59:55] our responsibility to do what? Amen.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; This is Praise God.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; This is where we fellowship.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; But but we want to make sure we leave
[1:00:07] everything the way we left it. These
[1:00:08] chairs, we put them up here, but they
[1:00:10] got to go back.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Everything that need to be right back
[1:00:16] intact. We put a carpet down. We put our
[1:00:18] camera. If things got to go back to
[1:00:20] where they were, it's it's our duty
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; to make the inside right by the grace of
[1:00:26] God. Amen.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bathrooms got to be clean.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. There's a lot of things
[1:00:33] we got to do to make sure it's it's it's
[1:00:35] our duty to make the inside right by the
[1:00:37] grace of God to be so grateful uh to God
[1:00:40] that uh this this will just not be a
[1:00:43] beautiful building that we'll come to.
[1:00:46] But may everyone who comes see the
[1:00:48] beautiful characteristics of Jesus
[1:00:50] Christ in every person that comes in.
[1:00:54] It says, "May may it be a consecrated
[1:00:57] place to our Lord, a consecrated people
[1:01:00] for no matter how beautiful the
[1:01:02] structure is that we that we certainly
[1:01:04] do appreciate." It says, "But the beauty
[1:01:07] of the church is the character
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; of the people."
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; It says, "I trust it'll always be a
[1:01:13] house of God of beauty." Not not just
[1:01:16] people come inside. Oh man, this is
[1:01:18] nice. This is nice. No, that what should
[1:01:20] be nice is the people that are inside.
[1:01:23] That's it.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; The beauty of the church is the
[1:01:25] character of the people. Another
[1:01:28] statement out of marriage and divorce,
[1:01:31] brother Brandham uh makes here. Blessed
[1:01:34] be the name of the Lord. I I like laying
[1:01:37] all this foundational uh material in
[1:01:39] here. He says this in marriage and
[1:01:41] divorce. It says man
[1:01:44] looks at natural beauty.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; He says it's deceiving.
[1:01:50] And uh he said that's why a woman was
[1:01:52] given that beauty for deception to
[1:01:54] deceive.
[1:01:56] A beautiful woman if she don't use it in
[1:01:59] the right way is a curse to her.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now this is very important
[1:02:06] especially for the young sisters. And
[1:02:08] when you start sniffing yourself
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And your beauty
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; if it's not used properly,
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; your beauty will send you to hell.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Your figure
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; will send you to hell
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; if it's not used properly.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. Not only send you to
[1:02:34] hell, but send fellas to hell, too.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let's look at what the
[1:02:40] prophet say. Even Even even for the
[1:02:41] brothers too, you all buff. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; It'll send you to hell, my brother,
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; if it's not used properly.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Y'all going to let me read.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; All right. It says, "A beautiful woman,
[1:02:57] if she don't use it in the right way,
[1:02:59] it's a curse to her that will send her
[1:03:01] to hell quicker than anything else."
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; It says, "I know I anything of I know."
[1:03:07] It says if she can be pretty sure as
[1:03:09] long as she stays with her husband and
[1:03:12] does what's right, that's fine and
[1:03:14] dandy. But she can take that same thing
[1:03:17] my and how she can deceive with it for
[1:03:20] it was given to her to do so.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now look at this. It says,
[1:03:27] "Notice now, but God is featured in
[1:03:30] character. There was no beauty which
[1:03:33] should desire Jesus. But there was never
[1:03:36] there there never was a character like
[1:03:38] him on the earth. Now we find out, amen,
[1:03:41] that the church character. My God, Satan
[1:03:44] and his group look after big beautiful
[1:03:48] churches, beautiful things. It says
[1:03:50] that's what the that's what the world
[1:03:52] looks at today. Oh, it's the pastor, the
[1:03:55] great so and so uh time so and so so
[1:03:58] priestly and godly walk out with his big
[1:04:00] robes and things like that. They call
[1:04:02] that beauty.
[1:04:04] But look at this now. But the real
[1:04:07] saints of God look for the character of
[1:04:11] that vindicated word.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; We're not just looking for for beauty.
[1:04:16] We're looking for the character of the
[1:04:18] vindicated word.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; And and I think we got a group of people
[1:04:21] here that Amen. that that that's
[1:04:23] convinced that we have found the
[1:04:25] character of the vindicated word. That's
[1:04:28] why we could go to a school for four
[1:04:30] years and be satisfied because we had
[1:04:32] the character of the vindicated word.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; And in that school, God gave us some
[1:04:38] wonderful sermons.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; And he gave us somewhere between here
[1:04:42] and there
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; that came right out of the school. He he
[1:04:46] put us on a journey of I will restore
[1:04:49] saith the Lord.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Brother, he put us in a year of
[1:04:52] overflow.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. These the things that came
[1:04:56] from that school. It was the character
[1:04:58] of the vindicated word.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; That's what we're drawn to.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; That's why we come the spirit and truth
[1:05:06] tabernacle.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the real
[1:05:13] saints of God looks for the character of
[1:05:15] the vindicated word. That's what the
[1:05:18] saints did in that day. when they see
[1:05:21] Jesus, he wasn't nothing to look at, but
[1:05:24] they seen God was in him. They seen God
[1:05:26] was with him. Now, I have a question.
[1:05:30] What is the purpose of us coming to
[1:05:32] church? I told you I got ahead of myself
[1:05:36] and I'm repeating this. The purpose of
[1:05:38] us coming to church and the the reason
[1:05:41] that God even provided this place of
[1:05:44] worship for us is one purpose and that's
[1:05:48] because God desires to fellowship with
[1:05:50] his people.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm happy to see you on the front
[1:05:54] row. I was going to tell you to move
[1:05:55] there.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I was going to tell you to move
[1:06:00] there. I'm happy to see you there. Stay
[1:06:02] there. Don't Don't let nobody take your
[1:06:03] seat.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:07] But but the purpose is because God
[1:06:09] desires to have fellowship with his
[1:06:11] people.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; The reason God provided this place is
[1:06:16] because God wanted to have fellowship
[1:06:18] with his people.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; God wanted a place that he could come
[1:06:22] and speak to you.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; God wanted fellowship with you. Now, um,
[1:06:29] sometimes we think the place is for us
[1:06:31] to have fellowship with others.
[1:06:33] But I want to read a quote out of out of
[1:06:36] church order to make sure that we don't
[1:06:38] do things the wrong way. The reason that
[1:06:40] we're here is because God desires
[1:06:44] fellowship with his people.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I don't know if we got that. The
[1:06:53] reason you're here,
[1:06:55] God wants to talk with you.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; God wants to minister to your needs.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; God has to have a place where he can
[1:07:04] gather us and and and he can just do
[1:07:07] what he wants to do. And only God type
[1:07:09] things. God has to have a place for
[1:07:11] that. So God has to make provision
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; and give you a place. So come come. I
[1:07:17] want I want to I want to I want to just
[1:07:19] speak to you. Yeah.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Oo, Lord.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Now, let me I'm I'm going to go a little
[1:07:25] further with that in a second, but let
[1:07:26] me first just drop this little church
[1:07:28] order in here. Uh a quote from church
[1:07:30] order. Brother Brandam has asked a
[1:07:33] question. Uh please explain
[1:07:36] just how we deacons can keep the people
[1:07:39] just in the sanctuary before or after.
[1:07:41] Please explain
[1:07:43] um how do we keep the people quiet in
[1:07:46] the sanctuary before and after church.
[1:07:49] Now here the deacons have the
[1:07:50] responsibility of keeping the people uh
[1:07:53] quiet in the sanctuary.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. You know everywhere we go if if
[1:08:00] we if like when we went to the school
[1:08:02] and had had those services that was the
[1:08:04] sanctuary
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; and and you have to respect the
[1:08:08] sanctuary.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Anytime we go in we have to respect the
[1:08:12] sanctuary. And and sometimes we get we
[1:08:14] get into space like that we get a little
[1:08:16] wow.
[1:08:19] Hello, somebody.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't want to do that. No
[1:08:22] running in the sanctuary.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, they got signs out here in they
[1:08:27] sanctuary. You know what they got the
[1:08:28] sign say? They said no food and no drink
[1:08:30] in the sanctuary.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; You know we not You know what we're not
[1:08:34] going to do? Bring food and drink in the
[1:08:35] sanctuary.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Hello somebody. They got signs on the
[1:08:39] bathroom. If they under 12, let the
[1:08:41] parents go with them.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; That way they don't get stuck in the
[1:08:44] bathroom.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. Praise the Lord.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we we want to make sure that
[1:08:51] we we handle this properly. Brother
[1:08:52] Brandham goes on to say this. He's
[1:08:54] answering this question. Uh I'm I'm
[1:08:56] going down to 149 in that same
[1:08:59] paragraph. He says, "Now now deacons of
[1:09:02] the church, as I said, are the police of
[1:09:04] the church. But the church is not a
[1:09:07] general meeting house."
[1:09:09] The church is not a general meeting
[1:09:11] house for fellowship and friendship and
[1:09:14] frolic. Amen.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; That's not what the church is for,
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; right? So if we see frolic,
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; the deacons will address it
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; because the purpose of you coming to
[1:09:26] church
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; is not to meet your friend,
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; but the purpose of you coming to church
[1:09:31] is to meet God.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; And we have to put you in a place where
[1:09:34] you can't be distracted when you're
[1:09:36] trying to meet God.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; All right. It says uh uh but the church
[1:09:42] is not a general meeting house of
[1:09:43] fellowship and friendship and frolic.
[1:09:45] The church is a sanctuary of God. We
[1:09:47] come here. He says, "Now, if we want to
[1:09:50] meet one another, let me come to your
[1:09:52] house or you come to my house and you go
[1:09:55] to one another's house and meet one
[1:09:56] another." But just to frolic around
[1:09:58] through the church and talking and
[1:10:01] things like that, see, uh uh he says,
[1:10:03] "It's not right, brethren. We come here,
[1:10:05] we get that whole thing off of our mind
[1:10:07] if we come here." Now, the the the
[1:10:09] scripture tells us in Habach 2 and 20,
[1:10:13] remember this is the house of the Lord.
[1:10:15] This is a sanctuary of God and we want
[1:10:17] to treat it that way. Treat it with
[1:10:19] respect. Uh this is the house of prayer.
[1:10:22] Another thing I I like to tell brothers
[1:10:25] uh when we come into the church house,
[1:10:27] we don't wear our hats.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Not in the church house cuz a man not
[1:10:33] supposed to come in in the house Lord
[1:10:34] with his head covered.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Right. That's the scripture. We don't do
[1:10:39] those things. So So let take your hat
[1:10:41] off outside. That's right. Soon as you
[1:10:44] walk into the house of the Lord, respect
[1:10:45] the house of the Lord.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Habach 2:20 says, "But the Lord is in
[1:10:51] his holy temple. Let all the earth keep
[1:10:53] silence before him." So, so we want to
[1:10:56] make sure that we are honoring, Amen.
[1:10:58] the house of God. We respect the house
[1:11:00] of God. Uh we don't have the kids
[1:11:02] running all over the place. If you see
[1:11:04] them running, stop them. That's that's
[1:11:06] that is a definite time to say stop.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; That that's stop. And you got to mean
[1:11:12] it. Don't be smiling when you say stop.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; I mean, my mama sometime when I was
[1:11:17] younger, mama just had to look at me.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Just a look. And if mama, if you ain't
[1:11:23] developed that look yet, you better get
[1:11:24] one.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; It's a look that mean I ain't playing.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; And and some kind of way. I understood
[1:11:34] the look.
[1:11:36] I mean, ju just just to look alone, I
[1:11:38] said, "Oh,
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; start playing around with other things,
[1:11:44] but I knew to stop what I was doing
[1:11:45] right then.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord." So,
[1:11:48] so, so let let's let's make sure that we
[1:11:50] we're respecting the house of the Lord.
[1:11:52] The Lord is in his holy temple. Let all
[1:11:54] the earth keep silence before him.
[1:11:58] God's purpose for giving us this
[1:12:01] building is because he desires
[1:12:02] fellowship with his people. in the
[1:12:04] Garden of Eden. Uh God would come down
[1:12:07] in the cool of the evening to have
[1:12:09] fellowship with Adam and Eve. That was
[1:12:11] his creation. They had church in the
[1:12:13] Garden of Eden. And we all know the
[1:12:15] story that one day God came down and and
[1:12:18] Adam and Eve didn't show up to church.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; And he had to ask him a question say,
[1:12:23] uh, "Adam, Adam, where art thou?" And uh
[1:12:25] when he when he asked, it's not that God
[1:12:27] didn't know where they were. He knew
[1:12:29] exactly where they were, but uh he need
[1:12:31] to have a conversation. they need to be
[1:12:32] brought to a place of repentance,
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; a place of restoration. Right? So, so,
[1:12:37] so here God had this conversation with
[1:12:38] him and and and and you know, but but it
[1:12:41] showed that what God wanted in the very
[1:12:43] beginning was was this way to have
[1:12:45] fellowship with his with his creation.
[1:12:47] And God still has that same desire. He
[1:12:49] wants to have fellowship with you as an
[1:12:50] individual. Praise God. Uh, another time
[1:12:53] in scripture, uh, Moses was directed,
[1:12:56] we'll pick this up in Exodus 25:8-9.
[1:12:59] Uh Moses was directed uh to build a
[1:13:02] tabernacle for God. And the reason that
[1:13:03] again the tabernacle was established is
[1:13:05] so God could have fellowship with his
[1:13:08] people. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:13:10] Exodus 25 verse 8 and 9. And it says,
[1:13:13] "And let them make me a sanctuary that I
[1:13:16] may dwell among them according to all
[1:13:19] that I show thee after the pattern of
[1:13:21] the tabernacle and the pattern of all
[1:13:23] the instruments thereof, even so shall
[1:13:25] you make it." So, uh, I remember when we
[1:13:27] first, um, when we were in our home
[1:13:30] there in, uh, in Lantana and, uh, the
[1:13:33] Lord had put it in my heart to to go out
[1:13:35] and try to find a place for us to be
[1:13:36] able to to worship. And, um, you know,
[1:13:39] my mother-in-law was the one that found
[1:13:41] that place in Green Acres. She was
[1:13:42] driving by, she said, say it's available
[1:13:44] for rent. And I went inside that
[1:13:46] building. I said, "Ain't nothing we can
[1:13:48] do with this." But when I took my wife
[1:13:49] inside the building, she said, "Oh, we
[1:13:51] can do a lot of things with this. We can
[1:13:52] do this and we can do that." She was
[1:13:54] just a visionary. And I'm like, "Hey,
[1:13:56] ain't a we can't do nothing." But uh but
[1:13:58] by God's grace, we did something with
[1:14:00] that building.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I remember uh I needed
[1:14:03] somebody to do some work for me. So I
[1:14:05] called a guy in and and um uh I say,
[1:14:08] "Would you be willing to kind of do this
[1:14:09] and do this with the building, do that?"
[1:14:11] You know, he's like, "Uh yeah, I can do
[1:14:13] this and I can do that." He says, "What?
[1:14:14] Tell me." You know, he start ask me all
[1:14:16] kind of questions. So I said, "Well, you
[1:14:17] know, I was inspired by the scripture in
[1:14:19] Exodus 25:8 where the scripture told
[1:14:22] Moses, let them make a sanctuary that I
[1:14:23] may dwell among them." Right. And they
[1:14:25] say, "Oh, you think you Moses?"
[1:14:28] I said, "No, I didn't say that, my
[1:14:30] friend. I'm not saying that I'm Moses.
[1:14:32] I'm not trying to be Moses. I'm trying
[1:14:33] to be the best Jack that I can be."
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Right? And and and it's and I I said,
[1:14:39] "It's not that." But I was just inspired
[1:14:40] by the scripture. The same way Moses
[1:14:42] made a sanctuary so that the people of
[1:14:44] God could dwell. It was I I felt it was
[1:14:46] my responsibility to try to make a
[1:14:47] sanctuary where the people of God can
[1:14:48] dwell. Not where Not only where the
[1:14:50] people of God can dwell up, where God
[1:14:51] can dwell in the midst of his people.
[1:14:54] Yes, sir.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; And my God, we we can go back and share
[1:14:58] some testimonies with you. God certainly
[1:15:00] dwelt in the midst of his people.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; I remember a service there. Uh the Holy
[1:15:05] Ghost came down. One sister was passing
[1:15:07] out and another sister went to try to
[1:15:10] catch her and by the time she got up on
[1:15:12] her, she felt the power of God so strong
[1:15:14] she couldn't touch her.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; I mean, man, we had we had some services
[1:15:19] everywhere we've gone. We seen God do
[1:15:22] great things. God wants to dwell in the
[1:15:24] midst of his people. And if we've seen
[1:15:26] him do it in the past, hallelujah, I'm
[1:15:29] under expectation that he will do it
[1:15:31] right here,
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; brother. We're moving towards a a season
[1:15:35] or a service where the minister won't
[1:15:37] even be able to stand to minister
[1:15:39] because the glory of God will be so
[1:15:42] strong in the building. I hope you're
[1:15:44] not missing on that day.
[1:15:51] But I I said we want to make this
[1:15:53] because this is what God told Moses to
[1:15:55] do and we did and the Lord blessed us
[1:15:57] there in that in that little spot. But
[1:15:59] Moses was given a pattern, a heavenly
[1:16:02] pattern to make the sanctuary. He he
[1:16:05] watched what God did uh there in heaven
[1:16:07] and then he brought it down to earth and
[1:16:09] and and the sanctuary that that that
[1:16:11] that uh or the tabernacle that Moses
[1:16:13] made uh it had three components to it.
[1:16:16] It had the outer court. It had the inner
[1:16:19] court. And it had the most holy place.
[1:16:23] The outer court was where the people
[1:16:24] would bring their sacrifices. Amen. And
[1:16:27] and this outer court contain uh the the
[1:16:30] the the a brazen altar and a lather, you
[1:16:33] know, cuz what happened is that when you
[1:16:35] brought to sacrifice, the sacrifice had
[1:16:38] to be washed before it could be offered.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They had they would offer
[1:16:43] lambs and turtle doves in their sin
[1:16:46] offerings and and and this is just when
[1:16:48] they would bring their offering for a
[1:16:49] sin offering. Amen. A lamb or turtle
[1:16:51] dove. It was also a perfect type of the
[1:16:54] Lord Jesus because uh what it showed is
[1:16:57] that um you needed something, amen, to
[1:17:00] substitute for you in your place. Even
[1:17:03] though you was guilty of sin, even
[1:17:05] though you was guilty of of doing wrong,
[1:17:07] but you had to have something, amen,
[1:17:09] substitute in your place for God to
[1:17:11] accept the offering, amen, and forgive
[1:17:13] you of your sin. Christ died on the
[1:17:16] cross.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. In our place, a substitute for our
[1:17:21] sins. But see, here's what happened.
[1:17:23] When when the when when the when the
[1:17:24] believer went to the outer court with
[1:17:26] his with his sacrifice when he was
[1:17:28] offering it to the the priest, he would
[1:17:30] have to put his hand on that sacrifice.
[1:17:33] My this lamb that he has raised, amen,
[1:17:35] in his own home and he had to take it
[1:17:37] now and give it to the priest knowing,
[1:17:39] amen, that the priest is going to kill
[1:17:40] that lamb and that lamb became a
[1:17:42] substitute for, amen, the believer. And
[1:17:45] he had to put his hand on that on that
[1:17:47] sacrifice. Sometimes, amen, when they
[1:17:50] put their hand on it, maybe they might
[1:17:51] even feel the blood coming from the
[1:17:53] lamb. My God. But they have to realize
[1:17:55] something had to die in order for them
[1:17:57] to live.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Christ had to die in order for us to
[1:18:02] live. Let's not take the sacrifice of
[1:18:05] Christ lightly.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; This outer court, the the people would
[1:18:13] bring their offerings.
[1:18:15] Hallelujah. But then they had the inner
[1:18:17] court and this is where the priests only
[1:18:20] Amen. the the the priests would they
[1:18:23] were allowed to go in this area and this
[1:18:25] area contained a a golden alt of incense
[1:18:29] uh a table of showbread and the golden
[1:18:32] candlestick
[1:18:33] right and and here the the priest would
[1:18:35] go and do all the service there for uh
[1:18:38] for the Lord within this inner court for
[1:18:40] the people. So they would take your
[1:18:41] offering, take it and you know make a
[1:18:43] sacrifice to God. God ex accepting your
[1:18:45] sin offering. Hallelujah. But then they
[1:18:48] had Amen. The third part was the uh the
[1:18:51] the most holy place. Amen. And and this
[1:18:55] most holy place, it contained the ark of
[1:18:57] the covenant. It's where the wings of
[1:19:00] the cherubams touched and and they
[1:19:01] overspread over the mercy seat. Thank
[1:19:04] God for his mercy that was given to us.
[1:19:06] Amen. Uh also the the ark of the
[1:19:09] covenant represented the word of the
[1:19:12] Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:19:14] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. The ark ark
[1:19:18] represented the word because it
[1:19:20] contained the ten commandments. It also
[1:19:22] had some hidden mana in it. And it also
[1:19:24] had Aaron's rod in that ark of the
[1:19:26] covenant. Hallelujah. Now, now here's
[1:19:29] the thing. when uh that that ark kind of
[1:19:32] represents the word being that it
[1:19:35] represents the word that this pull pit
[1:19:37] is a holy place.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. It it's the most holy place in
[1:19:42] this sanctuary.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Let me just put it that way. This pull
[1:19:45] pit. That's why I say the closest place
[1:19:47] to heaven on earth is behind the pull
[1:19:49] pit.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. So, so
[1:19:52] with with this being a most holy place
[1:19:53] now, you got to understand not not even
[1:19:56] the priest could go into this most holy
[1:19:58] place. Amen. And the people could not go
[1:20:00] into this most holy place. The only ones
[1:20:02] that could go, only person could go in
[1:20:04] there was the high priest. And he only
[1:20:07] went one time a year. Amen. Into this
[1:20:10] most holy place.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; You couldn't handle that just any kind
[1:20:14] of way.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; And we got a lot more space. So, like I
[1:20:18] say, don't let the kids be running.
[1:20:19] Don't don't have one of the kids just
[1:20:20] take off running up here behind all of
[1:20:22] this. No, no, no. Respect. Yes, sir. the
[1:20:28] house of the Lord.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm warning everybody of that.
[1:20:33] Respect the house of the Lord. If and
[1:20:34] and and if if y'all see a kid, you got
[1:20:37] my permission. I know the parents might
[1:20:39] not give you permission, but you got my
[1:20:41] permission to get that kid down off of
[1:20:42] this platform.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Take them to their parent and say, "This
[1:20:46] is what I caught them doing." So now I'm
[1:20:47] just bringing them to you. I didn't say
[1:20:49] spank them. I said get them down off
[1:20:52] this platform.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Now, now see, I know we live in a
[1:20:56] different day. If if it was my day
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; and I was a child,
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about my day. Now, I
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; I would have got two beatings.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; The first one I'm going to get from the
[1:21:10] person that caught me.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; If it was one of the mothers in the
[1:21:13] church that caught me, they going to
[1:21:14] beat me.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; And then go tell my mama they beat me.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; And and if my mama Amen. found out that
[1:21:22] they had to beat me. Mama going to beat
[1:21:24] me a second time
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; because she's embarrassed that this
[1:21:27] person had to do that for her.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Nowadays, we don't get that.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Don't touch my child.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; We I said don't touch them people.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Get them down out the pull pit.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right.
[1:21:46] The high priest
[1:21:48] would go once a year. Amen. on the day
[1:21:51] of atonement and and when that high
[1:21:53] priest went into the most holy place, he
[1:21:54] had to be dressed appropriately.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; He couldn't dress any kind of way that
[1:21:59] he wanted to.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; God gave him specific garments to put on
[1:22:03] in order to approach God. God watches
[1:22:05] the way that we approach him.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:10] It says a lot about our attitude towards
[1:22:12] our approach when we come to God dressed
[1:22:14] appropriately.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so they had to the high priest
[1:22:19] had to be dressed appropriately. Amen.
[1:22:21] He had to make an offering for himself
[1:22:23] and also offering for the people. And uh
[1:22:26] and and one of the things special about
[1:22:28] his garment, he had to on the bottom of
[1:22:30] his garment, he had to have pomegranates
[1:22:32] and he had to have bales on the bottom
[1:22:34] of his garment. Now, God did that for a
[1:22:36] very specific purpose because if that
[1:22:38] high priest, not only if he was not
[1:22:40] dressed appropriately, if his life was
[1:22:43] not lined up appropriately, then it was
[1:22:46] possible that this high priest could die
[1:22:48] inside that most holy place. Yes, sir.
[1:22:51] So they would have to tie a rope around
[1:22:53] his waist and they have to have those
[1:22:55] bells ringing on uh I mean ringing on
[1:22:58] the bottom of his garment because when
[1:22:59] he walked the way that they knew the man
[1:23:01] was alive is that the bells would ring.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; They would hear the bells ringing and
[1:23:08] they knew, okay, he's still alive in
[1:23:10] there. But if them bells ever stop
[1:23:12] ringing,
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; they better get the pulling on the rope
[1:23:15] because nobody could go inside there and
[1:23:17] get him out. The only way to bring that
[1:23:19] man out of there is pull him through
[1:23:21] through that rope. That's why they had
[1:23:23] to be prepared to make sure that this
[1:23:25] man was ready
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; when he was going in to meet God.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; The noise let them know he was alive.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you something. It's
[1:23:35] the noise
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; in the house of the Lord that lets us
[1:23:41] know that the people are still alive.
[1:23:46] Hey, when God speaks something to you,
[1:23:48] you ought to shout, "Amen."
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Praise God.
[1:23:54] And back back in my day, we used to get
[1:23:56] up and say, "Kubenaba."
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; That meant preach the word.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Say something.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; And if and and if you get hurt by
[1:24:08] something, say ouch.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:14] All right.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; The
[1:24:18] glory.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; The tabernacle of Moses was a place that
[1:24:21] God
[1:24:22] had to have fellowship with his people.
[1:24:26] Adam and Eve would fellowship in the
[1:24:28] cool of the evening in the Garden of
[1:24:30] Eden. Moses had a portable tabernacle
[1:24:33] there in the wilderness where God would
[1:24:34] fellowship with his people. But we
[1:24:37] picked up in scripture
[1:24:39] that David
[1:24:42] also desired to build God a house where
[1:24:46] God could have fellowship with his
[1:24:48] people.
[1:24:50] And and and I think uh let me just see
[1:24:53] something here.
[1:24:55] I want to just bring in a a quote.
[1:25:01] Yeah, I want to bring in a quote. Acts
[1:25:03] of the Holy Spirit is where I want to u
[1:25:05] go to. David desired to build him a
[1:25:08] house.
[1:25:10] But we know according to scripture that
[1:25:12] David actually did not get that
[1:25:14] opportunity to build the house for the
[1:25:16] Lord. Now he made preparation. David
[1:25:19] saved all types of materials and things
[1:25:21] like that for years. But Solomon was the
[1:25:23] one that was given the responsibility to
[1:25:25] be able to build the house for the Lord.
[1:25:28] And um but David still had an impact
[1:25:30] there. Now, here
[1:25:33] um
[1:25:36] I want to just kind of catch this out of
[1:25:37] Acts of the Holy Spirit. This is a quote
[1:25:40] that's been a very familiar quote, but
[1:25:42] as I kept reading, it kind of connected
[1:25:44] here to the sermon here today.
[1:25:48] Um Acts of the Holy Spirit. Uh okay.
[1:25:51] Yes. says, "I believe
[1:25:53] one of these glorious days when this
[1:25:55] United Confederation of Churches comes
[1:25:57] together and the new pope is brought out
[1:25:59] of the United States and put over there
[1:26:02] according to the prophecy." Now, here's
[1:26:03] brother Brandham speaking about what's
[1:26:07] going to happen within the Catholic
[1:26:08] Church. And we just saw the fulfillment
[1:26:11] of this
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; in our day.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; In in our day
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; and and let me tell you something. Uh we
[1:26:18] we saw the fulfillment of the the woman
[1:26:21] president and vice president. We're
[1:26:23] seeing the fulfillment of the Catholic
[1:26:24] Church. And there's another thing
[1:26:26] brother Brandham spoke to us and and and
[1:26:28] I'm praying that I won't be here to see
[1:26:31] the fulfillment or if it does happen
[1:26:33] that I'll be leaving here as soon as it
[1:26:35] does. And that is Los Angeles,
[1:26:37] California
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; is going underwater.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; If all these other things have come to
[1:26:43] pass, that's also going to happen.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Uh so here the the thing of it is is we
[1:26:52] need to get ready. Get ready to get out
[1:26:53] of here, church. That that's that's why
[1:26:55] God want to meet with his people. So
[1:26:56] he's trying to prepare you so you can
[1:26:58] get ready to get out of here. This this
[1:27:00] this is not our final destination.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; And and I'm talking natural and
[1:27:06] spiritual. We got we got we got another
[1:27:08] place that God want to take us to,
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; but that's still not our final
[1:27:12] destination. We're trying to get ready
[1:27:13] to leave here. Amen.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; There's a rapture that that's that's in
[1:27:17] front of us and we we're getting we're
[1:27:18] getting prepared for that. We come here
[1:27:20] to church to get ready for that rapture.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Let me let me go forward here. So, as I
[1:27:24] believe one of these glorious days when
[1:27:26] this United Confederation of Churches
[1:27:28] goes together and the new pope is
[1:27:30] brought out of the United States and put
[1:27:31] over there according to the prophecy,
[1:27:33] then they'll form an image like unto the
[1:27:35] beast. And I'll tell you the true church
[1:27:36] of God will be drove together.
[1:27:39] uh the real true believers out of the
[1:27:41] Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
[1:27:42] Pentecostal, Nazarene, Pilgrim,
[1:27:44] Holiness, wherever they'll be uh will go
[1:27:47] together and see it by the love of God.
[1:27:51] Now you'd watch this quote now.
[1:27:54] Oh my. And and notice what he said now.
[1:27:56] Where they coming from the Methodist,
[1:27:57] Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal, and
[1:27:59] Nazarene
[1:28:01] sir. And um you last week we were told
[1:28:04] that we had to go to Ziglag
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; before we actually go to the next
[1:28:09] destination.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; And y'all understand what Ziglag is.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Ziglag is amongst the Philistines.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; And in that day would have been the
[1:28:19] enemy.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; David had to go to Ziglag first. Now the
[1:28:24] our enemy today is anybody that takes a
[1:28:27] stand against the word sir
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; is our enemy.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And most denominations
[1:28:33] take a stand against the word,
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; the vindicated, revealed word for their
[1:28:37] day.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But when we walk through
[1:28:40] this building and I brought the brothers
[1:28:42] in,
[1:28:44] uh the pastor here,
[1:28:46] he was telling me about his his his
[1:28:49] ministry and uh just just his his route
[1:28:52] that he traveled to get to where he is.
[1:28:54] He was telling about the ministry of a
[1:28:56] gentleman by the name of WV Grant. I
[1:28:59] said, 'Okay, I I've heard of that name.
[1:29:01] Said, "Yeah, I think I've heard of that
[1:29:03] name." He said, "Pull it up on the
[1:29:04] computer. Pull it up on the on the on
[1:29:05] the web. You can find him. You can find
[1:29:07] him." And I said I said, "Yeah, I've
[1:29:08] heard of him." He said, "Have you ever
[1:29:10] heard of William William Brandham?"
[1:29:14] I think I heard of him.
[1:29:18] I know a little bit about him. Just
[1:29:20] just a little bit. Just But for him to
[1:29:23] use that name, he didn't say or Roberts.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't say Billy Graham. He said,
[1:29:28] "Have you ever heard of William
[1:29:29] Brandon?" We say, "Well, WV Grant got
[1:29:31] the mantle from William Brandon." Said,
[1:29:34] "Oh, okay. All right. No problem." But
[1:29:37] here, I I I understand that we just
[1:29:40] might not be on the same page. That's
[1:29:42] okay.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; But notice the quote.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Notice the quote.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; God don't do things by mistake.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Let's read the quote again.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:55] I tell you the true church of God will
[1:29:58] be drove together.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; The real true believers
[1:30:03] out of Methodist,
[1:30:05] Baptist,
[1:30:07] Presbyterian,
[1:30:09] Pentecostal.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Nazarene.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; So that quote tells us we ought to be
[1:30:14] preparing for something.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:30:20] He says um
[1:30:23] he says they'll it says uh uh uh
[1:30:26] whatever they'll be will go together and
[1:30:28] cement it by the love of God. They'll
[1:30:30] make the body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:32] all the believers and agnostics and
[1:30:34] shallow-minded will be cast to one side.
[1:30:37] They'll go right on into the
[1:30:39] confederation of the churches.
[1:30:42] And I read the other day even assemblies
[1:30:44] of God went into the confederation of
[1:30:46] churches. Oh my. have to deny their
[1:30:48] evangelical doctrine to do so. That's
[1:30:50] right. And all the Pentecostal signs and
[1:30:53] wonders principle uh they have to deny
[1:30:55] that to be in the in the confederation
[1:30:57] of churches have to deny it. Oh brother,
[1:30:59] to have prestige. I'd rather, as I've
[1:31:02] said many times, lay on my stomach and
[1:31:04] drink branch water and eat soda crackers
[1:31:06] and be popular with God and to be his
[1:31:08] ser and be his servant of God than to
[1:31:10] have the best there is this world gives.
[1:31:13] If I had to compromise on my faith in
[1:31:15] the Lord Jesus Christ and his Bible, I
[1:31:17] believe this is the infallible word of
[1:31:20] God and every word of it is right. Yes
[1:31:22] sir.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Now he goes on he says now well watch
[1:31:27] and there how they was doing they
[1:31:30] rejected they come putting down their
[1:31:32] stones and they come to a place they
[1:31:34] found a funny looking stone. Now he's
[1:31:36] now he just switched uh in this quote
[1:31:38] he's talking about D I mean Solomon when
[1:31:40] he went to build the temple
[1:31:43] and what happened David had already made
[1:31:45] preparation for this temple uh you know
[1:31:48] years before it even was being made. God
[1:31:50] had already made preparation. Can I tell
[1:31:52] you God had already prepared this place
[1:31:55] for us before we got here.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; It it was already prepared
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; already set up. He knew just how you
[1:32:01] would like it. Amen.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Some of our mothers, they say, "I need
[1:32:06] to have myself a I need to have a
[1:32:08] nursery."
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; And and God made it that you could have
[1:32:11] a nursery where I can still be a part of
[1:32:13] the service.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; God heard your prayers.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; God knew that we needed a place where we
[1:32:19] can do Sunday school
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; because he had restored Sunday school
[1:32:22] back to us.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; God knew we need a place where we can do
[1:32:25] communion cuz he restored that back to
[1:32:27] us in the school. God God knew
[1:32:30] everything and he especially designed
[1:32:32] the place
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; so that every need would be met.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:40] When when um Solomon was in the in in in
[1:32:44] the building phase of this and let me
[1:32:47] just Yeah.
[1:32:49] uh they were in the building phase of uh
[1:32:51] of of of doing the temple and and while
[1:32:54] they were building, brother Random tells
[1:32:55] us they found a little stone that said,
[1:32:56] "Man, this stone is so uh odd looking.
[1:33:00] We don't think we need that." And they
[1:33:01] just threw the stone to the side. And
[1:33:03] they went to building and as they were
[1:33:04] building, they were getting uh um
[1:33:07] material from all parts of the world.
[1:33:09] And it was it was amazing how when the
[1:33:11] material came uh um I want to pull up
[1:33:14] the scripture, First Kings 6:7, just get
[1:33:16] that ready. But when the material came,
[1:33:18] the material had no need of being
[1:33:21] chiseled out,
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; no hammer on it. Uh the material somehow
[1:33:26] wherever it was coming from, somehow God
[1:33:29] had already orchestrated that the
[1:33:31] material would actually fit and connect
[1:33:33] with the other material that was coming
[1:33:35] from other parts of the world. It was
[1:33:38] supernatural in building that they
[1:33:39] didn't have to put a hammer on it. They
[1:33:41] didn't have to put an axe on it. They
[1:33:42] didn't have to do that. Just every block
[1:33:44] just fit the next block. No matter what
[1:33:46] part of the world it came from,
[1:33:48] everything just connected one to the
[1:33:50] other. Hallelujah. And see here, we've
[1:33:52] all come from different nations. We come
[1:33:55] from different places, but each block is
[1:33:58] connected to the next block.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Not
[1:34:02] without a hammer or axe or nothing.
[1:34:05] Everything just connects. Everybody
[1:34:07] finds their place and the building is
[1:34:09] being built for the glory of God.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my my. Some from Zimbabwe.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Some from South Africa.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Some from Haiti.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Some from North. Amen. America.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; From some from down south.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Some from Puerto Rico. My God.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Hello somebody. We come from all kind of
[1:34:33] places to build this.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; This is the hand of God.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; This is the hand of God.
[1:34:43] Amen.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; The problem was is that they as they
[1:34:45] built
[1:34:48] they got the building to almost its
[1:34:50] complete state. And when they got it
[1:34:53] there, they noticed, man, there is one
[1:34:56] thing missing in this building. This is
[1:34:58] the the cornerstone.
[1:35:01] This is the the chief cornerstone. And
[1:35:03] that that cornerstone was a was they
[1:35:05] call it a brother random call it a freak
[1:35:07] stone. It it it looked so strange and so
[1:35:10] odd that when they first saw it, they
[1:35:12] kicked it into the weed pile. And
[1:35:14] brother Brandon even said, you know, the
[1:35:16] stone was missing. So what happened that
[1:35:18] they begin to send boats back and and
[1:35:19] start asking questions like, did y'all
[1:35:21] send us all the all the material that
[1:35:23] we're supposed to have? Maybe maybe it
[1:35:25] dropped somewhere along the way cuz
[1:35:26] we're missing one stone. He said they
[1:35:29] went looking everywhere and said,
[1:35:30] finally somebody went looking in the wee
[1:35:32] pile
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; and they found this this rejected stone
[1:35:36] sitting inside the wee pile. But that
[1:35:37] rejected stone was a stone that finished
[1:35:40] the building.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; And once they put it in its place,
[1:35:44] hallelujah, once that stone got into its
[1:35:47] place, then the building was complete,
[1:35:50] now they could set it for dedication.
[1:35:52] What is that freak stone that's been
[1:35:54] pushed to the side?
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; What is that freak stone? What is that
[1:35:59] stone that that don't look so good?
[1:36:01] Don't feel so good.
[1:36:03] Oh, it's it's it's it's it's it's the
[1:36:05] love of the Lord Jesus Christ. That
[1:36:08] stone must be in the building.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, you we going to have to have love
[1:36:14] for one another.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got to push all the funny
[1:36:18] feelings to the side and we got to have
[1:36:21] love one for the other.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Once we God sees that love, that
[1:36:26] was part of the restoration because cuz
[1:36:28] you know the the the the the worm ate up
[1:36:31] the love of fellowship.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; But that was restored back in the
[1:36:35] church.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; The freak stone has finally found its
[1:36:38] place and now we can have a dedication
[1:36:41] service. And Solomon begin to have that
[1:36:43] dedication service. And and here let me
[1:36:45] just read this in uh first 1 first kings
[1:36:47] 6 and 7 uh 6:7 says and the house when
[1:36:51] it was in building was built of stone
[1:36:54] made ready before it was brought thither
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; right
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; so that there was neither hammer nor axe
[1:37:02] nor any tool of iron heard in the house
[1:37:05] while it was in building. Everything was
[1:37:08] already made ready before it got there.
[1:37:12] everything I mean that you were going
[1:37:13] through in your life before you got
[1:37:14] here, God made you ready so that you can
[1:37:16] amen make this church what it is because
[1:37:18] remember the beauty of the church is the
[1:37:21] character of the people.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; That's the beauty of the church. That's
[1:37:26] what draws people to the church. They
[1:37:28] see the character of the people.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:37:33] I I was uh I reached out to sister
[1:37:37] Ivonne recently and hadn't seen her, but
[1:37:39] she told me she had some some some car
[1:37:41] trouble and I told her about us moving
[1:37:44] and everything like that. Said, "If you
[1:37:45] ever need a ride to church, you let us
[1:37:46] know. Somebody be there to get you." But
[1:37:49] I knew that God had us there at that
[1:37:51] school
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; for a reason.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Sister Ivonne happened to be there
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; coming and she came I've been coming for
[1:37:57] years,
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; but God had had us there for a reason.
[1:38:01] when her granddaughter think went home
[1:38:03] said they having church in that school
[1:38:04] grandma
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; and she comes showing up there was a
[1:38:07] reason for that
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; but once she got locked in now we can
[1:38:12] move on
[1:38:19] the freak stone has been put in this
[1:38:21] place that freak stone that rejected
[1:38:23] stone that cornerstone that's the love
[1:38:26] of the Lord Jesus that we need in the
[1:38:28] church brother Brandham um says it like
[1:38:31] this in the message dedication of the
[1:38:34] building of the Lord. Uh dedication of
[1:38:37] the building to the Lord.
[1:38:40] He says that's where your churches has
[1:38:42] got today. You denominations you built
[1:38:44] and you plastered, you got buildings,
[1:38:48] but you find there's a hole there
[1:38:49] somewhere.
[1:38:51] What did they find? The stone that was
[1:38:54] rejected said Jesus is a chief corner
[1:38:57] chief cornerstone. Certainly. He says,
[1:38:59] "You made denominations. You have it.
[1:39:02] The rest of them is not in it. You're
[1:39:04] leaving out the love of God, the chief
[1:39:07] cornerstone. I don't care how many
[1:39:09] miracles you can perform,
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; how many prophets you have,
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; how many works of grace you do, it'll
[1:39:15] never meet or never do anything because
[1:39:18] the church of the living God is melted
[1:39:20] together and cemented by love."
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; And they rejected that stone. I like
[1:39:25] that being cemented by love. You know
[1:39:27] when when cement set
[1:39:30] it
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; when cement set
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; that's it.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; If you was in the cement
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; and it set,
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; you're in some trouble.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; It's going to take it going to take a
[1:39:48] lot to get this cement off of you. And
[1:39:50] when the church has been cemented,
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; all right,
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; by love,
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; look, the devil going to have to do a
[1:39:57] lot
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; to break that up.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; I say the devil going to have to do a
[1:40:02] lot.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; It's going to take a lot more. She
[1:40:07] didn't shake my hand
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; or she didn't look at me the right way.
[1:40:11] It's going to take more than that.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; He just walked right by me. No, it's
[1:40:18] going to take more than that.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, somebody.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. When the church is
[1:40:24] cemented by love
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; and y'all y'all know how it is.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Can I talk to y'all sisters for a little
[1:40:32] bit
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; now? I'm almost I'm almost I'm almost
[1:40:35] home. But
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; sisters sometimes take on other people's
[1:40:39] issues.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; You take on your friends issues. Right?
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz I in my household, I always use this
[1:40:49] example. I never seen I've never seen
[1:40:51] nothing like this before. I just got
[1:40:52] married. You know, I've been married for
[1:40:54] a few years and and I didn't know
[1:40:55] nothing about this stuff.
[1:40:58] But I remember one of them went to a
[1:41:00] hairdresser and all of them was talking
[1:41:03] about the hairdresser. Everybody getting
[1:41:04] their they they their appointments lined
[1:41:06] up. I'm going to the I'm going there
[1:41:07] too. I'm going there too. Everybody
[1:41:09] lined up. All these got all these women
[1:41:10] in my family. Everybody getting their
[1:41:12] head done. And one of them went one day
[1:41:16] and got her hair done. It didn't turn
[1:41:18] out right. Just a bad day for the lady.
[1:41:20] I don't know. But it didn't turn out
[1:41:22] right. And when it didn't turn out
[1:41:24] right, they came back and they told
[1:41:25] every other lady in the family. I went
[1:41:27] there and they did. They messed up. I
[1:41:28] ain't going. I ain't going. I cancel my
[1:41:30] appointment. Cancel my appointment.
[1:41:32] Cancel.
[1:41:34] And I'm thinking to myself, she didn't
[1:41:35] mess up your head.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Why you canceling your appointment? She
[1:41:40] ain't do nothing to you cuz sisters
[1:41:42] sometimes take on other people issues.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm being honest now. Brothers don't
[1:41:49] think this way.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; If if if if it's three of us brothers or
[1:41:53] four of us brothers and one of them have
[1:41:55] a a a a falling out, that don't mean I
[1:41:59] got to stop hanging out with them
[1:42:01] because man, y'all just need to make
[1:42:03] that thing right. I ain't got no problem
[1:42:05] with them.
[1:42:07] All right.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; We see it by love.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to tell you, don't let
[1:42:15] the devil use little itty bitty things
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; to break up the fellowship in the
[1:42:19] church.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; We got to be cemented
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; by the love of God.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:31] When they got cemented by the love of
[1:42:32] God and the building was complete,
[1:42:34] that's where 2 Chronicles 5:14 came
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; the priest could not stand to minister
[1:42:42] by reason of the cloud
[1:42:45] for the glory of the Lord
[1:42:47] that fill the house of God.
[1:42:53] Brother Random says this and I'll
[1:42:57] just try to wind this down. The purpose
[1:42:59] of us coming to church is because God
[1:43:01] desires to have fellowship with his
[1:43:02] people.
[1:43:04] I want to say God has provided us a
[1:43:06] place so we can come and have fellowship
[1:43:09] with him.
[1:43:11] Other thing brother Random said is that
[1:43:13] God dwells in threes and God is perfect
[1:43:15] in threes. And when we looked at Moses
[1:43:17] tabernacle, God dwells in threes. It's
[1:43:19] the outer court, the inner court, the
[1:43:20] most holy place.
[1:43:23] God is perfected in three. It's the
[1:43:24] father, the son, and the holy ghost. But
[1:43:27] when it comes to our individual person
[1:43:30] uh on our spiritual journey, there's
[1:43:31] there's a there's a place that we must
[1:43:33] walk. There's through through
[1:43:35] justification, through sanctification,
[1:43:38] and through baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:39] Justification is when we repent of our
[1:43:41] sins and and and we realize that there
[1:43:43] is nothing held against us.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Sanctification causes us to live a life
[1:43:48] that is pleasing to God according to his
[1:43:51] word. The reason we dress the way we
[1:43:53] dress is because God said it in his
[1:43:54] word. Yes.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Right. And when we read it in his word,
[1:43:58] we say, "Lord, I'm going to follow your
[1:44:00] word. I'm not going to do this the way I
[1:44:02] think it should be done, but I'm going
[1:44:03] to follow your word. You said, you said
[1:44:06] this, so I trust your word."
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Justification, sanctification, and
[1:44:11] sanctification, we talked about last
[1:44:13] week. When you sanctify, I don't believe
[1:44:15] Christians be drinking and sanctified.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; I don't believe Christians be smoking
[1:44:19] and sanctified.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. Not sanctified and
[1:44:23] living a life like that. God had to
[1:44:25] deliver you from something.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. So when we're sanctified,
[1:44:30] we don't live that type of lifestyle
[1:44:31] anymore.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; We we we we shun those things. Right. So
[1:44:35] it it was it's there's three three three
[1:44:37] things that God provides for us is
[1:44:39] justification, sanctification, and the
[1:44:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost to make this
[1:44:44] is how we'll make a rapture. And I want
[1:44:46] to just inject this because um you know
[1:44:49] recently we had a uh a um a wonderful
[1:44:53] testimony here. Brother Josiah,
[1:44:56] he um
[1:44:58] he desired to be rebaptized. He sent me
[1:45:01] a text and he said, "Pastor, is it is it
[1:45:04] is it um if I've been baptized once
[1:45:06] before, is it okay to be baptized
[1:45:08] again?" I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's
[1:45:10] no problem." He said, "Well, the first
[1:45:11] time I got baptized, I kind of did it
[1:45:12] because my parents wanted me to do it."
[1:45:14] He says, "But now I'm at a spot where I
[1:45:16] want to do it because cuz I want to do
[1:45:18] it."
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Okay, brothers, no
[1:45:22] problem." Said, "We'll we'll we'll we'll
[1:45:24] get something set up." So, uh, I knew
[1:45:26] that, you know, he had this desire. And
[1:45:28] a few weeks had gone by. And then
[1:45:31] another brother approached me, you know,
[1:45:32] he says, "Brother Jack, I want to be
[1:45:34] baptized." I said, "Wow." I said,
[1:45:37] "Brother, we going to get you to the
[1:45:38] water quick." So, you know, I set up the
[1:45:40] next week for that brother to be
[1:45:41] baptized. called me like the day before
[1:45:44] and he says, "Brother Jack, I got
[1:45:45] something come up. I can't be baptized."
[1:45:47] And I had already told Brother Josiah,
[1:45:48] "Hey, I'm going to baptize this brother.
[1:45:50] I will baptize both of y'all at the same
[1:45:52] time." So, uh, the other brother
[1:45:53] couldn't do it. Brother Josiah. And
[1:45:55] after we left church that day, I said,
[1:45:56] "Brother Josiah, it is thundering
[1:45:58] lightning." And I said, "Brother, we
[1:46:00] have to just delay it a little bit." He
[1:46:02] says, "Okay." So, he went home and he
[1:46:05] text me says, "Pastor, can I be baptized
[1:46:08] next Sunday?"
[1:46:10] I said, "No." I said, "You come today
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; at 7:00 tonight. Meet me at my house.
[1:46:16] We're going to baptize you today.
[1:46:17] Somebody want to be baptized like that.
[1:46:19] You get you make time and you get them
[1:46:21] in the water."
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Josiah came and we baptized
[1:46:26] him and and I never even announced it to
[1:46:28] the church. Nobody even knew. But some
[1:46:30] of some of the brothers knew cuz he told
[1:46:31] them about it and they were witnesses of
[1:46:33] him being baptized. His mom and his dad
[1:46:35] was there. So he come and we baptized
[1:46:37] him and prayed for him and and and
[1:46:39] brother Brandham told us that when we're
[1:46:41] baptized
[1:46:42] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:46:45] we've repented and we've done everything
[1:46:46] we're supposed to, he says, then God is
[1:46:48] obligated
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; to fill us with the Holy Ghost.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; So brother Josiah had become an a
[1:46:55] candidate for God to actually fill him
[1:46:57] with the Holy Ghost. So here in our
[1:47:00] meetings,
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad it happened in our meetings
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; cuz I always hear about people going to
[1:47:06] other places and receiving an experience
[1:47:08] with God. But you can have an experience
[1:47:10] with God right here
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; if you come with the right expectation.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; And while brother Gwyn was up there
[1:47:17] preaching, Amen. And uh uh uh and and he
[1:47:20] asks us just to begin to pray. Amen. and
[1:47:23] begin to uh uh just ask God for
[1:47:25] whatever. Brother Solomon's in the front
[1:47:27] asking God to fill his children with the
[1:47:29] Holy Ghost.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; And by the time he finished praying
[1:47:32] here, Brother Troy taps him on the
[1:47:33] shoulder and say, "I need to let you
[1:47:34] know your son just got filled with the
[1:47:38] Holy Ghost."
[1:47:42] Right there in those meetings,
[1:47:45] right there in those meetings, God came
[1:47:47] down and filled one of our young people
[1:47:49] with the Holy Ghost.
[1:47:51] Now look, I want I want to wet the
[1:47:53] appetite of some of the other young
[1:47:54] people. If if you if you have not
[1:47:56] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:47:58] say, "Lord, you did it for Brother
[1:47:59] Josiah."
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; And I know you have no respect of
[1:48:04] persons. I'm looking for you to do the
[1:48:05] same thing for me. God is still filling
[1:48:08] people with the Holy Ghost.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost gives you power to live
[1:48:14] right.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Without the Holy Ghost, you're not going
[1:48:18] to be able to make it. Amen.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Cuz the devil going to throw everything
[1:48:21] in your direction.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; If you want to be able to withstand
[1:48:24] every onslaught of the enemy, you're
[1:48:27] going to need the same thing Jesus had.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; That's the spirit and the word.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; And that's why we we preach the spirit
[1:48:34] and the word at spirit and
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; truth.
[1:48:39] Hallelujah.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; The question that
[1:48:45] Stephen asked in Acts chapter 7
[1:48:49] verse 48.
[1:48:52] How be it the most high? We know Solomon
[1:48:54] built him a temple and Moses had a a
[1:48:57] tabernacle. But but but the question was
[1:48:59] asked. How be it the most high dwelleth
[1:49:01] not in temples
[1:49:04] made with hands
[1:49:06] as saith the prophet.
[1:49:09] Heaven is my throne
[1:49:11] and the earth is my foottool. But the
[1:49:14] question is,
[1:49:16] what house
[1:49:19] will
[1:49:20] you build me?
[1:49:24] Sayeth the Lord, what is the place of my
[1:49:28] rest? Let me tell you something. It's
[1:49:30] not these chairs that we sit in,
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; but it's the people that's sitting in
[1:49:34] the chairs.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; That's where God wants to rest. Yeah.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; In the hearts of his believers
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; is where he wants to rest.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; But in these temples that would be
[1:49:44] dedicated for his glory and for his
[1:49:47] honor.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; And my question to you, are you ready to
[1:49:50] build God his house?
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Are you ready to dedicate God his house?
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Are you ready to open up your heart and
[1:49:56] give him a place of rest?
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, if you've never
[1:50:02] given God that place of rest in your
[1:50:04] heart, I want to invite you to do that
[1:50:05] today. this dedication service. If
[1:50:08] you've never ever committed to serving
[1:50:11] the Lord, I want to give you an
[1:50:13] opportunity to dedicate yourself. And
[1:50:15] Lord, I'm going to follow your word. I
[1:50:16] repent of my sins. I'm sorry for all the
[1:50:19] things I've done wrong, my thoughts, my
[1:50:21] ideas. I'm sorry.
[1:50:23] My sin, I'm sorry, but I need you,
[1:50:26] Jesus, to come in and take over. And
[1:50:27] you, you said if I repent, then you also
[1:50:29] told me to be baptized in the name of
[1:50:31] the Lord Jesus. If you have never been
[1:50:32] baptized in Jesus in the name of the
[1:50:34] Lord Jesus Christ, you let us know.
[1:50:36] We'll get you to the water quick.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; God has promised that he'll fill you
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost, which gives you
[1:50:43] power to live
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; according to his word.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost was given so that we
[1:50:51] could continue the works of Christ.
[1:50:56] Brother Random
[1:50:58] made the statement
[1:51:01] and I um I want to just uh
[1:51:06] this is in the message uh dedication.
[1:51:10] I just want to read a couple things here
[1:51:12] and then we we'll we'll we'll we'll
[1:51:15] we'll have a a time of prayer for
[1:51:17] dedication. Two things that I want to do
[1:51:18] here as we bring this to a close. One is
[1:51:21] I want us individually and collectively
[1:51:25] to just have a dedicational personal
[1:51:28] prayer with God.
[1:51:30] Secondly, I need to uh pray for all the
[1:51:34] the the the young people and teachers
[1:51:37] that are going back to school. We want
[1:51:38] to have a prayer for them. Um and I'm
[1:51:43] I'm with our time limit. Uh the way I'm
[1:51:46] going to do it is a little different.
[1:51:47] I'm going have everybody just come. We
[1:51:49] got space where I can just line
[1:51:50] everybody up right along here and I'll
[1:51:52] pray for you one by one. But we want to
[1:51:55] do that for all of our teachers or
[1:51:57] students that are going uh to school.
[1:52:00] Amen. For the next year here,
[1:52:04] let me just read this and then I'll in
[1:52:06] dedication. It says, "What a shame. What
[1:52:07] a disgrace. What a dispose that Nimrod
[1:52:11] man-made achievement was brought to
[1:52:12] them. When Nimrod tried to build a
[1:52:15] building or an organization that would
[1:52:17] reach up to the heavens and God upset
[1:52:18] it, it became a shame.
[1:52:22] Instead of helping man, he could he
[1:52:24] confuse the language of man so one could
[1:52:26] speak to another. He broke up the
[1:52:28] brotherhood. But when God came down to
[1:52:29] his own temple, the church, the people
[1:52:32] when he came to them, he filled it. The
[1:52:35] temples that were dedicated, just like
[1:52:36] he did at Solomon's temple, he filled it
[1:52:38] not with creeds and with denominations,
[1:52:40] but with himself. He filled the temple
[1:52:43] with his shakina glory. Lord, let it be.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; So did he do on the day of Pentecost, he
[1:52:49] filled them 120 temples. And I noticed
[1:52:52] in Solomon when they when they dedicated
[1:52:54] the temple, they had 100 people uh with
[1:52:57] with instruments. But then also on the
[1:53:00] day of Pentecost, there was 120 there
[1:53:02] where the spirit of God came down. It's
[1:53:04] something about that. And
[1:53:07] I know we we our old church we had 120
[1:53:10] chairs. So it's just something about
[1:53:13] that. But but here uh he says so did he
[1:53:16] do on the day of Pentecost he filled
[1:53:17] them with 120 temples that was up there
[1:53:19] with him with with with himself with the
[1:53:21] Holy Ghost itself. The shakina glory
[1:53:23] broke through upon them. And then when
[1:53:25] Nimrod failed to do then what Nimrod
[1:53:28] failed to do built a temple where every
[1:53:29] man spoke contrary to what he could
[1:53:31] understand. God came down and with one
[1:53:33] Galilean language made every man
[1:53:35] understand what he was saying and what
[1:53:37] it was. So there's God to his temple,
[1:53:40] God to his dedicated temple, not to a
[1:53:43] man-made achievement, not to what man
[1:53:44] done, but what God did himself. He goes
[1:53:46] on to says, "Oh, it's silly to the
[1:53:49] people. They don't get it. They were
[1:53:50] born not to get it.
[1:53:53] So they won't get it." The Bible says
[1:53:55] so. All right. God always fills his
[1:53:58] temple.
[1:54:00] At the day of dedication, he fills his
[1:54:03] temple. He fills it with himself. The
[1:54:07] same thing today. God will fill every
[1:54:09] temple that will thoroughly dedicate
[1:54:12] itself to him. Any person that will the
[1:54:16] temple is not this building here. The
[1:54:18] temple is not one in Salt Lake City. The
[1:54:20] temple is not one not the one in Rome.
[1:54:23] The temple
[1:54:25] is you.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Know ye not that ye are the temple of
[1:54:29] the Holy Ghost. The spirit of God dwells
[1:54:31] in you. He says he says uh the temple is
[1:54:34] you. You are the temple that God wants
[1:54:35] to dwell in and express itself through
[1:54:37] it that all nations might know him. You
[1:54:40] are the living image of God that God
[1:54:43] wants to work through. He says, "And any
[1:54:46] time that any man or any woman will
[1:54:47] forget all the falsehood that they've
[1:54:50] heard in the world and come back to that
[1:54:52] line of the scripture and will keep it
[1:54:54] in line, just like Solomon did to what
[1:54:56] Moses did, Moses did to what God did,
[1:54:58] God always respected it. You are the
[1:55:02] temple that God wants to dwell in.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; I want to invite us to all stand.
[1:55:10] Um we want to just have a a moment just
[1:55:14] a a moment where we pray and uh in this
[1:55:17] prayer.
[1:55:19] Um
[1:55:20] this is everyone just first of all let's
[1:55:23] all in our prayer just thank God for
[1:55:26] providing a place to meet with us at
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; and uh and then after we do that I want
[1:55:32] you also in that that time of prayer
[1:55:35] just to um
[1:55:39] pray a just a dedicational prayer to God
[1:55:42] from you to him. I'm not going to tell
[1:55:44] you what to say. I want you to speak
[1:55:46] from your heart to his heart that God,
[1:55:48] I'm just dedicating myself for your
[1:55:50] glory and for your honor cuz I'm the
[1:55:52] temple that you dwell in. Not not not
[1:55:54] Solomon's temple, not Moses tabernacle,
[1:55:56] but you're the temple that God wants to
[1:55:58] dwell in. So, I want you to pray and
[1:56:00] let's just have this time where we we
[1:56:02] dedicate amen ourselves to the Lord. Uh
[1:56:06] we'll also dedicate this building. I'll
[1:56:08] read a prayer in a second, but let's
[1:56:09] just take a few minutes just to have a
[1:56:12] prayer to the Lord individually uh and
[1:56:14] collectively. Amen.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Everyone pray. Father, I come to myself
[1:56:23] to your glory.
[1:56:25] I ask God
[1:56:31] everything.
[1:56:36] Father, I thank you Lord that you
[1:56:37] provide this place that I can come to
[1:56:39] worship you.
[1:56:42] Lord, I just appreciate you
[1:56:46] in my father. I just
[1:56:55] I
[1:56:58] rededicate my life to you, Father. Glory
[1:57:00] to Jesus. I want you to be redeemed for
[1:57:03] all that I do. Father,
[1:57:09] Father, I want you to see it by the love
[1:57:10] of God in this place. I pray God,
[1:57:15] Father, my hands are lifted
[1:57:18] because I surrender
[1:57:31] my every
[1:57:34] Oh Jesus, your spirit
[1:57:39] Jesus I commit myself.
[1:57:48] Lord Jesus, I
[1:57:51] give my name. Lord, I give myself.
[1:57:55] Oh God, I give myself away.
[1:58:05] I give myself away.
[1:58:10] Ask me
[1:58:12] fatherus.
[1:58:35] Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:58:38] Hallelujah.
[1:58:39] Hallelujah.
[1:58:41] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:58:43] Amen. We dedicate ourselves for his
[1:58:45] glory and for his honor. Hallelujah.
[1:58:50] Hallelujah.
[1:58:51] Here I want to just read
[1:58:55] um a little something
[1:58:58] from God's prophet out of dedication of
[1:59:01] the building to the Lord. I'm going to
[1:59:03] paragraph 56 in that quote.
[1:59:06] This is a prayer that the prophet
[1:59:08] prayed. And if you all just bow your
[1:59:09] heads as we read this prayer. Says,
[1:59:14] "Almighty God, we come into thy
[1:59:15] presence, bringing to thee the works of
[1:59:18] the hands of the children of men. This
[1:59:20] tabernacle
[1:59:22] that tears and sacrifice and labor has
[1:59:24] brought its material careful hands has
[1:59:27] designed it and made it a place." And
[1:59:30] upon their hearts was the same burden
[1:59:32] that was on David's heart.
[1:59:34] It's not right not right for us to
[1:59:36] worship in this old dilapidated shack
[1:59:38] when many of us live in good homes. Oh
[1:59:41] Lord God, let it be so that the same
[1:59:43] Holy Ghost and the same articles of God
[1:59:45] will be preached in the antitype how now
[1:59:49] in this tabernacle. May the Holy Spirit
[1:59:51] move today and come through the doorway
[1:59:53] and settle upon everyone. May the power
[1:59:57] of the living God be in this tabernacle.
[2:00:00] May it always stand to the glory of the
[2:00:02] name of Jesus Christ.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Lord God, we commit it to you the work
[2:00:07] uh the works of the hands, the labor,
[2:00:09] the toils, the cares. And Lord, may it
[2:00:12] may it not be in vain.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; But many people realize it's dedicated
[2:00:18] message this morning to you in the
[2:00:20] dedication of the tabernacle. May it be
[2:00:22] Lord that your spirit will come into
[2:00:23] this place. May every man or woman that
[2:00:27] that's out of Christ when it walks
[2:00:29] through that door, may it recognize that
[2:00:31] it's coming under the blood. May there
[2:00:33] be such a feeling here of the
[2:00:35] blessedness of Christ, the sweetness of
[2:00:38] the spirit until men and women will flow
[2:00:40] from all parts of the city and round
[2:00:43] about to hear the gospel from here. May
[2:00:45] this congregation be so seasoned and
[2:00:47] salted with the baptism of the Holy
[2:00:49] Ghost until they'll be called the salt
[2:00:52] of the earth. Grant it, Lord. Hear our
[2:00:54] prayer this morning. Not only do we give
[2:00:55] you this tabernacle, but we give
[2:00:57] ourselves to you in service for this
[2:01:00] tabernacle and for this cause in which
[2:01:02] it stands for. Oh God, receive us this
[2:01:04] morning. We are your children. We stand
[2:01:06] here this morning to our feet, our hands
[2:01:08] up, our eyes looking up because we
[2:01:10] believe that the Holy Spirit is present.
[2:01:12] Hear us, Lord, and receive our prayer
[2:01:14] and receive our com commemoration of
[2:01:16] your goodness, the works of your hands
[2:01:18] as we present it to you. May the power
[2:01:21] of God take our sacrifice and take us
[2:01:24] with it and dedicate both the tabernacle
[2:01:27] and congregation to the kingdom of God
[2:01:30] and the work of his son. For we ask it
[2:01:32] in Jesus Christ's name as we give it to
[2:01:35] you. Amen.

[2:02:19] God's protection when our children go to
[2:02:21] school, when the teachers go to school.

[2:16:29] Here I stand,
[2:16:33] Lord. My life

[2:16:41] Lord, I am long.
[2:16:44] begin to see
[2:16:48] your desires
[2:16:51] revealed
[2:16:53] in me.
[2:16:55] I give myself away.

[2:17:27] Amen. Will you bow your heads?
[2:17:30] Father,
[2:17:32] Lord, as we have come to this place,
[2:17:34] Lord, and we have rededicated our lives,
[2:17:38] Lord, along with this sanctuary,
[2:17:41] Lord, you have prepared us for such a
[2:17:43] time as this, Lord Jesus, in the age
[2:17:45] that we now live in, Father, to be
[2:17:48] vessels, Lord, that can be used by you.
[2:17:51] So, Father, I pray, Lord God, that you
[2:17:54] would anoint every vessel, Lord, to
[2:17:55] fulfill your will and your desires
[2:17:57] concerning us, Lord. Everything that you
[2:18:01] have called us to be, Lord, may we so
[2:18:03] be. May we surrender
[2:18:05] all that we are to you, Lord. You said
[2:18:08] whosoever would follow you, may they
[2:18:10] take up their cross daily and follow
[2:18:11] you, Lord. So Lord, as we crucify
[2:18:15] ourselves, Lord, to this world, Lord,
[2:18:17] and surrender our lives, Lord, dying to
[2:18:20] our own wills, Lord Jesus, that your
[2:18:22] will may be accomplished in us.
[2:18:25] I I pray, Father, move, Lord,
[2:18:29] in every fiber of our being, Lord. Lord,
[2:18:33] we want to surrender our all to you,
[2:18:36] Father. We want to be available at any
[2:18:38] gi given second, Lord. Lord, to give a a
[2:18:43] reason for the hope that lies within us,
[2:18:45] Lord, to be a testimony, Lord Jesus, to
[2:18:49] somebody, Lord Jesus,
[2:18:52] Lord, that we can help somebody along
[2:18:54] the way to see you,
[2:18:56] Father. We can't leave this place, Lord,
[2:18:59] until every son and daughter of God has
[2:19:02] come in.
[2:19:04] So, Father God, use us, Lord. We give
[2:19:07] ourselves to you as we prepare to leave
[2:19:10] this place, but never your presence.
[2:19:14] Find rest in us, Lord Jesus.
[2:19:17] We are the temple of the Holy Ghost.
[2:19:20] We thank you for our pastor, Lord Jesus,
[2:19:22] that you were able to use them, Lord, to
[2:19:25] stand behind the sacred desk to speak to
[2:19:27] us, Father. Lord, we heard you this
[2:19:30] morning, Lord, and now we obey your
[2:19:33] word.
[2:19:34] find your rest in us that you may find
[2:19:37] the rest of your children. Father, be
[2:19:40] with your children. Lord, keep each one.
[2:19:41] Bless each one. Bring us all back at the
[2:19:44] appointed time, Lord. And Father, may we
[2:19:47] have perfect fellowship with you and
[2:19:49] with one another. We love you, Father.
[2:19:52] We commit all things into your hands.
[2:19:53] It's in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[2:19:56] Amen. God bless you. Our brethren will
[2:19:59] come and dismiss you. God bless you.
