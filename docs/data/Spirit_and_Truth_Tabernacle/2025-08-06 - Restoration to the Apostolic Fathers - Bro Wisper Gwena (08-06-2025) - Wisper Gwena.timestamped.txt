[9:55] Praise God. Amen. So good to be here in
[9:58] the house of the Lord on tonight.
[10:02] And um by the grace of God
[10:06] um we still got one more preacher
[10:09] hanging around.
[10:11] [Music]
[10:13] And uh
[10:15] by uh just just lower the the the um
[10:22] keyboard there for me uh in the monitor.
[10:25] Um but by the grace of God, we were able
[10:28] to just ask him to
[10:31] um if he would just preach one more time
[10:33] for us before he goes home. But brother
[10:36] Gwyn, amen, is with us uh on tonight.
[10:41] And uh I know that he as well as many
[10:45] other saints from UK have been with us
[10:49] on this journey as we have been um
[10:53] transitioning. and he was just telling
[10:54] said, "Brother Jack, this is a really
[10:56] nice place." I said, "But we so thank
[10:58] God for opening up these doors uh for us
[11:01] to be here." And and uh I was just
[11:04] reminding him in the meetings. He he
[11:06] said, "Let me let me speak
[11:10] to Spirit and Truth Tabernacle."
[11:12] And he said it multiple times to make
[11:14] sure we were catching
[11:16] cuz that was something specifically for
[11:19] us. He was telling us that, you know, as
[11:22] we were making this transition, a change
[11:24] right after meetings, it was a sign that
[11:27] God was elevating
[11:29] Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. And I I
[11:31] just take that as a word from the Lord.
[11:34] Amen. I take it as a word from the Lord.
[11:37] Praise God. I'm I'm very very very
[11:40] pleased with what the Lord is doing. So
[11:41] good to have the Murangamis. Amen. Back
[11:44] with us. They were away uh in Zimbabwe,
[11:48] but they made it back home safely. It's
[11:50] so good to have them. Amen. With us.
[11:52] Praise the Lord. So, let's just u maybe
[11:54] we'll turn change that to uh Amazing
[11:57] Grace. And uh let's just prepare our
[11:59] hearts to receive uh brother. He text me
[12:03] early. He said um said, "Brother,
[12:06] uh how much time do I have?" And I knew
[12:09] what he was asking me because we have
[12:12] always we've been on time limits for the
[12:14] last four years. And uh I said, "Well,
[12:17] for tonight, brother, we can stay till
[12:19] midnight."
[12:21] And I I just put a little smiley face
[12:23] next to that. So he knew that that meant
[12:25] no time limit tonight. Take take the
[12:27] watch off. Uh but uh but but I know, you
[12:31] know, he won't keep y'all here at
[12:32] midnight. The Holy Ghost might, but he
[12:34] won't do that. So, but we uh we thank
[12:36] God just to have this freedom, amen, to
[12:38] be able to worship the Lord and just
[12:40] enjoy uh his presence. Amen. I hope
[12:42] y'all come ready to eat tonight. Amen.

[12:48] round. One more round. Once more, Lord
[12:50] is our prayer. Let's sing. Amen. Amazing

[15:45] Amen. Shall we just bow our heads for a
[15:47] word of prayer?
[15:50] Precious heavenly father,
[15:53] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[15:56] Father, we approach your throne of
[15:58] grace, Lord, tonight.
[16:00] We thankful, Father, for this amazing
[16:03] grace.
[16:05] Oh, how sweet it sounds, Lord.
[16:08] Father, you saved us when we were
[16:10] unsavvable.
[16:13] You saw something in us that nobody
[16:15] could see.
[16:17] And you pave for a way for us to be
[16:20] called your own.
[16:22] We're grateful tonight to be called the
[16:24] children of the most high.
[16:27] And father, how so thankful we are for
[16:30] the amazing grace that you've given to
[16:32] Spirit and Truth Tabernacle.
[16:35] Lord to be in such a place Lord
[16:39] surely is the doing of the Lord
[16:43] and Father we join them in saying thank
[16:46] you for what you have provided
[16:50] indeed Lord
[16:52] your grace is ever sufficient Lord we
[16:56] don't want to be like those lepers Lord
[16:59] that fail to come back to say thank you
[17:03] but we want to be like that one that
[17:05] came back to give you thanks, Lord.
[17:08] So tonight, we just come to join them,
[17:10] Lord, Father, in giving you thanks to
[17:12] what you have done.
[17:15] Father, believing that this that you
[17:17] have done is a sign that you can do some
[17:19] more,
[17:21] Lord. Father, for I read in the Bible
[17:25] that Lord, you asked and you said,
[17:28] "Because I have said this and you have
[17:30] believed
[17:32] and you said because you have believed,
[17:36] you shall see greater than this."
[17:39] Father, because we have thanked you for
[17:41] it, we shall see greater than this. We
[17:44] appreciate you, Lord, in your goodness.
[17:47] Come tonight, Lord, and have fellowship
[17:49] with us. We commit this service into
[17:52] your hands. We ask you that you can have
[17:54] your way in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[17:57] And amen. Praise the Lord. I greet you
[18:00] all in the name of our Lord and Savior
[18:01] Jesus Christ. Amen. What a beautiful
[18:05] place this is.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; Do you really realize where you are?
[18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. This this is really really
[18:15] beautiful.
[18:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we thank God for what he has
[18:19] done for spirit and truth.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord just knows how to fix
[18:25] things for us, isn't it?
[18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank God for his goodness.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And uh glad that we
[18:32] don't have time limits as well.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; But I hope not to take too much time.
[18:39] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just going to go straight into
[18:42] the preaching of the word. I don't know
[18:44] whether you've got any projector.
[18:49] &gt;&gt; Okay. Excellent. Thank you so much.
[18:52] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[18:56] Um,
[19:03] Praise the Lord.
[19:09] Glory.
[19:11] In the book of Malachi chapter 4,
[19:15] behold, I will send you Elijah the
[19:17] prophet before the coming of the great
[19:18] and dreadful day of the Lord. And he
[19:20] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[19:22] the children and the heart of the
[19:24] children to their fathers, lest I come
[19:26] and smite the earth with a curse. And
[19:30] then in the book of Hebrews chapter 4,
[19:33] the scripture says, "Let us therefore
[19:35] fear, lest a promise being left us of
[19:38] entering into his rest, any of you
[19:41] should seem to come short of it. For
[19:44] unto us was the gospel preached as well
[19:46] as unto them. But the word preached did
[19:49] not profit them, not being mixed with
[19:52] faith in them that heard it."
[19:59] We may be seated.
[20:03] As we bow our heads here again, Father,
[20:06] we thank you for the reading of the
[20:08] word. We come now to this sacred moment.
[20:13] Father, the part that we just depend on
[20:16] you and you alone.
[20:18] Consume Lord, Father, my weaknesses,
[20:22] my inabilities, Lord. And Father, speak
[20:25] to us tonight. have fellowship with us
[20:28] is my prayer.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[20:32] ask that you can increase as we decrease
[20:35] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[20:48] Praise the Lord. I want to speak on um
[20:52] uh something that we've just been
[20:54] fellowshipping on in in in London and I
[20:57] want to speak on restoration to the
[20:59] apostolic fathers.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; All right.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; And by God's grace, I would be looking
[21:03] at personal faith at some point. Amen.
[21:08] So, as I say, this is something that
[21:10] we've just been fellowshipping around um
[21:13] back back in London. I've preached a
[21:16] number of services around this. So, I
[21:19] won't be able to get into much of it.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; Um, but just, you know, I was just
[21:24] thinking we're coming out of our restore
[21:27] meetings.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And how it's just fitted in quite
[21:32] well with what we've been fellowshipping
[21:33] around.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; So, I thought I'll just bring a little
[21:37] bit of this.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; Um, and u then we see how far the Lord
[21:41] will take us.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. But let me start from the
[21:45] commission of the prophet which is the
[21:48] scripture of Malachi 4 that I have read.
[21:51] The scripture says, "Behold, I'll send
[21:54] you Elijah the prophet and he shall tend
[21:58] the heart of the children to their
[22:01] fathers." I'm just reading the part that
[22:03] is very specific to us and that's the
[22:05] part I've marked in red there. Now we
[22:08] find in here the turning of the heart of
[22:11] the children to the fathers was the real
[22:15] commission of brother Brham.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; And we know that this was fulfilled in
[22:21] our prophet brother Brham.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; So we we have a definite promise
[22:26] according to the word that our hearts
[22:28] will be turned back to the apostolic
[22:31] fathers.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the question that I've got is
[22:35] what is it that produced the apostolic
[22:38] fathers?
[22:39] &gt;&gt; Our hearts have got to be tended to the
[22:41] hearts of the apostolic fathers. But
[22:44] what is it that made the apostolic
[22:46] fathers?
[22:47] &gt;&gt; We we know that it was the apostolic
[22:50] blessing. But what is the apostolic
[22:53] blessing?
[22:54] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says, "Renew into us,
[22:57] Lord, O Lord, such faith. give unto us
[23:01] the great apostolic blessing of the Holy
[23:04] Spirit.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; So the apostolic blessing, it is the
[23:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; So the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it is
[23:14] what produced the apostolic fathers. Are
[23:17] you with me? Now, if this message is to
[23:19] restore us back, is to turn our hearts
[23:22] back to the hearts of the apostolic
[23:24] fathers, then I've got to be able to
[23:27] conclude that this message is all about
[23:30] the Holy Ghost.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Because what produced the Pentecostal
[23:34] fathers, what produced the apostolic
[23:36] fathers was Acts two.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; Is that right? And if that is what
[23:41] produced the apostolic fathers, if our
[23:43] hearts have got to be turned back there,
[23:45] then what is got to take us back there
[23:48] is the Holy Ghost.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; Outside of the Holy Ghost, we have no
[23:53] restoration to the house of the
[23:54] apostolic fathers.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; We've got no way to get back to where
[23:57] the apostolic fathers were.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; But then I find in the message in some
[24:02] message quarters, amen, where you know
[24:04] the Holy Ghost is probably not one of
[24:06] their majors.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; All right. You find in some quarters of
[24:10] the message where people are talking
[24:12] this is the time of the word and the
[24:14] word is got to be the word.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; But that's not quite exactly John 4:23,
[24:19] isn't it?
[24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; Because it says the hour cometh and now
[24:24] is
[24:26] &gt;&gt; when he seeks those that will worship
[24:28] him in spirit and in truth.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad I'm speaking about this in
[24:33] spirit and truth tabernacle. So I feel
[24:35] at home right here. Amen. Let me say
[24:38] that this message starts with the Holy
[24:41] Ghost.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; This message proceeds with the Holy
[24:44] Ghost. This message will end with the
[24:46] Holy Ghost.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; How does it end with the Holy Ghost?
[24:49] Because it is the oil that will take us
[24:51] into the rapture. It is the distinction
[24:54] that was between the foolish and the
[24:55] wise virgin. So this message starts with
[24:58] the Holy Ghost, proceeds with the Holy
[25:00] Ghost, and ends with the Holy Ghost. Are
[25:03] you there, church? Amen. and and the
[25:06] Holy Ghost was the principal theme of
[25:08] the message of brother Brham.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[25:13] &gt;&gt; Until when brother Brham was missing
[25:15] that at the early part of his ministry,
[25:17] it ended up costing him a lot.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; It caused the death of his wife.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; It caused the death of his daughter.
[25:25] What do you mean preacher man? You know
[25:26] when sister Hope was was dying and then
[25:29] brother Brham walked in and then he
[25:31] said, "Lord, won't you just allow her to
[25:33] speak to me one more time?" Then she
[25:35] came back. What did she say? She said,
[25:38] "Billy, that Holy Ghost that we've been
[25:40] talking about." Yes, sir.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; And she carried on and she said, "You
[25:44] know why I'm going, isn't it?"
[25:47] &gt;&gt; And he says, "We shouldn't have listened
[25:48] to mama."
[25:51] &gt;&gt; When mama had said, "Don't go with those
[25:53] holy rollers. Don't go with those Holy
[25:55] Ghost people." He says, "We shouldn't
[25:57] have listened to mama." And he says, "I
[26:00] know exactly. We shouldn't have listened
[26:02] to mama." Amen. But then Sister Hope
[26:06] said something. She said, "Billy,
[26:07] promise me something." And he says,
[26:10] "What is it?" He said, "Promise me that
[26:13] you will preach this gospel of the Holy
[26:16] Ghost until you die."
[26:18] &gt;&gt; And brother Brham said, "I promise."
[26:21] &gt;&gt; And when you go into the message, no
[26:24] matter what spoken word you read,
[26:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham talks about the Holy
[26:28] Ghost. No matter what it is, he does not
[26:31] finish any message without preaching
[26:33] about the Holy Ghost. Why? Because
[26:36] that's the commission of Malachi 4. When
[26:38] God saw that he was missing the
[26:40] commission, the commission had to be
[26:42] accomplished. Amen. By the Holy Ghost.
[26:45] The turning of the hearts had to be by
[26:48] the Holy Ghost. And when he was missing
[26:50] that commission, God had to come take
[26:53] his wife, take his daughter until he was
[26:55] lined up to come right in line with the
[26:58] word.
[26:59] &gt;&gt; So this message is about the Holy Ghost.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[27:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; And what was the purpose of God giving
[27:06] us the Holy Ghost? The prophet of God
[27:08] says God's purpose we find here in
[27:10] sending the Holy Spirit was one purpose.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, I like that. one purpose that God
[27:17] himself might dwell in his church and
[27:20] continue his plans through the church.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; So God's purpose of sending the Holy
[27:26] Ghost is only one purpose.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; And that one purpose is that God himself
[27:31] might continue his work.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord in the highest.
[27:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is so powerful, church. If you
[27:39] can get to understand this, amen, that
[27:42] it is God intending. Amen. For the
[27:45] church to continue his work, it is God
[27:48] himself that is going to continue his
[27:50] own work in the church.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; If you can catch this, you can know why
[27:56] God so much wants to give you the Holy
[27:59] Ghost.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet of God says
[28:01] he wants to give you the Holy Ghost more
[28:03] than you want to receive him.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; Because it's not about our plan. It's
[28:08] not about me. It's not about you. It is
[28:11] about God and God alone. He's the one
[28:14] that devised the plan. He's the one that
[28:17] started it all and he's the one that is
[28:19] going to finish it all. If you can catch
[28:21] this, brother, sister, there is no devil
[28:24] that can stop you from receiving the
[28:26] Holy Ghost. You can receive the Holy
[28:28] Ghost even now. If you catch that, this
[28:30] is not about you. It is about the
[28:33] program of God. It is about the purpose
[28:35] of God. He started it and he will finish
[28:39] it. And I'm so glad that my God what he
[28:42] starts is more than able to finish it.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So the turning of the
[28:48] hearts is a God program. That's why he
[28:51] had to send Malachi 4. So in this day
[28:53] and in this hour, hearts will be turned.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Whether the devil likes it or he
[28:59] doesn't, but hearts are being turned.
[29:02] Hearts have been turned because he sent
[29:04] the message of Malachi 4. Hallelujah.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[29:09] Hallelujah. Then in 1954, the prophet
[29:12] says, "Brother, I'm telling you, it's
[29:15] the evening lights are shining." The
[29:17] apostolic doctrine, the same apostolic
[29:21] baptism, the same apostolic feeling of
[29:24] the Holy Ghost, the same apostolic signs
[29:26] and wonders are peeping through to the
[29:29] Gentiles like they did the Jews back
[29:31] there at the early morning. Here it is
[29:34] in the setting of the sun.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory. So 1954, the prophet of
[29:40] God begins to tell us that the same
[29:42] apostolic doctrine had now come back.
[29:45] The same apostolic baptism had now come
[29:48] back. The same apostolic feeling of the
[29:50] Holy Ghost had now come back. And not
[29:53] only were these Amen. But he also says
[29:56] together with the same signs and
[29:58] wonders.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; Why is it important that it gets to the
[30:01] signs and wonders? Because it is the
[30:03] proof of the pudding.
[30:05] Glory to God that what you are saying
[30:08] you have got it is producing the
[30:10] results. When it starts to produce the
[30:13] results then I don't care what critic
[30:15] would want to rise because then God will
[30:18] speak for himself.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; Glory to God in the highest.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. See this was his purpose to
[30:26] continue his work
[30:27] &gt;&gt; right
[30:28] &gt;&gt; in his church. That's right. Then in
[30:30] 1958 he stood and he said we believe in
[30:35] an apostolic church
[30:38] &gt;&gt; teaching apostolic blessings
[30:40] &gt;&gt; for the people for the peoples of this
[30:42] day. We believe in the full gospel
[30:46] &gt;&gt; and we believe that all the signs and
[30:48] the wonders that were spoken of by our
[30:50] Lord Jesus Christ would accompany his
[30:53] church until he returns. We believe in
[30:56] those things and believe that they are
[30:58] to be set in order. That the church has
[31:01] its order.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, I like this. We believe
[31:07] &gt;&gt; in an apostolic church.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; We believe in the teaching of an
[31:12] apostolic blessing.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; We believe in the full gospel.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; And we believe these things have got to
[31:20] be set in order.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Or do we believe in the full
[31:25] gospel?
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Let me say this must be the doctrine of
[31:31] every message church.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; Because this is not brother whisper
[31:35] saying so. This is not brother Jack
[31:37] saying this. This is the prophet saying
[31:39] this. And this is in church order.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[31:43] &gt;&gt; So this has got to be the doctrine of
[31:44] every message church. Amen.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Now when you believe something then you
[31:49] state what you believe. Not only do you
[31:52] state what you believe, then you teach
[31:54] what you believe.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; And when you start to teach what you
[31:56] believe, you create an expectation of
[31:59] what you believe.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then at some point, you will
[32:03] receive what you believe.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; Or you didn't hear what I said. When you
[32:09] state what you believe and when you
[32:11] teach what you believe, you create an
[32:13] expectation of what you believe. Then
[32:15] one of the fine days what you have
[32:18] taught, what you have believed, what you
[32:20] have stated, what you have expected, you
[32:23] will experience it somewhere along the
[32:25] way. I believe one of these days we will
[32:28] see the full apostolic church back in
[32:31] action again. But we got to keep saying
[32:34] it. We got to keep believing it. We got
[32:37] to keep teaching it. Can you say amen?
[32:39] Then one of the fine days there will be
[32:41] a full manifestation of those things
[32:44] that we have believed.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet of God tells us there
[32:50] was a time he was a little confused
[32:53] about you know the different
[32:56] denominations that were out there. It
[32:58] says there was some 900 and something
[33:00] different denominations. This one says
[33:02] we've got the truth. This one says we've
[33:05] got the truth. Everyone was saying we've
[33:07] got the truth. And the the prophet says,
[33:09] "So where do we find the truth then?"
[33:11] Then one day when he was talking to his
[33:13] mama, he said, "Mother," this is now in
[33:16] the message uh a true sign that's
[33:19] overlooked. I said, "Mother, I went back
[33:22] to the Bible and I found out the way
[33:25] those first apostles, what kind of a
[33:27] church they had, how they taught, and
[33:31] the things they did. I did it just
[33:34] exactly the way they did it, the way the
[33:37] Bible said, and I got the same results.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; So when the prophet now was wondering
[33:44] what is the correct direction, then God
[33:47] said to him, go back into the Bible,
[33:50] &gt;&gt; see what they were doing in the Bible.
[33:52] And he says, I went back into the Bible.
[33:54] I found out what type of a church those
[33:56] first apostles had, what kind of a
[33:59] church they were running, what is it
[34:01] that they were teaching. I taught
[34:03] exactly the same. I did exactly what
[34:05] they did and then I got exactly the same
[34:08] results.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; He got the apostolic results
[34:14] &gt;&gt; when he went to apply the apostolic
[34:16] formula.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; But out of this journey, then the
[34:21] prophet also found out now he's within
[34:24] the Pentecostal people. Then he found
[34:26] out those that were seemingly believing
[34:28] in the apostolic blessing, but he still
[34:31] found out that there were certain things
[34:32] that were not in the church. So the
[34:35] prophet then comes in everlasting life
[34:37] and how to receive it. And he says,
[34:39] "Look, see, everyone has always said,
[34:41] "Brother Bill, nobody understands you."
[34:44] Well, I I may be just a little queer,
[34:46] but you know, I I don't mean to be, but
[34:49] I have ideas of things and my
[34:52] convictions.
[34:53] I'm thoroughly convinced that many
[34:56] things that's in the scripture that's
[34:59] apostolic that we don't carry out this
[35:02] day.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; He says, "I have ideas of things and my
[35:10] convictions." This was a real conviction
[35:12] of the prophet. And he says, "I've got
[35:14] ideas and I've got convictions and I'm
[35:17] thoroughly convinced that there are
[35:19] things that's in the scripture that's
[35:21] apostolic that we don't carry out this
[35:24] day."
[35:26] &gt;&gt; And that brings a question, what are
[35:28] those things that are apostolic?
[35:31] &gt;&gt; And yet we were not we're not being
[35:33] carried out back then.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Next question is, are we carrying them
[35:37] out in the message of the hour? All
[35:39] right.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Do we find those things in the message
[35:42] of the hour? Am I reading the prophet
[35:44] church?
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Now, when I begin to see something like
[35:47] this, then my heart begins to hunger.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; My heart begins to ask, Lord, what is
[35:53] this all about? If if it is about the
[35:56] apostolic church, if these things are
[35:58] apostolic, then I want to be able to
[36:01] experience it because my heart is got to
[36:03] be turned back to the apostolic fathers.
[36:06] And if my heart is to be turned back
[36:08] there, I want every apostolic attribute
[36:11] to be part and parcel of the church that
[36:13] I am in
[36:15] &gt;&gt; to believe anything less than this is to
[36:17] shortch changing ourselves.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; And I'm tired of living underprivileged.
[36:22] I not even want to be part of a church
[36:24] that is living underprivileged. I want
[36:26] to climb to the right level. If these
[36:29] things are promised in the word, it
[36:31] means they are there for the taking. It
[36:33] means they are there available for us to
[36:36] have them. Can you say amen somebody?
[36:40] &gt;&gt; But what are they and how do we get
[36:42] them?
[36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Now if they are apostolic then it means
[36:47] that they must come with the apostolic
[36:49] blessing.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Therefore they must come with the Holy
[36:52] Ghost. Therefore they are hidden in the
[36:54] Holy Ghost. They are a package of the
[36:57] Holy Ghost that when you dwell in the
[36:59] Holy Ghost somewhere along the way, it
[37:02] will lead you to the apostolic things
[37:04] that need to be carried out in the
[37:06] church.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Or can we identify these?
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Now, each one of these is a sermon in
[37:13] its own right. So, I'm not getting very
[37:15] much into them tonight. Amen. But I'm
[37:18] just hitting the highlights here. The
[37:20] prophet of God in the message thirsty
[37:21] says, "And in that body is nine
[37:24] spiritual gifts operating through the
[37:27] local body, the local church." That's
[37:30] apostolic.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. Glory.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[37:36] &gt;&gt; That's apostolic. If I ever knew of it,
[37:38] that's right.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; So it means when a church becomes
[37:42] apostolic, then it will have the nine
[37:44] spiritual gifts working in that local
[37:47] body.
[37:49] And he says that's apostolic.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[37:53] &gt;&gt; In another place he says in every local
[37:55] assembly this must be there.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Is that right church?
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it also means Amen. If if this
[38:03] is what is apostolic. Amen. He says
[38:06] that's apostolic. It's it's got to be in
[38:08] there. Hallelujah. I'm still on the
[38:10] message thirst. He says that's
[38:12] apostolic. If I ever knew of it, that's
[38:15] right. And if this is apostolic church,
[38:17] it means anything that is not that is
[38:20] not yet hitting the mark of apostolic
[38:23] church.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; It means we are still under privilege
[38:27] somewhere.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; But he says in the message, God's
[38:31] provided way of dealing with sin. He
[38:33] says the church is to be operated by
[38:36] nine spiritual gifts,
[38:38] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit. He has gifts and
[38:41] signs and wonders in the church. That's
[38:43] God's provided way of perfecting his
[38:46] church.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; We try anything else, theology,
[38:50] teaching, anything else, it will never
[38:52] work. It never did and it never will.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; That's powerful, church.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; But it's thus sayith Malachi 4.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; That's apostolic.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we've identified one. Can I
[39:06] bring another?
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We take another one here. He says
[39:11] in the message, I I'm the resurrection
[39:13] and the life. And God still has angels
[39:17] &gt;&gt; and they visit the people.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Not a worship of angels, but angelic
[39:23] beings who are attributes of God sent
[39:26] forth to minister to the church through
[39:28] the people. Oh my, how short we are of
[39:31] the real apostolic church today of the
[39:34] blessing. That's good.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; So, angelic visitations
[39:40] &gt;&gt; is apostolic.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; And how short we are.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; But church, we can't create angels.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; We can't send them to us.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; God sends them.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; But it has to take a people that have
[39:54] hit a certain atmosphere. It has to take
[39:57] a people that are expecting certain
[39:58] things. You get according to
[40:01] expectation.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:04] Oh, this is a real shocker to many.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; In a day, amen, where we have had a
[40:10] message where the angel of the Lord came
[40:12] to the prophet, the moment you start to
[40:14] want to talk about angels, Amen. It
[40:16] looks like you want to go into the
[40:17] prophets area. No, I'm not going into
[40:20] the prophets area. I'm going into what
[40:22] he taught that we must have as the
[40:25] church of the living God.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Is that right, church?
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Let me read another quote. He says, "Now
[40:32] angels has always been ministering
[40:34] spirits that sent to the church." Is
[40:37] that right?
[40:38] &gt;&gt; All through the apostolic age or
[40:40] apostolic age, they had ministering
[40:43] angels that went with the apostles, the
[40:45] disciples.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Is that right? And most always they
[40:50] appeared to them in a form of a light.
[40:52] Is that right? Amen.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; So all down through the apostolic age,
[40:57] they had ministering angels that went
[40:59] with the apostles, the disciples.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Now our hearts are to be turned back to
[41:05] the apost apostolic father's hearts. And
[41:08] if our hearts are to be turned back
[41:09] there, then these are the things that
[41:11] we've got to be expecting.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Now somebody says, "Oh, that that was
[41:16] the apostles and it's got to end with
[41:18] the apostles." It's like the people who
[41:20] says, you know, the the the Pentecostal
[41:22] blessing ended with the apostolic age,
[41:25] but the brother Brham would ask the
[41:26] question, can you tell me where it
[41:29] started?
[41:30] &gt;&gt; It says, I can tell you when it started
[41:32] now. You tell me where it ended.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; If you can't place a finger of where it
[41:36] ended, then it means it is still going
[41:38] on even right now.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church?
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Back then, Amen. They had angelic
[41:46] visitations. Where does the prophet take
[41:48] this? Right in the book of Acts.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Can I take one apostolic example?
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this we find in Acts chapter 8
[41:57] 26. The Bible says, "And the angel of
[42:00] the Lord spake unto Philillip, saying,
[42:02] arise
[42:04] &gt;&gt; and go towards the south unto the way
[42:06] that goeth down from Jerusalem unto
[42:08] Gaza, which is desert."
[42:11] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord spoke unto
[42:13] Philillip.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[42:16] &gt;&gt; That's right. Who spoke unto Philillip?
[42:19] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord spoke unto
[42:21] Phillip.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Well, I can pull several scriptures
[42:24] right here because the angel of the Lord
[42:27] also spoke unto the centurion.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[42:31] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord. Now, if I had
[42:33] taken Paul or if I taken Peter, you
[42:36] probably say, "Oh, those were apostles."
[42:38] But I have just taken Philillip who was
[42:39] a deacon in the church and the angel of
[42:42] the Lord appeared unto him. Then I text
[42:45] as the centurion who was not even in the
[42:48] message.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; He wasn't even in the message but he was
[42:53] destined to be in the message. He was
[42:56] hungering for something that is right.
[42:58] And the angel of the Lord spoke to him
[43:00] and he said send for Peter. And at the
[43:03] same time the angel of the Lord
[43:05] hallelujah through the Holy Ghost
[43:07] ministered unto a Peter to say I'm
[43:10] sending people to come to meet you.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right?
[43:14] &gt;&gt; So, angelic visitations are apostolic.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Can I take another?
[43:21] &gt;&gt; I'm just laying a background to where
[43:22] I'm going to.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then in the 70th week of Daniel,
[43:27] he says, "And the messenger of this age
[43:30] was to come in the power of Elias."
[43:32] That's right. And he was to restore the
[43:34] faith of the children back to the
[43:36] fathers. bring the Pentecostal remnant
[43:38] that's left back to the true apostolic
[43:42] faith.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; So I see an apostolic faith.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; So the apostolic fathers, they came with
[43:53] an apostolic faith.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; And for that faith to have been
[43:57] identified as apostolic, it means that
[43:59] there was something peculiar about this
[44:01] faith.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; I believe that that faith that was an
[44:06] apostolic faith was in two parts.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; What are the two parts, preacher man? I
[44:11] believe that the there was the faith.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Because Jude comes and he says, "Let us
[44:17] earnestly contend for the faith."
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[44:21] &gt;&gt; And the faith, the prophet of God
[44:23] teaches us that it stands for the
[44:25] religion.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Their way of worship, the faith.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So there was the faith that came
[44:32] with the apostolic fathers. Then there
[44:34] is also faith which is the substance of
[44:37] things that are hoped for.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[44:40] &gt;&gt; And then there is the gift of faith
[44:42] which is one of the nine spiritual
[44:44] gifts.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; So that's the gift that then works
[44:47] miracles in the church. Is that right?
[44:49] &gt;&gt; It's the faith that produced miracles.
[44:52] Amen. It is the faith that was inside of
[44:54] John and Peter when they went to the
[44:56] gate called beautiful and they said
[44:58] silver and gold have we none but such as
[45:01] we have give we unto you.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Is that right? It was the faith that was
[45:06] inside of Peter that when the prayer
[45:08] lines were getting too long and there
[45:10] was not enough time to lay hands on the
[45:12] sick. They just said line them up on one
[45:14] side and the shadow of Peter was healing
[45:17] the people. Amen.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; This the the faith of Peter was even in
[45:21] his shadow.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; I wonder where is our faith church. If
[45:29] the faith of Peter was even extending
[45:31] into a shadow.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Glory to God in the highest. It was the
[45:38] faith that was in Paul that when aprons
[45:40] were taken out of his body, when they
[45:42] went to be laid on the sick, the sick
[45:45] got healed. So the power of her healing
[45:48] was even inside of the clothes of Paul.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Aprons that came from Paul, they went
[45:54] and they started to minister healing.
[45:56] Are you with me, church?
[45:58] &gt;&gt; But I'm saying that that was the faith
[46:00] of the apostles. But I want to zero it
[46:02] in and say that faith has got to get to
[46:05] a place where it becomes a personal
[46:07] faith.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; It should not be a group faith. It's got
[46:12] to come to a place where it becomes an
[46:13] individual faith where it is a personal
[46:16] faith. And that's what I want to speak
[46:18] on tonight. Speaking about a personal
[46:21] faith
[46:23] &gt;&gt; and let's start it from the book of
[46:25] Malachi 4. Amen. It says, "Behold, I
[46:29] will send you Elijah the prophet." Now,
[46:32] I want you to watch the focus of the
[46:34] scripture here. It is you.
[46:38] So in other words, the ministry of
[46:39] Malachi 4, it is a personal ministry
[46:42] that identifies every individual. God
[46:46] sending you Elijah the prophet. God is
[46:50] not talking about your next door
[46:51] neighbor. He's not talking about your
[46:53] mama. He's not talking about your papa.
[46:55] God is addressing you directly to say, I
[46:58] will send you Elijah the prophet. What
[47:02] for? and he shall turn your heart back
[47:05] to the heart of the Pentecostal fathers.
[47:08] Are you with me church?
[47:10] &gt;&gt; So the focus of the gospel of Malachi 4
[47:13] is God will come to an individual level.
[47:16] Is God will come to a place where it
[47:18] becomes personal.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When the gospel becomes
[47:23] personal, then the gospel will produce
[47:25] inside of individuals the same
[47:28] attributes that we find in the book of
[47:30] Acts. I want to say church of the living
[47:32] God, I don't want a God of history.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; What good is a God of history? We want a
[47:39] present day God.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; We want the God of yesterday to be the
[47:42] God of today, he is the same yesterday,
[47:45] today, and forever. Can you say amen?
[47:49] What he did for Peter, he can do for
[47:51] spirit and truth. What he did for Paul,
[47:54] he can do for somebody in here. what he
[47:57] did for Philillip he can do for somebody
[47:59] in here say amen somebody
[48:02] &gt;&gt; brother he's got to get to a place where
[48:05] the faith amen becomes a personal faith
[48:09] &gt;&gt; hallelujah so as the gospel is being
[48:12] preached you've got to come under
[48:14] expectation that God is going to deal
[48:16] with me as an individual I'm forgetting
[48:20] who is sitting next to me I'm forgetting
[48:22] who I came to church with I want God to
[48:25] deal with me as an individual.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; But the danger that we find church is
[48:30] people get used to the gospel.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; We come to church so many times until
[48:36] when the gospel is being preached, we
[48:39] don't appropriate faith personally.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; We can easily hear things and we say,
[48:46] "Oh, we have heard about that one
[48:47] before."
[48:48] And I like always to say that message
[48:51] people like to finish the quotations
[48:53] &gt;&gt; that whilst the preacher is preaching on
[48:55] they know exactly how the quotation ends
[48:58] and they can begin to recite it upon
[49:00] their hearts and they know exactly which
[49:02] way the quotation is going. You know
[49:03] what? You're getting too used to
[49:05] preaching.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; The prophet tells me of the story of the
[49:09] old salt.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; He tells me of a certain man that was
[49:12] going to the sea. And this man was under
[49:15] so much expectation. He had never been
[49:18] to the sea and he was longing to see the
[49:20] sea. And he met this man who was the old
[49:23] salt who was a sailor. Amen. Had been a
[49:26] sailor from his youth. He was born on
[49:28] the seas. And this man said, "Oh, where
[49:31] you going, man?" And he says, "I'm going
[49:33] to the sea. I he started describing what
[49:35] he was expecting to see." And the old
[49:38] soul said, "There is nothing to eat
[49:40] there. I was born there."
[49:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:44] And the prophet says he had gotten so
[49:46] used to it until it did not intrigue
[49:49] him.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Then the prophet says here, you see, he
[49:52] had saw it so much and enjoyed it so
[49:55] much until it become common. That's what
[49:58] you Americans have done to Christ.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad I'm speaking to Americans.
[50:04] That's what you Americans have done to
[50:07] Christ. He's been so good to you. You
[50:09] seen him open the eyes of the blind.
[50:12] Some wouldn't walk across the street to
[50:13] see it again. You have seen him heal the
[50:16] sick. You've seen him perform miracles.
[50:18] You've done all you've done all this and
[50:21] it's so common. It doesn't you
[50:25] &gt;&gt; people get used to it. The prophet here
[50:27] was talking about people getting used to
[50:29] miracles happening. But let me rezero it
[50:32] down and say we getting used to
[50:34] preachers.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; We're getting used to pastors. We
[50:38] getting so used to good preaching
[50:40] &gt;&gt; until you just know how to say amen and
[50:43] it ends right there because you're used
[50:45] to good preaching. Brother, let me tell
[50:47] you, never never get used to preaching.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Never get to a place where the gospel
[50:54] becomes common to you.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "It's been my great
[50:57] mystery in my life."
[50:59] How can the scriptures be so plain and
[51:02] the people sit there and know that the
[51:05] spirit of Christ is in the room and can
[51:08] hold your peace?
[51:11] &gt;&gt; I can't understand it lest their eyes
[51:14] are not open. He's so good.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Or do you hear what he's saying here?
[51:20] How can the scriptures be made so plain
[51:22] and then the people sat there and know
[51:25] that the spirit of Christ is in the room
[51:27] and yet you hold your peace?
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to be moved by the
[51:32] gospel.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; May God help us. Amen. Not to be
[51:36] spectators in the church, but to be a
[51:38] people, hallelujah, that are taking the
[51:41] word, that are chewing the word, that
[51:44] are feeding upon it as it is coming
[51:46] forth.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He says the thrill,
[51:50] the blessedness of knowing the reason
[51:52] Lord Jesus Christ stand in our midst
[51:55] should send every soul to the heights
[51:57] beyond anything this world could thrill.
[52:00] It should do something to you. It should
[52:03] take your faith to you would open every
[52:05] door of faith and everything else. Say,
[52:08] "Lord Jesus, take full for possession of
[52:11] me." Nowise
[52:13] &gt;&gt; the preaching of the gospel is got to
[52:16] shake somebody. The preaching of the
[52:18] gospel is got to shake your faith
[52:21] &gt;&gt; until it should take you to a place
[52:22] where all things become possible.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; And I'm talking about every service that
[52:27] you come into church. That the preaching
[52:29] of the word, it should elevate you to
[52:31] such a place that if you came sick, you
[52:34] should go back home healed.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; That if you came with an expectation,
[52:38] that expectation has got to be met in
[52:40] the church.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:43] The prophet tells us of the story of
[52:45] another woman that had a little boy.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; This boy the when the boy was born the
[52:50] woman thought that the boy was just
[52:52] normal.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; But at a certain point the prophet of
[52:55] God started to realize that this woman
[52:58] amen or this woman started to realize
[53:01] rather that this child there was
[53:03] something abnormal about her.
[53:05] So the the woman went into a shop and
[53:08] she started picking some things that
[53:10] would amaze a child and she would shake
[53:12] it before the child and the prophet says
[53:14] the woman said that child would just sit
[53:17] and stir.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Then she jumped to the next shelf,
[53:22] picked something else, waved it before
[53:24] the child and that child would just
[53:26] stir.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; And then jumped to the next shelf,
[53:28] picked something else, waved it before
[53:30] the child and the child would just stir.
[53:33] And somewhere along the way, she let out
[53:35] a scream. And the people rushed and
[53:37] said, "What's going on?" She said, "The
[53:40] child just stares."
[53:42] &gt;&gt; And the prophet then turns it. Amen. And
[53:44] he brings it to the church to say, "It's
[53:47] like us in the church, people just sit
[53:50] and stare."
[53:55] &gt;&gt; No matter how much the preacher
[53:56] preaches, Amen. No matter how much the
[53:59] preacher is sweating, Amen. But the
[54:01] people sit and stir.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; The prophecies, I think that's a great
[54:07] deal with the church today. God has
[54:09] shook every kind of a gift and things
[54:12] that could be put before the church and
[54:14] it just sits and stares in space.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Well, that was a very nice meeting,
[54:22] &gt;&gt; but it don't move them at all.
[54:25] They're waiting for the service land and
[54:27] come say to the pastor, "Oh pastor, that
[54:30] was a beautiful sermon."
[54:32] &gt;&gt; But when they were in church, they were
[54:34] sitting and they were staring. I say to
[54:37] the church back home, I've been
[54:38] preaching for too long now that I don't
[54:40] even want you to tell me that the sermon
[54:42] was good. I'm not looking for your accol
[54:45] for your echoes. Amen. I'm looking for a
[54:48] people that as the gospel is going
[54:50] forth, they are ready to jump into the
[54:52] waters. The purpose of the preaching of
[54:54] the word, it is to stir up the waters.
[54:57] And when the waters are stirred up,
[54:59] somebody's got to jump into the stirred
[55:01] waters. Somebody's got to jump in and
[55:04] say, "That was for me. That was God
[55:07] dealing with my situation." Can you say
[55:09] amen,
[55:10] &gt;&gt; brother? As the gospel is coming forth,
[55:12] it must shift your position.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; It must change your belief.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; It must change your faith. Hallelujah.
[55:20] It must prick your heart until it gets
[55:22] to a place where you will begin to say,
[55:25] "Oh my, God is dealing with my case.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; God is speaking to me directly."
[55:31] &gt;&gt; But alas, it is not so. What is the
[55:33] problem?
[55:34] &gt;&gt; The problem is what we find in the book
[55:36] of Hebrews chapter 4. Hebrews 4 says,
[55:40] "Let us therefore fear, lest a promise
[55:44] being left us of entering into his rest,
[55:47] any of you should seem to come short of
[55:49] it."
[55:50] &gt;&gt; For unto us was the gospel preached as
[55:53] well as unto them, but the word preached
[55:55] did not profit them, not being mixed
[55:57] with faith in them that heard it.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; The scripture here was talking about the
[56:04] prophet Moses time. And during the time
[56:07] of Moses, Amen, they had the pillar of
[56:09] fire with them. They had miracles
[56:12] everywhere with them. The word that was
[56:15] preached at that time was thus says the
[56:17] Lord.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; What Moses preached, God came and he
[56:20] backed it up.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; When Moses said we are going out of
[56:24] Egypt, God came with the plagues in
[56:27] Egypt, but he spared them in Gosh.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; God reigned plague after plague and they
[56:33] were witness to it all.
[56:35] They went through the Red Sea. Amen.
[56:38] Until it parted and they went on dry
[56:40] ground. God showing them that he was
[56:42] with them.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Then when they were in the wilderness,
[56:45] the pillar of fire was present with
[56:47] them.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; They were led by a cloud by day, by a
[56:51] pillar of fire by night.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; But they were so used to it until it
[56:56] became common to them. They thought it
[56:58] was an ordinary cloud. And they thought
[57:01] the pillar of fire was just an ordinary
[57:03] light that was giving them light. I
[57:05] wonder church, how could those children
[57:08] of Israel rise up to play when the
[57:10] pillar of fire was on top of Mount Si?
[57:14] &gt;&gt; How could they rise up to play when the
[57:16] cloud was covering them every day?
[57:18] &gt;&gt; How could they rise to play when the
[57:21] pillar of fire was their guiding light?
[57:25] &gt;&gt; But yet they rose up to play.
[57:28] God help us
[57:30] &gt;&gt; getting used to the things. Amen. Now
[57:33] Paul comes and he says the word that was
[57:35] preached unto them, it did not profit
[57:38] them. And what was the reason why it was
[57:40] not profit? Why it did not profit them?
[57:42] Because it was not mixed with faith.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Let me say many times the prophet of God
[57:50] comes and he says don't mix the word.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Don't mix the word. You can't hybrid the
[57:56] word. But I'm saying there is a place in
[57:59] the scripture where we are supposed to
[58:01] mix the word.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; And this is the only place I find where
[58:06] we are supposed to mix the word. What do
[58:08] you mix the word with? You mix the word
[58:11] with your faith.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; You've got to mix the word with your
[58:18] faith. What does it mean to mix the word
[58:20] with your faith? Oh, I love the message.
[58:23] The prophet of God says, "Remember the
[58:26] word preached did not profit them, not
[58:28] being mixed with faith in them that
[58:30] heard it." Oh my brethren, let me stop
[58:33] here for a minute. No matter how much
[58:36] the word is preached, how well you like
[58:38] the way it is preached, unless you
[58:40] yourself are a partaker of it.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; It won't do you one bit of good.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; So the preaching of the word is good.
[58:51] You may like the way the word is being
[58:53] preached,
[58:54] &gt;&gt; but unless you yourself becomes a
[58:56] partaker of that word,
[58:59] &gt;&gt; it does not profit you in any way.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; So the purpose of the preaching of the
[59:03] word is that every individual can get to
[59:05] a place where they become a partaker of
[59:07] the word.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; So the gospel has got to move you from
[59:11] just hearing the word to becoming a
[59:14] partaker of the word.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; You got to come to a place where you
[59:19] handle
[59:20] what has been preached.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; You have to have a manifestation of what
[59:25] has been preached.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Until there is a manifestation of what
[59:29] has been preached, you have not yet seen
[59:31] the power of the gospel.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[59:35] &gt;&gt; It means something is still lacking.
[59:37] Amen. What is it that is lacking? Amen.
[59:40] The prophet of God, he goes on and he
[59:42] says, not being mixed with faith by them
[59:45] that hated.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; They seen the miracles of Moses. They
[59:49] said, "That's pretty good." And they
[59:50] walked over. They seen him perform
[59:52] miracles and they seen the pillar of
[59:54] fire maybe or heard them talk about it.
[59:56] Oh, that's all right. But it wasn't
[59:58] mixed with personal faith.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; So it wasn't mixed with personal faith
[1:00:06] for as soon as they got to the
[1:00:08] wilderness, the everyone begin to
[1:00:10] murmur.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; So what makes you a partaker of the
[1:00:13] gospel? It is when you begin to mix the
[1:00:16] word with a personal faith.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not talking now about
[1:00:22] faith that comes to the entire church.
[1:00:24] Yes, it can be in the entire church, but
[1:00:27] it is working individually. It is a
[1:00:30] personal faith. We talking now of a
[1:00:33] faith that is in you as an individual
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; where you as an individual when the word
[1:00:39] is coming forth. You are mixing the word
[1:00:42] with your personal faith.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; And God said because they have doubted
[1:00:49] it, it was sin. Don't doubt nothing.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Believe. Don't doubt. No matter how hard
[1:00:56] the case is, believe it.
[1:00:59] Well, let me say to somebody tonight, I
[1:01:01] don't care what you're going through.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; I don't care how hard your situation is.
[1:01:06] I don't care what the devil has been
[1:01:07] trying to say to you, but don't doubt
[1:01:09] nothing. You start to believe that God
[1:01:12] is able. All things are possible to them
[1:01:15] that believe. Or do I have a believer in
[1:01:18] here? No matter how long the case has
[1:01:20] lingered for, but I want to say as the
[1:01:22] word is going forth, start to mix it
[1:01:25] with faith, personal faith. Hallelujah.
[1:01:28] And say to yourself, "My God is visiting
[1:01:32] me.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Nothing is too hard for my God."
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; There's got to come an hour when God
[1:01:38] steps into your home when God says, "I'm
[1:01:41] now solving your prayer request." You
[1:01:44] have prayed about it for a little while,
[1:01:46] but now the hour for you to see the
[1:01:48] manifestation of your prayer request has
[1:01:51] now arrived. Who here has a prayer
[1:01:53] request? Who here has been longing for
[1:01:56] something? I'm here to say to you
[1:01:58] tonight, no matter how long you have
[1:02:00] waited for, when you mix the word with
[1:02:03] your personal faith, God will come to
[1:02:06] deal with your situation. Even tonight,
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; so I believe tonight can be a different
[1:02:11] night. I believe tonight can be a night
[1:02:14] where somebody can have a personal
[1:02:16] experience with their God. Where
[1:02:18] somebody can walk out of this church
[1:02:20] with a personal testimony to say it was
[1:02:23] on that Wednesday night God he spoke to
[1:02:26] me in a special way and I mix the word
[1:02:30] with my personal faith and God did
[1:02:33] something to me. Can you say amen?
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? This is what we find
[1:02:39] with Cornelius that when Peter went to
[1:02:42] the house of Cornelius, my Bible reads
[1:02:44] in Acts chapter 10, while Peter yet
[1:02:47] spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell
[1:02:49] on them which heard the word.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they of the circumcision
[1:02:55] which believed were astonished, as many
[1:02:58] as came with Peter, because on that on
[1:03:00] the Gentiles also was poured out the
[1:03:02] gift of the Holy Spirit. Or let me just
[1:03:05] take you to the house of Cornelius.
[1:03:07] Brother, while Peter had speck, I don't
[1:03:10] believe Cornelius was just sitting down
[1:03:13] and staring. I don't believe Cornelius
[1:03:16] was just staring into the air. I believe
[1:03:19] Cornelius, as the word was going forth,
[1:03:22] Cornelius was taking that word, he was
[1:03:24] mixing that word, mixing it with faith.
[1:03:28] While Peter yet spent,
[1:03:31] hallelujah. than the gospel. Amen. It
[1:03:34] hit the heart of a Cornelius. And Peter,
[1:03:38] glory to God, whilst he's carrying on
[1:03:40] preaching, then he sees the Holy Ghost
[1:03:43] come and fall even on Cornelius.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Remember this man had not been baptized.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; He was not even baptized. Can you say
[1:03:53] amen? Yet the Bible says, "Repent and be
[1:03:57] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:04:00] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:04:03] Holy Ghost." But it was not so with
[1:04:05] Cornelius. Cornelius did not wait to be
[1:04:08] baptized. As he started to mix the word,
[1:04:11] as he started to mix the word and as he
[1:04:13] mixed the word with personal faith, God
[1:04:16] said, "Yes, I know what I said in Acts
[1:04:18] chapter 2, but because you are mixing
[1:04:21] the word so much with your personal
[1:04:24] faith, I'm going to jump some processes.
[1:04:27] I'm going to jump some processes. I'm
[1:04:29] going to jump the requirement of baptism
[1:04:32] and I'm going to take you to the Holy
[1:04:33] Ghost." Oh, let me say to somebody
[1:04:35] tonight, if you are mixing the word, God
[1:04:38] can jump processes.
[1:04:40] God can jump processes. Oh, come on,
[1:04:43] somebody believe here. Let me prophesy
[1:04:45] and say, somebody shall get a job that
[1:04:48] they've not even applied for. Somebody
[1:04:51] shall get a promotion that they've not
[1:04:54] even looked for. Before you even ask for
[1:04:57] it, God jumps some processes. Can you
[1:05:00] say amen? Can you say amen? Somebody can
[1:05:04] receive a house without even applying
[1:05:06] for it
[1:05:08] without even going for a mortgage. God
[1:05:12] can open up a door. If you are mixing
[1:05:14] the word tonight, God can jump some
[1:05:17] processes.
[1:05:18] Oh, can I have a believer in here? Can I
[1:05:21] have a believer in here that while Peter
[1:05:24] had spake, the Holy Ghost started to
[1:05:26] fall upon the people. Whilst the gospel
[1:05:28] is going forth, may the same Holy Ghost
[1:05:31] come upon somebody tonight. May the same
[1:05:34] Holy Ghost Oh, come on. Mix the word
[1:05:36] with your personal faith. Mix the word.
[1:05:40] Let God visit your home. Let God step
[1:05:43] into your househ.
[1:05:46] May the God of the Bible come and visit
[1:05:49] you directly. Come on, let's mix the
[1:05:51] word. As you mix the word with your
[1:05:54] personal faith, then the word becomes an
[1:05:58] appropriated message.
[1:05:59] [Applause]
[1:06:01] Glory to God. Glory to God. I believe in
[1:06:05] such an atmosphere, anything can happen.
[1:06:09] Anything can happen. You came to church
[1:06:11] with a prayer request. You can receive
[1:06:14] your desire. You can receive your
[1:06:16] answer. While Peter yet speck you don't
[1:06:19] need to wait for the end of the service.
[1:06:22] Cornelius did not wait for the end of
[1:06:24] the service. While Peter yet speck the
[1:06:27] Holy Ghost fell upon the people and the
[1:06:29] Holy Ghost came and anointed the people
[1:06:32] whilst the message is going forth
[1:06:33] tonight. Receive the Holy Ghost. Receive
[1:06:37] the Holy Ghost. Receive your heart's
[1:06:40] desire. Receive Amen. that which you
[1:06:43] have been longing for. Oh, come on. Give
[1:06:45] the Lord a hand of praise somebody.
[1:06:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God
[1:06:52] in the highest. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:06:55] Amen and amen. You know the other thing
[1:06:58] I like about Cornelius. Oh, I love this
[1:07:00] Cornelius. Cornelius was a gentile.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; He was a gentile. He was not a Jew. So,
[1:07:09] he was testifying of the coming of a
[1:07:11] gentile faith in an apostolic age.
[1:07:14] Brother, let me say God had to make sure
[1:07:17] that there was also Gentiles
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; that broke through
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; in the apostolic age so that we Gentiles
[1:07:26] can see that it is possible.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; And Gentiles have a gentile faith.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Do you know what a gentile faith is? A
[1:07:34] gentile faith does not wait for the
[1:07:36] laying on of hands.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; That's a Jewish faith.
[1:07:40] Gyrus said, "Come to my house and lay
[1:07:43] your hands upon my my my daughter." But
[1:07:46] when it came to Cornelius, hallelujah,
[1:07:48] or rather to the centurion, the
[1:07:50] centurion said, "Just speak the word
[1:07:52] only and my servant will be healed."
[1:07:56] Somebody say, "Brother, whisper, just
[1:07:58] preach the word only, and I'm going to
[1:08:00] receive what I desire." Yes, you can
[1:08:03] receive it. If you hear the word, the
[1:08:06] word has got everything for you.
[1:08:08] Whatever your heart's desire is, the
[1:08:10] word has got a solution. Just mix the
[1:08:13] word with your personal faith. And as
[1:08:16] you mix the word with your personal
[1:08:18] faith, things will begin to take place.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Hey, come on. We are Gentiles, man. We
[1:08:24] We are Gentiles. Can you say amen?
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord in the
[1:08:30] highest. Glory to God in the highest.
[1:08:34] That's a personal faith.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:38] Hallelujah.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Now let me tell you the Bible says faith
[1:08:42] cometh by hearing, hearing by
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; the word.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; So the level of word you hear
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; will determine the level of faith you
[1:08:52] get to.
[1:08:53] [Music]
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I said? The level of
[1:08:57] word you hear will determine the level
[1:08:59] of faith that you get to. Let me say in
[1:09:02] this message we have the zenith of the
[1:09:05] word. That's why it is only the bride
[1:09:08] that will make it into the rapture
[1:09:09] because it is the word that will give us
[1:09:12] a rapturing faith because what we are
[1:09:14] hearing is got enough capacity to change
[1:09:18] our bodies
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; in the twinkling of an eye.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother, if this message has
[1:09:25] the capacity to turn our bodies in the
[1:09:28] twinkling of an eye, let me say it has
[1:09:30] got the capacity to snap you out of
[1:09:32] sickness.
[1:09:34] It has got the capacity to change your
[1:09:36] condition in a second
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; until people will wonder was this the
[1:09:42] same person that we were with yesterday.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; You might have come from work. Amen. But
[1:09:48] when you go back to work something is
[1:09:50] different and they say what happened.
[1:09:53] You tell them I was in church and I met
[1:09:56] Jesus.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; I met Jesus. Oh, glory to God in the
[1:10:01] highest. I don't care what the situation
[1:10:04] is. God is depending on you
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; because he knows inside of you is enough
[1:10:10] capacity to be able to rise above that
[1:10:14] which you're going through.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil tell you that you
[1:10:19] cannot get out of your situation.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; You know, you know the reason why people
[1:10:23] end up committing suicide is because
[1:10:25] they've given up.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Brother, as a Christian, you cannot give
[1:10:29] up
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; until God says it's over. It's not over.
[1:10:34] And God can only say it's over when he
[1:10:36] takes you out of this world. As long as
[1:10:38] there's still breath in you, keep
[1:10:41] believing that any moment Jesus is going
[1:10:43] to step in.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; The devil tells you, "You've been
[1:10:46] waiting for this for too long." Tell
[1:10:48] them, "Father Abraham, waited for 25
[1:10:50] years. I've not even got to 25 years."
[1:10:54] My God will step on the scene. My God
[1:10:57] will change the situation. Oh, you can
[1:11:00] rise above your condition. The devil is
[1:11:02] a liar. Don't allow that devil to lie to
[1:11:05] you. I don't care what the situation is,
[1:11:08] brother, sister. God is going to do
[1:11:10] something for you.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Let me read what the prophet of God says
[1:11:15] here. He says, "Watch what's taking
[1:11:17] place now. The church is rising,
[1:11:20] brother. The power of God, the tide is
[1:11:23] high. Moving on. We are going from
[1:11:26] deeper depths and higher heights. The
[1:11:28] oldfashioned apostolic power of God that
[1:11:31] once dwelled in the disciples is coming
[1:11:33] back in the disciples again. That's
[1:11:35] exactly right. And I believe that things
[1:11:38] that you have never heard about is right
[1:11:41] now in the making.
[1:11:43] [Music]
[1:11:45] I can pause right there and I can
[1:11:47] prophesy to spirit and truth and I can
[1:11:50] say things that you have never heard
[1:11:52] about is right now in the making.
[1:11:56] Right now, God is fixing something that
[1:11:58] you have not even heard about. Something
[1:12:00] new,
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; something that you have not even
[1:12:03] imagined. God is going to send it your
[1:12:05] way that you already have been given a
[1:12:08] sign that God has paved the way for you
[1:12:10] to have a new place to worship. It is a
[1:12:13] sure sign that something that you have
[1:12:16] never imagined. Maybe I take you a few
[1:12:18] months ago, maybe last year or wherever,
[1:12:21] did you ever imagine that you could be
[1:12:23] here? But tonight you are in here. Let
[1:12:26] me tell you what you are not imagining
[1:12:28] in your home is coming to your home.
[1:12:31] What you're not imagining for your
[1:12:32] daughter is going to happen to your
[1:12:34] daughter. What you are not imagining for
[1:12:36] your son is going to happen to your son
[1:12:38] right now. Things are in the making. I
[1:12:41] want you to start thanking God for the
[1:12:43] things that are in the making.
[1:12:46] Or give him some praise for things that
[1:12:48] I or you don't need to know what they
[1:12:49] are. Just thank him to say, "Lord, I
[1:12:52] thank you that there is something that
[1:12:54] I've never heard of. Something that has
[1:12:57] never happened. Something brand new is
[1:13:00] fixing to happen right now. Oh, give him
[1:13:02] some praise, somebody. Give him some
[1:13:04] praise, somebody as you worship him, as
[1:13:07] you give him some praise. He's baking it
[1:13:10] right now. A cake is about to tumble
[1:13:13] into your own camp." Hallelujah. A cake
[1:13:16] is about to tumble like it tumbled.
[1:13:19] Amen. In the camp of Gideon,
[1:13:24] [Music]
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; good news is coming your way
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; where you have been hearing a lot of bad
[1:13:31] news but things are turning around
[1:13:33] somewhere. Mix the word. Mix the word
[1:13:38] with your personal faith and say it is
[1:13:40] me that you have been speaking to Lord.
[1:13:43] It is me that you send the preacher for.
[1:13:47] It is me that is receiving this tonight.
[1:13:50] God bless you. You can receive it if you
[1:13:52] believe it.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; You can receive it if you believe it.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet says no matter how much
[1:14:03] the word is preached, how well you like
[1:14:05] the way it is been preached, unless you
[1:14:08] yourself are a partaker of that, it
[1:14:11] won't do you one bit of good.
[1:14:14] But it wasn't mixed with personal faith.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Now I, as I'm beginning to close, I want
[1:14:20] to ask, what is personal faith?
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; What is personal faith?
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Personal faith is a faith that
[1:14:33] personalizes
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; promises.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Ordinary faith
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; will say, I believe that promise.
[1:14:43] and it stays there.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; But personal faith
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; says, I believe that promise,
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; but I'm the person
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; that shall fulfill that promise.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Am I speaking to somebody in here?
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Personal faith personalizes things.
[1:15:02] Hallelujah.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Personal faith. The prophet says here,
[1:15:06] Joshua stopped the sun. Is that right?
[1:15:09] Somebody says, "All things are possible
[1:15:10] with God. Nothing impossible but all
[1:15:13] things are possible to you also.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; That's personal faith.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; All things are possible is ordinary
[1:15:23] faith.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; But personal faith says all things are
[1:15:27] possible to me.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; I want you to shout it out tonight. All
[1:15:31] things
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; are possible
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; to me.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; To me.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; To me.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; To me.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; To me. As you shout it out, let it
[1:15:41] happen to you. That's personal faith.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Personal faith will take a scripture and
[1:15:48] and bring it to pass in your own life
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; is what happened on the day of
[1:15:53] Pentecost. Peter took a scripture. Acts
[1:15:56] chapter 2. For these are not drunkers as
[1:15:58] you suppose, seeing it is but the third
[1:16:00] hour of the day. But this is that
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; which was spoken by the prophet Joel.
[1:16:06] Personal faith will say this scripture
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; this that you are seeing in my life
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; is that scripture
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; that has been fulfilled in my life
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; or can you say amen?
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, God can give you
[1:16:26] things.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; God can make something that you have
[1:16:29] never experienced.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; I believe in a God of the
[1:16:33] impossibilities.
[1:16:35] I was giving our testimony another time.
[1:16:38] Amen. You know, we we we left Zimbabwe
[1:16:41] and we came to live in England and when
[1:16:43] we're living in England, uh I was
[1:16:45] running a business back then and then
[1:16:47] something happened and they stole my
[1:16:50] money and we were not able to buy the
[1:16:53] home that we needed to buy.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; And when we able to buy the home that we
[1:16:56] needed to buy, it got to a place where
[1:16:59] we lived in that place for 9 years. We
[1:17:01] had an option to buy. But one day the
[1:17:03] guy came and he says, "Hey, you failed
[1:17:04] to buy, so we're kicking you out."
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Me and my wife, we said, "Okay, let us
[1:17:09] go and start looking for houses without
[1:17:12] money, without price."
[1:17:14] [Applause]
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; We said, "This time they gave us two
[1:17:19] months notice
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; and we said let's go and start looking
[1:17:22] for a house."
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; We started house viewing
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; left, right, and center. And because we
[1:17:28] did not have money, it then meant we did
[1:17:30] not have a budget. So we could dream as
[1:17:33] wild as we wanted. At times money is the
[1:17:36] problem. But when you don't have it then
[1:17:39] you are not working with what you have.
[1:17:41] You are working with what God can do. So
[1:17:44] we were not limited by budget because we
[1:17:47] did not have a penny. So we said let's
[1:17:49] look for what we want and what is
[1:17:51] available.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Until we found something and when we
[1:17:55] found it we went and we put an offer and
[1:17:57] they said when do you complete? We said
[1:17:59] h give us 5 months. I was hoping that
[1:18:02] something would happen on what I was
[1:18:03] working on and it never worked out. 5
[1:18:05] months came the man got angry
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; and he says you've wasted my time for 5
[1:18:10] years. I'm taking this back onto the
[1:18:12] market. He was so angry. We said okay
[1:18:14] you can carry on and do it. But we still
[1:18:17] said let's hold on.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; But somewhere along the way God sent a
[1:18:23] certain white man
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; who was a businessman. He came and he
[1:18:27] gave us an equivalent of $850,000
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; to pay deposit without money, without
[1:18:34] price.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about where we live.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the reality of faith.
[1:18:42] So I'm saying to somebody in here, you
[1:18:45] don't even need money. What you need is
[1:18:47] personal faith.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; You don't need something to be able to
[1:18:51] get to where you want to do. What you
[1:18:53] need is faith. Faith can do anything.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Faith can do anything tonight. Do you
[1:19:01] believe it tonight? Do you believe it
[1:19:03] tonight?
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; So I can say Mark chapter 10 said they
[1:19:08] came to the Lord Jesus and they said,
[1:19:10] "What shall happen to us? We have left
[1:19:12] father and mother. We have left
[1:19:14] everything we had." What did Jesus say?
[1:19:17] He says, "There is no man that has left
[1:19:19] father or mother, houses or lands, but
[1:19:22] that shall receive in this lifetime a
[1:19:25] hundfold houses, lands, brothers,
[1:19:30] sisters, mothers.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?"
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Now tonight I can say this that you have
[1:19:38] heard in the scripture
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; is that which I live in.
[1:19:43] So you can also say this that you have
[1:19:46] heard in the scripture is that that I am
[1:19:48] handling.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Take me to the next quotation. The
[1:19:51] prophet of God says here sometimes God
[1:19:54] lets things get so dark that you can't
[1:19:57] see up around or anywhere else and then
[1:20:00] he comes and makes a way through it for
[1:20:01] you that you might say this day this
[1:20:05] scripture is fulfilled that he promised
[1:20:08] to do.
[1:20:10] The prophet preached the message this
[1:20:12] day this scripture is fulfilled. But
[1:20:14] brother that has got to become a
[1:20:16] personal testimony. You've got to get to
[1:20:18] a place where you yourself can say this
[1:20:21] day this quotation that the prophet
[1:20:25] promised is happened into my life. God
[1:20:28] bless you spirit and truth. God bless
[1:20:31] you. God bless you. This is that is got
[1:20:36] to come to a place where it has got to
[1:20:39] happen. You got to get to a place where
[1:20:42] you identify a scripture and you start
[1:20:45] to love that scripture until you see
[1:20:47] yourself in the scripture.
[1:20:49] Yes, sir.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Auntie Jeremiah,
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; she believed a scripture and she said,
[1:20:54] "Where is your Elijah?" God said,
[1:20:56] "Because you have mixed the word with
[1:20:59] your faith, I've got an Elijah. I'll
[1:21:01] stop the plane." Brother, God will do
[1:21:04] something for you.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; When you start to believe a scripture so
[1:21:08] much,
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; it will end up happening in your life.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; It will end up materializing in your
[1:21:13] life. It's got to get to a place where
[1:21:16] things become personal.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; I don't know what your heart's desire
[1:21:20] is,
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; but as I close, receive your heart's
[1:21:24] desire in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:21:28] Christ.
[1:21:29] Look for a scripture that speaks to your
[1:21:33] situation. Look for a quotation that
[1:21:36] speaks to your situation and God will
[1:21:39] give it to you.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; God bless you as I ask brother Jack to
[1:21:42] come.
[1:21:43] Until we meet again,
[1:21:46] the Lord be with you.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:58] [Music]
[1:22:00] Come on, let's give the Lord a hand of
[1:22:02] praise.
[1:22:04] Thank him for speaking to us tonight.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're mixing this with personal
[1:22:10] faith.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; My God, I believe situations are
[1:22:14] changing.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Because of what you said amen to
[1:22:18] tonight,
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; my God sent the preacher with a thought
[1:22:23] in his heart, not knowing what you were
[1:22:25] going through. And and I know that that
[1:22:27] happened uh last week with brother
[1:22:28] Banaya. He came and he was speaking to
[1:22:30] some some situations. Brother Whisper
[1:22:32] come back and speak to the same thing
[1:22:34] about jobs
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; and different people going through
[1:22:38] things on their jobs and you know but
[1:22:40] here uh we heard the Lord say to us that
[1:22:42] God is getting ready to give somebody a
[1:22:43] promotion without you even asking for it
[1:22:46] or or even you know applying for it.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; If if I was working I would take that
[1:22:53] and run run with that.
[1:22:55] [Applause]
[1:22:56] I I would not let that
[1:23:00] come from God strong and just float
[1:23:03] around the atmosphere.
[1:23:06] I would make it personal.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; I'd be getting ready for a promotion.
[1:23:11] Get ready for the office with the window
[1:23:13] in it.
[1:23:15] Come on, somebody.
[1:23:17] You ought to get ready for your
[1:23:18] blessing.
[1:23:20] My God. My God. My God. What more does
[1:23:24] God have to say to us? This is nothing
[1:23:27] but the hand of the Lord speaking to us.
[1:23:30] And if you're looking and believing God
[1:23:32] for a house, I mean, put a steak down
[1:23:34] tonight.
[1:23:36] Put a steak down tonight. A testimony
[1:23:39] like that.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; And and and and brother Gwyn don't share
[1:23:45] testimonies like that all the time,
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; but but when he share a testimony like
[1:23:49] that, you got you better listen.
[1:23:52] And and then you have to say, "Lord, if
[1:23:53] you did it for him,
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; I know you have no respect of person."
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He said, "Without money,
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; and that fit my situation,
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; but I got personal faith to believe that
[1:24:07] God would speak that to me."
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; You ought to start looking for a house.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; I say you ought to start looking for a
[1:24:16] house. Don't wait for your bank account
[1:24:19] to get to a certain level. Start looking
[1:24:22] for a house.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Last week, Sister Tina testified about a
[1:24:30] new car.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; If your car giving you problems,
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; you ought to jump in. Say, "Lord, praise
[1:24:38] God. I heard what you just did for
[1:24:41] Sister Tina, and I know you have no
[1:24:43] respect to persons." Amen. It's my turn.
[1:24:49] Hallelujah. Woo.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; And if you are seeking the baptism of
[1:24:54] the Holy Ghost
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; or a refilling of the Holy Ghost and you
[1:25:00] hear about somebody else being filled or
[1:25:02] refilled, you ought to get up and say,
[1:25:04] "I'm next. I'm next. I'm next. I'm next.
[1:25:06] I'm next. Blessed be the name of the
[1:25:09] Lord."
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; My God. Woo.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's give the Lord another
[1:25:16] hand of praise, church. But I I tell you
[1:25:19] the truth,
[1:25:22] y'all. Y'all be seated if you can. I I
[1:25:26] was I was leaving here on on Sunday
[1:25:30] and um as we were just making
[1:25:32] preparation for
[1:25:34] um Eagles Rest to come in and and have
[1:25:37] this service, there was a a young man
[1:25:39] that kind of came in a little early and
[1:25:43] um he was, you know, just sitting and
[1:25:46] and um you know, so um
[1:25:50] after service, he didn't really know who
[1:25:52] the pastor was, but he certainly wanted
[1:25:54] to try to find out who the pastor was
[1:25:56] and and um he walked up to me and he
[1:25:59] says, "Are you the pastor?" Said, "Yes,
[1:26:02] sir. I sure am." He says, "Well, um I
[1:26:06] hear the Lord saying um get ready for a
[1:26:09] revival."
[1:26:13] [Music]
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; And um I I say, "Well, okay. Thank you.
[1:26:17] I appreciate that." And and I know that,
[1:26:20] you know, um the denominational thought
[1:26:22] on what revival is versus what our
[1:26:25] understanding of what revival is, it's
[1:26:28] probably two different understandings,
[1:26:29] but nonetheless, I received what he was
[1:26:31] saying. And and and what I felt here
[1:26:34] tonight was a revival atmosphere.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; That's what I felt here tonight.
[1:26:41] And and and what revival does, we know
[1:26:43] it just it washes the trash onto the
[1:26:46] shore. And uh and it's something that
[1:26:48] happens to you personally.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; And what I see God is doing some things
[1:26:53] personally to some people. We're mixing
[1:26:54] it mixing our personal faith with this
[1:26:57] and and I'm under expectation.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; I'm just under expectation. I I I'm I'm
[1:27:03] grateful. I'm grateful.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a season that we have entered
[1:27:08] into. Amen. And you know, we we we ought
[1:27:12] to just enjoy what God has done. I mean,
[1:27:14] since the meetings, even before the
[1:27:16] meetings, uh, cuz we had, you know,
[1:27:18] different ministers and and the
[1:27:20] different brothers that were calling me
[1:27:21] and saying they wanted to pass through,
[1:27:22] and I'm like, "Oh, my the timing, the
[1:27:24] timing, it's just not a good timing."
[1:27:26] But, but come on, brother. Come on. And
[1:27:29] um and and as uh we had the two brothers
[1:27:32] from uh Nigeria and and you all know
[1:27:35] brother JZ came and and and when he
[1:27:38] finished preaching just what a a mighty
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; mighty presence of God that came, you
[1:27:47] know, into the building. Those chairs
[1:27:50] will never be the same. That that room
[1:27:53] will never be the same.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Right. And I mean that people could feel
[1:27:57] the presence. I know after that and and
[1:27:59] you know just God just um you know uh
[1:28:03] just meeting us just one more time you
[1:28:05] know there at the school but then we
[1:28:07] come here and u and with all the
[1:28:10] brothers just kind of staying over just
[1:28:12] a couple extra days we're able to just
[1:28:14] kind of bathe in the atmosphere from the
[1:28:16] meetings.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; We just bathe in that atmosphere and and
[1:28:20] I'm going to tell you this. If you would
[1:28:22] come to church with a personal faith
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; and mix it with whoever's preaching up
[1:28:28] here,
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; we can have meeting atmosphere every
[1:28:31] time we come together.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to wait till July to
[1:28:37] have a meeting atmosphere. Every time we
[1:28:39] come together, we can have that type of
[1:28:40] atmosphere. And when there's an
[1:28:42] atmosphere like that, then this then it
[1:28:44] it puts God in a place where you you
[1:28:47] take the limits off of him.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; He can do whatever he want to do. and
[1:28:51] and and and I mean my God. Um quickly
[1:28:55] and let me just share this testimony and
[1:28:57] I'm I'm going to try to move on. But um
[1:28:59] as brother Gwyn was just talking, you
[1:29:01] know, this this this restoration of the
[1:29:03] apostolic
[1:29:05] uh fathers, you know, that the apostolic
[1:29:07] blessings, things of that nature. And I
[1:29:09] love the way he brought out we knew the
[1:29:11] gifts. We knew that because in in in a
[1:29:13] lot of churches, they don't even preach
[1:29:15] that anymore.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; We know that people don't even believe
[1:29:19] in that. They they feel like you have to
[1:29:21] keep the gifts under control. Well, is
[1:29:24] that what they did in the in the Bible?
[1:29:26] Kept the gifts under control? If if they
[1:29:28] did, we would have never read these
[1:29:29] things in scripture.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; No, we realize the Corinthian church got
[1:29:33] online, but we're not the Corinthian
[1:29:34] church.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; All right. So, so, so I I'm happy when
[1:29:38] we see that. But then how he brought out
[1:29:40] uh the visitation of angels
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; is also an apostolic blessing that we
[1:29:47] should be looking for. And you know, uh,
[1:29:49] I was reminded of of a couple situations
[1:29:52] there and in, and uh, Brother
[1:29:53] Brandham's, uh, day. I remember there
[1:29:56] was a brother one time over in Africa
[1:29:58] and he was concerned about Brother
[1:29:59] Brandham coming over there to preach. He
[1:30:01] had heard some negative things
[1:30:04] regarding, you know, God's prophet and
[1:30:07] uh, and he was believing what the
[1:30:08] negative people were saying. So as he
[1:30:11] was praying
[1:30:13] um
[1:30:14] uh you know actually had a friend I
[1:30:16] believe praying for him about the about
[1:30:18] receiving brother Brandham and somehow
[1:30:20] the man was uh was there and a hand
[1:30:23] touched him on the shoulder and when his
[1:30:26] hand touched him on the shoulder he went
[1:30:28] running to his friend said you know I'm
[1:30:29] going to be there at the meeting you
[1:30:31] know he just had this experience and he
[1:30:33] said his hand touched me on the shoulder
[1:30:34] and and when his friend looked cuz it
[1:30:36] was on the back of his shirt and when
[1:30:38] when the friend looked The friends say,
[1:30:40] "Man, that's the print of a of a man's
[1:30:42] hand."
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; And come to find out, it was the print
[1:30:47] of the prophet's hand.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; That was on that man's shoulder. Tell
[1:30:51] him and and giving him some confidence.
[1:30:54] Don't worry, it's going to be all right.
[1:30:55] The meeting God can still do
[1:30:57] supernatural things like that.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; You all heard the testimony of of
[1:31:03] brother uh Brooks and how he was in his
[1:31:06] house. Yeah.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Uh I don't know what state it was, but
[1:31:09] there was a brother in Virginia going
[1:31:11] through
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; a a a terrible uh uh lawsuit. The man
[1:31:16] was going through a terrible lawsuit.
[1:31:18] The man saw himself losing everything.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; But brother Brooks, God come to him in a
[1:31:24] dream. Actually, he sent brother
[1:31:27] Brandham to him in a dream.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "You see that
[1:31:31] couple? They look a little uh uh they
[1:31:35] they they they they look like they're
[1:31:37] really going through a lot, don't they?
[1:31:38] I mean, they're really discouraged.
[1:31:40] Yeah. He says, um, when you wake up out
[1:31:43] of the dream, I want you to write this
[1:31:45] telephone number down,
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; and I want you to call this telephone
[1:31:49] number and tell them it's going to be
[1:31:51] all right.
[1:31:54] Amen.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brooks wrote the number down
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; and by faith
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; just dial the number.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; And when he dialed the number, it
[1:32:04] happened to be the the the the children.
[1:32:06] I mean, the daughter of the of the
[1:32:07] couple answered the phone and and um and
[1:32:11] brothers, you know, asked asked, he
[1:32:13] didn't even know who to ask from. He
[1:32:15] says, uh, you know, this is what
[1:32:17] happened. Brother Brandon came to me in
[1:32:19] a dream and uh I wrote the number down
[1:32:22] and then I I just dialed the number and
[1:32:24] what he told me to tell you is that it's
[1:32:26] going to be all right.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; So the daughter say what? The daughter
[1:32:32] start cleaning up the house and her
[1:32:34] parents were in the court right at the
[1:32:36] time that she got the telephone call and
[1:32:38] and she started cleaning the house and
[1:32:39] got a a good meal prepared. when her
[1:32:41] parents came home so despondent
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; and she just looked at him and say, "Uh,
[1:32:46] daddy, I got your plate ready." He said,
[1:32:48] "Well, honey, today was a rough day. I
[1:32:50] need to tell No, just go ahead and eat,
[1:32:52] Dad. It's going to be it's, you know,
[1:32:53] it's going to be okay. Just just get you
[1:32:55] get your shoes off. Let me get you some
[1:32:57] Kool-Aid. Let me let me just take I
[1:32:59] mean, she was just just buttering up
[1:33:01] daddy and did not reveal what had
[1:33:03] happened. And when daddy finally got
[1:33:05] some food in his stomach, she said,
[1:33:07] "Now, I need to tell you something that
[1:33:08] happened today. I know you went through
[1:33:10] a rough day, but I want to let you know
[1:33:12] I got a telephone call from a brother
[1:33:14] from a whole another state.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "Brother Brandom came to him in
[1:33:18] a dream and he saw y'all going through
[1:33:21] what y'all was going through. He said,
[1:33:22] "Write this number down and call this
[1:33:24] number and tell them it's going to be
[1:33:27] all right."
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; So, I'm just letting you know, daddy. I
[1:33:31] don't care what your day was like. It's
[1:33:33] going to be all right.
[1:33:35] [Applause]
[1:33:38] And you know, just just just them three
[1:33:40] words, it's going to be all right. That
[1:33:43] changed everything in the situation.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; The lawsuit was dropped.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Look.

[1:34:01] angels
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; that is that's part of the apostolic
[1:34:07] blessing
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; and and and I I trust that we caught
[1:34:10] what the Holy Spirit was telling us
[1:34:11] tonight because we can have that if we
[1:34:13] would be sincere.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; If we would be sincere
[1:34:18] and God can do that and so much more.

[1:34:33] when it when it's released out there
[1:34:35] like that, when that seed has been

[1:34:59] And um and and again, we we're not
[1:35:02] pressed for time to get out of here. So
[1:35:06] um you all know Wednesday nights we
[1:35:08] always leave space for people to share
[1:35:10] testimonies and uh we'll certainly give
[1:35:12] you space to do that uh tonight. So um
[1:35:18] as you're aware on Sundays our service
[1:35:22] time has changed and everything that we
[1:35:24] were doing on Sundays our prayer time,
[1:35:26] Sunday school time and service time has
[1:35:29] changed. Uh prayer will start from 8:30
[1:35:32] and it'll go to 9:30. Uh and then um
[1:35:36] Sunday school will go from 8:45 to 9:15.
[1:35:40] Um, we we do have a desire and we have
[1:35:43] to figure out how to do this, but we
[1:35:44] want to put some type of um covering on
[1:35:48] that window while they're doing Sunday
[1:35:50] school uh so that we don't interrupt
[1:35:53] them. So, we'll we'll have to figure
[1:35:55] that out. And I appreciate some of my
[1:35:57] sisters for just kind of helping. We
[1:35:59] can't do like permanent things cuz it's
[1:36:02] not our space. We need like temporary
[1:36:05] solutions that we can just kind of throw
[1:36:06] up, take down, uh something that we can
[1:36:09] put somewhere. But we just need y'all
[1:36:11] y'all ideas. Um also, so uh uh just keep

[1:40:00] All right.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Ever since my dad passed away,
[1:40:12] this was about the worst year
[1:40:15] ever, ever, ever, ever.
[1:40:19] I went through
[1:40:22] depression
[1:40:23] like I've never been any y'all know I'm
[1:40:27] happy I'm happy I'm lucky but I went
[1:40:29] through a whole lot of depression I mean
[1:40:31] straight
[1:40:33] it was a feeling that I had never felt
[1:40:35] before in my life so I didn't know how
[1:40:38] to deal with it um
[1:40:42] I've been dealing with all kind of
[1:40:44] sicknesses I've been to the doctor more
[1:40:45] this year than I've been through in my
[1:40:47] life
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; u everything was just shutting down um
[1:40:51] spiritually.
[1:40:53] I had lost the joy
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; of my salvation.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; And I wasn't going to go to the
[1:41:00] meetings.
[1:41:02] Um I was going to go, but I wasn't going
[1:41:04] to go to every last one of them. I was
[1:41:06] just like, uhuh. And y'all know I've
[1:41:08] been hitting and missing because it was
[1:41:09] just I go, "No, I don't feel like
[1:41:12] going." It was a It's just been a real
[1:41:15] battle this past year. And um a lot of
[1:41:20] other stuff had happened that I you know
[1:41:22] when I went to the meeting I like the
[1:41:25] brother say when you come under
[1:41:27] expectation I say well Lord I'm going to
[1:41:29] go to this meeting and I need you
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; to talk to me
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; all right
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; and when I went in the meeting the first
[1:41:40] minister
[1:41:42] he just started talking to me Right.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; And it was as he was preaching and he
[1:41:51] was saying stuff, I said, "Okay, Lord."
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Okay. All right then.
[1:41:59] It was such a weight
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; lifted.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; And a freedom given.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. to I mean I in this
[1:42:08] past year just you know something comes
[1:42:11] along any kind of test any kind of tri
[1:42:13] trial God always gives me a song.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; I didn't even have a song to sing.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; I mean after the meetings and and
[1:42:22] brother Diggs coming back and and
[1:42:23] preaching about you know um the
[1:42:26] restoration and what it's supposed to
[1:42:28] look like. All right.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; It was just a freedom,
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; a release,
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; a higher coming up.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; And I say, Lord, this I I mean, this is
[1:42:39] what I've been doing. I was looking at
[1:42:42] people and what people were doing and
[1:42:44] things and stuff instead of looking at
[1:42:46] your word and getting down in your word.
[1:42:48] Hallelujah. and and the joy just came
[1:42:52] and I I mean it's just been a song in my

[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; I like the other way to center.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. But
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; no, we got more space here.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; this wasn't going to be said because it
[1:44:26] was like in the middle of the day, but
[1:44:28] Sister Nelly was saying that it was just
[1:44:31] been the worst year and we were at a
[1:44:34] barn today and there was a lady and she
[1:44:37] was saying she was like, "This has just
[1:44:38] been the worst year." And I was like I
[1:44:41] was well I didn't say it out loud but I
[1:44:43] said it in my head and I was like well I
[1:44:44] don't know what she's talking about
[1:44:46] because for me this year has been like
[1:44:50] the best lately. But um I I don't know.
[1:44:55] I was just going to say that because
[1:44:56] sister Nelly was talking about that. But
[1:44:59] what I actually came up here for was two
[1:45:03] things. Number one, I wanted to give a
[1:45:04] praise report that we like I don't know
[1:45:09] how long ago. I think it was like a
[1:45:11] month ago. We were driving and our the
[1:45:15] trailer, my dad's trailer opened and we
[1:45:20] had a garbage can in there that we
[1:45:22] didn't know how much we needed it, but
[1:45:24] we needed it. And we lost the garbage
[1:45:26] can when the door closed. Luckily, we
[1:45:28] were leaving a friend's house and he
[1:45:30] told us that, "Hey, your doors open
[1:45:32] after the garbage can fell out." So, we
[1:45:36] were like, "Well, there goes that." So,
[1:45:39] um, we've been just like, "I can't
[1:45:41] believe the trash can fell out. I can't
[1:45:42] believe the trash can fell out." And one
[1:45:45] day, like, this was like a month into
[1:45:48] it. We were like, one day we were just
[1:45:49] driving past the road and Aby's like, "I
[1:45:53] think I just saw the trash can on the
[1:45:56] side of the road. It was like a stop
[1:45:58] sign and it had two poles and it was
[1:46:00] like in between the poles. Abby was
[1:46:03] like, "I think I just saw the trash
[1:46:04] can." He's like, "Bro, stop." That was
[1:46:07] like a month ago and we were and he was
[1:46:09] like, she was like, "No." So, we were
[1:46:11] actually late to go. We were going to a
[1:46:12] Bible study and we were late. So, he was
[1:46:15] like, "Don't make me turn around and the
[1:46:16] trash can's not there." So we turned
[1:46:19] around and the trash can was there and
[1:46:20] we were like, he said after the meetings
[1:46:23] there was going to be restoration and
[1:46:25] that trash can is here.
[1:46:28] [Applause]
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; And the thing I
[1:46:37] most likely came up here to say was that
[1:46:40] another praise report that God actually
[1:46:43] protected me, it's small, but it's big
[1:46:45] to me. Um he we were riding our horses
[1:46:50] last Saturday and my horse got loose
[1:46:54] because I don't know how he got loose.
[1:46:55] He I think he was going to go eat some
[1:46:57] grass but I didn't think he was going to
[1:46:59] go eat some grass. So, I went like
[1:47:01] running after him and I was on the side
[1:47:04] of him and he's running like this and I
[1:47:06] guess he thought we were playing or
[1:47:08] something and he kicked me right here
[1:47:10] and it could have been way worse than it
[1:47:13] was and it just took my breath, but no
[1:47:18] side effects. There was no redness, no
[1:47:21] bruise, nothing. It did hurt for a
[1:47:23] little bit, but I was praying to God. I
[1:47:25] was like, "God, you can res you can heal
[1:47:28] me because if if if that happened and it
[1:47:31] wasn't that bad, then I think you can
[1:47:33] heal me from a little bit of pain." So
[1:47:36] that's what I wanted to say that he
[1:47:38] healed me from the horse and he also
[1:47:42] restored our garbage can.
[1:47:46] [Applause]
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Won't he do it?
[1:47:54] Thank you, Sister Linda. Certainly
[1:47:56] appreciate, you know, you sharing and
[1:47:58] certainly a a kick from a horse.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Uh, that could be something serious. So,
[1:48:05] thank God for his divine protection. Um,
[1:48:08] anybody else? Okay, come on up, brother
[1:48:11] Joe. Amen.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:48:19] So, um, the this is it. It like Lynn
[1:48:24] said, it might be small, but it's
[1:48:25] something big to me. So, a so so a new
[1:48:30] video game console came out and it it
[1:48:32] was really expensive and stuff. And we
[1:48:34] went to the store and the way it was
[1:48:36] going down was like really fast because
[1:48:39] it was like it just came out. They
[1:48:41] didn't make enough basically. So, we
[1:48:43] went to the store. They said they didn't
[1:48:44] have it, but the lady told us, she said,
[1:48:47] "Go on July 1st, get there early in the
[1:48:51] morning, and they'll have about 32 in
[1:48:52] stock." So, we go there. I was the first
[1:48:54] one to be there. I got one, and the we
[1:48:58] we got it, but we had to pay for like a
[1:49:00] bunch of like uh more stuff as well,
[1:49:03] like member the not membership, sorry.
[1:49:05] Um the year plans and stuff like that.
[1:49:07] Um screen protectors and stuff. But I
[1:49:09] just want to um thank the Lord for
[1:49:11] allowing my parents to get me a $750
[1:49:15] game console.
[1:49:18] So yeah, I say I just want to thank the
[1:49:20] Lord for that. All right, Joe.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that that that that was his
[1:49:32] desire. So praise the Lord.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Any anybody else want to want to share?
[1:49:38] Okay. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:49] God's concerned about everything.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Everything. Even garbage cans.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; God bless your church. Um, I want to
[1:50:02] thank the Lord for the meetings because
[1:50:05] I didn't think that God care about me,
[1:50:08] but he really does.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Um, I think the service that we had when
[1:50:13] brother Jesus came in that morning when
[1:50:16] I woke up, I had a terrible dream and
[1:50:18] then I was telling my husband how bad it
[1:50:22] was and then he said, "Okay, let's go to
[1:50:24] church and then let's pray about that."
[1:50:28] But I was so tired from the Saturday and
[1:50:30] then I was like when I first got up I
[1:50:32] forgot about the gym and then I said,
[1:50:34] "Okay, I'm not going to go to church
[1:50:35] today." And then out of nowhere, I put
[1:50:39] my clothes on and then I find myself in
[1:50:41] church. And that day, if I didn't go to
[1:50:44] church, I that was that was it for me.
[1:50:47] That could be it for me.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit come down and then I
[1:50:51] it was a blessing. And then he took that
[1:50:54] that burden away from me. And then I
[1:50:57] thank God for that. And also
[1:51:00] something terrible happened again before
[1:51:02] the meeting. And then he was I was down.
[1:51:05] I'm like this is it for me. I am not
[1:51:07] going to the meeting. And
[1:51:11] I said that but I know like I couldn't
[1:51:13] miss that. And then one more time God
[1:51:18] came into the scene and then he showed
[1:51:21] mercy to me personally. I didn't miss
[1:51:24] one bit. No crumbs for me. If somebody
[1:51:26] left scrums, it was not me. I got every
[1:51:29] last bit of everything.
[1:51:33] I want to thank God for that.
[1:51:36] Yeah. I got I told brother Jack and
[1:51:37] Sister Erica, I'm going to bring my
[1:51:39] suitcase. I brought that thing and then
[1:51:41] I got my blessing.
[1:51:43] I want to thank God for that because it
[1:51:45] was so discouraging the the Sunday
[1:51:48] before and then that um it was on on
[1:51:52] Tuesday. I didn't even work because it
[1:51:53] was so bad. I was depressed. I'm like,
[1:51:56] what what where am I? What am I doing?
[1:51:59] Because I thought everything was going
[1:52:01] well, but now I find myself in this
[1:52:03] situation. Let me just give up. But
[1:52:06] something inside me said, you girl, you
[1:52:08] know you got to be at the meeting.
[1:52:10] That's where you need to be. And then
[1:52:13] God showed mercy and then I'm going to
[1:52:15] leave everything behind me. I I really
[1:52:18] thank God for that. And being a part of
[1:52:20] spirit and truth tabernacle, that's also
[1:52:23] my blessing. And I want to thank you for
[1:52:25] all of that. God bless you.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:30] God bless you, Sister Melissa. Amen. We
[1:52:32] certainly appreciate that. Anybody else
[1:52:34] want to share? Come on, sis. Yeah. Amen.
[1:52:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:52:46] So
[1:52:48] during the
[1:52:50] week of testing for school, I was going
[1:52:55] back and forth to Palm Bay to
[1:52:59] do my testing and it was the chemistry
[1:53:04] test on a Monday
[1:53:07] and I went to that and then on Wednesday
[1:53:11] I was like, "Dad, do I have another day
[1:53:13] of testing?" I was like, he was like,
[1:53:15] "No, I don't know." So, I go check my
[1:53:17] mom's email and it said I had testing
[1:53:20] that day, but I was, it was at 11 and it
[1:53:23] was about 12 when I looked at it. And I
[1:53:27] could have possibly been retained or
[1:53:30] stayed in that grade and could be kicked
[1:53:33] out of the school I was going to. And my
[1:53:36] dad was like, "Don't cry. Like,
[1:53:40] it's going to be okay." And I'm like,
[1:53:44] "Dad, I'm going to fail. I can't I'm not
[1:53:47] going to make it."
[1:53:49] And he was just like, "It's okay." So,
[1:53:52] we called my guidance counselor. She's
[1:53:54] not answering. Um, we called the school.
[1:53:58] They're like, "We can't do nothing for
[1:54:00] you." And then there's this one lady. My
[1:54:02] teacher was like, "You have to call her
[1:54:04] words pass." So, I called her and
[1:54:09] um I have to do law studies this year
[1:54:12] and she was like if you if like the way
[1:54:17] you have to get in is like you have to
[1:54:19] go to a school in your zone. So, we have
[1:54:22] to change our address because it was
[1:54:24] still the address in Palm Bay. So, we
[1:54:26] had to change it to our current address.
[1:54:28] And
[1:54:31] they found a school and they had to open
[1:54:33] dates for me to take my algebra and my
[1:54:36] history test. And I'm going to the ninth
[1:54:40] grade.
[1:54:42] [Applause]
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:54:47] Don't worry. It's going to be all right.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Won't he do it?
[1:54:54] God is good. Amen. God bless you, Sister
[1:54:56] Shalom. Anybody else? All right. Praise
[1:54:58] the Lord.
[1:55:07] God bless you. Um, I just want to share
[1:55:10] this testimony and tell you how blessed
[1:55:13] we are to have brother Jack as our
[1:55:16] pastor. Um when I first started my job,
[1:55:20] he came in and prayed over my class and
[1:55:25] it eventually
[1:55:28] um one or two more people, you know, it
[1:55:31] has come to the point now where he's
[1:55:35] walking from one side of campus all the
[1:55:38] way to the other side, all the way out
[1:55:41] that door around in other buildings
[1:55:43] because I sent out the the message,
[1:55:46] "Brother Jack is coming." They they call
[1:55:49] him Pastor Jack. And so I I sent out the
[1:55:52] message, "Pastor Jack is coming today."
[1:55:55] And the the the the message is coming
[1:55:59] back. Make sure you come to my room.
[1:56:01] Make sure he comes to my room. Make sure
[1:56:02] he come to my room. And then it was one
[1:56:05] one teacher said, "Make sure he hits
[1:56:07] this room, this room, this room, this
[1:56:09] room, this room." He don't have to go
[1:56:10] in. Just have him to stand at the door
[1:56:12] and pray over the door. And you all just
[1:56:17] it's something just to see how much the
[1:56:20] people respect his prayers, want him to
[1:56:24] pray and stand there so reverently while
[1:56:29] he prays where God has opened that door
[1:56:32] for him and he is literally praying
[1:56:34] throughout the whole school. And I just
[1:56:37] thank God that he has led such a life
[1:56:40] and people have so much trust in him to
[1:56:44] pray over our school and I just thank
[1:56:47] God for that.
[1:56:50] [Applause]
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Certainly thank God. I I got two more
[1:56:57] hands. Come on. Uh mama, you you first.
[1:57:01] Amen. Thank God.
[1:57:04] Thank God.
[1:57:10] Bless your saints.
[1:57:13] I've been holding off sharing this
[1:57:16] testimony and I trust that it's okay.
[1:57:20] But uh
[1:57:23] I'm so thankful to the Lord for
[1:57:28] this message.
[1:57:30] I thank God for
[1:57:34] showing me that I had a gift. And this
[1:57:38] gift of being able to write songs, it
[1:57:41] was it came through the message. I
[1:57:45] didn't I had little diddly tunes I would
[1:57:47] write before then.
[1:57:49] God really just increased my walk in him
[1:57:53] that I was able to write songs and even
[1:57:57] to the point of also recording songs.
[1:58:01] Well, I I had a lot of them that were
[1:58:04] packed away
[1:58:05] and I I got discouraged many times
[1:58:10] because I couldn't see what was going to
[1:58:12] become of those songs that I had packed
[1:58:15] away.
[1:58:17] Many of them I had forgotten. And
[1:58:20] I had approached brother Jackson some
[1:58:22] years ago about recording some of them,
[1:58:24] but he didn't seem to be interested. He
[1:58:27] just didn't seem to be ready to do that.
[1:58:30] And uh just over a course of time, the
[1:58:33] Lord began to change his heart.
[1:58:37] And within the last six months, a little
[1:58:40] beyond that, we got serious about
[1:58:44] doing something with those songs.
[1:58:48] I thank the Lord for the end product.
[1:58:52] Finally,
[1:58:54] [Music]
[1:58:58] [Applause]
[1:59:00] I thank him that we waited until such a
[1:59:05] time as this. And I feel like this is
[1:59:09] the best way that those s songs could
[1:59:11] have come forth. And it's just been such
[1:59:13] a blessing to me. Every time I listen to
[1:59:15] the different ones, I think about the
[1:59:19] humble musings of my heart and see what
[1:59:23] they have progressed to become. I'm just
[1:59:26] blessed all over again. I I thank the
[1:59:28] Lord for how he did this. And I sure
[1:59:31] hope you've listened to them. Listen to
[1:59:34] some of those songs. And I'm not trying
[1:59:36] to sell it. God God knows I'm not try
[1:59:39] it. It's It's not something that needs
[1:59:41] to be sold. either you have a desire for
[1:59:44] them or you don't. But I I just thank
[1:59:46] God for what he did.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Uh he took those simple writings in my
[1:59:51] heart and has produced something so
[1:59:54] great that's going to just bless the
[1:59:57] world around.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:02] Amen.
[2:00:04] Certainly thank God uh for that. A lot
[2:00:07] of those songs, mama gave them to me
[2:00:10] over 20 to anywhere between 20 20 to 25
[2:00:14] year old songs that just got new life in
[2:00:18] this season. So, it it's something about
[2:00:20] waiting on the Lord. Uh when you wait,
[2:00:23] he he has this perfect timing for for
[2:00:25] everything. So, we thank God. I saw my
[2:00:28] wife's hand up. We'll have her. So, good
[2:00:30] to have her in service tonight. Amen.
[2:00:34] Thank God.
[2:00:38] Thank you. God bless you. Thank you um
[2:00:40] to all who prayed for me. I'm doing much
[2:00:43] better. Thank you. Um just um two things
[2:00:46] I wanted to mention. The first was um
[2:00:49] some not everybody but um some people
[2:00:52] know that I've been having problems with
[2:00:53] my knee um lately, the past couple
[2:00:57] months. And um and I just really was
[2:01:01] putting it off going to the doctor
[2:01:03] because I was just like um it'll get
[2:01:05] better. And I um I really didn't want
[2:01:09] somebody to tell me I would have to have
[2:01:11] surgery or something like that because I
[2:01:12] knew it was whatever it was. I knew it
[2:01:14] was serious, but I was just like, nah,
[2:01:17] you know, I'm just going to trust and
[2:01:18] believe God that that it'll get better.
[2:01:20] And um finally, I mean um I've been
[2:01:25] really really I mean it's it's been
[2:01:27] excruciating. I have a very very high
[2:01:30] pain tolerance and it was excruciating.
[2:01:33] I was taking 800 mgram ibuprofen every
[2:01:37] night just to go to sleep. Um because it
[2:01:40] it ju it hurt that bad and unfortunately
[2:01:43] I have a very high metabolism when it
[2:01:45] comes to medication. So it would
[2:01:47] literally wear off in 3 hours 800
[2:01:50] millig. So, I would just hope to be
[2:01:52] really really good good in sleep um so
[2:01:55] that I could just get through the night,
[2:01:57] you know. But um finally, anyway, I went
[2:01:59] to the doctor. I went to the doctor
[2:02:01] today and um really I just I found them
[2:02:06] out of the kind of out of the blue. I um
[2:02:08] I had been referred to someone and I
[2:02:10] called them and we went back and forth
[2:02:12] and apparently they didn't get my
[2:02:13] referral. So, it was just like, okay,
[2:02:15] well, I don't want to go to them anyway
[2:02:16] cuz it was like down in Deerfield or
[2:02:18] Delray or whatever. So, I found this
[2:02:20] doctor and he had an appointment today.
[2:02:22] I called yesterday, he had an
[2:02:24] appointment today. Went in and I was
[2:02:26] just he just made me feel so very
[2:02:28] comfortable and you know, I was just
[2:02:30] worried about what he was going to say
[2:02:32] and um but he made me really comfortable
[2:02:34] and never once said anything about
[2:02:37] surgery. Not one time. Didn't even
[2:02:40] didn't even say you're a candidate for
[2:02:41] it, but we could try other things.
[2:02:43] Nothing. He said nothing. And he was
[2:02:45] just like, "A series of injections and I
[2:02:47] need you to do some exercises, build up
[2:02:49] your your quad muscles, do this, do
[2:02:51] that, and take some, you know, um
[2:02:53] supplements and you'll be good." And I
[2:02:55] was just like, "Thank you, Jesus." So to
[2:02:58] um to to some that might be small, but I
[2:03:00] have absolutely never had any type of
[2:03:02] surgery. I have never been under
[2:03:04] anesthesia, and that is something I do
[2:03:06] not want to do. So I thank God for that.
[2:03:09] Um, number two, I just kind of wanted to
[2:03:12] piggyback off what Sister Tina was
[2:03:14] saying and actually what uh, Brother um,
[2:03:17] Whisper was saying tonight. Um, how we
[2:03:20] really don't know what we have. We
[2:03:23] really don't know what we have. Um,
[2:03:25] today, you know, and how it's so common
[2:03:28] to us. Um, today I was telling brother
[2:03:30] Jack that um I saw someone on social
[2:03:33] media and um it it's a young man and
[2:03:36] apparently he uh he's dancing
[2:03:40] from being a woman into a man. And um I
[2:03:43] I think um the video I saw I believe it
[2:03:46] was today and he was saying that this is
[2:03:48] day 56 of him being a Christian. And
[2:03:51] this young man, I I I've I've I've seen
[2:03:54] him through the week and um really one
[2:03:57] of his videos, I was sitting there
[2:03:59] watching it and I'm looking at it and
[2:04:00] he's just going to churches. He's just
[2:04:02] he doesn't know anything about anything.
[2:04:04] He doesn't know anything about God. He
[2:04:06] doesn't know anything. All he does is
[2:04:08] just read his Bible and whatever he sees
[2:04:09] in his Bible, he believes. And um and he
[2:04:12] so so he's just kind of going around in
[2:04:14] different churches trying to find, you
[2:04:16] know, some place where he feels
[2:04:17] comfortable, someplace where he feel
[2:04:19] that the Lord is leading him. And I told
[2:04:21] him, I said, I was watching one of his
[2:04:23] videos where he was talking about going
[2:04:24] to church and how he feels and all this
[2:04:27] stuff like that. And it literally
[2:04:28] brought me to tears because I was I was
[2:04:31] sitting there like the wonder that is in
[2:04:34] his eyes, you know, knowing where he
[2:04:37] came from and where he is now. And
[2:04:39] although he's on a journey, he's on, you
[2:04:41] know, he doesn't know what where he's
[2:04:43] going or what he's going to do, just the
[2:04:45] wonder that was in his eyes about just
[2:04:48] God doing simple things for him. Just
[2:04:50] just simple things. He was saying one
[2:04:52] time he went to a Bible study. Well, I I
[2:04:55] think that was today or yesterday. He
[2:04:57] went to a Bible study and he was sitting
[2:05:00] in the Bible study and he felt like the
[2:05:02] PE he didn't feel welcomed. He he really
[2:05:04] didn't feel welcomed. And um and he and
[2:05:06] it was one specific lady that that just
[2:05:08] kind of kept eyeballing him and his he
[2:05:11] has a girlfriend and his girlfriend and
[2:05:12] it just kind of kept eyeballing him. And
[2:05:14] so he started feeling anxious. He got
[2:05:16] up. He walked out. He went to the
[2:05:17] bathroom. He prayed and and he prayed
[2:05:20] for the lady and he said he said, "Lord,
[2:05:23] I don't know basically what's going on
[2:05:25] with her. Um you know, only you know,
[2:05:28] but if there if it if she has an evil
[2:05:30] spirit, Lord, I ask that you take it
[2:05:31] away from her and let her be joyful. And
[2:05:34] if but if it is an evil spirit and you
[2:05:37] don't want it to be around me, I ask
[2:05:38] that you just have her get up and leave,
[2:05:40] you know, whatever. And he was like, he
[2:05:42] said more than that, but he was
[2:05:43] earnestly praying for this lady. And he
[2:05:46] came back from the bathroom, sat down in
[2:05:48] his seat. He said as soon as he sat down
[2:05:49] in his seat, she got up and walked out.
[2:05:52] And he told his girlfriend that later
[2:05:54] on. And both of them was it was it was
[2:05:57] like totally shocking to them that God
[2:06:00] would actually answer a prayer just that
[2:06:03] quick. And and and I say that to
[2:06:06] piggyback off of what brother Whisper
[2:06:09] was saying because it has become so
[2:06:11] common to us. You know, we pray for
[2:06:14] things and I mean even even small
[2:06:15] things. I mean I'm driving through the
[2:06:17] parking lot. I'm like, "Lord, I need a
[2:06:18] closed park space cuz I'm lazy, you
[2:06:20] know, and and I find one, you know, and
[2:06:23] and I do say I say, "Thank you, Lord,"
[2:06:25] you know, and and and go on about my
[2:06:27] business. But I mean, these are things
[2:06:29] that should be happening. They should be
[2:06:31] happening every day. But as they happen,
[2:06:34] we should definitely
[2:06:37] every time, I don't care what it is,
[2:06:39] every time it happens, we should be at
[2:06:42] wonder just like this young man is. He I
[2:06:45] mean, doesn't know anything. and it's
[2:06:47] everything to him is beautiful. And I I
[2:06:51] believe that we all had a time and a
[2:06:53] place where we all felt that way about
[2:06:55] Christ. And and it's just it it really
[2:06:58] is refreshing to hear what what Brother
[2:07:01] Whisper said tonight because it's true.
[2:07:04] We've we've all been at that place where
[2:07:06] it's common to us. It we really have.
[2:07:09] And just like I said, just to see this
[2:07:11] young man and where he is. It's like,
[2:07:13] Lord, place that wonder back in me, you
[2:07:16] know, place it back in me to actually
[2:07:18] see the world in a totally different
[2:07:21] light to be able to have somebody you
[2:07:24] feel like is judging you or eyeballing
[2:07:26] you or whatever and you genuinely
[2:07:28] praying for them and not Lord, you know,
[2:07:31] that's a demon and I bind that. No, you
[2:07:33] know, literally praying for them and I
[2:07:35] don't know what the problem is, but
[2:07:37] Lord, I just ask you to touch them, you
[2:07:39] know, place that back in us. And I I I I
[2:07:43] truly believe that if we got back to
[2:07:45] that place, that's where we can begin to
[2:07:48] see things take place. We can begin to
[2:07:51] see the apo apostolic blessings take
[2:07:54] place in our midst. God bless you.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank God for for that,
[2:08:03] brother Solomon. Uh and I think he'll be
[2:08:06] the last one tonight. Brother Solomon.
[2:08:08] All right. God bless you all.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:08:12] I was uh sitting there thinking
[2:08:16] about giving a testimony about how we we
[2:08:20] actually moved here. And I was like,
[2:08:22] "No, I I'm coming up there every
[2:08:24] Wednesday about testifying and I I don't
[2:08:27] want to, you know,
[2:08:29] you know, I become common, I suppose."
[2:08:34] But my uh my wife, she put on the phone,
[2:08:38] why don't you give the testimony of how
[2:08:39] we moved here? So, I thought, yeah, it
[2:08:43] it's probably the right time. But I
[2:08:44] wanted to give another testimony before
[2:08:46] that. Um, sometimes
[2:08:50] we don't count our blessings like we
[2:08:52] should. Brother Whisper, he pulled up a
[2:08:54] a scripture that I was holding on to
[2:08:58] while we was moving. Whosoever forsakes
[2:09:01] father, mother, sister, brother houses,
[2:09:03] lands, I'll give him fathers, mother,
[2:09:05] sister, brother houses, and land. And I
[2:09:09] was holding on to that. And just earlier
[2:09:12] today, I was listening to uh well, I've
[2:09:16] been listening to the CD all day. My
[2:09:18] blessings are too many to number.
[2:09:22] And as I was listening to that that
[2:09:24] song, I I got to thinking back where the
[2:09:27] Lord found me. And when the Lord found
[2:09:31] me, I was up on stage with Five Guys
[2:09:35] singing. And we had just finished
[2:09:38] recording two singles.
[2:09:41] And I sat back and I was like, "My
[2:09:43] Lord."
[2:09:45] During the meetings, I was on the
[2:09:47] platform of five gods singing.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; And I actually sung on Brother Jack CD.
[2:09:53] I said, "Where the Lord found me, he has
[2:09:55] restored me back to that place."
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; And I thought, "My blessings are far too
[2:10:00] many to number."
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; What I was doing for Satan, he turned
[2:10:04] around.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; And now I'm doing it for the Lord. And
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; I wanted to thank him for for showing me
[2:10:10] that little thing that
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; restoration comes in so many different
[2:10:14] forms. And sometimes we're not looking
[2:10:17] for it, but it's there.
[2:10:19] But um I want to say uh last April or
[2:10:24] May
[2:10:26] um it was on my heart to actually just
[2:10:31] once our uh lease was up in Palm Bay to
[2:10:35] move in September.
[2:10:37] But um we kept delaying and one of the
[2:10:41] reason we kept delaying it was like uh I
[2:10:43] guess the inflation had hit our clients.
[2:10:46] Normally, you know, we have them on
[2:10:48] payment plans and it seemed like
[2:10:50] everybody just stopped.
[2:10:53] It's like, well, hey, where the money
[2:10:55] where the money going? So, I'm out here
[2:10:58] hustling, trying to get a job here, get
[2:11:01] a job there, back up somebody here, back
[2:11:03] up somebody there, and just working,
[2:11:05] working, working. And all these people
[2:11:07] just stopped paying. So, September came
[2:11:10] and went.
[2:11:13] October, November, December, me and my
[2:11:17] wife, we decided we was going to leave.
[2:11:19] But it was after
[2:11:21] we was listening to some meetings over
[2:11:23] in Dubai
[2:11:25] and there was a young man that gave his
[2:11:27] testimony that he shared tonight.
[2:11:30] And from Brother Whisper's testimony, we
[2:11:32] said, "Okay, we're going to move."
[2:11:36] So,
[2:11:38] we were supposed to move
[2:11:41] January 25th,
[2:11:44] and that was on a Wednesday. I believe
[2:11:47] it was the 25th. That Tuesday, we had a
[2:11:50] we had a home lined up to go to.
[2:11:54] That Tuesday,
[2:11:56] we got an email.
[2:11:58] We decided to go a different direction.
[2:12:01] So we had already had everything packed
[2:12:03] and in a storage here and we were
[2:12:06] leaving in the morning. That night we
[2:12:08] had brother's prayer. Brothers prayed
[2:12:10] and everything. So we came and we were
[2:12:13] in a hotel for a while. We were uh
[2:12:16] Airbnb for a while. Brother Quinton's
[2:12:18] for a little bit and then it's like
[2:12:22] these people still not paying. Finally
[2:12:25] we find find a a home. Uh and that this
[2:12:28] by this time it's now uh what was March?
[2:12:34] Yeah, it was in March. Two months had
[2:12:36] two months had gone by and we still just
[2:12:38] living in you know we just watching all
[2:12:41] the money that we're getting just going.
[2:12:44] So it was going to cost quite a bit um
[2:12:47] for us to get into the place where we
[2:12:49] are.
[2:12:51] And right when we're about to get in
[2:12:52] there,
[2:12:54] everybody decide to pay.
[2:13:03] [Applause]
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; But brother Whisper said there had to be
[2:13:08] a Cyrus somewhere.
[2:13:10] So there was a a Cyrus that helped us.
[2:13:13] And I was just I wanted to thank the
[2:13:15] Lord for how he he's an ontime God.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; Sometimes things get so dark and you're
[2:13:22] just looking, Lord, how is this going to
[2:13:24] take place? And he makes a way. And when
[2:13:29] we were laying in the bed um one night,
[2:13:32] one morning, my wife looked over at me
[2:13:35] and she said,
[2:13:37] "We were crazy."
[2:13:40] And I looked at her, I said, "Yeah, we
[2:13:41] were crazy. What we just been through
[2:13:44] was simply crazy, but God made a way."
[2:13:47] And I want to thank the Lord that we are
[2:13:48] here with you tonight. Something we
[2:13:51] couldn't do before. So God bless you.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:14:00] I certainly thank God for for making a
[2:14:02] way and and um it it means it means a
[2:14:06] lot just to hear what God is doing in
[2:14:09] the midst of his people. uh you never
[2:14:11] know who need to hear the testimony that
[2:14:13] you shared uh how it encourages them
[2:14:16] just to mix their faith and know that
[2:14:19] God can do the same for them. So, thank
[2:14:21] y'all so much. We uh we just appreciate
[2:14:23] the Lord. It it's something about having
[2:14:25] this freedom that we ain't had in a long
[2:14:28] time.
[2:14:29] uh and just being able to enjoy the
[2:14:31] presence of the Lord. And and and like I
[2:14:34] say, Sunday is our only little
[2:14:36] challenge, but um God going to work all
[2:14:39] that out. God going to work all that
[2:14:42] out. Praise God. Saints, we we thank God
[2:14:45] for you. Um let's have a word of prayer
[2:14:47] and uh we'll have the brothers come uh
[2:14:50] to dismiss us on tonight. We'll be back
[2:14:53] on Sunday morning 8:30 for prayer.
[2:14:55] Father, we thank you uh for all that
[2:14:58] you've done here tonight. Thank you for
[2:15:00] your word that went forth to strengthen
[2:15:02] and encourage our hearts. Uh thank you
[2:15:05] for your servant Lord that just yielded
[2:15:07] himself to minister once more uh to to
[2:15:10] this body, we trust Lord that as he
[2:15:14] prepares to return home that you would
[2:15:16] bless him in his journey, his church
[2:15:19] there waiting for him. I pray God that
[2:15:21] you bless the church and God may you uh
[2:15:24] just continue to get glory and honor out
[2:15:26] of all uh that they do. We also pray
[2:15:29] father that you would um uh bless the
[2:15:32] saints as they leave this place tonight
[2:15:33] but not your presence. May we go
[2:15:36] meditating and thinking on the things
[2:15:37] that you have spoken to us mixing our
[2:15:39] faith uh with it and living uh lives of
[2:15:43] expectation Lord just believing that
[2:15:46] you'll meet us in in supernatural ways.
[2:15:49] uh we we believe, oh God, that
[2:15:52] everything that was promised in in the
[2:15:54] book of Acts, Lord, is something that we
[2:15:56] are supposed to be striving for. So
[2:15:59] wherever we're falling short, God, we
[2:16:01] pray that you'd help us to align
[2:16:03] ourselves with the word that we might
[2:16:04] see the manifestation of all that you
[2:16:07] have spoken. Uh we trust, oh God, that
[2:16:10] uh you would just continue to get glory
[2:16:11] out of all that we're doing. Thank you
[2:16:13] for this little spirit of revival that
[2:16:15] you're giving to the church and
[2:16:17] restoration that's happening on on a
[2:16:19] daily basis right before our very eyes.
[2:16:21] Don't let it become common to us, but
[2:16:24] let us, Lord, always get the thrill uh
[2:16:27] from seeing what you're doing. Thank
[2:16:29] you, Father. You're doing mighty things
[2:16:31] right here in our midst. And uh Lord, we
[2:16:34] uh we have enough to to praise you for.
[2:16:37] So pray, Lord, that you would keep us
[2:16:39] until we're able to come back together
[2:16:40] again. It's in Jesus' name that we pray.
[2:16:44] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Uh the
[2:16:47] brothers will come at this time uh to
[2:16:50] dismiss us. God bless you.
