because they've got before me who can be against me so we just we dis appreciate the Lord Jesus we this is first Sunday the monthly just made a commitment to you all of that we would just report on our Building Fund pledges didn't realize that I did it yesterday Apple my Mac computer and for some reason it did you got a problem max but for some reason it didn't translate and I started having problems but never ain't able to put it up on the screen but just to give you an update we're still making progress amen in our build a funnel last month we recorded 1667 dollars they meant towards our building fund let's give God praise for that and the other increase a man from last month is that there was an increase in our pledges there's other people that joined and said we want to pledge towards this and I wanna I want to put me a little bit in there too if you ever want a source heed this is a time to sow one right and the more you so W reap but III feel like the hand of the Lord is upon what we're doing even right now and so our pledge amount has gone up to fifty six thousand eight hundred and nine dollars a man which we thank God for that a man thank you Jesus and on the pledged amount we have received year-to-date thirty three thousand two hundred twenty three dollars and four cents oh thank god a bad sis that's exactly right to God be the glory and you know justjust I believe we are in a season where the angel is trouble in the water and and it's time to jump in that's all I could say it's time to jump in so we were under a man under under expectation a man sister was sharing a dream with me that the Lord had given her and I won't breathe the dream I just kind of give you the highlights but it was a dream as if we were going to a meeting someone was gonna preach and we were headed towards this meeting and you know we all jumped in a car and we got there to the meeting and it's pretty big you know the preacher that was becoming everybody wanted to come here so we got in the car had to park in the parking lot but the parking lot was so big that we had to get like a trolley to ride up to the building where to preach was preaching and you know so as we got Charlie there was another may have jumped on the trial again I guess he was kind of scratching himself and it seemed like he had a a disease there he was dealing with sort of sister saying I think you you got this you know what you named a disease that he had and and he like yeah yeah you know and we went on to the meeting when we got there it was brother branham preaching and so brother Brandon preached and the man that jumped in the trolley with us for the brand I'm happened to call him out and his condition now and say it's gonna be alright you're healed he said that's all I needed to hear so all I need to hear he said he walked away from there believing that he was ill but her sister said she had in her heart she just wanted to get brother Brandon detention she just you know I just love to talk to him if I could and when she had a heart she she loved eyes and maybe and you know pretty much kind of he was inviting her to come on over you know so she was making her way with somebody coming a little kid got in front of her there little girl got in front of him you know and everything and you know the girl got for the grade of detention so she just kind of waited and when the girl walked away then she went up and she be getting the cover it'll just gets converse for the Branum and he's like sister what would you what what do you want what do you want and and she said well I'm so she said brother Brandon told say be specific be be specific so when she heard that she just said okay it's just this distance she made it very specific after the things that she wanted and brother Branham told say okay you can have it you can have it so when when she said that to me I felt that God was telling me through the dream be specific and I told God the address of the church I told him exactly where it was all right and I said Lord this is what I want [Music] so God know the address I can't tell all y'all that right now but but I told God the address of the church I told him everything that I wanted and I want I want the houses I want the apartment so I wanted I want the school I won't I see you work in others I need you to work for me I've seen your work for others I need you to work for me god I've seen you work for others [Music] you [Music] it's already done [Music] thank you [Music] come on love our time with your boys [Music] No whoa hallelujah glory glory thank you Jesus would you touch and agree with somebody say it's already done touch and agree with somebody it's already done [Music] Oh glory to God thank you Jesus let's give God some fries in this place god bless you thank you musicians certainly appreciate it man you all own today my god my god a man just turn with me in your Bibles we'll read a scripture I want to thank the Lord for all the specials that went forth amen on today certainly appreciate him and the presence of the Lord and that the worship as well amen yes you know we just we just appreciate the Lord I have a little thought here that I want to share with you all today is I would say it's gonna be somewhat evangelistic a man in nature and but I pray to be a blessing to you a man as we just kind of share from a heart so I'm today amen everyone standing that can stand as we read the word of the Lord a man Romans chapter 6 Romans chapter 6 a man and verse 23 romans 6 and verse 23 very familiar scriptures for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord so the wages of sin you get paid for sin right you get paid for it a man and your payment is death right which is which which means eternal separation a man from God the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord and also over here in Hebrews chapter 9 verse 22 speaks this a man says and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood there's no remission Amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just pray Amen over what we've read here today father we thank you for your word that we've read but now God let the Holy Spirit take us a little deeper into the thought that you want to present to us today God get glory and get honored a man out of everything that'll be shared and Lord we know the enemy would love to try to distract us so that we can't hear what the Spirit is trying to speak to us but father we we ask that that you would just give us power to overcome the faults of the enemy and even now God as your son here on earth we take control over the atmosphere we take control over every thought we take control over everything God that Satan would try to do to prevent us from receiving from you we're here God to hear from heaven speak now Lord is our desire our prayer and god we we also just want to pray maybe somebody's getting a blessing this morning Lord next-door and just pray that you would just do something special form and and the most important thing that could ever happen is bring people to the knowledge of truth so Lord let us be a light amen in the midst of all that is around us Oh God let us be a light with cream so Jesus name we ask it amen amen god bless you can be seated there's a little thought that I have here in my heart that I wanna I want to share we want to title this a man this morning settle it a man settle it a man and I pray that the Lord will just bless us as we journey through this let me just take my time a man building us to where we want to go here I want to read from this this this sermon a man oneness this sermon oneness the Prophet makes a statement here and it says now when we see this see the penalty must be paid and this is the this is the part that I really want to kind of drive home the penalty the penalty must be paid and this uh this is actually the penalty for sin okay it must be paid and note the highest form of animal life is a human being and the human being fail itself so how can one human save another this is important because it wasn't Adam that redeemed Eve amen Adam could not redeem her he fell in sin so he could not redeem her he was a type of a man of Christ leaf thrown in Laura coming down a man to bring us redemption story he who was sinless became sin that what me we might become righteous right but but there was a penalty that had to be paid because of sin because of what Adam did in the garden there was a penalty for sin that had to be paid it had to be settled and only Christ could do to do the settling for us right so he said so one human so how can one human save another and take in God and God and spirit cannot die so God had to bring his self a little lower than the Angels Hebrews the first chapter the first verse had to make his self lower than the Angels in order to take death to pay the penalty to bring the oneness between man and God again so the Holy Ghost could come back right say the debt of sin was paid Jesus had to do this sin the Holy Ghost back to punt to unite people again like it was in the Garden of Eden the debt was paid when Jesus died I love that the debt was paid when Jesus died that settled it right amen brother if I could only get it to Sookie and see the dentist paid hallelujah to the lamb the debt is paid and every man and woman hear me this morning or will hear me by the tape your penalty is paid a man don't you disbelieve God's Word again I love that your penalty is paid don't you disbelieve God's Word again all right said come back to the word don't it says don't believe he he was the word glory I feel like shouting he says I honest I do you say the penalty is paid it's all over no wonder angel screamed and saying the anthems of heaven ring out yes sir the lost sheep was found appropriation was made for him to be restored again the waters the separation God's word that washes him from his iniquity when the word died in my place and was resurrected again and became a man permanent in my life in my heart amen the penalty is paid it's over we are redeemed I love that see that you know there was a the depth of sin had to be settled and only one that could do it was the Lord Jesus and you know as I was thinking on this a man little thought here and all honesty this thought was given to me while I was in Israel the first time and I never preached this sermon for you I like I don't know why I held on to it for so long but God knows all things and you know there was a little situation kind of going on there at the time and where I was Amen I was standing in the Dead Sea when God inspired this to me now and I and I think that's important as to where you are and you know and what's going on and and and you know just how God inspires see but you know there was a little something just kind of transparent and I was conversing with the brother back and forth a man at that time on the phone and you know and we were just kind of sending text back and forth and and as I was just kind of conversing with the brother just kind of hit my heart said you need to settle it right a man you need to settle you need to get to a point where you're sick and tired of being sick and tired right you need to get to a point where you're tired of a man going in and out a man you got to get to a point where I'm interstate right amen and and and not only am i up but i'ma keep going further up I'm tired of going back down hallelujah amen and seeing all these thoughts begin to counter pour through my mind while I'm standing in the Dead Sea hallelujah amen uh let me just kind of go a little further with this because you know what came to me as I was just kind of writing a little few notes around saying when you go to a restaurant amen and many of you all might go after you leave here amen today and you know that the issue is that they have no problem with you coming amen but but but be either before you eat or after you eat you're gonna have to settle some things hey man you know and and you know it didn't count I don't know if you go to you know Golden Corral the restaurant that just opened here next door to us here you know they're gonna let you you know go to ground when you walk in you can't even get to the food hello somebody that I mean I don't care how it you can look at other people's plates as they walking by say I want some of this and I want some of that but you ain't going nowhere near a food until you settle it right you got to pay before you go in hallelujah Amen over to the little restaurant next door they let you kind of pick and choose this and pick and choose that but before you go to the table to eat it any man you have to settle it there's some restaurants that you can go and sit down and just enjoy the meal hallelujah amen but before you leave that restaurant somebody gonna walk up to you how did you enjoy it today and they're handing you a little check because they looking for you to settle some things hello somebody if you can't leave the restaurant without settling you are not gonna leave this earth without settling it with God's you can either pay now or pay later but you don't settle this thing hello somebody you got to settle it this is your bill you got to double it in a rack up a bill of sin you go settle it with God either now or later you don't minister people sit down just keep on eating add this to it and add that to it you add this same you're at that seam and you're at this sin you had that sin do gonna settle this thing get ready you're gonna sell you can't ain't know about and you know you know they have this state this my wife was telling me recently about this guy that's just got arrested he would help me you know y'all you know don't get so desperate you out here just getting some young man off the internet hear what his plan to take advantage of every woman so he were and where he did it he would go to it you know let's meet at this restaurant let's meet each other at the restaurant and and he sit down order for the most expensive stuff and just sit there having a good conversation and when the bill is about to come what he do is excused himself as I gotta run to the restroom real quick and you don't know the guy you don't know right this is your first time meeting and you know what that man he he don't go to the bathroom he slip out some dough somewhere and he leave you with the bill and the young lady is stuck there with the building he that he even got a reputation from going around to the most expensive restaurants and leaving this big tab like that they finally caught him and put him put him away for say so so so you don't look somebody gotta pay this you you you you're gonna all hallelujah some of y'all young people think your mama gonna pay it some of you think your daddy I'm paying somebody gotta pay this somebody gotta settle this thing hallelujah and you don't want to be left holding the bag but I'm gonna tell you one of the greatest feelings that you can experience in a restaurant it's when you sit down at being an eight real good now you know you've got to settle I'll lose somebody but somehow someway right before you can get the check and you action for the check what you don't found out is that somebody else buddy asked I'm selling it for you and we're gonna ate up all that good food you start looking around and try to figure out who settle this and I'm here to tell you this morning if you got a debt of seeing somebody's all they paid the price all you gotta do is accept what they have done see when the bill has been paid you ain't got to go back to the cash register at tool now let me let me let me let me take care of this no no it's already been settled they won't even take your money because it's already been settled Jesus Christ has settled it for you if you will accept it now I'm gonna tell you something when you really really really have it you know when you've experienced somebody selling for you it creates a joy it creates a man eh you know it just creates a desire to want to get to know who this person was sometime they go unnoticed hey man you never date are coming going you had no idea what time that happened us we were sitting around we don't ate up all this food and I'm like and I'm sitting that thing like oh boy all right here come to check let me look and see how much damage it's done and when the check comes say service already take I said so I started going back to the restaurant trying to dress the same way I was dressed before make a menu looking for that blessing all over here hallelujah somebody it feels good when somebody settles it if you feel like that over food you want to be rejoicing that your sins have been settled through the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah glory to God before you leave this earth your debt of sin has to be settled so yeah you know and when I'm when I'm talking about this you know again I'm referring back if you got a life of up and down Christianity it's time to settle it right it's time to come to a place like okay this is it this is it you know I can go back in my own life where you know one time I was I was out of church and they played this film on the burn in hell and man they start showing how people is going to hell I say Lord I don't want to go and see they made me feel you know it was something that kind of worked with my emotions and then my emotions I'm like I don't want to go to hell so I need to start living right and I tried my best to live right right but up but what I found out is that I couldn't do it in my own strength a man so I was failing over and over and over again trying to live right you know realize that that thing had not been settled I thought it was when I went to the altar I thought it was when I saw I thought it was settled but it really wasn't said I was still struggling with sin hello somebody Amen but there come a time where you know one one one day I was at work and God sent this lady across my path and as she just began to talk to me about the Lord and you know I she was in her 80s and that lady was talking to me about the Lord and she said now you know young man do you know do you know the Lord I say well I go to church he said no no that's not what I asked you do do you know the Lord said go in the church don't settle in a man I remember my pastor say just because you live in the barn don't make you a pig huh hey man just because you live in the palace don't make you the king hallelujah somebody right you say say say say he you know you got to you know she say she said and ask you did you go to church I said did you I mean do you really know the Lord I said well she said she said look you know you ain't gotta wait till you get the church to give you a heart to the Lord you can do it right here she said want to give me a heart till I say and she just got in the car she moved on but she planted a seed and when that lady planted that seed inside of me I say Lord you know I found a way to get back out that to that parking lot she said that I said Lord the ladies say I ain't gotta wait I get a church I want to settle things right here I want to invite you into my heart I want you to live I want you to watch me from my sins right here in this parking lot and I can take you to the parking lot cuz it's still there where God settle things for me hallelujah I would tell you something you ought to have a stake driven down Amen as to where things got settled in your life and that man I am NOT going back to seeing not willfully oh come on somebody it's one thing when you get tripped up or somebody if you get tripped up your repent quick but but when you willfully go back in and out of sin something that's not settled Jesus has not become your absolute can we go a little further you know I think we need to preach it like this sometime to a man I think people you know cuz we got a lot of up and down Christians a man in and out Christians glory to God amen and God want to set us something look you got the paper for seeing amen and not now if you if you if you if you won't accept what Christ has done for you they may he's already paid the price but he wants you to live according to his word you got to settle this thing listen before you leave Earth your debt for sin has to be settled going to church won't settle it but truly accepting Christ as your Savior will settle it alright and I wrote this also when when Christ has become your TrueNorth a man then you know that things are settled with God's when it becomes your TrueNorth and see what happens like with a hunter a man of people that countered well you know they aren't they're a hunting or maybe just they like nature whatever they understand things they understand about a true north right and when you lost you looking for a true north and the way that sometimes they find that true north is they would go on a particular side of the tree that certain moss that would grow on that side of the tree and once they once they kind of rub their hand on that Mouse take know exactly which direction to go into hallelujah amen you got to know that you lost a man without God you are lost I don't care what you accomplish in this life you're a lost and at the end you gonna have to settle it all right now Romans 3 Twitter's safer says this for all have sinned and come short of the glory God so we all need the settlement for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God another thing in from Psalms 51 and verse 5 says behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me that means you came out of your mother's womb lost you're gonna need to settle it I don't care who your mama is I don't care who your daddy is you got to settle some things with God hey man Psalms 58 and three says the wicked are estranged from the womb they go straight as soon as they be born speaking lies hallelujah so you were shaped in iniquity born and sin came into the world speaking lies you need to settle some things with God hallelujah I was just looking at a couple things that I want to just kind of share here oh my god this is let me go to the message and an inside I'm sorry divine love divine love let's go to this message divine love oh my god it says when God seen the sin of this world and seeing that man was dying without hope and could not be saved and yet he knows that man would love him extreme gods he says and it proved his nature God's nature is love God is love and it's trained God's nature until he had to provide a way of escape but for those who want to escape all right it constrained God to provide a way of escape for those who want to escape all right and he sent his son to the world made in the likeness of sinful flesh to bear our sins in sickness to Calvary GUP did it the love of God going out call for Sovereign Grace and God never said if you'll do it if you'll do this I'll do this God without any conditions he sent his son to die in your place and settle the same question had nothing to do with what you think about it Amen God did it anyhow amen divine love and when you're straight in when you're strange Sovereign Grace has to take its place that's all there is when divine love jet love just sets at the right place and brother branham just kind of saying you know you get yourself to a little Jam where you strain a man God has depth the kind of interact into your situation let you know what he's already done you don't have to carry that burden of sin more hallelujah you can settle things today glory to God let me go in a little further an ensign he says Adam really expressed that says the first man on after finding that he had fallen from grace he tried to take his own intelligence and make a way back to God without an atonement amen he tried to go back to God without making an atonement something to pay for his sins after the penalty of God was death he tried to go back without a death atonement and men are still trying to do that trying to make a religion without an atonement in it Oh hallelujah can I just be honest with you God don't only want your money because we try to do this without an atonement amen yea God God does require for us pay our tithes and offerings and things like that but often we think just because we give God our tithes and offerings that we've done enough that's not gonna settle it a man you gotta have to accept the blood atonement that happened at Calvary and you're gonna have to walk underneath that I told man you're gonna have to live underneath that atonement 24/7 living under the atonement hallelujah somebody right he'd say he said he tried to go back to God without making an atonement something to pay for since after the penalty of God was death he tried to go back without a death or told me man I'm still trying to do that trying to make a religion without an atonement in it amen Adam made himself a covering out of fig leaves and I was just listening to her brother a man on last night he says see those those fig leaves a man made up made of covering but jesus didn't make a covering at Calvary Jesus actually brought forgiveness hallelujah not just the covering it's forgiveness of what you've done right and at first you got to admit that you're wrong the gods hallelujah admit that you're on the God when you can admit that you're wrong then God can do something for you right he said he say but he say it wasn't it wasn't just a covering a man but it was forgiveness and when you when you actually have forgiveness oh my the reason that you want forgiveness is because once you receive it it shows that it can never be a man it could never be brought against you anymore a covering is still there but forgiveness is go amen it is deleted it's forgotten about you want to receive forgiveness of your sins not just a covering for your sins you need forgiveness for your sins hallelujah the debt must be paid alright let's go on a little further here he says and man I'm still trying to do that trying to make a religion without an atonement in it Adam made of stuff recovering out of fig leaves with no blood shed for his covering and God refused him and he has refused he has refused it then he will always refuse it because without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins he just can't get back because the penalty is death and something has to die to pay that penalty so it can it can only be a substitutionary or we're all in death if there wasn't a substitute for us to hold on to and man and doing this realize that he needs something to hold on to something that he can put his hands on something he can say that's it I've got it I know it's it and I'm gonna tell you you got to come to a spot in your own Christian life where you know what that it that when when you say that's it we got to know I got that relationship with Jesus and I know that I've settled things amen and once you know that it's been settled with the Lord my god amen it's a certain way that you carry yourself and like I said at the restaurant you know you somebody you found that somebody than paid for you it creates an excitement it creates a joy it creates a man of peace my God hear you thinking man I was gonna be out a lot of money no no no it's already settled it's already taken care of and and and I remember one time I actually I you know I I paid for somebody's meal when I told you cash you don't let him know who did it don't let him know who did I just you know I said I just I just want to be a blessing to so I paid for the milling and I just sat there and I kind of looked at the color of my iron when I did I saw the guy just counting the cash she walked on him say it's already paid for I saw him just kind of jump up start looking around like who did it he was excited to know who he wanted to know who did that he I mean he could he could now it's like he couldn't leave the restaurant until he knew who would make a sacrifice like that right who would paid a price for me and I tell you what well if we have that type of experience in a natural restaurant why can't we have the same type of excitement looking a man to express our thanks to a god that would go to a cross and die for our sins Amen we we ought to be in a spot where we can't wait to get to church just to worship Him and praise Him because we know that he's the one that settled it for us my debt was too great to pay if you think about where God has brought you from your debt was too great to pay but Jesus Christ has paid it all oh I'm so glad he settled it I'm so glad he settled it now let me just kind of you know just kind of drop in to a couple things here I want to tell you how we are living in a time where sin is on the ramp on this rampage let's read something over here in Genesis you know the Bible actually tells us as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man as it was in the days of life so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man now I'm gonna pick up here in Genesis 6 and I'll just hold on one second there I'll give you the verse in a second but you know I when we just kind of think about as it was in the days of Noah saying that reached to rampage I mean I mean reach reached a threshold where God just could not do any more with man only thank God could do was destroy a man and what was happening is that the people were actually paying for their sins when they when they are when they refuse to get on the boat right they refused the way that God had made for them in that hour they had to pay for the sin that was being committed on the earth right so so what I want you to understand is that if it was if the promise is as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the comments on the man men today will pay for their sin hallelujah men they will pay for their sin let's look at it because the conditions in Noah's day with match conditions of today let's look at Genesis 6 verse 11 oh my god hallelujah amen look at this verse 11 the earth also was corrupt before God amen and just look at these words the reason that God wanted to destroy the the man from the earth in North Day is because the earth became corrupt before God a man not only that the earth was filled with violence now you tell me they say in a world Amen where we see violence every everywhere violence I mean I mean you can't turn you can't go nowhere without seeing violence you're afraid to go Christmas shopping huh because of the violence that's out there you have no idea what people do to you Gloria I mean here what folk will shoot you for cutting them off in traffic now I didn't cut you off I had my blinker on for five minutes I didn't cut you off right but because of the love the Bible say the love of many has wax cold Amen people don't care anything about life anymore right hey hallelujah if this is not I mean everywhere you turn and I forget I forget what the stat is but they said they said over the last so many years there's been so many yet mass shootings what what's the stat on that helmet how many this year 300 so 350 we are got 365 days in a year over 350 mass shootings all over the world it's not just not just us but all over the world mass shooting incidents and you tell me this is not a world full of violence Oh y'all forgot you oh you can't go see spider-man you can't go to go see spider-man and you're trying to get in oh I want to be there the first one a man to see it as soon as it's released well there's a guy waiting for you when you get there huh right all the little places that we think we can go because we haven't fun there's a devil waiting on us but coming to that environment hallelujah somebody that's why you came love the world on the things of the world right but but that's a devil waiting on you in them environments hallelujah actually some churches you can't even go to right there Devil's waiting in the audience trying to take people out hallelujah glory to God amen and I know there's many churches that you know nowadays they they have a policy a man of who can carry a gun and and who can't in the church my god I mean and I understand that you know that might be necessary but that that is uh that that shows me that we're living in the times of Noah right now that you got to have people position in the church with a gun just to stop some outbreak it's the truth in it hi sin has reached our ultimate a man seeing this it's I mean it's just impossible for God not to destroy somebody gonna pay for this you know brother Brad was talking about a little story this this man he had called him in he's a rancher and he had sheep on his farm and he says you know as he was out they said now those cheap costs money he makes money off till she saying one morning one morning he goes out there monks of sheep and a lot of them are dead and he realized what happened that lion had got in in the night inside the pen and just destroyed some of those sheep brother branham said you know it's unfortunate but because the man lost about $3,500 in one night he said the other lions had to pay for it come on somebody when things go wrong in your house and you know you know parents that have more than one child a man you know some time to cheer the kids got another sibling in the house and that simply is I don't know so the sibling I don't know where we give birth to I don't know right if it's so many of y'all this has happened in the house somebody gonna get it somebody gonna have to settle this thing somebody gotta pay for it since you ain't got no money you're gonna get my belt come on somebody right but somebody gotta pay for this thing and then a lying spirit get amongst the children and the lying spirit come and say I don't know you mean you were sitting right there watching it and you gonna tell me you don't know hallelujah somebody see you when you don't let things get I mean and when you get that I don't know thing what what typically happen what happened in my house okay since nobody know everybody right since nobody know everybody gets it come on somebody hallelujah glory to God glory to God see things have to be settled at some point in time you just can't keep getting away with what you're doing you got to settle this thing let's look at this in Scripture again because Genesis 6 gives us a really really good Amen illustration a picture of what we're looking at in this day the earth also was corrupt before God when the earth was filled with violence and God looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth now notice that this there was only a few people that God actually gave grace to because everybody else was corrupt the ones that he gave grace to was knowing his family everybody else was corrupt think about that he says says God looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth look at verse 13 and God said unto Noah the end of all flesh is come before me for the earth is filled with violence a man threw filled with violence through them and behold I will destroy them with the earth now you know if the scripture tells us that as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man we see the same signs of violence all over the earth we see sin amen has reached its peak some of the stuff that people do nowadays it's unbelievable a man the truth and a half you know brother Branham talked about some of the sins that happened in his day he talked about how you know husbands and wives would go to a hotel amen and hear a husband and his wife going to a hotel with other husbands and wives and then they just start throwing names in a cup this is what the Prophet talked about in his day said he thought through our names in the cup and then the wife would actually reach in and pull the name either cup and whatever name she got like the cup is the person she had to go into the room with her husband taking his wife to something like that that is pathetic not 60 years ago imagine what people do or nowadays huh glory to God we know sinners have an all-time high people got a creative things that you were never even imagined going on in their life somebody gonna settle this thing somebody gonna settle this thing somebody gonna pay for this and I'm advising you if I'm telling you Jesus has already paid for anything that you've done there's not one thing you can do where God can forgive you of it but you got to accept it let's go on a little further my God my God you know even in the days of Joshua where sin had reached a peak Joshua had to stand up and say to Jesus day whom you gonna serve that thing had to be settled right a man in the days of lot Senate reached its peak and and and God just couldn't take no more he sent investigating angels of judgment down in the days of lot and when they come down to see all the sin that was happening amen on the earth at that time my god it had to be settled and God rained fire and brimstone down from heaven and to and wiped that city out because of the sin somebody gonna pay for the sin alright I think God in the human race God put something in place hallelujah somebody's got to pay God set the penalty but I don't not only did he set the penalty he paid the penalty that's what grace does for us right he set the penalty then he comes along and he pays the penalty and you know and what he put in place for us there in in the Book of Jeremiah you know we saw where you had to have a kinsman redeemer also in the Book of Ruth where it showed that they had they had to have a kinsman redeemer if a man got himself in trouble glory to God the Levitical law showed that if he got himself in trouble and-and-and-and and he needed somebody not a good thing about this is that you couldn't just have your friend pay for you hallelujah hey man you can have your BFF take care of this for you glory to God amen amen you can have just an acquaintance take care of this price for you amen according to the vehicle law you had to have somebody that was blunt relation Oh glory to God if they have any blunt relation in order to take care of this anybody else that would show up to try to take care of your debt amen would be denied but if somebody that was blood related to you showed up then the debt would be settled hallelujah and it just showed that we mean it to have a god that was related to us by blood that's why he took on the flesh of Jesus Christ so he could die in our stead and once once he has died and presented it to God it has been accepted we don't have to die for that no more church let me just let me just show you something brother Branham made the comment he says it says the kinsman redeemer the kinsman redeemer our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ a man he settled the thing for us all we got to do is accept it and I'm here today doing everything I can to encourage you to accept what God has already done for you don't leave this church today with the thing unsound if you try to leave a restaurant with things unsettled what happens what happens you might find you might find some lights you know coming right behind you and tell me let me let me just also just let you help you understand we're never light so coming up behind you it's not a good feeling it's not a good feeling but but one day you you realize the demons of Hell might be coming up behind you and when you get to that point it won't be a good feeling because you had an opportunity to settle it but you tried to run from it you gonna pay either now or later but you gonna pay let me go on a little further the the brief between the seven churches in the seven seals it's time to settle this thing Oh glory to God actually let me I want to go to the manifestation of the spirit you're gonna have to settle this thing glory to God okay I can take you to the spot where I settle a man a minute you all have the same type experience you knew that Lord this is it I've made my confession and it's the last one I'm making praise God look at this manifestation of the Spirit he says now when Jesus died at Calvary he says he sent up the sink question forever before the Father because he was a perfect sacrifice for our sin he was our kinsman redeemer you Bible scholars know what I'm speaking of like Boaz he had to be a kinsman redeemer to redeem the loss of state of Ruth and he had to make a public testimony and then everything that Ruth had failed to him as he redeemed all of her possessions and he of course he got when he redeemed Naomi why he got Ruth in which is a type of the Gentile bride and so forth but he was a kinsman redeemer now God who is in spirit availed himself in a body of flesh which was his son Christ Jesus and God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and become kinfolks to human beings to suffer the penalty that he had put on human himself and he became kinfolks and a redeemer in other words like this we was put in the devil's pawn shop and Jesus paid the price and brought us out see the price was already paid now when Jesus died at Calvary he saved every sinner in the world ever would be in the world as far as God was concerned listen now you wasn't saved ten years ago or two years ago or three years ago I wasn't saved seventeen years ago I was saved 2000 years ago but I accepted it 17 years ago so you were saved when Jesus died at Calvary but the question is have you accepted it in order to settle it now Jesus didn't come come down and digest for me or digest for you he said of the sink but it'll never do us any good until we accept it you know what if some people is just a good story and I'm not here just to tell you a good story I'm here to tell you need to settle this thing I've seen I've been around Church way too long to see people in and out up and down you know sometimes got the victory sometimes so defeat it hey man you know some you can even while I'm preaching this sermon right now there's people named mine thinking about okay about two weeks from now I'm giving up where you get that thought from you already you know someone's got it mapped out when we gonna fall that's a shame before God you got this thing already mapped out okay I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do damned it and then WHAM that's it and you know where you go through with your plans I'm trying to warn you in Jesus name settle it today said early make me make make a make a decision once and for all I'm gonna serve God and I ain't doing nothin else hallelujah everybody gotta come to that place going to church ain't settled in it huh paying your tithes ain't settling it I'm talking about a real commitment cuz if you got a real commitment to God you'll pay your tithes anyway a man giving her offering that's not settling it huh I mean I'm talking about really giving your heart to Jesus you know time of my life glory to God you know I remember my pastor pull me to the side one time and you know I was going to church I was doing all those things but he pulled me to the side one time and he asked me a question say when you gonna give all your heart to Jesus when you're gonna give all your heart to Jesus not wanna ask the same question to you today when you're gonna give all your heart to Jesus oh it ain't good enough just to say you believe the message it ain't good enough just to say you believe a prophet you know people learn the lingo and you can talk the lingo you can do all that but your life is a wreck and the reason that it's a wreck is because things are not settled hallelujah at some more time you got to come to a conclusion reason God even brought you to this truth it's so that you could settle it the Bible say you know the truth and the truth will make you free this is why God did that so you cannot sell without God your life was gonna always be in shambles hallelujah but you can have an abundant life if you just surrendered to him can I go a little further he wasn't safe ten years ago or two years ago three years ago I wasn't safe seventeen years ago I was saved 2000 years ago but I accepted it seventeen years ago listen now Jesus didn't come down and digest for me or digest for you he settled distinct question but if it'll never do us any good until we accept it it's your accepting of him I want to put this on Jesus I wanna I wanna I wanna exalt him so high today even if it's your accepting of him of Christ as your personal Savior mama couldn't save you daddy couldn't save you preacher can save you but Jesus be it and it's your accepting of him as your personal Savior and it's by faith that you receive it and believe it hello he says now in Hebrews 3:1 the Bible said that he's the high priest of our confession and he's sitting at the right hand of the Father make intercession for us upon our confession and I love that there's a maybe one other thing that I want to just kind of read to you here because when you when you when you the first thing is is believe that he did it the second thing is confessed that he did and the third thing is live underneath that confession first believe that Christ did it ii accept what you did third start living underneath that you know III can't I can't get you to even see the deeper things of God I can get this settled oh my god I told you this happened to me while I was in the Dead Sea find it kind of amazing you know that I was standing there in the Dead Sea and God would just kind of speak this to my heart there's some things you know that's special about the Dead Sea first thing is that it's almost 9 times saltier than the regular ocean right the Dead Sea is almost 9 times saltier they said it's also known as the earth lowest elevation on land the dance sea is known as the as the earth lowest elevation on lamb and because of the high levels of salt or salinity they call it the high levels of salinity no plant or animal can live inside the Dead Sea right no plant or animal can live inside the Dead Sea and you know and when you just kind of you know just start looking at some of these things me standing there in the Dead Sea and God telling me you know we gotta settle it right I just begin to kind of think to myself say you know if this is the lowest a man elevational land what we need maybe somehow to get to the altar right get to a low spot a man where they can just kind of come before God and just say Lord I want to settle things and and maybe you've got to go through some things that life has brought you to a very low point a man and that's ok because at this low point this is the place where God wants to meet you where you can settle some things he can't bless you until you settle it the other thing about the Dead Sea is that if you settle it there amen and I'll just may think of the name dance see right if you can just die out to yourself if you can die out to sin right if you can just give it up it just died to it when a man is is they're just something that don't bother him no more right I am wish you want you to have your own personal dance C experience I want you to understand some things because a lot of us alone I wanna I wanna I'm gonna have to pick on sister Brown she was a little timid when she went to the Dead Sea and this is this is some of us approach God this way we it's hard for us to give it all up I'm talking to you it's hard for us to let it all go but but I'm gonna tell you when you can bring it to the Dead Sea and you can actually just sit yourself in the day at sea I want you to know something I don't care and the dance here is pretty deep but I don't care how deep it is because of the salinity inside the Dead Sea you can't drown he couldn't let me drown but his daddy took me in right you came trou if you commit yourself to the PMC and I will tell you that fear we might round you that's it when I kill you if you commit yourself to Jesus Christ will it hold me cansu it up we don't know we we don't we don't we don't we don't have confidence that the blood can actually wash us we don't have confidence that the blood can actually cleanse us we don't have confidence that the blood can actually stop us from our sin just like what y'all say j-just sit down sister Brown just just said what y'all say so the brown way huh what y'all what do you want and everybody out just sit around floating they just I mean you can stop sister cop from floating come on somebody she got so excited she had a phone in her pocket and the Middle's of the Dead Sea gotta hold the phone right Buster Cobb just floating all over the place said Amen she was she was very comfortable but sister Brown said I don't know about this I don't know about that and then that's the way some of us approach God huh we don't we don't we don't have the confidence that he can take care of it God will turn your life around oh if you'll give him a chance gotta give you more than you ever bargained for if you give him all of you I don't know I'm not sure y'all say what just just sit down yes sit down yes sit down all because it's a little it's a it takes faith to believe that the water girl whoo yeah hallelujah it takes faith to believe that the blood Amen can wash you it takes faith to believe that the blood gonna settle things for you huh but about farming sister Brian got to the point she you seen folk we didn't thought we'd it forward and farmers she sat down and she was floating all over the place she started floating on nine she like she like she she got she got the floating in and she moving on the island moving on night and she's just going further for that say sister Brown you ain't got to go all that before huh now come on back in like we say when we say night night now come on back to come back you know how to here come now I'm in here my hi come back you know well you know what do I do now she say we say sister Brown just stand up hey baby I mean you ain't deep enough to harm you amen and it won't drown yeah you can trust Jesus you can trust Jesus we say not just damn up sister you won't float out there just step up she said just then I say just step up she got up and walked right on back to the shore I see I thank God you know God God would give me just this little thought here while I'm while I'm sitting there in the Dead Sea settle it to today don't don't leave with that selling I mean if you if you ain't really really committed it all over to him can I invite you to do that today I mean I'm talk about really surrendered did let me read you something here out of here he him he says you have a barrel meet here and a barrel of salt here it'll never save you got meat and salt you just got two barrels of it it'll never save you say the salt will never save the meat till it contacts it and we got to be salty and then contact the world right that's the Savior he said and some salt salt creates thirst right and when the Christian people who call themselves Christians will be so salty that the world would desire to be like you you'll make a contact then the reason your family can't follow you because you ain't become salty you ain't made contact yet they say have you seen Christians you say I just love to be like that woman now y'all know y'all don't see people like that in your life I just love to be like that woman I just love to be like that man if there ever was a Christian there he is see that's that salty it says you just be that you be that you be the salt God will create the thirst but you'd be salty and I don't have I know I've had Christians in my life that I said man I wanna I want I want my life to pattern like them I want to be like that some of y'all have parents that and that's that's the person in your life you mean I want that I want my life to pan out I'm gonna tell your parent has become that salty they've done exactly what God has asked them to do you know you know you got one of their mamas that's salty when you get in trouble ain't nobody to come but you know that if you get in touch with mama and if mom would begin the pre this thing I'm turning a little bit so you got some salty people in your life but the problem is is that you happy to let them be salty but but what God wants now he wants you to become salty you become one of the people that people have to call along a son can look up to his Danny a daughter can look up to his daddy huh you become salty the others could make contact there's this little quote and I'm gonna wind up here in let me see something here let me just see where I'm at oh my god I want to read this a couple more quotes I'm gonna go to the token next but there's a little statement please brother Peregrine was sharing the testimony I shared this with you all there are some ladies they they went to a meeting brother Brandon was preaching and in brother Branham preached and he just told him he told the pieces he started talking about all kind of stuff that the sisters was doing they should have been doing don't dress like this don't don't present yourself like this don't do that don't do this that's of the world that's not of God he just went right through it and the sisters got upset so they told me husband's after in between the service like you know they shouldn't let brother Brandon preach because you know he just come in he offend all the people he offend everybody he got that he got a bad spear he just offend everybody so the night that night for the random get up to any preaching during the middle of the sermon say don't think I didn't hear what you said you said I had a bad spirit and that they shouldn't let me preach and that I just offend everybody I'm offending people again that's what you're thinking don't do that and then he stopped and made it come and he says he says and here they were church-going folk but he said you know what you have gone as far with God as you are going to go until you get ready to pay a greater price they said you have gone as far with God as you are going to go and I want to tell you that maybe the reason your life is up and down in and out is because you have gone as far with God as you are going to go until you get ready to pay a greater price he already paid a price but now it's time for you to pay a greater price a price of sacrifice a price of giving it all up to God otherwise you'd never go further than where you are right now Sarita's messed this quote out of the token and a couple other quotes and we'll bring it home America this is your last hour judgement leaves in the balance yonder for this nation if God would let this nation get by with what is done now he would be obligated to raise up sodom and gomorrah and apologize for burning them up that's right we're going to pay for our sins we are doing the same thing they did in Sodom and God sent down message just exactly the way he did in Sodom just exactly he sent one to the church out there and the Lak group and to Sodom and he sent to the elect and so forth and proved it and the church is setting exactly in the condition it was in the days of lot Jesus said it would be again friends it's in your hands what are we gonna do with it say blood on your hands yes what do you think Oswald thought when he was sitting in that room the other day by taking the blood of his fellow man shooting the president and assassination and he was sitting there no he had to face the federal court when that Supreme Court will look on him with anger eyes knowing that on his hands was the blood of the President of the United States he was in a sweat box what ought it do to a man when you know you have trampled over the blood of Jesus Christ and refused to do it you're sitting in a sweat box not only will you be judged by a Supreme Court by an angry god that that can cast the body away and throw the soul into hell you stop look listen take heed we just trample over him easy and think he is so loving young fella said the other day God loves me so well God is a God is a good God that is true but he's a God of anger - he's a God of judgment he's a god of Wrath we fail to get that you make him so good - you make him some old daddy grandpa Dodie grandpa he says he's not that he's not no toady grandfather he is Almighty God and he don't have no grandchildren cuz you know that's it that's an important statement as you know as parents you'd be wanting to tap into that child but grandparents don't do that God ain't like that God is a parent not a grandparent right and if you've ever had the dynamic of the grandparent parent you know thing happening and your family do you know what that's like but sometime as a pair you have to stand up and tell the grandparent no no no no no look I'm gonna have to do what I need to do right cuz you did it to me and look how I turned out right grandparent just kind of pulled on back but after that child getting a little spanking they know where to run to they find a way to old grandma granddaddy lookin for some candy and somebody just rub them tears away him everybody got their place thank God for word but God ain't got got got him being like a grandparent God gonna always be like a parent he don't have no grandchildren he has sons and daughters of God not shook hands and adopted in you must be born again in the blood apply its sons and daughters got not some old soft grandfather let his kids get by grandchildren get by with anything he is not a grandfather he's a father yes sir every child must be born of him he's a father of Correction the Lord just put this in my heart while I was there and I want to tell you something just like in the Dead Sea when you if you just commit yourself to it you won't drown and if you could just commit yourself to the Lord Jesus Christ he won't harm you he won't harm you amen he will sustain you right I know he will Laurie to God but i but i but but i have to bring this to a point where amen you have to be the one to accept what he has done for you you ain't got to go back to the register and repay it's already paid and I'm telling you you paid it Jesus did so if you would just accept what he's done for you your life could be totally different no more up and down no more Anna now it can be consistent from this day forth if you're willing to settle it I gotta do something I gotta do something this is out of a message by loving-kindness this is brother branham just kind of making a statement he says while we're sitting in prayer in every heads bout I just wonder how many of you and all you Center friends would you just raise your hands to Christ and say be merciful to me God I raised my hands put up your hand will you do that lord bless you god bless you up in the balcony storm right up put up the hand up there sent a friend and say I now we resigned from sin I accept Christ I'm finished with saying I want to just ask the question is there anybody here today that want to say I'm resigning I'm quitting I'm quitting saying today this is it for me I'm driving my stake down I'm driving my stake down God sees these hands I want you to bow your heads God saw your hand God saw your hand what I'm settling this thing today everybody in this congregation there's a prayer that I want you to pray and amen the Prophet prayed this and I want you all this is out of the message door to the heart but don't worry about bringing up the coat I just want everybody to repeat after me Amen in this prayer the Prophet said if you're resigning today from sin I'm settling this thing I'm not going back out to do the things I used to do is over today I'm selling this so you don't know you don't know I mean you go to school and you don't know if that's gonna be your last day in school because somebody got a gun that they're coming up with some weapon of mass destruction you have no idea you can't go to Walmart you can't go to the ball game you can't go to you can't go do nothing because because of just just the world is full of violence you don't wanna be coped with things on sale the day is the day that you're selling this I want you to repeat this and and if your hands was lifted and you and you really mean it from all your heart say this to God out of your mouth today say Almighty God creative of heavens and earth author everlasting life the giver of every good gift I your servant confess my sins I promise to be your servant true and faithful from this day hence I now believe that we're living in the last days I believe that Jesus Christ has sent His angels to the earth and as he has and as he has and every Junction like in the days of nor like in the days of the delivering the children of Israel the Lord Jesus himself and in the last day I now confess all of my unbelief I believe that you clearly paid my debt for my sins for my sickness I accept you as my savior I accept you as my healer from this day on by God's help I am going to testify to the glory of God of my healing and my salvation I believe that the devil has no power over me anymore because of the grace of Christ that's here today give God praise for already being done believe it confess it begin to live in it believe it confess it begin to live in it you just settled that thing you can leave the rest of right now with no bird I believe that let's just read a script a few scriptures musicians can come give me matthew 26:26 i just want to read a few scriptures to you and just about your Lord and Savior he took care of this for you says as they were eating Jesus took bread blessed it and brake it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body this was communion and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the New Testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins let me tell you something when things have been settled you don't have to run from communion when things have been said or you can come to communion not only now I can you come to communion but Jax you look forward to come into communion can I tell you why because the first thing you're gonna do when you get to heaven is have communion so if you can't have communion here how do you expect to just have it over there if things have been settled you ought to make your way back first Peter 2:24 who his own self I'm talking about the man that paid your debt who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye were healed when you settled it you become dead to those old things that had you bound guess we're guess where we dropped them into the dance scene it's all been
