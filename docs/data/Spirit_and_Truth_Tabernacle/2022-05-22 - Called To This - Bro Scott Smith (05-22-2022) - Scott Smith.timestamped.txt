[45:51] just a couple of um things i just need
[45:54] to make mention of we we i did get a
[45:56] call a couple of our saints are
[46:00] having
[46:01] symptoms with covet and man we we won't
[46:03] clean covet
[46:05] but they are battling with the symptoms
[46:07] and we are believing god for complete
[46:09] and total healing
[46:11] amen
[46:12] for them this world we live in a man is
[46:16] uh
[46:17] is plagued
[46:18] with all kinds of diseases and all that
[46:21] and we all have to fight it all the time
[46:23] but
[46:24] we know that we're covered in a promise
[46:25] that he was wounded for our
[46:26] transgressions
[46:28] as bruised for our iniquities and the
[46:30] chastisement of our peace is upon him
[46:32] and with his stripes we are
[46:35] healed
[46:36] amen so praise the lord that's what we
[46:38] claim

[1:01:01] ask it all in the name of the lord jesus
[1:01:03] christ
[1:01:05] amen
[1:01:06] and amen first corinthians chapter one
[1:01:11] and verse 22 for the jews
[1:01:14] require a sign
[1:01:17] and the greeks seek after wisdom
[1:01:21] but we preach christ crucified
[1:01:25] unto the jews a stumbling block
[1:01:28] and unto the greeks foolishness
[1:01:31] but unto them which are called
[1:01:34] both jews and greeks
[1:01:36] christ the power of god in the wisdom of
[1:01:38] god
[1:01:40] because the foolishness of god is wiser
[1:01:43] than men
[1:01:44] and the weakness of god is stronger than
[1:01:47] men
[1:01:48] verse 26 and i want to look at these
[1:01:50] next couple of verses closely
[1:01:53] for you see your calling
[1:01:56] brethren
[1:01:57] how that not many wise men
[1:02:00] after the flesh
[1:02:01] not many noble
[1:02:04] are called right
[1:02:06] but god hath chosen the foolish
[1:02:09] things of the world to confound the wise
[1:02:12] and god hath chosen the weak things of
[1:02:14] the world to confound the things which
[1:02:16] are mighty
[1:02:18] and base things of the world and things
[1:02:20] which are despised hath god chosen
[1:02:23] yea in things which are not to bring to
[1:02:26] naught things that are
[1:02:28] that no flesh should glory in his
[1:02:30] presence
[1:02:31] but of him
[1:02:32] are ye in christ jesus
[1:02:36] who of god has made unto us wisdom
[1:02:40] and righteousness and sanctification
[1:02:43] and redemption
[1:02:45] it looks like he's just covered us all
[1:02:47] he's covered us with everything we
[1:02:49] everything we need
[1:02:51] amen i'm an insurance a i'm a pastor but
[1:02:53] i'm also an insurance agent one of the
[1:02:55] hardest things
[1:02:57] about my job is telling somebody they're
[1:02:59] not covered
[1:03:01] when something happens but i'm thankful
[1:03:03] we've got a god a word
[1:03:06] amen that whatever it is today it's
[1:03:09] covered
[1:03:10] amen that he would cover us with his
[1:03:12] wisdom and righteousness
[1:03:14] sanctification and redemption
[1:03:17] that according that is as it is written
[1:03:19] he that glorieth
[1:03:21] led him glory
[1:03:23] in the lord amen amen you can be seated
[1:03:27] i want to
[1:03:28] speak to you this morning out of that
[1:03:30] 26th verse and
[1:03:32] amen i want to speak to you on called
[1:03:36] to this all right
[1:03:39] all right called right to this
[1:03:41] [Music]
[1:03:43] can you say amen
[1:03:45] amen we realized this morning that
[1:03:48] amen there is a a call
[1:03:51] uh on our life amen
[1:03:53] uh it is it is as paul would call it it
[1:03:56] is a high calling
[1:03:58] amen so this is a heavenly calling that
[1:04:02] has been placed
[1:04:03] on our lives uh today amen that
[1:04:08] excuse me he would call it a high call
[1:04:10] and it is in another place in hebrews
[1:04:12] chapter three he would call it a
[1:04:15] heavenly calling amen and so we we
[1:04:18] realized that that both of those uh the
[1:04:21] high and the heavenly speaks of uh
[1:04:24] of an upward calling we are uh this is
[1:04:28] not a call of man
[1:04:30] uh in this hour as as we see how uh the
[1:04:33] bible would tell us how the jews would
[1:04:35] you know require a sign the greeks would
[1:04:37] seek after wisdom and you know when you
[1:04:40] you look at that i've said before i've
[1:04:41] heard it said that you know the romans
[1:04:43] you give them the gospel and they make a
[1:04:45] government out of it
[1:04:47] uh the greeks you give them the gospel
[1:04:49] and they make a philosophy out of it uh
[1:04:52] the europeans you give them the gospel
[1:04:54] and they make a culture out of it amen
[1:04:56] but if you give the word to the bride of
[1:04:58] jesus christ oh my and you get the word
[1:05:02] to them that are called amen it will
[1:05:05] perform what it is to perform it's it
[1:05:08] it's in the right hands can you say man
[1:05:11] and so amen so we we realized this
[1:05:14] morning that uh this is not our own
[1:05:16] choose and this is this is more than our
[1:05:18] own choose and this this is a call this
[1:05:21] is a this is a call of god on our lives
[1:05:24] it's more than uh it's more than just a
[1:05:27] uh something that we've been brought up
[1:05:30] in it's more than something that

[1:06:36] but according to his own purpose and
[1:06:39] grace which was given

[1:07:28] christ who hath blessed us
[1:07:31] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:07:33] places in christ
[1:07:35] according as he had chosen us in him
[1:07:38] before the foundation of the world that
[1:07:41] we should be holy and without blame
[1:07:44] before him in love
[1:07:46] having predestinated us unto the
[1:07:49] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[1:07:53] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:07:55] of his will
[1:07:57] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:08:00] wherein he hath made us accepted
[1:08:04] in the beloved amen we have been made
[1:08:07] accepted

[1:08:12] when you look at that and and that verb
[1:08:15] just accepted in the beloved that word
[1:08:18] accepted here used in this manner is is
[1:08:21] is only used one other place in the
[1:08:23] scripture amen and it's it's it's the
[1:08:26] scripture in luke now notice what he's
[1:08:29] saying here we have been made accepted
[1:08:31] which it actually means we are highly
[1:08:34] favored when you look at this in the
[1:08:36] greek it's actually we are highly
[1:08:39] favored
[1:08:40] of the lord amen this is only used one
[1:08:43] other time in in the in the holy
[1:08:45] scripture and it's where the angel came
[1:08:48] unto mary amen luke 1 28 the angel came
[1:08:51] into her and said hell
[1:08:53] thou art highly favored
[1:08:56] as the lord amen the lord is with thee
[1:08:59] blessed art thou among women amen so
[1:09:02] here he would tell mary amen that that
[1:09:05] carrier of that of that word in its in
[1:09:08] its infant state amen he would he would
[1:09:10] tell he would look and declare you are
[1:09:13] highly favored of the lord amen and now
[1:09:16] paul would speak amen to a bride amen
[1:09:19] over here in in the book of ephesians
[1:09:21] and again tell us that we have been made
[1:09:24] accepted amen or acceptable or highly
[1:09:28] favored of god amen
[1:09:30] oh my amen god has made this bride amen

[1:10:18] voice from heaven amen saying this is my
[1:10:21] beloved
[1:10:23] son
[1:10:24] in whom i am well pleased amen now think
[1:10:27] about that this is after jesus is
[1:10:29] baptized
[1:10:30] this is before any any of these works
[1:10:33] this is before any of these miracles

[1:10:37] anything amen to to uh
[1:10:40] to gain something if we could say it

[1:11:36] face with the call of god in your life
[1:11:42] we've been called what a
[1:11:44] what a privilege john would tell us in
[1:11:47] in first john chapter 3
[1:11:49] verse 1 he would tell us what manner he
[1:11:52] would say behold what manner of love
[1:11:55] the father hath bestowed upon us
[1:11:58] that we should be called
[1:12:00] the sons of god
[1:12:03] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:12:05] because it knew him not
[1:12:07] watch this verse 2 beloved now
[1:12:11] are we
[1:12:12] the sons of god
[1:12:14] now you think what's what what what's
[1:12:16] all the the talk about here john that
[1:12:18] you know
[1:12:19] how
[1:12:20] we're a son of god but when you think of
[1:12:22] that term when you think of that title
[1:12:26] and you think of how you know you know
[1:12:28] god
[1:12:29] god doesn't uh uh just uh
[1:12:32] he's very careful when he places
[1:12:34] titles can you say amen he's very god's
[1:12:37] not loose with his titles amen if god
[1:12:40] declares something as the son of god
[1:12:42] that's a son of god
[1:12:44] if god declare is that right god's not
[1:12:47] loose with those titles you think i mean
[1:12:49] you think like this you think how god
[1:12:51] who is the father who would want to pass
[1:12:54] that on down no doubt amen but think
[1:12:56] about this here here before he would
[1:12:58] ever share that title now here is adam
[1:13:00] you think the very first man the very
[1:13:03] first man to live you would think if
[1:13:05] god's ever going to share that title
[1:13:07] amen with with with a a with a with a
[1:13:10] who with a son of god or with a man it
[1:13:12] would be adam he's the fir we know eve
[1:13:14] was the mother of all living
[1:13:17] right but here is adam who god never
[1:13:20] would declare you are the father of many
[1:13:22] nations
[1:13:23] now he's oh come on
[1:13:25] think about this amen but he would
[1:13:27] declare abraham he would want to share
[1:13:30] that title he would want to give that
[1:13:32] title amen and he would pick it up over
[1:13:34] here abraham amen and call abraham and
[1:13:37] say now you are not you're not just
[1:13:39] abraham you are father abraham
[1:13:42] he could never put that on adam because
[1:13:44] of the fall amen because of what would
[1:13:47] take place and i'm talking i'm talking
[1:13:49] about that that that real name i know he
[1:13:51] was a father you understand what amen
[1:13:52] but before he would give that title
[1:13:54] brother jose amen he would wait and come
[1:13:57] over here and he would not call adam the
[1:13:59] father amen the father of our faith but
[1:14:01] he would call abraham the father of our
[1:14:03] faith and when you think of the sons of
[1:14:05] god now you find them over in genesis
[1:14:07] you find amen you find the bible
[1:14:10] speaking of
[1:14:11] of the sons of god and how they saw the
[1:14:13] daughters of men and amen and so forth
[1:14:16] over in genesis 6 and and and how god
[1:14:19] would acknowledge
[1:14:20] acknowledge them as the sons of god you
[1:14:23] find that job which is the oldest book
[1:14:25] in the bible it would speak of the sons
[1:14:27] of god presenting themselves coming and
[1:14:29] presenting themselves before the lord
[1:14:32] but you find
[1:14:33] after the fall you find that title if
[1:14:36] you've ever noticed this you find amen
[1:14:38] that name sons of god you don't you
[1:14:40] don't hear that anymore search the
[1:14:42] scripture i mean you don't see that
[1:14:44] being used throughout the old testament
[1:14:46] amen where people are actually being
[1:14:49] called the sons of god
[1:14:51] are you with me amen you don't you don't
[1:14:54] find that amen you you find amen you you
[1:14:56] find it there
[1:14:58] in genesis but then after that fall amen
[1:15:01] now we know god again he doesn't he
[1:15:03] doesn't just throw that that that
[1:15:04] language or that title out there amen we
[1:15:07] know that god calls adam luke luke three
[1:15:10] when he's given a genealogy calls adams
[1:15:12] the son of god
[1:15:14] we know mark calls jesus mark 1 1 the
[1:15:17] beginning of the gospel of jesus christ
[1:15:19] the son of god
[1:15:21] so he's called adam the son of god here
[1:15:24] he's called jesus christ the son of god
[1:15:27] amen but now amen there's a bright body
[1:15:31] amen that john is declaring now think
[1:15:33] about that what manner of love the
[1:15:36] father hath bestowed upon us that we can
[1:15:39] now be called sons of god again
[1:15:43] there was silence there was a gap for
[1:15:46] years to where men would not be
[1:15:48] acknowledged as sons of god but now john
[1:15:52] declares now behold what manner of love
[1:15:56] the father hath bestowed upon us that we
[1:15:59] would be called the sons of god
[1:16:03] oh hallelujah
[1:16:05] oh my i mean
[1:16:07] amen and so call us amen i believe john
[1:16:10] when he's in first john three and two
[1:16:12] amen beloved now

[1:16:16] was right oh now are we finally at
[1:16:19] disney

[1:16:24] declaring beloved now oh we finally made
[1:16:27] it amen we're back to the place that we
[1:16:29] can be called the sons of god with all
[1:16:32] the power and authority that comes with
[1:16:35] that name
[1:16:37] oh all the package that comes with that
[1:16:40] name

[1:16:59] you are called as a son and daughter of

[1:17:10] john 1 and 12 minutes received him
[1:17:13] to them
[1:17:15] gave you power to become the sons of god
[1:17:18] even to them
[1:17:20] that believe on his name
[1:17:22] amen which we which were born
[1:17:26] not a blood
[1:17:27] nor the will of flesh
[1:17:30] nor the will of man
[1:17:32] but of god
[1:17:34] amen these sons were begotten of god
[1:17:37] come on didn't come by flesh
[1:17:40] are you with me didn't come by the will
[1:17:42] of man amen but we are called amen we
[1:17:45] were we we were begotten of god
[1:17:48] amen now are we called are you with me
[1:17:50] amen we are the sons of god amen what a
[1:17:54] what a what an honor what a what a what
[1:17:56] a oh my what a what a title
[1:18:00] amen that that that he would place on us
[1:18:03] as as children of god
[1:18:06] oh i tell you there's a calling on our
[1:18:08] life
[1:18:10] all this is see this is more than just a
[1:18:13] just a scholarly understanding or a
[1:18:15] scholarly message that we have amen this
[1:18:18] is a revelation amen god amen this is a
[1:18:21] revelation of god amen god has so called
[1:18:24] us it's it's more than just a it's more
[1:18:27] than just learning our way to it amen
[1:18:29] we've been called to it hey man it's
[1:18:31] it's if somebody learned their way to it
[1:18:33] they might learn their way out of it
[1:18:35] amen but if you've ever been called to
[1:18:37] it
[1:18:38] oh come on amen if you've ever been
[1:18:40] called to there's a calling on your life
[1:18:43] amen i was looking over a malachi i mean
[1:18:46] you think of the gap between malachi and
[1:18:48] which is the last book of the old
[1:18:50] testament
[1:18:51] and matthew the first book of the new
[1:18:53] testament
[1:18:54] you you see you there were over 400
[1:18:56] years
[1:18:58] 400 years of of silence
[1:19:01] between the old testament and the new
[1:19:03] testament closing out in malachi
[1:19:06] amen and indeed and then of course the
[1:19:07] introduction of
[1:19:09] of jesus christ of the new testament
[1:19:11] matthew 1
[1:19:12] for over 400 years now you can think
[1:19:15] think with me just a minute because here
[1:19:17] here are are the believers we would call
[1:19:20] them of that time
[1:19:21] back in the days of the old testament
[1:19:23] and the last book
[1:19:25] that they are given
[1:19:27] the last prophetic utterance
[1:19:30] that would be penned would be the book
[1:19:33] of malachi
[1:19:34] now think about this because here the
[1:19:36] very last thing that they get
[1:19:39] amen is really the first thing they're
[1:19:41] going to need when they get over in
[1:19:43] matthew amen because who's coming
[1:19:45] elijah's coming
[1:19:47] amen and so the last thing amen that
[1:19:50] they're told in the book of malachi is
[1:19:52] what to be expecting in other words this
[1:19:55] is what we need to be teaching on the
[1:19:57] sabbath this is what we need to be
[1:19:59] keeping before the people amen can you
[1:20:01] imagine every sabbath them gathering the
[1:20:03] very last thing they have the very last
[1:20:06] bit of prophetic insight and instruction
[1:20:09] that they have is elijah is coming amen
[1:20:13] that for that one to come john the
[1:20:14] baptist in this case and that's the last
[1:20:17] thing that they are given can you can
[1:20:19] you imagine how fresh that probably was
[1:20:22] in one sense as they would gather the
[1:20:24] last thing we've got is to be looking
[1:20:27] amen there is an elijah the prophet
[1:20:30] coming before the lord comes right
[1:20:32] before the first coming of christ amen
[1:20:35] and so this is this is what this is what
[1:20:37] they have this is the material they have
[1:20:39] before no other prophetic utterance amen
[1:20:42] everything's quiet amen but watch this
[1:20:45] and you know that that was that we could
[1:20:47] say that would be a hot subject a hot
[1:20:50] topic in in the in the sabbath very
[1:20:53] often very regular this is the last
[1:20:55] thing amen brother jack the last thing
[1:20:58] they've been given amen the last thing
[1:21:00] amen so you know that this is this is
[1:21:03] fresh on their mind yet watch this amen
[1:21:06] when it actually come to pass and
[1:21:08] matthew opened up and john stormed on
[1:21:11] the scene elijah stormed on the scene
[1:21:14] all of those that sat there amen that
[1:21:16] were they should have been expecting it
[1:21:20] had heard it over and over and over
[1:21:23] 99
[1:21:25] of them did not even recognize that it
[1:21:27] was in their midst
[1:21:29] [Applause]
[1:21:31] but there were some that were called to
[1:21:33] it
[1:21:36] now think of amen there were some that
[1:21:38] were called to an axe i think acts
[1:21:40] speaks of this well acts chapter 13
[1:21:43] verse 26
[1:21:46] and 27 men and brethren
[1:21:49] children
[1:21:51] children of the stock of abraham
[1:21:56] whosoever among you feareth god
[1:21:59] to you
[1:22:00] is the word of this salvation sent
[1:22:03] verse 27 watch this
[1:22:04] [Music]
[1:22:06] for they that dwell at jerusalem
[1:22:09] and their rulers
[1:22:11] because they knew him not
[1:22:14] nor yet the voices of the prophets which
[1:22:17] are read every sabbath day
[1:22:20] they have fulfilled them in condemning
[1:22:23] him now here they are they're hearing
[1:22:26] the vote they're hearing they're hearing
[1:22:27] these prophets every sabbath day
[1:22:30] yet they never hear the voice
[1:22:32] they never hear the voices of those
[1:22:34] prophets and therefore when the things
[1:22:37] begin to take place amen they sit there
[1:22:40] with no reluction amen come on amen with
[1:22:43] no no real insight or no real
[1:22:45] recognition of what has taken place amen
[1:22:48] but there's another group of people amen
[1:22:51] that are absolutely called to the truth
[1:22:55] they are called to the word i i told the
[1:22:58] church i said it this way i said now
[1:23:00] they had 400 years 400 years between
[1:23:04] amen between malachi and matthew amen to
[1:23:07] look at it to ponder it i said and the
[1:23:10] majority of them could never believe it
[1:23:12] i said but here we are amen some 2500
[1:23:16] years later after malachi
[1:23:19] amen and because there's a call on our
[1:23:22] life amen
[1:23:23] oh help me somebody amen because there's
[1:23:26] a call on our life amen when we hear
[1:23:29] that elijah must first come there's
[1:23:32] something in us amen that's brought us
[1:23:34] and called us to the truth
[1:23:36] [Applause]
[1:23:43] what does that
[1:23:45] only god can do that
[1:23:49] that it would be blind that the the rest
[1:23:51] of the world would be blind to it but
[1:23:53] there would be something that would that
[1:23:54] would so attract you
[1:23:56] to the word do you know what it is
[1:23:59] there's a calling on your life amen you
[1:24:01] can't get away from it there is a
[1:24:03] calling on your life amen god has called
[1:24:07] you to the word amen you are called for
[1:24:10] this word
[1:24:13] you didn't just stumble into this thing
[1:24:16] and then the message is not something
[1:24:18] you just come across it's something
[1:24:20] you've been called to
[1:24:24] [Applause]
[1:24:26] god has called you

[1:26:44] final this this bright body does have
[1:26:47] something to be about
[1:26:49] come on amen listen
[1:26:52] we are that final voice amen we are the
[1:26:55] last part amen of that anointing amen
[1:26:57] that is to come and to hit the body
[1:27:01] come on
[1:27:02] amen david spoke about this over and
[1:27:04] over in psalms and and with the
[1:27:06] anointing of aaron and he would talk
[1:27:08] about he would say it this way in psalms
[1:27:10] 133
[1:27:12] he said behold
[1:27:13] how good
[1:27:15] and how pleasant it is for brethren to
[1:27:18] dwell together in unity
[1:27:20] you know how important that is
[1:27:23] all that's important
[1:27:25] watch how important it is what's the
[1:27:26] comparison he gives in verse two
[1:27:30] you you talking about that unity you
[1:27:32] talking about it bringing forth a real
[1:27:34] power in our lives
[1:27:36] watch verse 2 it is like
[1:27:39] the precious ointment
[1:27:42] upon the head
[1:27:43] that ran down upon the beard
[1:27:46] even aaron's beard
[1:27:48] that went down to the skirts
[1:27:52] of his garments
[1:27:54] now notice that that that comparison i
[1:27:56] like this amen when you follow amen the
[1:27:59] order of the anointing here amen it
[1:28:02] started at the head
[1:28:06] but it didn't stay at the head
[1:28:09] somebody helped me
[1:28:10] i said it started at the head
[1:28:13] amen but a real anointing doesn't stay
[1:28:15] at the head
[1:28:16] amen this bright oh my amen it started
[1:28:19] at the head but it worked its way on
[1:28:22] down
[1:28:23] [Applause]
[1:28:24] it worked its way on down to the beard
[1:28:27] or even to the mouth of the prophet
[1:28:31] come on
[1:28:33] come on i believe i believe aaron was
[1:28:35] the mouthpiece
[1:28:37] is that what he said
[1:28:38] amen he said he is the man let's just
[1:28:40] read it he said he said that
[1:28:43] that if exodus 4 amen uh that uh exodus
[1:28:48] 4 that that he would aaron was the
[1:28:50] spokesman or called the mouth
[1:28:53] of moses brother branham an unveiling of
[1:28:56] god said it this way he said why he told
[1:28:58] even told moses himself you'll be god
[1:29:02] and aaron will be your prophet
[1:29:05] right now think about this because and
[1:29:08] and don't forget the unity part because
[1:29:10] it's being typed here
[1:29:11] amen and it and and it would say amen
[1:29:14] that that ointment how it would how it
[1:29:16] would come down upon the head it ran
[1:29:19] down upon the beard i mean it covered
[1:29:22] the mouth
[1:29:23] amen the prophet amen so the anointing
[1:29:25] started at the head
[1:29:27] it come down and to the mouth of the
[1:29:30] prophet
[1:29:31] but like some would want to stop it
[1:29:33] right there
[1:29:34] see you
[1:29:35] you got you got three kinds of believers
[1:29:38] in this thing
[1:29:39] what one type want to stop it at the
[1:29:41] head oh just just just the lord it's
[1:29:43] just the lord i don't want to hear no
[1:29:45] more amen but that anointing goes
[1:29:46] further than that amen it drops down to
[1:29:49] a prophet's anointing amen through the
[1:29:52] mouth of a prophet
[1:29:54] now there's another group that would
[1:29:56] want to leave it right there
[1:29:58] there's another group that would say
[1:29:59] well you don't got to go no further we
[1:30:01] don't need to hear anybody we don't need
[1:30:02] to hear preachers we don't need to oh no
[1:30:05] that's contrary to the anointing
[1:30:08] this anointing that i'm talking about
[1:30:11] did not stop with the head it did not
[1:30:14] stop with the mouth oh but it flowed all
[1:30:17] the way down covering the skirts of the
[1:30:20] garment in other words it hit the body
[1:30:24] the anointing covered the body
[1:30:27] it completely covered the body
[1:30:36] or if i can even if i can even type it
[1:30:38] like this that skirt's a feminine
[1:30:40] garment it hit the bride of jesus christ
[1:30:44] it hit the bright body
[1:30:46] oh glory oh my this anointing amen that
[1:30:49] you have received has not come from man
[1:30:54] [Applause]
[1:30:55] [Music]
[1:30:58] amen
[1:30:59] this anointing started at the head
[1:31:03] come on somebody
[1:31:06] it started at the head
[1:31:10] and it worked its way down
[1:31:14] all through the mouth of a prophet
[1:31:16] all but it didn't stop there
[1:31:19] oh i like it even aaron's beard and then
[1:31:22] i like this that colon comes in and that
[1:31:25] went down to the skirts
[1:31:28] of his garments
[1:31:32] so follow that
[1:31:35] hitting the body
[1:31:36] come on
[1:31:37] it's hitting the body
[1:31:39] amen
[1:31:40] watching the message why
[1:31:43] amen brother branham will talk about the
[1:31:44] dove

[1:31:53] you've seen the dove soap and the dove
[1:31:55] oils and
[1:31:57] all of that there's a reason for that
[1:31:59] you know that dove brother brown was
[1:32:01] talking about the dove and he said he
[1:32:03] said anytime
[1:32:04] anytime he works his body
[1:32:07] that dove works his body it produces an
[1:32:11] oil
[1:32:12] come on
[1:32:14] oh i'm thinking about the body when that
[1:32:17] body really comes together amen every
[1:32:19] part working and performing nothing to

[1:33:06] lamp was driven by the oil the oil of
[1:33:08] olive that would keep that burning amen
[1:33:11] and remember whose responsibility it was
[1:33:14] to bring that all into the house of god
[1:33:17] it wasn't eli's eli was there and once
[1:33:20] it come he had his responsibility but
[1:33:23] the responsibility was on the general
[1:33:26] people

[1:33:30] beaten oil olive to the temple to be
[1:33:34] burned

[1:34:09] he said brother man said when that dove
[1:34:11] works
[1:34:13] he says his body produces it
[1:34:16] if he just sits still
[1:34:19] and he's never active
[1:34:22] and he never makes
[1:34:24] midweek service
[1:34:26] [Music]

[1:35:01] colons in this body even god has so
[1:35:05] ordained it that way
[1:35:07] that a body would function
[1:35:11] it's not about a big preacher it's about
[1:35:14] a big body
[1:35:16] it's about a body that's unified
[1:35:19] it's about a body that is collectively
[1:35:22] come together
[1:35:27] [Music]
[1:35:30] it's about not making somebody popular
[1:35:34] it's about a body
[1:35:41] oh it's hit the body
[1:35:43] are you with me
[1:35:45] oh i'm telling you
[1:35:47] amen thank god for the call on your life
[1:35:50] not many wives not many noble
[1:35:53] amen
[1:35:55] are called to see this
[1:35:57] amen but you
[1:35:59] oh you're highly favored of the lord
[1:36:03] i was looking
[1:36:06] i was thinking studying a while back and
[1:36:09] looking at at the day of pentecost and
[1:36:12] studying in acts and
[1:36:16] and
[1:36:17] i come across something i just i went
[1:36:19] back to it had on my mind
[1:36:22] just one day the entire whole day
[1:36:24] brother jack you know how that can be
[1:36:25] sometimes something something striking
[1:36:28] and
[1:36:29] you you just
[1:36:31] you know then it just grabs your
[1:36:32] attention
[1:36:35] and
[1:36:35] so i couldn't get off of it and i just
[1:36:37] started looking at it
[1:36:38] and and over in you know when you when
[1:36:41] you think of pentecost and and we know
[1:36:44] according to scripture there was about
[1:36:45] 120
[1:36:46] that gathered in that upper room
[1:36:49] and so you look at that and you think
[1:36:52] uh what a what a time that was but you
[1:36:55] know paul he makes a statement over in
[1:36:57] first corinthians i just i just want to
[1:37:00] read that if i can first corinthians 15.
[1:37:13] he tells us we you turn there i can tell
[1:37:16] you the the the
[1:37:18] yeah 15-6 and it's talking about after
[1:37:22] the resurrection after jesus was
[1:37:24] resurrected we realized that from his
[1:37:26] time of resurrection to the to pentecost
[1:37:29] was 50 days
[1:37:31] and so he resurrected he walked the
[1:37:33] earth for uh and was seen for about 40
[1:37:36] days right
[1:37:37] and so then 10 days
[1:37:40] after that of course pentecost 50. and
[1:37:42] so when you think of that time and you
[1:37:44] think of
[1:37:45] of
[1:37:47] what took place well in first
[1:37:49] corinthians paul he would cover this
[1:37:51] none of that none of the other gospels
[1:37:53] are are this clear on a number but paul
[1:37:56] is and in first corinthians 15 he would
[1:37:58] tell us that after he was buried
[1:38:02] and that he rose again the third day
[1:38:04] according to the scriptures
[1:38:06] and that he was seen of cephas then of
[1:38:08] the twelve
[1:38:09] and verse six after that he was seen of
[1:38:11] above
[1:38:13] 500.
[1:38:15] at once
[1:38:17] notice that amen he's seen of he's seen
[1:38:20] of them and then he's seen of of above
[1:38:23] 500 of once
[1:38:25] paul would tell us of whom the greater
[1:38:26] part remain unto this present but some
[1:38:30] are falling asleep so here here paul he
[1:38:33] would tell us a number that had
[1:38:35] witnessed now this was no like thing
[1:38:38] this was the resurrection of our lord
[1:38:41] there were many people that this was
[1:38:42] hidden from all the way around amen he
[1:38:45] didn't show himself to everybody is that
[1:38:48] right amen when he walked the earth
[1:38:49] those 40 days he appeared to he appeared
[1:38:52] to some
[1:38:53] he didn't appear at all
[1:38:55] right amen paul's actually putting a
[1:38:57] number on it here and tells us well he
[1:38:59] appeared at a 500 at once
[1:39:02] are you following me so here he is he
[1:39:04] this is no like thing if you've been
[1:39:06] called if you've been you know
[1:39:08] if you've at least
[1:39:11] you know heard this
[1:39:12] i mean you're one of the you're one of
[1:39:14] the a few
[1:39:16] are you with me
[1:39:17] 500 that that had had witnessed this but
[1:39:20] but i got i got to look at this and and
[1:39:23] i thought maybe it's elementary to some
[1:39:25] but i thought now where was that other
[1:39:26] 380
[1:39:29] all right
[1:39:31] in the upper room
[1:39:33] right because we got 120 there
[1:39:37] we've got
[1:39:38] 500 remember
[1:39:41] 500 that have witnessed this now jesus
[1:39:44] in luke 24 he would he would is where he
[1:39:47] would tell the he would tell the
[1:39:48] disciples remember to go terry in
[1:39:51] jerusalem
[1:39:53] now they're not gonna have to tarry long
[1:39:55] pentecost is coming he's risen 40 days
[1:39:58] he's walked he tells them go amen just
[1:40:00] go terry it's going you know they may
[1:40:02] have not known how long it was going to
[1:40:04] be but in reality it wasn't that long
[1:40:06] even the whole time from his
[1:40:08] his resurrection to pentecost 50 days
[1:40:11] right
[1:40:12] now here he is they have witnessed 500
[1:40:16] have witnessed this
[1:40:18] and been told if you read if you read
[1:40:20] luke's account over in luke 24 he
[1:40:22] doesn't put a number on it but luke 24
[1:40:24] and 33 i believe it would it would say
[1:40:27] it it would tell it the story or i know
[1:40:29] it does how how when when he was talking
[1:40:32] to him there amen it was it was the 11
[1:40:35] and those
[1:40:37] those that were with them yeah luke luke
[1:40:41] so it doesn't put a number on it look
[1:40:43] luke 11.
[1:40:45] just stay with me just a few minutes
[1:40:46] here
[1:40:52] i'm sorry luke 24
[1:40:54] luke 24
[1:41:09] 33 and they rose up the same hour and
[1:41:11] returned to jerusalem and found the 11
[1:41:13] gathered together and them that were
[1:41:16] with them so we don't know how many was
[1:41:19] with them
[1:41:20] but we know there's a number of them
[1:41:22] right
[1:41:23] all of them 11 no doubt had probably
[1:41:25] gained gain their own little
[1:41:27] their little groups and followings and
[1:41:29] so there's a number here present amen
[1:41:31] paul would tell us it it can't it it it
[1:41:34] blows the mind of many of the different
[1:41:36] writers and and and and commentaries and
[1:41:39] different ones because they're like you
[1:41:40] know the gospels didn't put that 500
[1:41:42] number on them but paul a prophet would
[1:41:45] declare to us amen that over 500 saw him
[1:41:49] now we could we could take that here's
[1:41:50] the 11 and all them that were with them
[1:41:53] now jesus would in verse 49 would give
[1:41:56] the message amen behold i send the
[1:41:58] promise of the father upon you but tarry
[1:42:01] ye in the city of jerusalem until you be
[1:42:03] endued with power from on high amen so
[1:42:05] we then we find amen that it's in the
[1:42:08] upper room that we've got a number of
[1:42:10] only 120
[1:42:12] and so you say where i don't know this
[1:42:14] is the way i think but where is that
[1:42:16] other 380.
[1:42:18] now when you think about it because this
[1:42:20] was a most religious time
[1:42:23] in israel at that time it was the feast
[1:42:26] of weeks which is you know of course
[1:42:27] pentecost now so people people had
[1:42:30] gathered those jews had gathered from
[1:42:33] all over had come amen to to the the
[1:42:37] area amen to celebrate this they had
[1:42:40] there was all kind it was a time of
[1:42:42] rededication rededicating their life
[1:42:44] there was services going on amen but
[1:42:47] listen i think about this there was a
[1:42:49] lot going on amen but there was one
[1:42:52] place that god was really meeting
[1:42:56] there was a lot of
[1:42:58] religious ceremonies gathering in the
[1:43:01] name of the lord
[1:43:03] but there was a called group
[1:43:06] up in the upper room
[1:43:09] amen that god truly came to
[1:43:12] amen so here he is amen now you say
[1:43:15] where's those other ones listen there
[1:43:16] was a there was a there was a lot going
[1:43:19] on amen there was a lot of festivities
[1:43:21] going on there was a lot of there there
[1:43:23] us we could say services there was a lot
[1:43:25] of people no doubt that gets caught up
[1:43:28] in the religious thing even just going

[1:45:24] to my heart and said tell them they are
[1:45:27] called to this
[1:45:31] i tell you what you know what
[1:45:35] the the hard pressure of preaching is
[1:45:37] lifted when that come to me because i
[1:45:39] knew that was what the lord would have
[1:45:41] said
[1:45:42] the whole
[1:45:44] oh brother jack
[1:45:47] [Music]
[1:45:49] called
[1:45:50] to this
[1:45:54] i say it like jesus said it as the
[1:45:58] pharisees tried to stumble him on with
[1:46:00] john and they began to ask him you know
[1:46:02] questions and jesus said well i'll ask
[1:46:04] you a question
[1:46:06] he said the baptism of john
[1:46:10] was it from men
[1:46:12] or was it from heaven
[1:46:15] can you say amen
[1:46:18] and he would ask that question and of
[1:46:20] course they couldn't answer it they you
[1:46:22] know because they they're where a lot of
[1:46:24] people are
[1:46:25] they knew you know they looked and they
[1:46:28] said well
[1:46:29] if we
[1:46:30] if we say it's of heaven
[1:46:34] then he's gonna he's gonna ask us
[1:46:36] why we're not following it
[1:46:39] there's going to be some accountability
[1:46:42] if we admit that it's the lord
[1:46:45] hello there's a sense of responsibility
[1:46:48] then there's a sense of accountability
[1:46:50] but but if we if we say it's of man well
[1:46:52] there's people that esteem john a
[1:46:54] prophet
[1:46:56] and we'll be stoned
[1:46:58] and so they stayed right in the middle
[1:47:02] they stayed they really wasn't neutral
[1:47:04] but they stayed neutral come on
[1:47:06] they stayed right there in the middle
[1:47:08] but i say amen listen to us amen that
[1:47:12] have recognized and this is a heavenly
[1:47:14] calling this is not from man amen man
[1:47:18] didn't call me come on man can't hold me
[1:47:22] amen this is the most heavenly calling
[1:47:25] this is from heaven amen why not put our
[1:47:29] shoulder completely behind it

[1:58:28] we heard
[1:58:28] [Music]
[1:58:29] [Applause]
[1:58:31] from
[1:58:32] god um
[1:58:35] brother brother scott like i told you
[1:58:37] just drove in
[1:58:39] i want to say maybe um he drove in
[1:58:41] yesterday and it was just uh maybe a
[1:58:44] month ago that he told me that he was
[1:58:45] going to be coming here to florida and
[1:58:48] when he when he
[1:58:49] when he said he was coming
[1:58:51] i said uh because last time he preached
[1:58:52] for us on a wednesday night and when he
[1:58:54] came the last time and just did a
[1:58:56] wonderful job but i said brother you
[1:58:58] you're gonna be
[1:58:59] nearby are you gonna be here on a sunday
[1:59:02] this time
[1:59:03] and i say i can probably come on the
[1:59:05] 22nd
[1:59:07] i say well brother let's pencil it in
[1:59:09] and let's have you come on the 22nd
[1:59:12] and and when god orchestrated for
[1:59:15] brother scott to be here on the 22nd god
[1:59:18] also knew who else
[1:59:20] was going to be here
[1:59:21] on the 22nd
[1:59:23] and before i mean sometimes we think
[1:59:25] things just happen by accident or by
[1:59:27] chance but when you talk about god
[1:59:30] nothing happens by chance nothing
[1:59:33] happens by accident
[1:59:36] nah
[1:59:37] you talking about god
[1:59:39] [Music]
[1:59:40] and i'm just sitting here listening to
[1:59:42] the brother and you know just so many
[1:59:45] details and
[1:59:46] and you know as a as a pastor amen i can
[1:59:50] hear the things that god is speaking
[1:59:52] and
[1:59:53] my prayers are always lord don't let
[1:59:54] them miss it lord don't let them miss it
[1:59:56] lord let them catch that lord let them
[1:59:58] catch that because this is coming direct
[2:00:00] from god
[2:00:01] this is a tremendous calling that's upon
[2:00:03] your life as the brother was just kind
[2:00:05] of sharing when you when you're dealing
[2:00:07] with a calling from god just as a
[2:00:08] minister i can tell you from my own
[2:00:10] personal experience when you deal with a
[2:00:13] call from god god don't deal with
[2:00:15] everybody
[2:00:18] god don't speak to everybody
[2:00:20] so when god speaks to you
[2:00:23] when god is calling you
[2:00:25] then he wants you to respond sometimes
[2:00:28] we're waiting on everybody else to
[2:00:29] respond but god ain't talking to them
[2:00:31] god is actually talking to you
[2:00:36] and when it comes down in love and
[2:00:37] speaks to you you have to respond
[2:00:41] [Music]
[2:00:43] i hope we'll hear the voice of the lord
[2:00:47] i'm called to this
[2:00:49] amen i'm called to this
[2:00:52] this is this is this is this i'm calling
[2:00:54] to this message i'm calling to this word
[2:00:57] i'm called to this church
[2:00:58] i'm called i'm called i'm calling them
[2:01:00] god i'm called to this
[2:01:04] i tell you the truth brother scott god
[2:01:07] bless you thank you so much for getting
[2:01:08] yourself out of the way and
[2:01:10] just allowing the lord to to use you to
[2:01:13] speak to us
[2:01:14] [Music]
[2:01:17] i'm blessed i'm leaving here in courage
[2:01:19] i'm leaving here
[2:01:21] the word of god i'm leaving here changed
[2:01:24] amen amen amen amen
[2:01:28] let's have a word of prayer
[2:01:31] father
[2:01:32] your word has been spoken
[2:01:36] your servant has yielded
[2:01:40] god and allowed you to
[2:01:42] utter words from heaven
[2:01:45] god you you've expressed your love to
[2:01:48] each and every one of us
[2:01:50] telling us lord how you have called us
[2:01:52] and
[2:01:53] maybe we didn't understand why we were
[2:01:55] under some of the things we were under
[2:01:56] the pressures and things that we were
[2:01:58] feeling all that is a part of the
[2:02:00] calling all that's a part of the process
[2:02:05] lord how we just must remain faithful
[2:02:07] not just thinking back in the sermon how
[2:02:09] he shared 400 years of silence
[2:02:13] 400 years of nothing but the only thing
[2:02:16] that people had is the last utterance
[2:02:20] of a prophet in the book of malachi that
[2:02:23] they would hold to that utterance and
[2:02:25] say elijah's coming elijah's coming
[2:02:28] elijah's coming and when john the
[2:02:30] baptist shows up many did not recognize
[2:02:33] who he was even the disciples
[2:02:36] didn't catch it
[2:02:38] until jesus revealed it to him that oh
[2:02:41] if you could receive it it was it's
[2:02:44] the scriptures was written and the
[2:02:45] things was already fulfilled if you can
[2:02:47] receive it it's already happening then
[2:02:49] they understood it was john the baptist
[2:02:51] [Music]
[2:02:54] god i pray that you'd help us to catch
[2:02:56] what you're saying and what you're doing
[2:02:57] in this hour for here we are at the end
[2:02:59] time again and another elijah's coming
[2:03:01] elijah's coming actually elijah's coming
[2:03:04] already gone just what jesus spoke to
[2:03:07] the disciples he's coming already gone
[2:03:11] help us to catch it
[2:03:14] lord this is not a joke
[2:03:17] we've been called to something special
[2:03:20] how many churches have gathered today
[2:03:22] just as it was in that time lord where
[2:03:24] amen uh lord during the time of
[2:03:26] pentecost and lord just so many things
[2:03:28] happening father how many churches were
[2:03:31] gathered how many people having services
[2:03:33] but but failing to realize what was
[2:03:35] really going on

[2:03:39] spiritual this hour
[2:03:42] we want to catch and we want to hear
[2:03:44] what the voice of god is speaking
[2:03:46] and we want to respond father

[2:03:52] but lord it's certainly worth it
[2:03:54] and got my prayers that amen you would
[2:03:57] just help us father to hear your voice
[2:03:59] even as we leave and as we're
