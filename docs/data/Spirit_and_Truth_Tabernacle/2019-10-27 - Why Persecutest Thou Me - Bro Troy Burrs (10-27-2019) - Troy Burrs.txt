verse and then I'll let you have your seats and we'll just go from there Amen it's so good to see the Saints a man we bring you greetings from Tennessee Happy Valley we're a couple of Sundays ago we were there with brother Donnie Reagan and the meetings there and brother Fred mother's day in Florence South Carolina we just had a wonderful time kind of took some time needed the cabins up in the mountains there the Smoky Mountains I tell you what you look at all these manicured trees and lawns right nothing like God's country ain't nothing like God country I mean I don't care how pretty they try to make it they got nothing oh my god I'm talking about just beautiful I'm updating the clouds all I could do is raise my hands just say thank you Lord amen it just put me in mind about a glory land how beautiful it's gonna be amen we just have no idea my brothers and sisters say man Acts chapter 9 and it reads on this wise in salt yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord went into the high priest and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogue's that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shined around about him a light from heaven and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying Saul Saul why persecutest me and he said unto thy Lord maybe said him and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecute it is hard for thee to kick against a pre and he trembling and astonished said Lord what was our help me to do and the Lord said o unto Him arise and go onto the city and it shall be told of the what we must do let us borrow his most gracious Heavenly Father we thank you Lord God for this opportunity Lord God to be gathered here once again Oh father God and Lord we come reporting for duty Oh Lord we just ask you a father God to take complete control look I'll be buying the hand of

God in Jesus precious name I pray amen amen you may be seated a man little chance here to get myself all kind of prepared amen try not to be before you're too long amen and reading from a mem I have to take my coat off you can't fight with your coat on and I feel a fight amen look at that the scripture here amen we see amen in those days there read from the scripture there an accident the the message of Jesus it wasn't a popular message hey man this was a little while after the crucifixion and the Jews had already committed him over to capital punishment and things like that but there was a group that had caught the message and they was beginning to just carry the gospel and things that begin the game momentum and we see here that the Hebrews and the establishment of that day they had a problem with it so you would think that in those days Jesus when he was thinking of this unpopular person who was uneducated by the world no school they couldn't find what school or what seminary where did he come from he didn't have any doctorate degree and he wasn't affiliated with any of their denomination she wasn't affiliated with any of their their teachings and things they they just couldn't understand it and he say raise up something they date they knew his background and said that well he was a little illegitimate births and he come out preaching the gospel contrary to everything that was taught at that time amen and so condemning all the ministers and their organizations and so forth amen it just didn't sit well with them and if anybody even went to hear him this so-called prophet would be put out of the synagogue which was a mortal sin and that's kind of just like the day you know what I mean they Oh what is this bangle what are they talking about Amen that God sent a prophet and these thunders and these seals and all these different things so they begin to just like they're just like today ridicule and and scarf and say all kind of things against the Lord thank God and they come true to this sacrifice and and and they understood this outcast with great things amen and this man Christ Jesus ignored such as that and yet he was perfectly with description now I want to slow down and I want to make sure that you get that even though they felt this way about him they had all these notions and feelings and different things about him but this man Christ Jesus was perfectly with Scripture but they could not recognize it because he didn't come in the way that they wanted him to come he didn't come through their schools he didn't come through their synagogues he didn't come the way they expected him to come amen now what side my brothers and sisters let me let me back up we see brother Brennan brought out a little story at one time when he was a kid amen to how he was talking about this little boy and he went over to his grown my house and and and and and in he said at this house they never really had mirrors in the house and they had one mirror that day outside there was a little small thing that he said I believe he said he found it in the trash from when they tagged it up on on a tree and and and the kids would I've actually stand up on the bucket and kind of trip it so just to be able to see their face but he went over to his grandmother's house one time and she had a full-length mirror on the door and and and he began to look into this mirror and he see this little boy looking back and he looked and he would turn his head one way and the little boy in the mirror would do the same thing and he would make a move and then he looked back at his mom and grandma day looking at him to see what she's going to do about it and and he he finally caught the revelation they say mama that's me and I will pass the kind of preach the real good message Oh neck up in Carolina said mama that's me but I want to take him in a different direction we see that these are religious establishment house how they didn't recognize what was going on they didn't recognize the gospel for the hour that they was living in they couldn't see it and and what side I wonder I wonder what side if we were back in that time if we were back in that day what side when we have took he says your life you live now reflects now just what side you would have took it reflects just what you would have done because you're still are possessed of the same spirit they say the spirits don't die he said those people died made them but those spirits live right on he say your life right now is reflecting what side you would have been on me so the devil never takes the spirit it just goes off from one man to another and God never takes his spirit it just goes from one to another so the very spirit of Elijah came upon a life show the same one adjourn of the same one on John the Baptist and so forth the Holy Spirit came upon Christ and then upon the disciples and all down is still upon two people today see God never takes his spirit so we are left to make a choice what choice what choice we make now the same Trust we would have made then we're just looking at a reflection amen and if you want to see a manual reflection the word of man is a reflection of what choice you would have made are you learning up with the word today it is just a side whichever way the tree leaned it is the way it falls but trouble wait a tree leaning amen now I want us to go and look at the scripture here if we take our bibles or put up to Genesis the third you can either follow in your Bibles or follow along on the screen amen we're gonna go to Genesis there's a third chapter a man if you just bear with me while I build its platform amen I believe we're going to see some see some things this morning amen glory to God I glow over the guy we'll take from the third chapter the first verse amen now the serpent was the most subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord that God had made and he said unto the woman yea hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree in the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said ye shall ye not you shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it you shall not eat it neither shall ye touch it he don't even want you to go over there and sit under that tree don't go over there playing around the tree no go over the climbing the tree stay away from that tree but we find the day and I'm gonna believe that scriptures have compound meaning a man about a and we look at Genesis here oh it's in silver form we're not talking about a literal tree we're not talking about a literal tree amen but he said you not only do you not eat the fruit don't even touch it stay the problem with Eve is that since she had she had somebody that she was supposed to be listening to now she um with her amen to be able to rightly divide the word of truth that would have been one thing but she all know that distri having Bible study confident that she's able to withstand whatever oh this man can throw it but she didn't realize so she were dealing with this old Greece and fellow was sleep and he took her all the way through the scripture and change one word and she was deceived she was trace but he told her don't even go over there don't even touch it don't sing in the choir don't be only that would make soup samples don't be gone today programs stay away from me it's dangerous amen glory to God amen thank you lord so he said he said I'll stay away from that tree and we read on down here that uh the woman isn't serving at all we may eat a tree in the field but in the troop the tree in the midst of the garden has he said don't eat ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die now I want you to brother bring out one thing at this time what he leased you down before them God had created the heaven created the earth all of the trees all of these all of these different things and the Prophet brought out that they was at this time they were still in eternity he said unless you die so the clock didn't start ticking until they transgressed now I want you to bring that up until they transgress then death set into the body amen the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die see how he's the life God said list you doc he said ye shall not surely die he's trying to interpret scripture amen so for God to his know that the day that you eat thereof see listen that what he said then your eyes shall be open that was not a lie that was not a lot that was very true see he give you look truth next with a laugh and it told you off the whole program of God say stay away from over there any man so we read on it he says here your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as God's knowing good and evil you always have somebody telling you something and you say I wish you hadn't told me that I didn't I really didn't want to know I was better off not knowing and now I got to deal with this now I got to carry you see and off not knowing my brothers I didn't know everything just believe the word and go on amen you see somebody it's best you not know good pray leave it alone it's best you not know cuz everybody can't handle everything amen and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did he and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they would make oh my so they show our fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard a voice of the Lord walking in the garden in the cool of the day and usually Adam would meet the Lord there at that place it meant because they had fellowship in the cool of the evening but this time where were you Adam he had to call out for Adam and away you where right now and when Adam Beauty leaves put on them I imagine maybe later after they had ate the fruit he might've did and I don't matter they realized that they had done something wrong you see when they was in that garden and that everything was perfect it was a perfect atmosphere it was a you had had everything they had needles there were no stress now we see that after the transgression all of a sudden they started feeling things like that never felt before obviously self fear they felt pressure one of the most damaging things to the human body is fear and precious it'll age you quicker than anything fear and pressure death has said into the body they had began to feel feelings like that never felt before what is this what have we done oh my what have we done sort of God came and said what does his leave who told you you was naked he already knew at that point what hadn't happened they began to play the blame game and he heard the voice and the Lord walking in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife saw and the cool walking in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord oh my isn't that something why would you hide yourself from the presence of the law but you know probably Saturday night just like us a day we do something wrong and the first thing we do they stop coming to church doing the same thing we hide our self from the presence of the Lord amen and uh amongst the trees of the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto Him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid see I was a free you ain't never feared before all of a sudden now you're feeling fear I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told me that God was naked have you eaten of the tree where for I commanded thee that thou should not eat and the man said the woman that thou gave us me to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this what is this doll have done and the woman said to me she said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat I told you not to even touch it oh my but the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou art cursed above all cattle and every beast of the feeling upon thy belly thou shalt go and the dust shall be the dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life amen and I will put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed and not your bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel and we're gonna go back to that we're gonna get in there a little bit deeper a little bit but I want you to we're gonna go on to the 16th unto the woman he said he will greatly multiply thy sorrow and in that conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and the desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and unto Adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of that wife and has eaten of the tree which I commanded thee not that I commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it you notice he didn't curse Adam he said I curse the ground for thy sake remember this my brother's he said I cursed the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns and also thistles shall bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field and the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till the return until until till thou return unto the ground until yeah in all days of your life until thou return to the ground for out of it was doubt taken for dust thou art and dust thou shalt return and we see here Amen my brothers and sisters that thorns and thistles amen I want to read something here a man the prophet of God said in the Garden of Eden said he had everything under control he turned me over into the Garden of Eden free moral agent just like banking saw what I was telling you we have a choice in this day amen when we got reflection he says you have a choice see back here in the Garden of Eden they had a choice he put them on free moral agency son this garden this beautiful place that took me six thousand years to build and he said it's perfect it's yours what a beautiful place he said God was so satisfied till he just went back and rested from all his works every tree now listen Satan's Eden 65 Oh 829 paragraph 57 you can go to 58 if you want to follow me he said what a beautiful place God was so satisfied till he just went back and rested from all his works every tree never brought forth thorns and thistles no berries ever came off of a thorn tree everything was perfect all seeds were perfect everything was in perfect condition then when he went to take a little rest his enemies left him with deceit and took over by misrepresenting his program to his children oh my what a tire my brothers and sisters amen you could take that down thank you amen so we see that the enemy of God slipped in and misinterpreted the word to eat but this fall it had took over to possess the garden himself he took over gardener it took over a passage to the Garden of Eden himself he took it over and now he had 6,000 years of this seat for rule deceiving the people God's children as he did then because they were based on free moral agency to act any way they wish to and believing that they would act right he trusted they would act right and they come with a wrong and sold their birth rights as Esau did for the world and Satan won it and he took it over and he had 6,000 years a man to build his even his kingdom a man so my brothers and sisters I would like to just say Amen today we're living in the most deceitful time ever amen we're living right in the in the in the midst of Satan's garden we're living right in the midst of Satan Eden just like I said we go out on our daily tasks and we rub shoulders with the world every day it is the most cunning and deceitful time ever in history the Christian today has to be more on his toes than any other age the countenance of the devil now makes people believe that they're Christians when they're not amen Matthew 24 says it would be so close that it would deceive the very elect if it was possible I'll show you why it's not possible a man as we move on Timothy that Secretariat to the church up a meal would be heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god trucebreakers false accusers incontinent despisers of those that are good my brothers and sisters incontinent means unable to control one sexual desires but does that describe the world that we live in in the day a man that all right amen we'll move on and trying to keep my notes here kind of organized and we see brother Branham was out one day and he was sitting on a law 5912 19 sister question and answer on the Holy Ghost paragraph 191 and you can go there and we'll start from there hey man yes and he went out there in the law and the logs still laying there was was on here in the tree not long ago laying there was on a tree not long ago down off the mountain and lays across a little path and it comes around from the creek and I was just straddling the law looking across the mountains they met much like I was a couple of weeks ago it made way back there and laid my Bible out like that I saw you know I was thinking on the scripture the coppersmith he had done much he had done me much harm and said things you know I thought I believed I just read that I opened my Bible I said well I wiped my face off and the wind blew it and it turned over to Hebrews 6 well I said that's that's not where it's at so I laid it back like this and the wind blew it open and turned it back again and I said now that strange the wind blowing it like that so I thought well I believe I read it and it said for it is impossible for those who which were once enlightened and made partakers of the Holy Ghost and taste the Word of God and the things of the world to come I thought well I don't see nothing in that I'll read it all down and the rest of the chapter nothing in it I said well this settles that for me I saw it like this and back it went again and I picked it up and I thought well what is that he says I kept reading and I kept reading and why I says I can't understand I read all down and I read oh damn is impossible for those which are once enlightened it come on down to a place where it said and the Earth's drink is the rain that come off upon it to bring forth herbs meat to them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessings from God but that which bears thorns and briers is rejected and Nile to the cursings whom judgment is to be burned he says I wonder what that means I now was thinking about nothing up there just stinking and just in as I was sitting there I thought Lord you give me a vision about brother Davis and them down there and I was sitting there and I look and I said something begin turning across the hollow in front of me anything and it was a world a world turning and I seen it it all broke I seen it was all broke up he's talking about the world it was all broke up just look like was all plowed over and a man went forth with a great big thing in front of him full of seeds and was casting seeds all the way down the earth and he went and and he went and he went around the curvature of the earth and he went out of my sight and soon as he went out of my sight here comes a real sneaky fellow looking dressed in black garments going around like this going whoo-whoo-whoo they meant throwing seeds and I watched it as their earth kept turning after a while come up and when the week come up out of the week come briars come thorns come thistles this was throwing stinkweed everything growing up milkweed everything growing up in the week and they was all growing up together then a real bad drought came along and it had his head hung over and the pryzen sisters had their heads hung over each we just panting for breath breathing like that you could just hear them and they call for rain just while along came a great big cloud of water just gush down and when they fell upon the wheat jumped up and begin to howl glory hallelujah praise our Lord and he jumped up in the stinkweed harlot praise the Lord and the thorns and thistles dancing all around over the field hollering glory hallelujah praise the Lord well I see it I can't forget that and the vision left me and I fell back again in the briars which were nigh unto rejection then I got it jesus said the rain falling on the just and the unjust and a man a man can set in the meetings a man and speak with tongues a man and shout and I just like the rest of them with the genuine Holy Ghost and still not be in the kingdom and still not be in the kingdom he didn't say of false Holy Ghost he didn't say a faucet anointing he said the Ginuwine Holy Ghost and still not being the king amen you can come and feel it on your flesh and feel good amen and you can come and be sanctified and justified but if you don't get it on the inside it does you no good it has to be an inside job you have to go all the way with God it's not good enough to say well I've been to church and then and and you go through the motions Amen sometimes some of them it's a condition of the heart amen we're going to get into that amen it's a condition of the heart my brothers and sisters there's not a person here that want to be in torment there's nobody and don't drive hundreds of miles over the icy roads to spend you're living in your money just to come to church here to well say shake hands with people although you love to do that and hear the pastor you although you love to do that and to hear the pastor and myself and other ministers speak the word you get that wherever you are pastors ministers just like we are servants of Christ but there's something that draws you here to this particular place therefore it's the duty of the pastor's to see that your flock is fed amen the right food amen because Almighty God's required your blood on our hands at the Day of Judgment will be answered will answer for you so seeing this great tremendous responsibility that that takes place upon us and God has given us this given us people who love us and come here a man that went should spend our time constantly watching for their souls when the first thing we see raising up not right it's our duty to come to that person because we are Shepherds watching the sheep a man the sheep eating we that would kill it I'd better drive it away I better jerk it back stop don't eat that hey man stay away from that don't even touch it don't even touch it hey man cuz he's a shepherd over your soul amen there's no Nina he said there's no Nover in the Western countries a we that an animal can eat and it's called loco we don't know whether anybody has ever heard of it or not is a local week a horse would eat it and you just can't can't do nothing with him after that oh mama slow down on that right there this local weed he says the horse can eat it and you just can't do nothing with him after that amen he just becomes an outlaw you can't put a saddle on him you can't do nothing with him it's called luckily and you must keep your stock you must keep your flock away from that local weed and if it'll cause of course to eat something if a horse rather it'll eat something that throws them into this condition into spasms why you would be a very poor cowboy to let your horse eat that local weed it shows that you don't care and a real pastor and real servant of Christ would be a poor example of Christ to see sheep eating something that's going to drive them away make him an outlaw before God a breaker of his word a breaker of his Commandments you shouldn't do that you should watch very closely amen that's why my brothers and sisters we have to have shepherds because there's a lot a lot of a lot of wheat a lot of local weed out there amen and he has a define fold ministry is for the perfecting of the saints hey man remember back it he said don't even Jesus God was the great shepherd of that out and he had totally said stay away from everything else you can eat don't even eat it don't even touch it stay away from it and he plays Shepherd a man passes men of God that watch over your soul II see you getting there something that you should let's go to dishonor hurt you Chuck's it away from you it might seem hard but he's trying to save your life don't even touch it stay away from it amen that is the order of God hey man we go on we were circumcised they're circumcised they went right over into the land of promise he's talking about other children of Israel amen when they were delivered out of Egypt he'll walk right up to the baptism of the holy ghost and rejected amen he wants to eat he won't to give it up he'll walk right to the scripture of baptizing in Jesus name in turn BAE amen we have to go all the way but we wonder we said we see all of these thorns and thistles and local weed and state weed and all of these things say how how shall we know they will know them by the fruits that they bear you'll know about a frisson know about a life that they live now listen let me tell you something I don't want to get ahead of myself I'll hold off on that he says you'll know them by that long suffering you'll know them buddy got their goodness they'll miss meekness their gentleness their patience and by the Holy Ghost don't you take some kind of noise don't you take some kind of sensation you wait right there until God has molded you and made you a new creature amen now moving on we see that predestinated plan and view just another study as other see the Word of God is a see a man and it must have a ground prepared it must have a ground prepared beforehand if you sow seed just throw it out there into the ground it would do no good he said birds will pick it up you throw it among stars and thistles in a choke it out and soon Jesus the parable says so the ground has to be made ready first so God in His sovereignty prepares the heart first he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age he foreknew you by foreknowledge and ordained you to eternal life he knew you the reason you staggered out of the things that you were in and staggered into here this morning because he knew you and he had prepared your heart to receive see he meant much like we go back to Paul we look at Paul Paul had orders in his hand any man to go down to Damascus and put a stop to the things that was going on down there he had orders to put them in Chains and bind him up amen but on the way Paul to the sanhedrin court I met him fine man by the name of Steven there they was they was getting ready to lock him up any men but Stephen had other things he let him know exactly what he thought about it he let him know exactly where he stood he said all you stiff neck uncircumcised of heart he gave him the business and they got so upset with with Stephen Paul so gave order to kill him they took him outside the city and they picked up Robson they laid the coats at his feet and so looking at this and they they they they throw in the stalls and they bash the Prophet said they bashed his brains out and all why this was going on that great warrior Stephen held his hands up and gave God praise and the Prophet said the Lord rocked him to sleep he never felt the one just rocked in the sleeves amen Paul watching this no doubt it had an effect on him no doubt much like the prophets old friend Bert that SERPs are that mother deer standing there in the sight of that gunfire ready to G said yet from that distance he could have blew her heart plumb up out of her chest he didn't care heard her doe he was coming for her child a man so Bert saw something real no doubt Paul looking at this and seeing how this man stood for Amy and he gave His life for did he saw something that break his heart what was it doing preparing ground who was preparing the ground so Saul and the two soldiers went on to me they they got on their horse and they begin to go over and we see that they come to the road and he said about 11 o'clock in the daytime the Sun is almost directly overhead at that time but a great light surrounded him and he said Paul knocked him off of his horse he couldn't not other two soldiers didn't see a thing and he said Lord let me let me make sure I get all of this right amen amen cuz we're going somewhere my brothers and sisters a man you love the Lord a man he was on the road to Damascus streaking down and he heard a voice saying Saul why persecutest me and he looked up and looking up being a Jew he knew that the pillar of fire was it was the Lord that led the children of Israel he noticed because he was remember he was a very educated study of description remember this Hebrew is Hebrew he would have never called anything Lord capital o lor D Elohim unless he had been satisfied that what he was that what it was because he was too trained a scholar and when he looked up he seen this light this pillar of fire that had led his people through the wilderness and he said Lord who are you and what a surprise it must have been to this great theologian to say I'm Jesus the very one that you are against what a turnaround he said it must have been something terrific to this man that all of his ambitions that he had to find out all at once that he had been persecuting his ambitious drove him drove him father away from the main thing that he meant to do oh what a time my brothers and sisters amen I hope we're looking in the mirror this morning and when a great shock must have come upon it for this apostle when he said I'm Jesus the very one that you're persecuted why Paul why do you persecute me another quotation we might drop in here you see he said the churches would make they make fun of the churches they're not really making fun of the church they're not really making fun of you they're making fun of Jesus why persecutest thou me how could Paul then so intellect all is intellect all is education believe that this was that this group he was persecuting was the very God that he claimed to be serving my god think of that my brothers and sisters without going into details I think we're all well trained enough to know what I mean here the same thing is happening today Paul through ignorance to see trickery of the enemy yet he was intelligent smart those uneducated Galileans that he was persecuted had already in their humility accepted this man as Lord but Paul and his great teachings and insulated could not accept it oh my I wonder how Paul fell because he knew that he had seen something real and Steven he had seen God on the scene and now God was talking to him God knew his name he couldn't see but he heard the voice I said Paul why do you persecute me Lord who are you I'm Jesus oh my I can only imagine the terror that gripped his heart have I crossed the line what am I to do Lord I didn't know but God knew his name Saul heard his voice hey man I just want to say he knows your name this morning can you hear his voice as young heart being prepared to receive the Word of God amen let's go on any man it must have been for Paul something for Paul to see as strained as she was a vice versa educated now he knew that he had had an experience so there's a good lesson experienced alone isn't enough it's got to be experienced according to the Word of God amen now a man pray for the Saints amen pick up where I left off here but now he had heard the gospel of faith come hearing the revelation this little something inside of you another man sitting right by you may not hear I don't believe such nonsense let me go back a man now here predestinated plan and view God to see must have been in a prepared ground if you so see just throw it out there on the ground it would be no good that birds will pick it up thorns and thistles will choke it out so the ground has to be made ready God in His sovereignty race prepares the heart first he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him at this age he foreknew you by his foreknowledge amen and the place where he had ordained for you now you've heard the gospel and faith come by here just like Paul revelation comes by hearing there's a little something inside of you another man setting right there say oh I don't believe such nonsense I don't believe that nothing to it like they did on the day of Pentecost they laughed at these men they say they're full of new wine they know that that was a great thing that those they know it was it was a great thing to those it was happening to Wow it was God revealing himself to the individual the others left these were rejoicing than the individual revelation which is faith faith that's revealed and if it wasn't faith it wouldn't even have been there just seed has to have the right prepared ground first therefore all he foreknew all he called all he called he foreknew all he predestinated if you want to read it it's over in Romans now that's the trouble today so much difference that the Christian of old when the real true revelation of Jesus Christ being Emmanuel dwelled in a revelation of Jesus being Emmanuel dwell in the hearts of those men they will rugged people but today we want to be patted and taking care of let me go through that again the real true revelation of Jesus Christ being Emmanuel dwell in the hearts of those men made them rugged people in other words that's us I don't care how tough it is I don't care what I may have to go through I don't care the trial I don't care the tribulations I realize that what we're certainly gonna give us over into a better ladies I realized that this is going to take us home I realize that yet we might suffer for a little while there's joy in the morning-time it has to be a personal revelations amen so I can see these going back to Genesis they're speaking of Adam prophet says I can see this great space being moved together like this coming down to a funnel shape and it moves right down and he began to eyes that little cup looking like the Father he began to eye that little cup going down through the garden bloody skins flump it against her leg he couldn't stand it moved on down to the very heart of God now I want you to stay with me here it moved down to his heart he saw his children amen what they have done and what they were getting ready to go through and it moved on his heart God so loved he just couldn't see him go through that he called him back I'm going to put enmity between your seed and same seed and then when it's done at Calvary when God Himself came down through a woman born of how I could he said how could I just deal with that forward a little bit notice when they were treatment from the God and because of transgressions all the blessings of God was cut off because of the transgression I think tonight that that's what's the matter with the church all the blessings are cut off because of transgressions amen the Prophet said I used to think that God was angry with me I used to think he was angry with me but Christ loved me and I come to find out that Christ is the very heart of God he is the very heart of God Christ being God's heart now love overcome love love hide sins or get rid of sin God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son and whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life now I don't want us to do like everybody else's John in that scripture and just toss over it God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son I want you to really think about that he didn't just so loved the world he loved that world he don't love this field not this is Satan's even but he so loved it he said it was perfect his children were in the garden they didn't have to walk for nothing just trust God but after the transgression thorns and thistles and all of these kind of things come up and we deal with thorns and thistles today malice Hey in the strife their thorns and met thistles that poke calls pain resentment these are the fruit that these thorns and thistles bear God is love joy peace meekness the holy spirit soft loving but all of these other things that we have to deal with on a daily basis he cursed at him at the ground and he said that you have to work at this ground to eat we have to go to work we got to deal with jealous co-workers we got a deal with people trying to climb to the top and they are so engulfed with their position and money they will lie on you talk about you run you die but we got to deal with it thorns and thistles thorns and thistles but that's alright because we have a revelation that one day those thorns and those thistles will be burned up we'll walk out on the ashes of the wicked and the meek shall inherit the earth amen so we stay with the things of God because we have a revelation let's move on the Prophet said that God yes I thought he was angry with me but Christ loved me he said Jesus Christ was the very heart the very heart of God amen now I want you to understand amen when Jesus went before a man Pontius Pilate aney before the the judgment and they said crucify him crucify him those soldiers took him down the first thing they did was they made a crown of thorns those thorns that was meant for you and me they took him now these wasn't just little bitty birds these were thorns and they pressed it upon the head of our Lord Jesus and as the blood came streaming down in his head the blood in his eyes as they led him to the cross and they whooped him and they spat on him a shirt handfuls of his beard I they did all kinds of things to him he stood up hung up on that cross looking through those blood looking through the blood as those thorns those very thorns that at the beginning was dead because of our transgressions was pressed upon his head and he's bleeding in the blood in his eyes and he looked and all your sins are scarlet he's looking through the blood and all he sees his way Father forgive them for they know not what they do and so today my brothers and sisters we listen to the devil's life instead of accepting the real truth of the gospel in this hour as we hear you know when God is talking to you you mock it you turn it aside what are you doing you're pressing those thorns on his head why do stop persecuting me you go out and you do all kind of matter of evil and you do these things and you and you mean to one another and you bite bite and you do all these things why you're not persecuting one another without person killed me I looked at the Hat for you I paid the price all you have to do is go free why do they persecute me amen when all of these feelings and things rise up in you against your brothers and sisters with you when you when you when you're doing wrong and you know you're doing wrong and you can't come to the altar this why do it style persecute me thorns and thistles my brothers and sisters only the Holy Spirit amen I believe his son of God if you have been born again you're taking somebody's word for it you say well the Bible says so that's right the Bible did but what do you say well the preacher says so the preacher is right but what do you say my mother says it's right but what about you is it a personal experience of your own that you've got to be born again and you'll never if you never born again you'll never understand it it's not good enough to put on long skirts it's not good enough to put on a nice suit it's not good enough to come to the church you can do all of things and your heart is as black as midnight God deals with the heart he deals with the heart we must take on his heart why do it not persecute me a man scientists researchers find that in the human heart there's a little teeny sail that hasn't even got blood it hasn't got anything in it it's a little compartment he says the animals don't even have it only the human being and they say it's the occupation of the soul so after all a man believes in his heart it's not enough to have head knowledge you have to heart amen now your intellectual faith won't really it'll reason you said well now the Bible teaches that certainly but let me think now the days of miracle is past pastor said the days of miracle is past the pastor says so she says and I believe that this day we don't have that not see you're using intellectual faith and that intellectual faith will reason with God it's word but a born-again experience from the heart or not reason it'll say God's Word is right there's more no more to do with it is that right because something down here that says in itself there's nothing a man to do with it a few minutes that's for the musicians come amen amen this morning made of shades be pulled down to the cares and thoughts of this life over our memories over our hearts me this life over the made over our memories over our heart made this life over our members and our hearts and may we just see Jesus in him alone and we know that if we could draw a picture of a love of the love of God ten million times more the Seas of the earth banked into a tube a few inches across would reach billions of miles beyond the Stars and thinking of the pressure that would be at the bottom of that tool how that water would be billions of tons of pressure trying to press down and yet the love of God is searching our hearts tonight or this morning great powers of strength he would like to find one little crevice to leap through to come into our lives and give us this great power and unction beyond every man's understanding he says granite Lord tonight the doors of heaven would be pulled back and the Holy Spirit will take over full control may our souls be flooded with such a rush that we'll forget all about being crippled all about being sick will forget all about our problems and forget all about our aches and pains amen to take him at his promised claim the redemptive blessing of Jesus Christ amen this morning my brothers and sisters God is knocking at your heart amen he don't want only thing he want is your heart Amen I'm convinced that if he kiss your heart he has everything else if you love him correctly Amen he won't have any problem when everything else amen these thorns and thistles when you reject our you're pressing those stones into so that were meant for you amen on the crime that they placed upon my Lord and Savior amen let us stand to our feet this morning a man we see that Paul [Music] heard a voice of Almighty God when
