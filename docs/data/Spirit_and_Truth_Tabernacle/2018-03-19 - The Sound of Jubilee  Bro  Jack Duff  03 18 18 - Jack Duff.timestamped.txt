[54:34] calls and get some people were there to
[54:36] help them but he is going through a lot
[54:40] of his body right now but Quentin told
[54:41] me that he went through a number of
[54:43] heart just things with us are some
[54:48] surgeries that he had there had a valve
[54:51] put in they just found out the valve was
[54:54] leaking and you know so they they're not
[54:57] really sure what they want to do about
[54:59] that also they had to give some type of
[55:02] device like a balloon or something like
[55:04] that they kind of helped the heart out
[55:06] and they had a number of things that
[55:08] he's just been going through and so
[55:12] they're asking for our prayers a man
[55:15] that we would just remember mr. Leon and
[55:18] prayer I found out that some of the
[55:21] brothers from the church that brother
[55:22] Quentin was attending there they have
[55:25] gone by to visit the father in the

[56:36] that but all of those that would like to
[56:39] go and serve in some capacity and that
[56:40] what I mean by that is that we have to
[56:43] have people kind of watching you know
[56:44] the altar somebody come up to save if
[56:48] it's a lady that gets saved then we got
[56:49] to have some strong sisters that can
[56:51] kind of help support that brothers that
[56:54] would be equipped and prepared you know

[56:57] done but we just want to make sure we
[56:59] have you know everybody lined up so if
[57:01] you desire to serve it in any capacity
[57:03] please make sure you get with me let me
[57:06] know and we'll see what we can get you
[57:07] plugged in a man for this but we're
[57:10] really under expectation for God to do
[57:12] some some great things if you have a
[57:14] testimony that you'd like to share maybe
[57:16] underneath the temp God's got something
[57:18] from you for you delivered you from
[57:20] something something that you know it be
[57:22] an encouragement if he's healed you from
[57:24] something then sometimes you know
[57:26] there'd be a real encouragement to
[57:27] people and we want to we want to hear
[57:29] that now I'll be honest I want to hear
[57:31] the testimony before I put you under the
[57:33] tent you understand I don't want
[57:36] surprises a man we don't want surprises

[58:32] victory and defeat is a fact and and he
[58:37] would talk about faith and he made a
[58:39] statement he says your faith has to be
[58:43] greater than facts and he said it was a
[58:48] fact that Lazarus was in the grave it
[58:53] was a fact that he was dead that was the
[58:57] fact but faith is what paul ashworth

[1:11:09] Matthew 24 a man I mentioned earlier to
[1:11:16] the Sunday School class that this is the
[1:11:20] week a man and I said today would have
[1:11:22] been the data brother branham would have
[1:11:23] preached certain messages but I am a day
[1:11:25] behind yesterday would have been the
[1:11:27] first day where the seals would have
[1:11:29] been preached back in 63 and he would
[1:11:32] open up with God hiding himself in
[1:11:38] simplicity revealed himself in the same
[1:11:39] and then it comes that night and
[1:11:42] preaches the breach and then today would
[1:11:44] have been the first seal a man that he
[1:11:46] would have preached and so I want to
[1:11:48] encourage you all this week would be a
[1:11:50] good week for you to listen to the seals
[1:11:52] say man just go back and listen to what
[1:11:54] the prophets said amen
[1:11:56] those were very special sermons that God
[1:12:00] saved for your time
[1:12:02] hey man you know those sermons couldn't
[1:12:04] even be there is many that tried to
[1:12:07] preach him with the light that they had
[1:12:09] but but the true like came in 1963 and
[1:12:14] we've been fellowship and underneath
[1:12:16] that a man you know all these years so
[1:12:19] so God sent that to you and sent it with
[1:12:21] seven angels signifying a man through a
[1:12:25] cloud that appeared in 1963 that God was
[1:12:28] trying to get a message to you
[1:12:29] a man glory to God a man and a no time
[1:12:33] to reject is this came supernaturally
[1:12:36] alright glory to God it lands it's so so
[1:12:40] important he put a cloud in the sky and
[1:12:42] y'all gonna give it to a plane not me

[1:12:51] mean that that's something I'm sorry
[1:12:53] just you know but I just I just believe
[1:12:56] his message and and I thank God for it
[1:12:58] but I encourage you this would be a good
[1:13:01] week for you too amen go back and listen
[1:13:03] to those sermons amen the seven seals
[1:13:07] praise Lord Matthew 24:24 is the one
[1:13:11] verse that I want to read and then we
[1:13:15] will we will go from there
[1:13:17] actually let's see let me let me skip
[1:13:23] the verse or go up to verse 22 if I can
[1:13:25] on that except those days should be
[1:13:29] shortened there should no flesh be saved
[1:13:33] but for the elects sake those days shall
[1:13:37] be shortened then if any man shall say
[1:13:41] unto you lo here is Christ or there
[1:13:45] believe it not this is low there's
[1:13:50] Christ lo here is Christ or there
[1:13:55] believe it not for there shall arise
[1:13:58] false Christ's rule capitalized and
[1:14:05] plural false Christ's and false prophets
[1:14:13] and shall show great signs and wonders
[1:14:16] and so much that if it were possible
[1:14:19] they shall deceive the very length a man
[1:14:23] less less will stop there you can have
[1:14:27] your seats
[1:14:27] pray the Lord will add a blessed
[1:14:29] blessing to the reading of his word we
[1:14:32] want to just take for a man a topic
[1:14:35] today the sound of Jubilee a man
[1:14:39] of Jubilee
[1:14:43] you know last actual King before it
[1:14:50] before I do that let me read a opening
[1:14:53] quote here out of the lands book of life
[1:14:55] a man y'all just bear with me here so
[1:15:05] just line that up for me Atlanta life
[1:15:11] the way we can see something here in the
[1:15:15] scripture hold on one second we can see
[1:15:17] something here in the scripture and I
[1:15:21] was trying to point this out last week
[1:15:22] you can pull that down for one second
[1:15:24] hold on one second
[1:15:25] the when I was I was bringing us to Rev
[1:15:28] Matthew 17 and in Matthew 17 Jesus made
[1:15:34] a promise here that they were accident
[1:15:39] so you know after they saw Moses and
[1:15:41] Elijah standing there at Mount
[1:15:42] Transfiguration they began disciples had
[1:15:48] a question now the thing of it is is
[1:15:50] they they they couldn't ask these
[1:15:52] questions had they not been studying
[1:15:55] Scripture oh my
[1:15:58] right they couldn't even have these
[1:16:01] questions Oh Lord cannot I mean if I
[1:16:04] could just be bold to say some of the
[1:16:06] stuff that people use in a man to try to
[1:16:09] pull away from the message you couldn't
[1:16:11] even discuss those things with the
[1:16:14] average churchgoer right the only reason
[1:16:18] you can't even have that have that
[1:16:20] position is because God sent a message
[1:16:24] right had there not been a message that
[1:16:27] will not even be a discussion or you can
[1:16:30] even use any of that right you know I
[1:16:33] mean you know so so so so when we when
[1:16:36] we when we look at some of these things
[1:16:37] you know like I was telling us you know
[1:16:40] the church on last night you know
[1:16:42] somebody that would say you know I
[1:16:44] looked it up on Google and I couldn't
[1:16:47] find where so many men fell off a bridge
[1:16:49] that was being built you know so if
[1:16:52] Google
[1:16:52] says that it wasn't a what that the men
[1:16:55] didn't fall off the bridge then then the
[1:16:57] men didn't fall into briefs now now for
[1:16:59] me I can't take it like that actually I
[1:17:02] don't have that much faith not in Google
[1:17:05] I don't have that much faith in Google
[1:17:08] right you know I mean I know Google is
[1:17:11] is designed amen to give you what
[1:17:13] somebody else has put in it right
[1:17:17] amen that's how that that's how the
[1:17:19] internet work that's how Wikipedia works
[1:17:21] somebody gotta put something on there
[1:17:23] and and you don't know who putting it on
[1:17:25] there you just taking it because they
[1:17:27] said I'm gonna take what the Bible said
[1:17:29] right but but but you know I just begin
[1:17:32] to you know just kind of process this
[1:17:34] myself when you talk about a bridge and
[1:17:36] so many men falling off and brother
[1:17:38] branham prophesied it and and since you
[1:17:40] can't find it on Google dinner didn't
[1:17:42] happens at midnight I'm sorry I I can't
[1:17:45] put that kind of faith in Google I said
[1:17:46] now if I'm building a bridge and I'm the
[1:17:48] owner of this of this company that's
[1:17:51] building this bridge you know and and on
[1:17:54] my watch so many men actually fallen and
[1:17:58] died
[1:17:58] do I want those people to put that in
[1:18:01] the newspaper that I own this company so
[1:18:04] many men died and in my company on this
[1:18:07] bridge I am NOT going to release that
[1:18:10] information if I do they're gonna shut
[1:18:13] my project down there's a lot of money
[1:18:16] that's going to be lost right
[1:18:18] yes and you know I mean that even even
[1:18:21] today people get bribes you know
[1:18:22] different things happen man you have
[1:18:24] somebody coming up to your house
[1:18:25] knocking on the dough to try to give you
[1:18:27] a little something to keep you quiet
[1:18:29] that's still have for the day right so I
[1:18:31] can I can imagine of course Google women
[1:18:34] habits somebody's trying to keep that
[1:18:36] quiet but a prophet a prophet has the
[1:18:41] ability so tell you things that happen
[1:18:45] when nobody else will attend it that
[1:18:49] happened in the scripture right when
[1:18:51] Elijah was telling the King avoid here
[1:18:54] weren't there because the king of
[1:18:55] Assyria is coming this way coming that
[1:18:56] way and the king of Syria saying I do I
[1:18:58] have a spy in my camp how come every
[1:19:01] time I go down there the Spanish knock
[1:19:02] that one is gone
[1:19:04] the spy revealed to me the spy so I can
[1:19:06] kill the spot they say King don't get
[1:19:09] too excited don't kill nobody nah don't
[1:19:11] do that they say because uh I'm just let
[1:19:14] you know together they got a prophet in
[1:19:16] the land and that prophet know the very
[1:19:18] things that you're talking about in your
[1:19:19] bedchamber that's that's what a prophet
[1:19:24] can do for you right so you know that
[1:19:27] you know and and and and I just you know
[1:19:29] I have to I gotta just kind of pause
[1:19:31] here you know because it just kind of
[1:19:34] hit me this week you know people first
[1:19:36] time hearing something about a prophet
[1:19:38] you know I mean you you you you you we
[1:19:41] say these things and and and I don't
[1:19:43] want to I'm certainly not here to try to
[1:19:45] fend anybody or anything like that but
[1:19:49] you know when I'm talking about a
[1:19:51] prophet I'm talking about something from
[1:19:52] scripture that God promised for this day
[1:19:54] I'm talking about Malachi chapter 4
[1:19:57] before behold I send you Elijah the
[1:19:59] Prophet before the great and terrible
[1:20:01] day of the Lord I'm talking about
[1:20:02] revelation 10 and 7 I'm talking about
[1:20:04] the fulfillment of Revelation 3 and 14
[1:20:07] I'm talking about statement 17 right I'm
[1:20:10] talking about scriptures like that that
[1:20:11] were promised to be fulfilled in our day
[1:20:13] that's why you got a search scripture
[1:20:15] I'm not I'm not making this up read it
[1:20:18] in your Bible God promised it and we got
[1:20:20] promises that now we just now we live
[1:20:23] under the manifestation of the promise
[1:20:25] but I know sometimes that might that
[1:20:28] might I have to think that if it was my
[1:20:30] first time walking into a church and I
[1:20:33] heard people saying the Prophet the
[1:20:35] Prophet I'm probably like what in the
[1:20:36] world are these people here talking
[1:20:38] about what is it that what you talked
[1:20:41] about
[1:20:42] come on now hold on I'm not I've been
[1:20:44] the church they nobody but I mean and
[1:20:46] now they just talk about Jesus I am I am
[1:20:49] I'm talking about Jesus but I'm talking
[1:20:52] about how he did things today
[1:20:54] glory to God I'm talking about Jesus but
[1:20:57] you got to have spiritual revelation the
[1:20:58] cat's when I'm saying right and I'ma
[1:21:00] tell you if you got spiritual revelation
[1:21:02] amen
[1:21:03] what one thing that I that I that I'm
[1:21:06] confident of is that you will catch it
[1:21:08] Laurie got when I first heard it I
[1:21:11] called it it might have took me a little
[1:21:13] time but I caught it but and once I
[1:21:15] caught it couldn't nobody take it from
[1:21:16] me
[1:21:17] praise the Lord it's gonna take a lot
[1:21:20] mode in the bridge to get me out of this
[1:21:23] I'm sorry if you gotta need some most
[1:21:26] stuff cuz that ain't gonna work and and
[1:21:28] like I told you what my brothers say
[1:21:30] well no John the Baptist feel restored
[1:21:32] all things no no no no I could I got two
[1:21:35] questions on that real quick I don't
[1:21:37] even have to think about it I need to
[1:21:39] have the prayer but I got two questions
[1:21:40] real quick what did he restore tell me
[1:21:46] what and if you ain't got no insurance
[1:21:47] to me in Scripture what he restored if
[1:21:50] you can't summon that you got it I'm
[1:21:52] sorry you can take it but I'm not gonna
[1:21:54] take it
[1:21:55] hallelujah glory to God and if jesus
[1:21:59] promised that he said John the Baptist
[1:22:01] he saying I see lies with has our lives
[1:22:03] will come and restore all things but I
[1:22:05] said to you Elias has already come and
[1:22:07] they did it to him what they what you
[1:22:09] know what was written so when Jesus said
[1:22:11] that I knew that one he was already
[1:22:13] saying John the Baptist what it was he
[1:22:15] lives that come to introduce the first
[1:22:17] coming of Christ but there was another
[1:22:19] spirit of Elijah coming and then before
[1:22:21] the second coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:23] hallelujah amen and that's the duster
[1:22:27] that that that spear Elijah would be a
[1:22:29] prophet according to Malachi 4 it would
[1:22:31] be a prophet that we're coming this time
[1:22:33] to restore all things alright so you
[1:22:37] hear this word prophet and this is where
[1:22:40] I read Matthew 24:24 because soon as you
[1:22:44] you know it should you've been taught in
[1:22:46] church you've been taught we all have
[1:22:48] been taught
[1:22:49] be careful I'm gonna say that profit
[1:22:51] profit profit because the Bible tells us
[1:22:53] this the Bible tells us this let's look
[1:22:55] at it again in Matthew 24 a man you
[1:23:00] should be careful I want you to be
[1:23:01] careful don't just fall for anything
[1:23:03] a man stay with the word alright alright
[1:23:07] a man here in verse 23 Matthew 24 Jesus
[1:23:11] speaks this verse then if any man shall
[1:23:14] say unto you lo here is Christ or there
[1:23:18] believe it not right because this is
[1:23:21] this is one thing that people would go
[1:23:23] to them that this is what Jesus told me
[1:23:25] right st. st. say believe it not and
[1:23:29] then he says and
[1:23:31] 24s for there shall arise false Christ's
[1:23:34] now rouse that pluralized first of all
[1:23:36] we need to understand that Christ means
[1:23:38] Anointed once right I mean Christ means
[1:23:42] to be anointed right so false Christ
[1:23:45] will be first anointed ones multiple
[1:23:48] Amen not just one but multiple oh my god
[1:23:54] Atlanta there shall arise false Christ's
[1:23:56] and false prophets amen and shall show
[1:24:01] great signs and wonders insomuch that if
[1:24:03] it were possible they shall deceive the
[1:24:05] very elect so when you hear somebody
[1:24:08] talking about the proper to talk about
[1:24:09] this you know the one thing that I've
[1:24:11] been able to base my my my my so long
[1:24:15] his scripture tells me that if it were
[1:24:19] possible it would receive the very late
[1:24:22] Amen so so what I'm saying is that if
[1:24:24] I'm elected I cannot be deceit jesus
[1:24:30] said that some kind of way he will bring
[1:24:32] my attention to truth where I will not
[1:24:35] be deceived hallelujah I can rest on
[1:24:38] that so when I heard this for the first
[1:24:40] time amen I knew like it rest my soul
[1:24:43] then I will not be the seat hey man I
[1:24:47] can dig in there a little people I can
[1:24:49] listen to the tapes I can read the books
[1:24:52] because I know that Jesus said I will
[1:24:56] not be to see hallelujah and I know but
[1:25:02] from the years that I first got a hold
[1:25:03] on it - right now I can say I have not
[1:25:07] been to see a man that what else am I
[1:25:12] gonna fellowship around like Peter say
[1:25:15] to whom shall we go only you have the
[1:25:18] words of eternal life you gonna take me
[1:25:22] from this way you taking me to just sit
[1:25:26] home and do what then I'll take this any
[1:25:32] day I'll take this alright stay with me
[1:25:35] I'm trying to get over here to the sound
[1:25:36] of Jubilee glory to God but you know and
[1:25:40] anyone would look at this a man that
[1:25:43] jesus said that they arise false
[1:25:44] Christ's and false prophets but you
[1:25:46] understand
[1:25:47] amen and in order to have something
[1:25:51] false you actually have to have at least
[1:25:54] one thing that's true to compare it
[1:25:59] against yeah you can't compare it
[1:26:04] against you can't compare to false days
[1:26:06] but you have to have at least one true
[1:26:09] thing before you can have a fake dollar
[1:26:12] bogus dollar you have to have at least
[1:26:15] one real dollar come on somebody
[1:26:20] commitment so so oftentimes people get a
[1:26:24] little too quick amen to jump up and say
[1:26:27] Jesus saying watch out for the false
[1:26:29] Christ and fresh muffins yes he did say
[1:26:31] that but that same jesus also spoken
[1:26:34] matthew 17 that he lied to what we're
[1:26:38] coming would come and restore all things
[1:26:41] so you gotta find daddy logic
[1:26:44] watch out for the false but find the
[1:26:46] truth you ain't got nothing to leave
[1:26:51] nobody to virtue zip it up just zip it
[1:27:03] up hold on - we're listening to it I'm
[1:27:06] sorry Church hey man I hate to be so
[1:27:09] bold right but if you have you study
[1:27:12] life with Jesus eventually he got real
[1:27:14] bow with people hey Manny had to get
[1:27:17] that way with the Sadducees and
[1:27:19] Pharisees and Sadducees that he had to
[1:27:21] get them and we got to be the same way
[1:27:22] we got to know what we stand alone glory
[1:27:25] to God amen amen amen all right so let
[1:27:29] me let me now try to read this out of
[1:27:31] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:27:32] watch watch watch watch the true find
[1:27:35] the truth don't don't get jobs on the
[1:27:36] front but find the one truth look at
[1:27:39] this the Bible said in the revelation
[1:27:43] that the Antichrist would come in the
[1:27:45] last day and that he would be so rude
[1:27:48] over in st. Matthew also the 24th
[1:27:51] chapter Jesus speaking saying when the
[1:27:52] Antichrist would come then he'd be so
[1:27:55] close like the real
[1:27:56] got until he would deceive the very
[1:28:00] elect if possible watch deceive the very
[1:28:05] elect the lick where does it come from
[1:28:07] from the word elected he would deceive
[1:28:11] the very elect it if it was possible see
[1:28:15] but it isn't Amen praise God for that
[1:28:20] it is impossible
[1:28:23] I like that and I'm playing I'm placing
[1:28:25] myself in that scripture I'm one of the
[1:28:27] elected so it is impossible for me to be
[1:28:30] deceived even though I've never heard
[1:28:33] nothing about a prophet and all I mean I
[1:28:35] grew up in church grew up in the Baptist
[1:28:37] Church I never heard nothing about these
[1:28:39] things but when I heard it it struck
[1:28:42] something on the inside wait a minute
[1:28:44] Amen is my light had never shined on
[1:28:47] that part of the Bible before and when I
[1:28:49] started looking at I said now and this
[1:28:51] is the thing search the scripture right
[1:28:56] don't search google search the
[1:29:00] scriptures not your encyclopedias don't
[1:29:07] try to get this person opinion in that
[1:29:09] person's opinion search the Scriptures
[1:29:12] the disciples understood scripture
[1:29:17] that's why they can see now did the
[1:29:20] business cross a difference in the the
[1:29:22] leaders say that it would be this way in
[1:29:24] that way they understood scripture see
[1:29:29] if you if you not reading your Bible but
[1:29:31] it's always go right on top of your head
[1:29:35] man church if we all stay with the
[1:29:38] scripture we don't be we're gonna miss
[1:29:40] this but it's so important search
[1:29:42] scriptures read your Bible reads I mean
[1:29:47] people say well I'm going back and read
[1:29:48] my Bible
[1:29:49] I've been reading my Bible that that's
[1:29:52] why I'm not deceived by this I've always
[1:29:54] been reading my Bible that's why I
[1:29:57] believe it because I see it in the Bible
[1:30:01] come on I'm going I'm going further you
[1:30:04] can't be deceived you cannot know
[1:30:06] I don't care what happened you will not
[1:30:09] be deceive you are elected look at this
[1:30:12] like over in Hebrews the sixth chapter
[1:30:14] step four it is impossible for those who
[1:30:16] were once enlightened and have been
[1:30:18] partakers of the Holy Ghost and have
[1:30:20] tasted the heavenly gifts and the power
[1:30:22] of the world to come
[1:30:23] if they would turn and renew themselves
[1:30:24] unto repentance it's impossible
[1:30:27] can't be done that's right a man and and
[1:30:31] you know we just whipped a little bit of
[1:30:33] that on Wednesday night but and brother
[1:30:36] Branham saying you know it's impossible
[1:30:37] for you know a person s that's truly
[1:30:40] Amen the Bride of Christ I mean a part
[1:30:44] of God it's impossible for them to be
[1:30:46] lost right if you truly part of God I
[1:30:49] don't care what goes on your life now
[1:30:50] now you gonna have to pay for your sin
[1:30:52] you're gonna pay for your sin I've you
[1:30:54] know because whatever man so he got to
[1:30:56] reap that's why you got to watch what
[1:30:58] Steve's you sow right because whatever
[1:31:01] you saw you're gonna reap it now and
[1:31:03] understand in the end and the laws of
[1:31:05] Sorna reaping you don't reap it
[1:31:07] overnight you saw it now but years down
[1:31:12] the later years down the line here that
[1:31:15] thing come back and you wonder where it
[1:31:17] came from it was that seed that's you so
[1:31:19] it just came to harvest praise the Lord
[1:31:22] so so good seats and I am so good seats
[1:31:26] praise the Lord
[1:31:28] amen sometimes you know I will tell you
[1:31:32] you young young people something you
[1:31:34] soak this season on because later on you
[1:31:36] might reap it in your children and you'd
[1:31:40] be wondering where this come from no
[1:31:42] remember that seed you sow it came up in
[1:31:45] your child
[1:31:45] oh my all right you start going through
[1:31:49] some stuff alright praise the Lord
[1:31:51] amen it's just these that we saw they
[1:31:54] got to come forth and it just keep us on
[1:31:55] our knees in prayer
[1:31:56] that's all they remember God is a good
[1:31:58] guy he brings us through it all a man so
[1:32:00] so let me let me let me just try to make
[1:32:04] my way into a couple of things here we
[1:32:07] want to talk about this sound of Jubilee
[1:32:09] now it's hard for people to be able to
[1:32:14] receive I remember I was talking to a
[1:32:16] brother you know here a few years ago
[1:32:19] and I was talking about a proud
[1:32:20] he's like God don't use prophets no
[1:32:22] moment say wait a minute wait a minute
[1:32:23] man that's not in the Bible say he said
[1:32:25] we yeah God only use prophets when we
[1:32:26] start trying to give him something now
[1:32:27] now I say the Bible promised it and so
[1:32:30] God still use prophecy he still he used
[1:32:31] prophets evangelists pastors teachers
[1:32:33] you know he does that that's what God
[1:32:35] does you know so you know we kind of
[1:32:37] work through some things and went back
[1:32:38] to the scripture but you know I could
[1:32:41] just kind of imagine even over with
[1:32:43] Moses right when it's time for God to
[1:32:46] call Moses bring him out on the scene
[1:32:48] there in the book of Exodus Moses begin
[1:32:51] the kind of question that I was like god
[1:32:52] it's going to be hard for them people to
[1:32:54] receive me it's going to be hard for
[1:32:55] them to you know for me to just kind of
[1:32:57] go down there and say you know the Lord
[1:32:59] sent me I'm gonna be your deliverer you
[1:33:02] know and I'm again I'm gonna bring you
[1:33:04] out from underneath the bondage of the
[1:33:05] Egyptians and you know it's gonna be
[1:33:07] hard for them just to receive me like
[1:33:08] that so what God had to do is give Moses
[1:33:11] two sides right and the signs not only
[1:33:15] vindicated that Moses was God's chosen
[1:33:17] man right but it also helped Moses to
[1:33:20] get rid of someone in fear that he had
[1:33:22] inside of myself right some of the doubt
[1:33:24] that he might have had about himself
[1:33:25] being able to do the soul so one of the
[1:33:27] things that God told Moses to do us is
[1:33:29] take a rock a man and throw it down say
[1:33:32] take your Rob that you use them to watch
[1:33:34] over the she quit take that and throw it
[1:33:36] down and say when Moses threw it down
[1:33:38] that rod became a stake and and now the
[1:33:40] Bible said Moses begin the run he had
[1:33:43] fear inside of them he's not running
[1:33:45] from that state but God said I'm gonna
[1:33:47] take that fear out of here Moses I want
[1:33:49] you to reach your hand down take it by
[1:33:51] the tail and watch what happened now can
[1:33:53] you imagine if a man running from the
[1:33:54] stake and that God telling him to pick
[1:33:57] the snake up by the tail Oh what that
[1:33:59] must that must have been some challenges
[1:34:01] it could have been hours went by before
[1:34:04] Moses did anything with that snake I'm
[1:34:10] just I know if it was me and God would
[1:34:13] have told me to do something like that I
[1:34:15] would have been questioned is this
[1:34:17] really the voice of God this is a devil
[1:34:21] talking to me do you I mean I can I can
[1:34:24] see Moses going for the state and maybe
[1:34:26] a snake turn on them real quick
[1:34:29] Oh God
[1:34:38] it took something for that man to die to
[1:34:41] himself to follow God and we're gonna
[1:34:44] have to die to our selves to follow this
[1:34:48] message you reached finally finally get
[1:34:55] a hold of it picks it up and it turns
[1:34:57] back into a stick most like why I never
[1:35:00] seen nothing like this never done
[1:35:02] nothing like this so here you know and I
[1:35:06] got oh Lord oh god I'm just oh Jesus
[1:35:10] help me God I got some things but God
[1:35:12] had to do Moses like that God got had to
[1:35:16] have Moses go through this experience
[1:35:18] because he knew what was coming right
[1:35:22] there that you know he and it's the
[1:35:25] second thing that he gave Moses saying
[1:35:27] I'll take your hand and put it down
[1:35:29] inside your bosom and it takes it and
[1:35:32] puts it down and his bullying me close
[1:35:34] it up in his hand and immediately turn
[1:35:36] white like leprosy right and and then
[1:35:39] say that now can you imagine the man
[1:35:41] look at his hair like what what is down
[1:35:43] there that would cause my hand to look
[1:35:46] like that right what does he do right so
[1:35:50] God God begin the show slit and I take
[1:35:52] your hand and put it back down and out
[1:35:53] maybe again fear grips enough last time
[1:35:56] I put my him in there it came it came
[1:36:01] I'm looking white right now I don't know
[1:36:03] what's gonna happen this stuff but it
[1:36:05] took place put his hand back down inside
[1:36:09] of there pull it back up and this time
[1:36:11] it was it was it was just as normal as
[1:36:13] it ever could be that Shonda I'm healing
[1:36:16] to Moses showing the power to bind and
[1:36:20] loose to Moses all these things were
[1:36:23] very important to me he had no clue but
[1:36:26] but he was struggling with himself that
[1:36:27] the people won't believe me that when he
[1:36:32] gets down there to to Egypt a man and he
[1:36:37] goes with his stick and he said not you
[1:36:39] know God God has proven that he's with
[1:36:41] me I know he's with me
[1:36:42] and
[1:36:42] I got confidence that I'm gonna be able
[1:36:44] to lead these people out so you know
[1:36:46] maybe he goes down there and he goes in
[1:36:47] front of pharaoh's court and you say
[1:36:50] thus saith the Lord the Lord has told me
[1:36:53] to tell you Pharaoh let my people go in
[1:36:56] Paris a well who is the Lord you find
[1:37:00] out who he is you say say say say let my
[1:37:04] people go in and Moses immediately took
[1:37:06] his watch and just threw it down on that
[1:37:09] Pharaohs feet and here the thing turned
[1:37:11] into a snake and Tara looks at it they
[1:37:14] say old cheap magician's trick now you
[1:37:18] wonder what kind of stuff where they
[1:37:20] practice it in closed doors behind
[1:37:22] closed doors that he would say it's a
[1:37:24] cheap magician's trick because most most
[1:37:27] everybody else that that saw something
[1:37:28] like that's a my god what is this but
[1:37:31] God knew what was happening down in
[1:37:34] Egypt and he prepared Moses accordingly
[1:37:38] throw it down Moses and don't you fear
[1:37:42] when you see something that's you ain't
[1:37:44] expecting can I say that again don't you
[1:37:48] fear when you see something that you're
[1:37:50] not expecting don't panic don't panic
[1:37:56] what when you see something that you're
[1:37:58] not expecting will you see your family
[1:38:00] doing things that they wasn't expected
[1:38:03] to do when you see them turn from the
[1:38:05] word don't you panic keep claiming your
[1:38:11] promise
[1:38:13] hey hallelujah
[1:38:15] what is your promise I will restore save
[1:38:21] the Lord's a man that belongs to me and
[1:38:30] both of my face it's greater than any
[1:38:35] fact the factsheet of their backslidden
[1:38:40] but my faith says they'll be restored
[1:38:44] the facts say that they don't believe
[1:38:45] but my face says that they will believe
[1:38:48] again my face says they will hear the
[1:38:54] sound of Jubilee and when they finally
[1:38:58] hear the sound that you believe whether
[1:39:01] we go dance we will shout we go say we
[1:39:06] don't race car cane Oh Devon stop it
[1:39:13] just ain't gotta be greater than your
[1:39:15] backs

[1:39:22] brother Jerry stop me save me say fat
[1:39:25] Dee's my knife is sitting there on the
[1:39:28] dresser
[1:39:29] that's what the facts say my knife is on
[1:39:33] the dresser
[1:39:33] but faith will pull it out the drop stop
[1:39:37] put it in my pocket my faith is greater
[1:39:42] than my facts Moses just Rob down until
[1:39:55] snaking Pharaoh says chief magician
[1:39:57] trick man there's nothing to this
[1:40:02] it's a jamison Jambres show this fellow
[1:40:06] what you get
[1:40:09] and they just walked up Danny I need I
[1:40:12] need other kits this because Janice in
[1:40:15] gem breeze was given a platform to
[1:40:21] demonstrate what they have keyword given
[1:40:27] a platform I got a quote for you a
[1:40:31] little bit they were given a platform to
[1:40:36] demonstrate what they have showed us
[1:40:40] meant what you got Jamison Jambres throw
[1:40:45] a rise down snakes becomes things and
[1:40:48] Farrell product that moves like well
[1:40:50] what you got now I told you the cheat
[1:40:53] magician trick my magicians been doing
[1:40:54] that for a while what you got mo just
[1:40:57] said de you didn't say nothing didn't do
[1:41:00] nothing but all of a sudden his snake
[1:41:04] rose up swallowed the first thing second
[1:41:10] stick sitting there not maybe that's
[1:41:11] Nick didn't know what was going on got
[1:41:13] the other snake swallowed him - snake
[1:41:15] swallowed by one snake and when they
[1:41:18] finish and they finished following the
[1:41:20] snakes then see Moses had to go through
[1:41:23] that experience he knew not to be afraid
[1:41:26] of the snake because he had he had the
[1:41:27] power of the snake right
[1:41:29] but he waited to to Pharaoh snakes got
[1:41:31] eaten up Janus and Jabbar sticks that
[1:41:33] eaten up and then he reached down and
[1:41:35] picked up his thing and turned it back
[1:41:37] into steam I don't know if Janice and
[1:41:39] Jen breeze could turn their back to
[1:41:41] sticks they can make up stinks but could
[1:41:45] they make it back of steam
[1:41:50] see Moses had the power to bind em loose
[1:41:53] oh and I want to tell you the pride has
[1:41:59] that same power to bind and loose so
[1:42:05] Moses Moses Moses takes it in heat and
[1:42:07] he puts it out now where you fix that
[1:42:09] and you put some mow down there where
[1:42:10] eat them up - a little bit but what we
[1:42:16] got were what we call kernel
[1:42:18] impersonations and brother branham hat
[1:42:21] you know multiple signs that God gave
[1:42:23] him as well you know in his ministry and
[1:42:25] you know and and and one of them praying
[1:42:29] for the sick God would allow him to
[1:42:30] touch their hands a man whose first pull
[1:42:33] and then he'd be able to count of tail
[1:42:35] just by touching person hands with
[1:42:36] different vibrations that would happen
[1:42:37] on his hand
[1:42:38] he'd be able to tell what condition the
[1:42:39] other person had then that second pull
[1:42:42] God gave him the ability to notice
[1:42:44] secrets of the people's hearts right
[1:42:46] that was a second pool so without
[1:42:48] touching you I could tell you exactly
[1:42:49] you know what's going on with you
[1:42:50] because God shows it to me in a vision
[1:42:52] and then that third pool was the
[1:42:54] revealing of the word now many people
[1:42:56] were very very excited with the first
[1:42:58] pool - praying for the sick in the
[1:42:59] second pool a man knowing the secrets of
[1:43:01] the heart but many of them dropped off
[1:43:03] when it came to the third pool the
[1:43:05] opening of the word hallelujah I'm still
[1:43:10] here by the grace of God and I am
[1:43:12] Fellowship and underneath this open
[1:43:14] worked I want to read something play
[1:43:17] this is out of Revelation chapter 5 part
[1:43:18] 2 remember Janice and Jambres was given
[1:43:23] the platform to impersonate they were
[1:43:27] given a platform look at this in
[1:43:30] Revelation chapter 5 and and brother
[1:43:34] Branham certainly was one that was
[1:43:35] warmed by the angel they said it's gonna
[1:43:36] be many if you try to explain these
[1:43:38] things there's gonna be minute it's
[1:43:39] gonna impersonate what you're doing and
[1:43:40] that happened right when he tried to
[1:43:42] explain it he says then we got kernel
[1:43:44] impersonations of it oh my it's just
[1:43:47] pitiful he says look I want to how many
[1:43:51] Pentecostals in here raise up your hand
[1:43:53] all right look you Pentecostals a few
[1:43:55] years ago God really fell upon you and
[1:43:57] you began to speak with tongues that's
[1:44:00] right but what did
[1:44:01] devil do he come around and give a car
[1:44:04] no impersonation of that he made out of
[1:44:06] he made out something that wasn't right
[1:44:08] got the people down and speaking in
[1:44:11] tongues and making them say certain
[1:44:14] words and things to make them speak in
[1:44:17] tongues that's what you know this is
[1:44:20] 1961 now we know that number the truth
[1:44:23] they beat you on the back said Jesus
[1:44:24] Jesus say it say it say it real fast
[1:44:26] that real fast I ain't speaking in
[1:44:32] tongues that's not what happened then on
[1:44:34] the day of Pentecost right but I mean it
[1:44:36] come on come on six exits exit you know
[1:44:43] if God give you the gift of tongues to
[1:44:45] give it a gift of tongues with that
[1:44:46] nobody beaten you amen but but he said
[1:44:50] let me say say making them certain
[1:44:52] making them say certain words and things
[1:44:54] to make them speak in tongues and so
[1:44:56] forth a man living with another man's
[1:44:58] wife and all kind of things in all kinds
[1:45:00] and some of them drinking smoking and
[1:45:02] everything still speaking with tongues
[1:45:04] what did he do that for to make the real
[1:45:07] trumpet give an uncertain sound to the
[1:45:11] people then who can prepare himself for
[1:45:13] battle see then when this come up now we
[1:45:17] got people out in the audience there's
[1:45:18] one right went right before me up there
[1:45:21] in Canada even now while the agents
[1:45:23] picked him up as a homosexual see saying
[1:45:26] oh my God give me the gift of
[1:45:28] discernment say hallelujah set now the
[1:45:30] Lord told me that somebody in here is
[1:45:32] named John of course if you got a
[1:45:34] thousand people there you got somebody
[1:45:36] in there named John yes of course
[1:45:40] these are impersonations now watch this
[1:45:42] one we had a little woman here one
[1:45:45] morning come back there you remember
[1:45:48] come back there and she said the Lord
[1:45:51] give me the same gift and I said well
[1:45:55] she said I wish I had a chance to prove
[1:45:59] it look at this I said there's the
[1:46:03] platform
[1:46:05] Janice and Janice was given a platform
[1:46:09] this lady came to the tabernacle where
[1:46:13] brother Branham preaches completely gets
[1:46:15] women preachers now she didn't preach
[1:46:17] but she was given the platform amen in
[1:46:20] order to exercise this gift that she
[1:46:22] said God gave her Janice and Jefferies
[1:46:26] now I'm gonna tell you something it take
[1:46:27] a prophet to do something like that it
[1:46:31] take a proper because if I knew
[1:46:32] somebody's coming here like that I would
[1:46:33] have ah no no no no no no we can't do it
[1:46:36] like that
[1:46:36] hallelujah right but I'm gonna tell you
[1:46:39] something let me just but you can leave
[1:46:40] this there leave it there for a second
[1:46:41] I'm a taster
[1:46:42] sometimes things happen and you wasn't
[1:46:46] expecting it
[1:46:47] one time we was in church and we had
[1:46:51] somebody come and you know praise the
[1:46:53] Lord it was good to have them there but
[1:46:55] man as soon as I finished preaching that
[1:46:58] lady grabbed her Bible ran up to the
[1:46:59] front so fast and start the Lord gave me
[1:47:01] a word the Lord said I said what and
[1:47:04] there's nothing you can do but then I
[1:47:06] did I forget what I said to the people
[1:47:08] but you know but I just kind of huh yeah
[1:47:14] I say remember brother branham talked
[1:47:16] about the lady putting up with rockets
[1:47:18] and and when she pulled up her stockings
[1:47:20] you know she was getting ready to give a
[1:47:22] word to so you know to the church and
[1:47:24] brother branham told her ladies sit down
[1:47:26] now now the first time he did it she
[1:47:30] didn't get so sit down the second time
[1:47:32] she did it she did not get told sit down
[1:47:34] but the third time it was sit down yes
[1:47:38] I'm talking to you sit down so when that
[1:47:41] happened it was the first time we give
[1:47:43] her grace so sometimes people be given
[1:47:45] the platform to the counter say certain
[1:47:47] things but you see God is not in that
[1:47:50] and when you have been rooted and
[1:47:52] grounded in the word then nothing shakes
[1:47:56] you let me go on and read this this lady
[1:48:00] was given the platform and all that was
[1:48:02] was a Jenison jamberry spirit they had
[1:48:06] brother Branham allowed to go forth
[1:48:07] because you had to be able to see the
[1:48:08] difference you say you got something
[1:48:11] okay there's a platform let's see what
[1:48:13] you got and say you've seen what
[1:48:14] happened pure man
[1:48:16] psychology see but when you see sister
[1:48:20] Snider come one come on up and tour it
[1:48:23] now I'm just looking at this quote y'all
[1:48:25] I'm just I'm just can y'all see this
[1:48:27] this lady is in the tabernacle saying
[1:48:31] she got the same gift at the Prophet Han
[1:48:32] and brother Branham gives her the
[1:48:34] platform the counter go ahead let's see
[1:48:36] what you got
[1:48:37] and not only does he give it a platform
[1:48:39] but the Saints the Saints are coming
[1:48:46] through the prayer line now that now we
[1:48:49] the counter people that if we see
[1:48:51] something like that come on y'all y'all
[1:48:53] and go preach with me y'all ain't
[1:48:55] preaching with me y'all y'all y'all
[1:48:58] looking at me real funny y'all they
[1:48:59] reach in with me if y'all saw something
[1:49:03] like that what one of premises that
[1:49:05] we've got to be much sure that we saw
[1:49:13] we've been approached you gotta be like
[1:49:24] that Church right sometimes you find
[1:49:27] yourself in situations don't panic don't
[1:49:30] panic
[1:49:31] yeah it's okay it's gonna work out just
[1:49:33] fine maybe God want to use that to get
[1:49:36] that person attention right but if we
[1:49:38] all go to act before Lord we had that
[1:49:45] happen one time and I appreciate the
[1:49:47] church I didn't you know these things
[1:49:49] are not in my notes I'm trying to get to
[1:49:51] other things but we had that happen but
[1:49:54] we got blasted bus did
[1:50:00] we were told the Holy Ghost is not here
[1:50:04] in West Palm Beach the Holy Ghost ain't
[1:50:08] here that's what we was told and then
[1:50:11] after after date we got busted and and
[1:50:13] then they they call for a circle Saints
[1:50:16] I mean they Saints to come up to pray at
[1:50:19] the altar and they got them all on the
[1:50:21] floor Dupree and I saw st. get out their
[1:50:24] chairs and come join the circle I say
[1:50:27] praise the Lord for a mature group of
[1:50:29] beef thank the Lord for that rather than
[1:50:33] just sit around just look at the people
[1:50:34] no because they because I'm gonna be
[1:50:35] like
[1:50:42] but the mature Saints came right in and
[1:50:44] just join right in with him and praise
[1:50:46] the Lord you know amen
[1:50:53] sometimes things happen Church and if
[1:50:56] you're not matured then you you know you
[1:50:58] you respond the wrong way hallelujah
[1:51:04] hallelujah all right let me let me let
[1:51:07] me go on with this since this is neither
[1:51:11] coming up and told her and told her she
[1:51:13] had arthritis that finished it the first
[1:51:16] person on the platform she saw the lady
[1:51:19] walking with a cane and said you got
[1:51:21] arthritis what's this plan then I said
[1:51:25] that isn't what's wrong with the woman
[1:51:29] that's that she fell and broke her hip
[1:51:31] that's why she got the king she got on
[1:51:35] the ride and she fell and broke her hip
[1:51:37] that's not why she here right and it
[1:51:43] says and I said she's not even standing
[1:51:45] there of course there's a sign that
[1:51:47] didn't hear too well and she said and
[1:51:50] what she said what she had I believe was
[1:51:52] a growth in a stomach of something other
[1:51:54] own like that I said that's what it is
[1:51:55] sitting here talking to the Brethren
[1:51:57] about it the whole time see but just to
[1:51:59] show that the church see that is carnal
[1:52:02] comparison you see and what does that it
[1:52:05] makes the real trumpet hallelujah so
[1:52:09] you're gonna have you got to beware of
[1:52:10] false Christ's false ignoring it was you
[1:52:13] certainly have to beware of be aware of
[1:52:15] that but you also want to look for the
[1:52:17] real and the true and understand that
[1:52:20] God has promised you that you would not
[1:52:22] be deceived because you are very elected
[1:52:24] Oh glory to God let me read another
[1:52:28] something out of the gifts and callings
[1:52:30] are without repentance Moses was given
[1:52:33] those two signs a man the Prophet was
[1:52:36] given three pools but this was in order
[1:52:38] to prove to the people that God was
[1:52:40] sending a man Moses or God was sending
[1:52:43] his prophet God gave these these very
[1:52:45] specific things for them to do and God
[1:52:47] used that for his glory
[1:52:50] let me read here out of Gibson Collins
[1:52:52] on without repentance now watch this
[1:52:54] here's what happened when the time I met
[1:52:57] him when he appeared as a man I was
[1:53:01] sitting in my study
[1:53:02] now he's talked about meeting Christ
[1:53:03] says he came I seen the light spread out
[1:53:07] on the floor now I'm getting ready to
[1:53:09] say something here oh yes Sunday School
[1:53:12] class y'all stay with me on this one
[1:53:14] this is for y'all all right
[1:53:17] Amen I've seen the light spread out on
[1:53:19] the floor he came walking to me he
[1:53:22] looked like a man that weighed 200
[1:53:24] pounds and this light was just above me
[1:53:26] and he had his arms full actually I'm
[1:53:29] not this is not Christ this is the angel
[1:53:30] this is the angel right and this light
[1:53:33] was just above me and he had his arms
[1:53:35] folded he had a look as you don't see on
[1:53:38] the face of mortals he looked very calm
[1:53:40] and quiet
[1:53:41] very loving his voice when he spoke I
[1:53:44] knew it was the same voice that had
[1:53:45] spoke all down through life's journey
[1:53:48] but I've never seen its face he was dark
[1:53:51] complexion more like the Spanish the
[1:53:54] Jewish people he had his arms folded and
[1:53:57] he looked away 200 pounds in stature and
[1:54:00] height and had hair to his shoulders and
[1:54:02] a smooth face yet when he had walked it
[1:54:06] seemed like that there was a power and
[1:54:08] he'd do anything and I was sitting there
[1:54:11] and I was so scared that I was biting my
[1:54:15] fingers just imagine standing face to
[1:54:17] face with something like that I was
[1:54:19] biting my fingers then I went he said
[1:54:22] don't fear when that voice spoke I knew
[1:54:25] it was the same one he looked at me his
[1:54:27] eyes looked upon me kindly not to look
[1:54:31] sympathizing with this angel
[1:54:35] but-but-but-but born a peculiar birth
[1:54:38] and and your peculiar life has been to
[1:54:41] indicate that you're to take the gift of
[1:54:43] divine healing to the people of the
[1:54:45] world
[1:54:45] I said sir I'm uneducated I couldn't go
[1:54:48] he said I'll let I'll get them to
[1:54:51] believe you I said if you'll get them to
[1:54:53] believe you and if you're sincere when
[1:54:56] you pray nothing shall stand before your
[1:54:58] prayer if you'll get them to believe you
[1:55:00] and I said I bet
[1:55:02] they wouldn't believe me sir he said
[1:55:04] you'll be given to science as the
[1:55:06] prophet Moses was given to science to
[1:55:09] get the people to believe you is the
[1:55:11] real is really the issue he said one of
[1:55:13] them was detective diseases just by
[1:55:15] holding the person's right hand on your
[1:55:17] left and said then if you'll be sincere
[1:55:19] it shall come to pass that you'll tell
[1:55:21] the very secrets of their hearts and the
[1:55:23] things that they are doing wrong to
[1:55:25] build a faith in the people to be to be
[1:55:27] to be in faith and to vindicate you that
[1:55:30] that I God will send it to you now here
[1:55:34] for the branham's told by an angel a man
[1:55:37] that he would get the same thing that
[1:55:39] Moses had Moses had two signs now he's
[1:55:42] giving two signs and as he goes for four
[1:55:44] he's just all they gotta do is just get
[1:55:46] the people to believe and if he just get
[1:55:48] the people leave say not even cancer was
[1:55:50] tending the way of his prayer not even
[1:55:52] cancer so so you know here here the
[1:55:54] thing you know here he's giving us a
[1:55:55] description of the angel now you know I
[1:55:57] know there's many people that say
[1:55:58] they've seen angels and things of that
[1:56:00] nature you know all that all that's fine
[1:56:02] but but what I'm what I'm trying to say
[1:56:04] is that this don't happen every day to
[1:56:06] people right this don't happen every day
[1:56:08] and when I heard these things for the
[1:56:10] first time like Lord this is something
[1:56:12] unique this is a very special ministry
[1:56:14] that you're sending to the earth and and
[1:56:16] in the world like I said I rest my soul
[1:56:18] on God's promise that they bury let
[1:56:20] can't be the seed so let's start digging
[1:56:22] deeper like wait a minute now wait a
[1:56:25] minute that that day I mean look at the
[1:56:27] supernatural God the same God that I'm
[1:56:29] read about in the Bible I'm seeing this
[1:56:30] manifested in this ministry and I'm just
[1:56:34] I'm just all I can say is that as I'm
[1:56:37] still is manifested I am hearing the
[1:56:39] sound of Jubilee Oh glory as I'm seeing
[1:56:44] these things ain't nan
[1:56:45] uh-uh-uh-uh and I'm reading about it I'm
[1:56:47] hearing about I'm hearing different
[1:56:48] testimonies I'm here in the sound of
[1:56:50] Jubilee Oh glory to God you know there
[1:56:54] was a testimony that happen and one of
[1:56:57] the meetings brother Branham went to and
[1:56:59] I just heard this recently he went to
[1:57:02] Mexico and that dead baby had come back
[1:57:04] to life the mother had the baby for 12
[1:57:07] hours in her arms dead and she took the
[1:57:09] baby to the meet and fighting through to
[1:57:11] Russia's just to get to the platform and
[1:57:13] God showed the Prophet a vision that the
[1:57:15] bed
[1:57:15] who was smiling and he prayed for the
[1:57:17] baby the baby came back to life 12 hours
[1:57:19] dead 12 hours right and when that baby
[1:57:22] come back to life man it just erupted
[1:57:24] just uh you know a revival struck that
[1:57:27] place it was so powerful they that the
[1:57:29] man there was a general that was found
[1:57:32] recent as general was responsible help
[1:57:33] for helping these meetings actually
[1:57:35] happen they're there in Mexico and when
[1:57:38] they found the genophage they say just
[1:57:39] give us some of the testament say man
[1:57:40] this person got here that person got
[1:57:42] here this happened a half said there was
[1:57:44] some of the most powerful meetings there
[1:57:45] once said now the real special thing
[1:57:47] that happened is that brother Branham
[1:57:48] had already left the area I already went
[1:57:51] to another Stevie savor the people had
[1:57:54] no idea that the meetings were over so
[1:57:55] they was still coming to the meetings
[1:57:57] the meetings were over and they're still
[1:58:00] coming he said now you know but but but
[1:58:02] the remarkable remarkable part is that
[1:58:05] when they got there they were still
[1:58:07] being healed meanings were over pop it
[1:58:12] not even there but the angel of the Lord
[1:58:15] was still there and the people were
[1:58:18] still being healed now that that just
[1:58:23] ain't happening everywhere I was just
[1:58:29] thinking on this III hit this and this
[1:58:32] is why Oh Lord just bear with me
[1:58:34] sixth seal sixth seal
[1:58:38] don't panic I know if you know something
[1:58:41] you hear these things and like I said
[1:58:42] you don't hear this everywhere you go
[1:58:44] praise God I understand that but God
[1:58:48] tried something that is trying to get
[1:58:49] something to his people that's what he's
[1:58:51] trying to do but look I heard this in
[1:58:52] sixth seal recently and he said this
[1:58:55] notice but you see the sheet call my
[1:58:59] sheep hear my voice why what is a voice
[1:59:01] I want to tell you what a voice is a
[1:59:05] voice is a spiritual sign a voice is a
[1:59:10] spiritual sign so when we saw these
[1:59:11] things happen in the prophets ministry
[1:59:13] that was the voice of God a spiritual
[1:59:15] sign that was given to the people and
[1:59:18] Jesus said my sheep hear my voice and a
[1:59:22] stranger they won't follow
[1:59:24] oh my listen to this it might be a
[1:59:28] strange doctrine people ain't never
[1:59:30] heard of it but a stranger we won't
[1:59:31] follow we're not following that we
[1:59:33] follow them the voice a man and the
[1:59:35] voice is the voice of God that's in his
[1:59:37] prophet right he says what is a voice I
[1:59:39] want to tell you what a voice is a voice
[1:59:41] as a spiritual sign he said to Moses if
[1:59:43] they won't hear the voice of the first
[1:59:45] time they will hear the voice of the
[1:59:47] second sign my sheep hear my voice when
[1:59:52] these things are supposed to be taking
[1:59:54] place in the last days sheep of God
[1:59:57] recognize that see they recognize it my
[2:00:00] sheep know me see strangers they won't
[2:00:03] follow they won't follow them strangers
[2:00:05] it's got to be a vindicated sign for the
[2:00:08] day and they see it see we got we got
[2:00:12] have been Decatur son and and I just
[2:00:14] I've just got a question you know we
[2:00:19] know Moses was vindicated he threw that
[2:00:22] rock down God vindicated him but when
[2:00:24] they called for flies and lice and
[2:00:26] locusts and everything and you know
[2:00:28] water turn the blood God vindicated a
[2:00:31] man Moses God did it multiple times the
[2:00:35] people knew that God was with Moses
[2:00:37] right and there were many things that
[2:00:39] happen in the prophets message and my
[2:00:41] question is how many times do we need in
[2:00:44] order to hear the voice
[2:00:47] how many times as I got him he said to a
[2:00:51] little fishy I'll give you a life that
[2:00:54] was a sign it has seven aims just come
[2:00:57] from eternity and commissioned him to go
[2:01:00] back east and preach the seven seals and
[2:01:02] and that's what I'm talking about this
[2:01:03] week is a week that those seals were
[2:01:05] preached in 1963 seven angels
[2:01:07] supernaturally come from heaven making
[2:01:10] the face of Jesus Christ and sends him
[2:01:11] back that was a sign in the sky how many
[2:01:14] signs we need before we hear the voice a
[2:01:16] man when he told a man had it right her
[2:01:20] boys gave him spoken word salvation
[2:01:22] whatever had it right one and she could
[2:01:24] have and he gave us word
[2:01:25] salvation how many songs we needed to
[2:01:27] have before we hear the voice well he uh
[2:01:29] and when the pillar of fire that took a
[2:01:32] picture with him in Houston glory to God
[2:01:34] how many signs we needed before we hear
[2:01:36] the voice a man the light shining in the
[2:01:39] room at his birth the church age is
[2:01:41] being drawn on the back wall of the
[2:01:43] church right the first floor the second
[2:01:45] floor the third floor he was vindicated
[2:01:46] I meant I mean multiple times how many
[2:01:50] signs we need before we hear the voice I
[2:01:56] want you to remember the very let cannot
[2:01:58] be the seat I don't care who you are if
[2:02:00] you are elected of God you won't be the
[2:02:02] seat can I've read this this quote out
[2:02:04] of questions and answers on the stairs
[2:02:06] you're gonna hear the sound of Jubilee
[2:02:09] because that's what I heard the sound of
[2:02:12] Jubilee let listen this this is a
[2:02:14] questions and answers out of seals
[2:02:15] listen
[2:02:16] there's a question this is brother
[2:02:19] Branham is it true that every every Jew
[2:02:21] born since Christ King will be safe and
[2:02:25] who are the 144,000 are they to protest
[2:02:29] that it wants to be sealed with the Holy
[2:02:31] Ghost and what is their mission you said
[2:02:33] there's about three questions in the one
[2:02:35] there but in see here the first one is
[2:02:37] is it true that every Jew born since
[2:02:39] Christ that coming to the world is to be
[2:02:42] saved no nothing will be saved only
[2:02:45] those whose names were put on the Lamb's
[2:02:47] Book of Life before the foundation of
[2:02:49] the world Jew or Gentile see that's all
[2:02:52] the book holds that mystery and the book
[2:02:55] is only unfolding it now
[2:02:57] not each one's name but what the mystery
[2:03:00] of the book is while it's calling those
[2:03:03] names Oh glory to God not each one's
[2:03:07] name but what the mystery of the book is
[2:03:10] while it's calling those names you
[2:03:12] understand that now see he goes on say
[2:03:14] the book though say now lavell is to be
[2:03:18] saved
[2:03:18] in the time of this church age that's
[2:03:21] not what the book Stan or almond devil
[2:03:23] or whoever
[2:03:24] knowing don't say that it just shows the
[2:03:27] mystery unfolds the mystery of what the
[2:03:32] thing is but we ourselves by faith
[2:03:35] believe it and that's what I said the
[2:03:38] other night you know this is when we
[2:03:43] talk about John seeing his name right
[2:03:46] over in Revelation 5 John John John
[2:03:49] begin to begin the week jumping in the
[2:03:52] wash jumping in the clock when he saw
[2:03:54] his name he saw his name in the book
[2:03:59] hallelujah take that down for just for a
[2:04:01] second let me just kind of hit this but
[2:04:03] in Revelation 5 John's father's book
[2:04:06] that no man could look upon a man nobody
[2:04:09] could reveal or what was in this book
[2:04:11] right amen in somebody when they look at
[2:04:13] saying he said not nobody can get that
[2:04:16] book than old man comments finish he
[2:04:19] began to look at I don't know what he
[2:04:21] said he say look over here and abraham
[2:04:23] couldn't get the book here and looked
[2:04:25] over there and David and Joseph none of
[2:04:27] them could take the book he said who can
[2:04:30] take this book who could get this and
[2:04:32] loose the seals and he said all of a
[2:04:35] sudden the elder said John weak not
[2:04:37] because the Lion of the tribe of Judah
[2:04:40] has prevailed to take the
[2:04:42] get loose the seals thereof when John's
[2:04:46] attorney looked and he saw this bleeding
[2:04:48] bloody lamb they said lion but he saw a
[2:04:50] limb it was Christ that he was looking
[2:04:52] at he as he had been slain before the
[2:04:55] foundation of the world and when John
[2:04:57] John finally looked and saw that Christ
[2:04:59] had redeemed mankind this book of
[2:05:01] redemption that was in and nobody else
[2:05:04] could take it it was in the hands of God
[2:05:06] only one could take it was Christ
[2:05:08] and when Christ got it John's final
[2:05:10] looked at him saw his name is in the
[2:05:12] Bible say all heaven heard John worship
[2:05:14] oh hell everything on the earth
[2:05:18] everything above the earth everything
[2:05:20] underneath the earth heard John
[2:05:22] worshiping oh my god what was that -
[2:05:26] John that was a release that was a
[2:05:30] jubilee o glory church when you've been
[2:05:35] in bondage event denominational bondage
[2:05:38] for years once you hear Jubilee trumpet
[2:05:41] a man things are not the same for you
[2:05:44] anymore
[2:05:44] how are you somebody see a man only to
[2:05:48] madness and bondage can't appreciate
[2:05:51] that you believe trumpet only the man
[2:05:55] has been locked in Catholicism only the
[2:05:58] woman has been locked in the Baptist
[2:06:00] traditions only the one has been down
[2:06:02] the pinnacle teachings they can
[2:06:04] understand when the Jubilee trumpet
[2:06:06] sounds if your Papa mama things of all
[2:06:09] you understand when the Jubilee trumpet
[2:06:12] sounds and both over in this message win
[2:06:17] for us when the revealing of the real
[2:06:20] good for
[2:06:22] sound oh and I'm not going back here
[2:06:27] back to what I know upon the chance I
[2:06:30] can appreciate my dream that was a
[2:06:39] release for summer it was a relief to
[2:06:42] John a jubilee trumpet sound for him
[2:06:46] they hold the Lion of the tribe of Judah
[2:06:48] hath prevailed brother Branham said when
[2:06:51] John saw his name that's why I said no
[2:06:54] it wasn't that he saw John the Revelator
[2:06:57] that was that's not seeing your name but
[2:07:00] when the revelation begins to unfold
[2:07:04] that was seeing your name and I'm
[2:07:10] preaching to a group of people that see
[2:07:12] their name that's why they can't be
[2:07:16] persuaded that's why they can't be
[2:07:20] pulled out they can't be convinced that
[2:07:22] this is wrong
[2:07:23] these are people that have heard that
[2:07:25] sound of Jubilee
[2:07:28] [Applause]
[2:07:29] hey please gods that's why we rejoice me
[2:07:34] I heard the same sound and out from the
[2:07:37] Baptist octane I stopped holding my ear
[2:07:40] amen and trying to get a further sing my
[2:07:44] sermon just pitch today the people
[2:07:46] respond to that I'll pin the pin across
[2:07:50] as I can I'll pin the Catholics like hey
[2:07:53] open the Lutheran she came up in the
[2:07:56] Methodist she came because she heard the
[2:07:58] sound Oh to believe as soon as they
[2:08:05] began to break this word to you soon as
[2:08:07] they begin I mean you've never heard
[2:08:09] anything like it before in your life but
[2:08:12] soon they begin to break these things in
[2:08:13] there wait a minute wait a minute wait a
[2:08:15] minute wait a minute that was the sound
[2:08:16] of Jubilee and let me tell you my sheep
[2:08:19] know my voice stranger they won't follow
[2:08:25] because the Sheep know the voice of
[2:08:27] Jesus and if you want to find the voice
[2:08:30] of Jesus you have to go back to his word
[2:08:33] Oh glory oh my say that the book don't
[2:08:41] say the book don't say now leave a let's
[2:08:44] be saved and the time of this church a
[2:08:46] Thormann devil or whoever no wait don't
[2:08:49] say that it just shows the mystery the
[2:08:52] book that shows the mystery unfolds the
[2:08:56] mystery of what the thing is but we
[2:08:59] ourselves by hey you know what when you

[2:09:49] seeing their name it was when John saw
[2:09:51] his name it provoked the response I

[2:13:07] long you been here in the church if it's
[2:13:09] gonna be one it's gonna be me oh my god
[2:13:15] all right Church I tell you what when I
[2:13:17] when I heard a man this Jubilee you got
[2:13:21] at the Jubilee a man and I don't have
[2:13:24] time to read all this but over in
[2:13:25] Leviticus 25 you'll find that let me
[2:13:29] just drop a couple of things off and
[2:13:31] I'll slip out of here but when they had
[2:13:35] a Jubilee a man in in Scripture it was a
[2:13:40] national festival for Israel that was
[2:13:43] held on the fiftieth year it was a year
[2:13:46] of release all debts were canceled and
[2:13:50] every prisoner and slave was liberated a
[2:13:54] man and we're declaring a man a year
[2:13:57] Jubilee a sound a jubilee for every one
[2:13:59] that hears this says all the lands in
[2:14:02] the
[2:14:03] whether they had been sold or mortgage
[2:14:05] they were restored to the original
[2:14:06] possessors or the original owner you
[2:14:09] find that Leviticus 25 amen this was a
[2:14:12] joyful event that was proclaimed by the
[2:14:16] sound of a trumpet amen that's how they
[2:14:19] knew when the jubilee had begun because
[2:14:21] they heard the priests sound the trumpet
[2:14:23] right and and he was found that trumpet
[2:14:26] and anytime that trumpet sound it was
[2:14:28] bringing good news hallelujah the person
[2:14:31] that was in bondage knew they'd have to
[2:14:32] be in bondage anymore they didn't owe
[2:14:34] their slave master anything if they were
[2:14:36] working on a project out there maybe
[2:14:39] working in the field as soon as they
[2:14:41] heard the sound of the of the doobly
[2:14:44] trumpet they dropped the rate they
[2:14:45] dropped the hole they drop everything
[2:14:47] I'm out of here
[2:14:48] going back to my original possession
[2:14:50] didn't even have to buy what was theirs
[2:14:53] originally it came back to them just
[2:14:56] because of the jubilee hallelujah God
[2:14:58] God instituted that a man in Israel and
[2:15:02] you know sir it was it was a very
[2:15:03] special moment a very happy day amen
[2:15:07] when people heard the jubilee and I'ma
[2:15:09] tell you when I heard this message that
[2:15:11] was my Jubilee that was good news that
[2:15:15] was that was the gospel that was the
[2:15:17] good news of the gospel being presented
[2:15:19] to me and that was the sound that you
[2:15:21] believe I didn't know my denomination
[2:15:24] nothing and if some of y'all came out of
[2:15:28] the world you didn't know the devil
[2:15:30] nothing just walk out of it leave it
[2:15:33] this is your Mester deal wit la lluvia a
[2:15:37] man if there if the land need to be
[2:15:39] plowed you better start plowing because
[2:15:41] I'm out of here
[2:15:43] praise God but you know what what
[2:15:46] happened there in in Israel is and you
[2:15:50] know when you can talk like that to your
[2:15:51] boss and not worry about him hitting you
[2:15:53] or nothing I'm going see you you can't
[2:15:57] do that man I'm not talk about
[2:16:00] praise the Lord you know anytime I
[2:16:03] people do the happy dance and all that
[2:16:05] no no no you stay right there you need
[2:16:06] that money man what we got but uh but
[2:16:10] but but that's spiritually a man this
[2:16:13] Jubilee was something that people looked
[2:16:15] look forward to and we've a member held
[2:16:18] captive and denomination systems for
[2:16:20] years we were waiting for the sound of
[2:16:22] it you believe that's what we heard and
[2:16:25] I'm gonna tell you again if you've never
[2:16:28] been in bondage you don't you don't know
[2:16:29] what it's like to be free so I'm going
[2:16:32] to tell you something I'm gonna just be
[2:16:33] i'ma just be honest with you I think God
[2:16:35] is allowing to kind of go through
[2:16:37] some things cuz someone would get what
[2:16:39] Egypt was like and some of them they was
[2:16:41] born in the wilderness they didn't even
[2:16:42] know what Egypt was like so when you go
[2:16:45] back to Egypt you're gonna find out what
[2:16:47] it's like and let me tell you something
[2:16:48] Egypt is worse now than it has ever been
[2:16:53] you will find out quickly so where it
[2:16:57] might have took us years to understand
[2:17:00] how wicked Egypt was it took us years to
[2:17:04] get I mean that stuff to get in our
[2:17:06] spirit and like I can't take no more
[2:17:07] this how you gonna be president of the
[2:17:10] doorknob club and you know I mean they
[2:17:12] got committees for everything and they
[2:17:14] and they gonna committee you right on
[2:17:15] out of it huh
[2:17:18] right but a lot of nonsense that
[2:17:20] happened in church politics all over the
[2:17:23] place and it when the Spirit of God
[2:17:25] moving there and I mean it was just it
[2:17:27] was just really really bad right well it
[2:17:31] might have took us years to get fed up
[2:17:33] before we were looking for something
[2:17:34] else and then we were ready for this
[2:17:37] message we were so fed up we were ready
[2:17:40] for the message some of y'all go back a
[2:17:43] man think about where you was at that
[2:17:45] time you were ready for something fresh
[2:17:47] and as soon as you heard it all glory
[2:17:50] that's what I've been looking for so
[2:17:53] some of them may never tasted it like
[2:17:55] that
[2:17:55] but I want to encourage you get as much
[2:17:58] as you can you'll get so fed up and so
[2:18:02] fast you'll keep running you come
[2:18:06] running back

[2:18:28] church when the pastor get to preaching
[2:18:31] real good you know the people do they
[2:18:33] come from the back all over and they

[2:18:52] bringing money and you know don't do the
[2:18:54] spirits show a lot of stuff come from
[2:18:57] club atmospheres let me just put it that
[2:19:00] way

[2:20:23] brought into the church and we just be
[2:20:25] sitting there different laughing and
[2:20:26] giggling and they did the same thing
[2:20:29] that I saw one on YouTube ladies
[2:20:31] shouting and in the church and some man

[2:20:35] because it she had a shout it's sin and
[2:20:42] its sin in the church Laurie got it show
[2:20:47] you where the people be going after they
[2:20:48] leave church or whether it was coming
[2:20:50] from before they came to church it's
[2:20:53] just a routine for them it don't mean
[2:20:56] nothing
[2:20:57] glory to God but God looking for some
[2:21:00] people that's gonna worship in spirit
[2:21:01] and in truth that other stuff date that
[2:21:04] you know that's nonsense
[2:21:05] praise God and say I'm gonna tell you
[2:21:07] I'm glad night all you gotta you won't

[2:21:12] something you going there and they got
[2:21:13] me looking at you to bring some money
[2:21:16] and we ain't bringing the money you
[2:21:19] didn't get nothing yeah I'm getting
[2:21:20] something but uh-huh not but what they
[2:21:25] ain't the way I was taught with what was
[2:21:26] you talk if you don't believe it no more
[2:21:28] right what was you talked
[2:21:34] your actions show that you still believe
[2:21:36] what you were taught see if you're part
[2:21:46] of God you can't get away and if you
[2:21:48] elect you can't be deceived so forget
[2:21:52] about these web sites and stuff that's
[2:21:54] just nonsense this waste of time all
[2:21:56] right let me try to go on here
[2:21:58] the joyful event was proclaimed a win
[2:22:03] that when the priest would go through
[2:22:05] and sound the trumpet and the trumpet
[2:22:07] brought good news right and when we
[2:22:10] heard the gospel preached and the
[2:22:12] fullness of the revelation that God
[2:22:14] wanted us to hear it in that was the
[2:22:15] good news that we heard that's what
[2:22:17] released us gave us amen of freedom to
[2:22:20] leave wherever we were a man we come to
[2:22:23] this truth the other thing about it do
[2:22:25] believe is that they had a seven year
[2:22:27] Sabbath there in Leviticus 25 they had
[2:22:31] every seven years the land would go
[2:22:32] through Sabbath and then every they were
[2:22:34] just seven times seven years the 49th
[2:22:37] year going into the fifty year that
[2:22:39] would be a year of Jubilee but they had
[2:22:41] the seven years of Sabbath and I went
[2:22:43] when they hit a seventy year Sabbath
[2:22:44] they could not sow or reap I want you to
[2:22:48] catch that you could have so or reap in
[2:22:50] the seventh year you couldn't sow or
[2:22:54] reap so if you can't so how you're gonna
[2:22:58] get your food and if the land was
[2:23:01] already produced in you know something
[2:23:04] that you stole the year before but but
[2:23:06] if it grew in that seventh year you
[2:23:08] couldn't reap it you had to leave it
[2:23:10] there well how are you gonna get your
[2:23:12] food
[2:23:15] anybody got that question if you can't
[2:23:18] so I had that question
[2:23:19] you can't sow or reap in the seventh
[2:23:22] year where how are you gonna eat for
[2:23:23] that seventh year let's go to Leviticus
[2:23:26] 25
[2:23:36] Leviticus 25 and I'm gonna start at
[2:23:38] verse 17 you can go back and read all of
[2:23:43] this thing that where you get an
[2:23:44] opportunity but it says here the ye
[2:23:47] shall not therefore oppress one another
[2:23:49] but thou shalt fear that God for I am
[2:23:52] the Lord your God wherefore ye shall do
[2:23:54] my statutes and keep my judgments and do
[2:23:57] them and ye shall dwell my land and
[2:23:59] safety now hear the thing of this when
[2:24:01] God established this law don't sow or
[2:24:04] reap a man in that seventh year
[2:24:06] establish law if you would do what God
[2:24:08] say it do then he would bless you and
[2:24:12] let me tell you that's not just for the
[2:24:14] Jubilee and not not often establish but
[2:24:15] even in your everyday life if you will
[2:24:18] follow the Word of God if you will obey
[2:24:20] God's Word God will bless you God will
[2:24:23] do more than you can even imagine but
[2:24:27] just follow his words glory to God amen
[2:24:31] he says he says verse 18 wherefore ye
[2:24:35] shall do my statutes and keep my
[2:24:37] judgments and do them and ye shall dwell
[2:24:39] my land and safety and the land shall
[2:24:41] yield her fruit and ye shall eat your
[2:24:44] field and dwell therein and safety and
[2:24:47] if you shall sing what shall we eat the
[2:24:51] seventh year behold we shall not sow nor
[2:24:56] gather in our increase so what we gonna
[2:24:59] do in the seventh year verse 21 says
[2:25:01] then I will come man my blessing upon
[2:25:07] you and the sixth year now if you follow
[2:25:10] the Word of God if you're going to be
[2:25:13] obedient to the Word of God if you go to
[2:25:15] brick top first then I will command my
[2:25:19] blessing upon you in the sixth year and
[2:25:22] it shall bring forth fruit for three
[2:25:25] years that's not that's not that's not
[2:25:31] just a double portion that's a true
[2:25:34] proportion if you'll follow God's Word
[2:25:40] and put him first we'll give you a trip
[2:25:43] portion I love that I will command my
[2:25:51] blessing upon you in the six year and it
[2:25:52] shall bring forth fruit for three years
[2:25:55] and ye shall sow the eighth year and eat
[2:25:58] of the old fruit until her fruits come
[2:26:01] in ye shall eat of the old store
[2:26:04] that's some serious provision but these
[2:26:09] are things that happened during Jubilee
[2:26:12] serious provision I mean it was just a
[2:26:16] year just I mean no working can you
[2:26:19] understand that
[2:26:19] I don't have to plow I don't have to do
[2:26:22] nothing I mean just I'm just gonna enjoy
[2:26:23] the fruits of my labor everybody got a
[2:26:26] year off what would you do in your year
[2:26:32] if you have to worry about foods what
[2:26:36] would you do but just think about it
[2:26:39] Church I mean this this is how God
[2:26:41] provides for his people right you just
[2:26:43] worry about getting two weeks or three
[2:26:45] weeks of vacation no got a whole year
[2:26:50] your lights pain yeah all your bills
[2:26:55] caught up the whole year is off and not
[2:27:01] only that when you go back to work in
[2:27:03] the eighth year you still eaten from
[2:27:05] what you got in the sixtieth you top our
[2:27:11] savings
[2:27:17] and this is a savings plan right here
[2:27:21] but these are things that happen in the
[2:27:24] Jubilee glory to God Church I tell you
[2:27:29] what I am I'm grateful y'all y'all bear
[2:27:33] with me I read one more code imma imma

[2:27:37] this this is out of the breech a man
[2:27:39] between the seven churches and seven
[2:27:41] seals but Lord Lord knows this is that
[2:27:43] this is a precious time a man and I know
[2:27:46] for myself I entered this Jubilee I
[2:27:48] heard the sound of and I've been

[2:28:00] isn't and like I said before I said
[2:28:04] again if this ain't that let me keep
[2:28:06] this until that comes a man because most
[2:28:10] people that's telling you you know that
[2:28:12] this thing that they ain't got nowhere
[2:28:14] to go and most of them are saying they
[2:28:16] where I'm just what you've doing what

[2:28:23] don't want that I'll take what I got
[2:28:25] here
[2:28:25] amen look at this this is the breach and
[2:28:29] and what happened here in this
[2:28:30] particular message brother Branham was
[2:28:33] bringing in revelation 5 I was you know
[2:28:37] as I was battling with where to go with
[2:28:39] this sermon a man on today I just kind
[2:28:42] of quickened to me that this was the
[2:28:43] week that he would haven't reached the
[2:28:45] turkey

[2:28:49] ago he would have preached the breach
[2:28:50] right so here we are coming in this
[2:28:52] morning you know with this and I want
[2:28:54] you to notice he's talking about John
[2:28:57] you know seeing that book of redemption
[2:28:59] and when he when he saw his name you
[2:29:02] know on that book Redemption when nobody
[2:29:04] was able to take that book in Revelation
[2:29:06] 5 but he saw the lion or the lamb you
[2:29:09] know pepper but the lion had prevailed
[2:29:11] but when he turned and saw a lot I mean
[2:29:12] saw lamb he knew that it was Christ that
[2:29:15] took that book a man and he's loose the
[2:29:19] seals thereof glory God we have been
[2:29:21] redeemed by the blood
[2:29:22] man look at this the breeches says
[2:29:26] listen what a Jubilee going on when they
[2:29:30] seem that lamb come and take that book
[2:29:32] of redemption the soul screamed out
[2:29:34] we'll get it all everything that elders
[2:29:38] fell down they poured out the prayers of
[2:29:40] the Saints what there was a
[2:29:42] representative kinsman for us they fell
[2:29:45] upon their faces and they sang a song
[2:29:47] said thou art worried that for you were
[2:29:48] slaying watch that and look at these
[2:29:51] angels and I've been held and heard the
[2:29:53] voice of many angels around about the
[2:29:55] throne and the beasts and the elders and
[2:29:57] the number of them was ten thousand
[2:29:59] times ten thousand thousand whoo notice
[2:30:02] staying with a loud voice worthy is the
[2:30:04] Lamb that was slain to receive power and
[2:30:07] riches and wisdom and strength and glow
[2:30:09] on err and glory and blessing what did
[2:30:12] you believe going on in heaven amen when
[2:30:14] the lamb leaves that intercessory box to
[2:30:17] come here to possess his claim you know
[2:30:20] that got next to John he must have saw
[2:30:23] his name broke there when them seals
[2:30:25] broke he must have got real happy listen
[2:30:28] what he said in every creature which is
[2:30:30] in heaven and on the earth and
[2:30:32] underneath the earth such as are in the
[2:30:34] sea and all that in them is in them hurt
[2:30:37] me sick I think blessings honor glory
[2:30:41] power be to him that sits upon the
[2:30:43] throne into the land for ever amen and
[2:30:46] amen and amen
[2:30:47] Oh a four beasts that a man when the
[2:30:50] four and twenty elders fell down and
[2:30:51] worshiped him that lives for ever and
[2:30:53] ever
[2:30:53] talk about a Jubilee talk about a time
[2:30:57] when the lamb walked for see the books
[2:31:00] even sealed in heaven the mysteries are
[2:31:03] say is my name there I don't know I hope
[2:31:06] it is but if it is it was put on the
[2:31:09] book before the foundation of world I
[2:31:10] remember it's not your name and not like
[2:31:13] jacked up that's not what you're going
[2:31:16] to see but as the mystery unfolds that's
[2:31:20] how you know whether your name is there
[2:31:21] and you can say I see my name because I
[2:31:24] see the mystery
[2:31:26] I have spiritual revelation
[2:31:31] I see the mystery so I see my man
[2:31:34] and that's why you can't stop me from
[2:31:36] shouting you can't just I lost my mind I
[2:31:42] lost my mind
[2:31:44] but I did get them out of Christ all
[2:31:48] right see the books even sealed in
[2:31:51] heaven the mysteries are say it's my
[2:31:53] name now I don't know I hope it is but
[2:31:55] if it is it was put on on the book
[2:31:57] before the foundation world but the
[2:31:59] first thing that that represented that
[2:32:02] Redemption come the Lamb that had been
[2:32:04] slain from the foundation world and he
[2:32:06] took the book glory open the Pope and
[2:32:09] tore off the seals and send it down to
[2:32:12] I'm to his seventh angel to reveal it to
[2:32:14] his people
[2:32:15] Oh glory now see when you go back and
[2:32:19] you listen to that you'll find just if
[2:32:21] you read in the Bible it says that the
[2:32:23] lamb took the book or went and actually
[2:32:26] I think revelation 6 talked about the
[2:32:28] lamb opening the seals well in 1963
[2:32:31] brother Branham open a suit so the
[2:32:34] question is how did the lamb open the
[2:32:36] seals and brother Branham open this is
[2:32:37] brother Branham just told us - yes
[2:32:39] he says the lamb he says and he took the
[2:32:43] book glory open the book and tore off
[2:32:46] the seals and sent it down to the earth
[2:32:48] to his to his seventh angel to reveal it
[2:32:51] to his people so the lamb did take the
[2:32:55] book but the lamb took the book open the
[2:32:58] book and sit down to his angel on earth
[2:33:01] to reveal it just people and let me tell
[2:33:04] you the secret things belong them to
[2:33:07] learn our God but would be always
[2:33:11] then they belong on to us and don't try
[2:33:16] to take what Gotham gave me some
[2:33:24] stimulation from revelation there you
[2:33:30] know my what happened screams the shouts
[2:33:33] the hallelujah is the anointed the power
[2:33:36] the glory the manifestation an old John
[2:33:40] who had been standing there
[2:33:41] stemming our brother crying why he said
[2:33:43] everything in heaven everything in earth
[2:33:45] and everything in the sea hurt me holla
[2:33:47] amen
[2:33:49] blessings honor and might and power be
[2:33:52] to him that list forever never talk
[2:33:54] about a happy time when the seals broken
[2:33:57] John must have looked in and seen past
[2:34:00] the curtain of time instead there's John
[2:34:02] oh he was so happy he said everything in
[2:34:06] heaven he must have really cried out
[2:34:08] didn't he everything in having
[2:34:09] everything in earth everything beneath
[2:34:12] the earth every creature and everything
[2:34:14] else heard me saying amen blessing and
[2:34:17] glory and wisdom and power and might and
[2:34:19] riches belong to him amen
[2:34:23] can I just leave y'all something out of
[2:34:27] Revelation one
[2:34:34] George this is is rich and I just enjoy
[2:34:41] fellowship and around it we hit this
[2:34:45] this morning in son to school and just
[2:34:46] bless my heart I probably be good for
[2:34:48] you all to hear too since y'all can't
[2:34:52] come to Sunday school
[2:35:06] revelation 1:1 the revelation of Jesus
[2:35:09] Christ which God gave unto him to show
[2:35:11] unto his servants things which must
[2:35:13] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[2:35:16] signified it by his angel unto his
[2:35:20] servant John thanks sent and signified
[2:35:24] this by his angel revelation 1:1 by his
[2:35:30] angel unto his servant John so John
[2:35:32] became what we call his scribe done
[2:35:35] somebody gave John what to write and
[2:35:38] John began to write it he was a scribe
[2:35:41] verse 2 says who bore who bare record of
[2:35:43] the word of God
[2:35:44] you know the testimony of Jesus Christ
[2:35:46] and of all things that he saw blessed is
[2:35:50] he that readeth and they that hear the
[2:35:54] words of this prophecy and keep those
[2:35:56] things which are written therein for the
[2:35:59] time is at hand so first of all we
[2:36:01] blessed from reading it
[2:36:03] second we blessed by hearing it and
[2:36:06] third we bless for keeping it
[2:36:12] now what we did is I went over because
[2:36:15] if this was sent in verse one it says it
[2:36:17] was decent he sent an angel to his
[2:36:21] servant John he was if there was someone
[2:36:23] sent to John now remember John is caught
[2:36:25] up in a vision okay
[2:36:27] John is in a vision as he's writing the
[2:36:29] book of Revelation he is in a vision and
[2:36:31] not only is he a vision I love the way
[2:36:34] brother Solomon he was in the spirit on
[2:36:35] the Lord's Day the Lord's Day is a day
[2:36:37] of judgment the Lord's Day amen is their
[2:36:41] judgment going back to the beginning of
[2:36:42] my sermon God say before the great and
[2:36:44] terrible day he was gonna send Elijah
[2:36:46] the Prophet John is in the spirit and he
[2:36:49] sees an angel said to him to tell him
[2:36:53] about revelations - angels we can find a
[2:36:56] little bit more about this angel in
[2:36:58] revelation 22 let's read this revelation
[2:37:05] 22 verse 8 let's look at this now in Liu
[2:37:09] Yun I'm coming home now bear with me
[2:37:11] this is not John saw these things and
[2:37:14] heard them and when I heard and seen I
[2:37:17] fell down to worship before the feet of
[2:37:19] the angel which showed me these things
[2:37:22] John saw so much he was ready that
[2:37:24] worship the angel that showed him but
[2:37:27] notice what the angel says in verse 9
[2:37:28] then saith he unto me see thou do it not
[2:37:30] for I am thy fellow-servant and of thy
[2:37:34] brethren the prophets so this angel was
[2:37:39] a perfect I'm other brethren the
[2:37:43] prophets and of them which keep the
[2:37:45] sayings of the book worship God so John
[2:37:48] was ready to worship His Prophet but the
[2:37:51] Prophet said no don't worship Me worship
[2:37:53] God John caught up in the spirit of the
[2:37:56] Lord's Day was talking to an angel
[2:37:58] revealing to him revelation this angel
[2:38:03] happened to be a prophet and if he's
[2:38:04] caught up in the spirit on the Lord's
[2:38:06] Day the Lord's Day is the day of
[2:38:09] judgment and God tells us a corner
[2:38:11] Malachi for that before the great and
[2:38:14] terrible day of the Lord the Lord's Day
[2:38:15] he's going to send us a prophet who you
[2:38:18] think jumps
[2:38:27] well I believe the one he'd be seeing is
[2:38:30] the profit that was promised for the
[2:38:32] last day before Jesus came church wing
[2:38:37] with Helen this wise people's we
[2:38:40] searched the scripture and we know we
[2:38:42] stand
[2:38:43] yeah beware of false Christ's but try to
[2:38:47] find the one real one because before you
[2:38:50] can have a false dollar you got to have
[2:38:52] at least one real dollar I can't spend
