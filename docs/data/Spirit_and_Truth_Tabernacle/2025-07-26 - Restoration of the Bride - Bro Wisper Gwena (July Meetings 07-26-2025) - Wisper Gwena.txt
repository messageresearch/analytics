And I've got a good friend of mine all the way from Australia together with his family. Um just came for the meetings. Amen. Um just so glad that we can all be here to to fellowship with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many have enjoyed the meetings this far? I'm so glad that South Florida has decided to carry on with the vision of brother Wesco. You know, I first came to Florida uh maybe some 20 or so years ago and um I came at the invitation of brother Wesco and just to be back again and see that you you're carrying on with exactly the same vision, it just gives me a lot of joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just appreciate the Lord for that. The first time that we came into Florida, uh we we just fell in love with the place and uh my children, they really loved the place from back then and uh you've attracted them to here now. So, they're now part of uh the Florida team. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh By God's grace, I now have three grandchildren that are born in Florida. &gt;&gt; So that makes Florida home to us. &gt;&gt; You know, there's a pool that comes with these grandchildren. They just pull you to come to where you you you don't even want to come in certain times. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Florida has become second home for us &gt;&gt; by the power of grandchildren. Praise the Lord. Amen. Um let's let's get to the word. I'm going to invite you to stand to your feet. Praise the Lord. Amen. You can follow with me on the projector screen. Um Joel chapter 2. Um we're going to read verse 25. And I'll restore to you the years that the locust had eaten the cankerm and the caterpillar and the palmer. My great army which I sent among you. And then in the book of Revelations chapter 1 verse 10 and 11, I was in the spirit on the Lord's day. And I heard behind me a great voices of a trumpet, saying, I'm Alpha and Omega, the first and the last. And what thou seeest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia, unto Ephesus, and unto Smea, unto Pergamos, and unto The Tyra, unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Leodysia. Amen. &gt;&gt; May God add his blessing to the reading of his word. We may be seated as we bow our heads yet again. Father, we have read your word. We come, Lord, to this sacred part, the part that is beyond man. We can only depend on you, Lord. I pray that you can take over now. Lord, consume my inabilities with your great ability. Father, our weaknesses, hide them in you. Lord, I invite you to just take over from now. Father, we commit all things to thee. May we sit together in them heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Allow me to just take off my jacket. Praise the Lord. I want to take a title tonight and I want to speak on a restoration of the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. And for a subject, I'll be looking at the bride age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet preached a message, the restoration of the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I want to look at it as just the restoration of the bride. &gt;&gt; Let me start by taking a quote on what the prophet said, which is the quotation that was put on the flyer for the meetings. The prophet of God says in paragraph 473, somewhere in the middle there, he says, "That insect started on Luther to kill all the Lutheran branches. It come right over to Wesley and killed all the Wesley branches. But the main part of the tree keeps coming. &gt;&gt; Now notice in the old time when the tree was killed, it was killed when plump to the roots when it killed it back then. But this time because the word is predestinated, there's nothing going to stop it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God said, "I will restore." No matter how much they organize, how much they do this, that or the other, I'm going to restore it. That settles it. &gt;&gt; And that's the prophet saying it. And that settles it for me. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God in the highest. Now here the prophet took the scripture of Joel and showed how the bride tree was attacked by these little rascal insects as he calls them. But God said I will restore. Now the allegory that the prophet used when he preached the message the bride tree he was using the tree amen as the allegory there. But by God's grace, tonight I want to look at the same process but from the point of view of the seven church ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, but before I get into the message, let me start by saying that when God gave us the Bible, he gave us a book like no other. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The Bible is a packed book &gt;&gt; which I believe we will never be able to fully understand. &gt;&gt; We'll never be able to fully comprehend the Bible until we see him face to face. &gt;&gt; When we think we have gone so much into the Bible, then you come to find out we've only scratched the surface. &gt;&gt; We ain't even started to understand the word. You know, when when you've gone through the Bible so many times and then a preacher comes and he takes a scripture from an angle that you have never seen, that's when you realize how much little you know. Now I I'm talking about what happens to me. Because when these men of God stand to preach and I see them taking a scripture and I wonder, wow, was this in the word? And that tells me we only scratched the surface, church. Lord &gt;&gt; and that is when you realize that the Bible is a packed book &gt;&gt; and indeed it is God in letter form. &gt;&gt; Now God took time to detail things in the Bible and there is not a single word that he placed in the Bible that is for spare like you have a spare time. There is not a single word that is in the Bible that is for spare. &gt;&gt; Every word that is placed in the Bible is very intentional. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now when when you look at some Bible translations, they they don't get this. They don't understand this. And you know the way they look at the translations, you can see that they are looking at it from a logical point of view. And yet the Bible is not understood by logic. &gt;&gt; It is understood through revelation. &gt;&gt; Spiritual things are spiritually discerned. &gt;&gt; What do you mean, preacher man? Let me give you an example of a scripture that we all know very well. Malachi chapter 4. The Bible says, "I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers. Now we we we we we understand this very well because this is the foundation of the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; But when you go to other translations like when you look at the good news translation, look at the way they translate verse six, &gt;&gt; he says he will bring fathers and children together again. And they call this the good news translation. That's bad news translation &gt;&gt; because you can see they have missed the revelation so completely. There &gt;&gt; you go to the new century version. It says Elijah will help parents love their children and children love their parents. Sounds like an AI translation, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Sounds like somebody just took the original Hebrew and they threw it into a chatbot and they said, "Please give me a translation that can easily be understood." And AI did its thing. &gt;&gt; AI don't have revelation. &gt;&gt; Revelation is in the hearts of the believers. God help us. So you see when when you're looking at these Bible translations, you see that many of them, they miss important things in the Bible. But we thank God that when the prophet came, he left us with a recommended translation to use. &gt;&gt; How many know the prophet left us with a recommended translation to use? Or let me read what the prophet says. He says, "Here we find now in the Old Testament, there's many words in our New King James Version that seems very strange. But for me, the rest of you, brethren, can teach from any version you want to. But I like the King James. Just seems more like the Bible to me." Not only does he say this in the message Israel in the church, he says, "I'm satisfied to take the King James version for mine. &gt;&gt; It's waved the storms longer than any translation yet." And I just believe it that way. Now, we are followers of Malachi 4. And if you are followers of Malachi 4, then we got to stick with the recommended translation, &gt;&gt; which is the King James translation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, when it comes to the way the Bible is written, words are not just placed anyhow. The Bible lays out certain words because there is a purpose behind it. The prophet of God says, "Now let this be known." Scripture does not play with words. &gt;&gt; Whatever is in the record is there for the anointed eyes to see. It is there for a purpose. &gt;&gt; I pray that there be some anointed eyes in here tonight. Or do I have some anointed eyes in here tonight? He says, "Whatever is in the record is there for the anointed eyes to see. It is there for a purpose. &gt;&gt; So the words that are laid in the Bible, they are laid there for a purpose. Malachi 4 is laid out the way it is laid out because it is distinguishing two Elijah. Now when these people say for parents and children to love one another, they are missing the two Elijah in there. You cannot identify John's ministry and you cannot identify brother Brham's ministry when you say children and parents love one another. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; The Bible is written in order to bring out something important. &gt;&gt; In John 8:58, the Lord Jesus Christ said, "Before Abraham was, I am." Put that into a grammar check. They will say that this is totally wrong. The grammar is not correct. But Jesus was not looking at grammar. Jesus was looking at the word. What was he looking at? He was looking at the God of Moses who when Moses wanted to to know who shall I say has sent me. He said, I am that I am. So what Jesus was saying in John 8:58 was I am the God of Moses. I am the Jehovah of the Old Testament. who is the Jesus Christ of the new. So I am present tense God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God in the highest. When the prophet looks at the serpent seed, the way the words are arranged, the the prophet of God says here since three sons were born from two eggs by Adam, you know positively that one of those three was not the son of Adam. God has recorded this in this exact manner to show us something. &gt;&gt; So the prophet is teaching us here that when things are laid in the Bible, they are laid out in order to bring out something. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; In Revelation chapter 17:9, the Bible tells me that this calls for a mind with wisdom. So when when you're a student of the word, it takes a mind with wisdom. You can't be simple and understand revelation. Can you say amen, somebody? &gt;&gt; And this is not the wisdom of this world. It is the wisdom of God which comes by the Holy Ghost because it's the first of the nine spiritual gifts. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So this calls for a mind that has got wisdom. But yet when you turn around, you also find the Bible says, "Amen, he has hidden these things from the wise and from the prudent, and he has revealed it unto babes such as we would learn." So there is a revelation that comes to babes and that revelation, it comes through the wisdom of the Holy Ghost. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Christ said to you it is given to understand the mysteries of the kingdom. Ain't you glad, church, that to you it is given to understand the mysteries of the kingdom? Ain't you glad, church, that you have an ability within you to catch revelation. You have an ability within you to read in between the lines. You have an ability within you to know that every word that the Bible has got, it is placed for a purpose. It is placed for our anointed eyes to catch something out of it. Hallelujah. Why are you in the message anyhow? It's because God gave you the ability to catch the revelation of this day. You are born with something special within you. &gt;&gt; I want you to look at your neighbor and tell your neighbor, you are born with a special ability. &gt;&gt; That's why you are in here. It is because you are born with an ability to catch the message of your day. The prophet says Moses was born with the equipment within him. How many know the quotation I'm talking about? He says he was born with that equipment within him. You are born with an equipment that is able to decode the message of the hour &gt;&gt; that when you heard Malachi 4, something inside of you echoed and he says that's nothing but the truth. I believe it 100%. So let me say you are blessed. Blessed are your eyes for the things that they see. You are blessed. Or do me a favor and tell your neighbor you are blessed. You don't have to have money in the bank. You don't have to be a rich man to know you are blessed. You just need to know I am called by God and I've been called to understand the message of my day. I am blessed. Or do you believe it tonight? You are blessed. I don't care who is telling you what but God says you are blessed. Blessed are your eyes. Blessed are your earsh. Many prophets of old they inquire diligently. But God said, "Go thy way to Daniel. Go thy way to the prophets of old." But when it came to this day, glory to God, uh God said, "I will allow you to catch the revelation of your day, you are blessed." Oh, give God a hand of praise somebody and just thank him for the blessing that God invested inside of you. Glory to God in the eyes. I think my my monitors have been tweaked down just a little bit. Just keep mine at the same level and deal with the house. &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, by God's grace, I just want to go into some details of scripture. &gt;&gt; How many love the Bible? And today I want to look at the prepositions that are used when letters are written to the church ages. Now in order for you to understand where I'm coming from, you need the King James version. &gt;&gt; Because if you've got another Bible that does not follow the King James version, you might miss what I'm going to talk about. And that's why I started by showing you we need a recommended translation. It is the recommended translation. It is that the storms longer. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is what the prophet of God left us. So can we get into the Bible now? Revelations 1, the Bible says in verse 11, "What thou seeest, write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia." So John was given a clear instruction and the instruction was whatever you see, write in a book and send it unto the seven churches. Then he gets into Revelations chapter 2. And now he begins to write the letters. And when he begins in Revelations chapter 2 verse number one, he writes the letter to the church of Ephesus. But I want you to watch the preposition that the Bible uses there when it comes to Ephesus. It says of Ephesus. And then when we move to smea, it changes the preposition and it says in smea. &gt;&gt; And when it goes to pamos, it uses in pegamos. &gt;&gt; And when it goes to Thotyra, it uses in Thotyra. And then amen. When it goes to sadis, it uses in sadis. And when it goes to Philadelphia, it uses in Philadelphia. But when we go to Laia, he changes it and it brings back to us. Oh, glory to God. Oh, glory to God. Ain't that striking, church? &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; And the question that I ask is God playing with words? No, our God does not play with words. Everything is laid down for a purpose, for anointed eyes to see a revelation. &gt;&gt; Every word is intentional. &gt;&gt; And that's why the Bible in the book of Matthew says, "Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one title shall in no wise pass from the law till it be fulfilled. Now, what is a jot? &gt;&gt; In the Hebrew is called a y &gt;&gt; and it is the smallest letter in the Hebrew language. And that little stretch that you've got there, this one, that's a jot. It looks so small, but it's actually a letter in the Hebrew language. And when they talk of a T2, it is the stroke that is put on a letter in order to distinguish it from another one. And it is an example. You can look at the letters R and D. You see it is constituted of a vertical part. But the bit that is at the top is what they call the stroke. And the way that stroke is put, it distinguishes those two letters. Then God said, "Not one jot, not one title shall pass away." In other words, God is so interested in the detail of the letter. Are you catching something, somebody? Hallelujah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So the words are laid out in order to hide a mystery somewhere. So in God using the prepositions that we find in Revelations chapter 2 and three. Amen. When he says unto the angel of of the church of Ephesus. He's not playing with words. &gt;&gt; Then he comes to the next five ages. Smina it is in. Pamos. It is in &gt;&gt; Thotyra. It is in &gt;&gt; Sardis. It is in &gt;&gt; Philadelphia. It is in. And when it comes to la then it changes and it comes back to off. And not one j shall pass away. Not one t2 shall pass away. Not one preposition shall pass away. Glory to God in the heart. Are you following me this far? &gt;&gt; Now the question that has got to be asked is why? &gt;&gt; Why? And in answering this question why, this is where we are going to see the restoration of the bride. Praise the Lord in the highest. Can we get into it, church? Can we get into it, church? I just love the word. Now I see I have all your attention. Praise God for it. Do me a favor and tell your neighbor, buckle up and sit up straight because you you don't want to miss anything here. Can we get into it now? &gt;&gt; Praise God in the highest. Now when you use the preposition the church of Amen. That tells me that when you get to that church, when you or when you get to that area, when you get into that age, there is only one church. &gt;&gt; So when you're using the preposition of, it is telling me that they can only be one church. Because the moment you say the church of Ephesus, you have excluded the possibility of the existence of any other church. In other words, when you walk into Ephesus and you ask where is the church, nobody is going to ask you a question. They will just tell you, oh, the church is here. Are you with me? because there's only one church in there. &gt;&gt; The same thing when you come to Leia, there's only one church in there. &gt;&gt; But when you go to Sman, Amen. In Sman, the preposition that is used is in. &gt;&gt; In other words, when you get into SMA and you ask somebody where is the church, they will ask you a question. Which one? It's like me walking into West Palm Beach and I'm walking in the streets and I ask a stranger and I say, "Where is the church?" What is the question they are likely to ask me? They will ask me, "Which one?" And I say, "I mean the church." They'll say, "Which one? We got the Roman Catholics here. We got the Presbyterians here. We got the Methodists in here. We got the Pentecostals in here. We got the Assemblies of God in here. We got a message in here. Which one? &gt;&gt; That's when you're using in. So the church in it is telling me that there is more than one church in there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now with God, when God is looking at this, there's only two churches. And the prophet calls it a true vine. and a false vine. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; All churches, no matter who they are, they fit under these two. &gt;&gt; So when the Bible uses the preposition of, the Bible is talking of one church. When the Bible uses the preposition in, the Bible is talking of the two vines that are now in existence. Are you catching it, somebody? Now let's prove this by the Bible. When you get into the book of Revelation chapter 2, the Bible says unto the angel of the church of Ephesus, right? &gt;&gt; Now look at the message. I know thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou cannot spar them which are evil. And it goes on there and he says, "You have tried them that say they are apostles and you have found them liars and is born and is patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted. Nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first life." Now, we know Ephesus was the first church age, and this is the church age that started in AD 53. And we know the messenger was obviously Paul. It was an example church. &gt;&gt; It was a nearly perfect church. &gt;&gt; You look at the message, it is commendation upon commendation. I know thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou cannot bear them which are evil. In other words, there were certain people that were evil that were living in the area. But those that were evil, the church could not suffer them to become part of them. They couldn't bear them &gt;&gt; and they kicked them out of the church. Keep the church pure. &gt;&gt; So the church remained one. &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. &gt;&gt; Thou has tried them that say they are apostles and you have found them liars. Others came and they tried to penetrate into the church and saying we are apostles but they tried them with the message of Paul and they say Paul never said it that way. &gt;&gt; Therefore you are a liar and they kicked them out and they kept the purity of the church. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And thou has born and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted. There's only one thing that you find wrong with the church of Ephesus. Nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love. But I want you to look at the way that scripture is written. It says, "Thou has left thy first love." In other words, at the beginning they heard this love. So if at the beginning they had this love that makes Ephesus a perfect church. &gt;&gt; It was only further down the line that's where they lost the first love. But at the beginning they had the original love &gt;&gt; and now if you're looking at it at the beginning when they had their first love it means that that church age was perfect. Now the prophet when he preached when he taught on this church ages he then drew the pictures of the church ages and when he drew the picture of the Ephesian church age he put a little dark mark at the bottom here. But I give you to understand that the reason why he put that dark mark at the bottom it is because they had now lost &gt;&gt; their first love. But if the prophet had drawn this before they lost their first love, he would have presented it like this. Pure. &gt;&gt; Glory to God in the eyes. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church? &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church? &gt;&gt; Now, Malachi 4 comes to come and restore us back to the hearts of the Pentecostal fathers. Now I ask you, which Pentecostal fathers, are they the ones that had lost their first love? No. God cannot come and restore us back to an era. The restoration is got to be back to perfection. &gt;&gt; So it tells me Ephesus at a certain point was a perfect church age. Ephesus at a certain point produced the Pentecostal fathers that we got to be restored back to. and we can be restored back to something that is an error. Give God a hand of praise somebody. Hallelujah. So if we're going to blow the church age, Amen. of Ephesus, hallelujah. This is the way the church of Ephesus looked at the beginning. Not a single dark mark in it. Not a single blemish that you find in it. Not a single thing that you can point to it. Everything is just running so perfect in that church age. Now if you walked into the church of Ephesus and you asked where is the church and it is looking like this, who will ask you a question? &gt;&gt; They will just point you and say there it is. &gt;&gt; They don't need to know what name it is. The church of Ephesus. It's enough to be able to identify what that church is. But now when you go into sinner, now the preposition that is used is in Revelations chapter 2 unto the angel of the church in sinner. Right? Now look at the message. I know thy works and tribulation and poverty, but thou art rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. So now we have the synagogue of Satan and the prophet of God when he talks about sinner he says these people were saying that they were actually Jews real Jews by birth they were liars they were not Jews by birth and they weren't Jews by religion if all this is true what were they a deceived people who were already part of the church they belong to the false vine. So now there is a true vine and there is a false vine. Are you with me? They were not of the true church but of the false church because God says they were the synagogue of Satan. &gt;&gt; So now you see we have got two vines when you get into and that's why the Bible uses the preposition in. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; So when you walked into Smen and if you wanted to find which one is the church, someone would ask you which one because there is a true vine and there is a small there and there is a false vine. &gt;&gt; Somehow Satan had crept in. Somehow he had now taken root in that church age. But no matter how much the devil had climbed in, but still there was a true vine that was there. &gt;&gt; And you glad church that no matter what the devil does, there will always be a true believer somewhere. I don't care how many people will leave the message, there will always be a true believer somewhere. I don't care how many fine fault with brother Branham, there's always somebody that still believes that prophet. They can say what they will. They can believe the sign whatever they will. But brother, sister, there's always somebody who has been caught with a hook of the message who says, "Give me the message and nothing else." Or do I have somebody that says, "That's me." Oh, that's me. Glory to God in the highest. But you can see there is two vines that are in there. Now we get to Revelations chapter 2. The Bible says in Revelations chapter 2:12 here and to the angel of the church in Pergamas and watch the message. I know thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan sees and thou holdest fast my name and has not denied my faith. So there is Satan's seat somewhere. &gt;&gt; But there is a group that has not denied his name. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But he's also saying I know where Satan dwells. when you go to verse 14. But I have a few things against thee because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balam. Not only do we have those that hold the doctrine of Balum, so has thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicolatans. &gt;&gt; So you can see there is an intermingling of the vines there. So the preposition that the Bible then uses, it uses the preposition in. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God looking at the Pamian churches. He says it was a city of great sin given over to lentious rise of the worship of Eskealup Escalupellius whom they worshiped in the form of a living serpent which was housed and fed in the temple. In this beautiful city of irrigated groves, public walks and parks lived a small group of dedicated believers who were not fooled by the veneer of beauty and above the satanic worship that filled the place. So, praise God, you still find some true believers in there. Then we move to the Titarian church age in the book of Revelations 2:18. unto the angel of the church in Thotyra, I know thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first. So God is commanding this group here. Then he goes to verse 20. Notwithstanding, I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel. &gt;&gt; So now Jezebel is in the church. which call it theirel a prophetess. &gt;&gt; Two vines can clearly be seen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says the name Theotyra it means a dominating female &gt;&gt; speaking of the existence of a Jezebel &gt;&gt; and the prophet tells us that it was in Thayyra that is where the tree was reduced down to its roots. This is when we got into the dark ages. The bride tree looked like it was completely destroyed. But praise be to God, the life that was in there was the life of God. And there is one thing that you can never do. You can never kill God. The life that was in there was a Zoe life and you can never be able to kill Zoe. So Zoe went and hid in the roots. Praise the Lord in the highest. We heard in the morning that the predestinated was in there and he went down to the roots hiding the life of Jesus Christ. Oh glory to God. Oh glory to God. And God in that condition, he spoke and he said, "I will restore." &gt;&gt; That was in Thotyra. Can I move on? &gt;&gt; Then we move to Revelation chapter 3. Unto the angel of the church in Sardis, be watchful and strengthen the things which remain. They are ready to die. For I have not found thy works perfect before God. &gt;&gt; False vine. Thou has a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments. True vine. &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture, church? Then we go to Philadelphia. Verse number seven. To the church in Philadelphia. I know thy works. Behold, I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it. For thou has a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name. &gt;&gt; True vine. Behold, I'll make them of the synagogue of Satan. We say they are Jews and are not, but do lie. False vine. &gt;&gt; So, we can see the two. Amen. In each one of these ages, are you with me? So all the way from Smya until we get to Philadelphia, you can trace these two vines. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The devil playing his tricks. But in the midst of the devil playing his tricks. Amen. Yet God still has a true church that is in there. So that's why God could write a letter unto the angel of the church in in other words God is saying there might be two vines but I still have my people. &gt;&gt; So write a letter to the angel of the church in I have mine in there. &gt;&gt; Glory. So we have the five ages and with the five ages the Bible uses the preposition in and it is showing me the presence of that little rusco insect trying to destroy that bride. Then now we come to Low here. The Bible then switches. Amen. And it takes it to the preposition of &gt;&gt; and I've said when you use the preposition of it means there is one church. &gt;&gt; Oh, somebody says where is he going now? When you use the preposition of, you are speaking of one church. &gt;&gt; Now let's look at the message to love the sea. I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot. I would that thou were cold nor hot. So then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I'll spew thee out of my mouth. Verse 17. Because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing. And knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked. Nothing good said about that church age. &gt;&gt; They think they are rich, but they are poor. &gt;&gt; They are wretched. They are miserable. They are blind. And they are naked. And yet don't know it. They are so bad until God says I'll spew thee out of my mouth. &gt;&gt; So clearly you can see there is only one vine. &gt;&gt; And it is the false vine. &gt;&gt; You go to Laia and you ask can I see the church they will show you one church. They might ever call it Methodist. They might ever call it this and that. But it is all one church. And that one church is a false vine. Oh God help us. Now when the prophet drew the picture of the church ages, when he got to the church age of laia, he drew lower dea and he put a little light at the top there. &gt;&gt; Are you with me church? But yet when you look at the message of the lower to to the lower desians, amen, there is nothing good that is said in there. Zero. In other words, according to the message, Amen. There is no light in lower dea. &gt;&gt; So it means when the prophet drew this, something had taken place. &gt;&gt; But before this took place, if he was to draw the picture of Laia, this is the way Laia would look like totally black. Glory to God in the highest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And to prove that that church age was totally black when the pope visited uh Israel for the first time, the prophet of God says the Lord drew the pictures of the church ages in the skies supernaturally. And he drew it through the solar eclipse, Ephesus, Mana, Paggamos, Thotyra, Sardis, Philadelphia. And those were the only ones that came. And he says, "And when it came to the last one, what did he say?" He says it was a total eclipse. So in other words, when God now drew the picture, he drew the picture and he showed us that there is nothing. There is no light. It is completely dark. It is black. There is no hope at all. &gt;&gt; So I give you to understand when you step into Leia, there's only one church and that one church that is in Leia, it is the false vine. And I want you to watch the way the Bible also phrases it which is different from the church of Ephesus. The Bible says of the church of Ephesus. But when it comes to Leadosia, it doesn't say the church of Leosia. It says the church of the Lordians. In other words, it does not even belong to God. It belongs to the Lordians. God has got nothing good. God has got nothing to do with it. It's not of God. It belongs to the lowerians. Are you with me, church? Are you with me, church? And that's why the Bible says in verse number 20, behold, I stand at the door and I knock. In other words, I'm outside of the church. I'm not part of the church. This has got nothing to do with me. Glory to God in the eyes. Glory to God in the eyes. So when you blow up the church, Amen. of the Lawians, it is a totally black church. There is no hope in Ladicia. Are you with me, church? It is totally dark. There is just nothing in there. There is no hope. There is no light. It is total darkness. &gt;&gt; But I want to say church in that total darkness that is where you and I have got to live. That is where you and I, we've got to raise our children. That is where you and I, we got to find a way of survival in that total darkness. Where is our hope then? Because when I look at that, there is no hope in LA this year. There is nothing that can come out of LA this year. It is totally dark. But where is our hope then? If we have to raise our children in there, if we have to raise our families in there, where is our hope then? I give you to understand the hope. Amen. Was in the promise. Joel chapter 2. And I I will restore. I will restore. I don't care how far the devil has gone, but I will restore. Oh, say amen, somebody. I will restore. Oh, praise be to God. So it might be dark. Hallelujah. It might be all black. But I have a promise in there that I will restore. Oh, praise the Lord. In the highest God is going to turn on the light somehow. So there is going to be a something that will take place in that total darkness. There is a man uh that can turn on the light. Uh God is the man uh that can turn on the light. Uh but God sends a man that can turn on the light. And now I can say behold the man. Behold the man that can turn on the light. Oh come on Florida. Oh come on Florida. Give God a hand or praise somebody. There is a man that can turn on the lights. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God in the highest. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And let me say church of the living God, our God is not a reactive God. Our God is a proactive God. He does not react because the devil has done something. My Bible tells me when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Lord will lift up a standard. &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought exactly how the word is written? He says he will lift up a standard. He will not create a standard. The standard is already in existence. It is somewhere hiding behind something. But when the hour comes, then he lifts up the standard. It was in existence already. &gt;&gt; Before the lowerian age started, the promise of Elijah was already in the Bible. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Our God is not a reactive God. He is a proactive God. God knew that Israel was going to go into famine and he needed to prepare the people. So he sent Joseph into the land of Egypt way before the famine struck. Our God is not a reactive God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God knew there was coming a Hmon who would want to exterminate the Jews. So God uh he caused a beautiful baby to be born by the name Esther. Oh, glory to God. And by the time Hmon rises, Esther is already in the palace. As a solution to the Hmon plot, I'm saying our God is not a reactive God. Our God is a proactive God. God knew you will be born in sin. you will be sheep in iniquity. So he provided a lamb before the foundation of the world. Before the devil got you to sin, God had already provided a lamb for you. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God knew the devil would throw a sickness on you. What did he do? He said by his stripes you are healed. So let me tell you, your sickness came amen after the promise. Well, I got some bad news for the devil. I got some bad news for the devil. He came too late. You are God's healed daughter. You are God's healed son. You were already healed before the devil came in. Can you say amen? Our God is a proactive God. He provided his stripes. or right now, right here. If you are sick, you can stand up and you can jump and you can say I am well. Let the sick say, "I am healed." Let the poor say, "I am rich." Let the weak say, "I am strong." Let somebody praise the Lord. As you praise the Lord, the devil is coming down. Uh oh, come on, church of the living God. Uh you are already healed. You are God's healed daughter who the devil is trying to make sick. You are God's healed son who the devil is trying to make sick. Come on, wake up somebody. Give God a hand of praise. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So our God is a proactive God. Can you say amen? Can you say amen? So before Leodia had gone into total darkness, God had already provided the light. Amen. The age of Leia, it started in 1906, 3 years into the age of Laia. What did God do? He sent down the pillar of fire in the hilly plains of Kentucky. There was a boy that was born. Uh a pillar of fire came down. Uh there is a man that can turn on the light. There is a light that can light up lower. Oh, glory to God in the highest. Ain't you glad church that we have a message that is a supernatural message. We have a message that is a packed message. So a mystery unfolded in that little cave in there. But the pillar of fire came down 1950. Then God said, "I will now display the light that can change things in LEA to the rest of the world." And he allowed his prophet to be taken a picture. Oh, give God a hand of praise. Now I repeat, you are blessed. I repeat, you are blessed. Blessed are your eyes. Oh, I'm looking for somebody that believes it here. You are blessed &gt;&gt; for you to be able to see this great mystery of Elijah. You are blessed. &gt;&gt; Do me a favor and tell your neighbor, God bless you. Blessed daughter of God. God bless you, son of God. You are thoroughly, thoroughly blessed. You are not here by accident. You didn't come here by accident. The Holy Ghost laid you here. You are blessed. There is an equipment that is inside of you that is able to decode the message of your day. You are blessed. Oh, I don't care how much money you don't have. I don't care how much your boss is persecuting at your word work. You are blessed. I don't care how much what is in your home. You are blessed. Oh, somebody shout I'm blessed. I'm blessed. I'm blessed. As you shout, I'm blessed. Let the blessings come on you. Let the blessings come on you. Receive your blessing. Receive your blessing. Come on, church of the living God. You are blessed. Oh, glory to God in the highest. I'm going to say it until you believe it. I'm going to say it until you feel it. I'm going to say it until you know you are thoroughly, thoroughly blessed. for you to be in the message of the hour. It's not an accident. Uh it's a designed program of God. Your name is called blessing. You attract God's blessings. I don't care how much the devil is trying to throw at you. One of these fine days, things are going to change because you are blessed. You might as well give that devil a warning right now and tell the old man devil, "My blessings are coming." Uh, because I am God's blessed son. I'm God's blessed daughter. I am blessed. You can start to thank God before anything happens because it's going to come your way. The devil is a liar. You are blessed. Oh, glory to God. Oh, glory to God. Yes, I am blessed. Yes, I am blessed. I don't care how many enemies come against you. But brother, when the blessing of God begins to speak, you will know that you are blessed. &gt;&gt; Why are you blessed? Because you come out of an age where there was no hope. When it was totally dark in Leodia, then God because of the light, he turns on the light and he says, "Now I change the picture." Who is changing the picture? It is you and I. We are the ones that are in the top there. And what does God then say? He says this, "Now I will not call it less. I now call this the bride age. So you are not related this year. You are living in another age. It is called the bride age because there is no hope in Leot here. There is nothing good said about Leos here. But when it comes to the bride age, there is everything good that is said about the bride age. Can you say amen? Can you say amen? Can you say amen? Shout amen somebody. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. The prophet of God then goes on and he says this is not a Pentecostal age. This is the latter day age. This is the bride age. This is the evening light. Woo. To take away the darkness out of Leia. This is the evening light. This is when Malachi 4 must be fulfilled to follow God's pattern. This is Luke 17:30 to be fulfilled. This is the second and Jeremiah and all the rest of them that Joah has spoke of these days. This is that day I have heard, Lord, it was coming, but now I see it with my eye. Oh, how many can say I see it? How many can say I see it or shout I see it. I see it with my eye. He goes on and he says hallelujah. The word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work for this day. No say that was for Pentecost. This is for the bride. Going home of the bride. We got something different. The Pentecost house represented that again. We are in the bride age. Somebody shout amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody shout amen. &gt;&gt; Now I can say arise and shine for thy light has come. You see when you were in darkness you were in bondage. And when you are in bondage you are kind of like under slavery. But when your light then comes praise God in the highest brother sister slavery days are over. The prophet tells me that when slavery was abolished in America, &gt;&gt; amen, that they were told that the emancipation proclamation was going to be on such and such a day. &gt;&gt; And then that day came, we had some people that climbed right on top of the mountain and they went all the way up. The weak came a little lower and the weaker came a little lower and the weakest were in the valley. But the ones that were on top of the mountain, when they saw the sun rise, they shouted, "We are free." Others were not yet seeing the light, but they heard the message and they echoed, "We are free." And it went down, "We are free." Or is there somebody that shouts, "We are free." Is there somebody that shouts, "We are free." Shout, "I'm free." I'm free. I am free. Let your neighbor be anointed with your proclamation of your freedom. Shout again. I am free. I'm free from bondage. I'm free from condemnation. I'm free from death. I'm free from persecution. I'm free across the board. You are free. I said you are free. Give God a hand of praise for your freedom. You are free. Oh, glory to God in the eyes. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. The prophet says, "We are not living in a Pentecostal age. We are living in another age. We are not living in the Methodist age. We are living in another age. We are living on up here to the bride age." And I like the phraseiology on up here. Where? Take me to the picture. We are living on up here. &gt;&gt; Oh, do you see where you belong? &gt;&gt; Do you see where you belong? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are living on up here. The calling of the church and getting it together for the rapture. That's the age that we are living in. To my honest opinion, that's exactly the truth. Now let me move on and say this bride age is not another age &gt;&gt; as in an eighth age &gt;&gt; because there are only seven ages. &gt;&gt; So this bride age is an age within an age. &gt;&gt; Come on church of God. It's an age within an age. Somebody says, "Hey, where do we get this in the types?" I can ask you the question. In Egypt, there was a place that was called Gan. Where was Goshan? Gosh was not in another country. It was within Egypt. But when plagues were falling in Egypt, in Gosan there was not a single plague. When frogs were falling in Egypt, in Gosan there was not a single frog. When there was lice in Egypt, not a single lice was found in Gion. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; When there were flies everywhere, not one came into gion. When the water turned into blood, the waters of gion, they became pure. Somebody woke up that day and he says, "The water just tastes so sweet today. I wonder what is going on." God showing that I have put a difference. Oh, glory to God in the highest. Oh, glory to God in the highest. What happened in Gosan? What is it that secured gosh? There was a man there that could turn on the light. And that man was the prophet Moses. He turned on the light and he says, "Not in Gion." Now, we have received a prophet like unto Moses. And because we have received a prophet like unto Moses, we have a right to declare a goshion. Or did you hear what I said? I said we have a right to declare a goshion because we believe the word. We can declare a goshion also. Before I close, I want us to declare a goshion to the bride of Jesus Christ. What happens in Egypt cannot happen in gan. What happens in your neighbor's house cannot happen in your house. What happens to your neighbor's family cannot happen to your family. When they get fired there, you can't get fired because you are in gosh. I want to declare goshion here. I want to declare goshion here. I don't care what the devil has tried to do, but I'm here to say that devil is a liar. He has deceived you. But now the word is waking you up. The word is telling you you are in gion. In gionh there is no suffering. I refuse. I say there is no suffering in gion. Are you hearing me somebody? Are you hearing me somebody? There is no suffering in gosh. God is going to put a difference. Exodus chapter 11, the Bible says, "And there shall be a cry throughout the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like anymore. But against any of the children of Israel, shall not a dog move his stand against men or beast, that you may know that the Lord God put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel." Oh, you are spiritual Israel. There is a difference that God has got to put on you. No dog shall bark at you. Somebody says, "What dog are you talking about?" When Jesus came, he spoke to the Syphenician woman. And he says, "It is not meant for me to give the children's bread unto the dogs." Who were the dogs? Those who were not in the commonwealth of God. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church? So not a dog shall bark at you. I don't care. Your boss is not a believer. &gt;&gt; As long as he's not a believer, he can't back against you. Go in your secret corner and say, "I condemn this. No weapon that is formed against me shall prosper. Every tongue that shall be spoken against me, I shall condemn it. This is the heritage of the children of the Lord. Do you know your inheritance? Oh, let us declare goshion in here. Let us declare goshion in here. Every sick person must be healed right now. You came with blood pressure, let it go down. You came not being able to walk, start walking now. You came with a desire. I give you your heart's desire in the name of Jesus Christ. Receive it right now. Oh, I believe in the power of the word. I believe that God can do something for you right now. I can declare situations are changing. Lives are changing. God is already visiting somebody. Somebody's getting touched right now. If you feel a touch, don't be quick to think it is your brother. It might just be an angelic touch. Your theophony might just be touching you to provide healing for you tonight. Can you say amen somebody? Can you say amen somebody? Right now, right here, there is a caution that we are creating. We are banishing all demons from here. We declaring this place a no-fly zone for devils. So every disease out, every problem out, every situation out. Oh, let's give the devil a notice, somebody. Let's give the devil a notice, somebody. I don't know how many minutes notice you want to give the devil. Do you want to give him 5 minutes? &gt;&gt; Do you want to give him 3 minutes? &gt;&gt; Do you want to give him one minute? &gt;&gt; No. Even now get out of this place. I declare now receive your healing. Receive your baby. Receive your heart as desire. You are in goshion. I will restore. Says the Lord. Now let me say to you this church, if God could restore us as the bride, why can't he restore what you lost? Why can't he restore your employment? Why can't he restore your home? You are already a candidate for restoration because you have been restored as the bride. So restoration is your second name. I said restoration is your second name. I am restoration. I am restoration. So tell the old man devil, rejoice not my enemy when I shall fall because I shall rise, my name is restoration. Don't laugh at me when I'm downh because one of the fine days you shall find me at the top. And you wonder how did he make it? Restoration. Restoration. Oh hallelujah. Praise the Lord. I will restore. Thus says the Lord. The yes, the yes, the yes. You have been losing for too long. But God is going to pay back. When God pays back, he pays back with interest. You heard it in the morning. When Job lost, he lost everything. But when he started coming back, it didn't just come back. It came double fold. It came double double. Can you say amen? Double for your trouble. I declare this evening, receive double for your trouble. I'll never forget a message that brother Jack preached when he came to our church one of the Easter meetings and he says, "The devil stole your childh when they are to be restored. They're coming back double because I'm hooking the other one and I'm winning both of them. Or let me say to sister right, receive your children right now. Receive your children right now. They are coming back. The devil has not taken any. He is a liar. Claim back what the devil stole from you. Your marriage is down. I will restore. Your finances are down. I will restore. Your family is down. I will restore. Whatever the situation is, I will restore. Oh, come on, praise God, somebody. Come on, praise God, somebody. Come on, praise God, somebody. Thank God for your restoration. I'm finished now. I'm going to give you just a few minutes to thank God for your restoration. This is restoration. I will restore. Thank God for your restoration. Whatever was stolen from you is coming back. Or as you are thanking him right now, he's coming back. I said he's coming back. You lost the joy of your salvation. He's coming back. You lost the baptism of the Holy Ghost. He's coming back. I said he's coming back. is coming back. He's coming back to somebody. He's coming back. The presence of the Lord is in this place. He's coming back. The devil is a liar. He's coming back. Oh, thank God for what is coming back. Oh, give him some praise tonight. Give him some praise tonight. He's coming back. God bless you, church. He's coming back. It's a restoration time. Brother Jack, you can come forward. He's coming back. God bless you. He's coming back. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God in the highest. Oh, give him some praise, somebody. Shout hallelujah. Shout hallelujah. Shout's coming back. Shout restoration is mine. Oh hallelujah. Thank God for restoration. Thank God for these meetings. It's coming back. God bless you, brother. It's coming back. I'm finished. God bless you. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Father. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Don't leave here empty-handed, church. The presence of the Lord is here to give you everything you have need of. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Blessed be the name of the Lord. My God. I'm reminded of Brother Random telling the story. He said the they went over to England looking for the Welsh Revival and they happened to run into a police officer and they began to talk to him to see if he could give directions as to where they could find the Welsh Revival. And when they asked for directions, the police officer responded and said, "Uh, I don't I can't send you to a place, but I can tell you where it is. I am the Welsh Revival." And if somebody's looking for restoration, they ought to be able to look right into your eyes. Amen. And get an answer from you tonight that you are the restoration. You don't have to look any further. Praise God. Amen. You are the restoration tonight. I tell you the truth. I thank God for the words. It's something about the word that sets us free. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You saw how brother Whisperer just put the the pictures there to show, you know, it was darkness and Leodysa, but we're not Leodysans. We're the bride. And the prophet just put a little slither of light there representing you. Before you even knew what the picture was all about, he was representing you. In this dark age, there was a promise that was laying in the roots. And we are manifesting that promise. I'll restore saith the Lord. I think it's time to shout. I I think it's time to praise God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you feel a little bit confined, I want to invite you to get out of your seats. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let's just worship the Lord just a little bit. &gt;&gt; Because he's worthy to be praised. We're free tonight. Said we're free tonight. And he who the son sets free &gt;&gt; is free indeed. Hallelujah. Come on, somebody put those hands together tonight. Hey, brother Elijah. Come on. Hey, y'all ready? Here we go. Oh, I want to clap my hands louder than before. Come on. I want to sing louder than before. Oh, &gt;&gt; I want to jump higher. I want to scream louder, louder. We're singing freedom. Freom freedom.

Before y'all go there cuz M get yourself ready. Amen. M get yourself ready. A couple things I just need to announce. First of all, uh those of you that have fans, uh just make sure you give the fans back as you're going out of the doors so we can have them for tomorrow, uh if we need them. We hope that the air conditioning be up and running with no issues. But uh just make sure you give them to the brothers at the door as you are exiting. Amen. The other thing I wanted to do now, uh, as you know, it's always my secret to keep who the next preacher is, and I'm going to keep that one. You got to come and see. However, I'll give you, Amen, a revelation that on tomorrow night, the preacher that preached tonight will be preaching again on tomorrow night. Hallelujah. Now, I told y'all the Lord made you a promise. God told you that you're going to eat &gt;&gt; in plenty. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And be satisfied. Does God keep his word? &gt;&gt; And if he'll keep that word, he'll keep every word he spoke to you. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Just hold on and don't give up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's have a word of prayer as we prepare to leave. But those of you that want to stay in fellowship a little bit, you're welcome to do that. Do so. We do have food trucks outside and uh you can get food right here. So, you can have some fellowship. I think we can be on the grounds until about midnight. So, uh please enjoy the fellowship. Let's have a word of prayer. Amen. As they get ready to sing this song. Father, we thank you for all that you have done in this place. We have been edified by the word of God. The prophet told us that once the bride recognizes who she is, then the rapture would go. And we thank you that Lord, the revelation was brought, just watch how it dovetail with the sermon uh this morning. Oh God, we just appreciate what we see you doing. Amen. In the ministry, it's the mind of God flowing through the ministry. And we thank you, Father, thus far for all that has happened. We know as we prepare for service in the morning, God, that you would just be with us in another in another uh special way. And God, we pray for all the other churches that would have service also in the morning that you would just move by your spirit, Lord, in every local congregation. We give you all the honor, all the glory, and all the praise as we leave this place, but not your presence. It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where's Brother Lamman at? &gt;&gt; It's right here. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; If &gt;&gt; if you want to be dismissed, you're welcome to be dismissed.
