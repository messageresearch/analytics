[1:07:24] McAllen drew mine my heart tore some
[1:07:27] trying to do a weekend like this
[1:07:29] there's just started this work about
[1:07:31] three years ago and he was living
[1:07:36] and I was I was asking him about how did
[1:07:40] he get there to Austin he was living in
[1:07:43] Atlanta and
[1:07:45] and somehow he told me what happened was
[1:07:47] that he was looking for some equipment
[1:07:51] he wanted to purchase
[1:07:54] Craigslist some saw the website so
[1:07:58] people say we got this equipment that
[1:07:59] was selling
[1:08:00] [Music]
[1:08:04] give me the deal
[1:08:05] [Music]
[1:08:07] you contact them singing yeah yeah we'll
[1:08:08] have a great scene we got some other
[1:08:10] stuff too everybody sailing
[1:08:12] we want to just sum
[1:08:15] just come with a little extra money
[1:08:16] booth but would make a real good deal so
[1:08:19] he was excited about it
[1:08:21] we went to go buy this equipment
[1:08:24] big setup and what it was was these guys
[1:08:28] they knew exactly how much money you'd
[1:08:30] be bringing so when they got you to a
[1:08:33] place where they wanted to where they
[1:08:34] were supposedly the equipment was then
[1:08:37] they would rob you and many people were
[1:08:39] gone and be robbed and often times of
[1:08:42] being killed here at that location but
[1:08:46] for some reason it took all this money
[1:08:48] and they took his wallet and got his
[1:08:50] address on it but they didn't kill him
[1:08:52] they didn't kill him and and by not
[1:08:54] killing him then they start sticking out
[1:08:57] his house right they're coming to
[1:08:59] Southeast I gotta get out of Atlanta I
[1:09:02] gotta leave as fast as I can and
[1:09:05] didn't know where to go when somehow the
[1:09:06] Lord opened the door for him to go to
[1:09:08] Austin Texas and he ended up repulsive
[1:09:11] and the Lord has raised up by a working
[1:09:13] me and as I was just listening to his
[1:09:16] testimony and how protecting him from
[1:09:21] danger you know
[1:09:23] tremendous
[1:09:25] provision by God
[1:09:27] vadas struck my heart the sermon your
[1:09:32] purpose is your protection
[1:09:35] [Music]
[1:09:39] and I was listening to his Tesla Seth I
[1:09:41] feel like I'm supposed to preach that in
[1:09:43] Austin their purpose is your protection
[1:09:45] no matter what the devil has planned
[1:09:47] against you now what he's tried a man
[1:09:50] against you I mean you can be at
[1:09:52] gunpoint but if you got purpose with God
[1:09:54] it's gonna be your protection
[1:09:57] man God will turn the gun the guns away
[1:09:59] God will turn the cause away just trying
[1:10:02] to hit you somebody else should have
[1:10:03] died a long time ago he was in an
[1:10:06] accident and you should have died you
[1:10:07] you're not supposed to be here lifting
[1:10:09] your hands you not supposed to be here
[1:10:12] raising your voice
[1:10:13] but God protected - and your purpose

[1:10:42] devil not today Satan
[1:10:45] today you can't do that today praise God
[1:10:48] a man many times in our life his purpose
[1:10:54] for us has been our protection

[1:22:42] you
[1:22:43] shall we take our Bible if you can hit
[1:22:50] on a little Scripture
[1:22:55] Romans chapter in verse 22 and I give a
[1:22:58] I don't know brother whose way was able
[1:23:00] to give the flash drive I want to read
[1:23:06] from Romans 8:1 to - I want to read from
[1:23:10] the King James and also the lamb
[1:23:11] salvation because I want to pick
[1:23:13] something from the lamb salvation so if
[1:23:15] you can if is if it's that it can
[1:23:17] protect it from if not I read from here
[1:23:20] Romans chapter 8 verse 1 - - I read from
[1:23:23] the irregular King James ok we have here
[1:23:26] the Lampson say that there's the
[1:23:28] therefore no condemnation to them who
[1:23:30] walk in the flesh
[1:23:31] after the spirit of Jesus Christ there
[1:23:35] is therefore no condemnation to them who
[1:23:38] walk in the flesh after the spirit of
[1:23:41] Jesus Christ for the law of the spirit
[1:23:43] of life which is in Jesus Christ has
[1:23:45] made you or me free from the law of sin
[1:23:48] and death
[1:23:48] that is a lamb sir then our reblog King
[1:23:51] James goes there is therefore now no
[1:23:53] condemnation to them which are in Jesus
[1:23:55] Christ who walk not after the flesh but
[1:23:58] after the spirit for the law of the
[1:24:01] spirit of life in Christ Christ Jesus
[1:24:03] has made me free from the law of sin and
[1:24:05] death not the first verse if you look at
[1:24:08] it lumps out you might take your seat
[1:24:10] please be seated
[1:24:11] god bless you if you look at the lamps I
[1:24:14] loose contradictory lamps I said who
[1:24:17] walk in the flesh after the spirit then
[1:24:19] ki Jameson who walked in in the in the
[1:24:22] spirit not after the flesh now lambda
[1:24:25] was a Jewish person the bat was a Jewish
[1:24:28] Bible and so he was using in in we walk
[1:24:31] in the flesh this is the flesh system
[1:24:32] elementary carry but we know we don't
[1:24:35] walk after their cosmos the order of the
[1:24:38] flesh amen
[1:24:40] do we walk in this spirit my flesh is
[1:24:43] not broken taking away all my flesh I
[1:24:46] have my assistant element you have your
[1:24:47] head your foot you don't read
[1:24:49] so now he broke it more than that we
[1:24:52] walk in the flesh
[1:24:53] yes in this is the element but not after
[1:24:56] the cosmos of the world we walk after
[1:24:58] the ordinance of make ascetic of Jesus
[1:25:01] Christ the spirit in us he's the one who
[1:25:04] pulls the flesh along amen glory
[1:25:08] hallelujah
[1:25:08] but then the kingdom said that we walk
[1:25:10] not we work in Christ but not after the
[1:25:14] flesh in other words King James was
[1:25:15] using the flesh to type the cosmos the
[1:25:18] order of the world we don't walk after
[1:25:20] their ungodliness but we walk after
[1:25:22] Christ which is the symptom but then the
[1:25:24] lumps are making more cleanly because we
[1:25:26] work so in the flesh so the flesh is
[1:25:29] important to God amen when God calls you
[1:25:32] will die but it doesn't mean this flesh
[1:25:34] died you still have your flesh you shall
[1:25:38] have your system element the Lord
[1:25:39] rearranged and a lot transform it amen
[1:25:42] you don't throw your flesh sure we don't
[1:25:44] put your flesh in a casket you become a
[1:25:46] few funny made you soon need this flesh
[1:25:49] just like butter Jack say that so often
[1:25:51] eventually be living here but God save
[1:25:53] our flesh through a dangerous accident
[1:25:56] through an infection through a disease
[1:25:59] through a demonic attack through
[1:26:01] whatever witchcraft the lost in this
[1:26:04] flesh because the Lord has used for this
[1:26:06] flesh as well amen so we want to pick a
[1:26:10] subject be sensitive to the inner man be
[1:26:15] sensitive to the inner man let the flesh
[1:26:18] be sensitive to the inner man this
[1:26:21] someone the low place on my heart about
[1:26:24] from more than five months ago before I
[1:26:26] went to Mexico and a missionary with
[1:26:27] brother Josue and I keep praying about
[1:26:30] it and I keep praying about it and
[1:26:32] brother Jack came when I came back it's
[1:26:35] you know it's the women want us none be
[1:26:36] better when you are pregnant you cannot
[1:26:39] shake away from your pregnancy you can
[1:26:41] go to sleep so tell me when to wake up
[1:26:43] is it's a problem you have to tell
[1:26:44] yourself in a way your sleep probably is
[1:26:46] not normal maybe you cannot sleep on
[1:26:48] your stomach I'm not sure you mother's
[1:26:50] can tell me better so on so you deliver
[1:26:53] you are not really really free
[1:26:55] Amen when you are pregnant and when to
[1:26:58] look for something on your heart you are
[1:27:00] not free sometime I'm driving that
[1:27:02] someone come right before me when I get
[1:27:04] away from before it's just right
[1:27:05] something before me and it's just like
[1:27:08] Lord whatever your world lets someone be
[1:27:10] free that I'll be free and their brother
[1:27:13] Jack comes about two months ago when you

[1:31:03] contrast to build a positive contrast in

[1:31:11] just by his thoughts he didn't need to
[1:31:13] become a human being to die to be strip
[1:31:16] naked to suffer but he wanted to be part

[1:31:45] for every one of you what are you a
[1:31:48] young old you a brother sister you are

[1:31:55] a purpose specific for you and that
[1:31:58] purpose is coded in your hearts amen it
[1:32:02] doesn't matter you a child goddess
[1:32:03] please something in you that you are
[1:32:05] sensitive that you are not like the
[1:32:08] other people you might be in school with
[1:32:09] them you might be in the neighborhood
[1:32:11] with them but a lot has made you
[1:32:13] different and you are separated you for
[1:32:16] a purpose I want to read a little quotes
[1:32:18] here
[1:32:19] Redemption comes with price I don't know
[1:32:21] if you have the slice or it's in the
[1:32:23] power of transformation can go down to
[1:32:25] Redemption comes with price if you have
[1:32:28] it is 1965 65 - 10 31 M power of
[1:32:34] redemption paragraph 78
[1:32:38] it says our redemption wasn't a chip in
[1:32:42] our redemption wasn't a chieftain it was
[1:32:46] the son of God had to die for us see
[1:32:49] things of value come of great price
[1:32:53] things of value come comes with great
[1:32:59] price Amen you can go to a good wall and
[1:33:03] just go and get a maybe a share dress
[1:33:07] for me three dollars but then you can't
[1:33:10] go to missus and get a brand-new clothes
[1:33:14] with three dollars they will look in
[1:33:15] your face you can't do that it doesn't
[1:33:19] happen so if you want to let's say dress
[1:33:22] from Macy's then you gotta prepare got
[1:33:24] your purse or your wallet load it
[1:33:25] because you're gonna look into maybe
[1:33:27] eighty dollars fifty dollars something
[1:33:29] around our price or even more because
[1:33:31] it's got value amen
[1:33:33] goodwill somebody just donated to them
[1:33:35] somebody doesn't what is clothes I know
[1:33:37] you guys can take it and sell whatever
[1:33:39] you want to do with it so they can sell
[1:33:40] it for a dollar to five ten dollars but
[1:33:43] then if you go to Goodwill or if you
[1:33:44] want a designer clothes then you have to
[1:33:46] what plea the price for it so our
[1:33:49] redemption that is why God himself he
[1:33:51] wanted to show is that not that it could
[1:33:53] have serviced by barometer that you
[1:33:55] could have attended the light they want
[1:33:57] to preach by God ordained man that you
[1:33:59] raise from the cradle they went through
[1:34:02] all the suffering to preach the gospel
[1:34:04] Jesus could have serious without coming
[1:34:07] to diet but is something that has a
[1:34:09] value so he has to pay a price by coming
[1:34:12] to die amen so now he said our
[1:34:14] Redemption it's not cheap to bring the
[1:34:17] messin up around speaking paragraph 79
[1:34:19] to bring the message it wasn't easy
[1:34:20] see I had to forsake everything that was
[1:34:23] dear to me even my own people everybody
[1:34:26] but you see the value of it is it is to
[1:34:29] do the will of God and to do that which
[1:34:32] knowing that something you mean when
[1:34:34] they used to say well there was going to
[1:34:36] put me away
[1:34:37] I lost my mind thought we thought I lost
[1:34:39] my mind baptizing in the name of Jesus
[1:34:42] Christ contrary to the church now it's
[1:34:45] not is nothing strange denomination
[1:34:48] people baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:34:49] Christ but at that time the thought is
[1:34:51] lost his mind
[1:34:52] how can you baptize in the name of Jesus
[1:34:53] Christ when everybody's baptized name of
[1:34:55] God the Father God the Son God the Holy
[1:34:57] Spirit where did you get his trained dog
[1:34:59] friends from and yes it's in the Bible
[1:35:01] but because over the years the devil has
[1:35:03] wiped the blinded people with a
[1:35:07] Trinitarian doctrine when the truth was
[1:35:09] presented to them they thought it was in
[1:35:11] the truth when you hear a lie
[1:35:14] continuously you perceived a lie as
[1:35:16] truth and when the truth come you think
[1:35:18] that is a lie because it's so foreign
[1:35:20] and strained to you
[1:35:21] Amen so that was the time said they said
[1:35:24] he's crazy but see no matter what they
[1:35:27] see there's something that's a purpose
[1:35:29] for vertebra ham so it doesn't matter
[1:35:30] how rejected he was he stood on his
[1:35:33] ground he stood on the Holy Ghost ground
[1:35:34] he was sensitive to the inner man the
[1:35:37] Holy Ghost in him amen so sometime not
[1:35:40] everybody's going to love you for being
[1:35:41] who you are for being a son or daughter
[1:35:44] of God but you have to be sensitive for
[1:35:46] your calling and your purpose on earth
[1:35:48] amen
[1:35:49] not everybody's going to say you are
[1:35:51] good you look good people make smack
[1:35:54] comments about you the way you dress
[1:35:57] especially our sisters are you going to
[1:35:59] change your lifestyle and begin to throw
[1:36:02] something on to make people happy are
[1:36:04] you going to stick to what the inner man
[1:36:06] is telling you
[1:36:07] amen there's an inner man telling you
[1:36:10] that dress cover yourself
[1:36:12] put your because you are sacred on to
[1:36:14] the Lord you are sacred on to your
[1:36:17] husband if an almighty gonna be sacred
[1:36:19] on to your husband something to cover
[1:36:21] yourself
[1:36:21] amen so you have to listen to what the
[1:36:24] inner man is telling you sometimes we
[1:36:27] have the Holy Ghost or what in a man do
[1:36:28] I have
[1:36:30] I remember by the Jackson one time he
[1:36:31] said when my daughters were young I was
[1:36:34] acting the Holy Ghost for them amen I
[1:36:36] was there holy goose
[1:36:37] amen so if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:36:39] we do have an understanding God has put
[1:36:42] a man of God as a Holy Ghost for you God
[1:36:45] has put your parents amen as it was for

[1:36:49] it was for you God has put a modest
[1:36:51] sister say well it goes for you so he's
[1:36:53] the one that you can look up to for now
[1:36:55] on to the inner man takes his place
[1:36:57] amen so you might not have to understand
[1:37:00] everything you have to accept that yes
[1:37:03] you are my Holy Ghost
[1:37:04] praise God glory hallelujah God doesn't
[1:37:07] have to explain everything to us
[1:37:08] the preachers I don't have to explain
[1:37:10] everything to us but you know that is
[1:37:13] therefore your purpose is therefore your
[1:37:15] calling is there for you to bring you to
[1:37:17] where you are
[1:37:18] amen so that when you get in a man then
[1:37:21] you can connect the two that is price
[1:37:23] sticking through him is the same Jesus
[1:37:25] Christ sticking through me now blessed
[1:37:28] be the name of the Lord amen

[1:40:53] fresh he has to see it killed so the
[1:40:56] only way to do that is to for him or her
[1:40:58] to kill it then you know that yes this
[1:41:00] card is good this a chicken was killed
[1:41:02] is fresh amen

[1:41:27] praise be to God glory to God when I was
[1:41:31] coming out in the a as a young brother
[1:41:33] my pastor said something that I'll in
[1:41:36] some time the way you portray yourself
[1:41:38] can put you in trouble in my country you
[1:41:41] so have a time where you had military
[1:41:43] leaders and I used to be coup d'etat so
[1:41:45] this guy who had true this person and so
[1:41:48] - you know about five young men went to
[1:41:50] lesser like Miami Accra to the stadium
[1:41:53] to watch a soccer we call it soccer
[1:41:54] football
[1:41:55] so then when I think it was Sunday
[1:41:57] Sunday or Saturday they went just to
[1:42:00] watch soccer
[1:42:01] the
[1:42:01] was there because he was a fan of soccer
[1:42:03] fan let go into Miami from one of the
[1:42:06] small towns to watch maybe Miami
[1:42:08] what Dolphins or whatever right so they
[1:42:12] were they
[1:42:12] and then there was somebody wanted to
[1:42:14] blow the president so there was a
[1:42:15] grenade blew it up bidding her the
[1:42:17] president's Willie started to wrap up
[1:42:19] before they got these guys who had this

[1:44:44] black you've got red loss your your
[1:44:47] pants is this way and in the way you
[1:44:48] Kali who we declare now you should
[1:44:51] affirm man so this brother landed though
[1:44:55] he wasn't every wasn't a believer then
[1:44:57] but then the Lord sometimes is merciful
[1:44:59] he wrote a letter to his friend who was
[1:45:01] a believer that the church should pray
[1:45:03] for him and after his girl release he
[1:45:06] would come to church he said they'd give
[1:45:08] him a Bible he was innocent so he wasn't
[1:45:10] worried he was reading his Bible in jail
[1:45:12] he said about I don't know a couple
[1:45:14] months and then they left him he came to
[1:45:16] church got baptized cut off the
[1:45:18] dreadlocks he received Christ for
[1:45:20] himself so the Lord used it to bring him
[1:45:25] closer
[1:45:26] see how you're dressing for him he was
[1:45:29] he wasn't a no he wasn't a believer so
[1:45:31] the Lord used that occasion to draw him
[1:45:33] closer but for you you don't have to go
[1:45:35] down routes amen you do have to leave
[1:45:39] your beard put it in the ship it's not a
[1:45:41] dog train have a beard have whatever I
[1:45:43] want but don't let it grow wild because
[1:45:47] somebody will think you are something
[1:45:49] you are not a man
[1:45:51] because we are a polarized country it
[1:45:55] used to be on top in Lada was caught if
[1:45:57] you have a long beard leaving used to
[1:45:58] call it bin Laden because they thought
[1:46:00] bin Laden's doctrine people that believe
[1:46:02] in Balad and leave that long beard so
[1:46:04] you might be innocent walking around and
[1:46:06] the police has a crime the police who
[1:46:08] are black you are Hispanic you are this
[1:46:11] and of course you could not be amended
[1:46:13] when I arrest you and take you to jail

[1:50:43] that they do have to attract men by you
[1:50:46] that is not your motive so why do you
[1:50:47] have to do that praise be to God
[1:50:51] [Music]
[1:50:54] the Lord is good
[1:50:57] can I go a little further and then just
[1:51:02] give me a second
[1:51:05] the Lord is good
[1:51:10] praise be to God our our sisters dress
[1:51:16] them stay here for a while I don't know
[1:51:18] if the slide is working I had this one I
[1:51:20] had a tough time but who speak him to
[1:51:22] help me I'm not sure I wanted to show
[1:51:24] you certain things I got even advice
[1:51:26] like butter butter Jack preached the
[1:51:28] scriptures I was going to use Isaiah
[1:51:30] about the daughters of Zion about God
[1:51:34] talking about high heel I know the
[1:51:35] extreme and the Bible prophecies about
[1:51:39] it way back now let me show you
[1:51:42] something I don't know if I can the
[1:51:43] slide is working but then let me show
[1:51:46] you the side effect of where you are in
[1:51:48] high heels
[1:51:50] this just an advice is not a doctrine
[1:51:52] does issue when you wear high-heel you
[1:51:55] know the body look at the foot it's
[1:51:57] meant to the fullest we stand in a form
[1:51:59] of a pyramid as a human means when you
[1:52:01] slant you are like a parameter you have
[1:52:04] a broad base you can stretch so this
[1:52:07] foot is your balance this is where you
[1:52:10] it's your basic foundation foundation
[1:52:13] now if you wear a high heel to certain
[1:52:16] level now instead of putting the
[1:52:18] pressure on the foot you put a pressure
[1:52:20] in just in the front and the body has to
[1:52:23] make certain adjustment in your body
[1:52:24] there's an adjustment here adjustment
[1:52:27] here adjustment at the back and when you
[1:52:30] do it consistently you begin to develop
[1:52:32] back pains fractious let me read some of
[1:52:36] them for you lower back pain sore calves
[1:52:41] so muscle foot pain ankle sprains and
[1:52:44] falling you look like you are falling
[1:52:46] awkward spine a cave constrict blood
[1:52:50] vessel the blood vessel set modem are
[1:52:52] constricted so blood hasn't flow easily
[1:52:54] crooked your food can be crooked crooked
[1:52:57] feeds weakens ligaments Carlos is
[1:53:00] shortened what Achilles tendon lack of
[1:53:05] cushion and ingrown toenails
[1:53:07] those are salt a side effect when you
[1:53:10] consistently wear those hills because
[1:53:13] you put a body out of balance
[1:53:14] remember this flesh is just a muscles
[1:53:17] the one who put is the skeleton their
[1:53:19] bones so when you go this way
[1:53:21] you've seen that they position the
[1:53:23] natural position so you put some
[1:53:25] pressure on do pressure on your body and
[1:53:28] that can have
[1:53:30] a longtime effect on you so the Lord
[1:53:34] heed my not explaining like Dorchester
[1:53:36] splitted but he put in a Bible that
[1:53:38] don't even go there because it's not
[1:53:40] even good for you
[1:53:41] when hi he'll not take you to hell if
[1:53:44] we're child of God take a gun and shoot
[1:53:47] all the perp on the planet if an
[1:53:49] American was not American let me give an
[1:53:52] example if an American and let's say you
[1:53:55] go to Colombia you are the High
[1:53:57] Commissioner to Colombia all to Mexico
[1:53:59] and you go to selling cocaine and then
[1:54:03] they bring you back they make some
[1:54:04] propose I know these guys corrupt he's
[1:54:07] selling cocaine here they can sign you
[1:54:08] to channel because you're an American
[1:54:10] they'll send you back to the United
[1:54:12] States but maybe to take your passport
[1:54:14] from your diplomatic privileges you
[1:54:15] won't travel no more you can go outside
[1:54:17] the US because you disgrace a country
[1:54:19] the same way for a child of God kill all
[1:54:22] the poop on the planet it's not going to
[1:54:24] take you to hell
[1:54:25] you are so eternity but Allah to make
[1:54:28] you pay for every one of them here what
[1:54:32] we do the Lord make us to pay for it
[1:54:34] because when you go to the other side
[1:54:35] you don't have nothing to pay your slit
[1:54:37] to be clean so therefore that we do here
[1:54:39] the Lord give us time enough to pay for
[1:54:41] all the evils we do so that he was led
[1:54:44] to be clean when you go on the other
[1:54:45] side but you want to do that you want to
[1:54:48] spend your life paying for prizes or I
[1:54:50] want to spend your life do I find the
[1:54:52] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:54:54] [Music]
[1:54:55] you want to do something that will send
[1:54:57] you to jail now give you problems that
[1:55:00] will chase you all your life or you want
[1:55:02] to put your life obey the word of the
[1:55:03] Lord now bless you and bless your
[1:55:06] generation and bless the people around
[1:55:08] you praise be to God blessed be the name
[1:55:12] of the Lord I don't know if this is the
[1:55:14] pictures didn't come do you have the
[1:55:16] pictures okay good so this is a posture
[1:55:19] when you put on those Hills look at how
[1:55:21] their food the natural posture is
[1:55:24] different so you put those pressures on
[1:55:27] your body and a few more bodies already
[1:55:29] because of God design women to bring
[1:55:31] children bring life you already go
[1:55:33] through seven things they go through
[1:55:34] osteoporosis and certain ages at
[1:55:36] menopause Odell the Lord want you to
[1:55:39] prosper not only in the spirit but in
[1:55:41] the flesh as well now look
[1:55:42] is pressure now instead of the pressure
[1:55:45] being on their foot the pressure is now
[1:55:47] the second when the pressure come to the
[1:55:49] knee and then heat transferred to the
[1:55:51] hip to the backbone and acquires factor
[1:55:54] of spine so the Lord when the butter
[1:55:57] Jack preach about in your scriptures I'm
[1:55:59] no use in scriptures to use the
[1:56:00] scriptures already if we know here I
[1:56:03] think about Jack sir that is for charity
[1:56:05] only so it was a recorded if not listen
[1:56:08] to it face and you understand it some
[1:56:09] more much better so the Lord want to
[1:56:12] bless you you want to bless your health
[1:56:13] amen
[1:56:15] even setting food too much sugar
[1:56:17] diabetes so come on in in every way
[1:56:20] Suda so the students that we have here
[1:56:23] they don't use natural sugar cane they
[1:56:26] use sucrose artificial sugar and that
[1:56:28] sugar bring obesity diabetes blood
[1:56:30] pressure so it's just an advice like I
[1:56:33] said to them no it's just an advice
[1:56:34] don't drink to my soda don't drink soda
[1:56:38] every day I'm not saying I stay away
[1:56:40] from soda but don't make it a habit of
[1:56:42] every day
[1:56:42] I mean consuming about five liters of
[1:56:45] soda as you grow is gonna have effect on
[1:56:47] you because you don't want to do
[1:56:49] diabetes you don't want to do a blood
[1:56:51] pressure amen
[1:56:53] it's not even advisable to eat meat
[1:56:55] every day it's difficult for Africans
[1:56:59] Africans love meats but it's not good to
[1:57:05] eat meat every day because naturally God
[1:57:07] didn't creatures to be Cannavaro sitting
[1:57:09] critters to eat meat naturally was
[1:57:11] created to be happy for us it's plants
[1:57:14] and so forth but because of the fall we
[1:57:16] started killing
[1:57:17] so everybody is killing the lion is
[1:57:19] killing the cat is killing everybody we
[1:57:22] all started killing and killing cow good
[1:57:24] fish and everything so it's become part
[1:57:27] of our life I'm not saying that be a
[1:57:29] vegetarian but I mean be moderate
[1:57:32] because if you take meat every day is
[1:57:34] not good for the kidney because they saw
[1:57:36] the meat you don't need all of them
[1:57:37] so in poisons they're toxic to the
[1:57:39] kidney the liver but the Lord is living
[1:57:41] in this body amen the Lord want you to
[1:57:44] cross by in health and also prosper in
[1:57:47] the spirit it's miserable when you are
[1:57:49] sick when you have disease and you can't
[1:57:52] wake up you can't I mean use this but
[1:57:53] the way you use it so the Lord give us
[1:57:55] those advices to help us as Hebrews we
[1:57:58] are supernaturally bruised God has
[1:58:00] separated separated us from the things
[1:58:02] of the world and you want to bless even
[1:58:04] your flesh as well amen that's why I say
[1:58:07] be sensitive to the Spirit of the Lord
[1:58:09] praise be to God and I have a reference
[1:58:13] if you want to go and read further about
[1:58:15] the hams the high hills and the hubs
[1:58:18] they can cost you the body you can read
[1:58:20] about American Osteopathic Association
[1:58:22] organization even Simha bodies who do
[1:58:25] the best you can as much if you don't
[1:58:27] need it our advice that just leave it
[1:58:28] alone
[1:58:29] amen because God loves simplicity that
[1:58:33] is sin and simplicity the most simple
[1:58:35] you are the more easy easy easy life is
[1:58:38] for you
[1:58:38] amen we humans make things complicated
[1:58:40] faster but a lot is simple amen and this
[1:58:44] my advice to the young sisters and
[1:58:45] brothers those who are not married
[1:58:47] sometime when you begin to do certain
[1:58:48] things you put yourself in a certain
[1:58:50] category a nail polish and a mouth

[1:58:55] manicure pedicure the sisters can help

[1:59:05] polish right fingernail polish yes you

[1:59:11] be effective and if we Sistani do that
[1:59:13] sometimes three or so away from your
[1:59:15] blessing so young sisters one on Marissa
[1:59:18] came for husband pray for husband is an
[1:59:20] advice just a tip stay away from be
[1:59:23] simple so that God can directed to the
[1:59:25] right man he has for you amen
[1:59:28] that a man can see can his mind he can
[1:59:31] throw his mind off something he knows us
[1:59:34] a brother or a sister but sentence can
[1:59:37] is the bread I've been born again is
[1:59:39] this brother born again if we're Bradley

[2:01:34] life probably a hundred but it goes by
[2:01:36] the way you present yourself so it's

[2:02:26] I want to make it red or pink or yellow
[2:02:28] be who you are
[2:02:29] amen because you can't please everybody
[2:02:32] and I'll give an example when I was a
[2:02:35] kid I was born a left-handed in my
[2:02:38] country left-handed if I left-handed you
[2:02:39] can be a king it's kind of your UI
[2:02:42] inferior so left hand that is not even
[2:02:45] if you give on certain places you give
[2:02:47] an adult with your left hand let's say
[2:02:49] you want to give an adult you are
[2:02:53] disrespectful and adults you can't use
[2:02:55] your left hand to give something to an
[2:02:57] adult that's the culture so when I was a
[2:03:00] member after high school I played
[2:03:02] checkers some way and this would call me
[2:03:05] lefty because I'm dominant left and I
[2:03:07] didn't like it so I said you know what I
[2:03:08] have to find a way to like portray
[2:03:11] myself as right-handed person so I said
[2:03:13] I'm going to string my right hand and I
[2:03:15] wouldn't know I'm left-handed so I
[2:03:17] remember one time I was strung in my
[2:03:19] right tennis oh yes lefty come in as oh
[2:03:21] my it didn't work
[2:03:24] what's so I say no I'm gonna be myself
[2:03:29] does the record so it's European cannot
[2:03:33] change a skin and leopard cannot change
[2:03:35] your skin the way God made you be
[2:03:37] yourself
[2:03:38] so I started I know what I'm left-handed
[2:03:40] yes that's what a lot made me I don't
[2:03:42] want to be a king of Africa making of
[2:03:44] everything so that is good enough for me
[2:03:45] they made so you don't have to do things
[2:03:49] to please the world because you are not
[2:03:52] part of them you might try but in no
[2:03:56] time me what a part of them let me use
[2:03:59] what a bill oppose example but I believe
[2:04:00] Paul yes example YouTube testimony that
[2:04:04] he gifted young people he said when he
[2:04:05] was traveling with his deborah ham one
[2:04:08] day the devil you know they will gasp it
[2:04:10] through people the devil's who speak
[2:04:12] through people he can speak through your
[2:04:13] mind so the devil put upon its man you a
[2:04:15] young person you don't have no fun you
[2:04:18] don't have no life you just follow your
[2:04:19] dad to Africa and Europe and preach in

[2:04:23] the world said it's just like a thought
[2:04:26] it came to his mind that everyone jetted
[2:04:28] I thought say I look like I'm loosing
[2:04:30] out so begin to tell us that is far as
[2:04:33] saw it in a vision before I even put
[2:04:36] into prancer I'm said Billy you can go
[2:04:38] all the way there's two route left and
[2:04:41] right you can go all the way to the left
[2:04:44] but remember God is waiting for you here
[2:04:47] the right way so he said well one one
[2:04:51] time he said it is you know they want to
[2:04:53] go and stay with his grandmother because
[2:04:54] he wanted to have his own way so Bram
[2:04:56] said well yes the house of God if you
[2:04:58] want to live in my house we serve the
[2:05:00] Lord you can't be doing things you're
[2:05:01] not supposed to do and he said okay I'll
[2:05:03] go and stay with my grandma he went with
[2:05:05] Grandma and had a liquid to do whatever

[2:05:33] but every wonder that you are there
[2:05:34] Brian boy for him to gamble he had to
[2:05:38] deny his father that he wasn't a Brahmin
[2:05:41] boy sometime we deny our Father above
[2:05:44] for us to be accepted by the world but
[2:05:48] we don't have to deny Jesus price we
[2:05:51] have to assert that God has made you who
[2:05:55] you are that is who you are
[2:05:56] amen when you accept yourself it's easy
[2:05:59] you don't care about what somebody think
[2:06:01] about you you are not pleasing that we
[2:06:03] are pleasing the inner man glory
[2:06:05] hallelujah today number two the Lord
[2:06:07] Jesus Christ so and there's prices to

[2:06:15] heart hell is not an option but a lot of
[2:06:18] make sure that we pay for whatever we do
[2:06:19] here blessed be the name of the Lord you
[2:06:22] might be a young person if I say what I
[2:06:25] don't have nothing to do for the Lord
[2:06:26] the Lord has put something in us silly
[2:06:28] new and as you are growing up get a lot
[2:06:31] is as you hear the word God is
[2:06:33] quickening the ceiling you is bringing
[2:06:35] the city to fruition and the more you
[2:06:37] are sensitive to the Holy Ghost even if
[2:06:39] you don't have the Holy Ghost you don't
[2:06:40] feel in him you have a pastor that
[2:06:42] preaches to you every every Sunday's
[2:06:46] Wednesdays and Fridays you have brothers
[2:06:49] and sisters you have parents you have a
[2:06:52] eldest you have deacons you have people
[2:06:55] that you can look up to
[2:06:56] the more that you become what you are
[2:06:59] you become what you eat if you eat on
[2:07:01] the word you're gonna become the word
[2:07:03] amen
[2:07:04] if you eat the world the cosmos you're
[2:07:07] gonna become the cosmos so it's better
[2:07:09] for you to make a choice now which path
[2:07:11] are you going into are you going to the
[2:07:13] right you want to go with the world the
[2:07:15] flow of the world or you want to stay
[2:07:17] with the Lord Jesus Christ praise be to
[2:07:19] God you have to accept who God has made
[2:07:21] you to be amen
[2:07:23] I remember one time in a college I used
[2:07:25] to those time I used to read message
[2:07:28] book I like to read so what I used to do
[2:07:30] was say I always have miss a book in my
[2:07:32] backpack
[2:07:34] so when I go to class the professor is
[2:07:36] not in i justá-- can read paragraph page
[2:07:38] then I check it the next time I keep
[2:07:41] reading so one time in class I remember
[2:07:42] biochemistry class and it was a small
[2:07:45] class about 28 students and some of the
[2:07:48] boys were laughing at the corner there
[2:07:50] where the guys were laughing and you
[2:07:51] know having some fun so I went as what's
[2:07:53] going on why you guys happy and they
[2:07:54] told me no go away we don't want to I
[2:07:56] mean it's not for you I said Tommy
[2:07:58] what's going on why you guys excited and
[2:08:00] I said I didn't know this guy doesn't
[2:08:03] know me he said you were pasta get out

[2:08:15] back and took my message but say you
[2:08:17] were pasta but this guy doesn't know me
[2:08:19] and I'm not a pasta so what is this guy
[2:08:22] talking about
[2:08:23] so people even see the gifting you
[2:08:25] before you recognize it and they are you
[2:08:29] accept who you are they're better amen
[2:08:32] if I serve what God has made you to be
[2:08:35] the better is this for you
[2:08:36] amen some of you God is going to use you
[2:08:39] wonderfully young and old the hand of
[2:08:42] the Lord is upon you and the more you
[2:08:44] give to the Ministry God has given to
[2:08:45] you you man understand everything but a
[2:08:47] jack preaches it might not make sense to
[2:08:49] you it might be like it might be roaming
[2:08:52] in your brain you just accept it
[2:08:54] where time is gonna make sense to you
[2:08:56] amen you might not understand what your
[2:08:58] parents tell you I mean with time it's
[2:09:01] gonna make sense to you so all that you
[2:09:03] have to do is what I said be sensitive
[2:09:06] to the inner man asserted Allah Jesus
[2:09:09] Christ what has made you to be the life
[2:09:11] would be much easier for you glory

[2:09:25] the Lord use women as 10 I mean the Lord
[2:09:28] use setting women in a special way in
[2:09:30] the Bible amen
[2:09:32] sometime you might understand why even
[2:09:35] were born in their family sometimes you
[2:09:38] look around people have got freedom they
[2:09:40] can go out and come in whenever they
[2:09:42] want setting kids but you've got a
[2:09:44] parents who are always watching you I
[2:09:46] want to meet a sista in Ghana and as I
[2:09:49] said oh she's from French side Ivory
[2:09:51] Coast's this big friend said my dad is
[2:09:53] that is a message Minister passed I said
[2:09:55] it was too difficult for me when I was
[2:09:57] growing up everything you do matters if
[2:09:59] Rev remedy problem said said you were
[2:10:02] yours kids and that you come and say
[2:10:04] freb remedy Rev remedy whatever I do but

[2:10:19] everybody you might have maybe half kiss
[2:10:22] that it implant for life would have been
[2:10:25] much difficult you sell a daughter of
[2:10:26] God but maybe life could have been much
[2:10:28] difficult for you but for us in February
[2:10:31] from Ramadi it has helped me to be who
[2:10:34] you are
[2:10:34] amen so sometimes growing up as a kid
[2:10:37] even understand what your friend is
[2:10:38] telling you what the elders are telling
[2:10:41] you about they have got experience they
[2:10:43] have water route and they know better
[2:10:45] so you just obey with time is gonna make
[2:10:47] sense to you praise be to God hallelujah
[2:10:50] being sensitive to the Holy Ghost when I
[2:10:54] finished high school amuse an
[2:10:55] experienced I finished high school I got
[2:10:57] a job just after high school graduate in
[2:10:59] a private school I was teaching there's
[2:11:01] a lot of kid just was happy teaching and
[2:11:04] a lot open a door for me I think I was
[2:11:06] just about a year or less than a year
[2:11:07] and the message I could preach with my
[2:11:10] students sing missus songs we did this
[2:11:13] like a church and it's a private school
[2:11:15] so the principal a school principal
[2:11:17] doesn't have problem as long as you
[2:11:19] teach is happy easy we have
[2:11:20] he was a Catholic but it was happy that
[2:11:23] you cannot put the student in that way
[2:11:25] one day I was teaching in an elderly
[2:11:27] person very old tall old man and he was
[2:11:30] kind of bent so he was with a cane and
[2:11:32] walking this way came to the window and
[2:11:34] as the student that call me your teacher
[2:11:36] and he said young man come and preach
[2:11:39] for me see I'm very old I have a church
[2:11:41] here use didn't know where the church is
[2:11:43] I can't reach no more come and preach
[2:11:45] for me and I was like it blows said I'm
[2:11:47] not a pastor how am I gonna do where's
[2:11:50] this coming from like I begin to bad I
[2:11:52] begin to become a battle for me so I was
[2:11:54] thinking said after school your student
[2:11:56] can very to wear my churches so Deborah
[2:11:58] Prince back him I was not sick influence
[2:12:01] said what did that old mentor what did
[2:12:03] he tell you
[2:12:03] and so I told me to come and pretty for
[2:12:05] him said forget about him don't don't
[2:12:07] don't don't pay attention to what the
[2:12:09] old man said and I didn't pay attention
[2:12:11] I didn't go I didn't do nothin in the
[2:12:14] course of time begin to hunt me so I
[2:12:15] asked my my pastor's brother he was a
[2:12:18] system pasta so what I said this
[2:12:20] happened to me I was sitting and an old
[2:12:23] man came and asked me to go preach for
[2:12:24] him but another pasta so I loved a lot I
[2:12:27] love to witness but I don't know he said
[2:12:30] oh don't you remember the message but
[2:12:31] Abraham Adam brought an evil he was a
[2:12:33] Methodist preacher and but I want to
[2:12:35] preach and the whole church was
[2:12:36] converted to the message and I didn't
[2:12:38] know better so when's demands well I
[2:12:41] even left a school and to add insult to
[2:12:43] injury and I'm tell you how to be be
[2:12:46] sensitive to the Holy Ghost to add
[2:12:48] insult to injury I begin to arch in my
[2:12:51] eye
[2:12:51] I had some time by the principal and I
[2:12:54] said you know I was going to leave this
[2:12:55] place because the principal was one of
[2:12:56] the leaders was telling me that the
[2:12:58] principal want to try to cheat others
[2:13:01] more than young ladies in the in the
[2:13:02] teaches edit among the teachers I said
[2:13:04] no no it is not this on my right this is
[2:13:06] only place for me I was a little bit
[2:13:08] legalistic so I left before I left I
[2:13:10] wrote a letter of resignation letter and
[2:13:13] went to the principal's office that I'm
[2:13:15] going to leave but I was still - you get
[2:13:17] another teacher so my class was like a
[2:13:20] church
[2:13:21] message preached do everything so my
[2:13:24] mind how am I going to tell my student
[2:13:26] I'm going to leave so I told and I well
[2:13:28] I stopped for me to go to college so I'm
[2:13:30] going to start my application
[2:13:32] and I said one of the girls was crying
[2:13:35] she said mister when you go who preach
[2:13:38] to us and it cut my heart like a knife I
[2:13:41] should have taken a decision she was
[2:13:43] crying and I saw mr. Chad the new
[2:13:45] teacher would preach to you and they
[2:13:48] went to ask him said I don't every
[2:13:49] preacher I don't have nothing to do with
[2:13:50] preaching and I so didn't obeyed God put
[2:13:53] me there for a purpose but I left and
[2:13:55] for I remember when I was in London
[2:13:57] sometimes you might God can let you go
[2:13:59] do things you let you go but the price
[2:14:01] is waiting for you at the right time I
[2:14:03] remember in London when it comes up for
[2:14:05] me I cry like a baby I plead to God some
[2:14:08] time I go back to can Lord let me go
[2:14:09] back and it's time that time God wanted
[2:14:12] to do this you didn't do it the time is
[2:14:14] gone so when God calls you heed the call
[2:14:19] of God when I were a brother a sister
[2:14:23] what has put something in you you know
[2:14:25] what God is doing in your life
[2:14:26] the call is not only to preach you know
[2:14:29] your life
[2:14:29] pretty small gospel than what we
[2:14:32] appreciate amen
[2:14:33] so it might be a since I got my put in a
[2:14:35] school is not for you to conform to what
[2:14:38] your classmates and your school people
[2:14:40] do it's not for it for you to conform to
[2:14:42] what the work meets that what your
[2:14:44] colleagues do it for you to work to be
[2:14:47] transform show them Jesus Christ by your
[2:14:51] life by your conduct this is something
[2:14:53] you d see assaulting you that you are so
[2:14:56] to you as special and they would like to
[2:14:58] be like you
[2:14:59] amen is not for you to take your gospel
[2:15:02] and threw it away and then you'll become
[2:15:04] part of them for you to be accepted in
[2:15:06] their workplace no no no no it's for you
[2:15:08] God to give you that way give you that
[2:15:10] job to show Jesus Christ it could be
[2:15:12] only one person but up as you see that
[2:15:15] know you are different that person will
[2:15:17] ask you who you are Bible to that person
[2:15:19] and God will use you to draw a person
[2:15:22] closer to God amen be sensitive to the
[2:15:26] Holy Spirit praise be to God let me read
[2:15:31] something about a let's go to a book of
[2:15:33] Judges
[2:15:41] let's see a woman
[2:15:43] Samson's mother judges chapter 13 I wish
[2:15:48] you can really hold him buddies so much
[2:15:50] so we just read some portions and then
[2:15:53] the rest can really want to get back
[2:15:54] home
[2:15:59] angel of the Lord visited Samson's
[2:16:02] mother let's call it the baboo didn't
[2:16:03] give a name but since I husband is
[2:16:04] common one let's call it missus man
[2:16:06] wanna practice birth judges 13 to 225
[2:16:10] we're gonna be able to really written
[2:16:12] and that was a judge's 13 to 2 2500
[2:16:16] years portions yeah if you can't bring
[2:16:19] the regular script scriptures for me I
[2:16:23] don't have everything said there was a
[2:16:24] certain man of Zorah
[2:16:25] of the family of the Knights whose name
[2:16:28] was Manoah and his wife was barren and
[2:16:30] bare not do you have a child and the
[2:16:33] angel of the Lord appeared unto the
[2:16:34] woman and said unto her behold now thou
[2:16:36] art barren and various not but thou
[2:16:39] shall conceive and bear a son now
[2:16:42] therefore the way I pray thee drink not
[2:16:44] wine nor strong drink it not anything
[2:16:47] anything on Clinton anything unclean for
[2:16:50] thou shall conceive and bear a son and
[2:16:53] no reason shall come on his head for the
[2:16:56] charge shall be a Nazarite unto God from
[2:16:58] the womb and he shall begin to deliver
[2:17:00] Israel out of the hand of the Philistine
[2:17:02] praise be to God the one came and to
[2:17:06] their husband now this a woman danger
[2:17:07] didn't appear to the husband he appeared
[2:17:10] to the wife can angel visit women yes
[2:17:14] do angels visit only prophet no angel of
[2:17:18] the Lord will appear to whoever he want
[2:17:19] to appear to praise be to God is not
[2:17:22] only prophet and you cannot only
[2:17:24] preaches not only pastors and
[2:17:27] teachers and
[2:17:29] evangelist and faithful ministry God can
[2:17:32] appear to anybody a child as a woman
[2:17:37] whoever the Lord can want to appear to
[2:17:40] can appear to you so he said then the
[2:17:43] woman to their husband that a man of God
