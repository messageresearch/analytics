god bless you y'all heard about the new baby amen uh josue that's all you got to say brother holt swing see because he put the emphasis on different different words right because it's you know from

entire pregnancy and even the delivery of the baby amen just our god is a good god amen it's a miracle for her to even be able to have that child uh so we thank god for it this morning you saw another miracle before you sister tina had not been able to sing for quite some time and um and you know the lord has touched her voice and and allowed her to get right back up here and sing again and i believe it was a couple weeks ago we were here in service and you know just just the holy spirit just met us in a very special way and during that service uh sister tina had received the healing amen in her voice so god is good amen god is real good we thank the lord for touching her praise the lord appreciate her song appreciate brother troy's song amen uh on this morning as well and uh i won't take too much of your time i see y'all fanning and y'all hot what y'all think about me up here amen but god is still good amen god is still good the devil the devil can't take our praise just over something like this man we learn how to get praise in the midst of a lot a lot lot worse conditions amen but god is god is still good in the midst of it all so i won't i won't i won't prolong the time amen um this this morning i want to read a scripture um i believe from genesis chapter and i'll ask that you stand with me amen in the reading of the word of god and then i'll have a word of prayer and i'll let you be seated here in genesis 16 verse 6 says but abram said it said unto sarai behold thy maid is in thy hand due to her as it pleases thee uh and when sarai dealt hardly with her she fled from her face the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of waters in the wilderness for uh by the fountain in the way way too sure said hagar sir eyes made whence cometh down when cain is down and whether we'll go she said i flee from the face of my mistress to rye praise the lord now there was two questions asked uh whence came as thou and willow will now go now she only answered one question and she said i flee from uh the face of my mistress sarai right so she probably was in a little fix here didn't even know where she was going amen sometimes mamas find themselves themselves in places like that little pictures where they don't know which way to go praise the lord verse 9 says in the angel of the lord said unto her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands the angel of the lord said unto her i will multiply thy seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude the angel lord said unto her behold thou art with child and shalt bear a son and shall call his name ishmael uh because the lord hath heard thy affliction and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren and she called the name of the lord and she called the name of the lord that spoken to her thou god seized me for she said i have also here looked after him that seeth me wherefore the whale was called beer lahaya roy behold it is between kadesh and bread and hagar bear abram a son and abram called his son's name which hagar bear ish film and abram was four score and six years old when hagar bear ishmael to abram let's pray father we thank you for the word of the lord that has been read and father we just believe that you will now take control of what is being presented to your people god we pray strength and encouragement upon every mother that is present those that are listed online we pray that you look upon them and father we just ask that you just get all the glory and all the honor from this portion of service thank you for all that you have done thus far and uh lord may your spirit just settle down upon each and every person may we all receive something from the word of the lord today god is in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated praise the lord um i want to just use for a title today misunderstood but god sees me amen misunderstood but god sees me amen praise the lord and um i know that the prophet tells us that mother's day should not just be one day a year but mother's day is is uh every day it should be every day and uh we we do understand that but for myself being that we have this day set aside i try to do everything i can to get a word from the lord that might encourage the moms amen i always try to do that and even on father's day i try to do that just try to have something that we can encourage the moms with and and uh and i'm just just praying over this and just meditating on this and just kind of came with this little thought misunderstood but god sees me hey man just let me uh uh start here by just reading a couple things here and uh we'll get into our text uh the first little quote that i'd like to read is from summer mother's day um anybody knows me you know me well when it comes to mother's day there's a few quotes that i like to read because i don't you usually get a chance to read them other times during the year but mother's day you're gonna hear them from me uh because i think this is my favorite favorite you know statements that i've heard and i just thank god for the prophet just kind of sharing it but but let's listen to this uh this is coming out of mother's day paragraph 31 says mother is so great you know the first one that receives you this life is your mother no one can touch you because you're conceived and she bears you under her heart and she is the first to know you and first in this life to hold you uh then when you're when you're born see uh one of the first hands that touch you and wipes back the tears out of your eye praise god some of y'all just start going down journeys and um just going back in time and thinking about how maybe you had a little what they call a little boo boo or something like that and you go running to mama mama had a way of just touching you amanda and and sometimes you know uh mama mama actually she didn't have no healing powers she didn't have um uh anything that could stop the bleeding like that you know she could probably maybe get a band-aid or something like that but but one of the things that stopped the tears from flowing in your eyes is when mama would just say let me blow on it that's all mama had to do it just blow on it and in some kind of way amen just because it was coming from mama come on somebody amen you felt comfort you felt hey man you felt relief some kind of way because mama was paying attention to it mama has a way of just doing things it's different to what daddy would do daddy might pick you up brush yours and not get back out there and keep playing amen but mama would just i mean she cried with you glory to god she wiped the the whatever what she wipe it up she clean it up mama had a way of just it meant hail in the situation that made you feel real good you didn't mind taking things to mama glory to god it says he says uh one of the first hands that touch you and wipes back the tears out of your eye uh she's the first one to pat you and to love you and to cool over you in this life is your mother now think that there is not enough honor that we could give to a mother praise god mother is first with a child and she's a great responsibility of what that child will be so mamas you help shape a man the direction of your children mother is first with a child she's great she's a great responsibility of what that child will be will be based upon the way that mother starts that child on the path that it must travel i like that statement amen because sometimes mama you started them on a certain path but somewhere along the line they get off the roads blessed be the name of the lord but you have a promise that you can hold god too he said train up a child in the way that they should go and then he said they said and when they get old come on sometimes they go through some from saying some things when they're young but when they get old they won't depart from that path that you established at the beginning so mama don't get discouraged know that you've done exactly what god told you to do hallelujah hallelujah says mother has the responsibility from god to place that child on the right road and i think that's why mother has a special little touch amen so i just want to uh stop with that one there praise god let me just go on to another one here really quick at an invasion of the united states mama has a great responsibility and i appreciate all the godly mothers amen that have raised their children in the ways of the lord we certainly appreciate mothers like that here in the invasion of the united states the prophet says this to your little mothers here this morning that's been real mothers and i know there's many of you i think every one of you let me tell you something god bless you you're the fifth gospel glory i think let me tell you uh let me tell you what's in in there for your children just a little thing because brother neville will probably preach about a mother tonight or whoever one of the one of us that preaches i write about mothers but listen let me ask you something remember when moses was a little boy it was a mother who gave who give him his instruction it was a godly mother who took his took little moses on her knees and and moses taught him all he was her teacher uh she was his teacher rather under pharaoh and now these things said moses someday you're going to deliver the children of israel you're the boy that's called keep yourself pure and unspotted from the world for you the one you're the one now i can just imagine as moses mothers kind of carrying him through a man uh uh maybe just some of the history how he even came into existence and just about his birth and all that maybe some of her instruction amen to moses might have caused moses to misunderstand why she was the way she was with him but it was later on in life that moses could understand more of what his mother's instructions was all about what his true purpose in life was hallelujah mama all you got to do is just plant the seed it's up to god to water it amen and sometimes i want to tell you when you're planting seeds it's very uncomfortable uh conversations it's not very uncomfortable words that you have to speak sometimes but but don't no don't don't worry about it just say what god tell you to say god will bring it forth at some later time i remember being a young man and having to hear my mama talk to me sometime i some of those conversations i wanted to avoid amen but i remember mama just sharing and amen and uh there's a few things that that i go back let me tell you what let me just finish this quote and then i'll come back to that little thought there uh here he says um uh moses on these taught him all uh uh mother someday you're gonna be the delivered to the children of israel you're the boy that's called keep yourself pure and not spotted from the world for you the one you're the one no other place do we know where he even went to any seminary any teaching at all he ever got he stayed right in pharaoh's palace which was a heathen but his mother taught him that's a real mother she taught him the precepts of the lord she told him how he must be holy she told him how and what he must live and how what god must do would do for him and it stuck with moses all the days of his life and any good true loyal mother that'll take her little babies instead of send them to picture shows and dances and so forth like that she'll put them on a lap and teach them about the lord jesus christ you know i was just uh reflecting here because you know as moses mother had the opportunity to teach him in egypt egypt represents the world and uh and mothers today have to raise their kids in some really really difficult conditions there's a pool of the world everywhere they turn there's a pull of the world when they turn on the tv there's a pull of a world when they go to school there's a pull of the world everywhere they turn there's a pool when they go to walmart there's a pool of the world everywhere our children go there's something pulling them pulling them into wrong but mothers you have a responsibility to try to teach them and lead them in the right direction i just remember as a young man i certainly had the pulling world in my life and young people i want to tell you something you're not alone when you feel the pull of the world that that's something that's normal amen that's something that's very normal everybody in here has the pull of the world on them everybody but it's up to you to make a decision amen that i'm not gonna go the way of the world but i'm gonna go the way of god each one of us have to come to that decision amen but it's up to mamas to try to sow some seeds and and i remember as a young man just kind of going through different things but you know mama would just kind of plant certain things amen into my spirit and one of the things that that mama taught me as a as a young man that i i teach uh still today to other young men mama just told me to say uh you know because when i was younger i looked at this bible and it's a lot of pages here this is what i call a really big book and and i didn't like reading hey man i really didn't enjoy reading so uh you know things have changed now i got old i can't i can't i help myself i got to pick up the bible and read now but but when i was younger i didn't want i didn't really want much to do with that i'm just being honest hey man that's a big book and i always ran from the big books give me a real small book if you want me to read something give me something real small just a few pages i can get through in five minutes but i didn't want to read this big book so mama just broke the big book down to a smaller book she said just read proverbs praise god 31 chapters 31 days in a month just read one chapter they read proverbs and uh you know and mama just broke it down and i said well you know what i i probably not gonna read the whole bible but i'll tell you what i will read proverbs i'll try that i'll try that and as i start reading proverbs i didn't realize it good god almighty but as i'm reading the word the word is actually being sowed into my heart amen and as i'm facing certain circumstances in life i could go back to what i read in proverbs and the word has a way of keeping you glory to god when mama ain't there and daddy ain't there and passing there the word has a way of keeping you if you get the word on the inside of you hey i believe that the bible said i will keep you in perfect peace if you keep your heart and your mind stayed on me but i found that the word kept me out of certain situations the word kept me in certain circumstances because i i heeded the advice of my mom who said just read proverbs glory to god sometimes that's all you got to just give them just a little something there's enough there's enough power in just one little scripture that'll keep your child from a world just a world of trouble praise god one little scripture can hold can keep them let me just give you a few things here amen just to encourage you uh these are some quotes on being a mother a brother posted some time ago and i just kind of grabbed it and it's coming from a number of different people but listen here says this is from billy's son he says i don't believe there are enough devils uh there are devils enough in hell to pull a boy out of the arms of a godly mother there's not enough devils to pull my son into hell a godly mother gonna keep fighting for a son praise god i don't care what i heard about him but god the mother when daddy give up because that is saying now you did the crowd you did the crime you do the time but mama will be right there holding on for that child hey man i don't believe there are devils enough in hell to pull a boy out of the arms of a godly mother now you need to understand something uh the love of a mother amen is very close to the love of god hallelujah hey man sometimes daddy's don't don't don't make mama give up like like you giving up because her love kind of goes beyond some things hey man she has a different connection than the way daddy has so hey man i don't believe that the devil's enough to inhale to pull a boy out of the arms of a godly mother another statement here says too many women have too much legion time for their own good they have time for criticism and gossip fault-finding and complaining they have time for idol games and lay too much attention to things of the flesh there are other women who have too little time for the enduring things of life they're too busy uh fleeting about doing this and that they have great activity and much doing but they lack time for building christian characters both kind of women the two idol and the too busy need to take time for meditation and quiet repose and prayer to god they need time to cultivate their souls that in turn they may cultivate their children's lives that's from billy graham the impression that a praying mother leaves upon her children is lifelong perhaps when you are dead and gone your prayer will be answered that's from d.l moody and and i just want to inject that the pre the impression that a prayer and mother leave i remember you know there was a time in our life glory to god we were you know kids growing up there in the house and and um i remember there was a day where we were we were i guess we got a little hungry and we just depended on mama to just do everything like we couldn't get in there fixing a hot dog for ourselves but mama had to do it all right and i remember there was this one day where we were um uh we were all in the house and and and as we looked out the window we could see all the cars are are here at the a at the house that means mama's home and dad is home and and everybody's here somewhere somebody's everybody's here at the house now we can see daddy kind of walking back and forth in the house but we couldn't find mama and we were going to ask dad and daddy where's my man daddy say uh-huh i'm not sure i don't know you know we don't know we uh she's around here somewhere he just wouldn't tell us well daddy we hungry well you gotta wait for your mama well daddy where's baba well you just gotta wait for your mama so we start looking out the window i see her car here she got to be somewhere around and uh and i remember you know just being kids we weren't gonna let it go we're gonna try to find mama knock on the bedroom though mama not in the bedroom hey man we go to the backyard mama's not in the backyard go to the side yard mama's not beside y'all where is mama my god and uh and finally amen what we realized we had this this this this van amen that we had a customized van that we used to that that would take us on vacation then mama found a way to get inside that van and make that van her prayer closet glory to god and as a young man i didn't i didn't understand it was misunderstood amen i didn't understand what mama was doing at those times but she was stealing away hey man because she knew she can do it in the house we'd be all over her inside the house so she had to get out to the van and just get a amen find a prayer closet inside of that and that prayer life has helped shape me today hallelujah i thank god for praying mama many of y'all have the same testimony amen you thank god for praying praying mother amen here another another statement that is made says this uh there's more power in a mother's hand than in a king scepter billy sunday says that of all the rights of a woman the greatest is to be a mother amen len you tang my mother was the most beautiful woman i ever saw all i am i owe to my mother i attribute all my success in life to to the moral to the moral intellectual and physical education i received from her that's from george washington uh there never was a woman like her she was gentle as a dove and brave as a lioness the memory of my mother and her teachings were after all the only capital i had to start life with and on that capitol i have made my way andrew jackson hey man for a wife take the daughter of a good mother brothers amen i want to give you some really really good advice this is from thomas fuller for a wife if you're looking for a wife take the daughter of a good mother praise god amen all in all my efforts to learn to read my mother shared fully my ambition and sympathize with me and aided me in every way she could if i have done anything in life worth attention i feel sure that i inherited the disposition from my mother booker t washington amen all that i am or ever hope to be i owe to my angel mother abraham lincoln amen to be a mother is by no means second class men may have the authority in the home but the woman have the influence the mother more than the father is the one who mows and shapes those little lies from day one from john mcarthur amen there is only one pretty child in the world and every mother has it that's a chinese proverb amen a mother understands what a child does not say that's a jewish proverb amen because there's sometimes you know you wonder why is it that a man in life that mama has a way of calling a child at the right time or reaching out to the child at the right time maybe they don't really hear from daddy like that but mama has a has a way of just calling just at the right moment because mama mama mama can hear what a child is not saying mama can feel it amen here's another one says when motherhood is broke the backbone of the nation is broke from the prophet william branham hey man when you were small and just a touch away i covet you with blankets against the cold night air but now that you're that you're tall and out of reach i fold my hands and cover you with prayer amen donna maddox cooper hey man here's another one a mother's love has the ability to forgive even the most difficult child the author's unknown amen the mother's heart is a child's school room henry ward beecher amen being a full-time mother is one of the highest salaried jobs why because the payment is pure love good god almighty from mildred vermont amen the most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother he reward pizza i remember my mother's prayers and they have always followed me they have clung to me all my life abraham lincoln and this last statement from the prophet says a good christian mother is a treasure to a human heart that's never forgotten praise the name of the lord here i want to just kind of make mention of something here last night i was just kind of putting my notes together on this sermon and and i saw a little post from sister bernice that just blessed me says uh the closer you get to the thing the better you understand the thing the closer you get to a thing the better you understand the thing uh oftentimes as mothers amen mothers go through a just a long period of life where their children misunderstand them they misunderstand the decisions they misunderstand amen sometimes the uh the punishments amen and the things that that mama have to do time that that uh if the kids just misunderstand some things that mama might say oh glory to god amen my wife is another mother that i appreciate because she's the mother of my children and uh and there's times where my wife would have to tell me you know uh you're gonna have to let me handle this one with with this child you have to let me handle this because i tend to know women a little bit better than the way you know him come on somebody amen and here here i'm about to be uh sucked into something i'm i'm about to be taken advantage of but but my wife i said now you got to let me handle this one praise the lord because you don't understand what's get what they're really setting you up for oh hallelujah hey hey hey hey let me tell you something not only is that good for in the home but even in the church praise god my wife have to stand by my side say wait wait wait wait wait you know we got to handle this this way because because i know where this is going she understands the thought of women hallelujah and then she understands the thoughts of the little girl hey man where the little girl get ready to take advantage of daddy but that wife understand that mother understands it sometimes daddy got to step back and just let her be mother amen and even though she might be misunderstood she might be misunderstood it's okay mom i want to tell you god sees you you might be misunderstood by your family sometimes but god sees you man amen amen your children your sons may not understand it but god sees you your daughters may not understand it but god sees you it's okay to go through the misunderstandings but god sees you hallelujah hallelujah amen the closer you get to a thing the better you understand the thing and one of the things i want to say this morning is that uh it's hard for you to understand why a mama does what a mama does amen and says some of the things that she says it's hard to understand that until you become mama then you can understand and i how many how many times you not heard people tasting that when i get grown and i have kids i will not i ain't gonna raise my kids like this thing oh yeah you just talking because you in a hey man you you ain't you ain't in the real world yet praise god but when you got one glory to god when you got one that you got you responsible for amen that you got to take care of every day hey man yo you begin to think different you begin to act different you find yourself acting just like your mama and you wonder where it came from it was always in you you can't run from it you might as well run to it praise the lord but sometimes mamas are misunderstood there was a pain at one time that painted a picture and uh when he painted this picture praise god he uh he put it painted it with a door and and as he painted this door he didn't put a knob on the outside of the door and when he put this when he put the picture there before the hall of critics many of the people looked at and it says you know uh you know this picture that you guys said you know it's a nice picture but there's one problem it says you did not put a doorknob on the outside so we can people can open the door and go inside he says no no no no that's not a problem so you just misunderstand glory to god you misunderstand why i did what i did but let me try to give you a little bit more insight i put the dough on the inside because the person that knocks on the door amen is going to be christ but you have to be the one on the inside to open up the door hallelujah hallelujah amen sometimes we do things in life and we might be misunderstood amen glory to god but the closer you get to the thing the better you understand the thing glory hallelujah i want to tell you something mothers amen even your praise can be misunderstood your praise when you come to church and you're worshiping the lord with everything you got your praise can oftentimes be misunderstood i want to read a little quote here brother brandon made this statement right here in west palm beach florida i want to read this for you a man out of god's provided way praise the lord amen it says this and says uh that's about what half the matter with the with the church tonight stagnated with what we call in the south uh up there with wiggletails that's what's the matter with a lot of people's experience today it says well i got blessed way back yonder 10 years ago what about now how are you praying up now it goes on and says this says uh reminds me of a little irish mother coming across from ireland she was going over to new york to meet her daughter and on the road over they were sending a sos the ship was about to sink they was just playing some kind of a jazz music down in the on the floor and all of them dancing the captain the skipper come down yonder said just the moment everybody said change your music good god almighty i'm gonna just just park there just for a little bit they were they were playing amen the jazz music glory to god and they were all on the dance floor amen now this is the quote from back in 53 they might not be doing i know some saints saints saints i know some saints listen to jazz praise the lord i don't think saints should be doing that still i don't think stink should be listening to rap or country come on somebody not saints we listen to gospel but you know here here what happened is that as they were as they were getting ready to sing hey man the captain yelled out change the music i'm here to tell you this morning some of your lives are thinking and it's time for you to change the music glory to god you need to change some music and turn your attention back to god glory to god the sos signals are going up can't you see your life ain't been blessed since you turned from god it's time to change the music hallelujah to the lamb of god amen say they was playing some kind of a jazz music down on the floor and all of them dancing the captain the skipper come down yonder said just a moment everybody said change your music if we can hold out 30 minutes we'll be there if we don't we're gonna we're going to the bottom of the seat and it says everybody begin to to play uh nearer my god to thee and everybody fell on the floor and began to pray see how things change god god said a little uh something uncomfortable in your life it caused you to turn to prayer oh god know how to do it god know how to get our attention oh my god everybody fell on the floor and began to pray little lord irish mother a little old dress hooked up around this way and and her long sleeves she said glory hallelujah hallelujah now i want you to see sia her praise was misunderstood glory to god as this mama heard the captain say change the music amen and everybody begin to sing sing hymns now glory amen and now they're starting to pray because they realize if we don't last for 30 minutes we go in town but this woman rather this this old mother she didn't get nervous at the time she heard the announcement she began to worship god she said glory hallelujah everybody on their on their knees praying and she up with our hands in our eye glory hallelujah praise the name of the lord her praise was being misunderstood and the captain finally got her attention saying ma'am you know i don't think you caught what i was saying said no i clearly understood you you said that if we don't uh if the ship if we can make it in 30 minutes we'll be all right but if not we're gonna drink we're gonna sink in the bottom of the sea i got it she's saying praise god he's saying woman how can you praise at a time like this mamas how can you praise when your children act enough cutting up acting a fool praise god how can you keep on praising well the teacher she said captain i heard you're loud and clear she said well why are you still acting the way you acted say because i realized something she said i got a daughter that i'm going to see in new york glory to god if we make it to new york i'm going to see my daughter but i got another daughter that's already in heaven and if the ship go down i'm gonna go see my daughter and have him she said praise god i win either way glory to god sometimes your praise can be misunderstood but you praise him because you got a revelation of who you are [Music] hey hallelujah sometimes your praise can be misunderstood see that that mother was living a life where she didn't need to change the music she was ready whatever whatever life was thrown in her direction she was ready for it praise god we all need to live lives like that before god that we're ready for whatever life throws in our direction misunderstood but god sees god seeks here i want to read a scripture this uh word misunderstand means fail to interpret or understand the words or actions of someone correctly sometimes we fail to understand the words or the actions of our mother we fail to understand it we just don't get it sometimes the glory to god when to keep you out of jail you realize later on why mama had to do what she had to do i i remember a young young friend of mine and he was i was you know i remember man he must have been 15 and he come to the house with this nice celica nice car he said man you're only 15 i just i just got my learning burners you got a car already and uh he said he say uh yeah man my parents got this for me and so on and so forth and i'm sitting there thinking well what about my parents what about my parents i was misunderstanding some things and that that same guy that i'm sitting there looking at with this nice car told me say look man your parents really love you say well if they love me i have a a a yellow celica like your parents love you let them show the love the same guy that told me that had that nice celica spent a number of years in prison over drugs and i had no idea he was into drugs and now he's a preacher outside you know i thank god for it but i remember his lesson to me that day your parents love you just because they don't get you everything that you're asking for it does not mean that they don't love you hallelujah actually what they all teach you sometimes that you have to work to get what you want praise the lord you got the work to get what you want it don't mean you need it but you have the word to get what you want and sometimes mamas have to teach those hard lessons blessed be the name of the lord let's look at a scripture of a lady here who was absolutely misunderstood turn with me to first samuel chapter one glory holland first samuel chapter one says this now there was a certain man of remethane sophia of mount ephraim and his name was elkanah the son of jeroham the son of elihu the son of tohu the son of zeus an air force and he had two wives the name of one was hannah the name of the other pinanaya uh uh uh yeah uh penny nah something like that uh and pinata had children but hannah had no children now i want to just kind of catch this and you know notice the scripture tells us that he had two wives and back then amen this was polygamy and it was acceptable to scripture um you know so we're gonna we're gonna see that also in another scripture that we'll read a little bit later on but here it says if this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and the sacrifice unto the lord of hosts and shiloh and the two sons of eli hofney and phineas the priests of the lord were there and when the time was that elk and the offer he gave uh to pinanaya a peninnah a man his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions listen but unto hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved hannah but the lord had shut up her womb my god now we know it's the lord that actually shut up her womb because the husband is able to have children through another wife if the problem is not with the husband the problem is now with the wife glory to god amen look at this now hallelujah amen and her adversary now notice what the what what what the bible calls it this is the the other wife it's considered hannah's adversary amen and her adversary also provoked her store for to make her fret because the lord had shut up her womb and as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of the lord so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat now what i want you to get that every time she went to church amen her adversary was provoking her you know how many people stay home the day from church because every time they get ready to go the devil does something look at what happened here today amen the devil got to moving but that's not gonna stop us from worshiping god look at this look at this look at this amen says uh verse eight says then said elkanah amen her husband to her hannah why weepest now and why eat us down not and why is thy heart grief am not i better uh to thee than ten sons so hannah rose up after they had eaten in shiloh and after they had drunk now eli priest sat up on a seat by a post of the temple of the lord ma and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the lord and wept so i told you this is something that means a lot to me when i when i find a person that might be going through something about it where they're not able to have children amen uh one of the things that i watch not just how they come and ask for prayer i watch what they do after they get prayer amen amen we gotta watch hannah's response after hey man she was confident by her husband she went and began to pray herself glory to god when nobody else was looking she was praying amen i i believe if they had prayer meetings in her day hannah would have found herself amen at a prayer meeting if they said every tuesday night hannah would have been there every tuesday night if it was every other tuesday hannah would have been there because she's serious about what she wants she wants the reproach taken away and it's through prayer that these things change look at it she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the lord and wept soar and look at look at this and she vowed a foul i like this what because i don't it's not just you want a child what do you want a child for what's your purpose what you gonna do with the child amen some people want their children just so they can compete with other people it's the truth anyhow but that's not why god blesses your womb to have a child so you can compete with somebody else god wants you to raise that child in such a way that amen that they would they would they would have an impact on the kingdom of god oh hallelujah raise a singer that'll bring down the anointing raise a musician that'll bring down the anointing raise a preacher that'll preach the gospel raise a pastor's wife what you gonna do with this child what is your purpose for having a child she vowed a vow and said oh hallelujah i'm gonna tell you one thing if you can get rid of your selfish motive god can open up your womb oh hallelujah and she vowed to vow and said o lord of hosts if thou would indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid and remember me and not forget thy handmaid but will give unto thy handmaid a man child not now she asked for a son then i will give him unto the lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head he was going to be a nazarite amen she wanted him to be a christian let's put it that way amen no razors come upon his head and it came to pass as she continued praying before the lord that eli the priest now marked her mouth watch verse 13. now hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not hurt now she's completely misunderstood look at her now i mean can you imagine a woman in church just a mouth moving ain't nothing coming out now you gonna think something wrong with her her mouth just move her what in the world is wrong with this lady but they don't understand in her heart i might be misunderstood but god sees god sees what is and not only god sees but god hears the thing that you can't hear priests god can hear it nobody else heard it but god heard it and it caused the priest to say something to her she might have looked crazy mama sometimes i know you look crazy to your children but god sees god understands god hears yeah you might be misunderstood but god sees it oh glory to god look at this look at this hannah she spoke she spake in her heart not only only her lips move but a voice was not her therefore eli thought she had been drunken misunderstood and eli said unto her how long without be drunken put away thine wine from thee and hannah answered and said no my lord i am a woman of a sorrowful spirit i have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the lord count not thine handmade for a daughter of below that mean a worthless woman i'm not a worthless woman i might not have any children but i'm not a worthless woman oh hallelujah count not amen uh down handmade for a daughter below for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief i have spoken here the two then eli answered and said go in peace and the god of israel grant me thy petition that thou has asked of him and she said let thine handmaid find grace in that site so the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad she was misunderstood but god saw her and in seeing her he calls the priest to say something to him now i need to understand the priest never prayed for all he did was speak a word over her and by speaking that word over her god blessed her womb and she had a son that son was a prophet who later came back and corrected that priest god sees you may be misunderstood but i'm here to tell you god sees when nobody else understands why you talking to yourself because mamas have to do that quite often hey man maybe maybe the child has walked into the bedroom maybe just some mom just just maybe on their knees praying couldn't understand why mama was doing that she might have been misunderstood but but god saw god saw and god god has a way of answering your prayer just in the time that you need them to answer your prayer i love god god sees here there's a little quote here i want to read on this amen before we go to our next character this is not jehovah jiren brother branham says this could you imagine what would happen in phoenix today if an old man the age of abraham and sarah would go down the doctor and say now doctor we want to make room at the hospital because we're going to have a child where the doctor would say uh excuse me says uh uh and would call the the psychopathic ward to come pick him up because he says something's wrong every man that's truly steps out and trusts god is misunderstood every man that truly steps out and trusts god is misunderstood i want to say every mama that truly steps out and trusts god is misunderstood i i i know i got some mamas in here that don't walk by faith many of these didn't know how they was going to do this and how does it go through that all i can tell you right now just look around did he do it and if he did it before he'll do it again you have to walk by faith in some situations oh glory to god hey hallelujah they say you wouldn't get the house but you got it they say you wouldn't get the car but you got it you had to do some things by faith but god provided hallelujah it's every every man that truly steps out and trusts god is misunderstood so that's right hannah at the temple she was praying and you know what even the priest thought she was drunk she didn't go up to shiloh up there to see what kind of hats the women wore or who had who had moved and all about the neighborhood talk she went up there for one purpose that was for god to take away her reproach and she prayed she didn't care what the people thought and they misunderstood her she said will you will you always be drunk she said i'm not drunk my lord but i'm praying god take away my reproach watch the prophet said the lord give to thee uh and she raised up and blessed the lord and went home and had the child that was all that's how simple it is taking god at his word oh isn't he wonderful i like that all we got to do is take god at his word if god is giving you a promise hold on to it if god is given you a promise hold on to it here it is um i read the script a little early and we want to pick her up oh my hagar was misunderstood and um as we were just reading there amen in the scripture a little earlier we have to kind of understand what it what happened you know with hagar she was she was just a slave and she was there working doing her job she was not um if i can use these terms she was not getting fresh with abram she wasn't doing that oh praise the lord she she wasn't dressing up in a certain garments to try to get abram's attention y'all understand what i'm saying she she she one you know uh you know she wasn't she wasn't presenting herself in such a way to try to get the man of god's attention that this was not her this was not what hagar was doing she was simply doing her job and while she's working there's a suggestion made in abraham's tenth sarah makes the suggestion she says now i know you want a son i know you want a child abraham but abram but i'm not able to produce a child why don't you take hagar my my handmaid and have a child through her now this is a suggestion that is being made amen so abraham agrees with it sarai agrees with it and remember i told you back in those days amen polygamy was accepted it's not accepted anymore so don't be talking about trying to have two wives glory to god and then actually if you was honest with yourself you can barely handle the one wife that you got ain't nobody gonna say amen but it's a truth in it high glory to god if you can barely handle the one you got so what you talk about two and three for glory to god but here you know uh everybody agrees and even even even hagar has to submit herself to this and she becomes a legal wife to abraham she goes amen with abraham and she conceives the child and after she conceives a child then we have a survive she gets a little jealous about this she said no i shouldn't know that she said no no i should never came up with this idea you know i'm sorry i did this abraham now you can't take it back now we don't we got a child on the way you can't you can't apologize nassera say well abraham's saying that and i just you know i i'm just i'm kind of putting in today's terms of god on my abraham after you heard sarai say uh sir i do to her what you think should be done now abraham said i'ma just step out of this now you're the one suggesting it you're the one came up with this plan and now you want me to go and do something with with you do whatever you think you need to do with it i'ma just step out of this but the bible says she dealt very harshly with and here comes uh hey god taking off running you can imagine what the conversation must have been like in this household she took off running just and and when she took out running she know where she was going pregnant expected don't know where she going and when she's out here in a desert place oh my think about where she's at and here the angel lord went looking for her oh glory to god the age of god went looking for this woman hey i'm here to tell you the age of god is looking for you and i don't care where you go the angel will find you and the angel will make the prayer come to pass hear the angel we're looking for saying hey god where you at what you doing and you know where you're going and where where where you come from and where you're going so i'm fleeing from a man from sarai my master's wife i'm fleeing from her even the angel knew what had happened in the house now i need you to understand what happened to hagar was nothing that she produced on her own it's nothing that she caused on her it was her actions that produced this she was absolutely misunderstood she was absolutely misunderstood but when the angels showed up in the desert place it showed that god understood even though sarai might not have understood god himself understood and god told hey god now go back and submit yourself some of you some of you young people need to go back and submit yourself to hey man mama maybe maybe maybe you maybe you different with some of the advice that she gave but now it's time to go back and submit yourself to some of that advice just go back go back and submit yourself because then you you know you can have a son you're gonna name him ishmael and he's gonna be a wild man and and we can take it from that angle we realized you know uh that he was a wild man and even today some of the stuff that the children is oh my goodness it's unbelievable unbelievable uh you know we and we we bear with some of those things even today from the children of israel but none nonetheless even in the midst of that can we see the supernatural god watching over hey god amen as she's carrying a seed of abraham i want to pick this up in genesis um i want to pick up another part of this in genesis 21. oh blessed be the name of the lord let's pick up this genesis 21 verse 9. now hagar has gone back home hagar has submitted herself to sarah but there comes years later she's also hagar's giving birth to ishmael but years later sarah finally gets a visit from the from from the lord herself and she conceives and she has a child she has isaac the true promised son we realize this hallelujah but i want to just kind of go a little further and look at this this statement was misunderstood hagar didn't do anything wrong nothing wrong nothing she was just working but here um we pick up in verse 9. sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian but she had born unto abraham mocking wherefore she said unto abraham cast out this bonds woman and her son for the son of this bonds woman should not be heir with my son even with us sarah has another idea oh hallelujah y'all ain't gonna talk to me today but notice that sarai or sarah keep coming up with all these ideas okay i'm gonna tell y'all sarah something sarah sometimes you need to let your husband leave in certain situations i say amen to myself sarah you need to let your husband lead in some situations praise the lord but sarah keeps coming up with all these ideas amen watch it now watch watch what happens oh look at this look at this uh and the thing no verse 10 again wherefore senator abraham cast out this bonds woman and her son for the son of this bondwoman should not be heir with my son even with isaac watch it now and the thing was very grievous in abraham's sight because abraham did not want now look you don't put her out once before put out there and she come back home surrendered and submitted herself to you you you mishandled her you mistreated her you missed justin you did all these things and now you still come up want to put out again and i got a son abraham didn't want to do it now look at what happens look at what happens oh my god he says uh verse 11 god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because of that let me tell you if god would not have spoken abraham he probably would not have done it he said let it not be grievous in thy sight because the lad and because of thy bondwoman and all that sarah have said unto thee hearken unto her voice for an isaac shall thy seed be called let's go on and also the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation because he is thy seed god makes a promise to him amen and abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it up to hagar putting it on her shoulder oh my and the child sent her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of beersheba let me just just park let me just park there just for a sec can you imagine leaving home with a bottle of water and a piece of bread now i'm i'll just inject something else here at this moment oh hallelujah at this moment hagar just became a single mother she just lost all her resources she they lost everything that she had the the i mean the the the child's father's taking care of everything and because i have the child i mean he's taking care of me as well hallelujah i mean but at this moment she just became a single mama i'm gonna tell you something about single mamas i was just looking you know looking at some of the statistics on it amen and we have some single mothers amen by choice let me just give you all some of the stats on let me 11 million single-parent families in the u.s 11 million amen 80 percent of those 11 million families is headed by a single mother um 52 of the single mom family is never married 29 were divorced amen and and i wrote this down we know god doesn't like divorce but i want to encourage everyone amen to honor god's word oftentimes a person finds himself in a pretty bad position and they have to make tough decisions eighteen percent amen of women that that are any single single parent a single mother or homes 18 are widowed or separated they lose their resources and when this happens 23 percent of those families live in poverty here's another thing the median income for families by a single mother amen in 2020 and the median income was 49 000 a year amen well below when a married couple was together the median income was a hundred thousand dollars a year that means a single mother gonna make half as much as america you know what happens in a house like that the decisions get a lot tougher the children are impacted in ways that you never thought they'd be impacted mama can't do what amen what the the next door neighbor can do because they impacted and sometimes hey man sometimes it's by choice that single mothers are in conditions like that but other times they didn't they didn't make the choice they misunderstood i ain't choose to be like this hey doctor i ain't mad this was not i i had nothing to do with any of this and i can just imagine hagar in her prayer lord you told me you met me at a well and you told me to go back to sarah i went back god i raised my child i did everything you told me to do and here i'm kicked out again sometimes things get real difficult they get real tough mamas they get real tough for you i know i get tougher but i'm here to tell you that even when everybody else misunderstands god sees now i just love the way this this this i have a quote i'm not gonna i'm not i'm probably not gonna take time to read it but i'm gonna keep reading the scripture uh brother branham when he's bringing out this quote and it's in the message remember the lord i won't read it but it says that god met her at the well uh the lahara i can't even pronounce it right but uh but when you when we read it in genesis 16 that was the whale that she was met at but here brother brown was picking up the story amen in genesis uh genesis uh uh 21 and we're gonna see that you know after she goes through this another whale shows up watch this oh my oh my verse uh 15. here they are can you see the child out there with this bottle of water and bridge all the resources been cut off and this is what god told we know and we know we know the types that are in here we know that because the the seed of the bomb woman cannot be heir with a free woman oh my i we get we got that i can i can preach it from that angle but i didn't want to go there today i do want to say this that if god watched over the seat of the bond one if god provided for the seed of the bondwoman if god supernaturally visited the seed of the bondwoman what will god do for the free woman and we are represented as the free woman look at this verse 15 and the water was spent in the bottle she cast the child under one of the shrubs she went and sat set her down over against him a good way off as it were a bull shot this is the mother going through for she said let me not see the death of the child she said over against him and lift up her voice and wept she's over there crying but watch this and god heard the voice of the lad now now in this situation brother random tells us it wasn't even god hearing hagar's voice but god heard ishmael's voice and the reason god heard ishmael's voice because ishmael was a seed of abraham oh god hey mama let me tell you something god's gonna hear your child's voice when they get to that spot where they need to break they get desperate don't worry god down hear they force because they belong to you sometimes you gotta wait for life just to present certain circumstances and and cause them to have to cry out to god the reason that you serving god the way you from because you met some of those circumstances in life where you can turn to nobody but jesus and that's what made you the woman you are today that's what made you a praying woman you weren't born that way life circumstances made you that way and the same god that met you at your well is able to meet them at their will heard the voice of the lad and the angel of god called to hagar out of heaven said to her what elith hagar fear not but god have heard the voice of the lad where he is arise lift up the lad and hold him in thy hand for i will make him a great nation god given her promise oh my look at this and god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink and god was with the lad and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer and he dwelt in the wilderness of haram and his mother took him uh a wife out of land of people i just wanted to just kind of drop she was misunderstood she was misunderstood but every time that well would show up it was showing that god saw exactly what she was going through a well is your source of strength a well is your source of life god would always provide a well for hagar even though she was misunderstood i'm here to take and she is a bond woman if god provided for this bond woman mamas i mean the the you free women in here you you you you promised seed in here what what do you think god will do for you and for your loved ones or you don't have to doubt you might be misunderstood but god sees here i want to just kind of share just two other things here with you uh this is coming out of the message redemption and completeness enjoy redemption and completeness and joy i love this particular quote it says one time there was a woman in the bible by the name of hagar i'm thinking of her and i'm fixing the clothes time uh it closed the time there was a woman by the name of god she had a little baby she was turned down in the wilderness with one little cruise of water she fed the little thing all day long but the water gave out alone about the middle of the day and the little baby was screaming and crying his little lips was parched and his tongue was swelling a poor fearing mother what could she done she had seen every little place she could to find some water but no water could be found she couldn't stand to see the baby die so she laid it under a bush and went off about a boat shot and she knelt down and spanked to the rock and when she speak to the rock and angels speak back and said hey god what's that gushing out over there hey if you in a desert place just turn and go to the rock hallelujah thank god for that rock church amen hey god what's that gushing out over there there was a whole well full of water that's still running today after almost 4 000 years it's still running today the fountain which hagar there is still running today she spake to the rock and the rock brought the waters thank god she could go to iraq and now i'm telling you this is hagar who is a bondwoman just think about what god's gonna do for the free woman you might be misunderstood but god sees here i want to end my thought today with my favorite quotes out of mother's day we have many children today i i i want to say this before before i bring this up i'm going to paragraph 87 i believe in that uh we have we have many i want to say this about misunderstood but god sees one of the things that i wrote down is that this message that we believe has been misunderstood sometimes it's the way the message has been presented to people because it hasn't been presented properly and therefore the message becomes misunderstood sometimes the way we live the message causes people to misunderstand this message that we believe hallelujah amen but uh i want to just kind of show something here because many of us have loved ones that are in a situation today where maybe they're not in the in the way that you're raised one of the sisters just telling me and i just i just love this uh uh how god does things sister brown was telling me how her daughter got a job working got a really really good job and working and and her boss of boss that she's working with uh they got into a conversation they began to talk about church and and so sister be saying yeah i uh raise that brother west coast church in the in the boss city brother west coast you don't know no brother west coast yes i do know brother what's called raising this church you don't know brother wesko brother let's go over no you don't know brother what how would you know about brother west coast well we live right around the corner my dad just go to the church all the time here both of them both of them connected on the job that used to go to brother west coast church you think that's by coincidence i call it predestination sometimes you know our children are in situations and maybe they've made decisions and they made this decisions based on misunderstandings their minds are all tangled up you get to talking to them you can't get them to make no sense and you you can see it playing as day but for them it seemed to be just oh my goodness i i can't see it they they they they need their minds untangled now let me tell you something you can't do it but you can pray i believe uh jesus told peter to say flesh and blood have not revealed these things unto you but my father in heaven has all you got to do just stay with it god will bring them to it you might be misunderstood but god sees god sees and i don't care what they get themselves entangled with i don't care what religion they go trying to follow if you sold the seeds of this word and their life somehow some way they got to come right back to what was sown hey i feel good today church they got to come back to it i don't care how deep in the world they go you can't separate yourself from what was sown inside of you and mamas i just love on mother's day giving y'all this promise here out of this quote mother's day then as we see him we will not be as we are now we'll know how to love him more will not stand back with a little fear because we'll be like him well we'll uh he will be more of a relative to us than he is now we'll understand him better because we're so far away in the mortal bodies then we'll have a body like his glorious body we'll know how to worship him and when we see what the presence of his being has done to us changed us the old back young all the deformed straight now oh we'll understand then why his power healed us the questions that's been in our mind how can he do it what with this somehow mysteriously they'll fade away the knots that's been tied in the back of our minds will it be this how could it be somehow another majestic fingers would just untangle unravel those knots and it'll all fade into one big crown of love i like to give that to the mothers on mother's day i'm gonna keep going in this pope but i like you to understand somehow you don't have to try to explain it all you gotta try to break it down gotta break it down let majestic fingers god you told me you told me somehow majestic fingers was gonna unravel or not so god you do what only you can do then we shall see him then we shall be like him hallelujah then we shall worship him then we shall see mother as god wants her mother would not be complete there without her family oh come on somebody you know you know we've had some of our mothers have gone on to be with the lord and and we can stand there amen at the at the homegoing service and we can say oh i know my mama was a christian and i know my mama did this and i know my mama did that and i remember my uncle my cousin i should say call him uncle but he was at my grandmother's funeral and he heard he heard everybody just talk about how my grandmother was a stink my grandmother my grandfather and you know he was just he was just you know just just sitting there listening and uh he had to be honest with himself and uh you know everybody said no we're gonna see her again we're gonna see again she was digitally went to the other side we're gonna say now i know the way i'm living right now i will not see her again and it's time for us to be honest with ourselves the way you're living right now mama was to go on you ain't gonna see you again the way you live it but i love that somehow god got to until these these knots because look at this look at this look at this mother would not be complete there without her family it was it just happened wouldn't be happening if all mama's children weren't there you know how mama feel when all the children come together here at home now what you think she'll feel like when she gets to the other side mother oh come on somebody we we going beyond just going to church on mother's day oh that's just part of it but but but we talk about making it to the other side that that's what this whole thing is all about mama want to see her children make it to the other side mama want to see your children die with an assurance that is going to be all right mother would not be complete there without her family because the greatest time of all her life is to see the children around the table oh now can i can i can i'm gonna just i'ma just inject i'm almost done not just around the natural table mama like to see her children sitting around the spiritual table and then when we get to the natural table we can talk about the spiritual things that we heard no mama just don't want to talk about what happened in the news and this person died can you believe that mama no no no mama wanna talk about your soul mama when i was in church today god spoke this to me and mama i was praying and this happened man that changes the whole dynamics of the conversation when you're sitting together hey my mama don't have to what mama don't have to avoid talking about god around you oh y'all ain't gonna preach with me mama you talk too much about god no you misunderstand mama's trying to create an atmosphere for god to be able to come down oh god i don't have to just meet you at the church god can meet you in your house if you just begin to talk about mother will not be complete there without her family because the greatest time of all her life is to see her children around the teeth and all of them healthy and happy and see her pour the coffee or whatever she does and fix it sup but let me tell you if you you you you let everybody just doing what they need to do boy mom ain't got no problem getting that kitchen and whipping up something she'll put it together when you making mama happy she'll make you happy but my mom my mom kind of retired a little bit every once in a while especially come thanksgiving time we know what to expect mama going into the kitchen she gonna bring out some of the sweet potato pies gonna bring out a carrot cake german chocolate cake come on they don't know nothing about rutabagas people don't know people don't eat rutabagas no more but mama would go and find herself some rutabagas call it greeks right and my mama just had to wait sometime she don't even know if everybody's coming but mama was still thrown down in the kitchen and there's something about kids when they know mama done cooked you find you you make time to get by mama's house to eat a little something save some room to get a little something what mama could because she don't cook all the time like that if mama loves it when the family comes together but not just natural reunions mama want them to be ready for a spiritual reunion i'll tell you i've taken some mamas you might have been misunderstood along the journey but god saw it and god is creating a well springing up a well in the midst of this wilderness they'll be sustained sometimes mama want to see it before she died but if she don't see it before she die mama don't be there god sees i like to see the children around the table all of them help him happy and to see her pour the coffee whatever she does and fix his supper and her her and dad just sat down that's the happiest time in mama's life see y'all see her kid is all at home i've watched my mama just kind of and it's just something all all the all the cooking i even watched my wife do it now uh you know when your kids are there and everybody's at home you kind of take a lot of things for granted but man when they get up and start leaving every time amen my daughter and my son-in-law my grandson come over on thursday night my wife gonna have something cooked up if it ain't cooked up then i gotta go buy it but we're gonna have something in this house for these kids glory to god but it's something about when the kids come home it's something like when the kids come home spiritually it's something bite when the kids come that's the happiest time in mama's life see her kid is all at home some of y'all mama's right now think about some of your kids that's not then you can't wait to see them in church again they're coming home they're coming home god gonna make a way out of nowhere god gonna do it they coming home mama hey and you mamas that got kids here only for mothers they know they're gonna be here a lot more than that don't worry about it mama they coming home they're coming home don't be missing that day let the great chain of your family be hooked together link by link oh come on somebody start from the oldest and work their way down to the youngest but link by link let every spoke be in the wheel and then when we sit down with our families and groups across the canopies of eternity what a day that will be you might have misunderstood some things in life but the prophet said then will understand then we'll understand let's pray lord jesus god as we can just look at scripture and see these different women that have been misunderstood and are praying for a son the priest could not understand why she was there talking to herself she was in sinship prayer believing god that you would give her a child and she received the promise from the priests and walked away and not only did you bless her with samuel the prophet but oh god you're blessed with so many other children lord uh you're that type of god father as we look here at hagar a woman she did nothing wrong she was just working and god she became part of all this but lord in the midst of all of that all of it god you had a purpose and a plan for it and you provided for a bond woman how our faith should increase today to know that they're even when we look over the new testament there is no promise there for the bond woman he had to be cast out because the seed of the bondwoman is not heir with the free woman we are represented as that free woman oh god if you would make a way for a bond woman what will you do for us so i pray every mother would leave strengthened and encouraged god to know that uh no matter what it is that they're facing no matter what they're going through lord no matter what their families are going through god that they can hold you to every word that you spoke your word will not fail thank you that we serve a god that sees a god that knows a god that understands a god that is always present [Music] god we thank you i pray your blessed lord upon each and every one i ask that you would look upon the lord and the different fellowships that would happen father even after the service today lord may you be in the midst of all of it be in the midst of the conversation lord make a

mighty name of the lord jesus christ we ask it amen amen let's give the lord a hand of praise from solomon hallelujah happy mother's day to all the mothers amen god bless you want y'all standing help
