[9:32] life before our very eyes may the word
[9:34] that you speak this evening Lord just be
[9:37] written upon our hearts Lord and let us
[9:39] not just be hearers of the word but
[9:41] doers of your holy precious word thank
[9:43] you for letting us just gather here
[9:45] together Lord uh in your presence once
[9:47] again may you just have the preeminence
[9:49] Lord from the opening prayer to the
[9:50] ending prayer we ask all these things in
[9:52] Jesus Christ name we pray amen
[9:56] amen so let's open our Bibles to to
[10:01] um Exodus 14: 8 sorry verse 8 first say
[10:07] Amen when you get
[10:11] there how many believe the church is in
[10:13] Exodus
[10:14] today amen right to the promised land
[10:17] amen so we'll start at verse eight and
[10:21] the Lord hardened the heart of pharaoh
[10:23] king of Egypt and he pursued after the
[10:25] children of Israel and the children of
[10:27] Israel went without with out with a high
[10:30] hand but the Egyptians pursued after
[10:32] them all the horses and Chariots of
[10:34] Pharaoh's and the horsemen in his army
[10:36] and overtook them en camping by the Sea
[10:38] beside uh perro before uh bapon and when
[10:42] Pharaoh Drew nigh the children of Israel
[10:44] lifted up their eyes and behold the
[10:46] Egyptians marched after them and they
[10:48] were so afraid and the children of
[10:50] Israel Cried unto the Lord and they said
[10:52] unto Moses because there were no graves
[10:54] in Egypt hast thou taken us to die in
[10:57] the wilderness wherefore has thou dealt
[10:59] with us to carry us forth out of Egypt
[11:02] is not this the word that we uh did tell
[11:04] thee in Egypt saying let us alone that
[11:06] we may serve the Egyptians for it had
[11:08] been better for us to serve the
[11:09] Egyptians that we should die in the
[11:11] wilderness and Moses said unto the
[11:13] people fear ye not stand still and see
[11:16] the salvation of the Lord which he will
[11:19] show to you today for the Egyptians whom
[11:21] you've seen today you shall see them
[11:23] again no more forever you may be seated
[11:26] so we we just see a picture right there
[11:27] where the children of is Israel have
[11:30] finally gotten uh Liberation and freedom
[11:33] what they've been crying for and uh we
[11:35] see now that they're in a situation
[11:38] where they just see sea they just see
[11:40] behind them the enemy and right now they
[11:43] weren't looking by faith but they were
[11:44] looking by human emotions and so we see
[11:47] uh how the children of Israel reacted
[11:49] they said would would it be better for
[11:51] us just to be in Egypt serving them and
[11:54] but yet the very thing they were praying
[11:56] for was being fulfilled before their
[11:58] very eyes but they were scared to walk
[12:00] in what they prayed for and so I love
[12:03] what Moses said he he uh he didn't let
[12:06] the the gang saying of the people uh
[12:08] fear in him and he said unto the people
[12:11] fear ye not and stand still like we we a
[12:13] couple weeks ago we talked about be
[12:15] still and see the salvation of the Lord
[12:18] and we go to verse 14 the Lord shall
[12:21] fight for you and you shall hold your
[12:23] peace and we go to verse 15 the Lord
[12:25] said unto Moses wherefore criest thou
[12:28] unto me speak unto the children of
[12:30] Israel that they go forward so a lot of
[12:33] times there's a season to cry out to the
[12:35] Lord but there also a season that we got
[12:36] to walk in because if the word is living
[12:39] inside you you can speak that word and
[12:41] you got to believe that the word is
[12:42] living inside you because if Jesus
[12:44] Christ is living inside you then the
[12:46] word living inside you but the key is
[12:48] you got to make sure you're feeding upon
[12:50] the word of God so that word can stay
[12:52] fresh inside of you amen let's keep
[12:55] going go to verse 16 but lift up thy rod
[12:58] and stretch out thy hand Over the Sea
[13:00] and divide it and the children of Israel
[13:02] shall go on dry land dry ground through
[13:04] the midst of the sea and I and I behold
[13:06] I will harden the hearts of the
[13:08] Egyptians and they shall follow them and
[13:10] I will get me honor upon pharaoh and
[13:12] upon all his hosts and upon his chariots
[13:13] and upon his Horsemen and the Egyptians
[13:15] shall know that I am the Lord when I
[13:18] have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh upon
[13:19] the Chariots and upon the horsemen and
[13:21] the angel of God which went before the
[13:23] camp of Israel removed and went behind
[13:25] them and the pillar of the cloud went
[13:27] from before their face and stood behind
[13:28] them and it came between the the camp of
[13:31] the Egyptians and the camp of Israel and
[13:33] it was a cloud of Darkness to them so
[13:34] now look at this picture the children of
[13:37] Israel see that God is moving behind
[13:40] them protecting him it's like the armor
[13:41] of God you don't have anything behind
[13:43] you but it's God protecting behind you
[13:45] so we see that they're seeing this
[13:46] Supernatural Miracle but yet time after
[13:50] time we see during their Journey that
[13:51] they kept doubting God and and and
[13:54] thinking God couldn't take him but he he
[13:56] proved him that he was faithful time and
[13:58] time again so it shows me that just
[14:00] being in the Supernatural isn't enough
[14:03] but you got to receive what God is doing
[14:04] during that time in the Supernatural
[14:06] because they saw more things than we
[14:08] could ever see in our lifetime but yet
[14:11] they still failed to enter into the
[14:13] promised land so let's keep going we'll
[14:15] go to we'll jump to verse 21 and Moses
[14:17] stretched out his hand over the sea and
[14:19] the Lord caused the sea to go back by a
[14:21] strong East Wind that all the night made
[14:24] the sea dry land and the waters were
[14:25] divided so all night they were seeing
[14:26] this they were walking and seeing this
[14:28] and the children is went to the midst of
[14:29] the sea upon the dry ground and the
[14:31] waters were a wall unto them on the
[14:33] right hand and the left hand and we'll
[14:34] jump to um let's go to verse 26 and
[14:37] we'll stop at 28 and the Lord said unto
[14:39] Moses stretch out thy hand over the sea
[14:41] that the waters May Come Again upon the
[14:43] Egyptians upon their chariots and upon
[14:45] the horsemen and Moses stretched forth
[14:47] his hand over the sea and the Sea
[14:49] returned to his strength when the
[14:50] morning appeared and the Egyptians fled
[14:52] against it the Lord overthrew the
[14:54] Egyptians in the midst of the Sea and
[14:55] the waters returned and covered the
[14:57] Chariots and the horsemen and all the
[14:59] the host of pharaoh that came into the
[15:01] sea after them there remained not so
[15:02] much as one of them so God showed them
[15:05] that he was faithful once again God and
[15:08] their enemies they were in bondage for
[15:10] over 435 years they were no more and but
[15:14] yet as soon as they got out of that that
[15:17] that situation A a test came the waters
[15:20] were bitter they were thirsty and and
[15:22] and God had to show them once again even
[15:24] though they're complaining so now let's
[15:26] get right into we'll get right into a
[15:27] quote now so
[15:29] I love what brother Braham says in the
[15:31] Paradox in 1963 but if it's in the line
[15:33] of duty when God has commanded you to do
[15:36] something so I believe that God has
[15:38] commanded us to do something that we're
[15:39] in a a restoration season right and so
[15:43] like he said to Moses why cry to me
[15:45] speak to the children of Israel speak to
[15:47] the children people people today is
[15:49] crying all the time lord what next what
[15:52] next just speak and go forward that's
[15:54] right God has commissioned us to do
[15:56] something let's do it don't stand around
[15:58] and think about it how could it happen
[16:00] well this and that make any difference
[16:02] if God said do it anyhow he's still the
[16:06] god of Miracles so God is still the god
[16:09] of miracles in each one of our Lives
[16:11] he's he's still I mean us being here is
[16:13] a miracle just think of the life we used
[16:15] to live and what we are now that's a
[16:17] miracle in itself think about to to love
[16:20] your enemy with with perfect love that's
[16:22] a miracle within itself because human
[16:25] affili love can't go that far right
[16:27] right and so we just see that there's a
[16:30] time to cry out to God and there's a
[16:32] time to speak and walk forward cuz uh
[16:34] the Bible tells us that God likes to be
[16:36] reminded of his word the Bible even says
[16:39] that to bring your strong reasonings to
[16:41] God and so we all have strong reasonings
[16:43] I think a lot of times we're we're
[16:44] scared to take God out his word because
[16:47] if you do if you do take God out his
[16:48] word then he's going to fulfill his word
[16:51] constantly time and time again just like
[16:52] the children of Israel even with their
[16:54] unfaithfulness he still knew there was
[16:57] uh uh seed that he has to protect
[16:59] for for us to be here and so we see I
[17:01] want to get ahead of myself so let's go
[17:03] to Exodus 3 so we see in Exodus chapter
[17:07] 3 that this was the time to cry out to
[17:10] God and we'll see it right now he says
[17:12] verse 7 says and the Lord said I have
[17:14] surely seen the Affliction of my people
[17:17] which are in Egypt and I have heard
[17:19] their Cry by reasons of their Taskmaster
[17:22] so that was a time that they they cried
[17:24] and that was a perfect time but in the
[17:25] time of the Red Sea it was not a time to
[17:28] complain and cry it was time to go
[17:30] forward because God had commissioned
[17:32] Moses he he showed the children of
[17:34] Israel that he he he Liber this was a
[17:36] season Liberation and all they had to do
[17:38] was trust they saw all the the fleas and
[17:41] the the firstborns being dead in Egypt
[17:43] all the the light and ghost and all
[17:45] these things they saw so all they had to
[17:47] do was what trust God and move forward
[17:49] they may not understood how it's going
[17:51] to happen but I'm at this point they
[17:53] could see that God doesn't isn't uh
[17:56] Bound by human uh human ability
[17:59] God God can do anything he wants to do
[18:01] but yet they still fail to see what God
[18:03] can do even though Time and Time think
[18:06] sometimes that we've kind of we uh put
[18:09] God in this box or we kind of limit
[18:10] God's Powers but we can't limit God's
[18:13] Powers because we see what he's doing
[18:15] around the whole world right now we we
[18:17] see uh uh the the Believers he's brought
[18:20] back into the church and it's our family
[18:21] members and we saw the beautiful healing
[18:24] on on Sunday all these things that God
[18:25] is still doing that we can't limit go
[18:29] just to a couple things when God
[18:31] restores something he's going to full
[18:33] restoration so we got to walk in that
[18:35] full restoration don't be dissatisfied
[18:37] with uh this some things that he did but
[18:39] God is looking to do many things in your
[18:41] life we still got another what 6 and a
[18:43] half months left of this year let God do
[18:46] exceedingly and abundantly in your life
[18:48] right
[18:49] now amen amen amen for I know their
[18:53] sorrows and I am come down to deliver
[18:56] them so God knows your Sorrows he knows
[18:58] your pain all these things he says out
[19:00] of the hand of the Egyptians and bring
[19:02] them upto the land of a good land a
[19:04] large land to a land flowing with milk
[19:05] and honey and the place of the
[19:07] Canaanites and the hites and the
[19:08] amorites and the pites and the hites and
[19:10] the jezeb byes now therefore Behold The
[19:12] Cry of the children of Israel is come
[19:15] onto me I have seen the oppression
[19:17] whereof the Egyptians oppress them but
[19:20] but now we see the Red Sea show down and
[19:23] we see them a different story that the
[19:25] same crying they were doing they're
[19:26] crying and complaining now and and I
[19:28] think I think a lot of times complaining
[19:30] will always hinder your faith because
[19:33] you're no longer looking at God but
[19:35] you're looking at the complaint and and
[19:37] now you're wor you're worshiping the
[19:39] complaint instead of worshiping The God
[19:40] Who can get you out of the situation and
[19:43] we we can't put anything any God before
[19:45] God and a complaint is putting something
[19:47] before God because when you're
[19:49] complaining your attitude isn't good and
[19:52] God says the right mental attitude God
[19:54] is always looking at the attitude that
[19:56] you have to in order to fulfill his word
[19:58] in your life life amen and we notice
[20:00] that the children of Israel were
[20:02] wondering and questioning why why would
[20:04] God bring us to the situation why would
[20:06] God bring us to a sea where there's no
[20:09] access to get out and why would he God
[20:10] let the enemy come behind us because God
[20:13] is trying to what eliminate the enemy in
[20:15] your life the the the the thing that's
[20:17] going that's going to stop you but yet
[20:19] they were too blind to be able to see
[20:21] that and amen let's go to um we'll go to
[20:25] another quote now amen and every man
[20:27] that's born again in Christ Jesus check
[20:31] this out everything you have need of
[20:33] your healing I'm read this again every
[20:35] man that's born again in Christ Jesus
[20:37] everything you have need of your healing
[20:40] Satan will afflict you sure he will but
[20:42] everything you have need of uh in this
[20:44] whole life's journey is in you right
[20:47] then and you and we are planted in
[20:49] Christ Jesus you see what I mean when
[20:51] you're born again and the baptism of the
[20:53] Holy Ghost has come into your heart you
[20:55] have everything that you have need of
[20:57] for your journey the the only thing you
[20:59] have to do is start drinking pushing out
[21:02] I believe he hears my anal my analysis
[21:05] of Christ Jesus he's the inexhaustible
[21:07] Fountain of Life every man that's
[21:10] planted in him can drink and drink and
[21:12] push out and push out to every check
[21:15] this out every Redemptive blessing that
[21:18] God has promised belongs to you every
[21:21] Redemptive blessing that God has
[21:23] promised belongs to you and it's your
[21:26] personal property and the devil has
[21:28] hasn't got any tied to it at all he
[21:31] hasn't got any legal rights his legal
[21:34] rights was spoiled at Calvary so now
[21:37] when he says that that everything you
[21:39] have need of is inside of you only thing
[21:41] is waiting for to be uh is waiting to be
[21:43] gerz by the Holy Ghost because God has
[21:45] to bring that in in to life before you
[21:47] and so he says you got to drink and
[21:48] drink and drink you got to constantly be
[21:51] reading the word because this word has
[21:53] all these promises but it needs to be
[21:55] brought to life by God himself because
[21:58] no man can bring to life for you I can't
[22:00] bring to life or the Troy can't but the
[22:02] very God Of Heaven can bring it to life
[22:04] for you because God has given these
[22:06] promises personally to you every promise
[22:10] is your property don't let the enemy
[22:12] take it away because he has no legal
[22:14] rights anymore at Calvary Jesus took
[22:16] every legal right that he had he
[22:18] snatched it out his hands and now you
[22:20] have the the legal document to sign a
[22:23] check Jesus is giving you a checkbook
[22:26] whatever needs you have you fill it out
[22:28] and you give it in that situation amen
[22:32] then if we're God's children by Heir
[22:34] then Heirs of the Kingdom Heirs of
[22:35] Abraham then we shall walk as our Father
[22:37] Abraham walked and call those things
[22:40] which are not as though they were if God
[22:43] has said they were if God said they are
[22:45] then we don't know how it's going to be
[22:47] but God said so we just believe it and
[22:50] move forward walking by faith what a
[22:52] beautiful life we may not know how our
[22:54] restoration is going to happen in our
[22:56] life and all these things are going to
[22:57] change but we can walk by faith knowing
[22:59] that God makes everything beautiful in
[23:01] his time that's what the scripture says
[23:03] so your situation may be chaotic but God
[23:07] promised to make it beautiful because
[23:08] God doesn't leave things undone we serve
[23:11] a God who who makes everything work
[23:13] together for your good as Romans 8:28
[23:15] says just think about it think about
[23:18] Abraham a 100 years old yet many
[23:20] disappointments many upsets he had all
[23:23] like Christians do waiting on the
[23:25] promise but yet the Bible said that he
[23:28] stab Ed not at the promise of God
[23:30] through unbelief there's many things
[23:32] taking place famine distress and things
[23:35] happen but Abraham didn't stagger he
[23:37] still believed that God was going to
[23:39] give him that baby so there's going to
[23:41] be many things going to happen in our
[23:42] lives sicknesses and and disappointments
[23:46] and all you can name it but God is still
[23:49] faithful he's looking to see how you
[23:50] going to react to those things that are
[23:52] going to happen in your life are you
[23:53] going to just cow down and cry like the
[23:55] children of Israel or are you going to
[23:56] move forward in faith knowing that God
[23:58] is is going to change the situation that
[24:00] God is calling you to something much
[24:02] greater than what we realize he's
[24:03] calling us to he's calling us to higher
[24:05] Heights a more in Intimate more deep
[24:08] personal relationship with him so he can
[24:10] show us more things and what am I trying
[24:12] to say you've got to go back to the word
[24:15] of God to get back restoration right as
[24:19] brother Jack started the year off he
[24:20] said that we got to get back in step
[24:22] when we get back in Step guess what
[24:24] happens restoration happens we got to
[24:26] get back in our position our l the duty
[24:29] because if a army is fighting in a
[24:31] battle and and everybody's on this way
[24:33] and that way nobody's in harmony then
[24:35] they're not going to win the battle so
[24:37] the same thing with us we all have to be
[24:38] in harmony if we want to see things
[24:40] change in the M our midst in our church
[24:42] I believe Sunday was a little taste a
[24:45] little taste of what God has to come cuz
[24:48] I I just love the the the presence of
[24:50] the Lord there and just bringing us
[24:51] together and love one another and we got
[24:53] to we got to uh build momentum from that
[24:56] don't just let that be the climax of
[24:58] what God's doing because God that's not
[24:59] his climax he has much more for us in
[25:02] store but we have to walk into that amen
[25:07] amen let's go to Ecclesiastes chapter 3
[25:10] and read verses um we'll read verses 1-9
[25:13] this is very familiar scripture I'm I'm
[25:14] pretty sure everyone uh knows about this
[25:18] scripture
[25:23] amen so the Bible says in verse one I
[25:26] love how it just right off the bat to
[25:28] everything there is a season and a time
[25:31] to every purpose under the heaven God
[25:33] chose this word restoration for this
[25:35] season because this was the perfect
[25:38] season for it he couldn't choose last
[25:40] year he didn't choose the year before
[25:42] but this was the perfect season for
[25:44] Restoration in our midst it may not be
[25:47] for somebody else might get this word
[25:49] but this word is for us and so we got to
[25:51] walk in that this season of restoration
[25:54] a time to be born a time to die a time
[25:57] to plant and a time to pluck up that
[25:59] which is planted A Time to Kill and a
[26:02] time to heal a time to break down and a
[26:04] time to build up a time to weep and a
[26:07] time to laugh a time to mourn and a time
[26:09] to dance a time to Cast Away stones and
[26:12] a time to gather Stones together a time
[26:15] to embrace and a time to refrain from
[26:17] embracing a time to get and a time to
[26:20] lose a time to keep and a time to Cast
[26:22] Away a time to Rend and a time to Sue
[26:25] and a a time to keep silence and a time
[26:27] to speak a time to love and a time to
[26:30] hate a time of war and a time of Peace
[26:33] what profit hath he that worketh in that
[26:35] wherein he labor so we just see that
[26:37] there's a season for everything and we
[26:40] got to recognize that we're in this
[26:42] season where we got to speak we got to
[26:45] speak back the word of God we got to
[26:47] speak our our financial Deliverance our
[26:49] Liberation maybe something in your life
[26:51] that's been been bound all these years
[26:53] and it's a time to be free of it God
[26:55] doesn't want to see us in bondage he he
[26:58] doesn't whether it's Financial bondage
[27:00] where you have you have some vices or
[27:02] some issues family issues God doesn't
[27:04] want to see that all your life God want
[27:06] to see you take his word I said this
[27:08] before a long time ago but God has given
[27:11] us the authority to speak peace in a
[27:13] situation cuz the Bible says a soft
[27:15] answer turth away wrath he's given us
[27:17] the ability to speak joy into a
[27:19] situation all all these things he's
[27:21] given a Sons and Daughters of God this
[27:24] is the time to utilize them in this
[27:25] season because speak he told the same
[27:28] thing to Moses why cry speak and that's
[27:31] what we got to start doing uh it's good
[27:34] to cry in certain situations but it's a
[27:36] time that God is looking to see are you
[27:38] going to use the word that I've given
[27:39] you I've given you everything you need
[27:42] I've given you the most powerful weapon
[27:43] on Earth which is my word and we got to
[27:46] be willing to to use that word
[27:49] amen so so we just not notice let's go
[27:52] back to the children of Israel again
[27:53] notice there was a time to cry when they
[27:55] were in bondage right Egypt but at the
[27:57] moment the Red Sea Showdown it was not a
[27:59] time to cry they saw God do things but
[28:02] the thing was they had a big habit of
[28:05] looking at their situation every time
[28:08] they would doubt God they'll be they'll
[28:09] be putting the situation over God and
[28:12] that's why many times that got they died
[28:14] the Brazen serpent uh they're
[28:16] complaining about the Mana see all these
[28:18] things they were complaining about but
[28:21] yet they asked to be out of Egypt they
[28:23] they literally asked God they cried for
[28:26] hundreds of years to be out of Egypt but
[28:28] yet when they got out of Egypt they were
[28:31] ungrateful and that's one thing God
[28:33] doesn't like to see is ungratefulness
[28:35] because God didn't have to do anything
[28:37] for us he did it because he loved us and
[28:40] so we should be thankful for what we get
[28:43] see a lot of times we're looking at
[28:44] things we don't need and God has given
[28:46] the things you need in your life and and
[28:49] we need restoration we need his
[28:52] restoration and if we want to be in the
[28:54] kingdom of God we need to be restored
[28:56] back to who we were because this body
[28:58] you see me is not who I really am the
[29:00] body I see you is not who who we really
[29:02] are what who we really are is inside of
[29:03] here amen let's go to numbers we go to
[29:07] numbers 13 read verses 30 through
[29:10] 33 and Caleb so before I guess we'll
[29:13] paint a little picture so before um this
[29:15] moment where Caleb and Joshua were about
[29:17] to talk um the children of Israel uh
[29:20] they they picked out 12 Spies and they
[29:23] got a chance to see the land that God
[29:24] had promised them and it was all the
[29:27] land they was all that God said the
[29:29] grapes and and the land full of milk and
[29:31] honey all these things and then now is
[29:33] the time of Showdown where they're going
[29:35] to give a report of what they saw and
[29:38] Caleb steal the people before Moses and
[29:40] said let us go up at once and possess it
[29:43] for we are able to overcome it so Caleb
[29:47] and Joshua the same things that they saw
[29:49] the other 10 spies saw they saw but what
[29:53] they saw was that that God promised this
[29:56] land he said he's going to be with us
[29:58] he's going to send his Angel before us
[29:59] and this is land is for us but the other
[30:02] 10 spies they saw the obstacles and the
[30:05] Giants and instead of walking by faith
[30:07] they were walking by fear and every time
[30:10] you walk by fear God can't fulfill
[30:12] anything in your life because once again
[30:14] you're putting fear above Faith so let's
[30:17] keep going in the scripture says but the
[30:19] men that went with him said we be not
[30:21] able to go up against the people for
[30:23] they are stronger than we see that may
[30:26] be true but God is stronger than all
[30:29] that yeah you can't do it physically
[30:31] yeah if you go out there physically and
[30:32] try to fight him you will die but God
[30:34] didn't say you physically had to go do
[30:36] it and die he said I'll go with you he
[30:39] he even we'll get a little later down in
[30:40] the sermon what what he actually told to
[30:42] him but um and he said they are stronger
[30:45] than we and brought up into evil report
[30:47] of the land which they had searched unto
[30:48] the children of Israel saying the land
[30:50] through which we have gone to search is
[30:52] a land that eateth up the inhabitants
[30:54] therefore and all the people that we saw
[30:56] in it are men of great stature and they
[30:58] saw the Giants and the sons of anch
[31:00] which come of the Giants we were in our
[31:03] own sight as Grasshoppers and so we are
[31:05] were in their sight I want you to
[31:07] remember that God told them exactly how
[31:10] he's going to take them to the land he
[31:11] literally broke it down how exactly
[31:14] they're going to get the land and yet
[31:16] they forgot that he said that and we'll
[31:18] get a little later in that scripture of
[31:19] when he said that so now let's go to
[31:21] numbers 14 so I just love that I love
[31:25] the atmosphere that Caleb and Joshua
[31:26] were in the atmosphere of unbelief of
[31:29] fear of their life being threatened they
[31:32] still kept the atmosphere of Faith they
[31:35] didn't let a bunch of game singers and
[31:37] doubters affect their personal walk with
[31:40] God because they knew the god that they
[31:42] saw was going to do the same thing he
[31:44] did in Egypt he did in the Red Sea he's
[31:46] doing the same exact thing in situation
[31:48] and I love too how that even it was we
[31:51] could say it wasn't fair they had to
[31:52] walk 40 years but I don't see Joshua and
[31:54] Caleb complaining that they had to walk
[31:56] another 40 more years and in fact I I
[31:58] believe they were even stronger after
[32:01] those 40 years getting the land that God
[32:04] promised them so that's something we
[32:06] could look at as an example that if they
[32:09] didn't let their faith get hindered then
[32:10] who are we to let our faith get hindered
[32:12] because they could they could walk they
[32:14] and they didn't have the Holy Ghost they
[32:16] weren't filled with the Holy Ghost but
[32:17] they could still stand upon the word of
[32:19] God and we got Christ Living inside of
[32:21] us the hope of glory so what excuse do
[32:24] we have let's keep going let's go to um
[32:26] verse one and all the congregation
[32:28] lifted up their voices and cried and the
[32:30] people wept that night so look they're
[32:32] crying again once again not that season
[32:35] to cry and complain never ceasing to cry
[32:38] and complain and all the children of
[32:39] Israel murmured against Moses and
[32:41] against Aaron and the whole congregation
[32:43] said unto them would God that we had
[32:45] died in the land of Egypt look they said
[32:46] it
[32:47] again again they saying this very same
[32:50] thing God took you out in the Red Sea
[32:52] and yet you complaining again the land
[32:54] of Egypt or where God had died in the
[32:56] wilderness one one thing we will always
[32:59] always kill our faith is is complaining
[33:01] every time and wherefore let's go to the
[33:02] next verse and wherefore ha the Lord
[33:04] brought us into this land to Fall by the
[33:06] sword uh and our wives and our children
[33:08] should be prey were it better for us to
[33:10] return into Egypt and Aaron fell on
[33:13] their faces before the Assembly of the
[33:14] congregation of the children of Israel
[33:16] and Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the
[33:19] son of Jeff which were of them that
[33:21] searched the land rent their clothes
[33:22] look what they said right here he said
[33:25] and they spake unto all the company of
[33:27] the children of Israel saying the land
[33:29] which we possess through the search it
[33:32] is exceedingly good land if the Lord
[33:35] Delight in us then he will bring us into
[33:37] the land and give us the land which
[33:39] floweth with milk and honey only he's
[33:41] giv a warning right here only Rebel not
[33:44] ye against the Lord neither fear ye the
[33:46] people of the land for they are bread
[33:48] for us their defense is departed from
[33:51] them and the Lord Is With Us fear them
[33:53] not so Joshua and Caleb weren't looking
[33:55] at their stature what looking at their
[33:58] weapons their Armory but they were
[34:00] looking at God because it don't matter
[34:02] how big you are how strong you think you
[34:04] are God can knock you down like you're
[34:06] nothing and so we got to remember that
[34:09] it doesn't matter if if work's going
[34:10] against you if your whole family's going
[34:12] against you if whoever's going against
[34:13] you if God is for you who can be against
[34:16] you the devil can send a thousand
[34:18] thousand men Army to your doorstep and
[34:20] just like we saw the Prophet Elijah he
[34:23] had those angels fighting for him and he
[34:25] opened gaz's eyes and he saw those
[34:27] angels is fighting so the same thing
[34:29] God's fighting for you no matter what
[34:31] you're going through let's go to verse
[34:32] 10 amen but all the congregation B SN
[34:35] and stoned them with stones and the
[34:37] glory of the Lord appeared in a
[34:38] tabernacle of a congregation before all
[34:40] the children of Israel so I want you to
[34:41] notice that they were still standing
[34:43] strong even though they're going to get
[34:44] stoned in the situation and so it shows
[34:47] me that your your walk shouldn't be
[34:49] based upon somebody else's walk because
[34:53] not everybody can see what you see in a
[34:56] certain time and season and and I'm
[34:58] pretty sure when we first give our
[34:59] hearts to the Lord and walk into the
[35:00] message of the hour our family didn't
[35:02] agree with it I remember I got kicked
[35:04] out my house for believing the message
[35:06] of the hour but one thing I didn't let
[35:08] that stop me I was homeless for a second
[35:09] not for a second but my my uh I got
[35:11] moveing with my grandma but I didn't
[35:12] know where I was going to go but I knew
[35:14] God was going to give me a place to stay
[35:16] and he gave me a place like three hours
[35:18] later I had like I had a place to stay
[35:20] and and so it's just like having that
[35:21] faith in God uh no matter what so if we
[35:24] had Faith to believe a message that we
[35:26] never heard before and and to serve a
[35:28] God who we never served before and we he
[35:31] showed us time and time again that he
[35:33] can be trusted that that he can change a
[35:35] situation at any given moment then we
[35:38] got to keep walking in what he's telling
[35:39] us to walk into because God's telling us
[35:42] this is the season where I I need to
[35:44] restore you I need to bring things back
[35:47] to to to to the the fullness of them
[35:50] amen let's keep going amen so one thing
[35:54] I noticed uh when Joshua's name is
[35:56] always mentioned it says says Joshua the
[35:58] son of nun and and so I looked that up
[36:00] in the Hebrew uh the word nun it means
[36:03] faithful one so I I just looking that
[36:05] Joshua and his dad was the faithful one
[36:08] so I'm I'm believing this that that uh
[36:11] that his dad this is just told him
[36:14] constantly and constantly how that they
[36:16] were going to be delivered one day and
[36:18] this and that and and maybe even though
[36:20] he didn't get to see it but his son got
[36:22] to see it and I believe that he he
[36:24] rubbed off on his his son because that
[36:27] name means faithful one and when I see
[36:29] Joshua he's a faithful one he he in the
[36:32] midst with everybody going against him
[36:34] he still stand he still stood strong
[36:36] with Caleb and Moses and Aaron even
[36:38] though there was no place to stand he
[36:40] still stood upon the rock amen let's go
[36:43] to Exodus 23 so I was explaining later
[36:46] or explaining earlier how that that God
[36:48] literally told the children of Israel
[36:51] how he's going to take him into the land
[36:52] like he literally told them exactly how
[36:55] how he's going to do it but yet they
[36:57] failed to to take God of his word and
[36:59] we'll start here in uh verse
[37:01] 20 so it said the Bible says in verse 20
[37:04] behold I send an angel before thee to
[37:07] keep thee in the way I I think that'll
[37:09] be enough for me if God say he sent an
[37:11] angel before me I think that's enough I
[37:13] could have enough Faith to believe that
[37:15] whatever comes in my way I can walk
[37:17] through it because he sent an angel
[37:18] before me and he said to keep thee in
[37:21] the way and to bring thee into the place
[37:22] which I have prepared beware of him now
[37:25] giving them a warning right here beware
[37:27] of him and obey his voice provoke him
[37:29] not for he will not pardon your
[37:31] transgressions for my name is in him but
[37:35] if thou shall indeed obey his voice
[37:38] obedience is better than sacrifice right
[37:40] amen and do all that I speak that then I
[37:44] will be an enemy unto thy enemies and an
[37:46] adversary unto thy adversaries just look
[37:48] at that promise right there I believe
[37:49] that promise is still going on today for
[37:51] us for my angel shall go before thee and
[37:54] bring thee unto the amorites and the
[37:56] hies and the pites and the Canaanites
[37:58] and the Hittites and the jezeb byes and
[38:00] I will cut them off th Thou shalt not
[38:03] bow down to their gods nor serve them
[38:05] nor do their works but Thou shalt
[38:07] utterly overthrow them and quite break
[38:09] down their images and He Shall Serve the
[38:11] Lord your God and he shall bless thee
[38:14] bless thy bread and thy water and I will
[38:16] take sickness away from the midst of
[38:17] thee there shall nothing cast their
[38:20] young nor Barren in thy land the numbers
[38:21] of thy days I will fulfill verse 27 I
[38:24] will send my fear before thee and will
[38:26] destroy all the people to whom Thou
[38:28] shalt come and I will make that all thy
[38:30] enemies turn their backs unto thee and I
[38:32] will send Hornets before thee which
[38:34] shall drive out the hivites and the
[38:36] Canaanites and the hites before Thee I
[38:38] will not drive them out before thee in
[38:39] one year lest th become the land become
[38:41] desolate and the Beast of the field
[38:43] multiply against the so so God does
[38:45] everything perfect so there's certain
[38:47] things that he can't take out your life
[38:49] for in a certain season because you're
[38:51] not you're not ready for because if he
[38:53] did it's going to utterly destroy you
[38:55] and so we see now that God is a the
[38:57] perfect season for us to be in
[38:59] restoration because we couldn't take it
[39:01] last year because we weren't ready yet
[39:03] but this year as we see the building is
[39:05] coming closer and closer you see what
[39:08] got guys at Sunday school we got adult
[39:10] Sunday school and a kids Sunday school
[39:12] we see all these things is happening
[39:14] slowly God is building our ranks our
[39:16] numbers our church is growing people are
[39:18] moving here and God is doing all these
[39:20] things before the great Exodus we go
[39:22] into the church because God is taking us
[39:24] into that church this year I I believe
[39:26] it by faith I'm claiming it by faith and
[39:29] so God doesn't God just doesn't start
[39:31] doing things and things start happening
[39:33] like this just just to do it but it's a
[39:35] perfect purpose behind it it's a season
[39:37] for us to happen and so we got to just
[39:39] be thankful that that God is looking at
[39:41] our faithfulness in this little church
[39:42] yeah we may we maybe we don't want to
[39:44] break down every service but I rather be
[39:46] break down every service and have a
[39:48] place to have a church than not have a
[39:49] church because God has blessed us with
[39:52] this this beautiful building it's not
[39:54] about the building you're in but we're
[39:55] the church all right we we can have
[39:57] church in the parking lot we can have
[39:59] church wherever we wherever we can but
[40:02] I'm thankful that we're here today
[40:03] because God has taken us step by step by
[40:06] step this is a build a building step
[40:08] till we get to our our building amen so
[40:11] like I said before we just see in the
[40:13] scripture how God broke it down plainly
[40:15] to them it was almost like a
[40:16] step-by-step GPS but yet they still
[40:19] couldn't fall into Faith because the
[40:21] Bible tells us that they uh they didn't
[40:23] enter in because their unbelief that the
[40:25] the word wasn't mixed with faith in them
[40:27] and so we got to mix our faith with the
[40:29] the word because the word is forever
[40:31] settled in heaven when when God speaks
[40:33] something it's going to happen whether
[40:35] it's next week or next year it's going
[40:36] to happen no matter what but Jo faith
[40:38] has to line into it see the word I said
[40:40] this before the word of God is not going
[40:42] to conform to your unbelief but you got
[40:44] to conform to the word of God see we see
[40:47] all the all these things I heard
[40:48] churches now are having bars and alcohol
[40:52] served in there and and and like what is
[40:55] that I I visited this church one time it
[40:57] had a you walk in it's a fullsize soccer
[41:00] field I'm like are we like is this
[41:02] church or is this a like a sporting
[41:05] event and and so I see all these things
[41:07] where the church the churches of these
[41:09] days are trying to compromise to the
[41:11] people because they want numbers and the
[41:14] thing is it's not about numbers cuz we
[41:16] see Joshua and Caleb if they looked
[41:18] about the numbers it was just a two
[41:19] people think about that two out of a
[41:21] million people and and so it's not about
[41:24] numbers always it's it's about the
[41:25] quality of the people I believe we got
[41:28] quality people here I believe we got
[41:30] born again Holy Ghost filled Christians
[41:32] in this church and I I believe we're all
[41:34] walking into that new building together
[41:36] amen amen amen so one more quote here
[41:41] and then we'll close here in next couple
[41:43] minutes so like like I see once again I
[41:46] just see these scriptures here this just
[41:49] laid out to us and the Bible says
[41:51] they're given to be in amples for us and
[41:54] it says in Hebrews it talks about how
[41:56] that that we can we can have that same
[41:58] type of uh issue if we don't hearken
[42:01] into what God's saying to us because
[42:03] we're not exempt for that we we make
[42:05] Free Will and free choices every day so
[42:07] we got to make the choice to to walk in
[42:09] what God's speaking to us and we got to
[42:11] make the choice to serve God each day
[42:13] see it doesn't matter how good of a week
[42:14] you had last week what matters is what
[42:17] are you going to do today with the life
[42:19] that God has G say again what are you
[42:21] going to do today with the life that God
[42:23] has giv you today cuz that's the most
[42:25] important thing I believe if you ask God
[42:26] for your heart and say Lord what do you
[42:29] want me to do today I believe he'll lead
[42:31] you and guide you to that because our
[42:33] heart needs to be to to to to uh help
[42:36] his the furtherance of his kingdom
[42:39] because he he used somebody to bring us
[42:41] the kingdom and so we ought to be used
[42:43] by God to bring somebody else that light
[42:45] hey they may not accept it that's okay
[42:47] but the thing is I'd rather bring the
[42:50] light to him so they make that choice
[42:51] and me not to bring that brother Bram
[42:53] said this statement he doesn't want to
[42:54] he didn't want to be um oh yeah he
[42:56] didn't want to be in the day of judgment
[42:58] and say the person say why didn't you
[42:59] tell me why didn't you give me a chance
[43:02] I want to be like Paul and said my hands
[43:03] are clean I I I I I I did everything I
[43:07] could I I I became thing all things to
[43:10] all men that I might win some and the
[43:12] thing is you're going to win some you
[43:13] might one one out of a 100 you never
[43:15] know but the thing is I rather have one
[43:17] Soul than no souls because the prophet
[43:20] said that one soul is what worth more
[43:23] than 10,000 worlds so you were worth
[43:25] more than 10,000 worlds to God think
[43:27] about that and that's a lot of Worlds
[43:29] right there think about that imagine
[43:30] 10,000 Earths that's a lot amen amen so
[43:35] like I said and
[43:37] God understands our Frailty our mistakes
[43:40] and mishaps and God understands those
[43:43] things but we can't use our human uh
[43:46] failures or our human our humanness to
[43:48] be an excuse a lot of times we'll we'll
[43:50] use oh God knows my heart yeah he knows
[43:52] your heart but don't use it as a crutch
[43:54] just to do what you want to do because
[43:56] God is looking to see God puts us in
[43:59] certain situations to see how we're
[44:01] going to handle it he he he may increase
[44:03] our workload he may whatever he may some
[44:06] family problems might arise up and he's
[44:07] looking to see what we're going to do in
[44:09] that situation and that's where the test
[44:11] really happens because the the I'll tell
[44:13] you this we're not going to get any less
[44:14] busier we're going to get more busy as
[44:17] as the world gets darker and darker
[44:18] we're get more busier and busier and
[44:19] God's looking to see how we're going to
[44:21] use that that time because we can use
[44:24] the excuse of I'm too busy to pray uh
[44:26] with quality or I'm too busy to read
[44:28] with quality we can make all these
[44:30] excuses but the only person is going to
[44:32] hinder is yourself and so we like I said
[44:35] always say before we got to carve time
[44:36] out because if we want restoration we
[44:39] got to make time for restoration because
[44:41] God made time to give us this word so we
[44:43] got to make time to walk in that word
[44:45] because we got to catch that Vision the
[44:47] Bible says the people perish without a
[44:49] vision so we need to walk in the vision
[44:51] that God has given us and that vision is
[44:54] is going to bring fruit every time God
[44:56] speaks is going to bring fruit and God
[44:58] is looking to see the fruit in our life
[45:00] because it even says in John how that we
[45:02] got to be connected to the vine and if
[45:04] we're connected to the vine the
[45:06] restoration's yours I don't care what
[45:08] the devil says I don't care what he
[45:09] brings before you if you're connected to
[45:11] the vine the restoration is yours and
[45:14] God will bring it to pass just in
[45:15] closing I'll read this this last quote
[45:18] we thank thee for the pillar of fire
[45:20] moving with us today who we thank thee
[45:23] for the signs and wonders we thank thee
[45:25] for the restored Mana of Glory the
[45:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost to be every
[45:30] generation we thank thee that we have
[45:32] tasted and seen the Lord is good oh God
[45:35] grant that every heart will be molded
[45:38] into one great big unit of the Holy
[45:41] Ghost that the that Holy Ghost Church
[45:43] will move forward I believe he's
[45:44] speaking to us and the power of God will
[45:46] sweep into this building right now and
[45:48] baptize every believer baptize save
[45:50] every sinner heal every sick person Lord
[45:53] and get glory for thy name's sake in
[45:54] Jesus Christ's name we pray let's say
[45:57] let's bow our heads in a word of prayer
[45:59] and we'll just just uh thank God dear
[46:01] Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for this
[46:03] Precious Moment Lord this precious

[46:27] just bring Restoration in each one of
[46:28] our Lives Lord just restore back the the
[46:31] the brotherly kindness Lord restore back
[46:34] the love Lord in families Lord just help
[46:37] us Lord just to to not be a hindrance
[46:40] Lord but to be a help to uh this this
[46:42] season of restoration Lord because oh
[46:45] God we're looking for big things to
[46:47] happen Lord and I remember our pastor

[46:54] mighty Miracles still Lord you still
[46:56] operating the gifts Lord of your Bible

[47:29] new church lord it's going to be
[47:31] miraculous lord it's going to be a
[47:33] breath of of fresh air Lord and father
[47:36] may we be faithful until that very
[47:38] moment we walk in Lord and after that
[47:40] moment let us be even more faithful Lord
[47:42] because father you you hear what we pray
[47:44] for how we want a building Lord and what
[47:45] you're doing right now Lord you're
[47:47] setting it up in order so we can walk in
[47:49] I I just think of a Time Lord when when
[47:51] Paul had to go through a window Lord you
[47:54] made that window just specifically for
[47:56] him to get Lord out Lord and that church
[47:58] that you have for us is specifically fit
[48:00] for us Lord You're just waiting for that
[48:02] perfect moment to give it to us Lord and
[48:05] God we we just want to wait patiently
[48:06] for you Lord because father your timing
[48:09] is always perfect Lord You're a god of
[48:12] perfect timing Lord may we just have the
[48:14] patience Lord may we have the faith of
[48:16] Abraham Lord and had the patience of
[48:18] Daniel Lord just to think that that your
[48:20] servant Daniel he waited 21 days father
[48:22] may we have that type of patience Lord
[48:24] like Daniel Lord and father the Lord is
[48:26] waiting upon you Lord because you're
