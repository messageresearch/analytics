iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for I acknowledge my transgressions transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee thee only have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judges behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desires truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part that shall make me to know wisdom purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice hide that face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities creating me a clean heart O God and renew a right spirit within me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy

brothers now late my brothers in Christ and they my brother-in-law's with him and brother Jack Carl it's hard to tell them no I can't do it you know why why I might start crying in here in a minute I feel the walls of blurry right now and those those guys stuck with me and stuck by me when I first got converted and they used to travel to come and get me to the church those things I could never forget I remember when I first met him tanya was here like this and they come up the bone to pick me up the brain moved to West Palm Beach and they did it and I didn't complain they didn't ask for money they didn't ask for anything mate they did it and so I appreciate that so anytime Jack needs me I'm I'm always here for me because one thing I know about jack he'd give me the shirt off his back and he just got a great heart so that's why I'm here that's why any time we go out of town I got I got my son I could always need the church to and I you know because Jack he got his wee-wee funny you

mess I hope I give you the Word of God but I tell you what man Wednesday night we had church man then then oh man I was like tre forget this mic for me man I tell you what I just felt like preaching Jack would say Amen I just was a wonderful pool I went home Thursday night I was priest I said my own old church I had a good time it's better than future like looking at me like oh come up in here with that stuff we had a good time on Thursday amen let us let us remember Jack in prayer and let us turn to the book of Revelation chapter 2 and we just see how the Lord lead it's good to see everybody this morning and just pray for us with trusting God oh I just bless us this morning revelations chapter 2 of you have a saying man it's starting at the first verse it says unto the Angel of the Church of Ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I know that works in our labors and our patience and how about cannot spare them which are evil and has tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them Elias and hath born and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first work as I will come to thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of that place except I repent but this Dow hash that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also hate he that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God let us bow our heads for a word of Prayer gracious Heavenly Father we just thank you this morning for your sovereign grace and your mercy and for just opportunity to be here this morning to stand in the in the gap and to be able to say something to the purchase of the bride and we just want to remember brother Jack continue keep them protect it and bring them back safely and we just think your father things in Jesus name Amen amen may be seated see also before I get started well tell you what young sisters I enjoyed that stone I definitely enjoyed that I like to break down they went in the fall seven just man I think I always I always have to mess with my nieces and tell them they starting to really reach in there and grab who they are I won't say what I acts say cuz I want nobody to get offended sometimes you offend people but I just enjoyed that this morning we we want to use as a little topic stay on guard stay on guard I wanna I wanna try to encourage us enlighten us to the hour and the age and the time that we're living in we're we're in spiritual warfare we're you know we're in a battle spiritually this is this is definitely not a relaxing time this is definitely not the time for the believers to relax is the time to prevail right this that's the hour that we're living in what we're finding is so many people are letting down their guard churches have let down the bar let down let down the standard really have gotten away from God I'm priest this morning now I'm started out slow but we're going we gonna break some bread this morning we but one of the things we don't realize by doing that the detriment what has happened to the church we don't see by doing so this is the reason why the churches in the condition that it's in and it and it really does not outside of you know people see a lot of emotions and sensations and people in the building but it does not resemble the original church that started at Pentecost right we got people in buildings we got people shouting we got people just like the Corinthians Church the they you know with a lot of gifts and things of that nature but they were immature not right but one of the things the Prophet makes a statement he talking about the feasts in church she said there's there's got to be another Ephesians to this journey but then he says now and it's gonna be important to what we want to talk about we're here and and you say well brother smiley what are you talking about if we understand correctly the Ephesians church they were a mature church right they were mature group of people Paul was able to preach things to the Ephesians church that he wasn't able to preach to just say the Corinthians the Corinthians we find and I hate to call us that because we shouldn't be that but we still see a little bit of the Corinthian ACTRA groups kind of lingering around that the the supposed to be fullness of the world but to me it's I'm not here to discuss Chennai's anybody this morning but it just shows the lack of maturity on the parts of of us and a lot of times you know we try to blame the ministers in the ministry but a lot of times it's just us come on now now y'all inshallah keep on shouting a lot of times I think it's more it's more of us than it is the preaching of the word of God right I wanna I want to take my time this morning because I want to show us some things this morning by the by the grace of God the spirit that was in that day and and they kind of show us what Satan's intent is Satan's Satan has always had a motive and an objective right and you know I'm grateful for the opening of the word because it identifies for me things that wouldn't initially be identified right come on y'all I'm gonna believe that the word open see we have got to be able to see and see means to understand right and and in the book of Revelation it says everything a worship the Beast whose name is not written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of world great small big no matter who you are how much money you got much education you got no matter who you are black white purple green you are once you go to worship that beast if your name is not written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundations of the world you're gonna do it you're gonna do it see and the only reason the elect will do it is because they've been illuminated is that right but that's the only reason why a man we will not worship the Beast because we can identify the bc's we understand the beast right we know where Satan's seat is part of it is out of Hollywood right you go back to oh it'll come to him in a second but so this morning we want to try to show us the enemy right the message of my concern like that is not about a man never has been never will be right it's got to be about God the thunders the seals all of that is about Christ right if you cannot see Christ in every light of the Scriptures you gotta go back because you don't miss something and in this hour we don't want to be missing anything right come on we do not want to be missing anything in this hour we want our understanding to be illuminated so so that amen we don't take the mark right we don't succumb to the spirits of this age right we're not defeated we're supposed to be prevailing people right lot of relaxed people we do we like to come to church and just kind of sit back you know and and no no no if you understand this our that should be a fervor hmm I can remember you know man I'll tell you what retrofire choice on fire truck chair remind me of the old days you know when we were young young folk we didn't have great know we're gonna see Eric man back there we didn't have any gray anywhere with y'all was black head and I had hair and and we won't fire for God man we ran the aisles I wasn't enjoying this today sister Brian we shouldn't let somebody like sister Brown I'll shout us the young people I'm up there with sister brown now but but but she getting ready to leave me in a minute but I'm up there with her oh I see them crossed over a little bit I forgot that's just a sense of you over we all right but y'all young people y'all that group of 50 and 60 year old folks out worship you we shout out about game day we should shout about the glory of God we should shout about the pleasures of God we did we get us excited about a loop helped us in a new pair you know a new car lose something we should ain't man be excited about being in the presence of God because being in the present bottles of leverage that some people would love to be Sydney y'all places I'm just gonna get out the way for a minutes gonna take me a minute huh I guarantee that young man that did that just just my brother was just talking about you know getting what he would love to be sitting in church with his hands up saying glory to God saying won't he do it [Music] y'all didn't hear me but let's kind of calm down a little bit let's let's look at the I'm gonna pick you up and then tell you be seated and all that kind of good stuff well I but I want us to understand I want us to leave here with with with something that will really help us just see thee just listen this is a very deceitful age right this is a very deceitful age I'm going I have to say what I believe if it wasn't for coming in contact with Malachi for taking the book and eating the book I would be in trouble come on there's a lot of people quitting and walking away and giving up but I can only speak for myself this is just personal your revelation has got to be personal right your experience is personal because you ain't going to glory on brother Jack's experience right sister Erica's experience sister Tina sister you're not going in or nobody else you gotta go in on your own experience there's got to be a personal you gotta have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ failed self you're a man got to be for you and if nobody else for a man around your own yo ro you ain't man it for what you believe what you understand what you stand for where to go and you just pray for your neighbor that gotta cuz it takes not to reveal or you don't get it right but we want to look at the Ephesian age right and and but we want to see what restoration has done has brought us back to this place but there's a there's a fight I believe there's a battle and what we do not want to do is is succumb to the same spirits that overcame them in that age but I got a lot of information i reaiiy I'm just gonna drop this right quick imma keep moving I annoying a baby to get to it I was thinking about something that I preached years ago right about avoid and recapture right and I think brother Jack priest sitting brother Bradley preached it a little bit that's what we do we just we don't care preachers we preach what cuz it becomes more real to us and she we we're supposed to be free now that's what I believe how many three people we got free in the spirit I'm free ain't no change holding me not naturally but some folks got spiritual change right Amen you know it's something about going free if you ever been bound by anything by anyone right by mail by female or substance or gates or a thing of the devil in your mind if you ever go free you don't ever want to be a man bound up with that again see you you you you just run and you keep on running while you're running why are you running so fast because a man I know what it's like to be bound see you say what's right why are you ready I know what it's like to be bound in my mind I know it's like to be bound with substance abuse right Kubo depression oppression feeling like you know you're not gonna love you I'm gonna talk to me that this morning right come on and it's some people right up in here just like that because that's why we that's why do some of the things that they're doing right but because they they become captive to something see the objective and the intent of God through addiction is to make us free see we were we came here bound by representation because of what in the garden right representation by predestination now yeah I'm just saying y'all got to go find it cuz it's coming to me so I ain't got no I know it's in here but okay we tweet by representation but the blood see you don't have no excuse to be found right because prevailing power Amen is in the work and to prevail is is to prove more powerful than opposing forces huh but see you could never prevail apart from the Holy Ghost in you how many believe that without the Holy Ghost see you could never have prevailing power right you'll never overcome in this age see because you'll never even understand this age but I mean I hate to make this statement but I'm kind of inclined to believe a lot of people just don't have the Holy Ghost right because you watch they're under stuff just maybe there's some amnesia shop in the battle sometimes you you fight so long you fight so long until you forget that you're shunning god oh god the pressures of life the pressures of paint sometime you know bringing to a place where you forget what God and then done for you you forget who you are you forget what you once used to believe so just maybe we just need to get keep people amen in familiar territory you know the property talked about the young man who went off the war and and just was sharp in the battle didn't know who he was right and I guess one day they was taking him to this facility of this place the army and and and you know he was on a train and you know he the train stopped that he got off and say the young man starting started looking around coming now this is all about it I don't know y'all might have to give me a pass well I tell you what this morning so the young man started started looking around and it's just something about being in familiar territory you know it starts to bring you back huh and he started walking and and one man wanted to stop him woman let him go and he just kept on walking he found this path kept on walking and going and going and going till he walked himself home young miss there ya see if we let somebody stop us will never walk our way back home huh and when he when he got there daddy daddy was standing there waiting on him over the gun huh I believe every day his daddy split out on the porch with fake that white thing my son is coming back home I'm gonna come huh standing there and the Welcome committee say boy I knew you was coming home I think sometimes that's that's the way that parents got to do you you just stand there knowing no matter what they're doing no matter what they say no matter what condition are they in you'll know that one day they're coming back home said right amen stay on stay on now look at the Ephesians page the very name Ephesus has a strange compound mean it means that aimed at and relaxed right the high aspiration now this is something for me I'm quite sure brother Jack I preached on these lines but this way I met this morning okay it says that the high aspirations of this age that begun with the fullness of the Spirit right and see I believe that we have come back to the fools of the Spirit justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the personal price right amen I believe that the faeces eight started out with all of God for light on the world they had a perfect interpretation of the word right because because God does not change if you look back to Genesis I like to look back at because that's my mirror that's the picture of redemption when I look back to the first church in Genesis which was Adam and Eve huh Daten they exemplify the first church and the first family God's perfect wheel right and I believe when you look back to Genesis they they had the perfect interpretation of the word right until a man the spirit of error Cain right so I believe that this shucks had the depth of God because this is what he says the fullness of the Word of God though they knew what the will of God is see and in this age we have the mind of Christ right to know what he wants done with his word but you first got the Amen getting people going again y'all stay whipping that y'all stay with me see the new birth is so important that's whether you know people people think that preaching you must be born again is beneath you know that's too simply simple right but that's one of the most important doctrines it is amen to the Christian journey because if if you cannot get people born again they'll never understand amen the message of the hours that right come on and see but only thing the message every hour that does is open the thing that we have up to so that we can't understand point us back to an original plan and program of God it's just that simple right we complicated sometimes but it's just that simple a ministry to come on the scene to show us things that we did not see didn't understand and will not understand come on y'all gonna look right on me but but that's the truth you said well why would you say that brother smiley because I grew up part that is a pop any car a little bit of methods a little open AME and and I realize now what has been revealed to me it's all together on a whole nother level then what the Bible was presented you know we just had a lot of like I was messing around with y'all earlier yeah yeah but I'm talking about real depth real light real understanding right something something they take us further than Genesis 1 and 1 in the beginning right something to take us all the way back to the mind of God to show us why all of this stuff is what it is because of what God had in his mind before let there be but see you know back then once this Ephesian age my god pray for me so I could keep moving you know moving up moving further because inspiration into striking me and I am at home it will probably take me two or three services but we'll see how we go this morning now we're talking about the the Ephesian age right and shortest and short us this age but also showing us the enemy in the midst of this age right because see what a thing we gotta keep in mind right Satan from from before he was ever kicked out of he had an objective right he according to the Book of Isaiah he wanted to exalt itself right above the stars of God come on now he see as well as God has had an objective Satan has had an objective see Satan Satan wanted an Eden of his kind he wanted children of his kind and he hasn't he has it he has a church come on let's get powerful he has a church he has a children he has a people he has an anointing his false but he has one he has an objective part of the kill steal and destroy huh I'm gonna say I believe it I believe that's in the Bible okay I'm gonna just drop a lot and y'all go back and get the tape but but watch he's talking about he said that it was aimed at and then they got relaxed right you say why you why you want to preached it because I you can see the spirit yup every minute I try to keep this coat on but I have a fan at home and ain't no fan of here I can't feel the ones out there it's a big machine here but they got relaxed and see we gotta be a people that prevail right like what says this way I started to prove more powerful than opposing forces to be victorious right victory is mine to come out on top right with handing out the tail right to succeed that's every aspect naturally and spiritually right it should bother you to feel like you know and I may not come to the height says but you should never limit yourself huh hello we should never limit ourselves naturally and spiritually spiritually there is no limits huh we just got to get beyond the barriers see once we get through all of them you know like the plane then it gets unlimited and see that's what we we trying to forget the church right and it's a fight like we said it's hard to manage people it's hard to get people to get in one accord and one man with you right to halt to your vision but see we never get the church beyond you know all the you know as the plane is going up then once you get to a certain altitude is unlimited see that's waiting limit we're limited because we have not gotten ourselves and then into our ought to be place but once we get there trust we're really beginning to see something see then we're not subject to teach see taste hear smell and things of that nature right we tweet like the Bible said it just shall live by faith right see sometimes you know you watch brother wesco right a perfect an example brother why still don't live by the elements of this this life and what people say well you can't do this and you can't do that you can't do this you can't go here you can't go there cuz like what's stopping me a pleasure now come on Kimmo you can't what's happening wait I'm in control I'm I'm on top what what devil what demon can stand before me don't worry that what he told Joshua he say nothing yes whatever you do don't look to the left or the right stay down the middle of the road and nothing will be able to stand before you network no cancer no devil no no no criticism no Matt would be able to stand before you I'll be with you huh hey man it's the rule to reign prevail over emotions why no that's a deep one right there that's a real that's a real deep one because the enemy fight us in our human spirit and I ni emotions I think that's one of the biggies why we can't grasp the the word of the hour because we're too emotional and we try to figure out how could this great loving God condemn these people over here you see it all the way through the Bible that's how I know you can do it look at what he did in the days of Noah right he said he sent the man with the revealed word for the date build up build an ark and call the people to the ark right a one man ministry right no it was the judgment power right amen the people I got is such a condition that God had come down but watch the righteousness of God look at the righteousness of God see Amen God God desired for all men to be saved but God knows that everybody ain't gonna be saying because everybody's not gonna get in but God is gonna give you a chance he's gonna give you an opportunity right building up tell the people look at that new light it's gonna rain that was too simple that couldn't comprehend it hina watch see you hate God God has got to reveal himself to you it's gonna rain we'd never seen rain it's because you've never seen it don't mean it's not gonna happen God said it's gonna rain if God's added that Scelzi right God is more than able to produce it if he's saying no amen I'm coming down in judgment but I'm gonna give opportunity I'm Sayla my fall we're right at the crust of judgment we better get in while we got a chance right come on come on what would we we we we we sciences we strong people we man we never seen let it come from down there we can shoot footage to the moon and prove ain't no rain up there it's been this certain way for you know all of this time right ain't man what that got to do with the God said it's gonna rain is gonna rain see that evidence that it was gonna rain was one crazy man come on and you gotta be crazy to do what I tell you right but you're not I rather be a fool for it'll be the food for man I really I'd rather look crazy good for people didn't amen to miss God's perfect wheel huh amen just just to think it was other boatbuilders in that day but they were not a man constructing something that will be able to withstand the judgment huh they didn't have a revelation the revelation came to Moses build an ark build it like this do it like this pitch it within and without huh glory to God see it up huh hey man cuz it's going to go through listen let me tell you something you thinking about what David I actually went through it wasn't some calm peaceful waters it was a real judgment it was it was probably really chaotic but you know one thing I like what's what you were in wedding you can risk a three of folk caught that the rest of y'all maybe a drop on you in a minute once you get in you can rest you can say let it do what it do but imma be all right oh I just feel something here it's gonna be all right brother solid with don't pull don't be like that cuz I tell you what I feel I just feel something y'all go created a real serious atmosphere up in here this power right glory to God but he says oh I know when I was striking on I don't want to lead prevail by emotions right it's our emotions that that that keep us earth barrel right amen it's see anything that tries to rise above the Word of God we cast it down it's just a Bernese sing that song at home we cast it down see you cannot operate any motions and feelings and faith at the same time you've got to pray God reveal right it does not do away with with your caring your love for Humanity but you can't save nobody right I can't say nobody I can just thank God for revealing I could thank God for light and revelation a man of the hour that I'm living in a lot of people cannot fully comprehend this agent hour that we're in we're back to Genesis right with back to Genesis Barton Martin come down right and and revealed himself to Abraham to angels to Sodom right an investigation judgment the fires got the fall we should save some it's gonna rain but it's a it won't be water but fire next time well listen Church you know we're right on the grasp of it huh that was good work huh whatever y'all know it'll come on you see whether hat will you wear this wrong people they I can tell you well it didn't kind of go right but yeah they're straight me out after a while this baby out right but but we're right there see when we're right there this is the judgment hour right amen see look at the things that were smart God has been to us throughout history just to cinnamon bottom that given that choice and that name was not something that just out of the blue happen see it watch that ministry get lined up with Scripture right listen I you can't give brother branham the credit for the understanding that he had with the lack of understanding or lack of education that he had right how could you you know how could I think about this thing though you know I ponder these things sometimes you know a man with with 7th grade education that's no way picking up this Bible and being able to grasp who he is his name those angels and all of the things that he presented it took more than a man to reveal it to him to prove how real how real his ministry right just how real it how scriptural that's like a priest groups messages this day description is 4 feet [Music] huh champ trench to show us the fulfillment of Scripture right trying to bring us out of the glare of another day into the marvelous life of Jesus Christ but I I would that we live in here trying to bring us out amen of judgment because you know the Bible says all cages right it's full of vomit come on he said become the cage of every cleaning hateful and unclean bird what what what is that pointing back to and you'd hate to say this this Mike I hope this don't hurt about a feeling but I'm a priest you look back through denominationalism now we're not dealing with so much with people but you look at the system the system you gotta say it like he see it right it's what was he always against this stuff right see even even in description we read it sister the start the system of things that the original church hated the spirit the system of thing that were contrary to the original to the depth of God see this while the Apostle Paul come on the scene dealing with the glacier stretch and say listen if you don't listen how quickly are are y'all remove from the original gospel the original word right to another gospel inspiration man it hasn't changed seducing clergy spirits to try to take you back into Judaism right take you back into amen something that did not possess the ability to make you fully free see under the law the law could only you know devil's a covering but it's a I'm the Calvary it's a total release it's a fall Jubilee that's why I'm crazy like I am today cuz I'm free see I heard I heard and see we just got to keep blowing the trumpet right and hopefully people to hear the gospel trumpet and come out come out come out of the world but also come out of of religion huh come out of denominationalism back to the Bible back to the word right how much time I got I don't know I got it I'm gonna preach a little why I gotta go I gotta have communion at home so but y'all alright wait lemme see alright blame it on brother Jean for not showing up glory to God amen your emotions of failure cuz in our emotions you know one day we are on the mountaintop and the next day you know you can't base it on that but the official a setting is aimed at and they relax this is the high aspiration of this age that had begun with the fullness of the Spirit the depth of God whereby they were aimed at the high calling of God right amen he says began to give way to unless this is an important statement write a less watchful attitude right it's almost like you know when you first become a Christian anything the man of God say you write on it pastor said it you know what the pastor say you you know you know how it is we raise the children and you know you always get that that honoring child and maybe you get that good child in that honor each time you know and and one meal huh you know you know what mama said please come over here alright you know my oldest sister was that one I was the good child oh boy couple here could you stay oh boy but you stay it put a little pressure on me you know sister got more heart than you boy you know do have me all out there - lord help us people people you you you're on fire right when we tell you Erica's some of the old ones was time Ewing Shonda and who wasn't Vernon Jimmy means Oh fire whatever you know we feared going into office brother let's go calling you not one we are it one did something we all got in trouble it was a body thing I want to see all the young people after church don't nobody leave and that was always hard for me because I was a little bit older than them I you know I'm gonna got a few years older there so it's hard for me to humble myself to a man you know it was because because I was about 25 then and I'm like man I grew up I have no dad I my old daddy who did not help me that was hard we would see like always in the sub but I humbled myself because he was demand of God you don't wanted to think one of the things I learned one of the things I learned I'm gonna just say this you know and it's a good one for young ministers because I think the young preachers in this day got a little take over spirit feel like you know sometime they know more right you don't know no more I watch them I listen to them I watched the accident and that's an indication to me you know very little [Music] but one of the things I learned I learned to trust God in the midst of headship so the brows i'ma tell you now we went from Bosco the brother James before I started pastoring one thing both of them rice is the brown over the High Line y'all rice is the brown come on that oak widow be right what one of the things I learned as a young preacher I trusted God with the man with the church I trusted God's leadership right amen I you know as I saw it the same way I didn't see it the same way a greeter same way I trusted God with his church then if anything is good is going wrong God will straighten it out somehow some way but I'm not going to put my opinion in my hand on it right I'm gonna leave it to God I will find out what I supposed to be doing my part my position my place in the body but I'm not gonna touch the man of God huh Bible said just that my anointed do my propers no heart it's not like the story in the Bible you know with King David this fella state and he you know he kind of you know come comes and like you know we're solid into David right man I tell you what what it was a hot heavy battle right then you know song I pulled it in this is an oven and in the man of god is dead huh what happened you know it got like this in his eyes and I took it that if I wanted to take if I wanted him out I could have took your knife several occasions I called him I called him in the cage and just let him know you up a little something let him know walking gotcha why won't you you know how you did me boo Joplin's that venue you know who what's gonna get you he said listen I got a guy I'm gonna kill him I didn't need nobody to kill him hey let him say so she's so smart that you so smart y'all take him out huh see God don't need a lot of smart people that's our problem we too smart for our own good to our own destruction we so smart look at us look at look at the life but we so smart we know more didn't the seen you pass the two scriptures on a quote it have us stuff be off yeah I'll just say preach wit me brothers my y'all come on down I'm gonna go ain't here know where I wanted to go honey it's true you gotta be humble that's right you know system of share trying to run sister calm y'all don't mind if I use yo the system she'll work for since the car let me tell you something yeah I'll tell my chariot I say if I need advice of folks up my action huh I need advice on running the church I would action if he got something that will benefit the church if he come with the right spirit and attitude I will be willing to hear out but at the end of the day I got the yea or nay the veto power huh my brother Jack who are y'all people huh Jack is the boss here come on Bobby Holy Ghost people gonna find a getting that going I'm telling you I'm telling this just a warning this whole message is about a warning people don't get themselves in a whole lot of trouble right because of their lack of understanding a man of leadership come look at the days of Moses you ain't the only holy one in the ears of the buck see the attitude spirits don't die the fierce don't die you see spirits everywhere like still just as alive and well right ain't only holy but one in the bunch right some of y'all went here I'm gonna say we got this little thing going around you know I had you know I wasn't pretty and somebody called me this little more Millennials you blue Millennials better humping ourselves you say why you say that's about my smile let's eat because I realized something I'm gonna get to the point is the spirit of it is a spirit of division if the speed of the you see people be talking and all of you like see see they just forget to me they don't be understanding they'll be really used by the devil when you step up and you start wellwe've Millennials we this and with that and and we have not gone on this that's a rebellious spirit it's the spirit of division you can't listen Church you cannot work with a group of people like that see it would defeat my purpose as a shepherd to divide our church to come in and say well we got the baby boomers and we got to the Millennials and div but death what about the generation after the Millennials cuz there's another generation see this do what about them they chopped liver you see come on let go go such a history pull up Millennials and and the definition of the show you is smart to come see but when those little spirits drop it's a spirit a man of division it's the spirit of medallion of leadership that's the right way the wrong way to do things social media I was just gonna preach this morning i'ma going on home I'll see y'all win sir listen social media is killing the church it's killing folk period it's killing the church now I tell you to get rid of your Facebook I ain't lettin you Instagram that's on you do whatever you want to do but it's killing them it's the platform the wrong platform it's a platform like anything has to be used for good but you can see the devil see thank God you got a watchman on the tower I'm the watchman this morning I'm the watchman this morning on the tower saying it's the enemy in the Old Testament amen they were they would have the watchman taking the different watch and what were they the purpose they sit so high they can see everything approaching right amen the gates and and they were trained with the ability to know whether or not it was the enemy or whether or not amen people were coming in peace right amen I'm the watchman that's the devil that little Millennial spirit that's the devil that's the devil out you said why you saying I don't know how far that thing then reached huh see when anytime you working with a group of people you've got to keep a balance see years ago I saw watch I saw watched everything where people used to put more emphasis on the young people you can't pass the church like that the young people too young people our young people well what about the older people you cannot you cannot do that constant I hope this all right now you ain't all right brother Jackie let me know you can't you cannot you cannot preach to people like that right amen you've got a work with a body new converts more seasoned and more seasoned right but you gotta tell the messages to bring us all up to the unity of the faith right and you can't lean more to one side right if you do that you'll start causing divisions amongst the people come on cuz the owner be like I was we would have a phone up yep I cheering come on I'm pretty good now you can't do that see so when will you start name-calling well we do baby boomers and we'll adjust one and we did that one you cannot do this see lord help us Lord I gots to go guys I got I got too much - it's just a ball I feel the pool and I you know it but you gotta you gotta strut you got us right things to bring people to a place where they understand they understand how to approach ministry how to approach church how to approach leadership right come on you gotta know your place your position huh you know brother Jack my brother-in-law but if I if he was here I would come up under his authority because this is his church were you a past and what I got to do with it I'm not the pastor of this church this is his church God give him this ministry to govern when I walked through those doors I know buddy huh I'm not nobody if he want me to do something he say pray that's all I do is pray huh I don't I don't take the opportunity well let me let everybody know when I'm packing no he say play I play he say saying I say and I'll sing to the glory of God he say well smile I need you to proof that's all I want to do I don't want to take my Solomon's place I don't I don't want to take you know trashing the place right come on I'm pretty gifted right but when I come here I know my place I'm okay with coming in and sitting on the Word of God and hey let the water I'm a no preaching inch now after 27 years huh see you get you get people you say pray they got it all alive well let me tell you when I tell you to do all I hate told you to pray see come on church I mean be humble brothers I ask you to do something just say okay if you can do it do it if you can't just let him know you can't do it right that said well I'm grown here I'm holding him brother Jack I'm older Detroit I'm probably only opposed to y'all in here right but I know how to humble myself no matter what Minister Peter it was kinda I got humble myself right if he got the flow he got the flow well boy I tell you what that wasn't deep enough no don't even be my attitude so we miss God and simplicity [Applause] sometimes it take the simplicity of the Word of God to be preached in order for people to get well I know your mind cuz I don't want your mind to be blown I want you to understand pride praise God I said it that's craziness you lead the people confused I want y'all to understand up you know what I'm finna go I pray this morning that you know I said some things that that kind of helped us it may be more seasoned folks here non season and I'm not the pastor the church so I can't really work with child away that Jack can cuz he here with you I'm kind of an evangelistic mode you know just kind of you feel you feel things that's how I'm built at home I could have preached this and not been all over the place but when I go out and be so many things moving around in the spirit and the spirit and God said hit it boom hit that to hit this - he said why is he doing that because God is concerned about you God is concerned about folk being saved God is concerned about being people being delivered God is concerned about people prevailing over things right come on come on God God wants us to be on guard right to be watchful not not relaxed go go back I don't know if I'm a priest on this Wednesday night by the grace of God for come back you go back if you got a church age book and pick up from page 77 and read also from pages 261 in the church days book and pages 125 okay everybody got a book Church this book he feeds his church a pages 77 and read down in there and then go over the pages 261 and page from page 125 and just kind of read in there you get some good thought I I knew I had too much information this for anyway let the musician make their way out but how many just appreciate the appreciate the Word of God I gotta say I would have to kind of start all over this afternoon and try to get on on point to really bring out the rest of my thought but God knows all things right God knows all things and and I know y'all got a really good pastor sometimes I'll be sitting there man blow it away and some of the things man brother Jack preach we were at a couple of years ago at the 10th meeting and what brother Jack but that preach the message where preacher up in there was like greedy where that come from so sometimes sometimes you know brothers feel like you know they got the monopoly on on on the book and preaching you know they feel like when you're preaching we're preaching this year the 10th meeting and priest a little thought old-timers was like I'm desperation right for I have never heard desperation preach like that in my life it's like cuz you know what God didn't reveal that to you he revealed that to me to preach a bear is a good guy hey man how many gonna be faithful not learning to be faithful beef be faithful beyond time you know just be dragging around and dragging it beyond time you know what gets me why should be doing this living people being 20 years and don't know how to get the church from time but we get to the man job on time we don't think it's nothing and God be looking at it like you think you coming to glory like that that relax local spirit you ain't coming nowhere like that well brother Solomon you better get this might fold a put the dogs on me but understand we have a word of Prayer we turn it over to brother Solomon but I appreciate the Lord this morning God just remember brother gobo and just you know is everybody all right Heavenly Father we just think yo God this

the work with law we appreciate the things that we're seeing in the work and the atmosphere and and everything that we feel this morning and we're so grateful just to have the opportunity to be a part of it you know my heart Lord my heart is to just try to point the people in the right direction not to act like a know-it-all or anything but you know we when you give people something then that you know we're obligated to share the things that you're revealing with us you know we we gotta expose the enemy because we know that that the enemies is lurking and his tennis intent is to destroy the work of God so we just actually your people just continue to humble themselves but the folded ministry and I believe that Lord you'll bring them to those places and positions of growth and maturity and overcoming and we give your name to praise in Jesus Christ wonderful name praise well let's give the Lord another hand clap of praise praise the Lord a man that's two weeks in the in the road that
