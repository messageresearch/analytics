[1:12:48] behind me is
[1:12:52] one of my dearest
[1:12:54] friends
[1:12:55] 21 years ago we met for the first time
[1:12:58] here at this
[1:13:00] church
[1:13:01] and
[1:13:02] i would have never known that from that
[1:13:05] time you know coming from a man
[1:13:07] jeffersonville you hear so much
[1:13:10] uh but uh i i had met two brothers out
[1:13:14] of jeffersonville one was brother nathan
[1:13:16] bryan the other was brother trevor eben
[1:13:18] and we would connect
[1:13:19] by email and uh you know and just just
[1:13:22] talk uh back and forth about different
[1:13:24] things and and as we're sharing and i'm
[1:13:26] just
[1:13:27] putting my heart out i'm just gonna put
[1:13:29] it out here in the email and i don't
[1:13:31] know how these brothers gonna receive it
[1:13:33] then you know they would say well
[1:13:34] brother that's the same way i see it and
[1:13:37] they put their heart out and they wonder
[1:13:38] how i was gonna receive it i say well
[1:13:41] that's the same way i see it and i
[1:13:43] realized we were connected
[1:13:46] and uh and from that time we have been
[1:13:50] connected and this this weekend
[1:13:52] amen the lord allowed the two ministries
[1:13:55] to unite through
[1:13:57] a
[1:13:58] wedding so
[1:14:00] uh i believe god is in this weekend i
[1:14:04] believe god got things that he's doing
[1:14:06] that we might not know about but in due
[1:14:09] time we will understand it better
[1:14:13] by and by
[1:14:15] but dear friend of mine and amen i just
[1:14:18] appreciate him and i'm so happy that my
[1:14:20] daughter is going to be a part of
[1:14:23] a man his ministry
[1:14:25] if i
[1:14:27] had to brag on him just a little bit he
[1:14:29] is one of the most balanced preachers
[1:14:32] you will ever hear
[1:14:34] and i thank god for that because there's
[1:14:36] a lot of fanaticism
[1:14:39] in our
[1:14:40] message i might as well say the truth
[1:14:43] there's a lot of fanaticism
[1:14:45] in our message so i thank god for
[1:14:48] somebody can keep it right in the middle
[1:14:50] of the road
[1:14:51] don't move too far left don't move too
[1:14:54] far right

[1:21:02] so brother jack said 19 or 21 years ago
[1:21:05] i was 19.
[1:21:08] 21 years ago i walked through those back
[1:21:10] doors
[1:21:11] the church was packed folding chairs
[1:21:14] everywhere
[1:21:17] and i heard a guy singing up here
[1:21:21] and
[1:21:23] he was singing
[1:21:25] it won't be long
[1:21:27] soon we'll be leaving
[1:21:29] and then he's saying i went to church
[1:21:31] for a very long time but i feel it
[1:21:34] changed in my life
[1:21:36] and
[1:21:38] his wonderful
[1:21:39] wonderful meetings wonderful presence of
[1:21:41] the lord
[1:21:42] [Music]
[1:21:43] and
[1:21:45] we saw the supernatural done we'll maybe
[1:21:47] look at that in a little bit but
[1:21:49] saw god move in a mighty way
[1:21:51] i appreciate these brothers from florida
[1:21:54] appreciate brother west go open in his
[1:21:55] pulpit this morning and
[1:21:58] see brother smiley back there remember
[1:22:00] preaching at the storefront years and
[1:22:02] years ago there for him and
[1:22:04] see all of us
[1:22:06] back in one building for service
[1:22:08] together i believe the lord is pleased
[1:22:10] and that he'll he'll do something for us
[1:22:11] this morning
[1:22:13] amen i had a scripture i was going to
[1:22:14] read this morning i'll get to that in a
[1:22:16] moment but when brother jack was singing
[1:22:18] there a little bit ago and brother
[1:22:19] solomon about our blessings
[1:22:22] i believe he's got a blessing with your
[1:22:24] name on it this morning
[1:22:27] so let me read you a couple of
[1:22:28] scriptures from psalm before we go to
[1:22:30] prayer psalm 103
[1:22:33] and verses 1 through 5 and then we want
[1:22:35] to go over to psalm 68 and read one
[1:22:38] verse there
[1:22:41] what an honor and a privilege it is to
[1:22:43] be
[1:22:44] assembled together with saints of god
[1:22:48] brother branham said if he had a
[1:22:50] a little vial of the physical blood of
[1:22:53] jesus christ how careful that he would
[1:22:54] be with it but he said i have something
[1:22:56] greater than that
[1:22:57] i have the purchase
[1:22:59] of his blood before me
[1:23:01] that he thought more of you than he did
[1:23:04] of his own blood
[1:23:05] and so what a wonderful thing it is not
[1:23:07] only are we blessed to have the purchase
[1:23:09] of his blood
[1:23:10] we're blessed to have him with us in our
[1:23:12] midst because he promised wherever two
[1:23:14] or three were gathered together that
[1:23:16] he'd be here
[1:23:17] so we just want to remind the devil our
[1:23:20] lord is here this morning
[1:23:22] and whenever wherever he is good things
[1:23:24] happen
[1:23:26] i just want to say before we read
[1:23:28] appreciate my family being with me my
[1:23:29] wife sister rebecca my oldest son
[1:23:32] phillip and
[1:23:33] nathaniel and ruth and brother fuhrman
[1:23:35] and sister april's behind them is
[1:23:38] my song leader at church and i was
[1:23:41] telling brother jack yesterday when they
[1:23:43] they came out of the amish brother
[1:23:44] fuhrman's family did and and when i was
[1:23:46] about a four-year-old boy they'd come
[1:23:48] and visit us in our home and they were
[1:23:50] traveling about two hours to church and
[1:23:53] and i felt a call on my life even at
[1:23:55] that young age and my cousin had built
[1:23:57] me a little bitty pulpit and i had a
[1:23:59] tape recorder that my uncle had given me
[1:24:01] and and i would preach and brother
[1:24:02] fuhrman would lead songs
[1:24:04] and
[1:24:05] 30 something years later not much has
[1:24:07] changed but
[1:24:08] gifts and callings are without
[1:24:10] repentance
[1:24:11] brother jonathan and sister sarah and
[1:24:13] their two daughters are with us as well
[1:24:15] from indiana brother joe crease he's
[1:24:17] there locally with us as well and just
[1:24:20] wonderful to see the saints of god
[1:24:23] what will it be when we get over there
[1:24:26] and it won't just be south carolina
[1:24:28] florida
[1:24:29] indiana
[1:24:30] uk
[1:24:31] but all the saints from all ages from
[1:24:34] all geographic locations
[1:24:36] brother graham said the angels will have
[1:24:38] to stand with bowed heads because we'll
[1:24:40] be singing a song that they can't relate
[1:24:42] to amazing grace how sweet the sound
[1:24:47] psalm 103 verse 1
[1:24:50] bless the lord o my soul
[1:24:52] and all that is within me bless his holy
[1:24:55] name
[1:24:56] bless the lord o my soul and forget not
[1:24:59] all his benefits
[1:25:02] who forgiveth all thine iniquities
[1:25:06] even the sins that make some people
[1:25:07] uncomfortable yet his blood was strong
[1:25:09] enough
[1:25:10] to forgive all our iniquities who
[1:25:13] healeth
[1:25:14] all thy diseases
[1:25:17] some doctors will tell you well this is
[1:25:18] incurable and that's incurable they just
[1:25:20] don't know my god
[1:25:23] who healeth all thy diseases
[1:25:27] i like when the scripture says all like
[1:25:29] all things work together for good
[1:25:32] that means everything's included
[1:25:35] nothing the devil can throw at you
[1:25:37] there's no disclaimer except for covet
[1:25:39] except for cancer except for diabetes
[1:25:43] all thy diseases
[1:25:47] who redeemeth thy life from destruction
[1:25:49] who crowneth thee with
[1:25:51] loving kindness and tender mercies who
[1:25:54] satisfieth thy mouth with good things
[1:25:58] that thy youth is renewed
[1:26:00] like the eagles and let's turn back to
[1:26:02] uh
[1:26:03] psalm chapter 68 and just want to read
[1:26:05] one verse there
[1:26:07] verse 19
[1:26:09] blessed be the lord
[1:26:12] who daily loadeth us
[1:26:14] with benefits
[1:26:17] even the god of our salvation
[1:26:19] so we recognize there's some benefits to
[1:26:21] this
[1:26:23] when brother jack was talking about
[1:26:24] those packages being delivered it
[1:26:26] reminded me brother hoover preached a
[1:26:27] sermon from our church on that one time
[1:26:30] about daley loading us with benefits he
[1:26:32] said just imagine
[1:26:34] one of those big trucks backing up and
[1:26:36] you can hear it beeping as it backs up
[1:26:37] beep beep beep
[1:26:39] to your front door with your benefits
[1:26:41] every day
[1:26:44] he daily loadeth us with benefits
[1:26:47] you know you may have came in with the
[1:26:48] frown on your face and discouraged but i
[1:26:50] hope by the time we go out of this
[1:26:52] building you'll realize you're blessed
[1:26:55] we are blessed
[1:26:57] and i just want to make mention as well
[1:27:00] i didn't realize it
[1:27:02] until last night
[1:27:04] i we've got a brother chris cathy from
[1:27:07] our church that's ministering up in
[1:27:08] washington state at brother john andy's
[1:27:10] church this weekend and i caught just
[1:27:12] the very end of that service when we got
[1:27:14] back to the hotel last night and brother
[1:27:15] john got up and he made mention that
[1:27:18] today
[1:27:20] is the first day of spring
[1:27:23] and i watch little things like that
[1:27:25] brother branham watch little things like
[1:27:26] that
[1:27:27] we had a wedding this weekend there was
[1:27:30] a funeral this weekend and it's the
[1:27:32] first day of spring
[1:27:34] and god begins to move in his nature and
[1:27:37] we know the spiritual types the natural
[1:27:39] and so i believe you know it's not
[1:27:41] separating time it's uniting time
[1:27:44] and the bride of jesus christ
[1:27:46] he's not looking at the color of your
[1:27:48] skin he's not looking at your race he's
[1:27:51] not looking at your city or the name of
[1:27:53] the church above the door he's looking
[1:27:55] at is the blood applied
[1:27:59] and if the blood is applied then we can
[1:28:01] have fellowship under the blood of jesus
[1:28:03] christ

[1:29:30] different states and lord each one of us
[1:29:33] father may you just anoint may you lead
[1:29:36] may you guide our steps father in jesus
[1:29:39] christ's name we pray and the church
[1:29:41] said
[1:29:43] amen god bless you can be seated
[1:29:52] turn with me if you would again to
[1:29:54] genesis chapter 6.
[1:29:57] we want to read a few verses there this
[1:29:58] morning
[1:29:59] genesis chapter 6
[1:30:01] and verse 13.
[1:30:08] a very familiar story
[1:30:11] even the sunday school children are
[1:30:12] familiar with it but
[1:30:15] god's word is eternal right and so no
[1:30:17] matter how many times we hear his word
[1:30:19] yet there's things that we can glean
[1:30:21] from it that maybe we never caught
[1:30:22] before
[1:30:23] and that's because his word is eternal
[1:30:25] and it just keeps unfolding and
[1:30:27] unfolding
[1:30:28] genesis chapter 6 and verse 13
[1:30:31] and god said unto noah
[1:30:34] the end of all flesh has come before me
[1:30:37] for the earth is filled with violence
[1:30:40] through them and behold i will destroy
[1:30:42] them with the earth
[1:30:44] make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms
[1:30:47] shalt thou make in the ark and shall
[1:30:50] pitch it within and without with pitch
[1:30:52] you notice it's not just enough to look
[1:30:54] like a christian on the outside but it
[1:30:56] had to be pitched within and without
[1:30:58] and this is the fashion which thou shalt
[1:31:01] make it of the length of the ark shall
[1:31:03] be 300 cubits the breadth of it 50
[1:31:07] cubits the heights of it 30 cubits a
[1:31:09] window thou shalt make to the ark and in
[1:31:12] a cubit shalt thou finish it above and
[1:31:15] the door of the ark shalt thou set in
[1:31:17] the side thereof with lower second and
[1:31:20] third stories shalt thou make it we want
[1:31:23] to look at this thought with the help of
[1:31:25] the lord this morning on spiritually
[1:31:28] prepared
[1:31:30] spiritually prepared you know when god
[1:31:32] does something god doesn't do it
[1:31:34] haphazardly god doesn't do it randomly
[1:31:37] but god is very specific in his details
[1:31:41] and in his actions god did not just say
[1:31:43] mos or noah go and build a boat but he
[1:31:47] gives him specific dimensions to build
[1:31:50] the ark he gives him specific structural
[1:31:53] instructions how many stories where the
[1:31:55] window is going to go where the door is
[1:31:57] going to go god was very specific in
[1:32:01] doing this and what he was doing was he
[1:32:03] was making preparations for an oncoming
[1:32:06] storm that would be hitting the earth as
[1:32:08] brother adam preached about the memorial
[1:32:10] down here from the storm of 28 how there
[1:32:13] was an oncoming storm and there were
[1:32:15] some people that prepared for it and
[1:32:17] there were other people that didn't make
[1:32:19] preparations yet god sent warnings
[1:32:22] brother branham said in every age god
[1:32:24] sends a warning before he sends a
[1:32:26] judgment and in every age there's a
[1:32:28] message of deliverance that goes forth
[1:32:31] but that very message of deliverance if
[1:32:33] it's not received will become a message
[1:32:35] of judgment to others the very message
[1:32:38] that came to send a prophet into the
[1:32:41] land to set the children of israel free
[1:32:43] it was a message of deliverance but it
[1:32:45] became a message of judgment to the
[1:32:48] egyptians because they turned it down
[1:32:50] the very message of deliverance and
[1:32:52] noah's day that god sent a message to
[1:32:54] save noah and his family that very
[1:32:56] message became a message of judgment to
[1:32:59] those that rejected it but there was a
[1:33:01] group in every age that was being
[1:33:03] spiritually prepared for what was coming
[1:33:06] down the road
[1:33:07] and so god is very specific in his
[1:33:09] details to noah and he says build it in
[1:33:12] this dimension well maybe somebody could
[1:33:14] come along and look at it and say noah
[1:33:16] why are you building this boat so big
[1:33:17] why your family is so small your
[1:33:19] congregation is so small why do you need
[1:33:22] a boat this big we've got boats noah but
[1:33:24] our boats aren't this big i went down to
[1:33:26] the store and bought a boat and it's
[1:33:28] floating out here on the lake but it's
[1:33:30] never rained you're not going to need a
[1:33:31] boat that big you're not going to need a
[1:33:33] boat to that's how many years you've
[1:33:35] been building on this thing 80 90 100
[1:33:38] years why do you need a boat so big
[1:33:40] because god said so
[1:33:43] because god said to do it this way but
[1:33:45] we've got a better way i don't care what
[1:33:47] your way is i'll do it god's way because
[1:33:50] he was spiritually preparing his family
[1:33:53] for the judgments that were coming
[1:33:55] hebrews chapter 11 verse 7 says by faith
[1:33:59] noah being warned of god of things not
[1:34:02] seen as yet moved with fear prepared an
[1:34:05] ark
[1:34:06] to the saving of his household by the
[1:34:09] which he condemned the world and became
[1:34:11] heir of the righteousness which is by
[1:34:14] faith he was making preparations
[1:34:17] something about it if you've really got
[1:34:18] faith in the word of god you won't just
[1:34:21] talk about it but you'll actually go
[1:34:22] into action and you'll begin to make
[1:34:25] preparations for what the word of god
[1:34:27] said
[1:34:30] oh my god
[1:34:32] somebody said we're expecting a baby
[1:34:34] well have you bought any baby clothes
[1:34:35] have you painted the baby room have you
[1:34:37] went out and got the crib well no well i
[1:34:39] don't know how great your expectations
[1:34:41] are if you have expectations you'll go
[1:34:44] and it put you into action to make
[1:34:46] preparations brother nathan i'm going to
[1:34:48] marry a wife and you're out here in debt
[1:34:51] and don't have a house to bring her to
[1:34:53] and don't have a job that'll provide for
[1:34:55] i question if you're really concerned
[1:34:59] enough to be making preparations that
[1:35:01] you may not have the faith to put into
[1:35:03] action what's your words say
[1:35:05] if you are if you are looking for
[1:35:08] something you make preparations for if
[1:35:10] you're looking for a blessing to come
[1:35:12] you know if i was looking for for a
[1:35:15] truck full of gold bricks to back up to
[1:35:17] my house tomorrow and just deliver all
[1:35:20] this millions of dollars in gold i would
[1:35:22] make preparations brother jack i would
[1:35:24] take the money that i had i would buy
[1:35:25] the biggest safe that i would find or
[1:35:27] i'd take out the biggest safety deposit
[1:35:29] box at the bank what are you doing
[1:35:31] brother nathan i'm making preparations
[1:35:33] because i have a blessing coming
[1:35:36] many times we don't prepare well i
[1:35:38] believe god will do this and god will do
[1:35:40] that but we don't make any preparations
[1:35:42] to put into action our faith
[1:35:45] i believe we should exercise our faith
[1:35:48] you know if you want to go out here and
[1:35:50] get her an arm wrestling contest or a
[1:35:52] muscle building contest you have to go
[1:35:54] and actually exercise those muscles if
[1:35:57] you want to stand a chance at whatever
[1:35:58] it is that you're trying to achieve if
[1:36:00] you're going to be a high jumper or a
[1:36:02] basketball player or a football player
[1:36:04] you don't just walk out there and say
[1:36:05] give me the ball i'm going to throw it
[1:36:07] farther than anybody has ever thrown it
[1:36:09] you have to practice
[1:36:10] you have to exercise and so we're going
[1:36:13] to have rapturing faith how can we have
[1:36:15] rapturing faith when we're not even
[1:36:17] exercising our faith for healing and for
[1:36:20] the restoration of our family and for
[1:36:22] prodigal sons to come back
[1:36:25] for deliverance of our own things that
[1:36:27] we go through he said i got addictions
[1:36:29] brother nathan i'm tempted and i'm just
[1:36:31] you know what'll overcome it your faith
[1:36:33] brother man said overcome those things a
[1:36:35] few times and watch how much sweeter it
[1:36:37] is to you
[1:36:38] he said the greatest thing samson could
[1:36:40] come up against to that point in time in
[1:36:42] his life was that lion but when he
[1:36:43] overcome it that honey out of the lion
[1:36:46] from his victory was the sweetest honey
[1:36:48] he'd ever tasted
[1:36:50] looking at the unseen 1959 but noah
[1:36:54] because that god said it's going to rain
[1:36:56] he saw the rain coming a hundred and
[1:36:59] twenty years before one drop fell
[1:37:02] and made preparations to get away from
[1:37:06] it i'm so glad that by faith we can see
[1:37:09] afar the coming of the lord jesus and
[1:37:12] make preparations to get out of this old
[1:37:15] world that's going to be burned sometime
[1:37:17] with unquenchable fire
[1:37:20] the scripture says in proverbs 29 verse
[1:37:23] 18 where there's no vision that people
[1:37:26] perish
[1:37:27] where there's no vision now we've seen
[1:37:29] this in every age that men would come
[1:37:31] along and and you know there would be
[1:37:33] reformations that would rise up and
[1:37:35] they'd begin to walk into a little bit
[1:37:37] of light and a little bit of truth but
[1:37:39] then they wouldn't look ahead down the
[1:37:41] road at what was coming and there would
[1:37:43] be a dispensation change or there would
[1:37:46] be a changing of church age or there
[1:37:48] would be a changing of pressure from
[1:37:50] from one age to another from the lion
[1:37:52] age to the ox age to the man age to the
[1:37:55] eagle age and those who weren't prepared
[1:37:58] they got caught behind in an age that a
[1:38:00] dispensation that no longer was and they
[1:38:03] failed to recognize the changing of the
[1:38:05] dispensation of god brother bam said any
[1:38:07] man can build a brick wall and just go
[1:38:10] along and lay up bricks but when it
[1:38:11] comes to turning a corner it takes a
[1:38:13] real brick mason to be able to do that
[1:38:15] and so in each age a corner was turned
[1:38:18] and there would be a group of people who
[1:38:20] were spiritually prepared to see there's
[1:38:22] something taking place we're rising to a
[1:38:25] higher octave to a higher plane to a
[1:38:28] higher level and they recognized the
[1:38:30] changing of dispensation and walked in
[1:38:32] that light because they were spiritually
[1:38:34] prepared but yet there were others that
[1:38:36] remained back and didn't follow on to
[1:38:38] the move of god of what he was doing in
[1:38:40] that age and so we recognize brother
[1:38:42] branham said the only way we'll make it
[1:38:44] in this age is by a spiritually prepared
[1:38:47] church
[1:38:48] by a bible a scripturally trained church
[1:38:52] scripturally trained
[1:38:54] so we want to make sure that you know
[1:38:56] we're not just haphazardly trying to cut
[1:38:59] and paste things together that don't
[1:39:00] match but we want to make sure that
[1:39:02] scripture lines up with scripture line
[1:39:04] up online precept upon precept if you
[1:39:07] bring your doctrine and it doesn't come
[1:39:09] through this word then paul said let
[1:39:11] every man's word be a lie but god's word
[1:39:14] be the truth he said if any man come and
[1:39:16] teach any other gospel than what we've
[1:39:18] brought you then let him be accursed
[1:39:20] even though it be a minister or an angel
[1:39:22] from heaven so we want to go back and
[1:39:24] make sure that what we believe is lying
[1:39:27] upon line precept upon priesthood well
[1:39:29] brothers so-and-so is teaching it this
[1:39:31] way and this group believes it that way
[1:39:33] this group's doing it that way but what
[1:39:35] does the word say
[1:39:38] what does the word say the only thing
[1:39:40] that is going to get us out of here is
[1:39:42] the baptism of the holy ghost and you
[1:39:45] can't have a birth on a false word
[1:39:47] because the holy spirit will only honor
[1:39:49] his word
[1:39:51] why would he give his word and then come
[1:39:52] and change it and say well that was for
[1:39:54] another day no he honors his word
[1:39:57] so where there is no vision the people
[1:39:59] perish so we want to be people of vision
[1:40:02] people who can look down the road like
[1:40:03] noah did and see that the rain was
[1:40:06] coming and make spiritual preparations
[1:40:08] we by faith look down the road and we
[1:40:10] see there's a rapture coming there's a
[1:40:12] coming there's a resurrection of the
[1:40:14] dead that's coming there's a body change
[1:40:17] that's coming and so we want to be
[1:40:19] spiritually prepared that when that time
[1:40:21] comes we don't miss out
[1:40:24] matthew 24 and verse 15 if you want to
[1:40:27] turn with me this morning we'll read a
[1:40:28] few verses there they asked jesus three
[1:40:31] questions here and brother brahman said
[1:40:33] he answers them the three answers back
[1:40:35] to it and he's warning them about when
[1:40:39] when uh titus would come and and attack
[1:40:42] jerusalem he's giving them spiritual
[1:40:45] preparations for the judgment that's
[1:40:48] lying ahead now this was not the great
[1:40:50] white throne judgment this was not the
[1:40:52] great tribulation period but this was a
[1:40:55] judgment that would strike in israel
[1:40:57] there in the early church age and and
[1:41:00] jesus tells them in matthew 24 15 when
[1:41:03] you therefore shall see the abomination
[1:41:06] of desolation spoke of by daniel the
[1:41:08] prophet stand in the holy place do so
[1:41:10] readeth let him understand then let them
[1:41:13] which be in judea flee into the
[1:41:15] mountains let them which is on the
[1:41:18] housetop not come down to take anything
[1:41:20] out of his house neither let him which
[1:41:22] is in the field return back to take his
[1:41:24] clothes and woe unto them that are
[1:41:27] without child unto them that give suck
[1:41:29] in those days but pray that your flight
[1:41:32] be not in the winter neither on the
[1:41:34] sabbath day now he's spiritually
[1:41:36] preparing the believer that there's a
[1:41:39] there's something coming there's a
[1:41:41] persecution coming there's a destruction
[1:41:43] coming but i'm going to give you warning
[1:41:46] signs that when you see this begin to
[1:41:48] take place and when you begin to see
[1:41:49] that to take place remember what the
[1:41:52] warning was and make sure that you're
[1:41:54] out of this city by that time to where
[1:41:57] the histories tell us that there wasn't
[1:41:59] one christian that was remaining in
[1:42:01] jerusalem at that time uniting time in
[1:42:04] sign 1963 brother bam said there wasn't
[1:42:06] one of them christians caught in there
[1:42:08] for they saw the sign and moved all
[1:42:11] right
[1:42:13] notice it's not just enough to see the
[1:42:15] sign but you have to see the sign and
[1:42:18] move
[1:42:19] you have to see the sign and recognize i
[1:42:22] believe the sign so i'm going to be put
[1:42:24] into action
[1:42:26] it's going to put me into action not
[1:42:28] just to not just to intellectually be
[1:42:30] smarter than the methodist or the
[1:42:32] baptist or the presbyterian well i have
[1:42:34] a greater understanding of the word but
[1:42:36] what did that great understanding do for
[1:42:38] you
[1:42:40] well i i know what the seals are but
[1:42:42] what did it mean to you personally
[1:42:44] well i don't know brother nathan what
[1:42:46] does it mean to you it means to me that
[1:42:48] i'm redeemed
[1:42:49] that because he came and took the book
[1:42:51] of redemption that now i know like john
[1:42:53] did john began to rejoice we looked at
[1:42:55] it a little bit and he got so happy
[1:42:57] because he recognized that his name was
[1:43:00] on the book and there was one worthy
[1:43:01] that had come to redeem it
[1:43:06] the seals aren't just something to make
[1:43:07] us intellectually smarter than the
[1:43:09] denominations
[1:43:11] it's something that brings revelation
[1:43:13] that brings quickening power that brings
[1:43:15] stimulation of revelation to recognize
[1:43:18] what we once were and what god's called
[1:43:20] us to
[1:43:22] wasn't one of them christians caught in
[1:43:24] there for they saw the sign and moved
[1:43:26] see they said let them that's on the
[1:43:28] housetop come not down or him that's in
[1:43:30] the field go back take not his coat but
[1:43:32] flee into judea and pray that your
[1:43:34] flight be not in the winter time or the
[1:43:36] sabbath because in the winter time the
[1:43:38] hills would be full of snow and on the
[1:43:39] sabbath day the doors would close the
[1:43:41] gate and they'd be caught in that
[1:43:43] conditioned sea we want to get on that
[1:43:45] pretty soon about how god does those
[1:43:47] things if the lord willing so we believe
[1:43:50] god still does those things he still
[1:43:52] gives warning and makes preparations now
[1:43:54] in the mark of the beast and the seal of
[1:43:56] god brother branham goes on to say in
[1:43:57] 1961 but those jews they all went into
[1:44:00] jerusalem and they said now we'll gather
[1:44:03] to the house of the lord and great
[1:44:05] jehovah who's always been with us will
[1:44:08] come down and he will drive away the
[1:44:11] armies of titus that's what it will do
[1:44:13] but what did they do they had sinned
[1:44:15] against the holy ghost they made fun of
[1:44:17] the power of the holy ghost in operation
[1:44:20] and they came in there expecting god to
[1:44:22] come on the scene but god had already
[1:44:24] come on the scene and they failed to
[1:44:27] recognize it
[1:44:28] and because he had already come on the
[1:44:30] scene he'd given them instructions and
[1:44:32] warning but they failed to recognize it
[1:44:35] so one group was spiritually prepared
[1:44:38] and bypassed the judgments and another
[1:44:41] group was caught right in the midst of
[1:44:42] it
[1:44:45] exodus chapter 23.
[1:44:48] i remember i was probably sitting
[1:44:50] right about where brother
[1:44:52] fuhrman and sister april are
[1:44:55] and
[1:44:56] a couple of sisters got up to sing
[1:44:58] 21 years ago
[1:45:00] and one of them would say
[1:45:02] i'm still
[1:45:04] still
[1:45:05] still pressing my battles
[1:45:10] 20 years later 21 years later sister
[1:45:12] birds we're still pressing our battles
[1:45:13] aren't we
[1:45:15] and another would would get up and from
[1:45:17] this scripture
[1:45:18] she would sing a song that said little
[1:45:20] by little all right
[1:45:23] little by little
[1:45:27] exodus 29 23 rather verse 29 i will not
[1:45:30] drive them out from before thee in one
[1:45:32] year
[1:45:34] lest the land become desolate
[1:45:36] and the beasts of the field multiply
[1:45:39] against thee by little
[1:45:41] and by little i will drive them out from
[1:45:44] before thee
[1:45:45] until thou be increased and inherit the
[1:45:49] land
[1:45:50] so we look sometimes and think we think
[1:45:52] well why why this god and why that why
[1:45:54] did you bless brother so and so he's got
[1:45:56] 10 more square feet in his house than me
[1:45:58] and he's got 10 more dollars in his bank
[1:46:00] account than me and his car costs 10
[1:46:03] more than mine it's one year newer and
[1:46:05] it's this is that and we begin to
[1:46:07] compare with one another why this and
[1:46:08] why that why didn't you bless me with
[1:46:10] that and why haven't you taken this
[1:46:12] sickness away and why haven't you done
[1:46:13] that remember he said in his word he's
[1:46:15] not just going to give you everything at
[1:46:16] once because we wouldn't be able to
[1:46:18] handle it if he gave us everything at
[1:46:20] once but little and by
[1:46:24] little little by little and we look back
[1:46:27] down life's path brother jack and we see
[1:46:29] the hand of god moving and sometimes
[1:46:31] we're right in the moment and it's so
[1:46:33] hard for us to see his preparations and
[1:46:35] his blessings and all that he's doing
[1:46:37] for us but look back in the last 10
[1:46:39] years
[1:46:40] and think of the testimonies in your
[1:46:42] life think of the healings that you've
[1:46:44] seen think of the miracles of god think
[1:46:47] of the financial blessings and the
[1:46:49] things he's done for your family and
[1:46:51] times where you didn't know how he was
[1:46:53] going to make the house payment but god
[1:46:55] showed up
[1:46:56] [Applause]
[1:46:58] what was he doing he was preparing you
[1:47:02] [Music]
[1:47:04] he was preparing moses in a desert for
[1:47:07] 40 years
[1:47:09] and maybe after about 39 years moses
[1:47:11] thought well lord i'm just out of here
[1:47:13] and i'm just hurting these sheep and i
[1:47:15] don't feel like i'm doing anything for
[1:47:17] you lord but god was preparing him for
[1:47:19] something that was coming along he was
[1:47:21] making him he was training him a
[1:47:23] shepherd a sheep herder to the egyptians
[1:47:26] was an abomination it was something
[1:47:28] filthy so you can imagine how it must
[1:47:30] have humbled moses when he'd been raised
[1:47:32] in an egyptian culture his whole life
[1:47:34] and god says come here a minute moses
[1:47:36] i'm going to make you a shepherd for 40
[1:47:38] years
[1:47:40] and here he is in training and god
[1:47:43] training him all these years but he had
[1:47:45] a he had a opportunity and he had a
[1:47:47] commission coming where he was going to
[1:47:49] shepherd 2 million people in the
[1:47:51] wilderness and god knew this man was
[1:47:54] going to need some preparations
[1:47:56] you know we look at moses and we think
[1:47:58] goodness moses losing your temper and
[1:48:01] throwing down the tablets and smite in
[1:48:03] the rock couldn't you keep your temper
[1:48:05] my you try pastoring two million people
[1:48:07] for two days
[1:48:10] and let me know how your temper is
[1:48:14] he did it for 40 years
[1:48:18] my goodness he must have been a man of
[1:48:19] great patience
[1:48:21] and god is preparing moses because
[1:48:24] there's a group of people crying and
[1:48:26] praying for a deliverer and maybe they
[1:48:28] would go to their prayer closet at night
[1:48:31] and they pray god send us a deliverer
[1:48:33] and brother ben talks about how amram
[1:48:35] and joshua have been praying there and
[1:48:37] seeking god and god doesn't send him a
[1:48:39] captain he doesn't send him a warrior he
[1:48:42] doesn't send him a king he sends them a
[1:48:44] baby well this is going to take a while
[1:48:48] all right
[1:48:49] this is the deliver
[1:48:52] we're going to be a little wild
[1:48:55] but god was making preparations
[1:48:58] see we get impatient we get ahead of god
[1:49:01] and god hurry up god hurry up and do it
[1:49:04] but his timing is perfect
[1:49:06] [Applause]
[1:49:08] amen i'd imagine this couple right over
[1:49:09] here can testify to you his timing is
[1:49:12] perfect
[1:49:13] brother bam said the wheels are moving
[1:49:15] just right
[1:49:17] the wheels are moving just right we just
[1:49:19] have to get in the turn
[1:49:22] don't get ahead of his timing don't get
[1:49:23] ahead of his will
[1:49:25] by little and by little but brother
[1:49:27] nathan i feel like i'm doing so little
[1:49:28] just just look for opportunities and be
[1:49:32] spiritually prepared you know god can't
[1:49:33] do anything with you until you're in a
[1:49:35] condition that he can use you
[1:49:38] and so maybe he's just waiting on you to
[1:49:40] get into a condition to where he can use
[1:49:43] you
[1:49:45] first samuel chapter 17 and verse 37
[1:49:49] david said moreover
[1:49:52] the lord that delivered me
[1:49:54] out of the paw of the lion
[1:49:57] and out of the paw of the bear
[1:49:59] he will deliver me
[1:50:01] out of the hand of this philistine
[1:50:05] now i know we've heard the story of
[1:50:06] david goliath 500 times but we're going
[1:50:08] to look at it again just briefly
[1:50:11] and david here david is he's off hurting
[1:50:14] his father's sheep
[1:50:16] and puts yourself in david's shoes he
[1:50:18] was probably sitting there like a lot of
[1:50:19] us do thinking why me lord
[1:50:22] why couldn't i have been the oldest son
[1:50:25] why couldn't i have been the one out
[1:50:27] there in the army
[1:50:28] why couldn't i have been the one out
[1:50:30] there doing this and doing that and here
[1:50:31] i am stuck back here with the stinking
[1:50:34] sheep and so he'd sit down and tune up
[1:50:36] his guitar and he'd write another song
[1:50:39] nobody even out here to hear these songs
[1:50:41] why am i writing these lord
[1:50:43] why do you keep giving me these songs
[1:50:45] there's not even anybody but these sheep
[1:50:47] for me to sing it to oh don't worry
[1:50:49] david there's some people coming that
[1:50:50] are going to need those songs
[1:50:52] for their strength and their
[1:50:54] encouragement
[1:50:55] they're going to need somebody to tell
[1:50:57] them that to bless the lord and forget
[1:51:00] not his benefits
[1:51:01] to remember that he loadeth us daily
[1:51:04] with benefits and david's out there
[1:51:05] right and away i don't understand god
[1:51:07] why me poor pitiful me out here and
[1:51:09] somebody come by and hear him play and
[1:51:11] say goodness gracious what a talented
[1:51:13] young man why are you back here on the
[1:51:14] back side of the desert you should be
[1:51:16] here and you should be there well this
[1:51:17] is just what my father told me to do for
[1:51:19] now and one day a man that was in
[1:51:21] leadership a king and a ruler would get
[1:51:24] so angry and he'd say i need somebody to
[1:51:26] come and play some anointed music to get
[1:51:29] this spirit off of me and a man said hey
[1:51:31] i was traveling through the desert the
[1:51:32] other day and i happened to hear a man
[1:51:35] who was talented and and my he was
[1:51:37] cunning with the with the instruments
[1:51:39] i'll bring him and he'll play for you
[1:51:40] god was placing david at the right place
[1:51:43] at the right time and he may have been
[1:51:45] discouraged and he may have wondered how
[1:51:47] and why but god was spiritually
[1:51:49] preparing this man and maybe he talked
[1:51:52] to some of the other shepherds brother
[1:51:53] job and he'd say you all been having any
[1:51:56] any wolf problems no
[1:51:58] we had no will i hadn't seen no wolf in
[1:52:00] three years well what about you brother
[1:52:02] fuhrman you've been having any bear
[1:52:03] problems no i've seen a bear i've only
[1:52:05] heard people talk about well it seems
[1:52:07] like every time i turn around a wolf or
[1:52:09] a lion or a bear something's coming up
[1:52:11] against my sheep and oh my we've had
[1:52:13] some tight circumstances where i thought
[1:52:15] for sure i was going to lose some of my
[1:52:17] daddy's sheep and all of a sudden a
[1:52:18] little bit of anointing began to kick in
[1:52:20] and i grabbed that little sling and i
[1:52:22] got me a rock and whammy i let her go
[1:52:26] before i even knew what i was doing you
[1:52:28] know me i'm not even that good of a
[1:52:29] slinger
[1:52:31] but something struck me
[1:52:34] and i took after that line and i brought
[1:52:36] back that lamb and i took off after that
[1:52:39] bear and i got that lamb
[1:52:41] and i brought them back i don't
[1:52:42] understand why me why am i going through
[1:52:45] these things god was spiritually
[1:52:47] preparing him for something
[1:52:50] and one day he walks into camp just
[1:52:52] bringing his brothers some food and he
[1:52:54] says well you know i'm just running an
[1:52:56] errand for dad here look at all these
[1:52:57] other men and my they've got on armor
[1:53:00] and shields and spears and helmets and
[1:53:02] here i am in a little shepherd's uniform
[1:53:05] with a little leather sling in my
[1:53:06] pockets
[1:53:10] and a man happened to make a challenge
[1:53:12] on the wrong day
[1:53:16] you know he'd been making this challenge
[1:53:18] every day
[1:53:19] for day
[1:53:21] after day
[1:53:22] after day
[1:53:24] nobody took the challenge
[1:53:26] so brother troy i imagine old goliath
[1:53:29] was pretty confident that day well
[1:53:31] as he put on his helmet and
[1:53:34] his breastplate and he picked up that
[1:53:35] big old spear
[1:53:37] stepped out there
[1:53:39] he began to make his challenge
[1:53:41] he was pretty confident nobody's taken
[1:53:43] me up on it yet
[1:53:45] why should the day be any different than
[1:53:47] any other day
[1:53:49] well david was probably feeling the same
[1:53:51] way just another ordinary day no david
[1:53:54] this is the day that you become a giant
[1:53:56] slayer
[1:53:58] this is the day
[1:54:03] [Music]
[1:54:06] now i know we've got some good message
[1:54:08] trained bible trained people in here how
[1:54:10] many can recite to me the name of all of
[1:54:12] david's brothers
[1:54:20] you mean brother whisperer brother jack
[1:54:22] brother west go all these years we've
[1:54:24] been in the message and we've read our
[1:54:25] bibles i've read this book over and over
[1:54:27] and over again i can't quote you all of
[1:54:28] his brother's name
[1:54:30] but i'll remember one brother's name
[1:54:33] because he was an overcomer he was an
[1:54:36] overcomer you know the scripture says in
[1:54:38] one place there when jesus entered into
[1:54:40] jerusalem that there were two men
[1:54:42] sitting there begging
[1:54:44] two men uh oh is that a mistake in the
[1:54:46] scripture because another gospel just
[1:54:48] says it was one man
[1:54:50] but that scripture names this man so i
[1:54:53] believe there was something different
[1:54:54] about him he became a believer
[1:54:57] where this other man the other gospels
[1:54:59] don't even mention he was there
[1:55:03] something about it people remember you
[1:55:06] if you're an overcomer
[1:55:09] people will remember you
[1:55:10] if you're an overcomer
[1:55:15] this is the day that the direction of
[1:55:17] david's life would begin to change
[1:55:20] and he walks up there and this man makes
[1:55:22] a challenge and he says today i'll feed
[1:55:25] you to the birds
[1:55:27] david said goodness my that's a great
[1:55:29] prophecy well i've got a prophecy for
[1:55:30] you today i'll take your head from you
[1:55:34] now both of these prophecies has gone
[1:55:36] forth and one has to be true and one has
[1:55:39] to be false and brother brahma said when
[1:55:41] he stood there in portland oregon and
[1:55:42] that maniac charged the platform he said
[1:55:45] the that demon inside of that man made a
[1:55:48] challenge and the holy spirit accepted
[1:55:50] his challenge
[1:55:53] the thing i find interesting about that
[1:55:55] story brother solomon here this man so
[1:55:58] possessed of the devil that he comes in
[1:55:59] and he's making threats to brother
[1:56:01] branham and doesn't even realize what
[1:56:03] he's saying or doing because he
[1:56:04] worshipped that devil that he was
[1:56:06] serving and he comes and he makes this
[1:56:08] challenge on the platform the devil
[1:56:10] speaking through one man he was so
[1:56:12] anointed that the devil could speak
[1:56:14] through him
[1:56:15] you know legion was so anointed that the
[1:56:18] devil could actually speak through him
[1:56:20] didn't say my name's bob
[1:56:22] my name's joe said we are legion for we
[1:56:25] are many
[1:56:26] and he had so surrendered his life to
[1:56:29] the devil that the devil could speak
[1:56:31] through him so you mean in this age that
[1:56:33] people actually believe that the devil
[1:56:35] has more power than god that the devil
[1:56:37] can still speak through a man but god
[1:56:39] can't
[1:56:43] because trust me there's people out here
[1:56:45] that the devil are speaking through
[1:56:46] maybe you work with them maybe you go to
[1:56:48] school with them but you know what there
[1:56:50] are people that are so surrendered to
[1:56:51] the holy spirit that he can speak
[1:56:53] through him as well
[1:56:57] and this man would come to the platform
[1:56:59] and make this challenge not even knowing
[1:57:01] what he was saying and brother braham
[1:57:02] said before i knew what i was saying i
[1:57:04] said because you challenged the holy
[1:57:06] spirit tonight you'll fall at my feet so
[1:57:08] here are two men having a conversation
[1:57:10] and neither one of them are doing the
[1:57:11] talking
[1:57:14] i believe god can still move like that
[1:57:19] david makes this challenge
[1:57:21] and he goes down and gets him five
[1:57:23] little stones
[1:57:25] and he puts him in his back and he gets
[1:57:27] out one he begins to sling it and the
[1:57:28] scripture said didn't say he ran and hid
[1:57:31] behind the biggest rock he could find
[1:57:33] didn't say he asked for some help from
[1:57:35] some some bigger guys some more
[1:57:36] experienced military men it said he
[1:57:39] danced and he ran into the battle
[1:57:42] oh my
[1:57:44] he ran towards his giants
[1:57:48] you see there's something about it when
[1:57:49] god gives you a revelation you can run
[1:57:51] towards your mountain like it's not even
[1:57:53] there you can run towards your giant
[1:57:55] because you know it's going to fall
[1:57:58] you don't have to be afraid well the
[1:57:59] doctor said this and the doctor said
[1:58:01] that brother branham said even if you
[1:58:02] had cancer and didn't fear it you
[1:58:04] wouldn't be in too bad of shape
[1:58:06] it's fear is what makes the problem
[1:58:11] so we find that hebrews 13 8 says that
[1:58:14] jesus christ is the same
[1:58:17] yesterday today and forever
[1:58:21] he's always the same brother bam said
[1:58:22] he's the same in his nature he's the
[1:58:24] same in his action so he's the same if
[1:58:26] he was back there in moses's day and
[1:58:28] noah's day and and david's day he's
[1:58:31] still here
[1:58:32] we've got you know we've got some proofs
[1:58:34] of his resurrection sitting here this
[1:58:36] morning
[1:58:37] we've got the proof of his resurrection
[1:58:40] but detroit's sister tanya here
[1:58:44] brother troy's wife
[1:58:46] she came to our church a few years ago
[1:58:48] and had a cancer on her head about the
[1:58:50] size of a buckeye
[1:58:51] and us brothers prayed for and prayed
[1:58:54] the prayer of faith and in 24 hours it
[1:58:55] was gone completely
[1:58:58] same lord jesus
[1:59:06] where'd brother joe underwood go brother
[1:59:08] joe underwood jr
[1:59:09] he's got two children now don't you
[1:59:12] they tried for seven years
[1:59:15] and in a prayer line they came through
[1:59:17] and was prayed for and they've got a
[1:59:18] child now two children
[1:59:20] a double blessing
[1:59:28] i was sitting about where this brother
[1:59:30] whose wife just passed away was is
[1:59:32] sitting
[1:59:33] in a service that same weekend 21 years
[1:59:36] ago
[1:59:38] and i heard a commotion
[1:59:40] and a sister layton from our church
[1:59:42] was asking somebody to help her
[1:59:45] and her husband had went into a diabetic
[1:59:47] shock and had dined
[1:59:49] and brother wesko and
[1:59:51] brother billy paul and brother ferguson
[1:59:53] went off the platform went back and
[1:59:54] prayed for him and he came back to life
[1:59:59] [Applause]
[2:00:02] and then satan tried to take his life
[2:00:03] again and he was out for i think five
[2:00:06] minutes and they went down and prayed
[2:00:07] for him again and he walked up to this
[2:00:09] platform and dismissed in prayer
[2:00:13] same jesus
[2:00:15] yesterday today and forever
[2:00:23] you say brother nathan i'm up against a
[2:00:25] battle i don't know any way around it or
[2:00:27] over it or under it brother said that's
[2:00:29] when god shows up and takes you right
[2:00:30] through the middle of it
[2:00:34] these testimonies paul said are for our
[2:00:36] examples or examples that that we have
[2:00:39] examples that we can look back not just
[2:00:41] to the days of the bible not just to the
[2:00:43] prayer lines of the fifties but we can
[2:00:45] look back memories in this church and my
[2:00:47] church and brother jack's church and
[2:00:49] these other churches represented we can
[2:00:51] see the miraculous that god has done and
[2:00:54] then a trial comes up and we begin to
[2:00:55] panic and to worry and to fear what
[2:00:57] about ukraine what about russia what
[2:00:59] about the economy what about
[2:01:00] cryptocurrency what about biden what
[2:01:02] about this what about coronavirus well
[2:01:05] god's brought us safely thus far
[2:01:08] through many dangers toils and snares i
[2:01:11] have already come
[2:01:13] his grace has brought me
[2:01:17] thus far
[2:01:19] and it's his grace will lead me on
[2:01:24] i remember riding in a car
[2:01:27] with brother jack's daughter zandy and
[2:01:30] and with caleb wesko and and i can't
[2:01:32] remember if rachel was with us or not
[2:01:34] but brother trevor and i we were going
[2:01:36] following you all to brother danny's to
[2:01:38] preach a youth service years ago
[2:01:40] and they got to talking about dr martin
[2:01:43] luther king jr speech
[2:01:45] and we actually listened to the audio of
[2:01:47] it and i'd heard portions of it but i'd
[2:01:49] never heard the thing in its entirety
[2:01:50] and something jumped out to me brother
[2:01:52] wesco that i'd never heard before you
[2:01:54] hear all these quotes from the speech
[2:01:55] but dr king in that speech he said makes
[2:01:58] this statement that you know for the uh
[2:02:01] for the
[2:02:02] the human rights movements and things
[2:02:04] like that that was wonderful but to a
[2:02:05] believer it means a little more to us
[2:02:07] he made this statement he said 1963 is
[2:02:10] not the end
[2:02:12] but 1963 is a beginning
[2:02:15] well and the the bride of jesus christ
[2:02:17] today amen
[2:02:18] [Applause]
[2:02:20] when brother banham came and preached
[2:02:21] the seals in 1963 that wasn't the end he
[2:02:24] said it became a new book to him
[2:02:26] amen it was just a beginning for the
[2:02:28] bride of christ
[2:02:29] it was when we begin to recognize you
[2:02:31] know what this is more than a sign but
[2:02:33] there's a voice that's following behind
[2:02:35] the sign
[2:02:36] [Applause]
[2:02:38] amen that voice was not just to make us
[2:02:40] smarter than the denominations
[2:02:42] you know i asked our church recently i
[2:02:44] said you know
[2:02:45] down through the ages now saint paul
[2:02:46] being a prophet setting the church in
[2:02:48] order in the first church age he was a
[2:02:50] prophet messenger then for five
[2:02:52] consecutive church ages we never had
[2:02:55] another prophet messenger there were
[2:02:57] reformers but there were no restorations
[2:02:59] they were just reformations and there
[2:03:01] was no prophet that would come so why in
[2:03:04] this age why in the last stage the
[2:03:06] seventh church age when there had just
[2:03:08] been reformation reformation reformation
[2:03:10] why would we need a complete restoration
[2:03:12] there were good people in those ages
[2:03:14] there were good people in luther's day
[2:03:16] and wesley's day and yet many of them
[2:03:18] baptizing and tidal still many of them
[2:03:20] smoking cigars and pipes and things and
[2:03:23] yet yet they were they had the word for
[2:03:25] their day and they were walking in the
[2:03:26] light that they saw why would we need a
[2:03:28] restoration in this age
[2:03:31] because this age would go the way that
[2:03:33] enoch went the way no other age had gone
[2:03:36] this age luther's age didn't need
[2:03:38] rapturing faith they were going to go
[2:03:40] the way of the grave and take a
[2:03:42] resurrection wesley's age didn't need
[2:03:44] rapturing faith nor did martin or
[2:03:46] irenaeus or columba they didn't need
[2:03:48] rapturing faith but this age needed a
[2:03:51] word that would take us back to the
[2:03:52] original that would produce a rapturing
[2:03:55] faith that would literally turn our
[2:03:57] hearts back to the pentecostal fathers
[2:04:03] oh i'm thankful for eyes to see it
[2:04:06] revelations chapter 5 and verse 4.
[2:04:10] john he's speaking here if you go back a
[2:04:12] few verses
[2:04:13] one of the one of the angels spoken and
[2:04:16] said who's worthy
[2:04:18] to take the book and to loose the seals
[2:04:20] thereof
[2:04:21] and they looked through all of heaven
[2:04:23] and through all of earth and the seas
[2:04:25] and things under the earth and there
[2:04:26] wasn't anybody
[2:04:28] that was found worthy there was no
[2:04:29] prophet there was no priest there was no
[2:04:32] pastor no deacon no king
[2:04:36] that was worthy to lose this book
[2:04:39] and i wept much because no man was found
[2:04:42] worthy to open and to read the book
[2:04:44] neither to look thereon
[2:04:47] and he begins to weep much but one of
[2:04:48] the elders comes up and says john
[2:04:51] don't weep
[2:04:53] there's a lion that's gone forth
[2:04:57] to conquer
[2:04:58] and he looks around and he's expecting
[2:05:00] to see a lion but he looks around he
[2:05:02] sees a lamb as though it had been slain
[2:05:05] from the foundation of the world
[2:05:09] and says he's worthy
[2:05:12] this one's worthy
[2:05:13] and verse 13 says in every creature
[2:05:16] which is in heaven and on the earth and
[2:05:18] under the earth and such as are in the
[2:05:20] sea and all that are in them heard i
[2:05:21] sang blessing and honor and glory and
[2:05:24] power being to him that sitteth upon the
[2:05:26] throne hunting to the lamb forever and
[2:05:28] ever people get a little worried if you
[2:05:29] get too loud in church but john got loud
[2:05:31] enough that everybody in heaven
[2:05:33] everybody in earth and everybody under
[2:05:35] the earth
[2:05:37] everybody in the sea
[2:05:39] heard john say blessing and glory and
[2:05:41] honor he was excited because he
[2:05:43] recognized there was one that was worthy
[2:05:46] to come and take the book of redemption
[2:05:48] that he couldn't be redeemed unless
[2:05:50] there was one worthy but he saw a lamb
[2:05:57] verse 8 says the lamb slain from the
[2:05:59] foundation of the world that means
[2:06:00] before you needed redemption god was
[2:06:02] already making spiritual preparations
[2:06:04] for your redemption
[2:06:07] ephesians chapter 1 verse 4 says
[2:06:09] according has he hath chosen us in him
[2:06:12] before the foundation of the world
[2:06:15] means before you had a need before adam
[2:06:17] ever fell god didn't have to get the
[2:06:19] angels together and have a conference
[2:06:21] and say
[2:06:21] gabriel michael wormwood we need to get
[2:06:24] together and have a plan we need to have
[2:06:25] a conference so we can get a plan of
[2:06:27] redemption he already had a plan of
[2:06:29] redemption
[2:06:32] and not only that but he had chosen you
[2:06:34] in him if he was ever part of him he
[2:06:37] chose you and him before the foundation
[2:06:38] of the world we were having a little
[2:06:41] fellowship with a few brothers a while
[2:06:42] back and don't get me wrong i'm not
[2:06:44] saying this to make grace a disgrace i
[2:06:46] don't believe i believe if you love the
[2:06:47] lord you should live for him and that if
[2:06:49] he's if he saved you and gave his life
[2:06:51] for you that you ought to love him and
[2:06:53] respect him enough to live for him
[2:06:55] but if you was chosen in him before the
[2:06:58] foundation of the world but the realm
[2:06:59] said if he could do that before you had
[2:07:01] any choice in it what can he do through
[2:07:02] you now that you have a choice in it
[2:07:06] and i asked this question because you
[2:07:08] know we see sometimes maybe somebody
[2:07:10] will go the way of the grave and we're
[2:07:11] not really certain well what were they
[2:07:13] ready were they prepared uh what takes
[2:07:15] place and we try to play judge and jury
[2:07:17] and all of that but i asked this
[2:07:19] question
[2:07:20] if he came
[2:07:21] at my worst
[2:07:25] if he came at my worst
[2:07:27] would it change my election
[2:07:33] if he came at my worst brother jack
[2:07:36] you say oh you just don't know my worst
[2:07:38] brother nathan but but look at where
[2:07:40] you're at now look where god's brought
[2:07:41] you from
[2:07:43] so if he chose you and brought you that
[2:07:45] far
[2:07:46] then then no matter what time he came or
[2:07:48] what time he took you it couldn't change
[2:07:50] your election
[2:07:53] brother ram talked about brother ramsey
[2:07:55] you know the minister brother there that
[2:07:56] he said
[2:07:57] he said he he said i don't love him
[2:07:59] anymore i don't love the lord anymore
[2:08:02] and brother bam said oh you don't mean
[2:08:04] that brother rams he said no i don't i
[2:08:06] don't serve him anymore if i
[2:08:08] if i loved him i'd serve him and he had
[2:08:10] a little boy going run across the river
[2:08:12] and buy him some alcohol because he
[2:08:13] couldn't buy alcohol on sunday and he
[2:08:15] died
[2:08:18] brother branham said god took him home
[2:08:21] [Music]
[2:08:24] so if you want to be mad when you get
[2:08:25] over there that brother ramsey's there
[2:08:27] you get mad but you know what there's
[2:08:28] nobody that the lord could give eternal
[2:08:30] life that i'd be mad about
[2:08:33] no
[2:08:35] if he's if he saved me in my condition
[2:08:37] anybody he wants to save is fine with me
[2:08:40] brother wesko
[2:08:41] i won't be standing there at the gate
[2:08:43] saying nope you're not worthy nope
[2:08:45] you're not worthy
[2:08:46] [Music]
[2:08:48] because you know what paul's testimony
[2:08:50] went out will be when i get there and i
[2:08:52] say paul how did you make it here what's
[2:08:54] your testimony unmerited grace
[2:08:57] and when i asked brother branham and
[2:08:59] moses and noah and david and they turn
[2:09:02] around and ask me how did you survive
[2:09:04] how'd you overcome in laodicea unmerited
[2:09:07] grace
[2:09:10] just his amazing grace
[2:09:13] so anybody he wants to save is fine with
[2:09:15] me
[2:09:18] nathaniel saith unto him saint john
[2:09:21] verse 1 48 or chapter 1 verse 48.
[2:09:23] nathanael sayeth unto him
[2:09:25] whence knowest thou me
[2:09:28] jesus answered and said unto him before
[2:09:30] that philip called thee
[2:09:32] when thou was under the fig tree
[2:09:35] i saw thee
[2:09:37] he knew you when you were under your fig
[2:09:39] tree
[2:09:41] maybe maybe he would say it this way to
[2:09:43] us before somebody gave your parents
[2:09:45] that tape or before your sister talks
[2:09:48] you into going up to new york or before
[2:09:51] somebody invited you to rapturing faith
[2:09:53] tabernacle or the spirit and truth
[2:09:55] tabernacle before you they before they
[2:09:58] invited you before they called you i saw
[2:10:01] you
[2:10:02] in fact before the foundation of the
[2:10:04] world i saw you and i knew where you'd
[2:10:06] be i knew what your fig tree would be i
[2:10:09] knew where i'd find you maybe it was on
[2:10:11] a bar stool maybe it was in an alley
[2:10:13] maybe it was covered up with man-made
[2:10:15] traditions and denominational dogmas he
[2:10:18] knew where you'd be when he'd find you
[2:10:21] and he was making preparations for you
[2:10:25] spiritually prepared
[2:10:28] believe us thou this 1950 brother
[2:10:30] branham talks about you know i've got a
[2:10:32] i've got a tree in our front yard that
[2:10:34] the developers of our of our
[2:10:36] neighborhood they they planted a tree in
[2:10:38] the front yard of each
[2:10:40] of each house there in our neighborhood
[2:10:42] when they built them and and on ours
[2:10:43] they planted an oak tree
[2:10:45] and so it began to grow up and it's got
[2:10:48] to be a decent sized street now almost
[2:10:50] 17 years later after we bought the house
[2:10:52] and and every every fall you know
[2:10:55] there'll be trees in our in our back
[2:10:57] behind our fence there that they'll
[2:10:59] they'll begin to drop leaves everywhere
[2:11:01] but this old oak tree it'll drop maybe a
[2:11:03] few leaves and then all winter those
[2:11:05] leaves will just hang on there
[2:11:07] and you'll think goodness there's
[2:11:08] something wrong with this tree
[2:11:10] doesn't this tree know that it's fall
[2:11:12] doesn't this tree know that it's winter
[2:11:15] all the leaves are still on it
[2:11:17] but brother mama says old oak tree you
[2:11:20] have around here holds its leaves all
[2:11:21] winter long
[2:11:23] spring of the year comes you don't have
[2:11:25] to go pick the old leaves off
[2:11:28] just let the new life come in and the
[2:11:31] old leaf drops off
[2:11:33] that's the way it is let christ come
[2:11:36] into the heart
[2:11:37] the rest of it will take care of itself
[2:11:40] that's right just get jesus in the heart
[2:11:43] it'll take care of the rest
[2:11:47] we go around we tell everybody what they
[2:11:48] got to do what do i have to do to be
[2:11:50] saved we tell them what they don't got
[2:11:52] to do don't do this and don't do that
[2:11:54] don't cut your hair and don't wear your
[2:11:56] skirts too short and don't wear this and
[2:11:57] don't wear that and don't don't don't
[2:12:00] drink this and don't smoke that at all
[2:12:01] but when the philippian jailer came and
[2:12:03] said sirs what was we do to be saved
[2:12:06] paul didn't tell him all the don'ts he
[2:12:07] told him the dues
[2:12:10] repent and be baptized in the name of
[2:12:12] the lord jesus christ and you and your
[2:12:14] house will be saved and he didn't have
[2:12:16] to come along and check oh my philippian
[2:12:19] jailer my
[2:12:22] no
[2:12:22] still got some leaves there my goodness
[2:12:26] oh my oh look at that right in that ear
[2:12:29] can you believe that don't you know what
[2:12:30] that's a sign of brother don't you
[2:12:34] he didn't have to go along and do that
[2:12:37] but when the life of christ came in
[2:12:39] those old dead leaves begin to push off
[2:12:42] on their own
[2:12:44] you see we try to we try to paint
[2:12:46] holiness on the outside and say look
[2:12:47] just look like us
[2:12:49] and you'll be a christian
[2:12:51] that's a pharisee
[2:12:53] but when the life comes on the inside
[2:12:56] you don't got to go pick off the old
[2:12:57] leaves
[2:12:58] and say i don't like that leaf and i
[2:13:00] like you can't come to church with that
[2:13:02] leaf
[2:13:04] but the life of christ
[2:13:06] spiritually prepares the believer and it
[2:13:09] begins to push off those old dead things
[2:13:11] of the world and new life comes
[2:13:14] on praise the lord
[2:13:19] i'm trying to close
[2:13:23] we sang longer than i was expecting but
[2:13:25] i'm going to try not to preach longer
[2:13:26] than we was expecting
[2:13:29] that's all right i love good stephen
[2:13:30] singing you know what there's going to
[2:13:32] be
[2:13:32] can you imagine how much we're going to
[2:13:34] sing in heaven
[2:13:36] people that don't want to go to church
[2:13:37] but say they want to go to heaven i
[2:13:38] think do you know what heaven is
[2:13:42] has anybody explained to you what we're
[2:13:43] going to do in heaven oh but i don't
[2:13:45] like going to church well you probably
[2:13:46] won't like heaven very much
[2:13:54] expectation 1961 brother batman says
[2:13:56] there's only two elements in the world
[2:13:58] that control the world tonight that's
[2:14:00] fear and faith
[2:14:02] now once you notice this is 1961.
[2:14:05] this isn't 2022. but listen to his next
[2:14:08] words
[2:14:09] russia is trying to get everybody to
[2:14:10] fear them
[2:14:12] and we're trying to get everybody to
[2:14:13] have faith in god
[2:14:15] sounds like this morning's newspaper
[2:14:17] don't it
[2:14:18] that's the difference that two elements
[2:14:21] controls the nations controls the people
[2:14:23] controls all churches controls
[2:14:25] individuals is fear
[2:14:27] or faith
[2:14:29] so when you go to do something when you
[2:14:30] walk in these church doors you're either
[2:14:32] living by fear or you're living by faith
[2:14:36] i don't know about you i want to walk by
[2:14:37] faith
[2:14:38] i tell my brother all the time i drive
[2:14:40] by faith not by sight
[2:14:44] but russia is trying to get people to
[2:14:46] fear them and you know what we look at
[2:14:48] we can you can look at the news you can
[2:14:50] pick up a newspaper you can listen to
[2:14:52] the radio and you hear the tone of the
[2:14:55] voices the fear in the in the reporters
[2:14:57] voices you recognize they haven't been
[2:15:00] prepared for what's taking place
[2:15:02] but this isn't something new to the
[2:15:04] believer
[2:15:05] this is something that a prophet got up
[2:15:07] in the 1930s and shared seven villa
[2:15:09] visions in jeffersonville a little block
[2:15:12] tabernacle and said watch russia the
[2:15:14] king of the north watch russia watch
[2:15:17] russia watch russia but you know what he
[2:15:19] never said fear russia
[2:15:23] go ahead and type it into the message
[2:15:25] type it into the bible type it in
[2:15:27] wherever you want i never find those
[2:15:28] words fear russia
[2:15:30] but watch russia
[2:15:32] he told us about an earthquake that
[2:15:33] would take los angeles under he told us
[2:15:36] about atomic bombs
[2:15:38] he warned us about diseases and viruses
[2:15:41] and pandemics and plagues and natural
[2:15:44] disasters and the economy and bailouts
[2:15:46] and crooked politics and sodom
[2:15:48] conditions well i asked you was he wrong
[2:15:54] and more people leaving the message now
[2:15:56] than ever and i look around think mine
[2:15:57] these are vindications that what we've
[2:15:59] been following is the truth
[2:16:02] [Applause]
[2:16:04] if you can read a newspaper you can
[2:16:06] recognize we have been spiritually
[2:16:08] prepared for what is coming in this age
[2:16:13] and so it gives us a peace
[2:16:15] because jesus said in matthew 24 verse 6
[2:16:18] ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars
[2:16:21] see that you be not troubled
[2:16:23] for all these things must come to pass
[2:16:25] but the end is not yet for nation shall
[2:16:27] rise against nation and kingdom against
[2:16:30] kingdom and there shall be famines and
[2:16:32] pestilence and earthquakes and divers
[2:16:34] places and saint luke 21 verse 25 says
[2:16:37] and there shall be signs in the sun
[2:16:39] and in the moon and in the stars and
[2:16:42] upon the earth distress of nations with
[2:16:45] perplexity the sea and the waves roaring
[2:16:49] men's hearts failing them for fear and
[2:16:52] for looking after those things which are
[2:16:54] coming on the earth for the powers of
[2:16:56] heaven shall be shaken and then shall
[2:16:59] you they see the son of man coming in a
[2:17:01] cloud
[2:17:03] with power and great glory
[2:17:06] will i ask you have we seen it
[2:17:08] amen and when these things begin to come
[2:17:11] to pass then look up didn't say look
[2:17:14] down and get discouraged
[2:17:17] didn't say when when you see these
[2:17:18] things come argue get together and have
[2:17:20] a big debate with a bunch of ministers
[2:17:22] and argue about quotes and scriptures
[2:17:24] and fuss and fight didn't say get
[2:17:26] discouraged didn't say blast everybody
[2:17:28] else in the message said when you see
[2:17:29] these things look up
[2:17:33] lift up your heads
[2:17:35] for your redemption draweth night
[2:17:38] all of these things that are taking
[2:17:40] place they're not things that make us
[2:17:41] afraid
[2:17:42] they're things to make us recognize
[2:17:44] that we've been spiritually prepared and
[2:17:47] now we see the signs and it's not time
[2:17:49] to sit home and criticize or or to get
[2:17:52] discouraged and give up and quit it's
[2:17:54] time to lift up our heads and recognize
[2:17:56] our redemption is drawing nine recognize
[2:17:59] that we're blessed because we've been
[2:18:01] spiritually prepared for what god is
[2:18:03] doing in this age
[2:18:04] amen let's bow our heads together
[2:18:09] lord jesus
[2:18:12] lord we thank you for spiritual
[2:18:13] preparations

[2:18:24] this age lord that you sent a message to

[2:19:25] say from that time from that church in
[2:19:28] west palm beach i was standing there one
[2:19:30] morning and the presence of god came
[2:19:32] sleeping in the room and i recognized i
[2:19:35] wasn't ready that i needed to make
[2:19:36] spiritual preparations and god came and
[2:19:39] dealt with my heart and from that time
[2:19:41] those old leaves of the world began to
[2:19:43] push off and i've been a different
[2:19:45] person since that time lord may it be
[2:19:47] this morning lord may it be a time of
[2:19:50] rededication for each of us lord if if

[2:20:56] so brother nathan was just kind of
[2:20:59] winding down and
[2:21:01] pointing out so many of the prophecies
[2:21:04] that
[2:21:04] uh brother branham told us and we're
[2:21:07] just watching them be fulfilled right
[2:21:09] before our very eyes
[2:21:11] not for us to be fearful
[2:21:13] uh in this hour but to a man be prepared
[2:21:17] to be prepared
[2:21:18] i was just having a conversation with
[2:21:20] somebody um
[2:21:22] recently and
[2:21:24] they they asked me a question you know
[2:21:26] we're talking about the message and the
[2:21:28] ask me questions say
[2:21:30] uh is there
[2:21:31] anything that i could bring to you
[2:21:34] that would cause you to reconsider
[2:21:38] what you believe in the message
[2:21:42] and um i knew it was a trick question
[2:21:46] so
[2:21:46] uh
[2:21:48] my answer you know to that was uh i mean
[2:21:51] based on what i see and what what has
[2:21:52] already been manifested you know through
[2:21:55] brother random's life
[2:21:57] really you can't say anything else it's
[2:21:59] it's it's done
[2:22:01] it's proven
[2:22:02] but uh but i made this statement i say
[2:22:04] you know especially for those that are
[2:22:06] walking away
[2:22:08] the bible says that behold i send you
[2:22:10] elijah
[2:22:12] before the great and terrible day of the
[2:22:13] lord and he shall turn the hearts to the
[2:22:15] fathers to the children hearts of the
[2:22:16] children to their fathers that say if
[2:22:18] brother branham is not that elijah what
[2:22:21] you need to do for me
[2:22:22] is show me who is
[2:22:26] that elijah
[2:22:29] that's all i need if you want to change
[2:22:30] my mind show me elijah
[2:22:37] so another thing i want to you know
[2:22:39] point out you know this is this gonna
[2:22:40] help somebody
[2:22:42] right jesus
[2:22:44] said
[2:22:46] that elijah was gonna come and restore
[2:22:48] all things
[2:22:50] and it says i say unto you elijah's
[2:22:52] already come and they did unto him as it
[2:22:54] was listed and it says the bible the
[2:22:57] bible says they understood that he spoke
[2:22:59] to them of john the baptist
[2:23:01] however in that statement two different
[2:23:04] verses uh jesus was speaking of two
[2:23:06] different comings of elijah so one was
[2:23:09] representing john the baptist and a lot
[2:23:11] and the disciples understood but who is
[2:23:13] this elijah that's supposed to come and
[2:23:15] restore all things
[2:23:18] somebody says well that was john the
[2:23:20] baptist
[2:23:21] good answer
[2:23:24] now tell me one more thing
[2:23:28] what
[2:23:28] [Music]
[2:23:29] did john restore
[2:23:36] find it in the scripture
[2:23:38] what did he restore
[2:23:41] if you don't have an answer for that
[2:23:42] then you got the wrong answer to the
[2:23:44] question
[2:23:46] church
[2:23:47] we got a message that has been proven
[2:23:50] we got a message that has prepared us
[2:23:53] that's why we're not shaken by anything
[2:23:56] that happens
[2:23:58] whatever comes whatever goes we remain
[2:24:00] confident in our god
