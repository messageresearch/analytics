[6:30] [Music]
[6:33] It says,
[6:34] "Now from the sixth hour there was
[6:37] darkness all over the land until the
[6:39] 9inth hour. And about the 9inth hour,
[6:42] Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
[6:43] Eli, Eli, Lama Bethani." That is to say,
[6:47] "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
[6:49] me?" Some of them that stood stood there
[6:53] when they heard that said, "This man
[6:56] calleth for Elias." And straightway one
[6:58] of them ran and took a sponge and filled
[7:00] it with vinegar and put it on a reed and
[7:02] gave him to drink. The rest said, "Let
[7:05] be, let us see whether Elias will come
[7:07] to save him." Jesus, when he had cried
[7:10] again with a loud voice, yielded up the
[7:12] ghost. And behold, the veil of the
[7:14] temple was rent and twain from top to
[7:16] the bottom. And the earth did quake, and
[7:19] the rocks rent, and the graves were
[7:21] open. And many bodies of the saints
[7:23] which slept arose and came out of the
[7:26] graves after his resurrection and went
[7:29] into the holy city and appeared unto
[7:31] many. Amen. One day the dead in Christ
[7:34] will rise.
[7:36] We're looking for that
[7:38] time.
[7:39] Amen. We will be caught up together with
[7:42] them to meet the Lord in the air. Amen.
[7:44] God bless you
[7:48] Stephen. Let us all bow.
[7:51] Dear heavenly father, Lord, we just
[7:53] thank you for this time, Lord God, to
[7:55] come together again, Lord God, to praise

[8:17] you paid for us, Lord God. Lord, we just

[8:22] forth, Lord, that you get all the
[8:23] praise, worship, and glory from
[8:25] everything that we do, Lord God. Lord,
[8:27] as the word comes forth today, Lord God,
[8:29] Lord, let it continue to change hearts,
[8:31] change minds, Lord God, to renew our
[8:33] spirits, Lord God. And Lord, we ask,
[8:35] Lord God, as the songs go forth, Lord
[8:36] God, that it creates an atmosphere
[8:38] that's pleasing unto you, Lord God, that
[8:40] you may come down and be with us this
[8:42] morning, Lord. Lord, we ask these things
[8:44] in Jesus mighty name. Amen. And amen.

[33:25] keep brother Mark in prayer. Amen. You
[33:27] know, I I was thinking this morning, you
[33:30] know, we haven't heard from our pastor
[33:33] in a
[33:35] while, but for him to open the pull pit,
[33:38] he could be very
[33:40] selfish, but he uses every one of these
[33:43] brothers, six more brothers to preach
[33:45] the
[33:46] gospel. He allows a lot of other
[33:48] brothers to come and preach.
[33:52] And he could be very
[33:54] selfish, but to have a self selfless
[33:57] heart like that, it just it blows my
[33:59] mind sometime to think
[34:02] about, you know, how the Holy Ghost just
[34:05] moves on. He'll have the right brother
[34:09] at the right time to bring us exactly
[34:12] what we need.
[34:14] And I'm grateful for our pastor. I I
[34:17] [Applause]
[34:24] The Lord must really love us to give us
[34:26] a pastor like him.
[34:29] Amen. So, we want to pray for our pastor
[34:31] this morning and all of our ministering
[34:34] brothers. Keep each one in prayer. Smite
[34:37] the shepherd and the sheep will be
[34:38] scattered. They have a big target on
[34:40] their backs, on their chest, wherever.
[34:42] Satan wants to hit each one of them. And
[34:45] normally, he'll use the family. Yes. So
[34:47] pray for our brothers. Amen. May I have
[34:50] the announcements? Praise the Lord. On
[34:52] Friday be brother Cable's birthday.
[34:55] [Applause]
[34:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[53:53] Uh John uh
[53:56] 14 is where I want to go. I also want to
[53:59] say thank the Lord for brother Jerry on
[54:03] Friday night. Hallelujah. Uh we had a
[54:07] good Friday service and
[54:11] brother was laying it down in here and
[54:13] you know I know we kind of went over
[54:15] time but the one thing that that I was
[54:18] back there in my heart rejoicing over
[54:20] him. Um brother Jerry has always been
[54:23] one. He kind of come and he be gone. But
[54:26] on Sunday, he had a I mean on Friday he
[54:29] had a a he had a a a
[54:33] boatload. And I say, "Praise God."
[54:38] But the way he was working with Basheba,
[54:40] I say, "What
[54:45] brother, my notebook is
[54:47] full?" But that was just wonderful.
[54:50] Wonderful. We We really appreciate Amen.
[54:53] him getting himself out of the way.
[54:55] Amen. Um this morning um uh we will read
[55:00] from John 14:9. And I will just uh warn
[55:03] you.
[55:04] Um I know uh many are here for Easter.
[55:08] We we we certainly going to talk a
[55:10] little bit about uh our Lord and Savior
[55:13] and what he did. Uh but you know there
[55:16] was a a greater work in Easter uh that I
[55:20] hope we can see today. Amen. And then
[55:24] and and p what that what that greater
[55:26] work was is that you would have a
[55:29] personal Easter.
[55:34] It's not just about him and what
[55:36] happened 2,000 years ago, but he's
[55:39] trying to bring you forth
[55:41] from the dead.
[55:43] Amen. All right. So, let us read this uh
[55:48] passage of scripture. I'll read two two
[55:50] two uh verses here. Uh John 14:9 and
[55:54] also Revelation 3:1 is what we'll read.
[55:56] I'm sorry. John 14:19
[55:59] um uh 14:19. I'm sorry. I I I wrote that
[56:03] wrong. Uh should be John
[56:07] 14:19. Um and the Bible says,
[56:12] "Yet a little while and the world seeth
[56:17] me no
[56:19] more, but ye see me." This is personal.
[56:23] Ye see me. Uh because I
[56:27] live, ye shall live also. And and and
[56:32] brother Brandham tells us that this
[56:34] particular word, amen, is to his church,
[56:38] to the disciples, or let me also say to
[56:41] the bride. Amen. Because I live, ye
[56:44] shall live also. Also over here in
[56:48] Revelation uh 3 and 1 uh we'll just read
[56:54] one verse
[56:55] here and
[56:58] um by the help of the Holy Spirit be
[57:01] able to tie all this together.
[57:03] It says, "And unto the angel of the
[57:07] church in Sardis,
[57:09] write these things saith he that hath
[57:12] the seven spirits of God and the seven
[57:16] stars. I know thy works, that thou hast
[57:19] a name, that thou livest. You have a
[57:23] name that you live." But the scripture
[57:27] declares and Jesus himself is written
[57:29] and read. It says that thou livest and
[57:32] art
[57:33] dead. Amen. Praise God. So let's pray
[57:37] over the word.
[57:39] Father, we are grateful for the ability
[57:43] to
[57:44] assemble and uh how blessed we are uh to
[57:48] be here in the sanctuary today. Thank
[57:51] you for every uh uh son and daughter of
[57:55] God that is coming to the house of God.
[57:58] Um as I looked around and saw different
[58:02] people thinking about uh basketball
[58:05] practice on Easter Sunday, I I'm very
[58:08] appreciative of people that think about
[58:09] the Lord Jesus on Easter Sunday. And uh
[58:13] just ask God that you bless our
[58:15] gathering. Help us to hear what you
[58:18] would have us to hear. Uh we also ask
[58:20] that you bless those that will be
[58:22] joining this stream and hearing the word
[58:24] of God. May they be quickened uh by the
[58:27] word and may it come alive in each and
[58:29] every one of our hearts. We give you the
[58:31] glory, the honor and the praise in
[58:34] Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. You can
[58:37] be seated. Uh let me also mention that I
[58:41] do really appreciate uh the specials
[58:44] that went forth. We uh thank God for our
[58:48] Sunday school class. I believe Sister
[58:50] Shondaanda uh got them together and and
[58:53] got that song together. So, we really
[58:55] appreciate them. That was a blessing.
[58:57] Amen. To hear them. Praise the Lord.
[59:01] Amen. We need to get y'all singing some
[59:03] more songs. Amen. But we we thank God
[59:06] for them. And uh also I heard Sister
[59:09] Abby, I believe she wrote a song and um
[59:12] you you didn't write it. Okay. I'm glad
[59:14] you're not taking credit for it. Amen.
[59:17] But it's still a good song. We really
[59:18] enjoyed that, uh, Sister Sister Abby.
[59:21] And and that's the the beauty of music.
[59:25] Amen. It is a universal
[59:28] language. Amen. And I believe Sister
[59:31] Rachel tapped into the universal
[59:33] language and just picked it up and
[59:35] played it. So, we thank God for for
[59:37] that. And Sister Bernice, we always
[59:40] thank God for uh for her. and you know
[59:43] and just um I think there were a couple
[59:46] songs one from sister Bernice and then
[59:48] also um brother Solomon was in a medley
[59:53] um earlier and I I I should have wrote
[59:56] the words down uh but um there was a
[1:00:00] song
[1:00:02] um it was talking about something about
[1:00:05] us um
[1:00:08] resurrecting me. He's resurrecting me.
[1:00:11] There it is. Thank you very much. And uh
[1:00:14] so those two songs were right in line
[1:00:17] with the thought that I had for this
[1:00:19] morning. Uh our title is Resurrection
[1:00:22] for the
[1:00:23] Bride. Amen. Resurrection for the bride.
[1:00:29] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:00:32] So, uh being that it's Easter, I'm going
[1:00:34] to take just a little extra time, amen,
[1:00:37] today than I normally do. uh but I want
[1:00:40] to make sure that we get this thought
[1:00:41] across uh to you. Uh I was looking at a
[1:00:45] few things and one um particular
[1:00:49] statement that uh God's prophet made it
[1:00:52] he talked about three being the number
[1:00:56] of life. Amen. Three the number three is
[1:01:00] the number of life. And uh he uses
[1:01:05] Genesis 1
[1:01:07] 11-13 in order to uh um justify that
[1:01:12] statement that three is a number of
[1:01:14] life. And here in Genesis 1 verse 11
[1:01:17] through13 it says and God said let the
[1:01:19] earth bring forth grass
[1:01:23] uh the the herb yielding seed and the
[1:01:25] fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind
[1:01:28] whose seed is in itself upon the earth.
[1:01:31] And it was so. And the earth brought
[1:01:34] forth grass and herb yielding seed after
[1:01:37] his kind, and the tree yielding fruit
[1:01:39] whose seed was in itself after his kind.
[1:01:41] And God saw that it was good. And notice
[1:01:44] this, and the evening and the morning
[1:01:47] were the third day. Amen. So when we go
[1:01:51] back and look at a creation uh story
[1:01:54] there on the third day, there was life
[1:01:56] coming forth. And uh and if if we can
[1:01:59] just kind of uh uh uh uh just think
[1:02:02] about this at a greater uh level. It
[1:02:05] wasn't God was speaking something
[1:02:08] significant. Amen. On that third day in
[1:02:11] Genesis because later on on the third
[1:02:14] day, Jesus would come forth.
[1:02:19] Hallelujah. Jesus rose on that third
[1:02:22] day. And we're grateful. That's why
[1:02:24] we're gathered here this morning. Uh so
[1:02:26] so as we look at this, amen. Um as I as
[1:02:31] I as I told you, it's not going to be
[1:02:33] traditional because the traditional
[1:02:35] stories that talk about what Christ,
[1:02:36] Amen, did on that third day. And and and
[1:02:39] that that story could never get old. And
[1:02:42] I never I never get tired of telling it
[1:02:44] to people. Amen. Because that's what
[1:02:46] makes me a Christian. Amen. and and and
[1:02:49] as I as I've always stated, uh had Jesus
[1:02:52] not done what he did, then Christianity
[1:02:55] would be just like any other religion.
[1:02:57] But because Jesus rose and and and and
[1:03:01] he told people, it says, "Now now you
[1:03:03] you you destroy this temple, but in 3
[1:03:06] days I'm going to raise it up again."
[1:03:10] And then he also tell people say, "You
[1:03:12] can't take my life. I got power to lay
[1:03:15] it down." That's right. Not only that, I
[1:03:19] mean a man speaking these words. I ain't
[1:03:21] got power just to lay it down. I got
[1:03:24] power to pick it up again.
[1:03:28] And when Jesus rose on the third day, he
[1:03:31] proved all those things that he said.
[1:03:33] That's what separates Christianity from
[1:03:36] any other faith. It's because of what
[1:03:39] Jesus did. Hallelujah. Amen. How do we
[1:03:42] know he's alive? Because he lives inside
[1:03:44] of us. Not only does he live in us, but
[1:03:46] the same things he did back then while
[1:03:48] he was on earth, he is still doing
[1:03:50] today, proving that he is the same
[1:03:52] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:03:55] Hallelujah. So, you know, uh that that
[1:03:57] certainly we we will talk a little bit
[1:03:59] about that, but the my my my focus and
[1:04:02] my attention is on you today. Amen. The
[1:04:05] resurrection. Amen. For the bride. Now,
[1:04:08] I want to just uh read a a a very small
[1:04:11] part of this quote. Uh I'm going to get
[1:04:14] to the whole quote later on, but this is
[1:04:15] coming out of restoration of the bride
[1:04:17] tree and and and and I put uh there um
[1:04:21] uh I believe resurrection for the bride.
[1:04:23] If you just pull up that one sentence,
[1:04:25] that's really all I want to read uh in
[1:04:27] this quote. And uh and then you'll see
[1:04:29] where where we're getting this thought
[1:04:31] from. So he says um after he says, "All
[1:04:35] uh all that I promise the same Holy
[1:04:38] Spirit will bring bear the same signs.
[1:04:42] I'll having an Easter. This is God. All
[1:04:45] right. I'll have an Easter, a
[1:04:47] resurrection for the bride, the same as
[1:04:50] I had for the
[1:04:51] bridegroom. The Lord himself said, I'm
[1:04:54] going to have an Easter, a resurrection
[1:04:56] for the bride the same as I had for the
[1:04:59] bridegroom. Now, now you can take that
[1:05:01] down. And I want us to just really try
[1:05:03] to try to uh unpack this today if I can.
[1:05:06] you know, the when a a prophet comes on
[1:05:09] the scene and he makes comments like
[1:05:11] this, amen, in in sermons and and um you
[1:05:15] know, he just kind of takes us to a
[1:05:17] furtherance of the story of Easter. And
[1:05:20] uh and and here he's saying we're going
[1:05:21] to have a resurrection for the bride the
[1:05:23] same as we had a resurrection for the
[1:05:25] bridegroom. So, so today my attention is
[1:05:28] to focus on the bride. Now, I have four
[1:05:30] questions that I want to try to answer.
[1:05:32] The first is who is the bride?
[1:05:35] Right? Who is the bride? You know,
[1:05:38] everybody claim they bride, but who
[1:05:39] really is the bride? Amen. The second
[1:05:42] question I want to try to answer is what
[1:05:44] are her characteristics?
[1:05:46] Amen. The the the third question is
[1:05:48] where did they bury her?
[1:05:52] Right? Where did they bury this bride?
[1:05:54] If if he say he going to have a
[1:05:55] resurrection for the bride, where did
[1:05:59] they bury her?
[1:06:03] All right. Amen. And uh and the other
[1:06:05] thing that we want to we want to if he
[1:06:07] says that there's going to be a
[1:06:09] resurrection for the bride the same as
[1:06:10] the bridegroom, we want to know how does
[1:06:13] she receive a resurrection?
[1:06:16] Praise the Lord. Is that okay? Let me
[1:06:18] give you the four questions again. Who
[1:06:20] is the bride? What are her
[1:06:23] characteristics? Where did they bury
[1:06:25] her? And how does she receive a
[1:06:28] resurrection? All right, let's go on.
[1:06:31] And I want to read from the message
[1:06:33] indictment as we uh take our journey
[1:06:36] this morning. Uh here you know brother
[1:06:39] Brandon makes a statement again. Now
[1:06:40] watch these these prophetic statements
[1:06:43] if I can just put it that way. They
[1:06:44] prophetic. He says compare. Look at this
[1:06:48] now. He says compare the two Calvaries.
[1:06:54] What?
[1:06:56] Wait a minute. We we aware of one
[1:06:58] Calvary. But a prophet goes to the
[1:07:01] pulpit and he makes a statement. God
[1:07:03] bless you, brother Jeffrey. I forgot to
[1:07:05] mention you. Good to see you, brother.
[1:07:07] Uh but he says, "Compare the two
[1:07:09] Calvaries." Now, watch this. Let's go on
[1:07:12] a little further. He says, "And um and
[1:07:14] their accusation, remember, because he
[1:07:17] had made himself God, we will not have
[1:07:21] this man rule over us." Amen. What was
[1:07:24] the accusation that they could find in
[1:07:27] the in the council that morning when
[1:07:29] they crucified Jesus that he made
[1:07:31] himself God? He was God and he broke the
[1:07:34] Sabbath and he was the Lord of the
[1:07:35] Sabbath. They condemned him because that
[1:07:37] he made himself God. You have no right
[1:07:40] to do this. You have no right. Our high
[1:07:43] priest if anything is coming. Amen. Come
[1:07:46] through our h through our priests. Now
[1:07:48] compare that with Calvary today.
[1:07:52] So when he's talking about two
[1:07:53] Calvaries, he's talking about the
[1:07:54] Calvary that happened some 2,000 years
[1:07:56] ago. But he also said there was another
[1:07:58] Calvary that happened today.
[1:08:01] Oh, glory to God. Amen. He says when God
[1:08:06] so pleased the father, the spirit to
[1:08:09] raise up his own son, overshadowed the
[1:08:11] uh the Mary by the Holy Spirit and
[1:08:13] brought forth a body that could serve
[1:08:15] him and serve his purpose. Amen. Uhhuh.
[1:08:18] To he the God was in Christ the fullness
[1:08:21] of the Godhead bodily in him reflecting
[1:08:23] what God was to the people letting the
[1:08:26] whole world know what God wanted each
[1:08:29] individual to be a son and daughter. He
[1:08:32] took one man and did it. And because
[1:08:34] that he didn't join with their
[1:08:37] organizational ranks they condemned him
[1:08:40] and crucified him.
[1:08:43] That was the first Calvary. But let's go
[1:08:45] on. He says, "Now compare that Calvary,
[1:08:48] Amen, with today." He says, "Because of
[1:08:52] organizational prejudice," Amen. Because
[1:08:55] of indifference between scholars who
[1:08:57] ought to know God's word and plan,
[1:09:00] because of this, God can take a little
[1:09:04] group of people that he can work through
[1:09:07] somewhere and reflect itself who will
[1:09:10] humble themselves to the word and they
[1:09:12] cannot say it isn't so. Oh my. I love
[1:09:16] this. I love this. He goes on. He says,
[1:09:18] "They could not say he didn't do it, for
[1:09:20] their congregation was witness of it. It
[1:09:22] was before them. They couldn't deny it.
[1:09:24] They couldn't deny his claims because
[1:09:26] the very word that they said they
[1:09:29] believe was the one who had who who had
[1:09:31] proved that he was because God took the
[1:09:34] word that was supposed to be the Messiah
[1:09:36] and show it through a man and they had
[1:09:38] to get rid of him. It's the only Amen.
[1:09:41] And the only way they could go on was
[1:09:44] get rid of the Messiah. And they did it
[1:09:46] through blindness and ignorance.
[1:09:50] That's how they got rid of the Messiah.
[1:09:52] Through blindness and through ignorance.
[1:09:54] Regardless of their education, they were
[1:09:56] smart, intelligent, worldly speaking. He
[1:09:59] says, as we compare the other night,
[1:10:01] when the light struck the rich young
[1:10:02] ruler, look what he did. He rejected a
[1:10:05] smart man. Paul, another smart man, the
[1:10:08] light struck him. What did he do? He
[1:10:10] accepted it. Yeah. Yeah. Now, now, now,
[1:10:12] now, now, now, Brother Brandham is
[1:10:13] bringing us this little thought of two
[1:10:15] Calvaries and and what he's saying is
[1:10:17] that the same way that these the
[1:10:19] theologians or the I would say the the
[1:10:21] Sadducees and Pharisees of that day,
[1:10:24] they rejected the word as it came
[1:10:26] through Christ. Hallelujah. And the same
[1:10:30] thing happened today. When the word came
[1:10:32] through a prophet, people rejected the
[1:10:34] word, not realizing they put Christ on
[1:10:37] the cross again. Yes, sir. Amen. Amen.
[1:10:40] Amen.
[1:10:42] All right. All right. All right. All
[1:10:43] right. But not everybody put him on the
[1:10:46] cross. And that's why it says going to
[1:10:48] be a little a little group that can
[1:10:50] receive the word. And and and and and
[1:10:52] just through that little statement
[1:10:53] there, we already know who the bride is.
[1:10:55] She going to be a part of that little
[1:10:56] group that can receive the word.
[1:11:00] All right. All right. All right. Let me
[1:11:02] just make mention of this. resurrection
[1:11:04] of Christ generated many other
[1:11:07] resurrections. And um the Bible said in
[1:11:10] in in Matthew 27:52, don't have to worry
[1:11:13] about pulling up. He says many of the
[1:11:14] saints arose. The Bible said that at the
[1:11:17] time that Jesus rose again, many of the
[1:11:18] other saints arose. Uh also we we notice
[1:11:21] that uh Peter after uh the crucifixion,
[1:11:25] Peter himself was very discouraged.
[1:11:28] Amen. And and um and I mean Peter was on
[1:11:31] his way back to his old uh uh job. He
[1:11:34] wanted to go back and be a fisherman.
[1:11:36] But the Lord Jesus had to meet Peter.
[1:11:38] Amen. On the boat. And uh and when he
[1:11:40] met them met him on the shore there when
[1:11:42] he come and Peter like, "Oh Lord, I'm
[1:11:44] I'm out here. I'm not even dressed
[1:11:46] properly.
[1:11:49] I'm not even dressed properly." He
[1:11:51] grabbed a net and just wrapped himself
[1:11:52] in a net. I mean, this is the man that
[1:11:55] was I mean I mean he slept with Jesus.
[1:11:57] of saw all kind of miracles, walked on
[1:11:59] water, did all kind of things, but now
[1:12:01] he's so discouraged now. He not dressed
[1:12:03] properly. Hello, church. Right. But but
[1:12:06] but but but when the Lord comes to him,
[1:12:08] it says uh you know, he's breaking bread
[1:12:10] there with him and and cooking the fish.
[1:12:12] Already had it already cooked on the
[1:12:14] shore. And it says uh it says, "Now,
[1:12:16] Peter, feed my sheep. Do you love me,
[1:12:17] Peter? Do you love me?" Say, "Now, Lord,
[1:12:19] you know I love you." Well, why he why
[1:12:21] did he have to ask Peter that if he knew
[1:12:23] that he loved him? Well, Peter was
[1:12:24] discouraged. Now, I think on the inside
[1:12:26] he might have loved him, but but but
[1:12:28] with what he was going through, Amen. he
[1:12:30] wasn't really reflecting and showing
[1:12:32] that love. Let me just talk to you just
[1:12:34] for a moment. Sometimes people love God,
[1:12:36] but because of their trials, they're not
[1:12:38] reflecting and showing the love that
[1:12:39] they should show to God. Don't let your
[1:12:42] trials dry out your love.
[1:12:46] Amen. I I I like it the way Paul say,
[1:12:48] I'm fully persuaded that nothing present
[1:12:52] nor things to come. Hallelujah. Paul say
[1:12:55] not now I'm not not any other creature.
[1:12:57] He say nothing going to separate me from
[1:13:00] the love of God which is in Christ Jesus
[1:13:03] my Lord. You got to have a testimony
[1:13:06] like Paul. Every believer needs a
[1:13:09] testimony like that. I don't care what
[1:13:11] nobody do. You ain't going to take me
[1:13:13] from my God.
[1:13:16] Hallelujah. Come on somebody. Amen. But
[1:13:19] but but here Peter has this encounter
[1:13:21] with the Lord Jesus. And uh he says now
[1:13:24] Peter do you love me? Say yeah yeah.
[1:13:25] Okay you say you love me will feed my
[1:13:28] feed my feed my sheep. Then he said then
[1:13:31] he come back around and later on that
[1:13:33] conversation said Peter do you love me?
[1:13:35] Oh
[1:13:36] my Lord I just told you I love you. You
[1:13:39] you are you discerning something and not
[1:13:40] telling me? Said no. Well he say you
[1:13:43] love me uh Peter feed my lambs.
[1:13:48] This is the the the young ones. We got
[1:13:50] to feed them both the sheep and the
[1:13:51] lambs. And then he said, then he come
[1:13:53] back a third time, Peter, do you love me
[1:13:57] now? Father, now you know I love you. He
[1:13:59] said, if you love me, feed my sheep.
[1:14:03] Notice three times he had to do this
[1:14:05] because three is the number of life.
[1:14:09] Glory to God. These three times that he
[1:14:12] a and Peter right there. Amen. During
[1:14:15] this this this time period, especially
[1:14:18] when Jesus rose, there was another thing
[1:14:19] that happened to Peter. Um he told his
[1:14:22] when when he rose he gave word he said
[1:14:24] go tell my disciples
[1:14:27] and
[1:14:29] Peter that I meet him in Galilee and he
[1:14:32] had to call Peter's name
[1:14:34] specifically because he knew where Peter
[1:14:36] was in his spirit.
[1:14:39] God will call your name specifically
[1:14:42] when he knows where you are in your
[1:14:44] spirit.
[1:14:46] Go tell my disciples and Peter. Yes sir.
[1:14:50] Now, I'm going to tell you something.
[1:14:51] Peter might have tried to exclude
[1:14:54] himself as a disciple, but when Jesus
[1:14:57] makes a choice, amen, there is nothing
[1:15:01] nobody could do, you can't even do
[1:15:04] enough yourself to stop God's choice
[1:15:07] from being manifested in your life. He
[1:15:11] knew Peter would be the spokesman on the
[1:15:14] day of Pentecost. So, go tell my
[1:15:17] disciples and
[1:15:20] Peter. Yes, sir. Thank God for Peter
[1:15:23] receiving a resurrection in his spirit.
[1:15:28] Amen. The brothers on the road to Emmas,
[1:15:30] they also received a resurrection in
[1:15:33] their spirits. And I want to just tell
[1:15:35] you that you experienced a revel a
[1:15:38] resurrection when you're baptized in the
[1:15:40] name of the Lord Jesus. Let us pick up a
[1:15:42] quick scripture here out of Romans 6.
[1:15:44] Brother Jerry had hit this on uh Friday
[1:15:47] night and I say I'll just kind of pick
[1:15:49] up there and just read it. But I want to
[1:15:52] let you know that you yourself you
[1:15:53] experience a resurrection when you are
[1:15:56] baptized. Romans 6:1
[1:15:58] um and let me didn't put that in my
[1:16:01] notes here. So let me just grab it
[1:16:02] really quick. Uh Romans
[1:16:05] 6:1 says, "What shall we say then? Shall
[1:16:09] we continue in sin that grace may
[1:16:12] abound?
[1:16:14] Uh, God forbid, how shall we that are
[1:16:16] dead to sin live any longer
[1:16:19] therein? He says, uh, know ye not that
[1:16:23] so many of us were baptized into Jesus
[1:16:26] Christ, were baptized into his death?
[1:16:29] We're identified in his death. says,
[1:16:32] "Therefore, we are buried with him by
[1:16:34] baptism into death, that like as Christ
[1:16:37] was raised up from the dead by the glory
[1:16:40] of the father, even so we also should
[1:16:42] walk in the newness of life." It says,
[1:16:45] "For if we have been planted together in
[1:16:48] the likeness of his death, we shall also
[1:16:52] in the likeness of uh we shall uh uh it
[1:16:55] says, let me say, for if we have been
[1:16:56] planted together in the likeness of his
[1:16:58] death, we shall be also in the likeness
[1:17:01] of his resurrection." Now, I like these
[1:17:04] words because, you know, again, brother
[1:17:06] Brandham, you know, made the statement
[1:17:07] that uh uh uh uh I'll have an Easter
[1:17:12] resurrection for the bride. the same as
[1:17:14] I had for the bridegroom. I'm I'm God.
[1:17:17] I'm saying I'm gonna have myself an
[1:17:19] Easter. And you know, I'm reminded of a
[1:17:21] of I'm gonna keep reading there in a
[1:17:23] little bit, but I'm reminded of a a
[1:17:25] statement that the prophet used to make
[1:17:27] all the time. And he says, uh, in order
[1:17:31] to be a Christian, you have to be
[1:17:33] identified with those Bible characters.
[1:17:37] Hallelujah. Right. He he say he say I I
[1:17:40] was I I I'm identified with Abraham when
[1:17:43] he went up to offer Isaac. You know he's
[1:17:46] and he makes statements like this. I was
[1:17:48] there.
[1:17:51] Huh? You know I I was there when the
[1:17:53] Hebrew boys were being thrown into the
[1:17:55] fiery furnace. I I I remember it so so
[1:17:59] vividly. I was there. My God. When
[1:18:02] Daniel had to be thrown into the lion's
[1:18:04] den, I'm identified with these Bible
[1:18:06] characters. said, "I was there." And I
[1:18:09] believe, you know, we can just go a
[1:18:10] little further. Brother Jerry picked up
[1:18:12] Basheba. Amen. And and he brought out
[1:18:15] how she was a you lamb. A lamb is a is
[1:18:19] an animal that sacrifices itself. Had
[1:18:22] she turned down the king, she would have
[1:18:24] had a death sentence. It wasn't her out
[1:18:26] there trying to present herself. Amen.
[1:18:28] In some ungodly way. She was just doing
[1:18:30] what she needed to do as a woman. and
[1:18:33] and and so that the prophet when he
[1:18:35] describes her he says you are a are you
[1:18:37] lamb
[1:18:39] my God and and I believe the way that
[1:18:41] Amen brother Jerry was able to kind of
[1:18:43] go and bring all those things to us is
[1:18:45] because somehow he was there he can see
[1:18:48] it in scripture he can see how this
[1:18:50] thing was lined up glory to God
[1:18:53] sometimes God will quicken your spirit
[1:18:56] and he'll take you back to places
[1:18:59] hallelujah if you can just get around
[1:19:01] familiar places your spiritual
[1:19:05] amnesia will be broken.
[1:19:07] [Applause]
[1:19:09] I got to go a little further. But to be
[1:19:11] a Christian, my I'm identified with
[1:19:13] Moses when they crossed the Red Sea. I'm
[1:19:17] identified with all these different
[1:19:18] things that happened in the Old
[1:19:19] Testament. But I was also identified
[1:19:22] with Christ when they took him to
[1:19:24] Calvar's cross. Amen. And they put him
[1:19:27] in a grave for for three days and he
[1:19:29] rose again. He says, "I was there." Yes.
[1:19:33] Amen. Hallelujah. That's why we know
[1:19:35] this resurrection is real because we
[1:19:36] part of it. We were there. We saw it for
[1:19:39] our own selves. Blessed be the name of
[1:19:42] the Lord. He says this. He says in in in
[1:19:44] in Romans
[1:19:46] 6, for if ye have been planted together
[1:19:49] in the likeness of his death, we shall
[1:19:53] also in the likeness of his we we we
[1:19:56] shall be also in the likeness of his
[1:19:58] resurrection. We shall be also in the
[1:20:02] likeness of his resurrection. Knowing
[1:20:04] this that our old man,
[1:20:09] our
[1:20:10] old
[1:20:12] man, brother, if there's anybody got to
[1:20:14] go to a cross, it's your old man.
[1:20:21] Oh, you got to have a crucifixion.
[1:20:25] You got to die to yourself. You got to
[1:20:28] die to your ideas, your thoughts, and
[1:20:30] and all that. You got to die to it.
[1:20:34] Amen. Here, here, here, Paul tells us,
[1:20:36] he says, um, uh, knowing this, that our
[1:20:39] old man is crucified with him. That's
[1:20:43] that sinful nature has got to be
[1:20:44] crucified with him. Amen. That the body
[1:20:47] of sin might be
[1:20:50] destroyed. That henceforth we should not
[1:20:53] serve sin. Don't serve sin. and serve
[1:20:57] God, not sin. Amen. Amen. For he that is
[1:21:01] dead is freed from sin. Amen. Now, if we
[1:21:06] be dead with Christ, we believe that we
[1:21:09] shall also live with him, knowing that
[1:21:12] Christ being raised from the dead dieth
[1:21:15] no more. And he says, "Death hath no
[1:21:18] more dominion over him." Right? For in
[1:21:22] that he died, he died unto sin once, but
[1:21:26] in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
[1:21:29] And it says, "Likewise, reckon ye also
[1:21:33] yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin,
[1:21:38] but alive unto God through Jesus Christ
[1:21:41] our Lord." And I love these these last
[1:21:43] couple verses. Let not sin therefore
[1:21:48] reign in your mortal body.
[1:21:52] Now notice what he say. Let not sin.
[1:21:54] That mean you going to have to deny
[1:21:56] yourself
[1:21:58] sisters. When when the devil testing you
[1:22:01] and trying you and want you to put on
[1:22:03] that makeup, you're going to have to
[1:22:04] deny yourself.
[1:22:07] I'm not going to live according to sin.
[1:22:10] I'm going to live according to God's
[1:22:12] word. Amen.
[1:22:14] Praise God. Amen.
[1:22:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Some of y'all
[1:22:19] going to have to say and and and and let
[1:22:21] me just put this. You have to say no to
[1:22:23] relationships.
[1:22:26] Truth, brother. Glory to God. Amen. Some
[1:22:28] relationships are not of God and they're
[1:22:31] not for you. God ain't got no blessing
[1:22:34] in that relationship for you. You got to
[1:22:36] say no. You got to raise up and get an
[1:22:38] uncction from the inside and say no to
[1:22:41] sin.
[1:22:43] Let not sin. Uhhuh. Amen. Uh therefore
[1:22:49] reign in your mortal body that ye should
[1:22:51] obey it in the lust thereof. Neither
[1:22:54] yield ye your members as instruments of
[1:22:57] unrighteousness unto sin, but yield
[1:23:00] yourselves unto God, as those that are
[1:23:02] alive from the dead, and your members as
[1:23:05] instruments of righteousness unto God.
[1:23:10] Here we see, Amen. Uh Paul just giving
[1:23:13] us some instruction here. We we we we
[1:23:16] we're buried uh in baptism. We're buried
[1:23:19] just like Christ was was buried in the
[1:23:21] grave for uh uh for three days. Amen.
[1:23:24] And he rose again to newness of life.
[1:23:26] When you go into baptism, when you go in
[1:23:28] that water, it's like your old nature is
[1:23:30] being buried. It goes down for about 3
[1:23:33] seconds. But when you come back, you're
[1:23:35] walking in the newness of life. Now,
[1:23:37] now, now here's the thing. Many of us
[1:23:39] have been baptized, but somehow we've
[1:23:40] picked up some of those old habits that
[1:23:42] we died to a long time ago. But let not
[1:23:46] sin, amen, reign in your mortal body.
[1:23:49] Amen. Let's go on a little further.
[1:23:51] You're going to have to have a death, a
[1:23:54] burial, and a resurrection.
[1:23:58] Glory to God. All right. All right. All
[1:24:01] right. So here, Amen. Let us um let me
[1:24:05] just kind of uh identify who is the
[1:24:08] bride. Now, we we find this language
[1:24:11] about the bride or um or the wife, amen,
[1:24:16] of of Christ. We find a lot of this
[1:24:17] language in Revelation. And and I like
[1:24:19] to I like to just kind of read this
[1:24:21] really quick. Uh Revelation 19 and 7.
[1:24:24] And and here's the thing that I I want
[1:24:26] to just kind of set this up with. You
[1:24:28] know, uh in a marriage
[1:24:30] ceremony, there's a lot of people that
[1:24:33] come. They attend if you invite them.
[1:24:35] Amen. They'll attend if you invite them.
[1:24:37] Praise God.
[1:24:39] Amen. They would come, they'll bring you
[1:24:41] gifts, they would do all kind of things.
[1:24:43] Y'all y'all laughing at me. I know
[1:24:44] y'all. But uh I'mma keep preaching. But
[1:24:48] um that there's um a lot of people that
[1:24:51] would come, they would bring gifts and
[1:24:53] and um and they come to celebrate the
[1:24:55] event and um you know there there's
[1:24:58] there's there's many that's there, but
[1:25:00] the event is not about the people that
[1:25:02] are there. Right.
[1:25:04] And uh even the groom himself, I
[1:25:06] remember one time talking to a young
[1:25:09] man, boy, he was just he just had he he
[1:25:13] just he was decked out with with all
[1:25:15] kind of jewelry. I mean, everything. He
[1:25:17] was the center of attention. And I told,
[1:25:20] man, you're getting married. You're
[1:25:22] going to have to give this day to your
[1:25:23] wife. You got to take off some of that,
[1:25:25] man, and just let her have her day cuz
[1:25:27] you just you come out, you just
[1:25:28] blinging, man. And everybody looking at
[1:25:30] you and ain't looking nothing at her.
[1:25:32] Come on, man. Give her her day. Right.
[1:25:34] Because cuz cuz the the the when when
[1:25:36] you go to a marriage ceremony, it's it's
[1:25:38] not about the groom. He come in first.
[1:25:40] Woo. That's right. He come in first and
[1:25:43] he stands there, but he's waiting. The
[1:25:44] groom himself is waiting on the entrance
[1:25:47] of the bride. All the attendants come
[1:25:50] in. The ring bearer comes in, the flower
[1:25:53] girls and all them come in. But the
[1:25:55] bride is the last thing to come in.
[1:25:57] Notice here in Revelation 19, the last
[1:26:00] book of the Bible. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:26:03] There's an introduction about the bride,
[1:26:06] the lamb's wife.
[1:26:10] So, it wasn't just Calvary just for
[1:26:12] Jesus, but there must be another Calvary
[1:26:15] for the bride. She must die to herself
[1:26:18] so she can experience a resurrection.
[1:26:22] Amen. Amen. Revelation 19:7 says, "Let
[1:26:25] us be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[1:26:29] him, for the marriage of the lamb is
[1:26:31] come, and his wife hath made herself
[1:26:35] ready." Revelation
[1:26:38] 21:9, "But the fearful and
[1:26:42] unbelieving and and the abominable and
[1:26:46] murderers and
[1:26:47] horongers, Amen. and sorcerers and
[1:26:50] idolattors, and all liars shall have
[1:26:53] their part in the lake which burnth with
[1:26:55] fire and brimstone, which is the second
[1:26:58] death. Amen. You can't be sinning and
[1:27:00] think you're going to make it to heaven.
[1:27:03] All right. You got to you got to die to
[1:27:04] yourself. You you you're going to have
[1:27:06] to take up your cross and follow Jesus
[1:27:10] to Calvary. That's right. Look at this.
[1:27:13] He says, "And there came unto me one of
[1:27:15] the seven angels which had the seven
[1:27:17] vials full of the seven last plagues and
[1:27:19] talk with me, saying, come hither, I
[1:27:21] will show thee the bride, the lamb's
[1:27:24] wife." So, we hear this language about
[1:27:26] the bride here in the book of
[1:27:27] Revelation. Uh, Revelation
[1:27:30] 22:16-19. I Jesus have sent my angel to
[1:27:34] testify unto you these things in the
[1:27:36] churches. I am the root and the
[1:27:38] offspring of David and the bright and
[1:27:40] morning star and the spirit and the
[1:27:42] bride. say, "Come." And and let him that
[1:27:44] heareth say come. And let him that is a
[1:27:47] thirst come. And who so will let him
[1:27:49] take amen uh the water of life freely. I
[1:27:52] love this statement. The spirit and the
[1:27:54] bride say come. Brother Brandham say the
[1:27:57] spirit, the bride and the prophet going
[1:27:59] to be saying the same thing.
[1:28:02] Hallelujah. Amen. When the spirit
[1:28:04] becomes one with the bride, then the
[1:28:06] spirit and the bride can say come. Yes,
[1:28:08] sir. Verse 18 says, "For I testify in
[1:28:11] every man that hearth the words of the
[1:28:13] prophecy of this book. If any man shall
[1:28:15] add unto these things, God shall add
[1:28:17] unto him the plagues that are written
[1:28:19] therein uh written in this book. And if
[1:28:21] any man shall take away from the words
[1:28:23] of this book of uh word words of the
[1:28:25] book of this prophecy, God shall take
[1:28:27] away his part out of the book of life
[1:28:29] and out of the holy city and and and
[1:28:31] from the things which are written in
[1:28:33] this book." So here we want to know who
[1:28:35] the bride is. Who the bride is? Who is
[1:28:37] this lady? the bride that the scripture
[1:28:40] is speaking of, we find an answer given
[1:28:42] to us. Amen. By the angel of the Lord,
[1:28:46] as he told the prophet, "Pick up his pen
[1:28:48] and write." He says something to us in
[1:28:51] the Perameian church age. He says this,
[1:28:53] "The angel says, notice the harmony of
[1:28:56] the father and the son." Jesus never did
[1:29:00] anything until it was first showed him
[1:29:02] by the father. John 5:19. This harmony,
[1:29:07] glory to God, is now to exist between
[1:29:10] the groom and his bride. Look at this.
[1:29:15] Now, how we know who the bride is? He
[1:29:17] shows her his words of his word of life.
[1:29:22] Amen. She receives it. My God, man. When
[1:29:25] a man got a bride, I I even even brother
[1:29:29] um uh Crosby said last week, he said,
[1:29:33] "There's things that I can do with my
[1:29:35] wife that I can't do with my daughter.
[1:29:37] There's things I can talk about with my
[1:29:39] wife that I can't talk about with my
[1:29:40] daughter." He said, "So, so when a man
[1:29:42] has a relationship with a wife, it's a
[1:29:45] different relationship with every other
[1:29:47] woman." That's right. When Christ has a
[1:29:50] relationship with a bride, it's a
[1:29:53] different relationship than with any
[1:29:55] other church.
[1:29:58] Amen. You want to make sure you part of
[1:30:01] the bride.
[1:30:03] Amen. How do you know whether you're
[1:30:05] part of the bride? Look at what the
[1:30:07] angel says. He says he shows her his
[1:30:10] word of life. She receives it. So the
[1:30:12] bride's going to receive it. She's going
[1:30:14] to receive the word. She never doubts
[1:30:16] it. Therefore, nothing can harm her, not
[1:30:19] even
[1:30:20] death. Amen. Why can't death harm her?
[1:30:22] Cuz she going to have a resurrection.
[1:30:24] Amen. For if the seed be planted, the
[1:30:26] water will raise it up again. Here is
[1:30:29] the secret of this. The word
[1:30:32] is in the bride. As it was in Mary, the
[1:30:38] bride, you want to know who the bride
[1:30:39] is? She has the mind of Christ. For she
[1:30:44] knows what what he wants done with the
[1:30:46] word. She performs the command of the
[1:30:49] word in his name. For she has thus saith
[1:30:53] the Lord. He says then the word is
[1:30:56] quickened by the spirit and it comes to
[1:30:58] pass like a seed that is planted and
[1:31:00] watered. It comes to full harvest
[1:31:02] serving his purpose. Let me go a little
[1:31:04] further. He says those in the bride, you
[1:31:07] want to know who the bride is? Those in
[1:31:08] the bride do only his will. No one can
[1:31:11] make them do otherwise.
[1:31:14] It says, "They have thus said the Lord
[1:31:16] or they keep still." They know that it
[1:31:18] has to be God and them doing the works,
[1:31:20] fulfilling his own work. He did not
[1:31:22] complete all his work while here while
[1:31:24] in his earthly ministry. So now his work
[1:31:26] is in and through. Yes, sir. The bride.
[1:31:31] She knows that for it was not yet time
[1:31:34] for him to do certain things that he
[1:31:36] must now do. But he will now fulfill
[1:31:39] through the bride the work which he left
[1:31:41] for this specific time. You see somebody
[1:31:45] acting like Jesus. Bride.
[1:31:49] Somebody following the word of God.
[1:31:51] Bride. It's very simple. That's how you
[1:31:53] recognize who the bride. She going to
[1:31:54] receive the word. She ain't going to
[1:31:55] fuss with the word. She ain't going to
[1:31:57] argue with the word. She going to say
[1:31:58] amen to the word. And she going to live
[1:32:00] it every day of her life. That's how we
[1:32:02] know who the bride is. Glory to God.
[1:32:05] What what are her
[1:32:07] characteristics? What what is the
[1:32:10] bride's
[1:32:12] characteristics? Now, I want to read
[1:32:15] something here for you. Christ is the
[1:32:16] mystery of God revealed. And and I and I
[1:32:18] want to just take time and just kind of
[1:32:20] uh break down some of these things that
[1:32:22] he says. He makes a statement about a
[1:32:25] woman and he calls her something. Now,
[1:32:29] he I I'll just tell you before I read
[1:32:30] it. He calls the
[1:32:32] bride a independent
[1:32:37] woman. Now here's the problem
[1:32:41] with our thought process today. A
[1:32:45] independent a independent woman in our
[1:32:47] mind is a woman that can take care of
[1:32:50] herself.
[1:32:52] A woman that can go around say I don't
[1:32:53] need no man.
[1:32:56] Hello somebody. I don't need no man. I
[1:32:58] can do this all by myself.
[1:33:01] Hallelujah. It's a certain attitude that
[1:33:03] come upon independent independent women
[1:33:06] today. But brother Brandham called her
[1:33:08] independent woman. Now now we got to see
[1:33:11] the the the the language that he's
[1:33:12] using. Amen. Is different from the
[1:33:14] language that most people are using.
[1:33:16] Right. Oh my my my my. When he calls the
[1:33:19] bride an independent woman, what he's
[1:33:20] saying is that she don't need to be
[1:33:22] connected to denomination.
[1:33:24] That's right. Oh, she can stand on her
[1:33:27] own two feet. Yes. Oh, I I've had many
[1:33:29] people tell us say, you know, you ought
[1:33:31] to be connected to a bigger group. Maybe
[1:33:33] y'all will be able to get this and y'all
[1:33:34] can get that if you're connected to a
[1:33:35] bigger group. No. If God can't give it
[1:33:37] to us, we just can't get it. But we
[1:33:39] ain't going to be connected to nothing
[1:33:41] but the word.
[1:33:43] And we'll wait for God to manifest
[1:33:45] himself on our behalf. Amen. The the
[1:33:49] bride is a independent woman.
[1:33:52] Hallelujah.
[1:33:54] Hallelujah. These are some of her
[1:33:57] characteristics. Let's let's read it
[1:33:59] here. Out of Christ is the mystery of
[1:34:00] God revealed. It says he proves his
[1:34:03] resurrection life. Then as he vindicates
[1:34:06] himself, she the bride is independent
[1:34:09] from all others. She's an independent
[1:34:12] woman, a great speckled bird that's
[1:34:15] different from all others. You remember
[1:34:16] the Bible said the great speckled bird,
[1:34:19] but she had his name, she had his life.
[1:34:22] How did they speckle the bird? They were
[1:34:24] both white and then they pulled the head
[1:34:27] off of one bird and drained the blood
[1:34:29] out upon the other bird. This is in in
[1:34:30] the book of Leviticus it says, "And the
[1:34:33] other bird was speckled with the red
[1:34:35] blood and it flopped its wings like this
[1:34:38] and the blood cried holy, holy, holy as
[1:34:42] it bathe the ground." So the so the one
[1:34:45] bed a bird is killed and they take the
[1:34:47] blood from that one bird and they
[1:34:49] sprinkle it on the living bird. And when
[1:34:51] the living bird goes, amen, to to
[1:34:53] flying, amen, the blood is dripping and
[1:34:55] hitting the ground. When you're
[1:34:57] walking, when you're living your
[1:34:59] everyday life, people should see the the
[1:35:01] blood coming and flowing from your life.
[1:35:03] The blood of Jesus is all over. We can
[1:35:06] see it in your walk. We can hear it in
[1:35:08] your talk. We can see how you live your
[1:35:11] life. It's the blood of Jesus. Amen.
[1:35:14] Hallelujah. He says that he says, "Holy,
[1:35:16] holy, as it's bathed," Amen. a a as it
[1:35:20] bathed the ground. So Christ the dead
[1:35:22] mate put his blood his blood from his
[1:35:25] life uh into us carrying his blood
[1:35:28] crying holy holy unto the Lord. It's an
[1:35:30] oddlooking bird. Sure it is. But she the
[1:35:34] bride is identified by him. Amen. And
[1:35:37] she is independent from all others. Keep
[1:35:40] the only unto her as long as you both
[1:35:43] live. Keep thee only to him the word. No
[1:35:46] adultery, not one sign of denomination,
[1:35:49] not one sign of creed, no adultery at
[1:35:51] all. The word in him alone on Christ the
[1:35:54] silent rock I stand. All other grounds
[1:35:56] is sink and sand. Uh that's that's how
[1:35:59] you know who the bride is. You want to
[1:36:01] know who she is? She going to be
[1:36:02] separated from everybody else. She will
[1:36:03] not have one
[1:36:05] denominational feather.
[1:36:07] Amen.
[1:36:09] Can I go a little further?
[1:36:12] Now, her
[1:36:15] characteristics also look a little bit
[1:36:18] like what you find in Genesis 24 when
[1:36:22] you read the story of Rebecca.
[1:36:27] And the what we find here is that
[1:36:30] Rebecca was uh spiritual enough to know
[1:36:34] that God was up to something when she
[1:36:36] gets out there to the well and and it's
[1:36:39] just a normal everyday routine for her
[1:36:41] to go there to the well and and get
[1:36:43] water out the well and and and the water
[1:36:45] the animals and everything. But when she
[1:36:47] get there this day, there's a man there
[1:36:49] with with 10 camels. And uh and and she
[1:36:52] had enough character about herself that,
[1:36:55] you know, this man probably been on a
[1:36:56] long journey. Let me offer him some
[1:36:58] water and let me offer his camels some
[1:37:00] water. Hallelujah. But she had no idea
[1:37:03] in her kindness.
[1:37:05] Glory to God. That she was actually
[1:37:07] walking right into a prayer.
[1:37:12] The man had just said amen to his
[1:37:14] prayer. a prayer like, "Lord, let the
[1:37:16] woman that come to the well and offer me
[1:37:19] water and also my camels." Cuz it's one
[1:37:22] thing to offer me water. That don't take
[1:37:23] nothing to just d I mean to just just go
[1:37:26] down and get a little water for me. But
[1:37:28] when you offering water to the camels,
[1:37:29] you got to understand something. Every
[1:37:31] camel drunk so many gallons of water.
[1:37:34] And I and I believe if I'm not mistaken,
[1:37:36] I think each camel would drink about 20
[1:37:38] gallons of water. Imagine how much water
[1:37:41] this woman is getting out this well in
[1:37:43] order to give 10 camels. 200 gallons of
[1:37:47] water.
[1:37:49] So, let me just tell you, this just
[1:37:50] ain't no any type of woman. She got
[1:37:52] character.
[1:37:54] That's it. She willing to work.
[1:37:57] She's a Proverbs 31 type woman.
[1:38:01] Hallelujah. I mean, she she willing to
[1:38:03] kind of put some some sweat in. Amen.
[1:38:06] And as as Rebecca said, you know what?
[1:38:08] I'm I'mma give water to him and water to
[1:38:10] his camel. She didn't realize she was
[1:38:12] walking into the manifestation of a
[1:38:14] prayer. Amen. Yeah.
[1:38:18] Before Before she knew it, Eza like, you
[1:38:20] know, I need to know who your parents
[1:38:21] are. Who's this and who's that? And then
[1:38:24] then and when she come when when he come
[1:38:25] to find out who she relate related to
[1:38:28] say, uhoh, I know I found Isaac his wife
[1:38:31] because the wife had to be blood
[1:38:33] relation.
[1:38:34] Hallelujah. when when when Abraham sent
[1:38:36] him back, go back to my people. And now
[1:38:39] now here's the other thing. Oh, glory to
[1:38:41] God. He said, he said, now now he's
[1:38:44] actually said, now what if this woman
[1:38:47] don't want to go with me when I find
[1:38:50] her? What if she don't want to go? Say,
[1:38:51] if she don't want to go, don't worry.
[1:38:53] You you freed from your oath. But this
[1:38:55] woman got to be willing, Rebecca, the
[1:38:57] bride, has got to be willing to forsake
[1:39:00] everything to follow Christ. Yes, sir.
[1:39:03] Amen. Amen. Amen. I love this. I love
[1:39:06] this. She knew. She found out she was an
[1:39:09] answer to
[1:39:10] prayer. She was willing to listen. Amen.
[1:39:14] And follow the messenger for her day,
[1:39:15] which was Elea. The bride is going to be
[1:39:18] willing to do that. Let me give you
[1:39:20] another one. And uh and and let me I I
[1:39:23] just I just kind of threw something in
[1:39:25] here. See, she was willing to listen and
[1:39:27] follow the the messenger. Amen. for that
[1:39:29] day. Just like when Jesus died on the
[1:39:33] cross and three days, the reason that he
[1:39:36] was in the the the the the grave for
[1:39:39] three days, there was something keeping
[1:39:41] him in the grave. Now, now, now, now
[1:39:43] look, he had power to to to lay himself
[1:39:45] down, lay his life down, and then raise
[1:39:48] it up again. If if a man tells you that,
[1:39:50] hallelujah, and and he actually does it,
[1:39:52] it says the power didn't come in three
[1:39:55] days. The power was always there. That's
[1:39:57] right. That's right. Amen. Amen. But why
[1:40:00] did he wait three days? Why? Because
[1:40:03] there was a prophecy that had been
[1:40:06] written about him. Amen. In Psalm 16:10,
[1:40:10] for thou will not leave my soul in hell.
[1:40:13] Neither will thou suffer unholy one to
[1:40:16] see corruption. Corruption usually sets
[1:40:18] sin by three days. So he had to stay
[1:40:20] there because David made a prophecy. The
[1:40:24] prophecy is what held him in the grave.
[1:40:26] My God. But it was his prophecy that
[1:40:29] brought him up. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:40:33] Glory. Glory. Glory. Amen. And and here
[1:40:38] here the word is what governs us. The
[1:40:39] word is what controls us. Amen. Here
[1:40:42] Rebecca, she was willing to listen and
[1:40:45] follow the messenger. Just like Jesus
[1:40:48] was willing to stay there in the grave,
[1:40:50] Amen. until that prophecy had been
[1:40:52] fulfilled. Rebecca was willing to listen
[1:40:54] and follow the messenger. She heard,
[1:40:57] Amen. the voice of God coming through
[1:40:59] Eleaza, my God. And we heard the voice
[1:41:01] of God coming through Revelation for uh
[1:41:04] Revelation 18:4. Come out of her, my
[1:41:06] people. Amen. Here's the other thing
[1:41:09] about Rebecca. She had to make a
[1:41:12] decision to leave mama, to leave daddy,
[1:41:17] and leave her brother. Now, I want to
[1:41:19] just take my time here because brother
[1:41:21] Brandham said when it came time for her
[1:41:23] to make a decision whether to leave
[1:41:24] mama, to leave daddy and her brother,
[1:41:27] the daddy never said a
[1:41:29] word. But the mama was saying, uh, the
[1:41:31] brother say, "Hey, just let her stay
[1:41:32] here 10 more days." And she said, "No,
[1:41:35] no, no. I I need to just kind of get on
[1:41:36] my way." And then the mama said, "Well,
[1:41:38] no. Uh, what about this? What about
[1:41:40] that?" They were they were coming up
[1:41:41] with all kind of excuses to try to keep
[1:41:43] Rebecca. Hello, somebody. I I I hope you
[1:41:46] get this. Rebecca had to see through the
[1:41:48] excuses.
[1:41:50] And you know what they did with Rebecca?
[1:41:52] They said, uh, you know, she's old
[1:41:54] enough. Let her make her own decision.
[1:42:00] Daddy couldn't hold her. I mean, brother
[1:42:02] couldn't hold her. Mama couldn't. And
[1:42:04] brother Brandham say the mother
[1:42:06] represented the church. The mother in
[1:42:09] the story of Rebecca was the church that
[1:42:11] was trying to hold Rebecca back from
[1:42:13] going forward. Amen.
[1:42:16] The mother in the scripture represented
[1:42:18] a church that was trying to hold Rebecca
[1:42:21] back from going forward. And the brother
[1:42:24] in the story was the preacher in the
[1:42:27] church trying to hold Rebecca back.
[1:42:32] Oh my. Can I go a little further? If the
[1:42:35] brother was the preacher, then Rebecca
[1:42:38] had to have enough strength to walk away
[1:42:41] from the preacher. Right. If the mother
[1:42:44] represented the church, then Rebecca had
[1:42:47] to have enough strength to walk away
[1:42:49] from the church. Now listen here. I am
[1:42:52] talking to many Rebecca's in this
[1:42:54] building this morning. Cuz many of y'all
[1:42:57] had enough strength to walk away from a
[1:42:59] preacher and walk away, praise God, from
[1:43:01] a old church that you were connected to.
[1:43:04] Hallelujah. You heard come out of her,
[1:43:07] my people, and you came out.
[1:43:10] You don't even realize it, but I might
[1:43:12] as well tell you before I get there. You
[1:43:14] experience a resurrection right at that
[1:43:16] moment.
[1:43:18] [Applause]
[1:43:25] How do I know you experienced the
[1:43:28] resurrection at that moment? Because the
[1:43:30] question is, where did they bury
[1:43:33] her? Where was where was this bride
[1:43:35] buried? if if she's going to experience
[1:43:37] the resurrection, where was she
[1:43:41] buried? Well, before we find out where
[1:43:44] she was
[1:43:45] buried, let's find out where our
[1:43:47] bridegroom was buried.
[1:43:49] Let's read a few scriptures. Our
[1:43:51] bridegroom was buried. Let's Matthew
[1:43:54] 27:57 through 60. Because see, the bride
[1:43:57] and the bridegroom going to be a perfect
[1:43:59] type. So, let's find out where our
[1:44:01] bridegroom was buried.
[1:44:03] Matthew
[1:44:06] 27:57-60. When the evening was
[1:44:09] come, there came a rich man of Arya
[1:44:13] named
[1:44:14] Joseph, who also himself was Jesus's
[1:44:18] disciple. He went to Pilate and begged
[1:44:22] the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded
[1:44:25] the body to be delivered.
[1:44:28] And when Joseph had taken the body, he
[1:44:31] wrapped it in a clean linen
[1:44:34] cloth. And look at this. And laid
[1:44:37] it in his own new
[1:44:41] tomb, which he had heuned out in the
[1:44:44] rock, and he rolled a great stone to the
[1:44:46] door of the suppler, and departed. So
[1:44:49] here we find our Lord and Savior buried
[1:44:53] in a tomb. Amen. And it happened to be
[1:44:56] the tomb of Joseph of Arythea. Now, if I
[1:45:00] can just put it this way, it was a
[1:45:01] borrowed tomb. Yes, sir. Jesus didn't
[1:45:05] need a grave because he wasn't going to
[1:45:08] use it for too long. That's right. No
[1:45:11] sense in paying for the plot.
[1:45:14] I won't be here long enough.
[1:45:17] All right. So there there's a borrowed
[1:45:19] tomb and and and and and here uh Joseph
[1:45:21] has this has his body and he takes him
[1:45:23] to the tomb and we pick up in in uh
[1:45:26] Matthew 28 verse1. I read this a little
[1:45:28] early but we'll read it again because
[1:45:30] this
[1:45:31] Easter is what Easter is all about here.
[1:45:35] Amen. Uh verse one says, "In the end of
[1:45:39] the
[1:45:39] Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the
[1:45:42] first day of the week, came Mary
[1:45:45] Magdalene and the other Mary to see the
[1:45:47] supplr. And behold, there was a great
[1:45:50] earthquake. For the angel of the Lord
[1:45:52] descended from heaven, and came and
[1:45:54] rolled back the stone from the door, and
[1:45:58] sat upon it." Now, now the other thing
[1:45:59] about that that that that that door when
[1:46:02] um when Jesus died, the there was the
[1:46:05] the Pharisees and Sadducees went to the
[1:46:08] uh the leaders of that day say, "Hey,
[1:46:10] put guards by this." You know, because
[1:46:12] we we heard that this man say that he
[1:46:15] was going to rise again and we want to
[1:46:17] ensure that nothing like this happened.
[1:46:19] So, put some guards and and and they
[1:46:21] sent God say, "Now, make that that that
[1:46:24] grave as sure as you can." That's right.
[1:46:28] That's what they did. They tried to make
[1:46:30] it. They had people watching. Amen. All
[1:46:32] night, all day, making sure that this
[1:46:34] this this grave could not be broken.
[1:46:37] Hallelujah. They had men there to
[1:46:39] protect it from other men coming. They
[1:46:43] had in their mind that the disciples
[1:46:45] were going to come and and bring Jesus
[1:46:47] out the grave.
[1:46:50] Hallelujah. Let me tell you something.
[1:46:52] When you need a resurrection, disciples
[1:46:54] can't do it. That's right.
[1:46:56] When you need a resurrection, the pastor
[1:46:59] can't do it. The deacons can't do it.
[1:47:01] Song leader can't do. I mean, only God
[1:47:04] himself can give you a resurrection.
[1:47:08] It's a supernatural event that you
[1:47:10] experience.
[1:47:12] Here we find in the end of the Sabbath
[1:47:15] as it began to dawn toward the first day
[1:47:17] of the week came Mary Magdalene and Ma
[1:47:20] Magdalene and the other Mary to see the
[1:47:21] supplic. Behold, there was a great
[1:47:23] earthquake, for the angel of the Lord
[1:47:24] descended from heaven, and came and
[1:47:26] rolled back the stone from the door.
[1:47:28] Amen. And sat upon it. I I just like
[1:47:31] this. They the guards are here. Watching
[1:47:34] any man, they watching here on the earth
[1:47:37] looking for anything that would any
[1:47:39] movement. But here, God is coming down
[1:47:42] like this. Oh my. And when he descends
[1:47:45] down, when he when he when he comes
[1:47:46] down, he rolls the stone. They saw no
[1:47:49] man, right? But they see this big stone
[1:47:52] being moved away. And when they not only
[1:47:55] just not just the angel come and Amen
[1:47:57] and moved away, then the angel just sat
[1:47:59] down right on top of the stone. Look,
[1:48:00] there's some things the devil I don't
[1:48:02] care how he might be trying to block
[1:48:04] you, how he might be trying to stop you.
[1:48:06] When God begins to move on your behalf,
[1:48:09] can't no devil can't no devil do nothing
[1:48:12] about it.
[1:48:13] [Music]
[1:48:15] Hallelujah.
[1:48:17] Glory to God. We serve a risen savior.
[1:48:22] Amen. Verse three says, "His countenance
[1:48:25] was like lightning and his reignment
[1:48:28] white as snow. And for fear of him, the
[1:48:33] keepers did shake and became as dead
[1:48:36] men." Now, they supposed to be watching
[1:48:38] over the dead and they falling out
[1:48:41] dead. Now, here's the other bad part
[1:48:43] about this that now these men know their
[1:48:46] experience.
[1:48:47] They they know exactly what happened.
[1:48:49] They saw the angels. It counted like
[1:48:50] lightning. They and they falling out
[1:48:52] dead like like like dead men. But but
[1:48:54] when they get amongst the the the
[1:48:56] religious leaders, they say, "Now just
[1:48:59] tell the people that the disciples did
[1:49:01] this now cuz it's going to be too
[1:49:03] farfetched if you tell them we saw an
[1:49:06] angel." The the guards testimony. Don't
[1:49:10] go. They they got paid not to tell they
[1:49:13] testimony. Right. Right. Right. Yeah, we
[1:49:18] we we going to make sure you don't get
[1:49:19] in no trouble like you fell asleep on
[1:49:20] the job. We going to make sure that No,
[1:49:21] I I look, I did not fall asleep on the
[1:49:24] job. Let me tell you what happened. A
[1:49:26] angel came down from heaven like
[1:49:29] lightning.
[1:49:32] I don't know who this man y'all messing
[1:49:33] with, but y'all shouldn't mess with him.
[1:49:37] Yes, sir. And and and I can see them
[1:49:40] fell. I'd advise you to stop right now.
[1:49:42] Whatever you're doing, you need to stop.
[1:49:45] Repent. Cuz y'all made a mistake with
[1:49:47] this fella right here. That's right.
[1:49:50] Said, "Man, I done watched many graves,
[1:49:53] and ain't nothing like this ever
[1:49:54] happened at no grave."
[1:49:56] Right.
[1:49:59] The fear of the of fear of him, the
[1:50:01] keepers did shake and became his dead
[1:50:03] men. And the angel answered and said
[1:50:06] unto the women, "Um, fear not. Fear not
[1:50:09] ye, for I know that you seek Jesus,
[1:50:12] which was
[1:50:14] crucified, Oh, I love the I love it. I
[1:50:17] love it. Here's the announcement of
[1:50:18] Easter. He is not here.
[1:50:23] For he is risen
[1:50:25] as he said.
[1:50:28] Glory to God. Come see the place where
[1:50:32] the Lord laid. He's not there anymore.
[1:50:35] And I had a chance to go see it for
[1:50:37] myself. He is not there. Hallelujah.
[1:50:40] There's still an empty tomb in Israel.
[1:50:42] Thank God he is alive and well. They
[1:50:46] buried him in a tomb. Where did they
[1:50:52] bury
[1:50:54] her? All right, this is coming out of
[1:50:57] the message, the true Easter Seal. The
[1:51:00] prophet gives us the answer to the
[1:51:01] question. We find out where they buried
[1:51:05] her because it's a
[1:51:08] resurrection for the bride.
[1:51:11] Now, um I believe I'm I'm starting where
[1:51:15] it says, "And they would do the same
[1:51:16] today. They're trying to do the same
[1:51:19] today." Okay, if we would just scroll up
[1:51:21] just a just one up the other way. There
[1:51:25] you go. Right there. Stop right there.
[1:51:27] And the world put him in a
[1:51:32] tomb and sealed him up in that
[1:51:36] tomb. And they would do the same today.
[1:51:40] They are trying to do the same today.
[1:51:43] Look at what the prophet says. I don't
[1:51:44] want you to miss this. The world is
[1:51:47] trying and will get worse all the time.
[1:51:51] He says to seal Christ back in the tomb
[1:51:54] again. They're trying to make him a
[1:51:56] historical god. One that walked in the
[1:51:59] days and give power to the disciples to
[1:52:01] heal the sick and to cast out devils.
[1:52:02] But what did they do as soon as they
[1:52:04] thought they had got to got rid of him?
[1:52:07] just like Cain did uh when he thought he
[1:52:09] got when he then thought he got rid of
[1:52:11] Abel, they sealed him in a tomb and and
[1:52:14] put him in there. And
[1:52:17] today they're trying to keep Christ in a
[1:52:21] tomb. But oh, what an Easter morning
[1:52:24] done. An Easter morning ruined all of
[1:52:28] the theology. And when a Easter morning
[1:52:31] came for a people, a church
[1:52:33] here, 1900 years later, it ruined their
[1:52:38] theology. He's not dead. He's alive
[1:52:42] forever more. They cannot keep him in no
[1:52:47] tomb. You can put him in a Methodist
[1:52:51] tomb. Any of y'all come from the
[1:52:53] Methodist church? You can put him in a
[1:52:55] Methodist tomb or a Baptist tomb or a
[1:52:59] Presbyterian tomb or whatever you want
[1:53:01] to, but he raised out of that tomb and
[1:53:04] is alive today. I had a Baptist tomb.
[1:53:10] Lord,
[1:53:11] oh my. Brother Brandham said, I was
[1:53:14] buried in a Baptist tomb, but when the
[1:53:17] word came to me, praise God, it broke me
[1:53:20] out of that Baptist tomb. It brought a
[1:53:23] resurrection to my life. And some of
[1:53:26] y'all come from a Pentecostal tomb. Some
[1:53:29] come from a Catholic tomb. Whatever tomb
[1:53:31] you come from, you have received a
[1:53:34] resurrection,
[1:53:37] proven that he is alive today and
[1:53:40] forever more. Where did they bury her
[1:53:43] at? In the denominational tomb. I had a
[1:53:48] Baptist tomb. You might have had a
[1:53:50] Methodist tomb, but one day Jesus rose
[1:53:52] from there. Jesus rose from there. Where
[1:53:55] was Jesus rising from? How? How was
[1:53:58] Jesus rising from a Methodist tomb and a
[1:54:00] Baptist tomb? Jesus is rising in you.
[1:54:04] Hallelujah.
[1:54:07] Amen. No, the reason you're here is
[1:54:09] because you yourself have experienced a
[1:54:11] personal resurrection. Yes, sir. Yes,
[1:54:14] sir. You in a worldly tomb. You in a bar
[1:54:18] tomb.
[1:54:19] Huh? You were in all kind of all kind of
[1:54:22] conditions, your your tomb. But somehow
[1:54:24] God broke you free from all of that.
[1:54:26] Lord, supernaturally broke you free from
[1:54:29] all that. And you've experienced your
[1:54:31] own personal resurrection. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:34] Amen.
[1:54:36] Oh, I love it. I had a Baptist tomb. You
[1:54:39] might have had a Methodist tomb. But one
[1:54:41] day, Jesus rose from there from a
[1:54:43] historical God to a living, present God,
[1:54:46] alive forever more.
[1:54:49] I I uh want to remind you that remember
[1:54:54] three is the number of life and Jesus
[1:54:57] rose on that third day. They couldn't
[1:55:00] keep him in that tomb. And I love the
[1:55:02] the scripture in Revelation 11:18. It
[1:55:05] says, "I am he that liveth and was dead
[1:55:06] and behold, I'm alive forever more.
[1:55:08] Amen. And have the keys of of of hell
[1:55:11] and of death." Now, when we when we look
[1:55:14] at this, I want to make a just a quick
[1:55:16] turn here. Uh when we look at
[1:55:19] this, where did the bride
[1:55:23] die and she needed a
[1:55:26] resurrection? Where where where where
[1:55:28] did she where did she have this this
[1:55:30] little death? Brother Brandham actually
[1:55:31] makes a statement and it
[1:55:35] says in the beautiful bride of Christ
[1:55:38] after her death through the dark ages by
[1:55:42] the Roman
[1:55:43] Empire. So now that statement is
[1:55:46] important because it takes us back
[1:55:49] to Revelation 3:1 and we can pull that
[1:55:53] up again. I read this earlier and
[1:55:56] because when you look at
[1:55:58] scripture, especially when you're
[1:56:00] looking at the church as it as it is
[1:56:02] related in Revelation 2 and Revelation
[1:56:05] 3, and I'm going to tell y'all
[1:56:07] something. I am so glad that we can we
[1:56:09] can go beyond tradition. Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:56:13] There's many churches stuck 2,000 years
[1:56:15] ago.
[1:56:17] But we can go beyond that. Amen. And
[1:56:20] when we begin to see ourselves and what
[1:56:22] God has done for us, It's not just a
[1:56:25] historical story. This No, this is a
[1:56:27] present tense story and it's happening
[1:56:29] even right now.
[1:56:31] Somebody's receiving a resurrection
[1:56:33] right now. Yes, sir. Hallelujah. But but
[1:56:38] but but when we look at scripture,
[1:56:40] Revelation 2, Amen. Um the the church
[1:56:44] ages are getting started. Paul being the
[1:56:46] first messenger and he's coming with so
[1:56:47] much light, so much revelation, so much
[1:56:49] understanding. But by the time it gets
[1:56:52] down to the the the fourth church age,
[1:56:54] which is the thotan church age, the
[1:56:56] church itself went into the
[1:56:59] depths of Satan. There was and and not
[1:57:02] only that the the fourth church age is
[1:57:04] called the dark ages.
[1:57:07] The church almost almost the light
[1:57:09] almost gone out. God just had a very few
[1:57:11] that that uh had not uh uh bowed down
[1:57:14] to, you know, all the false teachers and
[1:57:15] all that. There was a a very few that
[1:57:17] was kind of carrying the gospel until we
[1:57:20] get to the the third chapter. Amen. Of
[1:57:22] Revelation. These are the last three
[1:57:24] church ages. Three is the number of
[1:57:30] life. Yes, sir.
[1:57:33] Hallelujah. And how how do we know life
[1:57:35] is coming in? Amen. Just as we read
[1:57:38] there in Genesis on the third day, the
[1:57:40] trees and the and and and and and the
[1:57:42] seed going forth in the earth. I mean
[1:57:44] everything yielding and bringing forth
[1:57:45] of its kind. That was life being that
[1:57:48] life coming forth. So, so on the third
[1:57:50] day Jesus brought life, but also it was
[1:57:53] in the third chapter of Revelation that
[1:57:56] life began to come forth.
[1:57:59] That's why I read Revelation 3:1. Look
[1:58:00] at it. And unto the angel of the church
[1:58:03] in Sardis, which this just happens to be
[1:58:06] Luther,
[1:58:09] these things saith, he that hath the
[1:58:11] seven spirits of God, and the seven
[1:58:14] stars, I know thy works, that thou hast
[1:58:17] a name, that thou livest. It look like
[1:58:21] you living, but you're dead. Now, why
[1:58:25] does the scripture record it that way?
[1:58:28] Because Luther broke out by nailing
[1:58:30] those 95 thesis to the church door which
[1:58:33] actually begin to bring life back in the
[1:58:34] church after the dark ages had passed.
[1:58:36] God began to bring life back in the
[1:58:38] church. The problem was as Luther come
[1:58:40] out with his teachings the ones that
[1:58:42] followed Luther went and started another
[1:58:45] denomination. And anytime we start a
[1:58:47] denomination we are going into death.
[1:58:51] Amen. Truth. Can I just be honest with
[1:58:53] you? If you walking uh look look if you
[1:58:57] if you working in a denomination, you
[1:59:00] living in a denomination, you giving all
[1:59:02] your uh your your your your your
[1:59:04] your uh gifts to the denomination. The
[1:59:09] Bible actually declares, Amen. In in the
[1:59:11] New Testament, I think it's in
[1:59:12] Ephesians, might be Ephesians 5:14, it
[1:59:14] says, it says, "Come out from amongst
[1:59:16] the dead."
[1:59:18] Right? You're walking and you're living
[1:59:21] amongst the dead. Now, now look, look
[1:59:22] here. Look here. Look here. when when
[1:59:24] when when you have to be the one to come
[1:59:26] out. If you go in and you recognize what
[1:59:28] you're in, you have to be the one to
[1:59:30] come out.
[1:59:32] Oh, glory to God. Come out from amongst
[1:59:36] the dead. Stop giving your talent and
[1:59:38] all your attention to something that's
[1:59:40] dead. God ain't going to use it. Do you
[1:59:42] realize in this church age, God is on
[1:59:44] the outside of his church knocking,
[1:59:46] trying to get back in? How did they put
[1:59:48] him out?
[1:59:51] They rejected his word.
[1:59:53] But the bride will receive his word.
[1:59:57] Let me go a little
[1:59:59] further. The third
[2:00:02] chapter tells
[2:00:04] us they had a name that they live as but
[2:00:06] are dead. Now Luther is the messenger to
[2:00:10] Sardis. Wesley is a messenger to
[2:00:13] Philadelphia. And then also Leodia had
[2:00:16] their messenger by the name of William
[2:00:18] Mary and Brandham. Life came back into
[2:00:20] the church after the dark ages. In the
[2:00:23] third chapter of Revelation, life was
[2:00:25] restored to the church. Can I put it
[2:00:28] this way? The church received a
[2:00:31] resurrection. Yes, sir. Amen. Amen.
[2:00:36] I got a question here. How does she
[2:00:37] receive her resurrection? And and and
[2:00:39] here here's the other thing that I like
[2:00:41] about this word resurrection.
[2:00:43] Resurrection has a
[2:00:45] synonym. And that means there's a bunch
[2:00:47] of other words that's uh words or
[2:00:50] phrases that mean exact or nearly the
[2:00:52] same as another word or phrase in the
[2:00:56] same language. So uh resurrection has a
[2:00:59] synonym. And you want to know what the
[2:01:02] synonym for resurrection
[2:01:04] is?
[2:01:08] Restoration. Yes, sir.
[2:01:11] So, how did the church
[2:01:15] receive a resurrection?
[2:01:19] Joel chapter 2.
[2:01:22] [Applause]
[2:01:25] Can we go back and read?
[2:01:28] How did the church receive a
[2:01:30] resurrection? The synonym for
[2:01:32] resurrection is restoration. It came
[2:01:34] through Joel chapter 2. Let's start
[2:01:38] reading here at verse 23. Let me just
[2:01:40] read it. Praise God. Be glad
[2:01:43] then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice
[2:01:47] in the Lord your God, for he hath given
[2:01:49] you the former rain moderately, and he
[2:01:51] will cause to come down for you the
[2:01:53] rain, the former rain, and the valor
[2:01:55] rain in the first month. He says, "And
[2:01:57] the floor shall be full of wheat, and
[2:01:59] the fat shall overflow with wine and
[2:02:04] oil." We experiencing that right now. a
[2:02:07] overflow of whining or a stimulation of
[2:02:09] revelation. It says, "And
[2:02:11] I will," this ain't nothing a man going
[2:02:14] to do. This is all God. I will restore
[2:02:18] to you. Praise God. The
[2:02:22] years, Amen. The locust have eaten the
[2:02:26] cankerorm and a caterpillar and the
[2:02:28] polar, my great army, which I sent
[2:02:31] amongst you.
[2:02:33] I let that happen so there could be a
[2:02:36] resurrection. That's why Jesus had to
[2:02:38] lay his life down and raise and pick it
[2:02:41] up again to show that there would be
[2:02:43] life after death. There would be a
[2:02:45] resurrection.
[2:02:48] And if the bridegroom had a
[2:02:50] resurrection,
[2:02:52] so will the bride.
[2:02:55] And I might as well say not will the
[2:02:57] bride. That's that's for your those that
[2:02:59] don't know who they are. But we who know
[2:03:02] who we are, we have already experienced
[2:03:05] our personal resurrection.
[2:03:09] Look at verse 25. 26. And ye shall eat
[2:03:14] here. Here here. If somebody ask you
[2:03:16] who's speaking at the meetings, just
[2:03:18] just give them verse 26. If you come,
[2:03:21] you don't need to know who going to
[2:03:22] speak. The Holy Ghost going to speak.
[2:03:23] But I'm going to tell you, if you come,
[2:03:24] I got a promise for you. Ye shall eat in
[2:03:28] plenty and be satisfied
[2:03:32] and praise the name of the Lord your God
[2:03:35] that have dealt wonders with you and my
[2:03:37] people shall never be ashamed and ye
[2:03:39] shall know that I am in the midst of her
[2:03:41] of Israel and that I am the Lord your
[2:03:43] God and none else and my people shall
[2:03:46] never be ashamed. You know uh I I got I
[2:03:50] got one quote that I want to read here
[2:03:52] just to kind of bring all this home. But
[2:03:54] before I read that, um, go to it's it's
[2:03:58] the rising of the sun. It's on the last
[2:04:00] page. Uh, it's the rising of the sun.
[2:04:03] Because,
[2:04:05] uh, as I started off by saying, brother
[2:04:07] brother Brandon would say certain
[2:04:09] things. And when he would say it, it
[2:04:12] would really challenge the way that we
[2:04:14] look at everything. It's a prophetic
[2:04:16] lens that we're looking through. I I can
[2:04:19] look through a theological lens. I can
[2:04:21] look through it. And and I mean I I know
[2:04:23] churches today they're so happy about
[2:04:24] all the people that's coming. They told
[2:04:26] me last year uh one church had 68,000
[2:04:28] new people show up.
[2:04:31] 68,000. I wonder how many stayed after
[2:04:34] Easter.
[2:04:36] Or would the same 68,000 come back this
[2:04:39] year because they're going to have a
[2:04:41] nice program?
[2:04:44] We're not here for program. We're here
[2:04:46] for you to recognize who you are.
[2:04:49] Here. Here, I want you to catch this.
[2:04:51] Brother brother Solomon referred to it
[2:04:53] earlier. Amen. And brother Troy when he
[2:04:55] was preaching a few weeks ago, he
[2:04:57] referred to it. So, I want you to just
[2:04:58] kind of catch this statement. He says,
[2:05:00] "As Christ was the first one to
[2:05:04] raise from all the prophets and so
[2:05:06] forth, all although typed in many
[2:05:08] places, he was the first fruits of those
[2:05:10] that slept in the bride in the bride
[2:05:13] coming of Christ." in the bride coming
[2:05:18] of Christ coming out of the church.
[2:05:21] That's the bride coming of Christ. Oh,
[2:05:23] you don't even realize how you was able
[2:05:26] to walk out of that.
[2:05:28] Some of y'all was so connected. They had
[2:05:31] you on this board and they had you on
[2:05:34] that board. They was getting ready to
[2:05:36] work a new board for you to try to put
[2:05:38] you on that one, too. I mean, they had
[2:05:40] you so tied down you and and every day
[2:05:42] you was wrapped up in something.
[2:05:46] Some of y'all saw that. Some of y'all
[2:05:48] saw him stealing. Brother Mike used to
[2:05:50] tell me how he honest heart would go up
[2:05:54] here and raise an offering and say,
[2:05:56] "Now," and what you do is you take $50
[2:05:58] out your pocket. You say, "Look, we want
[2:06:00] we want 50. We want you to bring $50
[2:06:02] tonight." And and I'mma be the first one
[2:06:04] to put $50 right here in the offering
[2:06:06] plate. They say they would put their $50
[2:06:09] in. and everybody else walk up, put
[2:06:11] their $50 in, and then they take the
[2:06:13] money to the back and they pull their
[2:06:15] $50 out and put it back in their pocket.
[2:06:20] This type of stuff happened all the time
[2:06:21] in churches.
[2:06:24] I mean, you know, I I remember going to
[2:06:26] to church here uh one time we went to
[2:06:28] concert. John Pi had come amen to town
[2:06:31] and he was um he was min I mean he was
[2:06:33] uh singing and um I don't know what I'm
[2:06:37] sorry I said something this thing
[2:06:40] talking to me now but John P was
[2:06:43] um he uh he come there and we were
[2:06:46] sitting there waiting why come he won't
[2:06:48] come out on stage we just I mean concert
[2:06:49] should have started at at 6 or something
[2:06:52] and this man ain't come out on stage
[2:06:53] about 9:30 like what happened so John P
[2:06:56] say you know I done brought this bus all
[2:06:57] the way down here and these people,
[2:06:58] honest people, come down here looking
[2:07:00] for a concert. I'mma give him the
[2:07:01] concert. He say, "But but don't y'all
[2:07:03] mess up my money again.
[2:07:05] Somebody has stole a man's money. They
[2:07:07] promised to pay him a certain amount. He
[2:07:09] had to pay to bring them people down
[2:07:10] here. Somebody stole the man's money."
[2:07:12] And in church, it's this happening all
[2:07:13] the time. They stealing the money.
[2:07:18] Oh, let me I just heard I heard one last
[2:07:22] week. I heard one last week. Oh, y'all I
[2:07:25] know y'all at I know y'all mind that.
[2:07:29] I ain't going to tell y'all
[2:07:30] that. That
[2:07:34] Let me
[2:07:39] keep But it's Now, now look, I might as
[2:07:42] well say it since I'm here. Y'all don't
[2:07:45] pull me in there. Now, I know I I ain't
[2:07:48] going I'm I'mma do my best not to call
[2:07:50] names, but I know the preacher man
[2:07:54] recently said, "Lock the doors." Now,
[2:07:56] now look, look, I'm I'mma be
[2:07:59] honest. I've been brought up in church
[2:08:02] and that type of language been used a
[2:08:05] lot.
[2:08:07] Even the church that I was in the
[2:08:09] message,
[2:08:14] we trying to get a parking
[2:08:16] lot, lock them doors.
[2:08:22] So I So I understand why people do that.
[2:08:24] But but on the other side on the other
[2:08:26] side, $40,000 in one night. I Lord,
[2:08:30] that's a lot of money. I wish I I
[2:08:40] wish. Let the Lord send it. Come on. Let
[2:08:43] me let me get back on target, y'all.
[2:08:45] Y'all y'all done pulled me out my Easter
[2:08:48] sermon. as Christ was the first one to
[2:08:51] raise from all the prophets and so forth
[2:08:53] all although typed in many places. He
[2:08:56] was the first fruits of those that slept
[2:08:57] in the in the bride coming of Christ
[2:09:00] coming out of the church there have to
[2:09:02] be a sheath waved again in the last days
[2:09:04] on my waving of the sheath. What was a
[2:09:06] sheath? The first one that come to
[2:09:08] mature the first one that proved that it
[2:09:10] was a wheat that proved it was a sheath.
[2:09:14] Hallelujah. I'm sure you see what I'm
[2:09:17] talking about. It was weighed the people
[2:09:19] in the first time there there will come
[2:09:21] forth for the bride age a
[2:09:24] resurrection out of dark
[2:09:28] denominationalism. The bride will res
[2:09:30] the bride coming of Christ is a
[2:09:32] resurrection out of denominationalism.
[2:09:36] It was Christ in you calling you out of
[2:09:38] that.
[2:09:41] Now who you think calling you back into
[2:09:43] it?
[2:09:46] It's not Christ. He He calls you out of
[2:09:49] it. He stands on the outside knocking
[2:09:51] asking who would let me in. And only the
[2:09:54] individual can let them in. Let me keep
[2:09:56] going. The resurrection out of a dark
[2:09:59] denomination will be a message that the
[2:10:02] full maturity of the word has turned
[2:10:03] back again in its full power and being
[2:10:06] waved over the people by the same signs
[2:10:09] and wonders that he did back there. If
[2:10:10] you just listen to the tapes, you can
[2:10:12] hear the same signs and wonders that was
[2:10:14] in Jesus ministry was also in brother
[2:10:16] Brandham's ministry. Look at this.
[2:10:18] Because I
[2:10:22] live, ye live
[2:10:25] also. Speaking to his wife, because I
[2:10:30] live, ye live also. What a
[2:10:33] resurrection that
[2:10:37] was. That's past tense. 2,000 years ago.
[2:10:40] But look at the prophet bring it
[2:10:41] forward. What a
[2:10:43] resurrection this is.
[2:10:48] Amen. To be quickened from the dead to
[2:10:51] be made alive in Christ alive in Christ
[2:10:52] Jesus by God's quickening power. He was
[2:10:55] waved uh waved to them. The word which
[2:10:57] he was waved back to them on the day of
[2:10:59] Pentecost. The word was made manifest
[2:11:01] now and as I say is to be waved again in
[2:11:03] the last days. Now, let me finish with
[2:11:06] my last quote
[2:11:07] here because I told you how does the
[2:11:12] resurrection how does she receive a
[2:11:14] resurrection? It comes through the
[2:11:16] promise of restoration in Joel chapter
[2:11:19] 2. So, my whole thought is pulled right
[2:11:23] out of the sermon, the restoration of
[2:11:25] the bride. Or could I say it this way in
[2:11:28] a synonym fashion, the
[2:11:31] resurrection of the bride.
[2:11:38] Look at what the prophet says. I'm
[2:11:39] winding up. Musicians, y'all can make
[2:11:40] your way in a second. Get just get I got
[2:11:43] about four paragraphs here I want to
[2:11:45] read. Now notice and watch this. Watch
[2:11:48] this.
[2:11:50] Notice after three
[2:11:53] days. So three is the number of
[2:11:56] life. And after three days, the first
[2:11:59] tree restored as at the beginning having
[2:12:02] the same signs, same wonders. Jesus come
[2:12:05] back uh the same Jesus doing the same
[2:12:07] thing at the end of the third day. Now
[2:12:10] let me let me just just just drop this
[2:12:12] off. I told you Revelation 3:1
[2:12:15] Revelation 3 itself. Revelation 3 is a
[2:12:18] number of life. There was three
[2:12:20] messengers in Revelation 3. Sardis,
[2:12:23] Philadelphia, Leadyia. It's at the end
[2:12:26] of the third day. Life comes back to the
[2:12:29] church. Or the church receives a
[2:12:32] resurrection. It's at the end of the
[2:12:34] third day. Christ received his
[2:12:35] resurrection in the third day. Guess
[2:12:37] what? The church also, the bride,
[2:12:39] receives her resurrection in the third
[2:12:42] day. Amen. Beautiful. It's right there
[2:12:45] in the Bible.
[2:12:49] Look, we can preach Calvary from
[2:12:51] Revelation 3.
[2:12:54] I'm going to say that again. We as the
[2:12:57] bride of Christ can preach Calvary from
[2:13:00] Revelation 3.
[2:13:03] Now go to your average church
[2:13:05] today and find that sermon.
[2:13:09] Amen.
[2:13:11] Let me keep
[2:13:13] going having the same sign, same one as
[2:13:16] Jesus coming. And let me let me also
[2:13:18] People think when we say that that we
[2:13:20] being arrogant. Uh-uh. I'm not being
[2:13:24] arrogant. I'm I'm I'm a part of a
[2:13:26] restoration, sir. And I know who I am in
[2:13:30] Christ. Hallelujah. And and and nobody
[2:13:32] gonna make me feel bad about being me.
[2:13:36] Oh, Lord. God, y'all y'all got me out
[2:13:38] here. I'm just all over the place.
[2:13:42] I was telling my my my family the other
[2:13:45] night, and I don't know. I'm I'm getting
[2:13:47] old. I am. I know I am. I'm getting old.
[2:13:51] I'm I'm I'm I'm getting closer to 60
[2:13:55] than I am to
[2:13:59] 50. And it's something about getting
[2:14:02] old. Some of the old folk going to say
[2:14:05] amen to this. I know it. It's something
[2:14:08] about getting old. As you get
[2:14:12] older, you start to care less and less.
[2:14:15] Amen. about what people think.
[2:14:20] About what people say.
[2:14:24] Look, I am too old to be worried about
[2:14:27] that.
[2:14:29] If that's the way you feel, God bless
[2:14:32] you. But I ain't got time to explain
[2:14:34] nothing. I ain't got Look, I'm I'm Look,
[2:14:38] and I I'm not saying I'm just me. I'm
[2:14:40] just saying when you get old, it just
[2:14:42] things just
[2:14:48] Somebody asked me about a little project
[2:14:49] and I say, "Now, if I'm paying for the
[2:14:52] project,
[2:14:54] it's going to be what I like on the
[2:14:56] project
[2:14:57] [Music]
[2:14:59] cuz it's my money. And if you don't like
[2:15:02] the
[2:15:03] project, don't buy the project.
[2:15:07] Somebody else come buy it."
[2:15:11] I know y'all read between the lines. So,
[2:15:13] cuz y'all be y'all be picking at me all
[2:15:15] the time, but but let me finish reading
[2:15:19] this. At the end of the third day, the
[2:15:21] signs appeared. Not at the end of the
[2:15:23] first day. Oh, brother, I hope you're
[2:15:25] getting it. At the third day is when the
[2:15:28] real manifestation of Christ was made
[2:15:30] known. At the end of the third
[2:15:35] day. See, notice, are you getting it?
[2:15:40] Not at the first day. Not in Luther's
[2:15:42] day. Not at the first day. It says uh uh
[2:15:46] dead
[2:15:48] form. You have a name that you live, but
[2:15:51] you're dead. Dead form. Second day there
[2:15:55] was a rumor. See, second day it was
[2:15:58] still dead. Luther Wesley. At the
[2:16:02] beginning of the third day, there was a
[2:16:04] rumor around. All right. Nothing on the
[2:16:06] first day.
[2:16:08] Luther. See the first day was Luther.
[2:16:11] Nothing on the second day. That would be
[2:16:13] Wesley. And in the third day, the
[2:16:17] dispensation of the Holy Spirit, there
[2:16:19] was a room around uh that he was the
[2:16:22] same yesterday, today, and forever. But
[2:16:25] but at the end of the third day, that's
[2:16:28] when he made himself known. Come right
[2:16:31] among them. Come right among his people
[2:16:34] and said, "Look at me. I'm the same one.
[2:16:38] Lord have mercy. I could work with that.
[2:16:39] I can take you right back to the
[2:16:41] brothers on the road to Emmas.
[2:16:44] Yes, sir. It's when he broke bread that
[2:16:46] they recognized who he was.
[2:16:49] Oh my my my. And let me tell you
[2:16:51] something. He is right now breaking
[2:16:54] bread.
[2:16:59] He's breaking bread. And if you can if
[2:17:02] you can Oh my God. If you're willing
[2:17:05] to steal away
[2:17:08] from all of the
[2:17:10] unbelief of this hour, you can be fed.
[2:17:15] Hey, I'm feeling something. Feed on the
[2:17:19] secret things of God.
[2:17:22] [Music]
[2:17:25] Eat from the bread of life. For this
[2:17:29] season,
[2:17:30] you can be fed. Yes. Yes. My auntie left
[2:17:34] some words with us in a song.
[2:17:38] Let me try to read on. Good God
[2:17:41] almighty. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He
[2:17:44] says, "But at the end of the third day,
[2:17:45] that's when he made himself known. Come
[2:17:47] right among them. Come among his people
[2:17:49] and said, "Look at me. I'm the same
[2:17:51] one." The dead forms went on till they
[2:17:53] got to
[2:17:54] Pentecost. The dead forms went on.
[2:17:57] Luther Wesley all the way to Pentecost.
[2:17:59] They began then began to rumor around
[2:18:01] that he was now now here he here in the
[2:18:05] in the last day he is right among us
[2:18:07] moving right among us at the end of the
[2:18:09] third day. At the end of the third day
[2:18:12] he appeared and showed all them resurre
[2:18:15] all all them his resurrection sign that
[2:18:17] he was living the same yesterday today
[2:18:19] and forever living fruits of his
[2:18:21] presence. Living fruits of his presence.
[2:18:23] Are you getting it? The prophet getting
[2:18:25] excited y'all. Are you getting it?
[2:18:28] congregation says,
[2:18:30] "Amen. Was manifested at the very end of
[2:18:33] the day when he appeared to all of them,
[2:18:36] his church." Amen. Why? They all got
[2:18:39] together. Oh, amen. At the end of the
[2:18:41] third day,
[2:18:43] the evening
[2:18:44] lights, the Bible said, would shine in
[2:18:47] the last days. The evening light is the
[2:18:48] same light in the west. That was the
[2:18:51] same light was in the east. And the same
[2:18:53] light that shine in the east that
[2:18:54] brought forth the first church that the
[2:18:56] the Romans cut down by their pagan
[2:18:58] worship and so forth. And the evening
[2:19:00] light is the same light. Now notice the
[2:19:03] same light. What's the evening light
[2:19:05] come out for? What is the evening light
[2:19:07] for? Oh my. What is the evening light
[2:19:09] for? To
[2:19:11] restore. Woo. You get it? He says the
[2:19:14] evening light is for the same purpose
[2:19:17] the morning light was for. to restore
[2:19:20] what was cut down by the dark ages
[2:19:25] through Rome. That's where she died, but
[2:19:27] she came back to life. She was
[2:19:30] resurrected and the full manifestation
[2:19:33] of Christ in his church. Everything that
[2:19:35] he did just exactly the way he did, it
[2:19:38] would be again in the evening light. See
[2:19:40] what I mean? Oh, is that wonderful? And
[2:19:43] now, and know we're living right here to
[2:19:47] see it now. of the evening light.
[2:19:49] Exactly. According to the prophecy, the
[2:19:50] evening light come out to restore what?
[2:19:53] To restore what? The bugs had eat up.
[2:19:56] Let's keep going. It
[2:19:59] started growing and then what did it do?
[2:20:02] It
[2:20:03] denominated. So God pruned them off,
[2:20:06] bound them up, laid them back, let them
[2:20:08] go ahead and organize. Then the next one
[2:20:10] come up. He bound them up, laid them
[2:20:12] off. Tree went on. Then he bound them
[2:20:14] up, laid them off, went on. Now, one of
[2:20:16] these days they'll be burned. Bind them
[2:20:20] up in their
[2:20:23] organization. But then what? See, the
[2:20:25] the bride is a independent woman. She
[2:20:27] won't be a part of the organization.
[2:20:29] She's going to be outside of that. But
[2:20:32] then what? Right in the top of the tree
[2:20:34] is where the fruit ripens first. That's
[2:20:36] right. Watch this. Right in the top of
[2:20:38] the tree. So, it's the top of the tree
[2:20:39] here that sees the evening light. That
[2:20:43] mean the rest of the tree ain't going to
[2:20:45] see it, but the top of the tree will.
[2:20:48] And we just cut a tree down at our house
[2:20:50] and and and and I was complaining
[2:20:51] because I got these solar panels and I
[2:20:53] just could not see why my bill was still
[2:20:56] the same. They promised me the bill was
[2:20:57] going to go down and my bill was still
[2:20:59] about the same, but solar I'm like
[2:21:01] something wrong. Well, lately I just
[2:21:03] realized when that tree got cut down, it
[2:21:06] was blocking the sun from hitting some
[2:21:08] of them panels. It wasn't getting the
[2:21:10] full effect because because of the tree.
[2:21:12] But when that tree got cut down, I'm
[2:21:13] like, "Oh my, look at my bill."
[2:21:16] Nah, it's something. See, see, see the
[2:21:19] top of the tree get ripe first because
[2:21:21] it get the sun. The fruit in the top of
[2:21:23] the tree get ripe. Look at this. Look at
[2:21:26] this. Oh my my my my. And now it's
[2:21:28] dangerous to try to climb to the top of
[2:21:30] the tree. Most people want to stay at
[2:21:33] the bottom of the tree and you'll take
[2:21:35] fruit home that ain't fully
[2:21:38] ripe. Amen.
[2:21:41] Because it's easy to get to. They they
[2:21:44] call it lowhanging fruit.
[2:21:48] Low hanging fruit just real easy. I just
[2:21:50] pull that out. I don't need no rock. I
[2:21:52] don't need no ball. Just walk up and
[2:21:53] yank it off. But you want some real good
[2:21:55] fruit, get the one at the top where the
[2:21:57] sun is hitting it. And I'm going tell
[2:21:59] you to get to the top of the tree, the
[2:22:01] fruit that's up there, you got to be you
[2:22:03] got to know how to navigate. That's
[2:22:05] right, brother. Amen. Now, when we when
[2:22:07] we was young, mama wanted the fruit
[2:22:09] sometime from the top of the tree. When
[2:22:10] we was young, it was no rock or bottle
[2:22:13] going up to get them
[2:22:17] fruit. We had to climb that tree. No,
[2:22:19] not that one. And it's it's getting
[2:22:21] high. I don't want to fall out the tree,
[2:22:24] son. You up there now. You might as well
[2:22:28] stay on up there. Get the fruit right
[2:22:30] there.
[2:22:32] Hallelujah. We had to know how to
[2:22:34] navigate, get through them lens, and
[2:22:35] work our way back down. Come on,
[2:22:38] somebody. Man, we were fruit pickers.
[2:22:42] Amen. It's something about getting fruit
[2:22:45] at the top of the tree.
[2:22:48] Look at this. Now watch what Brother
[2:22:49] Brandham says. It says, "But then right
[2:22:52] in the top of the tree is where the
[2:22:53] fruit ripens
[2:22:54] first." That's right. Right in the top
[2:22:57] of the tree. So it's the top of the tree
[2:23:00] here that se that that sees the evening
[2:23:04] light. And I'm coming to a close. This
[2:23:06] is the last paragraph. Now Noah had
[2:23:09] three rooms in the ark. Three is a
[2:23:13] number of life. Noah had three rooms in
[2:23:17] the ark. One room was for the creeping
[2:23:20] things. See? And the second room was for
[2:23:25] the files. So these things that were
[2:23:26] flying.
[2:23:28] Right? But the top room was where the
[2:23:31] light was. So in in order for Noah to
[2:23:35] know that the the rain had stopped, he
[2:23:37] had to
[2:23:38] dwell in the top room.
[2:23:42] I can't dwell amongst the creeping
[2:23:43] things.
[2:23:45] Hello, somebody. I came here with all
[2:23:47] this creeping stuff and and and actually
[2:23:50] the creeping things let out some foul
[2:23:52] stuff. You really don't want to dwell
[2:23:54] down there. Right? You're going to be
[2:23:55] doing a lot of clean up of a lot of mess
[2:23:57] up
[2:23:59] and and the foul of the air. You got you
[2:24:01] can't dwell in that area either. Right.
[2:24:02] He said he got to get to the top where
[2:24:04] you can see light.
[2:24:09] But on the top floor, he says the light,
[2:24:12] he says the second room is for the
[2:24:13] files, but but the top room was where
[2:24:15] the light was. The light that shined
[2:24:18] first never come on the first floor, the
[2:24:21] second floor, but the light came through
[2:24:24] on the top
[2:24:26] floor. The tree don't bear its fruit at
[2:24:28] the bottom. Second, like that, it was
[2:24:31] all pruned off in
[2:24:33] organization, but it's in the top part
[2:24:38] where I will restore. Uhoh. So what we
[2:24:41] just heard there is the restoration
[2:24:44] happens not on the bottom floor,
[2:24:47] not on the second floor, but if you want
[2:24:49] to experience resurrection, I mean, and
[2:24:51] restoration, you got to be dwelling on
[2:24:54] the top floor.
[2:24:58] But it's in the top where I will
[2:25:02] restore, sayeth the Lord, I'll send
[2:25:04] forth the evening light. It'll bring
[2:25:06] back bring back the word making it
[2:25:09] manifest. I will restore all that I
[2:25:12] promise and that I promise the same Holy
[2:25:16] Spirit will
[2:25:18] bring bear the same signs. I love this.
[2:25:21] I will have an Easter. This is God
[2:25:24] himself saying it. How God going to have
[2:25:26] an Easter? Because God promised that I
[2:25:28] will restore. So since God said it, God
[2:25:30] got to make it come to pass. Oh, you
[2:25:33] don't know why you are where you are.
[2:25:35] It's because a resurrection was taking
[2:25:37] place on the inside of you. Lord Jesus.
[2:25:41] Hallelujah. Oh my my my my. Okay, it
[2:25:44] told me that I got to
[2:25:45] stop. I'm stopping. I I promise. There
[2:25:49] we
[2:25:51] go. This is it. I'll have an Easter, a
[2:25:55] resurrection for the bride, the same as
[2:25:57] I had for the bridegroom. See, evening
[2:26:00] lights come out to shine. Same as in the
[2:26:02] morning. Same signs, same things, the
[2:26:05] same light will produce the same fruit
[2:26:06] that they had there. If it's a shining
[2:26:09] on the same tree, see, amen proves his
[2:26:12] word now fulfilled. I will restore,
[2:26:16] saith the
[2:26:17] Lord. The restoration takes
[2:26:20] place in that third
[2:26:23] day. Just as we read there in the book
[2:26:26] of Revelation chapter 3, because three
[2:26:28] represents life and and there in
[2:26:31] Revelation 3, it the restoration did not
[2:26:33] happen in the days of Luther. The
[2:26:35] resurrection did not happen in the days
[2:26:37] of uh Wesley, but that resurrection
[2:26:40] restoration took place in the third day
[2:26:43] after the ministry of William Brandham.
[2:26:46] How we thank God that he has called us
[2:26:48] to a resurrection and there has been a
[2:26:52] resurrection for the bride.
[2:26:55] God bless you church. God bless you
[2:26:59] [Applause]
[2:27:01] church. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:27:04] Uh I'm I'm going to have a word of
[2:27:06] prayer. And um I also forgot to mention
[2:27:09] this earlier. Um th this typically as I
[2:27:15] was saying on Friday night sometimes
[2:27:19] uh I'm away at Easter time and and
[2:27:22] typically I I don't like to go places at
[2:27:24] Easter because I like being home. I just
[2:27:26] like being with the saints, you know, at
[2:27:28] Easter. But sometimes there is a pull
[2:27:31] and uh and you end up having to just
[2:27:33] find the mind of Christ to do what you
[2:27:36] can for the kingdom of God. And uh but
[2:27:38] this Easter I was so happy that it
[2:27:40] worked out that I was home, you know. So
[2:27:42] we had our Good Friday service and it
[2:27:44] really was a Good Friday service. And uh
[2:27:47] and then this morning and uh so this
[2:27:50] year um church you are aware I've shared
[2:27:53] with you just some of the things that I
[2:27:54] have going on in my own personal life.
[2:27:56] Uh, so my travel is is a little limited
[2:27:59] to some of these personal things that
[2:28:01] that that that I'm doing. Uh, a as it
[2:28:04] stands, I only have one
[2:28:07] um one overseas trip planned for this
[2:28:10] year. One overseas trip planned. And and
[2:28:13] I remember uh sister uh Zelman saying,
[2:28:17] "Lord, just bless me with everything."
[2:28:19] Uh because she said, "When the church go
[2:28:21] to London, I'm going to London."
[2:28:24] And when I heard her say that, I said,
[2:28:25] "Oh Lord, I ain't got plans to go to
[2:28:26] London this year." But but she wanted to
[2:28:29] go, you know. But this year, I just
[2:28:30] wanted to mention to you that I have one
[2:28:32] over overseas trip planned, and that is
[2:28:34] a trip to Australia uh in the month of
[2:28:38] October. So, Sister Virginia has been
[2:28:41] working on um just kind of getting some
[2:28:43] of the pricing for tickets and things of
[2:28:45] that nature. We're still working out
[2:28:46] some of the details, but we want to just
[2:28:49] find out if uh those that would be
[2:28:51] interested in going, she's working on
[2:28:53] trying to get group rates for everybody.
[2:28:55] If you're interested, make sure you just
[2:28:57] see her, put your name on the list and
[2:28:58] say, "Yeah, please count on saying we
[2:29:00] want to be a part of that trip to
[2:29:02] Australia. Uh and that's going to be in
[2:29:04] in October." So, that's the only thing
[2:29:06] that I got. Everything else going to be
[2:29:07] local. We got to prepare for our
[2:29:10] meetings here. And uh you know, and and
[2:29:12] we'll just see what the Lord has, you
[2:29:14] know, uh in in the future. But we are I
[2:29:16] I'm just I'm happy to be home. I'm so
[2:29:18] happy. I'm so
[2:29:20] happy. Amen. Amen. Praise God. So, let's
[2:29:25] just have a word of prayer and I turn
[2:29:26] the service over to brother uh Solomon.
[2:29:28] I wish you all a happy Easter. Amen.
[2:29:31] Again, Father, we thank you for your
[2:29:35] uh your word. Thank you Jesus that you
[2:29:39] could just show us who we are. Father in
[2:29:43] the
[2:29:45] scripture your prophet made a statement
[2:29:47] that yes you will have a
[2:29:50] resurrection a Easter. You have an
[2:29:52] Easter for your bride. A resurrection
[2:29:55] for the bride just as you had one for
[2:29:58] the
[2:29:59] bridegroom. Lord we can look back and
[2:30:02] see what you did in the life of Christ.
[2:30:06] You walked the face of this earth, Lord,
[2:30:08] in that body. And you told them, "No man
[2:30:11] take my life. I lay it down." And you
[2:30:13] had power to lay it down in power to
[2:30:16] pick it up again. And you did exactly
[2:30:17] what you said. But oh
[2:30:20] God, just as you would sacrifice
[2:30:22] yourself and go to that cross, there's
[2:30:24] another Calvary that needs to take
[2:30:26] place. And that's it. That's the one for
[2:30:27] us where we're willing to give up,
[2:30:30] Father, the things of this world. And
[2:30:33] Lord realize that the life that we live
[2:30:35] for you is much greater than anything
[2:30:37] Satan could offer us. So Lord help us
[2:30:40] father to have that Calvary that Lord
[2:30:42] once we have that Calvary we can also
[2:30:44] experience a personal
[2:30:47] resurrection. Lord we love you and we
[2:30:51] praise and we thank you for all that you
[2:30:53] have done. We praise you and we thank
[2:30:55] you for all that you will do and we
[2:30:57] praise and we thank you for all that
[2:30:59] you're doing right now. It's in Jesus
[2:31:02] name that we pray.
[2:31:05] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Happy Easter
[2:31:09] to you church. Brother Solomon, I'll
[2:31:10] give the service to you. Amen. Let's

[2:36:44] Father, to bathe in your presence, to
[2:36:47] hear your word, Lord, and see, Lord
[2:36:50] Jesus, how you purposely put us in this
[2:36:53] hour, Lord Jesus, that at the end of the
[2:36:57] third day, Lord Jesus, life would come
[2:37:01] forth. Lord, you place your bride at the
[2:37:04] end of the third day that we might
[2:37:06] manifest the remainder of your ministry,
[2:37:09] Lord Jesus.
[2:37:11] Lord, we say whatever you're doing in
[2:37:13] this season, don't do it without us.
[2:37:15] Lord, we want to be surrendered vessels
[2:37:18] in your hands, Lord Jesus. Lord, you
[2:37:21] would whisper things to your bride that
[2:37:23] you wouldn't whisper to the
[2:37:25] denominations, Lord Jesus. You would
[2:37:27] tell us your
[2:37:29] secrets. Father, you would take a
[2:37:31] prophet to the backside of your mind and
[2:37:33] reveal to us your
[2:37:35] three-fold mystery plan, Lord Jesus.

[2:37:55] these people,
[2:37:57] Lord. Father, bless them this Easter
[2:38:00] day, Lord Jesus. Each one with their own
[2:38:03] personal

[2:38:06] our
[2:38:07] pastor. Thank you for using him, Lord.
[2:38:10] Thank you for loving him and loving us,
[2:38:12] Lord. That you would give us a word like
[2:38:13] you did
[2:38:14] today. Father, bless him. Give him
[2:38:17] strength, Lord, hundfold for what he has
[2:38:20] put out. Bless this people, Lord, as we
[2:38:23] prepare to leave this place. May you go
[2:38:25] before us and make our way prosperous.

[2:38:30] Lord, renewed in strength. We love you,
