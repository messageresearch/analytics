that i needed to make mention while we're doing that just actually get your bibles and we'll prepare to go into the word of the lord on today uh praise god amen um outside i'll have a card sister brown st augustine is turning 90 years old and um so from the church i figured we would just send a card just everyone have it outside after service if you just write a little note there to her and man just something to encourage her just to wish her happy birthday i greatly appreciate that we want to do that for her i also forgot to mention on last week that in our pantry we had last month we served 739 people and grateful that god gave us the opportunity to do that and i was mentioning on wednesday night that we wanted to see if we could try to bless the families that are coming to the pantry to get food we want to bless them with turkeys for thanksgiving and um so we're just asking everyone like rather than do the gift cards that we typically do for um for christmas we like to try to do something for the these families at thanksgiving so if you would like to just give a little something one of these envelopes that we have sitting on the table we ask that you just if you could just uh cash only uh just take one of these envelopes not on the tithe and offer them one of these and just right on that pantry and uh and our goal is just to try to bless every family with a turkey we have roughly about 45 50 families that kind of come through on a weekly basis and we want to just be a blessing to them if we could so if you desire to do that just put it there we'll make sure it gets to the proper hands and we'll just be a blessing amen to these families in whatever way we can so i certainly appreciate that the lord bless you thank you musicians amen i appreciate you all thank you sister sarah for the special and uh uh brother solomon and leadness and worship amen just so so good to see everybody in the house of god amen amen praise the lord good to see sister ruth amen praise god amen amen praise god uh so um um uh i want to read amen um scripture we will go back to the book of john and we will read from there we are carrying uh forward in our thought from last week and what we spoke um on vindicated truths and um there uh in all honesty i have a uh i have probably uh today's sermon and next week's sermon will probably still stay in the same channel and uh and and i was pushing to preach next week's sermon but the holy spirit i want you to just deal with this part today so i don't know why he wanted me to do it but i i've learned to be obedient i learned not to wrestle uh with god right even if what i say is only for one person then that is for the glory of god amen not not for the glory of jack duff amen so i'll just submit myself to him and allow him to be glorified here today but we we want to read here let's start at verse 19 in uh john chapter one praise god amen john chapter one we'll start at verse 19. um amen praise the lord says um and this is the record of john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him who art thou and he confessed and denied not but confess i am not the christ amen so john was very very uh specific in that now if you all know the um i mean we know scripture and we know that um as uh uh john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming uh then uh there'd be another spirit of elijah to come to forerun the second coming and uh and also in knowing that uh it's uh the spirit of elijah is uh used in such a powerful way that uh unfortunately are people that get confused along the journey and uh and they begin to think that uh man this could be christ right uh there were people that got brother branham confused like that and when when when they got it confused uh with brother branham uh being in a certain certain position it caused the prophet to come to the pulpit and say i'm coming off the field right so uh so when we when we see things like this happen amen in the prophet's ministry all we got to do is go back to the scripture and see that it's already happened before amen so and and i can i'll just be honest with you brother branham say there is a spirit that actually comes into the land to cause people to do what they do come on church now see i'm the problem with the spirit is that you can see it with your natural eye sometimes you can't even feel it right but but but but with a spirit a man is only uh expressed through manifestation right so that that's when we know it's a spirit based on what it manifests all right all right right so so uh he says uh it says this and scripture says and he confessed and uh do not not but confess i am not the christ and they asked him what then art thou elijah and he says i am not art thou that prophet now see um now he's not lying when he say he's not elijah he's not elijah but he is john with the spirit of elijah you understand he's not elijah but he is john with the spirit of elijah right and so so then they asked the question art thou that prophet and the prophet that they're referring to is the one that john said i mean moses said the lord thy god shall raise up unto your prophet like unto me so they're asking john the baptist these things that says i am not art thou that prophet and he answered no glory to god and he says um then said they unto him who art thou they couldn't be satisfied with these mysterious answers right who art thou that we may give and answer to them that sent us what sayest doubt of thyself glory to god i like that it says he said i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness makes straight the way of the lord uh as said the prophet isaiah so he he identifies himself in the word of god and it says um and they which were sent were of the pharisees and they asked him and said unto him why baptizes thou then if thou be not that christ nor elijah neither that prophet now so they were looking for some things but they weren't looking for all things because john just identified who spoke of him he just told him it's in the words it's right here in scripture isaiah spoke this go back and look at it but they're not even concerned about it oh my think about it now says um uh john answered them saying i baptized with water but there standeth one among you whom ye know not here it is who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoes latches i am not worthy to unloose say these things were done in beth beth arbor beyond jordan where john was baptized and the next day john see of jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore am i come baptizing with water and john bear record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it evolved upon him and i knew him not uh but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on uh remaining on him the same is he which baptizes with the holy ghost and i saw and bear record that this is the son of god all right we will stop our reading there we will bow in a brief word of prayer uh and um let the lord just carry us here this morning lord we thank you for the privilege that we have to stand in your presence it's um we don't take it lightly that we come to church uh there's uh we realize just through our study on wednesday nights through the book of ephesians that you actually had to go to a cross and die in order for us to be able to come to church and and lord we're grateful for that so we don't take this this lightly but we also know according to prophecy there is going to come a day where we will not be allowed to walk through the church doors and god your prophet has told us that they'll put padlocks on the doors and so we need to take advantage of the time that we do have and and my prayer is that uh lord we can get ourselves out of the way that you could speak uh i know that you have grabbed the attention of the people you've allowed certain things to occur uh so people uh interests are picking up but lord uh i pray that it'll go deeper uh than an election lord i pray that uh people would really get their hearts right with you i i pray that lord folk would really draw not not just to know what the prophet said amen but to know jesus god we need relationship with the lord jesus uh and god my prayers that while you got the people's attention do something special for the people anchor them uh in the faith anchor them in amen in an experience so send father uh the ring into this place today father we just invite you to come and take complete control of this service be glorified and magnified and exalted in this place in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated we will continue our journey in vindicated truths this is part two and like i said i believe that there will be a third part to this uh particular sermon and um now in order for me to be obedient to what the the lord said for me to do i'm gonna have to do my best to avoid saying some things praise the lord because if i if i started down a particular channel today i already know which way we would end up going amen but i want to be obedient so i'm going gonna do all i can initially just to avoid saying some things uh this is greater what we're what we're dealing with is a lot greater than what you see praise the lord it's what we're dealing with is a lot greater than what you see amen and and and i don't want us to be um uh twin tower christians praise the lord amen twin tower church members you understand we don't want to be like that you know walmart ran out of bibles to sell when the towers went down you understand right and and so if you're a believer amen the things that you're seeing uh you read in the paper 87 years ago all right let me read this quote i'll come back to that in a little bit okay so here um i want to read from this quote what shall we do with jesus call christ what shall we do with jesus call christ uh the prophet makes these statements he says um you may say to me brother uh brother branham you got the wrong interpretation of it brother branham you got the wrong interpretation of it and uh he says well that's that's to your opinion amen amen glory to god that's your opinion god don't need any interpreter right amen god is his own interpreter so that's what the trouble of it is today we got too many man-made interpreters god can interpret i like that amen uh he says uh god can interpret himself his own vindication of his word is the interpretation i want to say that again his own vindication of his word is the interpretation amen the pharisees might have cried out too we got the interpretation the sadducees says we got him but jesus was the interpretation amen glory to god the manifestation of god's revealed power promised is the vindication i'ma say it again the manifestation of god's revealed power promised is the vindication says read the scriptures and see what the church is supposed to be today yes sir god don't need any interpreter that's what they've done to jesus they found out back there that that though he didn't have the interpretation he was the interpretation god didn't have to interpret it jesus's life interpreted he said search the scriptures from them you think you have eternal life they are they that testify of me and if i do not the works of my father then believe me not if the works that was spoken this day don't manifest itself in me he said then don't believe it now you know as we talk about these uh vindicated truths uh you know i want to just put a little emphasis on the lord jesus you know people had a problem uh you know we just read in the scripture we just read it uh here they come to john and they're asking now are you that prophet they was expecting the messiah they were looking for i mean for them to even ask the question they knew that the time of messiah to come must have been at hand hallelujah amen because the reason i can say is because they they're referring to particular scriptures they are under expectation for these scriptures to be manifested and when they see john do what he's doing now john never worked one miracle john john john ministry was so powerful yet never worked one miracle these people got confused saying are you that christ are you the one are you that prophet you know i mean you got all the all these people coming to your meetings but are you the one just saying no i'm not him i'm not him they were looking for it and john told say now the one you're looking for good god almighty the one you're looking for is standing amongst you right now they're looking forward and oh hallelujah church what amen i want to ask you what are you looking for this morning hallelujah because the one they were looking for was standing amongst them right then and uh and john's saying now now i know how to identify him when i see him glory there's certain things gonna happen when he comes down here to the water to be baptized and i'm going to be able to identify him when i see him because the same one that sent me gave me some information to be able to identify him when it comes so after john tells them amen on this disservice he says the one that you're looking for stand amongst you the bible say the very next day jesus comes walking into church i want to tell you something about jesus he loves going to church hallelujah he went to john's church amen and and and in their scripture where where the bible talks about how it was accustomed it was a custom for him to go to church and if it was customary for the lord jesus christ to go to church what you think about us amen all right they were looking for it they were expecting it amen and here he comes walking up uh fulfilling the very thing that they were looking for but because it didn't come the way that they wanted it to come they missed it all right let's keep going in this quote i don't need nobody a man trying to interpret he interprets himself when when he fulfills it he's interpreting the word himself now look at this amen uh uh uh paragraph 85 says did they did they do it god said a virgin shall conceive this was prophesied of the lord jesus a virgin shall conceive and she did do you believe it certainly but they didn't right we believe it but they didn't even though the bible declared that it was supposed to happen these religious leaders did not believe the bible that they were carrying all right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god now he says it says certainly but they didn't a virgin shall conceive and she did it said the lame shall walk the blind shall see when what would take place it proved they would do it and jesus was the manifestation right moses said the lord your god shall raise up a prophet like unto me the word comes to the prophet and the prophet the word is a discerner of the thoughts of the heart when they see him doing that discernment they said this is beelzebub a fortune teller that's no more than a name they pin on him the same thing today called a holy roll or something like that that's right he said he needs no interpretation he was the interpretation god proved it by himself who is that sinful man today or who is that sinful man then that would deny that the word wasn't interpreted now i can ask the same question right now who is the sinful man who is the sinful woman that will deny that the word is not interpreted amen and the way that god interprets his word is by manifesting it amen the manifestation is the interpretation all right glory to god the manifestation is the interpretation when you got a manifestation you don't have to argue with anybody amen you don't actually you don't even have to prove anything the manifestation proves it you know what believers do that's all we do believe amen we don't have to explain nothing to nobody we simply believe amen hallelujah all right let me go on uh he says uh he needs no interpretation he wants the interpretation god proved it by himself who is that sinful man today or who was that sinful man then that would deny that the word wasn't interpreted jesus asked them said search the scriptures they testify who i am they are the interpretation if my life doesn't interpret what i'm talking about then don't believe me he says what sinful man could be there could there be today that could look in the face of the bible and see if the holy spirit isn't the interpreter of the word today making himself known by manifestations of promises of the uh of the gifts and things that he promised to do in that day in this day malachi 4 being fulfilled all the rest of the scriptures being fulfilled and see it right here at the end of the time you don't need any man to interpret it no sir it interprets itself it proves it's the message of the hour repent that's it right there repent and turn to god hallelujah all the world you churches repent and turn to god don't try to wash them from your hands cause you can't do it the issue is right on now as it was then he said search the scriptures they testified me jesus said my works are my interpreter now i feel you know if jesus said search the scriptures i felt that it would be important for us maybe just to go back and just look at a couple of scriptures you know jesus himself was the interpretation amen or the manifestation or even the vindication of what god had wrote in his word now let's just go back and just search a few scriptures hallelujah john 5 39 is where we get this statement from jesus it says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me this is where jesus tells us that in john 5 39 so let's go back and search a scripture genesis 3 15 hallelujah glory says search it they have day that testify of me glory let's look at genesis 3 15. the bible says and i will put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now when we just look at that scripture we realize that a man according to the anatomy of the body a woman does not carry the seed the woman carries the egg hallelujah but here is a prophecy by god himself amen that i'm gonna put enmity between thee and the woman between thy sea and her seed so when jesus comes on the scene amen as the virgin born son of the living god he was fulfilling this prophecy in scripture hallelujah they called him amen every other name but the fulfillment of the word of god hallelujah amen here's another scripture isaiah 7 and 14 amen isaiah 7 14 glory the bible says therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel so here when mary shows up pregnant not married to joseph amen they're they're spot i mean their spouse they're engaged to be married but here mary shows up with amen with this pregnancy and and the people just begin to criticize what was going on there hallelujah but failing to recognize that it was the fulfillment of scripture hallelujah amen today they they they're criticizing this message that we believe today they they criticize you for staying with the message hallelujah but they failed to see that this message was spoken of in scripture hallelujah we don't have to vindicate it god has already vindicated and i'm telling you there's many vindicated truths laying right here in the message the reason some of y'all are in church today is because you have recognized another vindicated truth amen hallelujah glory glory glory i'll tell you something about prophecy amen the wheels of prophecy turn really slow but they turn all right amen hallelujah the wheels of prophecy turn really slow brother adam come out in 1933 and begin to give us a prophecy glory to god in 87 years later the prophecy is manifested and you you happen to be in the generation that saw it fulfilled amen if we if we can see six of seven things already fulfilled amen huh i want to tell you the sabbath is the worst one glory to god the sabbath the seventh one talks about destruction all over the usa come on somebody so if all the other six have been fulfilled we ought to get ready for that seventh one and i can tell you right now when that hits we better be ready to go i preached it a few weeks ago you got to be in the shuttle you can't be coming to the shuttle you got to be in the shuttle ready for the countdown oh hallelujah in in houston or or cape canaveral they saying t minus and t minus t minus ten t minus nine t minus eight t minus seven all the way down till they get the one when it hits zero it's it releases and and that thing takes off to go through the sky we're not doing any minuses it's plus because god does not subtract he adds god does not divide but he multiplies glory to god we watch them in ephesus we watch them through amen uh uh uh smyrna and pergamus and thigh tears scientists philadelphia but we are not leons praise god we are the pride amen we find ourselves inside the ship ready to go praise god when god is ready to call we ready to go all right look at this numbers 24 17. here's another one we see the lord jesus spoken of here in scripture go back and search the scriptures you'll see amen in them you think you have eternal life but the scripture is what testifies to me oh lord i i just this is i have to always go back to this the reason i believe this message is because it's in scripture that's why i believe it i'm not believing it just because of the signs wonders and miracles i believe it because i can see it in scripture i'm i'ma say it like this even if there was never another sign wonder miracle i still believe it why because i see it in scripture all right numbers 24 17 i shall see him but not now i shall behold him but not nigh there shall come a star out of jacob and a scepter shall rise out of israel and shall smite the corners of moab and destroy all the children of seth now you know that that step is capitalized it's speaking of a person that's coming and now back in the in uh in the days where they had the kings uh you all remember the story of esther esther could not approach the king unless the king amen put out his scepter oh hallelujah amen esther realized that if i go when the king does not give me a scepter i'm good as dead but uh but but mordeca i mean her uh her uncle mordecai began testing out esther amen i know you might be afraid but maybe amen it's a possibility that god brought you into this place oh hallelujah for such a time as this hey hallelujah church maybe this is an opportunity for you to start witnessing with everything that you know and everything that you've seen maybe this is an opportunity for you to witness about this message maybe god has given you an open open door to share this with somebody for such a time as this you know i i i was thinking to myself i said you know if uh somebody you know want to join a conversation with me about you know what has just happened in our country and and how exciting it must be for certain things i hope you can read between the lines how exciting it must be for certain things i began to think to myself you know i i think i should ask them say you believe the bible what about prophets do you realize that before this even happened there was you know there was a prophecy that was stated even 87 years ago seven things that were gonna happen before jesus returned oh glory to god see there's an open door glory to god there's an open door for you to share truth with somebody if you just open your mouth and do so can i ask you a ques can i just i'm not a question i'm gonna make a statement be spiritual don't be carnal be spiritual all right right so so the scepter had to be offered to esther in order for her to be able to approach the king and he had she not received the scepter she would have been good as dead now before we can approach god amen the scepter had to be offered which was christ when he died on the cross the scepter was being offered now we have an opportunity to go right into the presence of almighty god thank god that he was that scepter jesus was vindicated signs wonders miracles his birth was was spoken of in scripture his life was spoken of in scripture so many things this is why i told the leaders of that day just just search the scriptures if you you got a problem with me amen that's one thing but just search the scriptures because if i'm fulfilling what the scripture is saying i'm under fulfilled then you got to take that up with god amen hallelujah many people might have a problem with brother branham but if he fulfilled what the scripture said he was supposed to fulfill then you got to take that up with god amen all right now look at this i was just thinking on this jesus was vindicated and that word vindication means to clear of all suspicion all suspicion at his birth angels came to sing amen and provide a direction to the shepherds as to where they could find the christ and angels amen uh the angel scene was extra identifying that royalty had been born oh hallelujah because in those days when a king was born the people would sing but god didn't just have people singing god had angels singing identifying royalty had been born glory to god the three magi that came a couple years uh after jesus was on the earth they brought their gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh and each one of these gifts identified a uh uh uh something about the lord jesus amen the goal identified his deity amen the frankincense identified his service and the myrrh identified the anointing for death and what brother branham tells us that jesus was deity in service to die glory glory glory the works testified of him when he fed 5 000 that testified who he was what matter of man is this when he fed 4 000 that testified who he was glory to god amen when he turned the water into wine that testified who he was god didn't need nobody else to try to interpret the manifestation amen what's the interpretation amen glory to god a man amen all the doubt should have been settled when they experienced these things amen that that that all the suspicion should have been gone when the people experienced these things if i can just go a little ahead of myself your suspicion should be gone by now if the message is right or if the message is wrong hallelujah you shouldn't have no more suspicion you are living in vindicated truth hallelujah somebody i'm not i'm not talk about coming here to get head knowledge i can read quotes to you but i want to go beyond your head knowledge this ought to touch something inside your soul cause you don't want to live right cause you want to walk right and talk right praise god get yourself back on the word of god amen oh hallelujah forgive me for being so animated how can i how many uh how can i not be animated at a time like this how can i not brother brandon you say you see you see a a a a a person headed towards the false right you standing on the bank and you see him in a wrath out there on on on on life's ocean just headed towards a falls they can't see in front of them but you see it coming he said he said now what kind of friend would you be if you standing up on the on the shore saying uh get out the boat get out the boat they came what what get out of the boat i told them to get out of the boat no you ain't saying nothing if you're really concerned you got get out the boat get out the boat you're gonna yell and scream you're gonna get animated you the reason you get animated is because you care they say the system just go crazy when i preach it it'd be it'd be like this and then they say i mean they have to buy special equipment for me in order to try to uh get to get it to harmonize because i start yelling and screaming and things just start peeking like crazy that's just i'm animated amen god made me that way i mean the reason you're here glory to god is because we're we're you you've seen the vindicated truth and it's just something how we kind of remember what the prophet said i'ma tell you one of these days it's gonna be too late to remember y'all didn't get it it's going to be too late to remember why not why not live under expectation now rather than waiting because one day you're going to call and they're not going to be no answer one day you're gonna come trying to get into the church and we can't we can't open it up so you better take advantage of the moments that you have now all right church go ready god amen amen when when there's a new article just went out sharks sharks near los angeles sharks right amen right and we already know what a prophet said he said he said los angeles going underneath the water yes hallelujah you thank you cena pandemic amen praise the lord god is a master chess chess man all right and chess you just don't just make moves you better know what it's got to be calculated there's an objective here so when i put this here something can really happen right i i sir actually what he has to do i got to put a certain president in office he has to have a certain disposition because his disposition will make the people put themselves in another condition they're gonna get so mad they're gonna get so upset that they're gonna go to the polls and make my prophecy come to pass [Applause] amen and and then call it that i'm i'm voting for the lesser yeah actually i ain't voting for evil [Applause] that's right but i want to take the lesser to i ain't taking evil but this is our mindset right i got the lesser two evils then you know you get a little happy because of certain things if you can read between the lies and don't realize you just fulfill scripture amen just walk right into a prophecy and like i say you shouldn't have no more questions about this message amen with your eyes seeing it first hand and some people hand welcomed it i'm keep preaching jesus was vindicated when he fed five thousand and four thousand when he turned water into wine all these manifestations were vindications of who he was right when he uh when he when the sick were healed amen by a word glory to god i i i i always love the story of the uh the centurion amen that sent uh a sermon he said i'm not even worthy that this man should come to my house now here's a centurion a a leader in a man in the roman army but yet he has enough respect he has enough revelation he has enough understanding that if i want something to change with my servant i don't tried the doctors and they can't do them no good they actually sent him home to die but i love this man so much that i don't want to see him die like that he said could you please go to jesus he's saying now i'm not worthy to go into his presence but if you could go on my behalf and and just talk to him and see if he would come and heal the servant so the man didn't know whether jesus would accept this amen invitation or not but i want you to know jesus goes wherever he is invited hallelujah somebody that's glory to god he goes wherever he's invited glory to god he went to simon's house when he was invited amen he came to the centurion's house when he was invited he will come to your house if you'll invite them here jesus gets the request from these the the the servants um uh uh uh you know his uh his servant i mean it's this leader's servants he gets the request and he says you know what i'll come and i'll heal him so as they as this man sees this great crowd approaching the house he knew it must have been jesus they must have talked him into coming to to to do something about the situation and the man said man got up out of his house and i i i'm not worthy that he'd come and say let me just stop him before he get here and he said jesus you know uh i'm a man of authority and i tell this one to come and he comes i tell this one to go and he goes not a man could say that because he had just sent people to jesus he told them to go and they went he said i tell something to come and they come i tell this one to go and they go i tell this will do that do this and they do it he said jesus the same way i have that authority you have authority over sickness and and i'm not worthy that you come underneath my roof but if you could just speak the words if you could just speak the word my servant will be made whole jesus marveled at this he said what kind of faith this kind of faith i'm looking for in israel but i'm finding this kind of faith amongst gentiles say man go find it the exact way that you just requested it jesus never went to the man's house just spoke the word and the servant was made whole right then god i'm looking for some people to be made whole and i know it's going to take the word to make them whole see he was vindicated in that man's eyes he was vindicated the dead were raised when lazarus got about the grave that that should have vindicated who jesus was it should have settled all the questions glory to god it should it should have cleared all the suspicion amen when the when the death had their hearing restored amen when blinded eyes were open it should have cleared all suspicion i remember amen the the the one man that was blind from birth hallelujah amen and and uh uh you know he's blind and jesus comes by and uh and he heals the man and and uh and the man didn't even realize who it was that brought healing to him so uh you know they uh i'm sorry that's that's a different story say that this man this man uh was jesus identified himself and and the man uh was called before the council they say now tell us your story tell us your testimony what happened say well i was this way and i was that way but jesus came by and he healed me now this man jesus is is a devil he said now that's what you call him my god that's what y'all call them hallelujah amen see see the question is coming around again what says thou of him what do you say about him hallelujah glory to god i don't care what google say about them do you realize google is a bunch of people just putting stuff out there whatever they feel my confidence is not in what google say if you gonna do some searching search the scriptures search the scripture if you're going to do some searching right here here here here here they standing there and uh the man said that's what you say about it say but all i can say i was blind but now i see they didn't want to take it still here the vindication is standing right before they still didn't want to believe it so they said go get your parents we don't they say we even doubt you were blind go get your mom and daddy we want them to testify is this your son yes was he blind since birth yes you you standing on the same side he said no he can explain for himself i ain't got nothing to do with that i can just say he was blind he is my son but that's as far as i go this word will cause a separation when you're standing for this word oh lord family members might not want nothing to do with you when you're standing for this word your friends may not want anything to do with you but i encourage you to keep standing anyway hallelujah amen this is your son yes it's the person yes say was he blind yes he was blind say but but as far as his belief you guys have talked to him about his belief the man just began to rebuke him and say now you know it's kind of funny all the guys that's been studying scripture y'all been searching scriptures y'all should have known this man was coming didn't the bible say these things was supposed to happen and they said now who are you to teach us hallelujah see the the manifestations were the vindication of who christ was the manifestations in his life the people that were healed the the the uh the the deaf hearing the blind seeing the feeling of fact all these miracles they were the manifest they were vindicating who christ was i want to go a little further when we look at uh the river jordan where john saw the spirit descend from heaven and abide on jesus and in john's mind this was the vindication amen of who christ was he said there's one standing amongst you amen whose shoes i'm not even worthy to lose when john saw the spirit come and abide he said this has got to be the one this is the one this is the one this is the one but now let's just pick him up i i told you all this on last week oh my good god almighty i want to pick him up in uh matthew 11. let's pick up john glory to god i just mentioned it amen uh last week but i want to read it today if we can now john it was vindicated to him and and and i said this said this amen last week and i'mma say it again today well what what caused john's eagle eye to get filmed over because that's what brother branham says eagle eye got filmed over right he was i mean it was clear the one that you see the spirit rested on and abide that's the one now look god don't have to vindicate no more to john vindicated it once i told you who he was right you testified of it john now now what caused john's eagle eye to get filmed over the reason he got filmed over is because of the trials of his own life i i need you to see it the reason many of us are in the conditions that we're in is how we approach the trial i want you to understand something you can't run from your tribe come on you might as well be like david don't run from goliath but run to goliath and when you facing goliath pull out a stone do you realize what the stone represents the stone is your revelation hallelujah were you standing on a revelation of the word of god the gates of hell [Applause] the gates of hell will not prevail it may look like it it may feel like it but thus says the lord the gates of hell will not prevail man i feel like telling that to the devil i say that i see what you're doing i see you doing this i see you doing that you trying to mess up this life and you're trying to mess up that life but thus sayeth the lord the gates of hell shall not prevail [Applause] [Music] praise his holy name church glory to god we gotta know where we stand at in this hour we're standing on the words we're standing on the words you can't take my family you can't take my son you can't take my daughter you can't take them praise god i got a promise if i was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ hey the bible declares the promise is unto me unto my children those that are far off as many as the lord our god shall come i got another promise all that the father has given me they gotta come praise god they gotta come satan lucian lacto they gotta come praise god if it takes a new president to bring him whatever it takes they gotta come hallelujah [Applause] glory to god the word and they will come [Music] hallelujah hallelujah you jesus glory to god amen i'm under expectation church i'm under expectation glory to god amen and like like like john amen was given a sign he said the one that you see the spirit rest upon and and we just saw the spirit come and rest but it don't stop there the spirit got to come rest and abide [Applause] we want the spirit of god to go home with you keep you in check when you're at home glory to god amen amen rest and abide hallelujah glory to god trying to pick up matthew 11 here glory glory glory thank you jesus thank you jesus glory hallelujah glory hallelujah [Applause] hey hallelujah church hey man on last sunday i i mentioned a man that uh in prayer the lord just told me uh they went into the gates with thanksgiving in their heart and then they elevate it and then they came into the courts with praise see not just a little thanksgiving but praise yes right both of them got to be there and then we found out on wednesday night god took us another level higher come on brother glory right a little bit higher because if we come with thanksgiving in our heart stop complaining about this and complaining about that start thanking god for the good things amen if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things what silver things are lovely and just and pure and of good report think on these things so we start thinking and getting our mind into a certain atmosphere now you know let me just work with this just a little bit i'm getting to i'm gonna get to matthew 11. some of us really have a problem amen getting into that that mindset it's hard it's hard to get yourself in that mindset of thanksgiving glory to god hey man let me try to get this devil out of here see you the devil show you you did this and the devil showed you you did that you made this mistake you made that mistake and as you start thinking like that it's hard for you to to get up in the spirit [Music] amen it's hard for you to get up amen and just just kind of try to say lord i want to just enter with thanksgiving because you come to church bombarded in your mind your mind just thinking about all these mistakes that you made hallelujah with all the mistakes that you made the devil still couldn't keep you from the truth [Applause] with all those mistakes that you made he can stop you from coming to the message of the hour [Music] brother predestination will override every mistake [Applause] and when you know that you are a seed of god god is casting every mistake into the sea of forgetfulness you gotta understand your position by the blood the blood cleanses you now the blood don't want you going out doing the same old thing all over again the blood wants you to repent make things right and then move on from there be really sorry about what you did but you you approach god right he won't leave you there and you're in that condition so he'll give you something to praise him for and if you can't find nothing but i got shoes on my feet thank him for that and i guarantee you if you find one thing to thinking for you'll find some more you'll go to the refrigerator you'll look inside the refrigerator i got food in the refrigerator thank you laurence you go back into your bedroom and get your keys off your dresser and when you pick up your keys you realize god has given you a car thank you lord when you're going open up the car realize you got a full tank of gas thank you lord come on somebody you found one thing to thank him for amen you'll find so many more but your attitude has got to be thanksgiving [Applause] and i can guarantee if you can get an attitude like that you'll come in here ready to praise you're coming here ready to worship i love the way these things are amen are going back to this what we did in the old days when the word went forth we got excited [Music] [Applause] animated [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you know hattie wright said amen to the word of god and hattie wright said it at the right time her amen change her condition your amens can change your condition glory to god glory to god some of us wonder what that happened here i i left i left and when i came back i don't know what happened all i can say to move is home and you better get into the move when the angels start troubling the water jump in praise god don't sit and watch the water gets turned up jump in the devil can't take your amen i said the devil can't take your amen hallelujah glory to god let me try to get back here to matthew 11. praise god a man amen amen [Applause] hallelujah glory glory thank you for your promises lord thank you for your promises amen amen now uh as i you know i i shared this about john and when i won't have time to read this quote but i'm gonna just tell you what the prophet said he said uh when jesus actually came to john to be baptized of him at jordan river jesus said that that i mean the prophet said there was the two most important people on the earth the two most important people on the earth was jesus himself god himself in the body of of jesus amen standing there being baptized by his prophet greater than the high priest greater than the the leader of the sadducees and pharisees or whoever they might be greater than the king amen here was the king of kings standing there identifying himself with the prophet now when jesus comes to john it actually vindicates john's ministry hallelujah and when john sees his spirit descend and abide on jesus to john jesus ministry was vindicated but the problem is when we picked this up in matthew 11 is that john went through trials after that moment can i tell you something amen we come and have a good service like this but are you expecting a trial you ought to be expecting a trial but i'm just i'm not only expecting a trap i am also expecting v-i-c-t-o-r-y [Music] [Applause] glory yeah i realize the trial gonna come but i'm also expecting to be victorious in the midst of this amen so here's john going through this trial and i want you to understand why john is is where he is john went to prison because he preached the truth one day the service was going on and and man the revival was happening glory to god mighty revival everybody in the town was going to church and the leader of that day amen uh i want to say herod i might be wrong but but the leader of that day amen uh he said i'm going to church and i'm going to take my new wife with me come on church i got a new wife and i'm bringing her to church with me amen and he brings his new wife and they come late so you come late everybody can see you but they came late and she was all dressed amen to impress and she walked inside the church and john just watched to sit down and he was preaching and he was preaching and when he saw him come through and maybe right at the time that amen uh she was getting ready to sit down in the chat he made sure before she sat down that she heard something it's not lawful for you to have her [Applause] and i can just see her let me just put this out here just for a minute so y'all can all see i i can see you come to church and maybe she looked at her husband saying are you talking to me she couldn't hear nothing the rest of the service all she heard was it's not lawful for you to have her amen all right well that was seed planted and huh see i ain't gonna let this fella preach no more i ain't going back to that church no more and he won't preach no more oh boy well there was a party to come one day come on talk about it and in this party herod just getting sloppy drunk they had a terrible lust spirit hallelujah so here this love spirit rising up in him and he has his his own daughter now that ain't that something listen yeah well actually when his daughter was his stepdaughter but still still it's your daughter right and why are you gonna have her come dance and she danced so well now you know she was twerking you know she was twerking in order for this man to say look whatever you have whatever you ask up to half my kingdom i give you right now the lust spirit has taken them over so i'll give you whatever you want well she said i don't even know that's her she went to her mama mama he just said i can get whatever i want to have for kingdom what would you want she wasn't even thinking about money she wasn't thinking about popularity see what she wants she wants she won't think about all the stuff that she can say one thing one all you want is one say i got it i know i know i know what to get action for the head of john the baptist and the platter what kind of woman would ask for something of that magnitude this is a woman with an iron disposition [Music] this is a woman that that that's kind of coming out of thigh tier right hey man this is a woman that what we would call a dominating female and as a dominating female brother branham say that's the greatest curse i'm just telling you what your prophet said he said it was the greatest curse that the world could have i could go into some things right there in your election i can tell you the meaning of some names but i'm not i'll tell you what you got to keep coming to church you want to know some things all right but here she asks for her to say just give me the head of john bel she just remembered the church service that she went into late and got embarrassed see some of us you know that's why we stopped coming to church brother jack didn't have to embarrass me like that oh you don't know your bible now i'ma tell you i i really don't embarrass you i have gone to churches yeah where your name get caught your name get called out right and i i i i'm talking about churches they still do it today amen south carolina north carolina they would call your name you think it's embarrassing i mean you ain't saying nothing hey man your condition might get called but that's just and i'm not picking on you i'm picking off you yeah hey man i told you if a man saw somebody going for the wall of waterfalls he ought to be yelling and screaming trying to get their attention that's what i want to do and you're on your way to hell amen you're on your way to hell if you died right now in hell you lift up your eyes and why be this close to heaven and go to hell amen amen i can't do nothing for you i can't i i can lead you to the water but i can't make you drink amen right but here you know this lady asked for the head of john the baptist said go go in there and tell tell tell them tell your daddy we want the head of john the baptist in a in a play after all is preaching god vindicated his ministry but you know what the reason that john had to go through that john had already said he made a statement he says i got to decrease right so that he can increase and god took him off the earth quickly went to went to prison over preaching amen all right so while john's in prison you get a little discouraged now let's pick them up in in and and uh matthew 11. i'm trying to just uh leave us here to add a little something here if i can uh says and it came to pass when jesus had made the end of commanding his twelve disciples he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ he sent two of his disciples so these fellows are visiting john in prison and and um and and and john is you know saying now i'm hearing about i'm hearing about what's going on with jesus says but uh but i want you to go and and talk to him from me now here um uh uh he gives him some instruction here in verse 3 says and said unto him uh art thou he that should come or do we look for another now again remember this john was john was told by god himself the one that you see the spirit abide on that's him so he said a prophet came to this point in his ministry that he's wondering i can i'll even put this away hey man you can go through some trials you start wondering about your calling you start wondering about it was i really called it this was did god make a mistake by letting me hear this message you start you start really wondering about you know your position am i really predestinated right your trial makes you feel that way but the devil is still a liar so so here john has this because of the trial he's in prison are you the one or should we be looking for another somebody looking for another so so here he says uh uh jesus answered and sent it to them go and show john again those things which you do here and see now what happened brother branham gives us some clear understanding here it says that these disciples came to the service where jesus was preaching and jesus said now just sit sit down and and just go through the service and at the end of the service i answer your question so here we're at the end of the service and and now and jesus say uh uh jesus answered and said unto them go and show john again those things which you do hear and see the blind received their sight and the lame walk i mean they had a mighty outpouring oh lord i forgot that i i said this early and i and it just slipped my mind but the lord just brought it back i told you we elevated we elevated right we went from just thanksgiving amen and then praise but wednesday night we elevated and brother branham told us that we can go into the pentecost of chicago so what you're feeling here this morning is a little bit we ain't even tap the surface pentecostal shekinah i'ma tell you what's gonna happen when we go to pentecost of chicago somebody gonna prophesy all right and somebody else gonna interpret and if your life ain't right it may come out so we're gonna go to a church where the prophets say i love to be in a church where sin can't hide all right so i'm gonna tell you a way that you get your you get your your stuff straight confess that way you don't have to walk in here to the pentecostal shekinah and somebody beat them reveal what they done saw right just confess actually that's how you get victory over the devil by confessing they have an old saying in old days shame the devil confess all right all right confess your faults one to another and then do what talk about them talk about them put it on instagram that ain't what the bible say confess your faults one to another and pray one for the other amen you better find somebody to know the word of god all right amen all right so i'm at verse five the blind see that sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the death here the dead are raised up the poor have the gospel preached to them and this is a bliss this is wonderful right here blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me now you know it because it's very easy to um especially you know you have to dress a certain way with this walk you gotta look a certain way but don't don't be offended in christ and what he's calling you to do all right blessed is he that's not offended in me let's go on and as they departed when jesus waited till these disciples left john's disciples left as they departed jesus began to say unto the multitudes now i want you to understand when john heard the words of jesus that the lame walk the blind see the deaf here his question was answered what answered the question was the manifestation i hope you got that what answered the question was the manifestation and what should be answering questions today is the manifestation i told you we read a newspaper 87 years ago that told us what we just saw this week was going to come to pass it was already headlines 87 years ago and the prophet even said i'm trying to read it for he even said he said i might not live to see it but you young people and many of them are seeing it saw it with their own eyes praise god i told you look look look look god is a a professional chess player he moved pieces he had there was a president that had to come before this it had to happen like that everybody i mean the whole world may i mean a guy that can just get underneath everybody's feet god designed the man like that i'ma say it again god designed the man like that amen got it's a shame before god we christians get out like that christians are all over social media fighting each it just just keeps propagating people not even looking at the scripture no more not even looking at the quotes just just propagating this stuff hate and all kind of stuff rising up right where this come christians i'ma tell you something when when when the pressure on that's when you really know who the people are someone's gonna need to learn i mean really learn how to pass right by you have to see things and not say things i'm gonna tell you you're gonna have to get control of your spirit [Music] amen holy ghost don't want you saying all that that's right i i there were so many times i hear different people say certain things and i just start yeah but i'm gonna tell you how some of y'all do y'all get the same spot i'm not but you come right back and find some other way to get it get your message across so you really didn't overcome you failed the test all right church all right but but you know it was it's strategic it's we looking at it from a totally different lens yeah and so so god has to use these pieces to get the whole world an uproar i mean even to the to not even conceding that got everybody you won't even he has a certain spirit of a certain anointing that anointing got to be there to get everybody that's driven right towards this other thing and can't y'all see this handwriting all over the wall before this announcement the pope come out and said something about same-sex marriages he was for it the the pope and what do we end up with a party that supports it with a catholic president and a woman so the prophecy double fulfilled pretty much [Applause] we're just running out there running the what i want you to know america is not my home whatever country you come from that's not your home we all come from god and we're going back to god right hey man we're citizens of another kingdom so it's time it's time to start acting like it that's right amen amen all right i i got a few more minutes i'm trying to get to just something here where where am i i don't even know what verse i'm on okay thank you okay and as they departed jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning he's preaching john's this is his eulogy so what when you out into the wilderness to see a reed shaking with the wind but what went you out for to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold they that wear soft raiment are in king's houses but what went you out for to see what you came to church for to see notice what jesus said a prophet y'all went to see a prophet yeah i say unto you and more than a prophet even though john gary loses his head brother jesus said he's more than a prophet this is vindicating john's ministry the words of jesus himself vindicates john's ministry hallelujah glory to god um and it says for this is he of whom it is written behold i send my messenger before the before thy face which shall prepare the way before thee jesus put them even back in scripture right verily i say unto you among them that are born of women there have not risen greater than john the baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he now here the disciples are standing here listening to jesus talk about john the baptist but on mount transfiguration after this tremendous experience and peter wants to build three temples and and all this other stuff and say no no no this my beloved son hear ye him say then peter asks questions now then the scribes say that elias was afraid was for was to come first before this happened say yeah and i and i said to you elias shall come and restore all things but i also say elias has come and they've done unto him exactly what was written and do you realize this after the second time now they heard it here in matthew 11. but it was only then it finally sunk in oh he talking about john the baptist john was already dead before they realized who he was some people didn't realize yeah brother branham's come and gone before they realize who he is now you know jesus said this verily i say unto you among them that are born a woman they have not been greater than john the baptist and i was standing he that is uh least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he i got to read this this quote out of influence should be on the back of the page there the first quote out of influence i just want us to try to get this and and then i'll i'll try to bring us bring it home a little bit today this says oh my god says what did john the baptist do the man that jesus said there was never a man born of woman like him or could compare with him until that time hmm i would love to just underline that yes yes jesus said there was never a man like john the baptist but brother branham just added a little something there until that time why could he say that because john the baptist's ministry was to introduce his first coming that's why jesus said that about john the baptist but there's another ministry coming that will introduce his second coming and that ministry be just as important there was a never a man born a woman like him or could compare with him until that time that great prophet ordained of god before the foundation world spoke of 1207 years before he ever come on or 712 years rather before he ever come on earth by the prophet isaiah here said what did he do when he seen a man come walking down out of the audience and looked up above and saw that fire coming down from heaven in the form of a dove he cried out i had i have need to be baptized of thee i must decrease he must increase god can't have two on the earth at the same time only one has the message you know i must decrease he is the messenger i've been up to to this time now he takes my place as elisha when elijah went up and throw back his robe to elijah elisha his ministry was finished elisha must take up where he left off he must increase i must decrease john the baptist i want to say something there and uh just line up the message the quote spoken words original seed i want to say something there um now notice he said uh as uh elijah went off the scene elisha had to take his place i want to just just drop this in elijah had to deal with jezebel and ahab but elisha had to deal with their daughter athalia and athelia actually became king well you can't be a king as a woman but she took over the authority of the kingdom of failure and it was elijah underneath elijah's day that they had to deal with that types us let's just read from spoken word's original seed i'm just i'm just dropping these things out and you know and and maybe enough for y'all to have some dentists dinnertime conversation smoke wars of regency this is where we're getting our thought vindicated truths from uh we're still in that same journey of uh speaking i mean of of stepping to the vision we we have just stepped into one we just stepped into one right we got another one that we're in right now uh but here uh this this this the angel told the prophet pick up his pen and write and this was a portion of what he wrote says the messenger of malachi 4 will appear at god's appointed time we are all looking for him we believe he will come now here brother bran is pick picking up his pen and writing and he's reading this to the people realizing that he is the one fulfilling it right my god fulfilling this so say the the messenger malachi 4 will appear at god's appointed time we are looking for him we believe he will come that is according to his word it will be at the end time which it is time now for to see it he will be correctly dedicated to the word as they have always been indicated by god's word and a vindicated right the message is going to be indicated in the word and then vindicated on top of that and when he's vindicated that should settle all questions if i were you i was if it's somebody that walked away from the message and still got a question just pull up the quote on what brother branham prophesied in 1933 and just tell me has it been fulfilled or not right you don't have to argue when things are vindicated and what i'm saying when god vindicates it no arguments no explaining nothing no here it is right here glory to god look at this god will vindicate what he preaches to be the truth as he did elijah for it is elijah coming how did god vindicate elijah when he called him to the mountain amen uh uh uh uh it says the god that answers by fire let him be god when when god answered by fire he vindicated elijah right look at this he says uh god would vindicate what he preaches to be truth as he did elijah for it is elijah coming making ready for the mount zion rapture jesus said in the last days it would be like lost time look at these statements jesus said the last days it'll be like last time what happened in lot's time homosexuality was out of control right out of control and and then first they said is that that's that's hate speech i was looking at some of these news things on the internet and they they said we want to know what's going to happen with christianity what you mean what's going to happen with christianity let's see that means there's going to be a boycott there's going to be an attack and we're going to find out where you really stand and won't that be something the very person that people put in the office comes against your very beliefs won't that be something all right all right um here it says uh uh in the last days it would be like lots time uh the pope not our pope but they pope just said he was okay with it same-sex marriages and and now we got a party that's also okay with it hey man they equate uh being a certain skin color to uh the same as being uh gay no no no and and the holy spirit told me a man being a certain skin color is not sin amen a certain color skin is not seen amen i i i i was reading this morning in the book of jeremiah jeremiah said can a leopard change his spots and he said something else jeremiah said can an ethiopian change his skin but just because ethiopia is born a certain color it's not sin amen amen all right his preaching will be with the spirit and strength line of god's word because so much has been called god's truth many will will misunderstand this true messenger i god wrote here p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y prophecy because because so much has been called god's truth by fakers many true ministers will misunderstand that messenger see but when god comes to vindicate it then it clears up all suspicion so we have a prophecy that i thought would be very appropriate to end on today the prophet preaches a message from that time he gives us a prophecy he says i won't have time in this meeting to tell you in 1933 this is a woman's nation did i write this down 60 uh it might be on the back of the page uh says uh uh this is a woman's nation it's the number 13. it appears in the 13th chapter of revelation 13 stars so when we start we got our first flag it was the flag was uh first designed by a woman right and and that woman put 13 stars and 13 stripes on the flag the one that we see just flapping and everybody get so much pride and joy and you ought to y'all thank god for the country you live in amen i i sometimes i see that flag like man that's that's i've been other places i've traveled when i get back to the u.s i say thank you lord and all you got to do is go out the country sometime you ain't got to go that far y'all ain't with me you'll be like thank you lord i live here right so i mean there's a balance because some people just man they write us off americans americans america's finished well not the bride in america amen right so say this is a woman's nation it's the number 13. it appears in the 13th chapter of revelation and you know and as brother brandon talk about the the the flag uh written by a woman um i mean designed by a woman but there's uh that song america the beautiful oh beautiful for spacious guys and amber waves and all that uh that was written by a woman right so so a lot of things it just deals with a woman our free our symbol of freedom is a woman holding a torch in her hand statue of liberty right this is a woman's nation and the prophet had already told us this but it took a a certain pharaoh a certain leader to be in position right that caused the people to get so people just i if i could just use this way people became hateful but it took a certain man with a certain disposition to push the people that when you only got two choices you're going to take the lesser two evils i told you i don't even vote for evil amen i wrote a guy in on the ballot and he didn't even show up in one percent of the votes what he created the united states um it appears in the 13th chapter of revelation 13 13 stripes 13 everything's at 13. everything is a woman and remember thus saith the lord there will be a woman rule before the end time now so we many people excited about what they see but remember this is a sign of something to happen before the end time when time winds up when time shall be no more so you just saw it right you just saw it manifested now it's time to really get your heart right with god amen amen look at it now says uh he says uh there will be a roman a woman ruled before the end time she'll either be president vice president or it'll be the catholic church as a woman now brother branham tied all that together and all this can fit in this one election we already got the vice president part we got the catholic church because this is from my understanding the second catholic president since john f kennedy so a good search for you is actually go back and brother branham was living during john f kennedy today he said john kennedy got there because of the vote of the women and if you just see what's celebrating hold on a whole bunch of women they just this the empowerment of women that's right all women amen glory to god and that's that hey glory i just i tell you it i heard i heard uh kamala say that i might be the first one but i won't be the last one and she right she right if if if they can get past this because it's supposed to be the last one destruction all over america yeah so this thing is going down yeah we're gonna go down fast praise the lord amen all right so here it is uh or uh she'll either be president like i'll say another a good search for you go back and see what brother branham said about a catholic president see what he might have said about it right because uh here the pope comes out and make a statement about same-sex marriages and then there's a leadership that goes into the u.s that agrees with what the pope said so laws may start changing right amen and now they're coming against your faith now some of y'all some of y'all uh the lord been telling you to go in business for yourself a long time ago you're gonna have to go in business because you're gonna be able to work that job they're gonna it's either this or that your faith can come into question praise the lord all right church all right all right all right god gonna make a way the squeeze a man the squeeze is here to squeeze us closer to god that's that's all said should i be president vice president or it'll be the catholic church as a woman i've seen her a great woman the nation bowed to her it'll be one before the end time and look at that capital thus save the lord i want to tell you something god can talk tell you something else god can hear god can see god can smell [Music] god can taste god can do all these things next week i'm going to show you how he do all that but i want you to see that yes we have a this is this is prophecy he said 1933 that's why i said 87 years ago this was already written newspapers didn't pick it up but i mean since since um for years we've been watching it hillary clinton come up we watch it uh sarah palin we watch it but finally it's here and that's why as soon as it happened i had to put out on my social media this day this prophecy is fulfilled thus saith the lord write it down and find out your young people see if it happens if it isn't i'm a false prophet now he put this he put himself out there and for years people have been trying to just tie this thing down to the catholic church it is it's todd he said oh he said oh and i believe i believe sometimes prophecy has multiple meanings but we just saw another fulfillment of what the prophet spoke and if that ain't vindication i don't know what people looking for but i got enough to keep me grounded ain't got enough to keep me close i got enough to keep me satisfied amen i want to tell you church we are walking and vindicated truths and i got another little part to the sermon that i want to bring and i'll do that on next week but uh i pray that the lord would just help us um you know with this and uh i'm gonna ask that we just bow our heads we're going to have a word of prayer and while i'm i it would just be wrong of me if i didn't open up this altar um to anyone that is here and and just feel like brother jack i need to draw closer to god i need to repent of some things i need to get i need to get things right i don't want to leave this church the way i came in i want to i want to leave different i want to leave difference the lord has been speaking to me and i'm seeing him and it would just be wrong with me if i did not open this alt and allow you an opportunity to come amen and make things right the scripture tells us that the day that we hear his voice heart not our hearts and and church i don't want us to just kind of go through the motions it's not about just going to church it's about getting our hearts right with god this is the place to do it this is the place to do it i'm going to pray and amen if you desire prayer if you desire you know anything i'm the altar is open for you to come and we'll pray with you we'll pray for you or whatever you desire amen we'll we'll do that but let's pray and amen you are welcome to come here to this altar amen at any time the altar is open father we uh just approach your throne lord we are believers we see god very clearly god that the word has been vindicated in our day those we can go back there to uh the scripture and see how they miss the lord jesus they miss john the baptist they missed so many god it was just completely missed they they had certain things that they were holding on to it they were just missing the whole picture and god in this hour we don't want to miss nothing we really want to be spiritually in tune with what the holy spirit is doing because this is what's bringing us closer to the coming of the lord and god i don't want to miss the coming of the lord i don't want to come to church lord and hear these things but no my life is not up to par where it should be god and all i got is head knowledge head knowledge will not put me in heaven but it's going to take a change in my heart and father i need something that gives me power over sin i i need something that gives me a power over uh the the enemy that has me bound in my life god i need something that gives me victory i realize i'm gonna leave here and i'm gonna face trials but lord i know that you are able lord to elevate me you're able to lift me a little higher god but it starts with a repentant heart so as i've heard the word god we we want to just stand in your presence lord and tell you how much we're sorry sorry lord for failing you and for letting you down and lord for not doing things the way that you have taught us to do it god we turn our hearts to you god we turn our hearts to you you are our only hope you are our only help your only you're the only thing that we uh we have got you all that we have and all that we need

by sending his presence amen into our midst uh i i'm i'm grateful for the way things happen here uh god allow a precious sister to speak in tongues and as she yielded to the presence of the lord god gave somebody the interpretation so yield it to the presence of the lord and this is what we're longing for this is what we're looking for it only gets greater from here we know the prophet told us that when somebody and even the bible says somebody speaks in tongues or interprets should be out of the mouth of one or two that's all he said so it did exactly the way the scripture and the way the prophet taught us so church we are free amen to receive what god has done and i trust that we'll be able to go back uh to the video and hear what was being spoken because god was trying to say something to us amen and i know sometimes we get a little excited and that's fine because god is speaking but sometimes he has something he's really trying to say to you and i could feel the anointing just kind of coming on that and i just thank god amen i thank god for what he what he spoke to us so we'll go back to the video and try to get the exact words of what he said what he said to us may may god reveal it may god reveal it sometimes god wants to give us personal messages for the church and he he gave us something here today church amen this 11th month amen and i believe it's the eighth day praise the lord amen eight is the number of new beginning praise the lord all right somebody is about to experience a new beginning amen and eleventh amen it shows that you're not too late

just one time it'll be like this all the time amen we're believing that amen i wanted brother troy just to close us out amen today and amen and we'll have the brothers come and those that want to just stay and just maybe sit in the presence of the lord will turn on the music and and allow you just to sit and just just bathe in his presence and feel free to do that you don't have to rush out of here amen when god comes like this just enjoy the presence of the lord god bless you amen saints what can we say amen surely the presence of the lord with us this morning hey man you know amen there's a lot i could say but let us just pray amen most gracious heavenly father how our hearts are just overwhelmed oh god he started out saying that the manifestation is the vindication and lord how you manifested yourself to us this morning lord god to the point it leaves no doubt and lord i we see father as the day approaches and we're seeing lord things are coming more clear we're seeing

there's a speech in expression on new presence of the lord sweet holy spirit sweet [Music] stay right here with us filling us with your love and for these blessings [Music] without a doubt we know that we have been revived when we shall leave this place god bless you church i'm not going to come and talk in front of everybody but it's been burning on my heart i know i haven't been here but the lord has been dealing with me while i was not here and i've been going through a lot so um some of you guys may know with some of them don't know i was expecting a child and i lost the baby a couple of weeks ago and i was so um down and depressed couldn't understand why it happened i still i mean i still can't understand what happened but all of it and this a few sisters that i spoke to that called me and talked to me just was encouraging me and letting me know that you know especially sister ruth um that god don't make no mistakes and it happened for a reason we don't know why and i said okay well and i just after talking to her i couldn't understand still couldn't understand so i began to just pray i said lord if this is a way to bring me back because you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah from from when i had my son you never left me you always been here no matter how i may not come to church when but you've always been there and i just began to pray this this week pastor just and i just been praying i've been reading my bible and he's just been showing so much stuff to me that me losing his child started to make sense and on my way i have it thank you on my way um coming to church i was not going to come to church because i had to go into the hospital last week thursday to um so they can proceed to doing a dnc to remove the baby and um you know i was in the healing process and i said you know what i'm just going to pray my way through it and come to church this morning and on my way coming down haverhill and i just began to pray i said lord you've been you started from when it was thursday morning at my house my daughter woke me up at 4 30 in the morning and i just began to read my bible and pray i said you started then and you i asked that you come today and speak to me you reveal yourself to me he did he did i just took my daughter to the bathroom and she said something she's only two years old she just said something to me that let me know that this is a confirmation she just was like mommy while you were praying god was touching you and she said god is singing in your heart she's only two years old although i've been hurt trying to understand why this happened now it makes sense one of the ladies from my old job called me and said jemima you know god don't make no more say and she's not even a christian she's not even a believer she just said it to me she was like god don't make no mistake he took the baby for a reason and you know you you don't know what could have happened but um he don't make no mistake so just thank god for the three kids that you have now and just move on and that's what i've been i've been doing and today been a confirmation from the lord that everything is going to be okay [Applause] hey man you know there's been a lot going on in all of our individual lives to those that might have been sort of coming sometime and not coming sometime there was a reason for you being here today god don't make any mistakes he had you here today for a reason i'm hearing that testimony all the things you know you know jack mentioned in this message that how god is a he's a he's a chess player create a condition over here just to move you into the position he really wants you to be in so there's a lot of things different ones are going through your trials let's see your trials that you go through is just god putting you in the fire for the purpose of molding you to his will i think it's not strange these fiery trials amen but count them all joy because it's just to mold you and to make you the beautiful thing about going through the fire is that on the outside of the fire you go into the mold to mold you and his hands is the mold he don't put you into some mechanical or man-made mold he mows you with his hands no place i'd rather be than in the hands of almighty god he's the potter and i am the clay mold me and shake me after your will he's doing the molding it may seem difficult what we're going through the fire's hot but what's it doing it's heating you up to making you harder as he molds you for a purpose he's a great architect he's a great builder and he's building a bribe without a spot or a wrinkle molded and tried and tested true how many thank god for the word thank god for the what he's doing [Applause] thank god for the holy ghost thank god for our pastor
