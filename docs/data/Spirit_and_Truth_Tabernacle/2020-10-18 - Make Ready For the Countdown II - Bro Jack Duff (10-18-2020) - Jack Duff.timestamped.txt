[11:01] praise the lord let's open our bibles to
[11:03] psalms
[11:05] [Music]
[11:12] 23.
[11:20] it was strange we were on our way here
[11:24] and i had already known that i was going
[11:27] to read
[11:28] this scripture and
[11:31] one of the songs came on was psalms 23
[11:33] one of the men was singing
[11:35] and right when that ended uh i guess a
[11:39] little clip of smoking norfolk
[11:40] he was preaching and he pulled right out
[11:42] of psalms 23.
[11:44] i was like okay lord we're going to read
[11:46] this
[11:48] the first verse reads the lord is my
[11:51] shepherd i shall not want
[11:54] and as smoking norfolk read that he said
[11:57] if you notice here that's not you don't
[12:00] want more of god
[12:02] he said you won't have one of anything
[12:04] because he's the god of no lack
[12:07] you won't lack anything and i thought
[12:09] that was i thought that was good
[12:11] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[12:15] he maketh me to lie down in green
[12:17] pastures
[12:19] he leadeth me beside the steel waters he
[12:22] restored my soul
[12:24] he leadeth me in the path paths of
[12:26] righteousness for his name's sake
[12:28] yea though i walk through the valley of
[12:30] the shadow of death
[12:32] i will fear no evil for thou art with me
[12:35] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[12:38] thou preparest the table before me in
[12:40] the presence of mine enemies
[12:42] thou anointes my head with oil my cup
[12:45] runneth over
[12:46] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[12:48] me all the days of my life
[12:51] and i will dwell in the house of the
[12:52] lord forever

[45:48] is a refilling of the holy ghost so
[45:52] god are we come with our cups empty amen
[45:55] looking for you to feel it

[46:05] encouraged if there is any uh god that
[46:09] need to be corrected
[46:10] may they be corrected uh lord whatever
[46:13] the need here
[46:14] is today if there is some sick may they

[47:22] this sermon make ready for the countdown
[47:25] uh i wanted to just start us off today
[47:28] from
[47:29] the sermon christ is the mystery
[47:32] of god reveal amen uh just a
[47:36] rather long quote here that i want to
[47:39] just uh
[47:40] open up uh but let's just start there
[47:44] and um just let the lord carry us
[47:48] uh the prophet makes the statement in
[47:51] this sermon
[47:53] says uh then we can see that the
[47:57] marriage
[47:57] supper is at hand
[48:01] amen the marriage supper is at hand now
[48:04] i believe that statement is going to
[48:05] connect with something else that we'll
[48:07] say
[48:07] a little bit later amen uh
[48:10] but since then we can see that the
[48:12] marriage supper is at hand
[48:15] uh now if i never see you again remember
[48:18] the marriage supper is at hand
[48:22] right it's at hand uh and then the
[48:25] kingdom
[48:26] according to the promise is ready to be
[48:29] issued in
[48:30] the great millennium the taking up of
[48:33] the church
[48:34] glory to god amen the taking up of the
[48:36] church
[48:37] and the destroying of the wicked amen
[48:41] and the world under the sixth seal
[48:44] to be purified by volcanic
[48:48] to take all the corruption and sin of
[48:50] the world and to mold her out again
[48:53] and bring forth a bright new millennium
[48:57] for the age that is to come
[49:00] amen so those volcanoes started erupting
[49:03] there's a purpose for that there's a
[49:06] cleansing getting ready to take place
[49:09] amen this this this earth actually has
[49:11] got to become
[49:12] a new earth amen and when we talk about
[49:16] a new heaven and new earth we're talking
[49:17] about new atmospheres
[49:19] glory to god amen uh uh uh
[49:22] satan is also even in the atmosphere
[49:26] you know when we talk with some some of
[49:27] these uh hurricanes and great storms and
[49:30] stuff that come out of nowhere
[49:32] man-made storms hallelujah some wicked
[49:36] man
[49:36] has created this because satan is a part
[49:38] of the atmosphere
[49:40] glory to god but we're going to a place
[49:42] where there be no more hurricanes
[49:44] praise god i won't need category 5
[49:46] windows there
[49:48] come on somebody i ain't boarding up no
[49:49] house over there
[49:51] amen i'm going back to a perfect
[49:53] condition again
[49:54] glory to god amen so the prophet says it
[49:57] says now when we see all these
[49:59] uh great threefold revelation
[50:03] and i love this the way he brought it
[50:05] because when we talk about christ as the
[50:06] mystery of god reveal he brought out
[50:08] this point
[50:08] that there were three things that was in
[50:10] god's mind first thing he wanted to
[50:12] reveal himself to his people
[50:14] amen secondly he wanted to have the
[50:16] preeminence in
[50:18] in his people and thirdly he wanted to
[50:20] return the people
[50:21] back to eating conditions again glory to
[50:24] god that's god's
[50:26] plan amen reveal himself to his people
[50:28] have the preeminence
[50:30] in the people and then take the people
[50:32] back to eating conditions again
[50:34] everything that adam lost is supposed to
[50:37] come back
[50:38] to the sons of god let me just stop and
[50:40] say this
[50:41] there i mean what other generation are
[50:43] we expecting to come on the earth
[50:45] to go back into that place amen
[50:48] the generation that is hearing it
[50:50] preached is a generation that's going
[50:53] back into that place
[50:54] that adam lost praise god
[50:58] amen i believe that said when we see all
[51:00] these great uh
[51:01] threefold revelation god in christ
[51:03] christ in the church
[51:04] the kingdom coming adam and eve redeemed
[51:08] back to the garden of eden in the
[51:10] representation of christ and his pride
[51:12] and the kingdom is going to be restored
[51:15] according to his promise praise be to
[51:18] god now
[51:19] by the revelation of the threefold
[51:20] mystery the secret and by the personal
[51:22] vindicated word
[51:24] by his original handship let's keep
[51:26] going in this he says but i'm talking
[51:28] about the headship of christ
[51:30] hallelujah amen notice being personally
[51:33] identified
[51:34] by the original headship we
[51:37] have the answer to the devil's
[51:42] question glory hallelujah
[51:46] amen glory we have the answer
[51:49] to the devil's question says he christ
[51:53] is risen and has paid the price and
[51:56] raising up the head or the body amen he
[51:58] says raising up the body
[52:00] do you realize as we hear revelation
[52:02] after revelation the body has been
[52:04] raised
[52:05] glory to god coming into her place and
[52:08] the he say the devil can't stand it
[52:11] you want to know why you fighting why
[52:13] are you going through this
[52:14] and why are you going through that the
[52:16] devil can't stand you
[52:18] but you ought to have similar feelings
[52:20] towards the devil
[52:21] he can't stand me and i can't stand him
[52:24] glory to god hallelujah
[52:27] amen we're going to fight until he's
[52:29] cast into the lake of fire
[52:31] amen the devil can't stand it that's the
[52:33] reason these economical kingdoms
[52:35] are setting up that's the reason they're
[52:37] all coming into what they're doing now
[52:39] the devil that's the reason he's howling
[52:41] the way he is
[52:42] his wickedness his scheme has been
[52:44] uncovered by the risen resurrected
[52:47] christ
[52:48] in the headship over his body glory
[52:51] i like that god i mean the word is
[52:53] taking its place
[52:55] amen we uh as we were talking last week
[52:58] amen we're not that kind of woman
[53:00] amen satan has got to recognize that he
[53:03] just can't present
[53:04] anything to us and expect us to fall to
[53:07] it
[53:08] we're not that kind of woman you can't
[53:11] talk to me like that satan
[53:12] you can't handle me like that satan i'm
[53:15] not
[53:15] that kind of woman
[53:19] praise god amen says you think i'm
[53:21] beside myself i'm not
[53:23] we got the answer we got the devil's
[53:25] answer
[53:26] not me that liveth but christ the word
[53:29] living in me
[53:30] is not my idea it's his power not my
[53:33] idea it's his word he promised it
[53:35] here it is he said it would be here and
[53:38] here it is we
[53:38] got his answer
[53:42] you are the answer god
[53:45] manifested in you is the answer glory to
[53:49] god christ
[53:49] has risen and has paid the price for our
[53:52] redemption
[53:53] what god in christ manifested he gave
[53:56] that flesh that that and the blood
[53:58] that in the blood might come the life
[54:00] and the flesh be redeemed and now this
[54:02] is a statement that i
[54:03] i want to get to here it says god in
[54:06] this redeemed flesh
[54:09] manifest his word for the day as he did
[54:13] in that day
[54:17] and it's time just for us to recognize
[54:19] who we are
[54:20] right it's one thing to a man to look at
[54:23] all the bible characters and
[54:25] and we can see god in their life amen
[54:28] and
[54:28] uh uh you know just man just the great
[54:30] prophets that god used uh
[54:32] throughout the throughout the ages amen
[54:35] even even down to this day where we can
[54:37] see god through the testimony
[54:39] that we've heard how god was just
[54:41] manifested even through
[54:42] brother branham glory to god but brother
[54:44] branham's not here anymore
[54:46] amen but that same god is the same
[54:48] yesterday today in february
[54:50] i remember a quote here just uh uh take
[54:53] that down just for a second for me
[54:54] i remember amen uh a statement that the
[54:57] prophet made
[54:58] he was uh praying for you know he was
[55:01] hesitating on praying for this this man
[55:04] and uh the man that got crushed by a car
[55:06] some kind of way got hit by a car and
[55:08] and uh and brother branham was just
[55:10] sitting there talking to his wife
[55:11] and they say you know um if jesus was
[55:15] here
[55:16] he said jesus go down and pray for that
[55:18] man and i got i
[55:20] got a perfect faith that if jesus prayed
[55:23] for that man
[55:24] even though he'd been crushed by a car
[55:26] that man was going to get up from that
[55:28] condition
[55:29] it didn't matter how bad it looked if
[55:31] jesus was on the scene
[55:33] that man situation was going to change
[55:36] he's saying now i know jesus not he said
[55:38] but if jesus
[55:40] gave me a vision he says then i would uh
[55:44] step into that vision right because i
[55:47] would know that
[55:48] you know i could go down and pray for
[55:50] him and say but you know the reason i
[55:51] just won't go ahead of a vision because
[55:53] i got dirty hands amen i got
[55:56] unclean hands and say i just don't feel
[56:00] right about praying for you know that
[56:02] brother with these unclean hands
[56:04] he said he said but if he gave me a
[56:05] vision i would just go down there and
[56:07] pray for him
[56:08] and i would know by position that the
[56:11] man was gonna
[56:12] rise from that condition and as he set
[56:16] pondering this thing amen and then
[56:18] struck him a revelation struggle said
[56:20] now if he gave you a vision you would be
[56:22] using them dirty hands
[56:24] and if you didn't have a vision you
[56:26] still using the same dirty hands
[56:29] hallelujah with the same dirty hands
[56:31] without a vision
[56:33] he went and prayed anyway and when he
[56:35] prayed the man came to his feet
[56:38] hallelujah we need to recognize that god
[56:40] is dwelling
[56:42] in this redeemed flesh
[56:48] hallelujah i say god is dwelling in your
[56:50] redeemed flesh
[56:52] your flesh has been washed by the blood
[56:54] god is dwelling in your flesh
[56:58] hallelujah look at this it says uh
[57:01] christ
[57:02] has risen has paid the price of our
[57:04] redemption
[57:05] what god in christ manifested he gave
[57:08] that flesh
[57:09] that and blood that in the blood might
[57:11] come the life
[57:12] and the flesh be redeemed that god in
[57:15] this redeemed flesh
[57:17] could manifest his word for for the day
[57:21] as he did in that day woo
[57:25] says you see it oh my when when can i
[57:28] stop notice it
[57:29] and then congregation yelling go on
[57:33] that's good when the church church
[57:34] church church just they want more more
[57:37] more more more i told y'all a few weeks
[57:39] ago we
[57:40] we're not trying to serve fast food here
[57:43] glory to god we want a seven course meal
[57:46] that we can give the people of god
[57:48] and when i mean you know back in the in
[57:49] the old testament i believe is
[57:51] the book of nehemiah as one of them they
[57:53] stayed in church for
[57:55] and worshiped for a great portion of the
[57:57] day almost the entire day
[57:59] nobody looking at their watch trying to
[58:00] go home just happy to be in the presence
[58:02] of god
[58:03] glory to god we got to come back to
[58:06] today's like that
[58:07] he goes on to say this says them then we
[58:09] stand justified
[58:11] hallelujah amen then we stand justified
[58:14] in the presence of god as a drop of ink
[58:17] dropping into a tuple of bleach
[58:20] you'll never find the strain of the
[58:24] ink no more it went somewhere amen
[58:27] it'll never come back again hallelujah
[58:31] and when man is truly redeemed that

[1:10:39] just hold quiet and pray
[1:10:41] i want to get this in real good i want
[1:10:43] this to grind down
[1:10:44] the seed of christ must m-u-s-t
[1:10:49] must come through his body
[1:10:52] not through a denomination i love that
[1:10:56] you're not gonna find this type of
[1:10:58] preaching
[1:10:59] in denominations and i want to go a
[1:11:02] little further amen with this statement
[1:11:04] the seed is passing through the body
[1:11:07] somebody has to believe this
[1:11:09] amen and as they believe it they're
[1:11:11] sharing it with you
[1:11:13] lord of god and then it quickens
[1:11:14] something inside of you
[1:11:16] and you share with others and the seed
[1:11:18] is passing through
[1:11:19] the body come on somebody
[1:11:23] right hey man that that's how that's how
[1:11:26] another life is reproduced
[1:11:27] when the seed passes through the body
[1:11:30] you're not just coming in contact with
[1:11:32] people
[1:11:32] just to come in contact with people god
[1:11:34] has purpose because the seed
[1:11:37] has to pass through your body
[1:11:40] your redeemed flesh the seed has to pass
[1:11:42] through that
[1:11:43] to get to the next amen uh son of god a
[1:11:45] daughter of god out there glory to god
[1:11:48] amen now now you know even when we're
[1:11:50] studying
[1:11:51] this message like you'll see me i'm
[1:11:52] quoting a prophet you can just pull that
[1:11:54] down just for a second
[1:11:56] i'm quoting the prophet now i have i
[1:11:58] have other sources that i can go to
[1:12:01] hallelujah i got i got i got all kind of
[1:12:04] bible dictionaries
[1:12:05] i got all kind of things like that that
[1:12:07] i can go to and i can i can go to the
[1:12:09] greek lexicon
[1:12:11] come on somebody amen i can go to the
[1:12:13] emphatic diaglot
[1:12:15] i can use all types of sources in order
[1:12:17] to try to bring you truth
[1:12:18] amen i can tell you scofield said
[1:12:23] right amen but but when i'm using things
[1:12:25] like that you got to understand
[1:12:27] that i'm using a theological standpoint
[1:12:31] so we say the word is not coming through
[1:12:34] denomination it's not coming through
[1:12:36] amen the seed is not passing through a
[1:12:37] through life theological mindset
[1:12:40] hallelujah somebody stay with me lord of
[1:12:43] god amen when we where
[1:12:44] even when you pick up different bibles
[1:12:47] different manufacturers of the bible
[1:12:49] they get behind different theologians
[1:12:51] and have them put those scriptures
[1:12:53] together
[1:12:54] hallelujah you know there was uh the
[1:12:57] what's the name of the bible
[1:12:58] uh oh lord help me jesus
[1:13:02] uh not not
[1:13:06] y'all call out some of them names
[1:13:07] amplified thank you very much
[1:13:10] uh amplify if you actually look at the
[1:13:12] amplified bible
[1:13:13] because people got that and say i'm just
[1:13:15] trying to understand it a little bit
[1:13:17] better
[1:13:18] i'm just trying to understand it so i
[1:13:20] pull out an amplifier
[1:13:21] and a brother bought me that amplified
[1:13:23] and i was like oh yeah okay this is
[1:13:24] making a lot more sense
[1:13:25] god don't want his word just to make
[1:13:29] sense it's got to be revealed
[1:13:36] so one day i was reading the very front
[1:13:39] before genesis
[1:13:41] when you read in the front of the bible
[1:13:42] see who wrote this bible
[1:13:44] how did they get inspired to put this
[1:13:46] bible together come to find out it was a
[1:13:49] learned woman
[1:13:50] that had gone to school for a number of
[1:13:52] years and if this this company got
[1:13:54] behind her said she's a very smart woman
[1:13:56] we're going to support her and putting
[1:13:58] scripture together
[1:14:00] i said no no no that ain't the way
[1:14:02] bible's supposed to be written
[1:14:04] right bob it don't come through
[1:14:06] knowledge
[1:14:08] hallelujah even even even in reading
[1:14:10] your bible you got to be careful because
[1:14:12] theologians sometimes can be right and
[1:14:15] sometimes they can be wrong
[1:14:18] so i'm not following the thought of a
[1:14:20] theologian
[1:14:21] but when i quote a prophet
[1:14:25] come on doing things according to the
[1:14:29] word you want to not you
[1:14:30] i mean you want to know why because
[1:14:32] you're trying to learn scripture i get
[1:14:33] that you're trying to understand
[1:14:35] nothing wrong with that but the amen the
[1:14:37] scripture says
[1:14:38] amen the lord our god will do nothing
[1:14:43] praise god amos three and seven
[1:14:46] god will do nothing until he reveal
[1:14:49] his secrets to his servants the prophets
[1:14:55] god ain't revealing it to theologians
[1:14:57] god reveals it to a prophet
[1:14:59] come on somebody amen and then
[1:15:01] deuteronomy 29 say
[1:15:03] the secret things belong to our god
[1:15:06] but once they are revealed praise god
[1:15:10] once it's come through a prophet then it
[1:15:12] belongs to
[1:15:13] us and to our children
[1:15:17] so i don't i choose not to focus on the
[1:15:21] theologian
[1:15:22] i choose to focus on what a vindicated
[1:15:25] prophet said
[1:15:26] that's why i quote you a prophet
[1:15:29] hallelujah
[1:15:30] glory to god now let's go on a little
[1:15:33] further
[1:15:34] amen amen praise god
[1:15:37] so here he says this now that the seed
[1:15:41] must m-u-s-t must come through his body
[1:15:43] not through a denomination
[1:15:45] but through a born-again seed of the
[1:15:47] word must come through
[1:15:49] now remember what is it christ's seed
[1:15:53] how does my seed come through the body
[1:15:55] how does the apple tree seed come
[1:15:58] how does the apple tree seed come how's
[1:16:01] another apple tree
[1:16:02] uh grown it's through the seed that is
[1:16:04] already in the body
[1:16:07] already in the body of the apple you
[1:16:10] have to take it out of the body put it
[1:16:12] in the ground
[1:16:13] committed to the earth and a new tree
[1:16:15] comes forth
[1:16:17] hallelujah glory he said he says
[1:16:20] how does the apple tree seed come

[1:19:05] things glory to god that was the whole
[1:19:08] purpose of god sending a prophet to

[1:24:32] but i'm reading this this week from
[1:24:33] pergamum church
[1:24:35] he says how can any messenger sent from
[1:24:38] god see this is the
[1:24:40] angel telling the prophet pick up his
[1:24:41] pen and write and we're we're catching
[1:24:43] ourselves

[1:24:46] that
[1:24:47] that was written down we're stepping
[1:24:48] into this vision this year

[1:24:52] believe only a part of the word and
[1:24:54] and deny some of it say the true prophet
[1:24:56] of god
[1:24:57] in this last they will proclaim the
[1:24:59] whole
[1:25:01] word he wants something to declare
[1:25:04] nothing

[1:25:31] but the predestinated will hear
[1:25:35] and be ready for the rapture see the
[1:25:36] production again they in the orbit
[1:25:39] all right say the predestination will
[1:25:41] hear and be ready for the rapture now

[1:33:33] resurrection that called lazarus
[1:33:38] he told he told his sister to say i am
[1:33:40] the resurrection in the life
[1:33:41] you say he that believeth on me though
[1:33:43] he worried that yes shall he live
[1:33:45] and he says they were they didn't
[1:33:46] realize the resurrection was a
[1:33:48] person oh i'mma say it again they didn't
[1:33:51] realize
[1:33:52] the resurrection was a person
[1:33:56] and that person is standing here right
[1:33:58] now
[1:34:00] [Music]
[1:34:02] and the same he says brother branham say
[1:34:04] had let had
[1:34:05] had jesus not called lazarus by name
[1:34:09] he said everything that was in the grave
[1:34:11] would have come out
[1:34:13] amen he had to call him by name because
[1:34:15] that's that kept everything else there
[1:34:17] kept everything else in place
[1:34:19] lazarus come forth lazarus came out and
[1:34:21] they had to unwrap him out of them grave
[1:34:22] clothes
[1:34:23] let's send him back to do what he used
[1:34:25] to do praise god somebody need to be
[1:34:27] unwrapped
[1:34:30] glory glory take off them grave clothes
[1:34:32] let them come out and do something for
[1:34:34] the lord
[1:34:35] amen and what was that trump it was a
[1:34:37] call to the feast
[1:34:39] and he said he said what that call to
[1:34:40] the feast is is calling us to the
[1:34:42] marriage supper
[1:34:44] of the lamb oh hallelujah when the jews
[1:34:47] got
[1:34:47] amen at the feast of of trumpets they
[1:34:50] always got
[1:34:51] called by trump is by blowing up
[1:34:53] trumpets
[1:34:54] amen and you know i was just looking at
[1:34:56] that leviticus 23 24 i won't read it
[1:34:59] that's the feast of the trumpets where
[1:35:00] they blow the trumpets and that that
[1:35:02] that that actually occurred on the first
[1:35:05] day of the seventh month
[1:35:07] in the jewish calendar and uh the
[1:35:09] seventh month on the jewish calendar is
[1:35:10] called the montiry
[1:35:13] glory to god and i was just i was just
[1:35:15] moved by this because
[1:35:17] the month history on the jewish calendar
[1:35:20] actually equates to the month
[1:35:21] september or october on our calendar
[1:35:25] and god has this message going forth at
[1:35:27] this time

[1:35:54] amen and we have identified it not just
[1:35:57] us but the prophet
[1:35:59] identified the two witnesses as moses
[1:36:02] and elijah now there's some that believe
[1:36:05] it was
[1:36:05] enoch amen as one of the witnesses but
[1:36:08] noah's moses and elijah now how can you
[1:36:11] tell
[1:36:11] we're not going to just we're not going

[1:37:43] uh while he was in space
[1:37:46] amen he actually you know he talked
[1:37:48] about he took some pictures in there
[1:37:50] they said he blew up on uh maybe
[1:37:52] instagram or one of the social media
[1:37:54] because all the pictures that he was
[1:37:55] sending back from space
[1:37:57] says just a very glorious sight that the
[1:37:59] man was looking at he said you turn
[1:38:00] one side and you see the earth is like
[1:38:02] wow i'm just a little speck on that
[1:38:05] little planet i mean that big old planet
[1:38:06] there
[1:38:07] he said then i look on the other side i
[1:38:08] just see all blackness and darkness but
[1:38:10] there's so many other worlds down in
[1:38:12] that that other that other area
[1:38:14] he said he said just amazing you stand
[1:38:16] there you look at he said one day
[1:38:18] he uh working on the space station he
[1:38:20] had to take a space walk
[1:38:21] had to go out and work on some of the
[1:38:23] equipment out there and while he was out
[1:38:25] there
[1:38:26] in space it says he had a certain
[1:38:28] certain uh uh something that was on his
[1:38:30] glasses and
[1:38:31] and somehow a man this stuff that was on
[1:38:34] the glass has got
[1:38:35] inside of his eye and while he's there
[1:38:39] on space
[1:38:40] his eye just shut closed the left eye
[1:38:42] just shuts close and
[1:38:43] he'd say i can't even see out of this
[1:38:45] eye he says that
[1:38:46] i don't know what i'm going to do he
[1:38:49] says but we practice
[1:38:50] this see the more you know
[1:38:55] come on i want you to imagine the man is
[1:38:57] standing on the space shuttle
[1:38:59] i've taken a space walk stand he said
[1:39:02] holding on just by one hand
[1:39:04] and he's going blind
[1:39:08] he says he said my eye just shut he says
[1:39:11] uh you know
[1:39:12] nothing that i could do about his savior
[1:39:13] and then it just began to tear up
[1:39:15] because of
[1:39:16] you know just being contaminated it says
[1:39:18] but because there's no
[1:39:19] gravity the tear began to
[1:39:23] rather than flow down and just begin to
[1:39:25] become a big ball of water
[1:39:28] behind my glass and hey i got my
[1:39:29] spacesuit on i can't touch my eye
[1:39:32] i can't do nothing but the more you know
[1:39:36] the less you feel
[1:39:40] it says he says uh it says before you
[1:39:42] know it
[1:39:43] that that water that's that's kind of
[1:39:45] forming in my eye and not
[1:39:47] dropping because there's no gravity he
[1:39:48] said what happened it began to break the
[1:39:50] bridge of my nose
[1:39:52] and then it got over into the other eye
[1:39:54] and now i'm
[1:39:55] totally blind on a space walk
[1:40:00] what am i gonna tell houston cause we
[1:40:04] really got a problem
[1:40:07] we really got a problem but houston
[1:40:09] can't do nothing for me
[1:40:12] he said he said crying ain't gonna do
[1:40:15] nothing for me
[1:40:17] worrying ain't gonna do nothing for me
[1:40:19] but the more i
[1:40:20] know the less i fear
[1:40:24] he says he says what i did he said i
[1:40:25] remember some of my training
[1:40:27] it says me and my partner we trained say
[1:40:29] what if one of us became
[1:40:30] uh incapacitated out here what would
[1:40:32] happen how would we how would we do say
[1:40:34] so we kept going through exercises
[1:40:37] he says he said when we when we when we
[1:40:39] went through hours and hours of exercise
[1:40:41] we prepared for failure
[1:40:46] we practiced failure he said because the
[1:40:49] more we know
[1:40:51] the less we fear and it says he says as
[1:40:54] as we as we practice these things and
[1:40:56] now here we are in a situation that we
[1:40:58] don't really know what to do so
[1:40:59] he said my my partner finally made it
[1:41:01] over to me and i told him what was going
[1:41:02] on
[1:41:03] so they decided to do a little something
[1:41:05] that was able to clear up his glasses
[1:41:07] and when they got him cleared up he says
[1:41:08] uh you say the water got absorbed out he
[1:41:10] said now i can see again
[1:41:12] he says but if i were to panic at that
[1:41:15] moment
[1:41:16] i might not be here telling the story
[1:41:18] say can you imagine being in space
[1:41:23] going blind it says but the more i knew
[1:41:27] less i feel he said he said whatever you
[1:41:29] do don't fear
[1:41:30] can i tell you that church right now
[1:41:32] whatever you do don't fear
[1:41:35] glory to god he says when they got ready
[1:41:37] to ride
[1:41:38] a man into the space shuttle to get him
[1:41:40] special that morning the van takes them
[1:41:42] out there to the space shuttle
[1:41:44] and it says uh they have to ride the
[1:41:46] elevator up to the top of the space
[1:41:48] shuttle to get in
[1:41:49] it says when they get in they have to go
[1:41:51] in one at a time
[1:41:55] and you realize the way they have to go
[1:41:57] in they have to crawl in glory to god
[1:42:01] they have to crawl and they got to go on
[1:42:03] their knees
[1:42:04] and you want to know how you're going to
[1:42:06] make it praise god somebody
[1:42:10] you gonna have to get on your knees
[1:42:15] that's how they got into this orbit
[1:42:17] that's how they got themselves prepared
[1:42:20] they had to be prepared mentally they
[1:42:22] had to be prepared physically
[1:42:23] they had to be prepared emotionally and
[1:42:25] that's the same way you got to prepare
[1:42:27] yourself the bride
[1:42:28] must make herself ready
[1:42:33] i love this i love this this little
[1:42:37] uh i want to just kind of uh inject
[1:42:40] something here
[1:42:42] oh my my my my my my
[1:42:46] uh he made this statement it says once
[1:42:49] when that when they when they
[1:42:50] crawl in say they close the hatch to the
[1:42:53] space shuttle they just
[1:42:54] they get ready for the countdown they
[1:42:56] get ready for the countdown he says
[1:42:58] he says they have a saying amongst the
[1:43:01] astronauts
[1:43:02] he says there is no problem so bad
[1:43:06] that you can make it worse
[1:43:09] i want to say that again there is no
[1:43:13] problem so bad
[1:43:16] that you can make it worse
[1:43:20] you just think about that no problem so
[1:43:24] bad that you can make worse and when he
[1:43:25] went blind he thought about what he said
[1:43:28] i'm not going to panic because i will
[1:43:29] make it worse
[1:43:35] he talked about how they reset their
[1:43:37] levels of fear
[1:43:39] he says uh through training they just
[1:43:42] keep resetting their levels of fear see
[1:43:43] the more you know
[1:43:44] the less you fear and they say now if
[1:43:46] someone
[1:43:47] say he say if you if you feared spider
[1:43:50] webs
[1:43:51] he says what you need to do is a study
[1:43:53] about spiders to see which ones are
[1:43:55] poisonous and which ones aren't
[1:43:56] he says from canada they got they got
[1:43:58] about 79 or 80 different spiders they
[1:44:00] but only one of them is poisonous
[1:44:02] and they say you got certain markings on
[1:44:04] your body so you already know
[1:44:05] what this thing looked like the others
[1:44:07] that you see are not poisonous
[1:44:08] he says so if you want to reset your
[1:44:10] level of fear he says when you see a
[1:44:12] spider web
[1:44:13] check to see what type of spider is it
[1:44:15] because it's only one you're looking for
[1:44:16] that poisons
[1:44:18] if it's not that one the rest of them
[1:44:19] not poisons he said if he said if you
[1:44:21] see a spider web
[1:44:22] walk through it
[1:44:27] you say you see another one walk through
[1:44:29] it
[1:44:30] you say you see a third walk through it
[1:44:32] he said what happens as you keep walking
[1:44:34] through it you reset your level of fear
[1:44:41] and what we need to do as a church reset
[1:44:44] the level of fear
[1:44:47] priests god amen
[1:44:51] reset your level of fear you'll go
[1:44:53] further than what you ever thought you
[1:44:54] could go

[1:44:56] you could do your faith would go to
[1:44:58] another level

[1:48:48] listening
[1:48:48] to the countdown these are scriptures

[1:49:24] look it says amen now look at that see
[1:49:27] how that that that it changed colors on
[1:49:29] you right there
[1:49:31] because brother branham does something
[1:49:32] after he preached it he when he preached
[1:49:34] he just let it go like that he was done
[1:49:36] i don't know what i don't know what the
[1:49:38] church was doing but he was done with
[1:49:40] the sermon but he
[1:49:40] said brother branham eight hours later
[1:49:45] recorded this additional ending portion
[1:49:48] he changed the ending of the sermon
[1:49:50] eight hours later not under the
[1:49:51] inspiration of what was happening in the
[1:49:53] pulpit
[1:49:54] but this inspirational message was still
[1:49:56] on him so
[1:49:57] eight hours later he inserted here in as
[1:50:00] paragraph 106 through 111
[1:50:02] he explains this during this evening
[1:50:04] sermon in his presence paragraphs four
[1:50:06] through five so he talks about now you
[1:50:08] got to go back and listen to in his
[1:50:09] presence to see why he put that in there
[1:50:12] now let's see what he did the countdown
[1:50:15] was ten
[1:50:15] nine eight seven six five four
[1:50:18] three two one zero
[1:50:22] blast off but the prophet changes
[1:50:24] something
[1:50:26] let's keep reading now he says uh
[1:50:30] this great orbiting that the church is
[1:50:34] getting ready to do
[1:50:36] amen and the great time of the countdown
[1:50:39] i'd like to explain to you what i think
[1:50:42] the countdown is
[1:50:43] now i think we just been through it uh
[1:50:46] in the church here
[1:50:47] and no and now you notice that when the
[1:50:50] natural astronaut is getting ready to
[1:50:52] leave the earth
[1:50:53] there's a countdown starting from 10
[1:50:56] back to zero
[1:50:57] now i haven't tried to break this
[1:50:59] message down and give it a spiritual
[1:51:01] application
[1:51:02] as as i as it would take too much time
[1:51:05] this morning
[1:51:06] but i want to try to explain this to you
[1:51:07] that 10 is a number of worldliness
[1:51:14] last week we came against
[1:51:17] worldliness come on somebody we're
[1:51:21] making ready
[1:51:22] for the countdown
[1:51:26] 10 is the number of worldliness man
[1:51:30] but seven is the number of god's
[1:51:33] perfection
[1:51:34] six days he made the heavens and earth
[1:51:37] and the seventh he rested
[1:51:38] six thousand years the world is to labor
[1:51:40] against sin or the church labor against
[1:51:42] sin
[1:51:43] and the seventh is the millennium the
[1:51:45] sabbath
[1:51:46] it says seven is god's perfect number
[1:51:48] and now he has given
[1:51:50] us the correct countdown oh jesus
[1:51:54] and his countdown is not ten but seven
[1:52:03] hallelujah that's how i know i'm in the
[1:52:06] orbit church
[1:52:07] i know where i'm standing
[1:52:11] do you realize to be an astronaut you
[1:52:13] got to apply and
[1:52:16] everybody's application is not accepted
[1:52:19] i want to tell you that many a call oh
[1:52:21] hallelujah
[1:52:23] praise god amen amen but few i chose
[1:52:28] them
[1:52:28] and i'm so glad i can say i'm one of
[1:52:30] them
[1:52:34] amen he says but but seven amen uh he
[1:52:38] has given us the correct countdown his
[1:52:39] countdown is not 10 but
[1:52:41] seven we just uh went through it i've
[1:52:43] been through it in seven church ages
[1:52:44] now we find out oh in revelation the
[1:52:47] first countdown was the first age
[1:52:51] i i i he he just i'm just have to read
[1:52:53] it i
[1:52:54] oh lord have mercy i feel so good
[1:52:58] i feel real good the first age the
[1:53:01] second
[1:53:01] countdown the second age see what is he
[1:53:05] saying he said the first age was paul
[1:53:06] and ephesus
[1:53:08] the second was irenaeus a messenger to
[1:53:10] smyrna
[1:53:12] glory to god this is revelation two and
[1:53:14] three now
[1:53:15] explaining that scripture for us martin
[1:53:18] went to pergamos
[1:53:20] praise god columba was the messenger to
[1:53:22] the age of thy terror
[1:53:24] luther was the messenger to sardis amen
[1:53:27] wesley was semester into philadelphia
[1:53:30] william branham was the messenger amen
[1:53:33] to leia
[1:53:36] you see these things already fulfilled
[1:53:37] by scripture
[1:53:39] so you already know what the countdown
[1:53:40] is and our number is not 10
[1:53:43] our number seven ten is worldliness
[1:53:47] amen but seven is perfection
[1:53:54] let's go on it says uh first countdown
[1:53:57] was the first age the second count down
[1:53:59] the second age
[1:54:00] and on to the seventh countdown and here
[1:54:02] visible
[1:54:03] before us as the pictures draw that we
[1:54:06] have this countdown
[1:54:08] the first number counted was ephesus
[1:54:11] the second number counted was smyrna
[1:54:15] then pergamos third tier fifth was
[1:54:17] sardis
[1:54:18] six was philadelphia seventh was laid to
[1:54:20] see in the last church age
[1:54:22] and then then it's the it's the zero
[1:54:24] time
[1:54:27] hallelujah you know even when they hit
[1:54:29] zero time things have to pull away
[1:54:32] in order to allow the ship to go up
[1:54:34] things have to pull away
[1:54:36] come on somebody in order for you to go
[1:54:39] up
[1:54:40] you're gonna have to have some stuff
[1:54:41] pulled away
[1:54:45] and when god is actually delivering you
[1:54:47] from something
[1:54:48] don't go try to get it back
[1:54:50] [Music]
[1:54:53] that argument was for a purpose
[1:54:58] amen that argument was for a purpose god
[1:55:01] allowed that to happen
[1:55:03] so it can pull away oh
[1:55:06] jesus let me go on hallelujah glory to
[1:55:11] god
[1:55:11] amen he says this uh fifth wissard six
[1:55:14] was philadelphia
[1:55:15] and seventh was the laity in the last
[1:55:17] church then is
[1:55:18] zero time for the church to leave
[1:55:22] after the church ages have served their
[1:55:24] term now we know
[1:55:25] the authoritarian age has come and gone
[1:55:28] and ephesians age has come and gone
[1:55:30] the philadelphian age has come and gone
[1:55:32] and we are in the seventh church age at
[1:55:34] the
[1:55:34] end of it the leaders in age and that is
[1:55:40] the countdown that
[1:55:43] is the countdown
[1:55:47] church i'll tell you what when we can
[1:55:48] see these things according to scripture
[1:55:50] we know exactly where we're standing
[1:55:52] and this is why the scripture tells us
[1:55:54] as the bribe we have to make ourselves
[1:55:56] ready
[1:55:57] because we know it's not much longer
[1:55:59] it's not much longer we
[1:56:00] are at zero time and let me tell you
[1:56:03] when you have zero time you not coming
[1:56:04] to the shuttle
[1:56:08] that's not when you come get in the van
[1:56:09] and try to come to the shuttle or you

[1:56:19] ready
[1:56:20] you gotta and notice this you gotta make
[1:56:22] yourself ready
[1:56:26] you know the suit that probably fit one
[1:56:28] of the men
[1:56:29] wouldn't fit one of the women she had to
[1:56:32] have a different suit
[1:56:34] amen one customized for her praise the
[1:56:37] lord so you better you we got to make
[1:56:39] ready church this is the most important
[1:56:41] thing i can tell you today make

[1:56:49] god bless you
[1:56:56] glory let's pray church
[1:56:59] oh hallelujah
[1:57:02] father i just thank you for your word
[1:57:07] the angel uh told the prophet pick up
[1:57:10] his pen and write
[1:57:12] and as he wrote he wrote about the bride
[1:57:17] the word and the bribe and it just wrote
[1:57:19] these things and god how
[1:57:20] it was put in there that we'd be making
[1:57:23] ready predestinated
[1:57:24] even though the the words of the prophet
[1:57:27] would be rejected by denominations
[1:57:30] many coming against them many say that
[1:57:32] he was
[1:57:33] uh the supernatural was good but his
[1:57:36] doctrine was wrong
[1:57:38] they're coming against the truth they
[1:57:40] don't understand
[1:57:41] it goes against their common thinking it
[1:57:43] goes against the things that they've
[1:57:44] been taught
[1:57:46] and father this is why they they miss it
[1:57:48] they miss it because they can't
[1:57:50] die to those things but lord you've
[1:57:52] helped us to be able to see
[1:57:54] right in the scripture how you have
[1:57:55] manifested yourself
[1:57:57] the same way that we can believe moses
[1:58:00] lord was the prophet to the children of
[1:58:03] israel
[1:58:05] my god the same week we can believe paul
[1:58:07] was
[1:58:08] used as the messenger to the first
[1:58:10] church
[1:58:12] oh oh glory amen and uh father and see
[1:58:16] how he wrote two-thirds of the new
[1:58:17] testament god he was the messenger that
[1:58:19] you used
[1:58:20] to the new testament church he was the
[1:58:22] first one that you called out
[1:58:24] we can believe those things we also are
[1:58:27] able to go
[1:58:28] further and believe that you sent
[1:58:30] william branham
[1:58:32] to restore us oh god back to the truth
[1:58:35] that has been lost throughout the ages
[1:58:38] god luther came with a message to tell
[1:58:40] the catholic church that they were wrong
[1:58:41] he stood up against
[1:58:42] it put his 95 thesis on the door and and
[1:58:45] stood against it and
[1:58:47] god there was when we heard those things
[1:58:49] just in our history lessons we knew
[1:58:50] there was something about this man
[1:58:52] coming to find out he was a messenger
[1:58:55] god john wesley comes along and he
[1:58:57] realizes uh
[1:58:58] luther had the justification to just
[1:59:00] should live by faith
[1:59:02] oh buddy they did not have
[1:59:03] sanctification they were still living in
[1:59:05] sin
[1:59:06] and and john wesley said no it's going
[1:59:08] to take more than that we got to have a
[1:59:10] sanctified life hallelujah
[1:59:13] oh god he just began to carry the church
[1:59:15] a little further
[1:59:16] amen through the message that he
[1:59:18] preached but then god the pentecostals
[1:59:20] came along after after john wesley with
[1:59:22] the methodist and
[1:59:23] the pentecostals wanting to see a
[1:59:24] restoration of the gifts
[1:59:26] god they saw it amen it manifests itself
[1:59:29] the
[1:59:30] power of god so strong even on the susan
[1:59:32] street god that
[1:59:33] amen they thought fire that the building
[1:59:35] was on fire but come to
[1:59:37] come to find out it's just the fire that
[1:59:38] was in the building inside the people
[1:59:40] making it look like that
[1:59:42] they saw the restoration of gifts but
[1:59:44] lord when they organized and denominated
[1:59:47] that's when you left it and you kept
[1:59:48] moving forward
[1:59:50] god now you have some people on the
[1:59:51] earth that god they they believe in
[1:59:53] justification they believe in
[1:59:55] sanctification
[1:59:56] they believe in the gifts but they also
[1:59:58] believe in the restored word that has
[2:00:00] come
[2:00:01] amen to them god we are those people and
[2:00:04] we
[2:00:05] are in the orbit thank you god that
[2:00:08] you've called us to this place
[2:00:10] thank you god that you let us hear your
