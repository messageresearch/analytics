thee you have said it is vain to serve God and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts [Music] and now we call the proud happy yay they that work wickedness are set up yea they that tempt God or even deliver this right here was a little precious to me it says then they that fear the lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that fear the lord and that thought upon his name then God turns around and says and they shall be mine saith the Lord of hosts in the day in that day when I make up my jewels in a jewel a good wife is a jewel in a man's crowd so on a day that he is making up his bride and they shall be mine said the Lord of hosts and that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not amen let's Empower his [Music] Heavenly Father we're so grateful Lord God to stand before you this morning as the jewels of your crown Lord this is the day Lord that you

Jesus [Applause] foreign [Applause] enjoying the presence of the Lord and uh I don't know about y'all but I like coming to church and having Church you know it's just something about you know the Saints clapping their hands and uh you know they got into that some of that old time songs and and they've been bringing presents of the presence of the Lord for years at the cross at the cross and I think we got a little uh uh what was that uh I'll Fly Away good God online uh but you know just just hearing them hand clap what they call foot stomping hand clap type songs it's uh it it bring a presence and uh now was that Abby yeah [Music] appreciate that sister Abby and uh that just kind of brought some of the new uh updated you know uh songs to us and you know and just set it up real well for sisters to reach so we just kept climbing higher so I I like that I like that I like that I like that praise the Lord um good to have all the saints in the house of the Lord amen and um uh I will uh I won't I won't take too much your time but uh brother Solomon shared the testimony of the sister that came through the prayer line while we were there and uh Indiana and you know I remember her coming through and just saying she had this growth and she just wanted to be prayed for and you know the sermon that morning that was preached was somewhere between here and there and uh so she had a an appointment to go see the doctor um in order to try to get this thing taken care of but you know at church and the doctor's appointment God God met her yeah God met her and uh and you know I was I mean I remember in that sermon I I there's a quote that the Lord added to it right before I I ministered on it and uh it was a quote where brother random say um um um pretty much we we expect the supernatural we look for god um that we could talk to and that'll talk back to us Amen in the Supernatural way and uh you know and we were just kind of highlighting that and I said you know we we've seen that God at um at church of the open door but I want to say we've seen that God at Spirit through Tabernacle amen as well and uh and I wanted to just encourage because uh uh when God does things like that we know that the I like to say it like this that the Angels trouble in the water and and I don't know what people's situations and circumstances are uh but God knows what you're going through and um and and I just want to pause just for a second to say this that you know um oftentimes you might see that I don't do like um you know when people come up and be prayed for but I'm not against that I want y'all to know I'm not against that I want you always welcome to be prayed for if you got something you're dealing with and uh you just get it to me or you get to the Deacon brother Troy and say hey I need to be prayed for the day right we will we will anoint you with oil amen we will lay hands on you and we will expect God to move on your behalf amen amen amen whatever you need yeah yeah God's got it whatever you need God's got it so uh but I want just kind of pause and say that I know you know we've been in this little series of teaching but I've just been asking the Lord that even in the midst of that still visit vindicate your word with your presence and uh just move in the midst of people we need more of God we need feelings we need refillings we need deliverance we need all kind of things so uh we we just we just want the Lord just to have his way amen amen amen so praise the Lord I'm not going to uh prolong the time and uh good to see Brothers amen [Applause] you know so Stephen is this a relative your son so good to have yourself [Applause] I know you have a name what's your name brother Mario good to have you with us brother Mario amen amen all I can say and Mama didn't set you up mama didn't set you up for this but this was a great service for you to attend today amen amen we've been in a little series Amen on a family series and we we started with the fathers amen the husbands uh because husbands have to be first partakers and then we came down to uh the wives on last week amen and talking about uh submission and everything and uh and then I told it that the the young people after I finished with your mama and I finished with your dad and I'm coming to you here we are so we got to talk about the children today amen and let's read the word of the Lord uh for those that are working the the computer slot 47 is actually where I'm starting at amen there you go wonderful um and those of you that have your Bibles uh just um turn it to Ephesians chapter six and um before we would just get started here let's just have a word of Prayer amen amen sounds like it's just my hearts might be a little bit too much so amen father we are grateful for the opportunity to come into the house of the Lord and to feel the presence of God we have been blessed oh God by the song service Lord the singers as well as the musicians and got each one and their role helping to take us deeper into the presence of the Lord it makes a difference when it's not just a gift but when there's oil flowing through the gift uh it makes a tremendous difference whether singing or whether it's playing the oil God means everything so we ask Lord that uh you just continue to bless amen these singers and musicians that you continue to keep them that you'll watch over them that they would understand the importance of what they do uh to a service it just opens the entrance for the word of God to come forth without hindrance so father we pray that you would just take control of our thoughts as we just begin to minister from what you've given us for the church for this season I pray that you would use it for your glory and for your honor help us to draw closer to you father through your word and uh we uh we just commit more the the remainder of this service into your hands and um I pray for the brothers Lord just working there with the sound that you would just continue to give them wisdom and Direction and uh we we expect the enemy to try to fight us somewhere but uh we claim victory and then of everything that he does so God be glorified and magnified and exalted in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord Ephesians chapter 6 amen verse 1 through 3 the Bible uh declares amen um children obey your parents and I love the way Paul puts this it's in the Lord Amen in the Lord that's very very important uh because if you've got a parent that's leading you to do things that's outside the Lord then you've got to put God first amen you always put God first so he says this uh children obey your parents in the Lord uh uh for this is right honor thy father and mother and and I like the way Paul puts that too because we have a lot of people today that honor mother and forget that Mama can have you by herself so the Bible says honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise the promise is not effective if you're only doing half of it amen it's a quite already Lord I'm just reading the Bible uh verse 3 that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth last week we had this little diagram on the screen uh for headship and the way that family the biblical order of the family I found this online and you can see Christ is the head of the family it's got to be Christ and uh and then underneath that god holds the husband responsible Adam was responsible for what happened in the Garden of Eden when when Eve fell God did not come down and ask for Eve read the Bible he says Adam Adam Where Art Thou and it was after Adam fell with Eve right so god holds the husband or the father respect responsible for the family then the wife comes underneath that submission to the husband as he submitted to Christ and then underneath that are the children uh and all they're required to do is love and obey their parents and remember I mentioned last week sometimes the children trying to move up to the same level as the bomb or as the same levels of death and and I like I said last week if you're gonna move up to that level it ain't God's order but if you're gonna do it then you're gonna protect wow you're gonna get yourself a job and we gonna eat your groceries you're gonna pay for the lights how are you gonna pay for the water y'all y'all young people know that water they all taking a bath in somebody paying for that every month when you're gonna flip on a light switch and boom the light come on that didn't happen just to happen somebody paid for that to happen and if your parents let you see the bills if you just saw the cost of the bill yo yo yo your job your job wouldn't handle it amen another scripture real quick here Colossians 3 20. it says this children obey your parents and all things this is well pleasing unto the Lord you may be seated and then children will be your parents and all things for this is well pleasing to the Lord let me um let's just kind of start here uh just a couple statements amen and scriptures that I want to read uh next for me some of the challenges that we have here in our world today especially when it comes to children or band and parents if there is a I mentioned it last week when it comes to why I've submitted to the husband there's a spirit that has come into the land that uh is that challenges the wives sometime you know and their role in submission it challenges them because they you know why somehow wives have to work and that's understandable you know they I mean we live in a very very expensive area of the world and uh so I would not come up here and say don't work I would say this if you if you can afford not to do it it's a great thing especially when you got children at home and you're raising children it's a great thing after the children are gone there's nothing wrong with you oh Lord nothing wrong with you getting a job after the children are gone amen amen but why the children are there I understand you want to be there to raise your kids they want to be involved in their life if you can do that that's great I would never put pressure on anybody to try to force them to do that I wouldn't I wouldn't preach preach it that way you'd be led of God as a family uh there's also a spirit in the land that's kind of coming against the children uh we live in a we live in a society where children are taking their parents to court it hasn't happened to me yet and and I and and I'm glad it hadn't but but my question is if if you taking me to court who paying for it I'm gonna pay for you to take me to court you ain't coming back home with me let the court take care of you from here on out all right but but we're living in a society where they've been enabled to do these types of things I think somebody sued their parents over not wanting to go to church this is when the Bible tells us to train up a child the way that they should go and when they get old they want to depart right we we have a responsibility to take our kids to church Amen brother Brandon even said and we don't have Sunday school say but we're going to have Sunday School going again and when Sunday School going Paris you're not supposed to amen just send your kids to Sunday school amen you got to take them you got to bring them to Sunday school come on somebody you got to be involved in this but but we're living in a society where just everything is kind of coming against the kids they they they they they they they they they get information from places that they probably shouldn't get it from especially not the Bible they make they may hear something in school some child say they did something to their parent and and now you feel like you you know and you don't realize there's a spirit just jumped on you because it ain't gonna happen at our house I remember my my kids was we were out somewhere and uh somebody some child did something today mama and just embarrassed her and my daughters looked at me and say Daddy if we I mean right there if we did that I'd be going to jail if you did what that kid just did in public I'll be going to jail over you amen and I'm gonna tell you like this I will be smiling in jail because I'm gonna make sure if I'm going to jail it's gonna be worth it now [Applause] I got all that but but my kids feel like you know and they see these things or they hear some child say something you feel like you feel like you can do the same no you can't do that that that's against scriptural principles and one of the scripture tells us II Timothy 3 verse one through four this know also that in last days perilous dangerous perilous times shall come dangerous times uh for men shall be lovers of their own selves this is why we take selfies that word was not even found in our dictionary until this age men shall be lovers of their own selves amen Covetous boasters proud blasphemers and look at this one disobedient to parents so this is a spirit that comes in this this time and we're dealing with the spirit right not only that they unthankful just just you know just as simple somebody you know at the you you're walking into a store and there's a door that has to be open for you to get in and somebody stop and just open the door for you you just walk right in and don't say nothing so my my daughter's got this little thing they say they feel like just grabbing you when you do that somebody do they just grab and pull him back on the other side no now let's try this again when you walk through this time realize the door wasn't open by itself it's not an automatic though this is this is me actually putting some effort in and the least you can say yeah yeah right thank you all right I'm thankful Unholy spirits that you find young people want to dress a certain way you don't realize it's an Unholy spirit that is actually attacking you and causing you to want to dress that way it's an Unholy spirit that enters into the land and it's perfect prophesied for this day and your parents are always going against you but no you can't look like that you can't dress like that tie this down because the spirits that we fighting I'm thankful Unholy and see when it when internet Unholy Spirit get on you now it's easy for you to move into the disobedient to parents it's easy because one Spirit gonna try to open up a door for another spirit here are the other thing to say without natural affection truce Breakers I mean they Liars uh false accusers incontinent now and what what in concert I mean I want you to get this I want you to get this I underlined it see this right here incontinent what that actually means is no self-control we got young people with no self-control you need the Holy Ghost to help you control yourself control your mouth even you got to control what you think everything you think don't have to come out your mouth truth everything you're thinking got to come out your mouth actually you'll learn as you get older you got the whole some of that stuff in if I told people everything I thought in concert means no self-control fears these are spirits the spouses of those that are good traitors heady you know it all right these are the spirits and look you don't know more than your parents you just was born yesterday you don't know more than your parents people that's been here for for 30 40 50 60 years they don't went through a lot you can learn from them Traders had a high-minded levels of pleasure more than lovers of God these are the spirits that we fight nowadays next uh the prophet says this the teenage kids took over the world he says now you know that the Bible predicts that unthankful and holy without natural affection so this teenagers taking over the world that's that scripture in second Timothy three uh teenagers taking over the world teenagers teenagers right and it says now uh and anybody that's been a teenage you know you ain't know nothing when you was a teenager and let me tell you something about about just just this real quick teenaging is the shortest span of your life so you can you can be a child from 0 to 12. you can be a teenager from 13 to 19. six years 12 years as a child six years as a teenager and then 20 on adult so it's the shortest time period where you got to make the most adjustments in that time period so it's very important to understand you learning during that time you're not an adult yet right amen you're not an adult yet and if you make bad decisions during that time it actually affect you the rest of your life if you make good decisions during that teenage time it actually affects you the rest of your life so good seeds while you're a teenager [Applause] because good things will come up if you just go back look at where you are right now your young adults look at where you are right now and look back what you did when you was a teenager are you still stuck in those years because you're supposed to you're supposed to be moving forward now hello brother Branham says this he says um you know that the Bible predicts that I'm thankful and holy without natural affections truce Breakers false accused is disobedient to the parents seeing teenage teenage taking over the world and it's done it I went into a place the other day they was playing this one of these old dirty jukeboxes all that stuff I didn't even want to take my family so there's just music that they was playing in in this uh in this establishment brother Brandon said he didn't want to take his family now let me tell y'all something the music that they was playing in brother branham's day ain't got nothing on the music that y'all fighting today amen all that stuff I didn't want to take my family I said to the lady how much does them records cost 10 cents a piece says how many how many will it play in an hour she told me I said here's the money unplug it I pay for an hour to unplug this thing just so my family can eat well she said I couldn't do that them kids come in here to play that says dinner then brother Ram said then I couldn't spend my money there I went somewhere else you know parents like y'all need to understand that and don't don't don't don't just brush over that too quickly you realize that sometimes you go into these environments they play that music something get deposited into your child some get deposited to your child and before you know a day at home looking with them lyrics and Spears get on them amen amen all right Hallelujah you gotta you gotta stay prayerful prayer with those kids but Spirit Spears everywhere they go to school and Spirits they they go to the mall in spirit everywhere you go is spirits all right so I went somewhere else see well that stuff would make you nervous you have to go down and get a bunch of tranquilizers to take after hearing the crazy stuff that's just like a Christian uh that's that's just irks a Christian if you like that kind of stuff you know what's wrong with you you need to get saved because what's in you is feeding on something besides the words praise the lord we don't want to be feeding on something besides the word all right this next uh statement here in the message leadership brother Branham makes a statement says you know Jesus loves Little Children You know he does and there was a little boy one time named Moses we're going to talk about him just a little bit and he was a very fine says you know what made him help make him a fine boy he says um he had a good mother to raise him see that's what she taught him about the Lord and you little boys and girls has got the same kind of mothers to raise you teach you about the Lord just mind them obey them just just mind your mama mind your daddy and mind your business just mind them says you know what the first commandment is in the Bible the first commandment was promised with a promise maybe a little hard for you to understand these Commandments the first commandment is not to have any other God but him but the great commandment and the first commandment that has a promise to it see is to the children do you know did you know that uh that he said children obey your parents a man which may lengthen lengthen the days upon the Earth that the Lord that God has given thee to mind your parents and do what you're doing it may give you longer life I'll put it this way you die early by not obeying your parents and honoring them a lot of people you see living a long life when I when I see a person in the 80s 90s you know 100 years old I I first thing I said how was your relationship with your parents even if they're not even safe how was your relationship with your parents how did you treat your parents I mean there's a promise that goes with people that honor their parents all right look at this tomorrow your parents and do what you're doing it may give you a longer life on the earth that the Lord has given you more time to serve him I hope today that I'm looking at a bunch of preachers and singers and evangelists of the day that is to come if there is a day after hours now uh as we go forward here I wanted to you know just go back Amen to the Ten Commandments because this is where Paul gets his instructions for us to honor our father and our mother this is coming from what Moses was given by God to give to the people of God God only gave the people 10 rules to live by ten and they couldn't do them ten right and and one of those 10 rules was just honor your parents and that's that's the origination and stuff I didn't want to just go back and just get the honor the parents I want to give all 10 Commandments let's read the first uh first ones here Exodus 3 verse of Exodus 20 verse 3 through 16 is where we find it now the first one is found here in Exodus 20 verse 3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me it's the first commandment God has given us Thou shalt have no other gods before me God wants to be first in your life amen number the the second one Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the Earth verse 5 says Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the Lord God am a jealous God Amen visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me now I want you to get back the iniquity a man was visited on the third and fourth generation so things that you do now can impact Generations after you y'all didn't get it yeah but things you the decisions you make right now can impact three or four generations not just your children but your grandchildren and your great-grandchildren right amen verse six ensure Mercy unto thousands amen of them that love me and keep thy keep my Commandments verse 7 thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain why people don't forgot this there's certain curse words that people use that take the name of the Lord in vain every day and Christians used to be offended by that and you know what you know what people would actually say don't take the lord's name in vain we need to bring that back out don't use that type of don't you take the lord's name in vain thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain for the Lord will not hold him Guiltless that taketh his name in vain verse 8 says remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy we forgot about that one that's why I said I had to go back young people the reason that your parents would actually get a job where you don't have to work on Sundays I encourage my kids go to Chick-fil-A work at Chick-fil-A I don't want to work there I look that I don't them people honor Sunday [Music] and you never got to worry about trying to get time off on Sunday hello somebody you never gotta go to that job if you need a job go there and work they need people you see how long them lives be they need people but when you're young you can do these things honor the Lord remember the Sabbath day find a job where you don't have to work on Sunday and and if you got one that but it requires you make sure you let them know out now and work on Sundays now I'm gonna tell you when you tell them that they're gonna try you they gonna try you and then they're going to schedule for something they're going to see what you're gonna do about it now I got many of of saints in here that don't quit jobs any anybody don't quit a job because they made you work Sunday I got Saints here they don't quit over that and you want to know why they quit because they honoring this remember the Sabbath day keep it holy and I can go a little further with that because back in the day y'all know what the Sabbath day keep it holy you can do nothing you didn't go out you you stay home you just went to church any y'all from them days that's what keep it holy men you didn't do nothing you didn't go to work you didn't you didn't play either go outside and play I'm Not the day not today you don't go outside and play on Sunday that's the way it was when I was coming up we had to keep it holy now if you can't keep a day holy how you're gonna keep the rest of you only remember the Sabbath day keep a holy six days shall thy labor and do all by work verse 10 says the next for the seven days of Sabbath day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God in it Thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy man's servant nor thy mate servant nor that cattle nor that stranger that is within thy Gates so as a father I mean if I'm honoring the Sabbath day I want my kids honored I might have to tell you guys to quit that job as a daddy and I have to advise you so we don't have to have this argument I know you want money in your pocket fill out an application at Chick-fil-A they selling chicken they say Hobby Lobby too that's another one anybody closed on Sundays go straight there get you a job all right amen for in six days the Lord made heavens and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the Lord blessed to Sabbath day and hallowed it verse 12 Anna thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee Thou shalt not kill thou should not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor these are the Ten Commandments that God gave us to live by and we're still living by them amen we still honor God in all of these ways amen a reminder next I believe in anything that helps the human race is Godly I'm just reading the underlying part because you already read the rest of it you got to look at anything sensible I was thinking through this this sermon and I was kind of talking um with uh my mom my wife and my uh my sister and I was just saying you know just as a pastor you know I know that these things in scripture and just over the years uh listening to different people preach you know on sermons like this oftentimes I couldn't find a good practical way to uh uh apply what was being preached I know the Bible say this but how does that what does that look like practically and then you know what are like some things that I could do in order to make that live right and um you know and then just listen different different different ministers I never really got that so what I what I this quote kind of set me free because I realized that I wasn't just limited to just looking at the message to try to find out to how to apply there's other people that focus on this there's Ministries like like when it comes to family Ministries y'all know Dr James Dobson that man that man had that that's what God gave him that's his lot and uh and focus on the family if if ain't none of y'all ever heard it before I know I have and it was a help to me when I was raising kids when I put on Adventures in Odyssey y'all ain't gonna talk to me but it's the truth I bought CDs I bought the CDs I would put them in that car and I let them kids go down the street for hours just listening to Adventures enough they knew the address by the heart of that place they they it helped and they were Godly lessons that just they helped praise the Lord somebody right you know so so sometimes there's people out there that that might they study these things they that's their focus and and you can gather information from them all I tell you to do is that when you get information always filter it filter it through the message right and if you can filter through the messaging you know you got yourself something good just look at things sensibly we got some sensible things that we want to look at today here this next uh who is from a gentleman by the name he I was just looking at his name is Tim Challis I don't know him I just happen to be read some information online and I like what I was reading his name Tim Charles now somebody else might go dig this man up and say brother Jack you know Tim challenge is distant no I don't know I didn't know that but it did have some good information praise the Lord he wrote a little article about six practical practical ways to honor your parents and he he quoted from a gentleman by the name of Tim Kelly says as Tim Keller says it's respect for parents that is the basis for every other kind of respect and every other kind of authority can I put it this way if your kids won't respect you they ain't gonna respect their teachers if your kids won't respect you they ain't gonna respect they boss if your kids won't respect you they ain't gonna respect the pastor and then respect starts at home and you got to keep your children in check exactly right respect starts at home and it starts when they real young don't wait for them to get old to try to establish some respect when they Young no no make sure they understand no that's right yeah amen we haven't we have a responsibility right I mean kids now they they you know uh they go against the police and against Authority against I mean it's it's it's a messed up world so respect for parents that is the basis for every other kind of respect and every other count of authority the next statement says we are to honor our parents in childhood and adulthood I like what this man's saying for we owe them a debt of Honor That Never Ends some of the things we're going to talk about today is for childhood and adulthood all right the next one says uh I understand that in some cases showing honor may be very difficult or very nearly impossible we want to talk about that today so how do we honor how do we on the first one says speak well of them the next one says seek their wisdom third one says esteem them publicly and privately the fourth one is uh oh uh miss my t support them support them support them support them is what I meant to say but support them the fifth one is forgive them and then the sixth one is provide for them six practical ways that you can honor your parents and you know I'm not just gonna leave six things sitting there like that for y'all we're gonna dig in y'all ready speak well of them Exodus 21 and 17 says he that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death so according to scripture we weren't supposed to speak ill things about our parents now sometimes it's okay to tell the truth brother Brandon had to tell the truth about his daddy his daddy was a drunk and he had to tell this is my family history it's but but he also was saying but I love my daddy the next verse here in proverbs 30 and 11 says there is a generation that curse of their father and doth not bless their mother you are living in a day where that happens quite often so it's spirits that you're fighting here the next verse says in Leviticus 29 for everyone that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death he that cursed his father's mother his blood shall be upon him now hearing this message brother Brandon preaches it right here in West Palm Beach it says but when I was just a little lad he met my mother my mother's from uh Paris Texas my father was from Kentucky and so my dad was there breaking horses when he uh in a rodeo when he got when he met mother and so they were married and mama was only 15 years old when I was born she was just a kid and pop was 18. but I but I used to want to be like my daddy I just loved my daddy he wasn't a Christian until a little bit before he died I led him to Christ but he was Irish through and through and a real Drinker and no matter what he did hello somebody no matter what he did I don't care what he did he's my daddy anyhow I like that and brother Branham had a dad at one time that took him out amen with some other another man and I think there was going fishing or going somewhere and and the man pulled out a bottle and offered it to uh brother Brown's father so you know you want to take a drink and um and then um uh while they're sitting there passing that bottle they offered it to brother Branham and uh and and and his daddy said uh you know he's the he's the only one my boys that don't drink or something like that he said he he the only his daddy call him assist brother Adam said give me that pop he took it but conviction came home he was not able to drink that drink even though his daddy called sister hello I'ma say this because in that day he could call him that and brother Bill Branham didn't get offended by what his daddy said but nowadays if a dad says something like that to his son Hallelujah there's an offense taken but but here brother Branham had to resolved that no matter what my daddy has done I still love him he's my dad I don't care what he's done he's my dad anyhow and that's the attitude that young people this is my dad you respect I I I was not raised by my biological father I wasn't raised I was raised by a stepfather but I learned throughout my years that I still had to have respect for the man that brought me into this world and one day I had a chance to just sit down and talk to him and he started going through some things and going and this happened I said a little little I don't even need to know about all that it's too late for that right now so but I'm gonna tell you something I I respect my step daddy because he's the one that put food on the table and got me and made me the man that I am right now it was him that did that I always respect him I say but I respect you because you're the one that brought me into this world and when he died I was the one that had to go preach his funeral I actually had to preach my step daddy and my my my biological father's funeral within a matter of 30 days and and I wasn't my my biological I was on his deathbed and I wasn't even planning to even go see him like well I don't know you know what I can do from here and it was my stepdad that came here so you need to go see your dad and I'm sitting there ready to tell him my daddy is here he's no no no no no you need to go see your daddy and because he said it my boss had told me the same thing I told my boss no I'll be to work tomorrow but because my my daddy said it it meant a little bit more a little bit more weight dropped I mean I got a ticket real quick went up to Alabama saw my daddy and got a chance to see him before he passed away and I thank God thank God when I got there didn't know his church wasn't going to bury him or nothing they didn't want nothing to do with him because he was living in sin I say it just so happened your son is preaching and I can bury you and I would have been preached psalm 23. hey Hallelujah all of them speak well of them speak well of them all right next seek there wisdom she's looking at this in the Book of Proverbs 24 times you will see a man in that book where Solomon uses the word my son my son my son amen and this gentleman you know Tim Challis they made a statement here when we honor our parents when we seek their wisdom uh uh uh through life's twists and terms uh the Bible constantly Associates you youth with a Folly and age with wisdom and tells us that those who have lived longer lives have generally accumulated greater wisdom so this is why you want to seek their wisdom here Proverbs 1 8 says my son here the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother now I know I say my son but you can also put my daughter in there too Proverbs chapter 3 verse 1 through 2 the next one says my son or my daughter forget not my law but let thine heart keep my Commandments I'm trying to tell you something amen for the length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee amen the next one in Proverbs this is where we see him talking to a daughter amen proverbs 31 29-30 but now she's this daughter has grown up to become a wife many daughters have done virtuously now before she could be somebody's wife she had to be a good daughter at home many daughters have done virtuously but thou Excellence them all favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that theareth the Lord she shall be praised and let me tell you her fear don't start when she get married a woman that fears the Lord she starts that relationship with God in her daddy and mama's house she she she she builds that character underneath their roof with she can be obedient to her parents it'll be much easier for her to also if she can subject herself to her parents it'll be easier to subject herself to her husband all right brother Brandon says this in the message leadership he says the first is the mother's kindness then the father's word and after the mother gives you your first step then you look to your daddy he says all of us do that after mama gives the first step you look to your daddy for wisdom because he's the head of the house and he usually not that not that he he's any smarter but he's just made a leader of his family God put certain qualities in that man and as a wife you got to pull out those qualities praise the Lord out of your husband but God put certain qualities in that and and the husband certain experiences he gonna go through if if the family is in God's order daddy going out to work Mama's at home taking care of the kids raising the kids daddy gonna go through things on the job that he gonna learn some lessons one of the things daddy should learn is that when things get tough on the job you know just jump up and quit no you don't do that you want to know why Mouse we got mouths of feet so you know you have to kind of swallow your pride so daddy gonna have to learn some of those things and then when it's time for the kids to come up I just had this happen amen just the other day my my son-in-law he was man he was worked up about a little something he come to the house and and uh and he was he had a client and the client was having him do this and have him do that but he wanted to do this his passion was just showing off through it and uh and as he was going and you know he's talking a little bit to my wife and I was just listening in the other room I heard him I just came out there and I said you know what it sound like to me is that he just wants you to take his money that's all he want he just he don't want your ideas he just want to give you money yeah push your ideas to the side and take the man money that's why he just want to pay you he don't he don't need no input he just even if it don't work he still want to pay you that's good you know what you got miles to feed [Applause] don't quit don't quit take the money smile and take the money one day you'll get a chance to share your ideas but now you need to swallow your pride and take the money and when I said that to my son-in-law he said you know what I just weren't looking at it like that Mr Jack I didn't I didn't I didn't see it that way thank you for sharing certain things Daddy go through that he can share with this family that'll help them but you gotta you got to be open to listening to Daddy my son hear the instructions I'm just telling you just to tell you I've been through this been through this this is how I became a man then you look to your daddy all of us for wisdom because he's the head of the house and he usually not that he's any smarter but it's just made a leader of his family so we follow what our daddy says do when he says now son I would like for you to do a certain certain thing then we listen to him because it's wisdom that we listen now I'm you know when we were coming up we lived in you know lived in the house my daddy had lawnmowers and we had to cut that grass that was just part of living there you you living here you you help out here chores our responsibilities that you make sure your kids have chores make sure they do their chores make sure there's punishments if they don't do it but when they get of age also set yourself uh give them some money for an allowance put some money in their pocket teach them how to pay tax if they get ten dollars put a dollar in times teach them how to pay tithes at a very young age then they won't struggle when they get older amen and I ain't got no responsibility to teach them how to pay times amen my dad used to have us doing different things and you know I used to cut that grass and get out there we had to learn how to cut that grass different lawnmowers we have we have to learn how to do it and I got to the point where he said now when I get older I'ma live in a neighborhood where they gonna take care of this for me so I don't have no lawnmower in my in my house I complain when people don't come cut that's that's just the way I want it to live now if our Lord would have blessing with sons I might have been a different story because I had to teach them some things but I want to put my girls out there like they got other things to take care of amen amen said I'd like for you to do a certain certain thing then we listen to them because it's wisdom we listen see he's learned a whole lot we got to ask him to see what he learned and then we can profit by by his what he's learned he tells us now don't go and do this because I did that my father told me not to do it but I did it and it caused this to happen to me something bad so we see well then daddy tells us how to do and what to do right so you got your mama and you got your daddy Mama there uh with a kindness sweetness of gentleness but just you go to your daddy to get some wisdom to get some advice from things amen from him things that not to do and what to do your daddy can get in about especially when they come to work all right um this says esteem them publicly and privately now just on on the right side I I meant to just hold it in but on the right side this guy uh Tim Sally said parents long to see how they have impacted their children how their children are a reflection of their strengths their values you don't realize how important it is to give them credit where you can parents want to know how they've impacted their own children parents need to hear from their children something good not always bad you wouldn't let me go to here you wouldn't let me go no no no no no no what was the good part of that what did I save you from there's a minute says because you didn't let me go here I didn't end up in jail and you know they had a man they had a shooting at that party the other night because you didn't let me go thank you Mama thank you Dad because you didn't let me go I'm still here with you parents need to hear that because the devil fight us as parents like maybe too tough maybe you just make no no we try to do the best we can let me tell you ain't no book on raising children somebody said you got the Bible you ain't got no children you ain't got no children I I got the Bible and I'm using the Bible but but you know you you also dealing with spirits right and when you get dealing with Spirits you gotta navigate figure out how to how to work with this child come on somebody I I you see on a service like this I get a lot of eight minutes from the parents but the kids wait for me please I can't wait for the sermon to be over oh I'm so oh Lord I I told you it was coming how come you're one prepared for this esteem them publicly and privately this this this this gentleman made a a statement you can say things like um you know everything I I really learned about saving money I learned it from you you know Dad that was one thing you always taught me that I really really appreciated so these are simple measures but ones that bring great joy and honor to your parents find something that you can give credit to your parents about something your daddy did some of your mama did find something you can honor them with here you know uh I wanna just inject this uh when it says esteemed in public and probably I thought about something that happened Amen in our household one a couple things that that was a blessing to me uh when we were younger we didn't understand we were going to church but we didn't have no relationship with God and Mama just gotten saved and man she was sold out for God so not for God and I remember you know we were uh in the house and it was dinner time and why nothing being cooked and we're trying to figure out what's going on and where's Mama we know oh where Mom at and um daddy would never tell us where mama was we didn't know what mama was like we now the cars out there where's Mama you know and ain't nothing being cooked mama daddy that is Mama around what where mama at Daddy just want to say nothing all of a sudden we went outside and I don't know how we figured it out we were looking at every car we could his mama's just in the car mama was in the van praying something more important than our dinner was mama in the van friend and I'm gonna tell you this to this day I'm glad I caught my mama prayer some kids catch their mama doing all kind of other stuff but I caught my mama praying for her family publicly and privately we esteem our parents privately we had a moment right before my bad pass we were in the hospital and um all of us kids that gathered around and I told the kids to say hey you know what this is an opportunity for us my dad is with us we're gonna all bless him each one of us are going to bless our father before he leaves this and I mean he was alert he could hear us and I said we're going to start from the oldest to the youngest but each person can get a chance just to bless Daddy tell him what you appreciate him for so when my daddy goes on the other side he gonna go with a big smile his children appreciated him and my brother Troy started out the blessing he he let it flow and then I came next and then my sister Gina then my sister Trina then my youngest brother Vaughn all five of us right there around his bed just blessing him that's peace you leave this you leave this earth with peace when things like that so we esteemed him publicly asking him publicly and privately brother Branham says this in the message Mother's Day says but I might pass just along to the young people do you know Abraham Lincoln never owned a book in his life until he was after 21 years old but the Bible and the fox book of the martyrs see what you read molds the character that you are no wonder we got a bunch of neurotics today little old fiction magazines and vulgar nonsense is placed upon our newsstands he owned the Bible and the fox's book of Martyrs look what it made him now now when brother Rams say look what it made him because now notice this the fox book of Martyrs is telling the story of people that were martyred for their faith Abraham Lincoln lost his life for what he believed he believed that no man should be a Slave and he stood up for he stood up stood up against it stood up for it and what he did he ended up losing his life over but he was shaped by what he read the Bible and Fox's book of marks look what it made him but in the face of all that one day he made a statement like this is if there could be any good thing found in me this is him publicly esteeming his mother if there's any good thing found to me it's because of a Godly mother that reared him to serve the Lord you know I oftentimes on the job when I was working I see a lady coming amen I'll always hold the door open for that lady I always hold the door and nowadays people open the door and they you know somebody coming right behind you and you just let the door close enough and I don't let you see him with stuff in their hand trying to trying to get you just let the dough close in their face no I I would hold the door open I hold the door open and and also said you know you're a real gentleman I said you know what it's because of the way my parents raised me we use terms like yes sir and yes ma'am oh you ain't old enough to call me by first name put a brother on that put a sister on that but don't you ever call me by first name and you way younger than me [Music] hello put a brother on that I got scripted for that the scripture actually tells us to call each other brother and sister it tell us that in the Bible right but but but but young people now they just thank you on the same level you just called No you don't do that we use Mr and Mr and Mr and missing and yes sir and yes ma'am we use that language that's the way our parents and then you get some people say now don't make me feel old by saying and all you guys say look I was just trained this way I'm sorry I cannot call you about first give me a nickname to call you but I will not call you by your first name because I respect you as my Elder so you're gonna have to give me a nickname because I can't do that I just I can't do it I can't call you and like brother brother Quentin tell you can't call them they unless you see a husband and wife them came to I need to I need to see somebody thank you but be respectful when you're talking to adults brother sister Mr okay uh you make me sound like my daddy so I'm sorry you sound like well you you really are your daddy but um I just got to call you something respectful your first name I know that's your name but to me it's not respectful and I just cannot do that to you it's steam them publicly and privately let's keep going this says support them support them this is not just Financial this is honor our parents by giving them the assurance that we will not forsake them in their old age honor your parents by assuring them now you know Mom and Daddy you get old imma be there to take care of you I'm gonna make sure you're taking care of don't you took care of me I'ma make sure you taken care of they uh they have this the statement this man said here says when we are young we gain strength and long for Independence our parents raise us to be strong and free but there's a trade-off here a passing of the Baton but as our parents age they become feeble they begin to lose their independence we honor our parents by giving them the assurance that we will not forsake them in their old age just as they care for us we will care for them this is our responsibility and it ought to be our joy not just a responsibility it should be a joy for you to take care of your parents let me tell you something when you was coming up me and all them diapers oh my day one complaining they just got you the diapers now when your parents get older you know what they may need diapers it's the truth in it high I work in this field it's the truth in how your parents maybe and it needs to be a joy for you to be able to provide for your parents let me tell you something right now you need to start working right now saving your money now because you don't know what you're gonna face later you're going to be working for your family and your parents there was a time that your parents worked for you and them and then when you got married they were still supporting you should be a joy and they made the statement at a time when millions of elderly adults are living alone consigned to nursing homes and hospitals cared for by professionals rather than family members Christians have the opportunity to displace special honor a man by the name of Kent Hughes says that even if parents have no financial needs there's still a Christian obligation for Hands-On Loving Care nurses may be employed but there must be more the care cannot be done by proxy emotional neglect and abandonment is not an option for such conduct is worse than an unbeliever so you just don't leave them to in a nursing home to take care of them and I see this so often kids don't want nothing to do with their parents all they waiting on is a will to be executed but it should be an honor for you to be there somehow to support your parents and and now we live in a world where you know we spread out all over the world it's hard to be home but you can send some money you can do something to make sure to make sure they are taken care of you are remember the little fella uh I think he was in India and his mom was at home and you know and uh and he was uh uh uh uh you know he was the way I think in Bible School something like that in India but uh but I forget what it was he was just the way and uh he was he was there and then the the mama was real poor and uh something happened I don't know what what happened to her but but somebody come out house and do you have anybody the sea bicycle yeah I got a son but I want to tell him what I'm really going through because he over there kind of handling all this and well do you ever hear from him see yeah he sent me the prettiest pictures he sent me the prettiest picture but let me see these pictures they went looking through the lady pictures saying your son was understanding you pictures ma'am this is money and you're a wealthy woman and don't even realize how wealthy you are this this young man was supporting his mama John 21 17-18 says he saith unto him the third time Simon son of Jonas loveth thou me Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time love has stopped me and he said unto him Lord thou knows all things thou knowest that I love thee Jesus said unto him feed my sheep verily verily I say unto thee when I was young thou girdest thyself and walk is wither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand and another shall gird thee and carry thee with a thou wouldest not age gonna settle in on all of us and we're going to need somebody it's good to sow good seeds right now amen because you're gonna need somebody later on Isaiah 46 and 4 says and for those of you that are in your old age I just put this promise in there for you and even to you even to your old age I am he if you got a child that ain't supporting you if you got a child and ain't doing what they supposed to do come on I'm giving you a promise from God amen he says even to your oh I am he and even to to to to uh to hairs will I carry you more hairs is them gray hairs coming in even to hairs will I carry you amen I have made and I will bear even I will carry and will deliver you hey it ain't just gonna be Social Security but God gave you a promise that I will carry you I will bear you I have made you I will keep you and I'ma talk to your children too now about their responsibility because you got a confidence in the god that you serve he's going to help you through this this season you ought to look for ways to support them not just Financial but talk about that a little bit later on but but just just hey mostly I'm gonna be there with you Mom I'm gonna be there with you Daddy anything go down You Can Count On Me not just putting it off on one spouse I mean I'm sorry one one uh sibling one sibling well you know you always kind of been like that you can go no no no no you need to show up at Mama house you need to show up at daddy house they're not feeling well you need to be there that amen I think I got something on this now I'm gonna go a little further because it's not just for children it's for the whole church when we have somebody that's down and out don't just leave it up to their children to go and take care of them as a church you also need to gather around and support look at this quote what brother Ramsay and I tell you out of the message the indictment this is for the church don't just leave it up to the kids now they got kids no no no no no no you you a brother you a sister and some of us we only worry about our families we don't go outside of that Circle you'll visit your family but sister so-and-so is here in the hospital brother so-and-so is there in the hospital what about going to see about them too and I tell you some night not all of you together but just a little trip down you talk about the rights this is the the family of the rights Edith writing amen and she was going through some things at the time and you know you know Sister Hattie right her sister he says uh just a little trip down they set up with her day and night and a little trip down there from this Tabernacle and the different Tabernacles the sister Tabernacles here some of you people see that's another thing you know I know we all come from different churches for different reasons but don't forget where you come from now this one's speaking to me right now Earl Wesco is precious to all of us don't you think it'll be probably helpful if some of us would just show up sometime and visit brother Wesco sister Wesco maybe take a meal to him don't just leave it up to rap from Faith to do that what about spirit and Truth Tabernacle doing that we just want to say we appreciate you here we just wanted to bring something to you here's a gift card for you to get something to eat amen little trip down there from this Tabernacle and the different Tabernacles the sister Tabernacles here some of you people go down and see the right family I'm sure they would appreciate it just go down set with them a little while and talk to them shake their hand and if no more than a little friendly visit look at what he say we forget that so easy you know and when it comes to our own home then we appreciate it and we must remember others appreciate it too in the right family I'm sure would appreciate that somebody down and young people when it's your parents you better make sure you on the scene with your own parents but it don't stop there go beyond that it go beyond that amen you find out somebody down go try to help them out amen give to those that have given to you all these years support them support them and and maybe they might need you to cut their grass maybe they might need you to wash their dishes maybe they might need you to fold some clothes when you go out there my wife was when they were coming up as young people so y'all think y'all got it easy y'all young people get it easy when they was coming up they used to go over the brothers sister West school house and they would clean they they didn't need to pay for no cleaners have young people in the church young sister's here and they would go there and they would clean that house mom and dad are just volunteering them yeah they'll come yeah yeah still be right there I'll bring them to you this is going to have a list ready for it and you know what them they didn't never complain them young sisters went right over there and did it and didn't complained they probably didn't like it but they didn't complain it made them better wise man I'm gonna have my wife call your parents we forget that's so easy to know and when it comes to home then we appreciate it and when we we must remember others appreciate it too and the right family I'm sure would appreciate that give me a few more minutes this one sometimes it's hard to honor parents because of things that they've done to us maybe things they said about us but this man says a practical way to only a parent is to actually forgive them forgive your daddy forgive your mama forgive the Bible says in Mark 11 25 and 26 when you stand praying forgive if you have art against any and what that odd is if you have a certain thing or something if you got that there he says you got if you got Aunt amen against any that your father also which is the heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses and and I want you to just understand it it's so important um this man Tim Charlie says it's not just read his statement here perhaps the most important way we can honor appearances to forgive them the fact is there are no perfect parents sometimes you look at somebody else household and you just think that they got it going on but you don't know what they're going through in that other house you don't live there you probably couldn't handle the rules the restrictions that was in that other house you can't handle your mama house you don't want to come to my house there are no perfect parents and I'ma also add this that no perfect children either no perfect no perfect parents all parents have fallen far short of their children's expectations now their children's expectations and in all likelihood even their own expectations so parents even struggle with themselves did I do enough did I do too much did I do you know we all we all we all maybe I should have handled it this way maybe we go through all of that we I mean I I know I go through it as a parent but I I but sometime when I'm going through that I have to just look myself in the mirror say you know what you did the very best that you could with what you had all parents have fallen far show their childhood expectations and in all likelihood of even their own expectations our parents have sinned against us they have made unwise decisions they have they have had unrealistic expectations they have said and done things that have left us deeply wounded parents have done that now it wasn't that we tried to do that we didn't mean to do that right and uh but but here's the thing and I know young people just get when you said this when I was 12. what are you still stuck there that's why okay I'm sorry can we move on right but but oftentimes we get stuck in things and look it wasn't that they was trying to do that to trying to hurt you in some way no they was trying to bring something better out of you amen but if it hurts you we don't mind apologizing but amen now you just watch it because that that's gonna Circle back around on you one day amen amen you be ready to apologize too because you don't know what it's like to be a parent until you become a parent you don't know nothing when I get kids I don't raise them like this okay and I be waiting [Applause] oh yes and see people people say like grandparents become a whole different person yeah they do they remember how they raised that child and they remember the things that child said to them remember you said that man now they don't remind you they're not gonna tell you they just just in the back of their mind and then you come I can't I don't know why little Joseph gonna do this little joke I know why cause a apple don't fall too far from the tree you don't remember what you took me through look at them and say did we make it you're gonna make it too [Applause] our parents have sinned against us they have made unwise decisions they have had unrealistic expectations they have said and done things that have left us deeply wounded for that reason many children into adulthood control by anger and bitterness if you got a child that's into the adulthood controlled by anger and bitterness they find themselves unable to move past their parents mistakes or their parents sin and the only way a child can move past their parents mistakes see just talking about it online and sharing all your feelings and all that you still ain't moved past it you don't you don't let the whole world know how you feel and you're still bitter the only way you can overcome that bitterness is through forgiveness and actually you know they say the way that you can begin sometimes you can and maybe a parent might not even be alive anymore but you got to forgive them of something they did sometimes you just called a name out loud mama I forgive you Daddy I forgive you and you don't call them by their first name that's disrespect she was not my mom did she give birth to you she was your mama on your birth certificate they have mother her name is there give her honor and respect and your daddy too my daddy name wasn't on the on the birth certificate yeah he was doing something wrong but you still know that's your daddy all right there's a statement that I was thinking about here and I I I I didn't I'll just I'll throw this out there um Joshua too uh verse 1 through 21 tells the story of Rahab and uh Rahab was a woman we know that was a prostitute and she opened up the doors to allow the children of Israel to come in amen and uh stay in her house and she said look I just need a token I need something I need something that that my family would be protected I'll be protected when y'all come we know y'all gonna take over the city but I just need to know am I going to be protected they said put this little Scarlet thread out your window whoever's in the house gonna be protected now the rehab was a young lady that was placed into prostitution by her daddy and her mama but rather than being bitter against her dad and her mama when it was time for deliverance to come to the house this lady had something in her heart that would say please let my daddy and mama and whoever's in my house be protected when y'all come see when you forgive them you can operate like that the last one I want to give you today provide for them now this where we're gonna need your money because the Bible tells us First Timothy 5 3 and 4 says Anna widows that are widows indeed but if any widow have children not only this now look at this one have children or nephews if a widow got nephews you ain't even a child but you're a nephew you connected you got money you need to take care of the Widow that is not the government responsibility and it's not the church responsibility that is them children and the nephew's responsibility some of y'all aunties ought to be happy when y'all see the nephews come and get them over to the house and read the scripts any widow have children or nephews let them first show piety at home and to requite their parents for that is good and acceptable before God also verse 7 and 8 in the same chapter says and these things give uh give in charge that they may be blameless but if any provide not for his own and especially for those of his own house he have denied the faith in his verse than an Infidel it's the child's responsibility you've got to grow up and accept responsibility because God needs you in a certain place where you can take care of your parents when they need to be taken care of but if you can't take care of yourself how you're gonna ever get to the spot where you can take care of them something happens the process is broken but God has an order and let me tell you something if you pray this place that Lord I want to come in line with your order I see where the word of God is telling me as a young man as a young woman I see what the word of God's telling me I want to come in line with your order I guarantee God will begin to open up the doors for you to get the job that you need and let me tell you you might have to start at the bottom like everybody else when you're climbing the ladder you don't start at the top you always start at the bottom to work your way up to the top someone's got a little bit too proud too much pride David some people say I ain't gonna never work no fast food job is that right is that who hired you need to get out there and get a fast food job too much pride it's just too much pride I ain't gonna do this I ain't gonna do that maybe that's maybe God wants to work on your pride you know you can be you can own a fast food restaurant you can work there and own it hello praise the Lord people gonna eat all right I'm coming home um this young man asked a question to brother Brandon he says uh what can I do for him should I continue to care for that uh should I continue to care for Dad should I continue on uh care for dad on the farm what can I do make a living for uh any sign of his name says yes my brothers wrote here I don't know who it uh brother Brandon it just starts out what can I do for him now probably some boyfriend's Dad look look my big brother blessed are you when you would take care of your dad for your dad took care of you when you could not take care of yourself take care for yourself and the first commandment with the promise first commandment promised honor thy father and thy mother that uh which may lengthen the days upon the Earth that the Lord thy God giveth thee see yeah take care of that any way that you can see that he gets the very best this young man want to know should I take care of my daddy should I just need the farm just leave it all up to him no no no no no God will bless you just by staying there with Danny it was a young young lady one time brother Brandon uh talked about her she uh she she told us that you know I just don't think I'm gonna ever get married here I don't think I'm gonna ever get married I don't did this I don't did that ain't no way nobody none of these guys gonna marry me he said she said I'm gonna have to leave here and go somewhere else and get get married and uh and uh so so brother Brandon told him they said look just stay where you are stay right where you are don't leave don't shoot the Indian on the Indian Reservation so just stay right here she wanted to go to the big city and find somebody no stay right here she said he said God gonna send you a husband if you just stay right here don't leave stay right here and the reason you need to stay there she need to be there in support of Mama she need to be there but one of the brothers acts brother random as they were leaving out said what does she mean by some of the things she done did um that she'll never be able to find a husband what what what is you know brother Brandon you're a prophet what does she do what does she mean by that brother Brandon looked at that brother say what's under the blood what's under the blood God don't even show his profits but all she need to do is obey and subject herself to that word and God did send her husband don't be just jumping up running trying to go here and trying to go there but somebody's running for my responsibility if your mama is your responsibility but you're gonna push it off on the church that's your responsibility and you can't be blessed until you get back in the will of God now let me tell you something I know something else like I said we spread out all over all over the world you can always send money if you can't be there yourself and ain't no way you're going to get to an age where you say well I know I know mama need a place to stay but she ain't staying with me is that right who house you stayed in when you was coming up who house you stayed in see you got to honor them about you know what my got a room for you I got a room for and mama if any time you stay right here I'm gonna make sure you're taken care of you need a refrigerator in your room I put a refrigerator in your room whatever you need mama I got you Daddy I got you that's how we honor our parents one last statement I like this I like first the title this this sermon I was just telling my wife there this morning I figured I didn't realize I had a statement closing with this this the title but this this uh this statement here we have no continuancy brother random is actually pre that's that's a scripture in the book of Hebrews and I'm just sharing this with the brother this week that that term I used to always kind of struggle with man what does that mean here we have no continuous City what it means simply is nothing lasts forever no matter what it is it won't last forever spirit and Truth won't last forever but we're going to enjoy it while it is here we're going to enjoy it but nothing lasts forever let me tell you something young people you got good parents they're not gonna last forever enjoy them while you got them you got a good church enjoy while you got it sometimes you got a good young people group enjoy it while you got it because it's not gonna last forever things gonna change but enjoy what you got while you got it look at what brother Rams says and then she says young people remember if you're fortunate enough today to have a daddy and a mother living love them honor them the hour will come when you'll think they're the greatest people in the world now sometimes you look at Mom and they're like ah they I got the worst person it's gonna come a day you're gonna think man I got I had the best dad and the best mom we just gotta wait for it you'll get there though the owl you'll think that they're the greatest people in the world if you don't now and don't never little fellas don't never give this slander word old man my old man and my old woman now old man and old woman that's not the old man or old woman now brother Brandon uses a slang from his day I don't know what they call I don't know what terms they use nowadays but say don't use that you always respect mom dad always respect her and don't you ever call your parents by their first name amen that's disrespectful amen that's not the old man or woman that's Daddy and mother and some of these days when they go out of the room in the casket of flowers you hear them lowered down in the ground the pastor says Ashes to actress dust to dust it won't be old man then there won't be the old woman it'll be mother you'll be ringing your hands and crying that's right now while she's a living give her flowers now and give Dad his flowers that's right look at this and now the best flower you could give them is obey them and that's the first promise in the Bible the first commandment with promise honored by father and mother wish me Lenten your days upon the Earth that the Lord have given me let's pray father we are grateful for the word that you have given us thank you for this time that we could just go through some practical teaching Lord uh for the family the structure of the family is so important the enemy Minds run a rough shot attacking homes attacking the family Lord the father the mother the children everybody under attack the Lord if we can just see the way that you have ordained instructed things to be and we follow in those those steps we'll see your blessings overtake you will see you Lord establish our children our homes oh God would be safe havens and places of Refuge children could come father from
