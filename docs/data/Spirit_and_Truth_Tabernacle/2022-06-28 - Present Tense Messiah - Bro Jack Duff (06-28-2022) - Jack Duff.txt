14. good god almighty a giant man it's good to good to see you and amen sister erica and sister jessica amen now so so jessica when are you leaving next saturday so sister jessica um has got accepted uh to medical school praise the lord [Music] and now she'll be going to tennessee and um and i know that um this has been somewhat of a journey we just thank the lord for opening the door for her to be able to to go and and um uh very excited for and since jessica this morning i would just like to have a word of prayer over you before you go and um we uh we're just we're happy for and you know even i think when we have um some of our young people to rise up to these levels i think it's really really good um jesus had a doctor with him a man by the name of luke and uh so so i mean i think it's a real blessing when we see it and what my prayer is is uh that as she goes forward amen into this next chapter of life that god will go with her man he's brought it this far and he'll go forward with her amen i know of many doctors they realize you know you medicine takes you so far but you still have to use your faith amen and and that's where you know sometimes a doctor has the opportunity uh when people at their and their their last my mom had had a doctor recently uh you know she was going through something she was a little concerned about it but this doctor said let me pray with you you know and and when the doctor said that it it just kind of settled the spirit like god you gave me a doctor that believes and understands that god still worked miracles and the doctors say i must still do the best i can but i know god is able right so so so i was just i was encouraged by that and we pray that the lord will bless you to be a doctor that'll be an impact a man to people in so many ways both medically and spiritually amen so sister jessica why don't you come i want to pray for you i want to pray for you amen i want to pray for you [Music] amen just we're just going to anoint you as you go forward amen thank god for you amen our doctor our doctor amen praise the lord let's just pray for her father god lord our precious sister who you brought to this ministry her and her family and father brought him we've had the opportunity lord to sow the word into their wounds their spiritual wounds and god i pray to the word that has been sown we'll go forth with her as she goes to this next step in the journey god i know what the struggle was for to get here and uh got just a different test that she had to take and lord and sometimes maybe getting a little discouraged but father you saw her through she was persevering she went through it oh god and now you open up a door for her to be accepted there in tennessee god reacts that you would go before her that you would bless her as she comes in contact with the different people there as she takes this next leg of the journey father may you just be there surrounding her and keeping her being a shield as she's away from her family keep her gone it's our prayer uh we ask that you lord jesus withdraw closer to you lord even while she's there uh lord just continue to speak to a spiritual god and father we are we just ask that you raise up for your glory father even as a doctor me you get glory even through the profession lord we just uh commit her father into your hands and lord may your anoint her mind that she would do well in all of her assignments god and that we would hear positive testimonies lord of how lord jesus that you've been blessing her in this in this this phase so lord we just committed to you today lord and we thank you for what you've done for pray that you're blessed abundantly god is our prayer it's in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen god bless you god bless you praise the lord praise the lord [Applause] amen amen amen amen hallelujah recently i was just uh talking to some young people in canada is telling how your your purpose shifts in life often times you get so uh concerned about where you are right now but you have to understand as you get older your purpose just continues to shift it's thinking about you know sister uh jessica being a musician here and now she's moving on to the next phase in life and uh purpose is shifting amen purpose is shifting but glory to god i pray that uh when when it's all over school's all over i pray god to send you right back home amen we need doctors here and god will send you right back home and i'm talking about home in two ways amen all right amen all right so uh i have a a card here that i need to just mention uh since god has wonderful ways of letting us know he's up to something good in our lives uh to our s.a.t family and he says and so often he does it through wonderful people like you thank thank you so much to our sat family with hearts full of overwhelming joy and love we want to thank you all for taking the time to celebrate with us on our wedding day we often talk about just how much time and effort everyone put into making our day memorable there are no words to express the fullness of our gratitude just know you're always on our hearts and minds we love you all and pray god bless you richly with love it's brother aaron and sister rebecca mugo amen sending a thank you card to the church for uh all that you did to make their wedding what it was amen we certainly thank god for them and certainly appreciate them praise the lord amen i think i was supposed to announce something [Music] it slipped my mind now but if it comes back to me then i'll announce it well oh yeah after after service today brothers they are going to be coming in here and um stripping these floors so they access just take everything up uh off the floor and so we have to put everything away today in storage and then on top of that we actually have to take the pulpit and this stand and i think there's another little stand inside that little little podium we got to take those three out and put them in storage uh for a week and then uh because they just need everything off the floors and so we can't have anything we can put it in the whatever can go in stores we can put in storage but everything else got to be off the floor so if you all don't mind just helping us with that and then afterwards we greatly appreciate it and i believe it was announced already uh next week we will be there uh at brother west coast church um in fellowship with them brother wesk will be turning 80 years old on july 4th and we thank god for giving him man 80 years and so we're just going to celebrate with them and just be with them for the weekend so just keep that in mind we won't be here at all so no prayer here next week service does start at 10 a.m when we go to bella west goes not 10 30 it'll be 10 a.m so uh everyone and just be prepared to be there a little early amen praise the lord thank you uh musicians appreciate you all i appreciate the specials that went forth um that was a real blessing amen a real blessing thank god for you all so i want to just uh ask that you stand with me as we read the word of the lord uh we'll read two passages out of the book of john amen john chapter 1 and john chapter 4. praise the lord amen john chapter 1 and i will be starting here at verse 35. um says this again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples and looking upon jesus as he walked he saith behold the lamb of god behold the lamb of god and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed jesus then jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto them what seek ye they said unto him rabbi we're just to say being interpreted master where dwelleth thou he saith unto them come and see they came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hour uh one of the two which heard john speak and followed him was andrew simon peter's brother he first founded his own brother simon and said unto him we have found the messiahs or messiah which is being interpreted the christ and he brought him to jesus and when jesus beheld him he said thou art simon the son of jonah thou shalt be called cephas which is by interpretation of stone uh the day following jesus would go forth into galilee and findeth philip and saith unto him follow me uh now philip was of bethsaida the city of andrew and peter philip founded nathanael and said unto him we have found him of whom moses and the law and the prophets did right jesus of nazareth the son of joseph let's turn over here to um john 4 a man and we're just picking up verse 24 a man god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth uh the woman saith unto him i know that messiahs cometh which is called christ when he is come he will tell us all things jesus said unto her i that speak unto thee am he and upon this came his disciples and marvel that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why talk is down with her the the the woman then left her water pot went her way into the city and said unto the man said to the men come see a man which told me all the things that i ever did is not this the christ then they went out of the city and came nigh unto him amen the lord had a blessing to reading of his word let's just bow in a word of prayer father we thank you for the ability to read uh scripture but may the holy spirit god make it so real to us uh even today uh we uh just pray that you take take control over this portion of the service thank you for all that you have done and it's so good to be here uh in the house lord thank you for um bringing brother solomon and family lord just back with us and uh lord how we're grateful uh for the gifts that you've given amen to to this church and just appreciate uh each and every one uh all the other saints that are out god you know sister capers brother smiley wasn't feeling his best so god we thank you for touching them in advance uh thank you for touching my wife and uh also my mom my mother-in-law uh lord just different ones that have been going through and just pray to watch of all the saints those that are away and traveling i know brother jeffrey there in saint augustine lord bless him and uh god we just accept you lord jesus allow uh sister tina this is a cow to return home safely this week and lord may you just continue to get all the glory and all the honor and even uh brother simba and his family has their way lord bless them fathers our prayer we're careful to give you all the honor all the glory and the praise it's in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated um i want to take a title today uh present tense messiah amen and you know a few years ago there was a testimony that went out that um i was blessed by brother dave musgrove was sharing the testimony of how somehow i don't remember all the details but i remember there was a a jewish man that called him and began to ask questions about the message and everything like that and brother dave had a wonderful wonderful uh fellowship with him and i think in the midst of this fellowship he had mentioned uh something about present tense messiah and and i took that and i just kind of wrote it down and i've been holding on to it for a little bit and just just kind of waiting for the right time to just kind of share and uh you know and just just this week i was listening to a sermon and brother branham had made a statement there in the sermon that caused me to go back here and i was listening to the sermon crisis identified the same in all generations there's a message in the title of the sermon christ is identified the same in all generations amen so when we look back in scripture we see christ manifesting himself uh you know through uh those that have gone before us but now it's our time on the earth amen and jesus is the same yesterday today and forever so uh you know he we will see him manifest it even during our time glory to god so you know as um um uh i was just kind of reflecting on that um i wanted to you know just kind of maybe start here brother branham preached a sermon called the messiah and uh when he when he took his text in this particular sermon uh i'm going to a paragraph 13 on the messiah there is where i'm headed uh when he took his texts uh for this sermon the messiah i i noticed that he picked up out of john 1 a man and he picked up out of john four and uh and he took his text and i said wow you know that is just um a blessing you know for me just to kind of see the prophet just kind of uh go there and and let me before i just i don't want to get ahead of myself uh let me just kind of just start with this little quote here and and that'll slow me down a little bit so i don't just just empty it all out in in about two minutes uh so so here this paragraph um 13 i'm actually kind of reading the very bottom of the paragraph here uh he's just reading the scriptures and i'm just coming like to the last part of this paragraph and he makes this statement amen he says i want to take five letter word from there for a text now he said five letter but it's actually seven letters amen it says m e s s i a s messiah right it says i want my subject tonight to be around the word the messiah it says the word itself means the anointed one hallelujah or it could be used the anointed king thank you jesus amen and it also means christ but we're going to use it uh first in this thought of the anointed king amen so when we we're talking about this messiah uh uh it's the anointed king glory to god brother branham is taking it from that from that angle and you know and for me uh when i hear when i just look at that that particular statement my my uh mind quickly goes to david amen because david was an anointed king actually i like to call him the pre-anointed king amen and he was anointed by the prophet i'm i'm take you can take that down says uh he was anointed by the prophet and um you know and before he actually came into his position he had already received his anointing oh glory to god amen before he actually became physical king hey i love this thought amen before he became physical king he had already received his anointing and with the anointing there was nothing that could take david out before he came to the manifestation of his anointing oh i want you to understand something today you have been pre-anointed for a specific purpose and there is nothing that can take you out until you come into the very purpose and plan that god has for your life you might have your own plan for your life but god somehow is gonna make all things work together for his good amen it's for his purpose hallelujah it's his breath that we breathe and we pour out our praise we pour out our praise amen because it's it's what he has done for us and this anointing is nothing amen it was nothing that david could do for himself the prophet was sent to david to give him the anointing even when nobody believed in him nobody believed in him even his daddy didn't believe in him but but yet yet uh god believed in him and i want to tell you god has believed in you oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen you have already received your anointing for what god amen is calling you to hey thank you jesus all right let me go a little further here amen in this sermon uh go wake jesus uh we we're talking about present tense messiah amen let me let me try to coast just a little bit look at this now he says this in the sermon go wake jesus he says they should have known these disciples that he was the messiah and the word messiah means the anointed one see he says he had all god in him god was in him he said jesus the son said i do nothing in myself but what i see the father doeth the father dwelleth in me says now he was messiah by that with that anointing made him fully messiah and we praise god with the same spirit was upon him not in portion but the same hymn uh the same uh him fully messiah we with the same spirit was upon him not important but the same quality with a portion upon us would make us like messiahs hey man it would make us like messiahs would be little sons of god amen i don't care whether i was a big son of god or a little son of god amen what remains constant is that i am a son of god hallelujah amen let's put let's tell that devil he is a liar and he cannot hold any accusation against us even in our failures we are still sons we're still daughters glory to god amen amen even though adam partook of the tree it didn't change his status it might have changed just his dwelling place but it didn't change his status his status was he was still a son of god glory to god all right now amen look at this he says the same quality with a portion upon us would make us like little messiahs would be little sons of god adopted sons of god and his holy spirit has sealed us into his body and we are his children amen there should nothing bother us nothing worry us we're his if it ain't we're we're foster uh uh we're false accusers we've been testifying to something that's not even so i believe it i believe that now we are the sons of god not we will be glory to god now not uh right now and now we're seated together in heavenly places in christ jesus amen now it goes on a little further here and let me before i before i i i get that uh this next um statement here um i know i can i can go for it he says uh we don't have any power but we we have authority amen it don't take power glory to god someone said you you got any power no but i got authority [Applause] that's right i say you take a little policeman standing out here he wears a uniform his hat is too big for it for him sets down over his ears he hasn't got power to stop nothing but let him walk out there in a car coming down the street with a 300 horsepower engine let him raise up that ham watch the brake slot why he hasn't got no power but he's got authority and when a man or a woman is anointed with the baptism of the holy ghost he might not be able to read his name and box kossia's letters with education but he has got authority from god that he is a son of god let him take his authority and stand and say stop hey and satan's wills will slide brother all god is waiting for you to rise up and use your authority tell the demo stop praise god and watch the devil's wheel slide amen you know yesterday i was there and saint augustine at the meeting and brother brother andrew glover was preaching and he just he brought out something that just blessed my heart he was saying recently he was at the um he was flying uh from one city to another amen and uh and as he was flying uh he happened to see this big tall guy a man say this guy look like he's about seven foot two and andrew is pretty tall himself but this guy's seven two is standing way above brother andrew like he said that got to be a basketball player so he said i got i want to make my way over to him and just talk to him a little bit and says i got up on say hey you know your basketball player you didn't see that it's like yeah yeah yeah i used to play and you know and i'm just kind of talking to him didn't know who he really was and then all of a sudden some people showed up and it says uh we'd like to get a picture with you and they say they say okay no problem uh i you know i'll take the picture with you and he stood there and took the picture and said now we want to take a video of you too but we need you to do something for us he said just put your hand up and do like this and he realized hey this guy that do like this that's the kimby mutumbo praise god and what the can be when he would do that any opposing team that was coming to try to score a basket he didn't care who they was if michael jordan was coming if charles barkley was coming if amen uh anybody it didn't matter magic johnson any of them was coming if they come next to his goal he was gonna swat it down and when he blocked they shot he would look him in the face and pretty much say no that's not gonna happen here it's time for us to put our hands up let the devil see no no no praise god we are not taking that anymore we gonna use our authority we may not have power but we got authority glory to god amen he said let him take his authority and stand and say stop and satan's wheels will slot and brakes will something will take place because he's been given authority by the holy ghost in my name shall they cast out devils that's it sure he don't have to have a dd d or phd he just he needs he has to know jesus and know what's been giving him there he stands yes sir all right glory to god amen so i want to um uh catch one more here amen out of the unveiling of god this is you know for me i i coming from a baptist background and pentecostal background um you know i have to say we heard a lot of the same sermons uh over and over daniel and the lion's den and the the three hebrew boys and you know just just all of that but i never heard anybody telling me my position right i never heard anyone pick up this bible and show me where i fit here right but god sent us a prophet to show us where where we stand here in scripture amen amen we're not just church members amen i wear a different title a messiaet messiah what think about that that's a huge word and and actually i don't even think you'll find it in the dictionary but this is bright language messiah right hallelujah you know as believers we're going to share in the throne with him right that is our position we share in the throne with christ glory to god hallelujah amen here um this message the unveiling of god brother branham makes a statement it says notice veiled in human flesh moses with that word speaking what was to be later put behind badger skin so that so is christ our moses christ is our moses he was god veiled in human flesh veiled in humanity and flesh that's right and he's the same yesterday the day and forever he was veiled by badger skins he was veiled and this time he was veiled in a man see now notice saying yesterday today and forever promised his word uh to this age he is still christ the promised word to this age amen veiled in human flesh the word is god look at this next statement the anointing is a person amen hallelujah amen we're talking about christ the anointed one the anointing is a person the word christ means an anointed one the anointed one then moses was christ in his day he was the anointed one glory to god jeremiah was christ in his days a man with a portion of the word for that day hallelujah but when jesus came he came as the redeemer anointed one and that was what uh and and uh and that was both moses and all that was in moses and all the word and all the godhead volley was in him that's the reason the whole temple of el rent and the mercy seat come in perfect view he was the anointed one now i just love the way brother branham is just kind of uh sharing this he said moses was christ in his day then he picked up jeremiah jeremiah was christ in his day he could have kept going isaiah would have been christ in his day daniel would have been christ in his day praise god malachi would have been christ in his day glory to god amen you can just go on and on and on throughout the scriptures pick up those old testament prophets they would have been christ for their day and that thought did not stop in the old testament amen it kept moving through the new testament when christ came himself amen he was christ of every day it was his anointing that was there among the prophets in the old testament it's his anointing that it's in the church even right now hey we would have said paul would have been christ in his day iranians would have been christ in his day luther wesley martin amen christ in their day brother branham would have been christ the anointing would have fell on him in his day but he's not here anymore but christ is still here and where is he veiled behind skin our skin praise god messiahs for this day [Music] oh glory to god amen i i i'm so glad i know who i am here you know people are always looking for the messiah they're looking for the anointing people looking for the anointing because it's the anointing that breaks the yoke it's the anointing that that that sets the captives free right uh you know uh many many would show up to brother branham's meetings and mighty they do on scheme and do all kind of other things to get prayer cards they want to get before that anointing hallelujah you know and um it ought to be the same today that there should be such an anointing in the church that people want to come not only that people want to come amen i believe the church has got to be in a healthy enough condition where you would want to invite people to your church glory to god come go to church with me see this is what happened with these brothers amen uh as we were reading there in the scripture um you know i just i just kind of love this we know the the woman at the well was full of sin this lady had a life that was full of sin as she was going to the well she actually could not go at the same time that the other women went out uh her being a prostitute living a ungodly life hallelujah now she might have been living an ungodly life but on the inside of this lady she actually wanted to be right sometimes you don't know how people end up in the positions that they're in that's why we can't be so quick to judge people we don't know how they got there you don't know you don't know where they come from hey man you amen if their seat of god we know where they're going but we don't know where they came from but here this woman's you know she had um this this life that was ungodly and um you know as she actually comes to the well that day and maybe just an ordinary day for her just another day she shows up in the well here's this man said give me something to drink now she never heard this pickup line before she heard this one before and so she was like she began to have a conversation with him it's like you know look you know um i'm samaritan you jew we don't even have anything to do with one another he said you know uh uh you know y'all say y'all need to worship over there and we say you worship over here and we don't have anything to do that segregation between our people no we don't have anything to do with one another he said you know uh you know if you knew who you was talking to you would be asking me for something to drink oh well wait a minute i heard nobody use no line like that before now now uh uh it's they say not in the water that i give you won't thirst again you're never thirsty and like wait a minute what kind of water is this so so he began to talk to him and she got a little desperate saying i want some of that water amen you say you got this what i need to have some of that water and he said now before you can get this water we got to deal with just one little thing say go get your husband and bring him here she's saying i don't have a husband he's saying you speak well he's saying he said you don't have five and the one you're living with right now is not your husband he said he's she said she say now now we know when messiah come he gonna tell us these things and he said and he said this and he said he said i am he that speaks to you glory to god and when that lady recognized she had been looking for the messiah she heard it in sunday school it was a promise that was a man that was dwelling in her and she couldn't wait to run into the messiah and here she had a purge so no one-on-one conversation with the messiah he says i mean that speech you see took off running dropped a water pot didn't care about other disciples coming seeing her talking to jesus she took off running into the city come see a man that's told me the things that i've done now now what what identified him as a messiah his messiah sign was that he could tell her these things about herself without even knowing her that was the messiahic sign [Music] oh hallelujah i want y'all to know that sometimes y'all walk into the church and y'all just dealt with something at home the week before and god begins to pick up right out of the pulpit the things that you just dealt with walk right into some of your conversations speak word for word hey man what about when uh brother ernie villanueva came here and was sick as i don't know what i was so afraid of the brother preaching i didn't know what was going on inside of brother ernie but he said brother jack i need to preach i want to preach i want to i said well let let me just read the scriptures for you he said you can read them but let me preach walked out here and said the exact same thing i said the week before messiah sign is in our midst amen i just love this but when that lady could identify with the messiah sign it changed her life and when you can identify with the messiah sign it will change your life them brothers amen over in john 1 that we were reading about and and here they now i love this because they were following a prophet glory uh andrew they heard uh john say behold the lamb of god and evidently it must not have said it to everybody but these fellows heard what john said and when they when when they heard it glory to god amen they took off they left john and they took off the fall of christ and they said now where you where you sleeping at jesus said well come and see and when that when they got there and uh you know and began to uh you know just kind of fellowship with him and and everything andrew got a little excited andrew said now i can't hold this to myself it says i gotta go tell my brother and he went and got peter glory to god and when he brought peter he said he any and i just love the way uh he did it i just kind of wrote this note down amen uh andrew and told peter that we have found the messiah the anointed one glory glory glory and here's the thing that i want you to catch amen uh when they found the messiah not only did andrew find messiah another one philip found nathaniel we read that philip found the things that we found him of whom moses in the law and the prophets did uh write of jesus of nazareth the son of joseph now i like that because uh i put this they were not afraid to put a name to the fulfillment of scripture hey they were not afraid in their day to put a name with the fulfillment of scripture we have found the messiah what is his name jesus of nazareth do you mean the crazy man no to them he's crazy but to me messiah he's the fulfillment of the scripture what moses wrote about that's what we found glory to god i love this church because see you know here here john points them to jesus and we had a prophet that we not we're not we're not ashamed to identify his name with the fulfillment of scripture malachi 4 assigned to william marion branham revelation 10 7 assigned to william marion branham glory to god we're not ashamed to connect his name to the scripture glory amen i got some more scriptures here to read for you a little bit later on and i hope you can put your name in the scripture all right all right here you know they say we found messiah and again that messiah sign was demonstrated he told peter his name had never met him and they said we're gonna call you he says you know uh uh we're gonna call you little stone cephas which meant little stone with peter right there was a little note that i had here in my bible let me just see if i can just catch this really quick for you forgot to write this one down um okay i might not have it here but um actually his name that that name um let's say that we you know you we found uh you you're not going to be peter anymore i mean you're not going to be uh it says thou art simon that name simon actually had a a a a a meaning you know something like uh like rough and rugged uh personality something like that but but peter meant stone and made him solid right stable that's what that's what peter meant stable so when he changed his name it made him stable and you remember when when they um when when when it when when the the soldiers came to take jesus away that nature that that that old nature that was in peter rose up that's why jesus had to change his name right because there was a nature that was associated with that name and that nature rose up he was the one who picked up a sword and chopped the man's head off well he chopped his ear off he was trying to chop his head off but he missed and chopped his ear off my god but but it showed the nature that was there so he had to change his name from from simon to peter hallelujah all right all right all right all right all right but when when nathaniel uh was found by philip and then they think this behold the israelite on whom there is no guile that was the messiah sign being demonstrated amen right before the very eyes this is why they can say we have found the messiah the one moses was speaking of now let's go back and pick up moses deuteronomy 18. thank you jesus deuteronomy 18. you got to see how scripture is being fulfilled and it's one thing to see it fulfill in a day gone by but it's another thing to see it fulfilled in your day deuteronomy 18. this is the promise that moses was leaving amen with the children of israel and they waited for years for this to be manifested when the church listened to the rabbis uh teach teacher the priest teacher on it waited for years and then finally jesus shows up and say oh this is the messiah this is the fulfillment of what moses spoke about look the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren like unto me unto him ye shall hearken this was the very scripture that they were pointing to now i want to go forward in here because i can just stop that right there but i want to go forward because you know there's many people that take the rest of this verse amen and they use it as justification to stop following the message and completely misunderstanding right you you got to watch see it's one thing a man uh it's one thing to try to use a scripture to justify yourself in these things but if you i mean but but when you're using in in the way that you're using it then you have to apply it the same way in every circumstance hallelujah that ought to let you know that wait a minute if it don't apply this in this circumstance amen then i can't use it like that now you can't use it to try to go against brother branham and then not not also take the same thing and point it at moses let's go let's let's read this let's read it all right it says verse 16 according to all that thou desirest of the lord thy god and horut in the day of the assembly saying let me not hear again the voice of the lord my god neither let me see this great fire anymore that i die not it says when the lord said unto me they have well spoken that which they have spoken i will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that i shall command him now here's another thing i want you to get because there's a there's this other little teaching especially when it comes to the book of malachi i think the very first few verses there in the book of first in malachi it says something to the the house of israel right it speaks something like that uh and most people interpret it as saying with this amen this particular book this whole chapter is for the jews is that right all right so we go back to the ten commandments are you telling me that's only for the jews right amen and the other thing i'm gonna tell you that you're not gonna take from me i'm gonna go back to malachi because i'm a faithful top pair and he told me he gonna rebuke the devil for my sake are you telling me that promise is only for the jews well i'm here to tell you too late because i'm walking in that promise i'm living in that every day i don't see them rebuke to devour for my sake you can't tell me that's not for me right so you just can't hack up the word of god and say part of it is for us part of us not not no it's all for us god just used the juice in order to get these promises through them gentiles have always been on his mind hallelujah glory to god with the apple of his eye amen but he had to use somebody he started with the jews glory to god but it just keeps flowing even in this scripture i'm sharing yes jesus christ was the very fulfillment of that scripture but i want to tell you scripture has a compound meaning brother branham's ministry was also like moses ministry paul's ministry was also like moses ministry glory to god all right let me just keep going you know god gave uh moses a revelation on the back side of the desert he gave paul a revelation on the backside desert and where was brother branham amen when he got the commission to go and preach the seven seals desert all right all right let me keep going verse 18 i will raise him up a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he should speak unto them all that i shall command him and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name now who's doing the speaking is god speaking through the man these this is this was god speaking through the man glory says he says but the prophet i'm sorry verse 19 and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name i'll require it of him there's judgment if you reject the prophet right it says but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which i have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that prophet shall die watch and if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word which the lord hath not spoken it says when a prophet speaketh in the name of the lord if the thing followeth follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the lord have not spoken but the prophet has spoken it presumptuously thou shalt not be afraid of him people are using this to justify leaving because brother random said he was going to get a bear and he didn't get the bear what that guy do what that got to do with the word right ain't got nothing to do with the word right and what he did was i mean and and i have to tell him say now now you know moses the very guy that told us that if a man spoke something that didn't come to pass don't hear him well moses was told that he was the one to lead the children out of egypt and into the promised land now people say well now i'm not exactly into the prophecy so what you're saying is that moses will lead them to the wilderness was that god's promise to lead them to the wilderness or to the promised land and say now if moses even though it did not specifically say to the promised land it was intended that moses was going to take the people to the promised land how do we know it was intended because when moses struck the rock twice his punishment his very punishment was that he could not go into the promised land why was that his punishment if god never intended for him to go see sometimes we get a little bit too smart for ourselves and we need revelation glory to god because we start misapplying this word and we get all mixed up now we don't know what we don't get people now they start off down this path and i don't even believe the bible and you're supposed to be going back to the bible you say you're leaving the message to go back to the bible you don't even follow the bible see that that's what you you i'm gonna just tell you something humble yourself humble yourself amen and subject yourself to good leadership don't try to lead follow right but humble yourself and subject yourself to good leadership somebody that can just break the word of god down for you amen church glory to god glory to god amen amen amen you know this this thing just got people all turned all around and they think they got this thing all lined up they got it all lined up i said lord it's just a shame it's a shame how they how to get all messed up out there and i i sometimes you just want to ask some questions like one now saying revelation 10 7 is not brother branham that don't title revelation 3 14. it ret it ties to the seventh trumpeting angel i don't care well now you tell me who the other six trumpeting angels are if you say brother branham is the seventh well maybe you're not saying that i don't know what you're saying but if you say you say you say you tell me who the other six trump of the neighbors are they ain't got no answer praise god but i can go back to a message and get to this all right here i am i want to go to this message christ identified the same in all generations hey we we're looking for messiah man when they found them they went telling everybody we found the messiah and that's what we're doing you know with this this word that we got amen we got uh the anointing for this day we're not ashamed of it i'm happy to be identified with it christ is identified the same in all generations look at this look at this this this this word that he uh he tells us here it says now we don't have time to lay too much of it tonight because we just got a few minutes left notice the word that's ordained for each age when that word is made manifest i want y'all to get it now the word that is ordained for each age when that word is made manifest that is christ for that day let me let me put it in layman's terms you say you're looking for jesus you say you want to hear from jesus i'm here to tell you amen the word that's ordained for each age when that word is made manifest you found jesus now you got jesus oh and when you leave that you leave jesus [Music] hey it ain't nothing but the truth jeremiah was jesus for his day christ for his day noah would have been christ for his day if you didn't want to hear what noah had to say you left you left a message you left jesus you died amen [Music] it's right there in the book of genesis everybody that was not in the ark what did the ark represent the ark representing christ i told you you know my my i was saying that i guess on last week and uh talk about how what if you would have been one of noah's children tell me uh daddy uh i i i'm daddy i can't go with this i'm sorry i just no daddy i'm i'm having a hard time with this daddy and you want to just decide you want to get up and leave only your daddy had the answer and here's the sad part god only spoke to one person noah nobody else heard anything from god and he was moving by faith with what he heard from god everybody else just had to follow my daughter telling him i was saying that my daughter said you know you preaching on this i just showed this little video to my uh to to to her nephew uh elias and you know and it was a a veggietale video of they had made where one of noah's sons was doing his best not to get on the ark to go against the ark doing his best to get off the ark he built himself a balloon to get off the ark and then he made a comment and it's all it's all a video right he made a comment he said he'd say you know what some giant squid gonna come and just tear this thing up i mean we got we got something to get out of here everybody get in get in the balloon let's get out of here because all of a sudden a giant squid came from nowhere and just flushed and just crushed this balloon and it's just a video but but but but the the uh uh the the the fact of the matter is or the moral of the story amen god will use whatever he got to use to stop you from doing what you're trying to do you may be trying to run from this message god got a way of bringing you right back to it he loved you just that much and sometimes you know what people have is what i call a man the uh the air in spirit that's all that happened they aired in spirit they don't know no better they aired and spit they just got a hold of a website didn't even realize what the website was i'm gonna give y'all a little history [Applause] i just you know traveling sometimes you get information oh lord i was traveling recently and i went to a church and didn't realize this church was actually the church where i believe the sign came out of them didn't realize this was the church but there were some believers in that church that they didn't believe the sign not the way they believe the sign and even the pastors they the pastors say they wanted me to sign off and i told them say i couldn't sign off and i just don't feel right about this believe the sign believe he say that that's that's not even scriptural and don't say not like that in the bible they say these signs should follow them that believe but it didn't say believe the sign believe the words but not believe the sign i say my brother he said i just didn't feel right about that so i never i never uh signed up for it it says and furthermore the brother that was over this i remember going to his house as a as a musician and he was the song leader in the church and and as assaulting the church he would put on in his house music worldly music he'd say put on the beatles and say this is a great band we're going to try to be like them and bringing that into the sanctuary this is the man that's on believe the sign this is the man that's leading that this is the mind this is the mind right and everybody else just follow get on the website and just follow you don't know the spirit behind that's right that's why you need the holy ghost account no no no no no you you don't you just don't follow into that exactly right i mean i and i get back from that trip saying man i need it i needed to hear that one brother thank you go to another trip and i'm just you know i'm dreading all these trips because i'm every weekend i'm just going i'm just going i'm going but everywhere i get i get something when i get to last weekend i'm away for just a day and a half and i get to a meeting as a minister's meeting there's a brother come all the way from arizona to fly this minister's meeting he came for two purposes it says it came because there was a a woman living in the area that he had finally connected with and her sister was delivered in brother branham's ministry from you know a um from a real evil spirit and um so uh she was like in an insane asylum and so so here you know this brother say um uh what he found out that this lady and her sisters and the mother and i think the father went to brother branham said would you go with us to the insane asylum to pray for our loved one he said yeah he got in the county road with him one sunday after church and brother branham and the quote said i was going with their mother before they before the lady had kids i was going with him which mean that that was his girlfriend so the brother remembered all this and the quote and he called the lady up said i want to come see you and uh and when he talked on the phone he says you know do you remember uh uh brother uh uh william branham i said yeah billy branham i know him very well say i remember when we went down there to pray for my sister and and they told us that she was gonna be in that condition for for a long time but he went and prayed one simple prayer within a day she was out of there and been free ever since it says free to the day she died yeah we remember him very well he was a he was a very very wonderful man of god and uh he said you know also he made a comment that he used to go with your mother before y'all did your mama ever say anything about that and i said yeah yeah she know you know she did tell us that you know before she had us that day she used to date brother branham he said he said she said you know why he broke up with my mama he said she said you ain't gonna believe this why he actually stopped dating my mama he said he told he the reason he stopped dating my mom was because she was wearing fingernail polish the prophecy i cannot have this woman for my wife went and prayed for her daughter but you can't be my wife let me finish reading [Music] we don't have time to lay too much of it tonight because we just got a few minutes left notice the word that's ordained for each age when that word is made manifest that is christ for that day just like it was in each of these days now we find a man jesus coming on the scene he was rejected yet he was the promised word now in deuteronomy 18 15 most said the lord your god shall raise up a prophet like me and it shall come to pass that whosoever whosoever shall not hear this prophet will be cut off from among the people now there he was exactly the prophet for that age and the teachers of that day didn't see it they finally put him to death see and he done just exactly he was born of a virgin they didn't believe that that was a bunch of fanaticism but we believe it now after it's been proven and that's the problem people don't come to believe in this message after has been proven right and you know look uh i i can't i can't i cannot understand how um people have fallen away from this message and um uh i can't see how their hearts did not change after our last presidential election ain't no way i mean a prophet spoke this 80-something years before it happened and here it comes walking right before we live to see it and like you like you didn't remember that you didn't remember that that prophecy like you didn't remember that one you know that was nothing but god and let me tell you something since that time this time it's god's grace that's still going out to try to get people amen all right let's listen um i got i got i got a few things to read let me just y'all bear with me the sign of discernment was the messiah sign that's what that's what uh uh and andrew and peter they thank you philip all of them they saw that sign of discernment even that woman at the well saw the sign of discernment that was the messiah sign and i'm telling you we saw it and we heard it in brother branham's ministry amen and we all also have experienced it here while here while a word is being preached god has discerned conversations and home experiences and provided strength and guidance through his preach word the messiah sign is still on display amen amen look at this now i am trying to get through this look at this i want to go to questions and answers part three we saw it in brother branham's ministry now we're not here to exalt brother branham but we are exalting christ and we're showing you how christ was manifested through he's the manifest to work for his ministry was a manifested word for this day same thing we've become manifest the word for our day now look at this look at this this question that's being asked and questions and answers part three says please explain people are saying brother branham is more than a man he can create and jesus can look just like brother branham brother ramsay this is what people are saying so this is a question that comes up it says now the person said this whoever it might be i don't know but i'm your brother see jesus is your savior i cannot be your savior for he has already saved you now look at this now you're so close to being the truth there and yet so far from the truth so we kind of trying to get right in the middle in the middle uh we don't want people want to be fanatics but we don't want to be unbelievers either we're trying to get right in the middle you you're so close to being the truth there and yet so far from the truth the person that told this person this now looks like a woman's hand write very beautiful handwriting did not say that was a woman's hand right wouldn't you brother capps when you think that was a woman's hand right pretty hand right and i don't know who it is see says now uh brother branham now notice he just said i don't know who it is he can see the writing and he just assumed that it's the woman's handwriting he said but i don't know who wrote this you gotta understand he wouldn't know until god showed him he couldn't do nothing until god showed him any vision had to come from god that's why we worship god amen look at this now brother branham could jesus look like you or you be jesus or something like that one sense of the word that's exactly the truth another sense of the word it's and it's an antichrist it's depend on how you're leaning that's the difference between right and wrong to make me the person of the lord jesus christ would be an antichrist see for that person of the lord jesus is sitting at the right hand of majesty on high and will come again in great power and glory but for his life that was in him being upon me and upon you who have him is exactly the truth and you you become christ they didn't teach me that in my old church you become christ when uh when people are looking for messiah today they can point them to you the messiah it says you remember my message on messiah see there you are the word messiah means the anointed one now you are if you have the holy spirit you become the anointed one see then there's all kind of anointed ones now i cut that quote off there i cut that off there because this is a very long quote but i want to read just a little bit more in this amen so uh it says uh now watch if it's a bible anointed when many of them are knowing it see the whole thing in such a great conglomeration of every kind of a mix-up my and of satan with all of his cunningness and in an impersonated just to the dot almost to the dot there's only one way you can absolutely be sure check the word by word word by word that's the only way you can check it out of the scripture i believe the message because it's in the scripture amen i can read it right out of the bible what god promised amen he says but to me as a person william branham or any other man or woman to be the lord jesus christ our savior that is an error but to be anointed with his spirit which brings his own person of his life into you let's keep going it was it was uh it was so beautifully typed in elijah and elisha when elisha was taken when i was taking the uh uh taking up the elijah and the old prophet going home and he was tired and weary and there was a chariot hooked across the river there and he took him up home with horses of fire and did you notice then when elijah and elisha crossed the river the school of the prophets was up there watching him and elijah took his mantle or struck the river and when it did divide it and he went across and he said to the young prophet what are you following me for what do you wish you know i wanna i wanna just leave it there for a second even when uh john told a tor he just mumbled on his breath he says uh behold the lamb of god they were already following the words but what were they looking for when they left john and start following christ what were they looking for i can say the same thing he likes was looking for a double portion what do you wish he said that a double portion of your spirit come upon me a double portion of that mighty prophet come upon me he says you asked a hard thing but if you see me when i go away then i'll cut then it'll come upon you so you can imagine how he watched the prophet keep going says now in that day that prophet was the word for he was the manifestation of the word to the world see and he know there had to be a greater ministry come oh i'm i'm i'm just reading because they required a greater thing and when jesus was here on earth he was the elijah these things that i do say you do also greater than these shall you do because i go into my father now how you going to do it watch him who is he the word see watch them let me go on a little further now when it comes to creation of things it's true jesus never writes straight out created anything and brought it into existence he took a substance first he turned water into wine he had the substance first glory to god he took bread and multiplied it he took fish and multiplied it but actually just to create he didn't do that that was a ministry left for another day to fulfill scripture [Applause] look it was a ministry left for another day to fulfill scripture that he spoke himself jesus said if you say to the mountain and don't doubt in your heart you can have what you say and a prophet was out hunting and couldn't get nothing confined nothing but a scripture why he was hunting was quick unto him do you believe the word yes i believe it well you ain't preached it do you believe it well what scripture is this if you say to the mountain be thou remove and be thou amen cast in the sea don't doubt any heart you can have what you say do you believe that yes i believe it you say well what you hunting for squirrels speak hey glory to god speak and call for the squirrel know that you wait on god for call for it you open up your mouth son of man can these bones live they won't live until you speak to them you called for the squirrels [Music] took god at his word i'll take a squirrel here i'll take one there i take one here got the squirrels and got two out of the three and then said lord i thank you for the squirrels and i'm going on home he said no it ain't what you said you said three squirrels that's what you want you're gonna wait here till you get three sit there and say lord this was i don't i never never operated like this one time in my life i don't know what i'm doing you spoke for it watch for it wait for it [Applause] oh i felt i felt that one there's many things we don't spoke for now we wait for it don't get in a hurry just wait i know god know what you spoke and just because it's taking a long time you see see that's that that's that messiah ministry right there oh hallelujah discernment right there god know exactly what you spoke now he wants you just to wait and don't change your confession while you're waiting so you waited you called for three you wait for it and waited and there it was it come right out there did exactly what he did and what he asked it to do he told to do something impossible let it jump over here and do this and do that ain't no squirrels now you're supposed to be in that area shot it anyway lord i thank you for scrolling and now make it and make it sure god allowed him to speak squirrels into existence twice twice and then he shares the testimony with us yeah i believe that and they say and and hattie wright believed it too had it right say uh when he was telling the testimony he had to write said i ain't nothing but the truth he said the same god that provided a ram for abraham is the same god that provided a squirrel for me had it right said ain't nothing but the truth eddie you just your amen just please god [Applause] your attitude just please god he says i'm gonna prove to you i'm a prophet you say whatever you ask god for right now hattie you can have it now not not not ten years from now right now if you want a million dollars you'll get it right now that's how that's how i mean if if you needed a million god will give it to you right now if you needed it but we don't need it because we lose our way when we get too much money and stop us from praying hey man stop us from fasting when we when we get the overflow we don't know how to handle the overflow yet amen yet i ain't preached nothing yet lord have mercy but had it right said amen that's nothing but the truth say had it whatever you asked for god said you'll give it to you right now oh i'm a false prophet say a man was sitting there eating i'm glad his plate was clean because his face fell in his plate underneath the anointing that was in the house had he looked around she said well what do i actually say now i'm not the one that can tell you what to speak had it's got to come from your mouth see i know your parents are getting old and they're sickly and everything we can pray for that your sister's been prayed for for years they've never been healed we done and here's the thing brother branham said about her sister edith i believe her name said edith in the midst of her sickness had the right attitude and so she still had joy on her face even in the midst of her sickness it said just did something for him when she come in in a wheelchair still smiling it just did something it's the same way when sister carter would come through here in a wheelchair man was another church one time brother matt watkins got the preaching sister carter put the wheelchair in forward up to the front of the church amen amen amen i'll never forget that and i'm gonna tell you who i'm gonna tell you another person that'll never forget that the devil will never forget that that she can put it in for in church yeah he said she had the right attitude in the midst of her sickness but he says uh he said he says maybe we can pray for her and i should be healed right now hattie i don't know what to taste i know you're poor i know you need money had if we prayed for that uh you know you get money right now but i can't tell you and he told her all these things amen outside of what she really wanted she looked around the room and god knew what was in hattie that's why he gave her the question had an axe with nothing material had to say you know what i had all the things that i need and i desire i want the salvation of my two boys now ain't that asking for double yeah amen but see you had to worry that just right oh my god you got to know how to word it just right salvation covered the whole family salvation of them two boys he said well you can have it right now thus saith the lord prayed and then boys were saved right there began to cry out underneath the anointing of the holy ghost and immediately god changed them it don't take god a long time to change nothing all we got to do is get our hearts right amen say amen to the word and watch god go to go to work on your behalf let me let me try to finish that i i i just bring that up because i don't have that in my notes uh i was gonna skip around in this but there was something that i read in my office this morning i just wanna bring it says now when it comes to creation of things it's true jesus never writes straight out created anything and brought into existence he took a substance first he took water made wine he took bread and made more bread he took fish and made more fish but he promised that greater things than this would be done see you see now why it's it's in a more evil day than it was when he was here did y'all get that because we are living in a greater day of evil we gonna need more power so i'm telling you what to expect as you see the devil getting out of control you just expect that this gonna rise up in you when you have need of it it will be there it's more evil day than it was when he was here see it's still him but using your tabernacle see and this person that's in you which is your birth you are john doe you were born in a certain month and you were born under a certain star you were born under a certain thing and that has something to do with you your makeup certainly does oh my i used to papa you say i can't i plant the potatoes at this time because the moon isn't right you can't plant them potatoes billy and i said i'm not planting them in the moon i'm planting them here in the ground now he had and see so you tell him what his daddy said his dad are trying to say you don't plant right now son you're not going to get the results but he wanted to be a smart aleck look he said all right smart alec go on you get a few bumps on your head you'll learn something look what this look what brother randall say i did i did says uh now this part i'm just have to skip this now go on 110. all right y'all can go back and get that but uh go on to 110 this is where i want to go now remember we're not the word uh but we are the words remember we're not the word but we are the word right uh-huh now you gotta jesus was not god but he was god he was a man yet he was god he could cry and yet he could raise the dead he could cry for a man being dead and raise him back up again he was jehovah jairus over raphael jehovah manassas he was jehovah all completely he was jehovah and yet he was a man he owned the earth and made the earth and had not a place to lay his head all right now and they said the birds that i made has got nests and i haven't got a place to lay my head the foxes that i created has holes in the ground that i and i haven't got one myself even to be buried in that's right he had to borrow somebody's grave to be buried in he created a womb that was in a woman he had a wound to be born in he had to borrow a wound uh he had no woman to be born and he had to borrow a womb he created the earth and had not a place to be buried he had to borrow a hole in the ground to be buried and joseph of arimathea see they had to borrow a place yet he was god prove that he was god now you understand we are not then he says we are messiahs but not that jesus he is our father we're just anointed with the spirit and that's the reason it's life and that gets people see if you don't sit and think it through it gets people to believe well this guy would be the messiah sure he is this one over here could be oh see he didn't leave it on himself they would think man this guy could be the messiah sure he is it's the anointing that's on the guy that makes him a messiah and that same holy ghost anointing is dwelling inside the church amen says ashurius this one over here could be they both are and how can these be how can it be two of them there are thousands of them i i'm saying i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them thousands of them see but you see his life is separated on the day of pentecost when that pill of fire came down it separated like tongues and set upon each of them god divided himself among his people because the church and christ is one just as husband and wife is one all right i um i i had y'all just let me get one more quote and then i'm gonna leave you up with some scriptures and i'll let you go i i had some other things but i'll just out i'll forgo them i'm going back to the message of messiah going to paragraph 32. he says this no wonder elijah laid his body upon that dead baby and it come to life it was god in that man god it took over he he was anointed jesus said he was every prophet of god in the old testament was a was anointed with the holy ghost they were then they were lesser lights he was the fullness of god being messiah they was messiahs then smaller messiahs for they were anointed with the same spirit that he was anointed with only he had it in the fullness and every man today that's received the true baptism of the holy ghost is anointed with the same spirit that jesus of nazareth was that went about doing good and healing the sick oh my that makes me feel good to know he lives today look at this there's something about a man he is a god he was made to be a god his purpose here on the earth was to be a god to have a dominion over everything in the earth oh my now don't let that stagger you because i got some more scriptures wrote down here see so i love that statement man was made to be a god man and when we when we when we we pray and we seek god the reason that we're going to him is because we know that he can do something with the situation but the reason god called you is because he know him in you can do something with the situation he said he had some scriptures wrote down i'ma give y'all just a few of these scriptures genesis 1 26. god said let us make man in our own image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea know the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth let them that's male and female and i would you know i was early i forgot to mention this but when i read the quote i'm going to john 10 and next says when i read the quote about how a policeman can stand out there and stop the traffic he don't have power but he got authority and as i was reading that quote it just came back to me say even my wife and sister shonda thinks this is a tina i mean these sisters were were crossing guards amen they didn't even have uh the same um they didn't stand in the same place as a police officer but because they wore a uniform and they stood in that corner and they had to watch them kids in the crosswalk i don't care what you want to do if they were standing in a crosswalk with their hands up that meant stop don't i know you're in a hurry you got to go somewhere i i can't even write you a ticket but i still got authority i have to call the policeman to write you the ticket but i got authority you must stop as brothers and sisters we have that same authority let's use authority john 10 34 says this jesus answered them is it not written in your law i said ye are gods if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came and he and scripture cannot be broken say ye of him whom the father hath sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemes because i said i am the son of god psalms 82 6. look at this even david wrote it i have said ye are gods not objects to be worshipped amen but you certainly have the authority of heaven backing you up so you can control situations i have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high john 14 12. verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than thee shall he do because i go unto my father also verse 19 and 20 and john 14 yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me because i live ye shall live also look at this at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you and i just wanna i wanna leave you with this last scripture here out of revelation 22 and i just find it amazing that the very last chapter of the bible god would put the ministry of the bride in that chapter showing that this whole thing amen to get her abroad ready a bride to recognize who she was oh i i i i was thinking on this song and amen i i'ma leave but my my aunt wrote a song if you're looking to rise rise in the morning if you're looking to rise rise in the morning if you're looking to rise you better get ready in the evening time she then she wrote another voice she said if you're looking for the voice yeah if you're looking for the voice if you're looking for the voice [Music] if you're looking for the voice of the resurrection his voice where you gonna find christ today in the bride and the bride has a ministry according to revelation 22 17. here it is and the spirit glory to god the spirit and the bride say come them brothers amen when they found jesus we found the messiah they went telling everybody come glory to god we saying the same thing the spirit and the bride say come to this living word come to this manifested word come to this revealed word for this day if you're looking for christ you'll find him in the manifestation of his word the spirit and the bride say come and let him that hear say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely revelation 22 17 praise the lord god bless you church amen present tense messiah glory let's pray father we thank you for your word thank you lord that you sent a prophet to bring us truth to remind us where we come from and where we're going there's nothing lord that
