[6:30] amen we pray amen
[6:34] amen and uh we want to take the
[6:36] scripture here from uh psalm 91
[6:40] and it reads on this why why is it signs
[6:42] up
[6:43] he that dwelleth in the secret place
[6:46] of the most high shall abide under the
[6:49] shadow
[6:50] of the almighty amen
[6:54] and i say unto the lord he is my refuge
[6:58] and my fortress my god in him
[7:02] will i trust surely
[7:06] he shall deliver thee from the snare
[7:09] of the fowler and from the uh
[7:12] know it the the noisome pestilence
[7:16] he shall covet thee with feathers and
[7:19] under the wings
[7:21] shall thou trust his truth
[7:24] shall be thy shield and thy buckler
[7:28] thou shalt not be afraid in the hour if
[7:30] they're not shall not be afraid for the
[7:32] terror
[7:33] by night nor for the arrow
[7:36] that flieth by day nor for the
[7:39] pestilence that walk in the darkness
[7:42] nor for the destruction that wasted
[7:45] in noonday amen and uh we'll we'll just
[7:48] kind of start with the reading right
[7:50] there but we're going to get into that a
[7:51] little bit
[7:52] more but i want us to go back and i want
[7:54] us to kind of focus on the first
[7:57] uh uh chapter there um
[8:00] no doubt many have uh used this
[8:02] scripture in these trying times
[8:05] you what we're going through with this
[8:08] virus and
[8:09] uh this plague government that that has
[8:12] that has circled the globe and and and
[8:14] and have kind of disrupted
[8:16] amen a normal way of doing things
[8:19] i've heard this scripture written by
[8:23] read by all types of people everybody is
[8:26] running through this scripture at this
[8:28] pow
[8:30] everybody's running through this
[8:31] scripture to fight try to find comfort
[8:34] and man in some sort of peace amen but i
[8:37] want you to recognize one thing here
[8:40] and the first chapter here it says
[8:44] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[8:47] the most high
[8:49] shall abide under the shadow of the
[8:52] almighty
[8:53] now many are reading this scripture but
[8:55] see the first the first chapter here
[8:58] gives us uh specifically
[9:01] to who this belongs to
[9:04] it says to he that dwelleth in
[9:08] the secret place so now i i i i i i'm
[9:12] not even afraid my brothers and sisters
[9:15] that that that that this scripture amen
[9:19] pertains to a particular
[9:22] group of people it ain't no anybody just
[9:26] grab this scripture
[9:27] and say oh well i'm going to just make
[9:30] myself
[9:31] fit right into the scripture amen you
[9:34] have to be and you have to be
[9:36] dwelling in the secret place
[9:40] now you might ask well what are you
[9:41] talking about man where is this secret
[9:44] place i want to
[9:45] if you turn your attention over here to
[9:47] joshua
[9:48] the second chapter we're gonna look into
[9:50] a few things this evening
[9:52] amen and i i i pressure you uh pray that
[9:55] you keep me in your prayers
[9:57] amen uh study a little bit on this
[10:00] secret place amen uh uh
[10:04] uh if i had to title this message
[10:07] i don't want to go any further without
[10:09] giving it a title the title of this
[10:11] message was
[10:12] he that dwelleth in the secret place
[10:17] amen he that dwelleth in the secret
[10:19] place
[10:20] so we see here in uh joshua
[10:23] the second chapter it says and joshua
[10:25] the son of none sent
[10:26] out spitting the two men to spy secretly
[10:30] saying go view the land even jericho
[10:34] and they went and came up to the
[10:37] harlot's house
[10:38] named rahab and they lodged there
[10:43] and it was told to the king of jericho
[10:46] behold that came in and hitler
[10:50] uh tonight of the children of israel
[10:53] to search out the country amen and the
[10:56] king of jericho
[10:57] sent unto rahab saying bring
[11:00] forth the men that i come
[11:04] to thee which are entered into thine
[11:07] house
[11:08] for they be uh come to search out the
[11:11] country
[11:12] and the woman took the two men and
[11:15] heared them and said thus
[11:18] there came men unto me but which
[11:22] which uh not which they wear
[11:26] now i want you to notice something here
[11:28] very peculiar here
[11:29] i'm very interested in this story up to
[11:31] this point
[11:32] uh raham this this this
[11:36] harlot woman and man just to give a
[11:38] little background
[11:40] she had a house and then a house lived
[11:43] upon the wall
[11:44] a man of jericho amen
[11:48] and uh uh just to give a little
[11:50] background and a little
[11:52] context to this story here uh uh
[11:55] they haven't heard about what was going
[11:57] on amen they had heard about
[12:00] the the issue of these people that that
[12:02] had
[12:03] left egypt and how god
[12:06] had uh delivered them they had heard
[12:08] about
[12:09] amen how how how uh uh
[12:12] uh it was plagues and things amen that
[12:16] had
[12:16] happened there in egypt amen to uh uh
[12:19] convince
[12:20] pharaoh to let these people go
[12:23] amen and uh uh uh uh they they had heard
[12:27] about
[12:28] amen the deaf angel that came through
[12:30] the land
[12:31] amen and smoke all of the firstborn of
[12:34] the egyptians
[12:36] they had heard about tales of all of
[12:38] these things
[12:39] amen so rahab here knew
[12:42] they meant that that they that hurt that
[12:45] that this great army amen was
[12:48] approaching
[12:49] to take the city amen so
[12:53] she had a choice to make she lived in a
[12:56] great wall
[12:57] city and much like today this wall this
[13:01] city
[13:02] uh was was was was striving very well
[13:06] amen they had they were comfortable
[13:09] behind their walls amen they had a
[13:13] booming economy amen and
[13:16] uh their government was strong and
[13:18] stable and they had
[13:20] they had all of these things and they
[13:22] were quite comfortable
[13:24] but they began to hear tales of
[13:27] of a people coming that had an
[13:30] inheritance
[13:31] amen that they were going to claim the
[13:33] land
[13:36] so they had i mean so ray have
[13:39] a man a a living a man on this wall
[13:43] no doubt she had a clear vantage point
[13:47] amen that she could she could see from
[13:49] afar
[13:51] these men also was able to use the
[13:54] rahab's house
[13:55] for the exact same reason amen and they
[13:59] uh she had a choice
[14:02] rahab had a choice to make amen she
[14:06] could choose
[14:07] a man to to offer assistance
[14:11] amen to to to to this great move of god
[14:16] amen oh she she she could have
[14:20] chosen to to to turn these men over to
[14:23] the king
[14:24] of jericho now we see that rahab made a
[14:28] choice
[14:30] she made a choice being a harlot
[14:34] amen being a a a woman
[14:37] a man that that was not in the promise
[14:40] of god at all
[14:42] amen she had no lineage uh to speak
[14:46] of she was a sinner she
[14:50] the gospel was not even to her she was a
[14:54] heathen woman amen but she
[14:58] made a choice amen amen to receive
[15:02] these spies into her house
[15:05] amen these spies amen uh uh that joshua
[15:10] had sent them to spy the land
[15:13] so in doing so amen ray have
[15:17] uh uh uh kind of uh put herself
[15:20] in a really good position amen because
[15:24] see
[15:24] uh what they came with they came with
[15:27] the word of god
[15:29] for that day they were god's people
[15:33] moving amen by the will of god
[15:38] amen so she what she did was
[15:41] she she got herself amen right in the
[15:44] way
[15:45] amen and she made herself an intricate
[15:48] part
[15:49] amen of the move of god amen
[15:52] she made herself a part of what was
[15:55] going on
[15:56] in that day amen she
[15:59] she was a person amen that didn't know
[16:02] religion
[16:03] they were idol worshipers amen and
[16:07] they served amen the god of abraham
[16:10] isaac and jacob and they said that the
[16:14] lord thy god is
[16:15] one amen so and she she
[16:18] turned she turned on from her wicked
[16:22] ways
[16:23] amen and she gave help to the message of
[16:27] the hour
[16:28] she gave assistance to god
[16:32] amen at that various time
[16:35] amen are you with me glory to god
[16:38] and uh uh let's read on and the woman
[16:41] took the two men
[16:43] and it came to pass amen that
[16:46] the men had came and everything and and
[16:48] she told them to go one way and they
[16:50] shut the gate
[16:52] amen she did not tell the men where
[16:55] where the spies were she
[16:56] hid them in her house
[17:01] very important i want you to just keep
[17:03] that and tuck it away
[17:05] she hid those men
[17:08] amen in her house
[17:11] now something very important i want you
[17:13] to recognize because that was the word
[17:15] of god
[17:17] amen that was the that was the avenue
[17:20] that
[17:20] god was working through at the time what
[17:23] she did
[17:24] was she heard the word she hear
[17:27] the message of that hour in her house
[17:31] amen and the story goes on that uh
[17:36] before they laid down amen she came up
[17:40] amen to the roof and she said unto them
[17:43] i know
[17:44] that the lord has given you this land
[17:48] my god she said i know
[17:51] so right there this hard woman
[17:54] had faith in the word of god amen
[17:59] she believed that that that in this word
[18:02] of god
[18:03] and she said uh and that your terror is
[18:07] falling
[18:08] upon all the inhabitants of the land
[18:12] and faith because of you and we have
[18:15] heard
[18:16] how amen the lord dried up the waters
[18:19] of the red sea for you when you came
[18:22] out of egypt and what ye
[18:26] did to the kings of the amorites
[18:29] and were on the other side of jordan and
[18:32] sihan and all
[18:33] whom he utterly destroyed
[18:36] amen she was paying attention
[18:40] and as soon as we had heard these things
[18:44] our hearts did melt
[18:47] neither there remain any more courage in
[18:51] any man because of you and the lord your
[18:55] god
[18:56] he is god in heaven
[19:00] and above listen at this woman's
[19:02] testimony
[19:04] she is declaring that your god
[19:07] amen is god amen
[19:10] she made a declaration amen for
[19:14] for for herself amen she had
[19:17] a respect and a reverence for the word
[19:21] of god
[19:22] in that hour amen glory to god
[19:28] hey man we see today amen
[19:31] many people some time how uh uh uh
[19:34] in the day's time local ministers are
[19:37] trying
[19:38] to tell people about a great message of
[19:40] deliverance for us
[19:42] and our families in this day and we
[19:45] treat them with such
[19:47] disrespect like they are almost
[19:50] uh entrusting people on the earth
[19:54] and then wonder why there is no token
[19:58] for their families amen dealing
[20:02] with today's ministry the five-fold
[20:04] ministry with such
[20:06] disrespect and wonder amen
[20:10] while your children amen may be battling
[20:13] certain things
[20:14] wonder why there's no victory in your
[20:17] home
[20:18] wonder why you just can't seem to get a
[20:21] breakthrough
[20:22] amen it's because of a lack of respect
[20:25] amen
[20:26] for the gospel amen and it came to pass
[20:29] in the seventh day
[20:31] and they wrote early about drawing the
[20:33] day
[20:34] and compassion about the city at the
[20:37] same manner
[20:38] seven times i can only imagine this
[20:41] harley rahab
[20:43] sitting on the top of the wall looking
[20:46] over and seeing
[20:48] amen this uh uh uh this great army
[20:52] as they marched around the wall for
[20:54] seven days
[20:56] quietly and on that seventh day
[20:59] they began to march more they march
[21:02] seven
[21:03] times amen she knew that the time
[21:07] amen was at hand amen
[21:11] but she had made provisions amen
[21:14] she had aligned herself a man
[21:17] on the winning side amen she had aligned
[21:20] herself
[21:21] amen with a guard because she had seen
[21:25] the manifestations of the victory of
[21:28] this god amen
[21:30] no doubt they were on the other side of
[21:33] the wall
[21:34] uh uh uh googling what to do maybe
[21:39] amen they were probably making idle
[21:42] worship praying to their wooden statues
[21:45] to deliver them from what was coming
[21:48] amen there was a judgment amen that was
[21:52] on the way
[21:53] amen no doubt we can see that the king
[21:56] was in a panic amen my brothers and
[21:59] sisters much like today
[22:01] amen we have a virus in the land
[22:04] amen that represents judgment amen let
[22:07] me tell you something my brothers and
[22:09] sisters
[22:10] amen when you see a plague like this
[22:12] these kind of things are a direct
[22:14] relationship to sin
[22:16] it's a direct relationship to sin in the
[22:20] lives of the people
[22:21] amen it is judgment it is a form of
[22:26] judgment upon the land and judgment was
[22:29] coming to jericho
[22:31] but this woman they have a man this
[22:34] holy woman amen this heathen woman
[22:38] who did not have no god this
[22:41] idol worshiper amen she made a decision
[22:46] amen at a point in time amen
[22:49] that she would align herself with god
[22:52] amen she began to seek out
[22:54] amen away of escape
[22:57] amen she began to seek out how could i
[23:00] save myself
[23:02] and my family cause she understood that
[23:05] surely
[23:06] amen after hearing and seeing the
[23:09] manifestations
[23:10] of this god that there was definitely
[23:12] going to be trouble
[23:13] amen she had no confidence no more
[23:17] confidence in the walls
[23:19] amen she had all confidence in the god
[23:22] of abraham
[23:23] and isaac and jacob amen
[23:27] and she gave honor to them she gave
[23:30] assistance to them
[23:31] she was kind to them and she aligned
[23:34] herself
[23:35] on the winning side i asked you this
[23:38] evening my brothers and sisters
[23:39] are you on the winning side are you
[23:42] aligning yourself in this hour
[23:45] amen with all of the signs and wonders
[23:47] around you
[23:48] are you allowing yourself on the winning
[23:52] side
[23:53] amen we see how fragile
[23:57] our walls are amen within
[24:00] a matter of months we see the economy
[24:03] totally collapsed amen we see the
[24:07] republican party fight against the

[51:59] be born there because he was the bread
[52:02] of life

[54:39] my brothers and sisters
[54:42] that the prophet preached a message

[1:03:32] hearers of lord god
[1:03:34] lord god may the word of god penetrate
[1:03:37] lord god
[1:03:38] that someone realized that we're living
[1:03:41] in the last days
[1:03:43] oncoming judgment lord
[1:03:46] and and and lord these things that we
[1:03:49] place so much
[1:03:50] confidence in our military
[1:03:55] our financial system
[1:03:58] our medical system is not enough lord
[1:04:04] we must not be hidden
[1:04:08] in the secret place where you promise
[1:04:11] lord god
[1:04:12] to keep us just like you did rehab but
[1:04:16] because she was obedient lord
[1:04:18] and many man may hear this word this
[1:04:21] evening
[1:04:23] it's in your lap this evening
[1:04:27] rahab had a choice
[1:04:30] she had heard the word just like you've
[1:04:33] heard the word
[1:04:34] this evening and she had a choice to
[1:04:37] make
[1:04:39] whether to listen to the king
[1:04:43] and and and and and have depend
[1:04:46] on those walls or to find
[1:04:51] a hiding place and we see that only to
[1:04:55] hot to find that hiding place
[1:04:58] she had to have respect
[1:05:01] she had to receive the word of the hour
[1:05:05] and in order to receive the word for the
[1:05:07] hour
[1:05:08] she had to hide those messengers she had
[1:05:11] to receive
[1:05:12] god's messengers amen that came with
[1:05:16] the message of salvation for her day
[1:05:21] those that hear this word lord god may
[1:05:23] something strike in their heart
[1:05:25] that they may have a yearning lord to go
[1:05:28] into that upper room
[1:05:30] and be shut in with god we ask these
[1:05:33] blessings in jesus name
[1:05:35] amen
[1:05:49] praise the lord certainly grateful for
[1:05:52] the word of god tonight
[1:05:54] and um coming from our precious brother
[1:05:56] troy
[1:05:57] and just um much to just kind of
[1:06:00] meditate on and
[1:06:02] as we look at that scripture as you're
[1:06:03] saying in psalms 91 everybody
[1:06:06] is claiming that and everyone's holding
[1:06:08] on to that but
[1:06:10] if you're not really dwelling in the
[1:06:12] secret place
[1:06:13] of the most high uh then you can't
[1:06:16] actually claim that scripture and i
[1:06:19] thought it was a beautiful type and
[1:06:21] using rehab
[1:06:23] you know when when the walls of jericho
[1:06:25] came down you go back and read the
[1:06:27] scripture
[1:06:28] rahab's house was actually on top of the
[1:06:30] wall and uh so that tells us that
[1:06:33] when the wall to jericho came down there
[1:06:35] was only one spot
[1:06:37] on the wall that did not fall
[1:06:41] and everybody that was inside her
[1:06:44] house they were dwelling in the secret
[1:06:46] place
[1:06:47] if you were outside you were not in a
[1:06:49] secret place you know you had to be
[1:06:51] in her house where the scarlet threat
[1:06:53] was out of the window
[1:06:55] which represented a token that had been
[1:06:57] given to her
[1:06:58] and and that was the only place of
[1:07:00] protection and
[1:07:01] and today uh god has given us that and
[1:07:04] we find it in christ
[1:07:05] and uh not just uh that's a very a
[1:07:08] general term when we say in christ
[1:07:10] but uh you know rahab received a message
[1:07:14] she received the messenger she received
[1:07:16] a message
[1:07:17] and uh and today we invite people to
[1:07:19] receive this message that god has sent
[1:07:21] through his prophet william mary and
[1:07:23] branham
[1:07:24] uh regardless of what any anybody says
[1:07:26] there's things that we're seeing today
[1:07:28] um in our you know in our world it's not
[1:07:31] just something here
[1:07:32] in the u.s but it's the entire world
[1:07:34] that is on lockdown
[1:07:36] uh everybody's impacted but we had a
[1:07:38] prophet tell us that these things were
[1:07:40] were to come and um so as we see things
[1:07:44] unfold
[1:07:44] we're not alarmed amen we have been
[1:07:47] prepared
[1:07:48] because we have received word from a
[1:07:50] prophet and uh
[1:07:51] and we're hiding in a secret place and
[1:07:53] even you know when the prophet preached
[1:07:55] uh
[1:07:56] the message the rapture the scripture
[1:07:58] that he chose to use
[1:08:00] was psalms 27. so i thought that was
[1:08:02] very very appropriate again that brother
[1:08:04] troy was led to go there
[1:08:06] uh because uh you know we we were i was
[1:08:09] just talking with a brother to dave
[1:08:10] brother solomon he was saying
[1:08:12] you know it's um you know we we need uh
[1:08:15] we find safety we find all these things
[1:08:17] when the pressure is actually hitting
[1:08:19] like this so
[1:08:20] uh the wrap this pressure is going to
[1:08:21] produce a rapture and
[1:08:23] we're under expectation for it but you
[1:08:25] must be dwelling
[1:08:26] in the secret place if you want to a man
[1:08:30] make it in this hour praise the lord so
