[5:16] we see the clouds start moving real fast
[5:19] about a quarter of a mile to half a mile
[5:21] to our left to the East and then it
[5:23] began to form a tornado we could see it
[5:27] coming down and see it coming up like
[5:29] this and as we were riding we could see
[5:30] it start coming this way and we just
[5:33] kept moving on
[5:35] by God's grace he made a way for us to

[5:43] Hallelujah
[5:45] so many times he kept he's kept us all

[6:20] indicting a good matter
[6:22] I speak of the things which I have made
[6:24] touching the king my tongue is the pen
[6:27] of a ready writer Thou Art fairer than
[6:31] the children of man Grace is poured in
[6:33] into thy lips therefore God has blessed
[6:36] thee forever
[6:38] gird thy sword upon thy thigh o most
[6:41] Mighty with thy glory and thy majesty
[6:44] and in thy Majesty ride prosperously
[6:47] because of the truth and meekness and
[6:49] righteousness and thy right hand shall
[6:51] teach the Terrible Things thine arrows
[6:54] are sharp in the hearts of the kick of

[7:11] hath anointed thee with the oil of
[7:14] gladness above thy fellows

[29:27] so we're going to try to be real short
[29:29] our path bring greetings from our church
[29:31] spoken word church or pastors both
[29:34] Samuel Dale
[29:35] and brother Dale's always said blessed
[29:37] is the preacher who can testify and not
[29:39] preach so
[29:42] I'm gonna build be real brief this
[29:45] morning but it's good to be here this
[29:47] morning
[29:50] I'm not going to get choked up
[29:54] but it's wonderful to be here
[29:57] I have a I've watched for quite a while
[30:00] online
[30:01] and uh so I'm the one that brother Jack
[30:04] told you all about last Sunday
[30:07] I'm guilty as charged
[30:10] but uh it's good to be here and I
[30:12] appreciate each one of you
[30:15] and the word is going forth
[30:18] and uh
[30:19] I tell everybody that y'all worship on
[30:22] Sunday I worship with y'all on Mondays
[30:24] and Tuesdays
[30:27] and uh so I work on I work
[30:30] in maintenance and lots of times I'm on
[30:33] the roof by myself so I've got an ear
[30:35] for my radio in this ear and I've got my
[30:37] earbud in this here from my phone
[30:39] and as I'm listening to the services so
[30:42] and I told Brother Simba I appreciate
[30:44] him he puts everybody's name on there so
[30:47] I appreciate that I figure out who
[30:48] people are I don't know everybody's name
[30:51] but I know some of you I know your faces
[30:52] and so I told him I said that I wanted
[30:56] to be I was going to be at a
[30:58] disadvantage here because you only have
[31:00] to learn like five people's names
[31:02] there's quite a few of y'all but I want
[31:04] to I want to be ahead of the game so
[31:07] so I just I just really appreciate the
[31:10] spirit and the word that's went forth
[31:12] all the all the brothers
[31:14] brother Smiley brother Troy and the
[31:17] different ones brother Quentin and
[31:19] brother Jerry
[31:20] it's really been just a blessing and uh
[31:23] so this is my wife Sarah
[31:25] and my sister that's my sister Janine
[31:27] and then our son
[31:30] Adam and then Levi's over by the wall
[31:33] but uh
[31:35] [Applause]
[31:39] and and if I could sing like brother
[31:41] Solomon that's all I'd ever do
[31:44] I tell brother Solomon I've sent him
[31:46] messages how much it's just really meant
[31:48] to to hear you know because it's not
[31:50] just about leading singing It's about
[31:51] worshiping the Lord
[31:54] I've told many young people that they
[31:56] get hung up on
[31:58] playing their instruments or singing and
[32:01] I said it's not you're not doing this to
[32:03] a crowd he said you're singing and
[32:05] glorifying the Lord I said that's the
[32:07] only person that matters is him
[32:09] if we just lift him up so what if you
[32:12] make a mistake so what if we forget the
[32:13] words
[32:15] we're just worshiping the Lord
[32:18] and so I appreciate each one of you and
[32:21] uh if if without taking too much time

[32:29] if I could say something this morning no

[55:07] um
[55:09] this is actually one of my favorite
[55:11] passages amen I like Luke four uh but we
[55:17] just trust the Lord will just kind of
[55:19] direct us on today and I'll be starting
[55:22] a man that um verse 16.
[55:27] here in Luke 4.
[55:33] praise the Lord
[55:39] the Bible says and
[55:42] he came to Nazareth
[55:45] where he had been brought up
[55:47] and as his custom was he went into the
[55:52] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[55:54] for
[55:55] stood up for to read
[55:58] there was delivered unto him the book of
[56:01] the prophet
[56:03] um izius or Isaiah
[56:05] and when he had opened the book he found
[56:08] the place where it was written
[56:11] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[56:15] because he hath anointed me
[56:18] to preach the gospel to the poor he had
[56:22] sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[56:25] to preach Deliverance to the captives
[56:27] and recovering of sight to the blind to
[56:30] set at Liberty them that are bruised now
[56:31] I'm not a uh
[56:35] a person that plugs too much but I will
[56:39] and I don't watch a lot of movies amen
[56:42] but I did watch The Chosen
[56:45] amen and uh when they did this scene
[56:49] uh
[56:51] uh it's just something that just kind of
[56:53] rolls up in me like you know the the the
[56:57] the the the the the the written word had
[57:00] become the manifested word
[57:04] and they had a hard time receiving that
[57:08] amen amen amen but I'm not gonna that's
[57:12] that's part of my subject but let me
[57:14] just try to keep reading here uh verse
[57:16] 19 says to preach the acceptable year of
[57:19] the Lord
[57:21] and he closed the book
[57:24] and gave it again to the minister
[57:28] and sat down in the eyes of all them
[57:30] that were in the synagogue were fastened
[57:33] on him
[57:34] and he began to say unto them this day
[57:38] is this scripture
[57:42] fulfilled in your ears
[57:46] and I'll bear him witness and wonder
[57:48] that the gracious Words which proceeded
[57:50] out of his mouth and they said is not
[57:53] this
[57:54] Joseph's son
[57:56] and he said unto them ye will surely say
[57:58] unto me this proverb physician heal
[58:01] thyself What Shall We Have Heard done a
[58:03] Capernaum do also here in that country
[58:05] and he said verily I say unto you no
[58:07] Prophet is accepted in his own country
[58:11] but I tell you of a truth many widows
[58:13] were in Israel in the days of Elias when
[58:15] the heaven was shut up three years and
[58:17] six months when the great when Great
[58:19] Famine was throughout all the land but
[58:22] unto none of them was Elias sent
[58:27] save unto Sarepta city of sidon unto a
[58:31] woman that was a widow
[58:33] and many lepers were in Israel in a time
[58:36] of
[58:37] elysius the prophet and none of them was
[58:41] cleansed saving Naaman the Syrian let's
[58:46] pray father
[58:48] God we thank you for the privilege and
[58:52] the opportunity we have to read
[58:54] scripture
[58:56] but we know it takes the Holy Ghost to
[58:58] help us to understand and apply what we
[59:03] have read
[59:04] so I trust Lord that you would take
[59:06] control over the thought here this
[59:08] morning may you bless your people of
[59:11] those both those present those that were
[59:14] not able to join us those that are
[59:16] joining online look Lord to each and
[59:19] every one of your people and bless them
[59:20] abundantly God we give you the glory and
[59:23] honor in Jesus name we pray amen and
[59:27] amen God bless you it can be seated
[59:31] I did forget to mention that I am
[59:35] grateful for
[59:37] um the time of Fellowship we had last
[59:39] night with the couples uh just a really
[59:42] really wonderful wonderful event
[59:46] um thank God for just Italian sister
[59:48] Erica just working behind the scenes to
[59:51] to make that what it was and um looking
[59:54] forward to to more of that we want to
[59:56] strengthen the couples the families amen
[1:00:00] and and
[1:00:01] um uh in the church because you know
[1:00:03] since the time we're just sharing
[1:00:04] something with me and she was saying how
[1:00:06] she heard on I believe on the radio that
[1:00:08] in every uh we have this Earth that we
[1:00:11] live on but on the earth is divided into
[1:00:14] uh uh Nations or countries and then uh
[1:00:19] when you get into those Nations or
[1:00:20] countries countries you have to start
[1:00:22] dividing down to States and when you get
[1:00:25] to States then you start going down to
[1:00:27] counties and from counties down to
[1:00:28] cities and then even down the towns and
[1:00:31] that at the core of all of that when you
[1:00:33] get down to the bottom of it's just
[1:00:34] people families that are holding all
[1:00:38] that together if the family is broken
[1:00:40] apart then the city is not any good and
[1:00:43] the town is not good then that affects
[1:00:45] amen the county it affects the state it
[1:00:48] affects the nation it affects the world
[1:00:51] so we have to do things to strengthen
[1:00:53] the family
[1:00:56] amen praise the Lord amen and that is
[1:01:00] Our intention Amen to do that so we
[1:01:02] thank God for that uh on last night and
[1:01:05] we'll be doing more we'll be doing more
[1:01:07] to to to to today I'm going to get
[1:01:10] started in the subject I will forewarn
[1:01:13] you that I will not finish this thought
[1:01:15] on today amen if you want to hear the
[1:01:19] end of the start you got to come back
[1:01:22] praise the Lord but uh but nevertheless
[1:01:25] it's enough for us to get started and I
[1:01:28] just want to use the the title God is in
[1:01:32] his man amen God is in his man
[1:01:38] praise the name of the Lord so the
[1:01:42] prophet gives us uh just a little story
[1:01:46] that I'd like to start out with in the
[1:01:49] sermon God is in his word brother
[1:01:51] Brandon preaches a number of sermons
[1:01:53] around uh this little theme of God is in
[1:01:58] and he would put God is in his word God
[1:02:01] is in his son God is in his people uh
[1:02:06] and I preached a number of sermons on
[1:02:08] that I did a series a few years ago on
[1:02:10] that uh God is in uh and today we're
[1:02:14] picking up God is in his man but
[1:02:17] um I actually never preached that part
[1:02:19] so in order for me to preach God is in
[1:02:21] this man I'm gonna have to go back and
[1:02:23] pick up some of the other things that I
[1:02:25] preached before Amen to bring us forward
[1:02:28] but nonetheless we will enjoy the
[1:02:31] journey but here in the sermon God is in
[1:02:34] his word brother Branham makes a
[1:02:35] statement he says sometime go there was
[1:02:39] an old fisherman down on the River where
[1:02:42] I live and the little boy used to go
[1:02:45] fishing with him
[1:02:47] this little boy was a Christian boy and
[1:02:50] he went to Sunday school so one day he
[1:02:53] asked mama he said Mama is there any way
[1:02:57] that we could ever see God Amen and um
[1:03:01] you know why she said honey I don't know
[1:03:05] says ask your Sunday school teacher so
[1:03:08] Mama's just passing the book right ask
[1:03:11] your Sunday school teacher uh so he went
[1:03:14] and asked the Sunday school teacher and
[1:03:16] said uh and she said I don't know the
[1:03:19] same question you know can anybody see
[1:03:21] God and and the Sunday school teacher
[1:03:23] says I don't know glory to God and uh so
[1:03:26] the Sunday school teacher says ask the
[1:03:29] pastor they passed the book to the
[1:03:31] pastor and the Pastor said no you can
[1:03:34] never see God no man can see God and
[1:03:39] that discouraged the little boy amen he
[1:03:43] had a he had a question that was in his
[1:03:45] heart that Mama couldn't answer he had a
[1:03:49] question that the Sunday school teacher
[1:03:50] couldn't answer he had a question that
[1:03:53] the pastor gave an answer to but it did
[1:03:55] not satisfy the deep that was still
[1:03:57] inside the boy amen so here we go on in
[1:04:01] this quote so one day uh up on the river
[1:04:03] near the Six Mile Island he was up with
[1:04:07] the old fisherman there come up a storm
[1:04:09] and as the old fisherman was coming back
[1:04:12] down the river with uh with the white
[1:04:14] Gray beard hanging over his bosom the
[1:04:17] little boy sitting in the stern of the
[1:04:19] boat and and the rhythm of the oars on
[1:04:22] the water as he pulled the boat there
[1:04:25] was a rainbow came out amen and all this
[1:04:29] old fisherman started looking to the
[1:04:31] rainbow as he pulled his oars and a
[1:04:34] little fellow noticed that that tears
[1:04:36] was running down his cheeks amen and he
[1:04:39] said excitedly he run up towards the
[1:04:42] stern of the boat he said sir I'm going
[1:04:43] to ask you a question that my mama
[1:04:46] Sunday school teacher up Master could
[1:04:48] not answer me he said if God is so great
[1:04:51] why can't we see him he thought he had
[1:04:54] stumped this old fella amen and look at
[1:04:58] the answer he says uh he says can any
[1:05:00] man see God sir it got the old fisherman
[1:05:03] he pulled the oars in his lap and took
[1:05:06] the little boy in his arms he said God
[1:05:08] bless your little heart honey all I've
[1:05:11] seen for the past 40 years has been gone
[1:05:16] hallelujah amen you see you see you have
[1:05:20] to have God in here to see God out there
[1:05:25] if you haven't got him in here you'll
[1:05:28] never see him out there but you got to
[1:05:31] have him Amen on the inside
[1:05:34] so he finally runs into somebody that
[1:05:36] could actually answer his question and
[1:05:39] the way that this man answers his
[1:05:40] question is through his experience
[1:05:44] blessed be the name of the Lord amen I
[1:05:47] believe everybody desires to see God
[1:05:49] everybody desires to grow closer to God
[1:05:52] to know this God that we talked about we
[1:05:54] talk about so much uh and and I'm just
[1:05:57] kind of circling back Amen to my my
[1:05:59] series that I did a while ago and who
[1:06:01] knows if the Lord has us pick it all up
[1:06:03] again we'll do that but uh but I want to
[1:06:06] go back and I'm just kind of giving some
[1:06:07] highlights from it amen but I want to
[1:06:10] talk about God as in his people if
[1:06:12] you're looking for God Amen you can find
[1:06:14] him sometimes in his people
[1:06:18] glory to God you can find him in his
[1:06:21] people and you know one of the one of
[1:06:24] the stories in the scripture amen that
[1:06:26] we're all familiar with is the story of
[1:06:28] Abraham amen and Abraham and Sarah and
[1:06:32] and uh uh Abraham being the father of
[1:06:35] faith and I like how you know one
[1:06:37] brother put it I was listening to him
[1:06:38] preached this morning and he says a god
[1:06:40] did not connect to Abraham's flesh
[1:06:43] because his flesh was not worth being
[1:06:45] connected to the man was a liar the man
[1:06:48] sold his wife and sold his wife out
[1:06:50] twice God weren't connecting to his
[1:06:52] flesh God was connecting to his faith
[1:06:56] hallelujah amen and we're Abraham's seed
[1:06:59] through that Faith right so so so so uh
[1:07:02] you know in the life of Abraham God
[1:07:04] chose him and and even even though he
[1:07:06] went through all these things where he
[1:07:08] was you know to us he looked like a
[1:07:09] complete failure but when you read about
[1:07:11] him over in the Book of Romans amen just
[1:07:13] seemed like he's a I mean he he kept the
[1:07:16] faith he never got weak in faith he
[1:07:18] strong in faith always giving glory to
[1:07:20] God and amen I mean he seemed like a
[1:07:23] super Christian but when I look at him
[1:07:25] in Genesis I don't get that picture of
[1:07:28] him praise the Lord that's the way amen
[1:07:30] God feels about you maybe when you
[1:07:32] looked at yourself you don't see nothing
[1:07:34] but God sees a man a Son of God and a
[1:07:37] daughter of God and Overcomer
[1:07:40] hallelujah amen God don't see you as
[1:07:44] defeated God see you with the victory
[1:07:48] Hallelujah I don't care what you're
[1:07:49] going through God see you already with
[1:07:51] the victory he's already giving you the
[1:07:54] victory
[1:07:55] just waiting for you to claim it and
[1:07:57] walk in it
[1:07:58] amen but Abraham was one that we we you
[1:08:01] know we look at him in scripture and God
[1:08:03] used certain things in his life one in
[1:08:05] particular is when he took his son amen
[1:08:08] up the mountain and it's just it's just
[1:08:10] a beautiful story and and I found out
[1:08:12] that the same Mountain that Abraham
[1:08:14] offered Isaac on was the same Mountain
[1:08:16] that Christ died on right I mean a
[1:08:19] beautiful story when you when you get a
[1:08:21] chance to look at it but uh but when we
[1:08:22] look at this Abraham was portraying
[1:08:25] Christ amen by taking the Sun up the
[1:08:28] mountain to be sacrificed Isaac was the
[1:08:32] promised son a man and considered thine
[1:08:35] only son according to the scripture
[1:08:37] right also Isaac was led up the mountain
[1:08:40] just as Christ was led to the Cross amen
[1:08:44] amen the same Isaac that was laid on the
[1:08:47] altar was also raised from the altar
[1:08:50] Amen in the same Jesus that was laid in
[1:08:53] the grave was raised from the grave so
[1:08:55] when we look at the story of Abraham and
[1:08:58] Isaac we can see that God was hidden in
[1:09:01] his people
[1:09:02] foreign
[1:09:04] Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah let's go
[1:09:07] with a little statement here from the
[1:09:09] the message God has identified by his
[1:09:11] characteristics and look at what um you
[1:09:14] know the prophet tells us here he says
[1:09:16] watch the characteristics of God says
[1:09:20] picked up a handful of dust and thrown
[1:09:22] it into the air and it turned into fleas
[1:09:25] he's talking about Moses here he says
[1:09:27] the Creator characteristic of God was in
[1:09:32] Moses and I just though that's a
[1:09:34] statement that I like to highlight the
[1:09:36] Creator
[1:09:38] characteristic of God was in Moses amen
[1:09:42] and Moses spoke in Deuteronomy 18 15 and
[1:09:46] it said the Lord your God shall raise up
[1:09:48] a prophet liken unto me
[1:09:51] oh hallelujah amen now let me just just
[1:09:55] pause there just for a second uh because
[1:09:58] what we're going to see in this as I
[1:09:59] keep reading this quote that Prophet
[1:10:01] like and unto uh when Moses said the
[1:10:04] Lord your God will raise a prophet like
[1:10:05] it unto me we know that he was talking
[1:10:08] about Christ we know that however amen I
[1:10:12] would like to also add that I believe
[1:10:14] that scripture that Moses when he spoke
[1:10:17] that had dual meanings
[1:10:20] and not just me I mean meanings it's
[1:10:22] it's talking about different ones we
[1:10:25] know it's talking about Christ we got
[1:10:26] that part hallelujah amen but but when
[1:10:29] we look at the New Testament and and
[1:10:31] Paul having the ability to write
[1:10:34] two-thirds of the New Testament just
[1:10:36] like Moses had the ability to write the
[1:10:38] beginning of the of the Old Testament
[1:10:40] the first five books amen God gave him
[1:10:43] that oh my God gave him that God gave
[1:10:46] something to Paul to be able to write
[1:10:48] two-thirds of the New Testament Paul
[1:10:50] could be considered a prophet like unto
[1:10:53] Moses
[1:10:55] do we have an amen in the house
[1:10:57] Paul could be considered amen as a
[1:11:01] fulfillment of a prophet like unto Moses
[1:11:03] but I don't live in the days of Paul and
[1:11:06] there were some things that happened in
[1:11:08] the day in which we live amen there were
[1:11:10] seven seals on the back of a book amen
[1:11:13] there were no Seven Seals were revealed
[1:11:15] a prophet it took a prophet to reveal
[1:11:18] that word to us and when that Prophet
[1:11:21] took the word and opened it up nobody
[1:11:23] else had that responsibility God gave it
[1:11:26] to that prophet and when he opened it up
[1:11:29] then we can look at that Prophet as a
[1:11:32] fulfillment of the scripture a prophet
[1:11:35] like unto Moses
[1:11:38] amen amen the Creator characteristic
[1:11:42] of God was in Moses
[1:11:44] look at this and Moses spoke in
[1:11:46] Deuteronomy 18 15 said the Lord your God
[1:11:49] shall raise up a prophet like it unto me
[1:11:51] now watch that's the word again
[1:11:54] characteristic God's speaking through
[1:11:57] Moses telling them that the Lord would
[1:11:59] raise up one like him it was God
[1:12:01] speaking through Moses amen telling them
[1:12:05] the Lord will raise up one like him now
[1:12:07] notice how Jesus characteristics
[1:12:10] identified him to be this promised word
[1:12:13] when Moses said it would be the
[1:12:15] character of Jesus identified it notice
[1:12:17] now the Lord your God that's that's God
[1:12:21] that's the word shall raise up a prophet
[1:12:23] like unto me whoever won't believe that
[1:12:26] Prophet will be cut off from among the
[1:12:29] people
[1:12:31] and we see it manifesting itself all
[1:12:33] over again today amen whoever won't
[1:12:36] believe that Prophet will be cut off
[1:12:37] from among the people now watch when
[1:12:39] Jesus came what kind of a characteristic
[1:12:42] was he to have see notice now the
[1:12:45] promised word he promised to be a
[1:12:47] prophet like Moses now I want to just
[1:12:50] kind of dwell on that amen that that
[1:12:52] creative characteristic of God that was
[1:12:54] in Moses Moses called for the ten
[1:12:57] plagues uh water uh Eternal Ward into
[1:13:00] blood a frogs lice flies livestock boils
[1:13:04] uh hell mingle with fire Locust Darkness
[1:13:07] death of the firstborn all these plagues
[1:13:09] that Moses called for uh called for that
[1:13:13] creative characteristic was in Moses a
[1:13:17] man but we also see that same uh
[1:13:20] creative characteristic uh especially
[1:13:23] the spoken word glory to God because
[1:13:25] when Moses say Let There Be There was
[1:13:28] amen and that only came from God because
[1:13:30] God started that off in the beginning in
[1:13:33] Genesis let there be light and there was
[1:13:36] Let There Be flies and there was Let
[1:13:39] There Be frogs and there was amen and
[1:13:43] when you go back and you look at the
[1:13:44] scripture I don't have time to do all
[1:13:46] this but you go back you look at the
[1:13:47] scripture we'll pick up one little verse
[1:13:49] where say and the Lord
[1:13:51] did that thing
[1:13:56] the Lord did that thing how was the Lord
[1:13:59] doing that thing through Moses God was
[1:14:03] in a man
[1:14:11] uh but we see Moses uh calling for all
[1:14:15] these things and it was that creative
[1:14:17] characteristic of God
[1:14:19] we see that same creative characteristic
[1:14:22] manifested in the Lord Jesus when he
[1:14:24] spoke to a tree and said no fruit be on
[1:14:26] you anymore forever that tree withered
[1:14:29] in 24 hours Jesus changed the situation
[1:14:33] with the spoken word
[1:14:35] amen amen when Jesus spoke the word to
[1:14:38] the Centurion servant amen the man say
[1:14:42] I'm not worthy that you come underneath
[1:14:44] my roof but if you would just speak the
[1:14:46] word only I know my servant would be
[1:14:50] made whole this man had a confidence
[1:14:52] that just the words of Jesus was enough
[1:14:55] for his servant
[1:14:57] oh Hallelujah just the words of Jesus
[1:15:01] sometimes just your words is enough to
[1:15:03] turn the situation around because the
[1:15:06] creative characteristic dwells inside of
[1:15:09] you if you have the Holy Ghost
[1:15:12] that's right brother hey I'm talking
[1:15:15] about the same God that said let there
[1:15:17] be that God is living inside of you
[1:15:22] the creative characteristic was found in
[1:15:24] Jesus when he said peace be still to the
[1:15:27] storm that was on the on the sea my God
[1:15:31] the winds and the waves were acting
[1:15:32] contrary but he said peace be still and
[1:15:35] and even the disciples said what matter
[1:15:37] man is this that even though winds and
[1:15:40] the waves obey him
[1:15:43] oh my that man lives inside of us
[1:15:46] God is in his man
[1:15:48] God is in his woman
[1:15:51] amen Jesus healed the sick gave the
[1:15:53] disciples the same power to cast out
[1:15:55] devils and I like to say this when Jesus
[1:15:57] gave him the greatest disciples uh Power
[1:16:00] to cast out Devils it was it was more
[1:16:02] than just salvation he was actually
[1:16:04] further in the ministry of Christ in his
[1:16:08] people
[1:16:09] glory to God we thank the Lord John 14
[1:16:12] and 12. says verily verily I say unto
[1:16:16] you he that believeth on me the works
[1:16:18] that I do shall he do also and Greater
[1:16:21] Works in thee shall he do because I go
[1:16:23] into my father's the furthest of the
[1:16:25] ministry see it says and whatsoever ye
[1:16:27] shall ask in my name that will I do that
[1:16:29] the father may be glorified in the son
[1:16:31] if he should ask anything in my name I
[1:16:35] will do it
[1:16:37] amen amen God was in his people
[1:16:41] glory to God we find it uh uh I want to
[1:16:44] look at another characteristic I love
[1:16:46] the way brother Branham just titled that
[1:16:48] sermon God is identified by his
[1:16:50] characteristics but another
[1:16:51] characteristic that I want to show that
[1:16:53] was just kind of in um in his people was
[1:16:56] that Resurrection characteristic amen
[1:16:59] the resurrection characteristic was
[1:17:01] found uh in Elijah amen and then Elisha
[1:17:05] asked for a double portion of Elijah's
[1:17:07] spirit so when Elisha received a double
[1:17:10] portion of Elijah's Spirit then then
[1:17:13] that Resurrection characteristic was
[1:17:15] passed on to Elisha oh hallelujah amen
[1:17:19] uh uh uh this was a type of Christ in
[1:17:22] the bride the resurrection
[1:17:24] characteristic we know was in Christ no
[1:17:27] man take my life I lay it down I'll
[1:17:28] raise it up again in three days and he
[1:17:31] did exactly what he said he would do but
[1:17:33] that Resurrection characteristic now is
[1:17:35] dwelling inside of us we've seen people
[1:17:37] raised from the dead
[1:17:39] God is still raising from the dead it's
[1:17:42] not just something that happened in
[1:17:44] Bible days it's still happening right
[1:17:45] here
[1:17:47] hey man we've seen people where they
[1:17:49] they code it
[1:17:50] glory to God and after the word of
[1:17:52] prayer life came back into their bodies
[1:17:54] we have experienced that right here
[1:17:56] we've been in church and saw a young man
[1:18:00] leaving
[1:18:01] not just getting up walking out of
[1:18:03] church he was dying in the church
[1:18:05] Hallelujah in the middle of the service
[1:18:07] he was dying but we began to pray for
[1:18:09] him
[1:18:10] and before you anointed he came right
[1:18:12] back
[1:18:13] Hallelujah he was getting cold in the
[1:18:15] service not because of the AC his life
[1:18:18] was leaving him but we saw God resurrect
[1:18:21] that young man
[1:18:24] the resurrection characteristic is still
[1:18:26] here
[1:18:27] glory to God we see Elisha amen but
[1:18:31] Elijah performed eight Miracles but Eli
[1:18:34] shall perform 16 Miracles Elijah there
[1:18:37] was no rain for three and a half years
[1:18:39] the meal and the oil amen was sustained
[1:18:42] for the widow woman he raised the widow
[1:18:44] woman's son he he opened the Jordan
[1:18:46] River amen over this some of the
[1:18:48] Miracles also amen Elisha he opened the
[1:18:51] Jordan River amen the oil flowed to pay
[1:18:54] off the debts I like that Amen Oil flow
[1:18:58] the payoff debt all the lady had to do
[1:19:00] is get some jugs get as many jugs as you
[1:19:04] can borrow from everybody you can but
[1:19:07] just get the judge because they're gonna
[1:19:08] be full
[1:19:09] and you're going to use this to pay off
[1:19:11] your debt and I love the way God do
[1:19:13] things God not I see you only praying
[1:19:15] for God to pay off your debt
[1:19:17] but I want to tell you something God
[1:19:19] thinking a little bit further than you
[1:19:21] he not only want to pay off your debt he
[1:19:23] want to give you overflow
[1:19:27] he want to give you leftovers praise God
[1:19:32] that's the God we serve not just meet
[1:19:35] your need but do the exceeding the
[1:19:39] abundance above all you can ask or think
[1:19:42] that's the God that I serve
[1:19:49] Hallelujah
[1:19:51] not just paying off my debts I want
[1:19:53] money left in the bank
[1:19:55] after the deaths have been paid
[1:20:00] Elisha cause an ax head to swim
[1:20:05] there's a woman that could not have a
[1:20:07] son and he he gave her a baby
[1:20:10] come on God was in his man God was in
[1:20:12] his people amen another dead son raised
[1:20:15] he laid his body over the boy and he
[1:20:17] sneezed seven times
[1:20:18] amen uh uh and you know and and even
[1:20:21] even Elisha's bones was found in a grave
[1:20:24] there was Miracles still happening after
[1:20:27] Elijah died
[1:20:32] America was still happening even after
[1:20:34] he died
[1:20:36] he never said a word but there was
[1:20:39] anointing inside of his bones
[1:20:42] Hallelujah that when they threw the dead
[1:20:44] man over a soldier been fighting the
[1:20:47] battle brother you better know where to
[1:20:49] be buried
[1:20:52] we all Gotta Die but you better know
[1:20:55] where to be buried
[1:20:56] that Soldier amen he just threw him into
[1:21:00] the the bones of Elijah and before you
[1:21:03] know the man jumped back up on his feet
[1:21:05] but his sword in his head was ready to
[1:21:07] fight again
[1:21:09] miracle happened from my bones
[1:21:16] God proved that he was in his people
[1:21:21] amen amen amen and even I'ma just throw
[1:21:24] this in while we're here even even
[1:21:26] brother brother Branham we saw that that
[1:21:28] that that that that that uh Resurrection
[1:21:31] characteristic in his ministry
[1:21:34] because what brother Brandon prayed for
[1:21:36] a brother One Time by the name of Elijah
[1:21:38] and he didn't know why but he just found
[1:21:40] himself stretched on top of his brother
[1:21:42] and before he knew he had something
[1:21:44] grabbing a hold of his ear
[1:21:46] and he said and the brother was just
[1:21:47] saying brother Brandon brother Brandon
[1:21:49] brother Branham and he laying on top of
[1:21:51] the brother he like I don't even know
[1:21:52] why I did that he did it because it was
[1:21:54] spilled in the scripture that's what
[1:21:56] Elisha Elijah did in the scripture
[1:21:59] so that same spirit that was only Elijah
[1:22:01] was on the prophet in this day God was
[1:22:03] in his man
[1:22:05] brother Wade dropped dead in the service
[1:22:08] and brother Wade dropped dead because he
[1:22:10] disagreed with what the prophet said you
[1:22:13] got to watch your attitude
[1:22:15] when you went underneath the anointed
[1:22:17] you got to watch your attitude but he
[1:22:19] disagreed what the prophet said and he
[1:22:21] dropped dead right in the service his
[1:22:23] wife being a nurse could not do anything
[1:22:25] the church was in the stair brother
[1:22:26] Brandon said y'all been taught better
[1:22:28] than that
[1:22:29] don't act like that right now
[1:22:31] suggest Everybody by your hand he went
[1:22:33] and prayed for the brother and God
[1:22:35] brought him right back up
[1:22:37] hallelujah hallelujah amen that creative
[1:22:40] or that that Resurrection characteristic
[1:22:42] was found in his ministry
[1:22:45] what about the mother
[1:22:47] who had a dead baby
[1:22:49] for hours the baby was dead down in
[1:22:51] Mexico
[1:22:52] and it's all she all she knew is that I
[1:22:55] saw there's a man that's been blind in
[1:22:57] my city for years and now this man can
[1:22:59] see I need to know where he went
[1:23:02] at what meeting did he go to because I
[1:23:05] know this man could not see let's say

[1:23:15] rain didn't care what nobody said I
[1:23:16] gotta get to this meeting I can't even
[1:23:18] speak the Evangelist language but if he
[1:23:21] prayed for that man I want him to pray
[1:23:22] for my baby
[1:23:23] and that lady was going through the
[1:23:25] ushers Amen brother Branham say uh
[1:23:28] brother Jack why don't you go down and
[1:23:29] pray for her because she don't know the
[1:23:31] difference between me and you and he

[1:23:35] not know Usher could get this lady come
[1:23:37] I mean she would go through their legs
[1:23:39] with a dead baby you talk about
[1:23:41] determination

[1:24:08] baby or not but everybody stop bring her
[1:24:10] on up here got up there and and he
[1:24:13] prayed for the baby and God brought the
[1:24:15] baby right back to life after hours of
[1:24:18] being dead
[1:24:22] that Resurrection characteristic
[1:24:25] and and that baby only was dead for
[1:24:27] hours Lazarus was dead for days

[1:28:46] that means just pause
[1:28:48] and think about it
[1:28:54] amen
[1:28:56] brother random makes a statement here in
[1:28:58] the message
[1:29:00] what shall I do with Jesus called Christ
[1:29:04] God is in his universe
[1:29:07] it says this in New York last week I was
[1:29:10] listening at a message quoted or said by
[1:29:12] Einstein
[1:29:14] says the great scientist what is called
[1:29:16] the brain of the time
[1:29:21] then I went to hear Norman Vincent peel
[1:29:23] on his psychology about how people
[1:29:26] should do or walk and project themselves
[1:29:29] into psychology
[1:29:31] on Einstein he was speaking of a galaxy
[1:29:33] that was out between the system there
[1:29:35] out from Stars
[1:29:40] or and if a person could travel at the
[1:29:42] speed he says I believe he said of light
[1:29:44] what is it uh a hundred and eighty six
[1:29:47] thousand miles per second that light
[1:29:49] travels
[1:29:51] and break that down in five minutes how
[1:29:53] many millions and billions of Miles
[1:29:55] you'd be in a hundred and twenty million
[1:29:58] years of light time it would take you to
[1:30:00] get to that Galaxy
[1:30:02] so it's another galaxy a whole nother
[1:30:04] Galaxy right it would take you 120
[1:30:07] million years of light time it would
[1:30:09] take for you to get to that Galaxy or a
[1:30:12] 150 million uh years 150 Millions over
[1:30:15] and 150 150 million there and 150
[1:30:19] million back he says and they hit
[1:30:21] something that stopped them
[1:30:23] so after going out there and coming back
[1:30:25] you could you'd actually take you three
[1:30:28] million years to uh uh and I guess you
[1:30:32] mean 300 million uh years to make the
[1:30:35] trip 300 million years 300 million years
[1:30:37] to make the trip and when you come back
[1:30:39] to earth actually you've only been gone
[1:30:41] 50 years
[1:30:44] brother random say you break into
[1:30:46] eternity there's no end to it
[1:30:52] another statement that he gives us a man
[1:30:55] here in uh the world is falling apart
[1:30:58] let me just see something here yes in
[1:31:01] the world the world is again falling
[1:31:03] apart it says no wonder we're falling
[1:31:05] apart
[1:31:06] it says there's nothing the very thing
[1:31:08] that created the Earth this very thing
[1:31:10] was put here for the earth to turn on
[1:31:13] the very thing that system and
[1:31:15] everything else was to revolve around
[1:31:16] this work this word that by God frame
[1:31:19] the world Einstein said
[1:31:21] there is only one explaining of the
[1:31:24] scripture only one explaining for this
[1:31:27] world being in existence it's Einstein a
[1:31:31] great scientist this is the only thing
[1:31:32] he come the world is again falling apart
[1:31:34] it says um it says there is only one
[1:31:37] explaining of the scripture only one
[1:31:39] explaining for this world being in
[1:31:42] existence that is Hebrews 11 by faith we
[1:31:48] understand that the the by the word of
[1:31:51] God that the worlds were frame my amen
[1:31:56] the worlds were framed together by the
[1:31:58] word of God it says that's all there is
[1:32:01] no one can tell how it hangs there in
[1:32:03] the air and how it can turn around and
[1:32:05] make his 24 hours around the Equator so
[1:32:08] forth like that and around this orbit
[1:32:10] everywhere and come back to the same
[1:32:12] spot and and never miss a second every
[1:32:15] Star turning on a cycle like that and
[1:32:18] helping one another as they go around
[1:32:22] I mean it's just amazing that God was
[1:32:24] set up like this right now we're we're
[1:32:25] moving and don't realize we're moving
[1:32:29] amen amen but God has orchestrated it
[1:32:32] amen in such a way and as as as as
[1:32:35] Einstein was just looking at galaxies I
[1:32:37] just start you know doing just a little
[1:32:39] research and again these some my
[1:32:41] previous notes there are uh from from
[1:32:44] what we were taught in school and now
[1:32:46] things changing they keep finding so
[1:32:48] much so many other things you don't know
[1:32:50] what what what what what to believe
[1:32:52] but when we were coming up they told us
[1:32:54] there was eight planets
[1:32:56] they told us that it was Mercury Venus
[1:32:59] Earth Mars Jupiter
[1:33:03] Saturn uh Neptune and Uranus that's what
[1:33:08] now I think they've added some more
[1:33:09] since then Pluto
[1:33:12] it took Pluto out
[1:33:18] it's just all kinds of stuff but I like
[1:33:20] the number eight
[1:33:24] let them argue about whatever they want
[1:33:26] to argue about because God is in his
[1:33:28] numbers
[1:33:33] God and when you see eight you know
[1:33:35] eight represents the number of new
[1:33:37] beginning
[1:33:38] Hallelujah somebody amen so so they told
[1:33:41] us about the eight planets we also amen
[1:33:44] I had to I had to you know as I was
[1:33:45] reading just that quote there I had to
[1:33:47] go back and find well what is a galaxy
[1:33:49] see a galaxy is a group of stars and
[1:33:52] other space stuff
[1:33:57] now now that's what the scientists have
[1:33:59] to call it space stuff
[1:34:01] but God know what he put out there
[1:34:03] and God know why it's there
[1:34:07] the Stars tend to spin around a center
[1:34:10] of high gravity
[1:34:11] sort of like the planet spin around the
[1:34:14] Sun in the solar system galaxies are
[1:34:17] huge and can have trillions of stars
[1:34:20] amen as big as galaxies are they are
[1:34:24] generally separated by large areas of
[1:34:26] empty space
[1:34:28] my there are even clusters of galaxies
[1:34:31] that are separated by even larger areas
[1:34:33] of space look at this scientists think
[1:34:36] they are over 100 billion galaxies
[1:34:41] and I just had to say wow the universe
[1:34:43] is huge
[1:34:45] and here's what the prophet said the
[1:34:47] prophet said God is just like the air
[1:34:50] he feels all the universe
[1:34:54] God feels all the universe all
[1:34:57] this pace
[1:34:58] [Music]
[1:35:04] and if you've got a little empty space
[1:35:06] in your heart this morning
[1:35:08] that same God that fills the universe
[1:35:12] he wants to feel your heart
[1:35:17] we just so happen to live in the Milky
[1:35:20] Way
[1:35:20] that's the Galaxy we lived in the Milky
[1:35:22] Way is part of a cluster of around 300 3
[1:35:25] 000 galaxies called the local group Amen
[1:35:28] in the Milky Way is a spiral-shaped
[1:35:30] Galaxy and it's estimated to be made up
[1:35:33] of about uh 300 billion stars God is in
[1:35:37] all of that God is in his universe and I
[1:35:40] mean even even now that they get that
[1:35:42] that that uh great telescope that they
[1:35:45] have yet but they call the name of it
[1:35:46] Hubble all right but but uh they're
[1:35:49] seeing things out there they've never
[1:35:51] seen before they just they finding they
[1:35:53] just it's just it's it's it's uh uh
[1:35:56] they're all struck when they run into
[1:35:58] these things it's God in this universe
[1:36:02] yeah amen
[1:36:06] hearing the message show us the father
[1:36:09] and it suffices us
[1:36:14] brother random makes a statement not
[1:36:16] long ago
[1:36:18] there was an Infidel passed through the
[1:36:20] lands
[1:36:22] making infidels out of supposedly to be
[1:36:25] Christians
[1:36:26] now ain't that something this man is
[1:36:29] passing through the land and then people
[1:36:31] that are Christians are converting to be
[1:36:34] infidels
[1:36:36] now uh I think as I've seen that Spirit
[1:36:39] again
[1:36:41] people that uh people that's supposed to
[1:36:43] be a man message Believers now they
[1:36:46] don't know what they believe
[1:36:48] and all it is it was a spirit that kind
[1:36:52] of jumped on somebody and until you
[1:36:54] recognize the spirit you don't you you
[1:36:56] won't you won't catch it all you think
[1:36:58] you've got smart but you're under Spirit
[1:37:00] under a delusion
[1:37:03] you thought you got some new knowledge
[1:37:05] Eve thought she did too
[1:37:07] but it's a delusion
[1:37:10] and that's why you end up in darkness
[1:37:13] Hallelujah I mean people can't even hold
[1:37:16] on to what they believed in Pentecost
[1:37:17] before they came to the message
[1:37:20] things they believed in Pentecost they
[1:37:22] can't hold on to it
[1:37:23] they end up in darkness
[1:37:26] look at this now look at this uh infidel
[1:37:30] pass through the lands making everything
[1:37:32] else out of supposedly to be Christians
[1:37:39] Oh my he was so educated
[1:37:43] till the ministers was afraid to attack
[1:37:45] him
[1:37:47] the minister afraid to say anything to
[1:37:49] me I'm so educated
[1:37:50] and then he went to Europe
[1:37:52] and on his road back he got broke down
[1:37:56] look at it he went out into the West to
[1:37:59] make him arrest so now his body's all
[1:38:01] broken down he's sick and now I need to
[1:38:04] go rest and and watch what happens to
[1:38:06] him when he gets out in nature
[1:38:08] Hallelujah
[1:38:11] and one day while he walked out from his
[1:38:14] camp
[1:38:15] oh he swelled himself out
[1:38:17] he began to look down there come that
[1:38:20] whispering of the wind down through the
[1:38:22] pines and he began to look up he looked
[1:38:25] at the at the at those rocks hanging in
[1:38:27] the mountain he said oh rocks who put
[1:38:30] you in the mountains
[1:38:34] the man started talking to the rocks
[1:38:36] have I been wrong about the criminology
[1:38:39] of the world of this world all of a
[1:38:41] sudden God began to speak
[1:38:43] the Bible said if they hold their peace
[1:38:47] The Rock will cry out
[1:38:50] amen God in this universe speaking from
[1:38:53] his rock well that Infidel knelt down by
[1:38:57] the side of a tree said oh God have
[1:38:59] mercy on my soul to same man that was
[1:39:02] converting everybody not got converted
[1:39:04] by looking at one of God's rocks
[1:39:10] see he's hidden and revealed in
[1:39:12] simplicity
[1:39:14] you can just go right over the top of
[1:39:16] God
[1:39:17] look at this look at this God in its
[1:39:20] Universe speaking from his rock where
[1:39:21] that Infidel knelt down by the side of
[1:39:23] the tree said oh God have mercy on my
[1:39:24] soul there you are the pastors were
[1:39:26] afraid to attack him God couldn't let
[1:39:29] the Rocks speak out God's in his
[1:39:31] Universe speaking to his people
[1:39:34] look at what the prophets say I've seen
[1:39:36] the sunset
[1:39:39] stand and cry like a baby
[1:39:42] and you know and and uh one of the
[1:39:45] places that I saw the sunset they
[1:39:46] actually say is going to Key West and
[1:39:49] now I don't advise people to go to Key
[1:39:51] West too much because Key West has got
[1:39:52] some serious Spirits down there no hang
[1:39:55] out there not at night time just go in
[1:39:57] and get out
[1:39:59] but uh we went down there and you know
[1:40:02] and and they say you got to watch a sun
[1:40:04] a sunset here in Key West because what
[1:40:06] happened you sitting there looking at
[1:40:07] the ocean and just seemed like the sun
[1:40:09] just go right down inside the ocean
[1:40:13] and it just it's just a beautiful scene
[1:40:15] the ocean and the sun like that it's
[1:40:16] beautiful scenery right I mean you can
[1:40:19] see God just in his in in nature and
[1:40:21] somehow the next morning that sun can
[1:40:23] come right back up out that ocean again
[1:40:25] it is it is oh it's awesome
[1:40:29] it's awesome God is in his universe
[1:40:32] Hallelujah let's go on a little further
[1:40:34] in this quote he said I've seen the
[1:40:35] sunset stand and cry like a baby just
[1:40:37] couldn't help it glorious to see God in
[1:40:40] the sunset and and his son rise gods and
[1:40:45] his animals you go out here and look at
[1:40:47] the paper this winter and the papers uh
[1:40:50] say tomorrow's gonna be fair and all the
[1:40:53] news commentators say it's gonna be fair
[1:40:55] watch that Old South take the Shucks off
[1:40:58] of the the north side of the hill and
[1:41:00] take them around on the south side and

[1:41:04] paper says no sir it'll be cold just as
[1:41:07] sure as the world go out to hunt find a
[1:41:10] rabbit going down underneath in the
[1:41:12] fallow row watch for snow and cold
[1:41:14] weather sure they got a god-given
[1:41:17] instinct and if you want to know what's
[1:41:20] going to happen with the weather
[1:41:21] oh my watch that little animal he ain't
[1:41:25] tuned into CNN
[1:41:27] he ain't tuned in to the Weather Channel
[1:41:30] but God put something on the inside of
[1:41:32] that animal to know when the weather's
[1:41:34] getting ready to turn
[1:41:35] and they take off for safety
[1:41:39] brother Brandon talked about how them
[1:41:40] animals got together knew her earthquake
[1:41:42] was coming and they got into the middle
[1:41:44] of the film just beginning to bundle
[1:41:46] together and people couldn't understand
[1:41:47] why they was doing that you better you
[1:41:49] better watch how the earthquake is on
[1:41:51] the way
[1:41:52] God is in his animals like that
[1:42:01] let me just give you one more script
[1:42:03] here Psalms 42.
[1:42:05] I am
[1:42:07] coasted
[1:42:09] I'm coasting God is in his people
[1:42:13] God is
[1:42:15] in his universe
[1:42:17] we're gonna We gonna uh we're gonna get
[1:42:19] you know a little bit more as we go
[1:42:21] through this God is in his word
[1:42:24] God is in his son
[1:42:26] and and I just want to pick up here just
[1:42:28] for a little bit
[1:42:29] God is God is in nature
[1:42:33] just for a little bit
[1:42:35] God is in nature and Psalm 42 tells us
[1:42:39] as the heart
[1:42:43] panteth
[1:42:44] after the water Brooks
[1:42:47] see David is looking at something
[1:42:51] David is looking at nature
[1:42:54] and the reason that the heart is panting
[1:42:57] for the water
[1:42:59] is because maybe the heart or the the
[1:43:01] deer we can put it that way the deer has
[1:43:04] uh maybe maybe somebody is hunting this
[1:43:07] deer yeah or maybe there's another
[1:43:08] animal hunting this deer
[1:43:11] and uh maybe they they've reached back
[1:43:13] and they've and as a deer was running
[1:43:16] maybe they grabbed and maybe got a a a
[1:43:18] jaw or something on on the hind quartz
[1:43:20] of the of the leg or something and that
[1:43:22] deer Shake shook himself from it somehow
[1:43:24] and it took off just running yeah now
[1:43:27] this deer is just not running to be
[1:43:30] running
[1:43:31] this deer is run into a very special
[1:43:34] place
[1:43:35] the deer say if I can just I know I've
[1:43:37] been hurt
[1:43:39] I know I've been affected I know I've
[1:43:41] been impacted but if I can just get
[1:43:43] myself to water
[1:43:46] [Music]
[1:43:49] if I get to water then whatever's
[1:43:52] chasing me is in trouble
[1:43:55] if I just make it to water
[1:43:57] they won't be able to find me no more
[1:43:59] and that deal would just run till he can
[1:44:02] get to order once he just gets to order
[1:44:04] it is over for the other animal
[1:44:07] they missed their opportunity and David
[1:44:10] say as the heart panteth
[1:44:13] longing for water
[1:44:15] so does my soul
[1:44:18] my God my God
[1:44:21] so apparently my soul after the O God
[1:44:26] so my my soul my soul my soul my Souls I
[1:44:30] mean see see some of us when we get
[1:44:32] disconnected from God we ought to long
[1:44:33] to get back into the presence of God
[1:44:36] we ought to be longing for water life
[1:44:39] was different when I was at the water
[1:44:43] hey I didn't have to work too hard I
[1:44:45] didn't have to worry too much I just had
[1:44:47] to just take a little drink of water
[1:44:49] my God so my soul thirsts with God for
[1:44:52] the Living God When shall I come and
[1:44:54] appear before God now brother Branham
[1:44:57] tells us amen a little story here and
[1:45:01] actually you know what I'm a I'm going
[1:45:03] to
[1:45:04] um I'm gonna inject something else
[1:45:06] before I go to this next quote
[1:45:09] God is in nature
[1:45:13] yesterday I was listening to a brother
[1:45:15] preach
[1:45:16] his name is brother Doug Lentz amen out
[1:45:19] of Canada
[1:45:20] and uh he was talking on our on our our
[1:45:23] little call that we do there eight
[1:45:24] o'clock in the mornings and I happened
[1:45:26] to get on and this brother just brought
[1:45:28] out something amen that I I don't think
[1:45:30] I ever heard but I knew that I wanted to
[1:45:32] preach this sermon today so I said I'm
[1:45:34] gonna take some of what you what you
[1:45:35] what you laid out I'm gonna have to use
[1:45:37] that I'm incorporating that and I'm
[1:45:39] giving him credit I'm telling y'all his
[1:45:41] name
[1:45:43] brother Douglas but he brought out
[1:45:45] something about
[1:45:47] you know you know there's things that
[1:45:50] I'll read a quote here we'll talk about
[1:45:51] other animals and I just told you about
[1:45:53] the deer and everything how how uh that
[1:45:55] deer types Us and how we need to run
[1:45:57] back to the presence of God but uh this
[1:45:59] this this this this this worm called the
[1:46:01] Tola worm
[1:46:03] now most of us don't really like worms
[1:46:07] unless you're a fisherman you don't mind
[1:46:09] grabbing a worm and putting it on the
[1:46:10] hook and throwing it on out there right
[1:46:12] but uh but but but but but most brothers
[1:46:15] that take their wives fishing with them
[1:46:17] the brother have to be the one to get
[1:46:19] the worm to put the worm on the hook
[1:46:20] because the wife don't want to touch
[1:46:21] that worm we just have a problem with
[1:46:24] worms see them crawling around just just
[1:46:26] but God made him for a reason
[1:46:29] and there's a very unique worm called
[1:46:31] the Tola worm
[1:46:33] my God
[1:46:34] this this worm also has a name a man is
[1:46:39] called the Crimson worm
[1:46:43] amen and uh and I was just reading just
[1:46:46] from a little a website after brother
[1:46:48] duck talked about I went and found this
[1:46:50] Amen on the website reasons uh for hope
[1:46:53] uh reasons for Hope jesus.com and uh and
[1:46:56] they they said this in the life cycle of
[1:46:59] this worm is where uh where the type is
[1:47:02] found and where we talk about the type
[1:47:03] in Christ amen and it points to the work
[1:47:06] of Jesus on the cross now God
[1:47:09] would amen put into a worm
[1:47:13] uh just a little type of what Jesus did
[1:47:17] on the cross
[1:47:19] God would allow something in this worm's
[1:47:23] life
[1:47:24] and in its life cycle to reflect what
[1:47:28] Christ did on the cross if you didn't
[1:47:30] believe in the cross and you were just
[1:47:33] out in nature and you saw this worm it
[1:47:36] might cause you to believe in the cross
[1:47:38] because the story of the Cross is found
[1:47:42] in the worm
[1:47:45] ah
[1:47:46] God is in nature
[1:47:50] look at this when the female crimson or
[1:47:53] the female Tola
[1:47:56] is ready to lay her eggs
[1:48:00] and when she lays the eggs it only
[1:48:02] happens once in her life
[1:48:05] she climbs up a tree
[1:48:10] and attaches herself to it
[1:48:13] with a body attached to the wooden tree
[1:48:18] a hard Crimson shell forms
[1:48:22] forms around her Hallelujah now I want
[1:48:24] you to catch this when she's ready to
[1:48:27] lay her eggs and it only happens once in
[1:48:29] a life she climbs up a tree and attaches
[1:48:33] herself to a tree
[1:48:34] and she attaches herself so uh deeply to
[1:48:37] that tree that the only way you can get
[1:48:39] off is you got the Killer
[1:48:43] she is so attached to the tree
[1:48:45] I got to lay these eggs and this only
[1:48:48] happens once and once in life now I'ma
[1:48:51] tell you before I even get there she
[1:48:52] actually goes to the tree
[1:48:54] to give life but in order to give life
[1:48:58] she has to die
[1:49:01] Jesus was attached to a tree
[1:49:05] and he was attached to the tree to give
[1:49:08] life to us but in order to give life he
[1:49:11] had to die
[1:49:14] in a little worm
[1:49:17] God tells the story of the crucifixion
[1:49:21] in the life of a worm
[1:49:23] let's look at it
[1:49:26] it says uh
[1:49:28] with a body attached to the wooden tree
[1:49:31] a hard Crimson shell forms is a shell so
[1:49:34] hard and so secured to the wood that it
[1:49:37] can only be removed by tearing apart the
[1:49:40] body which would kill the worm
[1:49:43] it says the female worm lays her eggs
[1:49:46] under her body
[1:49:47] under the protective shell when the
[1:49:50] larvae hatched amen they they remain
[1:49:52] under the mother's protective shell so
[1:49:55] the baby worms can feed on the living
[1:49:57] body of the mother Worm for three days
[1:50:01] they feed on Mama's body for three days
[1:50:08] mama
[1:50:11] let me just keep reading after three
[1:50:14] days
[1:50:15] the mother worm dies
[1:50:19] and her baby and and her body excretes
[1:50:24] uh Crimson or Scarlet dye
[1:50:27] that stains the wood
[1:50:31] a crimson die on the wood
[1:50:38] actually you know her babies get their
[1:50:41] color
[1:50:42] from Mama dying
[1:50:45] this how they become red
[1:50:47] oh my God I just see Jesus all in the
[1:50:51] world
[1:51:00] look at this
[1:51:01] the baby the baby worms uh I'm sorry her
[1:51:05] body excretes a crimson or Scarlet dye
[1:51:09] that stains the wood to which she is
[1:51:11] attached and her baby worms the baby
[1:51:13] worms remain Crimson colored for the for
[1:51:16] their entire lives thereby they
[1:51:19] identified as Crimson worms
[1:51:23] on day four
[1:51:26] the tale of the mother worm pulls up
[1:51:29] into her head
[1:51:32] forming a heart-shaped body
[1:51:37] that is no longer crimson
[1:51:40] but has turned into a snow white wax
[1:51:44] that looks like a patch of wool on the
[1:51:47] tree
[1:51:48] it then begins to flick off and drop to
[1:51:51] the ground looking like snow
[1:51:55] and they stuck a scripture yeah a man on
[1:51:58] the process
[1:52:01] come now
[1:52:03] let us reason together
[1:52:06] saith the Lord though your sins be as
[1:52:10] Scarlets
[1:52:12] they shall be white as snow but you got
[1:52:16] to be willing to die
[1:52:19] though they be red like Crimson they
[1:52:24] shall be as wool
[1:52:27] God can be found in nature
[1:52:32] amen amen
[1:52:34] a little worm attaching itself to a tree
[1:52:37] Once in its lifetime
[1:52:39] to excrete a man some red dye over its
[1:52:44] its Offspring had to give life to The
[1:52:47] Offspring on the tree
[1:52:50] but in order to give life
[1:52:53] I have to give up my life
[1:52:55] and let me tell you something ain't
[1:52:57] nothing can stop that Mama
[1:52:59] from going to that tree
[1:53:02] and there was nothing that could stop
[1:53:04] Jesus
[1:53:06] from going to a tree
[1:53:12] God is in nature
[1:53:18] a couple other things that I'll pick up
[1:53:19] here and
[1:53:20] I told you I would not finish this
[1:53:22] sermon today but this is a good stopping
[1:53:24] point
[1:53:27] the uniting time and and sign is where I
[1:53:30] want to read from
[1:53:34] praise the Lord
[1:53:43] I I wanted to just kind of take this
[1:53:45] journey because you know if you like I
[1:53:47] said we got an eight man's in the house
[1:53:48] because if you can see God in nature
[1:53:52] you can see God in the universe
[1:53:55] you can see God in his former prophets
[1:53:58] that have been on scene
[1:53:59] you got to see God as stealing his man
[1:54:02] today
[1:54:03] he's in all these places
[1:54:05] God is hidden and revealed in Simplicity
[1:54:07] don't don't miss him now because you you
[1:54:09] might you might miss God
[1:54:11] here in the in the message United time
[1:54:14] and Son brother random says ducks
[1:54:18] will get together
[1:54:20] every one of them
[1:54:22] and rally around a leader
[1:54:26] and there there are no somehow
[1:54:30] I don't know how they do it but they
[1:54:33] know that that certain little Drake is a
[1:54:36] leader
[1:54:37] now how is it that ducks can figure it
[1:54:40] out
[1:54:41] that this is the one
[1:54:43] this is the one God has ordained the
[1:54:45] lead
[1:54:46] Hallelujah ducks have something in them
[1:54:49] and brother Brandon even talked about
[1:54:50] how one little duck he thought he was a
[1:54:52] leader
[1:54:53] and he started just honking he got and
[1:54:57] every time a duck let out a hunk he
[1:54:58] gonna get a few to follow him everybody
[1:55:00] gets somebody to follow
[1:55:02] come on somebody you just you just don't
[1:55:05] look at it just because somebody's phone
[1:55:06] because everybody gonna get somebody to
[1:55:08] follow
[1:55:09] I don't care what you come up with
[1:55:10] somebody'll follow you you get out there
[1:55:13] you say it enough somebody be on your
[1:55:14] side
[1:55:16] and sometimes I mean what you got to
[1:55:18] watch is not just not not just people
[1:55:20] following but who following
[1:55:23] right
[1:55:24] amen because the sons of Bilal will
[1:55:27] follow you
[1:55:29] hello somebody right you want to know
[1:55:31] who following what type of character is
[1:55:32] this just following amen right so so he
[1:55:36] said he say ducks will get together
[1:55:38] every one of them and rally around the
[1:55:40] leader in there they'll know somehow I
[1:55:42] don't know how they do it but they know
[1:55:44] that that certain little Drake is a
[1:55:45] leader and that little fellow they all
[1:55:48] get together and rally right around him
[1:55:51] and Rise right up in the air and never
[1:55:54] been off that pond now but he'll just go
[1:55:57] as straight to Louisiana Texas as he can
[1:56:00] go to the rice fields see before they
[1:56:03] take their flight to leave their home
[1:56:06] where they've been born that year they
[1:56:08] unite together amen there you are
[1:56:10] rallying around the leader
[1:56:13] and I just love it and said brother man
[1:56:14] said God put something in that leader
[1:56:16] duck he ain't never been to Louisiana
[1:56:18] one day in his life
[1:56:20] somehow he got something on the inside
[1:56:23] that he take responsibility
[1:56:28] for all the other Ducks y'all follow me
[1:56:30] I'm following God y'all follow me
[1:56:35] take off going to Louisiana to get the
[1:56:37] people to get the other ducks to safety
[1:56:40] God gave him something
[1:56:42] it was put in them at Birth
[1:56:45] he didn't go to school to get this it
[1:56:48] was he was blessed with it at Birth
[1:56:50] and the other Ducks was able to
[1:56:52] recognize it and their lives were spared
[1:56:54] because they could follow the leader
[1:56:59] amen
[1:57:00] I'm going on
[1:57:03] the trouble of it is
[1:57:08] is with man
[1:57:10] he don't know his leader
[1:57:13] yes sir they rally around a denomination
[1:57:17] they rally around a bishop or a man but
[1:57:21] they won't rally around the leader the
[1:57:24] Holy Spirit and the word right see they
[1:57:27] say oh well I'm afraid I'll get a little
[1:57:30] fanatical I'm afraid I'll get uh off on
[1:57:32] the wrong foot oh there there you are
[1:57:35] what if the little duck said now I just
[1:57:37] don't like the way he keeps his feathers
[1:57:39] I don't believe I'll follow him he'll
[1:57:41] freeze to death
[1:57:43] you'll be caught up there if you don't
[1:57:45] take with the flight as it goes it
[1:57:47] unites itself together and nature does
[1:57:50] that geese unite themselves together
[1:57:52] rallies themselves around their leader
[1:57:54] they do the same thing I'll tell you
[1:57:56] about that other that other uh uh uh
[1:57:59] um duck that thought he was a lead and
[1:58:01] he took off there I'ma lead some people
[1:58:02] too he got somebody to follow him he
[1:58:04] took off going all the way over the
[1:58:06] Atlantic Ocean
[1:58:07] and they want to have Ducks get to uh to
[1:58:10] get over to Europe some kind of way how
[1:58:12] did this duck get here and by the time
[1:58:14] he got there most of the ducks that came
[1:58:15] with him did not make the trip
[1:58:17] they died on the way there they were not
[1:58:19] supposed to go across to Europe they
[1:58:21] were supposed to go down to Louisiana
[1:58:24] but they didn't know no better
[1:58:26] they just following
[1:58:28] and don't know what they following
[1:58:31] you better know that there's something
[1:58:33] in that duck voice
[1:58:36] it got to be something in the hunk
[1:58:38] honk honk you got to know it hey that's
[1:58:41] oh okay that that sound right
[1:58:47] hey
[1:58:49] you better be careful with that one
[1:58:51] I don't know where you got that one from
[1:58:55] you want a good honk huh
[1:59:07] come on somebody
[1:59:09] God is revealed in nature
[1:59:12] [Applause]
[1:59:14] if you just watch how God do things in
[1:59:17] nature follow that pattern
[1:59:19] then you'll be on the right track to God
[1:59:25] let me bring it home right here
[1:59:31] did you ever notice
[1:59:34] bees are swarming
[1:59:38] bees will unite themselves together
[1:59:40] before they swarm
[1:59:42] right around their Queen
[1:59:45] that's right and where she goes
[1:59:48] away they go to
[1:59:51] yes what what do they do they unite
[1:59:53] before the Swarm
[1:59:57] exactly every nature fish
[2:00:01] unite themselves together before the
[2:00:04] Spring Run
[2:00:07] and we are in springtime right now
[2:00:14] my God you can find them
[2:00:16] what we call humpies
[2:00:19] of salmon
[2:00:21] amen look at this now it says herpes of
[2:00:24] salmon when they
[2:00:26] uh when they come up there before that
[2:00:30] run comes in you'll see them by tens of
[2:00:33] thousands out in the sea coming around
[2:00:36] and around salt water but they're
[2:00:40] actually freshwater fish now let's just
[2:00:42] let's let's let's let's let's just talk
[2:00:44] about that for a little bit what
[2:00:47] happened with these salmon is that they
[2:00:49] went downstream
[2:00:55] could have put it this way they backslid
[2:00:58] it
[2:01:00] they went downstream but in order a man
[2:01:04] for them to spawn they got to go back
[2:01:08] Upstream
[2:01:10] Hallelujah somebody amen and and when we
[2:01:14] have gone through situations in our life
[2:01:16] where we backfired away from God Amen we
[2:01:18] go Downstream we go further and further
[2:01:21] down
[2:01:23] but there comes a time maybe Springtime
[2:01:25] that God begins to do something in the
[2:01:28] life and and causes them to kind of get
[2:01:30] together
[2:01:32] and they don't know why but they they
[2:01:33] know that that they have to go back
[2:01:35] Upstream now when you're going Upstream
[2:01:37] you fight the current
[2:01:40] hello somebody did you fight against
[2:01:42] amen criticism
[2:01:44] you fight against your pride
[2:01:46] you you fight against say man your
[2:01:49] thoughts and your ideas you fight
[2:01:51] against the things that you said in the
[2:01:53] past
[2:01:53] you fight against the things that you
[2:01:56] did you fight everything
[2:01:58] but I got good news and I got an
[2:02:00] encouragement for it you fight on
[2:02:03] do you just fight off
[2:02:06] if they're swimming Upstream just fight
[2:02:08] on and keep your sword in your hand and
[2:02:12] you fight on
[2:02:14] [Music]
[2:02:16] but but the salmon has to go back
[2:02:18] Upstream
[2:02:21] and as he's as he's as he's swimming
[2:02:23] amen it's not only he's fighting his own
[2:02:25] thoughts and fighting his ideas he gotta
[2:02:27] fight bears
[2:02:29] It's gotta fight Eagles
[2:02:31] it's got to fight everything coming to
[2:02:33] try to take them amen off the journey
[2:02:35] that that that that salmon got one thing
[2:02:38] in mind I gotta get back to the place of
[2:02:40] my birth
[2:02:42] you see I was born in fresh water but I
[2:02:46] found my way down here in salt water I
[2:02:48] gotta get back to the fresh water
[2:02:52] just like the heart gotta get to the
[2:02:54] water amen now we see the settlement
[2:02:57] gotta get back to the fresh water
[2:03:02] it's going for a purpose
[2:03:05] they fight through everything to get
[2:03:07] back to home
[2:03:08] where they come from that and now you
[2:03:10] got you got some salmon that they find
[2:03:12] themselves in situations where they they
[2:03:15] don't know how they did it but they end
[2:03:17] up in what they call landlocked Rivers
[2:03:21] we got us a place where they can't get
[2:03:23] reconnected back to the mainstream
[2:03:26] and see you never want to be in
[2:03:27] something like that if you somehow can
[2:03:29] still get reconnected to the Rain
[2:03:31] mainstream you in a good place
[2:03:35] but the salmon is amen is is now during
[2:03:38] Springtime is ready to try to go back
[2:03:40] home and there's a purpose for going
[2:03:42] back home they fight through everything
[2:03:44] and get back home because when they get
[2:03:46] there oh good God almighty they're going
[2:03:49] there for two things they're going to
[2:03:51] give birth and they're going to die
[2:03:55] can I tell you something you gotta you
[2:03:57] got to be willing to die to yourself
[2:03:58] when you get back home
[2:04:00] but you also want to be born again
[2:04:07] they go there and they get they make it
[2:04:09] through the bear they make it through
[2:04:11] the Eagles and they make it through the
[2:04:13] streams and all the wild going Upstream
[2:04:15] against against the current they're
[2:04:17] going against everything in order to get
[2:04:19] there jumping everything to get there
[2:04:21] sometimes you see them on little videos
[2:04:22] and and the bear just standing waiting
[2:04:25] you got to pass this way in the
[2:04:27] advantages oh thank you Lord hey I ain't
[2:04:31] I ain't even got to go fishing I ain't
[2:04:33] got to get in the water ain't got to do
[2:04:35] nothing that beer just reached down and
[2:04:37] grabbed one and just I mean it's just
[2:04:39] like a smorgasbord for the bear
[2:04:43] but some salmon make it through that
[2:04:45] process
[2:04:47] when they get back they finally get back
[2:04:49] to them fresh waters I'm back at where I
[2:04:51] was born
[2:04:54] to get there and say okay now it's time
[2:04:56] to give birth and and when they give
[2:04:58] birth the you know the the the mother
[2:05:01] salmon is now about to die after she
[2:05:03] gives birth to her her her baby sound
[2:05:06] but here's the thing Mama want to make
[2:05:08] sure that her children are raised in the
[2:05:10] same environment
[2:05:12] hello yeah
[2:05:14] Mama want to make sure her children are
[2:05:17] raised in the same environment that she
[2:05:18] was raised in
[2:05:19] so somehow mama if Mama's running Buck
[2:05:22] while even right now
[2:05:25] God is hidden in nature
[2:05:28] you'll see Mama just beginning to kind
[2:05:29] of make her way around the church every
[2:05:31] once in a while
[2:05:32] trying to get our kids underneath that
[2:05:34] influence
[2:05:35] she ain't ready to surrender her whole
[2:05:37] life but she trying to get her kids
[2:05:39] around that influence it's just
[2:05:41] something inside of you that make you
[2:05:43] have to go back home to the fresh water
[2:05:52] the same way God put it in a salmon
[2:05:55] God put it inside of you
[2:05:59] and no matter where you go you can't get
[2:06:00] away from this I tell you when you leave
[2:06:03] this you leave with a tow package
[2:06:06] but his word just hooked on to you and
[2:06:09] everywhere you go you're gonna remember
[2:06:10] everything I said
[2:06:14] be like I ain't even listening I ain't
[2:06:16] even stream no Services the service is
[2:06:18] in you
[2:06:21] you can run but you can't hide
[2:06:25] so you might as well just surrender to
[2:06:28] God
[2:06:33] oh my God he like the worm attach
[2:06:36] yourself to a tree and just die
[2:06:38] die to yourself die of your thoughts
[2:06:41] daddy ideas God I want you to live
[2:06:42] inside of me
[2:06:44] blessed be the name of the Lord that
[2:06:45] that that's that salmon is going there
[2:06:47] to die give birth to us it's Offspring
[2:06:50] them offspring's gonna be raised in that
[2:06:54] same fresh water
[2:06:56] because you know when they raise the
[2:06:58] environment I think they said take them
[2:06:59] a few years they raise that environment
[2:07:00] in that fresh water and then after a few
[2:07:02] years somehow they make themselves out
[2:07:04] and they start going Downstream
[2:07:07] but it's so minimum God put it in the
[2:07:10] silent God put it in a salmon
[2:07:13] and I mean and I'm gonna tell you I I
[2:07:15] was there in Alaska I mean these salmon
[2:07:18] got to come through all kind of things I
[2:07:20] was in Alaska if me and brother Quentin
[2:07:21] there they take us out to the Fish Camps
[2:07:23] everybody got Nets
[2:07:26] to try to catch these salmon as they're
[2:07:28] coming through I mean the whole village
[2:07:30] everybody got their own little spot on
[2:07:32] the river and they got a net just
[2:07:34] crossing the whole river
[2:07:35] and they go out there every day checking
[2:07:37] them that's just pulling salmon out easy
[2:07:40] easy fishing because they know they're
[2:07:43] coming that direction
[2:07:45] but I'll tell you what some salmon don't
[2:07:46] get caught by Nets
[2:07:49] some salmon don't get caught by bear
[2:07:53] some salmon don't get caught by Eagles
[2:07:56] some salmon don't get caught by nothing
[2:07:58] they have to adapt to press through a
[2:07:59] lot to go back Upstream but it's
[2:08:01] something that God put in them that
[2:08:04] makes them want to go Upstream
[2:08:07] sound like the prodigal son to me
[2:08:10] I'm tired of living the way I'm living
[2:08:12] out here
[2:08:13] I'm gonna go back to my father's house
[2:08:16] because even the servants in My Father's
[2:08:19] House live better than the way I live
[2:08:20] out here
[2:08:22] what caused that boy to think like that
[2:08:25] it was an environment that he was in
[2:08:29] the environment that the parents created
[2:08:31] before he left he knew it was better to
[2:08:34] go back there
[2:08:36] even the servants live better than I'm
[2:08:38] living out here
[2:08:40] I'll tell Dad I'll just be a servant I
[2:08:42] ain't got I know how to mess up your
[2:08:43] name but I'll just be a servant
[2:08:46] Daddy coming the boy come back home and
[2:08:48] dad is so excited to see him kill the
[2:08:49] fatted calf gave him a ring of gold put
[2:08:51] him on a robe and say son look I I can
[2:08:54] always hire servants
[2:08:55] I can hire them
[2:08:57] and I can find him
[2:09:00] but son because my blood
[2:09:03] [Applause]
[2:09:06] because my blood
[2:09:09] is flowing through your veins
[2:09:11] you can never be a servant
[2:09:14] even if you tried to be a servant they
[2:09:16] couldn't let you be a servant they'll
[2:09:18] still treat you different because they
[2:09:20] see the blood
[2:09:22] [Music]
[2:09:25] and since my blood is flowing through
[2:09:28] You'll Always Be Sung even though you
[2:09:31] messed up
[2:09:32] you still sign
[2:09:34] even though you don't fail you still
[2:09:37] daughter nothing could change your
[2:09:40] status or your position
[2:09:42] [Music]
[2:09:43] all I encourage you to just be like a
[2:09:46] salmon get back to the fresh water be
[2:09:48] like a heart get down there to where the
[2:09:50] water's flowing and get just get a drink
[2:09:52] and Shake That devil off
[2:09:56] be like the worm and attach itself to a
[2:09:59] tree and be willing to die
[2:10:03] as you give birth to a New Life
[2:10:06] God is in nature
[2:10:10] let me just finish reading these
[2:10:13] quotes and then I'll be done for the day
[2:10:18] every nature fish uniting themselves
[2:10:20] together for the spring run out in the
[2:10:22] ocean you can find them big what we call
[2:10:24] humpies of salmon when they come up
[2:10:27] there before that run comes you'll see
[2:10:30] them by the tens of thousands out in in
[2:10:32] the sea coming around and around salt
[2:10:35] water but they're actually freshwater
[2:10:37] fish
[2:10:38] and here they come right up at the uh up
[2:10:41] that fresh water to go up for spawning
[2:10:43] season they go up there to spawn about
[2:10:46] every four years and die as soon as they
[2:10:48] spawn and and they know they're going
[2:10:51] there to die you know you coming back to
[2:10:53] church to die you know it except the
[2:10:57] corn a week on the ground and die and
[2:11:00] rot in a bottle alone but if you're
[2:11:03] willing to do it it'll bring forth much
[2:11:05] fruit
[2:11:06] you know you're coming back to die
[2:11:12] amen every four years and die as soon as
[2:11:14] they spawn and they know they're going
[2:11:16] there to die and you can stop them with
[2:11:18] nothing they'll jump fish ladders and
[2:11:21] everything else getting up there knowing
[2:11:24] they're going to their death but the law
[2:11:26] of nature makes them knowing that they
[2:11:28] go up there and spawn in the old and die
[2:11:30] and the young ones come on and something
[2:11:33] unites them together then and out into
[2:11:35] the ocean they go it's uniting it's a
[2:11:38] law you just can't beat God's law
[2:11:45] one last quote out of perfect strength
[2:11:46] by Perfect weakness God
[2:11:50] is
[2:11:52] in nature
[2:11:53] this last statement brother Brandon says
[2:11:55] here's something to console us
[2:11:57] he says
[2:11:59] here's something that encourages I think
[2:12:01] I actually forgot to uh write this one
[2:12:03] down sis so just uh put in here is
[2:12:06] something that encourages here is
[2:12:08] something that encourages and I'm
[2:12:10] reading from the sermon perfect strength
[2:12:12] by Perfect weakness and then here's
[2:12:15] something that encourages says here's
[2:12:16] something to console us
[2:12:19] here is something that encourages
[2:12:22] out of weakness and humility God chooses
[2:12:26] the people to build his kingdom out of
[2:12:29] out of weakness and humility God chooses
[2:12:33] his people to build his kingdom out of
[2:12:36] if we ever get to heaven look at this if
[2:12:40] we ever stand in the presence of God
[2:12:42] with his church
[2:12:43] will stand in a bunch of people that's
[2:12:47] been weak and rejected and cast out by
[2:12:50] the world and know it nothings we're not
[2:12:53] know it alls we're knowing nothings
[2:12:57] isn't it strange that God likened us
[2:13:01] a sheep is the most helpless thing there
[2:13:03] is there's nothing so insufficient of
[2:13:06] Defense than the Sheep a rabbit can run
[2:13:09] a squirrel a man a squirrel can get in a
[2:13:12] tree a dog can bite a lion can tear a
[2:13:15] horse can kick a bird can fly but a
[2:13:18] sheep stands helpless
[2:13:21] and that's the way God wants us
[2:13:24] realize that we're totally insufficient
[2:13:27] then God takes that person and begins to
[2:13:30] mold himself into that person's seed
[2:13:32] then God is in his man see now God takes
[2:13:34] that person begins to mold himself into
[2:13:36] that person makes his hands to do what
[2:13:38] God would have his hands to do make his
[2:13:40] lips speak what God's lips would speak
[2:13:43] because they're not his they're Gods he
[2:13:46] begins to build a character begins to
[2:13:49] take this weakness to make it to make
[2:13:52] his own self
[2:13:53] God is in his people God Likens us the
[2:13:57] Sheep amen we uh uh uh there's there's
[2:14:00] so many different animals we can just go
[2:14:02] through and how God has just designed
[2:14:05] certain characteristics of those animals
[2:14:06] and we can see that
[2:14:08] that that that that ego my god with
[2:14:10] seven foot wingspan over here and seven
[2:14:12] foot over there 14 feet all together fly
[2:14:15] higher than any other bird we see
[2:14:17] ourselves there amen God God made him
[2:14:20] that way for a reason he flies alone and
[2:14:23] and and I've tried to encourage other
[2:14:25] young people because you know sometimes
[2:14:27] you see one drop off another one drop
[2:14:29] off another drop off you got to realize
[2:14:31] you're an eagle
[2:14:33] Eagles don't drop off they fly long
[2:14:39] they fly without encouragement
[2:14:42] they're just the way they fly they have
[2:14:44] to they by their self
[2:14:45] my God my God but you got to be willing
[2:14:48] to just see yourself in that and then
[2:14:50] start operating like that amen
[2:14:52] hallelujah when we were young people
[2:14:54] coming up people told us things like
[2:14:56] that and that stuck with us now you tell
[2:14:58] that the young people they just don't
[2:14:59] get it
[2:15:01] Hallelujah sometimes you're gonna have
[2:15:02] to walk this this Walk Alone
[2:15:06] yeah family ain't gonna be there with
[2:15:08] you friends ain't gonna be there with
[2:15:10] you but God he promised never to leave
[2:15:12] you nor forsake you
[2:15:16] walk on Fight On
[2:15:18] whatever you got to do keep your sword
[2:15:20] in your hand
[2:15:22] keep fighting
[2:15:23] God bless you Church
[2:15:25] amen
[2:15:27] [Applause]
[2:15:33] God is in his man and uh like I told you
[2:15:37] we had to build up to that part but uh I
[2:15:40] trust that this would be enough to hold
[2:15:42] us over till we get back
[2:15:44] hey man let's have a word of Prayer
[2:15:47] father
[2:15:49] we are grateful for the word

[2:16:06] display
[2:16:07] and how you type yourself in so many
[2:16:09] things to try to show people how real
[2:16:12] you are the Infidel went to the
[2:16:15] Wilderness and in the wilderness as he
[2:16:16] just looked at a rock
[2:16:18] how did that rock get there look at that
[2:16:21] what what could do that he knew that
[2:16:24] only God could do it he began to Bow
[2:16:25] right there and sometimes you bring us
[2:16:27] into places where we realize it has only
[2:16:29] been you

[2:16:34] surrender to that

[2:17:35] forgetfulness once we confess it so Lord
