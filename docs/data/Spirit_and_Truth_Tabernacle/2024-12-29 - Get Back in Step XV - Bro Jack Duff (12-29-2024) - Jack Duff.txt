minutes amen just to um uh thank the Lord for his traveling mercies [Music] amen um we um we were you all knew that I was headed over to the Philippines and and um on my way leaving I made a a big mistake stake um I had purchased my uh my ticket to the Philippines um a little early and um and I had arranged we were leaving on Thursday to get there cuz it's like a long uh 20s something hour flight you lose a day going and things like that and so I said we'll we'll leave on Thursday but we bought the tickets to go from New York to uh Manila and uh and then me and brother Larry and brother Diggs and my son-in-law brother Aaron we all would meet in New York on Thursday the 19th and uh so we bought that got that out of the way a little early and uh so with us meeting in New York you know we had to arrange for our own uh tickets to get there to New York and and I went and got my ticket for New York but I booked that ticket for the 20th to arrive in New York I had made a mistake and didn't even realize I made a mistake State and uh on the morning of I got this text by 8:00 in the morning brother Larry said brother I'm in New York where y'all at I said brother you're supposed to be in New York tomorrow what you you're day you're a day ahead and uh they said no brother Jack we'll leave you on the 19th I said Lord I done messed up so uh I called my wife and told her what was going on and and immediately she canceled all her plans and and she helped me uh find a ticket to get to New York and uh I had to get a different flight um to get me to the Philippines and you know at one point in time I thought about well maybe this ain't the will of the Lord I'm just not going and uh I text a pastor over there and told him what was going on and and he say brother Jack um uh just be calm God getting ready to do something and uh I say okay brother you know so uh we were looking for all kind of things you know to try to get out I was was going to try to go to the West Coast and fly from the West Coast out but I just couldn't find any flights and and the Lord just opened up a flight I happen to call a airline and they said we got we got a seat available for you to fly out tonight if you can get to New York by by 10:30 tonight I say I can get to New York by 10:30 tonight so the Lord just opened up the door and made a way for us to to get there amen and we're just very grateful um some of the reports that came back there was um uh um they had I want to say about 20 people that said uh they wanted to um they wanted to give their lives to the Lord and they wanted to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord Hall amen and and one of those people was a a young lady that had been born in the message uh in a message church for 39 years and it finally come to a a place where she wanted to make a decision for Christ and uh so I said well my you know if it's if it's just for one Soul uh then the trip was worth it all you know the trip was actually worth it all we thank God Amen and and we got reports uh one of the pastors sent me a text on yesterday and he was saying usually we had I think I think they had about 25 churches represented uh in in the services 25 pastors brought their churches together and um and as they were it says when they um they usually get together and they talk after the services just to see is you know anybody got any complaints about anything any questions about the ministers preaching anything and uh they said it really is almost like the first time um or one of the only times where there was no questions that everybody was very excited about what God had done and they felt the Revival had struck they their country amen amen amen so you know we were um uh we were just grateful you know that the Lord could use us Amen in a way and and I was just telling the pastor I said you know um meetings over Christmas is a very difficult time for us uh uh Christmas is family time amen here in the states and um and um so it's not easy for me to take a meeting you know at Christmas but uh but you know this time you know we we did it by by the grace of God and and and um I know that the Lord was pleased with some of the results that came forth from it but uh but you know I just my my prayer is that uh if I can't go that I can recommend others that can go and uh and one of these days uh my my desires to be able to send brothers from this church amen out there into the fields uh so uh you know the Lord could use them you know and uh but but we were just so grateful uh my my son-in-law was not scheduled to preach at all but when he got there um you know my the pastor asked me and says do you think um you think uh your son-in-law can handle one of the services I said yes he can handle one of them he certainly can and uh um and and and Aaron uh being that he's you know he speaks multiple languages it's easy for him to learn languages so he learned some of the the words of the brothers and sisters from you know Philippines and they got up there speaking their words to them and I'm like now Aaron you done stole these people heart brother you know and uh so but it just put him right you know right there uh on the same level and it just made it so much easier for him to minister and they received his ministry uh in a in a very special way and we're grateful you know just for the the opportunities I love um the scripture being manifested in people's life you don't have to call ahead to let them know you coming you ain't got to call ahead and say I got something in my heart to share with the people you don't do things like that because you break the scripture I'm just talking right now but the scripture says that um man's gift will make room for itself and and and when you ain't done nothing you just let God do it then God can get all the glory praise God amen amen so you know I was I was just happy to to see him experience that uh there and and certainly brother Diggs just did the things that brother Diggs does and uh you know and it just it was a real blessing uh to the people they had heard of his ministry for years and uh like both he and I we had been invited to the Philippines you know number of times but just never really felt the leading to go but this was the time uh after we met last year we met the pastor in in uh in um Australia and uh so this was the year that we felt that okay this is this is a time for us to go the only thing they say they was missing was brother Solomon amen they were asking for him where's brother Solomon where's brother Solomon so when we go back we got to take brother Solomon with us amen uh there to the Philippines and uh but I tell you what brother Larry did a good job substituting for brother Solomon yeah and you know we had taught them because we were trying to get some some songs together and we had taught them brought me through this brought me through that and at the end of the last service the musicians was sitting over there on the keyboard like they're like can we do that brought me through this can we do that can we I'm like man Services is over man we're just going to have to let that one go you know but but I know that they' be happy for us to come back and do that with them they were they were just so just so so blessed by you know uh brother brother L's gift and and they received them you know uh so well I I I was I mean I was just and when when when you start a song you begin to sing it they don't know it but they soon as they put them words up on the screen the people start reading the words and I mean everybody in the congregation got their voice lifted everybody got their voice lifted and and I'm I'm like it you just it's just something you know um I mean just 25 churches even coming together in unity like that that's that's a real blessing and you know they they had there are so many Believers in the Philippines that they actually had three meetings going at the same time uh in different different areas uh like four or five hours away but one meeting would have a thousand another meeting have a thousand another meeting have a couple about 800 I mean Believers everywhere all over the Philippines and hard to bring them all together in one place so they have to do the meetings like that I believe brother Brian I do was there preaching at one of the meetings and then me and you know brother Diggs at one meeting and I'm not sure who was preaching at the other meetings but they they was just preaching going all over the Philippines so uh a wonderful wonderful amen um time you know that we had there so we thank the lord we we truly thank the Lord and sometimes you go you get to you get there and um and then you get to a spot like well I I can't wait to get back home because there is no place like home no place like home and as I was there I was there about 12 hours ahead or something like that 12 or 13 hours ahead so uh they're already into uh the next day you know just about going into the next day so uh I uh I had an opportunity after our services were finished there last Sunday morning um I had a chance to hear and watch you know stream uh what was going on here and I was just absolutely blessed amen I was Absol Ely blessed praise the Lord uh brother brother Troy just did a wonderful job amen with the thought that the lord gave him and and and and we going to get out this mall I'm telling y'all we we're going to get out this mall the Holy Ghost is leading us out the mall we not getting trapped by food court and some of the other stores we coming up out of this Hallelujah but I tell you I just appreciate how the Lord Ed Amen brother Troy on last last week amen amen amen so thank the Lord uh it's good to see brother Mark again I know he came last week but um um uh brother Mark's father is brother Mark and um uh but and I when when I found that I say so Mark you're a junior he said no no no I ain't want him to be a junior but uh I wanted to give him my name I said well you know what my daddy did me the exact same way that you did brother Mark I'm not a junior but I carry my father's first name amen I didn't like it growing up I didn't like it but it is what it is amen we thank God for all things all right musicians thank y'all so much I appreciate y'all amen I didn't even realize my daughter not even there she H traveling uh but she'll be back home soon amen uh they told me that uh there was a um a airplane crash in South Korea uh 181 people on the plane and 179 lost their lives and um you know certainly those families uh we want to give our prayers to them but uh I I am thankful that with all the traveling that we did uh the different flights that we caught um that God kept us on on every one of them and and and one of the things that I like to do as I'm as I'm getting on the plane um I always uh lay hands on the door of the plane as I'm walking on and and and I was so messed up on that Thursday I forgot to lay hands on one of them do as I was going on the plane I said Lord will you just protect us but as I'm as I'm walking on I'll just reach over and touch the D and then just keep on walking praise God that's all you got to do now you you ain't got to stop it in the name of Jesus take your oil light where's the pilot at you don't have to do all that just touch it and just go sit down amen the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and deliver them from all their troubles amen God is good God is good well um I will read a scripture and um we have the Lord has uh um uh given us a journey this year amen and and the inspiration everywhere uh I have gone I've taken this inspiration with me and um and it has been a blessing you know to the churches uh and as I mentioned to you all I I am not finished with the thought and so being that I'm not finished with the thought it is a a carryover amen into the new year and uh uh and and I'll talk a little bit more about that on Tuesday night uh but today um we want to we want to we want to uh get into this subject but I'll I'll just mention that I what however the Lord going to take it it may be more of a teaching but it's okay because uh I think it gives us the uh uh teaching stabilizes and solidifies the church for the young people that may not clearly understand what this message is all about and and when we we we use the term the message you you can't necessarily find that term in the scripture uh now there is is one verse in in in in um I think might might be the John's or something like that this is the message right you'll find something like that but we use that term and you and you won't find that term just like you won't find the term pentacostal church Baptist Church Catholic church Lutheran Church you won't find those terms in the scripture right but uh but what we want to do is find where we fit in the scripture let me read the scripture before I get to talking too much and I'll ask y'all to stand with me I'll just read two verses and then I'll let you I'll pray and let you be seated and we'll just talk a little bit and then we'll let the Lord have his way amen uh I'm going to go to um uh Joel uh chapter one praise God Amen and and um verse four says that which the palmerworm hath left hath the Locust eaten that which the Locust has left hath the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm have left hath the caterpillar eaten and again back over to chapter two um and uh I'll just read verse 25 just to make the reading short uh says and I'll restore to you the years that the Locust have eaten the canker worm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you uh let's pray father we thank you for the word of the Lord thank you for the ability to read the scripture but um when the Holy Ghost helps us to see what the scripture means father it is even better so father we trust that you would just open our understanding every ear uh that is here may they hear what the spirit has to say and Lord may you just get the glory and the honor out of our gathering and I trust Lord Jesus that um this journey that you have us on that father you would just begin to uh even make it more and more clear to us as to how we fit within this portion of the scripture it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated uh our uh title again is get back and step this is the journey that we have been on uh throughout the this year and um um I was just kind of thinking you know there was a time in brother brandom's Ministry where um a a a lady had come uh to get prayer for a child of hers that was Ill and um you know brother brandom certainly prayed for but he told the lady he had a vision uh and he told the lady he says you know um there is a a country doctor and this doctor is going to be in a certain place uh at a certain time and um and and and uh you're going to see this man is's going to have on this color suit and you know this this type of tie he's is going to be dressed a certain way and you're going to see this man and you're going to talk to him he says and that's going to be the man that can actually help help you your son uh and say when you kind of come in contact with him you're not going to really believe uh what what you're experiencing at the time so you know he goes through the the lady goes through the prayer line she hears this prophecy that's that's given to her and uh days go by and uh be because of sometimes the amount of time that goes by it's hard for us to believe certain things are happening in our life hello and and what we find amen is that we could be in a vision let me put it this way we could be in the manifestation of a vision and not even realize it this woman begin to walk the streets amen of the city and as she's walking the streets of the city she runs into a man and uh and the man begin to ask her questions about her son and and as as as he's asking questions about the son uh not telling her who he is but just asking questions he had a concern he was a real doctor right he had a concern because the doctors nowadays all they want to do is just give you some pills and the pills never deal anything with your condition it actually make you more ill right but this was a real doctor he saw somebody sick and like start asking questions and and a lady was responding to the questions but the way she was responding as if like you know I'mma answer your questions but I really want you to stop talking to me right and her attitude was a little different but but before you knew it she looked wait a minute the tie the suit had brother brandom not given those specific details it would have been hard for the woman to recognize that she was actually in the vision sometimes you need to pay attention to the details glory to God because when you catch it by the details then you know where you are and a and scripturally we have to know where we are we have to pay attention to the details we're not just going through this mall of life amen that there is an objective here amen we're not here to get stuck inside the mall of life amen we come from God and we're going back to God hallelujah amen we got to get out of here and our exit is a Rapture so we must pay attention to the details had brother Troy paid attention to the details come on somebody he would have known how to get out of the mall that's why his wife said you didn't know what entrance you came in did you see the store that you entered do you know which floor you came in on I mean the de The Details Matter come on somebody so so spiritually I'm I'm trying to help the church pay attention to the details yes amen we have some things that we're working with here and um and and and and in this you know let me let me let me set this up I I I read this quote uh the last time I preached out of exposition of the church ages I'll read it again and uh and and and I I know that uh you all going to be just like for the whole year you've been hearing the same scripture preach over and over again I done walked out here for most of my sermons probably 80% 85% of the sermons that I preach here have been out of Joel 1 and Joel 2 now you might say well brother Jack when you're going to get off to as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be and and and and now Noah had the same message for 120 years and you can imagine how the church got tired of what what they were hearing amen but by them by them by them failing to hear what Noah was preaching they fa to to to to get out the mall let's put it that way amen let me read this exposition of seven Church ages bear with me uh in resume of the ages the prophet says this but what about the true seed it says uh it will happen just as as we said the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age I I I I I'm I'm just bear with me this is so important to me um you know I I was sharing with the the brothers um they when when when the when the younger ministers are coming up it's very important for me to not not I don't want everybody to be like me as far as your delivery of the of the me of the word everybody got their own style they all God makes them a certain way so deliver the way that God has giv you to deliver it right but the the key is deliver the message yes sir amen give us the message don't give us your feelings don't give us just your thoughts right and don't give us just you know just what you might have got off a YouTube video we can tell that ain't the message we listen to the message we read the message we am man we we hear what the prophet say so give us the message that I mean the only way we going to be made ready for a Rapture is by what we get from the word of truth that is given to us by the messenger for this age so when God give you a thought make sure you trace your thought through the message amen amen one time we had a meeting here amen and and I had some young Brothers preaching and um so you know before they all preach and I knew that they were struggling with the message a little bit but I I let them have the meeting and and and and yet to understand when when I'm being a message Pastor I'm letting you have my pull pit I'm giving you my pull pit i i i i and and look I'm not I'm first trying to De help you develop your gift right I'm giving you a place to cultivate your gift but don't take advantage of the pull pit oh y'all y'all bear with me right but but but but but you know I I said so before the brothers got up there I said Brothers what give me send me the quotes that you getting your inspiration from for the sermon that you're get ready to preach and they just delayed They delayed They delayed that's send me the quotes of where you're getting your inspiration from so so they they they I fin I finally got everybody quotes and and then I noticed that some was going to be very intense about not quoting brother brandom and I knew that I knew they were going to do it so so I had to quote already so when they went up there intentionally not quoting brother brandom I came up behind him I saying the inspiration where this brother get his sermon from is right here pull up this quote praise the Lord pull up this quote and I read the quote this where he got his inspiration from Glory we can shout amen on that right next one come up and and and don't re know well this is where he get his inspiration from the third one knew not to come up and not read no quotes So they had all their quotes ready you preaching in a message Church yes sir and message people want to hear message things hello somebody and you go to the Pentecostal Church they want you to talk about speaking in tongues they they want you to talk about an experience that that's a Pentecostal Church Hallelujah they want to hear things about Deliverance that that's that's what they feed on but here we we feed on the word as it was brought forth from the messenger right let me keep reading amen the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messeng uh to this age in her will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning and I love the way this this this this is this is worded how do we get back how do we get back to where we were at the beginning it's the spirit bringing us back and and so if if it's promised that the spirit is going to bring us back you all ought to be in expectation that the spirit will flow in this place we experienced it this year but but that's just a that's just a a foretaste of what God wants to do y'all y'all don't be shocked you come in here amen and week after week you start seeing these things manifested amen hallelujah hallelujah but but he said the spirit will will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning he says that that's that is that's thus say the Lord and and this is what brother tro was trying to get to us on last week when we use the word Pentecost it's a very confusing word it's a very confusing because people look at the Pentecostal organization the Pentecost the church and think that's what we talking about no we talk about what we read in Acts 2 that's the Pentecost of the beginning sir yes sir and and and and remember the Pentecostal Church actually started with acts two but let me finish reading the quote they started there so we're not going back to where they had we're talk about going back to the Bible Acts to watch this he says that is thus sayth the Lord it is thus sayith the Lord for that is what Joel 2: 23- 26 says be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain and and when the Holy when when the Holy Spirit fell on the zeusa street they got moderate rain yes sir they got moderate ring they S I mean and and that was scripture you cannot take that experience from the Pentecostal people God was using that for a purpose yes sir they got moderate ring amen uh but look at this now it says give you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the Flores shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years my God amen amen amen that the Locust have eaten the C a worm and a caterpillar and a Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you oh Jesus this is so powerful it says and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dealt wonders with uh uh dealt wondrously with you and my people should never be ashamed now it says God is going to restore the Lutheran age did not restore the church it started a Reformation the Wesleyan age and this is John Wesley he's talking about did not restore the Pentecostal age did not restore amen but God has to restore for he cannot deny his word this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration God will take the church right back to Pentecost amen amen yes sir this is a promise from God God God will take the church right back to Pentecost of the beginning so if you hear the way the sermons are being preached it is God using the ministry to take the church hallu yes Lord that's why we all underneath this inspiration it this is a promise from God we can help ourselves if we wanted to but God say he take the church back so you got to use the ministry to do that right am oh my my my my my my don't get offended at these things this is you are you are in a vision and you don't realize it the vision of Joel chapter 2 we're living this we're manifesting this right now every day that you've been coming to church for this year you have been inside this Vision Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus oh my God God will take the church right back to Pentecost of the beginning he says now notice in verse 25 it tells why we need restoration why do we need this says the Locust the cankerworm the caterpillar and the Palm worm have eaten all but the root and a small bit of the stem now y'all know that's the truth even in some of our own personal lives we've been attacked by Locust caner worm caterpillar I mean I mean uh I just done ate up everything but there's just a little life left and right where the little life is left sometimes all you got is just a little life just just to get to church on Sunday some of some of us ain't even got that some of us ain't even got strength to get out of our house and come to church on Sunday you get comfortable missing church I mean you you comfortable with that right but but but but even in that condition if there's just a little life there God going to restore that [Music] life watch it watch it watch oh if y'all just looked around sometime I know this I don't want this to go over your head I want you to just kind of see because if you see how the devil's just even working in your own houses your own household look at the the Locust and the and the canker and the caterpillar and palom just eating up everything you got but God promised I'm going to restore can I can I can I put it this way look at how he eat up in your bank account oh y'all ain't with me Locust and ripped my bank bank account apart caterpillar just I mean this done went wrong and that done went wrong I had money for this and I had money for that and and just look like just just just just e it down to nothing I'm looking at pennies and amen I'm a doire maybe you have been being a doire but I want I don't mind being a millionaire they were just telling me about some meetings happening over in Dubai and and the meetings uh they they what what that what the the church did for the meeting they said all the people got to do is get here you pay for your plane ticket to get here we will pay for your hotel we will pay for your transportation we will pay for your food all you got to do is get here now how could that church do that if they were a bunch of doirs come on right but if if if it's me I'm looking at every area of my life in my body I'm looking for Restoration in my bank account I'm looking for Restoration in the church I'm looking for restoration the gifts of the Spirit I'm looking for restoration things that I can't even think about I'm looking for restoration it's m amen hallelujah this is the season for it yes it is hallelujah my my my way with children restoration hallelujah amen husband wife restoration h no matter what it is I'm looking for restoration Lord and let me tell you how restoration come God is the one that does it I don't have to do nothing I'mma let God do it by his Spirit he will bring forth restoration amen I just don't want to say things that will go against what he's doing amen I don't want to do things that's going to go against what God is doing yes sir let's keep let me let me keep going let me keep going all right God would take the church right back to Pentecost of the beginning that's what brother tro was telling us that's where we're going Pentecost of the beginning not not just the denomination even though God used the denomination but we're not stopping there we're going back to the beginning all right watch this now it says now notice in verse 25 it tells why we need restoration the Locust cankerworm caterpillar and palm worm have eaten all but the root and a small bit of the stem now we are told that all these insects are all one and the same in different stages that is right they are the Antichrist Spirit manifested uh in organization denomination and false Doctrine Through the Ages amen and there's so many false doctrines now um let me and I'm going just hit this while we're here when when when when um William Seymour was believing God that the gifts would return to the church they was praying and seeking God and and when God finally manifested on the zeusa street the problem was not just William Seymour but many others began to teach that you know in order for you to have the Holy Ghost you had to speak in tongues and that's not accurate with scripture that's not accurate because um John the Baptist the scripture says was filled with the Holy Ghost in his mother's womb now who heard him speaking tongues in the womb but the Bible said he had the Holy Ghost amen right I mean same I mean you know and and there's different ones that that received the Holy Ghost but they never spoke in tongues and you can't say that that was the evidence of the Holy Ghost so the evidence is actually amen the fruit that is be that is being borne from your life after you have a holy ghost experience what type of life are you living after that because we had a lot of people in Pentecost and they still there y'all know they there they speak in tongues and one in one one uh uh one instance and then after they finish speaking the tongues then they will curse you out and the Bible declared that out of the same mouth you bless and you curse so it had to be something greater than that sir that's part of it but that's not all of it that's right amen all right we going on we going on false doctrines right so so so here he says uh and that poor little root and stalk is going to be restored God isn't going to plant a new church but it's going to bring his original planting back to Original Seed he is he is doing it as stated in verse 23 by the teaching or former rain next will come the Harvest rain or rapturing faith I love it let's keep going thus at the very at this very thus at this very moment we are in the complete fulfillment of Matthew 24:24 in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect now you know you know he say at this moment we're in this I got loved ones out there in denominational churches yielding their talents and their gifts to denominational churches and the scriptures say Amen awake thou that sleep arise from the dead and Christ will give thee light brother brandom say that's people working in denominational system amen but but but they they don't have the full light of the Gospel but yet they're working in the midst of it giving everything they got for it one day the spirit of God is going to cause them to wake up and realize that if it were possible they they would have see the very like they going to see something something going to happen in that church where they going to see something that they no this ain't it I know this ain't it and they going to come back and don't even realize when they coming back it's restoration that's all over sir yes sir oh Hallelujah somebody can I let me just drop this while I'm here I'm I'm I'm going read on when restoration happened you can't hold it against the people that have gone through people that have walked away people that have left you can't hold it against brother Jack what you trying to say I'm trying to say you cannot be like the prodical son's brother so now is a time for you to check yourself cuz I'm telling you restoration is happening am what we didn't see this year we going to see it next year because we we flowing over into that the the inspiration carries over right so so so what you didn't see this year you going to see next year and when it happens you cannot have the spirit of the prodigal son's brother why brother Jack let them get up there and do that he know what they went through and also know they went through restoration so we going to enjoy this now I'm letting you know we going to celebrate and enjoy oh my my my my y'all know how I I mean and and all I'm saying is as people are coming when you see them coming be have a open heart sir have an open heart glory to God sometime we just get so offended we see certain thing like oh why why is this you look just just calm down relax God is trying to restore God is trying God is absolutely trying to restore right in front of your eyes he's trying to restore amen all right let me keep going I I got to get somewhere so it's says it says this in so much that if it were very if if it were possible they should deceive the very L and who is it that shall attempt to deceive the very elect while the spirit of the Antichrist in the false anointed ones of this last day these false ones have already come in Jesus name claim that they have been anointed of God for the last day they are the false messiah's anointed ones right he says they claim that they are prophets can y y'all y'all got the this these are heavy quotes can I can I tell y'all there's people that have left this message I might as well just say it I'mma say it like people left the message because we wouldn't receive them as prophets because they can see a little something let me let me try to bring Clarity we do receive Prophets yes sir yes but you got to understand where your prophetic Ministry is in scripture and here's here's the where we receive it and he gave some Apostles some prophets some pastors some teachers some evangelists that's Ephesians 4 your ministry fit right there the problem is is that because God has giv you the the gift of prophet you think that you on the same level as brother brandham you not on that level and we'll never receive you there I'mma go further there's some that try to make brother brandham son on the same level as brother brandham we won't receive him there God says one prophet amen there's one manifestation of Malachi 45 and 6 Revelation 10 one one anybody else coming trying to be outside of that that that's the spirit that we we going to come against it every time but if you can find yourself in Ephesians 4 and stay there all right hello your gift will work amen all right look at this now they are the false messiah's anointed ones they claim that they are prophets but are they one with the word that's another way to test whether you say you're a prophet you're the word of the Lord come to the prophet right so so are you staying with the word if you ain't staying with the word watch it now that that look you can fool other people out there in denominations go out there and just prophesy prophesy actually proph a lie you can prop a lie you you can tell people that they going to meet somebody and with with a salt and pepper hair and they're going to give you some money and you and and every these prophets always talk about you getting money they always talking about you getting money but every Prophet every every prophecy is not positive when you read the Bible you going to die if you don't get your life right with God yes thus say the Lord boy that that'll make you straighten up but they prophesy you going to have a Ministry one one guy told me that God God going to give me a whole city I I I sat there and I'm in this church and I'm like I don't even know why I'm in here I brought these young people down here I need to get them out of here they done cut the lights down it feel feel like we're in a club I'm like Lord Jesus what is this this what the church done come to Spirits all over the place sir special chair for the pastor to S he come in late with his wife and then and then and then you know he sit there he know I'm there cuz he see the young people and the way that they dressed and the anointing that's on their lives and they singing he can tell us so so he oh who who who who who y'all with yeah that's that's that that's our uncle that's our pastor you know oh oh oh praise the Lord man of God I just feel L to tell you God going to give you a whole city what do I need why would I need a city a city I mean people just say anything that come to their head where in the Bible has God given somebody a city like that outside of the Old Testament where they fighting for cities well why why do I need a city I just want a church and they hit and miss I mean they they they prophesied the brother smile about him being Pastor before he became pastor at at bible truth right they prophesied that and it and it occurred exactly the way they prophesied it believe sister Sharice and was somewhere somebody prophesied to her about being in the dental field well she's in the dent field sometimes it's sometimes it hit sometime it don't I don't want to go to a church where it hit sometime and then other times it don't you don't know what to put your faith in and and and and truth be told if you had a prophet that spoke thus sayth the Lord and it didn't come to pass that Prophet was supposed to die but the Pentecostal Church let everybody prophesy even little babies push everybody speak speak speak speak speak he ain't got nothing to say one of my friends told me a little fell come and lay hands on her the Pentecostal Church laid hands on her and she just went slaying the spirit everybody do that even though they and in in nowadays oh Lord I I I don't watch videos of this of of yeah I ain't gonna call no name this man laying hands on somebody and they didn't go down he get upset with them about them not going down in the spirit like everybody he touch has to go down that's what proves his ministry and he don't prophesy lies but it the latest latest say he prayed for him and I went down the spirit and then he come up after I went down he the little boy stood over and said get up get up in the name of Jesus get up we're playing games with God truth brother God don't God God is not into this nonsense see this is why we need a restoration let me keep reading look at this now they claim that they are prophets but are they one with the word HT never they have added to it or taken from it no one denies that the spirit of God manifesting in gifts is upon them nobody deny that look at this but like bam they all have their programs make their appeal for money come on y'all y'all know the prophet telling the truth trth yes sir now we going to pray for the sick but I got a $20 line I got a $50 line and I got a $100 line now if you really want prayer if you really want that devil cast off of you get in this $100 line now you tell me when God put a a dollar a dollar amount on prayer and we do it every week like it's just normal it's not normal it is a demonic spirit that is inside the church and when we recognize it with our eyes that this is all the word of God then we become part of a restoration process and we get somewhere where the word of God is going forth in power and in demonstration I'm going to tell y'all something I'm going to tell you how powerful the word is the word is so powerful that while I'm preaching you can be [Applause] healed without nobody ever laying hands on you that's how powerful the word is and and and and you know how we lay hands to on people pray for them to get the Holy Ghost well according to the scripture while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them yes amen man just got got to have something to do with it but this is all an act of God it's the work of God but like balum they all have their programs make their appeal for money exercise gifts but here's the problem but deny the word or bypass it for fear that a controversy might diminish their chances for greater gain yet they preach salvation and deliverance through the power of God just like Judas with a Ministry imparted by Christ but because they are wrong seed consequently they have the wrong Spirit motivating them religious oh my they outshine the elect in effort and Zeal but it is L to sin not of Christ watch this one for it looks for big crowds big programs and startling signs amongst them they preach the second coming of Christ but deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger though in power and signs and true Revelation he eclipses them all now you know brother brandom said that you know there's people out there right now now they the congregations don't know it but there's people taking what brother brandom said and going into their churches and preaching because they know his his his uh the revelation God gave him eclipes anything they've ever heard before so they're using Brother bram's sermon a portion of his message they preach preaching to the con congregation but they will not say brother brandom said it actually what you are you're a thief yes sir behind the pull pit you you you it's plagarism you know that you stole that from somebody else and you're using it like you got something fresh from God but you won't give the church the [Music] whole the whole Source you won't give them all that amen right so here brother Bram tells us now they preach the second coming of Christ but deny the Advent or the Aral that's what the Advent the arrival right uh the Advent of the Prophet messenger though in powering signs and true Revelation he eclipses them all ah yes this false spirit that is in the last days is so close to the real can be distinguished only by its deviation from the word and whenever it is caught in being anti- word it falls back on the one argument we've already shown to be false and what's the argument we get results don't we and since we get results we have to be of God but they off the word so you know with that um this Advent of the or the arrival of a notable person arrival of a prophet of the Prophet messenger what I wanted to share uh at this Junction in this restoration because uh this whole uh uh theme in Joel of the palmerworm the korm and the C caterpillar Locust uh eating and stealing away with God restoring the this scripture actually uh is manifested through uh the history of the the Gentile church and it started in the day the the restor ation started in the days of Luther brother tro was sharing that with us last week when he nailed the 95 thesis to the Catholic Church door a Reformation started but that was part of the restoration process but but Luther could only care so far he had the judge to live by faith and justification we we thank God for that but then it had to go to sanctification which is the message of John Wesley which John Wesley actually uh his teachings would be found in the Methodist Church the Lutheran Church the Methodist Church Hallelujah right so John John Wesley didn't start the Methodist Church now Luther didn't start the Lutheran Church it was the people that came after Luther that started the Lutheran Church it was the people that came after Wesley that started the Methodist Church Hallelujah but but but when God got so tired of the Lutheran he went on to the Methodist and when God got tired of the Methodist he went on to the Pentecostals that was started with with this ausa Street Revival praise God the all this was part of the restoration but notice amen there's there there's four stages to the restoration we had first Luther we had second Wesley we had third the Pentecostals which all three of them went into organization and whenever it goes into organization God leaves it and they just keep going on like they going to get their Old Glory back let me tell you the lutherans will never get their Old Glory back the wesling will never get their Old Glory back the Methodist because the Methodist was just as holy as everybody else right the Methodist never get their Old Glory God has left it and the Pentecostals would never get their Old Glory by let me tell you what it is it's kabot sir the glory of the Lord has departed sir if you're looking for Glory better go find it because there's a fourth stage to this restoration and that is where this message comes into play this message that we're following so so so so in order to follow this message we got to see things according to scripture the Advent of the Prophet messenger the coming of the Prophet Messenger right uh the arrival of a notable person and and brother Bram has come and gone but yet we identify that that that God used this ministry for a very specific purpose now let's read it in scripture we're not following a message just to follow a message the reason let me tell y'all the reason I follow it it's because I can see it in the Bible yes sir amen amen I remember when people tried to promote the prophet's son as a new messenger I sat down and I say show that to me in the Bible I said you don't have to talk about brother brandham I see that part I know what scriptures pertain to brother brandham you ain't got to talk but show me about this next this next messenger you got show me where that come because all I see in the Bible is only seven Messengers that's all I read maybe I miscounted something show me in the word and don't be trying to give me no types don't give me that straight out the Bible and and and and la la last last time I preached you know I I I took you all to uh Malachi 4 that was the very first scripture that I that I shared I'm going to show you I think I got 11 or 12 scriptures and and actually uh with with with uh without without us knowing it hope we can read between the lines I showed you Luther was a part of uh Joel 2 25 our restore Luth was a part part of that Wesley was a part of that so when I say that their Ministries can be identified in Joel 2:25 Luther's Ministry is there Wesley's Ministry is there the Pentecostals Ministry is there brother brandom's Ministry is there so if you're looking for one scripture out the Old Testament Joel 2:25 yes sir yes sir exactly right let's go on a little further I gave you Malachi 45 and6 and then last time I I went through that and showed you where the spirit of Elijah was used five times amen here uh on Earth it was used five times one in um with Elijah himself then with Elisha and then with John the Baptist and then with brother William brandham and then Elijah himself be coming back in in uh uh uh Revelation 11 as one of the two witnesses Elijah and Moses and even though it does not have their names there in the scripture the way that we can tell who who those Witnesses are is that their Ministries are identified in the scripture very simple right their Ministries are identified so so I went through that now let's go on a little further amen and I'm going to give you some more scriptures that point to brother brandom's ministry here in the scripture now the first one before we get there let me let me just read a quote out of anointed ones at the end time and then we will go to Revelation 3 Lord Jesus you know and when I when I be looking at my notes I'll be thinking oh yeah you're going to hit that real fast go right hit hit that one fast hit that one fast you're gonna be this one you're GNA be there and a certain amount of time you you'll be at this point then I get up here everything get delayed but it's needful here this quote out anointed once at the end time it says notice the very day when this messenger when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message right he says see the first pool healing second pool prophesying just put that in second pool prophesying says second pole prophesying he says third pole my God the opening of the word now that that's so important third pull the opening of the word the Mysteries reveal oh my my my my my the third pull is the opening of the word the Mysteries reveal look it says no more there is no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word now what what we mean by that is we got to be able to read in the word that God say he was going to do this and then we see that Prophet come forth and do those things we know God is vindicating his word yes sir okay amen he says uh the but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated by the word and remember the third P was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word do you see it he said it is then in that day when this thing is to take place that Janice and jambre the impersonators will appear again remember I told you people leave the message because we won't receive them as prophets now they ain't telling you that but I know I know you getting around telling people I'm a prophet too God showed me this God and you want us to receive you and and because we don't call your name you get offended we won't call your name in that manner you God did not give you that type of ministry now I'm going to have to just bring your profit level way back down God did not give you that type of ministry right all right if you don't if you're not careful you're going to find yourself right here in this quote this quote says and the day when this thing do take place that Janice and jambre the impersonation ERS will appear again just like they did when Moses appeared with the original word to say uh to say it they appear to impersonate it just exactly right now you see what Matthew 24:24 is see it's anointed ones and this is why we got to be able to kind of rightly divide through that is this an impersonation Spirit or is this the real thing cu the real thing will stay with the word amen and even in Janice and jambre they they come down and Moses come with thus sayith the Lord and he threw that stick down and became a snake boy Janice and J Pharaoh looked at him say oh cheap cheap magician trick come here Janice and jamb and they show up now what was them folks practicing that that that that even Pharaoh knew that that was you ain't did nothing here Moses T you got thus sayith the Lord and here here they come with they they two sticks Janice and jamers two against one Janice throws his down become a snake jambis throws his down and become a snake and Moses had to sit there and look at that now God you done s me down here with this this stick to snake trick and you sure that me I ain't never seen nothing like this but I Lord what what is this but Moses didn't get afraid Moses stood there because he knew had a commission from God and before you know it Moses snake rose up swallowed Jamber snake Moses snake rose up and swallowed uh uh Janice uh snake got both of them and and then he picked up the snake and it turned back to a stick again now where is Janice and Jamber snakes they inside my stick which showed that God was I mean the God that was with MES was greater and and any time got to God got to show himself greater he will I don't care what people come up with God will always demonstrate that he is greater yes sir I let me put it this way God will always one up the devil so we don't have to be afraid of nothing I'm standing right here with this word and we going to watch what God we already seen God do it we know God got more inore so forth so let's just walk in that now Revelation 3:14 let's let's let's let's let's let's let's pick this up because this is a promise uh of um of a ministry that's coming in this day amen this is Brother Brandon's Ministry promised right here in this in this in this in this whole uh uh section amen of Revelation 3 it says and unto the angel of the Church of the lay of the sins the angel happens to be a man this is not a uh uh a Heavenly being this is a man on the earth that God is using Amen to bring a message to the people of leosa now many we say oh that's just to that church in L uh no no no God used that church as an example there were things happening in that church that were represent an entire age sir and we so happen to be living in that age watch some of the things that we read here in scripture let's just read the Bible unto the angel of the Church of the leans right these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou were cold or hot amen so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot this is what God say he going to do cuz you a't you ain't on fire or or or you on C or you just cold as I don't know what we don't want to come to church like that don't come to church cold I rather see the church on fire like I said I rather see we rather have some wild fire than no fire at Allen right but but but but but here because the church is is is is is is is is neither cold nor hot he says I would spew you spew thee out of my mouth I'm going to spit you out of my mouth this is what this is what Jesus is saying about the church right I mean it it it's I mean actually they say I mean it you know you you get a church in this condition just make you sick and the church in its last day is making Jesus sick let me go on a little further because thou sayest now not not God saying this about the church this what the church say about itself because thou sayest I am rich we got more mega churches now than we ever had before I I I hate to call these preachers names but they shouldn't do things to make us call their names Pentecostal preacher at a diddy party you you you you think you do you do you think um williiam seore you think William Seymour would have went to a diddy party and and we allowed him to just keep preaching to us not me I ain't listening to nothing if if that's what your preaching produced that you can go to a ddy party and say that you what you praying for him is that right that's well did he change now says I am rich increase with Goods one one one one one little fellow another Pentecostal preacher last name I think is the planis they got a video of him reading a scripture and when he start reading the scripture he quoting it then he say get it from me and read it lady said well actually that's not what the Bible say the Bible say this and it was a rebuke to him the very scripture he was quoting was a rebuke to him but he claim he he he he he is thanking God for all of his Planes all of his cars and and all these other things I mean they increase with Goods let's let's let's just read it and have need of nothing and let me let me just tell you me standing in inside of a a school room preaching a sermon like this in their Church where where your church at my brother where where you worship at brother oh you got something to say but but miss the scripture because I would turn around and say uh it's not about where my church at it's about where God is and and and and let's just go back since we in the Christmas season where did them Shepherds find Christ where did they find him was he in a nice decorated hospital room was he in a mega church was he in the king's Palace I'm talking about Christ the one that you preaching about where did they find Christ y'all done y'all done put on a big old display here in the church but you're missing the point what is the point God is hidden and then he's revealed in simplicity so the same Christ they found in a Manger right they might they'll find him in a school room today all right I'm rich increase with goods and have need of nothing but now this is what God's testimony is about his church knowest thou not knowest th not that thou are wretched good God now this is what Jesus is saying about his church you wretched people praying and fasting you wretched you miserable man this what God think about his church and poor now they got all this money but they poor really poor in spirit poor and understanding the word of God poor not only that oh my these ANS and and and and and blind now y'all watch these words and naked what are they blind to Blind to being able to see the word see Jesus you know he had to when he walked with the brothers on the road to emus they they was just missing it and they were so downcast and they and their Spirits like man we didn't know that he was going to die like that I mean the man with that kind of power and we done seen him raise a dead we don't see them do all I'm like what I mean oh how could this happen these fellas decided that they were going to leave the faith and they were going to or could I put it this way leave the message of the hour and they were going to go back to their old churches where they they felt more comfortable and on the road back they got a visitation and um when the I mean and maybe I can imagine maybe the disciples TR said no fellas don't go back don't go back don't go back just stay with us it it'll work out no no we going back we going back and on they wrote back Copus and his friend and as they're there all of a sudden Jesus just shows up behind a bush and he comes out from behind the bush and he starts walking with him say why y'all so downcast what's the matter fellas everything all right say are you a stranger sir stranger now tell me what's going on have you not heard what happened what you mean what happened Jesus of Nazareth well tell me more he we thought that this man would be the one that would restore the kingdom and do all these things and and he died you know on a cross and we couldn't we couldn't understand why he went down like that and say he say oh is that right he says uh uh he began to break down scripture from Psalms and went back into Jeremiah maybe all the way back to Genesis and just start bringing out these scriptures about Christ and and and before you know it them fellas got to thinking like oh my what yeah that was manifested yeah that was right and and and just the the the preaching of the words is what lifted their Spirits oh my my my my then Jesus said oh fools slow of heart to believe all that the prophet said you said well my would you just keep walking with us sure keep walking with you got down into the city where they was going to spend the night and they found themselves a a room and Jesus said well I see y'all I'mma go say wait wait wait wait wait wait wait don't leave just stay with us tonight okay he just needs to be invited in CU once he got on the inside they begin to take out the bread my and there's something to drink maybe some Kool-Aid and they began to you know get ready to have a meal and Jesus Took the bread and he blessed it then he began to break it a certain way and when he start breaking bread a certain way them fellas said wait a minute there's only one person that can break bread the way he just broke bread and when they recognize that it was Christ yes my God he disappeared amen but that was all they needed because they come out of that that that that that that that despondent condition they were in they come out of that that defeated condition and they went running back to tell the disciples he's risen we just saw him sir yes sir what we need is we need the Holy Spirit to come and begin to break bread and what are we talking talking about we talk about breaking bread we talk about when the word of God is being preached cuz man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God so when the breaking of the bread is when the preaching of the word is going forth and Revelation is striking your heart amen oh we're not just going to church to say we went to church no I'm trying to I'm trying to get something from God I'm trying to make a Rapture let me K can't finish reading this scripture now they blind and naked and that I find it amazing that God is using this word you remember in Genesis when when when Adam and Eve so we found out that we was the reason that we couldn't come to church the way we used to come to church is because right now Adam and Eve had enough sister to realize something that changed but the church today on don't even realize they and oh Lord have mercy now I'mma tell y'all something even naturally people go to church today naked even naturally naturally they go to church naked you you oh God help me Jesus sister come to church with a mini skirt on that's nakedness that's nakedness no you don't come to church like that y'all remember it used to be a time it used to be a time we had our church closed we had our school closed we had our play clothes amen you didn't just come to church any kind of way you you got you you come to church because you dress in amen you're in the presence of a king you don't dress any kind of way in the presence of King if you got invited to go to the White House you don't go up there with no short pants on or nothing like that what you talking about you get get kicked out of there before you even got through the front door you got to come looking like you something come to the house of God looking like you something but but but but the church is naked and don't even realize the condition that they're in Rich they then I say you say I'm rich increase with goods and have need of nothing but he say knowest thou knowest not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind naked next verse I counsel thee buy of me go Tred in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white reignment that thou mayest be CL clothe and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear then he saids this and and anoint thine eyes with ourself so nowadays we want to be anointed people to pray over us we want to be anointed to be able to feel better in our body but here in the scripture say anoint your eyes with eyes myself so you can see this is how your blindness going to be taken away from you your spiritual blindness will be gone if we can get your eyes Anointed with ourself as many as I love oh my God the next verse says as many as I love you might you might you you you might have come the church today and you wonder why the pastor preaching like that as many as I love if God didn't love you wouldn't be feeling the way you're feeling right now any any any parent that love their child ain't going to let them get away with everything they ain't going to spoil that child they going to tell that child when they wrong they going a parent that really love their child it ain't going to be no timeouts go get my belt go get my belt it's it's it's it's going to be a spanking because if if we if we spare the rod and I believe the scripture I read it to y'all La the last Wednesday night that you spare at Rod you actually hate your child that's what the Bible say you hate you say you love them but the scripture say you hate them because you won't correct them you got to understand your child was born with an evil nature just like everybody else and evil things going to come out that child until they get the Holy Ghost amen as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent now I want you to notice one other condition about this church behold I stand at the door and knock now here's the problem that has happened with the church of this day this is why we needed a prophet to help us I'm not talking about the message church I'm talking about denominational churches Jesus said I stand at the door and knock that mean Jesus has been kicked out of his own church and they'll keep going on like people getting saved and everything else oh we had a time we had a Time uh-huh but Jesus said he's on the outside of his church knocking trying to get back in now let me tell you something the church as a whole denominations as a whole will not allow him back in why they got too much money without them they got too much popularity without them they got all these things without them so why allow him to come in and and how did he get kicked out they rejected his word if you can't receive his word you can't receive him behold I stand at the door and knock and I love this verse this part of the verse If any man that means it's an individual in the church that has to hear his voice and they have to see the condition of the church and that individual have to open up their heart and let him in let me tell you something when you open up your heart and let him in he won't let you stay in the denominational Church his spirit will lead you out because the Bible says that the holy spirit will lead you and guide you into part truth no it said all truth and and then then Paul come around and say he says he say says uh uh uh we we we did this in part we prophesied in part we did that in part he says but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part is done away with and I'm here to tell you that which is perfect is here amen young people that's why your parents don't go to denominational churches they might take you to visit it they have family day and Friends day and this day and that day and every day and it's just a little program to get you to come that's a way for the church to outreach you know how we Outreach we just preach the word Oh I Feel Jesus I stand the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne overcome what overcome this lay to see in spirit if you can overcome that I'll Grant I'll Grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear individual individual he that hath an ear here let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches what churches what churches is he talking about in every age there was a false church and a true church and you had to be able to rightly divide which one was right and which one was wrong let's go all the way back to Genesis it was two churches in the garden Kain had a church and he brought the best of the fruit of ground uh his vegetables everything he brought that and he worshiped the Lord with everything he had I mean that for that fellow was on his knees giving God praise but his brother Abel had a church and at his church at his altar he had a lamb that he done hacked to Pieces blood all over the place blood all over Abel and he he just walking the church with that lamb in his arms and they landed before the altar like oh God please receive my worship now according to the Book of Genesis there was one church that God was pleased with and the other church he wanted to pleased with even though they were worshiping I hope y'all get that even though they were worshiping God was not [Music] pleased they they worship they might have had a better band better praise team but God was not pleased with the worship and then God came down and even told k no no no no I don't I don't really like this I don't like this but I do like what your brother doing over there and if you just do the same thing your brother doing I'll receive it but you know what it just was not in King to follow God's Commandments so you know what Cain did to try to make God accept his sacrifice you want to know what Cain did he killed the other Church yes sir amen how do they kill it today cuz brother brandom told us you ain't got to necessarily stick a knife in a man's back but if you can just kill his reputation and his influence Hallelujah then uh you've committed murder oh my God my God my God all right I got one more quote and I'mma I'mma I'mma finish off the day I'm see if I keep moving this slow if I keep moving this slow it's going to be another year I told yall I got 11 scriptures to show you where brother Brandon's Ministry amen is identified now I I have given you two I'm going to this quote out of uh the Messiah I've given you two somebody tell me what two I've given you Malachi 4 thank you Revelation what no I ain't gave you Revelation 107 yet I ain't preached that yet Revelation 3 thank you very much if if you don't if you if if you got a notebook and you got a pen and you got some paper write down what I'm showing you that way when somebody come against you you'll be able to go right back my pastor already went through all these scriptures here it is and if you and and I didn't even the the church age book explains everything that I just talked about in Revelation 3 now a church age book that that's a that's three sermons in itself that one scripture three or four sermons right there I could go to church I'm just giving you a summary but you can go back to the church h and see what see what brother brandom said about did break that whole thing down I'm just giving you I mean these are Highlights Highlights but I've given you two scriptures thus far Malachi 4 and when I took Malachi 4 I actually went a little further and I did something else I showed you something else anything anybody remember what I showed you huh no not the Malachi 4 was yeah those prophecies right but I showed you something about Malachi 4 I said there were five comings of the spirit of Elijah I showed y'all that see y'all eating a lot remember the scripture says you going to eat in plenty and be satisfied you don't even know what you eating but I I'mma ask you these questions so we on the same page so Malachi 4 then I gave you five comments of Elijah so that people would wouldn't trip trip you up on that then I give you uh uh re Revelation 3:14 I'm coming to Revelation 10:7 I'mma get there I ain't got there yet but I'm coming I'm going to give y'all 11 or 12 scriptures I even gave you one more that might you might not have caught it but I did give it to you Joel 2:25 all right let me read this quote and I I'll I'll end right here the Messiah brother brandom says this now we found out that this leat toyan church the church age that we're in now if you want to read it Revelation the thir chapter we see what done what taken place when this message is supposed to go forth the church had been so worldly this is this is what the prophet said the church had been so worldly and organized itself till they organized its very God right out of it the most pathetic scripture I ever seen is revelation the thir chapter when at the latan church age Jesus standing on the outside of his own church knocking trying to get back in at the first church he was walking amongst the seven golden candlesticks the church ages but in the Le Dean he was on the outside trying to get back in his own church it shows what this age has done to him can I put it this way they have crucified Jesus all over again they've organized him out they've organized his Doctrine out they've organized his Bible out they got a book of Creeds or philos philosophies and so forth and they read and accept it instead instead cold confessions instead of letting God come in and make a messiah out of them give them the baptism of the Holy Ghost to show signs and wonders they organized it all out pushed him over to one side now he's on the outside making his last plea trying to get back in again at the door get back in stay step trying to get back in again at the door behold I stand at the door knock the lead Dean Church age trying to get back in his own church where they pressed him out isn't that pitiful that's the most pathetic thing I can think of of him in his own church giving his life for that church and doing the way that that they did and sent the light to the church how did he send the light to the church how did he in this last day we know we know we know Christ came as light to the church in his day oh my this just you know what in Noah's day God sent light to the church he sent it through the message that he gave Noah in Moses day God sent light to the church and he did it through the messenger that he sent that was the messenger of Moses if you want to get out of Egypt you better follow what Moses was saying if you want to get if you want your life spared during this great flood that was coming you better get in that Ark where Noah was preaching at Hallelujah and today the way God sends light to the to the world as he sends a prophet with the word of God Amen to bring the people back to the word and that's the light for their day my God right and and if if you want to get out of here you want to get out the mall we got a light we got a light yes sir we got a light to get you out if they turn off the lights in them mall we got a light to get you out of there just follow this light it's going to lead you to the exit and when you see your car in the parking lot you know you're right where you're supposed to be otherwise if he if brother Troy would have went out just any exit then he would end up walking all the way around the mall and and you know what walking around the mall in that condition you don't know whether it's going to rain on you you don't know if the thieves out there this fell don't know where he going oh we got one you don't know what you don't know and and and walking around that M you're going to get tired up this hill and back down there I still don't see my car God God have mercy but when you got somebody to know a little little little little something about something they can get you out the mall let me let me let me let me let me just say this real quick and I'm I'm coming musicians y'all come on there was a a brother one time he asked brother Brandon he says he had a dream he told him a dream he says you know I was asking how to get to heaven I ain't know how to get to heaven I just want to get to heaven and um and the brother uh he says he went to this one brother and asked him and he says uh he said he a preacher he says honestly I don't know how to tell you to get to heaven but ask this other preacher over here and uh got to that preacher and uh it got talking to him he says I just really want to get to heaven he says you know what I don't I don't really know how to get there either but uh you know this man coming up in overalls get him and ask him and the man coming up in overalls he say that happened to be you brother Brandon and overalls didn't look much like a preacher if you if you know see when your ear has been trained to a oh Lord I feel my help coming see your ear has been trained to that and you hear the prophet it's like I don't know too much about this hello somebody but you got to go beyond your emotions and your feelings and all of that to hear truth he said he say in the dream he he said he said the man with overalls told him says he said you want to know how to get to heaven he says okay I want you to go uh up this mountain and then uh down this Valley and then uh back up this mountain and then and then down this Valley and and he says and said he he said he says just just keep doing that he says then the man with overall just kind of disappeared and he saids no no I want you to go with said no no no no I gave you instructions I gave you the instructions on how to get there he said just follow the bloody footprints that you see going up that mountain and and down in that Valley and up that mountain and and down and say follow the bloody Footprints God is taking his Prophet home but you don't know what we doing we following who you know who know whose blood made these Footprints it wasn't a prophet it was Jesus blood the prophet pointed us back to Jesus and it got on out the way and all we got to do is follow them bloody Footprints it's going to lead us out the mall [Music] hallu he's on the outside making his last flee trying to get back in again at the door behold I stand at the door and knock the Ley and church H trying to get back in his own church amen where they pressed him out isn't that pitiful that's the most pathetic thing I can think of of him in his own church giving his life for that church and doing the way they did and sent the light to the church and and and said he did and they rejected it and pushed him on the outside accepted some kind of a Creed or something the church had made up and there he is standing at the outside trying to get in kicked out of his own church and how many churches are preaching about him how many churches are talking about him but don't even realize he's nowhere in the midst nowhere where in the midst see again as brother Troy saying people think that we when we preach things like this we say things like this they they they mistakenly think that we're arrogant I'm not arrogant I'm just speaking truth and and and and you misinterpreting my speaking Truth for arrogance and and another thing when I speak truth with a conviction it sounds arrogant to you because you listening for the wrong thing but let me let me give you another Insight on that when a woman decides she's going to accept a man's proposal for marriage that man you know will you marry me and and and and and she's so happy that he's finally come to this decision to marry her when she gets the ring from she accepts the ring from that man is it arrogance that she walk around with that ring or is it uh that she's chosen that she's elected that she's bride so if I'm bride and he chose me am I supposed to be ashamed that he chose me no I'll wear my ring and I I'll praise the Lord I will I will praise the Lord let everybody else see my ring because this what he gave me I'm not arrogant I'm chosen I'm elected I'm right I am who God says I am God bless you Church what a year it has been and I'm glad God got us going further in this amen amen we're going to have word of prayer um so while all y'all was all the parents and everything with fellowship and I
