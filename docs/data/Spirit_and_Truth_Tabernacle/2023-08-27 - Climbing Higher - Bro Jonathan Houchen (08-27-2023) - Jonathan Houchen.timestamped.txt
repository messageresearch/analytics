[57:15] stranger to us amen he and his precious
[57:18] wife sister Sarah amen they have visited
[57:21] us many times I've been here in
[57:24] fellowship with us and and uh but this
[57:27] this morning brother Jonathan comes with
[57:29] amen a new responsibility amen he has to
[57:34] deliver to us the word of the Lord and
[57:37] the Lord has called him to Ministry for
[57:38] a little bit now and I was telling him
[57:41] this morning one of the things that I
[57:42] appreciate about ministers is when they
[57:45] can wait on their Ministry the Bible
[57:48] tells us that a man's gift that maketh
[57:51] room for himself and it brings him
[57:53] before great men and for me when I see a
[57:56] minister that's just able to wait on
[57:58] this ministry and just wait on the Lord
[58:00] to open up the door not trying to push
[58:02] Doors Down you ain't got to force no
[58:04] Doors Down down when God called you to
[58:06] minister you ain't got to do that God
[58:08] will always open up the door oh somebody
[58:11] I'd have said man I'm a living witness
[58:13] you know every every everywhere that
[58:17] I've gone it's been because God has
[58:19] called me there it's not because I went
[58:21] seeking an opportunity I don't have to
[58:23] seek opportunities there's there's
[58:25] um 52 weeks in a year and there's two
[58:29] Services a week at Spirit of Truth
[58:31] Tabernacle that makes 104 services that
[58:35] I can preach right here so I don't have
[58:39] to go anywhere right here there's this
[58:42] this Pulpit is where I can preach from
[58:43] and I thank God for that but you know
[58:45] what the Lord does is that he don't just
[58:47] call me here he's got others that he
[58:50] won't preaching from this pulpit and I
[58:52] get fed too when the other ones come so
[58:55] I thank God for that right but what I
[58:57] want to just say is that we wait on the
[58:59] Lord amen for any door to open uh for us
[59:02] and this morning the Lord has opened the
[59:03] door for our brother Jonathan to come
[59:05] and to deliver his heart to us and
[59:08] tonight another door has been open for
[59:10] our brother and I'm so grateful to see
[59:11] the Lord do these things
[59:14] amen amen it means so much to me amen so
[59:17] uh we'll get ready to welcome him but
[59:19] let's just pray before he comes amen

[59:36] sometimes you go beyond our just normal
[59:40] means of income you go beyond and bless
[59:42] us in other ways and father we are
[59:44] grateful to be able to come and give it
[59:46] back to you in the forms of time that
[59:49] offering father we ask that you would
[59:51] use this for the further to be a kingdom
[59:53] may you Lord continue to expand amen or
[59:58] what you would have us to be a part of
[59:59] we realize that even where we are right
[1:00:01] now God is temporary so we're thanking
[1:00:03] you in advance Lord for the new church
[1:00:06] and new school we we know that you have
[1:00:09] it all under control and your timing is
[1:00:10] perfect amen we ain't got to force no

[1:03:33] my theme song
[1:03:35] God's mercy
[1:03:38] praise His Mercy rewrote my life
[1:03:43] there's been a lot of people born
[1:03:45] Through the Ages
[1:03:47] different ones born for different
[1:03:49] reasons
[1:03:51] Michael Jordan was undoubtedly born to
[1:03:54] play basketball
[1:03:56] but I was born to be a believer
[1:04:01] Peyton Manning was born to play football
[1:04:03] but I was born to be a believer
[1:04:07] Wayne Gretzky was born to play hockey
[1:04:10] but I was born to be a believer was
[1:04:14] anybody else in here born to be a
[1:04:15] believer
[1:04:17] I believe we have a room full of
[1:04:19] Believers to
[1:04:22] [Music]
[1:04:26] I want to thank brother Jack
[1:04:31] for having me
[1:04:33] it's been a it's been a journey
[1:04:37] first time I ever met brother Jack was
[1:04:40] on a golf course
[1:04:42] shook the man's hand
[1:04:45] I knew there was something different
[1:04:46] about that man I knew he was born to be
[1:04:49] a believer all right
[1:04:53] first time I came into this church and
[1:04:56] met this group of people
[1:04:59] looked around these brothers in the way
[1:05:01] they were dressed
[1:05:03] said man these are my brothers right
[1:05:06] here
[1:05:08] these are my brothers
[1:05:11] I hope nobody takes offenses but you
[1:05:13] know it's not fair a black man can dress
[1:05:17] to the nines and he can go preach in the
[1:05:20] hills of Kentucky and nobody says a
[1:05:22] thing
[1:05:23] but a white man no I gotta put on a
[1:05:26] white shirt
[1:05:27] just a basic jacket so I took the
[1:05:30] liberty this morning we're putting on
[1:05:32] that purple shirt and a gold tie
[1:05:43] so once again I I really appreciate the
[1:05:46] invite
[1:05:47] I know Sarah is out here my wife she's
[1:05:49] been getting her worship on brother
[1:05:51] Solomon she's been waiting for this
[1:05:56] truly love this church I fell in love
[1:05:58] with you guys the moment I got here
[1:06:01] and uh yes sir thank you musicians
[1:06:05] [Music]
[1:06:10] but uh yes if we could uh turn in our
[1:06:14] Bibles
[1:06:15] to Psalms 23 we're going to read one
[1:06:18] through six
[1:06:19] and I think this is probably very
[1:06:21] familiar to most of you most of you
[1:06:23] probably know this by heart
[1:06:31] Psalms 23
[1:06:33] 1-6
[1:06:37] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[1:06:41] he maketh me to lie down in Green
[1:06:44] Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still
[1:06:47] Waters he restoreth my soul
[1:06:51] he leadeth me in the path of
[1:06:53] righteousness for his name's sake
[1:06:56] yea though I walk through the valley of
[1:06:58] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[1:07:01] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[1:07:04] staff they comfort me
[1:07:06] thou prepares the table before me in the
[1:07:09] presence of mine enemies thou anointest
[1:07:12] my head with oil my cup runneth over
[1:07:15] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:07:18] me all the days of my life
[1:07:21] and I will dwell in the house of the
[1:07:23] Lord forever
[1:07:25] let's pray
[1:07:28] dear heavenly father Lord
[1:07:31] as I stand here before this group of
[1:07:33] people father your group of people Lord
[1:07:35] Lord and I can feel your presence here
[1:07:37] father
[1:07:39] Lord here we are in this little little
[1:07:41] room here in a school father it doesn't
[1:07:45] matter if we're here if we were out in a
[1:07:46] field or if we were in the nicest Church
[1:07:48] in this nation father Lord the main
[1:07:51] thing is is that you are here Lord and
[1:07:54] you promised where two or three are
[1:07:55] gathered in your name you would be in
[1:07:57] the midst father
[1:07:58] so Lord I pray father that you would
[1:08:00] just take complete control of this
[1:08:02] service
[1:08:03] Lord I pray that everything that I say
[1:08:05] father would just be what you would have
[1:08:07] me say Lord
[1:08:09] Lord I pray that you would anoint me I
[1:08:11] pray that you would anoint your people
[1:08:13] father Lord let him hear what they would
[1:08:15] what you would have for him Lord let
[1:08:17] them open their hearts father and
[1:08:19] receive what you would have Lord
[1:08:21] Lord we thank you for all that you do
[1:08:24] for us Lord
[1:08:25] we love you with all of our hearts in
[1:08:27] Jesus name I pray amen
[1:08:30] you may be seated thank you
[1:08:34] so
[1:08:36] the name of my sermon is climbing higher
[1:08:41] and I read the the scriptures
[1:08:44] because they they fit so well
[1:08:46] with our journey
[1:08:49] through life
[1:08:50] I took the I took those scriptures and I
[1:08:54] wrote a little thing here
[1:08:57] just what they what that means to me
[1:09:01] he will feed Me Guide Me and protect me
[1:09:05] even though I walk through a valley of
[1:09:07] death I have nothing to fear because he
[1:09:11] is with me
[1:09:13] with his rod and his staff he will
[1:09:15] protect and guide me which comforts me
[1:09:19] because his goodness and mercy follow me
[1:09:23] I know that he loves me
[1:09:27] he loved me before I loved him
[1:09:30] and I will be in his presence all the
[1:09:34] days of my life
[1:09:39] I'm gonna tell you a little story here
[1:09:40] about what inspired this sermon
[1:09:44] so Sarah and I we like to hike
[1:09:47] I know that's
[1:09:48] hard to believe that this fat guy can
[1:09:51] actually hike but I can
[1:09:54] so we like to hike so we went
[1:09:57] to Colorado
[1:09:59] and Sarah picked out this hike that she
[1:10:02] wanted to do and it's called the the
[1:10:04] Manitou incline okay it's
[1:10:08] 2744 steps that go up the side of a
[1:10:11] mountain
[1:10:12] it's uh 2 000 feet up it's almost one
[1:10:15] mile up
[1:10:17] there was another one that we did
[1:10:19] in Gatlinburg Tennessee it's called the
[1:10:22] Ramsey Cascades
[1:10:24] it's 2200 square 2200 feet up in four
[1:10:28] miles
[1:10:30] now that one right there
[1:10:33] when we went in and we were talking to
[1:10:35] the guide
[1:10:36] and we were just telling him you know we
[1:10:38] wanted a you know just like a casual
[1:10:39] hike is what we were looking for and
[1:10:42] when he started explaining to me what it
[1:10:44] was I misunderstood what he said I I
[1:10:46] thought he was talking about the the
[1:10:48] grade but he was talking about how many
[1:10:50] feet up it was in four miles
[1:10:52] so on that one right there we went we
[1:10:55] were very unprepared okay so we had just
[1:10:58] I think we had two and a half bottles of
[1:11:00] water with us uh and I mean it was a it
[1:11:03] was a hike I mean it was rough I mean it
[1:11:05] was one of those hikes where you you
[1:11:06] started going up this and you I mean it
[1:11:08] was very tempting to turn around and say
[1:11:09] never mind
[1:11:10] it was a hike and the the higher you got
[1:11:13] the harder
[1:11:15] The Climb guy wow
[1:11:17] there's no markers on this Trail there
[1:11:20] was one it was a I think a mile and a
[1:11:22] half in it told us we had two and a half
[1:11:24] miles to go
[1:11:25] no markers anywhere you had no idea how
[1:11:28] much further you had to go because you
[1:11:30] couldn't see anything the turns and you
[1:11:32] know the trees and everything you can't
[1:11:33] see nothing you're just hiking hard
[1:11:38] but the one
[1:11:40] in Colorado
[1:11:44] it's steps there's markers periodically
[1:11:47] telling you what step you're on
[1:11:49] so it's marked a little differently
[1:11:52] so the view from
[1:11:54] from the start of each of these was was
[1:11:56] drastically different Colorado we're
[1:11:59] standing at the bottom of the steps and
[1:12:00] you're looking up and that day was it
[1:12:03] was a little rainy a little cloudy so I
[1:12:05] mean the stairs just literally
[1:12:06] disappeared into the clouds
[1:12:09] so but I mean but you could see what you
[1:12:11] were doing you know the one in Tennessee
[1:12:15] there's trees you're I mean you know we
[1:12:17] were in the the forest there's trees you
[1:12:20] can't you know you can see maybe you
[1:12:21] know 100 yards in front of you and then
[1:12:23] you can't see any further so you you
[1:12:24] know that's that's kind of what you know
[1:12:26] they look like at the beginning
[1:12:28] but you know before we even started
[1:12:31] these you know well more or less the one
[1:12:34] in Colorado we kind of got a plan
[1:12:36] together you know how are we gonna how
[1:12:37] are we gonna try to tackle this you know
[1:12:39] it's a lot of steps so there's a thought
[1:12:42] process of well you know maybe we'll do
[1:12:44] so many steps at a time and we'll take a
[1:12:45] break so we started getting a plan
[1:12:47] together for that one
[1:12:49] now the one for Gatlinburg as I
[1:12:51] mentioned no not so much of a plan just
[1:12:54] because
[1:12:55] me and not understanding what this guy
[1:12:57] was trying to tell me you know so we
[1:12:59] didn't have so much of a plan
[1:13:01] but as we started hiking on each of
[1:13:04] these
[1:13:05] we started you know you you notice
[1:13:07] different things
[1:13:10] some of them some some places where you
[1:13:12] get is dangerous as I was mentioning
[1:13:15] Colorado it was it was raining a little
[1:13:17] bit and you know these steps they're
[1:13:19] just wooden railroad ties I mean they
[1:13:21] get they get slippery you know and
[1:13:23] you're a long ways up you don't want to
[1:13:25] slip okay you know and then then in in
[1:13:28] uh Gatlinburg you know you get to uh you
[1:13:31] know places where the path Narrows and
[1:13:33] there's some sharp turns and the there's
[1:13:35] roots and rocks everywhere it's not good
[1:13:37] footing and I mean it wouldn't take
[1:13:38] nothing to misstep and fall off the the
[1:13:41] side you know so I mean it was dangerous
[1:13:42] it you know it was it was rough the
[1:13:44] terrain was rough and it was dangerous
[1:13:47] areas and in Colorado the further we got
[1:13:49] up the colder it was getting my hair
[1:13:52] started freezing up I was reaching down
[1:13:54] picking up these ice Pebbles off the
[1:13:56] ground which was the coolest thing I
[1:13:58] think I've ever seen they were like
[1:13:59] perfectly round all of them exactly the
[1:14:01] same size it was like God's ice machine
[1:14:04] you know it was just super cool you know
[1:14:07] um but um
[1:14:08] but the views
[1:14:10] the higher up we went the better the
[1:14:12] view got
[1:14:13] you know you get up those those stairs
[1:14:17] in Colorado you turn around and you look
[1:14:19] and you're you know you're looking down
[1:14:21] through the clouds you know just
[1:14:23] beautiful view you know in Tennessee it
[1:14:27] wasn't so much as looking out but just
[1:14:28] looking at the different things the
[1:14:30] stream that was running beside you the
[1:14:32] waterfalls you know just beautiful views
[1:14:34] but then there was one other thing that
[1:14:36] we noticed
[1:14:38] and that was the people
[1:14:40] there's many other people on these
[1:14:42] trails
[1:14:44] some of them were climbing faster
[1:14:46] some of them were climbing slower
[1:14:49] some of them were just kind of with us
[1:14:51] we stuck with a group for quite a while
[1:14:53] at one point we just kind of you know
[1:14:56] walked together up the the one in
[1:14:58] Colorado
[1:14:59] but you look around some of them they
[1:15:01] needed help
[1:15:02] some of them were there to help
[1:15:05] so of course
[1:15:08] this got me to thinking about our
[1:15:10] spiritual walk
[1:15:12] and that's what we want to talk about
[1:15:15] so let's talk about this spiritual climb
[1:15:17] that we're on
[1:15:19] so we are every one of us in this room
[1:15:23] amen we're all
[1:15:24] born the same way we were all born in
[1:15:29] sin yes shaped in iniquity came in this
[1:15:32] world speaking lies every one of us
[1:15:35] neither one of us was born indifferent
[1:15:36] he didn't take anybody and say I must
[1:15:38] start this one out a little bit ahead of
[1:15:40] this one or I'm gonna start this one out
[1:15:41] a little bit behind this we started out
[1:15:43] the same place
[1:15:49] so as you start this climb
[1:15:52] what are our expectations
[1:15:54] should we have expectations
[1:15:56] and should we be placing expectations on
[1:15:59] other people
[1:16:01] because I can tell you in this climb
[1:16:06] you will only climb as fast as he wants
[1:16:09] you to go
[1:16:12] you will only
[1:16:15] go as fast as he will allow you so it
[1:16:17] doesn't matter what this person's doing
[1:16:19] this person's doing or what this
[1:16:22] person's doing up here
[1:16:24] don't have an expectation of I'm moving
[1:16:26] too slow
[1:16:28] just allow him to lead you and guide you
[1:16:34] brother Brown said in 1961
[1:16:37] we must be born again
[1:16:39] tell them all about yeah I'm sorry 61 we
[1:16:43] must be born again tell them all about
[1:16:44] this tonight you're a sinner tomorrow
[1:16:46] you're a manifested sons of God nonsense
[1:16:50] where do you get that in the word babies
[1:16:53] are not born men they're born babies
[1:16:55] right and grow them in
[1:16:58] so what should the expectation be
[1:17:01] according to brother Branham we all
[1:17:03] start as babies
[1:17:05] spiritually again we all start in the
[1:17:08] same the same place
[1:17:13] but as we come to these First Steps
[1:17:16] first part of this path we're all going
[1:17:18] to by human nature develop a plan as as
[1:17:22] Sarah and I did on the steps to Colorado
[1:17:24] so you start to develop a plan you know
[1:17:30] what this should look like
[1:17:32] maybe it's where are we going to go to
[1:17:34] church
[1:17:35] how often are we going to go to church
[1:17:36] how often are we going to read our Bible
[1:17:39] how often are we going to pray are we
[1:17:41] going to do devotions or not but you
[1:17:43] start to develop a plan right right I
[1:17:45] think human nature that you we do that
[1:17:47] because we want to see results you know
[1:17:50] I am person that I don't plan anything
[1:17:52] you can ask my wife it drives her
[1:17:54] absolutely crazy I don't plan nothing I
[1:17:57] go whatever whoever is doing what I'm
[1:17:59] good with that until it comes to food
[1:18:01] and then I might have something to say
[1:18:02] with that
[1:18:04] but I don't plan but you know she plans
[1:18:07] and and and that's great you know and
[1:18:09] it's because you know we we want to
[1:18:11] start off with a plan because even even
[1:18:13] when I I start to work on a project that
[1:18:15] you know there's a plan because even
[1:18:17] though I'm not a planner I still want to
[1:18:18] see results
[1:18:20] so on our Manitou climb in Colorado we
[1:18:24] you know before we do this we think you
[1:18:26] know let's start off doing 50 steps at a
[1:18:27] time let's see how that goes let's see
[1:18:30] if I can still breathe after 50 steps if
[1:18:32] I can hey let's increase it to 75 maybe
[1:18:34] we'll go to 100. but that was the plan
[1:18:38] the first few steps that you take
[1:18:41] will always typically be your easiest
[1:18:44] steps
[1:18:47] you start coming to church and it's like
[1:18:50] well maybe I'm only going to come once a
[1:18:52] month
[1:18:54] you know this is this is where where
[1:18:56] it's the easiest is right here
[1:18:59] but shortly after a few steps that's
[1:19:01] when your plan will start develop to
[1:19:02] develop because you will have a plan
[1:19:05] so that plan will start to develop
[1:19:08] and you will catch the eye of somebody
[1:19:10] because you're going to start making a
[1:19:11] little bit of movement
[1:19:12] maybe you go four or five steps maybe
[1:19:15] you get 10 15 Steps but you're going to
[1:19:18] catch the eye of somebody and that's
[1:19:20] somebody's name is Satan
[1:19:24] now
[1:19:26] Satan is going to look over there and
[1:19:28] he's thinking okay
[1:19:30] they're making a a few steps here no big
[1:19:33] deal I've got I got bigger problems with
[1:19:35] the people that are up here in front of
[1:19:37] them okay
[1:19:38] so maybe I'm just gonna throw a little
[1:19:42] I'm broke demon their way
[1:19:44] okay I'm broke like I can't go to
[1:19:47] McDonald's demon their way okay or maybe
[1:19:49] I'm gonna send a demon of you know a
[1:19:52] sickness demon that way not nothing in
[1:19:54] big you know I'm just gonna give them
[1:19:56] you know a bad back or something you
[1:19:58] know just you know
[1:20:00] now people
[1:20:02] when this comes
[1:20:04] and it's coming
[1:20:05] it is coming
[1:20:07] when this comes there are people that
[1:20:10] may say hey you know what I don't want
[1:20:12] no part of this
[1:20:13] you know before I was serving the lord I
[1:20:16] didn't have these problems I had plenty
[1:20:18] of money wasn't nothing wrong with my
[1:20:19] back let's let's back up here let's go
[1:20:22] backwards
[1:20:24] other people
[1:20:26] will freeze up
[1:20:28] maybe if I stand here and I don't move
[1:20:30] he'll leave me alone
[1:20:33] but then there's the few that it will
[1:20:35] Propel forward
[1:20:37] and it will propel them forward because
[1:20:39] they are developing a relationship with
[1:20:42] Christ and then those times come when he
[1:20:45] starts attacking they'll get to their
[1:20:48] knees
[1:20:49] and they'll start praying they'll start
[1:20:51] asking for help
[1:20:54] and it'll move them forward
[1:20:59] now
[1:21:01] in your physical in these physical
[1:21:04] climbs like as I was saying we had these
[1:21:06] different markers that we were we would
[1:21:08] come to like on the the man too we have
[1:21:10] the telling us where we're at there's
[1:21:12] spiritual climb is really no different
[1:21:14] as you're climbing you're going to hit
[1:21:17] different markers
[1:21:19] um
[1:21:22] as I said like in Colorado I don't know
[1:21:25] it was maybe every 200 steps there was a
[1:21:27] marker telling us where we were at now
[1:21:29] in Tennessee it was a little different
[1:21:30] we had one marker we did have a marker
[1:21:32] but it was only one so it was a lot of
[1:21:34] times again you're climbing you have no
[1:21:36] idea where you're at what's going on you
[1:21:39] know maybe there's and there was very
[1:21:40] few people on that trail so even trying
[1:21:42] to find somebody to ask for help
[1:21:45] was difficult
[1:21:50] but so
[1:21:52] as you're climbing
[1:21:56] you come to a marker
[1:21:58] I have just realized that Jesus Christ
[1:22:01] is alive
[1:22:03] and that he loves me and he died for me
[1:22:06] this is a marker that I've hit
[1:22:08] so I made it to a first marker
[1:22:11] now I really start exercising my plan I
[1:22:14] start climbing a little faster
[1:22:17] now the only way you're going to climb
[1:22:19] faster is by Revelation amen
[1:22:23] amen Revelation is found
[1:22:26] in our Bibles right
[1:22:28] it's found in our tapes
[1:22:33] tapes yes
[1:22:35] yes I'm gonna tell you guys a little
[1:22:36] story real quick
[1:22:38] brother like I said I don't
[1:22:41] I don't keep a timer so come take it if
[1:22:44] I'm too long okay
[1:22:46] so about
[1:22:48] two months ago
[1:22:50] I wake up I think it was about two
[1:22:52] o'clock in the morning I wake up
[1:22:55] my ribs over here hurting bad
[1:22:59] I had this pain in my back
[1:23:01] my like right here in my chest just I it
[1:23:05] was hard I didn't know if I was having a
[1:23:07] heart attack I wasn't sure what was
[1:23:08] going on wasn't no way I was letting my
[1:23:10] wife call a doctor is like Lord if it's
[1:23:12] my time take me home
[1:23:14] but so but the pain started getting
[1:23:17] worse and worse I'd never experienced
[1:23:19] anything like this before so I get up
[1:23:21] out of bed
[1:23:23] and I go down into another room of the
[1:23:25] house because I didn't want to wake her
[1:23:26] up but eventually she comes down there
[1:23:28] and I was in so much pain
[1:23:30] I was banging my head against the wall
[1:23:32] I've never been in that much pain in my
[1:23:34] life
[1:23:35] it's just my wife she Googles that's
[1:23:38] what she does
[1:23:39] so she starts Googling to see what you
[1:23:42] know these symptoms what's going on she
[1:23:44] comes up with them having a gallbladder
[1:23:45] attack
[1:23:48] so she puts in a prayer request on our
[1:23:51] our church thing which was amazing to
[1:23:54] see the response about three o'clock in
[1:23:55] the morning how many people started
[1:23:56] praying for me right then was
[1:23:58] unbelievable
[1:23:59] but
[1:24:02] a couple hours after that the pain goes
[1:24:04] away
[1:24:06] she's telling me that I've had a
[1:24:07] gallbladder attack I tell some you know
[1:24:09] some some of the people from the church
[1:24:10] were asking me about it and I said well
[1:24:12] it appears I had a gallbladder attack
[1:24:13] and there was many of them saying well
[1:24:15] that won't be the last one you're gonna
[1:24:17] have to have that gallbladder removed
[1:24:19] I was like well you don't know my God
[1:24:22] so I've always heard that
[1:24:25] peanuts nuts any kind of a nut will
[1:24:27] bring on a gallbladder attack so the
[1:24:29] next night I told my girls go up to
[1:24:32] Dairy Queen
[1:24:33] get me a Snickers blizzard with extra
[1:24:35] Snickers
[1:24:37] because I'm just stupid that way
[1:24:40] some people say man you're gonna poke
[1:24:42] the bear you know and I'm like you know
[1:24:44] what I'd rather poke him and see him
[1:24:46] coming from
[1:24:47] in front of me than him jump on my back
[1:24:51] so I get the blizzard I eat the blizzard
[1:24:53] no problems at all I'm claiming I'm
[1:24:56] Healed
[1:24:57] it's about six weeks later
[1:24:59] I think it was a Sunday night right
[1:25:01] after service and I mean right after
[1:25:03] service we had I haven't even left out
[1:25:05] of the church yet I started feeling that
[1:25:07] pain in my ribs
[1:25:09] like all right Satan here we go
[1:25:12] so we go and we meet some people at at a
[1:25:15] little restaurant and I'm sitting there
[1:25:17] and the pain is becoming more and more
[1:25:19] intense
[1:25:20] and I'm like well
[1:25:22] I'm not going to fight this sitting
[1:25:23] right here
[1:25:24] so I text my wife she was sitting at the
[1:25:27] other in the table I said I don't want
[1:25:28] you to ask me a single question
[1:25:30] because I ain't I'm not going to profess
[1:25:32] what what what Satan's trying to put on
[1:25:34] me so don't ask me nothing but we need
[1:25:36] to go home
[1:25:37] she said okay so we get in the car we go
[1:25:39] home I asked her I said you have a pain
[1:25:41] medicine any pain pills she's like yeah
[1:25:44] I I've had one gallbladder I don't even
[1:25:46] know if a pain pill will work I don't
[1:25:48] know so I I take the pain pill we get
[1:25:51] ready for bed
[1:25:53] I take the pain pill
[1:25:54] we lay down in bed
[1:25:56] she starts playing a tape
[1:25:58] just so happens to be on a prayer line
[1:26:02] I'd had a pill in me for five minutes
[1:26:04] okay
[1:26:05] brother Brandon prays for two people he
[1:26:08] says you're healed
[1:26:11] just like that the pain left not slowly
[1:26:16] it left like that
[1:26:19] is not a pain pill that did that
[1:26:22] it was because there is an anointing on
[1:26:25] those tapes
[1:26:27] there's an anointing on those tapes
[1:26:30] that is why I listened to tapes that is
[1:26:33] why we should be listening to tapes I
[1:26:36] have a pen that I normally wear and I
[1:26:37] forgot mine and I forgot brother Jack so
[1:26:39] when you come to Indiana I'll give you
[1:26:40] yours it says tape boy okay because I am
[1:26:44] a tape boy I've had people say I don't
[1:26:47] know how you can wear that pin and I'm
[1:26:49] thinking how do you not wear the pen are
[1:26:52] you a message believer do you listen to
[1:26:54] tapes I'm a tape boy I can't help that a
[1:26:57] group of people have tried to make that
[1:26:59] something it's not I am a tape boy and
[1:27:02] there's an anointing on those tapes we
[1:27:04] are message believers
[1:27:06] foreign
[1:27:10] Revelation comes from the word of God
[1:27:13] this is how you climb higher
[1:27:18] amen now in your earlier stages of
[1:27:20] climbing
[1:27:23] some things are going to start to
[1:27:24] develop
[1:27:25] one of the first ones that you will see
[1:27:27] develop
[1:27:30] is leadership
[1:27:32] what I mean by leadership
[1:27:35] in our physical climb
[1:27:38] when Sarah and I would hike anytime we
[1:27:40] hike now she walks
[1:27:42] faster than me in in 99 of the cases she
[1:27:46] walks faster than me okay
[1:27:48] I don't get I don't get in a hurry for
[1:27:50] much that's just me unless I'm at work
[1:27:53] you put me in Lowe's or Home Depot all
[1:27:55] of a sudden I become like Mr Speedy okay
[1:27:58] I don't know what it is but that's just
[1:28:00] how I am but so but when we go on a hike
[1:28:02] I will normally when that path like on
[1:28:05] that that hike in um
[1:28:07] Tennessee that path narrowed and it was
[1:28:09] single file well I got in front of her
[1:28:12] now I know I'm aggravating her because
[1:28:14] she's wanting to go faster than me but
[1:28:16] there's something inside of me
[1:28:19] as a man
[1:28:22] that I was born with
[1:28:24] I was born to want to protect
[1:28:28] I was born to want to provide
[1:28:31] and to lead okay that's how I was born I
[1:28:34] can't help but that's how I was born so
[1:28:37] when we hike I want to be the one in
[1:28:40] front because if something's going to go
[1:28:41] wrong I want to be the one
[1:28:44] that can that can protect
[1:28:47] my daughters will run off in front of us
[1:28:49] sometimes and I'm telling them slow down
[1:28:51] get back here you know because I want to
[1:28:53] protect them I want to lead them
[1:28:55] well in your spiritual walk there's this
[1:28:59] is no difference leadership will show
[1:29:01] when Sarah and I started coming back to
[1:29:03] church this has been a little over five
[1:29:06] years ago
[1:29:08] she had a question of why are you
[1:29:11] growing faster spiritually
[1:29:15] what was because headship was starting
[1:29:17] to develop there wasn't nothing that I
[1:29:20] did I didn't even know I didn't know how
[1:29:21] to answer her question I don't know I
[1:29:23] could see what she was saying yes I'm
[1:29:25] moving faster spiritually but why I
[1:29:27] don't know
[1:29:28] was because headship was starting to
[1:29:31] develop leadership headship same thing
[1:29:34] so I looked this up
[1:29:38] when you're when you're a professional
[1:29:40] rock climber
[1:29:42] the responsibility
[1:29:44] lies on that lead climber
[1:29:49] a lead climber
[1:29:51] he knows how to stack a rope so you
[1:29:53] don't get a nod in a rope he knows
[1:29:55] exactly how to do that
[1:29:57] he knows how to do what's called closing
[1:29:59] a system which is putting a knot in the
[1:30:01] right place so nobody slides off
[1:30:04] he knows how to attach quick draws and
[1:30:07] anchors for everyone as they're going up
[1:30:11] he knows how to properly clip bolts so
[1:30:15] no one Falls
[1:30:17] knowing
[1:30:18] uh
[1:30:20] uh to skip quick draws to ensure every
[1:30:22] step is done properly so he knows how to
[1:30:25] tie everybody off
[1:30:27] one of the most important things that I
[1:30:29] thought or I saw was the lead climber
[1:30:32] must always see
[1:30:35] and be able to identify fall potentials
[1:30:41] so as headship starts to develop
[1:30:45] and here we go Brothers
[1:30:48] so what does headship look like
[1:30:51] and why are why why or why not would it
[1:30:55] manifest
[1:30:57] headship is the order in which he from
[1:31:02] the beginning
[1:31:04] said this is how I want my family to
[1:31:06] look
[1:31:08] that is what headship is
[1:31:11] Ephesians 5 22-25 wives submit
[1:31:16] yourselves unto your own husbands
[1:31:18] as unto the Lord
[1:31:20] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:31:23] even as Christ is the head of the church
[1:31:26] and he is the savior of the body
[1:31:28] therefore as the church is subject unto
[1:31:31] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[1:31:33] husbands in everything
[1:31:36] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[1:31:41] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:31:44] for it
[1:31:48] that scripture is headship yes
[1:31:53] I see men
[1:31:56] in message churches
[1:31:58] [Music]
[1:31:59] that walk around
[1:32:01] with that chest puffed out
[1:32:05] they want to be
[1:32:08] the leader
[1:32:10] in their house when it comes to how is
[1:32:13] my wife going to look
[1:32:15] whether she's going to look Holiness or
[1:32:17] not but how's she going to look
[1:32:20] is she going to work or not
[1:32:23] how submissive
[1:32:25] is my wife going to be
[1:32:28] where are my kids going to go to school
[1:32:30] are they going to school go to a public
[1:32:31] school home school are they going to
[1:32:33] play sports or not
[1:32:34] how involved are they going to be in
[1:32:36] sports when it comes to dating oh
[1:32:38] they're going to really have their
[1:32:41] their words in that
[1:32:45] yeah this is dictatorship
[1:32:47] there's a big difference between
[1:32:49] headship and dictatorship
[1:32:53] dictatorship is done without love it is
[1:32:56] done because I said you're going to do
[1:32:58] it because I said you're going to do it
[1:33:00] there's nothing biblically to back it up
[1:33:03] there's nothing that is dictatorship
[1:33:09] headship though
[1:33:11] these men
[1:33:13] when it comes to leading their their
[1:33:15] their their families spiritually
[1:33:18] they run and they hide like a coward
[1:33:22] because they do not want to be
[1:33:25] responsible
[1:33:26] to be as that lead climber they don't
[1:33:30] want that responsibility
[1:33:33] now the scenario that I'm talking about
[1:33:34] right now is typically My Generation or
[1:33:38] above
[1:33:39] okay
[1:33:40] but let's talk about
[1:33:42] the new generation that's coming up
[1:33:45] the ones that are below me
[1:33:48] these young men
[1:33:50] seem to be having a problem
[1:33:53] getting out of mommy and daddy's
[1:33:54] basement
[1:33:58] they're down there playing their playing
[1:34:00] their video games
[1:34:04] they're having problems here
[1:34:06] but like I mentioned before from the
[1:34:09] beginning of time men were born
[1:34:12] with something inside them
[1:34:15] something to lead
[1:34:17] to protect to provide that is how we
[1:34:20] were born
[1:34:22] now Society
[1:34:24] is doing everything they can do to tear
[1:34:27] headship down
[1:34:29] they are reaching in and they're pulling
[1:34:32] this out and they're saying to a young
[1:34:34] man no
[1:34:35] you are not allowed to do this because
[1:34:38] men and women are equal
[1:34:41] and so what do you get from the result
[1:34:43] of this you get a man that is in his mom
[1:34:45] and dad's basement because he doesn't
[1:34:48] know what to do
[1:34:50] he has a desire to do one thing but
[1:34:53] Society is telling you no you cannot do
[1:34:55] that
[1:35:01] amen
[1:35:02] but
[1:35:04] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:35:07] he will raise up a standard against it
[1:35:10] he's calling us Brothers to be that
[1:35:14] standard
[1:35:15] he wants us to be the standard for the
[1:35:18] world to be able to see what headship is
[1:35:21] supposed to look like
[1:35:23] [Applause]
[1:35:25] now I'm sure you guys have heard these
[1:35:28] statistics before
[1:35:30] and I use these a lot and I heard them
[1:35:32] from this man right here
[1:35:36] statistics
[1:35:39] Nationwide statistic this is not a
[1:35:42] message statistic this is Nationwide
[1:35:44] you have a family that's not going to
[1:35:46] church and a child decides to start
[1:35:47] going to church out of that family three
[1:35:50] and a half percent chance that the
[1:35:52] family
[1:35:52] will follow that child all right
[1:35:55] same family
[1:35:57] the wife mother decides to start going
[1:36:00] to church
[1:36:01] it's a 17 chance that that family will
[1:36:05] follow
[1:36:06] right but if the father of that same
[1:36:09] family
[1:36:10] starts going to church there's a 93
[1:36:14] chance
[1:36:16] that that family is going to follow you
[1:36:19] so Brothers
[1:36:20] if you decide you're going to sit at
[1:36:22] home on Sunday if you decide you're not
[1:36:25] going to read your Bible you're not
[1:36:27] going to pray
[1:36:29] there's a 93 chance that family is going
[1:36:31] to follow that but if you decide you're
[1:36:34] going to go to church you're going to
[1:36:36] pray you're going to do devotions with
[1:36:37] your family there's a 93 chance that
[1:36:41] family is going to follow you
[1:36:44] my Lord amen
[1:36:47] so no matter how much Society is trying
[1:36:51] to say this is wrong
[1:36:54] those statistics don't lie
[1:36:57] that Gap is enormous on the difference
[1:37:01] between even the wife and the husband
[1:37:03] we're needing some men to stand up and
[1:37:07] say I will not bow down to this feminist
[1:37:10] demon I'm not gonna back off because it
[1:37:14] was not so from the beginning
[1:37:21] so if you're not leading your family in
[1:37:24] the way that you should
[1:37:27] I ask a question why
[1:37:32] is it because
[1:37:34] you've let something go on for too long
[1:37:37] you don't know how to Reign it back in
[1:37:41] or are you living a lifestyle
[1:37:45] that you don't want to change
[1:37:49] if it's that first one
[1:37:52] I urge you
[1:37:54] to get on your knees and ask him for
[1:37:56] help
[1:37:57] he will help
[1:38:02] if you try to tell me he won't you came
[1:38:05] too late
[1:38:07] when we started coming back to church I
[1:38:10] found myself in this exact situation
[1:38:13] my wife's closet my girl's closets were
[1:38:15] full of clothes that I bought them
[1:38:18] that were not appropriate
[1:38:21] how am I going to walk into that closet
[1:38:24] and clean it all out how am I going to
[1:38:26] tell them now you can't wear that
[1:38:27] fingernail polish
[1:38:29] how
[1:38:31] they didn't have any respect for me
[1:38:32] before that how are they going to
[1:38:34] respect me after that so what did I do I
[1:38:36] got on my knees and I said Lord
[1:38:41] I said you gave them to me and I did not
[1:38:44] do my job
[1:38:46] I need you to do it
[1:38:48] and I stood back and I watched as he
[1:38:52] started changing them
[1:38:55] the clothes started changing
[1:38:59] the way they were acting started
[1:39:01] changing it wasn't me
[1:39:03] I was doing my part I was trying to lead
[1:39:06] I was Lee I was following him
[1:39:10] and he just let them follow right on
[1:39:12] behind me
[1:39:13] so if you're in that situation don't
[1:39:16] tell me that prayer don't change things
[1:39:17] you came too late
[1:39:21] now if you're leading your family in a
[1:39:25] way just because of a lifestyle
[1:39:27] shame on you
[1:39:30] I urge you I beg you
[1:39:34] to start a relationship with him
[1:39:37] Because unless you change what's
[1:39:40] happening
[1:39:41] there's a 93 percent chance at follow
[1:39:43] that family will follow you straight to
[1:39:46] hell
[1:39:51] no pressure gentlemen
[1:39:53] but brother that's headship
[1:39:57] so I urge you grab your families
[1:40:01] lead them
[1:40:03] but lead them the way Christ leads you
[1:40:06] with love
[1:40:11] [Applause]
[1:40:16] let's get back to the markers here so
[1:40:18] headship has developed
[1:40:21] maybe the next one
[1:40:22] you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:40:24] it's a big marker right here
[1:40:27] how do I know I have the Holy Ghost
[1:40:30] well
[1:40:31] your fruits will show
[1:40:34] you'll have a desire to go to church
[1:40:38] you'll have a desire to fellowship with
[1:40:40] other believers
[1:40:44] I'm gonna tell you another story
[1:40:49] it was a few months after I received the
[1:40:50] Holy Ghost
[1:40:53] Sarah and I
[1:40:55] took a trip for our anniversary and we
[1:40:57] went to San Antonio Texas
[1:40:59] we were staying on the the Riverwalk
[1:41:03] the last night that we were there
[1:41:05] now I've never been a big drinker in my
[1:41:08] entire life
[1:41:09] but the last night we were there we
[1:41:11] stopped at this I think it was a British
[1:41:13] restaurant or something we're sitting
[1:41:14] outside the rivers literally I mean
[1:41:17] right here beside us beautiful night
[1:41:20] they sit down a menu I look down
[1:41:23] one of my favorite drinks
[1:41:26] I think it was a what was a passion
[1:41:28] fruit daiquiri
[1:41:31] oh man that looks good
[1:41:35] it's like you know what
[1:41:36] ain't nobody around here nobody knows me
[1:41:39] around here
[1:41:41] remember I said I had the Holy Ghost and
[1:41:44] I did
[1:41:45] I know when I received it because I can
[1:41:48] point back to that time
[1:41:51] I said I'm gonna order one
[1:41:53] I ordered that drink
[1:41:55] he set that drink down
[1:41:57] I looked at the drink I looked at my
[1:41:59] wife I looked at the drink I looked back
[1:42:02] over at her
[1:42:03] and I said I cannot believe the
[1:42:07] conviction that I'm feeling right now
[1:42:11] did that mean that I couldn't pick that
[1:42:14] drink up and drink it absolutely not but
[1:42:16] there was something inside of me saying
[1:42:19] don't do it my son
[1:42:22] don't do it now you might run straight
[1:42:26] through that and do it anyways but
[1:42:28] there's something inside there it's not
[1:42:30] up here it's not a thing saying mom and
[1:42:32] dad said don't do this or the preacher
[1:42:35] said don't do this or brother Branham
[1:42:37] said don't do this there's something in
[1:42:39] here saying son don't do this
[1:42:44] that is what the Holy Ghost is
[1:42:55] read you another quote 1960 hear ye him
[1:42:59] I want to sir I want to see the Church
[1:43:02] of God in deep sincerity I want to see
[1:43:05] the old-fashioned prayer meetings I want
[1:43:07] to see them times when they can't leave
[1:43:09] church they just stay all night and pray
[1:43:12] and fast and call out to God until God
[1:43:15] answers
[1:43:16] instead of that it seems like love has
[1:43:19] dwindled away from us the love of God
[1:43:21] just love why a real Christian can
[1:43:24] hardly wait when the bell rings he's at
[1:43:27] the front seat
[1:43:28] and they're ready with a song book in
[1:43:31] his hand
[1:43:32] but now we say oh my I don't know
[1:43:35] oh blessed be the tithe that binds our
[1:43:38] hearts in Christian love
[1:43:40] The Fellowship of Kindred Minds is like
[1:43:43] to that above when we Ascender apart it
[1:43:47] gives us inward pain
[1:43:49] but we shall still be joined in heart
[1:43:51] and hope to meet again
[1:43:54] that's the way real Christianity is a
[1:43:58] living experience Pentecost is not a
[1:44:01] denomination Pentecost is an experience
[1:44:03] that everybody can have if they wish to
[1:44:06] have it it's something you experience
[1:44:09] the Holy Spirit
[1:44:11] you want to know what the Holy Ghost is
[1:44:13] that's a real good place to start
[1:44:16] do you have a desire to go to church do
[1:44:19] you have a desire to fellowship with
[1:44:22] other believers and not my worldly
[1:44:25] friends
[1:44:28] so after you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:44:32] your plan might change
[1:44:35] because another good marker for the Holy
[1:44:38] Ghost you will develop a burden for your
[1:44:40] brothers and sisters
[1:44:42] it will come
[1:44:46] so
[1:44:47] I've received the Holy Ghost my plan
[1:44:49] changes a little bit
[1:44:52] and I'm gonna start exercising this plan
[1:44:56] but now you've really caught the eye of
[1:44:57] somebody
[1:44:59] Satan
[1:45:01] it's a famous heavyweight fighter by the
[1:45:04] name of Mike Tyson
[1:45:06] sure most of you know who that is
[1:45:09] my opinion one of not the but one of the
[1:45:12] greatest heavyweight champions of all
[1:45:14] time
[1:45:15] tremendous hands be tremendous power in
[1:45:19] his punches
[1:45:21] most of the fighters he fought were beat
[1:45:23] before they ever got in the ring because
[1:45:25] they were scared to death of him
[1:45:27] that's something to think about right
[1:45:29] there
[1:45:31] Mike Tyson was had was was had an
[1:45:34] opponent they asked his opponent how are
[1:45:36] you going to beat him what are you going
[1:45:37] to do the man said I've got a plan I
[1:45:40] know how I'm going to beat this man
[1:45:42] they go to Mike Tyson
[1:45:44] they say what do you think about this
[1:45:45] this man says he's got a plan Mike Tyson
[1:45:47] says Everybody's Got A Plan until they
[1:45:49] get hit
[1:45:52] you get the Holy Ghost
[1:45:53] he starts coming you're gonna get hit
[1:45:57] but stick to the plan
[1:46:00] keep moving forward
[1:46:05] hit another marker all sudden I realized
[1:46:07] man
[1:46:08] brother Jack I'm a Child of God
[1:46:11] this is big
[1:46:12] there's people that go a long time that
[1:46:16] they do this this Revelation does not
[1:46:19] hit them this is a revelation
[1:46:22] that'll make you want to swing from the
[1:46:24] rafters
[1:46:26] when you realize I am a child of God
[1:46:30] that is huge
[1:46:32] but again
[1:46:34] this is when Satan
[1:46:36] is really going to start coming
[1:46:39] who's the biggest man in this room
[1:46:43] I see somebody pointing brother Troy
[1:46:45] over here
[1:46:46] brother Smiley brother smiley
[1:46:49] where's brother Smiley at where is it oh
[1:46:52] he I don't think he's pointing at
[1:46:53] somebody else where
[1:46:55] give me a big guy some a big guy come up
[1:46:57] here
[1:47:00] there we go
[1:47:02] there we go
[1:47:12] hey get you stand right here
[1:47:17] so
[1:47:19] you start hitting these markers
[1:47:21] Satan starts seeing seeing this he
[1:47:24] starts seeing this movement
[1:47:25] he's coming
[1:47:27] now me standing here next to this my big
[1:47:30] brother here
[1:47:33] you know you would when you think about
[1:47:36] this which one would be Satan which one
[1:47:39] would be the child of God
[1:47:41] his brother Brown talks about this in a
[1:47:43] story as man had a dream every time he
[1:47:45] said boo the devil just kept getting
[1:47:47] smaller so we're gonna go with I'm Satan
[1:47:49] this is the child of God
[1:47:52] but as we're starting our journey
[1:47:55] okay you have your hands behind your
[1:47:56] back our hands are tied
[1:47:59] our feet are tied
[1:48:01] we're blinded
[1:48:03] this is our we don't know anything yet
[1:48:05] we are just starting our journey
[1:48:09] Satan comes to attack I mean this is
[1:48:11] easy I mean as big as this man is right
[1:48:13] here if he has a blindfold on his hands
[1:48:15] are tied and his feet are tied I like my
[1:48:17] odds okay I like my odds
[1:48:21] but you start
[1:48:23] that Journey you start taking a few
[1:48:25] steps John 16 13 how be it when the he
[1:48:29] the spirit of Truth has come he will
[1:48:31] guide you into all Truth for he shall
[1:48:34] not speak of himself but whosoever he
[1:48:36] shall hear that shall he speak and he
[1:48:40] will show you things to come
[1:48:42] so he starts reading some scripture he
[1:48:45] starts reading some Bible he starts
[1:48:46] moving a little bit and all of a sudden
[1:48:48] the blindfold comes off
[1:48:50] now you can see okay
[1:48:52] me being Satan I'm still as big as this
[1:48:55] man is
[1:48:56] his hands are still tied his feet are
[1:48:59] still tied I still like my odds against
[1:49:01] this guy
[1:49:03] he keeps going though John 8 32 and ye
[1:49:05] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[1:49:08] make you free
[1:49:10] James 4 7 submit yourselves therefore to
[1:49:12] God resist the devil and he will flee
[1:49:15] from you
[1:49:16] so he starts getting more and more into
[1:49:18] the word all of a sudden his hands pop
[1:49:21] open
[1:49:22] his feet pop open
[1:49:26] all of a sudden he gets a sword
[1:49:28] in one hand anybody got a message book
[1:49:30] he gets a message book in the other one
[1:49:32] now he's got a sword and a shield
[1:49:35] now I'm Satan looking at this
[1:49:37] I don't like mods so much anymore
[1:49:40] I'm thinking I might be able to attack
[1:49:42] this man but he's got a sword shield he
[1:49:44] sees what's coming I may attack I might
[1:49:47] slow him down a little bit but he's
[1:49:49] gonna win this battle
[1:49:50] [Applause]
[1:49:52] amen
[1:49:55] [Applause]
[1:50:00] so now he's he's got this sword he's got
[1:50:02] this Shield he's got him up he's ready
[1:50:04] to fight
[1:50:05] here we go there we go
[1:50:10] he's ready to fight
[1:50:12] but when he gets comfortable
[1:50:15] he's got that sword he's got that Shield
[1:50:17] he's ready to fight but he gets
[1:50:19] comfortable and he starts relaxing a
[1:50:20] little bit
[1:50:22] he starts dropping it down a little bit
[1:50:24] letting that guard down
[1:50:31] thank you brother
[1:50:37] [Applause]
[1:50:38] so my brother starts to relax a little
[1:50:41] bit
[1:50:42] the guard starts to drop
[1:50:46] and Satan comes
[1:50:49] and he doesn't flee because that guard
[1:50:52] is down
[1:50:53] then what happens
[1:50:58] what happens
[1:51:01] like when he came
[1:51:03] to Jesus he said you're hungry
[1:51:06] there's rocks right here turn them into
[1:51:08] bread eat I know you're hungry
[1:51:12] but Christ said it is also written
[1:51:15] but what happens when you don't say
[1:51:18] it is also written
[1:51:20] what happens in those moments when you
[1:51:23] look at those rocks
[1:51:25] and you say I have the power to turn
[1:51:28] those into bread and I'm hungry
[1:51:31] and I turn them into bread and then I
[1:51:34] eat them
[1:51:35] what happens
[1:51:38] when your opponent in a fight knocks you
[1:51:41] to the ground
[1:51:42] they don't typically just turn around or
[1:51:44] walk away
[1:51:46] that's when they come
[1:51:48] that's when they're going to jump on you
[1:51:50] and they're really going to start
[1:51:51] beating on you
[1:51:53] so what do you do in that time because
[1:51:56] you're down because it was your fault
[1:51:59] that you're down you dropped the guard
[1:52:05] brother Branham said
[1:52:08] in 65 Christ is revealed in his own word
[1:52:11] I said remember Satan's got a Punch
[1:52:14] coming at you I don't care who you are
[1:52:17] he's got a right to that one punch he
[1:52:20] drops on down into that paragraph he's
[1:52:23] got a right to that open place now
[1:52:26] that's the spot you got to keep covered
[1:52:28] all the time but what happens when he
[1:52:31] hits you because you dropped your guard
[1:52:37] there's a man named Joshua
[1:52:39] that was going through a battle
[1:52:43] he was going through a trial
[1:52:45] he didn't know what to do
[1:52:47] so he dropped to his face
[1:52:50] and started to cry out
[1:52:53] Joshua 7 10 and the Lord said unto
[1:52:56] Joshua get thee up
[1:53:00] wherefore Elias thou
[1:53:02] up on thy face
[1:53:05] get thee up
[1:53:09] You Know Who You Are
[1:53:13] get up
[1:53:15] don't just lay there and let him beat
[1:53:18] you up
[1:53:19] I don't care what the reason is that
[1:53:21] you're down I don't care if it's because
[1:53:24] I Brothers I turned on the computer and
[1:53:26] I looked at something I shouldn't have
[1:53:27] looked at
[1:53:29] don't let him keep you there
[1:53:32] get up
[1:53:34] sisters I went to the store and I bought
[1:53:36] a skirt I knew it was inappropriate and
[1:53:39] I bought it anyways and then I wore it
[1:53:42] don't let him keep you there
[1:53:45] get back to your feet dust yourself off
[1:53:48] and keep moving forward
[1:53:53] [Applause]
[1:53:55] she had another marker
[1:53:58] you hit adoption
[1:54:00] the placement into the body of Christ
[1:54:04] it's another big moment
[1:54:05] now you're on fire
[1:54:07] man you are wanting to help people
[1:54:11] your plan changes again
[1:54:13] and of course that saying from Mike
[1:54:15] Tyson rears its ugly head again
[1:54:18] because he's going to keep coming
[1:54:21] just remember
[1:54:22] stick to the plan
[1:54:24] keep climbing even if it's just one
[1:54:26] little step
[1:54:28] at a time
[1:54:29] if you can go three or four steps at a
[1:54:31] time wonderful but if it's one step keep
[1:54:34] moving forward
[1:54:36] remember there's going to be other
[1:54:38] Climbers on this climb with you
[1:54:41] there's going to be ones that are moving
[1:54:43] slower if you can stop and encourage
[1:54:45] them do so this is what we should be
[1:54:48] doing for each other is encouraging each
[1:54:50] other
[1:54:51] if you can get down on your knees and
[1:54:53] reach down and help somebody up but
[1:54:56] never back up for somebody
[1:54:59] they will drag you down
[1:55:02] keep moving forward
[1:55:05] there's going to be ones that are moving
[1:55:07] faster I was just talking to brother
[1:55:09] Jack about this in my walk the ones that
[1:55:11] are moving fast I've wore brother Trevor
[1:55:13] Eamon out asking that man questions
[1:55:16] because I need help I've text Brother
[1:55:19] Jack brother Jack what do you think
[1:55:21] about this use those people that are in
[1:55:23] front of you don't be afraid of them use
[1:55:27] them the same will tell Satan's going to
[1:55:28] try to tell you no don't don't bother
[1:55:31] them they're they're too they're too
[1:55:33] holy for you no
[1:55:35] if they've got the Holy Ghost they're
[1:55:36] going to want to help you use that
[1:55:40] watch out for those ones that are
[1:55:42] falling
[1:55:43] as they're coming down they're trying to
[1:55:46] grab everybody that they can to take
[1:55:47] with them
[1:55:49] when you Google William Branham
[1:55:51] the voice of God or the Brenham
[1:55:53] Tabernacle that's not what's going to
[1:55:54] pop up
[1:55:55] it's going to be something on there
[1:55:57] about how you should you know leave the
[1:55:59] message and why you should leave the
[1:56:00] message because somebody has fallen and
[1:56:03] now they're trying to grab as many as
[1:56:04] they can to take with them
[1:56:06] watch out for them
[1:56:10] be careful those ones that might be a
[1:56:12] little bit ahead of you
[1:56:14] they get that
[1:56:16] self-righteous spirit
[1:56:20] I don't know that there is any a group
[1:56:22] of people
[1:56:24] that are more judgmental than right here
[1:56:26] in our message
[1:56:28] some reason we get a little bit of 15
[1:56:31] Steps up and also we want to start
[1:56:33] judging everybody that's on that first
[1:56:34] step we all started on that first step
[1:56:39] remember that we all started in the same
[1:56:42] place that person needs help not judged
[1:56:46] yo I'm five years now a little over five
[1:56:49] years into my walk with the Lord
[1:56:51] if brother if if brother Jack would have
[1:56:54] me come preach on day one you guys would
[1:56:57] have thought he was crazy you probably
[1:56:59] would have voted him out as pastor and
[1:57:01] you should have
[1:57:03] but now five you know five and a half
[1:57:05] years in here I stand in in in and we've
[1:57:08] got a relationship you you've known me
[1:57:10] you've seen a little bit of my testimony
[1:57:14] when you look at somebody they might be
[1:57:16] on step one
[1:57:18] remember that
[1:57:21] above all
[1:57:24] be a blessing
[1:57:26] being be encouraging to others
[1:57:31] keep climbing
[1:57:33] keep moving forward
[1:57:36] I do believe that the end
[1:57:38] is closer than we think
[1:57:41] and I know there's
[1:57:43] some sitting here that are going I've
[1:57:44] heard that my whole life
[1:57:46] that the end is my dad heard that his
[1:57:49] whole life there were people in 77 that
[1:57:52] quit their jobs and everything because
[1:57:53] it was the end
[1:57:54] but yet here we are
[1:57:56] so I know there's some people that think
[1:57:58] I've got plenty of time but let me tell
[1:58:00] you there's Ripple effects to your life
[1:58:04] when you stop concentrating on where am
[1:58:07] I at my climb should I be moving forward
[1:58:10] staying where I'm at there's Ripple
[1:58:12] effects to the people around you you
[1:58:15] start living a lifestyle because I've
[1:58:17] got time to get right you start living a
[1:58:19] lifestyle maybe you're right maybe you
[1:58:22] do have time
[1:58:23] but what about this person over here
[1:58:25] that
[1:58:26] in the perfect will of the Lord you were
[1:58:29] supposed to witness to
[1:58:31] and now you're not living right
[1:58:34] and now this puts them off on some other
[1:58:36] thing now I'm not saying they won't make
[1:58:38] if they've got to see they're going to
[1:58:39] be there
[1:58:40] but did something you do just mess up
[1:58:43] them
[1:58:43] what about our kids
[1:58:46] they see a lifestyle that you are living
[1:58:49] those ripples just keep going if you
[1:58:53] don't stop it fast enough they're gonna
[1:58:55] marry someone what if they marry an
[1:58:56] unbeliever now you have grandchildren
[1:58:58] with one believer and one unbelieved
[1:59:01] parent
[1:59:02] what does that look like the ripples
[1:59:05] so I don't want to hear about I have
[1:59:08] time
[1:59:10] our walk impacts people around us
[1:59:16] and then of course brother Jonathan
[1:59:19] this climb is so hard
[1:59:22] Tell Me Something I Don't Know
[1:59:25] and I wished I could tell you that it
[1:59:27] gets easier
[1:59:29] but I can tell you just like on that
[1:59:32] trail that we were on in Gatlinburg
[1:59:35] the higher we climbed the harder it got
[1:59:39] Satan's gonna attack
[1:59:41] and he's going to keep coming
[1:59:43] and the higher you get the more he's
[1:59:46] gonna fight
[1:59:48] but the views get better and better
[1:59:52] the higher you get the more Revelation
[1:59:55] you receive the more you start saying
[1:59:57] I'm gonna lean into him
[2:00:00] because there's nothing I can do about
[2:00:01] it I ain't got no money in the bank I'm
[2:00:04] working there ain't nothing I can do
[2:00:06] about it
[2:00:07] Lord I need you Lord I'm sick I can't go
[2:00:11] to work I can't provide for my family
[2:00:13] there's there's nothing I can do about
[2:00:15] it Lord I need you
[2:00:17] the more you lean into him the more
[2:00:20] comfort you will get
[2:00:28] and my clothes was saying
[2:00:30] I'm sure there's some sitting here
[2:00:33] saying you don't know my past you don't
[2:00:35] know where I'm from you don't know the
[2:00:37] things that I've done
[2:00:39] and you're right most of you sitting
[2:00:41] here I don't know anything about you
[2:00:44] he does
[2:00:46] you're not sitting here by a coincidence
[2:00:48] don't ever let Satan tell you that you
[2:00:51] are here for a reason this reason was
[2:00:53] ordained before the foundation of the
[2:00:55] world
[2:00:58] if he's got you Satan has got you tied
[2:01:01] up and beat up and beat down with
[2:01:04] depression
[2:01:06] he said get thee up
[2:01:10] if you've got an addiction problem
[2:01:12] get the uh
[2:01:14] whatever the problem may be marital
[2:01:16] problems
[2:01:18] trying to get to closer to the Lord
[2:01:20] whatever those those times that come
[2:01:22] where you feel like he's not there he is
[2:01:24] there
[2:01:26] these trials that we go through I look
[2:01:29] back at them and I think Lord thank you
[2:01:31] thank you for each and every trial that
[2:01:34] you've given me thank you for showing me
[2:01:36] that you brought me through that trial
[2:01:40] he gets you down remember that he said
[2:01:44] get the uh
[2:01:46] and why

[2:03:25] again we love you with all we have Lord

[2:03:31] [Music]
[2:03:33] [Applause]
[2:03:38] thank you
[2:03:42] [Music]
[2:03:44] praise the Lord
[2:03:49] um
[2:03:50] I just know that we all were fed here
[2:03:52] today
[2:03:54] man we appreciate brother Jonathan and
[2:03:58] uh
[2:04:00] I remember brother Smiley told me years
[2:04:03] ago when we started out in Ministry
[2:04:05] he says God will always use ministers to
[2:04:09] come in and vindicate the things that
[2:04:13] are being told
[2:04:14] everyone brother Jonathan went into
[2:04:17] Ephesians 5 and like oh Lord that's they
[2:04:21] number God
[2:04:23] it's a difference in dictatorship and
[2:04:26] headship
[2:04:27] and uh you know he spoke to both
[2:04:30] Generations the ones that were above and
[2:04:32] the ones that were beneath and we all
[2:04:35] could take something from amen what we
[2:04:37] heard here today and
[2:04:39] one of the things that kind of came back
[2:04:42] to my mind
[2:04:43] the brother Gonzalez had come on
[2:04:48] Wednesday night and uh in his sermon he
[2:04:51] began to preach about the the Chinese
[2:04:53] bamboo tree
[2:04:55] and he said this Chinese bamboo tree
[2:04:59] when you plant it
[2:05:02] um you have to order it every day
[2:05:05] and when you're walking out and you're
[2:05:06] watering this tree to the public eye you
[2:05:09] look absolutely insane because you're
[2:05:13] ordering something that is not showing
[2:05:15] any amen growth at all it doesn't show
[2:05:19] anything but you have to Faithfully go
[2:05:22] to this spot where you where you know
[2:05:24] that you planted it and when you show up
[2:05:28] there you take water and pour it in
[2:05:30] there again the next day and you keep
[2:05:32] going every day because you know what
[2:05:33] you planted they didn't go through all
[2:05:35] the digging and all the stuff that you
[2:05:37] did so you know what you put in the
[2:05:38] ground and I went to do some research
[2:05:41] and I found out that it actually takes
[2:05:43] five years
[2:05:45] before anything begins to show
[2:05:48] but in the five years you had to be
[2:05:50] faithful to watering it
[2:05:52] Hallelujah and as brother Jonathan said
[2:05:55] you know when I would have come here
[2:05:56] five years ago and you know and brother
[2:05:58] Jack having preached you know y'all
[2:06:00] probably voted brother Jack out but five
[2:06:03] years later said when that tree finally
[2:06:05] grew in five years
[2:06:07] they said it grew I think 90 feet in
[2:06:11] about five weeks
[2:06:13] but somebody had to be faithful to the
[2:06:16] process
[2:06:17] we can't give up on nobody when they've
[2:06:20] been planted come on somebody
[2:06:25] we know what's in there we know what God
[2:06:27] has done
[2:06:28] I I tell you what this weekend I heard
[2:06:31] from God
[2:06:32] both sermons I heard from Wednesday
[2:06:34] night Friday night Sunday morning I
[2:06:39] heard from God
[2:06:40] [Music]
[2:06:44] you know I I I I I'm I'm just
[2:06:49] I was blessed that's all I could say I
[2:06:52] was absolutely blessed I know this was
[2:06:55] this was from the Lord this this this
[2:06:58] was a word from the Lord amen it was
[2:07:02] just what spirit and Truth needed
[2:07:05] amen amen amen I thank God for just the
[2:07:10] differences in the gifts that God uses
[2:07:12] and and just how they come
[2:07:16] it produces growth I just I just feel
[2:07:19] like we're gonna see a difference in
[2:07:21] some people's lives after they heard the
[2:07:23] sermon today
[2:07:25] I just believe that I believe that
[2:07:29] some things you know you know even as
[2:07:32] Pastor something some angles you might
[2:07:34] miss right so God bring another minister
[2:07:36] in with a different angle and he just
[2:07:38] hit them like hey glory to God brother
[2:07:40] there ain't nothing but the truth right
[2:07:41] there but this morning and I know not
[2:07:44] just this morning but the whole weekend
[2:07:45] I heard from God
[2:07:48] um when you're on the journey you
[2:07:50] actually have to make a decision
