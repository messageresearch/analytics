[6:00] iniquities
[6:01] that's what Grace stepped in for as the
[6:04] heaven is high above the Earth so great

[46:16] let's let's turn our bibles if you have
[46:18] your Bibles this morning
[46:21] and bring your greetings from the church
[46:23] back home
[46:25] it was always called The Church in
[46:27] Sarasota but it's really the church in
[46:29] Myakka city so amen so greetings from
[46:32] all of you and uh from them to all of
[46:35] you from the Danny and the the Saints
[46:38] there so amen so let's turn to Luke
[46:41] chapter four
[46:47] and let's look at verse 14 for our
[46:50] scripture reading this morning
[46:54] and I want to I want to take a thought
[46:57] from this
[46:58] uh power power is knowing who you are
[47:03] power is knowing who you are so I trust
[47:06] you'll be a blessing to you
[47:08] so Luke 14 let's start verse at verse
[47:11] 14. and Luke 4 14 sorry
[47:14] Jesus returned in the power of the
[47:16] spirit into Galilee and there went out a
[47:19] Fame of him through all the region round
[47:21] about and he taught in their synagogues
[47:24] being glorified of all and he came to
[47:27] Nazareth where he had been brought up
[47:29] and as his custom was he went into the
[47:32] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[47:34] up for the Reed
[47:36] and there was delivered unto him the
[47:38] book of the prophet Isaiah and he opened
[47:41] the book and when he had opened the book
[47:43] he found the place where it was written
[47:46] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[47:49] because he has anointed me to preach the
[47:52] gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[47:54] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[47:57] Deliverance to the captives and
[47:59] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[48:01] at Liberty them that are bruised to
[48:05] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[48:07] and he closed the book and he gave it
[48:10] again to the minister and sat down in
[48:13] the eyes of all them that were into
[48:14] synagogue were fastened on him
[48:18] and he began to say unto them this day
[48:22] is this scripture fulfilled in your ears
[48:25] and all bury him witness and wondered at
[48:28] the gracious Words which preceded out of
[48:31] his mouth and they said it's not this
[48:34] Joseph's son this bar has one more time
[48:38] lord we just ask now as we have read
[48:40] your Eternal Word we ask that you'll
[48:43] bless it and make it real to our hearts
[48:45] in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[48:49] you may be seated
[48:51] power is knowing who you are
[48:55] the African slave that we always talk
[48:57] about
[48:58] conducted himself as the son of a king
[49:02] because he knew who he was
[49:05] and knowing that he was a King's son
[49:09] empowered it empowered him to act
[49:13] accordingly
[49:14] amen the knowledge
[49:17] of knowing where he came from
[49:21] gave him the courage
[49:23] that he needed
[49:25] and his captivity
[49:27] and the condition he was in had nothing
[49:31] to do with who he was
[49:34] and I I think that's what we need to
[49:36] remember for ourselves
[49:38] the condition we're in
[49:40] whatever it might be has nothing nothing
[49:44] to do with Who We Are
[49:46] amen amen so as we we read uh read the
[49:51] scripture here and amen about Jesus
[49:55] and uh Jesus had just returned from
[49:58] What's called the Great temptation
[50:02] of our Lord Jesus
[50:05] and uh he returned from this and and you
[50:08] know it was a
[50:11] it was not an easy thing for the Lord
[50:14] Amen in this condition because
[50:17] you know Satan knows when to come to you
[50:21] and how to come to you
[50:24] amen he knows your weakness and when he
[50:28] came to Jesus here was when Jesus was in
[50:31] his weakest condition perhaps physically
[50:34] speaking
[50:35] because he had just come over 40 day
[50:38] fast
[50:39] so we know that no matter even though
[50:41] you are even though it was a fast unto
[50:43] the Lord you know there's you know Jesus
[50:46] had to be weak
[50:48] in his body
[50:50] you know and and when you're a weak in
[50:52] your body like that you do become weak
[50:55] in your mind
[50:56] and we understand yo of course we
[50:58] understand we all we know Jesus was God
[51:01] in flesh we understand that but we also
[51:03] know that he was a man
[51:05] and he suffered as a man he hungered as
[51:09] a man he was tempted as a man the Bible
[51:11] said he was tempted in all points like
[51:14] as we are
[51:15] so I I have to believe that Jesus in
[51:19] this condition have become weak in body
[51:22] and perhaps weakened mind
[51:24] but when he returned from this
[51:26] temptation the Bible says that he had
[51:29] returned in the power of the spirit
[51:33] amen so why because because Jesus knew
[51:37] Jesus knew who his father was
[51:41] amen
[51:42] the Temptation had nothing to do
[51:46] with his sonship
[51:48] and I I I want you to to let this sink
[51:52] into your hearts amen no matter what you
[51:55] go through it has nothing to do with who
[51:59] you are
[52:01] and the temptation of Jesus had nothing
[52:04] to do with his sonship as a matter of
[52:07] fact it only proved his sonship
[52:11] amen so the Bible says that Jesus
[52:13] returned in the power of the spirit into
[52:16] Galilee amen because you know the reason
[52:20] he returned was because he returned in
[52:23] power was because he knew who his father
[52:27] was
[52:29] and I want to say that there is nothing
[52:31] that the devil can do
[52:33] amen that would change who Jesus was
[52:37] oh Jesus is are you with me but you know
[52:41] not only does that apply to Jesus but it
[52:43] also applies to every one of you if you
[52:47] can accept it
[52:49] come on Church don't let the devil lie
[52:52] to you
[52:53] we have been taught by the word Who We
[52:56] Are
[52:58] and because we know who we are there's
[53:02] nothing the devil can do to shake us
[53:04] from that
[53:06] no temptation no trial no sickness
[53:11] not even though backsliding
[53:15] no mistakes you can make
[53:18] well change who you really are
[53:21] amen so Jesus came back amen after his
[53:25] his temptation and the Bible says the
[53:29] open he would turn back into spirit and
[53:31] as you went he went into the sin into
[53:34] the synagogue now remember this is
[53:38] this is where Jesus grew up
[53:40] he went back to the same place where he
[53:43] grew up and as his custom was
[53:45] he when the Bible says he went into the
[53:48] synagogue on the Sabbath day
[53:52] now you remember when Jesus was here
[53:55] there was not yet a resurrection
[53:58] and the Jews worship on the Sabbath
[54:01] so he went according as the custom was
[54:04] on the Sabbath day amen but we gather on
[54:08] the first day of the week because now we
[54:12] are after
[54:14] Jesus had come the resurrection to take
[54:18] place and listen the resurrection took
[54:20] place on the first day of the week
[54:23] remember Jesus went on the seventh day
[54:26] the last day but we go on the first day
[54:28] which is back to the age day which
[54:31] speaks of Eternity
[54:33] are you with me so so so Jesus went as
[54:37] their custom was but let me just say
[54:40] that today their custom of going on the
[54:44] Sabbath day is not our custom today
[54:46] because Jesus has Resurrected
[54:49] amen but when Jesus was here in this
[54:53] scripture he was not yet resurrected so
[54:55] he went to church on Saturday
[54:58] is that right so so he goes into the
[55:01] synagogue on the Sabbath day and the
[55:03] Bible said he stood up to read and and
[55:06] that was delivered unto him the book of
[55:08] the prophet Isaiah
[55:09] and Jesus is standing there now and and
[55:13] and and the Bible says when he had
[55:15] opened the book
[55:17] now aren't you glad that he opened the
[55:19] book
[55:20] Amen to us and that but when he had
[55:23] opened the book The Bible says he found
[55:26] the place where it was written
[55:31] no no I I I want you to notice amen that
[55:35] Jesus could find this specific scripture
[55:39] because he knew who his father was
[55:42] and he knew that this scripture was
[55:44] speaking of him
[55:47] so he could take the book open up the
[55:50] book and look at the scripture that was
[55:53] directly referring to himself
[55:57] and then he read the scripture the
[55:58] spirit of the Lord is upon me
[56:03] oh come on Church you think about what a
[56:07] power this was
[56:08] for the Lord himself to stand there in
[56:12] human flesh and pick up the word the
[56:15] scroll and say the spirit of the Lord is
[56:17] upon me
[56:19] amen now what about us we ought to be
[56:23] able to pick up the word and point to
[56:25] certain scriptures and say the spirit of
[56:28] the Lord is upon us
[56:30] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[56:32] because he has anointed me to preach the
[56:35] gospel
[56:37] hell my he has sent me to heal the
[56:40] brokenhearted to preach delivers to the
[56:43] captives recurring your side to the
[56:45] Blind and instead of Liberty them that
[56:46] are bruised Amen to preach the
[56:49] acceptable year of the Lord and he
[56:52] closed the book and he said and he gave
[56:54] it again to the minister and sat down
[56:58] now and then the Bible says that the
[57:00] eyes of all them that were in the
[57:02] synagogue were fastened on him and he
[57:06] began to say this day is the scripture
[57:09] fulfilled in your ears now you stop and
[57:12] think about that here because Jesus had
[57:16] been prophesied to come for years right
[57:19] the Messiah but now the Messiah is here
[57:24] and he picks up the scripture that is
[57:26] speaking of him
[57:28] and he says this day this is fulfilled
[57:33] in other words no more are you looking
[57:36] for the Messiah to come no more are you
[57:39] looking for this to happen Jesus stands
[57:42] up and he says this has happened
[57:46] Hallelujah and there comes a time for
[57:49] you and I that most of us we are looking
[57:51] back at at prophecies already fulfilled
[57:57] do you realize that a lot of the
[58:00] prophecies prophecies for the end time
[58:02] have already happened
[58:05] and we are looking back at them or we're
[58:08] looking at depression and there's still
[58:09] some of course that are the future and
[58:11] remember many of them were looking back
[58:13] and we can say this day
[58:16] amen
[58:18] this scripture is fulfilled there's a
[58:21] bride on the Earth
[58:23] that's ready for a rapture
[58:26] amen
[58:28] amen I wonder
[58:30] I wonder if I would can I get a little
[58:32] more volume is is that possible or is
[58:35] that
[58:36] the only reason my we we preached a
[58:39] little longer and anticipated the preach
[58:42] last night and and the devil's always
[58:43] fighting my throat so if it doesn't
[58:46] blast your ears too much the more volume
[58:48] I have the better and if it gets too
[58:50] loud you just turn me down a little bit
[58:52] okay all right amen I want the devil to
[58:55] hear me
[58:56] Hallelujah he knows who we are he knows
[59:00] who you are but I want him to hear
[59:03] amen not only here but I want him to see
[59:06] a life in me
[59:08] amen amen so Jesus stands there and he
[59:12] says this name this scripture is
[59:14] fulfilled in your ears now uh you that
[59:18] are are familiar with the message of the
[59:21] hour
[59:22] uh you are well aware that this
[59:24] scripture and this and this happening
[59:27] right here in Luke chapter 4 has
[59:29] repeated again in this day
[59:31] how many members I believe it was the
[59:34] message birth pains
[59:36] Amen brother Brandon is is looking for
[59:39] his scripture
[59:40] and uh his wife had just given him a new
[59:44] Bible and you know what is the the pages
[59:46] stick together sometimes and so so he's
[59:49] looking for the scripture and he can't
[59:51] find the scripture and he he turns to
[59:54] the scripture he goes and and he and he
[59:57] starts reading and he says no he says
[59:59] that that doesn't sound right
[1:00:01] and then he tries again and no it
[1:00:03] doesn't sound so he turns to brother
[1:00:05] Jack Moore and he says brother jack
[1:00:07] isn't that so-and-sodian he says yes
[1:00:09] brother random he says yeah I saw it so
[1:00:11] he goes back and he turns to the Bible
[1:00:13] again he says and I always kind of
[1:00:16] chuckle but he goes yeah he says there
[1:00:18] it is all right here we are and he
[1:00:20] starts reading again he says no brother
[1:00:22] Jack that's that's not right now you
[1:00:25] know you have to remember we are looking
[1:00:27] back at that and we understand it but he
[1:00:30] didn't understand what was happening all
[1:00:32] he knew is he wasn't finding the
[1:00:34] scripture
[1:00:35] and and he came he came to the
[1:00:38] conclusion that there was a pace missing
[1:00:40] in the Bible
[1:00:41] Hallelujah but God was fulfilling his
[1:00:44] word
[1:00:45] amen and there was a Catholic priest
[1:00:47] sitting on the on on the platform I
[1:00:50] believe it was Bishop Stanley if I'm not
[1:00:52] if I'm correct and and he walks up with
[1:00:55] the book
[1:00:56] hey
[1:00:58] he has the two brother Branham and he
[1:01:00] says Be steady my son God is fixing to
[1:01:04] move he will show you wonderful things
[1:01:07] yes sir
[1:01:10] a Catholic priest
[1:01:13] what did he know about it
[1:01:15] probably nothing
[1:01:17] but he somehow something was Quicken to
[1:01:20] him so he gives the he gives the Bible
[1:01:23] the brother Branham
[1:01:24] he reads the Bible
[1:01:27] and he handed the book back to the
[1:01:29] priest
[1:01:31] now brother Bradham still didn't know
[1:01:33] what what had just happened and this is
[1:01:36] what I love about the message of the
[1:01:37] hour because brother Branham had to find
[1:01:40] his way
[1:01:41] through life and through prophecy many
[1:01:45] things you didn't know
[1:01:47] but God would lead him
[1:01:50] so after church was over
[1:01:54] as it is many times if you have children
[1:01:57] they were crying for a hamburger
[1:02:01] they were hungry
[1:02:03] you know and so
[1:02:06] he pulls oh he stops at a place to get
[1:02:08] them something to eat
[1:02:10] and as he's as he pulls over
[1:02:13] excuse me
[1:02:14] the Lord calls him over behind a car and
[1:02:18] reminds him of the scripture
[1:02:23] what was the god fulfilling his word
[1:02:28] without brother Branham even knew
[1:02:30] knowing what was happening
[1:02:33] right so then he goes back to
[1:02:35] Jeffersonville and then he preaches this
[1:02:39] day
[1:02:40] hallelujah oh what was he declaring he
[1:02:44] was making a declaration that the same
[1:02:46] Jesus that was here two thousand years
[1:02:49] ago is here right now amen fulfilling
[1:02:53] his word
[1:02:55] amen and he stood up and he read the
[1:02:58] scripture he said this name this
[1:03:01] scripture is fulfilled in your ears and
[1:03:04] I just might want to say to you if you
[1:03:06] haven't heard that tape for a while or
[1:03:08] or or or that series of take of messages
[1:03:11] you ought to go back and listen to it
[1:03:13] again it was a powerful
[1:03:16] powerful this day this scripture is
[1:03:19] fulfilled and my my my wife's
[1:03:22] grandmother was into in those services
[1:03:24] and she said it was such a power
[1:03:27] she said we literally would have done
[1:03:30] anything he said
[1:03:32] if he would have said get down on the
[1:03:34] floor and roll down the aisle we would
[1:03:36] have done it without even question
[1:03:39] power
[1:03:40] amen power knowing who you are knowing
[1:03:44] where you are knowing you are in the
[1:03:47] scripture
[1:03:48] maybe so it was not just brother Branham
[1:03:51] standing up and saying things Jesus
[1:03:57] amen
[1:03:59] the Messiah
[1:04:00] was on the scene
[1:04:04] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[1:04:08] your ears Jesus identified himself in
[1:04:11] the scripture and this message is
[1:04:14] identified in the scripture
[1:04:17] the same Messiah that was here 2 000
[1:04:19] years ago the same Messiah is here today
[1:04:23] he showed himself through that gift of
[1:04:26] of the Prophet thank you
[1:04:29] I'm just going to take my time
[1:04:31] I just refuse
[1:04:34] to be nervous
[1:04:37] [Applause]
[1:04:41] I always feel like I gotta hurry Russian
[1:04:44] then you stumble over words and don't
[1:04:46] say things right
[1:04:49] you know we have we have all day
[1:04:53] and you know I don't know where you all
[1:04:55] live but I'm probably driving further
[1:04:57] than any of you after service amen but
[1:05:00] that's all right that's all right amen
[1:05:03] let's let's let God have his way amen
[1:05:08] Hallelujah so Jesus identified himself
[1:05:11] into scripture and the only way you can
[1:05:14] identify yourself and overcome the only
[1:05:17] way you could overcome is
[1:05:20] you overcome temptation
[1:05:22] overcome trials is to know who you are
[1:05:28] and when you know who you are
[1:05:32] you don't give up after every mistake
[1:05:34] you make come on Church the Devil beats
[1:05:38] many of you over the head oh you made a
[1:05:40] mistake you did something wrong
[1:05:42] therefore you're not a son of God no I
[1:05:45] am a Son of God I am a daughter of God
[1:05:48] amen when you know who you are you don't
[1:05:51] just give up
[1:05:52] and when you know who you are you don't
[1:05:54] have to call the pastor every time you
[1:05:56] make a mistake
[1:05:58] you know who you are you don't need to
[1:06:01] pass you to confirm Who You Are
[1:06:05] because you know what the pastor could
[1:06:07] say oh you are a son of God but you may
[1:06:09] not be
[1:06:12] I want God to confirm me
[1:06:16] God to say you're a son of God
[1:06:19] Hallelujah then when you stumble when
[1:06:22] you make a mistake and you will come on
[1:06:24] you'll make mistakes but you still know
[1:06:27] who you are it doesn't change the seed
[1:06:30] on the inside
[1:06:32] Hallelujah
[1:06:33] oh hallelujah amen I I'm gonna get into
[1:06:38] something I hope you you you'll
[1:06:40] understand where I'm going and I'm well
[1:06:43] worried about Jack would probably listen
[1:06:44] to the service to see if I preach
[1:06:45] something Falls so you stay with your
[1:06:47] pastor but I just want to say this that
[1:06:50] fleshly manifestations don't give you
[1:06:53] overcoming power
[1:06:56] are we are you with me so far amen
[1:06:59] fleshly manifestations don't give you
[1:07:01] power overcoming power
[1:07:04] right now the Bible tells us uh Jesus
[1:07:08] speaking he said blessed art thou Simon
[1:07:09] by Jonah for flesh and blood has not
[1:07:12] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[1:07:13] which is in heaven
[1:07:15] and I say unto thee also unto thee that
[1:07:17] thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll
[1:07:19] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[1:07:22] shall not Prevail against it amen so
[1:07:25] Satan cannot move you from that
[1:07:29] Revelation you are built on the Rock and
[1:07:32] Satan cannot move you amen but if your
[1:07:36] faith now listen to me if your faith is
[1:07:39] in how you feel you can be moved from
[1:07:42] that
[1:07:44] feelings will lie to you every time
[1:07:48] amen feelings don't have holding power
[1:07:51] because feelings are not lasting
[1:07:56] oh come on Church
[1:07:58] amen feelings don't last
[1:08:01] amen we could talk about anything in
[1:08:03] life anything that gives you a feeling
[1:08:05] it doesn't last that's why people that
[1:08:08] have to drink and take drugs and all
[1:08:10] these things it doesn't last
[1:08:12] that's what I have to keep taking them
[1:08:14] to have the same feeling
[1:08:17] because they're living that feeling but
[1:08:20] when God gives you the drug off the lily
[1:08:23] of the valley you don't have to keep
[1:08:25] coming back and get the same drug
[1:08:29] hallelujah amen because it lasts
[1:08:33] amen and you're not depending on that
[1:08:36] feeling
[1:08:38] you're depending on what God said you
[1:08:40] are
[1:08:41] oh Hallelujah hey man I'm gonna read
[1:08:45] something here out of the message the
[1:08:47] unchangeable word of God in 1960 brother
[1:08:49] Branham said now look he says a while
[1:08:53] ago when the Holy Spirit was falling he
[1:08:56] said that was the blessings of the Lord
[1:08:58] he said now he says this that you see
[1:09:02] operating this way is the power of the
[1:09:05] Lord he's talking about the discernment
[1:09:07] right he says he said that's the
[1:09:10] blessings now he says don't get
[1:09:12] blessings and power mixed up
[1:09:16] I hope you hear what he said don't get
[1:09:18] blessing and power mixed up you can have
[1:09:22] a blessing and not power enough to cure
[1:09:24] a toothache but power of the Lord is to
[1:09:28] manifest God
[1:09:31] and you know to manifest God is more
[1:09:34] than just
[1:09:35] an expression or an emotion or whatever
[1:09:38] right you know uh another place here
[1:09:43] 1958 he says I I just wish I had some
[1:09:46] vocabulary to explain this he's he's
[1:09:49] into no just so you know he's in the
[1:09:52] line of discernment now
[1:09:54] yo and the angel has come
[1:09:57] if you hear the tapes well nobody hears
[1:10:00] tapes anymore I guess but you know when
[1:10:02] you hear the service you know you can
[1:10:04] tell by when you're listening you can
[1:10:07] tell when that angel comes in and when
[1:10:10] that angel came in
[1:10:12] there was no doubt in brother Brandon's
[1:10:15] mind what was happening he had complete
[1:10:18] control so he says I can't explain it
[1:10:21] there's nothing can do it he says every
[1:10:23] person in here is under my control
[1:10:27] now if you're not familiar with the
[1:10:29] message you know that that might stumble
[1:10:31] you but he's not talking about
[1:10:33] necessarily under his control but under
[1:10:35] the control of the holy spirit that is
[1:10:38] in him right amen every person in here
[1:10:43] is under my control that's right now he
[1:10:46] said this is a very strange statement he
[1:10:48] could die he says the holy spirit is
[1:10:50] here the anointing it doesn't make me
[1:10:54] jump up and scream that's the blessings
[1:10:57] of the Lord
[1:10:58] now listen I believe in jumping up and
[1:11:02] screaming whatever whatever the spirit
[1:11:03] moves you do so don't go home and say
[1:11:05] well brother Bill you know yeah man so
[1:11:07] but but that's the blessings of the Lord
[1:11:11] amen we should rejoice
[1:11:13] amen but but he he says when the
[1:11:17] anointing he says the anointing is here
[1:11:19] the holy spirit is here and he said it
[1:11:21] doesn't make me jump up and scream
[1:11:25] it was a power all right and then he
[1:11:29] goes on he says a lot of times your
[1:11:31] Pentecostal people gets fooled by that
[1:11:33] he said Jesus had the greatest anointing
[1:11:36] of any man
[1:11:37] and he read a scripture just as I have
[1:11:40] read now and he said this day
[1:11:43] this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes
[1:11:46] and what did he do he read the scripture
[1:11:49] he never run over the place he sat down
[1:11:52] in Precious words proceeded
[1:11:55] from his mouth now if I read the
[1:11:57] scripture and I'll go back here
[1:11:59] and I sit down
[1:12:01] and start preaching to you
[1:12:03] you're gonna say oh boy
[1:12:05] he is so boring
[1:12:09] foreign
[1:12:14] we misunderstand what power is
[1:12:18] you know and we all believe in the in
[1:12:21] we all believe in in the emotion all I'm
[1:12:25] trying to say today is don't trust the
[1:12:27] emotion
[1:12:28] Hallelujah Amy had the greatest
[1:12:31] anointing that ever was because the
[1:12:32] scripture said it and it goes on down
[1:12:34] you know and so on so because he said he
[1:12:37] had power to heal the sick and all this
[1:12:38] but that was the greatest anointing when
[1:12:42] Jesus Took the word he stood up read the
[1:12:45] scripture close the book gave it back to
[1:12:48] the man and went and sat down and
[1:12:50] gracious words proceeded out of his
[1:12:52] mouth
[1:12:53] and they all wondered what school what
[1:12:56] about the greatest word right
[1:12:59] they were amazed
[1:13:01] and brother Brandon said that was the
[1:13:03] greatest power that a man ever had the
[1:13:06] greatest anointing he said in one place
[1:13:08] the greatest anointing was when Jesus
[1:13:11] did that
[1:13:13] hallelujah
[1:13:14] oh my right because it was it was power
[1:13:18] because he was the one reading what
[1:13:22] applied to himself
[1:13:25] that's right amen he was reading what
[1:13:29] applied to himself he made the word that
[1:13:32] was spoken he made that word live
[1:13:36] because he knew he was that one
[1:13:40] oh I tell you when you know who you are
[1:13:42] the devil can do nothing he can't do
[1:13:45] nothing with you that right
[1:13:47] he knew he knew he was the one now
[1:13:51] let's turn our Bibles to Ephesians
[1:13:53] chapter one just for a minute I want to
[1:13:55] read something that applies to us
[1:13:57] that was Jesus but what about you
[1:14:02] amen we are included
[1:14:05] amen uh Ephesians 1 3 the Bible said
[1:14:10] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:14:12] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[1:14:13] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[1:14:15] places in Christ according as he has
[1:14:18] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:14:21] of the world that we
[1:14:24] let's say we
[1:14:26] we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:14:30] before him in love
[1:14:33] now I don't care how you feel this
[1:14:37] morning
[1:14:38] we may not feel holy we may not feel
[1:14:41] without blame but the Bible says we are
[1:14:45] that's why we can't trust in feeling you
[1:14:47] might have come to church today not
[1:14:49] feeling like a Christian I don't know
[1:14:51] but it has nothing to do with what the
[1:14:54] Bible says we should be holy and Without
[1:14:57] Blame before him in love
[1:15:00] Hallelujah so I'm going to take what the
[1:15:03] Bible says and not what I think
[1:15:05] are not what I feel
[1:15:08] amen having predestined us unto the
[1:15:11] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:15:14] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:15:16] of his will
[1:15:19] there's power knowing who you are
[1:15:21] amen Ephesians 5 26 that he might
[1:15:25] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[1:15:27] of Water by the word notice it didn't
[1:15:31] say bye the feeling
[1:15:33] washing up Water by the sensation
[1:15:36] by the word
[1:15:38] that he might present it to himself in
[1:15:41] glorious church not having spot or
[1:15:43] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:15:46] should be holy and without blemish
[1:15:49] said it twice in the book of Ephesians
[1:15:52] that we should be holy and without
[1:15:55] blemish
[1:15:56] now let me say if you have come God's
[1:16:00] provide a way you can believe that this
[1:16:02] applies to you
[1:16:05] this applies to you
[1:16:08] First Corinthians 15 51.
[1:16:11] behold I'll show you a mystery we shall
[1:16:14] not all sleep
[1:16:16] but we shall all be changed
[1:16:19] that's a promise we the Believers shall
[1:16:23] all be changed Hallelujah this is you
[1:16:29] right now let me just say this a good
[1:16:32] feeling will never give you that
[1:16:35] assurance
[1:16:38] amen a good feeling will never give you
[1:16:41] that Assurance you could have a good
[1:16:44] feeling and be lost
[1:16:47] all right right you can have a good
[1:16:50] feeling and be lost but you can have a
[1:16:53] bad feeling and be saved
[1:16:56] Hallelujah oh you got a good feeling and
[1:17:00] be lost but you could have a bad feeling
[1:17:02] and be saved
[1:17:04] Hallelujah
[1:17:05] amen you believe that
[1:17:07] amen we don't trust I don't trust my
[1:17:10] feelings
[1:17:11] if I trust my my feelings I would be
[1:17:15] very discouraged sometimes I'll just be
[1:17:19] honest be very discouraged but I don't
[1:17:21] trust my feelings because they will lie
[1:17:24] to me every time
[1:17:26] your feelings will disappoint you every
[1:17:28] time
[1:17:30] now
[1:17:32] I'm gonna
[1:17:33] make a little turn here and go to
[1:17:35] Hebrews 6.
[1:17:37] Hallelujah everybody doing all right
[1:17:40] Hallelujah
[1:17:41] amen
[1:17:43] Hebrews 6
[1:17:46] verse 4 it is impossible for those who
[1:17:48] are once enlightened and have tasted up
[1:17:50] the Heavenly gift and were made
[1:17:51] partakers of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:54] and have tasted the good word of God and
[1:17:57] the powers of the world to come if they
[1:17:59] shall fall away to renew them again into
[1:18:01] repentance seeing They Crucified them to
[1:18:04] themselves the Son of God are fresh and
[1:18:06] put him to an open shame
[1:18:07] for the Earth which strength in the rain
[1:18:11] that comes off the Bonnet and bring us
[1:18:13] forth herbs meat for them by whom it is
[1:18:15] dressed receive his blessing from God
[1:18:19] watch the next verse but that which
[1:18:22] Bears thorns and Briars is rejected and
[1:18:26] is nigh under cursing whose end is to be
[1:18:30] burnt
[1:18:31] so there there there is a a seed there
[1:18:37] is a seed that receives blessing but the
[1:18:40] end of that seed is burnt
[1:18:43] are you with me
[1:18:45] amen why the rain that is sent to form
[1:18:49] the wheat
[1:18:50] also grows the weeds and the thistles
[1:18:54] and the thorns and whatever it is right
[1:18:57] the same rain
[1:19:00] now and we're just going to slow down a
[1:19:02] little bit and let that rain soak in
[1:19:04] okay and in the same rain that Waters
[1:19:07] the wheat Waters the weeds also
[1:19:10] and even though both of them will
[1:19:13] receive blessings of the rain
[1:19:16] and they do everything that's out of the
[1:19:18] field will receive blessing from the
[1:19:20] rain
[1:19:21] right
[1:19:22] amen
[1:19:24] the end in their end of the weeds and
[1:19:27] Thorns amen they are burnt
[1:19:30] even though they rejoiced even though
[1:19:33] they received the blessing
[1:19:35] let me just say once God opens your eyes
[1:19:38] to this
[1:19:40] it will clear out a lot of questions for
[1:19:43] you it will answer the question that you
[1:19:47] have about you know well so and so
[1:19:49] you're prophesied and so as though it
[1:19:52] hit Miracles but they weren't living
[1:19:53] right
[1:19:55] when you understand this you won't
[1:19:58] question anymore you will wonder how how
[1:20:00] they did it because listen the church
[1:20:03] world gets results
[1:20:07] there's many people out there pray for
[1:20:09] the sick they see miracles
[1:20:12] right they get results they're they are
[1:20:15] receiving blessing from the rain they're
[1:20:18] anointed
[1:20:19] with the true Holy Spirit
[1:20:23] come on Amen it's not a different rain
[1:20:26] that falls under wheat and weeds it's
[1:20:29] the same rain and the same Holy Spirit
[1:20:32] can fall in the meeting today and there
[1:20:35] could be a wheat and there could be a
[1:20:36] weed but it's the same spirit that will
[1:20:40] fall down and both of them can react to
[1:20:43] it
[1:20:45] is that right
[1:20:46] amen
[1:20:47] amen oh I tell you when when God opens
[1:20:50] your eyes today as you'll understand why
[1:20:52] you can't trust emotion as your evidence
[1:20:56] amen you have to know
[1:20:59] you have to know that you are of the
[1:21:01] right seed
[1:21:03] because the seed is what makes the
[1:21:06] difference
[1:21:07] not you as a person you're just a person
[1:21:10] like anybody else but the seed makes the
[1:21:14] difference
[1:21:17] when Jesus was here he had a he had a
[1:21:20] very hard time with the Pharisees and
[1:21:22] the Sadducees
[1:21:24] and he was trying to get them to see who
[1:21:27] he was because but remember they they
[1:21:29] also had claim to Abraham as their
[1:21:32] father
[1:21:34] and they let him know
[1:21:37] that Abraham was their father
[1:21:39] everybody told them you know
[1:21:43] you know you you claim Abraham to be
[1:21:45] your father but you seek to kill me
[1:21:49] Abraham didn't do that
[1:21:51] so there were the natural seed right he
[1:21:55] says I know you're Abraham's seed
[1:21:58] but uh but you seek to kill me because
[1:22:02] now watch this you seek to kill me
[1:22:05] because my word has no place in you
[1:22:09] wow my word has no place in you that's
[1:22:14] why you try to kill me
[1:22:17] you know
[1:22:18] I I just have to just speak as it comes
[1:22:22] but but listen let me just say I I
[1:22:25] wonder sometimes when when you know when
[1:22:28] people preach
[1:22:30] and they kill one another over the
[1:22:32] pulpit
[1:22:34] there's something wrong there's
[1:22:37] something wrong with that
[1:22:38] is it because the word has no place in
[1:22:40] them I don't know I'm not the judge
[1:22:43] you you understand because Jesus could
[1:22:46] know and he said my word had no place in
[1:22:49] you that's why you're trying to kill me
[1:22:51] and if we're trying to kill one
[1:22:54] another's influence as a wrong spirit
[1:22:57] Hallelujah yeah we might not kill one
[1:23:01] another physically but we kill your
[1:23:03] influence
[1:23:05] amen
[1:23:06] amen it's a dangerous thing
[1:23:09] amen I speak that which I have seen with
[1:23:12] my father
[1:23:13] that's why I said the seed is what makes
[1:23:16] the difference I speak that which I have
[1:23:19] seen with my father and you do that
[1:23:22] which you have seen with your father
[1:23:25] okay okay hey
[1:23:27] and people don't believe in serpent seed
[1:23:30] don't believe in the seed lines Jesus
[1:23:33] believed it and he let them know he told
[1:23:36] the right straight to their face you're
[1:23:37] at the same seed line I am
[1:23:40] because you're seeking to please your
[1:23:42] father and I'm pleasing my father
[1:23:45] amen so Jesus and the religious people
[1:23:49] had different fathers
[1:23:51] amen now I know we're talking to two
[1:23:54] thousand years ago but let's let's
[1:23:57] bring it in your mind up to today
[1:24:00] amen so
[1:24:02] Amen brother Brandon said both prayed
[1:24:05] he's talking about Hebrews 6 both prayed
[1:24:07] both received help from God for he
[1:24:10] makers his son and Reign to fall on both
[1:24:12] Good and Evil
[1:24:14] and though they both had the same
[1:24:17] wonderful blessing and both had the same
[1:24:19] wonderful manifestations
[1:24:22] listen to me at both at the same
[1:24:24] wonderful manifestations there was still
[1:24:27] one great difference
[1:24:29] they were of different seed
[1:24:33] Hallelujah they were a different seed
[1:24:36] even though they received the same rain
[1:24:38] the same Sun
[1:24:40] amen so this scripture is speaking
[1:24:43] clearly of different sea lines right so
[1:24:46] true power comes in knowing who you are
[1:24:50] knowing what seed is in you
[1:24:53] amen that's how Jesus could return
[1:24:57] in the power of the spirit
[1:24:59] at this great Temptation he knew he was
[1:25:01] the word
[1:25:03] and the word always defeats the devil
[1:25:07] in the true seed
[1:25:09] the true seed the word and the true seed
[1:25:11] always defeats the devil
[1:25:14] is that right
[1:25:16] amen but so many times we substitute
[1:25:20] true power for the blessings of God
[1:25:24] as I said we enjoy the blessings we want
[1:25:27] the blessings
[1:25:28] amen but what we're reading is the power
[1:25:30] of God power to overcome Satan's
[1:25:34] temptation
[1:25:35] because you could have listen you can
[1:25:38] have the blessings and you can still lie
[1:25:41] you've been at the blessings and you can
[1:25:43] still cheat
[1:25:44] you can have the blessings and you can
[1:25:46] still run around on your wife
[1:25:48] come on Church the blessings are not the
[1:25:52] power that holds you
[1:25:55] amen
[1:25:57] Hallelujah
[1:25:58] now I just want to I want to go back
[1:26:02] if you are familiar with
[1:26:04] brother Brown's first experience with
[1:26:06] the Pentecostal people because remember
[1:26:09] he was raised a Baptist
[1:26:13] he was ordained in the Baptist Church
[1:26:16] so he was very
[1:26:18] very fundamental
[1:26:20] to him it had to be the word Yo God
[1:26:23] listen God does everything was purpose
[1:26:26] he brought him up through that
[1:26:28] organization
[1:26:30] why to get the foundation of that it has
[1:26:33] to be the word or it's wrong
[1:26:36] right but there was a lot more to it
[1:26:38] than what the Baptist organization was
[1:26:41] teaching him
[1:26:42] and when they want to ordain women
[1:26:44] preachers he said no no now isn't it
[1:26:47] isn't it something that because of his
[1:26:49] Baptist background it had to be the word
[1:26:52] or nothing but yet there ordaining women
[1:26:54] preachers and he says no
[1:26:57] he says if you're going to do that he
[1:26:59] said just take my name off the book
[1:27:03] right God was training him and moving
[1:27:07] him and bringing him into a into certain
[1:27:10] conditions in certain situations because
[1:27:13] there was a message that had to be
[1:27:16] brought for you and I and that message
[1:27:19] had to be balanced
[1:27:22] able to make a perfect bride
[1:27:26] we couldn't go too far to the left and
[1:27:28] too far to the right amen we have people
[1:27:31] that if there's any emotion at all oh
[1:27:33] you are Pentecostal
[1:27:36] and then you go away the other side but
[1:27:39] let's go down the middle of the road
[1:27:41] hallelujah amen just because I get
[1:27:44] emotional don't make me a Pentecostal
[1:27:46] other than
[1:27:49] if I have the Holy Spirit it will make
[1:27:52] me a true Pentecostal not 1906
[1:27:56] Pentecostal but he a day of Pentecost
[1:27:58] Pentecostal
[1:28:00] and then that one I believe in but I
[1:28:04] don't want to go back to 1906. we're not
[1:28:07] going backward we're going forward
[1:28:09] Hallelujah the grain the grain always
[1:28:13] goes forward
[1:28:15] amen
[1:28:16] if you know anything about farming you
[1:28:19] know that when the grain comes up into
[1:28:20] husk forms around it amen the life
[1:28:23] that's in that grain it never goes back
[1:28:25] down in the in the leaves to stalk or
[1:28:27] whatever
[1:28:28] when it comes in that husk forms around
[1:28:30] it there's only one other step left
[1:28:34] it goes to the Garner
[1:28:37] amen the grain go what it's taken home
[1:28:40] it has come to maturity so we are not
[1:28:44] going back to 1906 Pentecost I want the
[1:28:47] real Pentecost
[1:28:48] and we believe in the real Pentecost
[1:28:52] so here is the prophet of God
[1:28:55] still not knowing these things
[1:28:58] but he knows that he's called for
[1:29:00] something right he knows that he's sent
[1:29:03] but he has a lot of misunderstandings
[1:29:06] and God has to teach him
[1:29:09] right so one day he's coming back from
[1:29:11] Mishawaka Indiana
[1:29:13] from a fishing trip
[1:29:16] and he's coming down the road and he
[1:29:18] sees
[1:29:19] cars sitting everywhere license plates
[1:29:23] you know stickers or whatever Jesus only
[1:29:26] Jesus name and you're all these things
[1:29:28] and he said oh my you know what is this
[1:29:30] and so so he stops
[1:29:33] he stops to see what it was now remember
[1:29:36] you have to remember he was raised very
[1:29:39] poor they had no money hardly right
[1:29:42] hardly enough to eat
[1:29:45] and he says I I went to the meeting and
[1:29:48] I saw what was happening and and you
[1:29:50] know and everybody they made him you
[1:29:52] know they made meal everybody ate there
[1:29:54] and he said of course
[1:29:56] I was welcome to eat with them he said
[1:29:59] but I wouldn't do it
[1:30:02] this might go on a different subject but
[1:30:05] but it'll be a good lesson for you he
[1:30:08] says I wouldn't eat with them because
[1:30:11] are you awake
[1:30:13] I had nothing to put in the offering
[1:30:17] some people just come to church for
[1:30:19] something to eat
[1:30:20] I'm sorry
[1:30:23] he said I wouldn't eat with them because
[1:30:26] I could I had nothing to put in the
[1:30:28] offering he said all I had was some some
[1:30:30] old you know some old dried biscuits or
[1:30:33] whatever
[1:30:34] and he said I slept in the car
[1:30:37] I ate in a car and he says I pressed my
[1:30:41] trousers in the car
[1:30:44] between the back and the seat
[1:30:46] I'm sure they were still wrinkled you
[1:30:49] can't press trousers it's not going to
[1:30:51] make it nice
[1:30:52] you know and he dressed in a t-shirt
[1:30:55] because remember he was coming from a
[1:30:58] fishing trip so he didn't have a suit
[1:30:59] probably the right cut he had a t-shirt
[1:31:05] but he wanted to know what those people
[1:31:07] had
[1:31:09] there was something burning in him
[1:31:13] so he goes in the meeting you know and
[1:31:15] and you know they had
[1:31:17] you know uh uh and they had all all the
[1:31:22] I've I believe this was the same meeting
[1:31:24] maybe I'm getting a meeting mixed up I I
[1:31:25] believe this was the same time they had
[1:31:28] all the ministers come by on the one
[1:31:29] service and just you know give the name
[1:31:31] where they're from he gets up
[1:31:34] William random Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:31:36] sit down so I know a night or two later
[1:31:40] whatever it was they they they called on
[1:31:42] him
[1:31:44] to bring your message
[1:31:47] and uh
[1:31:48] the old man the old brother I forget his
[1:31:51] name was up there and he says does
[1:31:53] anybody know what a whereabouts of
[1:31:54] William Branham
[1:31:56] he said I just started scooting down
[1:32:00] and you call it two or three times
[1:32:02] anybody know what William Branham is
[1:32:04] anybody know where abouts of him
[1:32:07] and
[1:32:08] you know finally the man sitting next to
[1:32:11] him looked over and says do you know
[1:32:12] where he is
[1:32:15] he says come here yo you see I'm he he
[1:32:20] says but I can't go up there no you know
[1:32:23] the trousers and the t-shirt and he's
[1:32:26] going up there those people don't care
[1:32:27] how you dress
[1:32:29] he said yo because his old Baptist ways
[1:32:32] all right wouldn't allow him to do that
[1:32:36] and the brother on the platformer says
[1:32:37] anybody knows whereabouts of William
[1:32:39] Brandon yo burger here he is here he is
[1:32:43] oh when God's seeking you out you cannot
[1:32:47] hide
[1:32:49] amen and that's where he got his start
[1:32:52] he preached the message got in the
[1:32:54] spirit and didn't even know what
[1:32:55] happened
[1:32:57] right and he got out and all these
[1:32:59] people standing there you know come over
[1:33:01] to my church come over here come here
[1:33:03] dude you know all these invitations oh
[1:33:05] he was so excited he goes home he tells
[1:33:08] his wife oh I met the cream of the crop
[1:33:11] I met the best thing you have ever seen
[1:33:13] look at all these invitations yo we'll
[1:33:16] go and preach for them and uh oh his
[1:33:20] father-in-law got a hold of it
[1:33:22] says you're not going to drag my wife
[1:33:24] over to that bunch of trash
[1:33:28] oh my and but you see his wife would
[1:33:31] have went with him
[1:33:33] she said bill I'll go with you
[1:33:36] no matter what my parents say but he
[1:33:38] says no it's you know he and he
[1:33:39] compromised he didn't go and you
[1:33:42] remember when the when the flood came
[1:33:44] the 1937 flood and he was stranded and
[1:33:48] stuck on an island out in the middle of
[1:33:49] a river about to die
[1:33:52] and God said you know what about that
[1:33:55] group of people you call trash
[1:33:58] can you imagine how
[1:34:03] the man that would not compromise no
[1:34:06] matter what happened and that's why he
[1:34:08] he put him through such severe trials
[1:34:11] even taking his wife and his baby
[1:34:15] teaching him a lesson that you must obey
[1:34:18] me because there was a message coming
[1:34:20] for you
[1:34:22] and then God was thinking of you in West
[1:34:25] Palm Beach and he says there's got to be
[1:34:28] a man that will not compromise that will
[1:34:30] preach the unadulterated word of God so
[1:34:34] that I can have a bride out of this part
[1:34:36] of the world for the Rapture and because
[1:34:39] of that brother Brad who had to go
[1:34:40] through all that suffering and trials
[1:34:43] so he would stay true
[1:34:47] you really think about how easy you have
[1:34:49] it
[1:34:55] first many times at home and says you
[1:34:57] know he had to go out in the woods and
[1:35:00] pray for days and sometimes weeks and
[1:35:03] whatever to get you know find out what
[1:35:05] the Lord wanted him to do
[1:35:07] find the word from the Lord you have it
[1:35:10] on your phone
[1:35:13] you don't have to go to the woods and
[1:35:15] pray to see what the Lord said now you
[1:35:18] might do that for a special occasion or
[1:35:19] something or you know but I just
[1:35:21] generally speaking you can you can get
[1:35:23] your phone out and push play or you can
[1:35:25] tell Siri to play it or Alexa whatever
[1:35:28] you know I wonder what I I've never done
[1:35:31] it maybe someone you have I wonder what
[1:35:33] Alexa would do if you say Alexa play
[1:35:35] William Branham
[1:35:37] she might say William Branham is a cult
[1:35:41] probably not but I'd have to say have
[1:35:43] you ever noticed when you're when you're
[1:35:45] when you're when you're texting and or
[1:35:46] you're typing something you got auto
[1:35:48] chat and your auto spell all that have
[1:35:50] you ever noticed that Siri is not a
[1:35:51] Christian
[1:35:59] Siri doesn't understand
[1:36:01] words and you know a phrase is that she
[1:36:04] knows nothing about when you start
[1:36:06] typing in by you know Holy Ghost Holy
[1:36:08] Spirit for the most part she can't spell
[1:36:09] it out until you finish it
[1:36:11] but if you put in a cuss words you'll
[1:36:13] get it quick
[1:36:14] [Music]
[1:36:18] and you better read it before you sent
[1:36:20] it
[1:36:23] I'm sure most of us have sent some
[1:36:25] terrible texts
[1:36:29] I'm going to tell on myself I won't tell
[1:36:31] what it was but I'm going to tell them
[1:36:32] myself I have one of these emojis
[1:36:36] that I didn't know what it meant
[1:36:38] and I was talking to brother Danny and
[1:36:40] we're talking about the taxes in the
[1:36:41] church and this that and the other and
[1:36:43] so I I sent this thing that you know
[1:36:46] had all these had this face and all this
[1:36:49] you know uh like
[1:36:51] oh yeah the sign of you know
[1:36:55] you know what I'm going dividing
[1:36:57] multiplication percentage all this stuff
[1:36:59] yo I development we're talking about
[1:37:01] money I just said
[1:37:02] [Music]
[1:37:04] but brother Danny text me back right
[1:37:06] away he says don't you send that to
[1:37:08] anybody else
[1:37:10] you know what that means I said no I
[1:37:12] don't know
[1:37:13] it says you don't know you don't want to
[1:37:16] know what that means don't you he said
[1:37:18] don't send that to all your message all
[1:37:21] your preacher friends you'll never
[1:37:23] preach anywhere else again
[1:37:25] so be careful amen when you speak your
[1:37:29] text you better go pack and read it
[1:37:31] because they don't always understand
[1:37:33] what you're saying and they will
[1:37:35] interpret what they think you're saying
[1:37:39] I texted a customer mine here not long
[1:37:42] ago about a job and trying to schedule
[1:37:45] it and and she texted me back I've known
[1:37:47] this lady for years uh a Jewish lady a
[1:37:50] very nice lady just you know almost like
[1:37:52] family and and so I I got this text back
[1:37:55] and I looked at the text and I said oh
[1:37:58] my goodness I know she didn't read this
[1:38:01] it was horrible and she texted back
[1:38:04] about it oh man I'm so embarrassed
[1:38:07] it happens I understand Siri
[1:38:11] amen
[1:38:12] she's not Siri don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:38:15] Hallelujah
[1:38:19] amen where was I I'm sorry amen so
[1:38:23] brother Branham had to go through these
[1:38:25] things and so as he's in this meeting
[1:38:28] you know the spirit is falling now you
[1:38:31] have to remember this is this was in his
[1:38:33] early early Ministry
[1:38:35] and there's a move of the spirit still
[1:38:38] in the in the end from the outpouring of
[1:38:41] 1906. right and and that was the
[1:38:45] restoring of the gifts that your uh
[1:38:48] tongues prophecy you know all these
[1:38:50] things was restored back to the church
[1:38:51] right and so so does the spirit is
[1:38:55] falling in the meeting and one brother
[1:38:59] speaks in tongues another brother
[1:39:02] interprets
[1:39:04] and brother Brandon was just thrilled
[1:39:07] he thought oh my you know he said I I
[1:39:12] thought I'd come amongst angels
[1:39:15] right he never he had never seen such a
[1:39:18] thing and so he thought well yo with
[1:39:22] with the gift I have he said I would
[1:39:23] like to just talk to these people these
[1:39:26] brothers you know I just find out you
[1:39:28] know he had a little way of talking to
[1:39:30] you and knowing who you are or what you
[1:39:32] are so he talked to the one brother and
[1:39:34] and he says a real genuine believer
[1:39:39] and so he he he uh was able to meet the
[1:39:42] next brother and he said if I ever met a
[1:39:46] hypocrite that was one of them
[1:39:49] now think about it so here he is he does
[1:39:51] he knows nothing about this yet
[1:39:54] but he but the spirit is falling they're
[1:39:57] both anointed and
[1:40:00] they were telling the truth he said
[1:40:03] there's many here to need to be at the
[1:40:06] altar I would call out certain things
[1:40:07] and the person would stand up and
[1:40:09] witness that's right
[1:40:11] so they were not they were not
[1:40:12] prophesying falsely they were actually
[1:40:15] telling something true
[1:40:17] but one was still a devil
[1:40:20] oh my amen he was one was a plot let me
[1:40:24] let me back up a little bit
[1:40:27] here I am again trying to hurry
[1:40:29] if I ever met a hypocrite that was one
[1:40:31] of them that man was actually his wife
[1:40:33] was a blind-headed woman he had children
[1:40:35] by two hey two children by a
[1:40:37] black-headed woman
[1:40:39] I thought well now what
[1:40:41] here it is I'm all mixed up
[1:40:44] I'm a fundamentalist it must be the word
[1:40:46] or it isn't right
[1:40:49] amen and there's a spirit that rang out
[1:40:51] according to all I know genuine
[1:40:54] the other one was not good at all the
[1:40:56] spirit falling on both and now it's just
[1:40:59] how can that be
[1:41:00] it had me puzzled
[1:41:03] we should have the same attitude
[1:41:05] right
[1:41:06] so now so he goes back home and and now
[1:41:09] he's all all confused
[1:41:12] he was so thrilled about what he found
[1:41:15] is oh this is the best thing ever and
[1:41:18] now he's wondering he's amongst devils
[1:41:20] and he said I want nothing to do with
[1:41:22] devils
[1:41:23] right so he goes back home and as his
[1:41:26] nature was he had to find out
[1:41:30] aren't you glad
[1:41:32] it's like shooting the gun it's got to
[1:41:34] hit the target if it's off just a little
[1:41:37] bit I'm not satisfied
[1:41:39] even the even the weather begun company
[1:41:42] told him about a certain gun said she
[1:41:46] says Mr Branham that gun will not you
[1:41:49] know do such and such he says I know
[1:41:51] better because I've done it before
[1:41:53] that's the way he was with the word I
[1:41:56] know it would hit the target it would
[1:41:58] see what in right
[1:42:00] so that was his nature so he goes home
[1:42:05] and he goes out in the woods he goes in
[1:42:07] the cave
[1:42:08] and so he's in the cave for how many
[1:42:11] days it was
[1:42:13] and finally one day he walked out
[1:42:16] of the caves like a kind of you know get
[1:42:18] some fresh airs all you know musty in
[1:42:20] there and dark and damp you know and and
[1:42:23] uh listen he he did these things because
[1:42:25] he wanted to know what the word was you
[1:42:27] ought to thank God that he was that way
[1:42:29] or you wouldn't have what you have
[1:42:32] amen and so he walks out there and God
[1:42:35] shows him a vision he saw the Earth all
[1:42:38] you know uh
[1:42:40] turning out in front of him all dished
[1:42:44] up and saw a man dressed in white going
[1:42:46] around he's scattering seeds sowing the
[1:42:49] weed and after you went around the
[1:42:51] curvature of the earth there was another
[1:42:52] man come you know it looked horrible
[1:42:54] dressed in black it was throwing weed
[1:42:56] seats all over and both come up together
[1:42:58] you all remember the story he come up
[1:43:00] together and when they did he said they
[1:43:03] both became thirsty because there was no
[1:43:04] rain everything was dry and so they were
[1:43:07] in need of rain and both of them listen
[1:43:09] both of them started crying out we need
[1:43:13] rain we need rain what are the church
[1:43:15] denominations doing today
[1:43:18] do you realize that right now there are
[1:43:21] still many Pentecostal people are
[1:43:24] calling for the spirit of Elijah
[1:43:27] they want the spirit of Elijah in their
[1:43:30] Church
[1:43:31] why they're hungering that's the day we
[1:43:34] live in right when the foolish Virgin
[1:43:36] Goes to get the oil they never got it
[1:43:40] but because while they were looking for
[1:43:43] it the bridegroom came
[1:43:46] and those that had oil in their land
[1:43:49] went in
[1:43:51] to the marriage supper is that right so
[1:43:54] they both are crying out and the rain
[1:43:56] comes and the weed stands up and
[1:43:58] rejoices praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:44:01] and we stand up next to the praise the
[1:44:03] Lord praise the Lord
[1:44:06] you know some of you might even know
[1:44:08] people like that that you wonder why
[1:44:10] they're praising the Lord because you
[1:44:11] know their life
[1:44:15] but you know we we leave it alone
[1:44:19] because God knows and God will separated
[1:44:21] when the time comes amen we just let the
[1:44:24] Spirit Fall as it wants to fall because
[1:44:26] I can benefit from it no matter what the
[1:44:28] next person does
[1:44:30] I mean so they both rejoiced
[1:44:34] the same Reigns same Sun
[1:44:39] and both of them had results
[1:44:42] but Branham said everybody can rejoice
[1:44:45] in it Hypocrites Christians all together
[1:44:47] exactly right but what is it
[1:44:50] by their fruits they are known
[1:44:55] by their fruits they are known as that's
[1:44:59] the only way we can ever know
[1:45:04] amen let's give over somebody goes over
[1:45:06] over some of that the the same things
[1:45:08] and how God has showed him that Vision
[1:45:10] but he comes on down he and he says
[1:45:12] again that that that the seed is what
[1:45:15] makes the difference
[1:45:17] amen hallelujah
[1:45:19] amen people have prophesied and
[1:45:21] prophesied true because they were in a
[1:45:23] certain office like cafes right so you
[1:45:27] can prophesy true and be a false vessel
[1:45:31] amen that's true but I want to be a true
[1:45:34] vessel don't you amen hallelujah so
[1:45:38] Jesus knew who he was the power of
[1:45:42] knowing who he was is what kept Him and
[1:45:47] caused him to fulfill
[1:45:50] what he was called for
[1:45:53] now one more thing and I'm going to
[1:45:56] bring it to a close
[1:45:58] in just a little bit
[1:45:59] The Prodigal Son
[1:46:03] we've heard the story many times
[1:46:07] him and his brother
[1:46:08] and whatever family there was
[1:46:11] the father was rich
[1:46:13] one day the one son decided you know I
[1:46:17] don't want to wait for my inheritance I
[1:46:19] want it now
[1:46:21] and the father you know being a good
[1:46:25] father no doubt the father gave it to
[1:46:28] him he divided it between the brothers
[1:46:30] and gave
[1:46:31] The Prodigal gave his portion to him
[1:46:35] and after he got the inheritance got all
[1:46:38] those things he went out
[1:46:41] he left his father's house
[1:46:44] went out into the world lived his own
[1:46:47] life and the Bible said he he wasted his
[1:46:50] substance was riotous living
[1:46:53] all kinds of immoral things and horrible
[1:46:56] things he got into listen let me tell
[1:46:58] you something young people the devil
[1:47:00] will take you further than you want to
[1:47:02] go
[1:47:03] you give him just a little bit he will
[1:47:06] take more than you'll ever get he'll
[1:47:09] take you further what's that song sin
[1:47:11] will take you further something like
[1:47:13] that I believe it goes sin will take you
[1:47:14] further than you want to go you think I
[1:47:18] want to have a little pleasure I want to
[1:47:20] have a little fun
[1:47:22] this is the best fun I could ever have
[1:47:25] right here
[1:47:27] amen amen maybe not always fun for the
[1:47:30] flesh but there's a rejoicing in the
[1:47:32] spirit
[1:47:34] Hallelujah this is our pleasure this is
[1:47:36] our fun you know fun is such a cheap
[1:47:38] word

[1:47:42] what's that this is a whole fun this is
[1:47:44] our joy this is our pleasure
[1:47:47] but the prodigal thought he could go out
[1:47:49] and you know wanted to experience the
[1:47:52] world
[1:47:53] listen
[1:47:56] I'm not young anymore
[1:47:58] I denied it for a long time but I I've
[1:48:01] kind of went beyond the point of no
[1:48:02] return
[1:48:03] so you know uh but I was young ones
[1:48:07] believe it or not I was as young as you
[1:48:10] are right now at one time
[1:48:13] I didn't come in I didn't come into this
[1:48:16] world fully grown
[1:48:18] right so I was young I know what it's
[1:48:22] like to be young I know what it's like
[1:48:24] to grow up I know what it's like to have
[1:48:27] friends that want to pull you you know
[1:48:29] the wrong ways and I also know that that
[1:48:31] as long as you have your world in nature
[1:48:33] you will always go with your friends
[1:48:36] it's a pull it's just natural you're all
[1:48:40] born in sin right so you naturally want
[1:48:43] to go that way you want to experience
[1:48:45] those things but I also would like to
[1:48:47] add to that but now listen I was young I
[1:48:52] experienced certain things but I'll tell
[1:48:54] you

[1:48:59] the devil will never tell you the real
[1:49:02] picture

[1:49:06] beautiful oh it looks so nice and all
[1:49:09] this yo look at all the Hollywood movie

[1:49:31] ugly that life is you and if you could
[1:49:34] see those evil spirits you wouldn't even

[1:50:13] purpose kill you
[1:50:15] destroy you before you could have have
[1:50:18] opportunity to accept Christ
[1:50:20] that's his goal and all these things are
[1:50:24] working into his hands
[1:50:27] oh yeah the wisdom of Cain
[1:50:31] I guarantee you Seth didn't invent
[1:50:34] Instagram
[1:50:35] or any or any such thing and if you want
[1:50:39] to be influenced let's be influenced by
[1:50:41] the Holy Spirit
[1:50:42] hey man I'm looking right now at some
[1:50:45] influencers
[1:50:47] and you look more
[1:50:54] I don't even look normal
[1:50:58] I wanna
[1:50:59] I see somebody I'm sorry I just feel
[1:51:01] free but
[1:51:03] I see some of these things and I want to
[1:51:04] say what sister what was her name uh
[1:51:08] Forney Vanessa Vanessa Vanessa whatever
[1:51:10] whatever her name is you know the jewel
[1:51:13] preached at our place one time years ago
[1:51:14] and you know and tell him about himself
[1:51:17] and he's you know standing before the
[1:51:19] mirror and flexing and doing this and yo
[1:51:21] she comes out you don't think you look
[1:51:23] good do you
[1:51:25] I tell you when I see some of these
[1:51:27] creatures out here on the on the street
[1:51:30] I wanna I wanna look at them and say you
[1:51:32] don't think you look good do you
[1:51:34] know what's what's the matter with your
[1:51:36] pants they're all ripped
[1:51:42] back home we warm did it looked like
[1:51:45] that and threw them away
[1:51:47] or mom put a patch over and we kept
[1:51:49] wearing it
[1:51:50] if I'd have known that I would have kept
[1:51:52] some of those I could have sold more a
[1:51:53] lot of money now
[1:51:56] Hallelujah the world is insane
[1:52:00] they pay hundreds of dollars for that
[1:52:02] nonsense
[1:52:04] for ripped jeans
[1:52:08] I don't understand it
[1:52:09] but it happened to the world
[1:52:12] amen
[1:52:15] it's a prodigal and listen don't don't
[1:52:18] follow that way
[1:52:20] because the Prodigal Son yo maybe he
[1:52:23] thought well I I want to experience so
[1:52:25] many things but I'm only going to go so
[1:52:27] far
[1:52:29] I've done that many of you probably done
[1:52:31] that I'm only going to do this and I'm
[1:52:33] not going to go any further the next
[1:52:36] thing you knew you were going further
[1:52:37] because there's nothing to hold you
[1:52:39] because I didn't know who I was
[1:52:41] [Applause]
[1:52:43] but once I knew who I was
[1:52:46] the devil has no more power over me and
[1:52:49] over you because you know who you are
[1:52:52] amen
[1:52:54] so The Prodigal Son
[1:52:57] kept going down down down
[1:53:02] until he listen listen where you ended
[1:53:05] up at he ended up in the pig pen foreign
[1:53:09] come on church that's where you'll end
[1:53:11] up if you leave the word if you leave
[1:53:14] Father's House you'll end up in a pig
[1:53:15] pen and the Bible says he would have
[1:53:18] been happy to eat the husks from the
[1:53:20] corn but nobody gave him
[1:53:23] that's a terrible condition
[1:53:25] how many of you know what a pig pen
[1:53:29] smells like
[1:53:33] just a few
[1:53:34] it's bad
[1:53:37] it's bad
[1:53:40] and that's where he was in the stink of
[1:53:43] a pig pen
[1:53:44] but
[1:53:47] that didn't change his position of who
[1:53:50] he was
[1:53:52] his daddy was still the same Daddy
[1:53:56] Hallelujah he was still his son
[1:54:00] and one day the Bible said he came to
[1:54:03] himself
[1:54:05] oh I hope some of you come to yourself
[1:54:08] he came to himself and he remembered
[1:54:13] oh I remember who I am I remember my
[1:54:16] daddy I remember the farm I remember
[1:54:17] where I came from oh church this morning
[1:54:21] I remember where I came from too
[1:54:23] Hallelujah I came from the mind of God
[1:54:26] and I'm going back to the mind of God
[1:54:29] Hallelujah
[1:54:31] he said oh
[1:54:33] I remember who I am
[1:54:36] I will I will go back
[1:54:39] listen that's what you have to do if you
[1:54:41] are a prodigal this morning you have to
[1:54:43] come come to yourself and tell yourself
[1:54:46] I'm going back
[1:54:48] but he realized what he'd done it and he
[1:54:51] says now and you know this is this is
[1:54:53] what Satan puts on you
[1:54:54] once you do something wrong you fall you
[1:54:57] sin you do whatever he puts a guilt trip
[1:54:59] on you so heavy to try to keep you from
[1:55:02] rising up
[1:55:04] sort of the prodigal raised up and he
[1:55:07] says I'm going back to my father's house
[1:55:09] I'm not worthy to be a son
[1:55:12] that's what he thought
[1:55:15] that's what the devil told him I'm not
[1:55:18] worthy to be a son but I'll go back and
[1:55:20] be his servant
[1:55:22] right
[1:55:23] but he was not a servant
[1:55:26] you are not a servant you are not Israel
[1:55:30] spiritually we are Israel yeah but you
[1:55:32] are Gentile and the Gentile is not a
[1:55:35] servant
[1:55:38] they're Sons
[1:55:41] Hallelujah so he goes he raises up he
[1:55:44] starts back
[1:55:46] there's a good lesson here he goes back
[1:55:50] and as he's going back now the the daddy
[1:55:53] no doubt had applied to token
[1:55:56] yes sir and no doubt he was watching for
[1:56:00] him all the time
[1:56:02] believing that one day my son is coming
[1:56:05] back
[1:56:06] right
[1:56:07] right so as the sun is is approaching to
[1:56:11] farm of course his daddy sees him
[1:56:14] oh and you're like a real father listen
[1:56:16] I don't care what your children have
[1:56:18] done
[1:56:19] they could do whatever they're still
[1:56:21] your child
[1:56:22] and as he looked out he saw his son and
[1:56:26] he ran out to meet him
[1:56:28] now think about it he came from the pig
[1:56:32] pen probably smelled like a pig looked
[1:56:35] like a pig but the daddy ran up and no
[1:56:39] not gave him a hug
[1:56:41] he didn't care what his son smelled like
[1:56:44] and God doesn't care what you smell like
[1:56:46] just come to him
[1:56:49] Hallelujah
[1:56:51] [Applause]
[1:56:53] so he embraced him
[1:56:55] but now there's another problem
[1:56:57] he had a brother
[1:56:59] that got jealous
[1:57:01] [Music]
[1:57:03] so he sees what's happening because you
[1:57:05] know the father oh this my son came home
[1:57:08] you'll kill the best calf the fat of
[1:57:10] calf make a piece he's come back and his
[1:57:13] son is looking he sees all this he says
[1:57:16] if he goes out he says Dad
[1:57:18] what's going on here
[1:57:21] you've never done such for me
[1:57:24] a jealous Spirit right you've never done
[1:57:27] such for me you never made a face you
[1:57:29] never killed if had a calf you've never
[1:57:30] done any of that stuff you're and and my
[1:57:33] brother comes home which has wasted your
[1:57:35] substance
[1:57:36] wasted your living and live with harlots
[1:57:40] drinking whatever and now you make you
[1:57:43] kill a fan of cat for him
[1:57:45] I can see him going over to your dad he
[1:57:48] said Son
[1:57:51] you must understand something
[1:57:54] you are in my house
[1:57:56] you've always been in my house you were
[1:57:59] a good tithe prayer you always came to
[1:58:02] church
[1:58:03] right you never disbelieve the message
[1:58:04] you always did what was right
[1:58:06] faithful in church
[1:58:09] you're always my son
[1:58:11] all that I have is yours
[1:58:15] he says but
[1:58:18] your brother
[1:58:21] was dead
[1:58:23] and he's alive
[1:58:26] Hallelujah that's why we made the
[1:58:28] federal Cav that's why we made the feast
[1:58:30] because he was dead in sin and trespass
[1:58:34] but he's alive now
[1:58:37] now look he was alive but he still
[1:58:40] looked the same he still looked like a
[1:58:41] pig
[1:58:43] I'm talking about when he first came
[1:58:45] smelled like a pig but as far as the
[1:58:48] daddy was concerned he was alive
[1:58:52] because it was still his son
[1:58:54] Hallelujah the pig pen couldn't change
[1:58:57] it his sonship
[1:58:59] [Applause]
[1:59:01] glory to God let me say laodicea cannot
[1:59:04] change your sonship it cannot change
[1:59:08] your citizenship Hallelujah
[1:59:10] [Music]
[1:59:13] the devil has nothing he can move you
[1:59:16] with no matter how low down you become
[1:59:19] no matter how sinful you come you are
[1:59:22] always the son or daughter
[1:59:24] and the prodigal was always still the
