[15:58] a man but I think probably I got um I
[16:06] got two testimonies that I bet I want to

[16:11] wife share and then the other out I'll
[16:13] share a man praise the lord god is good
[16:17] god is good
[16:18] [Music]
[16:20] I'll take a man we got been to goodness
[16:27] first not to say nothing
[16:54] so this year like I said it's been an
[16:58] incredible year for us
[17:01] I think the first testimony I'd like to
[17:04] share something that we were we were not
[17:07] looking for something that we were not
[17:10] expecting but the Lord blessed us with
[17:14] it anyway and I want to say it's back in
[17:19] September that this occurred we were
[17:26] were asked to be a part of a business
[17:29] opportunity here in this area and what
[17:35] has happened is that we've brother and
[17:39] sister who has a business wanted to
[17:40] expand into here in South Florida and
[17:43] they looked at the stearic and I said
[17:46] you know we would love to have you be a
[17:49] part of this business and they access to
[17:52] launch a home health care business here
[17:55] in South Florida so just a Aragon I for
[17:58] our directors of a home health care
[18:02] business here in South Florida so like I
[18:10] said wasn't something that we weren't
[18:12] really looking for but God has opened up
[18:15] this door and we're walking in with a
[18:18] man with everything we got so y'all keep
[18:21] us in prayer we want to make sure that
[18:23] it doesn't you know affect ministry in
[18:25] any way but but we felt it was an
[18:27] opportunity that we couldn't say no to
[18:29] and
[18:31] and we decided to you have to prayer we
[18:33] decided to embrace it and so God God
[18:36] blessed us with a business state man
[18:38] this year and that's that's incredible
[18:40] it named for me that's incredible
[18:52] as he said it was something that we
[18:54] weren't looking for and it was just
[18:59] amazing the way it came about apparently
[19:04] they have been watching us for a while
[19:05] and how we can't do certain things and
[19:08] and they just felt as though we would we
[19:12] would just be a perfect fit you know to
[19:15] run the business for them and the thing
[19:20] is is you know what they said to us was
[19:24] basically you know you have to kind of
[19:27] think towards the future you know he as
[19:32] the obviously as the Lord's will but you
[19:35] know he may get to some point you know
[19:38] that he you know that he needs to step
[19:40] away from the ministry and retire and
[19:44] and in doing that you know you have to
[19:47] have a plan
[19:48] I mean you know so so you know it's just
[19:52] the the business is basically came about
[19:56] as a way for us to have a plan you know
[19:58] people who have jobs you know in the
[20:02] secular working world they have 401ks
[20:04] they have IRAs they have all of these
[20:06] things but unfortunately and I wouldn't
[20:10] say unfortunately because we as he said
[20:13] that you know those are resources God is
[20:15] our source but as you step away from the
[20:19] ministry you know if the church is not
[20:22] in a position to continue you know for
[20:26] lack of a better term funding you know
[20:29] the funding the the the minister then
[20:32] you know you have to have other ways
[20:33] that you won't put a burden on the
[20:35] church and so and and so they when they
[20:39] mention that
[20:39] it's like you know what that's true I
[20:41] mean I have been thinking of different
[20:43] things you know
[20:44] you know maybe trying to fund a IRA for
[20:46] myself or a Roth or something like that
[20:48] at some point in time you know but but
[20:51] those are things that you know people
[20:53] don't really think about until you're
[20:55] there until you're you know say 75 to 80
[20:58] years old and you can never and you
[21:00] can't go go on and you know handle the
[21:03] church and you need to step down and
[21:04] allow someone else to step in you know
[21:07] at that point what happens so I thought
[21:10] that you know we need when they brought
[21:11] this I thought it that it was really a
[21:14] tremendous opportunity for us to you
[21:17] know for us to be able to kind of look
[21:20] to the future God knows I'm not looking
[21:22] to stay here none of us are but you know
[21:24] brother branham also told us that we
[21:26] just happened that weird to continue to
[21:28] you planting potatoes continue to plant
[21:30] them you know so um so those are you
[21:33] know ways and honestly we're always
[21:35] looking for a way that you know that
[21:37] that we won't be a burden you know to to
[21:40] the church so um so I just thank God for
[21:43] this opportunity and and ask for your
[21:46] prayers solicit your prayers that that
[21:48] got to lead us and guide us because
[21:50] we're learning new things and this is
[21:53] something you know we we never really
[21:54] thought about but we're you know we're
[21:56] willing to embrace it as a blessing from
[22:00] God another thing I forgot to mention
[22:02] Lord bless us with ten employees already
[22:07] [Music]
[22:10] just keep missing frame we want but
[22:12] employees to work so I keep some prayer
[22:14] but the other testimony I want to just
[22:16] share I told you all about and somebody
[22:19] else saw the truck that the more blessed
[22:21] me with the testimony behind that is
[22:23] that I was not even looking for a truck
[22:25] I got called by a friend of mine and
[22:28] said hey there is a truck on a
[22:32] particular lot and I meet you to go test
[22:35] drive the truck for me said I just need
[22:37] to do a test drive it and and test drive
[22:39] it after you test drive it just call me
[22:41] back and let me know but you know what
[22:42] you know what it's like because I'm
[22:44] gonna fly or actually I'm gonna come to
[22:46] town I'm gonna buy that truck and I'm
[22:48] gonna leave town I said okay so I went
[22:52] to the car lot and I went to look at the
[22:54] truck and I test drove the truck and I
[22:57] did all these things and while I'm there
[22:58] to Carlisle I look at the corner of my
[23:00] eye I see this other truck I say well
[23:03] told us doesn't see actually just bring
[23:05] me the keys that out but let me see what
[23:06] happen to do and I just you know I
[23:09] couldn't even test drive because it was
[23:10] it was raining and everything that day
[23:12] but he the salesman happen to pull it
[23:15] underneath a under covering and when he
[23:18] got there it just so happen to be a man
[23:20] standing there that owned the truck like
[23:22] that just moved a different model and so
[23:27] I didn't know nothing by the truck I'm
[23:28] trying to look around act like I know
[23:30] what I'm looking at and the guy the guy
[23:32] could see that I didn't know what I was
[23:34] doing so he came over he just start
[23:35] ripping things apart to see this disc
[23:38] this dude he said give me Commission on
[23:40] this he he just showed me an old truck I
[23:42] said well all right that's nice so I say
[23:44] well we'll see I just prayed about it
[23:45] and I told my wife about us and we'll
[23:47] see if it's something that best for me
[23:48] now and I decided I went down to the lot
[23:52] talk to them about it
[23:53] and I had a certain number of my mind
[23:55] that I wanted to pay for it
[23:56] and so when we talked that first day we
[24:00] were I want to say probably four
[24:02] thousand dollars away from the number
[24:03] that I wanted to be in and I say no no I
[24:07] did my day today for anything I want
[24:09] that and now that you're not just left
[24:12] and you know I'm just left it like that
[24:14] so the salesman told my friend say yeah
[24:16] your friend come back and look at that
[24:18] truck we just couldn't get the numbers
[24:19] work down I say yeah oh well I'm not
[24:22] gonna worry about it
[24:22] so uh my friend say I'm coming on such
[24:25] and such a day I'm coming to buy the
[24:26] other truck
[24:27] and I'm gonna see if I can get both
[24:28] trucks worked into the same deal I say
[24:31] okay he say how much you want to pay for
[24:35] us I told how much I wanted to pay and
[24:37] he said Oh cameras if I can get both
[24:39] just worth that I say okay so he was
[24:42] going back and forth and he he said I
[24:44] can only get him to drop another $500
[24:46] from weird where you work I say I can't
[24:49] I can't do that at Best Buy I don't
[24:51] worry about it take your blessing and
[24:52] you know praise the Lord he takes me
[24:56] about an hour ladies say yeah I got him
[24:58] to move I got him down four hundred
[25:01] dollars above where you want to be will
[25:02] you take the truck I say yes I will
[25:05] four hundred dollars more than where I
[25:07] got to be I will our glad to take the
[25:09] truck and so the Lord blessed through
[25:12] him getting a truck the deal work that
[25:16] where I got the truck and at the price
[25:18] that I wanted it and and and I think it
[25:21] was six thousand dollars less than what
[25:23] they had on the sticker price so I think
[25:29] [Applause]
[25:35] okay while they were working the
[25:42] transaction what my friend did he got
[25:46] them down to a certain number and then
[25:48] my friend said I'm gonna put some money
[25:50] down as well in order to get you down to
[25:54] this number
[25:55] so I'd say I never seen nobody do
[26:00] nothing like that and he asked me do you
[26:01] want to say yeah I want it I want it if
[26:03] I if I said no I think I'd be happy
[26:07] throwing a blessing back in God's face
[26:09] so I said yes I'll take it and so I'm
[26:12] grateful grateful for that and that that
[26:14] was not a plan of just what God did so
[26:17] something incredible a man crazy boy

[26:38] why would she be free if I had a
[26:41] toothache strategy so what I've heard a
[26:43] little bit but it has been an incredible
[26:46] year all based off of inspiration of the
[26:50] pasady is that service when he preached
[26:53] and the whole church does grab hold of
[26:55] it so it's been one thing after the next
[27:00] between Kay's doors open vessels of
[27:03] Mercy vessels of Wrath I mean I'm just
[27:06] grateful for God confirmed and answer
[27:09] some prayers that I've had in my heart
[27:11] and let me know a lot of planning but
[27:14] most importantly thankful for bless me

[30:55] called her husband and told her of him
[30:58] about it said she didn't want to call
[30:59] anybody because she didn't want anybody
[31:00] to get all upset so to me I just you
[31:05] know we pray we pray for God's hand of
[31:11] protection around us and I pray for the
[31:15] drivers God's hand protection around
[31:18] them and when we when I pray sometimes
[31:22] you pray about just accident somebody
[31:24] not hitting you know running
[31:26] to them or them running into somebody
[31:28] but something like this I had never
[31:30] thought about so I just thank God for
[31:32] His grace and His mercy and His divine
[31:34] protection and his hands of protection
[31:36] around this drug and I thank you for her
[31:39] dedication god bless you give honor and
[31:53] glory to the Lord Jesus I don't remember
[32:02] the right stuff okay so first of all I
[32:09] want to be I just want to thank the Lord
[32:12] for the honor to lay my dad to rest at
[32:18] Arlington Cemetery it was a year in the
[32:22] making calling back it was a challenge
[32:27] actually to be honest with you to give
[32:30] it all ordinated I ended up having to
[32:36] right a congressional where you write
[32:41] your Congressman and get them involved
[32:43] because the once you submit the
[32:48] application is win in August so as we
[32:51] like about three months and it was like
[32:54] a year before they gave me the final the
[32:57] final life but that was after I had
[32:59] actually went through and contacted my
[33:02] car
[33:03] wrote and wrote out a letter and stuff
[33:04] like that so it was and then when he
[33:08] when they actually gave me a date it was
[33:10] a coordinated with convention there and
[33:14] in Maryland right like it's like the day
[33:17] after so everything kind of worked out
[33:20] perfectly after that and then Oh brother
[33:24] Jack and sister Erica was able to come
[33:27] so I appreciate the support that
[33:30] professors always given me since I've
[33:33] been here in South Florida and I can
[33:36] tell you it'd be hard for me to leave
[33:43] you say you have to get a crowbar to
[33:50] attempt to leave or musically to South
[33:53] Florida no way no way I love love South
[33:59] Florida I love my church thank you for a
[34:01] great church thanks for the Saints it's
[34:04] an honor and a privilege to be among you
[34:06] and to be fellowshipping with you
[34:09] and Tuesday prayers and combined prayers
[34:14] what a wonderful honor it is to be in
[34:17] the midst of life precious thing so I'm
[34:20] very thankful for that I I kind of did a
[34:28] little trick on the pastor because last
[34:37] September was actually the September the
[34:43] 25th September 25th I got a new car the
[34:51] Lord blessed with a car so I got it on
[35:00] the 25th and I have been talking to the
[35:03] Lord because actually they they wanted
[35:07] they had given me they had me have a car
[35:09] like a week prior to that one and and I
[35:14] was gonna get things going to deliver
[35:15] that one to me then I went out when I
[35:19] looked at I won't end up looking at it I
[35:21] ended up not getting that in it actually
[35:23] ended up being delayed and in my mind I
[35:27] had this and this this appointment that
[35:32] I wanted to play out for our pastor
[35:35] there and so God had to coordinate
[35:40] everything together for that happen and
[35:44] so what happened I got the board that
[35:48] got the car on the twenty yeah
[35:50] but not only that I got to get a car in
[35:53] the 25th
[35:54] I closed on a new house on the 26 but I
[36:03] wanted to have brother Jack come over
[36:07] and see the house but I wanted to have a
[36:12] car in the garage
[36:13] oh he got there so he walked up so what
[36:22] I did was I had the car
[36:23] I moved the car over to from out of the
[36:26] place I moved it I drove it over to the
[36:28] new house park in the garage then I
[36:32] walked back home I said brother Jack she
[36:35] couldn't come fix me up I want to show
[36:38] you something so he's talking I can come
[36:42] over to meet you
[36:43] so he came over pick me up I said he
[36:47] came over to the house I said like he
[36:49] was planning on coming in because that's
[36:51] who he thought was gonna come in I said
[36:53] no we got to take a little ride so we
[36:56] drove around the corner and I was like
[37:01] stop here go here here stop here I said
[37:05] this is my new house it's like oh
[37:10] brother
[37:12] so we walked through a new stuff like
[37:14] that so you know I everybody's walking
[37:16] around looking good stuff so he found me
[37:20] he walks around it goes through the
[37:23] laundry and then it goes out to the
[37:24] garage
[37:25] you know opens the door he sees the car
[37:27] in there and just like hey they left the
[37:30] car you know I say no yes yes
[37:48] yeah you got a toaster so that was
[37:51] wonder I was like I had to play all that
[37:54] out Moorhead to coordinate the timing
[37:56] and everything so everything would you
[37:58] know what kind of meat and fit perfect
[38:03] and he made it so I thank the Lord for
[38:12] that God is concerned about every thing
[38:24] that we love my brother Branham says all
[38:26] that we love will be there right so even
[38:30] their little things and things you don't
[38:33] you may have something in your back you
[38:36] you had or something like that but those
[38:38] little things he like just let you have
[38:42] it as a blessing and so I've always
[38:45] hated my mind I play golf right always
[38:48] kind of here yeah be nice to hit the
[38:52] ball from the tee and get it in that
[38:53] hole shot so the Lord blessed me
[39:05] about a week and a half ago I couldn't
[39:17] even see the hole I just hit the ball
[39:23] went over and I thought I was like oh
[39:26] this thing must have went past then went
[39:28] past the hole I was like so the guy that
[39:30] I was like four of us together so we
[39:33] rolled over and we were like Patton the
[39:35] hole was this way he was walking around
[39:37] was like I can't see this father know
[39:39] what happened to that ball
[39:40] that's so weird and there was another
[39:43] guy on the green right and he'd went and
[39:44] put knock this ball in a hole and so he
[39:49] goes over here he looks down he's like
[39:51] hey hey there's another ball in here I
[39:55] was like yeah so what's the name of that
[39:58] ball he said he told me search alright
[40:01] I'll say
[40:18] he blessed me with that and so the last
[40:23] thing I wanted to say I'm just going to
[40:25] be thankful I'm thankful for in abeyance
[40:28] right in advance I'm declaring and I'm
[40:34] thankful for the restoration of my son
[40:38] [Applause]
[40:46] if you play golf you understand why he
[40:49] gave that testimony but that's
[40:51] incredible
[40:52] we said all right my brother prays will
[40:59] accomplish first of all I want to thank
[41:04] the Lord for blessing both of sin such
[41:08] tremendous editing skills what you did
[41:11] at our last service bill
[41:18] I want three
[41:28] god bless I appreciated
[41:40] praise the Lord oh yes a little bit
[41:46] after we met brother Stephen found out
[41:48] he was working at sentence I started a
[41:51] plane I guess roughly three years ago
[41:53] applying for that job
[41:55] yeah everything has been going pretty
[41:58] well with it yesterday I spoke with the
[42:01] lady in HR she told me all I had to do
[42:04] was have a drug test and to be about a
[42:06] week before I get it back get me get the
[42:09] results back and uh she called me today
[42:13] and she said I'm mr. Johnson the job is
[42:16] yours
[42:25] so you told me that call on my dad give
[42:28] her my start date which will be November
[42:30] 25th alright but the most incredible
[42:43] thing that I like to testify about is
[42:49] you know the things that we've heard
[42:51] preached this year especially where we
[42:55] are now when we just finished war
[42:57] strategies just looking back over the
[43:01] past couple of months with the things
[43:05] that we have been talked I've been
[43:08] challenged on almost every day at work
[43:11] and the response that I would have given
[43:15] you know South Carolina Esther and the
[43:20] finest if you want to jump on here my
[43:25] boss would've did what he did without
[43:28] this preaching it would've got pretty
[43:33] but I was able to pray for him
[43:37] throughout everything that was going
[43:40] through right now I can see him shake
[43:44] his hand smile talk with him he may be
[43:47] doing different things behind my back
[43:49] that I know of just keep pressing the
[43:53] bass
[43:54] I know that the Lord is working
[43:56] everything out for us now I don't know
[43:59] how everything is gonna turn out over
[44:01] the next couple of weeks you know once I
[44:05] once I heard about the job immediately
[44:07] my wife got hold of a realtor so house
[44:11] is gonna be on the market trying to give
[44:13] it another house I thought God's gonna
[44:16] have to do incredible they might be the
[44:21] way that Satan has been fighting this
[44:23] year we have been touched tremendously
[44:29] and I'll find that since I see
[44:31] tremendous so God is gonna have to do
[44:35] whatever
[44:36] and I believe for the incredible I've
[44:40] been watching everything that has been
[44:42] doing knowing that everything is working
[44:44] for our good and watching it has been
[44:47] declared to us this is the year of the
[44:49] aircraft and we are witnesses of what's
[44:52] been going on that's incredible and I
[44:55] look at this thing that we're going
[44:57] through God is allowing us to come to a
[45:00] place where we know whatever he's
[45:02] getting ready to do we couldn't do it
[45:04] it's gonna have to be the hand of God to
[45:07] get us here in South Florida is God and
[45:10] that's going to be fast another thing
[45:14] that we're grateful for August 3rd last
[45:17] year
[45:17] I injured my shoulder yeah pretty ironic
[45:21] that August 3rd of this year who does
[45:23] she know wedding her friends so in the
[45:28] year's time God did something very
[45:31] special for me and my wife that it was
[45:34] one of our goals we were looking for a
[45:36] way down the road it happened so fast
[45:39] and God is doing tremendous things and
[45:42] we're just excited about it Australia
[45:45] another incredible thing is you know
[45:48] normally when you're going through the
[45:50] trouble that you're going through a wife
[45:53] gets so frustrated we need to do this we
[45:56] need to do that she hasn't been that way
[45:58] she's been on my side she's been sending
[46:00] me quotes on scriptures every morning
[46:03] had and that work and that's something
[46:05] incredible because if we before this
[46:08] teaching on without that girl wouldn't
[46:13] the talk about putting meal I think the
[46:23] Lord for each of you because sometimes
[46:26] you just don't know when I've had pretty
[46:32] rough weeks some of the things that
[46:35] y'all was say right outside this church
[46:38] will be exactly
[46:41] exactly and all the brothers chattering
[46:44] little poops little scriptures the thing
[46:47] that I need right at that morning what
[46:49] come across and I want to thank the Lord
[46:53] that he's able to use you to do
[46:54] something incredible for me god bless
[46:57] each one know what I just want to thank
[47:06] you
[47:07] that's alright praise the Lord brother
[47:09] got the job here in West Palm Beach so
[47:11] every relocate name on you hey man glory
[47:18] to God I got three things I want to
[47:26] thank God for it
[47:26] first thing I wanted to thank him for
[47:31] this is the second year year number two
[47:34] I was still cancer-free
[47:36] [Applause]
[47:43] I don't know why they make me go back
[47:46] every year to get tested again up on the
[47:48] weapon it's gone I know that it's gonna
[47:51] still be cancer for us so I think God
[47:55] for that also I thank God for my job
[47:59] that it must be MIT so I no longer have
[48:01] to go to Broward that he'd let me
[48:07] witness it's the same work that I was
[48:09] doing in private but it's here in Palm
[48:11] Beach County and I just thank God for
[48:13] such a sometimes I wake up in this light
[48:17] wow this is really my job it's such a
[48:20] relaxed low stress I mean I can get the
[48:24] word and I just sit on my computer and I
[48:28] wait for a phone call if I get one I
[48:30] don't I just sit on my computer I just
[48:39] think gotta have a wonderful supervisor
[48:41] but it's very I mean just you can ask
[48:45] for a better classroom job I really can
[48:47] I just thank God for that because I know
[48:49] the jobs like this don't come back too
[48:50] often and I thank him first protection
[48:54] so whenever I do work I take care of all
[48:59] of patients that may come up with
[49:01] tuberculosis in Palm Beach County so I
[49:04] think God first protection whenever I do
[49:06] have to go to a hospital I have to
[49:07] actually sit in the room with the person
[49:10] that's active tuberculosis and I just
[49:12] thank God for his protection and keeping
[49:14] me while I'm surrounded by these demons
[49:18] also the third thing I want to thank our
[49:20] for
[49:20] is blessing us with a place to live we
[49:24] would had to move back in April and we
[49:27] were having problems with them previous
[49:29] place we're at we were looking for a
[49:30] place to live we really had to move in a
[49:33] hurry because what the conditions was
[49:35] just unlivable and we were looking and
[49:38] look at him driving around and looking
[49:40] and met with a million didn't see a lot
[49:41] of different places of ikana in a crunch
[49:43] to accept a place so we went to see this
[49:48] place and we almost signed the lease no
[49:51] we were they were going over the lease
[49:53] with us and then my husband was looking
[49:55] at each other like huh but we really
[49:58] want to sign this it was just some crazy
[49:59] stuff on the lease I mean some crazy
[50:01] stuff but we were so desperate almost
[50:04] signed the lease they got to like page 7
[50:06] we were like yeah no like wow are you
[50:15] serious no can't do it so we got this
[50:20] close to sign that lease and was like no
[50:21] you can't do it nevermind that's okay
[50:23] well I want to place that bad
[50:25] so isn't a good thing you did because it
[50:28] was first of all it was upstairs it was
[50:31] very very tiny it was nice but a very
[50:33] very tiny and like I said it was more
[50:36] money and a whole lot of crazy stuff on
[50:38] the lease that we would have been
[50:39] responsible for it
[50:40] so because we didn't do that the very
[50:45] next day the realtor sent us the lists
[50:48] and saying look at this list to see if
[50:49] you see anything else the same list and
[50:51] this place is honor we just went further
[50:53] down on the list we saw this place was
[50:55] like hey that's nice let's go look at
[50:57] that one tomorrow so we went to see the
[50:59] place they set it up we went to see the
[51:01] place somebody was still living in it at
[51:02] the time and they met with us so we can
[51:05] walk through a walkthrough we really
[51:07] fell in love with the place and nobody
[51:08] else had saw it nobody had put in for it
[51:10] so we were like yes we want the place
[51:12] let's get it let's get it and thank god
[51:14] it worked out we were able to get the
[51:16] place even before the current people
[51:17] moved out we were able to sign a lease
[51:19] on the place by getting the place is
[51:22] much bigger cheaper nicer everything
[51:26] just
[51:26] you know God is working out he is a
[51:35] provider a man all right I just wanted
[51:49] she just that when we first thought in
[51:52] looking forward that was the first place
[51:56] I bought it riding around and just
[51:58] looking for places the place where we're
[52:00] at is the first place I went to look at
[52:03] and I'm riding around through the place
[52:05] in my pre I said Lord this is where I
[52:07] wanna be
[52:08] and I went home and I told my wife I
[52:10] said I wanted to be I described the area
[52:13] to us that's what we wanna be
[52:15] that's where I want to be but it was
[52:16] nothing for it
[52:18] nothing for renting that place so we
[52:20] thought she said he was in the crutches
[52:22] and I heard we had to get out of my hair
[52:24] so I thought I call the realtor loose on
[52:26] a second up walk through the bank I'll
[52:28] to go while she's at work and tell us
[52:30] that you know they're doing elect it's
[52:31] getting electric so we were like she
[52:34] said very desperate Emily almost signed
[52:36] quit and I told her if I say this is not
[52:38] a trap like she said we thought we had
[52:50] to walk away even the realtor was like
[52:52] she knew what kind of a situation that
[52:54] was vanished she was like okay so we'll
[52:57] and like she said her people had not
[53:00] even moved out of this place yet
[53:02] see this place and before they even
[53:07] moved out they gave us the opportunity
[53:10] and we signed the lease and that was a
[53:13] clear place to by the way that was back
[53:15] first and I go back
[53:23] do it some of you all weren't here when
[53:26] I first announced this if you want to
[53:28] share a testimony wait right on this
[53:31] side over here over here to my right
[53:33] because I got a certain way I want to do
[53:37] things and I so you want to share just
[53:39] make sure you make yourself over to the
[53:41] right just where they just went all
[53:43] right good otherwise if you're those
[53:45] over there that mean you don't want to
[53:47] share testimony all right come on yes
[53:50] y'all come on y'all come off praise the
[53:53] Lord
[54:04] but first of all I want to thank God for
[54:09] when I gave my life to the Lord the
[54:15] process was kind of slow but why I'm
[54:20] extending him being able to share this
[54:22] testimony with you guys is because God
[54:25] allowed me to hold to a lot of things
[54:27] and build a really solid foundation for
[54:30] me and I've been able to extend
[54:34] something strong some big things the
[54:39] devil has thrown at me in guys a lot of
[54:41] those thing right and I can I have built
[54:44] this I probably got more wrong things
[54:48] and good things but I have built this
[54:50] trust in the Lord and this confidence in
[54:54] God that I can pray through things and I
[54:58] can give things to God and I can
[55:01] actually know that he works in
[55:04] mysterious ways but he performs
[55:12] incredible where you may know I got this
[55:16] beautiful lady sitting right here and I
[55:18] she probably has made me decide do we
[55:21] have testimonies together we have
[55:24] testimonies separately but there's one
[55:28] big thing that I have to bring to you
[55:31] guys and share because last year I said
[55:36] that something was gonna happen
[55:47] okay we homeowners then I'll explain a
[55:58] little bit because it's not really about
[56:00] being a homeowner that's alright because
[56:04] I was on Sunday and I was just my Sunday
[56:16] and see how I am you see how it's
[56:36] nothing it's not a lot for us to have
[56:54] has not affected my budget it has not
[56:57] affected my prayer all right it's
[56:58] actually even tell her we were like I'm
[57:03] gonna tell you how it happened but I
[57:05] just want to say that we were like like
[57:07] really excited when we do have any kind
[57:10] of the Devils
[57:12] you know like you over here like acting
[57:14] like like like you're not supposed to be
[57:17] all that exhales thing you know we
[57:20] supposed to be excited that's right no
[57:22] it doesn't mean that what God is giving
[57:24] us is making who we are but ya know so I
[57:29] was like I was excited we were wanted to
[57:34] buy a house three years ago we were
[57:37] ready to buy a house three years ago we
[57:39] couldn't find the house that we wanted
[57:40] we found a house that we liked you put a
[57:44] contract on it things happening but
[57:47] would kidding we had to back out of it
[57:49] you saw a couple of the houses to
[57:51] contrast and it just wasn't happening
[57:53] and then last year around the same time
[57:56] we put a contract in this house and that
[57:58] was it this house is about God showing
[58:10] himself through the things that's what
[58:12] just blows me away you know didn't
[58:15] happen in at all and I said what about
[58:19] this fire we're signing a lease again
[58:21] this is gonna be the last lease Teresa
[58:23] okay so
[58:29] we inside beside a lot of haters
[58:32] but it wasn't Italy you know so we I
[58:36] just want to say like a couple of little
[58:39] key things because I could stay here and
[58:40] just talk all night about what God is
[58:42] doing and how he's been doing this but
[58:44] yeah it's been
[58:45] he's been so specific I asked her I said
[58:47] lord if this is the time I want to not
[58:52] have to not work take me through the
[58:54] process without worries because last
[58:57] couple of times so hard you it didn't
[58:59] even feel right you was worried this and
[59:01] then some it was happening foolish
[59:03] stressing and I was just like something
[59:06] is that I don't think it's not the time
[59:08] but God was allowing us to go through it
[59:10] because we felt any were trusting God
[59:12] you know we're like this is saying God
[59:14] you took this way this is it but it
[59:17] wasn't the time you know we find another
[59:20] house for this house but we pull
[59:31] contracting for the people they did not
[59:35] return the inner counters I can answer
[59:38] anything
[59:43] No
[59:44] so then all of a sudden you think
[59:47] looking at the houses and they didn't
[59:50] answer us and then you go in the house
[59:52] like $40,000 so oh that's right what
[59:57] it's like all right that's it now they
[1:00:00] gotta give it to us cheaper and I was
[1:00:03] like let's just let's just cut it you
[1:00:05] know where he steals whole process we
[1:00:07] gonna pray body and I say you know what
[1:00:08] we're not big ass here we're not gonna
[1:00:11] we're not gonna we're not gonna do
[1:00:13] anything but you kind of like broke that
[1:00:28] of course made us kind of like like wait
[1:00:32] a little more she's like he makes does
[1:00:35] something seem like she really does and
[1:00:41] I'm not hosting this one in the pictures
[1:00:44] were horrible and we found out I came
[1:00:47] into the house for me to give you
[1:00:50] exactly how it was I would have to tell
[1:00:52] you so many things but we found out we
[1:00:55] gotta for the price I was standing on
[1:00:58] that one time there somebody else I
[1:01:00] think it was Rachel Stephen and they
[1:01:04] would think they wanted they would try
[1:01:06] to get a house and the house was morning
[1:01:07] and I keep saying you know what you
[1:01:10] don't have to you don't have to find a
[1:01:12] cheaper house God is gonna give the
[1:01:14] house that you won for the price that
[1:01:17] you want without happening on the oh the
[1:01:19] house that we were gonna close on if I
[1:01:22] can just add this was a smaller house
[1:01:27] they didn't have a pool then y'all
[1:01:30] wanted exactly what I wanted in this
[1:01:33] house that we get the we get it now has
[1:01:35] the rooms that we wanted bigger not that
[1:01:39] I wanted
[1:01:43] every pretty much you beat everything
[1:01:45] else that we got more than we asked all
[1:01:48] right well uh actually gave us more than
[1:01:50] we wanted man and the last house that we
[1:01:53] were gonna get at that time we were
[1:01:54] gonna get a percentage our percentage
[1:01:57] interest rate was going to be four point
[1:01:59] two we have their contract I told Amanda
[1:02:14] that you were then we're ready to bring
[1:02:17] the contract we had to pay for two
[1:02:19] months to break the contract that's what
[1:02:21] we signed for it so we closed in the
[1:02:23] house on November December January
[1:02:28] contract so the money that we were gonna
[1:02:31] have to pay the two months and that was
[1:02:33] all worried about us moving with her
[1:02:35] school and all that stuff so now the
[1:02:37] money that we had to pay we now we have
[1:02:39] the house and we have the other house
[1:02:41] and we're not breaking the curtain we
[1:02:43] fish in the contract and brother Quentin
[1:02:53] said that he got a new car brother
[1:02:55] Jack's day he got a new car this I
[1:02:58] closed of the house
[1:03:03] [Applause]
[1:03:09] besides all those things the guys gave
[1:03:12] it doesn't change my approach to God
[1:03:15] rather doesn't change something that
[1:03:38] just makes it so much bigger so I
[1:03:40] couldn't just stay here I would not have
[1:03:42] now it just wouldn't that's not a
[1:03:44] testimony testimony is that we got help
[1:03:46] but the real testimony is how that did
[1:03:48] it how he brought us through how we had
[1:03:51] to look back the things that we went
[1:03:54] through forgot to be able to put us in a
[1:03:57] play then when you get to this place
[1:03:58] where God already like feels that like
[1:04:02] you really like brother Jack you know
[1:04:08] can you break that down for that but
[1:04:10] like you get to a place where I just
[1:04:13] seen
[1:04:22] just delete some things that you can you
[1:04:26] can I can't explain I can not but that's
[1:04:28] why I can't I can't explain but he's
[1:04:30] just like himself and that is them look
[1:04:35] that's the one thing I always ask you
[1:04:36] this just prove yourself to me brother
[1:04:55] Quinn and I wish I'd have made a list I
[1:05:00] have so many things to be thankful for
[1:05:04] so I've been here for you know just a
[1:05:09] few years but before that my life was
[1:05:12] very different before I met the Lord it
[1:05:15] was very very different and so was after
[1:05:18] I had gotten out of the military I was
[1:05:20] kind of wondering you know I didn't
[1:05:24] really have a place a direction a
[1:05:26] purpose you know and that all changed
[1:05:28] when I met the Lord and the Lord grabbed
[1:05:31] me and shook me you know and just
[1:05:35] changed everything
[1:05:37] so from that moment up until now just
[1:05:44] trying to find God's will for my life
[1:05:46] you know before that I was just drifting
[1:05:50] you know I really didn't know what I
[1:05:51] wanted to do with my life I didn't know
[1:05:53] I
[1:05:56] any purpose you know living that was the
[1:05:59] purpose but as far as like a career or
[1:06:02] something like that I mean so so going
[1:06:06] through school I feel perfectly placed
[1:06:09] at PBA right now just I mean so many
[1:06:13] things have happened there with the
[1:06:15] cancer fatigue program that I've worked
[1:06:17] with a meeting brother quite cool things
[1:06:20] that have happened with advisors and so
[1:06:22] forth and so but as far as moving
[1:06:26] forward I have just been praying and
[1:06:29] asking God to keep me in his will
[1:06:32] because I don't want to pursue something
[1:06:35] that's you know I'm just doing it for
[1:06:38] money or you know nothing right
[1:06:42] intentions without even knowing it you
[1:06:44] know and that's really easy to do once
[1:06:48] you get like in the academics so now I'm
[1:06:53] very thankful because going through that
[1:06:55] I took an internship over the summer and
[1:07:00] during that internship a couple of a few
[1:07:03] days after I started there they offered
[1:07:06] me a job well I took the job and I told
[1:07:10] them okay I'm gonna take this job
[1:07:11] because but I wasn't looking for a job
[1:07:14] so we're gonna take it and if I can't
[1:07:15] make it work you know I'm gonna give it
[1:07:18] a couple weeks and if it's too much I'm
[1:07:19] gonna you know so it was it was too much
[1:07:25] with my schoolwork but it was a it was a
[1:07:27] good opportunity because as I was
[1:07:29] working there I just I was able to see
[1:07:32] what my career would would be in that
[1:07:35] and even though it was great even though
[1:07:37] I can
[1:07:38] do it even though I knew you get it and
[1:07:40] I would make a lot of money I I didn't
[1:07:43] feel like passionate about it you know
[1:07:47] it wasn't something that I felt like it
[1:07:49] was calling for me to do that it was
[1:07:51] kind of just something I would do that
[1:07:52] would get us to where we want it to be
[1:07:55] and so a whole bunch of stuff has
[1:07:58] happened and to tell you that would take
[1:08:00] forever but a whole bunch of stuff has
[1:08:02] happened since then because after that
[1:08:04] experience that I started praying and
[1:08:06] asking God you know kind of help me
[1:08:08] through this because I'm having doubts
[1:08:09] and which everybody does so you know
[1:08:12] help me find where you want me to be and
[1:08:16] so things are working in a direction now
[1:08:18] where I'm thankful that he is showing me
[1:08:21] where he wants me to be I'm very excited
[1:08:25] and motivated and very uplifted about
[1:08:29] the things that are going on so I'm
[1:08:30] thankful for that because I feel like
[1:08:32] I'm finding my place with my where my
[1:08:34] education sleeting me for my career so
[1:08:37] I'm very thankful for that more to come
[1:08:38] but hold it um with the house and the
[1:08:44] truck that was a really big thing for us
[1:08:46] he kind of said everything but oh okay
[1:08:57] so I just I was in the military so I go
[1:09:01] to school and my school is funded
[1:09:03] through a government program so um I got
[1:09:08] a letter in the mail oh it was scary so
[1:09:13] you're gonna let her in the mail and
[1:09:14] they said okay the money back up when I
[1:09:17] first got out of the military I started
[1:09:19] receiving benefits for a disability and
[1:09:25] that disability was a major depressive
[1:09:28] disorder I was on a depressant
[1:09:32] and I was depressed when I first guy was
[1:09:34] military so they sent me a letter in the
[1:09:37] mail and they said which I'm no longer
[1:09:39] depressed but they sent me a letter in
[1:09:42] the mail and they said hey it looks like
[1:09:45] you're doing better we noticed you
[1:09:46] haven't had any prescriptions checked
[1:09:49] out we noticed you haven't been going to
[1:09:50] therapy we're gonna take away your
[1:09:53] benefits now
[1:09:54] that included a whole bunch of stuff
[1:09:56] including my education so the program
[1:10:04] that I am in is only for disabled
[1:10:06] veterans so I was you know at first I
[1:10:10] was like ok God you know do you not want
[1:10:13] me there school do you want me to be out
[1:10:15] of the government's pocket like what how
[1:10:18] is this gonna work out you know so I was
[1:10:21] just praying for God to give me patience
[1:10:23] and help me not to worry which thank God
[1:10:26] I wasn't worrying they want the the
[1:10:31] thing with the military and the the
[1:10:32] disability you have to make them believe
[1:10:35] that you are disabled for them to give
[1:10:38] you anything so I would have had to go
[1:10:42] into an office with someone and convince
[1:10:45] them that I was suffering from a major
[1:10:47] depressive disorder for me to be able to
[1:10:50] keep my benefits and at first that was
[1:10:53] battling in my mind and the more that
[1:10:55] God just worked on my heart it took like
[1:10:57] a week but I'm sorry the more the color
[1:11:01] my heart with that the more that God
[1:11:04] worked on my heart with that I was it
[1:11:05] was torturing neck I just hurt like I
[1:11:09] couldn't go sit in front of these people
[1:11:10] and tell them that I was majorly
[1:11:12] depressed like what am I gonna do cry I
[1:11:14] don't know what about what so I talked
[1:11:19] to him about it and I was telling him
[1:11:21] you know I I think I think we're gonna
[1:11:26] lose like everything all my benefit this
[1:11:28] school the money everything so we just
[1:11:33] kept praying about every way
[1:11:34] together Jackie gave us great guidance
[1:11:36] as always and thank God for a pastor so
[1:11:40] so we just kept praying and you know I
[1:11:45] came to the conclusion that if that was
[1:11:48] God's will to take that away then if it
[1:11:51] was his will for me to keep going to
[1:11:52] school he'd make away you know so it
[1:11:55] really wasn't stressing me out or
[1:11:57] bothered me or anything okay so anyway
[1:12:07] so anyway I called my vocational
[1:12:11] rehabilitation counselor and she's the
[1:12:15] one who gives me my money and so I
[1:12:17] called her and I said hey I just got a
[1:12:20] letter that says I'm not gonna be any
[1:12:23] longer so you know am i qualified she
[1:12:29] was like well you know we're really not
[1:12:31] in the business of kicking people out of
[1:12:33] the program once they started because
[1:12:40] that was so big you know I love I love
[1:12:43] being able to go to school and so that
[1:12:44] was huge so I just thank God for that
[1:12:47] for making a way for helping me to have
[1:12:49] peace through that because they are
[1:12:50] going to pay for my Master's are gonna
[1:12:52] pay for a few certifications that I meet
[1:12:54] that are like thousands of dollars so
[1:12:57] they are Jesus so I'm very thankful for
[1:13:01] that there's more okay I'm sorry
[1:13:10] overall I'm just very thankful for God
[1:13:13] just working with us in our marriage
[1:13:16] you're married you know it's not pretty
[1:13:18] all the time so just thankful because um
[1:13:21] we're both a little feisty and so God is
[1:13:24] working with us with our patience and
[1:13:26] just working with
[1:13:28] communication skills and so many so many
[1:13:30] so many things and so I'm just very
[1:13:33] thankful so my kids rock okay just just
[1:13:47] quickly to add to a portion of testimony
[1:13:50] and God's done some incredible things

[1:14:50] him to get to the place that he was

[1:15:55] bit so we thank God for that
[1:15:56] sister Charisse Amen you coming at this
[1:15:59] time please alone
[1:16:00] [Applause]
[1:16:05] okay so I have two testimonies
[1:16:09] so the first testimony I like to give is
[1:16:13] thinking god I got a new job and it
[1:16:18] really wasn't anything I was looking for
[1:16:20] at the time I just one day went online
[1:16:23] and apply for the job then I want to see
[1:16:28] the very next day I got a phone call
[1:16:32] from the companies I guess president
[1:16:37] Regent manager anyway she called me and
[1:16:39] I was actually at work and I'll be right
[1:16:42] back so so I talked with the with the
[1:16:47] manager and she was saying I was looking
[1:16:49] over you know your resume and and she
[1:16:53] was saying I'm gonna she liked my resume
[1:16:56] and we had a conversation and she's like
[1:16:59] I'm gonna pass on your resume along to
[1:17:02] the office that I'm working at now the
[1:17:06] office manager and you know expect a
[1:17:08] call so I think maybe two days later
[1:17:12] went by I got a call again I was at work
[1:17:16] but now she she said could I do a phone
[1:17:20] interview and I said sure so we did the
[1:17:22] phone interview I think it was about 15
[1:17:24] minutes and she was like well I like the
[1:17:28] things that you know you're talking
[1:17:29] about I feel like you would be great for
[1:17:30] the office would you be able to come in
[1:17:34] for a working interview so I went for
[1:17:36] the working interview and I thought it
[1:17:41] went great and they were you know I met
[1:17:43] all the doctors and all that and they
[1:17:46] said okay
[1:17:47] so maybe give us a couple of days and
[1:17:50] we'll get back to you you know whether
[1:17:52] or not we got the job we have some other
[1:17:54] candidates so the very next day as that
[1:17:58] work again and I got the call that they
[1:18:02] wanted me to fill the position so I'm
[1:18:06] happy for that a job working out was in
[1:18:13] Jupiter and so in December it would've
[1:18:16] been a year that I was there and there's
[1:18:18] nothing wrong with the job but I just
[1:18:20] didn't like the fact that I had to drive
[1:18:21] the Jupiter every single day so the job
[1:18:24] that I'm at now is almost like right
[1:18:26] down the street from my house like nine
[1:18:28] minutes away
[1:18:29] better benefits higher pay so I'm
[1:18:32] thinking God for that I like to thank
[1:18:39] God for is his protection one see a
[1:18:43] month ago while we were up at the
[1:18:46] meetings in North Carolina
[1:18:49] Friday night we had left to church and I
[1:18:54] was in the car with three other girls we
[1:18:57] left a church to go get something to eat
[1:18:59] and I was driving one of the girls car
[1:19:05] and we had I had just merged on the
[1:19:10] highway and I'm driving and I had just
[1:19:15] gotten to the merge into another Lane
[1:19:19] and right up beside us is one of those
[1:19:23] big semi-truck stood two semi trucks and
[1:19:27] so I'm not you know thinking anything of
[1:19:30] it
[1:19:30] then all of a sudden while I'm driving
[1:19:33] the car just started just spinning just
[1:19:35] spinning and swerving and I couldn't and
[1:19:38] I'm holding it with both hands and all I
[1:19:41] could see was still this semi truck on
[1:19:45] the side of us and I was just like
[1:19:47] - because I knew if we would hit that
[1:19:49] semi-truck we really all would you know
[1:19:52] then so I was just
[1:19:56] it's all happening in in seconds and I'm
[1:19:59] processing in my mind I'm just like I
[1:20:00] just can't we just cannot hit this truck
[1:20:02] can I hit this truck and as I was you
[1:20:06] know trying to drip the car to just
[1:20:08] stopped from spinning I just had to I
[1:20:11] want to say it was God that helped me
[1:20:13] give me this shrimp
[1:20:14] to this jerk the car and we were on the
[1:20:17] left the left side of the lane we're
[1:20:21] next to it was a wall we just had to
[1:20:23] crash into that and I'm just thinking
[1:20:25] God so much because I really don't know
[1:20:28] how we all made it out of that that
[1:20:31] accident alive
[1:20:34] we had bumps bruises but in the car was
[1:20:39] total but I've just thinking God so much
[1:20:41] for a second chance and just allowing us
[1:20:44] to make it out one thing I would say is
[1:20:48] and I feel like what was God because
[1:20:50] there's many times that I've kind of
[1:20:53] rode on that Highway like that I was
[1:20:56] always busy and at that time where we
[1:20:59] were on the highway it was just us in
[1:21:02] that semi truck and and just hard when
[1:21:06] we talked about it all
[1:21:07] one of the girls in the back she said
[1:21:10] when she saw us spinning all she saw was
[1:21:12] like her door basically in the truck so
[1:21:17] I think God so much there was I want to
[1:21:20] say it was God that sent this lady she
[1:21:22] was almost a little ways back but she
[1:21:24] said she saw everything and she got up
[1:21:29] the car and and she had helped us all
[1:21:31] out you know we say overgrown girl we
[1:21:34] were all acting like babies on the side
[1:21:36] of the road just crying coming crying
[1:21:38] because I mean I was just in disbelief
[1:21:40] that we all just made it out alive so I
[1:21:43] just want to thank God for protection
[1:21:45] I mean it was a wake-up call to me not
[1:21:48] to take the grace of God for granted and
[1:21:50] just a whole thing of you gonna make it
[1:21:53] to your next destination cuz you really
[1:21:55] don't know so I just think God for that
[1:21:58] [Applause]
[1:22:05] precious sister other sisters that were
[1:22:07] involved in that thank God for keeping
[1:22:09] them sister Michelle
[1:22:18] you can't embrace that mercy and thank
[1:22:20] God for the protection I I have a lot to
[1:22:25] say to God to be grateful for that's one
[1:22:31] of the things to really give him great
[1:22:33] thanks for it's just his protection and
[1:22:40] just allowing my daughters to understand
[1:22:45] and know to believe God and understand
[1:22:51] God for themselves not for me but for
[1:22:54] themselves so and I thank God for that I
[1:22:57] also like to just think God for this
[1:22:59] year this year has just been such a
[1:23:02] awesome year and I say awesome meaning
[1:23:07] with all the tests and trials that have
[1:23:09] come my way
[1:23:10] I still call it awesome because I've
[1:23:13] seen God hand just work so tremendously
[1:23:15] in my life and I've seen him just grow
[1:23:19] me and mature me so closely and so much
[1:23:22] more to him but I thank him for that
[1:23:26] with that being said I'd like to also
[1:23:29] just give thanks to brother Troy for the
[1:23:33] quick was not host night here for your
[1:23:36] ministry here this year it just has been
[1:23:39] so awesome
[1:23:42] such a blessing it has just been so
[1:23:49] timely and when I'm praying and fasting
[1:23:54] and just speaking with my daughter or
[1:23:57] speaking to someone else and I can come
[1:23:58] into the house of God and just hear not
[1:24:02] only my pastor talk and confirm some of
[1:24:04] the same things that I'm talking about
[1:24:06] but the associate ministers come in and
[1:24:08] speak the same thing it's a blessing so
[1:24:11] I think God for I associate minister
[1:24:13] it's years but I thank God for that I
[1:24:15] also like to thank God for I also got a
[1:24:22] new part but how that happened was I
[1:24:32] like to thank God for our business and
[1:24:37] it just has been such a blessing and
[1:24:44] they thought for the testing trials but
[1:24:47] it's been such a blessing and my car was
[1:24:51] perfectly fine but it had come up to a
[1:24:54] hundred and ninety eight thousand miles
[1:24:56] and I had not had it in two years
[1:24:59] and so I was going in to get an extended
[1:25:03] warranty
[1:25:04] that's all I was going in to get was an
[1:25:06] extended warranties my car was perfectly
[1:25:08] fine had it checked out they were like
[1:25:11] wow four hundred and ninety eight
[1:25:12] thousand miles this car is great I was
[1:25:15] like perfect and so when I went in to
[1:25:18] look for the extended warranty the guy
[1:25:22] said well for three years 36,000 miles
[1:25:29] it's gonna cost this much for years
[1:25:33] 48,000 miles don't cost this much five
[1:25:36] years but
[1:25:37] was it gonna work thing and I said my
[1:25:41] lord that's not gonna work because I
[1:25:44] could do that in two months and so of
[1:25:49] course salesmen come around the corner
[1:25:52] and he says oh you come into my pocket
[1:25:56] no I'm not I'm coming to get a warranty
[1:25:59] he didn't know you coming about a car I
[1:26:01] said were the only way I'm gonna buy a
[1:26:02] car and you know my motto he said I know
[1:26:07] I know but you know you got to give me
[1:26:09] some money and you know no payments got
[1:26:11] to go up I said you know my motto he
[1:26:14] said Miss King let me work on it as I
[1:26:16] said when you work on that and so I said
[1:26:19] there for a little while and I thought
[1:26:21] about it and I said you know I'm not
[1:26:24] buying a car but I do need to get this
[1:26:27] warranty I had I was at a hundred and
[1:26:32] ninety eight thousand miles before my
[1:26:33] warranty expired and in order for me to
[1:26:37] get a new warranty that warranty could
[1:26:39] not expire so I knew that next day I had
[1:26:43] to go back to Miami and that was gonna
[1:26:48] kind of really eat up my mouth so so he
[1:26:52] came back and he said I could do this
[1:26:55] this and this but you're gonna have to
[1:26:57] do this this and this so I said I'm
[1:27:01] gonna do this this and this and I'm not
[1:27:04] gonna do that
[1:27:05] so he sent it well no I can't do that
[1:27:10] I said give my keys back I'm not gonna
[1:27:12] do that and so he said okay let me do
[1:27:16] this he said what color car you wanted
[1:27:18] so I called Cherie son no she called me
[1:27:20] and so she heard it she in the
[1:27:23] background just yelling out a color car
[1:27:24] I couldn't even think cuz I'm I'm just
[1:27:27] in there to get a warranty I really was
[1:27:29] not gonna buy her car she's yelling out
[1:27:32] a color car he hear on the background
[1:27:34] see so he tells somebody else go get
[1:27:36] that car
[1:27:37] so the guy going get the car and he came
[1:27:40] back to the car when he came back with a
[1:27:43] basic car and I had a luxury car and so
[1:27:49] he drove the basic car but I said that's
[1:27:52] a Turner Keith's car I'm giving you a
[1:27:54] push start car and a sunroof
[1:27:59] and you know leather but you've given me
[1:28:03] a turnkey thought I said no this is not
[1:28:05] gonna work right Cheney said but for the
[1:28:10] money that you want to pay this not
[1:28:13] gonna work so he said ok so Nikko he
[1:28:18] said well what other color car do you
[1:28:20] want if you want that so he'd go he said
[1:28:23] ok again now my 20:18 was driven off the
[1:28:29] truck with 7 miles he go and find a
[1:28:33] 20-19 off the truck what five miles

[1:29:05] trying to work his numbers do you know
[1:29:06] how they play the games but he know I
[1:29:08] didn't play the game so he come back
[1:29:10] with his number and I came back with my
[1:29:12] number so he said therefore in a while
[1:29:14] and I told my said listen in order for
[1:29:17] me to do this part I'm not gonna go any
[1:29:21] higher than what I am paying right now

[1:30:25] okay so he signed it first I signed it
[1:30:27] after so meaning he was gonna agree that
[1:30:32] what he was gonna pay this is what I was
[1:30:33] gonna pay so after we agreed that what
[1:30:36] he was gonna pay what I was gonna pay
[1:30:38] and I knew everything was gonna work out
[1:30:41] so as the night go on then you got to go
[1:30:45] to the bag to get the financing and
[1:30:46] everything like that so we get to the
[1:30:48] back to get to the financing and I said
[1:30:50] listen before you get to going to remind
[1:30:54] my credit I have a lock on my credit and
[1:30:57] you don't have to call me
[1:31:00] so is you're gonna have to have them

[1:31:21] called me the next day he say well I'm
[1:31:25] gonna need some money down he's going to
[1:31:27] next day

[1:31:32] car sitting out front with my keys
[1:31:34] because you could have this car back I
[1:31:36] don't get attached to anything he said
[1:31:39] what don't you like the car I see you
[1:31:40] know some nice stuff but I don't get
[1:31:42] attached to it so when I went back in
[1:31:45] the next day he came back and he said
[1:31:48] the numbers not adding up notice the
[1:31:51] actual finance guy
[1:31:53] I said well your owner says this is what
[1:31:56] I could have this is what I want so you
[1:31:58] have to work the numbers I ended up
[1:32:01] getting my car pay for my new heart less
[1:32:07] money than what I needed and my
[1:32:12] insurance drop for everything that I
[1:32:16] need I really thank God because and it
[1:32:27] wasn't some people saying it was
[1:32:29] persistence it's not persistent it's
[1:32:31] just that I trusted God and I know and I
[1:32:34] sat there and I said god this is what I
[1:32:36] have where I have to be this is what I
[1:32:38] need this is what I have to do and if
[1:32:42] you sometime if you get too ahead of God
[1:32:44] you know you get yourself in financial
[1:32:48] trouble and I said I I would never do
[1:32:50] that and I know if God brought me here
[1:32:53] he will he will make the way for me so I
[1:32:56] think God for just being persistent and
[1:32:58] just saying that you know this can
[1:33:00] happen and this will happen and it did
[1:33:02] happen and I saw God just financially
[1:33:04] just work numbers out and he was just
[1:33:08] like I don't know how you always come in
[1:33:10] here do that how you always come in here
[1:33:12] and make us eat almost $12,000 why do
[1:33:15] you do that how do you do that you need
[1:33:18] a job here so the regional manager came
[1:33:20] out do you want a job No thank God I see
[1:33:27] it's the God he took me to the side and
[1:33:30] he said you know
[1:33:31] i sat here and I watched you and I
[1:33:33] watched your character and he said
[1:33:35] there's something different about you
[1:33:37] and I I really true to thank God for you
[1:33:42] just being in here you didn't get
[1:33:44] bothered you didn't get upset you didn't
[1:33:46] waver this man ended up giving me almost
[1:33:50] $200 in gift cards
[1:33:52] I say well God thank you think my
[1:33:55] favorite
[1:33:55] it's the favor of God and I just thank
[1:33:58] God and I think offer so much and I
[1:34:01] think I for just standing fast on his
[1:34:04] word
[1:34:05] and just holding fast to his word and
[1:34:07] just believing in him and trusting on
[1:34:09] him certainly appreciate got this
[1:34:17] working everything down our famous
[1:34:20] sister Rachel I see you sister Erica you
[1:34:24] coming back okay second round we came to
[1:34:36] bless you
[1:34:54] but just to go back I was telling me ma
[1:34:58] about what happened as far as getting
[1:35:00] the house and everything
[1:35:02] mutt specters oh and she said you need
[1:35:05] to tell that testimony in church eyes oh
[1:35:06] well we did and she said I don't think
[1:35:10] it came across like that next time we
[1:35:12] have a testimony sir tell them in church
[1:35:14] so I said okay so Stephen said go tell
[1:35:17] testimony about the house and so I was
[1:35:21] like okay I'm telling oh because a lot
[1:35:24] of it really was surrounded around God
[1:35:27] making away from me and that ended up
[1:35:31] making away for us
[1:35:33] but back in December we actually put
[1:35:37] money down on a house we were gonna get
[1:35:40] it and it just kind of seemed like the
[1:35:43] people were dragging their feet and it
[1:35:45] felt like it was on purpose because they
[1:35:46] made a sign a paper that said basically
[1:35:49] if everything doesn't go through by this
[1:35:51] time we couldn't get a refund are we
[1:35:54] gonna get our money back for it but then
[1:35:57] the ball was in their court and they
[1:35:59] weren't moving and they were saying oh
[1:36:00] it's the holidays we can't and we're
[1:36:02] like well then give us our money back or
[1:36:04] give an extension on this they wouldn't
[1:36:06] do it so we said forget it we're just
[1:36:08] poor money and we really thought that
[1:36:13] was the place like we really thought
[1:36:14] that was the place and it wasn't and we
[1:36:16] were just kind of trying to figure out
[1:36:17] well if that isn't it then what is it
[1:36:19] and we started talking and saying god we
[1:36:22] want a new bill like we want to be able
[1:36:23] to walk in and pick out everything that
[1:36:26] we want in the house and have them put
[1:36:28] it together and we'll move in and so God
[1:36:31] made a way for us to stumble upon what
[1:36:35] we have now and it hadn't been built yet
[1:36:37] and
[1:36:38] we picked a lot of pic number two we did
[1:36:43] no purpose and so they told us that was
[1:36:47] in January they told us all right you're
[1:36:49] gonna move in in July so we said well
[1:36:52] you know good so the way that they had
[1:36:54] it set up a lot of newer homes when
[1:36:57] they're being built they say give you
[1:37:00] like incentives and one of the
[1:37:01] incentives that they had was to forget
[1:37:04] to be home we'll pay all your closing
[1:37:05] costs up to a certain number and so we
[1:37:11] got we've got with the the well up until
[1:37:15] that point we were basically being told
[1:37:18] that Stephen was the only one that could
[1:37:22] be on the loan because even though our
[1:37:26] bank my deposits into the bank was
[1:37:29] showing I was making money
[1:37:31] the my taxes because of the way I wrote
[1:37:34] my taxes it wasn't showing that like I
[1:37:37] was below poverty level
[1:37:39] so I couldn't be on the loan at all so
[1:37:41] we would have to do everything through
[1:37:42] Stephen and because of that they were
[1:37:44] telling us we were going to need like
[1:37:46] eleven thousand dollars in addition to
[1:37:48] closing costs and everything else like
[1:37:49] that and we were just like a man in
[1:37:52] addition to our down payment and all the
[1:37:54] other stuff that we were just like you
[1:37:55] know we don't want to have to pay that
[1:37:57] so coming up on that time you know we
[1:38:02] just said you know we're gonna we're
[1:38:03] gonna pick the house we're gonna do
[1:38:04] everything right we're gonna believe God
[1:38:06] to make a way that's it
[1:38:07] because we were holding on to what
[1:38:09] brother Jack had said go out and get
[1:38:10] what you want and God will take care of
[1:38:12] it
[1:38:13] so we said we're just gonna hold on to
[1:38:14] that we repeated that so many times
[1:38:16] throughout the journey brother Jack said
[1:38:18] brother Jack said it brother Jack said
[1:38:19] and so um
[1:38:21] during this time we wanted to also go to
[1:38:24] a brother Simba's wedding and because
[1:38:27] they were getting married and man we had
[1:38:28] already decided we also were going to
[1:38:30] take an anniversary trip we wanted to do
[1:38:32] all of that so we said well since we're
[1:38:34] gonna be over there why don't we go to
[1:38:36] Paris too and then one of the sisters
[1:38:39] from South Africa was like well since
[1:38:41] you're gonna be in Africa why don't you
[1:38:44] come down
[1:38:44] here too and so we had planned that was
[1:38:48] our plan we hadn't bought the tickets
[1:38:50] but we sat down and prayed and we said
[1:38:52] God we want to go on this trip we want
[1:38:54] to take an anniversary trip but we got
[1:38:56] this mountain in front of us and we had
[1:38:59] prayed for God to do something real
[1:39:00] specific to let us know that we could
[1:39:03] take this trip and come back and
[1:39:05] everything was going to be okay and he
[1:39:07] did it so we said all right we took the
[1:39:09] trip we went over there we enjoyed
[1:39:11] ourselves we came back but before we
[1:39:13] left they had approved everything they
[1:39:16] told us we need a certain amount of
[1:39:17] money but they told they I asked him I
[1:39:21] got an idea and I said well if I get a
[1:39:23] new job will that change anything and
[1:39:26] they said yeah that'll change everything
[1:39:28] you get a new job I didn't look because
[1:39:31] I didn't want a new job I loved working
[1:39:33] for me most company that's what I wanted
[1:39:36] to do and I was very happy
[1:39:39] so I told God I said well god I believe
[1:39:43] you can make away with me being right
[1:39:44] here because I don't want to move and I
[1:39:47] said if you want me to move from here
[1:39:49] for this season you're gonna have to
[1:39:52] pick me up and move me out of here
[1:39:54] because I'm not moving I'm not looking
[1:39:55] for a job and so one day I was sitting
[1:39:58] in my car and I got a email that said it
[1:40:02] was a scouting company never signed up
[1:40:04] for one and they said we're we're
[1:40:06] looking for someone to fill this
[1:40:08] position that I didn't tell me the
[1:40:09] company or anything like that I thought
[1:40:11] those were like scams but for some
[1:40:14] reason I said okay I'm gonna respond to
[1:40:16] this one and so I went on ahead I
[1:40:18] responded and they asked me if I could
[1:40:21] come in and I came in and I interviewed
[1:40:23] and I told you all about that the lady
[1:40:25] of she was like I really really like you
[1:40:27] and I think you're gonna fit in good
[1:40:29] here
[1:40:30] and so I went through the interview
[1:40:33] process with the company and I ended up
[1:40:35] getting the job and when I got the job
[1:40:38] the day of the weekend before me going
[1:40:41] into the job
[1:40:42] I cried I was just walking around the
[1:40:45] house I was sad I was like I don't want
[1:40:47] to leave me Mom I don't wanna leave a
[1:40:49] family company I just don't and the Lord
[1:40:52] led me to these scriptures the first
[1:40:55] scripture that came to mind was when um
[1:40:58] Mordecai told Esther and who knoweth
[1:41:01] whether thou are coming to the kingdom
[1:41:02] for such a time as this that was the
[1:41:04] first scripture that came to mind and
[1:41:06] also during that weekend the scripture
[1:41:09] of the day during that weekend was um in
[1:41:12] Exodus 33 15 it said and he said unto
[1:41:15] him if I presidents go not if that
[1:41:19] presidents go not with me carry us not
[1:41:21] up hits and I said God if this isn't
[1:41:25] where you want me to be then don't take
[1:41:27] me don't but if this is where you want
[1:41:30] me to be then giving me the strength of
[1:41:31] just endure to go through and I got
[1:41:33] there and it has been amazing it has
[1:41:38] been truly amazing my I was in a meeting
[1:41:42] with the CEO Oh and he said you are the
[1:41:45] fastest moving person that we have ever
[1:41:48] hired you're just moving up there it's
[1:41:50] quicker than anyone and I was in a
[1:41:52] meeting with the CEO and the CEO who
[1:41:57] walked in and he said you know she's
[1:41:58] gonna run this office one day you you
[1:42:00] all just watch and he he kind of laughed
[1:42:02] and he said no no I'm serious she is
[1:42:05] gonna run this office one day and the
[1:42:07] CBO said well praise the Lord praise the
[1:42:09] Lord all right and I was just like okay
[1:42:11] and that's your thing they say praise
[1:42:12] the Lord and they mend everything so um
[1:42:14] so um God has just really really been
[1:42:18] blessing me I'm this this month I'm
[1:42:22] supposed to be meeting with my boss and
[1:42:23] the CEO to get a promotion
[1:42:30] I'm really excited about that and even
[1:42:33] then they've got some other positions
[1:42:36] opening that they've already told me
[1:42:37] they want me to step into which is
[1:42:39] higher than the company but they told
[1:42:42] him I said well I'm just gonna kind of
[1:42:44] ride in and see what happens and we'll
[1:42:46] see you know the Lord leads and even one
[1:42:48] another sister from another church I was
[1:42:51] able to get her in to get a job and on
[1:42:54] Monday a young lady came into the job
[1:42:56] and she had on a skirt and um and she
[1:42:59] said Betty works with me and she said
[1:43:01] you know I see you and Betty come in
[1:43:04] here every day with your skirts and I
[1:43:05] said if Rachel and Betty can wear a
[1:43:08] skirt I can wear a skirt wearing skirts
[1:43:13] to work right so she said that to me and
[1:43:16] then later Betty won't talk to me she
[1:43:17] said notice Katie had on a skirt and I
[1:43:19] said yeah go talk to and so she wouldn't
[1:43:21] talk to her and she said it's saying her
[1:43:22] to say the same thing to Benny and it
[1:43:24] was just to me that was just amazing
[1:43:25] that we were just being us you know but
[1:43:28] we didn't even realize somebody was
[1:43:29] watching that and she came in with her
[1:43:32] skirt so anyways when I got the job we
[1:43:35] sent the the the offer letter off to the
[1:43:39] people for the for the house and we said
[1:43:43] this this should be good and we were
[1:43:45] going through a different company than
[1:43:46] the the people that we're building the
[1:43:48] home you're going through a different
[1:43:49] mortgage company but they said hey as
[1:43:51] long as the terms are the same will
[1:43:53] honor that will honor it and we'll still
[1:43:55] pay the closing costs well when we added
[1:43:57] me on to the loan it changed the terms
[1:44:00] we didn't realize that until right
[1:44:03] before we were leaving for the wedding
[1:44:05] um maybe maybe not even a week before we
[1:44:08] leave it for later by this time we had a
[1:44:10] closing date that was like 21 days away
[1:44:13] and our company the company is building
[1:44:17] a home calls us and said we aren't
[1:44:19] paying your closing costs because the
[1:44:20] terms aren't the same we were like wait
[1:44:22] what what happened and they said well
[1:44:24] when you added Rachel to the loan you
[1:44:26] change the terms so we're not playing
[1:44:27] your pay your closing costs so we said
[1:44:29] well if you if we go through you then
[1:44:33] can we do the closing costs like that I
[1:44:36] mean would we be able to get it like
[1:44:37] that and they said yeah but your your
[1:44:38] date is like 20 days away
[1:44:41] and y'all are going out of town y'all
[1:44:43] want across the country so we're not
[1:44:45] gonna be a minute out of the country so
[1:44:46] we're not gonna be able to we may not be
[1:44:48] able to do this so we said all right
[1:44:51] we're just gonna believe God we said
[1:44:52] start the process and we'll see what
[1:44:54] happens so while we were over there we
[1:44:56] were just praying that God would make
[1:44:57] away God would make away and when we got
[1:44:59] back I mean they move so quick we closed
[1:45:03] in like two weeks
[1:45:04] okay by the time we got back since in
[1:45:06] our paperwork got everything done we
[1:45:08] closed they told us we had to get the
[1:45:10] insurance on the home and everything
[1:45:12] like that they messed up the insurance
[1:45:14] stuff royally and the day before we were
[1:45:17] supposed to do our walkthrough to the
[1:45:21] house make sure everything was okay
[1:45:22] the insurance stuff went through
[1:45:24] everything went through for the
[1:45:25] insurance and so when we sat down to
[1:45:28] actually close on the house they started
[1:45:31] talking us about the finances they said
[1:45:32] so we paid your closing costs but you
[1:45:35] had extra money left over so we paid
[1:45:38] your encho HOA for almost a year
[1:45:40] but you had extra money left over so we
[1:45:43] paid your your insurance for a year but
[1:45:46] you had extra money left over so we put
[1:45:48] the rest towards a down payment for your
[1:45:50] house so your down payment plus this
[1:45:52] brings your price down to this and the
[1:45:54] number I had in my head that I wanted us
[1:45:56] to pay monthly was the number it all
[1:45:58] came out soon and oh yeah so when they
[1:46:07] paid everything down and they rely and
[1:46:09] then because we're doing this they did a
[1:46:11] whole bunch of stuff nearly we're gonna
[1:46:12] drop your interest rate too so then they
[1:46:14] dropped our interest rate
[1:46:17] [Applause]
[1:46:19] yeah it was it was a really really big
[1:46:22] blessing so we leave we've come in and
[1:46:25] just been like ahead of the game moving
[1:46:27] into the house and things of that nature
[1:46:29] it's been like a real blessing um that
[1:46:32] God was able to bring all of that
[1:46:34] together in just such a short amount of
[1:46:36] time
[1:46:37] we didn't even ace we didn't know we
[1:46:39] don't know how so this is date how it
[1:46:40] all came together and how God just made
[1:46:42] away and we didn't pay a penny more than
[1:46:44] what we wanted to spend we didn't need a
[1:46:46] penny more than what once it's been that
[1:46:48] God just gave an overabundance of money
[1:46:51] to where they had to basically find
[1:46:52] places to put money in order to just
[1:46:56] take up that amount and that that really
[1:46:58] just helped out tremendously so we were
[1:47:01] in the house for a couple of months and
[1:47:02] this even comes to me and he says I want
[1:47:05] to get you a new car no I loved my car
[1:47:09] I had no problem with my car until some
[1:47:12] people had a problem with my car but I
[1:47:15] love my car I loved it and I told him I
[1:47:17] don't want a new car buy a new car and
[1:47:19] he said that for a couple months I want
[1:47:21] to get you in your car I want to get you
[1:47:22] in their car so eventually I told him I
[1:47:24] said on I'll go to the dealership with
[1:47:27] you I'll go so we went to the dealership
[1:47:29] and I found a car way out of our price
[1:47:32] range and I said well that's the only
[1:47:34] car I like and he said well we can't get
[1:47:36] that and I said well we just can't get a
[1:47:38] new car and so he left and then I
[1:47:41] started looking and I was like okay you
[1:47:42] know I'll look in outlook so we went
[1:47:45] back to the look at another car that I
[1:47:47] said if we get a new car I can I can do
[1:47:49] this I can do this so we went back to
[1:47:51] the look at that and I told the guy said
[1:47:53] you have this car on your site and he
[1:47:56] said um well I I don't see it in our
[1:48:00] life but it's on your site so it's got
[1:48:03] to be here somewhere
[1:48:03] and he said well he he when he checked
[1:48:06] it out he said oh no it's at a
[1:48:08] maintenance place something or another
[1:48:09] and it'll be back here tomorrow which
[1:48:13] was a Friday and he said come back
[1:48:14] tomorrow I said
[1:48:15] Church I can't come back he said we'll
[1:48:17] come back Saturday knew he had something
[1:48:18] going on Saturday I don't remember what
[1:48:19] it was I said can't come back he said
[1:48:21] well what about Sunday I said well I got
[1:48:23] Church I can't come back and and that
[1:48:26] Sunday was like a packed Sunday so we
[1:48:28] couldn't come back he's like you do have
[1:48:30] to go to church yes like yeah we're not
[1:48:32] coming here instead of going to church
[1:48:34] that's just not happening so Steven saw
[1:48:36] some trucks sitting over to the side and
[1:48:38] he said well while you talk to him I'm
[1:48:39] just gonna go look at these trucks and
[1:48:41] he walked over and um I'm just talking
[1:48:45] to the guy talking to the guy and I
[1:48:46] noticed Steven just ain't came back and
[1:48:48] I'm like okay so I look back and I see
[1:48:50] him standing by my car now and he's like
[1:48:53] you know yeah I said okay and it's just
[1:48:55] his car just sitting all by itself off
[1:48:57] to the side away from all the rest of
[1:48:59] the parts and I come over I'm looking at
[1:49:01] it I'm like I like this this is real
[1:49:03] nice but man I don't need a new car I
[1:49:06] don't want it on and she was like no I
[1:49:09] think I think I think there was no
[1:49:12] paperwork on the car so the guy had no
[1:49:14] clue what the car was or anything he had
[1:49:16] to go inside and try to figure out the
[1:49:18] paperwork going into pricing and all
[1:49:20] that other stuff so I had another number
[1:49:22] in my head I was like this is how much I
[1:49:23] want to pay for the monthly payments
[1:49:25] this is where I want to be and I found
[1:49:27] another car that I liked and we pulled
[1:49:30] that one up next to this one now and I
[1:49:32] just looked back and forth and I was
[1:49:34] like that's my car that's my car so make
[1:49:38] the numbers work we went inside they
[1:49:40] made all the numbers where they didn't
[1:49:41] we didn't even have to go back and forth
[1:49:43] with them what I had in my head where we
[1:49:45] want it to be that's where the numbers
[1:49:47] ended up coming out anyway
[1:49:48] so we didn't even have to go back and
[1:49:50] forth and I got my new car
[1:49:56] and so I'm like super grateful for how
[1:50:00] God has just worked in our lives this
[1:50:02] entire year it's just kind of amazing
[1:50:04] listening knowing that at the beginning
[1:50:06] of the year so many people were praying
[1:50:08] for cars and in homes and to hear us all
[1:50:11] come back and say I got a house I got
[1:50:13] houses I got a house thing I got a car
[1:50:14] you know back and forth I also want to
[1:50:16] just thank God even for when we were
[1:50:19] having communion on Sunday and we heard
[1:50:22] all the brothers worshiping over here
[1:50:24] and the sisters were like you know we
[1:50:26] thank God for that and I thought back
[1:50:28] and I think I was for it either
[1:50:30] sister Rebekah sister Sarah like there
[1:50:32] was a time where it was only brother
[1:50:34] Jack and Caleb thank you you know just
[1:50:35] the two of them and now it was like just
[1:50:38] a roar of brothers over there it's I
[1:50:41] just really thank God for just bringing
[1:50:43] so many brothers and not just that like
[1:50:46] you know the prayers that we have and
[1:50:48] the services that we've had and the fast
[1:50:51] set the fast thing that we do together
[1:50:53] as a church I see the the changes within
[1:50:56] the church I see the changes in the
[1:50:59] character of the church the growth of
[1:51:02] the church and then I see restoration
[1:51:04] like little things that I see God just
[1:51:07] her story and people that I see God
[1:51:09] we're sorry that you know it's nothing
[1:51:11] that God that just brought back in and a
[1:51:14] lot of times like God makes subtle
[1:51:17] changes and we'll miss them you know
[1:51:20] we'll miss it but it's like we're I
[1:51:23] don't know if we're expecting a mass
[1:51:25] group to just come in and we're missing
[1:51:28] the little things and the subtle changes
[1:51:31] that he
[1:51:31] I mean I just looked around on Sunday
[1:51:34] and I was like wow you know Wow God you
[1:51:38] God did that thing you did that thing
[1:51:42] and I'm just truly grateful where I see
[1:51:44] that God has just blessed our church of
[1:51:46] the year of the incredible wasn't just
[1:51:47] natural even though the majority of the
[1:51:50] church god I mean when we come to church
[1:51:52] that parking lot
[1:51:53] that's a beautiful parking beautiful
[1:51:57] parking lot God really blessed us all
[1:51:59] naturally but um yeah I see the
[1:52:01] spiritual things as well and I'm just
[1:52:03] truly grateful that God has answered so
[1:52:05] many prayers that we've had even over
[1:52:07] the years and just thanking God for the
[1:52:09] new church and he's gonna take us into
[1:52:10] and and looking at the numbers I mean I
[1:52:13] remember coming to church in here and
[1:52:15] about the building fund hearing about
[1:52:17] the building fund and then it just
[1:52:18] seemed like something just clicked and
[1:52:20] we all just work together and every time
[1:52:23] I see those numbers I just get
[1:52:24] encouraged I got is just gonna do
[1:52:25] something great for us if he can give us
[1:52:28] houses he can give us a house I truly
[1:52:32] believe that I have to just add on to
[1:52:43] substance Rachel said when we know those
[1:52:46] numbers and this will oh it'll be more
[1:52:51] in Jane wears out I'll tell you where it

[1:52:57] haven't given you up 2018 plus 2019
[1:53:00] numbers but we have a little over
[1:53:05] seventy thousand dollars in the bank
[1:53:07] [Applause]
[1:53:11] we're building it fun this church has
[1:53:14] never never had money like that so when
[1:53:19] we say you're incredible I had this I
[1:53:22] just get incurred I'm no God Gary do
[1:53:24] some with that money I know a church
[1:53:25] some such somebody got the sale you know

[1:53:42] time and I can't have everybody come and
[1:53:44] sneak attack I ain't know your head you
[1:53:48] had your testimony okay I don't right
[1:53:50] praise the Lord
[1:53:51] all right a mate after after my wife I
[1:53:54] got one more and that's gonna be it for
[1:53:56] tonight all right but anyway there's
[1:54:23] nothing on my heart for a reason
[1:54:26] most likely the Lord wanted to share and
[1:54:29] I've just been thinking it at home and I
[1:54:31] said you know I love to share that
[1:54:33] testimony with a young people but it was
[1:54:38] way back in the eighties sure they after
[1:54:41] I come into the mess and not too long I
[1:54:44] just stayed in them books and tapes and
[1:54:48] all my kids come when I first call went
[1:54:51] to sister Lewis house and I was sitting
[1:54:53] she got to take the plan and it's not
[1:54:58] the testimony but I promise I'm gonna
[1:55:00] punish door and I was just God
[1:55:04] you know she was talking about something
[1:55:06] else and I'm trying to listen to the
[1:55:08] church but to the to the tape because
[1:55:10] that just felt some connection just like
[1:55:13] some kind of you know
[1:55:14] something the current making connection
[1:55:17] there and I'm like and I start to get in
[1:55:21] the hotel it was books and getting in
[1:55:23] them and oh this is what I've been
[1:55:26] praying for this what I've been looking
[1:55:28] searching for here or there I mean from
[1:55:31] place to place on the women preacher and
[1:55:34] all but anyway it was in the late
[1:55:39] eighties after had you know got sell it
[1:55:43] in the mess that you know I wasn't
[1:55:46] working at that time
[1:55:47] I was supposed to be storing at home for
[1:55:52] making a living but I wasn't after I get
[1:55:55] the kids off to school I would uh don't
[1:55:59] do my devotion for it's getting them
[1:56:01] books and when I look up the kids coming
[1:56:07] home from school and I'm still sitting
[1:56:09] there with the book and I had such a
[1:56:13] burden for my family all my family you
[1:56:16] know to be safe to come into this and
[1:56:18] one day I don't remember what message
[1:56:21] I'm sorry my little horse uh I don't
[1:56:24] remember what message I was reading but
[1:56:28] I just tears running down and I said
[1:56:32] Lord we need him here now
[1:56:37] now and that still small voice you know
[1:56:41] that when he speaks you will know you
[1:56:44] know it's it's he and but it's I don't
[1:56:49] know I get a looking fused on this part
[1:56:51] oh I don't remember if he said but he is
[1:56:55] I mean the still small voice you know it
[1:56:59] said that he is and I don't remember if
[1:57:02] he said but he is all he is here now you
[1:57:05] know you didn't say it here now he just
[1:57:09] said but he he's here not right and it
[1:57:13] was so real today and I can immediately
[1:57:15] I knew that it was from the Lord and it
[1:57:18] just it just said something over me and
[1:57:21] I would just just oh it's just so
[1:57:24] amazing because I never had that
[1:57:27] experience and I was just excited and
[1:57:31] about a year after that the word for
[1:57:36] word I heard it come over the uptake and
[1:57:40] I'm like wow that's the confirmation you
[1:57:42] know even though I did at that time when
[1:57:46] that first happened I had already heard
[1:57:48] enough about the Prophet and gotten a
[1:57:50] message enough to know that this is what
[1:57:53] I was looking for this is what something
[1:57:55] in me had been calling for him to know
[1:57:58] that he was really a true prophet of God
[1:58:00] but then after I heard it all on a tape
[1:58:04] by the year later I heard that heard it
[1:58:07] again on the tape of the second time and
[1:58:09] I said while I didn't need a
[1:58:11] confirmation but he gave me the to
[1:58:13] confirmation you know and I've been on
[1:58:16] the tackle of the
[1:58:17] lately attacking my body but you know
[1:58:20] when the enemy comes it don't phrase me
[1:58:23] because I know he's here he's in control
[1:58:28] and I thank him every day for calories
[1:58:33] because my healing was then that my
[1:58:35] Redemption and I just I have so many
[1:58:39] things I could share with y'all that
[1:58:42] tells the moment like how God uphill
[1:58:44] matured and I wouldn't dare use the
[1:58:46] wouldn't dare go to the doctor stop
[1:58:48] taking my children I had to slip around
[1:58:50] and pray for them because my husband
[1:58:52] would be fussing but anyway God how did
[1:58:56] it
[1:59:04] [Applause]
[1:59:10] [Applause]
[1:59:14] boy did that thing that's alright
[1:59:17] a man sister Erica a man we'll have you
[1:59:20] come at this time
[1:59:21] praise the Lord god bless you I'll make
[1:59:31] this quick um I actually thought about
[1:59:36] it and then I was like you've already
[1:59:37] shared it so I'm just gonna leave it but
[1:59:40] but I thought about it again when my
[1:59:43] mother said how we actually my mom and
[1:59:48] sister Charisse how they were talking
[1:59:50] about the accidents and just being on
[1:59:52] the road and praying and all of that you
[1:59:54] know and how we pray for you know kind
[1:59:57] of specific things you know Lord be an
[1:59:59] angel you know I mean set your angels
[2:00:03] around us too you know and in your mind
[2:00:05] you're thinking you know accidents or
[2:00:07] you know reckless drivers things like
[2:00:09] that you don't think of other things and
[2:00:12] so I just wanted to thank God for
[2:00:16] something I shared it with the sisters
[2:00:18] and the sister group the other night but
[2:00:20] um I want to thank God for something
[2:00:23] that happened on Monday night to me I
[2:00:27] was on my way home Monday night from
[2:00:30] downtown I had gone to the Kravis Center
[2:00:31] for something for the volunteer place
[2:00:36] that I go to out at the fairgrounds so I
[2:00:40] went to to this event and was on my way
[2:00:43] back home and you know the time has
[2:00:44] changed so it's dark at night so I was
[2:00:46] on my way back home and as I'm coming
[2:00:49] down Okeechobee Boulevard I know I hear
[2:00:53] somebody blowing and it's two cars as we
[2:00:55] were turning onto Okeechobee as two
[2:00:57] turning lanes the two cars I guess I'm
[2:00:59] assuming because I was a little ahead of
[2:01:01] them I'm assuming like one turned into
[2:01:03] the other person's lane and that's why
[2:01:05] they're blue so you know I looked in my
[2:01:07] rearview mirror and I see that and then
[2:01:09] I see a car speed up you know ahead of
[2:01:12] me like to get around that
[2:01:14] then that card got in and got in front
[2:01:16] of me so it's you know it's these three
[2:01:20] cars in line so I'm just driving along
[2:01:21] and all of a sudden that car that's in
[2:01:24] front of me kind of goes over to the
[2:01:27] right lane like he's gonna get on to 95
[2:01:29] from Okeechobee Boulevard and then all
[2:01:31] of a sudden he goes goes right over into
[2:01:33] the left lane and stops in the left lane
[2:01:36] nobody was over there
[2:01:37] so I'm look I'm you know as I'm he stops
[2:01:40] I'm like this person has lost what are
[2:01:42] they doing you know so I just kind of
[2:01:44] slowed down a little bit and went by
[2:01:46] them you know just went on buying my
[2:01:47] lane so I'm seeing as we're coming up
[2:01:50] that traffic is just a mess and I'm
[2:01:52] thinking you know in my mind is six
[2:01:54] o'clock
[2:01:54] something that's the downtown traffic
[2:01:56] and all of that so I'm going and now the
[2:02:00] traffic's starting to get a little heavy
[2:02:01] and that car gets over and gets behind
[2:02:04] me and it's right up on me so um the
[2:02:08] traffic is getting heavy and everybody's
[2:02:10] emerging over to the left lane so I'm in
[2:02:12] the center lane and at this point it had
[2:02:14] opened up to like I think the five lanes
[2:02:16] where you can get on 295 so everybody's
[2:02:18] kind of coming over so so I move over
[2:02:22] just to kind of head off you know and
[2:02:25] get around everybody else that's trying
[2:02:27] to come over and that car moves over
[2:02:28] behind me then I ended up having to move
[2:02:31] over again because the cards from over
[2:02:33] here we're trying to get over so I moved
[2:02:35] over again the car moved again behind me
[2:02:37] so at this point now I'm looking I'm
[2:02:40] looking at this car so we're coming and
[2:02:42] then I move over again and that car gets
[2:02:44] behind me again so so at this point I'm
[2:02:48] really like okay so as we're getting
[2:02:51] ready to go over the hill um I see that
[2:02:55] you know now I can see what's going on
[2:02:57] and down the hill at the PD right in
[2:03:00] front of the PDQ it's a big accident so
[2:03:02] that's why the traffic's all coming
[2:03:03] together because is you know the
[2:03:05] firetruck and all this stuff is you know
[2:03:07] in the road so all the traffic is coming
[2:03:09] together so I get over to you know to
[2:03:11] get into the lane that's you know that's
[2:03:14] open that car comes over and gets behind
[2:03:16] me so I'm sitting there you know and we
[2:03:18] can't go anywhere the light is green but
[2:03:20] it's just it's traffic everywhere all
[2:03:23] around me so this car sitting behind me
[2:03:25] so um I was looking down and I looked up
[2:03:28] and then I looked down I looked down at
[2:03:30] my phone for a split second next thing I
[2:03:31] know somebody comes and knocks on the
[2:03:33] door and knocks on the window so I look
[2:03:36] and there's a guy standing there and so
[2:03:37] I you know so I wrote down my window
[2:03:41] like this and and I looked at him but
[2:03:44] then I'm thinking okay you know all
[2:03:46] these cars around ain't nothing you know
[2:03:48] so I rolled it down a little bit more
[2:03:50] and he goes hey how you doing I'm like
[2:03:52] I'm fine and he's like I'm I don't know
[2:03:54] if you noticed that I kept getting
[2:03:55] behind you and I said yeah and I said I
[2:03:58] did actually and he says well um the
[2:04:00] reason I was on the phone use because
[2:04:01] your um your your backlight it's
[2:04:04] blinking your backlight is blinking and
[2:04:06] I said my black backlight and he said
[2:04:09] yeah it's flashing and you know and I
[2:04:11] said well which one and he said you know
[2:04:13] my side and I said okay and he said well
[2:04:15] it's police all around you you can't be
[2:04:17] too careful you know how they are and
[2:04:18] you know you just got to be careful and
[2:04:20] I said okay thank you I appreciate it
[2:04:23] he's like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[2:04:25] that's that's why I'm all behind you
[2:04:26] like that and I was like okay so I just
[2:04:28] rolled my window up and you know when
[2:04:30] the traffic starts going so I go and as
[2:04:33] I'm going he's following me still so by
[2:04:37] this time is the traffic is is it's
[2:04:39] flowing but it's very heavy so my car
[2:04:43] can go really fast
[2:04:44] so I found an open lane and I just took
[2:04:47] off I took off and I took off and then I
[2:04:50] moved over into a lane right quick and
[2:04:53] he he got over and took off tried to
[2:04:55] take off behind me but he got stuck it
[2:04:57] was a slower car that I moved over in
[2:04:59] front of so he got stuck and we got
[2:05:01] stopped at another light and you know
[2:05:02] and I just tried to keep an eye keep an
[2:05:05] eye on his headlights but his car was
[2:05:07] black and it was dark so I really
[2:05:09] couldn't tell you know so I just took
[2:05:11] off and I just you know kept going down
[2:05:13] Okeechobee and I said you know what I'm
[2:05:14] not going home so I turned into
[2:05:17] I turned into that old Kmart please' and
[2:05:19] I just drove around the plaza and
[2:05:21] stopped like I was getting that and then
[2:05:23] went somewhere else and stopped like I
[2:05:25] was getting out and Dean came over and
[2:05:26] finally I stopped somewhere where it was
[2:05:28] well-lit and I got out and I went into
[2:05:30] the store and so I stayed in the store a
[2:05:33] little while probably about 20 minutes
[2:05:35] and then you know I came out gingerly
[2:05:37] looking in the parking lot and went on
[2:05:39] and got back in the car and you know and
[2:05:41] came on home and watched as I came home
[2:05:43] you know but um I was telling him you
[2:05:46] know I told him and he was like no that
[2:05:48] don't sound right you know and I was
[2:05:49] thinking the same thing that did not
[2:05:50] sound right so I said you know what
[2:05:52] Laura thank you for forgiving me just
[2:05:57] having me conscious of my surroundings
[2:06:00] you know as a as a woman you you kind of
[2:06:03] always are but sometimes things like
[2:06:05] that you don't really think about you
[2:06:06] know you think of like I said before you
[2:06:08] think about accidents you think about
[2:06:10] reckless drivers drunk drivers you think
[2:06:12] about all that stuff but you don't think
[2:06:13] about you know there's truly some evil
[2:06:16] people in this world and they they mean
[2:06:18] you know good you know you don't think
[2:06:20] about those things so I just thank God
[2:06:22] for just putting it in me to even pay
[2:06:26] attention to this car moving by cuz you
[2:06:29] know I listen when I'm ready to get home
[2:06:32] I'm just going home you know but putting
[2:06:34] I saw it from the beginning to the end I
[2:06:38] saw exactly when he started following me
[2:06:40] and all of that and I just thank God for
[2:06:42] for him just giving me the you know the
[2:06:45] conscious thought to actually see this
[2:06:48] and to head it off before because I
[2:06:50] really honestly I truly scared me I
[2:06:53] really believe that that man meant me no
[2:06:55] good
[2:06:56] so I thank God for that that's one
[2:06:59] number two is we up here and we all have
[2:07:04] all these you know great things that
[2:07:06] we're thinking God for and you know a
[2:07:09] lot of times you know and these are
[2:07:11] things that maybe the little ones don't
[2:07:13] understand you know I mean a house a car
[2:07:15] you know new job you know sometimes
[2:07:19] that they don't understand it but it
[2:07:20] don't it doesn't translate because they
[2:07:21] don't want a house they don't want a car
[2:07:23] they don't want you know so I just I
[2:07:25] just knew I had to actually bring this
[2:07:28] particular one because first of all
[2:07:31] because it was something I was praying
[2:07:32] for and like brother brother Clinton
[2:07:35] said you know God even sees the smallest
[2:07:38] things you know and it was something
[2:07:40] that I was praying for it was something
[2:07:42] that I was not I mean my stomach was
[2:07:45] turning over but it's something that God
[2:07:48] showed up in and what it is y'all gonna
[2:07:51] probably laugh but my cat was sick okay
[2:07:54] he was sick and I he was sick and really
[2:08:02] I felt like he was sick unto death my
[2:08:04] cat
[2:08:05] you know many y'all don't know this
[2:08:07] y'all seen my cat before but I don't
[2:08:09] know I got that cat from josue years ago
[2:08:11] like literally almost 17 18 years ago I
[2:08:14] got this cat at six months old from
[2:08:16] Josue ok brother looks way I'm sorry and
[2:08:20] so my cat is literally 135 years old ok
[2:08:24] so um you know I just started thinking
[2:08:27] about one time before when he got sick
[2:08:30] and my girls were young they were like
[2:08:33] this age they were young and and and you
[2:08:36] know that the the vet told us that it
[2:08:39] was going to be this much and I was like
[2:08:41] it's a cat yeah that's just a thought
[2:08:45] that I had and they were like but can we
[2:08:48] pray can't you know and my oldest one
[2:08:51] when they got her piggy bank and had
[2:08:52] like five dollars in it it was like can
[2:08:54] we pay for this you know an event one is
[2:08:57] $500 okay you know so but you know we
[2:09:01] laugh at their but two kids that's
[2:09:03] something you know so um anyway my cat
[2:09:06] we put him out the house probably about
[2:09:09] three weeks ago okay he like I said he
[2:09:12] oh and he just had incontinence problems
[2:09:14] he was just going everywhere and so I
[2:09:17] had to put him out the house you know so
[2:09:19] we put them out how
[2:09:20] and I'm like it whatever it is it'll
[2:09:22] clear up and he'll be okay you know
[2:09:24] he'll be okay so well he wasn't getting
[2:09:27] okay I'm for it
[2:09:29] unfortunately escalated and then he he
[2:09:31] had blood in his urine and I was like oh
[2:09:33] my gosh his kidneys his kidney oh he did
[2:09:36] he's gonna die and I'm serious I just I
[2:09:38] would go and he can't hear all that well
[2:09:41] so I would go to the patio and knock on
[2:09:45] the patio and he wouldn't move and I'm
[2:09:46] like all he did it would just be I would
[2:09:51] literally wake up every morning and walk
[2:09:53] out there expecting to see him dead you
[2:09:55] know okay and and and and I was like you
[2:09:57] know what Lord I just I can't you know
[2:10:00] and for the sake of you know my yeah the
[2:10:03] girls are big grown they grow now but I
[2:10:06] just felt bad for them you know I was
[2:10:08] like and they were like take him to the
[2:10:09] duck you're gonna take him to the doctor
[2:10:11] now yeah I'm gonna take him but honestly
[2:10:13] y'all I kept putting off taking I've
[2:10:15] kept putting on taking him kept putting
[2:10:17] cuz I felt like they was gonna put my
[2:10:18] cat down and I just didn't wanna I
[2:10:20] didn't want to have to deal with that
[2:10:22] you know and so to anybody who have had
[2:10:24] pets you you understand hey put it this
[2:10:27] way you've had them and you love them
[2:10:29] okay you would understand how I feel so
[2:10:33] so anyway finally it came to the day
[2:10:36] different ones kept asking me you take a
[2:10:38] whisper you figure with yes okay you
[2:10:41] came to the day I took whisp okay so I
[2:10:43] took them to the doctor now y'all got to
[2:10:45] realize this cat is literally on his
[2:10:47] last life nine lives okay he done been
[2:10:50] through some stuff okay he done jumped
[2:10:53] off buildings up me
[2:10:55] buildings but I benefit I fell off the
[2:10:57] banister done he done did all kind of
[2:10:59] stuff y'all so I'm really thinking this
[2:11:01] it for him this it for him and so I go
[2:11:04] in we talked to the man what's the
[2:11:06] problem you know we talked to the
[2:11:07] receptionist guy and I'm telling them

[2:11:21] know we gotta take some blood tests and
[2:11:23] we gotta do your analysis and all of
[2:11:25] this stuff and and I thank God for those
[2:11:27] people because they were so sweet to him
[2:11:29] and he was comfortable you know I was
[2:11:31] afraid cuz he hate going in the car but
[2:11:34] he was very comfortable with him and
[2:11:35] everything so I'm just waiting on these
[2:11:37] tests to come back to say look you need
[2:11:39] to do something about this cat you know
[2:11:41] he's suffering he you know all of these
[2:11:43] things that they love to say you know so

[2:11:52] them comfortable their way and I'm like
[2:11:54] oh gosh you know so I'm just sitting
[2:11:56] there thinking thinking you know and
[2:11:58] just kind of praying to myself and all
[2:12:00] this time I've been trying to not act
[2:12:02] like a you know I've been trying to be
[2:12:04] the strong one
[2:12:05] you know I know yeah you know he'll be
[2:12:06] okay in my mind or whatever but I was
[2:12:09] really worried so anyway the doctor
[2:12:11] comes in he goes and he looks at him
[2:12:15] he's like boy you're a old fella aren't
[2:12:16] you you know and he's playing with him
[2:12:17] he goes um I'm gonna tell you for a cat

[2:12:24] and I'm late really and he said his
[2:12:26] kidneys are in great condition
[2:12:28] um he probably just has a little UTI or
[2:12:30] something we're gonna give him
[2:12:31] antibiotic for I mean he has a little
[2:12:33] heart murmur I mean eventually that
[2:12:35] might take him out but other than that
[2:12:36] I'm he's a good guy
[2:12:38] I'm surprised that he's in such good
[2:12:41] condition and I'm thinking to myself
[2:12:42] problem too and he's like just take them
[2:12:47] home given this for ten days and you
[2:12:49] know if that doesn't help bring them
[2:12:51] back and we'll see you know we'll see
[2:12:53] we'll see what happens but I mean he's
[2:12:55] in great condition and I'm like thank
[2:12:58] you Lord because I prayed I did pray for
[2:13:02] him and I think he prayed we prayed as a
[2:13:04] family for him and you know just
[2:13:07] something just that small this small to
[2:13:10] some you know it's small to some people
[2:13:12] to me is my dad but to some people it's
[2:13:14] like I was just so you know
[2:13:15] oh you know but you know it just it just
[2:13:19] goes to show like brother Quinton say
[2:13:20] God looks at the small things and the
[2:13:23] things that might be important to us
[2:13:25] might not be the same thing to them but
[2:13:28] just to show them that look God cares
[2:13:31] even about what's important but the
[2:13:34] thing that might seem small to us but
[2:13:35] what's important to you and your life
[2:13:37] God cares about it so don't think that
[2:13:41] anything is too small to pray for
[2:13:42] because God is listening and if it's
[2:13:45] important to you it's important to him
[2:13:49] [Applause]
[2:13:53] yeah Pok is a little lighter
[2:14:02] a man brother symbol is gonna be our
[2:14:08] last testimony tonight he's gonna come
[2:14:10] at this time and share praise the Lord
[2:14:12] baby man
[2:14:25] a small horoscope to me is that it was
[2:14:30] the same from up higher than the
[2:14:32] children of this reality
[2:14:38] later
[2:14:40] take a card the same thing on another
[2:14:43] tape
[2:14:50] same vilify he is here go bless you
[2:14:59] Saints
[2:15:01] such an encouragement to come here and
[2:15:04] just listen to all these testimonies you
[2:15:07] know what God is doing in his children's
[2:15:10] lives it's an encouragement because you
[2:15:14] know it's it proves to us that you know
[2:15:16] we're not doing this in vain you know
[2:15:19] we're not serving him in vain we're not
[2:15:21] praying in vain you know it was Tuesday
[2:15:24] night / if it's Tuesday night prayers
[2:15:26] prayers in our homes not praying the
[2:15:28] bank cuz he's offering those prayers and
[2:15:32] we know it also proves to us that you
[2:15:35] know he's still he's still living God
[2:15:36] you know he's still a protector you know
[2:15:41] he's still a HeLa healed brother Garen's
[2:15:45] back he's still provided up providing
[2:15:47] homes mat providing cause fighting jobs
[2:15:51] and even providing things that you know
[2:15:53] we didn't ask for that's providing
[2:15:55] businesses know so many things that you
[2:15:57] know that God is doing that just proves
[2:15:59] that he's still alive and we're not
[2:16:01] we're not serving him in in vain that's
[2:16:03] right and you know the the blessing of
[2:16:06] it is just knowing that we're a group of
[2:16:09] people that recognizes that that was God
[2:16:12] you know we we recognize and see that in
[2:16:15] all these things that was God because in
[2:16:18] in in you know the average personal you
[2:16:20] have a Christian they might not see God
[2:16:22] in the things that you're seeing God yes
[2:16:24] so that's kind of when my testimony is
[2:16:26] is coming from just recognizing and
[2:16:28] seeing God in just everything that
[2:16:31] happens around us and it's it's it's a
[2:16:34] continuation of the testimony that I
[2:16:37] gave last time we had a testimony
[2:16:38] service where I gave a testimony about
[2:16:41] how the Lord had spoken to me and given
[2:16:46] me a confirmation about which house to
[2:16:49] buy when I was in my husband house
[2:16:50] buying process
[2:16:52] and I come down to you know the last two
[2:16:55] houses that my wife and I really liked
[2:16:57] and you know I was kind of having mind
[2:16:59] battles of which one to choose and it
[2:17:03] was the first one that I got to see and
[2:17:05] the last one that I've gone to see and
[2:17:07] the last one happened to be the eighth
[2:17:09] one and solves you know it's just and I
[2:17:12] know things don't just happen by
[2:17:13] coincidence so you know I was wondering
[2:17:15] you know what you know what was the
[2:17:17] meaning behind number eight you know and
[2:17:20] I didn't know what the number eight
[2:17:20] meant and I prayed about it and I prayed
[2:17:23] about the whole process and that the
[2:17:25] same day I prayed the morning in the
[2:17:27] same day during the service it was on
[2:17:29] Sunday same day joint service God
[2:17:31] answered that prayer and used the
[2:17:34] preacher to to preach about the
[2:17:36] anointing of King David and how when he
[2:17:40] was when when Samuel have gone to
[2:17:42] Jesse's house they went through you know
[2:17:43] seven seven of his kids and it was on
[2:17:46] the eighth one that that's that's the he
[2:17:48] anointed David and I was wondering about
[2:17:51] eight nine pretty just prayed for God to
[2:17:52] tell me what you know the significance
[2:17:54] of eight was and then further Jack said
[2:17:57] you know you know eight is a special
[2:17:58] number it has meaning then he went ahead
[2:17:59] and told us what eight eight means which
[2:18:02] is new beginning for those that weren't
[2:18:04] there for me that was my confirmation
[2:18:06] because of just everything that had
[2:18:07] happened in my life you know leading up
[2:18:09] to that point with God changing my life
[2:18:12] to two years ago and just doing certain
[2:18:14] things and just getting me to that point
[2:18:16] and allowing me to leave saying losers
[2:18:19] you know so only city I've known since I
[2:18:21] moved to to the u.s. leaving my friends
[2:18:23] leaving my lifestyle there even leaving
[2:18:27] my family my brother's still there and
[2:18:29] just selling everything and packing
[2:18:30] everything the card coming here because
[2:18:32] I wanted to serve the Lord you know I
[2:18:34] wanted to be around you know a good
[2:18:36] church I want to be around good Saints
[2:18:37] you know so for me this was starting a
[2:18:39] new chapter and I was about to get
[2:18:40] married you know this is a new season in
[2:18:42] my life so so it really was a new
[2:18:45] beginning so anyway to to to carry on
[2:18:47] from there so I just you know when then
[2:18:51] I went when all that happened I was just
[2:18:53] sitting at home and I was just just just
[2:18:55] in all what God had done you know just
[2:18:58] thinking about you know just how surreal
[2:19:01] everything felt right
[2:19:02] just I was thinking myself I am I am I
[2:19:05] really here you know am I am I really
[2:19:08] working from home you know am I did I
[2:19:13] come here without having to jump through
[2:19:15] you know the the hurdles that someone
[2:19:18] would have to jump through is the a
[2:19:19] foreigner would have to jump through to
[2:19:20] change jobs and all that you know am I
[2:19:23] might now part of you know the best
[2:19:25] church you know am i around you know the
[2:19:28] some of the best people I know come on
[2:19:30] you know you know and I just buy a house
[2:19:33] and I you know am I about to get married
[2:19:35] you know all these things and just think
[2:19:38] about it just felt so surreal and I
[2:19:39] remember telling my friends that a man I
[2:19:41] I I'm truly living my dream you know
[2:19:44] and that's that's best is really how I
[2:19:46] felt and that's how I felt all this time
[2:19:48] and so in all that I was just looking
[2:19:50] back at how God had worked everything
[2:19:52] out and just given me a system change
[2:19:55] you know two years prior you know and
[2:19:57] how he just worked everything out since
[2:19:59] then and how he had even like exceeded
[2:20:02] my expectations you know and how he had
[2:20:04] been in you know little details about
[2:20:07] the journey you know I was just looking
[2:20:09] at all of that and I was just thinking
[2:20:10] to myself man you know God God is good
[2:20:13] you know and so it's nice thing about
[2:20:15] you know all that stuff there's a
[2:20:17] thought that that that came to me and
[2:20:20] that thought was that you know there's
[2:20:23] more to your house number than just a
[2:20:27] house number right right but when I
[2:20:30] thought at first you know I just thought
[2:20:31] it was a thought you know I thought
[2:20:33] maybe I was just riding off of the whole
[2:20:34] eight things so now I'm trying to look
[2:20:36] for things so I didn't think too much of
[2:20:37] it and you know as you know they went
[2:20:41] weeks went that thought just kept coming
[2:20:43] back into this and there's more to your
[2:20:45] house number than just the house number
[2:20:46] and I now brush it's a brushed aside and
[2:20:48] before you know that thought is back
[2:20:50] again so because it can reoccur in I I
[2:20:53] was like Manhattan maybe I should look
[2:20:55] into what you know my help me know the
[2:20:58] meaning of my house number and so my
[2:20:59] house numbers 320 and so I thought
[2:21:04] myself you know I mean we know there's
[2:21:07] certain numbers in the Bible that just
[2:21:09] that's you know that they're mentioned a
[2:21:11] lot of times that have me
[2:21:12] you can thing you know the number three
[2:21:13] you know number five you know seven you
[2:21:15] know eight that I learned about when
[2:21:17] brother Jack was preaching 12 you know
[2:21:20] seventeen forty fifty you know there's
[2:21:23] certain numbers that you know you know
[2:21:24] carry some kind of meaning but three 320
[2:21:27] I didn't even know where it starts to
[2:21:29] look to kind of figure out you know what
[2:21:31] what 320 meant so you know I brushed it
[2:21:34] aside and it kept reappearing in this
[2:21:37] there's more to house number than just a
[2:21:38] house number so one day I was thinking
[2:21:41] about it and a thought just came to me
[2:21:43] and said maybe it's not 320 maybe it's a
[2:21:49] chapter three verse 20 and so I thought
[2:21:53] well okay I hadn't thought of that so
[2:21:57] you know the little Ino lid I'll look
[2:22:00] into it it's pretty much all that what I
[2:22:01] told myself and then I didn't and the
[2:22:04] thought just kept coming back you know
[2:22:05] she kept coming back 303 320 320 and so
[2:22:10] one day I had time and I was like okay I
[2:22:12] actually let me look through the Bible
[2:22:14] to see if there's any book in the Bible
[2:22:16] that has a chapter 3 and verse 20 that
[2:22:19] has some sort of significance to my life
[2:22:22] or my situation or to this journey so I
[2:22:26] started going through from from the Old
[2:22:28] Testament going through Genesis you know
[2:22:29] look through each book and you know so
[2:22:32] you know most most of the books had a
[2:22:34] chapter a chapter 3 some didn't have a
[2:22:38] verse 20 some did have a first 20 but it
[2:22:41] just it didn't have any significance to
[2:22:43] my life and some some books didn't have
[2:22:46] a chapter 3 so I kept going and I went
[2:22:49] through the whole Old Testament and then
[2:22:52] I started on a New Testament so as I was
[2:22:57] going through the New Testament you know
[2:22:58] started you know Matthew Mark Luke John
[2:23:00] and I'm and I'm going and then I got to
[2:23:04] to Ephesians and Ephesians kind of
[2:23:07] chapter 3 and Ephesians had a verse 20
[2:23:13] so I got to you fees in Ephesians
[2:23:16] chapter 3 and first 20 and I read
[2:23:21] Ephesians chapter 3 verse 20 now
[2:23:24] bear in mind how I've been thinking
[2:23:27] about just just how god it works in my
[2:23:29] life and how he had changed my life you
[2:23:32] know two years ago and how he had done
[2:23:34] so many things and moved mightily and
[2:23:37] exceeded my expectations and been in
[2:23:40] every single little detail about the
[2:23:43] whole journey right and so with that in
[2:23:46] mind night I get to features three the
[2:23:49] first twenty and I read it and as soon
[2:23:52] as I read I said glory to God this is
[2:23:56] the reason why I never kept ringing in
[2:23:57] my mind you know because God God was
[2:24:01] still in the details it was just a house
[2:24:04] number I know there was a verse in there
[2:24:06] let's go directly to my situation and so
[2:24:10] so so when I read I was like oh man and
[2:24:13] and and and the verse says now unto him
[2:24:16] that is able to do exceeding abundantly
[2:24:19] above all we can ask or think according
[2:24:23] to the power that worketh in US alright
[2:24:27] unto him be the glory
[2:24:28] alright so I read that and I was like oh
[2:24:31] my gosh this is why this was um in my
[2:24:34] mind all this time and and and this is
[2:24:36] why there was that that there's that
[2:24:38] voice that just kept saying there's more
[2:24:40] to your house number and now God has
[2:24:42] revealed himself in something that is
[2:24:44] simple
[2:24:45] you know so I just started thinking
[2:24:47] myself and I was like man this is
[2:24:49] nothing but the truth all right
[2:24:51] God has exceeded my expectation is
[2:24:55] expectation you know there are when I
[2:24:57] was praying to come here I was praying
[2:24:59] for an opportunity to be in Florida and
[2:25:01] I was praying for a job in Florida the
[2:25:03] house was never a thing that I prayed
[2:25:05] for until I knew our body you know by a
[2:25:07] house of it oh you know you know I guess
[2:25:09] I'm playing house I start praying but
[2:25:11] when I was thinking of coming here when
[2:25:13] I was praying about coming here my
[2:25:14] prayer was to get a job here and to move
[2:25:16] here alright and and I in my head and I
[2:25:19] told my my my my fiancee then my wife
[2:25:23] that when I get here I'm gonna get an
[2:25:25] apartment and I'm just gonna see you
[2:25:27] know we're gonna get married Oh settle
[2:25:29] down once we'll wholesale maybe after a
[2:25:30] year or so we'll think about buying a
[2:25:32] home so buying a home was never in my
[2:25:34] plans but that's an expectation that God
[2:25:36] acceded back and just the way that he
[2:25:40] brought me here I in my head when I was
[2:25:43] praying about all of this in my head I
[2:25:44] thought the realistically I would come
[2:25:47] here middle of 2019 or about the end of
[2:25:52] 2000 about you know this time or you
[2:25:54] know July you know time about or about
[2:25:55] round about this time is what I thought
[2:25:57] was realistic but he exceeded that
[2:25:59] expectation and for me here end of
[2:26:01] twenty nine pretty 18 right and I
[2:26:03] started the year here you know he
[2:26:05] exceeded that expectation you know and
[2:26:07] how she's thinking about I was like God
[2:26:09] God is good man and he's just revealed
[2:26:12] himself in in in this stage and even
[2:26:14] just um the way he worked out me coming
[2:26:17] here and me not having to jump through
[2:26:18] the hurdles you know hoops and hurdles
[2:26:20] that you I was who's and hurdles
[2:26:22] prepares to jump to get here I didn't
[2:26:25] have to he just opened the Red Sea and
[2:26:27] allowed me just walk on dry ground and
[2:26:28] not have to face anything and so I was a
[2:26:31] man God you really did accede to all my
[2:26:33] expectations in this whole thing and so
[2:26:37] when I was just thinking about just just
[2:26:39] how what you know you just just get
[2:26:40] everything that happened with you know
[2:26:41] just discovering that verse and just
[2:26:43] seeing God and in something so simple
[2:26:45] and how God revealed himself to me I
[2:26:48] revealed an attribute of himself or the
[2:26:49] attribute of being able to do abundantly
[2:26:51] above I just I just thought myself man
[2:26:53] I'm I'm
[2:26:56] so grateful for the message now I'm so
[2:26:58] grateful to be a believer because when
[2:27:01] when you are a believer or when when you
[2:27:04] become a believer naturally you just
[2:27:07] start to look at things spiritually all
[2:27:10] right and a lot of the testimonies here
[2:27:13] like I said we're saying testimonies
[2:27:16] because we see God in them right the
[2:27:19] same thing like I say it could happen to
[2:27:21] the average Christian an average person
[2:27:23] and they might attribute it to good
[2:27:25] fortune or we no chance or I know but we
[2:27:30] as believers see God in it you ask the
[2:27:33] important things because it was supposed
[2:27:34] to give credit where it's due
[2:27:36] all right like like like a brother
[2:27:39] Solomon gave credit to me for my video
[2:27:40] editing skills good thing is that we
[2:27:47] recognize that this is the work of God
[2:27:50] and as a believer it's important for us
[2:27:53] to have spiritual eyes and spiritual
[2:27:56] ears right
[2:27:58] that's why the Bible in Revelation says
[2:28:01] you know either have an ear let him hear
[2:28:02] what the Spirit is saying to church
[2:28:03] right in Matthew 13 said you know
[2:28:07] blessed are your eyes for they see your
[2:28:09] ears for they hear right right there's a
[2:28:11] certain type of ear right that you need
[2:28:13] to hear that right there's a certain
[2:28:15] type of eye you need to see Matt right
[2:28:18] why would the Bible say he that hath an
[2:28:21] ear let him hear
[2:28:22] we all have ears right right but there's
[2:28:24] a certain type of here yeah that you
[2:28:26] need to hear all right I you need to see
[2:28:28] God moving right so I was just thinking
[2:28:32] about all of that and
[2:28:38] so I was thinking about all that and I
[2:28:42] was thinking you know God God is a great
[2:28:44] God right God can speak mildly and he
[2:28:48] can move mightily but the same God can
[2:28:51] move in simplicity and he can move in
[2:28:53] simple things right right the Prophet
[2:28:56] even preached a sermon on God hiding
[2:29:00] himself in simplicity
[2:29:02] Ryan revealing himself in the same I
[2:29:04] know and I looked at I was like God hid
[2:29:07] himself in 3:20 and he revealed himself
[2:29:10] to me reveal attribute to me in that
[2:29:13] simple thing that maybe someone might
[2:29:15] not even think about right so I was
[2:29:17] thinking about what I was thinking about
[2:29:18] that and I was like you know our God God
[2:29:24] like I said God can move speak Michael
[2:29:26] your move my lead right God can speak
[2:29:29] mythili you know by thundering from
[2:29:31] heaven right God can and move mightily
[2:29:34] and speak mighty by we know that from
[2:29:36] the word by appearing in the burning
[2:29:38] bush and speaking through it right God
[2:29:40] can come down in the form of a cloud and
[2:29:44] speak to the cloud we know that from the
[2:29:46] word right but God can also use a
[2:29:48] brother all right
[2:29:50] like I don't remember someone saying I
[2:29:51] think it was it was it was a rod Solomon
[2:29:54] talking about just text or conversations
[2:29:57] we have our fire God can speak through a
[2:29:59] brother God and speak to a sister God
[2:30:01] God can can can move through what
[2:30:05] someone else could call good fortune all
[2:30:07] right God can speak to a song that
[2:30:11] someone comes up to sing right and and
[2:30:13] the thing is our our our natural eyes
[2:30:16] and our natural ears can only take us so
[2:30:19] far and our favor right if God thundered
[2:30:22] my spoke mightily and thundered from
[2:30:24] heaven our natural is good here that the
[2:30:27] same God spoke right right if God
[2:30:29] appeared in a burning bush and spoke to
[2:30:31] us we could see what the natural island
[2:30:33] is a burning bush there and
[2:30:35] voices coming out of that supernatural
[2:30:36] right and we we could we can always say
[2:30:39] you know we experienced Coca's now
[2:30:41] supernatural i right but what about when
[2:30:43] he uses the foolishness of preaching all
[2:30:45] right right what about when he uses a
[2:30:47] sister to send the text or to have a
[2:30:49] conversation with you know what about
[2:30:51] when someone comes up to sing a song oh
[2:30:53] you know what about when III heard
[2:30:55] testimony the one time of someone a
[2:30:57] believer whose life was changed because
[2:31:01] of our strangest
