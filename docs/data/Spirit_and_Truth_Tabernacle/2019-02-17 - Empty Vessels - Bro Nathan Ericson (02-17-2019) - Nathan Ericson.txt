stayed behind and we appreciate the Lord Jesus just a wonderful wonderful atmosphere that was a beautiful song all this song then here in this morning just sort of real real precious in spirit singing about season for change and just reminded just a few weeks ago speaking on a sermon we shall be changed they met in a moment in the twinkling of an eye the Prophet was saying how does this change happen how does it happen and they said it comes by the spirit of the word right and as you just kind of look at that you know this everything has a spirit associated with you whether you want to realize that or not everything has a spirit music in particular carries different spirits saying how rap music cares of spirit where you just want to fight shoot some kind of spirit brother Joel you know what I'm talking about but uh you know and then country music carry spirit you wanna shoot yourself she left me again rock'n'roll carries a spirit you wanna bang head with somebody you know lost your mind because of it sometimes good good Christian music Mick you wanna [Music] I can just be in my car gonna be in my room all by myself just press play I just hear the right thing at the right time and I'm go write good worship music won't watch it just dip your hands and just have the presence of the Lord just pouring out your eyes but all those things will not produce to change what produces a change is the spirit that's in the world it's not just in the word but its own the word if you've ever been discouraged and just picked up your Bible and just rent one scripture all of a sudden your whole attitude changes because there's a spirit that's in the world it's an eternal Word of God and that's more important than anything else in the sermon we thank God for this have the brothers prepare to come we'll prepare to take this mortars offering and then I'm going to get out of the way one half of the Nathan Thomas piqued our hearts then let's just bow our heads brother the whole story [Music] [Music] [Music] praise the Lord wanted to thank the Lord for giving I'm pronouncing this wrong the name wrong but I believe it is a dr. Graham Graham okay accomplished you're still going to have you with us today [Music] they were telling me another sister that came believe her name was Dolores I understand and she was just going here to the of the store and as she was going to the store to get something for the Dollar General she saw Saints coming into the house of God she felt the pool to come right on into the house of the Lord and I just felt last night just a lot that was sad was just really you know God just directed the minister right where he needed to go right because I mean this is what it's all about you know a reason for even being here on earth right now is because we're still looking for the last scene I believe the rapture should have happened a long time ago but because we're looking for the last scene that's why we're still here and any time we're doing meetings like this we're we're trusting and believing that that last one might be found in a meeting like this you said the right atmosphere somebody could give birth a man so we were thinking God for that I just appreciate the Lord and all that as status happened I know some of the states would be leaving after this service today we still have one more tonight that'll be at six o'clock but those that have to leave after service we want to say thank God for you for coming to this big part of the meetings without you it would not be what it is and we're very very grateful a man for your attendance but also a bad time because it's so expensive you know the hotels do that because they know everybody come and they get out of the snow but but we thank God for your sacrifice and they got reward you so we're not gonna take time amen I want to make way for our precious brother Nathan Erickson we appreciate having this precious wife and also his daughter being with us and we just have another Wayne and just his first time they preached together like this they've done an excellent job and we have been blessed blessed so we're looking forward to what God has in store for us today you know what I ate yesterday has already passed through I need some more today right so we're an expectation for what God has in store so let's just and time feed a man let's sing this song it won't be long we'll be leaving here as we just prepare to receive brother Nathan Eriksson up to the pulpit on this morning he need a man or will you be gone [Music] [Music] sing that one more time count the years as [Music] amen how many's not ready to go home amen amen but you know there's something about being with the saints of God worshiping together sharing an atmosphere like this Amen I feel like I'm home already hallelujah oh my it's just been a wonderful worship this morning a wonderful time of glorifying God together I couldn't stay back there in the office there I had to come out and just enjoy the singing with you amen you know sometimes brother Jack you know it's the studying is over the inspiration has come and I just want to I just want to worship with the Saints you know and getting that presence get in that atmosphere oh it's a beautiful thing and it's really bless my heart this morning we just give glory to God turn with me to the book of second Corinthians the fourth chapter 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 amen I just want to say once again what a privilege and an honor it's been to be here amen you you make me feel like a preacher you just treated me so well and the poles been wonderful Liberty's been wonderful and so I'm just I'm just grateful to be here with you amen I'll appreciate it all the singing this weekend the worship that's just really bless my heart I just love that old gospel singing a man that's wonderful to me amen I had glad I could slip out and hear brother Jack sing I wish I could hear him every week every day a man I really do we were really blessed to have brother Jack with us last year and our meetings and and not only got to hear him sing but also preach amen we were so blessed Amen by his gift and not only brother Jack but we had his two daughters were with him and were they at this morning brother Jack's daughters god bless you sisters a man we just had a wonderful time over there at brother Wayne's house one evening after the meetings just worshiping God together and join the presence of the Lord that's that to me is it will go down as a precious memory in my heart amen I just want to tell you girls too that that we just appreciate your gift amen a talent is one thing even a calling is one thing but that anointing is on another level and when it brings the presence of the Lord and it ministers to the heart so we like your singing up there in Ohio we wish you'd come back soon amen we really do if the Lord had helped me this morning I want to continue someone in the same vein that I've been in I was up last night just seeking the Lord and and and God helped me this morning I'd like to minister on empty vessels empty vessels so we're here in second Corinthians the fourth chapter and beginning with the fourth down to the seventh verse in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them but we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness have shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us can we quickly also take Romans chapter 9 amen this might be just about my favorite chapter in the whole Bible right up there with all the rest of them amen but this is precious here Romans 9 and we'll read the 20th to the 23rd verse nay but o man who art thou that repliest against God shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why has thou made me thus hath not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour what if God willing to show his wrath and make his power known endured with much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath which are fitted to destruction that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy amen which he had afore prepared unto glory let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord we're here as empty vessels this morning we have nothing of our own to offer Lord we've not fella we're not here to fellowship around the ideas of a man Lord the eloquence of a man but father where we want to feed on the body word of the son of man Lord that's among us father and working through us Lord we just asked you to come on the scene Lord in such a special way father that we'd all be able to get out of the way this morning Lord that you would just anoint this service just right Lord say exactly what you would want to say father Lord we're not here to to put an impressive speech together Lord but father for your will to be done Lord take us off our notes Lord take us off our agenda Lord just make a mess of the whole thing Lord to the eyes of man in order Lord to speak to your people and just render to them exactly what they have Nita Father for we are a needy people but we believe in a Heavenly Father who is faithful Lord to his children I ask that you would just give us this day our daily bread Lord we submit to you Father you're our Lord and our master and we love and respect you Lord in Jesus Christ's name and father I just just struck my mind I forgot to turn in the prayer requests Lord of a brother from our church that asks for prayer in these meetings brother Sal Lord having open-heart surgery this Wednesday we asked Lord you just touch him father Lord have your way on his life I pray that Lord you would just heal incompletely Lord and deliver him from that thing all those that are here Lord they have need of healing or deliverance encouragement whatever it would be Lord we're looking to you not to any man but looking to Jesus the author and the finisher of this faith in Jesus Christ's name we pray and we dedicate this service amen amen you may be seated amen sure appreciate once again the opportunity to be here and also all you that have come to fellowship together it's wonderful you can have unity in this area and and good fellowship amongst the churches and so I just want to say God bless you to all those who not only from the local church but those that are visiting and the ministers and and and pastors and saints it's it's just a blessing to be together there's some Ohio people sitting there so hyoe people god bless you brother yeah I would feel right at home amen empty vessels this morning empty vessels and we were speaking last night on the the thought on the latter glory amen about the about the taken out of the book a Hagee I they're talking about the the the temple that was restored through the work of observable which is a type of the work of restoration that's happening today and we were just showing how that there was actually a discouragement on the hearts of the people because the temple that had been restored was very humble to the eye to the ayah was very humble it was very simple compared to Solomon's Temple so that people were discouraged but God raised up profit to assure them that there would be a greater glory of this latter temple it would be more than the works of Solomon but it would be the personal presence of the desire of nations which is Lord Jesus Christ the Messiah coming to his temple amen is a greater glory even than Solomon amen and we believe that a greater than Solomon is here we were just laboring to show how that we are the tabernacle of his presence today that you know the bride is literally amen embodying in her vessel amen as a many membered body the actual presence of God the actual attributes of God which were in a mystery form the beginning have been manifested on the earth and collectively the bride of Jesus Christ amen is in a sense a physical coming of the Lord Jesus Christ amen but not in the body that he walked the shores of Galilee not in that son of David rain but in a many membered body of Jesus Christ amen we're here today that's why we've come that's why we're bound together by love amen is because we've been knit together to be that body amen so we find that a true Christian now it will will will be somebody who their life and their whole being their whole vessel is dedicated to that calling to that cause a meant to be the the temple of God to be the tabernacle of God and a vessel for His Holy Spirit amen we're not here to follow our own dreams and ambitions we're not here to you know to try to build something in this world but we're we're sojourners here amen we're children of Abraham where we're Wanderers and we're strangers in a strange land amen and we've been separated we've been set aside for service a man we've been consecrated unto God so we have nothing of our own to offer him amen if it was up to us on our merit and and our Worth and our righteousness and our own works to try to be as something or try to Amen deserve his presence we we never would have had a chance but we find that we're to be before God empty vessels amen where all of our pride and all of our achievement and all of our talents and our gifts and everything is poured out and amen and and we've got to come to a place to be his temple you've got to come to a place Amen where you just clean house we just say Lord I'm done trying to make it on my own I'm done trying to I'm trying to to get by on my own work so my own merit Lord I'm cleaning house Amen cuz I don't want it to be my house I don't want it to be I don't want my life to be decorated the way I want I don't want the carpet to be the way I want this is your house Lord I want to be your house amen so we got to be empty vessels before God amen and we referenced this quote last yesterday brother Branham said in perfect strength by perfect weakness he said there's one thing that we've got to master a man this morning there's one thing that we have to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life amen if you want to live this message if you want to live this calling if you want to be the bride of Jesus Christ there's one thing you've got to master amen that is we have to master the thought of human ability if we ever get to a spot where we think that we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that God can use us amen that's right and make a complete surrender we cannot use one ability friends we cannot use one ability we've got to make a complete surrender amen amen that's what I want to be that's the testimony I want before God amen it's not of me it's not my works or my my hopes and dreams but I just want to be a surrender vessel unto Him because I know that everything that's that's good and godly in my life has come to me by grace amen everything that we have as Christians has come by grace and grace is unmerited favor amen in other words there was nothing that you did nothing you could have done to deserve the grace of God but the grace of God came anyway amen hallelujah even the faith that we're fellowshipping around today you say well oh I've got faith brother I've got faith but even your faith is a gift of God the Bible says by grace you are saved through faith and that's not of yourself I love you but it is the gift of God amen Romans 12 for I say through the grace given to me Amen unto me to every man that's among you don't think more highly of yourself than you ought to think but think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith amen amen a measure of faith now listen here brother sister don't ever let the devil tell you you don't have faith Amen that you don't have enough faith the Bible says it's a faith as a mustard seed amen uh hallelujah the devil said well you don't have enough faith so you can't receive the promise you can't get your healing you can't get deliverance because you don't have enough faith you had enough faith to believe what the devil was telling you I mean the devil works by that same faith by that same confession but he twists it to make your confession in something besides the Word of God but there's something in a human being that every human being on the face of this earth believes in something amen but if you'll stop believing the words of the devil and believe in God's Word and begin to confess God's Word watch what'll happen amen but you've got to empty your mind amen of all of the devil's ideas and all of your thoughts and all of your all of your weakness and fears and doubts amen and fill it up with the Word of God amen brother Branham said now faith is a revelation from God it's a revelation he's revealed it to you by His grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into faith how many's ever tried to work up faith oh yeah amen but it didn't work it doesn't work you can't pump it up work it up muster it up amen I love you you never had faith brother Branham said but it's give to you by the grace of God you never had faith but it's gift to you by grace and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole Church of God is built on the revelation amen Oh am i the scripture we just read God has shined in our hearts to give light of the knowledge of the glory of God it was revelation that showed us the light of this message amen hallelujah you are out of some denominational field somewhere out in a barroom somewhere you looking for God hallelujah but God was looking for you amen and somewhere in your darkness a light shine through and struck your heart Amen hallelujah I grew up in a message peel but I was in darkness when he found me a man I didn't know who I was or where I was at amen or what God's Will was for my line amen but when the light struck at a man by the grace of God he pulled me out from where I was and that gives me confidence to know that I'm not standing here today based on my own merit or my own ability what the grace of God picked me up from where I was hallelujah Hey look beyond my fault a man in love saw my need glory to God I ain't many men well you never saw God but he sought you and thank God when that light struck your heart there was a seed down on the inside that was ready to receive His Word amen it was just waiting to be quickened amen but God put that seed there hey man that's why we're preaching the quickening power amen because it doesn't matter what condition you're in amen whether you're in a barroom or in a church you're in an earthen vessel amen you're in an earthly state you're nothing but the dirt and the dust of this heard they meant but if there's a seed lying in that earth just let the lights track it one time amen and there's something in that see that it will burst to life hey man there will be a reaction there will be a movement hey man there will be a joy when the light strikes that seed hallelujah the quickening power that all this churchianity all the intellectualism that we have a man around this message it's never gonna produce this life Amen but what will produce the life of Christ in the body of Christ amen is the Spirit of Christ amen coming back quickening power to bring us alive a man and that's what will make it live amen brother Brad said are we really getting the people to God now are we just getting them to church we must get them to Christ when you come to church that's good but you've got to go on to Christ from the church amen because we must receive this quickening power because it's the only thing that will ever bring us from the dead amen holla you might understand this message you might have me all your diagrams just right amen but until the quickening power strikes you you don't haven't even seen the light yet hey man that's my brother instead quickening power opened the seven seals it was quickening power that lets us see his coming but getting power will show you who you are hey man hey man let the power fall this morning the power falling this fits holy man the excellency of the power might be of God and not of I none of my religious words none of my tradition hallelujah glory to God that intellectual understanding a man intellectual faith will always be on the basis of your merit it will always be on the basis of your merit amen hallelujah but in him when you're in Christ amen hallelujah Oh glory to God and this revelation what do I mean by a seed I'm talking about election I'm talking about somebody chose you amen before you knew anything about it a man before you ever before you ever made a single failure before you ever got caught in a trap before the devil ever got you down a man before you ever went through a trial somebody was looking at you and then and he chose you knowing what she would be hallelujah God knew you when he chose you a man he never regretted his decision a man he's never worried about the circumstances a man he's not concerned about the things that you go through he knew what you would be by foreknowledge when he chose you amen oh my that's too much grace for some people but that's just the amount of grace I need a man is a God who can hold me when I can't hold myself a man glory to God we got people around this message don't believe in eternal security it blows my mind rather Brannon would go and many times he would list off the great revelations the great mysteries that were open our day he'd say look seven sealed water baptism serpents see the revelation the Godhead and eternal security amen was preached just right by the word to the church amen to show you hallelujah little children you're not the one doing the holding this morning but there's something holding you there was nothing in your nature your life that could live this message but thank god there's a seed life in you amen and if it ever comes to life it'll take over everything glory to God you'll already go a man I don't even know where I am said the anointed Word of God being vindicated before any man that's born to be a son Amen with that predestinated German him for this hour he will see God's message as sure amen that's there's a God in heaven hallelujah if you're a seed I mean you don't have a sister if you can never get the revelation of the seed life continue that's the day fear will die that's the thing that will pass away Amen cuz you'll know hallelujah you're not the one holding everything together Amen but there's something in you it's a seed and it's coming to lie if it's ever been by the headline amen it bursts your life you can't stop it you can't stop a seat from growing you know why because there's a law in that seed Amen that when it comes into the right conditions it's got to grow yes Lally Laurie I want you to know the grace that you have received it wasn't a temporary reprieve it's not a grace based on on you doing everything right it's not a grace based on uh on you being able to hold it together but it's a sovereign grace I may believe in the sovereignty of God amen I'll tell you what the what the Prophet taught about sovereignty amen he said that you know things can happen and there's consequences for bad decisions and things and people can get off into the permissive wheel of golf but you know what he else he said he said it's always got to come back to glorify the perfect will of God he said the perfect will of God will be done regardless you know that means you are not powerful enough in your frailty to frustrate the grace of God hath not the power the Potter power over the clay a man you didn't make this vessel a man you didn't put it together a man you didn't choose where you would be born what church you would be in what kind of a message you would be listening to I want you to know you've been built up a spiritual house a man a man in Solomon's day the people built the temple but Jesus said you tear this house down and I'll build it up I want you to know God is building this bride the Bible says when the Lord shall build up Zion we shall see him in his glory amen we don't know what we shall be but we know when he appears we shall be like him [Applause] [Music] predestinated unto the adoption a man glory see because the power is not in the earth it's not in the vessel it doesn't if the powers not looking at this earth but it's looking at that seed and there's a law of a seed amen then it must grow if it's a good seed if it's a good life amen it became from a good stock amen it's gonna grow it's gonna push out it's gonna bear fruit because the law is in the seed amen I got tell a little story to calm down a little bit amen I moved down there to Findlay Ohio and I got a little house there in town you know and it's just a little house in town I got a little tiny yard with it just ugly it's got an ugly fence around a little ugly little fence room so I moved there I thought man that's an ugly fence I got to do something about this fence you know so I thought well I need like some vines growing out in or something so I went down to Menards you know and and and I and I was looking around at different things I thought My Morning Glory Morning Glory I'll get me some Morning Glory and I'll just plant that all along my fence they'll grow up it looked real nice and have flowers and stuff now if any of you in here are gardeners you're about to laugh at me anyway because you know I got a few packets that Morning Glory and it said you know take one seed every six inches put a little seed I was like I got plenty so I went all up and down that fence sprinkle in that Morning Glory boy my brother after a little while that stuff began to grow and it spread out it went all over the fence it went all over the yard it went all over my trees it went all over the vegetable red jacket took over everything amen it got into my my vegetable patches start at the bottom my tomatoes and it went all the way up to the tippy top just choked out everything amen oh my you know so every year I go and I I clean up that Morning Glory and I cut it back and I get it back down to the root and you know the funny thing happens the next spring Amen here comes that Morning Glory sure is anything I am convinced Amen you could drop a nuclear bomb on my house and you would wipe out every memory of Nathan Erickson amen but the next spring that Morning Glory would come forth just as Shores it that's the kind of scene that scene you [Applause] it's the morning glory it is the rising of the Sun the day star has shone in your heart say man you've got to wake up and realize your night has come respond to his life and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee I know the devil hates election I know he hates election so I'm about to hit him how many one help me hit the devil alright brother and said you are a written epistle epistle amen you've been he said not written with ink now but he said you've been written by the Holy Ghost on the fleshly tables of your heart amen saying it weren't written in Sunday school you weren't written in a seminar but the Holy Ghost took that thought of God that was in the beginning and he literally wrote it spoke it into your vessel amen Oh glory to God that means you're the word if you were in God at the beginning then you're one of his thoughts amen and every thought of God is eternal so you are just as eternal as God is eternal thank God for a message amen but it see you weren't just he wasn't content to let you stay a thought but he spoke you into this season as we read last night this time this place is a promise given to this bride and he chose this time to speak that into your heart that makes you the word brother Brown says in other words he said I turn it like this you are a writ epistles that have already been written already been written you know what that means that means it's the Word of God and you can't add to it and you can't take away from it I know that there's a the devil's got a whole bunch of footnotes a big long commentary on the mistakes of your life that he would like to take on to the book of you but it can't do it friends because you can't add to the word I know the devil like to take your joy I know we'd like to take your victory take your peace take the security of this election from you but he can't do it because you can't take away from the word amen he said my word is a seed but it won't return unto me void it's going to accomplish the purpose that I sent it for brother if you're the word of God this might sound like heresy but I believe that the true children of God the word of they're the Living Word of God spoken word children are just as infallible as this King James Bible sitting right in front of me amen if that's heresy so in them after the way that it's called heresy so worship I the God of my father's amen you might make mistakes you might be toss and turn but the perfect will of God will be done regardless that's why I'm so glad you know I might go through the sunshine go through the rain but I'm gonna get there I just gotta get there and I know one of these days I'm gonna get there hallelujah how many rubber bands talk about how many great ministries rose up great uh great people great churches and he said now they're laying in the scrap heap on the side of the road but I'll tell you what will keep you out of that scrap heap is not your effort it's not your righteousness not your talent or your ability or your zeal for God but it's that seed of election laying in yo hallelujah you believe that Oh glory to God Amen see that's what I'm shouting about glory to God amen oh my somewhere somewhere along the line somebody thought shouting meant Pentecostal somebody thought shouting meant immaturity but what about John amen when he saw his name written on that Lamb's Book something is hard they said everything under the earth everything on the earth and everything above the earth heard John shouting amen and worshiping God how are you knowing a man that his name was written on that book that's why when I look into this message amen and I began to realize by the light of his word Who I am when I began to look into the mirror of his word and be changed into that glory it makes me want to shout Amen you're a vessel of mercy that's what he called you to be Amen now there were many attributes in God that we're waiting to be expressed amen our God is a vengeful God he's a wrathful God on the unrighteous that's why that's why Romans said that he's there's vessels of Wrath have been prepared so that the wrath of God can be revealed amen but you are not those vessels of Wrath but you've been called here to be a vessel of mercy amen hallelujah he's not filled you with judgment filled you with fear filled you with condemnation he has filled you with mercy amen he has filled you with grace and that's what we're called to be Amen I know we got people around this message that are legalistic and they you know they can take the word and they can begin to cut with it and they can you know somebody if you're not careful you can take this message and you can just tear somebody apart with it you know what the problem is say man oh my you're filling up with the wrong with the wrong message hey man going to God because you know every time God sends a word to the earth to the world it's judgment but to the chosen elect it's always great amen I'll do that's what capstone came down crying grace grace to the world the message is indictment but to the bride it's Shalom please be upon you your light has come Hallelujah vessels of mercy that's why the Bible says he's committed unto us a Ministry of reconciliation think about it now all right god help us this morning but think about how brother Branham said that the bride's ministry would be just like Christ amen amen well Christ's ministry was one of redemption was it not amen so there's attributes in the bride of redemption attributes of reconciliation oh my that's why we love one another that's why we forgive one another Amen that's why we we have a testimony in this world of an atmosphere of love Amen not just to be a good Christian but because he has committed to this bride a ministry Amen he has hidden he has tabernacled his name in this bride and he's fulfilling the Ministry of Christ through you hallelujah is hey man that's why hey man that's why he's a hey man that's why there's something your heart and somebody cuts you off in traffic you say Father forgive him they didn't know who they were cutting off hey man somebody treats you bad he say Lord they don't know who I am amen amen but Lord you revealed to me I just say Lord I don't hold it against I'm a man because there's something in you amen now I'm not trying to make a big doctrine out of this or something or or say these ones are in these ones are out or anything like that but didn't a prophet say that for a glass of water a cup of cold water in my name for these things he said there's a whole class of people because of their the way they treat the bride and they may be allowed to enter into eternal people aren't we be Amen amen to realize that we have this great responsibility this great power dwelling in us not in our vessel Amen but because of whose dwelling in us because of whose temple you are when people come to you they can come into contact with God something can happen that can make a difference in somebody's life oh I want to live that way hey man is that all right that might be bold but hallelujah amen don't you know the bride has a ministry a man what she ate this book with John eight this book amen there was a word that said you've got to prophesy again a man don't just sit there and listen to it you better but then you got to prophesy him and there's got to be a word in your mouth and what this bride is preaching to this world is not a message of judgment not a message of well who cares about you I got mine no but she's saying let him that is thirsty come a man let every laughs eat everyone amen if they can't be bribed amen if they're totally lost let him go to a devil's hell having experienced the divine love of God one time that's the kind of people we ought to be that's the mindset we ought to have amen to be that redemption you know it was when Abraham manifested the attribute of an amateur Redeemer and claimed his brother lot that's when Melchizedek came to have communion amen all right I know I rushed over those things quickly I don't want to go all the way into him this morning amen I'm just all over the place having a good time I hope you're having a good time amen amen now you say well how could I fulfill that ministry how could I be that bride looking at this veil of flesh looking at this vessel amen how could God's glory fill a vessel like this with all the imperfections all the flaws and all the failures amen what's stumbling you amen what's blinding your eyes what's veiling it to you is the foolishness of God the Bible says there is a foolishness of God that's wiser than the wisdom of the world they foolishness of God and and and if you ever go read that that chapter in first Corinthians chapter 1 it'll really bless your heart when you begin to realize how that God operates is all in a way that comes so humble and it comes so it comes so lowly that we would miss it all together amen I'll give you an example in that chapter Paul says it's the foolishness of preaching that can save men's soul now I've never heard anything so foolish as preaching a man there's just nothing you know to get up here and and scream and sweat and just bounce around and and and and and and yet God can save souls that way that's the way that he speaks to his church it's through vessels of men that's the way that he can speak to you this morning it's through that foolishness of preaching but it is foolishness to the eyes of men amen hallelujah you know if I was in charge the way that I would do it Amen is every Sunday if it was me just setting up the order of the church brother Jack I I believe every Sunday if I had my way we would all come to church you know we gather around sing and do everything you know and then and then brother Jack would pastor Jack would come up to the pulpit and all of a sudden the Holy Ghost would come and he would just levitate about three feet in the air and light would shine out of his eyes and the whole morning sermon that God's message to his people would be delivered by divine prophecy but it doesn't happen that way you know because all week long you know he's thinking and and labor and say Lord what am I gonna bring Sunday morning what what do you have for your people you know and then a little problem will come up in the family he's got to go take care of that and then summer rides up over here in the church he's got a how inefficient they meant how foolish and yet God how many times over and over and over again has God met your need over this pulpit for the foolishness of preaching and I tell you if he can use a preacher that way he can use you too and then if God can speak through a donkey I believe that uh that uh that vessel doesn't matter how lonely you are how uneducated amen I believe God can use you I believe he can use your vessel amen the Bible says it's the wisdom of God that the world by wisdom knew not God in other words you cannot know God through your own intellectual understanding you might think you do but you can never truly know God up here and it was the wisdom of God that it's that way amen because if it took the smart and the educated and the philosophers amen and the deep people amen what hope would that drunk in a gutter have had amen what hope would that lost one of half if it took a real understanding if it took several years of Bible School to know God that's not the way it is brother God is known on the basis of faith and every human being a man has intrinsic faith that all you've got to do is set your faith in the Word of God you might not understand it altogether you might not fully see this message but you say Lord I believe it with all my heart amen watch God anointed and quicken it to you glory to God it's the wisdom of God that you don't know him by wisdom Oh what foolishness amen how do they Paul said because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men for you see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God hath chosen the foolish things of this world that's me amen to confound the wise and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath God chosen yes and things which are not to bring to nought things which are and here's why that no flesh should glory in his presence no flesh should glory in his presence all glory to God amen you see your car I don't know how it is down here in Florida amen back there in Bluffton we got a little group of people just a little not a megachurch but it's a no megachurch hey man and it's all the misfits and the rejects Amen it's the castaways it's the poor people the uneducated the people that'll never be imported they'll never be famous they'll never be kings and presidents and princes and celebrities amen but I tell you they're the children of God just like all the children of Israel of Abraham they just wandered through the world and kings and empires rose and fell around them but they were seeking a city not made with hands but it's a city that God is building now hallelujah there's your adoption friends you're just another brick in the wall of that city Alleluia amen you want to be part of that adoption you can't be of somebody hey man cuz I don't care how fine you might be a stone Amen in that house amen what's a adoptions a positional placing a positional placing alright isn't that what he said amen I don't care you take a stone and you cut it just perfect you make it just as beautiful as it can be I mean a beautiful stone an excellent life a religious man throw it out in the field and try to get shelter by it amen but it for you to come into position Amen you got to lift your brother up and pull them through your side and you got to lift another one amen and you've got to be built together amen it's not a one man calling it's not a one man ministry it's not great men and great ministries but it's everyone in the right position empty vessels for the will of God that's why he said if you're a if you're a factory worker if you're a farmer if you're just a little housewife trying to raise your children right if you found that position you are an indispensable portion of the economy of God amen the kingdom wouldn't make it without you we're not gonna make it without you brother sister hallelujah why don't you stop sitting around feeling sorry for yourself we're all just waiting for you to come and join arms with say man none of us got it all together none of us have the full understanding but if we stand shoulder to shoulder and find our position in that body one of these days this body will so be identified with our hand and then we'll have to be caught up to meet oh don't you know we have nothing to do but fall back in the arms of a loving gracious God this morning because it wasn't him that doeth not him that willeth but it was God that shows mercy when you wouldn't have chose yourself God did the choosing Amen hallelujah he said I'll have mercy upon whom I will have mercy so who art Thou O man amen sometimes we get say Lord why did you choose that one Lord why'd you choose that brother that sister they drive me up the wall amen but how many ever said Lord how could you it shows me Amen but one of these days you got to stop arguing with God's election and you just got to take God at His Word and just accept him for what he's done for you brother have said if God saw fit a meant to take the dust of this hurt and make one vessel to wrath and they just there's no hope we got to accept it by sovereignty but he also said if he takes that same earth and makes it into a vessel of mercy and he chose you Amen called you out of this world you've got to accept that but then many times that's the problem for people as they can't accept God's grace for themselves they can't look at a message and realize this is speaking of you Amen we recognize the message when it speaks of an end time prophet we recognize the message when it speaks of a fivefold ministry but what about that little housewife what about that factory worker Amen what about that one who just found their position living their life for God they got no pride in themselves they're just an empty vessel for his glory hallelujah we got to empty out all pride amen oh you got to empty it all out cast it all out till nothing's left but an empty vessel hallelujah now watch now what I see what I'm preaching you brother Brown said there's so many of us that likes to testify or we like to think that we are insufficient well that's right we are insufficient but he said but he said see but we make that an excuse come on now I have no education yes I have no ability I'm unable to do this and he said if you keep that up and do it that way keep going like that you can't amount to anything yes but the very thing that we make excuses by by our weakness God uses that very thing to tackle the job with hallelujah see he waits for us to get to that condition don't you see waits for you to get in that condition you say Oh Lord ah I feel someone worthy I feel so incapable I feel like such a failure God says finally I've got you in the position where you realize it's not your works Amen but it's my grace for you amen oh we take the excuses and says well I'm insufficient I can't do it and God takes that very thing to do the job with hallelujah oh my grace is sufficient for you my strength is made perfect in weakness God strength will never be perfected in a strong man and a strong woman see I'm not preaching compromised we're not preaching amen we're preaching grace not disgrace not leave anyway that you want to and either you're called or you're not I'm talking about a power of God that can make you live in overcoming life I'm in a life of no compromise a life of no DeFede a life of joy amen unspeakable and full of glory amen because it's a peace that passes understanding because it's foolishness amen to think that in all of the turmoil this life and the things that we go through and the ups and downs this life that we could have peace but our peace passes understanding because we're not looking at the circumstances we're not looking at the way it is but we feel that anchor every time we pull a little bit oh I know what I'm talking about hey man I've been through some waves of life huh I'm just a young man but I've been through some trials and I felt wounded in my faith and I've been through some things my brother my sister amen and that's when you know when you've been on the brink then you know that you're not the one doing the holy because if it was up to you you would have fallen away that's the grace of God hey man that's why I'm a believer not because I got faith but because the believer lives in the Amen oh yeah I have to believe not because I got faith but because I'm a believer and believers believe so I'm here walking in this faith walking in this light all by grace hallelujah don't make excuses anymore hey man your flesh has nothing to do with it hallelujah there's something you know you know when a young man walks through that aisle that's supermarket and something catches his eye there's a power that man that that flesh that I will be drawn every single time every time that I will be but there's a power brother amen that will cause your eyes to come back straight amen there's a power how the lujah went when you begin to feel discouraged when you begin to feel that defeat and the devil's got his food on your neck there is a power Amen you can't pull yourself up by your bootstraps but there is a power a mess that can lift you up and say I've been knocked down over and over again but I'm still here I'm still standing hallelujah glory to God talk I'm not hey man see I'm not preaching weakness I'm preaching strength but I see it's not your strength hey man but his strength is perfect in weakness amen that's why I love the grace of God there's something about the grace of God that you can make yourself too high for His grace you can put yourself on a pedestal you can be too dignified too important amen too good of a tutu too dignified our reputation for the grace of God to submit yourself to his will to his spirit amen you can make yourself too high for His grace but you can never go so low you can never get to such a look you can't get an a ditch deep enough that the grace of God can't find you and pull you out however if your seek God as long as there's breath in your body amen there is something a man that can happen for you you already go oh God isn't interested in great men hallelujah you know he came to Jerusalem he came to a temple that was built in his name it was the religious capital of the world amen by Abraham's religion he came to Jerusalem oh my you know there was something and there is this whole religious system that they had built and this religious system amen it pumped out so many important people there were so many priests and princes and everything walking the streets celebrities amen multi-millionaire televangelists and things like that amen great politicians and you know Christian politicians and and and all these great men walking around this city you know and even Jesus disciples begin to look at those things and they begin to marvel at these great men and great ministries and great offices you know and they said O Lord and Master look at what manner of great stones and buildings in look at the big churches look at the music programs uh hey man look at that Leone oh look at the little rallies and all these things that they're having Jesus said well you can look at that if you want to but he said that one of these days there won't be one stone laying on another of that whole system he was not impressed by the system he wasn't impressed by the important man you know what he did he went down to the temple and he sat there and he watched all of them big preachers and then big-name televangelists and all them big politicians and princes and thing he watched him all file through and make a big show of all of their religion amen and he never paid attention to any of them but the scripture says what caught his attention was a poor little widow woman amen hallelujah and she barely had anything to give just uh I looked it up just four minutes wages Worth was all that she had to offer but because it was all that she had I meant God didn't look at the value of her offering he was looking at it the totality and there was something about that with a woman think of it in the middle of all those prints and priests he was looking at that poor little widow woman that's this bride brother sister that's this bride you know day after day week after week she went down to that temple and she just gave all that she could she just came to church just wanting to pray she couldn't she wasn't a good singer you know she wouldn't uh she didn't have a gift she couldn't preach she couldn't do all those things she but she came to church anyway amen and you know uh you know here she's surrounded by the richest men of Israel and yet she's poor amen amen oh that whole system let her down amen the ones that should have been feeding her brother Jack amen she was under some ministry that was supposed to feed her the word but instead was pumping her full of man's ideas and she meant taking advantage of she was in an abusive home maybe she was in an abusive ministry her daddy and mommy worked together anymore amen her daddy was in jail or whatever um she was background she came out of she wasn't bitter she wasn't she wasn't looking at all those things she wasn't downhearted she was in church friends just giving or offering to God and she went over and over and over again but one day she came into that building and it was the right place at the right time and she gave that meager little offering and there was somebody there to see it amen now if it had been to the to the to the disciple Amen I carry her which gospel it was but if it had been to that of disciple Amen to write that down he never would have noticed that with a woman Amen but Jesus noticed her and now she's laying in the Word of God as a rebuke to you and I because we got so much prosperity and so we just give a little bit to God when we could give everything that we have a man and that's what God will do with a little housewife or a little teenager a man or a little young man amen without a lot of ability without a lot of dignity amen hallelujah when God sees a total offering men won't see it but God will see it and he will record it in his word he will make you a part of the word to this generation hallelujah by adoption but adoption is simple glory to God hey man you know all he asks is everything and for me that wasn't much hey could somebody testify for me that's not much all he wants is everything hallelujah glory to God God is willing God's interested in somebody who will give anything just empty their vessel out not be a great somebody but just empty that vessel amen I'll tell you I'll take you to another little widowed woman named Hattie right hallelujah brother Branham said brother man poke about how those squirrels spoken that third Pole manifests it he said it was the first time I meant that it was ever revealed ever first time it was ever manifested on the earth he said and who did God choose to reveal it to he said was it some great minister was it some great dignitary he said it was a poor little widow woman who couldn't hardly write her name Amen think of the great men and great churches and great religions around this world brother sister that have missed God's message altogether but who was I and who were you when the light of God's shone on your heart very man hallelujah a nobody a misfit a foolish one amen I'm so thankful for the foolishness of God so thankful for his choosing hallelujah he said God knows what he's doing god knows what he's doing there was the third little widow woman a man she lived in a time when the world had rejected God's prophet and it was really the church it was the nation that should have received Elijah they should have received him he was sent to them and they rejected him but you know even as the world was rejecting his message God had already raised up unbeknownst to her a little Gentile woman up in Lebanon a little widow woman amen and she's up there in Lebanon before she knew anything about it God had already picked her out and said you're gonna that you're gonna entertain my message you're gonna entertain my messenger and so she just going about her life just like you and I were and all of a sudden all of a sudden she encounters this man never seen him before never heard his name may be a man but maybe he introduced and said said God bless you you know I'm Elijah you know and and and he said I got a question to ask you he said look I'm up here with this message and the world's rejected it but I just know there's somebody to hear it and I'm just hungry the Prophet how oh he was so he was hungry for somebody to receive that message many times he got like I do he like we do you know he got so it felt so much rejection he said we're his like it was his eagle eyes glazed over he said I got to the place you know you know where he said it'd be like could watch somebody just walk off a cliff and almost laughed at so jaded so hurt amen oh my but see there was something in him that would press through all that hey man because he knew there had to be somebody to receive it so he could be rejected over and over and over again family would reject this message all these things you know we go through these things we we feel that pain of rejection what there's something in us amen something in us I'm just trying to take my time and let God lead right now amen but you see but you see this little widow woman God had already raised her up she was just waiting there and and all of a sudden she hears this message he says give me your bread anyway give me something to drink she said she said this is all that I've got I got this little I got this light you know I'm a deacon in the church you know I'm an IT manager in this church and and I got this position I got this career I got off he said but but give me everything you got he said I'm hungry I mean uh why don't you feed my message why don't you feed me a man feed God's messenger and you know how her neighbors must have thought she was so foolish a man oh you're gonna take your last meal Amen you're gonna take all that you have to raise your children by all that you have in this to make a living and and strikethrough somehow and you're gonna and you're gonna go down to that little legalistic Church down there that little Amish Pentecostal group and you're gonna raise your children in that and you're gonna raise them up that you're gonna do all that hey man but there was something a man an even she and her height she said how could I do it how could I pay this price if I go with this message my family's gonna kick me out if I go with this message my friends won't want to be with me anymore even if I go with this message that girlfriend she's gonna dump me sure as anything Amen but when she heard him say thus saith the Lord there was something in that thus saith the Lord that struck her heart and something changed brother there was a seed in or there was a predestinated something in her that she said take everything I've got I'm staking my life on a Florida not only that but I'm gonna stake my children on this hallelujah when she heard thus saith the Lord you know what happened Amen you know what happened Amen that God gave her something God gave her when the world was starving to death when it was famine in the land not for bread or water but hearing of the Word of God she was feeding on a spiritual food into season she was feeding on something denominational Church got weaker she got stronger Amen when her friends children were out in the world and a mess her children were in church praising the Lord hallelujah but you know the devil came in because he hated that woman for feeding Elijah so the devil came in he tried to take her children he tried to take her son right out of church just like he's tried to do to you mothers in here took that boy took that girl took you know take him out in the world trying to kill him trying to kill him you know what strikes my heart Oh a few weeks earlier she was a nobody nobody ever heard of her nobody ever noticed her you and I would have walked right by her nobody she was a nobody to the world but all of a sudden she's a somebody to the devil when she threw in her lot with dust saith the Lord all of a sudden she's public enemy number one oh and it's something to be something somebody to the devil but I tell you what is it to be somebody in the eyes of God amen I'd rather have that than all the fame and wealth this world has to offer amen I'd rather be identified with this thus saith the Lord I'd rather eat soda crackers and drink branch water and live in a live in a shack amen and preach this message this thus saith the Lord and feed on this food amen hallelujah them being some great preacher some millionaire how do they yeah I'll throw my lot in with this widow woman hey man because I know that there's life in this message amen I know that there's power in this message that's why I've given my life to it that's why I'll empty my vessel for this message because I know when I can't hold my family together there's a power in this word that's gonna hold them I know as my little girl rises up in this wicked world there is a power in this word that can hold her against the devil amen I know there's something in it hallelujah because I am a testimony Amen of a man hallelujah about 50 years ago Amen a modern-day Abraham was up in Minnesota a man named Ray Erickson and all of a sudden he encountered a message and there was something in his struck his heart and you talk about foolishness brother Jack he sold his farm he picked up his family he moved to Arizona he ended up in South Africa somehow he ended up in Israel somehow somehow he made it to Ohio and he's still standing today not only him but his children and most of his grandchildren in church serving the Lord because I believe that if you'll give your life to God's message I believe he'll take care of the rest I'm a witness amen that's something laid in the scripture for you as a believing mother with backslidden children to hold on to don't you know it's not you doing the holding off you're not the one holding onto those children but something greater than you a higher power amen glory to God you're just another Hattie right hallelujah amen it wasn't on the basis of her being a somebody Amen it wasn't a queen Amen or a first lady called brother Branham and said look that my boys are I want you to pray for my boys you know amen no real RAM said it it wasn't some aristocrat it wasn't some great minister it was a poor little widow woman hey man but it wasn't on the basis of who she was it was on the basis of brother Branham that is nothing but the truth hallelujah hey man you know under that elijah ministry under that elijah ministry when he came to that widow woman it was one vessel under the elijah ministry one vessel of oil one vessel of flour amen and God and that glory that oil that word that's the spirit and the word Amen was poured into one vessel amen and that was Elijah but looking when Elijah come amen under that elijah ministry there was another little woman with a son that raised up amen and God sent an Elijah which types the bride amen now with Elijah was one vessel but well God was fixing to do under the Elijah anointing under the Elijah ministry they said go get every vessel you've got and then go to your neighbor go off through the town go from church to church go shout it from the rooftops and bring your vessels to this message because I'm fixing to take the glory that I poured into Elijah's vessel and I'm fixing to fill up everybody I can yeah they said all Elisha Lord and look at its small Amen its humble amen it's got a little chips in it he said is it empty Amen oh it's an ugly vessel amen oh it's not it's got its its talentless it's a failure it's a wash up it to reject it's an outcast but is it empty then bring it to me and I'm gonna fill it with my glory that's what God's looking for this morning just an empty vessel for his word hey man if I were you this morning I'd lay down my pride I'd lay down my dignity amen if I was a young minister in this place I'd say Lord I'm emptying out my ideas I'm gonna preach your message holiday if I was a young lady I say I'm laying down my my ambitions my dreams I'm gonna follow your word

sloshing around in there whoa pure meal of the word hey man he multiplied it hey man he went found every vessel he could that's why I'm here this morning man I'm looking for an empty vessel hey man you know why there's plenty of oil left there's plenty left in this word there's so much treasure so much riches brother I can't contain it amen all the ministers around this message couldn't contain the glory of this message the treasures the rich but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power might be of God and not of us don't you love him let's all stand amen I'm
