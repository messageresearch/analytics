the dry and thirsty land where no water is to see that power in that glory so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary because that loving-kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless thee while I live I will lift up my hands and in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when I remember the upon my bed and meditate on thee and the night watches because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of that Wings will I rejoice my soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand upholdeth me but those that seek my soul to destroy shall go into the lower parts of the earth they shall fall by the sword they shall be a portion for the foxes but the king shall rejoice in God every one that's worth by him

living yes eat a man is he alive in your heart amen maybe as they continue to play that soft leadership our hearts Heavenly Father we counted a privilege to be here this morning we thank you for just watching us along the way just making our way down here the Lord and father we're under expectation that we could hear from you this morning I'm reminded of what your prophets said that any man with any human ability of his own can flip back the pages of this Bible but it takes the Lamb of God to come and break bread with us father the Lord you know the needs of your people this morning you know the burdens you know the trials the sufferings of God as a mortal man will always come short of providing what they have need of the Lord but you to God you're an awesome God worthy of all praise and worship father there's no no situation too big no no circumstances too grand that you can't take care of father the Lord I I commit this people into your hands may you bless everyone that's here this morning the Lord and those that couldn't be here those that are out for various reasons and father may the Lamb of God just feel welcome in this place and come and just speak to our hungry hearts if there's any debt sick among us let them receive their healing if there's any that Satan has buying the lord I pray that you just break the chain this morning mase may you come in a mighty way to Lord may you exceed our expectation and father will be careful to give you the praise and glory that you alone are worthy of father if there's breath in this body the Lord there's reason why we should just glorify your name to know that we have waken to another day the Lord adjust by your grace alone and for this the Lord we could say the God with such faith thank you Jesus thank you for your mercy thank you for your blessings thank you for our health just thank you for providing for us dear Lord we commit the remainder of the service into your hands and the bride says Amen amen god bless you saying she may be seated just for a moment I think that'd be all the singing ain't been certainly good in the good to be in the house of the Lord appreciate I always appreciate the opportunity to come down this way and minister and I for some reason I thought brother Jack was gonna be here I just didn't know he would be out of the country and but we always always feel at home whenever we come by here and man I'm trying to recollect the last time we were here but just kind of get you up to speed just you know the it's just interesting because when you look at you know just the last several months and I could all honestly say the last several years it's been a it's it's been a challenge in a road filled with just trials and you know and that's just a the way of the devil or he wants to kind of discourage you and and make things very difficult for you but we know in the God that we serve we know in whom we have hope and we know in whom we believe so and I kind of preface this and just kind of setting the foundation here you know I think it might have been five years ago or so you know lost my father then lost my mother-in-law they lost my mother you know within a short timeframe and unfortunately here recently within the last couple of months you know my wife lost her father and so it's been a it's been a tough journey you know but even through that you know we don't lose confidence in God you know I'm reminded of the Hebrew boys that once said to the king look you could throw us in the fiery furnace and I'm trusting God that he's gonna deliver me out of the fiery furnace and then boys look at the king says but let me tell you something even if God doesn't deliver me out of the fiery furnace we still won't buy down to your God you know you pray for healing you pray for lot of things and you know if it doesn't happen today you know it doesn't take my faith away if it doesn't happen tomorrow doesn't take my faith away I'm still not gonna worship the devil because my god is greater you know it's it's it's tough to see someone you know those that you love just kind of kind of go go on to be with the Lord and you just know that they're in a better place the last you know he passed up here in June I believe and I've been really struggling there and in my wife done her due diligence is to just be there and a support and it's just been really a trial in burden just you know the the sacrifice you know with missing work and you know you know and in the hospital out of the hospital and things were just getting really worse and we're just really trusting God and in the Lord saw it so I fit to just take him home and and and you know we just commit all things into the hands of the Lord and and we just you know been seeking God to be comforted but God works in very very you know mysterious ways you know our ways is not God ways and God ways is not always our way you know but when God does something he does it right and my wife and I we've been through a journey for I'm gonna I'm being bowled out here to divide and say the number of years only for her to correct me won't get in the car 18 years so we've been in the journey for 18 years and it's been our desire you know that you know we could bring life to this world and as we're kind of dealing with all of all of the challenges personally with losing a mother and losing a father and just you know just putting it in the hands of God and just trusting him the Lord saw fit to bless us this year you know I was talking to my boss and you know just kind of let him know I'm gonna be missing some time and you know and he knows that you know I've lost a mom and dad and a mother-in-law and he's like it must be something for you to actually tell your father-in-law that your wife is expecting I'm like yeah it's it feels really good to tell a father you know my wife is expecting them for my wife to tell her dad the same and but as if God didn't have a sense of humor you know he he want to make sure that he catches up on the years that we may have missed out on so you saw it fit to give us twins amen and not only that but he wants to make sure that we have you know the best of both worlds so we having a boy and a girl so just continue to keep us in prayer you know you could only imagine the level of just anxiety the level of nervousness anxious and every range of emotions you know my weekends look different they're not even born yet my weekends look different my whole world is revolving around them and I know I'm driving my wife crazy because console I'm like you're okay you okay won't you just sit down don't do I can't pick that I picked this up though it's just my mind's all over the places so just as new time parents we're just kind of going through the emotions and really really excited just overwhelmed with joy it's just it's really hard to express and really hard to convey but you many of you been with this journey with us and we've come here many times and we just trust the Lord that you know that the next time when you see each other again we'll we'll have two bundles of Joy's in our arms with us I just really ask that you continue to keep us in prayer between now and you know as long as the Lord give us give them to us so we just you know just under anticipation it's funny because every week where she's about 23 weeks now so we're the dill the the due date is December first eight or nine times I think it but because we're expecting twins they're anticipating that the delivery is gonna be some while surrounding in early November is what we're expecting so we're just praying for two healthy babies and we're just besides ourselves so so so we appreciate your prayers we just appreciate your support we just appreciate your love that you've always shown to us over the years and we're just exciting amen if you wouldn't mind just stand with me we'll read a few scriptures and then don't anticipate on keeping you too long but always appreciate the singing appreciate the fellowship and and I say this with all honesty I do really feel at home I never feel like out of place awkward I just feel like I'm at home when when I come down here and then just to trust that brother you know jacobi stolen an individual relevance is the closest thing to heaven here on earth is the pulpit and there's just such a respect that comes when you stand behind the sacred desk so just respect that and you didn't come here to see brother gene but you came to hear from God and that's I just prayed that I could yield myself out the way so the Lord could just bless you this morning and bless me this morning so turn with me to Romans chapter 8 we'll just have a few scriptures to read as an opening scripture and I'll let you have your seats [Music] romans chapter 8 starting at verse 18 say Amen if you there oh you man alright so reads Romans 8 verse 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who had subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body for we actually let's just jump to verse 35 same chapter verse 35 who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are all we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord may the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated you know for a moment or two I'd like to really ponder on a thought on what is your overall objective and it's just really important for us as saints of God to have a an understanding of what is what is your purpose what is your expectation what is your overall objective why did you come to church this morning why did you you know what do you praise God what do you worship Him and verse there's a reason why we've laid aside the things that we've laid and have committed ourselves to God and as I kind of build on this foundation the Bible if I could read that scripture again for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us you know we have battle scars and you know those scars are a reminder that whatever tried to take your life was not successful because greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world so I reckon that the present sufferings that you receive here every every false accusation every you know every harsh saying that someone may say towards you that the challenges in the of the course of life with family and job in school you know the Bible says that I reckon that the sufferings of this present time and know that Paul wrote it within his time but we also apply to our day that the sufferings of this present time is not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in you and I there's there's a there's a greater purpose tour to to or to the sufferings that you receive on this side of glory you said brother Jean it is really difficult for me but you can't even begin to compare the culty of what you're going through with what God has in store for you there is something that's in store let me tell you I've given up a lot you've given up a lot it's only because we believe that the promises that stated in the scripture far outweighs the tribulations far away's the persecution far outweighs the the trials that you receive on this side of glory there's a readers an overall objective to why you have committed yourself to God and I'll drop this in because I'm hoping to tie it in the Bible says according to proverbs 29 where there is no vision the people perish so you have to have a vision of where you're going you know we're not like seven billion people planet Earth they have no idea where we came from I know exactly where I came from and I know exactly where I'm going and the Bible goes on to say for the earnest expectation in a sense of the creature which really it's the creation it's waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God so all creation is waiting for the sons of God to come into full glory creation is waiting for you to come into your full potential some of you are sitting here this morning and are not really demonstrating your full potential to God and God is waiting for you now this exemplifies the patience of God some of you are already at your point of maturity but just because that one person is struggling doesn't mean they're not part of the kingdom of God just as much as God waited for you he's waiting for your brother next to you because the Bible says everyone that the father has given unto me will make it so the whole creation the earnest expectation the creation has an expectation of you and I to come to a full potential that's the reason why I strongly believe anything that's worth doing do it your best if you're gonna go to work give your job your best don't be lazy don't be a procrastinator give your job a hundred and ten percent of your best if you're gonna be a bomb then be the best bomb you can be but if you gonna do something give it your best if you're gonna come to church and worship God don't bring your problems and let that bring it down he lay those problem aside you say God you take care of that but as for me in my house I'm gonna give my God my gas and she could say to God and say to God with your best if he could pray and pray your best if he could give a testimony to testify your best every one of you are called for a purpose in the kingdom of God if nature can call upon God then you and I love voices you and I who can express ourselves can call upon God for the earnest expectation of the creature is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creation was made subject to vanity not willingly so creation had fallen not by anything they've done and so the Bible says but by reason of him who has subject the same in hope so God was orchestrating the great plan of redemption so when the creature had fallen because it was not the it was not creations fault that they were part of the fall they were just the Bible says they were made subject but not willingly so as a result of woman's decision subsequent to that every creation and every child has been born has fallen into sin and Christ had to come on the scene and reverse that but creation was made subject to that and the Bible says is because there's a greater purpose that God had intended for creation now because the creation itself because creation itself what are you talking about animal life whether it's on my plant life vegetation life marine life because the creation itself shall also be delivered from the bondage of corruption because God will be created the earth that was God's creation and so when the earth fell subject to the fall it didn't change God's love for his creation you you might be upset with God but it doesn't change God's feeling toward you you might wave her off a little bit but it doesn't change God's purpose for you you might go out there a little bit but as long as there's a magnet on the inside that magnetized with the greater Pole you're gonna find yourself black in the presence of you can't run too far for God because you're part of God's creation and there's a seed on the inside that's identical to God think about it this earth is a chip off the old block inside the earth is a ISM is a molten lava a ball of fire testifying that it came from the Sun so despite the the crust on the end sound on the outside the ball of fire on the inside is a testament that there are this part of the Sun I'm talking about you and I my God is a consuming fire if you want to look inside this body you see that does a fire that burns that's the reason why I cannot sit still because I'm a fire for God there are to be your attitude don't you get close on God God is a consuming fire if you find that you're not moving something is wrong if you're finding that you're too comfortable Church something is wrong you gotta be on fire you gotta be moving you gotta be about this gospel is so relevant that someone has to hear about it don't only say Amen here you gotta be willing to testify out there talk about it in the job talk about it in the grocery store talk about it in the school if he's worth talking about it in church then he's worth talking about it outside the church I'm not just a Sunday only Christian I'm a Monday Christian I'm a Tuesday Christian I'm Melinda Christian I'm a Thursday come on somebody I'm a Friday Christian I'm a Saturday Kristen when I come here I'm only a vindicated child of God I know who my dad is [Applause] [Music] I'm not embarrassed to be called a child of God now because the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption it's a glorious liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now the whole creation is agonizing the whole creation is anticipating up until now first one see that not only they not only the creation itself but we ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to it that is the redemption of our body so we groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption the redemption of our body oh son my church you know the other day I'm just a program I'm just passing through I'm not comfortable here and I don't want to be comfortable here you may not have nice houses but don't be comfortable with your houses you may have nice cars but don't be comfortable with their cars you may have nice jobs but don't be comfortable with your job you may have nice 401k a nice bank account but don't be comfortable with those things we're just passing through the Bible says then Paul County brings it to this point he he kind of understands he says the overall objective of every suffering the overall objective of every pain of every agony of every trial he says is it so that way we can undergo a change in the body let me tell you every night I go to bed I'm under expectation that when I wake up the next morning I'm gonna wake up to a change in the body every night I go to bed I wake up thinking there's a change in the body he's a bridging why do you have that kind of a mental thought it's because this Bible is more than just a good story book this Bible tells me that this corruption must put on incorruption this Bible says this mortal must put on immortality someone has to fulfill that Scripture if all this is for you is to come and get your religious obligation and to feel good that you come to church on the Sunday you've missed the mark but I believe this when I come to church on Sunday it's to offer me a reminder that this mortal must put on immortality and if it doesn't happen tomorrow morning I'm expecting it the next day your faith has to be so elevated that you believe that God and those are only gonna be one person that's gonna take a change in the body I'm that one person Paul understood the gravity of what he was saying that all this is leading up to a change in the body the Bible says Ruth shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness peril sword bills layoffs insurance doctors diagnosis will that separate you let me tell you many of us a lot of us we've been in this fight too far and if Steve's gonna come in my ears right now to tell me it doesn't make sense to drop it let me tell you you gotta look the devil in the eye say devil you're far too late I've seen too much I'm the witness of what God has done not only of what God has done in the life of other people I'm a testimony your testimony that we're not just worshiping a fictitious God we're not worshiping an idol let me tell you when I speak to God he speaks black I can't even begin to tell you there been times where I've been sitting where you're sitting at and I have questions in my heart as a minister and I've gone through the week and I just I'm overwhelmed with this and I'm overwhelmed with that and I just don't know what to expect on a Wednesday evening or a Sunday morning or whenever you may have services but when I sit in that pew and I'm under expectation I hear from God let me tell you it's no accident that that preacher goes off his beaten path and he's no longer sticking to the script and he's no longer preaching from his notes and he begins to go to a different topic that's not even related to what he's preaching about just so that way you as an individual so doctor speak to you you someone else might say that's more a man talking but I said God to man that speaking to me I have seen it countless times you my sister begin to shop to get to scream and you have no idea what she's responded to and for her it's God that's speaking directly to my ears God is very specific you got a problem you say God speak to him specifically God I'm having such a such problem you know about it I'm looking for such a such blessing you know we take a step back and we say he created the heavens and the earth and the vastness of space but yet we struggle we struggle and I find out minds to accept that your situation how can God take care of that situation ready you don't understand the bills are due Monday God knows there you know Stambler gee I might not have a job by the end of the week God knows that that's why I try not to give the devil any credit that I could possibly give him you might say what the reason why I got my last job is because I was a good end of your God put the words in your lips amen you might say bless him the reason why I got a raise because I'm a good performer God moved upon the grace of your boss's heart I'm not taking anything away from you I'm sure you're going and you do due diligence but your ability to do that is because of God's grace these are a dream the reason why I got this house is because I worked hard and I got money it's because God open the door of opportunity please go get the devil credit for anything and go to rely on your ability it's dance ability I never want to find myself in a position where I have to prove something to God Lord give me your blessings it's all by your grace that I have what I have it's by your grace that I have house in my body [Applause] we're different caliber of people I don't speak the same language that people out there in the world speak cuz I'm not of this world I may be in it but I'm out of this world you know we see this in the medical field in and I respect what the doctors do and the physicians and everything else but they speak this language you know and and they drop these words on you they've gone through years of school and they stay diagnosed you with you know with this with these words that you don't have no idea what they mean and the creates of fear they might say well you I've diagnosed you with cardio this that and the other and all these big words and you're looking at the doctor and your heart is racing you like what doctor will just give it to me straight how many days we talked about two days three days and the doctor then has said no no no no you just have the common cold is that what what did you just say that but the devil wants you to be fearful you tell you don't be fearful about what the doctors say your God it's the viruses the Bible says that he's a great physician that can be touched by the feelings of your infirmities when you can't understand what the doctors say you Tom let me tell you something doctor I'm gonna take it to another physician that could translate when you just said to me I got a feeling that his diagnosis is not gonna match up with what you just told me you do not have to accept what the devil puts in front of you you know you have a right to tell the devil no [Applause] hey man if you could recognize who you are that there's authority and power in your words because your words represent gods words I challenge you this morning to say I am healed and see how many devils will be obedient to that testimony I am financially blessed my family is safe my family is safe let me tell you for you but I'm making a declaration this morning I'm a child of God this word is not only for the ministers but this word is for you it was not only for the Prophet but this word is for you my marriage is home my children are saved you gotta be able to speak it and believe it and know that your witness God has given you those things hey man it's like I read this quote the other day you know it's just kind of call me this is why would you wish upon a star and I know Lufton time people do this but why would you wish upon a star when you could pray to the one who created it the Bible says as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay and all these things and all these things Paul knew what persecution was he knew what trials was he knew what tribulation was he knew what distress was then he says but in all these things he says we are more than conquerors through him that loved us you are more than conquerors you are more than a member who has come to warm up to be you you are more than an employee at your job you are more than a student in school you are more than just an individual at Walmart you're more than conquerors the world walks around fierce unembarrassed unmoved by who they serve they make a declaration they play take a position and they say well you know I have a right to do what I want to do I have a right to serve who I want to serve let me tell you and I'm gonna say this as respectfully as I can but if the children of the devil can be so bold then you and I who have the promises of God why are we walking down with thy hands hung down low why are we walking down while we're soaked down and lack motivation why are we walking down like we've been defeated let me tell you I look to you I look to Israel and the Bible tells me there's an empty tomb and Jesus rose above the ground then I too can walk up with my head hung high and know that I that I am more than a conquerer I'm more than just somebody there's a reason there's a purpose for why you're here this morning and Paul says for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels no principalities he's hitting up on some major life-changing events death nor life angels no principalities powers nor things present nor things to come Paul says look I've know I've had some fights that I've but God's grace I've I've overcome but I know there's still some fights ahead of me but I'm persuaded how many of you are persuaded I'm persuaded that nor height nor depth you can't get too high and you can't fall too deep it's like I was under Church when when when God when Jesus was walking the water he told Peter Peter come on that house and Peter went out with as much faith as he can and he was walking and as he was walking he started looking around his surroundings and is in the human mind always tried to try to reason things out like how is that even possible yeah that's just men's natural reaction how is that even possible just let it be because God made it possible and so Peter begins to walk and next thing you know he starts seeing the waves and no doubt that he started to kind of fall into some deep water and Jesus being there will not tell you to come out and not encourage you to come out without having a way to making sure that you reach your destination even when you begin to slip and fall he's still right there repeaters started to panic he started to splash water around he started to fill him you know started to swing his arms around he started to go over some water Jesus did not panic I want a god who's in control of everything you might panic you might see panic in my face but I like to look to a God who doesn't panic on a situation you know even as Peter was just just falling into deep water I don't see Jesus running to his assistance because c22 assumed that Jesus was running to assistance it's assumed that God was not in control and Peter might have been a little ways with Jesus took his little turn and he's wire just swinging drinking water he's worried about the animals the sea life underneath him he's wondering how he's gonna come out of that situation it's dark it's it's it's raining it's cloudy he has no sense of direction is that your situation sometimes you have no sense of direction you don't know where you're going things just seem so chaotic but God is not too far from where you're at cuz he said I'll never leave you nor y'all know the scripture now I'll never leave you you gotta let the devil know that that's what he said about you I'll never leave you nor forsake you and Jesus wasn't panicking he just took his son saw Peter Peter Jesus walk there and the Bible says listen to this the Bible didn't say that Jesus use two hands to pull Peter out like it was effort the Bible says he extended his hands he just imagined the grace of God just gracefully give me your hand it's not like I saw this one no YouTube thing this little book this little baby boy just like filleting in water he's just like he's he's panting everybody panicky it's like mom's like stand up little boy stood up the water is right here he was confused what it was right here you said you laugh about there that's why God laughs at your situation isn't control of your situation if you as human beings can see how cute that looks that's how God looks at your situation we gotta give him credit if he's brought it this far the Bible says he that has begun a good work in you will finish it God does not start a work that he does not intend on finishing you must have brother Jean you know I'm still on that journey God started to work in you he will finish it nothing can separate me from the love of God I'm a witness of too much I've seen the benefits I've seen the blessings the overall objective lamia kind of give us a historical background of this piece that that took place in history on May 25th 1961 Naima read this little article and it was from NASA President John F Kennedy announced before a special joint session of Congress the dramatic and ambitious goal of sending an American safely to the moon before the end of the decade a number of political factors affected Kennedy's decision and the timing of it in general Kennedy felt great pressure to have the u.s. catch up to and overtake the Soviet Union in the space race for four years after the Sputnik shock of 1957 the cosmonaut your have become the first human in space on April 12 1961 greatly embarrassing the US while Alan Shepard became the first American in space on May 5th he only flew a short suborbital suborbital flight instead of orbiting the Earth in addition there are other factors that was at play the Bay of Pigs and Fiasco mid April put on quantifiable pressure on Kennedy he wanted to announce a program that the US had a strong chance to achieve before the so before the Soviet Union so he consulted Vice President Johnson back then NASA administrators James Webb and other officials he concluded that landing an American on the moon would be a very challenging technical technological feat but an area of space exploration in which the u.s. actually had a potential lead thus the Cold War is the primary contextual lens through which many historians now view Kennedy's speech so the decision involved much consideration before making it public as well as enormous human efforts and expenditures to make what would become project Apollo a reality by 69 only the construction of the Panama Canal and the Manhattan Project was comparable in scope NASA's overall human spaceflight of space flight effort were guided by Kennedy's speech projects Mercury Gemini Apollo were designed to execute Kennedy's goal his goals was achieved on July 20th 1969 when Apollo 11 commander Neil Armstrong stepped off the lunar modules ladder and onto the moon's surface in which he says one small step for man one giant leap for mankind why is that important he had a leader that stood up before a nation and says we're gonna put a man on the moon and so it took everyone to play a role in this hundreds of thousands it took aa the engineers it took designers it took you know suppliers it took a lot of people to make this objective become a reality you with me so whether you were sitting in the executive suite or down in the did the janitorial staff everyone was playing a role so there was a response to this overall objective you with me and so people started to realize that the cause was far greater than themselves and so much there was a moment during a visit to them to the NASA Space Center in 62 President Kennedy noticed a janitor carrying a broom he interrupted his tour walked over to the man and said hi I'm Jack Kennedy what are you doing and the man responsible said while mr. president I'm helping put a man on the moon I'm helping put a man on the moon he was picking up trash he was cleaning toilets but he realized that his role was just as important as the men on the top who's making the decisions let me tell you might be sitting in the back or you might be standing up here leading songs every one of you have a role in the kingdom of God your sisters might never preach a gospel behind this pulpit but the moment that you're out there your life preaches a message [Applause] your purpose is part of God's overall objective you preach more sermon out there than a brother that stands behind the pulpit we may not hear from one sister that sits in this church but she might be a plane warrior constantly in her closet because everybody realized the overall objective of what they were doing so again I ask you what is your overall objective what drove you to church besides your car things let me tell you we're too late in the game it's the eleventh hour I got no time to play Church I've given up a lot I've sacrificed a lot I've turned I've turned the other way I'm saying I'm going God's provided way let me tell you I did not get on this journey for me to come and play church my soul is at stake my wife souls that state my children of that state I don't want to play games with God the moment I said I do I met that I am committed to this word no get quiet on me now Saints it's about to get tough your faith is gonna be tried your testimony's gonna be tried and I'm not talking about in the church I'm talking about there in the world if you could all fold your eyes to see what's happening in society lifestyles are becoming acceptable and when you're in your jobs or in your school they say we're looking for support it's easy when you're sitting in church to say Amen it's easy when you're and the monks brothers and sisters of like precious faith to say what you believe in what you don't believe but when you're on the battlefield by yourself and you got a guy who comes to put his hands on his hip to side he wants to know will you believe and it could be that he's your boss the devil will have you think about how you get your next meal how you gonna pay your next bill do we tell you say I'm not talking about stuff that I haven't gone see myself this is the reality of what you're of what we're part of but I know what I said yes so I know what I agree to I know I said Lord I agree to this that whether the Deacon sees me or not whether the pastor stands shoulder to shoulder with me or not I'm still gonna make a declaration that I'm a child of God nothing against the person but I don't agree with the lifestyle that IG will you or this little band and support I'm like nope y'all getting quiet now now I gave crying let me tell you say God is making you ready so I went you can have something to talk about when you get to the other side so let me tell you how it's getting Saints we're we're living in a time we're living in a day where people you know are changing the very natural state of being men are no longer men and women are no longer women there's a guy in my job that just went exactly through that transformation nothing physically changing I know there's people that does stuff like that but just in full appearance we're no longer to address him as sir but now ma'am no longer able to no longer allowed to use the men's restroom but now has to use the ladies restroom he's married he have kids and he's a member of leadership I'm a member of leadership so then there's an expectation of how you ought to deal with certain situation but it crosses paths with your faith we're in a real fight Saints the devil's will try to take bread from your children but the devil was never the one to give you bread in the first place God is the one that's your provider let me tell you I've so much faith in God that whatever happens to me I know that he'll pick me up back again and so now every time we see him I have a hard time there's like he has a new name now it's no longer his masculine name is now a feminine name and every time I see him I just gone by the masculine name because that's what his mom called him that's what God sees in him this one is soulless oh my faith oh yeah I get quiet but this is business ain't nothing to what you guys watch the face out there this is a real battle if they're not afraid to make a declaration of who they are I'm not ashamed to say I'm a child of God and then I don't agree with certain things there has to be a beacon of light in this day and age there has to be one that carries the testimony that Jesus Christ is alive risen I will walk him in just things that just happened to me realize we were on the we were on the on vacation and we and I was on a cruising and we had like a low excursion and it was kind of like this little not it's so quaint little town so her not walking we're holding hands and what happened with and I see two guys looking suspicious and looking all around them and big burly guys and they're looking all around them something my stuff okay so did things you ready go down so if faith day happens to me I gotta make sure my wife is okay because I know what they were up to and it was just kind of walking out this little narrow path not you are not even not really anyone else was just there in a distance and they were walking towards us and I'm walking towards him and those like and people were like we're in different spots but it was just that one corridor was just us four and no like in the distance and they're looking around and I'm thinking myself I'm gonna get one good punch in and Risa's got to run as quick as possible to get help because I'm not gonna be able to I'm not gonna be able to hold on to law so all this is go through my mind she doesn't know this all occurs as a guy you know you gotta you got to process a lot of things real quick cuz you want to make sure your family's protected so she's happy-go-lucky everything's fine meanwhile I'm recognizing danger in front of me so I'm thinking wobble to one good punch and she that's up that should be enough for her to run and not try to figure out if I'm okay or not so next thing you know we're walking we're getting closer and what what it was was that they grabbed hands started embracing one another because not it felt safe and I was just my monsters dropped in this arguing affectionate with one another I'm like unto big burly guys and my mind up take me I probably would I wish it was a fight instead then I would have tolerated I'm not making this up sense I'm telling you I see this and they're just holding hands and and and and Dow is still trying to do it and they will soak up several years ago and now Jim just trying to be in secret because they did that's how the feel towards one another and now whatever was in the closet is coming back out and you think they gotta be dressed a certain way act a certain way with the not so long ago we were down south we saw these two bodybuilders open public just holding hands and just the world is falling apart since you brothers be careful who you're looking at well I got stories I saw this one guy walking I saw lies I kind of ruin it there but I may had the most beautiful hair look like she'd like keep this stepped out of like a beauty salon I've never seen so hair so glistening and then the guy turn around a full set of beard that's feminine as you want to be y'all laughing at this but this is this is demonic this is this is what we're up against these young kids this is what they're gonna have to face if you don't lift up the name of Jesus Christ in your homes who's gonna let them know that there's a God who opposes that they gotta go to school they gotta face society but you wanna have a standard in your house that could declare sass for me in my house we were worship God the moment I realized that my wife and I would expect I said lord I need your wisdom I knew I know the generation I grew up with in the challenges that we face but when I see the young people today or schools to say hey it's okay for you to be is this all right what schools are saying it's okay for you to pick your gender identity it doesn't matter and my according to god it does matter teach him about God you know here's the thing the Bible says I was selling I was selling this sewer to an individual the Bible says that there are roles of Pharaoh who knew not Joseph there this it is not there arose a pharaoh who knew not Joseph one little scripture you know how it got to that point because the children of Israel stopped talking about Joseph everything that Joseph did to his family brought him into death that the place where their comforted and every Egyptian had respect for Joseph and when the Pharaoh rose up they respected Joseph and it was the responsibility of the Jews to continue to instill within their children Joseph and what he's done in generation after generation they talk less about Joseph and the Pharaoh rose up he knows a little bit about Joseph but not a whole lot enough to respect and not do anything another generation rose up another Pharaoh rose up no little bit heard of Joseph read a little bit about it another generation laws came up until finally after several generation their roles of Pharaoh when they mentioned the name Joseph his response was who's is Joseph don't ever stop talking about Jesus Christ every waking warning he talked about Jesus Christ even in the message people talk more about celebrities than to talk about Jesus y'all can act like I don't know what I'm talking about some of y'all know more celebrities than some of the Apostles that's in the scripture we can't fall victims to what's happening in the world we're a different group of people can we say praise the Lord let me say this was not part of my notes but y'all just bear with me this is what brother min says and I'm wrapping it up he says this he says that's the mighty sweet thing I'm so glad to be in the house of the Lord are you this morning there is only one better place and that's to be what the Lord isn't it all the hardships and trials and troubles of life shall blend away into a great glorious smaller and we certainly looking forward for the time that when we will see him and someone was asking me the other day do you think brother Brown that that the coming of the Lord is at hand I said I certainly do say well I've heard for it for a long time but I said one day you're here it for the last time see that's right cuz he'll arrive someday and whenever it is I just want to be ready we are speaking the other day before some business man that were attorneys and so forth and they said what's it what is what is your main objective in life I said I have one he said what is that I said saving souls for Christ that's the only thing that my highest ambition my in my and only ambition is to see Jesus Christ glorified I live for that that is my sole ambition it's to see Jesus Christ glorified let me tell many of you sitting out there y'all were fanatics when y'all had in the world you were cuz I was I was proud of what I did I screamed the loudest I shouted whenever there was fun I want to have the most fun but we've changed sides our eyes are opened up I now see the truth for what the truth is in the same zeal that I had there is not just change to a different zeal I'm still motivated brother Caleb ah I'm still excited I'm still enthused about God to know what lays in store for you and I I close with this the Bible talks about the Queen of Sheba her overall objective the Bible says in 1 Kings sin and when the Queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord she came to prove him with hard questions out here it is she's in her land and the message got back to her land didn't go out looking for it but the message found her you're no accident of God God found you when the atom sell it was God who became the first preacher the first gospel to say Adam we rocked out God didn't say hey where you at God knew his name that's the reason why the Bible says your name was written before the foundation of the world why because the lamb was slain when before the foundation of the world so she wasn't looking for the message but the message found her and when the Queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord she just didn't say man that message sounded good she didn't say man that sounds really encouraging but the Bible says she came so she had to get energized she had to put her faith into action and she came to prove him not with some simple questions but she had some big questions if he's if he's a guy he says he is and who everybody else say he is and he has all this wisdom well III got some tough questions so prophets is this the Prophet says it was a three months journey and this is a pagan this is a this is a person who knows nothing about Jehovah who knows nothing about Elohim and just heard about the message that was your response at one time you heard this message in like man sounds really good how can I get more of this three months journey she had camels and she put her faith into action and there was risk along that journey there were robbers and thieves along the way but that was not a deterrent for her she was committed to get into church she was committed to hear what the preacher had to say that's the reason why she got up that morning because she had questions that's the reason why you came this morning you have questions you have needs here's the thing there's not one need identified here this morning that God doesn't know before the foundation of the world there's not one prayer that you can't whisper that God didn't know that you're gonna say those things God puts you in position so that way he can hear from you because we talk to everybody else and let everybody else know your business and then you don't talk to God you probably should start there first come on somebody I got calls I got call sister Susan and I got call brother Tom nah talk to God first let him know your problems and keep in mind he already knows your problems there's not anything new that you're gonna tell God that he doesn't already know and she came to Jerusalem with a very great train with camels that bear spices and very much gold and precious stones and when she was come to Solomon she commune with him all that was in her heart she brought she came to church bearing gifts she just comes that way some preacher could preach to her but she has something to offer to the service sometimes you go through battles and you just come to church and you pop you're yourself down and the song leader has to come up and you're thinking he's suffering he'd better sing me happy because I had a long week and so so Lear try to sing you happy but you know what you got to change that attitude sometimes I don't feel like singing but that doesn't stop me from singing I don't feel like clapping but that doesn't stop me from clapping I don't feel like saying Amen but that doesn't stop me from saying Amen you gotta come with that right attitude each of you play a role in service and when we're singing a congregational song I may not hear your voice but God hears your voice still sing to God be in that moment think about the world capitalized on being in zone to accomplish whatever feat whatever things they want to accomplish what about you being that inspiration be in that anointing be in service some people sleep here more comfortably than they do in their own bed but as a preacher we see all kinds of things from up here we tab I stand up we time we read the scriptures and then we let them have their see you see some people get so comfortable in the chair they get it's like it's like they're making an S on the chair cuz they get ready go to sleep and the preacher got a certain time before because that threshold of that 30 minutes 45 minutes in a sleeve time because we get so comfortable but if I was telling y'all hey here's how you can make $100,000 by the end of the day all y'all be awake pens notepads everything ready to go y'all have your recording devices all your phones be up close we're all sitting right here in front of me because there's certain things that just excite the natural man but the spiritual man that's the banner that we're constantly facing that's the reason why the Bible says David says I encourage myself daily in the Lord what is your source of encouragement what motivates you what gets you going I was on the church I was certain that the church I said every morning I get up I will read a scripture because that's my daily source of motivation that's my daily source of inspiration that's my daily source of encouragement if I don't read a scripture if I don't start off in prayer my day is a disaster if he said brother Gina I don't know why my day went so crazy did you start the day with Christ because if he didn't start with Christ you started with a different spirit it's the reality Saints especially when you're running late from work and you don't get in the mind and the right and the right mind frame you're weaving in and out of traffic you're probably late from dropping the kids off you're running here you're running there you're late to a meeting or your lane to a task you go you get in you're frantic and it does your whole day out of whack when you find yourself in that moment take a step back I'm not telling you something I haven't done take a step back catch a breath and just still word of Prayer say lord I I started this day off oh I started it without you but I can't complete it without you and every time it's never failed me never once ever failed me and Solomon told her all her questions there was not anything hid from the King which he told her not and when the Queen of Sheba had seen all of Solomon's wisdom in the house that he had built in the meat of his table in the sitting of his servants that is the pagan scene what's going on in church in the attendance of his ministers in their apparel they're watching you in church for you you right here serving God right but when someone's visiting and they're coming in and they're just they're observing church order they're seeing how you worship they're seeing how you dress they see how you carry yourself they're watching you know there's your I her singing and they're just looking at you because they want to know what church orders like and that's what she did so she watch the Bible says she watched to meet at his table how the word was preached this is me to you she was listening to the meat she was she's listening to the meat I disabled and the sitting of his servants the positions the Deacons state the trustees say the musicians say the the song leader Tate they're watching all of this in the attendance of his ministers and how the ministry supports each other and their apparel the way you dress the way you carry selves and his cupbearers in his ascent by which he went up into the house of the Lord his the sin is how you went into the house of the Lord not coming and chewing gum hey God hey God that how you doing none of that just coming in a way that's very sacred and respectable as the prophecies and they it was just kind of veered away from it 30 minutes before church starts to get in that right mind frame because it's your moment with God it's your opportunity with God she was observing all that and she said to the king it is it was a true report the message was not a lie it was a true report that I heard of my own land of your acts and of your wisdom howbeit I believe not the words until I came and my eyes had seen it and behold the half was not told to me I'm closing with this thy wisdom and prosperity exceeds the fame which I heard let's all stand as I say this this last statement howbeit I believe not the words until I came and saw for myself and mine eyes had seen it and behold the half listen to this the half was not told to me thy wisdom and prosperity exceeds the fame which I heard I heard a brother I'm not sure who said it but he says and it's one of my favorite quotes that brother Ram says throughout eternity God will continue to unfold himself if you're excited about this message that you've heard if you're excited about what you have received that was what Paul was so excited about that was his overall objective can you imagine the glory that you're gonna walk into Paul says I've reached on to the third heavens and what I have seen no eyes have seen or ears have heard the promises that's in store for you and I I don't want to miss this for nothing it was no accident that a prophet went beyond the curtains of time and when he saw the glimpse of eternity God brought him back to express what he saw so that we you and I could be encouraged with what to look forward to that's what motivates me this promise word and like the brother said I've read the end of the Bible and it's in my favor we've won the fight let's bow hearts as the musicians come up Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace dear Lord we thank you for your message father I gave my best to your people bringing forth this sward this unadulterated Word this pure word father this word that changes lies this word that heals the hills those that are sick for your God that healeth all thy diseases you answer every prayer we thank you for your the grace that you've shown upon us

who have started to work in us will finish it we're not gonna give up now dear Lord as things are beginning to wind up the Lord as we see it in the out there in the world and in society draw us closer to your word keep us fortified keep us anointed in that message and if there's anyone out there that's lost their steam that's lost their enthusiasm that's lost their drive to to to to just push forward to God I pray for them even now that you may recan --dl that excitement about this message that's Jubilee that this message has come to give us but the Bible says he who the Sun has set free is truly free indeed we're no longer in bondage there's no reason why any of us should ever be fearful for you have given us a word a more a word that's a more sure word of prophecy that we could speak healing we can speak these things the Lord that the devil thought that that we didn't have access to but we have access your blood has given us access and we now know who we are were sons and daughters of God and we no longer should restrain ourselves but be in a position to speak whatever our hearts so desire knowing that the hosts of heaven such distinction it we pray for our families we pray for our loved ones we pray for our health we pray for all these things that we have need of the Lord there's not a headquarters Church that we could go to but we come to the author and finisher
