gonna go right to a look thought [Music] this even y'all pray for me it's a really been a blessing to me I've sort of been walking around with a little something in my Bible for the past almost six months and designed for the Lord to just give me something on it and when when Jack said I was going to be carrying the service I really didn't have anything and you know it's just amazing how the Lord just kind of just kind of just started freaking for things so I'll tell you what I'm excited about it and I hope I can deliver it amen so that you it'll be a real blessing to you amen let us grab our Bibles a man in turn to Ephesians six chapter Ephesians 2:6 chapter I hope it's not too slow and broken up but I know that there are some legate's in here a man that is that'll really help the bride of Jesus Christ amen we're gonna expose the devil this seen a man exposing you know when when this came to me I thought was I said I knew I said not a devil immediately when I when I when I came across this and it started breaking somehow saying how the devil gonna fight you on this but just the thought there's Kings ever really gonna fight you on this and it has been a real battle but we're gonna press the battle anyway Eggman Ephesians the sixth chapter we're gonna start at the eleventh verse and it reads put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil and I'd like to just stop right there for a minute and just ask the question what are the wiles of the devil so for we it says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood now I didn't say we didn't wrestle so if it didn't say we didn't wrestle we wrestle not against flesh and blood we do wrestle but what we wrestle against is principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that ye may be with yet that ye may be able to stand amen and that you may be able to stand I lost my place y'all hold on hold on okay as you may be able to stand virtually just how many where you take unto the whole armor God will but youbut you may be able to withstand the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins Girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation as water to Spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer supplication in the spirit watching their fall with all presence and supplications for all saints and for me the utterance may give unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel even the lure that our blessing to the reading of his word amen that our you may be seated I want to just give a little a little a little talk on if I had the title this influence from another dimension influence from another dimension we know that that the Prophet brought out how we live in a dimension of time matter in life we live in the region a man of time matter of life matter in life now you know we for some reason as human beings we get a superficial image of God a superficial image when when they talk about God is up in heaven and Satan is below inhale automatically we think about a horizontal dispensation we think about God being sitting way way way up high above the clouds and some magical kingdom from million million light-years away and we think about Satan being below some million miles below and beneath the earth but when it talks about being above and then below it's not necessarily talking about a geographical location it's talking about a dimension those spirits are just living in another dimension we are living in a dimension right now that we can't see all of the things that are going on in this room because we're living in a dimension of time now I have a chart that I will if y'all did you get the chart sister can you put that up on the projector a man we have this chart that that'll help and and I tell you what I'm not going to be able to finish this tonight but we'll get started on it and and and some other time we'll finish it up because it's there's there's just so much there's just so much here a man the Prophet says here he's thought it for Mars and come here flying at the speed of light light space or light speed it would take him a billions of years to get here he says I cannot believe that there is the house way out yonder see Jesus said I'd go prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also it's not a place some way way out yonder speaking he says God was speaking of a right present here now that that's the place where the mortal beings when we cease to be mortal here we step into immortality yonder into a place he says and I believe that's where Jesus is today the resurrected Lord Jesus not out yonder somewhere a million miles away but right here in their presence with us now in the fourth dimension people can prove that right through this room now is coming radioactive radio messages coming right through this building now it's coming television pictures but it's too fast for our eyes to see them now you go millions and millions of miles beyond that dimension and you'll get into a place that as real as television pictures is in this room this morning there is the Lord Jesus Christ to resurrect the son of God standing there and the reason that you can't see him is because your heart hasn't become tuned down to it and the reason you can't see the television where our bodies are not sent as instruments to pick up mechanical things but when our body becomes tuned with God becoming a part of him then our soul can pick up power of the Holy Ghost and indicate the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ and all of his power and omnipotence he has risen from the dead he lives among us today and he wants fellowship back with his people he's great majestic his glory is now spreading forth and he is designed fellowship again with his people amen now the motive beans is one of the things who lives in the mortal habitation immortalise lives in immortal habitations then the place that we go into until we return back to the place of brick and mortar and clay or precious stones and jewels it's not a it's I'm sorry it is a place of condition that we move out of this dimension that we live in another dimension and it's a house a tabernacle a dwelling place say destroy this temple and I'll raise it up again in three days and there and they all he was speaking of Solomon's Temple but he was speaking of his own body and he has gone to prepare a place for every believer that every moment we step out of these mortal regions we don't go out into some myth or some supernatural spirit but we go into a tabernacle a dwelling place that might be right here in this building this morning in this place amen so we realize that that that that our our spiritual I was spiritual antennas he says okay I'm thank you we see here on this chart you can't get the whole chart on I don't know if you can turn it sideways and not know okay we see here that we live here in and in the region of mortal beings here hey man let me see if this I can get now this don't work that do it am I ever amen thank you brother okay I see okay how do I get the corner okay thank you now we see here that we live here in this region of mortal beings but now we see here in this fourth dimension is the rim of science this fourth dimension is rim of science now here in this Trinity which is the region of mortal beings where we live we live in a light matter and time these areas are we contact this by our five senses see hearing touch okay our five sentence but now we have a sixth sense which is faith that can contact into this dimension up here the region of the bless amen now we see science here the fourth dimension reaches all the way up it goes into the region of the Laois into the demon spirits see and and down even into hell were to double himself the whales and you can see here where these open gates hey man that has been open that have contact from these regions all the way up into the region that we live in that is the reason you we see certain things in television and different things where people able to do movie roles or scary movie roles and all kind of filthy things and different things what are they doing you talk to some actors what they doing they have two action the channel themselves into this region to pick up inspiration from this region and bring it out into this region by science and television and radio and this is where we live to affect us in this flesh now they can't get our soul because the our soul is up just a little bit higher now we can actually tune into this area as well how do we tune into this area break it down a little bit if you see this little bit of thing over here says revelation by revelation see by revelation is how we get ourselves in tune with the spirit of the Holy Spirit which is right here in this dimension this is where our six cent you see here state the realm of immortal being this is faith this our faith context this let me read you some quotes it's a man a man I see okay you could either that brother you could don't worry now he says here he says here is a line like this they're all mortals on this side and on that side men are influenced by one side this side comes from God this side come from God you see this little line where is it right here it says this is the writing line between mortal and immortality okay now he says here that this side comes from the devil amen now let's just take a great conglomeration of blackness and gaiety and milk and sin and diverse knees of this world every once in a while you see a little white spot what is that he said that is a Christian like a light that though that those that are in the darkness are influenced from beneath let me read that again he says that's a Christian like a light now those that are in darkness are influenced from beneath those that are in light are influenced from above now now when you leave either one of these channels you go into the realm of the Spirit this is a model real the dimension that we live but that we live in now if you go this way listen close if you go this way the first dimension is the spirit of the day this way we live here if you go this way the first dimension is the spirit of the day okay say Peter spoke of it in prison that repented not repented though that repents it not by long-suffering in the days of Noah the wicked Unruh generated man when he dies his spirit goes into this realm the region of loss goes into that realm the next realm below these are demons the next room below is hell I'm giving you a parable so you can see it now what happens to that woman when she broke into the rim to the people absolutely are dead sin and trespasses and I was talking about I believe here the Witch of Endor let's see here absolutely dead in trespasses and that's all we know about the way okay no I'm sorry and that happened to the woman she broke into that RIM to see to the people that absolutely are dead in sin and trespasses and that's all they know about is the is the way the tree leans is the way the tree falls there she broke into that RIM talking to the spirits of the day now going this way the first thing the spirit of a man that God that died and rose again I'm talking about the other way not going this way okay going up we taught the first thing the spirit of a man that died and rose again Christ the Holy Spirit that's what influences the believer going upward the next is angelic beings the next is heaven itself the third heaven amen oh my I see something glorious when Jesus died yonder at Calvary a procreation for our sins he did not just just man but sinner not of his own but mine and yours sins sent him through the regions of the laws but can you get me a paper time brother Geoffrey thank you amen the sins are him and region and I can see him when he died young that caliber hanger between those two mile fighters crying my god why has God forsaken me and when he gave up the ghost he bowed his head his spirit rang and preached to the souls that were in prison that repented not in the long-suffering of the days of Noah down here thank you brother amen thanks we are talking about a real place what I'm trying to get you to see that this is not some mythical creation of a mythical imagination this is real when you are going through something a lot of times you can you can be going along it's a daily task and there is always the pole always of pull trying to get you to influence you from this region constantly if he can't do it through you he will do it through somebody close to you editor is always an influence from this region how because people Legion this land had was possessed by demons he lives out alone he believes there were two thousand demons we asked the question how does a man get possessed with two thousand demons prophets brought it up said you want to know how because he come to church any backslash they come back any backslash every time you do that you are adding demons and spirits to their person every time and then once you open that door and you yield yourself to that spirit it's not that the spirit becomes a stronghold becomes a stronghold you are then demon possessed demon possessed now we all possess my Sultan because here's the same way we possess from this region - and that's called a Holy Ghost in here in this flesh in this house a flesh that has to die it is an empty house that is going to be inhabited by one of the other if they found this house empty come Birds we gotta get the house you have to have that house full from this region to keep these boys I think he found an empty house you got a man Lord and a go yeah because what happened you are demon possessed hell no now when we I was talking to us about earlier today when we get to a point and we leave this world we cross this line the dividing line between mortal and immortality when our time here is done there is only one you can't take your belongings with you they stay here you can't take your car you can't take your house you can't take your lane you can't take your money the only thing goes with you is your character now whatever your character is influenced by whether your character's influence from available or your chapter is influenced from the load for the tale where you go it's a real place my brothers and sisters it's not some million million light years away it's right there you just change speeds as you rather get revelation as you give yourself to the Holy Spirit you you speed up now your body your motor body another speed up but you move into a dimension you are seated with him in heavenly places and what happened one day is your your spirit of speed up to a place in heavenly places so it is moving at the same speed and then in this room that your celestial body is moving and when you match speed for speed what happened you do like enough you still right over you can't as long as you're not moving at the same speed but once you get to a place where else fees match up that's perfectly you will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye into another dimension not some rocket ship Superman just still a man we gonna do some reading amen give you some clarity from the Prophet he says here in demonology here is a channel right here I don't tell you this before people he says I got a lot of Secrets in my own life of course between God and I but lookie here there is a channel like this that where mortars live in in it is a conglomeration of gaiety blackness and sin even though we're here in this Lady of seeing age this is what it looks like see every once in a while you see a little white spot okay a little white spot that light is or a little white spot or a light jesus said you are the light that sets on a heel don't light a candle and put it on under a bushel that's Christians in this conglomeration of this dimension of mortals we well going this a weight downward to the next dimension is the souls of the unjust who died not knowing God the second is demons the third is and the third in the Trinity of hell could you see there's a Trinity light matter here and then there's also a Trinity of the underworld okay and let's see the second theme of the Trinity of Hell unjust souls demons inhale there is a Trinity of them that cut into the third that's also a Trinity of them was called into the third heaven first is a ghost - the Holy Ghost the second angels the third heaven itself now these mortals in this dimension here is influenced either from there or from here now what's happened a man to that woman she broke through here in the dimensions talking about the Witch of Endor when she called the spirit of Samuel now the Bible many people fuss about her saying it was an impersonation of Santa we won't go into all of that let's move on now notice now this is business real good notice this here now he said now notice into the germ but God a man thank you no part with me I got to stay dry here I'm sweating crazy hey man what after the germ of life now you're just a teeny tiny germ before it was a germ what's after the germ it's life and you're in the supernatural you're in the sixth dimension you're plumb out of human reasoning you're into spirit life every little germ has a life that life comes from somewhere the life of cancer comes from the devil okay come from up come from the devil now your life comes from God that's the difference and God being manifested in flesh with christ jesus the anointed i just bless me God wrapped himself in a blood sail in the womb of Mary bought forth his life he lived a man he died a man he gave a man to give his blood that through his blood and the shedding of his blood that every believer could wrap in that blood cell the blood cell of Almighty God which him which is a born-again spirit of a man is wrapped in the blood cell of the Son of God and God can no more deny you than he could deny himself by one spirit where we all baptized into one body becoming partakers of the same spirit in the blood cell and the church wrapped into the blood cell of the life of Jesus Christ then we are sons of God joint heirs Jesus Christ in the kingdom you say Oh mother abandoned the devil got me no the devil don't you went out to the devil the devil can't get you you are dead dead people don't argue dead people don't back by you're dead in him your life is here in God through Christ and you're sealed by holy ghost how can the devil get you he can't do it that's right you get it now inside at one time by the spirit not by the letter all joined into one body not by denominations nor are we all bought into one body but by the spirit we are all baptized the holy spirit into the body whether you immensities Baptist or Pentecost or whatever you are one spirit and and it has baptized you into the body of believers and he says here now in st. John 5:24 be sure to read it thank think of the handful - I'm sorry talking about a dozen of eggs I don't know way coming like there but I'll get to st. John 24 he says he personal pronoun the individual not a group or whatever he that heareth my word and believe in him that Sydney has present tense ever lasting life and shall not come into condemnation but has passed from death unto life has passed from death unto life amen a man let's see here the devil can whip you around the stumps on that's not the reason I know I got it he says uh how you felt when you got it somebody said I felt good and said that's the reason I know I got it now that's not the reason I know I got it the reason i know i because i met god's condition and the devil cannot on the word its thus saith the lord that's it the promise of god I've met every condition and no I have eternal life the believer does it because he met the conditions in the requirements now we see here God was up here now up here he says God is or what spirit so when he was up here he had to come down to here wrap himself in a John a blood cell place himself in the womb of Mary to become flesh man he stepped down from his throne down through the dimension of Angel down through the dimensions of the Blessed into this realm of moral why to become us who were bound to go here we let those that died in the Lord here I can read it I can read it a man those souls under the altar oh my let's see here bear with me this is good he says let's dramatize it I can see him come down into the first dimension of lost souls brother branham knocks on the pulpit knock at the door open up the door well massive now listen now he says that welding massive beautiful women wretched hags man all screaming and crying and torment oh if I could get out here he knocked on the door the door swung open and stood the Son of the Living God in his celestial body said I am the son of God that Enoch said would come with ten thousand of his Saints I am the one Noah spoke of I am the woman's seed from the Garden of Eden the heaven has justified just testified of me the earth has testified of me Judas testified of me that's wrong the Roman soldier testified of me the father testified of me now you know that I am here to fulfill the Word of God hallelujah every demon know he was there oh when when he was on the earth they screamed and hollered we know who you are the Holy One of God they knew him even if the preachers didn't they knew who he was and they screamed let us out he said why didn't you repent slam the door all down he went did you catch that let me read that again we knew who he was talking about those demons and knew him every even if the preachers didn't they knew who he was and then they screamed let us out he said why didn't you repent slam went the door down he went into the below four demons through the light of demonology they scream and holler and got back they screamed and hollered and got back they know they were they win when he cast them out of the outcast amount of the man at guard guard guard our o the legions a man and and went into the swine and choked themselves they sent they seen the presence of that holy one among them walking walking through there and he had like a bunch of roaches when that light is turned on and in summertime when they there knowing at the Apple Court put me in mind of some preachers that turn the gospel light on they scatter don't go there and hear him put me in the mind of an old bunch of roaches in the summertime in the darkness they can nimbly go but turn the light on that's right all right the next thing he did was come on down through the other Trinity on down into hell and I can just see him go yonder and Satan walks to the door and he finally got there got here did you yes I'm here the devil said you finally got here he said yes I'm here yes I'm here I thought I thought you when I had you when I killed Abel I thought I shot you when I got Abel I was sure that I had you when I threw those through Daniel and the Lions then when I beheaded John I thought I had you when thought I had you well when you were like on the cross I thought I had you but finally you've arrived Jesus said yes I've arrived and I've arrived for one purpose you have put fear and chills over the people long enough I come down to take over that's right oh he said I'm the Virgin born son of God oh I I got it right Adam sinned but my blood still wet on the cross paid that sin yes sir I come down to take over give me the look the keys to death and hail he doesn't give the keys to the kingdom to Peter Peter already had the keys now I want to stop right there and make a point Peter already had the keys and Peter was still influenced from below and he had acted in that same of a chapter there when he gave Peter the king he had to turn right around and rebuked Peter did be behind me Satan he called he said no no no cause he'll capito was influenced from that spirit below when he said no and suffered to be so Peter this has to happen why so that this can happen so that so that that I can be down on the cross my blood can be shared let it be so that the Scriptures be fulfilled Peter was still at that time even though he had the keys to the kingdom was being influenced even though was more than it might have been pure been good but it was off the word a man says I come down to take over it give me the keys of death and hail he said he doesn't already give the keys to Peter the church yes sir he said give me the keys of death and he'll you notice when he rose up he had hangings on he had them hanging on his side give me the keys of death and here reached over reached over and grabbed Satan by the neck and throw him down put his foot on him and reached over and grabbed him off of him you fooled people long enough get back in there where you belong hang them he hung them are on his neck he says I'm the boss now my blood has been shared up there on the cross for the remission of the sin for the sickness you can't keep them any longer there will people there will be people who will believe me you can't bind them with sickness you can't bind them with fear they will believe hallelujah the keys of death and hail here comes climbing up mommy's coming back up she's coming near daylight I can see the big Morning Star looking around and grave and already it's coming on the third day and first wait he's got someone somebody else over here in paradise so he don't forget nobody amen and what a fitting song we sung past minato gentle savior hear my humble cry over here in paradise lay some soul Abraham Isaac Jacob Sarah and those who have faithfully believes the promise of the prophets and they laid there waiting a man amen so let me get myself together here amen so here we see a man that he went down he came down from this dimension a man it's not a place it was just a transference of dimension when he put on that blood sir came down here died on the cross went down into hell took the keys and then came up here a man now the souls are waiting in this holding place and then we'll all go together amen the Prophet said where that wasn't one day these our bodies a resurrect and meet up with our celestial bodies and put on a glorified body and when this has all been redeemed and we'll all live here together amen amen so I just want to want to bring now there's a couple of more things that I want to read I don't want to get too ahead of myself I'm not going to be able to get to there's another section that I are that that I have and I probably eight be able to get to it another time to show that how I was talking about the wiles of the devil and show how the in in that realm of science in this fourth room in this realm of science how Satan today is really bombarding we see so much happening in this generation with our I can't even say with our young people but he is really severely attacking our young people he's attacking the bride of Jesus he's really doing a work on us in why because we have come this as a people we've come so comfortable and we've reached in into the tree of knowledge and good and evil and will constantly pull them out of this dimension and bringing it over into here and what we don't realize is we're desperate those are influences from here and that's how they're being introduced into this room you wonder why we see kids shooting up and schools and distant in the other let me give you it's another place here that I want to read where and I just have to paraphrase it my notes are all over the place but where the Prophet said he he as a prophet a prophet is a seer he said he lives most of the time in this dimension that's how he's able to see what he sees that's how he's able to he lives in this dimension he said in one place those he said those spirits come up from beneath and they speak one to another he said he was pre-emphasis if you can only if you're sick if you can only get out of this room up into this room this is where your healing takes place but when we come to church a lot of times let me let me back up as Lord honest it is we realized that there are voices through the radio waves here through science in this dimension he said they're passing through this building right now a lot of times we come to church and you ever just seem like you just can't focus in on the Word of God Wow because you're still here in your flesh he said you have to get to a point where you get out of your flesh and you elevate into this room and then you hear from heaven he said so many times we come and we sit with our arms full he says what's happening in your mind those voices you probably you probably hear them right now probably sitting there talking about oh yeah something things are always coming to your mind the mind is the battlefield did I leave that part oh man I forgot to get gas before I came to church oh I wonder what I'm gonna do at work tomorrow he could hit a Word of God going forth and all of these things these thoughts are running through your mind that's him trying to keep you grounded keep you grounded here that you don't get here to receive from God you have to press your way you have to press your way out of this realm of flesh into this room of how did he call it he said into this channel where you can hear from God where you can receive from God in the upper room and acts who they said they were all in one Accord they were all in one Accord they weren't all in this in one place in one Accord what happened they had all got into a channel they had all got into that channel and then came a sound from heaven as a mighty rushing wind and I believe the night that if we can come to church and we can all just get in that channel see he said here and I'm not mean I'm just talking I ain't gonna read it he said that that one person your neighbor sitting next to you might be struggling but if you can get into that room you we'll help your neighbor you would chase that demon away from your neighbor that your neighbor can get into that room and vice versa you come in here with all these mind battles dragging down the service it's just as easy for that spirit to get on your neighbor and drag them down to that's the truth that's the truth so when we come we talked about being positionally placed we all have a job to do the preacher back there before the Lord and and and just the studying and then trying to bring something to help the people village is what God that just happens wait but we all have to come and put our licks of fire together all in one place and in one Accord we'll see mighty things done and I miss if we can all get out of flesh and get into this realm I'm gonna be closing now I just want to give you a little teaser I'm not going to get all into it because it's quite lengthy okay this is an article from a child psychologist and this child psychologist D that if you you can actually google it it's called the undoing of the families and it is it is a wake up call you wonder what's going on in society technology has mailed itself together with psychology that you got two forces technology and psychology has come together to control the minds of the people to literally control the minds of your people of all of us it is called there is a school at Stanford University a clay Civ technology let's see who went to that school the co-founder of Instagram Facebook all loving from these little video games they are strategically designed medical science are calling them addictions it triggers a certain dopamine in your body to make you feel a certain way and you get hooked now what is the
