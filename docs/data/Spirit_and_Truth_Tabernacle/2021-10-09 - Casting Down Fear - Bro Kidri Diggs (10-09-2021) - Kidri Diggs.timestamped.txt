[24:54] the book of numbers the 14th
[24:57] chapter
[25:06] you know what let's back up to 13 and um
[25:10] verse um
[25:15] verse 31
[25:19] numbers
[25:21] 13
[25:22] and
[25:23] 31.
[25:32] if you ever say man
[25:35] the bible says but the men that went up
[25:37] with him
[25:39] said we be not able to go up against the
[25:42] people
[25:43] for they are stronger than we
[25:46] and they brought up an evil report
[25:50] of the land which they had searched
[25:53] unto the children of israel saying the
[25:55] land
[25:56] though which we
[25:58] have gone to search it
[26:00] is a land that either the inhabitants
[26:03] thereof and all the people
[26:05] that we saw
[26:07] in it are men of great statue
[26:11] and
[26:12] and there we saw
[26:14] the giants the sons of anak which come
[26:18] of the giants
[26:19] and
[26:20] we were in our own sight as grasshoppers
[26:25] and so
[26:26] we were in their sight
[26:29] now they were afraid of the giants who
[26:31] had enough courage to go talk to them
[26:33] and see how they look in the eyes
[26:40] chapter 14 verse 1
[26:42] and all the congregation
[26:44] lifted up their voice and cried
[26:47] and the people wept that night and all
[26:50] the children of israel mumbled against
[26:52] moses and against aaron and the whole
[26:54] congregation said unto them
[26:57] would god that we had died in the land
[27:00] of egypt or would god we had died in
[27:04] this wilderness let's go to job chapter
[27:07] 3.
[27:24] and i just want to read um
[27:28] let's read verse 25.
[27:32] the bible says for the thing which i
[27:34] greatly feared is come upon me and that
[27:37] which i was afraid of
[27:40] is come unto me
[27:43] amen may the lord a blessing to reading
[27:45] of his word you can
[27:46] have your seats
[27:49] and i just want to quote another verse
[27:51] of scripture as you're sitting first
[27:53] john
[27:55] chapter 4 and 18 he said there is no
[27:57] fear in love
[27:59] but perfect love cast out fear
[28:01] because fear have torment
[28:04] he that feareth is not made
[28:06] perfect in love
[28:09] amen tonight i'm sure you can tell by
[28:11] the scriptures i've read
[28:13] that we're going to be talking about
[28:14] fear tonight
[28:16] you know and and we want to kind of make
[28:19] it in a statement
[28:21] to
[28:23] tell each and every one of you tonight
[28:25] cast down fear
[28:27] you know because god has not given us
[28:29] the spirit of fear
[28:31] but of love power and a sound mind
[28:34] but if we examine the believer you know
[28:38] and if we would just uh
[28:40] look at the scriptures real quick if we
[28:42] go
[28:43] and i'm gonna kind of backtrack a little
[28:44] bit but if i go if we go back to the
[28:47] book of numbers right here
[28:49] and
[28:50] we see the children of israel
[28:53] you know the whole reason the whole
[28:55] reason how they got
[28:57] to the land to see the giants was based
[28:59] upon believing god's promise
[29:02] you know and i think sometimes we get we
[29:04] get uh um
[29:06] a little bit overzealous on the journey
[29:09] where we see things not going our way
[29:12] but one thing you got to realize if you
[29:14] find yourself in a certain place
[29:17] and you backtrack and you're here
[29:20] was that step a step of faith or fear
[29:24] and for them to get to the promised land
[29:27] was a step of faith but they brought
[29:29] fear with them
[29:31] so if we think about a church how often
[29:33] us as believers
[29:35] we supposed to be creatures of faith
[29:38] but we're bringing fear with us
[29:41] and it's too many times that
[29:44] we change god's testimony
[29:47] based upon our own imaginations of fear
[29:50] now if you look right here uh if we just
[29:53] go to chapter 13
[29:55] uh by god's grace
[29:57] you know um
[29:59] they clearly said i'm just kind of
[30:00] paraphrased but they clearly said uh in
[30:03] verse 27 he said they told him and said
[30:07] in chapter in chapter 13 they told him
[30:09] and said we came unto the land whether
[30:12] thou sent us and surely
[30:15] look at that
[30:16] they speaking faith right now
[30:18] they went into the land
[30:20] whether thou sent us and surely
[30:24] surely without a doubt
[30:26] surely god
[30:27] what you promised
[30:29] surely god what i seen
[30:32] truly god what i heard
[30:34] it is there
[30:37] there's no doubt it's there
[30:39] i don't care what they say about the
[30:41] message surely
[30:43] it's there i've tasted it i've held it i
[30:47] put it in my hands i've seen god do it
[30:51] surely church
[30:55] this is their testimony
[30:58] they're speaking faith right now why
[31:00] because they see what god promised them
[31:03] hallelujah
[31:04] church how often do we see what god
[31:07] promised us but we get a little
[31:09] discouraged on the journey and then we
[31:12] change
[31:13] he says surely
[31:15] it flowed with milk and honey he had the
[31:18] evidence of the promise
[31:20] not just them but every even the ones
[31:23] that brought up a false report surely
[31:28] those that are saying that
[31:30] malachi 4 was a prophet
[31:33] surely
[31:35] they seen it
[31:40] they see it
[31:42] some of the preachers then gave
[31:43] testimonies
[31:45] about what god has done
[31:48] surely
[31:49] surely
[31:50] the lamb floored with milk and honey and
[31:53] this is the fruit of it church
[31:55] not only did they see it they brought it
[31:58] back
[32:02] it's time for us to stop doubting god
[32:04] hallelujah god has done so many great
[32:07] things for us he's given us evidence
[32:09] he's giving us proof we're bringing it
[32:11] back to church
[32:13] church you think about this you are not
[32:15] to be discouraged hallelujah you have to
[32:17] be discouraged god has done great things
[32:19] for the people of god
[32:21] what is another church building to god
[32:24] [Music]
[32:29] he owns a cat on a thousand heels
[32:32] hallelujah
[32:33] i was in trinidad one time and i made
[32:36] that statement and i said i said i said
[32:39] god our god owns a count of a thousand
[32:42] hills and i said y'all ain't got that
[32:44] y'all i said y'all don't have that idea
[32:45] in trinidad
[32:47] and the brother looked at me he said
[32:49] brother d that statement now we have a
[32:51] lot of hills i say but do you got cattle
[32:53] on it
[32:57] you got to heal but do you have all the
[33:00] characteristics that makes up god
[33:02] see that's what we want holy we want
[33:04] everyone every portion of god
[33:07] we want all the things of god but church
[33:10] you look by god's grace i'm gonna be too
[33:12] long tonight y'all know i'm about to
[33:14] close
[33:16] now just as fast as they spoke faith
[33:19] look at the next verse
[33:21] it says
[33:22] nevertheless the people be strong
[33:26] they haven't even fought a battle yet
[33:29] where is it coming from where is the
[33:31] strip coming from
[33:33] hallelujah they be strong that dwell in
[33:35] the land and the cities are walls and
[33:38] very great and moreover we saw the
[33:40] children of attic that was the problem
[33:45] they hadn't fought anybody
[33:47] but the problem was the imagination of
[33:50] the eyes took over their destiny
[33:54] don't let your eyes take over your
[33:56] destiny
[33:58] because surely they believe what god
[34:00] said but in the next verse they're
[34:03] looking at what they saw in the land and
[34:05] it changed their whole thought
[34:07] not only their thought it changed their
[34:10] perception of who god is
[34:17] how often because of what we see in the
[34:20] natural changes who we are in the spirit
[34:26] amen cast down fear
[34:31] because of fear they hadn't even fought
[34:33] a battle yet
[34:34] and they said the cities are great the
[34:37] children of anak are there that was the
[34:39] whole problem
[34:41] the problem was hollywood look they had
[34:44] all the evidence they had the fruit
[34:46] everything that god said was true but
[34:48] because the children of anarch were
[34:50] there because it wasn't something they
[34:52] had to fight for
[34:55] because they had to fight for it it
[34:58] changed the whole complexity of the
[35:00] promise
[35:01] holy
[35:02] but god does that on purpose
[35:04] god will promise you something and then
[35:06] he wants you to fight for it
[35:09] why because you fight for it and win
[35:11] that'll deal with your fear
[35:14] hallelujah if you fight and win when you
[35:16] go to the next battle you go with a
[35:19] testimony that i can do this hardly
[35:21] that's what david did by the time he got
[35:23] to goliath
[35:25] he didn't have no fear why because he
[35:27] already defeated a lion and a bear
[35:30] holy his fears were already overcome in
[35:33] those two testimonies hallelujah so it
[35:36] wasn't church david's strength that
[35:39] defeated goliath it was his testimony
[35:46] hallelujah
[35:48] so cast down your fears
[35:50] and step back into your testimony
[35:53] because you know i was preaching a
[35:54] message at the home church and my title
[35:57] was i seen them do it
[36:02] you can't come to me and tell me god
[36:05] ain't no healer i've seen them do it
[36:07] you can't tell me god can't create a
[36:10] child i see them do it you can't tell me
[36:13] god can't put checks in the mail i see
[36:16] them do it
[36:18] hallelujah you can't tell me in a pill
[36:21] of fire i see them do it
[36:23] you can't tell me angela a provider i
[36:26] see them do it
[36:33] [Music]
[36:38] this is a time where you are to be
[36:40] celebrating your god
[36:42] y'all got to be afraid
[36:44] church we seen him do it
[36:47] he is still jehovah
[36:49] let me let me get away from that
[36:52] let me get away from that
[36:53] but church look
[36:56] look
[36:58] at this verse chapter 13
[37:00] look at them now that first they had a
[37:02] testimony of faith then they go into a
[37:04] testimony of fear
[37:06] but then it took a believable to come in
[37:08] verse 30 saying caleb steal the people
[37:11] before moses and said let us go up at
[37:14] once let's get all this fear out to camp
[37:17] let's get all this fear out of the
[37:18] church we have seen god do some great
[37:20] things see there has to be somebody in
[37:23] the midst of the people that can steal
[37:25] the people hardly when you see things
[37:27] going on in church don't get caught up
[37:29] in the negative amen stay away from
[37:31] negative people hallelujah because
[37:33] negativity is a sign of fear hallelujah
[37:36] hallelujah but you know church there has
[37:39] to be somebody that can stand up and say
[37:41] i will not be afraid
[37:44] hallelujah hallelujah fear is not an
[37:48] attribute of the believer
[37:50] hallelujah
[37:51] because church if if
[37:53] if by the grace of god i can show you
[37:55] something tonight
[37:57] you know if we think about the whole
[37:58] concept of fear
[38:01] and where it comes from
[38:03] hallelujah
[38:04] you know in the beginning
[38:07] god created man
[38:10] and when he created man holy
[38:12] it was a sovereign act of god
[38:15] when he created man he was in his image
[38:18] and likeness he looked just like god but
[38:21] you know that something happened one day
[38:23] where the woman hallelujah began to have
[38:26] a conversation with the serpent hernia
[38:28] and she went on and went on with the
[38:31] serpent look church
[38:32] how could she have a conversation with
[38:35] the serpent and do what the serpent
[38:37] asked her because she was being deceived
[38:40] see there's no fear in deception
[38:47] that's why we can look at something
[38:48] we'll say i'm not going to do that
[38:50] because we see the truth
[38:52] but then there's somebody else to say i
[38:54] don't believe this and i don't believe
[38:56] that god ain't just in god ain't that
[38:58] it's because they deceived that's why
[38:59] they don't fear god hallelujah and when
[39:02] i say we fear god we fear him with a
[39:04] reverence we don't fear him to run away
[39:06] from him
[39:08] hallelujah so church hallelujah when you
[39:10] see people leave this truth and they're
[39:13] not afraid of god's judgment it's
[39:14] because they're being deceived
[39:17] because a person can easily go into
[39:19] something when they don't understand the
[39:21] consequences
[39:28] that's why a woman can cut a half she
[39:30] can dress all kind of ways a man can do
[39:33] sinful things commit adultery and do all
[39:35] these things because they're living
[39:37] under a life of deception
[39:39] and they they don't have a chance
[39:41] hallelujah to be caught up in fear
[39:44] because they're being deceived
[39:45] holy and in those moments listen church
[39:48] god told them the day you touch of it
[39:50] you gonna surely die so why didn't eve
[39:53] the first time she committed to act with
[39:55] the serpent say oh my god what have i
[39:58] done
[40:00] she couldn't say it
[40:02] she was under
[40:04] an act of deception
[40:07] and that's how satan normally does holly
[40:09] if you can easily go out there commit
[40:12] sin and do all kind of crazy things it's
[40:14] because you're under a deception
[40:19] hallelujah
[40:20] but look holly
[40:22] she came and she gave to adam
[40:25] and once she gave to adam hallelujah
[40:27] adam he took off he did the same thing
[40:30] but look they were together everything
[40:32] was fine
[40:33] till god came down
[40:38] and when god came down he didn't come
[40:41] down a different way holly see god don't
[40:43] change he came down like he always done
[40:46] but now because they got sin in their
[40:48] lives they begin to fear the coming of
[40:51] the lord
[40:53] hallelujah when they never feel god in a
[40:56] life what caused them to fear their sin
[41:00] the act of sin brings fear into the
[41:03] human being's life
[41:08] oh my
[41:09] in church from there holier adam holly
[41:12] heard god calling his name even with sin
[41:16] in his life
[41:18] and you know i get sick of people using
[41:20] those excuses where i got this and i got
[41:22] that if god can call the name of the two
[41:26] who started sin and they hear him what's
[41:28] your excuse
[41:32] cause they committed the first act of
[41:34] sin which caused all of us to be in the
[41:36] condition we in but in their sins they
[41:39] still heard god calling their name
[41:42] adam allen where are thou and listen to
[41:45] their response adam says we heard you
[41:48] calling us
[41:52] and we were afraid
[41:58] we were afraid
[42:00] church
[42:01] why am i dealing with this because the
[42:03] prophet of god said we got to get the
[42:04] fear out of people's heart
[42:06] hallelujah
[42:08] listen
[42:08] even though they were created in the
[42:10] image of god they could still because of
[42:12] their sins be overcome by their fears
[42:15] and now church in this moment hallelujah
[42:18] adam say we heard you calling us and we
[42:21] realized we were naked
[42:24] they always was naked
[42:26] so why are they now afraid
[42:30] it's the act of sin in their life but
[42:32] what i want you to understand what's so
[42:34] powerful about this church in this
[42:36] moment you think about the believer
[42:38] what's the first attribute of sin it's
[42:40] not spoken it's not drinking hallelujah
[42:43] what's the first attribute it's fear
[42:47] first thing we see at the adultery
[42:49] hallelujah that caused the whole thing
[42:51] to down sparrow was the attribute of
[42:53] fear
[42:54] because god came down call their names
[42:57] and begin to have a meeting with them
[42:59] like you've always done because god is
[43:01] faithful
[43:02] hallelujah so there was nothing but god
[43:04] there was nothing about god that changed
[43:07] but now they're in a different situation
[43:09] and they're looking at god different
[43:13] fear will make you look at hollywood
[43:16] look at the one that love you look at
[43:18] the one that gives you strength look at
[43:20] the peace giver different
[43:22] and in this moment god never changed but
[43:25] now because they got fear in their life
[43:27] they're running from god
[43:34] cast down fear
[43:36] so what's happening
[43:38] what's happening church
[43:40] they never even had a reason to be
[43:42] afraid of god
[43:45] because god never had to bring judgment
[43:48] but now with fear and all these sins is
[43:52] changing god's testimony
[43:55] unto them holly but now they're not
[43:58] looking at him as the great god of
[44:00] worship they're looking at him as god
[44:01] they're terrible we got to go hide
[44:03] ourselves because he's going to kill us
[44:04] and he's going to this and he's going to
[44:05] that god going to do this and god gonna
[44:07] do that see now fear is a perversion in
[44:10] your imagination
[44:13] and now their imaginations are creating
[44:15] all these these these thoughts and
[44:17] patterns of god and they say we ran and
[44:19] hit ourselves and put on
[44:21] fig leaves you know and all these things
[44:24] but i like god's response if you go back
[44:26] and you actually they talking to the
[44:28] lord first thing god says is who told
[44:31] you you was
[44:33] [Music]
[44:35] yes naked your nakedness my nakedness is
[44:37] not a surprise to god god know the areas
[44:40] in our life that we're weak god know the
[44:42] areas in our life that are uncovered
[44:45] hallelujah but where there was doubt sin
[44:47] it was just innocence to god
[44:50] but as soon as sin came in it changed
[44:53] the whole scope of how god had to deal
[44:54] with his people but you look what he
[44:56] said he said who told you was naked see
[44:59] god didn't act surprised god didn't say
[45:01] you're naked
[45:02] oh my god
[45:04] oh my adam
[45:06] what are you doing adam you're naked
[45:08] oh my god eve you're naked he said who
[45:12] told you you was naked
[45:13] see god already knows hallelujah what
[45:16] your fears are all about
[45:24] who told you you was naked and you know
[45:26] what people do when they're afraid
[45:28] it was the woman
[45:32] that's what fear does
[45:34] fear will never hallelujah
[45:37] take the act upon itself
[45:39] it'll always push it off
[45:41] because you don't want to be found out
[45:43] he was a woman he said he was a serpent
[45:46] the serpent couldn't accuse nobody
[45:51] so he had to take it
[45:53] and from there
[45:54] man began to carry fear and faith in the
[45:58] journey at the same time
[46:03] hallelujah if you even go hollywood we
[46:06] if we just take some bible characters
[46:08] and go on up a little bit let me show
[46:10] you even though hello moses was born a
[46:13] special child wasn't he
[46:15] he was a special child but don't you
[46:17] realize he had fear in his life
[46:20] he was born a deliverer
[46:24] so he had a gift of faith already laying
[46:26] there to believe god when that thing
[46:29] came to maturity but at the same time he
[46:32] had fear
[46:34] because when god calls him holy moses
[46:36] made every excuse in the book
[46:39] i can't talk i can't just i can't do
[46:41] this and the people ain't gonna hear me
[46:43] at all what's talking fear
[46:45] he's afraid to make a mistake
[46:48] he's afraid that he's gonna fail trust
[46:50] me god will never call you to lose you
[46:56] you might be saying what about this
[46:58] person what about that person what about
[47:00] it that's right
[47:01] what about it that's right
[47:03] who can understand the mind of god
[47:05] trust me in the kingdom of god nothing
[47:08] is out of order hallelujah
[47:11] but church at that point moses making
[47:13] all kinds of excuses you know what god
[47:15] had to do to deal with his fears first
[47:17] thing god told me to do was shut up
[47:19] moses
[47:23] stop talking all that unbelief shut up
[47:27] and what god does
[47:29] when we talk fear when he know the
[47:30] element of faith is there
[47:33] holy he changes the way we begin to
[47:35] think about ourselves by speaking over
[47:38] us
[47:39] and then what he tells moses moses
[47:40] making all excuses and he tell more he
[47:42] said moses who made your mouth
[47:48] see now god's gonna elevate his thinking
[47:50] hallelujah he's gonna get rid of the
[47:52] fear and deal with some faith hardly he
[47:54] begins to tell moses a lot of good
[47:56] things about himself but then he takes
[47:58] moses into a place he wasn't expecting
[48:01] that's gonna deal with his fears forever
[48:03] hallelujah and he tells moses he's like
[48:05] look here do what we gonna do holy let
[48:08] aaron be your prophet and you be god
[48:14] when was the last time you see god
[48:16] afraid
[48:21] that's what he does church hallelujah
[48:23] god will come and elevate our thinking
[48:25] holy to cast down our fears
[48:28] [Music]
[48:30] and that's what he does to moses and
[48:32] moses the prophet of god say hallelujah
[48:34] he goes back as a one-man army
[48:38] all before that he was running
[48:42] running for his life running fear even
[48:45] though he wasn't the liver of he was
[48:46] running the element of fear
[48:49] but once he tapped into that pill of
[48:51] fire once he tapped into the voice of
[48:53] god and god showed him who he was fear
[48:56] was cast down
[48:58] and a man went down there with a dry
[49:00] stick yes
[49:11] my god is greater my god is stronger
[49:16] god you are higher than any other moses
[49:20] went back down there like that
[49:23] why because god dealt with his fears
[49:25] what did god do god gave him a sign
[49:27] hallelujah god said drop that stick turn
[49:29] into a serpent put your hand on your
[49:31] bosom hallelujah turn the lipstick take
[49:33] it out put it back in his heel what was
[49:35] he doing getting rid of his fears
[49:37] so moses comes back down there under the
[49:39] anointing of faith holly why because god
[49:42] cast his fears down steps into pharaoh's
[49:44] kingdom and says hey let my people go
[49:50] why these ain't my people because god
[49:52] told him you be god
[49:54] aaron's your prophet you be god
[49:57] let my people go
[49:59] whoa church it's time for us hollywood
[50:02] to claim our inheritance and stop living
[50:05] under fear
[50:08] oh my
[50:10] hold my church but you look from that
[50:13] point there was an element of fear in
[50:14] there
[50:15] if we back it all the way up if we go
[50:17] back to abraham huddly
[50:20] god told him he said abraham
[50:22] you and sarah will have a child
[50:24] holy
[50:25] and the first thing they did was got
[50:27] gripped by fear
[50:30] because they started looking at it from
[50:31] the natural
[50:32] i'm old you all
[50:34] sarah even laughs
[50:36] fear make you laugh at the truth
[50:42] last night
[50:44] and he was talking about
[50:47] speaking god's word in the line of duty
[50:50] and he and he began to say that
[50:53] you know when you find yourself
[50:55] identified with bible characters
[50:58] the way god did it in the scripture he
[51:00] has to do it the same way in your life
[51:04] and to be true to be the truth we got a
[51:06] real live witness in here hallelujah you
[51:09] know they was missing their plane
[51:13] y'all know where i'm at
[51:15] they was missing their plane totally and
[51:18] the people say y'all ain't going
[51:20] and you know somebody was gonna get you
[51:21] know somebody's gonna get towed off
[51:25] somebody's gonna get you you must you
[51:27] must be don't know who i am
[51:31] but then in the midst of all that god
[51:33] begin to remind them who they are
[51:36] just take a step back hallelujah
[51:38] remember the woman in memphis tennessee
[51:41] now i remember her because she had a
[51:44] need hallelujah that god dealt with her
[51:47] fears and began to speak faith
[51:48] hallelujah she wasn't worried about her
[51:50] son dying because she went to god in
[51:53] prayer and she began to remind god who
[51:55] she is she said lord eyes just like that
[51:58] shooting might harley
[52:00] jack and errol say lord we just like
[52:02] that woman in memphis tennessee
[52:08] y'all know the story did the plane take
[52:10] out no
[52:13] why because their faith made it back up
[52:16] and come back up to the to the plate
[52:18] holy when you find yourself identified
[52:21] with bible truth it has to operate the
[52:24] same way
[52:29] but this brother said he ran out of gas
[52:30] on the highway something's wrong with
[52:32] his gas meter
[52:34] he ran out of gas on the highway late in
[52:36] the early in the morning just got from
[52:37] work something like two three o'clock in
[52:39] the morning whatever it was
[52:40] pitch black dog
[52:43] he said man
[52:45] he said i'm not getting out here walking
[52:46] to no gas station
[52:48] his dog out here
[52:50] fear
[52:52] he said his dog i ain't ham
[52:54] i ain't doing this
[52:55] he said but then at the moment something
[52:57] started to click
[52:59] and remember when you finally find this
[53:01] in the bible
[53:02] he said he went to his trunk
[53:04] he had no gas in there all he had was
[53:06] water
[53:07] holly
[53:08] but then he began to remember the
[53:09] scripture
[53:11] one day they was at a party
[53:16] jesus is the king of kings
[53:19] messiah is the lord of lords
[53:23] jehovah is the king of kings
[53:28] they just had to wear it and you know
[53:29] what they were doing they were drinking
[53:32] and it got so good they ran out of
[53:34] drinks sarah
[53:36] and they said they ran to jesus they
[53:37] said lord lord we need some more drink
[53:39] we got in this drink all they had was
[53:41] water
[53:42] whoa hallelujah all they had was water
[53:45] you know what jesus did he turned that
[53:47] water into wine and when that brother
[53:50] looked in his truck all he had was water
[53:53] he said lord you turn water in the wine
[53:56] i need you to turn this water in the gas
[54:02] hallelujah
[54:04] church that he was he was crazy enough
[54:06] to believe god he was crazy enough to
[54:09] believe the word and he took that wall
[54:12] pulled into this gas tank and drove all
[54:14] the way home
[54:15] [Applause]
[54:18] why because he cast down his fears
[54:22] and believe god i wish somebody would
[54:24] believe god tonight
[54:33] church these ain't just bible stories
[54:36] it's a lifestyle
[54:41] you know how you keep the weight off it
[54:42] has to become a lifestyle
[54:44] hallelujah and the same thing with the
[54:46] word of god the word of god has to
[54:49] become a lifestyle
[54:50] because in those moments when you're in
[54:52] the line of duty and you're in need
[54:54] hallelujah god will allow you to tap in
[54:56] over your fears
[54:58] and remember abraham hallelujah who was
[55:00] the father of faith
[55:03] yeah
[55:04] he was the father of faith when god
[55:06] called him god told him i'm gonna bless
[55:09] you your seed and y'all gonna possess
[55:11] the land and everything and right out of
[55:13] there abraham gets up and gets afraid
[55:16] all right
[55:16] get out of that looking at his wife
[55:19] saying man you're looking good and his
[55:21] fear instead of his faith saw the
[55:24] outcome in his mind
[55:29] now keep in mind that didn't change the
[55:31] promise gave to
[55:32] him see he still was the father of faith
[55:36] but he had to overcome his fears
[55:39] holy where does your fear come from your
[55:42] own imagination
[55:48] fear is false
[55:50] oh yeah
[55:51] fear ain't even true
[55:56] fear i'm gonna blow your socks off now
[55:59] fear
[56:00] ain't even real
[56:04] you say brothers i'm afraid of a dog
[56:06] that's your imagination
[56:08] because you realize who you are god gave
[56:10] you authority over a dog
[56:15] hallelujah
[56:16] why does a dog attack you because he can
[56:19] sense your
[56:20] fear
[56:24] hallelujah they got clips on youtube
[56:25] with me and walking up to a lion pack
[56:29] take they fool
[56:30] and walk away
[56:33] you know the lights look at them and run
[56:38] those men realize who they are
[56:40] hallelujah we got we got we got stories
[56:43] and clips of brother branham going into
[56:45] the woods getting a wolf
[56:49] putting a rope on them
[56:50] and bringing them back in town
[56:54] hallelujah
[56:55] hallelujah when you realize who you are
[56:59] hallelujah and cast down your fears you
[57:02] will do and operate in the way god
[57:05] created you
[57:06] hallelujah but church what is it it's
[57:09] it's fear overcomes us
[57:11] even though there's a genuine seed of
[57:13] faith inside of you
[57:16] see abraham he didn't have a false seed
[57:19] of faith he was the father of faith
[57:21] but in his journey there were fears he
[57:24] had to overcome so he gets there he
[57:27] looks at his wife and now his
[57:28] imagination starts to run sister tina
[57:30] all right now girl you're looking good
[57:32] the king will want you if he find out
[57:34] you my my wife he gonna kill me
[57:40] he's already creating his own outcome
[57:45] and how many of y'all didn't done this
[57:47] if i don't pay this bill they're gonna
[57:48] cut this if i don't pay this they gonna
[57:51] take this
[57:52] they're gonna do it because you're
[57:54] creating that scenario in your mind
[57:59] harley we know the symmetry for fear
[58:01] false evidence is appearing real
[58:06] hard
[58:08] fear is real no it's not
[58:12] fear is a perversion of faith
[58:16] for to be real it has to be something
[58:19] god created
[58:25] hallelujah
[58:26] and if god didn't create it that means
[58:29] it came from satan therefore it has to
[58:31] be a lie
[58:37] see we know these things
[58:39] but what we have to do we have to keep
[58:42] it in our bundle sack and travel with it
[58:45] but you know church hey you look at
[58:47] abraham he comes to the place and he
[58:49] says hey all right now this is how we're
[58:51] going to play this thing out
[58:53] his fear
[58:54] even made him overlook the body change
[58:57] of sarah
[59:00] he saw the body change
[59:02] but he saw it in a fearful negative
[59:04] light
[59:05] well he should have saw it like girl you
[59:08] ain't oh no you looking good oh my it's
[59:10] time for us to have a child all right
[59:13] but his fears prolong the promise of god
[59:18] my my
[59:19] whole life
[59:20] in church just like he thought
[59:23] just like he created in his mind
[59:26] the king saw
[59:28] the king saw sarah and he said i got to
[59:30] have him why did he say that why did he
[59:33] think like that because abraham already
[59:35] spoke it
[59:38] your fears can create things in your
[59:41] life
[59:43] just like your faith
[59:44] can amen
[59:48] so his fears created a scenario where
[59:51] the king come take his wife to spare his
[59:53] life
[59:54] and just like he thought just like he
[59:56] imagined the king came down there
[59:59] hallelujah say i got to have a say who
[1:00:01] was this he said it's my sister she said
[1:00:03] this is my brother he tucker and went
[1:00:05] back to the house
[1:00:06] but just like he imagined hallelujah it
[1:00:09] happened but one thing he failed to
[1:00:11] realize god will always protect his
[1:00:13] promise
[1:00:17] so even when you're fearing god is there
[1:00:20] to make it turn out like it's supposed
[1:00:22] to hallelujah
[1:00:24] hallelujah and then that particular
[1:00:26] thing in his life is only going to be a
[1:00:28] stepping stone
[1:00:30] so now the king comes to get his wife
[1:00:33] then god steps in hollywood why why does
[1:00:36] god step in because you can't make god
[1:00:38] your fear is not going to make god look
[1:00:39] like a liar
[1:00:40] hallelujah
[1:00:42] so god has to step in give the king a
[1:00:44] dream and tell him to say hey you don't
[1:00:46] give a back you're as good as a dead man
[1:00:48] and god ain't playing around with his
[1:00:50] word
[1:00:50] holy he said you're dead man if you give
[1:00:53] back what did he do he talked to man who
[1:00:55] wasn't afraid and made him afraid
[1:00:59] he put the fear in the right place
[1:01:08] the fear is not supposed to be in the
[1:01:10] believer's life it's supposed to be
[1:01:12] hallelujah
[1:01:14] in the unbeliever's life
[1:01:15] [Music]
[1:01:18] hallelujah so god comes and he puts the
[1:01:20] fear in the right place and the man that
[1:01:22] god you know my integrity and all these
[1:01:24] things and blah blah blah god said give
[1:01:26] him back are you dead
[1:01:29] and then he didn't stop what he did he
[1:01:31] magnified abraham's thinking again
[1:01:35] even though
[1:01:37] he was lying because he was afraid
[1:01:40] god didn't give none of that no strength
[1:01:44] god ain't even addressed that
[1:01:49] because god know that wasn't a part of
[1:01:51] his promise
[1:01:52] that that wasn't a part of abraham
[1:01:55] the reason why that happened was because
[1:01:57] of his fears and fear is something false
[1:02:00] hallelujah so god's looking at that he's
[1:02:03] saying that ain't abraham
[1:02:05] that ain't who he is i know him amen
[1:02:08] i know him i know who he is
[1:02:10] he's the father of faith hallelujah
[1:02:12] everything's gonna come out of him he
[1:02:14] got an isaac he got a jacob a joseph
[1:02:16] hallelujah he got a lineage coming out
[1:02:19] of him i ain't worried about that little
[1:02:21] false little thing right there he tells
[1:02:23] the kids hey give it back and go let him
[1:02:26] pray for you
[1:02:30] let him pray for you cause that's my
[1:02:32] prophet
[1:02:33] [Music]
[1:02:36] in the very moment of 211 change the
[1:02:39] testimony from a liar to a prophet
[1:02:44] don't worry about what the devil's
[1:02:46] saying is god is the one speaking over
[1:02:49] you
[1:02:53] hallelujah
[1:02:55] church and from there
[1:02:58] from there
[1:02:59] abraham listen to good now from that
[1:03:02] point
[1:03:03] abraham never feared another man
[1:03:09] are you in the book
[1:03:13] every other time from there it didn't
[1:03:16] matter who was on abraham's side he said
[1:03:18] y'all wanna fight let's go
[1:03:22] we ain't cr we ain't creating no
[1:03:24] scenarios we ain't making they didn't
[1:03:26] talk a lot who with me y'all with me
[1:03:28] let's go
[1:03:30] king said well i give this you ain't
[1:03:32] giving me nothing cause you will say
[1:03:33] that you gave me something god is my
[1:03:35] exceedingly reward
[1:03:38] church from that point
[1:03:40] abraham never feared again
[1:03:43] why because god conquered his fears in
[1:03:45] that moment
[1:03:49] and that's all he'd be trying to do for
[1:03:50] us
[1:03:51] he puts us in certain positions where
[1:03:53] things happen that you can't explain
[1:03:55] hello
[1:03:56] you don't know why it's happening
[1:03:58] hallelujah he's trying to deal with your
[1:04:00] fears
[1:04:01] hey man hey let me let me show you
[1:04:03] another we all right
[1:04:04] let me let me show you another church
[1:04:06] listen holly the reason why i read the
[1:04:08] book of job job said job said for the
[1:04:11] thing which i greatly feared is come
[1:04:13] upon me and that which which i was
[1:04:16] afraid of is come unto me
[1:04:19] so the very thing he was afraid of was
[1:04:22] come upon him and then church he's
[1:04:24] standing there watching it all play out
[1:04:29] oh my i want to read you some of the
[1:04:30] prophets saying about job harley
[1:04:33] if i can find it he says look in the
[1:04:36] book of job this is in the message um
[1:04:38] uh perfect faith
[1:04:40] he says in the book of job
[1:04:43] it says here job feared and what he
[1:04:46] feared it actually happened
[1:04:48] what brought it now he said what brought
[1:04:50] his fear he said what brought it his
[1:04:52] fear
[1:04:53] that's what made it happen
[1:04:55] his faith would have kept it from him
[1:04:59] holy he said but his fear
[1:05:02] brought it to him
[1:05:04] he was scared he was scared it was going
[1:05:07] to happen and it did happen
[1:05:10] now
[1:05:11] if it'd been he knowed it would happen
[1:05:13] it wouldn't have happened see
[1:05:15] see what i mean he said if you're afraid
[1:05:18] when you come by the prayer line maybe i
[1:05:20] just haven't got the faith sufficient
[1:05:23] it'll never happen don't worry see but
[1:05:26] if you know it's going to happen it'll
[1:05:28] happen
[1:05:32] y'all know what y'all need to start
[1:05:33] doing
[1:05:35] y'all make sure that the furniture stuff
[1:05:37] y'all took out the old church i'll keep
[1:05:39] it clean
[1:05:42] [Applause]
[1:05:43] somebody need to go by there and make
[1:05:45] sure it ain't dustin
[1:05:47] if it's in the storage room make sure
[1:05:48] it's ready to be satin
[1:05:50] [Applause]
[1:05:50] [Music]
[1:05:54] because when god do something it's just
[1:05:55] like you ain't missed a beat
[1:05:59] [Applause]
[1:06:01] and what you might need to do you might
[1:06:02] need to go buy a little bit more chairs
[1:06:07] [Applause]
[1:06:09] cause he's the god of plenty
[1:06:12] not a god of less
[1:06:14] but church he said it was joe's fear
[1:06:16] that brought it holy he said see
[1:06:19] it's a substance of something job had a
[1:06:22] fear that these things will come upon
[1:06:25] him and they did if you have a fear that
[1:06:29] your disease is going to leave you that
[1:06:32] your disease is going to leave you or
[1:06:33] won't leave you it won't if you have a
[1:06:36] faith that it will
[1:06:39] see so even on your journey right now
[1:06:41] there's only two things you're carrying
[1:06:43] with you
[1:06:45] is either faith
[1:06:46] or fear
[1:06:50] but i'm going to make the devil mad
[1:06:52] though
[1:06:55] but my fear
[1:06:57] is working for my faith
[1:07:05] because when satan jump on us
[1:07:07] to make us fear
[1:07:08] god jumps on him to show us it's a lie
[1:07:14] if you got something in your life that
[1:07:16] you're fearing your fear is working for
[1:07:18] your faith hell yeah
[1:07:20] because god has to prove himself right
[1:07:22] to be all the time
[1:07:24] so what he does he always shows up the
[1:07:27] devil's lie to show his truth
[1:07:30] holy
[1:07:31] so whenever the devil shows his fear god
[1:07:33] shows his faith
[1:07:36] oh yeah
[1:07:37] because church hallelujah in the mind
[1:07:40] and the mystery of god satan thought he
[1:07:42] was doing something hardly so because he
[1:07:44] thought he was doing something by
[1:07:46] allowing fear to come into man's
[1:07:48] creation no fear was working for faith
[1:07:51] hallelujah because fear came in so the
[1:07:54] plan of redemption can usher in
[1:08:00] so god let the devil loose hallelujah
[1:08:03] just to let himself loose
[1:08:08] so he let hallelujah fear the attributes
[1:08:11] of fear come like sickness and sadness
[1:08:13] and bondage and all these things so god
[1:08:16] can come in with the opposite hallelujah
[1:08:18] healing deliverance and saving power
[1:08:20] holly so fear was working for faith
[1:08:24] hallelujah
[1:08:28] oh my
[1:08:29] god
[1:08:31] look at the church hallelujah
[1:08:34] amen there had to be a goliath why
[1:08:36] because there was a david
[1:08:39] [Music]
[1:08:41] goliath who would have never come on the
[1:08:44] scene if there was no david
[1:08:46] hello
[1:08:48] so god allowed there to be a david
[1:08:50] hallelujah amen to show a goliath
[1:08:53] hallelujah that he could be defeated
[1:08:57] and look how he does the church amen
[1:08:59] look at god oh my i feel the holy ghost
[1:09:01] movement
[1:09:02] look at god church what he normally does
[1:09:05] he lets your fears come out first
[1:09:11] he let the fears come out first
[1:09:13] conquer your fears and then move into a
[1:09:15] higher level in god
[1:09:18] that's what he did at church he let
[1:09:20] goliath come out boast post scream and
[1:09:22] holla did he get smart and say nobody's
[1:09:25] look ain't nobody got to die
[1:09:28] we ain't got to do that look ain't
[1:09:29] nobody got to die you say i know all
[1:09:31] y'all afraid of me
[1:09:33] ain't nobody got to die you know you
[1:09:34] just bring out your champion this and
[1:09:36] that blah blah blah he's talking cause
[1:09:37] he know everybody afraid of him but
[1:09:39] there was one person was going to hear
[1:09:40] him
[1:09:43] who had no fear
[1:09:48] wow church that's what you got to
[1:09:50] realize when you look at the life of
[1:09:52] david david ain't had no fear
[1:09:57] david he wasn't afraid of saul
[1:10:01] he was just honoring his position
[1:10:04] david had at least three times he could
[1:10:06] have killed him
[1:10:07] but he didn't he was just honoring david
[1:10:09] was like man i ain't afraid of you
[1:10:11] i can kill you at any time
[1:10:14] he hit
[1:10:23] army and absalom come trying to take the
[1:10:25] kingdom and different stuff and he
[1:10:27] started plotting he said hey that's what
[1:10:28] we're gonna do we're gonna ambush your
[1:10:30] daddy and this and that and blah blah
[1:10:31] blah and they gonna judge like
[1:10:35] you
[1:10:36] you know who you talking about
[1:10:39] we talking about david
[1:10:41] he said no i'm good
[1:10:44] y'all go ahead i'm good
[1:10:48] oh good
[1:10:49] and this is what i like to say church
[1:10:51] when david killed goliath he didn't just
[1:10:53] kill him
[1:10:55] he made a show out of it
[1:11:00] he killed goliath and tuck his head
[1:11:09] can y'all imagine david going to the
[1:11:11] next battle
[1:11:12] hollywood and now he's using the fear as
[1:11:14] faith hallelujah goliath made everybody
[1:11:17] afraid now he's going to take the same
[1:11:19] thing hollywood and scare off the enemy
[1:11:21] holly
[1:11:22] through faith amen before he gets to the
[1:11:24] battle he probably came i just hey y'all

[1:12:52] god is looking at him
[1:12:55] god told satan before they even go
[1:12:57] through any battle any tests he's
[1:13:00] perfect and there's nothing like him in
[1:13:02] all the earth
[1:13:04] that's god's testimony about job but job

[1:15:26] doing as believers
[1:15:28] life is supposed to be live holiday in
[1:15:31] the faith of god

[1:15:40] right now don't forget where we at we're
[1:15:43] in the last days
[1:15:45] and the scripture says hallelujah let's
[1:15:47] read it luke 21
[1:15:51] i think i want to read verse 25.
[1:15:56] listen luke 21 to 25 it says and there
[1:15:58] shall be signs in the sun and in the
[1:16:01] moon and in the stars and upon the earth
[1:16:03] distress of nations are we there
[1:16:07] with perplexity
[1:16:10] the sea
[1:16:11] and the waves roaring means hearts
[1:16:15] failing them for
[1:16:17] fear
[1:16:18] and for looking at those things which
[1:16:21] are coming on the earth
[1:16:23] see they're afraid
[1:16:26] because of what they see happening next
[1:16:30] but the scriptures tell us that these
[1:16:32] things are supposed to happen but as its
[1:16:35] happenings
[1:16:36] men's hearts are getting perplexed
[1:16:40] they're getting they're getting afraid
[1:16:42] the scripture says
[1:16:44] it says
[1:16:45] the earth distress of nations with
[1:16:48] perplexity now i look at that word
[1:16:50] perplexity
[1:16:51] perplexity means to be without
[1:16:55] resources
[1:16:57] now i want you to understand
[1:16:59] i'ma take this word perplexity

[1:17:27] right
[1:17:30] oh my is that to be in straights

[1:18:42] coronavirus see church don't be mistaken
[1:18:46] corona what is all about is producing
[1:18:50] fear
[1:18:53] because they know once they get
[1:18:54] everybody in fear they can control the
[1:18:56] whole world
[1:19:01] and i remember one of the first clips i
[1:19:02] seen on the news or youtube or whatever
[1:19:04] it was wherever it was over there in
[1:19:07] thailand or china whatever everybody had
[1:19:09] on white suits
[1:19:11] their white suits and masks and spray

[1:19:19] it's all over
[1:19:21] it's in the place

[1:19:26] and then they come out the the first way
[1:19:28] they come out with and i ain't gonna hit
[1:19:29] this too long but the first way they
[1:19:31] come out of it somebody the man was
[1:19:32] eating some bad soup
[1:19:44] come on
[1:19:55] we black people
[1:20:00] if that's how you get corona we good
[1:20:06] we good

[1:20:12] eating no bad soup
[1:20:14] i don't care who say it's good
[1:20:20] bad suit
[1:20:21] foolishness
[1:20:24] and you know they had people believe in
[1:20:25] that mess
[1:20:27] what was it fear
[1:20:29] the imagination of what cnn and all
[1:20:31] these people were pushing
[1:20:36] i didn't go too much in this because
[1:20:38] we're going to dive in a little bit more
[1:20:39] tomorrow
[1:20:40] what church do you think about it harley
[1:20:44] the elephant the
[1:20:46] the the element of fear that they're
[1:20:48] using with this colonovirus
[1:20:51] you know one of the silliest ones to me
[1:20:53] is
[1:20:54] the six-feet
[1:20:59] yeah that's rule that's stupid it's just
[1:21:01] don't it's dumb
[1:21:02] it don't i'm gonna show you how silly it

[1:21:21] a little bit less a little bit more
[1:21:24] about six feet
[1:21:26] okay they say we need to be six feet
[1:21:27] apart make sure you don't get it right

[1:22:02] 16 and on and on and on if they saying
[1:22:06] it's in the air
[1:22:09] you know what make you get it
[1:22:11] the imagination of fear in your mind
[1:22:16] now don't get me wrong
[1:22:18] i ain't saying people ain't had it
[1:22:21] but what did you do when you got it
[1:22:26] i give you a little bit more
[1:22:29] you just take the traits of it
[1:22:32] now you know people been getting the
[1:22:35] uh uh just by a short hand whoever had
[1:22:37] the flu
[1:22:40] pretty much everybody
[1:22:42] most of us had a cold
[1:22:48] thank you same thing
[1:22:50] okay well let me ask you
[1:22:53] with your cold
[1:22:54] you ever had chills
[1:22:57] you know one of the symptoms of the
[1:22:58] viruses
[1:23:00] chill
[1:23:03] been here
[1:23:04] forever church
[1:23:07] every year
[1:23:08] 80 to 100 000 people
[1:23:11] get chills
[1:23:13] before there was any vaccination
[1:23:17] you know what
[1:23:18] you ever had a fever
[1:23:20] anybody ever had a fever
[1:23:22] hand chills
[1:23:24] you know what
[1:23:25] corona got those same symptoms
[1:23:29] then let me ask some
[1:23:31] did you overcome it
[1:23:33] did you get a shot
[1:23:35] was it a mass to help you overcome it
[1:23:40] you overcame it
[1:23:42] how
[1:23:42] you fought through it
[1:23:45] right and you know if you have a cold or
[1:23:48] a flu or whatever it is too long you
[1:23:50] know what to happen you get pneumonia
[1:23:53] and what does that do it produces fluid
[1:23:56] in your lungs
[1:23:59] corona
[1:24:00] do the same thing though
[1:24:06] this ain't that new that's right
[1:24:08] it's been here
[1:24:11] it's been here
[1:24:12] oh i ain't named no new
[1:24:14] symptoms ain't ain't nothing new
[1:24:17] it's all been here ever had a runny nose
[1:24:21] it's been here
[1:24:23] ever burnt your tongue lost your taste
[1:24:26] it's been here
[1:24:31] you got it back though didn't you
[1:24:34] he's been here
[1:24:37] so church what's making this corolla
[1:24:38] thing so strong
[1:24:41] fear
[1:24:42] the imagination of what they're pumping
[1:24:44] in the minds of the people
[1:24:49] and he's over things but i got family
[1:24:52] members who got who who passed on from
[1:24:54] it let me put that in the right
[1:24:56] perspective
[1:24:57] it was their time
[1:25:02] i'm not being insensitive
[1:25:04] it was their time
[1:25:06] he said the devil took their life no
[1:25:10] the devil's not the death angel
[1:25:13] god is
[1:25:15] he said when i see the blood i'll pass
[1:25:18] over now when the devil see the blood he
[1:25:20] gonna pass over he said when i see the
[1:25:22] blood harder so who's bringing judgment
[1:25:24] on those houses that didn't have the
[1:25:26] blood god
[1:25:28] so god was controlling death
[1:25:34] whoa
[1:25:35] that's why he went down he said
[1:25:37] hallelujah he got the keys to what death
[1:25:40] hell
[1:25:41] and the grain
[1:25:44] so what am i saying in night church you
[1:25:46] are not the fear
[1:25:48] holy cast down your fear
[1:25:51] and let your fear work for your
[1:25:53] amen
[1:25:56] [Applause]
[1:26:00] church
[1:26:01] and my last one i want to say says to be
[1:26:03] in doubt perplexity now to be in doubt
[1:26:06] not to know which way to turn
[1:26:11] that's where the world is
[1:26:13] they don't know what's next they don't
[1:26:14] know what's going to happen
[1:26:16] holly why because they're operating on
[1:26:18] the fear
[1:26:19] but church in my closing right here look
[1:26:22] the prophet of god said
[1:26:24] everything adam lost was restored in who
[1:26:28] christ
[1:26:30] so when jesus christ holly died on the
[1:26:33] cross hallelujah he put all of us back
[1:26:35] in our position before the fall
[1:26:38] earlier so we have the power to operate
[1:26:42] as adam did without any fear hallelujah
[1:26:44] he said tree get up and got up
[1:26:46] hallelujah he said this happened that
[1:26:48] happened it happened water flowed his
[1:26:50] way it flowed hallelujah why because
[1:26:52] there was no fear in adam holland he was
[1:26:55] created an image and likeness of god
[1:27:01] and so are we amen
[1:27:03] by god's grace
[1:27:05] church
[1:27:06] cast down fear
[1:27:08] and every thought of your imagination
[1:27:10] that exalts itself above the knowledge
[1:27:12] of god
[1:27:13] see when you confess the lord jesus
[1:27:15] christ as your savior it ain't up to you
[1:27:17] to remain safe
[1:27:24] you confess him as your savior
[1:27:27] so it's up to him to save you from
[1:27:30] yourself
[1:27:32] it's up to him to save you from your
[1:27:34] fears harley
[1:27:36] and look god allowed all of his
[1:27:38] believers all the different ones to go
[1:27:41] through situations where they would be
[1:27:43] afraid just to conquer it so they won't
[1:27:45] have to deal with it anymore
[1:27:48] you go all the way back from abraham to
[1:27:50] moses to jacob to joseph all of it
[1:27:53] hardly and look how god dealt with their
[1:27:55] fears hollywood to put them in a place
[1:27:58] where they never have to go through that
[1:27:59] same thing twice
[1:28:01] it might move down through the
[1:28:02] generations
[1:28:04] but that same power to conquer move down
[1:28:06] through the generation
[1:28:07] because you know isaac feared what
[1:28:09] abraham feared holly and god dealt with
[1:28:11] his fears just like he did with his
[1:28:13] father's fears
[1:28:14] holly so you can't see that it's my
[1:28:16] daddy's fault
[1:28:19] it's my mama fire it because my home
[1:28:21] broken and all that stuff no
[1:28:27] give it to god come on musicians i'm
[1:28:29] closing
[1:28:31] give it to the lord let the lord
[1:28:34] deal with your fears
[1:28:35] scripture says perfect love
[1:28:38] cast out all fear
[1:28:40] so fall in love with god in a deeper way
[1:28:43] hell yeah and he'll give you the
[1:28:45] strength to overcome hallelujah
[1:28:48] to overcome all these things hardly that
[1:28:50] we are so afraid of
[1:28:53] because in my in my opening text
[1:28:55] hallelujah am i opening scripture
[1:28:57] look they confess
[1:28:59] that everything god said was in the land
[1:29:02] it's there
[1:29:03] everything is there and we got the fruit
[1:29:06] of it the sad part about the church
[1:29:08] they were eating the greeks
[1:29:12] they were eating the grapes and the
[1:29:14] bible says taste and seed of the lord is
[1:29:15] gracious
[1:29:17] they was tasting they were seeing
[1:29:18] hallelujah and they let that fear come
[1:29:21] into camp and say we can't we can't do
[1:29:22] it we can't do it i don't know about
[1:29:24] them but i said well i want some more of
[1:29:26] them grapes
[1:29:28] you ever been in the grocery store and
[1:29:30] you didn't taste the grapes
[1:29:37] you know how we do our tea
[1:29:43] you don't just buy now
[1:29:46] you want to see your day sweet
[1:29:48] hey take that great
[1:29:53] i need another one
[1:29:57] he's like yeah yeah yeah i'm about to do
[1:29:59] eight by five of them yeah you gonna buy
[1:30:02] you're gonna buy them
[1:30:05] but you're looking for a certain quality
[1:30:06] hallelujah
[1:30:08] and that's what god does he allows us to
[1:30:09] taste it hallelujah so we can see the
[1:30:12] quality of it holly and once you taste
[1:30:14] the quality of it the only thing that's
[1:30:16] going to stop you is fear
[1:30:18] the prophet god said the only thing
[1:30:19] stopping from getting the holy ghost he
[1:30:21] was 12 years old was a spirit
[1:30:23] fear
[1:30:25] hallelujah
[1:30:26] church
[1:30:27] we are greater than that
[1:30:30] hallelujah he's not giving us the spirit
[1:30:32] of fear but of love
[1:30:34] power
[1:30:36] and a sound mind
[1:30:37] and even right now
[1:30:40] in this service
[1:30:42] we all may have some things that we're
[1:30:43] dealing with
[1:30:45] you know they're they're they're there
[1:30:46] and i'm closing they're there there
[1:30:48] there's a word
[1:30:50] that we've been using and it has gotten
[1:30:53] so common we don't even realize we're
[1:30:55] speaking of spirit in our life
[1:30:58] you know you hear people say all the
[1:30:59] time oh
[1:31:00] my anxiety
[1:31:04] my anxiety you know that is
[1:31:06] your fear
[1:31:07] you're confessing fear over your life
[1:31:10] i've heard preachers say that
[1:31:12] my anxiety
[1:31:15] what you're doing you're confessing fear
[1:31:17] over your life to have dominion in those
[1:31:20] moments
[1:31:21] hell yeah
[1:31:22] fear the prophet of god say fear is a
[1:31:25] demon
[1:31:28] because fear leads to what torment
[1:31:31] when satan gets full control of it it
[1:31:33] becomes torment it becomes something you
[1:31:35] can't conquer
[1:31:37] hey man i'm trying to close but y'all
[1:31:38] pulling real good
[1:31:40] we just not hitting 9
[1:31:42] o'clock i'm gonna tell you a story of
[1:31:45] fear a friend of mine
[1:31:47] she's like a social worker
[1:31:50] she she got a fear of dogs
[1:31:53] cause one day
[1:31:54] she went to the mailbox
[1:31:56] i thought she got bit by the dog
[1:31:59] she went to the mailbox and a dog was on
[1:32:01] the hill
[1:32:03] seen on the hill
[1:32:09] got deeper deeper louder louder he's
[1:32:11] still on the hill though
[1:32:15] in her mind he gonna chase me
[1:32:18] he gonna bite me
[1:32:20] let me get in this house
[1:32:22] and from that moment it created
[1:32:25] something in her life
[1:32:26] that she's never shaken
[1:32:29] and to this day
[1:32:31] every time she goes to the mailbox
[1:32:39] and you know what's crazy
[1:32:41] her neighbors ain't even got no dog
[1:32:48] but fear will create scenarios
[1:32:51] that's not even there
[1:32:54] and this and then and check this out
[1:32:57] the kind of work she does
[1:33:01] she's like a social worker
[1:33:04] where she relates with people's fears
[1:33:07] why because she has them
[1:33:11] it's almost like a hypocrite
[1:33:14] because like how you gonna help me
[1:33:17] when you got the same problem
[1:33:23] so we were talking one day and i said
[1:33:25] you mean to tell me you ain't never even
[1:33:26] been bit by a dog she said no
[1:33:29] but can you imagine a dog on the top of
[1:33:31] the hill and he's barking and and
[1:33:34] growling and all this stuff and i'm
[1:33:35] thinking yeah they used to happen all
[1:33:37] the time in my neighborhood
[1:33:40] we would ride by they chase you on the
[1:33:42] bike
[1:33:45] but it never did anything to me where it
[1:33:48] would me
[1:33:49] and that's what fear does it'll
[1:33:51] your walk
[1:33:52] it'll your life and now and now
[1:33:55] she's plus you know
[1:33:57] a grown woman
[1:33:59] real grown
[1:34:02] i won't say i ain't i ain't gonna call
[1:34:04] her old she might see the tape or
[1:34:05] something
[1:34:06] but
[1:34:07] she's real grown
[1:34:10] still got the same fears
[1:34:13] church
[1:34:14] y'all play something soft i'm closing
[1:34:16] look you can have things that happen in
[1:34:19] your childhood
[1:34:21] something that happened to you when you
[1:34:22] use a young girl a young teenager
[1:34:25] and it produced a fear in your life
[1:34:28] and you carry that thing
[1:34:30] carried and carried you know what you
[1:34:33] carry that in your marriage
[1:34:36] you raise your children with that same
[1:34:38] fear
[1:34:39] all right don't you be careful when you
[1:34:41] go to the mailbox
[1:34:44] because it's something you never dealt
[1:34:45] with
[1:34:48] because of different issues people are
[1:34:50] afraid you know uh you you take a man
[1:34:52] who may have a fear he's been done wrong
[1:34:54] and he'll carry that very thing into his
[1:34:57] life
[1:34:58] carry that into his marriage he'll never
[1:35:00] be that that man who's loving and
[1:35:03] comfort because he always got to keep
[1:35:04] his guard up because of that fear
[1:35:08] church don't let fear
[1:35:11] dictate your steps
[1:35:14] but let your fears work for your faith

[1:42:07] thank you jesus
[1:42:11] you know um i've heard the
[1:42:14] sermons on fear uh many times and
[1:42:18] um
[1:42:19] but there was a lot that just kind of
[1:42:21] came out here tonight that just really
[1:42:23] just
[1:42:24] just blessed me you know just never
[1:42:27] really looked at uh what happened in the
[1:42:29] garden of eden and
[1:42:31] and how um
[1:42:33] it's when they began to you know
[1:42:35] it was when when she was being deceived
[1:42:37] she didn't she was not afraid of nothing
[1:42:40] right but when uh when they knew god was
[1:42:42] coming down to visit him just kind of
[1:42:44] change their perceptions change about
[1:42:46] god and and that fear you know that they
[1:42:49] begin to live on this just something
[1:42:51] that's just hell mankind even to this
[1:42:53] day
[1:42:54] we have problems with and i love the
[1:42:55] statement that brother diggs made that
[1:42:58] um
[1:42:59] in order for
[1:43:01] fear to be real
[1:43:03] it has to be something that god created
[1:43:07] so we know it's not real it's something
[1:43:09] that satan uses against the people right
[1:43:12] and uh and we never want to find
[1:43:14] ourselves walking underneath that
[1:43:16] i mentioned this some time ago it's uh
[1:43:19] it's a very fine line when we cross the
[1:43:21] line of faith and start walking in fear
[1:43:24] we want to be very very careful of that
[1:43:26] very very careful that but i just thank
[1:43:29] god for the word tonight and just
[1:43:31] appreciate it just a real blessing amen
[1:43:34] to our souls cast down fear
[1:43:37] cast down
[1:43:39] fear
[1:43:40] blessed be the name of the lord god
[1:43:42] bless you brother diggs amen thank you
[1:43:43] so much for
[1:43:45] yielding to the lord
[1:43:50] thank you for yielding to the lord
[1:43:52] i mean i also just want to say so good
[1:43:54] to have our precious brothers and
[1:43:55] sisters amen with us tonight
[1:43:58] good to have you all amen and trust that
[1:44:00] you'll come and be with us again
[1:44:03] amen
[1:44:04] god is good god is god is good
[1:44:08] uh that testimony the the brother just
[1:44:11] pouring water
[1:44:12] amen in his car and you know what what
[1:44:14] i'm gonna tell you what fear will do
[1:44:17] uh after something like that happens
[1:44:20] fear say you put water in your
[1:44:23] you're gonna mess up your engine
[1:44:26] right but he didn't put water in his car
[1:44:29] he asked god to turn the water to gas
[1:44:33] so what you have to do is speak back to
[1:44:35] i know i didn't put water in my car
[1:44:37] tell me satan did they drink water did
[1:44:39] they drink wine
[1:44:41] he put himself in scripture
[1:44:43] right so if they drunk wine because
[1:44:45] that's what the bible say i didn't put
[1:44:47] water in my car i put gas in my
[1:44:50] and all he did was turn the water into
[1:44:52] gas
[1:44:54] hallelujah
[1:44:55] you got to cast down you got to cast
[1:44:58] down fear anytime the devil comes with
[1:45:00] anything

[1:45:22] certainly appreciative
[1:45:25] of the word that we've heard here

[1:45:32] cast down fear not to think lord evil
[1:45:35] thoughts and
[1:45:36] wicked thoughts fear does not come from
[1:45:38] you you did not make it and and as the
[1:45:41] bible clearly states fear is a spirit
[1:45:46] lord it's a spirit and and the bible
[1:45:49] says you have not given us the spirit of
[1:45:52] fear
[1:45:53] but of love
[1:45:56] power

[1:46:20] so we can trust you god even in the
[1:46:22] midst of all it is help us father not to
