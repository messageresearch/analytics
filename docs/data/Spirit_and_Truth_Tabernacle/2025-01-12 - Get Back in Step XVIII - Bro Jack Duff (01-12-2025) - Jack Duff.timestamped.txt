[40:57] a dear relative of mine this week and
[41:01] he's instrumental to my even um being
[41:06] here in the pull pit just an experience
[41:08] that I had at his house and uh some
[41:12] years ago before I accepted my call to

[41:24] school he was Ren in the school and and
[41:26] he would uh um set the school up and
[41:29] sometimes when he set up it' just be him
[41:31] and his wife there uh and he would
[41:33] preach like the house was
[41:35] full and uh you know he was just telling
[41:37] me about his journey and things like
[41:39] that just really really brought a lot of
[41:40] encouragement to me but he uh he was
[41:42] telling me says uh Jack i' be i' be
[41:45] listening to the sermon uh cuz I can't
[41:48] go out to service he's going through

[42:01] I'm looking I'm listening and I'm
[42:05] learning
[42:06] hallu praise the Lord and I say well my
[42:10] God and I realize how uh important what
[42:13] we're doing uh to is to so many it's not
[42:17] just us that come here but there are
[42:19] people that are watching online that
[42:21] that need uh you know what what what
[42:23] what what is happening here and for one
[42:26] area that the devil to fight in is in
[42:28] the technology and we just got to bind
[42:31] that devil in the name of Jesus and just
[42:34] pray that God would give us wisdom on
[42:36] how to navigate uh the technology to
[42:39] make sure we have the right Tools in
[42:41] place to ensure a uh um you know just a
[42:47] smooth smooth uh experience amen because
[42:51] people people need it people people need
[42:54] it amen praise God so let's read this
[42:57] this uh we read this last week in
[42:59] closing and uh we we'll just pick it up
[43:02] here but you know our theme is get back
[43:05] in step and uh this is one of the verses
[43:07] that help us get back in Step it's right
[43:10] here you know in the Bible but verse one
[43:12] says and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[43:14] down from heaven clothed with a cloud my
[43:18] God my God my God and a rainbow was upon
[43:22] his head and his face was as it were the
[43:24] Sun and his feet as pillows of fire this
[43:26] is n none other than the Lord Jesus
[43:28] Christ himself in this scripture amen
[43:32] and he had in his hand a little book
[43:34] open and he set his right foot upon the
[43:38] sea and his left foot up uh on the earth
[43:41] and cried with a loud voice as when a
[43:43] lion Roth and when he when he had cried
[43:46] seven Thunders uttered their
[43:48] voices and uh when the seven Thunders
[43:50] had uttered their voices I was about to
[43:54] write so now John heard what the Thunder
[43:57] said and John was about to write it amen
[44:01] but he was uh he heard a voice says and
[44:04] I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto
[44:06] me seal up those things which the seven
[44:11] Thunders uttered and write them not so
[44:14] John knew it John heard it John knew it
[44:18] John understood it John was about to
[44:20] write it and he was told don't write it
[44:23] okay and and then verse 5 says and the
[44:26] angel went SAW stand upon the sea and
[44:28] upon the Earth lifted up his hand to
[44:30] heaven and swear by him that liveth
[44:32] forever and ever who created heaven and
[44:36] the things that are that therein are and
[44:38] the earth and the things that therein
[44:40] are and the Sea and the uh uh and the
[44:43] things which are therein that there
[44:45] should be time no longer amen so this is
[44:51] uh this is end time and a lot of time
[44:55] people ask you know I was asking the
[44:57] question what is it that we believe what
[44:59] do you call this and I tell them it's
[45:01] called The End Time message right
[45:03] because this happens at the end time and
[45:08] and I'm here to tell you that like I
[45:09] read to y'all last week uh the mystery
[45:13] is actually history amen this not
[45:16] something that we're looking forward to
[45:19] this scripture has already been
[45:23] fulfilled and it was fulfilled in the
[45:25] ministry of of William Mariam
[45:29] brandom praise God and verse 7 says but
[45:32] in the days of the
[45:35] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[45:38] begin to
[45:40] sound uh he says the mystery of God
[45:42] shall be finish as he have declared to
[45:44] his servants the prophets and i' like to
[45:48] just quickly read amen Revelation 3
[45:52] because we read Revelation 10:7 in the
[45:54] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[45:56] will
[45:58] who um uh I guess uh what seventh angel
[46:02] are is the scripture referring to the
[46:05] answer is found in Revelation 3
[46:10] and4 which simply says amen and unto the
[46:17] angel of the Church of the leod
[46:19] Deans write these things saith the
[46:24] amen yeah that's the the the soul Let It
[46:29] Be Hallelujah the amen the faithful and
[46:34] through witness the beginning of the
[46:38] creation of God there is so much I can
[46:40] just take off right there and because
[46:44] when you know people read these things
[46:46] and they don't see nothing I see
[46:48] everything beginning of the creation of
[46:50] God Amen and and and in in in so so so
[46:54] many ways uh and brother brandom
[46:56] addressed is you know all of this in the
[46:58] church age book uh but but when we when
[47:01] we want to know who Revelation 10:7 is
[47:03] referring to is the same person in
[47:05] Revelation
[47:06] 3:14 amen so if you find out who
[47:08] Revelation 3:14 is then you know who
[47:10] Revelation 10:7 is
[47:13] amen and if you want to know who any of
[47:16] those is go to Revelation 101 he will
[47:19] tell you who these is hallelujah all
[47:21] right let's
[47:22] pray father we thank you oh God for uh
[47:26] the privilege that we have to be able to
[47:28] come and um just enjoy the presence of
[47:32] God uh we have been blessed by the
[47:36] worship service and blessed by the
[47:39] specials that have gone forth and now
[47:41] Lord is the word that must come forth
[47:45] and uh God we
[47:47] we not only take control over every
[47:50] Spirit here in the house of the Lord but
[47:53] we take control father over the atmosph
[47:57] spere that might be trying to hinder the
[47:59] technology and Lord we ask that you
[48:01] would just uh make it Lord where things
[48:04] run smooth and that the people that are
[48:06] on the other end can hear without any
[48:08] distraction as we know the devil is
[48:10] trying to fight those Souls he's trying
[48:13] to fight the truth from coming to the
[48:15] people they get distracted they get
[48:17] upset they get frustrated then they turn
[48:19] to another Channel Lord we we we bind
[48:22] that devil right now in the name of
[48:23] Jesus and Lord let your word go forth un
[48:26] Ender we ask Lord that you take complete
[48:29] control over every thought that will be
[48:31] presented and every thought that would
[48:32] be received God we commit it now into
[48:35] your hands in Jesus name we pray amen
[48:39] amen God bless you you can be seated
[48:41] glory to
[48:42] God um so much Amen in our journey here
[48:48] of get back and step and um I'm I
[48:53] sometimes I have to find where to get in
[48:56] and where to get out uh because I know I
[48:59] can't preach it all in one service I
[49:01] couldn't even preach it all in one year
[49:04] uh so I'm just doing everything I can
[49:07] amen just to continue this journey and
[49:09] here's the other thing that I that I I
[49:12] realized
[49:13] um after having that conversation this
[49:16] this week um where we may take things
[49:19] for granted that you know oh I know that
[49:22] oh I know that I know that there's a lot
[49:24] of people have no idea what we talking
[49:27] about
[49:29] lots lots so we have to take our time
[49:34] you know and make sure that people are
[49:36] getting understanding uh you know of
[49:39] this truth it's it's important the only
[49:42] reason we are still here on this Earth
[49:45] is because we have not found the last
[49:47] seed and the last seed might be coming
[49:49] through the
[49:51] string right we we don't we don't know
[49:54] so so it's it's imperative amen that we
[49:57] we uh we just kind of go through a few
[50:00] things and and I think as we're going
[50:01] through we'll we'll be blessed amen
[50:04] we'll be blessed but I want to start
[50:06] with a a quote amen out of the sermon
[50:08] the super sign I was listening to this
[50:11] uh throughout the week and um you know
[50:13] and it just it just blessed my heart um
[50:16] you know one of the things I shared with
[50:17] the brothers this week was that there
[50:20] was a brother Brandon made a statement
[50:21] in that message that uh we got people
[50:25] that go to church
[50:27] religiously you know week to week basis
[50:30] some are what we call Sunday only
[50:34] Christians
[50:36] amen summer Wednesday night and Sunday
[50:39] morning Christians amen right uh some
[50:44] you know are uh uh what we call CEOs
[50:48] Christmas and Easter
[50:52] only glory to God but they are
[50:55] Christians
[50:57] amen and um but uh but but he was saying
[51:00] he he says you know often times what
[51:02] we're seeing today is that people just
[51:04] have just enough to get them to go to
[51:08] church on a regular basis but they they
[51:11] not really uh willing or looking to go
[51:14] deeper in the things of God hello
[51:17] somebody and uh and it says uh you know
[51:20] what what happens is that they um uh
[51:23] they have eyes to see and what what he
[51:26] means by that is that they have eyes to
[51:28] see and understand um uh I'm going to
[51:32] use this term when we preach
[51:35] Jesus Hallelujah because there's a lot
[51:38] of people that would tell you all you
[51:40] need to do is preach Jesus well if you
[51:44] really understood scripture what I just
[51:47] read at Revelation 10 was
[51:51] Jesus and I am preaching
[51:54] Jesus right but but but but when they
[51:57] when when you hear people say preach
[51:58] Jesus what they're talking about is the
[52:00] five uh the the the five the the two
[52:04] loaves of bread and five fish or five
[52:06] loaves of bread and two fish or whatever
[52:07] it was but the just Loaves and bread
[52:09] they want the miracles of Jesus but they
[52:12] don't want the word of Jesus but but
[52:15] when we preach Jesus we going to preach
[52:17] the miracles of Jesus and we're going to
[52:19] preach the prophecy of Jesus we going to
[52:21] preach the word of Jesus we going to
[52:23] preach all of that that that's Jesus
[52:26] amen Jesus is found from Genesis to
[52:29] Revelation and that's what we preaching
[52:31] right here we preaching Jesus Hall amen
[52:37] but but it's very important for us to
[52:39] understand you know uh just the depths
[52:42] of the word of God right right uh Jesus
[52:45] himself gave prophecy and we need to be
[52:47] able to look into those prophecies that
[52:49] Jesus was speaking about how is this
[52:52] being manifested right it's not just
[52:55] we're not here just for for fish and and
[52:58] and and bread because the Bible tells
[53:00] that man should not live by bread alone
[53:01] but by every word that proceeds out of
[53:04] my mouth we're not just here for
[53:06] miracles amen we're here for the word of
[53:08] God come on somebody amen we're here for
[53:11] the word of God so so I'm going to kind
[53:13] of you know he he says he says what what
[53:15] it is that people just religious enough
[53:17] to be able to go to church but really
[53:19] not get deep and say what it is the
[53:21] scriptures being fulfilled in their life
[53:22] they have eyes to see but they cannot
[53:26] see see right Hallelujah they can't see
[53:29] the deeper things of the word of God sir
[53:31] all right let's here in that message
[53:33] super signning makes a comment says
[53:35] watch these
[53:38] geese over here in Texas where many of
[53:41] them go I've seen the time uh that we
[53:44] have to stop the car on the road they
[53:47] are not bothered about nobody they're
[53:51] thinking about going uh they got a
[53:53] revival going on the geese
[53:56] right he said they got a revival going
[53:59] on all of them together you never heard
[54:02] such a noise he says it's worse than the
[54:06] Pentecostals when they when they get
[54:09] together he talk about geese now he's
[54:10] looking at God in nature Hallelujah you
[54:14] can if you study nature sometimes you'll
[54:16] find how God operates how God moves and
[54:20] and and we're we're getting ready to
[54:22] kind of step into something here and and
[54:24] I might I might be ahead of myself but I
[54:25] might as well said if I repeat myself
[54:27] it'll be good because that mean the
[54:29] message amen will get home sometimes you
[54:31] got to repeat yourself to ensure that
[54:32] the message get home but he said what
[54:34] happens is that amen there's a cold
[54:37] spell that will hit up in Canada and
[54:40] when that cold spell hits in Canada it
[54:43] is a sign to the geese that is time to
[54:47] leave
[54:48] Canada yes sir oh hallelujah amen and he
[54:52] says uh one of those geese say never
[54:56] ever
[54:56] led the pack before all right glory to
[55:00] God but this geese was born with a
[55:03] certain amount of
[55:05] inspiration and God put it inside that
[55:07] one geese not all the other geese now
[55:10] but this one geese would catch the
[55:12] inspiration that it's time to go
[55:17] south and all he had to do is just feel
[55:20] a little bit of cold
[55:21] weather and when he when he feels the
[55:23] cold weather he know now wait a minute
[55:25] this ain't this this ain't the right
[55:27] temperature this ain't the right place
[55:29] for geese will'll freeze out here if we
[55:31] don't do something about it we will die
[55:35] right here if we don't do something
[55:38] about it and and God has orchestrated
[55:41] and has ordain that there's a place that
[55:44] the geese can
[55:46] go are y'all going to preach with me
[55:49] today but they have to be led by
[55:52] inspiration of where amen of just I mean

[1:06:10] runs his events it always has been it
[1:06:13] never has failed and it never will fail
[1:06:16] he says if we just follow the continuity
[1:06:19] of God's word we will never fail either
[1:06:23] if we'll take if we'll not take the
[1:06:25] modern trend of the day and try to
[1:06:27] inject something else into it but just
[1:06:29] follow the continuity of it for this age

[1:06:42] says now watch these signs yes sign is
[1:06:47] when it gets cold leave the North and go
[1:06:50] south when it gets hot it's time to
[1:06:52] leave the South and go back North this
[1:06:54] is what the geese follow the signs that
[1:06:57] God has placed in nature the laws of
[1:06:59] nature the the Four Seasons and they
[1:07:01] follow those signs Hallelujah if geese
[1:07:05] are are are are are smart enough to
[1:07:08] follow these signs what about the people
[1:07:10] of God we got to recognize when signs
[1:07:12] are occurring around us amen glory to
[1:07:16] God we got to recognize when signs are
[1:07:18] happening you know the scripture even
[1:07:19] speaks of like you know there'll be
[1:07:21] signs in the in the in the heavens you
[1:07:23] know and in the earth we see all these
[1:07:25] kind of I mean you
[1:07:27] know Lord and please if I forget to do
[1:07:30] this we need to do it the people out in
[1:07:32] California uh just the fires are just
[1:07:35] out of control and and I mean when you
[1:07:38] you when you imagine I heard that they
[1:07:40] they got fires I think four fires that's
[1:07:43] almost about to connect and then they
[1:07:45] don't even have water to be able to put
[1:07:46] the fires out you talk about uh a major
[1:07:51] problem that's a major problem people um
[1:07:55] I mean and it just start
[1:07:57] from who knows where it start from even
[1:08:00] during the
[1:08:01] winter right I mean just so so sometimes
[1:08:04] we look around we see things happening
[1:08:05] all around us judgment settling in right
[1:08:08] judgment settling in but but but but as
[1:08:11] we see these things we are we the
[1:08:12] scripture tell us look up for our
[1:08:13] Redemption is drawn n the the the time
[1:08:16] of the coming of the Lord is at hand and
[1:08:18] there are signs that happen to show us
[1:08:21] that his coming is near amen oh my and I
[1:08:26] can just say not just near but his
[1:08:27] coming is
[1:08:30] here we living in the coming of the Lord
[1:08:33] right now amen Amen Let me let me let me
[1:08:36] keep reading here's a statement that I
[1:08:39] think is very
[1:08:40] important we watching signs there's one
[1:08:43] big sign that the prophet says is H says
[1:08:46] prophets are the chief
[1:08:53] sign come on now so when God sends a
[1:08:56] prophet on the earth that is a chief
[1:09:00] sign that's a huge sign that's a big
[1:09:04] thing that God just did that you need to
[1:09:06] keep your eyes on prophets are a are the
[1:09:11] chief
[1:09:13] sign he says God's chief sign is a
[1:09:18] prophet says I'm going to speak a few
[1:09:21] minutes about that they are uh they are
[1:09:24] his word made manifest for that age now
[1:09:27] now uh you you we looking at that but
[1:09:29] what I'm what I'm what I'm trying to get
[1:09:32] you to see is when I read to you these
[1:09:33] scriptures I read Revelation 10:7 I read
[1:09:37] Revelation 3:14 I read Malachi 4:5 and
[1:09:41] six I I read these things those
[1:09:44] scriptures amen when that Prophet shows
[1:09:46] up he is the
[1:09:49] manifestation of those scriptures when
[1:09:52] John the Baptist showed up he was the
[1:09:55] manifestation of Malachi 3 Hallelujah
[1:09:59] right hello somebody when Jesus Christ
[1:10:02] came on the earth and was born of a
[1:10:04] virgin he was the manifestation of
[1:10:06] Genesis
[1:10:08] 3:15 the woman's
[1:10:10] seed amen and then Isaiah said that a
[1:10:13] virgin shall conceive Jesus became the
[1:10:17] manifestation of what Isaiah prophesied
[1:10:20] about it can you imagine Isaiah being in
[1:10:23] church my Lord
[1:10:26] amen and raising up and saying thus
[1:10:28] sayith the Lord I feel
[1:10:30] [Music]
[1:10:32] inspired what is it Prophet what is it
[1:10:34] what is it that you see a virgin shall
[1:10:40] conceive prophet of
[1:10:43] God
[1:10:45] now Prophet we done we done heard some
[1:10:49] of your prophecies but now this one
[1:10:50] right here is just a little bit too
[1:10:52] farfetched did you hear what you just
[1:10:54] said a virgin shall
[1:10:57] conceive now there was some that
[1:10:59] probably looked at the prophet Isaiah
[1:11:01] and say ain't no way this man done lost
[1:11:02] it I'm sorry God has left them it's it's
[1:11:05] this is just impossible that that is
[1:11:07] that has never happened before never
[1:11:09] will happen we and and they probably
[1:11:10] didn't they didn't know that right there
[1:11:11] in the scripture he was only saying what
[1:11:13] what what was already prophesied God
[1:11:16] himself prophesied in Genesis 3:15 he
[1:11:19] was connecting to that prophecy
[1:11:20] Hallelujah but they probably didn't put
[1:11:22] it all together and then now there are
[1:11:23] some that probably believe and they
[1:11:24] start not testifying I'm that virgin I'm
[1:11:26] that virgin I'm the one that's been but
[1:11:28] God said no no no you ain't the one God
[1:11:30] was waiting years and years and years
[1:11:32] and years before this virgin would
[1:11:34] actually come on the earth my God and
[1:11:36] all the conditions that happened with
[1:11:38] that virgin that was on the earth y'all
[1:11:39] got the you go back you studied the
[1:11:41] story Mary Mary Mary lost her father at
[1:11:43] a young age she was raised in a single
[1:11:46] family home by her by her mother you can
[1:11:49] imagine the mama trying to keep all the
[1:11:51] all the buzzards off of
[1:11:52] Mary right right hello somebody MH I
[1:11:56] mean just trying to no you can't go out
[1:11:57] with your cousin you can't go to this
[1:11:59] house and you can't do that you got to
[1:12:00] stay here with me and her and Mary just
[1:12:02] going back and forth but Mary not even
[1:12:04] knowing why her mama had to be that way
[1:12:07] right yes sir oh God right but but here
[1:12:11] Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary subjects
[1:12:13] herself to a mother and then one day
[1:12:15] here comes this this brother that has an
[1:12:17] interest in
[1:12:18] Mary now his situation he's already been
[1:12:20] married and he got kids right hello and
[1:12:23] he want Mary to be this his his next
[1:12:25] wife but he's well off he can take care
[1:12:28] of he can do all these things whatever I
[1:12:29] mean I guess well off for that day but
[1:12:31] you know he can take care of him we we
[1:12:32] we have this kind of life but but here
[1:12:34] he comes he wants to court Mary oh Lord
[1:12:36] have mercy but Mary gets Mary Mary
[1:12:39] brother Brandon say Mary and Joseph just
[1:12:40] having a little bible study reading the
[1:12:42] book of Isaiah
[1:12:44] Hallelujah and and they they come across
[1:12:46] the scripture a virgin shall conceive
[1:12:48] and Mary said what you think the
[1:12:49] scripture mean by that uh Joseph say I'm
[1:12:52] not really sure but that's what the
[1:12:53] Bible say so we say Amen to it yes so so
[1:12:57] Mary go home and and and she's thinking
[1:12:59] about the scripture and see this is what
[1:13:01] happen when you thinking about the word
[1:13:02] he'll draw near if you think about him
[1:13:05] he'll draw nigh to you glory to God you
[1:13:08] draw nigh to him he'll draw nigh to you

[1:13:24] going to be a son you're going to call
[1:13:25] him Jesus and and and she like wait a
[1:13:28] minute wait a minute wait a minute now
[1:13:29] you know I don't know no man that that
[1:13:31] my testimony I a't been I ain't been
[1:13:32] going from manto man I'm I'm I've been
[1:13:34] keeping myself waiting the marry J just
[1:13:37] say say I know what you've been doing
[1:13:38] but God has called you to be the
[1:13:41] manifestation of his word am how shall
[1:13:46] these things
[1:13:48] be seeing that I know not a man and here
[1:13:52] come Mar Mary he said he say the Holy
[1:13:54] Ghost will overshadow you and and caus
[1:13:57] for this to be manifested in you she
[1:13:59] never even heard anything about the Holy
[1:14:00] Ghost all this was new language to Mary
[1:14:04] but you know rather than Mary sit there
[1:14:05] and start uh H uh trying to figure it
[1:14:08] all out Mary said one thing that created
[1:14:10] the change she said be it unto me
[1:14:14] according to Thy word Amen brother
[1:14:17] random said that's when the pregnancy
[1:14:19] happened right there as soon as she said
[1:14:22] amen to the word of God
[1:14:25] amen but when Mary came she was a
[1:14:28] manifestation of that
[1:14:30] word when when we see these scriptures
[1:14:32] that I'm sharing with you and I got more
[1:14:33] than I'm going share when you see uh a
[1:14:36] prophet comeing see he's the chief sign
[1:14:38] and he is the manifestation of that word
[1:14:41] and this is why I always ask people if
[1:14:42] brother Brandon was not the
[1:14:44] manifestation of it all you got to do is
[1:14:47] just tell me who it
[1:14:48] was that's all you need to do is tell me
[1:14:50] who was the manifestation of these
[1:14:52] scriptures that I'm sharing with you
[1:14:54] amen we need need to know right we need
[1:14:56] to know because that's a chief sign
[1:14:59] right before the second coming of the
[1:15:01] Lord yes sir amen let me keep
[1:15:04] reading prophets are the chief
[1:15:06] sign God's chief sign is a prophet now
[1:15:09] I'm going to speak few minutes about
[1:15:12] that they are his word made manifest for
[1:15:15] that age and that's the reason the
[1:15:16] prophet is always God's chief
[1:15:18] sign he has never sent a judgment upon
[1:15:21] the Earth without first sending a
[1:15:23] prophet yes Noah day no judgment before
[1:15:27] he he he sent a prophet I'm going to
[1:15:29] give you another one there was no
[1:15:31] judgment of Sodom
[1:15:33] Gora until God came to speak to his
[1:15:37] Prophet right right who was his
[1:15:40] prophet Abraham and if you don't believe
[1:15:43] it read Genesis 20 and7 it says he is my
[1:15:49] Prophet Hallelujah so Before Destruction
[1:15:53] could strike Sodom and gomorra God had
[1:15:55] to go to Abraham and before the rain
[1:15:59] fell in Noah's day God went to Noah
[1:16:01] glory to God Amen right before before
[1:16:06] the the darkness and everything fell uh
[1:16:08] in Egypt God went to Moses this is God's
[1:16:12] pattern amen so if he's the same which
[1:16:15] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:16:17] forever he would do the same thing today
[1:16:19] we better find the chief sign yes
[1:16:23] sir yes Lord
[1:16:25] Hallelujah glory and keep our eyes on
[1:16:28] that all right look at it now he says
[1:16:30] they are his word made manifest for that
[1:16:33] age and that's uh the reason a prophet
[1:16:36] is always God's chief sign he has never
[1:16:39] sent a judgment upon the Earth without
[1:16:40] first the prophet just see and search
[1:16:42] the scriptures a prophet is the chief
[1:16:45] sign of God to his people that he sent
[1:16:49] this person this certain person like
[1:16:50] Noah like Moses and Elijah and the
[1:16:53] prophets he sent them to manifest the
[1:16:56] word for that age Amen to give his
[1:17:00] people a warning just the same as he
[1:17:02] sends a cold spell upon the Ducks see
[1:17:04] how he just flipped it all the way back
[1:17:06] around just the same as he sends a cold
[1:17:09] spell upon the Ducks to run them from
[1:17:12] the north to the South continuity in
[1:17:14] nature continuity in the word he never
[1:17:19] fails to do it if he takes cold weather
[1:17:22] to run them down next year it takes cold
[1:17:25] weather to run them down if it takes hot
[1:17:27] weather to run them back the next year
[1:17:30] it takes hot weather to run them back it
[1:17:32] never changes God uses these signs Amen
[1:17:36] in nature in order for his geese to be
[1:17:39] protected and I'm telling God is more
[1:17:41] concerned about his people who are Made
[1:17:43] In His Image amen he's more more
[1:17:46] concerned about them than just the geese
[1:17:48] that's right Hallelujah he's concerned
[1:17:50] about the geese but he's more concerned
[1:17:51] about his people that's made his image
[1:17:54] it's up to us to follow the chief
[1:17:56] sign amen all right amen amen let me uh
[1:18:01] let me move amen a little
[1:18:04] further one one more quote here and then
[1:18:08] I want to just hit the
[1:18:10] scripture this is from the anointed ones
[1:18:12] at the end
[1:18:14] time praise God ano the anointed ones at
[1:18:19] the end time now I'm I'm giving you the
[1:18:22] title but I told you in the title
[1:18:26] there's a
[1:18:27] message and and what he what he's trying
[1:18:29] to tell you is that there will be some
[1:18:31] anointed people in this end time it'll
[1:18:34] look so much like the real close it'll
[1:18:38] be so close and and and it seem like man
[1:18:41] they got they got this going on they got
[1:18:43] that going on they got this I mean look
[1:18:44] at where they worshiping look at these
[1:18:46] big buildings they got it's going I mean
[1:18:47] it's going to look so good to people so
[1:18:50] enticing but it's going to be absolutely
[1:18:53] wrong
[1:18:55] come on now absolutely wrong I mean one
[1:18:58] one one one I told you recently fellow
[1:19:00] asked me so what you what what's your
[1:19:02] thoughts about the church today it ain't
[1:19:04] what my thoughts are I ain't got no
[1:19:06] thoughts but I can tell you what the
[1:19:08] Bible says you know what the Bible say
[1:19:10] about the church today they're going to
[1:19:12] be uh it says that they going to be uh
[1:19:18] um Rich increase with Goods going to say
[1:19:23] they have need of nothing and not know
[1:19:26] that they are wretched they miserable
[1:19:30] they poor they blind they naked and and
[1:19:35] and and they don't even know that's the
[1:19:36] condition and then and then and then and
[1:19:39] then say now what what what Jesus thinks
[1:19:41] of them is that that they they in that
[1:19:43] condition wretched poor Mis I mean
[1:19:44] miserable poor blind and naked and uh
[1:19:47] and then he says the other thing that
[1:19:48] that that's going to happen with the
[1:19:49] church in this day that and it's the
[1:19:50] only only age where it's happens Jesus
[1:19:56] Christ the one that they say they
[1:19:59] worshiping the one that they say they
[1:20:00] praising he's going to be on the outside
[1:20:03] of his church knocking trying to get
[1:20:06] back into the
[1:20:07] church because he's been kicked out of
[1:20:10] the church how did he get kicked out of
[1:20:11] his church they forsook his
[1:20:15] word and the same people that say they
[1:20:17] preaching Jesus actually kick Jesus
[1:20:21] [Music]
[1:20:23] out think about it now I mean look look
[1:20:26] look look this happened history is
[1:20:28] repeating itself because in in in in the
[1:20:30] Old Testament um when they would come to
[1:20:34] the they bring they sacrifice to the to
[1:20:36] the uh to the to the uh to the church to
[1:20:38] The Altar and everything and to the
[1:20:40] temple they bring they sacrifice and
[1:20:41] they offering all these allst and then
[1:20:43] you know they had the the the the outer
[1:20:45] Court they had the inner Court they had
[1:20:46] the holies of holies and when Jesus died
[1:20:48] on the cross that holies of holies was
[1:20:51] actually torn in two and brother Brad
[1:20:54] said here they they're inside the temple
[1:20:57] looking at the very God right the very
[1:21:01] God that they rejected they looking at
[1:21:03] him on the cross inside the temple
[1:21:05] worshiping but they had rejected him
[1:21:08] Lord he was on the outside sir amen
[1:21:11] right and it's the same thing repeat
[1:21:13] he's on the outside of the church
[1:21:15] knocking trying to get back in yes sir
[1:21:18] and the people actually think he's on
[1:21:19] the inside because they feel a little
[1:21:21] anointed wow oh my
[1:21:25] the
[1:21:27] anointing the anointing can hurt
[1:21:31] you the
[1:21:33] anointing if you don't handle it right
[1:21:35] right yeah can cause you to miss the
[1:21:39] promised
[1:21:41] land you know under the
[1:21:43] anointing Moses struck a rock
[1:21:47] twice and got
[1:21:50] results right right
[1:21:55] with the anointing he struck a rock got
[1:21:57] results water came out the rock even
[1:22:00] though God didn't even tell him to do
[1:22:02] that he struck it twice and water came
[1:22:04] out amen amen that's how powerful the
[1:22:08] anointing is that if you if you do it
[1:22:10] you do you might get results Hallelujah
[1:22:12] you'll get results but here's the here's
[1:22:14] the problem if it's not according to the
[1:22:16] word of God you'll miss out on the
[1:22:17] promised land that's why Moses missed
[1:22:20] the promise then he had an
[1:22:22] anointing but he just did something that
[1:22:24] God told him not to do hello somebody we
[1:22:26] need to be careful about all these
[1:22:28] things let me let me the anointed ones
[1:22:30] at the end time let me read this real
[1:22:31] quick it says notice compare them
[1:22:35] together now when you get home notice
[1:22:38] Matthew 24:24 Jesus speaking and then it
[1:22:42] says Paul 2 Timothy 3:8 many others now
[1:22:45] and now compare that and uh and then put
[1:22:48] another scripture St Luke
[1:22:51] 17:30 Malachi 4 now he said compare them
[1:22:56] he says as Janice and jambre with stood
[1:22:59] Moses the anointed word for the hour
[1:23:01] Moses was the anointed word for the hour
[1:23:03] it says so will these men so can can I
[1:23:07] just can I just just let you all in on
[1:23:10] something I'm going have to let you in
[1:23:12] on something it is it
[1:23:15] is prophetic it is biblical for people
[1:23:20] to come against the
[1:23:22] message brother
[1:23:26] yes sir it's prophetic and it is
[1:23:28] biblical for people to withstand the
[1:23:31] message yes
[1:23:32] sir it's going to be a side to stand on
[1:23:35] you
[1:23:36] choose it's always been a side to stand
[1:23:38] on you choose which side but is biblical
[1:23:41] for them to withstand as as Janice and
[1:23:44] jam
[1:23:45] breze withstood
[1:23:48] Moses come on man the anointed word of
[1:23:51] the hour so will these
[1:23:55] men sir yes sir and look at what brother
[1:23:59] said not
[1:24:02] man
[1:24:03] men and you tell me we ain't living in
[1:24:06] that time that's a
[1:24:08] sign but I'm looking for the chief
[1:24:12] sign amen
[1:24:15] amen all right so will so so so so so as
[1:24:19] J as Janice and Jer withstood Moses the
[1:24:21] anointed word of the hour so will these
[1:24:23] men not not men men anointed
[1:24:27] ones they will resist the
[1:24:32] truth he says in the very day that the
[1:24:35] son of man is revealed Revelation 10 1-7
[1:24:38] read it when you get home the seventh
[1:24:39] Angels message opening up the seals
[1:24:42] remember I told you the the Thunders
[1:24:44] amen we were we were taught that the
[1:24:45] Thunders were the virtues no that's not
[1:24:47] what the prophet said right where the
[1:24:49] Prophet said he said he says these
[1:24:51] Mysteries are contained in the seven
[1:24:54] seeds
[1:24:54] that mean all of those seals were the
[1:24:56] Thunders every time a seal was revealed
[1:24:59] a thunder was
[1:25:00] released a thunder was made known amen
[1:25:04] yes sir it just that's what brother
[1:25:05] bradam told us that's what we stand with
[1:25:07] yes sir praise God now look he says this
[1:25:10] he says um the seventh Angel's message
[1:25:12] opening up the seals what is it not the
[1:25:15] angel is the son of man now this is
[1:25:17] important right here this is these
[1:25:19] important statements not the angel is
[1:25:21] the son of man but the messenger
[1:25:24] is revealing the son of man sometimes
[1:25:29] people think that when we quote brother
[1:25:30] brandom all the time and and they got to
[1:25:32] understand this it's it's if I didn't
[1:25:35] quote it it would be
[1:25:36] plagiarism like like this was mine that
[1:25:39] that you know you you need to come to me
[1:25:41] and get this I'm telling you the source
[1:25:42] that I got this from is free is
[1:25:45] accessible to you as well and all I'm
[1:25:47] doing is just quoting what a prophet
[1:25:49] said in order to keep the church in line
[1:25:52] now he does not take the place of Jes
[1:25:55] the question was asked the question was
[1:25:57] asked do y'all see brother Brandon as
[1:26:01] Jesus on the same level as Jesus the
[1:26:03] answer is no he was a star in the hand
[1:26:08] of Jesus but if you want to know where
[1:26:10] we see brother Bram he's like a
[1:26:12] messenger like Paul right like
[1:26:17] Moses Moses wasn't wasn't taking the
[1:26:19] place of Jesus and and Paul wasn't
[1:26:21] taking the place of Jesus but yet they
[1:26:23] were used by
[1:26:25] him they had very unique
[1:26:28] Ministries and brother brandom had a
[1:26:30] very unique Ministry for this time
[1:26:33] that's all it was and let me tell y'all
[1:26:35] something else I I was thinking about
[1:26:36] this after I left here last Sunday I
[1:26:37] might as well say this right now CU I
[1:26:39] say we got to keep our head above the
[1:26:41] fanaticism and let me don't don't lose
[1:26:44] my place but let me say this I've had
[1:26:46] the opportunity to go to brother's
[1:26:49] brother brandom's grave multiple times
[1:26:51] I've gone multiple times and uh and one
[1:26:53] time I
[1:26:55] went um you all you all seen the video
[1:26:58] that's that's out there on social media
[1:27:01] whatever it was where somebody went to
[1:27:03] the grave and they they have a little
[1:27:04] rope there roped off
[1:27:10] and if you see a rope
[1:27:14] right what the Rope means right don't go
[1:27:18] across that's what it means don't cross
[1:27:21] the just stay right here don't go across
[1:27:22] the Rope but somebody on the video
[1:27:25] decide I'm going to go across the rope
[1:27:27] and then I'm going to just lean up
[1:27:28] against the grave and take a picture and
[1:27:30] they leaned up against the grave and out
[1:27:32] out out from the the pyramid grave that
[1:27:34] they have there uh here comes a dove
[1:27:37] flying right out of the Grave you can
[1:27:38] see it right there on the video and I
[1:27:40] mean they saw they kind of jump did it
[1:27:43] take that to tell you not to go across
[1:27:45] the Rope the Rope should have told you
[1:27:47] don't go
[1:27:49] across but even the supernatural there
[1:27:51] is
[1:27:52] grave right
[1:27:54] there's so many things I could say but
[1:27:56] I'm trying to I'm going try to get away
[1:27:57] because I know we have we we have to
[1:27:58] keep our head above the fanaticism I was
[1:28:01] there at the grave I was there at the
[1:28:02] grave and and I remember the Holy Spirit
[1:28:04] uh specifically speaking to me and I'm
[1:28:06] like I told youall before God don't talk
[1:28:08] as much as people say he talk but I I
[1:28:10] have some instances in my life where I
[1:28:12] know I've heard the voice of God speak
[1:28:13] directly to me and this was one of them
[1:28:15] where he where I heard the voice of the
[1:28:17] Lord say um now he says don't you lift
[1:28:21] my Prophet too high m
[1:28:24] he says don't you drop him too low all
[1:28:28] right
[1:28:30] right MH the Holy Spirit told me that
[1:28:34] don't you lift him too high and don't
[1:28:37] you push him too low so you want to know
[1:28:40] what I'm trying to
[1:28:46] do that's that see see the name of the
[1:28:49] church is spirit Spirit and truth yeah
[1:28:55] we welcome the spirit we we believe that
[1:28:57] yeah but we got to have truth you got to
[1:28:59] have a balance on this and see if we
[1:29:01] didn't have a balance then the message
[1:29:03] would be no good to us let me go a
[1:29:05] little further that chair you sitting in
[1:29:08] right now got four feet on it if one of
[1:29:10] them feet was
[1:29:14] missing just one one foot missing the
[1:29:19] chair no good you would not sit in that
[1:29:23] chair if somebody gave to your one foot
[1:29:24] missing like wait a minute what you you
[1:29:26] trying to hurt me and that's what people
[1:29:28] have done in this message they've hurt
[1:29:31] others amen because they got a few
[1:29:34] things missing amen but what we're
[1:29:36] trying to do is keep it all right there
[1:29:38] amen hallelujah somebody let me let me
[1:29:42] let me let me finish reading I'm I'm I'm
[1:29:44] I'm doing the best I can I'm running out
[1:29:46] of
[1:29:47] time amen I'm glad I got another
[1:29:51] year I I'm really in overflow mode I'm
[1:29:53] in overflow
[1:29:55] mode amen here he says not the angel is
[1:30:00] the son of
[1:30:02] man but the
[1:30:04] messenger is
[1:30:06] revealing the son of man can you get it
[1:30:10] separated now yeah that that's where it
[1:30:13] seems to be so hard for you you see not
[1:30:16] the son of man
[1:30:19] himself and we going to read Revelation
[1:30:21] I mean uh uh St Luke 17 in a little bit
[1:30:24] cuz that's what he just referred to
[1:30:25] let's look at some of these prophecies
[1:30:27] from Jesus we not just going to church
[1:30:29] to talk about fish and and and and and
[1:30:31] and
[1:30:32] bread right we there's more to this word
[1:30:34] than just fish and bread now that's part
[1:30:36] of it he wants to be your provider if
[1:30:38] you need fish and bread he'll give it to
[1:30:40] you but you know after he gave him fish
[1:30:42] and bread he was trying to break the
[1:30:43] really break the word with him
[1:30:45] that's but they they were so caught up
[1:30:47] on just the natural
[1:30:49] foot I'm trying to do more than that
[1:30:55] if if you can get what I got for you
[1:30:57] you'll be able to pray for your own
[1:30:59] bread and it'll break and it just keep
[1:31:03] applying itself because you you done
[1:31:05] contacted the
[1:31:10] source you you'll be able to figure out
[1:31:12] how to do this on your own without me
[1:31:15] even being
[1:31:16] present oh he told us if your brother
[1:31:19] needed
[1:31:20] rain on you can give your brother rain

[1:34:12] amen amen
[1:34:14] amen let me just keep
[1:34:20] reading can you get it separated now
[1:34:24] uh that's where it seems to be so hard
[1:34:25] for you see not the son of man himself
[1:34:28] but the seventh angel the seventh
[1:34:30] messenger is revealing to the
[1:34:33] public the son of man which is Christ
[1:34:37] all right it says because it's left the
[1:34:40] shook he can't organize it it's the
[1:34:43] grain itself
[1:34:45] again and it says and in the in that day
[1:34:49] Janice and jambre will withstand
[1:34:51] anointed ones make believer
[1:34:54] and unbelievers the church formal and
[1:34:57] the
[1:34:57] [Music]
[1:34:59] Pentecostals Lord this is so
[1:35:02] powerful the make Believers and the
[1:35:05] unbelievers this is J Janice Jamber is
[1:35:07] going to be able to kind of get them I
[1:35:09] heard brother Dennis McBride preaching
[1:35:11] yesterday uh it's many people that have
[1:35:13] an intellectual Faith but not a real
[1:35:16] spiritual Faith he said intellectual
[1:35:18] faith will not get you a healing he says
[1:35:21] there was people coming into the prayer
[1:35:22] line you know brother Brandon we got
[1:35:24] faith we got faith we got faith we got
[1:35:26] faith we believe God gonna do we believe
[1:35:27] and they just doing all this talking
[1:35:28] while they walking through the prayer
[1:35:29] line brother Brandon said I knew just
[1:35:31] because they said it I knew they didn't
[1:35:33] have
[1:35:34] faith and brother Dennis began to bring
[1:35:37] out say you want to know what what faith
[1:35:38] would do is what it really looked like
[1:35:40] it looked like the woman with the issue
[1:35:42] of
[1:35:43] blood that woman had no promise she had
[1:35:47] no example in scripture uh of what she
[1:35:50] was thinking about doing but she said if
[1:35:53] I could just Touch the Hem of His
[1:35:56] Garment then I know I will be made whole
[1:36:00] he don't have to say a word to me he
[1:36:02] ain't got to talk to me but if I I done
[1:36:05] went through this for 12 years but if I
[1:36:08] could just touch to him of His Garment
[1:36:10] and that woman begin to push this person
[1:36:12] to the side and push that person to the
[1:36:14] side and and all she did she reached
[1:36:16] something and she all them robes pass by
[1:36:19] she said but if I get him I'm done yeah
[1:36:22] yeah amen hallelujah
[1:36:25] Hallelujah turn to walk away her faith
[1:36:28] said that that's all I need he ain't got
[1:36:29] to say a word I know I got mine sir and

[1:38:57] miraculous
[1:38:59] amen Amen Let me let me come on come on
[1:39:03] help me Jesus help me Jesus all
[1:39:06] right see that that's where it seems to
[1:39:09] be so hard for you see not the son of
[1:39:10] man himself but the seventh angel the
[1:39:11] seventh messenger is revealing to the
[1:39:14] public the son of man because it's left
[1:39:17] the shuck he can't organize it it's the
[1:39:19] grain itself again and in the days of
[1:39:21] Janice and jambre uh and in that day
[1:39:24] Janice and jam will withstand anointed
[1:39:25] ones make Believers and unbelievers the
[1:39:27] church for and the Pentecost will stand
[1:39:29] up against the True Grain but let them
[1:39:31] alone their Folly will be made manifest
[1:39:33] as theirs was see you understand
[1:39:36] now Revelation 10 said in the days of
[1:39:39] the sounding of the seventh angel now
[1:39:42] remember seventh Leia Church age that's
[1:39:45] why I read yeah Revelation 10:7 and
[1:39:48] Revelation 3:14 the prophet just tied
[1:39:51] those two together for us right it says
[1:39:54] Revelation 10 said in the days of the
[1:39:56] sounding of the seventh angel now
[1:39:57] remember the seventh Le Church age the
[1:40:00] sounding of that angel when that church
[1:40:04] age is done denominated and become a
[1:40:08] church age when it's done in its
[1:40:10] Pentecostal organization when the
[1:40:13] messenger to that what was each
[1:40:14] messenger what was Martin Luther a
[1:40:17] rebuke to the Catholic amen what was
[1:40:20] Wesley a rebuke to the Lutheran an to
[1:40:24] them lutherans what was the Pentecost a
[1:40:26] rebuke to them others so Pentecost was a
[1:40:29] rebuke to uh the lutherans as well as to
[1:40:31] the W the wesling which are the
[1:40:35] methodists John Wesley was not the
[1:40:38] founder of the Methodist Church John
[1:40:40] Wesley was the messenger during that age
[1:40:42] but it was the people that came after
[1:40:43] John Wesley that started the Methodist
[1:40:45] Church organization right right yes sir
[1:40:48] amen and so so so so every time God
[1:40:51] sends a man on the scene with a message
[1:40:53] John Wesley was a star in the hand of
[1:40:55] Jesus just like Paul come on somebody
[1:41:00] and just like William brand only thing
[1:41:01] about John Wesley Martin Luther all
[1:41:04] these guys were stars in the hands of
[1:41:06] very very unique Ministries that God
[1:41:09] gave
[1:41:10] them only only difference with Luther
[1:41:13] and Wesley is that they were not
[1:41:15] prophets they were
[1:41:18] reformers Hallelujah but a prophet comes
[1:41:21] on the scene and this end time as a
[1:41:25] chief sign to be able to kind of help us
[1:41:28] get back in line with the word this what
[1:41:30] the whole get back in Step we've gotten
[1:41:32] out of step with the word and now God's
[1:41:34] trying to get us back in step that's not
[1:41:37] just for you all sitting here in the
[1:41:40] church that's for people that's online
[1:41:42] that's watching and they they realize
[1:41:45] wait a minute this is much much greater
[1:41:46] much deeper and God saw all of all of
[1:41:50] christiandom God saw every denomination
[1:41:53] God saw every organization God knew all
[1:41:56] of that would happen and anytime you
[1:41:57] start talking to people about
[1:41:58] denomination they'll be first one that
[1:42:00] God ain't in that I know God ain't in
[1:42:01] that but yet they in
[1:42:06] it what God's trying to do is to say I

[1:42:49] year but God ain't put it in him to lead
[1:42:52] and he took off and he went rather than
[1:42:53] going to Texas he took the geese all the
[1:42:56] way across the water to to London and
[1:42:59] when they got to London they were just

[1:58:41] rebuke to the Pentecost SE to fulfill
[1:58:44] [Music]

[1:58:59] so much to me to fill the scripture this
[1:59:02] hour I'm I'mma come
[1:59:05] back but we have to understand there
[1:59:10] were scriptures pertaining to this day
[1:59:14] the coming of the Lord is just one
[1:59:16] scripture right how is the Lord coming
[1:59:22] it's a
[1:59:23] shout it's a voice it's a trump what is
[1:59:28] a shout what is the voice what is the
[1:59:34] Trump now I'm going to shock you if
[1:59:36] you've never heard this
[1:59:38] before the
[1:59:42] shout is this very
[1:59:45] message that I am preaching to you am
[1:59:50] amen yes yes
[1:59:52] [Music]
[1:59:55] yeah
[1:59:58] voice you got to be able to hear Beyond
[2:00:01] brother Jack's voice right yes you got
[2:00:04] to be able to hear Beyond me saying
[2:00:05] brother brandom say it you got to be
[2:00:08] able to hear beyond that because Jesus
[2:00:10] said my sheep
[2:00:14] hear my voice and a
[2:00:17] stranger they won't follow amen
[2:00:22] so the same voice that call Lazarus out
[2:00:26] is the same voice that I heard sister
[2:00:28] Bernice said he brought me out then she
[2:00:31] said he brought me
[2:00:37] in you can hear a message in the
[2:00:40] song if you just listening I mean where'
[2:00:43] she get that from she got a revelation
[2:00:45] he brought me out but he also brought me
[2:00:47] in brought me into what brought me into
[2:00:49] this messag amen amen amen amen the
[2:00:53] voice the voice of God has been calling
[2:00:57] through this message calling to his
[2:00:59] people to come back to his
[2:01:03] word then it said the Trump you know the
[2:01:08] same Trump that calls us
[2:01:12] out is the same Trump that calls Israel
[2:01:17] back in right right let me just put it
[2:01:20] this way this
[2:01:22] message that has been given to us to get
[2:01:24] us ready to leave is the same message
[2:01:27] that's going back to Israel how do we
[2:01:30] know yeah cuz there are two
[2:01:34] witnesses according to Revelation 11 now
[2:01:36] you you people have been fighting for
[2:01:38] years on who these two witnesses are I
[2:01:40] got to leave they fighting for years but
[2:01:44] the fight is
[2:01:46] over amen
[2:01:49] amen I remember me and brother fin
[2:01:52] talking to an uncle of mine he had been
[2:01:54] taught that one was Moses and one was
[2:01:57] Enoch I think or something like that and
[2:02:00] and people have been preaching that
[2:02:02] Moses and Enoch the two
[2:02:03] witnesses and and and churches have been
[2:02:06] divided over it but when God sends a
[2:02:08] prophet a chief
[2:02:10] sign he gives us the understanding how
[2:02:13] we know who the two witnesses are and
[2:02:15] the fight is over once you catch the
[2:02:17] revelation of how to know he said the
[2:02:20] Revelation was look at their
[2:02:26] Ministries when you look at Revelation
[2:02:28] I'm sorry uh Revelation 11 and you look
[2:02:30] at the ministry of Moses and the
[2:02:33] ministry of Elijah that tells you who
[2:02:35] the two witnesses are their Ministries
[2:02:37] are right there in the scripture even
[2:02:40] though their names aren't their
[2:02:42] Ministries are so now you can put the
[2:02:45] the pieces together the
[2:02:47] puzzle that's why we thank God for a
[2:02:49] prophet and that's why we have to tell
[2:02:51] you remind you what a the prophet said
[2:02:53] you don't just take off running with
[2:02:55] your own thoughts amen amen we got too
[2:02:57] many preachers going to the pull pit
[2:02:59] with their own thoughts brother your
[2:03:02] thoughts ain't Vindicated sir but the
[2:03:04] prophets are and God is the one that
[2:03:07] Vindicated them so tell us what he said
[2:03:10] tell us just what he
[2:03:13] said God bless you church I got to stop
[2:03:16] there for the day
[2:03:23] come back to that quote that that's
[2:03:25] that's what happens with the anointing
[2:03:27] I'm telling you telling you the
[2:03:29] anointing just help you see things that
[2:03:32] you you just didn't see and I don't want
[2:03:35] to be in that class that I got eyes to
[2:03:38] see but I don't see no I want to see
