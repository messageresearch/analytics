want to go I always try to you know do something y'all because you're special to me but uh but just keep us in prayer we're just trying to find the model ordinal Will O Lord for a man of what he wants to the future thank you all for your faithfulness while we were away I just everything we travel set the church up where we have what we call replication and so one person out somebody else step in and just kind of keep things going that's that's the way it should be you shouldn't feel a big drop-off right when not when somebody's missing because the church is not built on one person the churches built on Jesus Christ a lannis so so I want to thank everybody just for every every role that you played and everything that you did just to keep the service award' a man in operation and the brothers just taking care of the prayer service Amen I was told that even brother symbol was involved in the prayer service p.m. Missoula PA Missouri these are connected and on on line just to be a partner but brothers prayer service and I say what play is a little brother symbol god bless you you know we we just we just appreciate that so everybody in their respective places I think up for the Troy handling amen on Wednesday night I didn't get a chance to hear if the services yet I know we had further gap man here last Sunday a minute came with his wife drove all the way down from Alabama just to take the service for grateful Amen for that as well and just appreciate everybody they met and all that you did to make sure that it went well Mauri to God Amen so I'm not going to do any more I'm gonna try to get into a lift here today if the Lord would allow musicians we appreciate y'all the specials that went forward by appreciate it man I am very very grateful for everything real nice spirit a man in the house Lord is good to come to church and feel like you went to church a man's a we certainly thank God for for this I am I you know his father's day and sometimes I try to be traditional sometimes you know I'm not and today I just kind of have a thought that's in between a man traditional and non-traditional so you all just bear with me I believe is what the Lord want us to just share you know the the while we were there in Israel and this happened to me the first time I went you know when you when your way as a the reason I went the first time by myself is because the brother that brother George II say brother Jack as a pastor you really won't enjoy the trip when when when the sheep come because you're just gonna be worried about the Sheep you know all the time you say what you need to do is go by yourself so you don't worry about the Sheep and you know and I'm like okay that makes sense and you know and he's right you know you're just wandering you know you got to look at everything things be happening happen it fast you know and I mean you know and and and not like you know cuz people you can't believe everything you hear on the loose right and you know ain't nobody getting shot in the streets and all that but for will you know take your wallet if you ain't watching but that's not just in Israel a man that that's everywhere you go right right you got you got to be watchful and when you're when you're you're responsible responsible for a group of people you can help but you don't just always keep your eyes open and things of that nature but even you know even spiritually while I'm away a man and things that make sure I'm constantly thinking about the church right I'm constantly thinking about the Saints when when you know I see brother Caleb put those will post out there and I'm just kind of following say okay who here who not here yeah i watch everything right come on now I'm a pastor when it's women what happened you don't understand what that do to me you understand I mean that that's why it's important for me to tell y'all you know I went if I'm not here if I just showed up y'all came to church one day not just wasn't here and I ain't tell y'all that I wasn't going to be here yeah I have questions and if you if not questions are concerned right you'd be hopefully yeah but when a pastor he all right I hope you all ask that question all right but that's the way I'm them with y'all if I don't know amen and not that I'm trying to be all in your business but you know I just sometimes you know lower everything everybody all right so when I come out and I just down around okay everybody good everybody good and when I don't see somebody it bothers me all right so you know but I tell you what we're gonna do today is just we're gonna preach and try to preach the devil out and you know and then we're just gonna keep pressing on but but we have a responsibility we got to be concerned about our brothers and sisters man and especially in this hour a man we want to be extremely concerned the devil is busy and you know we just can't give them too much time so it's some things that you know okay I've been awaiting now I got to come back and deal with you know just a few things so just pray for my I pray that God give me wisdom on a lot of things because we we just hate the devil we just we just hate him hey man I hate I hate them I hate to see when you know he ain't gonna stop you know but but we're gonna do all we can just to keep fighting hey man so I want I want to read two scriptures here today a man and one from the book of numbers and then the other from the book of Ephesians so if you all would just stand with me we'll read the Word of God together [Music] numbers chapter 31 and then like I said my thoughts are a little mixed between traditional and non-traditional here today I think it's important that we you know I can't even I can't remember a time or brother branham extra priest a Father's Day sermon but not to neglect fathers I think they're very important and sometimes we need to say something to encourage and strengthen them as well so we want to try to do that if we can numbers 31 it says in the Lord spake unto Moses saying avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites afterwards shalt thou be gathered unto that people and Moses thinkin to the people saying are some of yourselves unto the war and let them go against the Midianites and avenge the lord of Midian and let's just turn over to another scripture here in Ephesians praise the Lord I'm just picking up here in chapter 6 verse 10 a man says this finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and then the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand and the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins Girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication and the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints and for me that utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bound a brief word of Prayer before we take our fall today father we thank you for all that you have done here in the service your anointing that destroys yokes and the father we dis appreciate if we ask that you would now take control over the the word as it is being presented we execute take control of every thought that you would our just bless and anoint and minister to each and every one God and only way that you can every spirit that is the gift your spirit would take underneath the control of the Holy Spirit even right now it's in Jesus name we pray amen and amen God richly bless you can be seated let's not I'll give you my title and a little bit here but I do want to just you know here I wanted this open by reading a man this quote a couple quotes here the first one comes from time-tested memorials of God a man time-tested memorials of God and you know just as we're making preparation and again this being Father's Day I think it's extremely important that we understand a man the need for Father's hold on to that quote this for a second typically on Father's Day I always like to share this wonderful story a man that I heard some years ago there was a story of some group of a herd of elephants a man that were there in Africa heard of them and it has some scientists that kind of came and they they they thought to themselves that you know what we will take out some of the elephants from the herd and repositioned them to another place here in Africa and you know what to see what happens so they went in and they by helicopter they began to lift some of the elephants out and these were the the male the elephants the father figures they were taken out of the herd and they would take these take them out and they would put them into another area and and they come back to the area where they took them from and they just began to notice something there they noticed that a lot of the rhinoceroses begin to die and they were they were wondering is the rhinoceros got holes in them and everything and I wonder what in the world is going on is somebody coming out here and and spearing Iza these animals what are they doing you know ever since we took these fathers out these these rhinoceros is a time and they begin to do research and they realized that it wasn't some man coming out doing it but it was the the baby male elephants that began to take their their their tusks and they were disappearing you know these rhinoceroses and just killing the rhinoceros is like crazy and so they say you know well that behavior did not start until the fathers were missing all right so they decided to go back to this other area a man and and get the father elephants and bring them back in and reintroduce them you know to the herd again you know and and the thing I wanted to kind of catch with that is that sometimes a man with our experiments a man we can actually silence the voice of daddy I hope we get that right sometimes a man things that we do can actually silence the voice of daddy and you don't understand that the voice of daddy is needed right all sometimes you know dad don't say a lot they don't talk as much as mama I'm talking real good right now daddy don't talk as much as mama daddy do a lotta observing and when that is speak is gonna be just short words short sentences you you might your dad would you explain this and I might explain this no say there's one sentence you need to catch this right and so so what we find us that often times we take that it out of the picture a man with some of the things that we do when some of the decisions that we make we remove data from from the hurts brave the Lord but but the reason that the kids go WOW is because Dan is not there the reason things amen turn out the way that they turn out because the voice of daddy is not there now now don't get me wrong I think that there's some father's that you know have neglected their responsibilities a man I think that there's many that have walked away and run from you know what God called them to do but but on the other side I think there's something that has done what they need to do right and they've been right where they need to be but it must here they get neglected they get put if they get pushed to the side but when you want to see things settle down again go get daddy and they're from this remote place that you put them and and notice now it was the scientists that took them out and it was the scientists that had to bring them back again hallelujah amen so sometimes they're things that you do that might take it out but it's things you have to do to bring it back in again come on somebody right so you know what I like to tell this story because you know those elephants these baby elephants went wild they went absolutely wild because they did not have a man a father figure but when they reintroduced the daddy when they reintroduced eat these two the melt of the male elephants the father figures all the killing stopped all the killer stop now you know let me just while I'm here I'm going to just give you all some statistics they may it's important to have daddy hey man it's important to have daddy let me let me give you something here a statement made here real men protect the vulnerable that's what a real man does he protects the vulnerable he doesn't assault them growing up having learned that most based of the most that most the most basic tenets of manhood is the job of fathers oh lord have mercy the most basic tenant of man who is the job of fathers oh you look ya'll come and let me just say some things if you know anybody can make a baby you can be 12 but 13 and make a baby but I mean you can take care right you know and this is the thing I like I like that I like to see this you know when you call yourself being a man ma n lamb and you know you don't want nobody to tell you that you're not a man and just because you get a certain age don't make you a man huh 21 22 30 that don't make you a man a man is where you can meet oh right glory to God you know ain't no ain't no you know like I say anybody can go out there and make babies anybody can do that but when you notice and take responsibility right that's when you really becoming a man hey let me tell you something so moss and good luck this to take care of ourself how you don't take care of anybody else huh hey man and then it goes further than that glory to God hey man you gotta be able to take care yourself then take care of wife then take care of chillin they may not just have children can you take care of their children right I mean all this is necessary and when we talk about taking care of children I want you to understand the role that you know let me let me just give you give you something from from the Prophet you know just just so you understand your role as a daddy as a daddy let me let me let me let me help you understand that I'm going to go to this quote out of leadership dad is you've got to be there you got to be you got to be present it man you know the the one thing that I that I appreciate my father he was there my dad didn't run the streets my daddy was home right I mean we didn't have to worry about my dad had been out of the ball right Wayne worry about that Laurita got my daddy to bring bill home I think all the time we saw beer in the frigerator when they made beer brands [Music] right but my daddy won a drinking man he was sitting around you know sipping on the time in our presence and all that's not what my daddy did now he smoked a cigarette he smoked a cigarette until God delivered him and he knew it was wrong right and and I remember the day that I that you know I remember the timeframe that went got Dillard my damn he stopped smoking him I remember we were at the old church in this song this young fella was was sitting there battling cigarettes and he was like you know I can I can serve God I can do this but I just can't stop smoking e-cigarettes and my dad would say well you know I say you know just talk to him a little bit I say you say well how did you stop sir how did you stop my daddy you know not no no great playing you know you not know I got a patch and I put the patch on in the patent I won under that my dad has saved my dad to say the Bible say Oh hallelujah the Bible say resist the devil and he was me and he say saying that young man you have much larger than I am he says in our if you want to walk up to me and and push me with the size that you are you probably pushed me right now but if I just waste myself I don't care how big you are if I just waste myself and I all feel a little resistance then you probably know better push me down like that and what you need to offer the devil is the little bit of existence father's gotta learn how to write my title day is one just just one more battle one more battle one more battle and fathers you we gotta learn how to fight how to resist the devil not just for ourselves but we got also take responsibility for our families I got I got a quote here now if I forget to get a chance read my brother Brandon said you responsible you are held responsible for your household you have responsible for your wife you held responsible for your children Oh glory your God is holding you accountable for your family amen now our sisters we got to give them some space to do what they need to do to and you know in given space you might have to let some things just fall apart I know I know that will hurt some things you gonna have to delet fall apart right because you be like you'd be like are you gonna let this go down you just keep interfere with the process he will never come to responsibility if you always doing it and can I just offer a little bit more advice if you want a man young man to be a man you may have to let them hang around other man let me tell you something a woman can never teach a man how a woman came to it they take a man to teach another man how to be a man oh my god sometimes I have to talk to my nephew Calum I said man I'm talking to you man things man things when I'm talking to you man think that let me go back and tell everybody what I told you I'm talking to you man things and one of the one of the things you're gonna realize young men as you get up women talk women things and men talk men things Oh God I'm gonna read this quote I'm gonna give y'all some responsibilities in a second just based on the Prophet you know lord have mercy I'm trying to call me enough to be man but because we need them that way if a man amen it's a lot more like I was telling one of my brothers here one time I said when you when you think about marriage think about life marriage is like for four tires or tires on a car and if you are running you know your car and one of your tires go flat you can live alone you know you might be able to counter you're gonna rise slowly but you can keep right now and you got to be careful the way you ride because you might damage your rim and it's gonna cost you a lot more money to get fix right now if you get two flat tires shut it down right don't don't even try to go nowhere and I said I'm a marriage and life is like these four tires you know and and the way I've said you know you got your spiritual tire you got your mental time you got your physical time and you got your financial time and you got to have air and all your times your money funny you ain't going nowhere you ain't going away her family good that's why you need to learn how to set up that right physically you gotta be there mentally emotionally all that you got you gotta be there you know you know from a physical standpoint when daddy come home the kids want to jump on daddy back you need to be strong enough to handle that right they wanna sit on Daddy's lap you got to be strong enough that you got to be able to connect with them right there hey man right emotional you got to be there for them and you know and and I talked about spiritual you if you know my God my God if you ain't beat yourself how you gonna feed your family hey man glory to God so you know I mean you can tell a lot you can tell a lot you can tell a lot I just I'm gonna just leave it right there but but man if you want your especially for young men does not have a father in his life he's got to be around other men he's got to learn how to be a man amen you gotta be around other men if you're gonna learn how to be a man praise the Lord cuz they're stirring except that he's gone facing life that uh mama ain't gon face let me let me let me give it to you Freddie out of leadership the Prophet preached this message leadership and and notice this notice what he says the first is the mother's kindness then the fathers worked after the mother gives you your first step then you look to your daddy see so now mama time taught you how to walk and on ahead and not you look to your daddy mama taught you how to talk you know all these things but now you look too daddy all of us for wisdom he looked at daddy for wisdom not now if we were to be honest with ourselves there are things that come up in family dynamics things that happen within the family structure and I know what happens in that house and you know my wife she you know she handles a lot of the issues that come up between her and the girls because you know being a woman she can see things from a woman perspective but every now and then they have to ask daddy something right what you think about this and what you think about that and you know and I have to be able to kind of you know look at the situation and give you know based on based on experience to that out that I've gone through you know and and so dad is going to be involved somewhere and daddy got to be ready to take advantage of their moments prays alone right amen say first first thing is mother's kindness then is that then the father's word and at the mother gives you your first step then then you look to your daddy all of us for wisdom because he is the head of the house amen all right let me read that again amen all right said then you look at your daddy are all of us for wisdom because what he is the head that is the head of the house I know you know we don't got this thing now I work he ain't even working I'm gonna tell you what I heard a preacher say right here in this pulpit they came all the way from Philippines on Wednesday night and he told us something my think was over there whoa but it was a truth in half he say he say sister he said if your husband is making $10 a week when God has blessed you to make $1000 a week he say you know since you are the helpmate what God did without your thousand dollars to help his ten dollars now imitation when you can see it that way then your household gonna come back and Bible we live in an age now where women aren't able to out-earn the man but but we still got into our place a chord in the scripture just because you make more money don't make you the head you still got to subject yourself and submit yourself to his headship and it's all of them the way that you presented you know I guarantee if you say baby God gave me this thousand dollars Ben help this is to help you up ten dollars have you said you gonna make them you know strike something on this eco and like you don't want to go out and do more but you say you ain't made lentil but ten dollars I'm thinking a thousand dollars you you ain't never been nothing my mom and my daddy told me and you approving everything they see when you speak them words over your mate see the reason you got your situation the way it is right now can I use these words it's all jacked up it's because you don't spoke that over your relationship you gotta find your place and when you find your place you see God we're blessed hey man I got a blessed you get to the point where you know like Lord I'm so happy to be able to help my husband and make this money but you know Lord we got different responsibilities we got kids now and I'd like to be there for the kids you know because the mother offers certain things to the kids that the father just can't give oh hallelujah yeah I mean I don't know nowadays we got this mr. mom thing going on you can't find it in the Bible it's not there God never intended for the wife to take care of the family that was never God's intention it is the husband's responsibility a man search it's the husband's responsibility neither one got to go to work and you get a man that don't want to go to work you can't do something problem now you ought to be able to tell that when you court if if you paying attention and if you were just you know be patient you let some things come out right because you'll be able to see some stuff if you know you you cortland yeah y'all first start courting you take you to my college y'all you know you doing alright then all of sudden one thing you go to back down she tell you lost my job can you pay for it today now because you blind right and you just you just feel like you infatuated right and you and you're like this is the man for me huh and you are you say well yeah I'm gonna take care at this time don't worry and then you know he and he going any cars that got another job I got another like oh praise God put in a praise report by the job and anything you just oh god me the way and within two weeks I ain't got the job no more now I'm gonna tell y'all some I can't get into nothing [Music] i'ma tell y'all something you know because I'm the spiritual daddy right and daddy actually have to set expectations not just in the home but in the sex right but you know I can tell you if you lay the church you probably late to your job right you populating your job and if you ladie a job all the time do you think they don't use you and you be one that you know you know you live in Florida you know what happens with more that means people ain't got to give you no reason right and letting you go so here here think of this if they don't have to give you more reason don't give till don't give them a reason to let you go sometimes you got a hush your mouth you can't be involved another conversation why because you gotta take care of family [Applause] hallelujah hey man but sometimes the way that wheat wheat wheat the winter way that you treat God is indicative because if your treat go out that way then what you'll do to the boss man all right so this number tell you the way that you know cuz if you give you you know a brother Jack I want you to be a reference for me what I'm gonna tell them if it's Sunday I'll talk and you ain't change the service time in years it's fine at 10:30 every Sunday and they late I mean I'm a challenge you today I'm a challenge you today give god mode and when you give God more then watch them give you more if God can trust you your boss can't trust you either hey man come and I mean let me just read finish reading this and then I got some other things I need to share says the first his mother's count in the father's word after mother gives you your first step then you look to your daddy all of us for wisdom for he because he is the head of the house and he usually you know now now you know you have and some relationships the husband is the head but the wife is the neck and what that means is that she turns the head whatever direction she wanted to go and and and and and and and and and and and [Music] and as a man I can tell when a wife is turning her husband's hey you can tell whether that's coming from him or whether that's coming from huh you just see it all over that old look at what she just did look I haven't seen it I've seen what you didn't involved in that front that that's man's business it's just me and talking why are you responding to it or encouraging you need to respond no no no no don't don't do that don't do that don't do I mean you can tell when the wife doesn't making the neck turn see she put us the husband in certain positions doing this it no no that's not that's not organic so a man becomes a man just just it's organic it grows into E but not because it's Y turning his neck I mean turn this in you understand all right you already gone hey man thank you Jesus all right for wisdom because he is the head of the house and he usually not that he's any smarter cuz I'm just I'm just decent powerful statements because you know it's not saying that the husband is smarter than the wife sometimes and wife is actually smarter than husband and you know and I think there's a balance here because you know I remember Brennan gave this guidance advice man every time he was handling the books in the home they was always short of money it was always short but because he was the head of a house I'm gonna handle the money let me talk to you about money women think different about extra money than the way men think about it yet when a woman sees extra money you got chilling in the house she's thinking another dress the most shoes some some old you know stop some of this but some prevents she's thinking that right well the man says he say oil change you know wash the car upgrade the car I may be thinking something totally different here you know and we're also Wars I collided it create problems and let me tell you something you'll never get a man to think like a woman and you never get a woman to think like a man so you have to just accept that and just work through that phrase alone right and sometime is good when you got some extra money just give her a little something you don't know how y'all did brothers don't got that secret compartment in the wallet that they wife don't know nothing about and you know I don't heard it if it told me and I know y'all brothers are you can't tell everything you got she'll get it and when she got in the houses all these split accounts I know I know why I know why if they had by ten thousand dollars and another counting her husband knew nothing about it and he just got working working crazy trying to pay the bills and she's sitting on ten thousand never even said anything to him about the money that she had that's a shame I thought we was one the same thing with a hug he's sitting on all this money but got his wife out there working like like crazy see you know you know the stress comes me I had a funnel out and everything but that's okay baby just keep on we don't we don't we don't love each other the way Christ told us to love each other all right let me keep going now now now now sister you might be smarter than your husband brother branham told the brothers they look because of the bills keep running short when you run into books why don't you let your wife through the books just let your wife do it because she's better with handling money then you are so it's okay to understand that you got weaknesses and God gave you a helpmate so that you don't end up bro all right let me go on a man I'm going on I'm not that he's any smarter but he just made a leader of his family he's made he's made a leader of his family so we followed what I daddy says to when he says now son I would like for you to do a certain certain thing then we listen to him because it's wisdom right but listen see he has learned a whole lot and we've got to ask him to see what he learned then we can profit by his what he has learned he tells us now don't go and do this because I did that my father told me not to do it but I did it and it caused this to happen to me something bad so see that then he dad it tells us how to do and what to do right let me go on here says then after mother leaves us till the time we have to get a little wisdom to understand from daddy then we get another we get another leader and that's a teacher a good stuff a good school teacher she tries to teach you and give you an education to fit you've been in life a place a position that that you can read your Bible and you can read the songs and you can learn from God and read your self you see and then another thing maybe you have business and someday write you a letter mama daddy somebody write your letter you couldn't read it see so the teacher she has she has you then and she leads you to learn to write and to read and it's a good thing a good teacher to teach you right but now after you after you leave that after you leave the teacher one teacher after another one from a little primer a little first grade until you get out of high school or go to college then when you leave college and then the teachers through leading you see now mama has taught you to walk see Papa has taught you how to be brilliant how to be a brilliant and a nice young man and how to take care of yourself and behave yourself no what if what was that that's not right there daddy is instilling character he understand that is responsible is there still character you know I was I remember you know coming up and at my household I have me a proclamation it was my decision that in my house that my children will not be the worst kids in the church whatever I have to do to prevent that then my children will not be known as the baddest kids in church that was that was my Proclamation right I want it I wanted my kids to be respectful I wanted to be a you know lord have mercy I mean I wonder I want I wanted them to you know I wanted them to you know I wanted people to know that you know these kids are well behaved I want that right you know I remember this thing just came back to my one I wasn't thinking about just came to me one more time and I'm telling them brother Caleb on this one we was in the car all of us as a family and just driving we were looking at Christmas lights and our Kayla was in the back of the car and Caleb let out of word in the back of the car he didn't know no better right I mean it's coming her to school and it just came out of my fam you knew he didn't know no better cuz he said it they're gonna let out a word in the back of the car and you wanna like the world stopped from moving what was that you saying fart now you're asked the question but you don't want him to repeat the answer but you want them to know you can't speak like that you have to establish things later you have to take moments in you know and understand - daddy daddy you know there's some times some some things that all the data can say and you know sometimes daddy might sit and everybody going to go right around went there to say it but it ain't change what that I said daddy ain't changed what he said you know these um this this this this quote is telling us that the father is the one Papas taught you to be brilliant in a nice young man on how to take care of yourself and behave yourself now if daddy's done that then daddy has a right that when when the child is not doing what daddy has established that is that's the principle I was talking with some men they were saying how you know think that there is for a second I'm just all over the place I can't get this but if they were talking about how you know their children were going to a certain thing they want to do a certain thing and or or you know sometimes parents have their own desires for the children right I mean you might want your child to grow up to be a doctor but they're not good at math and you gotta force him to be a doctor no with no you know you wouldn't even let your own child operate on you so they're not gonna operate on nobody else that's that's not what it is right you got to find what really works fetch I would encourage them in that particular area right but also if a child has low ambitions then it's up to the parents account you see you see the potential and as a dad you see the potential you've got to call that out of that child you know you can do this and you're very good at this right you want to be the one to call it out of the child and you know so the these there's you know this gentleman was telling me to say well you know my child we was there was going a particular direction then they say didn't want to do that no more so I just let him do whatever they want to do I don't know about that I don't know about that I said I had a different situation and when my daughter was coming out of college I mean coming out of high school and she wanted to I mean she's good at cooking and she wanted to go into baking school well I looked at the culinary that's where their cognac I call it baking cakes I'm looking at the cuffs because that's my responsibility right I got a look at the money all the time make sure that this right so I'm going to cost laughs wait a minute cost you to get this certificate certification over here versus getting a degree over here so my encouragement like no I'll tell you what let's put the money and you going to college rather than go to culinary school so now after you finish college if you still want to go to culinary school we'll do something about that well by God's grace she got me graduating from college and then one more semester and I thank God she don't have a bachelor's degree right but as a father the reason that I had to say that to her is because I tried to take a shortcut when I was coming out of high when I came in high school and again I had a mama and a daddy speaking into my life pushing me to do other things that they knew I could do but I tried to take a shortcut I got tired of math English social studies science I don't want to see no more of it so I took a shortcut I went to a little college didn't have mother day got my degree and started working but you know what I found out that college would not allow me to transfer my credits to any other school and I don't paid all this money so right I don't want to waste money like that again it already happened to me once and I said you got me once you won't get my family so that's why based on my experience right I give advice based on the things that I went through and and and when a father's doing that that's not to Atlanta damage the child that's the protective child of the blessed thing that I'm happy when my daughter graduates you're graduating without any school day I'm appreciative of that I thank God for that so because that's not my testimony when I graduated I was in 40,000 and I'm still paying for it today and not even working in my field but still paying off the debt all right I want to so the the Papa has taught you how to be brilliant in a nice young man how to take care of yourself in baby stuff the teachers taught you in education how to read and write but now you're leaving papa you're leaving mama and you're leaving a teacher now somebody has to take you from here own a man so see this this is I preached the sermon some time ago seasons of a father's life and and and and when father gets to a season where his kids are now leaving he has to take on a different role that's not the same role anymore right he has to move on into something else now but there was a time where he was really guiding and giving this and giving that but now to get to a point now you got to figure it out on your own but I'm giving you everything you need now I got to find something to put my time into amen but I gave all my time I gave all my time but now I'm gonna find something else to put my time into already God this is this is the see when a person retires you know since they're not going to work every day they gotta find something to take up that time amen Laura God ministry is what takes up a lot of my time I don't mind giving my time to it I love it I love it but uh but here you know you got as a father you realize you got to move to a different just just a different mode now Amen because because things have changed look look at this you're leaving mama you're Lea that you're leaving a teacher now somebody has to take you from here on now who do you want to take you from here on that's right Jesus to take you from their own now that's a very good as the verifying Jesus takes you from their own a child said Jesus I should have put that in and see this is the thing about a father if I've established a certain pattern before my kids they suddenly faithfully serving the Lord before them then as a father that the true the true complement to the daddies life is to see his children begin to serve the Lord the same way he served the Lord that's the greatest compliment that a father or mother could ever get as a city of children serving the Lord the same way they serve the Lord brothers finally make that comment last night he said he said I took my kids to the youth media I'd just send them but I took them places and when they had this service I drove my kids there when they couldn't drive I made sure they was in the right environment and since I did what what God told me was a train up a child and the way that they should go when they get out of they won't depart he said since I did my part I'm expecting God I'm expecting God I don't know how and I don't know me but I'm expecting god a real man protector barnable not a stock them now you get that that's that's that's what I was saying there's other things that go along see it you know we were we were kind of going through a little journey here and and in my own life you know when I got got married and I had my father-in-law and my brother-in-law and you know we all you know going on you know just doing Mike but we had no idea that things was gonna change for our family had no idea that my brother-in-law was gonna be called home and Herrera at an early age I had no idea that my father-in-law would be called a home at an early age and when you look around this view you're the only man in the family ain't no of us to take on the responsibility you can't share this there's nobody to share it with you got to stand up and be a man alright and see young man I'm telling you this because you don't know what God has prepared for you later on in your life that's why why are you young you need to learn responsibility now because it's gonna come in handy later real men protect the vulnerable not assault them grown up having learned that most basic tenets of manhood is the job of father's not the police the basic tenets of manhood is the job of fathers not the police save a photo before the police get to the corner data should be there standing in this boy's face yeah maybe you know I had a brother tell me one one time it says his son got all big and you know took off when I did what he wanted to do got to a certain age that's part go do it you learn and say that the the board got to a situation you got needed some money guess what we tanks daddy then you got so much money that you can let me borrow F say all right got it they say okay I'll see you and left it like that so daddy called them saying is this a threat you saying you gonna see me do I need to be looking over my shoulder or do I need to just come where you at right now we need that is like that I'm bigger than bigger than that son bigger than him but I'm still daddy listen this was a quote from a guy Daniel Patrick Moynihan says from the wild Irish slums of the 19th century eastern seaboard to the riot torn suburbs of Los Angeles there is one unmistakable lesson in American history a community that allows a large number of young men to grow up in broken homes dominated by women never acquiring any stable relationship to male authority never acquiring any rational expectations for the future that community asked for it and gets chaos I want to read that again a community that that allows a large number of young men to grow up in broken homes dominated by women see the reason that is because a woman came to teach a man how to be a man right never acquiring any stable relationship to male authority right if a man never required and never acquires a real good relationship to male authority than what he's doing is so in the seeds for what he grew up in and when you when you're when you're acquiring notice that acquiring a man a state relationship is not making things that you have to be organic in what you do but you got to put them in environments where they can get that type of relationship but if they're never quiet and it stable relationship to male authority never acquire any rational expectations for the future that community asked for and gets chaos you know I'm I wanted to kind of come back here to this you know it's one more battle and father's you know you're constantly in in a battle I mean that it's it's one thing to the next I mean it just it never it never seems to stop you always seem that you know a dad is always you know if if he's doing what he needs to do there's always in a spot where he's got to come up with some type of solution he's always kind of I mean something go wrong with the car they looking Danny so I'm gonna wrong in the house Danny right something go wrong it Danny somebody show them buddy bill can't get paid right this is it this the way it is I mean and so you're constantly in this mode and you're under this pressure and you know my thing that I want to share with is that you know that is you're gonna be in a battle from here unto the end it's going to be one battle after the other and all I can say is just don't give up don't don't quit don't throw in the towel don't don't don't don't think about doing that if God made a way before he gonna make a way again but but whether the devil's job is to put the pressure on dad and then he walked out on his family that's not what God walk that's not what God intended for prefer to happen some kind of way if you just pulled together and pray about a god and make a way somehow right but you know I was I was looking at this a man and lord let me just see here I tell you what I was doing I got it I'm a saved that felt I'm gonna say that though I want I want to just give you some statistics data state stay in the race because the children need you mama and mama needs you everybody needs you just just in it stats on fatherlessness a mass sixty-three percent of all of you some suicides are from fatherless homes sixty-three percent of youth suicides are from fatherless homes ninety percent of all homeless and runaway children are from fatherless homes eighty five percent of all children who show behavior disorders come from five this homes 71% of all high school dropouts come from fatherless homes 71% of pregnant teenagers lack a father 75 percent of a delayed adolescent patients in chemical abuse centers are because of fatherless homes 70 percent of use in the state operated institutions come from fatherless homes eighty-five percent of all use in prison come from fatherless homes listen children's birth fathers who were involved are 40 percent less likely to repeat a grade in school now notice what he said children with fathers who are involved that is important to be involved whatever you do just stay involved in the children's life fight to stay involved in the truth don't get me wrong if you're not add no value then and some people fight to stand people life just to make other people like miserable but you ain't doing nothing for the child you ain't did nothing for the child right so you know listen if if you're gonna be involved realize it's gonna make the difference in that child's life children with fathers who are involved I mean ask them you know you can ask them about school every once in a while see how things go on you know and then you know just and I mean some some of the stuff that's going on in school some stuff they teaching it's going over the parents head and the sense of bringing it home they're like okay can you help me I can get you some help you might have to search the internet for my little big all right brother but but just be involved a man be involved another thing in children with fathers who are involved are 70 70 percent less likely to drop out of school if if the dad is involved children with fathers who are involved are more likely to get A's in school an extra sometimes to cut dad is established at man all right I remember when I like I said I don't want to go to college after after high school I just didn't I'm like I'm tired of math and English I'm tired of this out just tired but I wasn't tired of playing basketball and then it was see me doing that and that is just sometimes just asked me when you're gonna get in school oh well you know the date for the school is it's gonna be now here it is like Megan will September September's when they you know they they allow entry and everything okay my daddy kept it in his mind he come back a month later when you're gonna get him school when you're gonna get her school and when September got there because I want to hear that question I was in school sometimes daddy you need to just be annoying me man glory to God I'm going to tell you something when daddy don't speak up you can step to a lot of stuff can I give you all the scripture just one turn with me to numbers 30 I had something else to tell you my thoughts were blue they were going to different ways so I'm gonna just stay with this but numbers 30 here and and i'ma tell y'all something else being in the past I know y'all and then knowing y'all like like mama know what what children need to eat they bring candy home all the time that ain't gonna be good at 4 so mama got laid some vegetables down some green and stuff everybody hate the green and stuff but mama gonna lay it down there one smile because they need to eat that too to stay healthy and you know as passed I know what the church need to eat sometime hey man let me give you something here so father Joe I understand yellow roll look at this in numbers chapter 30 I want to to go to verse 3 if a woman also valid vow unto the Lord and bound herself by a barn being in a father's house house in her youth so this is the daughter right being in a father's house in her youth now by living at home in a daddy's house and she she she binds herself to something she makes a bond to something being in a father's house in her youth and her father hear her vow and an herb on wherewith she hath bound her soul and her father shall hold his peace at her then all her vows shall stand in every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand but if a father disallow her in the day that he heareth not any of her vows or of her paws wherewith she have bound her soul shall stand and the Lord shall forgive her because of father disallowed it you know just this it didn't say nothing about my mama but the daddy had the right to either allowed this this bow or this bond to be established or he can actually undo it only their daddy had that type of control see when we talk about having you know that that God gonna hold you responsible for certain things you need to understand your role as a father in the house you know there's certain things that daddy got to step up and say mama can't stay it won't be held to if mama sing but when daddy speaks things change remember I told you them elephants got wild when daddy got loose and when daddy came back into the situation that elephants calm him down again now it's not just that way for a daddy speaking over a man his daughter let's go on a little further all right yeah let's keep on reading here and if she had at all a husband when she vowed other all out of a lips way with street-bound her so and the husband heard it and held his peace at her in the end in the end the day that that he had heard it then her vows shall stand and her Bosworth she bound her soul since then but if her husband disavowed her on the day that he heard it then he shall make her vow which she vowed that and that which she uttered with her lips where was she bound her soul of none effect and the Lord shall forgive a scene at this time when a person about about the Bible says been a few to not vow then to valentown and breaking but if a person made any type of bow and it now so if it's a if it's a young lady in the father's house her father has the ability to disallow when she didn't marry her husband and only her husband has the ability to disallow in Gaza look at it let's keep on going it says I wish about him that which he uttered with the lips where she found a soul of not affecting the Lord shall forgive her but every vow of a widow and I've heard that is divorced when they have bound their souls she'll stand against her and if she found in her husband's house or bound or so about bound with an oath and her husband heard it and held his peace at her and disallowed her not that on her vow shall stand and every farm wherewith she found her soldiers stand but if her husband had utterly made them void on the day he heard them then whatsoever proceedeth out of her lips concerning her vows or concerning the fond of her of her soul shall not stand her husband had made them void and the Lord shall forgive her the role of the father the role of the husband is a very important role very important role now I know nowadays people don't follow the Scriptures but if you know yeah we kind of understand understood what it want us to make about back in those days and how God you know how God saw that bow right when we when we understand that only only only the male figure only the father only the husband had the authority in the household this is why God say he's the head it didn't put the wife there and didn't put them and didn't put the momma there it put the father this is what God say he's the head you find that back over in Ephesians 5 God has a purpose he has a order that he was established do you realize in the Garden of Eden it was Eve who sinned first but do you also realize that God did not come down until Adam got involved and you know what happened when he came down he knew Yvette said first but you know God Koffler you know God asked for when he came he didn't say nothing about Eve Eve read the Bible Adam Adam where art thou see Adam was held responsible for what happened in the garden can I tell you something man are held responsible what happens in their families not only that the man are held responsible what happens in the church all right let me finish this stuff oh Jesus Jesus brothers can I invite y'all to do something live a life that's so godly before your wife that she don't mind calling you my lord but when you live in this old Towton life she came to pin on you for nothing she don't save my lord she say my lord I want to call y'all up as men a man I want to call you up as men you have a responsibility these are some some things that I read out of a book and I just want to share them with you as a man you can be a chain breaker rather than a chain maker can I say that again you can be a chain breaker rather than a chain maker you can break the chains of alcohol and drug addiction you can break the chains of womanizing you can break the chains of rebelling against God you can break the chains of faithlessness see you start the legacy of faith you start the legacy of faithfulness and this brings blessings to your children let me tell you something when children see daddy involved that's when they tend to get involved you know when we were coming up and daddy was going to church but that was the easy thing to use well you know daddy's trying to force us into the church I've more time blowing me he got me in my brother one time what he got us good dad everyone going to church the week we follow his example that ain't going well I really want to go either I mean I see daddy kind of hanging out in the house little stumpy I think I want to hang out on the household stuff and one day dad is that you go to church and God I they start walking with my mother church and you know and back then it was it was it wasn't cool to walk to church not in church too low you all your buddies know what you're doing right so you know we we we we say we told my dad we'll we'll catch up with y'all you know me and my brother stayed back we'll catch up with y'all let the rest of the family go but we ain't walking with your no church now that one's gonna be that one the way it's gonna go down not with us well we have we stay around house a little bit too long all of a sudden daddy don't slip back at the house and and daddy open up the door one and when you open up the dough all that had to do is just let that belt jingle just a little bit we knew what that meant right and if we leave it we don't we got dressed smokers we've had the house of no time wanted to get to church I'm gonna tell you mama would have come back it might have been a little trouble but there's something about when daddy from daddy takes his position and daddy does what God has called him to do it changes the dynamics of the family you know even in this church we got broken families but you know what that still don't take the responsibility way from daddy especially if he's a godly man I'm gonna tell you you can't leave your family unless you following God that's the only gonna be believe your families when you following God so and I don't put it out there follow God with everything you got give them everything give them everything be faithful and everything matters you ain't got that much responsibility you ought to be given more to God than you ever gave it for when your responsibilities change then you're just with it listen when children see daddy involved they tend to get involved when children see their father is faithful to his marriage vows and they also want to follow the example when girls see the faithfulness of the father to their mom then they desire to have a similar marriage a man amen it's okay for the kids to see daddy kiss mama I rather see your kids were rather see daddy kiss mama doesn't see daddy hit mama when the girls see faithfulness from their father to their mom then they desire to have a similar marriage when daddy goes to work faithfully and brings home the money I thank God my dad was with him type of dad as he brought home the money I only remember one time in our lifetime once where the water was turned off I'd only remember at once and the reason I remember it was because my dad turned it back on [Music] maybe showing us well that's to the sidewall lift it up a little stuff I just ain't got the money not but I'm a pain y'all and dad goes work faithfully brings home the money that sets the pattern for children one time I pulled my nephew to the side because I don't want to teach him how to say that this is what you aiming for excellent show me his check you made from his look at this job you know he was happy I remember one time he walked round say my wallet is big and you've realized how much money you got in your wallet when when you go out to dinner for Father's Day or Mother's Day and the bill comes and you see you got it I got half you ain't got it yet but uh you know he was like my wallet is thick you know he you know had all these Warren's in there so you know I pulled him to the side and I haven't telling about it just close the door behind us and I went into the room and I pulled that one of my check stubs and I showed it to him oh I say the reason I showed this to you because I want you striving to do better than this this is the goal I want you to do better and you keep that in his hand and he keeps driving and he coming to it I heard somebody call him the first Wesco billionaire you'll walk into it walked right into it but as a man I want the establish certain things for this is your goal yeah your wallet think now but it can be thicker and only that why are you getting Y well it thick keep God first that's how I got my wallet thing I paid time offering that's how my wallet got things and then when it got a little less my knees were still mad all right let me go on the father's take action become the men that God has called them to be then they earned the right to pull the facemask of their children when they see them going astray a father can look at son in the face and ask where did you get that bad habit from them because you most certainly did not get it from me what makes change is that when we fail to live godly lives before our families that would create panels for future hurt and destruction these are hard decisions but they're important for the success of future generations I haven't changed it I'm a pre for one more battle later on I gotta preach that the day I got that to preach later on but today just call it father's thinking that's for the father's just a little something that to encourage and strengthen and and call to action a man aa daddy's a man of those that desire someday be father's they meant I trust that you got something that helped you along the way hey man let's pray let's pray father we thank you for your word we are we realize as men there's a tremendous responsibility that is on our shoulders and God as men we cannot shirk it we can't run from mistakes that we have made we have to own it we have to live up to it then we have to outlive a man in the past and God my prayers that you would give each one strength and to be who you have called them to be the devil is certainly there to to hold it all over their head but you're the God of second chances so father we pray that you would ripen all the ropes and that you would show us our place in you and what you've called us a man to be and and God as we as we walk in there as men get into the place that you call them then you will see that everybody else falls in line the wife father lying the children fall in line because because dad is in his place so God our prayer is that with with the responsibility hat that we return to you you told us to turn to you when we're heavy lead to God when we're burning down told us to bring our problems that lay them at your feet because Lord your burdens are light that's what you told us so help us Lord to realize that above all fathers even if we have not had a father figure in our life you are the father of all fathers and we can follow your example you've laid things out according to your word and we would just live according to that it'll work out just fine [Music] so help us O God is our prayer each father I pray that you bless them Lord many might go back through their miles and just think of different things that they could have done differently along the way but God I just prayed it to help them to see that where they are right now you have ordained for them to be and that nothing happens by chance nothing happens by mistake all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to your purpose of somehow you're able to turn hopelessness into a blessing do that in the life of all the fathers is my prayer in Jesus name Amen amen amen happy Father's Day that you all sister Liz you only have huh sang knows especially I'll show that got her up in the same god bless you're so good to see you sister Liz any advantage over to John amen just like I said title this Father's Day I'll come back later on and preach one more battle I got a lot of the things that I want to share there but this is the way the Lord wanted us to go for the day a man we just said we trust that it'll be a blessing and a help a man - all amen as we go forward in Jesus name you all I see it [Music] my personally Hey right a man let's give the Lord a hand the praise [Applause] a few years ago lost my actually my biological father passed in 30 days later later man that I I called daddy brother Roosevelt first my bad past my 30 days later but of the before daddy passed the one of things that I'll always cherish we were at the hospital and we were all as children surrounded around his band we each just some terrorists one from the other just speaking thanks of appreciation for our name with who God was calling home but we just took a turn why he is still here so you can still see us I took turns just said how much we appreciate just you know just a very very special moment and I'm wakeful that you know I've just had the opportunity they were sharing it with their siblings and I'll tell you what those of you that the half I was appreciate you find a gown and then appreciate why you gotta miss stuff but there's only bad you can only go to where they are but they can't come back to you but I'm so grateful that God gave me with that and I want to talk about you know have been a man that met on these and he took on more responsibility had to a man but he didn't they did it willfully and and you know what God me seeing what he do it helped me to do the things that I needed to do right but but him being the man that he was helped me become the man that I am and what you find out is that you actually set a bar for the next generation a man so you know I trust that you know and trying to be advantaged a man I'm a daddy in so many ways is not just some own children but like I said I'm the father to the church right but uh but I'm just trying to make sure I've set a good example a man for others to follow amen I wouldn't tell you to do something that I haven't already done a man so god bless you and then I love you I appreciate you and watch I'll find a father somewhere and say Happy Father's Day - praise the
