abide in thy tabernacle who shall dwell in thy holy heal he that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness and speaking the truth in his heart he that backbiteth not with his tomb nor doeth evil to his neighbor nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor in whose eyes a vile person is content but he honoreth them that fear the lord he that sweareth to his own heart changes not he that putteth not out of his money to he that put it not out his money to use usury nor taketh reward against the innocent he that doeth these things shall never be moved praise the lord let's bow our hearts

thank god for them um it's good to be back home as we were away on last weekend and we had a wonderful time there in tucson uh arizona we um went to a banquet on uh i guess it was friday night and you know i got all the way over there to tucson i thought i had everything that i needed and i went to go get dressed for the banquet and realize i have no dress shirts no whatsoever so i say lord i'm gonna be late to this banquet and um i went running out trying to find a little store to find something and and uh tucson's a huge city and uh so i just was all over town just trying to get a get a shirt and you know finally finally found a jcpenney or something like that and um you know just just amazing i think i went in there and it used to be jcpenney you'll find just about everything but i went there and they were about empty um and you know i was kind of shocked at that like man you know only like two or three shirts that you can pick from and you know just something's going on you know um i know that even when i went to the grocery store shells are empty i can't get nothing so uh you know i'm realizing we're going to come to this spoken word real soon and we have to use the power that's been given to us praise the lord but uh but we made it by the grace of god you know there and then on saturday night the concert which i thought was a very historic um event tucson is not the uh it's not the easiest city to have a church in let me just put it that way um a lot of division you know there brother branham talked about it when he was here he said you know desert conditions and everybody's like a cactus a sticker sticking each other right and uh so it's a little little different you know and um but nonetheless uh for that concert to take place there in that city and churches came together and supported it and made it what it was i thought it was very historic and just a wonderful wonderful uh uh you know just just event and i know that there were many comments that came back from it and you know i heard that they want to try to get the choir to colorado and uh overseas and people just trying to go everywhere and people you know sending me texts like tell this brother so and so i'm like i really don't know that brother i just came just like he came but it sounded like we had been together for a while you know and it's just a virtual you know thing that they did and i think it was um like i said just a real blessing and then on sunday morning i went to brother caleb durham they're an amazing grace tabernacle and we we had service there and uh just had a wonderful weekend so i bring greetings from the desert amen to to you uh to you all here and i got word that there are some from the desert that are looking to try to come here to florida they said they want the florida experience i hope y'all can create a florida experience amen but uh but we uh we're we're we're under expectation that god would just meet their needs amen when they come um i did want to say praise the lord for brother smiley appreciate amen his sermon on last uh last week [Music] you know i was there in my hotel room and just watching and you know uh before we went to service because um they're two hours behind out there so i'm just watching the services watching serving i'm sitting in my hotel room preach glory yes determination you know and uh and i would i was just i was just thoroughly enjoying myself and you know i think once it got released to uh youtube there were a number of people just making comments about the sermon so uh certainly god gave us a word amen on last week the lord gave us the word and i i was very very happy to hear that amen um praise the lord so i got a card here that i want to read it says uh thanks for doing and saying and being just what i needed uh church family thank you for jumping in and serving my family during these tough times your love support and prayers are greatly appreciated i love you all and i'm and i am happy to have all of you as my family uh thank you for everything that's from the coleman family uh sister tyranny coleman uh the pastor of her son and you know you all jumped in and just supported and did everything you could they appreciate it and i like the way she says that amen i'm happy to have all of you as my family amen i like i like the way that that is written because that's what we are amen that's what we all uh i had another little um text that i got this morning i want to sometimes things be happening so so much be happening and i don't get to everything and i do apologize uh but i'll try to get this one this morning sister irma um i know recently she had a situation where her son was in the hospital i believe he's getting better than sister irma herself was admitted to the hospital for some blockage that she was having and then she texted me this morning said thank you for the prayers uh um it says but my family still need god my grandson and i had now has kovic so she's just going through and he's four years old she said she'll be watching this morning so we we acknowledge that sister ehrman we will certainly have a word of prayer for your grandson um that god would just touch him as well uh as brother solomon said there's many that have lost their lives here recently we want to remember these families in prayer and um you know brother quentin was in an accident while he was away from us but god spared him and he's still with us so we thank god for that [Music] god is still a good god god is still a good god amen uh so let's uh let's just have a word of prayer for sister irma's grandson amen before we go forward father we just come before your presence and thank you that we have the opportunity to bring every request and every lead to you um god we prayed for uh sister irma's son while i was there in north carolina she called and um god you heard prayer over the telephone they were concerned about his heart and got just so much was going on with him there in the hospital but they were able to resolve the issue we thank you for that also with sister irma she ended up in the hospital got through all of this and god we we know that you have touched her and we pray that you continue to touch him and now our grandson with covet we rebuke it in the name of the lord jesus christ and in between covet and he as a patient we place the blood of the lord jesus and we believe god that you are his healer we claim it now in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen i heard a brother speak this week and he made a statement he was just driving down the street and said you know you know what kovitz stands for and he's talking to the church he said lord told me kovitz stand for christ overcomes virus infectious diseases [Music] so nothing for us to fear church amen um god is in control amen no matter what it is that we face god is in control and we thank god for that with thank god for that praise the lord so i think that's all that i needed to uh share i am gonna get myself out of the way um whether quaker is gonna come and speak for us amen on this morning and he recently had the opportunity to go into south america and anytime i see the brothers from our church going out it just blesses my heart it blesses my heart this is what this is what ministry is all about it's one thing what we do here amen uh in this place uh but it's a whole nother thing what we do when we go outside and uh and i just i just appreciate seeing the handle lord so he i told him just please come and just share a thought you know that god might have placed his heart but also take time to share uh just give us an update as to what happened there uh he sent some pictures back and i think he'll have something to show you today but uh i want you to understand that when we give towards mission offering and we give towards our tithe and offering uh these are the things that help us to send the brothers out you know and and they go with the

you musicians thank the lord for his goodness and mercy you may take your seat please the lord is good unto us and as brother jack said the lord gave us the opportunity to go to uh i went to south america actually central america colombia uh bogota and uh fusa suga quite quite a mouthful names but each of them have some significance so i want us to look at the powerpoint slice and just give a brief report of what transpired in bogota fusaka suga colombia i went to the host pastor was brother gabriel and the lord did some wonderful things but jerry god bless you but the jedi gave me a right and we went through some things i think i was supposed to go on the 21st of december but then my covey text that i took on a sunday wasn't ready in fact i went and came back and the kobe test wasn't still ready so we had to drive around we left around by i think seven were underway called the place for the test it wasn't ready they were not even at work so we caught them after eight and they gave me the number of the lab to cut the lab i called the lab and they told me that don't put your trust in it it wasn't going to be ready because there's a sage of covid in the u.s so they had a bunch of tests and mine wasn't those who did their tests on sunday i shouldn't even expect the test to be ready uh even on the next day and the covetous should be ready within 72 hours so i went to the airport to inform them and they said well there's there's a test here rapid test which is if you want to pay 160 dollars go do it so i went to do it and i was supposed to be ready in within 20 minutes it wasn't ready within an hour so i had to reschedule the flight to 23rd and i had to do transit because there was no flight direct from fort lauderdale to um to bogota the capital i could either go through and what's the name of the place orlando and sleep over for 12 hours and i said it's not worth it so we arranged to go through another city called kali and from fort lauderdale to cali then kali to bogota so that was on the 23rd but the lord had a purpose because but we planned he planned to take me to other cities elsewhere to preach but the lord had a soul riding bogota that he wanted his word to touch amen the lord knows how to touch each and every one of you and there's a testimony that i believe it through my heart for the lord to bring an atheist to receive the lord and to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and that was so the lord could cause the pla was about abraham uh the flight to deliver for abraham to pray for a a colored woman in a forgotten alabama somewhere for for the son who was dying so they call can the mississippi thank you the lord can do whatever changes he need to make to reach to a single person a seed a prison a protested son or daughter of god amen the the slightest this is the out view of a sunset in is this yeah sunset um fusaka suga and fusa gazuga means um a woman who is hidden and is invincible and bogota means a planted field so i will use it part of the same one so that was it then the second slide is the friday i arrived on the thursday i think so and then we drove to but um brother gabriel picked me and we went to that was bogota we had a home service in bogota that night and that was when i came across i came in contact with one brother alejandra and his wife sister louisa and their story i'll talk more about it later on so the friday we had a sorry this thursday night we had a home service and then about 1am and then we drove two three hours to fusaka suga and i already know slept for about two days so we drove all the way to to uh for the garciages where we go stationed we had some sleep and the night was brother gabriel's parents-in-law's 50th wedding anniversary so he asked me to preach so i preach on the purpose of marriage let's go to this yeah there's a slide uh this slide two show me slide two please yes this is uh his father and lord mother-in-law brother uh le liman and his wife's i think rosita or blanket or something like that and the children three daughters and three sons and grandchildren great-grandchildren and so forth so that was a wonderful time we had a wonderful time speaking at a 58 wedding anniversary so let's go to the next slide yeah so i had a chance to take a picture with them with a couple and they are wonderful so the saturday we started that was the christmas day itself we spent a christmas giving food to um people in town just like the food pantry we do here but this is different there you have to go and look for the people that you want to give food and pray for so you go to traffic lights downtown in front of stores and colombia has a lot of immigrants from um venezuela because of crisis political and economic crisis in venezuela so we have they have a lot of them there so they have a bunch of a lot of people community that they give food to and they go and buy the food from another set of believers who prepare it's like they call it tamales it's like tamales the regular one but they use plantain leaf and then they add rice corn vegetables and it's the amanda i'm sorry they add meats and they give it to them so so we went and our they have it they put on their t-shirts they call it our the lost not our community table that was a blue shirt that we we we had on so we went and asked gabriel what did we do he said you just go and the lord will take care i said i thought you should leave he said oh you go i'm going to record and you you are going to be the main person as a really so we divide ourselves into two group groups his father-in-law parents-in-law and his wife and the rest went to another place and my brother gabriel myself and his brother-in-law we went to downtown so we started giving giving out food and the people want praise from addiction from different things and it turned out to be a prayer line i was surprised about six people lining up in downtown i mean waiting for prayers you pray for this person the next person come somewhere as young as 14 year old uh girls or young ladies and 16 year old young boy they wanted prayer and they were asking where's your church but then but gabriel doesn't have a big church he rented a place they call it mountains i'll show you the pictures where they they gather once in a while but then he he transmitted a savage from home because the people are some are different places in bogota and it doesn't have a big church so we do what you call catch and release like you catch a fish and you turn the face back in the river and i said but the gabriel you can't be doing this i mean people want to go to church they want their word their hearts are so warm for the word of the lord they want to receive their word you give the word to them and they just i mean receive it just like that receive the word they want to they want christ and there was no church so we we just pray for them and we just say let the lord take care of them so we had and i said gabriel i'm going to pray for you that the lord will bless you there a place that you can i come on the account of the people so we had um let's see go to the next slide please okay good thank you yeah this is a family a young lady and a children that we prayed for on the streets and they wanted to go to church but we don't have a chat so sometimes it gives them the website address but you know new people is much better if you have a place to accommodate them the next slide yeah this is um friday night after we finished no that was saturday yeah saturday evening we went to where the fellowship this actually is supposed to be the church as a two-story building bamboo there's a bamboo structure so they have a place they call it a mountain and what he uses it for is to seek those who want to see the baptism of the holy spirit uh he's about to quickly sometimes we baptize the people they come to receive the word of the lord we baptize them and then that's okay we think everything is okay but we don't help them or lead them to receive the holy ghost or we don't preach the holy ghost the significance of the holy ghost enough to them so what he does is this they call it the mountains it's sunny by a mountain and if you want to go and stay there for whenever you want to pray and seek for the holy ghost you can do that or if you want him to go with you with his wife they go there they have place that you can lodge the the the upstairs and the downstairs and you can study for whenever you want and you pray and pray and pray and pray to you and the almighty your creator are sure that you have the creator in you you have got the holy ghost baptism and i said that is very laudable so that is um let me see when is the next one yeah this is after i preached on the sunday that was sunday uh photo we preached at the place the mountains and after he asked me to give testimonies and that is when the lord began to deal with certain hearts so i preach and on redemption in two parts and after that i ask you to give testimony you play guitar go and rest a little bit and then we come back and we pray we pray sorry yeah we pray and then give testimonies and there was one lady louisa and her sister-in-law the husband's um sister is called a yuya they were crying all the time sharing tears of repentance and i didn't know exactly what they were going through so they cried for hours we prayed and we give testimonies we prayed you know thomas because this was christmas time nobody's going to work so we had probably spent about four or five hours after the service praying and and giving testimonies and answering questions and so on and so forth so one of the one of them were really two of not one of them one family was touched one brother is called a brother some samwell i think his picture is somewhere he's when one of the blue but somewhere was but of gabriel's first convert when he received a message he was baptized in the name of the lord 18 years ago and his son is alejandra who was an atheist he was smart he was a college professor i think a chemistry and he's received award from the president of colombia he has awards from argentina he does research in was the name of uh renault renewable energy and he's so smart so he he had nothing to do with it he didn't believe his mecca existed you know an atheist it is those who don't believe god existed you know they came from i don't know wherever they came from proteins and organic soup and i don't know monkeys or whatever so that is it is believed so this guy was a young man 44 years old and very very intellectually smart so i think the parents came from a catholic background and then his father received a message and his mom received a message but he had nothing to do with religion well so i think about a month ago before i went the the wife and and uh the young man asked brother gabriel to come and visit them it looks like they have some issues and he prayed for them and so when i went we first met in bogota we talked about job and different things we didn't talk too much about we didn't i mean i didn't i thought he was a believer so we just talked about what do i what do you do what do you do we just conversate on that then the sunday is when the lord was dealing with the wife the wife was crying and he asked me to pray for the husband on something so we prayed and the monday they came to where i was staying and we ministered to them again and then they slept over and we kept the tuesday the wife and the sister were still and the house brother-in-law they were just in tears and crying and crying and you could see the lord was dealing with them so but i gave it to you and it looks like they want to be baptized in the name of the lord and i said okay is i keep praying for them but he has to go to work the next day he's a professor and he's very busy he has to go back to bogota but he's taking decision with his wife as to whether to stay and then we go baptize them on wednesday so keep praying for them so we kept praying and they decided not to go to work but they want to be baptized in the name of the lord so on the wednesday we went to their family home and fellowship and we took time to go into uh why we baptized in the name of the lord we went to scriptures from from old testament new testament and we give them various examples in book of acts uh where uh disciples the day of pentecost peter was commissioned and that repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you receive the gift of the holy ghost so we went through so many scriptures in ephesians and acts cornelius and different ones paul was baptized in the name of the lord so we give all those fundamental bases or doctrines of baptism in the name of the lord and then we went to see if we could baptize them in a pond they they have beautiful structures in colombia our shirt some of their burdens is way beyond what we can imagine here and i said wow you people are rich and bogota as well they have a lot of skyscrapers all over in bogota and they have new apartment where but brother gabriel lives looks like a new city that is being constructed and said but gabriel is it a new cities they know i was raised up here when i was young the road was stunning they had a stony road that was bought by the indians they have native indians in colombia but then construction began and the whole place is different they have everywhere new new building developing everywhere so we went to one of the swimming pool to see if we could baptize them but they said they refused because people were swimming so we have to go to the woods to go and look for navigate go and look for a place to baptize so we went and let me see go back to i think the previous pictures yes this is the next one yes this is brad alejandro and his wife louisa and their son nicolas so that was on our way to to to the baptism to the river so we went to the river and we were looking for there were a lot of we couldn't have a place which was deep enough to baptize we're looking for like an hour because they were so shallow the river was shallow this it wasn't every but it was actually like a stream and people were there tourists a lot of colombians who live in the u.s here they were there somewhere doing they're having fun barbecue and different things so we went to and we couldn't get enough place which was at least deep enough to baptize them so i was having a stick go to the next one i had some stick trying to find out where it's deep enough because there were a lot of stones and uh but gabriel and i were doing that and he got himself baptized first he stopped over and he he ran in the river and he said brother gabriel you believe your you believe your your dog training so you want to leave by the example you just had some people he just drowned in his money and his paperwork were all wet so we pull him out and then we baptize alejandro at that place and this is the team his father-in-law is singing songs and alejandro's appearance i think they were on the other side they were not in the pictures so whilst we were baptizing three men came around they were one of them actually lives right in west palm beach here uh military and one of the road so i share the word of the lord with them i think they have not even seen somebody baptizing they got to know sister carolina by gabriel's wife's auntie so they came around and said what are you guys doing here and they said we brought somebody to baptize what is that so i gave them what is baptism they were not acquainted with the bible and i asked them what did they do and the guy said he said he's a medi he meditate he's not a christian so i gave the word to them and his two brothers they receive it and say well sometimes you just all you need is to plant the lord has the harvest time so you just don't worry about if the rest the lord will take care you plant and so the lord will send somebody to do the harvesting so we sow the seed with them and we had a wonderful time with them and there was a dog this dog came right where a black dog came in he baptized himself he came and just got himself baptized and left and came to observe and i said the lord that's miracles a dog came to baptize himself was it in the bible somewhere was it a is that if you won't give what is that the lord can raise children out of i forgot the scriptures stones right to give glory to god something like that to be so the lord can use animals even for a symbol so the animal the dog got himself baptized and i think he's got a seed of presentation so that was uh that was the baptist oh i think i missed some of the pictures when we were praying for the the street okay let's keep going so this is what it looks like the whole purpose of me going was this a gentleman and his wife so after he was baptized he gave me one of the biggest hacks glory and god bless you brother jerry but jerry and i had a right on that day but jerry is so he wasn't protected at all because i was already had to go to work and was driving around we tried to stop and call the that was the first day i went 21st and i called the covet people to find out if my test was ready and the test wasn't ready the police would come hey leave before we give you tickets and but the jerry would drive around and come back to the same spot and bridget was as calm as cam could be he wasn't moved i said i was worried a little bit for his work and he said no i've called my boss i'm fine and he was so so i mean the lord put gifting people god bless you by the jerry and [Applause] all the toys we were going through was for this gentleman and his wife because the lord wanted to cut part of the trip that was planned off so that we could concentrate on this guy because if i had to go to other places he wouldn't have spent enough time there i mean to be able to maybe connect with this guy how the lord wanted us to connect so the lord sometimes when something is going on you might think it's the devil yes the lord allowed the devil to do it allow satan but he's for to accomplish the purpose of the lord amen and and i let me finish before i get into preaching praise god hallelujah so we finished with him and we came back and it was just it's like mission accomplished his wife uh louisa sister louisa also got baptized and they were the parents were so so happy yeah this let me see let me shoot if you can show me this picture do you see it okay let me let me show it to you oh they got it thank you god bless you go back please i think it was the lord touched um brother alejandro's sisters to julia she was she was she has been baptized already by by the gabriel in the name of the lord but then they went with a husband they went to be baptized yes sister zuzia she went back and said i've been baptized like four times i went back to the indonesian church and they told me that no i was wrong to be baptized in the name of the lord i needed to be baptized in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost so i went back to baptize the name of the lord and i had already been baptized i think in catholic and i've been baptized somewhere else so she's going to say what do i do she was crying and i said well i think probably what you need is the holy ghost baptism but if you want to baptize again but a giver can baptize you so a sister juja and her husband is also called alejandro they all have five-year-old sons and they were crying for hours and sister brother alejandro's wife and a sister-in-law the lord was just dealing with them and they just pouring their heart out and they just they have been also being very supportive with their food pantry they call it a our community table and so we went on so yeah so you can go on to to let me see today where we were before so that was the baptism we finished the baptism then we baptized them and then we came back to bogota that was on the the day before december 30th i think that was i don't remember the day but we came back to bogota and we had another service in bogota this is one brother brother hugo and his wife's sister claudia their home is where but uh gabriel did have fellowship in bogota and bogota is planted filled and the lord touched some family one this young man and his wife and family they were attached they were a christian their brother was telling me that but gabriel was telling that his brother has a ministry but he hasn't given his life fully to the wet so we should pray for him and the lord dealt with them and like i said sometimes all you need to do is sow the plantain will come in its own time so that was um a bits about bogota just a snapshot about bogota and colombia so god bless you for all the contribution and the blessing and the prayers the lord touch and transform an atheist who doesn't even believe that there's an existence of a greater power parents were missing believers is your son or daughter an atheist if the lord could transform an atheist the lord can do for your son your children your parents your your spouse [Applause] if the lord can take the intellectual from an atheist and humble him to receive jesus christ in his heart and his wife used to be a staunch catholic they are all now baptized not just baptized but they have received their love with all of their hearts so let's pray for them that the lord will fill them with the holy ghost and they have a mountain they place the cod mountain where they go and pray to seek the baptism of the holy spirit and so so let's come back to uh the same one and see if you can share something a little about redemption in two parts amen i think the lord is good praise god hallelujah amen there's nothing the lord can do for you there's nothing and no matter how your loved one has gone he's still in the palms of god's hands they've not gone nowhere he can be an atheist he can be wherever he might be he might go as as as away as you can be let them go wherever they want in sin in the deepest of hell there was a david is it even there you are there with me amen let them sink in the deepest talk about whatever sin you can think about the seed of representation which is christ is in them and they see they can run but they see do not run away from them amen in in uh there's something you cannot sink a seed of god they said we'll be still calling out to you adam where are thou my son where are thou my daughter where are thou and that voice that voice becomes stronger and stronger and to get to a place that they can resist that voice and that voice will bring them back to where they belong to amen the lord can let you go through as a parent as as a spouse as an uncle as a brother as a pastor as a minister you can go through a lot amen just for the sake of one person one family one one child one daughter the lord can let you suffer and go to trials they'll wreck your heart yes you're a human being even jesus on a cross he cried amen but the seed will never leave them amen they can't even blaspheme themselves out it's impossible because they were part of eternity and they are part of eternity and they are eternally part of eternity amen so a seed of god can never be lost it's impossible amen so you believe as the prophet said that he said you apply the talking and believe the same way you believe for your salvation the lord brought you from wherever you came from brought me for wherever i came from to be where you are now believe for your loved one and just put the token on them and disregard what they are doing amen they are just going through the process they are going to the the contrast of redemption so that when the lord bring them out they can look back and see oh my where was i and they can have a priest to give unto the living god amen so all is well amen our loved ones they are here already amen they are in heaven not that they are going to be in heaven they are in heaven they are in church they are they are in the in their positions in christ amen glory hallelujah there's nothing out of keta everything is right online right in time the lord is working right on time he's never too least amen lazarus was dead for this but it wasn't it wasn't late he came right on time his time is his time amen and his time is our time amen so in his time you bring them from wherever let it let them let them do whatever they can go to sleep with their pigs they can eat with their pigs yes the seed of representation the pillow fire in their heart will put them right to where they belong to a man because because they are god's children glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ amen glory hallelujah if the lord transformed alejandro from being an atheist somebody who has even brought gabriel was telling me said he's in some organization the government some gorilla organization he's really on top there and getting awards from president and his i think grandfather great grandfather one of her grandparents was a previous president of mexico colombia and the lord brought them out to receive to be humbled not to be baptized in a pool no to baptize in the stream dirty stream in the name of the lord jesus christ what can the lord do for you and i amen so the lord has a purpose for everything amen so the school room experience is just a transitional experience amen we are passing here for purpose to both character to build a temple but the real promise is there amen glory hallelujah so let's look at our ceremony and redemption in two parts let's go to our same one let's go to the next slide redemption is um calling out as the prophet preached to us calling out and then entering in so you have to be you have to be called out the mail does the calling the mail is christ the mail is the messengers the mail is a ministry the evangelist the prophet the pastors the apostles uh the teachers they are the male form of christ and they do their calling amen and their male could be you it could be their mother it could be their daughter it could be their wife it's the seed it's not a physical female but the seed of god calling a seed of god deep calling for the deep so the male is the calling and the female response amen so the males that are calling come out my daughter come out my son and be no be partakers of their sin and then you have to make a choice that is the female respond that yes i do and then you march on to enter into christ to receive the holy ghost baptism amen blessed be the name of the lord so i have a bunch of let's go to write so that is the that is we have types in the bibles we can use moses moses was picked from from the water that was calling out coming out from from the water and then joshua was entering into the promised land he apportioned the land for them in kinderland and we can we go to some scriptures so egypt is a type of calling out and canaan is the promised land egypt is a world and canaan is the holy ghost baptism and then when you are called out you have to go through seven church ages you have to build you have to destroy and build you have to destroy the old nature the pillar of fire has to destroy the old nature and christ has to come in amen before you have to pass through river jordan and then go to canaan land amen in 1933 a prophet god sent a prophet with abraham the lord called him out of his bapti baptist denomination and then through him he called the people from baptism in the name of titles and dead dead names to baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ so that was a river and then he entered into the pillow fire on mount sunset in 1963 to receive the seven seals but then between then we can talk about the church ages we know the church changes from paul to abraham but then in brahms ministry we can talk about seven churches ministry in 1960 sorry 1956 the church ages came to an end the lord closed the churches he said america has got his last calling and the lord gave america to himself or herself so 56 up to 63 when the services were revealed was seven years so it's a type of another church ages that this judge went through amen so 1983 was coming out of water water means multitude of people and then entering to the cloud of witness on sunset mountain amen the cloud is not just a cloud but it's few funnies it's pillar of christ and all his eternal attributes adam and all the sons and daughters of god from adam to the last one even those who were not born they were there amen glory hallelujah we don't have time but if you go to the bible revelation when john um on the island of patmos when he cried for redemption there was no redemption and john was crying and a voice said don't cry that was uh the lamp john the lamp is what uh is worthy to the lamp of god is is overcome and prevail the land of trouble of judah and he said who that was william brahm the seventh angel before he dropped on earth john wanted to worship the seven angel but he said don't worship me i'm just one of you one of the messengers worship the lord jesus christ amen so before even you dropped here you had a manifestation in the on the antenna in eternal dimension amen so you went you existed before the financial world and you exist what you are going through a sinner going through drinking is just going through the shadow but he already was safe before the foundation of the world amen glory hallelujah so let's go to some scriptures that talk about the calling in hosea chapter 1 verse 1 calling us out of the world out of egypt into christ i think it's the second and second slide slide two is it when israel was a child then i left him and i called my son out of egypt so the calling of the lord is out of love calling you from the world from sin sin is satan in your nature the old breath and then giving you the new breath through his love amen now if you go to revelation 18 in the same voice christ come out out of them and be not be partakers of their sins and receive not of a place the judgment that is ongoing second corinthians 6 6 16 to 17 is also calling these people out is a what agreement the lord is creating now a contrast that there's no agreement between you and and and the world come out and i will walk in you and i'll be a god and they shall be my people so the lord is calling us to be his people he said wherefore come out of among them and be separate so the calling calls for separation separation from the old life and then be united into the light with the life of christ amen glory hallelujah 18 and said i will be a father unto you and it shall be my sons and daughters says the lord almighty verse uh sorry ephesians 2 14 for he is our peace who he who is he christ timber jack has been on that series for pieces what a person a person of who jesus christ and he's you amen glory hallelujah he has made both one broken down the middle wall of partition glory hallelujah because you have to come up from chaos and then go into peace if you read joshua chapter one verse one to eight that was the lord calling joshua after the death of moses now the calling is over you have to now go entry and enter in into and enter into the promised land to inherit your promises what promises the law talking about it is the holy ghost baptism for the individual and for the church amen if you are here and you are not sure that you have got christ in you today is your day amen if you are not sure that you have christ thank you jesus the pill of fire in your heart that there's another being beside a human being sitting down then today is the day amen then you have to go to uh the mountain to seek the lord the mountain is in your heart amen because we came to to this world individually even if you were born twins one came first and the other came you have to seek the lord for yourself and when you seek him with all of your heart you will find him amen so don't be happy don't be uh don't be what's the word i'm trying to use don't be uh i don't remember but don't be satisfied if you don't have the holy ghost if you're just a church member if you just come to church because when you're in church the anointing of the pastor is your father spiritual father he's your spiritual husband anointing of the brothers who hover around you it will protect you but when you are by yourself when christ is not here then the old person and his wits will come out so baptism means baptism is a greek word means to die to be buried the old person has to die be consumed by the lake of fire by the pillar of fire by the word by jesus christ then the seed that has been there eternally does he take a boat of your house of your house renovate and cleanse you and then he dwells in you and he becomes your husband and your kin amen and then you have peace in yourself people who don't have the holy ghost they don't have peace that's right you can have all the world alejandra was popular he had awards from presidents go to argentina to receive awards but there was something lacking he wasn't he was an atheist but he knew there was a maker amen at a death point when you are dying your pastor cannot take your place for you your mother cannot take your place your husband cannot take your place your wife cannot take your place you and your maker alone and that's why you have to settle the same question sin is not necessary means drinking smoking those are the attributes sin means unbelief satan in your nature you need to get rid of that nature the old nature and then christ the new nature take a hold of your heart and then he becomes your life amen so you have to ask yourself take self-inventory in your life and ask yourself that do i cocoo or hindu affair do i have christ in me if i should drop dead on the puppet now am i ready to go is the question you every individual that's why we come here amen we come we don't come here to show our dresses we don't come here to see one another but we come here to make sure that if it's time for me to transition i'm ready to transition because death is not a respectable person that's that doesn't respect whether you are old you are young you are a baby you just drop from the womb death can take you when it has to take you there was a man there was a story in brazil that there was a person that was assigned to die at a certain time and the guy decided you know what i'm going to there was a death angel to come and pick him up he said i'm going to do something i'm not going to let the death angel pick me up so he changed the color of his hair and then he left his home and there was like a lot of celebration in town so he went to town and the death angel came to his house he wasn't there and he went around looking through the city looking through for this guy couldn't get him and he saw a guy with a weird hair color and say you know what i need to take somebody today he just took him he couldn't hide from death there's a story of a forgotten story i think macbeth old literature that one of the kings did something evil i think it's like erica knows that story and the king was assigned that a tree is going to fall on him to die he said that's the case i'm not going to die i'm going to i will never go to the woods to begin with i'm going to get my uh subject to cut all the trees around my house so they even they'd even have flowers they cut every tree he said then i won't die because there's no truth to fall on me one day he was lying on his bed and the wood one of the a wood furniture wood that was used in the ceiling fell on him and he died when it's time to go glory you're gonna go whether you like it or not so you have to don't let this work well take you over don't let the fanciful life take you over don't let america take you over the laodicean spirit in america in all the nations is the same spirit ladies yeah it works in different countries in different ways don't let that spirit take you over but let jesus christ take over your heart amen because when you're on your deathbed it's you and your maker and whether you are ready or not if death calls upon you and i you gotta go amen so the only thing you can do is now that you have life you have blood i mean circulating in your body give your heart all to the lord amen repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and be married to the kingdom of life and if you have life death you'll not be afraid of death but i'm talking about the story of um a man i think california a since that was dying and his brother they were sin their brother was sad and they called his brother luke he said look come on we've served the lord and why sing me this song read me the scriptures don't be sad don't today's the best day of my life i see the lord coming for me he said don't be sad and he changed the situation of his brother amen the death of a sins is joyful amen of course we are humans we have got emotions loved ones but it's a joy he's meeting the lord jesus christ angels pillow fires around amen the host of angel when a son and or a daughter of god is going to glory maybe you may not see you around my nose but he sees the lord jesus christ coming for him or her and angels and through funnies and his loved ones that have gone on coming to embrace and hugging him that is the death of a sin but the death of a sinner is a horrible one you can i'm not ready to go demons will torment you and so the lord gives you the opportunity that this day if you hear his voice harden up your heart amen so today is a calling out for somebody the lord wants to give you a millennium he want to give you liberty from sin and unbelief from all the works of the devil all the toils of life that doesn't benefit you isaiah 55 say come on to me come and drink rivers of life without money without price buy free of charge and drink that you'll soon be satisfied why do you drink waters that doesn't satisfy you why do you move around people that make you sad while trying to please a person instead of pleasing the lord jesus christ glory hallelujah so joshua chapter let's read joshua chapter 11 verse 23 if you can put that scripture for me praise god hallelujah yeah can you pull it up for me if you can um okay good he said joshua to the whole took so joshua took the whole land according to all that the lord has said unto moses and joshua gave it for an inheritance unto israel according to their divisions by their tribes and the land rested from war they didn't have to fight the jebusite and the canaanites and the amalekites because what the land joshua means jehovah salvation the holy ghost will give you your place your heavenly places in christ jesus and you don't have to fight the world anymore amen because your battles will be done by the lord himself when you are sleeping and snoring there's an angel of the lord guarding you amen when you are walking in the rough route the lord is guiding you amen you might not see him physically by seeing you and is around you amen when a circumstance arises he can come from within you and make himself plain to you like he did unto joshua glory hallelujah and the lord gives millennium let's go to proverbs 9 1 to 11. that is the transition that is where probably most of the how dwell i'll dwell on that that in scripture said proverbs 1 1-11 is wisdom and wisdom is who a person have builded her house she she's a female she had healed out her seven pillars what are the seven pillars the seven church ages she had killed her beast the lord her husband gave her the materials to build a house he gave us seven pillars he gave a justification he gave a uh paul to abraham amen those were the seven pillars that we blow the seven changes upon she had killed her beast and we're going to the beast the beast means what power power of self and influence we live in a world of i i me and my own we have sophie right it's all about you it's about me you are so important so risen up so high but that's like just like a bubble it's like a balloon you have to let it burst by the pillow of fire and he'll give you a real position in christ he said she has killed a beast so you have to kill the beast of pride and all the evil i don't want to go into it every beast you know your beast amen she had mingled her wine what is wine revelation mingling means putting the revelation to action taking the vehicle from the storehouse from the garage and put it on the road so when you mingle your revelation with action with something which is a real time putting into use that is mingling the wine she had finished her table what is the table your heart prepare your heart for the lord to dwell in because the lord wants to dwell in your heart the almighty doesn't dwell in these bricks and mortar he dwells in human hearts amen she had sent forth her maidens what is the maidens the virtues we are women the church is the woman the lord has given us seven virtues many virtues in fact more than seven your faith your patient your temperance your love your kindness even your smile can change somebody's life god has put a demeanor around you a nature amen brother brother jax smile can can just let you know that he's just not a human being amen he doesn't have to preach with someone to know who he is but a smile can let you know that there's some somebody behind a smile amen glory hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord is that she had cried upon the high places of the city calling the loved ones calling others to come in city is a person who so is simple let him turn in either as for him that wanted understanding she said to him come eat of my bread the bread is the word of the lord and drink of the wine the revelation which i i have mingled foresee the foolish and live and go in the way of understanding he that reproveth as corner gathereth to himself ashamed and he that rebuketh a wicked man gathered himself a blood reproved not as conor les lest he hate thee rebook a wise man and he will love thee glory give instruction to a wise man and he'll be yet wiser teach a just man and he will increase in learning the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom if you want to fear the lord if you want to have wisdom then fear the lord if you want to become message jesus christ the first is to fear the lord know that you have a maker let your pride go away and let the lord come into your heart and commit your heart to him feel the lord doesn't mean like run away being scared of god but giving your heart to the lord that is the fear of the lord and the knowledge of the holy one holy is understanding for by me thy days shall be multiplied and the years of their life shall be increased it doesn't even necessarily mean living up to two thousand years somebody can live 20 40 60 years and his life is worth living someone can live 111 and there's no his life is not worth it because that life didn't serve eternal purpose eternity means what living for others life worth living is living for christ and living for people amen giving your heart to the lord glory hallelujah now let's look at the beast let's go to the next slide killing of abyss there's a jaguar we all know jaguar came from the world jaguar jaguar is a beast that can pounce on you and kills its prey in one leap or nip and blow and like moses serpent when moses went to the palace of um pharaoh they had a lot of powers beasts and they talked they had magicians but the serpent of moses swallowed all the serpent of the magician your revelation that the lord has given to you can swallow every problem in every situation amen because our lord is what a consuming fire he consumes situations he consumes problems regardless of what so jaguar is christ that leap upon any situation and redeem his children amen you see the vehicle jaguar the natura is a type of of the spiritual glory hallelujah and the beast we also is we are jaguar or jaguar you take one eternal decision for the lord wow the people that you see here the garden you see here was based on somebody's one decision amen someone was called to save the lord someone was a song leader someone was a i.t a i.t man if i'm right computer guru but he had a voice that told him to give himself to be a minister to be a pastor he had a choice he could have said no he could have said you know what my job is more important to to to this calling but he gave his heart to the lord one eternal decision has created this brother jacked off god bless you brother jack but i smiley amen god bless you another brother jerry amen or the brother troy or the minister solomon all the sisters amen just a burst i think the song that she sing and sister michelle it just ran into my message glory hallelujah that's why you couldn't change your song amen maybe maybe i'll get there glory hallelujah the lord has the purpose for that song amen i think michelle sangon rest on gas promises that is a bogota the filled planted food of god blessed are they that are planted by the lord is it someone a tree that is planted by the rivers of water and it shall not be moved it will yield its fruit in season amen when you are planted on the promise of the lord nothing can move you situations will arise but they will not move you an inch amen you still stand strong for the lord and you know you already overcome there could be situation all around you you are surrounded but you are surrounded you could be surrounded by situation but the host of angels are surrounding you amen just glory hallelujah to the lord because you have jaguar in you who can kill the situation in just one neighbor amen when his time he just jump comes over and change situation that's jaguar amen glory and you are jaguar amen you are the jaguar glory hallelujah blessed be the name of you are that power you know how the jack the vehicle jack you know it's one of the outstanding vehicles very strong built and awesome and the natura is the type of the spiritual the horsepower and you are that horsepower we are more than horsepower amen glory hallelujah let's go to the next slide please now the lord brings the messengers now we are we are in the proverbs chapter 9 this woman that was building a house he's giving the furniture the blocks the bricks and woods and whatever he needs she needs to build a house like brother gabriel was telling me he said one of the brother alejandro's his brother-in-law is working in a factory where they make uh they use bricks like you want to go to uk they use smoked bricks to buy their house he said brother gabriel whenever you're ready i can supply with all the bricks free of charge you need the land the foundation of the pyramid and the capstone of the pyramid but when it breaks the savannah changes i'm going to supply it to you amen and it's the natural type of spiritual the lord has given us everything that we need to build a house we have to construct so the message is this is this the sign of the end remember 271 it said remember paul come at the end of the age all the messengers come at the end of the age it's at the end time when these things are brought forth the lord waited when the church edges were open he let the church build itself goes on in whatever then at the end of the age the lord sent the messenger and the messenger come and what cup the age call those who are of the lord they hear the voice of the lord and they come up from among the denomination and then they receive the holy ghost and they are sealed unto redemption and a judgment fall upon their own believers and the church is raptured to glory and another age church arise amen let's go to the next one please [Music] he said for this course i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he will grant you according to the to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that he being rooted and grounded in love amen that is the essence of the calling the lord is not just calling you but he wants to ground you in his life and his faith amen so redemption is two parts one part is what coming out being caught up from the world but that's not the ultimate that's just a transition the next space is entering in that you will be named because before the foundation of the world you were part of the family of christ so you have to be said named you have to have a family name just like when a woman marries her name changes there's a new leadership amen there's a new husband there's a new lord and now you have to that lord the lord jesus christ becomes your husband and then he put his name his life name is identity name is a nature name is a commission name is what your allotment your inheritance and it gives you a heavenly inheritance and he will give you the riches of heaven his love and faith and everything that is in him is you is you is yours amen if a man really truly loves his wife if you want to make a world right that if something should happen and pass away who should who do you want to be quite your properties to your wife and your children you don't give it to your fiance your girlfriend no you don't give it to your your what do you call it a forgotten mistress thank you that's the word i was looking for you don't give it a mistress unless maybe you hit your wife you want to punish your family and then you alert it to your mistress some people do it because there's some problems i don't want to there was one one star tv star who did he allotted his properties to to to to the mysteries at least some for the children do but the one who loves the wife who give everything to their wife amen and that's what our lord jesus christ is giving everything to the church every power that was in jesus christ of nazareth is in you amen and when that power needs to be manifested it comes to manifestation if it's gift of speaking in tongues if it's a healing the dead that power is in you amen it's all yours and you use it when it becomes necessary it's not for a show off no god doesn't use his pathway show off but when there's an a necessity it's important there's an essence to use that power you don't know how it comes it just manifests itself just like that if you have to call the dead from the grief if you have to call the dead if you have to call whatever you can do it amen because that power of creation is in you the power to speak into creation and to speak out of creation you speak the positives of christ into creation and speak sickness speak a corner virus hiv death cancer and all those demonic spirits you speak them out of creation amen that power is in you and i because jaguar your husband the lord jesus christ has become you so you are the jaguar amen glory hallelujah let's go to the next slide now baptism baptism is the transition when the lord called israel from egypt to go to the promised land they have to they have to be baptized in the red sea what is the rest see is the baptism of fire and burning that's where you have to lay down your old life you have to willingly let the lord that this material cannot go to the a chamber when when enoch brought the pyramid of egypt he didn't use bricks and mortars after now scientists don't know how those uh ganganite pyramid was built in egypt because it wasn't built by a human masonry it was spoken into creation enoch was a prophet of the lord and he was supposed to go into the rapture he was i think his grandson or great-grandson was um noah so enoch had to leave a symbol of justification and the lord commissioned enoch to speak the pyramid of giza into existence and he spoke into creation and then all they don't during the flood of noah that permit stood the test of time the promise wasn't broken because it was the spoken word of the lord as a symbol that the lord has justified the earth and the lord was only uh purging the earth the lord was not destroying the earth the same thing when you have the baptism of fire and burning it doesn't consume your human flesh but the professor that even the atoms of your body is rearranged the lord rearrange you take diseases take cases from your life and bring the holy spirit into your life amen glory so the lord has given us material to kill the beast the holy ghost baptism and then he's giving us the pillars the materials to build our seven church ages glory hallelujah because the seventh church is the character that leads to the a.d that is the king's chain but that king is not in the seventh churches anymore the king is in the day all right we are not in the night time anymore i'm preaching the same one it is the rise of the sun the night time is over that's when we're building character amen but now the morning is when life is being portrayed it's just like a man plant his life in the in the womb of his wife in the night time then they won't get pregnant then the child is born and everybody to see the child that has been born and there's a time that the man child the woman child has been born on earth amen so the night time is over but we are in the morning it is the rise of the sun good morning mrs jesus christ amen glory hallelujah let's go to the next slide please just to save some time yes we are the planting of the lord bogota i think uh that was uh the planted field that's sister birth sang that song for me god bless you my dear sister that's why you couldn't run away from that song bogota means planted fields and in the in the old civilization when the spanish people went to invade central america south america in 1538 they called it bakata in the native language they called them muskaya muskas they call them bakata which modern de bogota means planted field sometime when i travel i found out the meaning of the places because many times where you are going what is going on has connotation to what the lord is doing spiritually so i found out what is the meaning of bogota what's the meaning of this and it means planted field if you read some one verse three i think i didn't put that one on the slide someone verse 3 said i said talking about a man that gave his heart to the lord he said he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that brings forth his seasoning his fruits in his season his leaves shall not weather and whatsoever he died this morning glory hallelujah and sister michelle sung millennium for us the race and isaiah also i mean uh allude to the same the same as scripture to appoint unto them that morning zion to give them beautiful ashes and the oil of joy for mourning the garment of priests for the spirit of heavens that they might be called up the trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified when the lord plants you he can glorify himself in you that's why the lord didn't accept the the the sacrifice of a king because his sacrifice was what blood so what the lord revealed to abel that's what the lord accept the lord will not accept your condition he will accept his condition for you he'll meet you on his premises not your premises some people say oh i believe in god i don't go to church i don't read a bible but i believe in god satan believes in god it doesn't make no difference believing that you have a maker is not a mystery but his purpose for your life what before the foundation of the world he ordained for you to do on earth when you accept that condition accept that perfect woe for your life that is when you become the planting of the lord amen glory to the lord let's go to the next um the next one the rapture is a person and it's a person of christ jesus the lord and is you uh christ is the mystery of god revealed he said 188 and to be sure he said the whole rapture now luther was a part we always look at rapture in the future but let's look at what this this one could change my thinking some years back and so to be sure the whole rapture now luther was apart how can luka be a part of the rapture when the rapture is not taking place so the rapture is a person it's not an event we find out wesley was a part right and he kept using wars he didn't say he's going to be a part he said what's a part so past the prophet was a part if they are if they aren't part just in the revelation that they was making up the body so the rapture is the body of the lord it's you this is a rachel it's your solomon it's you sister brown it's all of you a man it's a body feet toes arms and so forth wow so rapture has a toe rapture has a feet rapture has a head wow that's amazing until the head which we get to that in a few minutes see we send a lot of the prophet went into that that makes the entire rapture so rapture is a whole something it is the body of the word which is christ amen the rapture is a person remember the brahms that when the seas were revealed his bible the old king james bible thompson's chain whichever bible was using became a new book how how did the bible it's a revelation in the bible the law revealed more to him than he has already received when you read this older message you talk about rapture in the future but when the seas were opened he said rapture is a person john wesley was part of the rapture remember in whistler's revival american journalists went to england to interrogate about what is this wesleyan revival reviewing about when they went to this old police-centered uh policeman who was a son of god full of the holy ghost he didn't point them he said we are looking for the with the reviver if somebody asks you i'm looking for spreading through tabernacle don't say okay let me take you to brad jack's house no no no no you feel the test he said i am the spirit of truth tabanaca you have arrived amen i am rapture you have arrived amen i am mr righteousness you have arrived i am mr millennium you have arrived i am assisting you having a new earth you have arrived i am the wasted reviver i am the spirit of truth tabernacle christ is tabernacling in me amen not this building no not the next building you are going into it that is just the tabernacle that we congregate by you and me we are the tabernacle of spirit and truth glory hallelujah amen so the rapture is you the millennium is you peace is you mercy is you love is you it's all the person of christ in manifestation amen brother jeffrey you are peace you are the rapture amen so we don't go looking for the rapture is is you amen you don't have to wait for sometime people get scared and they act based on fear when they hear oh there's coronavirus oh wow the rapture hey brother joseph rapture is so close we got to like live a good life when everything settled okay let's go on and boozing drinking and doing it because they are acting on fear it's not a revelation abraham was sitting in his temple in his heart when melchizedek came to him before he destroyed sodom and gomorrah came to inform for abraham he changed his body he said can i heard anything from my prophet he was a friend of god elohim was in him christ is in you you are your own rapture by the holy ghost baptism that's why it's so important that whatever you are doing if you don't have the holy ghost in you stop it and seek the holy ghost and make sure make sure make assurance doubly sure or eternally sure that you are a working jesus christ you are a working monument of elohim that you you see christ in yourself and others will see christ in you that is your purpose number one because you can build the seven police remember mrs wisdom she had materials to build a house to kill a beast but she asked what let go herself let the revelation kill her own beast her own ambition and then let christ take over her life and christ in hell was teaching her yes when you look at the seven church churches they had mistakes ephesians they left their first love sadist they were not perfect i think it's philadelphia that they they said they had almost everything right but most of the church churches had loud this year of course you know these are people's right but they received christ and christ helped them to turn around the corner to patch their mistakes to pitch their their shortcomings because christ was the one directing the house to be built he is giving you an idea material to build our house what is the house the house of the lord the house of the living christ and what house are you building for the lord are you building based on selfish ambitions or based on ulterior motives or is it centered on jesus christ in your life and for the body of the lord amen whatever gift the lord has put in you the lord wants to use that gift but he need your permission he need you to surrender that gift to him like the two songs that were sent my sister bruce and sister michelle they just like ran into the message i was going to preach they had to surrender their gift to be used by the lord amen let's go to the next one the next city the the two cities fusaka suga they call it fusaka sugar means a woman who has become invisible to the world hidden in christ and is invincible too powerful to be defeated or seduced when you see the revelation of christ you hide over the mountain and the house that the the the worship is this mountain around and it's kind of ousted it's not in town and i said the natural types of spiritual your life is hidden in christ the devil cannot touch you he has to touch christ before he can touch you and become invincible it becomes too strong for the world to seduce you the lord has put virtues in you as a church and that virtues is for the lost use is for your husband jesus christ that virtues is not for the seducing person it's not the air for what's the name of those people i don't remember the name uh womanizes i want i wonder where that i want to use i don't remember but it's not the man that seduce people with money with sex your virtues has been given to christ and you keep it holy for the christ spiritually and naturally amen you keep yourself for your husband you keep it yourself for your wife and we keep our soul for the body of for christ amen our eternal husband even if your husband dies christ is still your husband if your wife dies christ is your wife if your brother dies christ is your brother if your sister passed away christ is your sister and so we keep ourselves for christ and christ alone glory hallelujah i think we've read the scriptures let's just go ahead and save time the power of multiplication it looks like it's raining heavily raining cats and dogs as they say infinity the term infinity means god without limitation he hasn't got any limitation when you see your limitation let christ come sin amen the lord allow certain things in our lives for purpose so that he will fill the gap in your life william brahm had a stomach problem that attacked him all his life he could i think one testimony he said he prayed for people cancers were dropping healing dead were raised but he had this little stomach pain south stomach that was troubling him almost all the time but the lord sought to glorify himself when the lord healed him he drew his face in iraq amen and i think he revealed something to you about his name 777 williams seven letters marion seven letters branham seven letters so there are certain things in your life that you might be battling with that you might not understand certain trials that the lord permit them it's not the devil the lord permitted them in your lives that he'll be glorified in those trials it could be a delay of one of the promises for you it could be a family it could be sickness but the lord wants to have a third pool in that trial amen it doesn't matter what it is the lord wants to magnify himself and so let him take over that spot in your life and you see his glory in a very special way amen so the quotes here countdown 64. so now look look at here on the day of pentacles the holy spirit separated itself and tons of fire set upon each one the great pillar of fire separated and each one received a portion of the of the holy spirit upon them like tongues of fire well if you put one tongue of fire and two tons of fire together you get twice the strength that you had in one amen remember it wasn't ezekiel in his vision of the two sticks in the hand if i put my little pill of fire to brother solomon's pillow fire we get what twice to the jacks to my sisters we have multiples amen so you don't have to be a hermit crab living by yourself but let it let your pillow fire adjoin to another pill of fire let your faith adjourn to another faith and when we put it together it becomes a combustion wrong called a roman candle it bends without ending if we put our love together when we we unite together with one mind one accord one purpose one motive one reason on anything heaven comes down amen every yoke is broken because eternity is in action amen there are certain things that you can do by yourself but when you add your faith to someone's faith your brothers your sister's faith it becomes easy tax for you to do it glory hallelujah wisdom let's go to the next slide wisdom is a person and wisdom is message jesus christ she keeps her virtues for her husband the lord jesus christ the wife is the wife of christ is sitting behind a rock of revelation that she built during the seven churches the house that you bought that's where you live in the the the the horse the moon or horse the donkey that a rebecca watered the same donkey took it to her isaac the revelation that you're watering the church that you are serving the ministry that you are serving under it will bring you to where your expectation amen she climbed the serving pillars to meet the husband christ in the king's chamber in the morning good morning messi jesus christ you have arrived amen god bless you let's be on our feet [Applause] glory hallelujah shall we pray heavenly father we thank you we bless your name this hour we give all the glory to your name father your word has gone forth people from not only those of us here but those streaming and those who are here to receive it speak to your people lord set the captive free bring blessing prosperity father in the house of the lord in our pastor in the body of christ the ministry father i pray mothers sisters children babies my lord let the glory of the lord descend mightily father i pray that each one will walk boldly because you have become a jaguar you have become our revelation we have become that uh physical cigar the woman that is hidden in christ that people don't see us but they see christ they see the account of jesus christ they see the pillar of fire they see the love of christ they see patience they see faith they see love in us even as we walk about our earthly duties may your glory be among us father we pray that services into your hands father bless each and every one during the week lord father blesses my lord everywhere that your people be work places schools homes my lord may your glory be so common be so so prevalent that it will not even be a miracle anymore and that's what you seek to do there were certain damn things were a miracle but it's our daily life because you have become our life we thank you father take all the glory for your name we bless you in jesus christ and we pray amen god bless you the lord bless you bless you mightily and you may take your seat please praise the lord i really appreciate brother kwaku um certainly certainly grateful for uh all that was shared for us today and i can't pronounce some of the the words that he was just uh mentioning as far as the names of those cities but i i love that little thought on the jaguar and um you know you you look at um that animal and i think he said it it kills its prey with one leap nip or blow and um you know and oftentimes you know you look at that and and you think of you know just what satan is able to do but he turned around and put it on christ and it says uh you know christ can just take one leap one nip one blow and everything's wiped out just like that i i was i was just very very blessed eternity is living for others uh uh you know and how the word of god is calling us for separation called separation but thanks to the world so we can come out of chaos and go into peace amen god bless you brother quick who god bless you um you know his um testimony there of the atheists that did not believe in um in god but the man canceled going to work because god started dealing with his heart him and his wife at the same time and how they had to go through i mean driving for an hour to find a little river a dirty river to baptize and you know i you know i have to be honest i i i admire brother quick i i really do i admire them i mean even even when they were down there you know uh he told me that the flight uh was the lady missed it and all that because of this covet test and everything he was just so calm and so and for me i'm like if something go wrong i'll be ready to just pack unpack my suitcase and just man forget about it on the will of god you know but but we got to learn how to persevere we got to have uh determination right you know that no matter what we're going through that you know if god called you to it then just stay with it you know no matter what no matter how how bad it might look just stay with it god god gonna make a way somehow and and just to see how god just turned that whole thing around to be all the way in columbia find a river after a whole hour searching and to get there and then a man walk up from west palm beach come on y'all [Music] that's what you doing what you doing man this was predestinated by almighty god right here man from west palm beach baptizing them like come on only god can orchestrate something like that i just it just it's blessed my heart i'm so glad that he just took time to share and and as i was telling you all earlier when we when we when we give this is where you know our giving is going to to be able to kind of support work like this um i was um while i was in north carolina recently uh brother barry coffey was was telling me about um there's a um a ministry in africa that he he he went actually to the to the nation of africa he uh i forget what nation is but he created his own bank account um and uh so he has um he's able to just kind of transfer funds from one account to another and he says what i do is i have i gave the pastor over there a debit card to that account and anytime he need money he just go to that account and get the money out and always just you know just transfer money accordingly so he was telling me this and i say um i said okay he said well he uh he said the the pastor uses it in order to support the missionaries that take all the messages throughout the country and even to other countries all into the bush i see he said he said cost them brothers about 25 a month to support their families and to deliver all these books i said 25 a month [Music] he said yeah that's that's that's what it cost him so the pastor get 25 for this brother 25 for that brother 25 for his brother and just gives it out to him you know and said hey just take this this is for your family to make sure your family can eat and then you also can go and do the work of the lord 25 a month i ain't talking about giving to hungry kids some of them kids ain't too hungry i'm gonna listen to that right now but uh but but but what i'm saying is that we have to get ourselves to a level where we can actually support financially to things like that 25 a month supports an entire family church we we can do better we can do better you know so i mean this this year that's going to be part of our our our our our vision you know but we want to go to the next level even again we uh i asked brother bear said well how do you get the money to put into the account and say churches just send money to us sometime we take that money just put an account and then that goes there for that passing i said okay i'm gonna go back and i'm gonna talk to our church because i think we want i know we can afford at least 25 i think we can afford more than that but i would love to see some of the saints just try to catch a vision say look you know what i want to be a part of this just put this in let the missionaries go and do the work of the lord and i'm going to tell you something everybody that has touched every that one man that was touched in south south of central america all those that gave towards that god gives you credit for that one soul god give you credit for that one song you probably never meet him in this life but when you get to the other side brother branham say you're looking you see that halo hanging over his hands reference it in eternal life he said you'll realize you had something to do with it just a dollar that you gave a 25 whatever it was that you gave helps that i want to i want to encourage this as a church let's let's let's go to the next level and let's let's be busy about the father's business and and i tell you if brother quaker don't mind going to places like that i'ma just be honest everybody can't go everybody can't go i mean but they would have packed up i'd probably be the first ones but i don't think this is below the lord but i'm gonna go ahead and i'm gonna get on back down to florida right but no i mean not brother craig who's like praise will just calm down just wait just wait and then you see brother jerry with that same nature i mean he brother i got to go to work i'm gonna have to i don't

reason and trust me this is you know the field is the world and we got we have to go into all the world and preach the gospel so i just thank god that we have the opportunity to do that and and to hear that testimony just blesses my heart blesses my heart a a husband and a wife that accepted the word and they'll they'll come closer they'll come close i mean some you kind of look at the pictures

little different father we pray even for the pastor there lord he needs a building he needs a place to go that he could bring the people that it won't just be a catch and release because we realize what the scripture tells us god that uh uh sometimes a person would come and get delivered but those still spirits will leave and they'll come back with seven others and lord the last estate of the person is worse than the first estate so god they have to have some place they can go in some place they can grow god provide if you've already provided amen the materials he just needs to land and
