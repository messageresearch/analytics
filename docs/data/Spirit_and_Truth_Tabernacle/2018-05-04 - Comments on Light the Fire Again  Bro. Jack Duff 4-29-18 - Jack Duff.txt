and did everything we actually do so we're very very appreciative of that and man we we had up some personal workers ready to go a man and I was happy that they volunteered that was just a bird sister brown assistant Michelle so I want to thank you all a man for just being ready to go a man if you were called upon thank you so much my brothers my brothers my brother and my brothers my brother my brother my brother fathers brothers present [Applause] lordy God there's no way the meetings would have been what they were without them brothers so as I was just sitting there you know brother smiley a while ago had made a comment to me we were going through a season a man where we lost so many here in our church a man my father we lost mother Tillman a man that year brother hoochie a man and brother Mikey and man we lost him all in the same year and our brother smiley saying man I know that's rough sometimes kind of hard to go on you know when things like that happen but since that time God has added a man to our church and and and when I looked around last night I said man I know where the Mike would be pretty proud no I know but that but that would be pretty proud and you know I just know that it would have brought just a big smile like I can see brother Mike running all over the tent you know but you know but just seeing what garland has done a man assist that time and the way that he's establishing I mean that you know they they give them give them Secret Service devices I mean them Secret Service devices that set y'all off to another level you know and even brother Danny said now I'm looking at this and I I like this I like this so I wouldn't be surprised we end up in Sarasota at some point in time you see some matter of some things in the ear you know but it's a cousin brother son said some presidents you know and and then I was just appreciate I mean just just every detail was taken care of I know that out before the meetings actually occurred of many brothers multiple trips went out there to hand out just Flyers to let people know was doing they sent me back pictures and I was just looking at the brothers in the neighborhoods at the Walmart just everywhere just getting out flyers and I say I was just just grinning just smile I said praise God and and and I want y'all brothers to know that God got a bigger smile than I got a man praise the Lord and then it costs money to drive out to Okeechobee like that and take multiple trips and you know just get out in the heat of the day and do that God saw that and God will reward you for your faithfulness a man God will reward you mightily for your faithfulness so I wanted to thank them a man I wanted to specifically remember the Devon thank you brother Jeffrey amen thank you brother Stephen thank you brother Jerry thank you brother Mike thank you Amen I really really appreciate what you all feel please the Lord certainly thank God for brother Troy and just I mean just being there kind of helping manage everything and I just that a Realty can really can and I'm grateful I'm extremely grateful for that I was just I was told I was the pick in that Jenna just be honest out you know telling my family and like my brother was all over the place they got a hit the drunk go grab a mic put on the headset he's all over the place but I say you know what I say he making up time wherever every everything that the devil stole from him he getting it back right now Holly well the devil is in trouble all right gonna try been set loose so I you know I was just I was just thinking God is testimony bless me and sister Tyus testimony blessed me and you know it's like hearing it all over again for the first time and when they when they said I mean I was wondering cuz we didn't get the projector but the way that they set that up and gave out the the copies and to send it through the audience that that anointed some faith that in order some faith and you know and you know sometimes we take it for granted what God has done for us but we have to be the ones to be out there to spray it what God has done for us because other people don't know God is still moving in this way but but I believe some faith was anointed and some people that came up for prayer I'm expecting to hear tremendous testimonies a man from from what was it what what happened there last night so thank you all for being so obedient for the guarantee of testimony blew us out the water man you bless this your blessed us thank you so much for this yielding yourself see you know what we're doing this is our this is the first of many we've already been invited to Sarasota just after this one weekend we were invited y'all can bring this tenth of Sarasota if you'd like to right so we don't know where God gon take us right but we gonna be obedient to the Lord and and we're just gonna you know whatever we can do for the kingdom of God that's what we're gonna do but but uh but you know we don't we were having the testimonies go forth because you don't know when and where you'll share that testimony who will need to hear what you have to say right and there's more testimonies in this house right there's more but but we you know there we just think that for the ones that that God chose for this time and I was very grateful for that I believe I had a man I thought I wrote down some oh yeah did brother Gary from brother smiley Church I mean brother Wesco Church his testimony was nice and also mr. Howard Chi I didn't get a chance to hear his testimony but I was happy to have him he was very instrumental in providing some some things for us there and and I told sooner if you come all the way from West Palm Beach to come out there to be a part of what we don't do say I want you to have just a few minutes to say something and I he came and after the service he came and hugged me see this has great potential this has great potential so you're going places I say I'm not trying to do all that but we you know we whenever the Lord won't that's what we want right a man and and but he was he was just very very excited and and and you know we're very grateful to have them and I know that the the Lord can use them to bless us as we go into some other areas a man so I just wanted to stop and just take time to say thank you a man to each and every one of you the the Saints that came by pressed their way out to be a part of the services to help create the atmosphere thank you all so much amen ever it really really meant a lot just to be there in Okeechobee this weekend praise the Lord and and I am I you know this you know our again I'm going back to our quote as to where we have come from right thank you thank you but it was something that I did want to say about that yeah actually I forgot three people - two more brother Josue brother Quentin brother Guerin now I'm gonna go a little further with these fellows these brothers here so you know brother Josue gave the testimony did you bring you home I told him bring it today okay next one a brother brother Josue and brother Guerin they they came and they kind of they they loaded everything into the truck put it in the truck and I think it was on Friday they they come up here to get something out of church and and I I was over the school and I heard somebody walking up so I he he's the door to school open so I can look at him and they like why there's no opening and now they're like oh brother Jack isn't what you're doing I said well I was coming up here to get this and said well we coming up here to get this and you know we was we were just kind of chatting a little bit and and you know they they they took it home and then they got themselves prepared to come out to the meeting a man in Okeechobee and and and when they got on the road to come traffic was terrible right so they they were like ain't no way we're gonna make it on time we got old it we got sound equipment we got all the stuff you know and I've even we're not gonna make another time and brother host we were sharing how God sent two fire trucks and and in the direction that the fire trucks were going he says kind of opposite of where they really should have been going right so so he said he saw two fire trucks I'm like why these five trucks coming this way see this just don't make no sense so he just kind of fellowship and around and everything and he say you know what it's over the game so I think I thank god these fire trucks for us to get us through this traffic and say what i'ma do is just get right behind them if that's not illegal I'm gonna get right behind right [Music] so he said i'ma get right behind him you know and he got right back and he said now wait a minute he said you know what I think these fire trucks are actually gonna make a u-turn shut off the lights when they get to a circus but they're gonna shut off the lights and that's gonna be it now so here's my thing is that I do believe God sent two fire trucks and here's the other thing I think they was illegal right ain't no citizen turn them like song if ain't no fire if you've got one [Applause] what you wanna feel you get on the road because you got one of these so exactly what the brother said that's what they did they made a way out of no way for the implements to get on up the highway and they made it there safely and we thank God and then you know after you know every night we're breaking down and putting things up and you know and all that and I was I was very grateful to see that you all so faithful and that brothers you're so faithful just the work that you did before the work that you did after the work that you did doing man it was it was a blessing it really was a blessing but on last night we load everything up and I say well you know we got to get all this back because we got the keyboard need to be set up for Sunday morning service microphones you know put back in place and all these other things and we are on our way back and you know we get a bit how is it's 11 they're going and they're going into the midnight and I told brother Josue and brother Darren I said now brothers y'all don't have to bring it back tonight but you got to get up early in the morning and bring because we got to have it ready it's okay all right so I'm on the highway or not and I had I had I saw them pulled over at the gas station and I said well I would just keep on going and you know and I'm I'm writing and I pass you know brother brother Quentin and then I did I see brother Josue come by me with them chairs on the back of his truck I said no he just passed with his house that they gonna take this to the church today that's okay that's right I ain't gonna say nothing I got all day up here to 45th Street and I said brother I thought y'all was gonna go home say no we don't get it done tonight we don't get it done tonight so I said all right so we stopped at the light on there and and I brother Josue there and then brother brother Quentin was behind us and and we all driving and for the hosts we pulled on into the church then I kept past my turn I pulled on to the church and say I'm gonna help the brothers out cuz this is a blessing I said brother Quentin gonna probably keep on going to go home and brother getting brother Guerin thought the same thing in his and his car for the Quinten gonna keep on going he put no blink on he just and and all of them pulled in and we got that got everything unloaded last night and brought back into the church and I said man y'all see things through from start to finish and I like that I like that so I appreciate you brothers in the sacrifice that you are made I mean that's midnight y'all here doing that and making sure that the soldiers of the Lord is set up and ready for the next morning that was that was very very much appreciated so thank you all so much I'm going back just to this quote here I've been reading this but this is where our thought came from and and doing this and it and it's not over it's not over this is just beginning y'all just beginning this is not over you know one of the one of the the Saints came up a prayer last night and they were standing in the gap for many of the young people that have walked away from this word and and by them standing the gap what they're what they're believing God to do is light the fire again all right so you know this this thing that we're that we're seeing in this quote is not something that just hit this area everybody is impacted by this right but we're not stuck Amen we're not stopping at the negative right we're looking at the positive and we're going forward with what you know what God has called us to do and we're gonna see God he's already started and he's gonna do more he's gonna light the fire you again so let me read this again I want to just bring something out a man maybe something I hope that we won't miss a man but let me just read this again because this is where our thought was this is at Ephesian Church age and the Prophet was again quoting revelation 2:4 and he's making comments on this scripture where it says nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love to understand this you must realize that the Spirit is not speaking to the original sinks of Ephesus alone this message is to the entire age which lasted about 120 years its message then is to all generations in that span now history keeps repeating itself in the generations of Israel now you know just that statement there the message would have been to all the generations in that span that would have been three generations all right so but here it says that now history keeps repeating itself and the generations of Israel we see revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next and you know I was sharing here or last week just some of the testimonies from brother Perry green and some of the things that he saw even I shared it on on Wednesday night and I was telling a little testimony how brother pair of green was in the pulpit one time and he's talking you know about brother Branham he's explaining to his church you know the experiences that he's had a witness man says he's got to be something to this man you know I mean this dis man is it's it's something else you know he's and so he's explaining all this to the church and and while he's in the pulpit all of a sudden the phone just rings you know not now when when I say all of a sudden the phone rings you all have to understand how the phone worked back then see nowadays we got cell phones and you can call any time you want to call but back then you know it was sometimes it was even worse than their what they call the party line and young people don't know anything about this but but but the party line a man is that you had to share a number for a whole area right and what would happen sometimes you would get on the phone and you would call somebody and you you'd be waiting to talk to them or you'd already be in the midst of the conversation and somebody else in your neighborhood we're get on the same phone line and ask you to enjoy a conversation because they need to talk to somebody but I mean it was it was ilza I mean it was really really something not see that young people could understand now what's going on right but this distance this is what the party line was you were sharing numbers so so here the Prophet picks up the phone calls the brother wise in the pulpit talking about him and when he calls them one of the brothers is a pro saying that you ain't gonna believe this brother parents say interrupted and why for you to say brother brother brother branham is on the phone right now what right what I'm here talking about him and he wanna talk to me say congregation I can't believe it but he's on the phone right now I want to talk to me now that was that was almost a miracle you know just just by him getting that phone call at that time right so here here I'll he gets the phone call and he says excuse me I'll con quesa let me go and just check this you know just check with him and talk to him a little bit and I come back that can tell you what he said when you go any talks and and brother Branham says uh god bless you brother Perry say yes god bless you brother say you know I'm just talking about you he said yeah I know and they say well am I wrong so I said what brother Perry I was just calling to tell you that if you ever said anything wrong I'll call you so brother Perry like okay now you just called me so that put him in check as to what things he would say and what things he probably shouldn't say about the Prophet hallelujah amen because all sometimes what people and i'ma tell you you know one of the reasons that the fire has to be lit again and because some people have said some things they shouldn't I see it and what that's done is cause people to go in the wrong direction right but but but when the fire is lit again it brings them back to a balance hallelujah and before long they gonna realize that there is no other life outside of this all right Church hey man hallelujah will will realize that real soon but you know so so so you know I was sharing that because I noticed something that I laughter after I shared some of these testimonies I noticed how some of the brothers was getting really inspired it's a man ain't no way any normal man can just do things like this this proves that this got to be a prophet and without what I realized it I think we forgot to a man just begin to tell the testimonies of how God has moved right because sometimes you just hear the testimonies on how God has moved it gives you faith that gives of encouragement to know that God can still move in the same way hallelujah glory to God so I'm grateful for you know this dis this this theme here but notice notice is thought in the in this quote history keeps repeating itself and the generation of Israel we see revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next in the third generation Amber's maybe glowing slightly but in the fourth there that there may be no vestige whatsoever of the original flame and what is that they won't quote the Prophet no more no vestige early reason of flame do you even know how I got my fire lit right when we burn a smiley was it's explaining I hope we catching these things wherever smiley was explaining his own testimony the man has been 3 for 30 years when he wasn't Pentecost he couldn't give free when he was embarrassed he can get free when he was him he can get weak but when he came in contact notice part of George Bailey interview in any of my brother Jewish only talked about was the work that bids we gotta be ashamed of this message right God gave us something here something very special right but but I can't when I listen upon the breath I mean brother Smiley's testimony how you know he just sitting there listening man will you get this from it was third on the inside God with God was moving on the inside and who would have known in that that man that at that time the drug addict who woulda known God had a past in there who would have known that that's why you can't look down on nobody you don't know what's inside that person and to see Liam stain a man I mean with all that you know all that he went through before he came to Christ it will take a lot but then the man raises his family and they get to this stage there's life and giving everything to God and see this have a modern day to [Applause] the stairs I there gives us the gospel and when he made that comment that just blessed me if no [Music] if NOAA weather change his message nobody will events a so you wanna peace salvation it is bitchin foundation and most pain of rebuilding Samoa salvation was founded - message oh my God my God my God and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man I hope y'all I hope you always catching it now and I wanted to just just say you know before I go further here and this quote we gave out a lot of tracks a lot of invitations and you know sometimes and I was so happy you I know we pray for the man that brother Mike Graham - but brother Mike I also pray for him out there stop what they were doing there was I think there a couple of other situations where they stopped and they prayed with people that was ministry they might not have come to the tent but those brothers were strategically placed by Almighty God to do what they did alright so they are praying for a were praying for the sick in Okeechobee and didn't realize it that might not have brought him to the tent but you just by giving that little piece of paper God gave me an opportunity to do something somebody if that atheists didn't come to the tip but she went to some church God giving you credit for the atheist because you're the one who lit the fire that's a little conversation with them you lit that fire caused him to think a little different right so you know it's like all of us right you know I mean many of us started in different places we you know I come from Baptists and Pentecostal background and you know I had all of that and some of us come from Catholic and all kind of things but God brought us to a perfect word a perfect understanding of his word right and we're grateful you know for that I'm brother brother Devin come from Church of the latter-day saints buddy but he is up here right and it shows that you know that you got when you get to the space the place that God won't you that's when you'll begin to see what you need to see praise God you'll try this and you try that you'll try this you find this ain't working that ain't working out but when you get to where you need to be and it's not it's not a matter what when I say that it's something that's gonna strike from the inside like like brother Garen was saying I was a part of the message but the message was not part of me they would not talk different because I I'm eating the word and you all were to eat so now I see things different I see threes and sevens and I see perfection I see completion I see all kind of thing and when God just show you things like that you walk in by revelation hey man Church right but you know but but but but God has orchestrated all of our lives to come together at this time and and I wanted to say you know all of the inviting that you we did we would think that nobody a man from Okeechobee showed up but I beg to differ there was at least one from Okeechobee that showed up [Applause] and you gotta have to read between the lines and figure out the one from Okeechobee I told y'all we would go just for one and there was one from okhla Toby we just waiting to see what God gonna do but we just do off my let God do the rest well who was the one don't worry it come to you here to come to you in a come to you in a in a striking you'd be like oh that's the way God do things he just he make it so simply go right through you I yeah God God is a good God so let me I finish this quote and then I got something else I want to just kind of share here so no vestige vetting for if there may be no vestige whatsoever of the original flame then got like then God likes to fire again and that's the part that that's where we are now then God likes the fire again you know we've seen you know the embers fade we've seen the vestige of the original flame going but now we're looking at God lights to fire again that's where we are right it says in the same process is repeated hey man so that's that we ought to be an expectation for my to move in this generation whenever we see we give the devil way too much credit right you know some of y'all ought to be taking after over a car yeah I'm serious you need to you need to use your override car when the devil cut you know I'm gonna just say like this the devil was trying to take the place of the cashier and then Oh devil start bringing stuff up can I can I just be honest with you I mean that that was just ringing up all kind of things he runs up domestic issues here on up lust he rung up addiction right he runs up family problems he just started ringing up stuff and you know I got I got fed up like them sisters get fed up when they go shopping I I'm not gonna sit here first with you and you can't do nothing for me I got two words three words for you I got three words but I'm gonna talk to you no more I got three words what's that hold the manager right a minute in that that's the way that's the way I'm talking to them you came to nothing for me and you know what I'm not accepting the price that you put on the product I don't care how you make it I'm not accepting that you came through men fellas so don't get the manager and when the manager come the keys just jingling hey go at a card do you realize that [Applause] you accept it with child I'm not accept don't bring that up I'm not taking that home my family moving the message I am not accepting that over watch glory to God hallelujah yes that's light in the fire can church but don't take whatever the devil just been thrown at you right and last night I tell you there's a chest as one is coming forth from last night I'm telling y'all nah not even from people outside the community people right here see God know what he doing God know exactly what he doing thank you Jesus glory hallelujah a man a man a man you see that we were looking for God to move in our generation we know what he's done in other generations but we're trying to do what we can for our generation and I you know this whole thought that I brought to okay children override you know I don't know I think I was here to church one day and then I started thinking about your sisters shopping and God just started dropping the whole thing down brought that thing down too and say well praise the Lord but I know how to yell hey man they override that brings the Lord but we we think got forward and you know but but as I was just kind of waiting like Lord you know how do we get around you know what we wants to go with it I was waiting then I got this quote on Friday that was a confirmation to me and I want to read that as out of faith is our victory praise the Lord see that the override means to use one's authority to reject a cancel so you have the authority to reject or cancel y'all got that but before before I read faith is the victory let me read something else hey man you got the authority to reject or cancel let me read this something else real quick a man and this is going to be if I can just find it here the second miracle just give me give me give me that man the second miracle bear with me here today second miracle it says this now say some of you ladies tomorrow what if the Express agent will come down to your house and say how do you do are you miss John Doe yes well I have something here for you and you looked at it would be a great big box full of rattlesnakes well what a present there's your name tacked on them these are yours are they in one sense they're yours and another since they're not now you say I don't want them well they're yours your names on them well that's the one that's one that's one way it's yours but still it isn't yours till you sign for it it's not chose to you sign for it right and if you don't sign for it here I have to take it back you might see all your symptoms the devil says here it is he's ringing it up right here is Casa here's your heart trouble here's your crippled condition with these the sign for anything the devil brings he will have to take it back it has to be returned to the sender right amen so I refuse to have it I just won't have it no sir he will have to take it back in the name of the Lord if you believe it and confessing its I have accepted Jesus Christ as my here this thing fictional disease can stay on you stay right with it but the first time that you get weak and say well yes I still got it then you drop right that right right down to where you was at you sign for it then took it back say yes mr. devil I have it back oh brother so you stand right there as long as there is breath in your body say I refuse to have it I refuse to have it how do you feel wonderful hallelujah that's it that's right show the devil what you're made out of you're born again by the Spirit of God and you don't have to bow down to his image stay right stay right there say I don't want your stuff why here's your name on it the doctor said I don't care what he said I know what God said get away from here with it that's right that's the way to treat him hand it back he was the one give it to you but he will he'll be the one to take it back praise God you got the over rock art a man you don't have to accept anything that that were brought to you let me go back here to this just thought that was bringing a little confirmation to his faith is our victory just I ran into this on Friday just really just stay with me and I say Lord I got to go with this thought on override and it says now faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer it isn't just a peacemaker it overcomes faith is the victory that overcomes the world what does it do what is faith what is the Conqueror conquer and victory is the same to conquer it means to beat down to over right see that so faith is what actually overrides glory God your faith is what overrides whatever the devil has done your your faith it's activated where you can pick up the cards and now you don't have to wait for a manager this what I'm trying to get to you right amen and in the retail world you wait for a manager but in the spiritual world you are the manager if they ringing things up you say no you know at this just talking to a friend of mine you know we come down and visit me from Georgia he just surprised me on Friday and I'm trying to get everything ready you know to leave him and I'm and I'm in town and I just want to say hi said man but let's go out and do let's go do let's go to lunch together and and I went with him to lunch and everything and and and he was telling me you know about you know the business that he was in how he buys cars and all of that and and it was telling me say now I have access to information where I know that a car is going to be auctioned even if it's at a dealership is going to be auctioned in so many days so I look at the countdown on the option and I say my wait a minute wait a minute you know about the auction saying how do people like me get access to information like that they says you're gonna have to be a dealer this or that before you can get access to that said but he said what I'm telling you is that if you if you need something just get the VIN number and give me a call and I can tell you what the auction price is versus what they got it listed at so he said he wanted a particular car and and he walked into the dealership and he had already looked at the auction price and he knew exactly what it was he knew how much that car was going to go for and it's about three days left on the auction so he walks into the dealership and he starts talking to one of salespeople and looked at him he wasn't dressed you know like he had anything so the guy looked at him and say well who you buying this car he said we'll go get me another salesperson well that's an override and and he said Oh give me another sale for you say he's saying so another guy come up and they say look we don't talk real fast you say it showed them this pre-approve on this phone say see this right here this says I've been pre-approved to buy so much car and the car that I won't is dis from right here and the guy looked at the pre-approve say oh yes sir you say now go get the keys move real fast I don't have much time and let's take it for a drive yes sir I ain't got the keys you know Crockett officer yeah you can drive is it and again akan so you can drive it faster than X or if you like to write and you know so they they're drivin the car and they're doing everything they you know they need to do and then it starts working on the numbers and and and as they work in the numbers he knew three days from now that cars going for eight thousand dollars less than what y'all got it listed and he says he says yeah I want this car and I want it at this price say what price so many nights eight thousand say yeah I know it's $8,000 less you said but y'all don't understand I'm in this business you in this business he I'm in this business and I know that that car is you know can be sold to that price he said no my boss think I'll go for it say look what you need to do is to turn it over we call it teal turn it over they say you know why because you're not gonna make no money off this deal he said but your balls need to get rid of some cars and your boss when I go in there to him that you won't sell me the car at this price that you willing to let it go for three days from now you might not have a job turn it over override [Applause] right and you just if you if you just do that this thing would be done and nobody get hurt right okay sir he went and talked to the boss till everything said okay the man is right y'all sign the deal cinammon out of here and he walked off that lot with his Maserati so you know I mean you got to know your authority and when it comes to the devil and all the stuff that he doing you got to know your authority you don't have to accept everything that the devil does right I mean you and I can say the scripture actually tells what whatever you find on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven right so it really what God is telling you guys that he's giving you the cart and you use it when you need to use it you don't just call the manager for anything and everything they have to be special situations and circumstances but when you get called you know you have authority to change the situation praise God Amen I'm believing God for that I want to just go back to the scripture I gave it to you all for homework on last week but I'm gonna pick it up here and we'll we're gonna come home feeling up mine out of Luke 14 praise the Lord thank you all so much y'all just made it a wonderful wonderful weekend wonderful each and every one of you blessed be the name of the Lord and for the Saints that weren't there last night but my title last night was override and that's why you know I'm using this car and I was overriding some things so a man so a man I pray that y'all catch up but you can override today you can use your car then get out of whatever situation you mean cancel that thing I'm changing the price change the outcome right and I love it when they use the overwrite car it always works out in your favor you always leave with a smile when they use an override car praise God so here in Luke 14 and this is for my precious brothers I'm at verse 15 thank you all so much for what you did by going out there and just getting the word spread this is what Jesus told us to do and he says look and when one of them has said it meet with him heard these things he said unto Him blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God then said he unto unto him a certain man made a great supper and bathed many so he invited a lot of people and that's what happened when you all went out there with the the with the not tracks but the invitations you were inviting a lot of people praise God and do you realize that every person that you invited if they went to judgment they would be responsible for rejecting the invitation that God uses you to give right so he says then he said a certain man made a great supper in vain many and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground and I must needs go and see it and I pray thee have an excuse now again you know you look at this this man's excuse it's not even logical who would buy property that they have never seen this man is already seeing his property right this man is our this man knows what he purchased but this is this is an excuse as well as a lie right I mean look at say the first time I have bought a piece of ground and I must needs go and see it I pray they have an excuse what you come on come on you don't already saw the property know exactly what it look like you just don't want to go do a man what we asked you to do look at this the next and another set I have bought five yoke of oxen and I go to prove them I pray to help me choose now look at this now you don't boss some animals to work your your land and you ain't even tested them you didn't never see them work you might you might just may you don't know what you got a hold up now ain't nobody ever made money on nothing that they tested before this man is just coming up with an excuse I don't know maybe you young man might have hard people out there with excuses it's okay it's okay look at this I mean that that guy Howard that came by he said he'd been told no so many times it don't bother him he just keep going to the next one I mean I was out with him the other day we were at wild Martin and I'm just sitting there I'm you know getting some getting something from him he says I say so how you know how does this happen how's that heavy say he say watch this what those two ladies say if you were to die right now do you know do you absolutely know for sure he he and the latest lady first said you know are you coming to get my boxes or what what you come out here for and she said she said no I don't want no box to say I just want to know do you know absolutely for sure are you ready to meet God and she said uh I'm good you sure I'm good okay well right away from I see we need more people like that right we need people that walk up to you like like a thing with sister trails father God send a prophet and you misty and what a father told brother Solomon God send a prophet and you missed it what miss had to sit down and explain to him what happened right but but you know we we need people with boldness not thanked off of you young men to have boldness to go out there and do what you did God god bless you for that but Jesus gives us the parable to tell you know what what happened these are the things that we can expect a man we don't back up because a man the people that we invited didn't come you don't know when they will come they still got the address to the church it's on the invitation and one day you might hear testimony one time these guys came through the neighborhood and then somebody gave me some protection I just showed up here in this church I don't know you don't know what gotta do right so so so we thank God for it but here here you know verse 19 another set I have about five yoke of oxen and I go to prove them I pray they have me excused and another said I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come now he had a good excuse he had a good excuse a man he should have been spent some time with his wife but I but here here you know that the verse women says so disturbing that servant came and showed his Lord these things and then the master of the house being angry status servant go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor in the main and the hall in the blind now I want you to understand the Prophet actually tells us this part verse 21 is actually the second pool of the invitation and the first pool you know it would demand it made us tough but this great man made us suffer and he sent to serving out in a supper time or the evening time right he sent him out and and and and and they began to make excuse that was the first pool now the second time he he sends him out now he's saying just go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here that the poor the main and the halt and the blind now before I go further in that scripture I just want to read one quote for you a man this is out of the message el-shaddai I want you to understand what is happening spiritually and man this is out of el-shaddai it says every preparations mate healing is already atone for sins are already atone for all things are already all things already come that's right the wedding supper is set excuses are made but he said go into it may say the last call was go get the sick and the halt a campaign of feeling just before the wedding supper so it's not by accident that brother Mike ran into the man that had you know some meat there with us through the throat cancer and everything it's supposed to be a campaign of healing just before the wedding supper right now notice he says now you see where we're at go get the lame the halt the blind out of the streets and highways and hedges and bring them in healed them and let me show my mercy to them then they'll believe me that's right that's God's last call supper call us healing the last call you know as that the sisters of Shonda was I miss our sister Tony would share her testimony it was handed down everything I hadn't seen brother leave her in a good while and he was there last night that thing moved him he got a hold of that he said I'm taking this home to my wife I wanted to see this see we got a we're not talking about what God did 60 years ago we're talking what God did for us just last year just last year right and and when we share these things we don't know how to impact him people and and I'm actually believing that in brother Leroy the fires lit again alright let it be a sign for many more to come I believe that he was just blessed fine he was share of testimonies with me so I said praise God it's fine I got lit again that's good all right all right all right let me let me finish reading the scripture verse 21 the second poll right so the servant came and showed it as Lord these things in the mass of the house being angry said to the servant go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the Main and the halt and the blind the servant said Lord it is done as thou has commanded and yet there is room and the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compelled them to come in that my house may be feel so this was their third pool right when they went out into the hedges and the highways and they compelled them to come in that was the third pool and then verse 24 says for I say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper so before the great the the supper Amen the great supper that supposed to have that with the Lamb of God they were supposed to be a man people going out into the highways into the hedges and trying to get people to come in we just fulfilled portion in that scripture just with this light to fire we fulfilled a portion of that we did what Jesus told us to do now we're not finished we want to do more all right but this is our responsibility we have to go out and we have to do what we need to do and when everybody given today places everybody doing what God called them to do and we work in harmony and unity watch what God does in the midst of us this is our first time we're gonna work out every kink right there's some things that we know we need to improve on but nonetheless we're gonna do the very best that we can will we will go through criticism we'll go through all cannister but we don't keep doing what God called us to do amen praise the Lord a man a man so I I'm very very grateful I just I just wanted to take time just to thank you all you know for what you've done and I'm believing God amen that we'll see results from our efforts and not just all I can say is thank you for getting behind the vision and supporting the vision and and just pushing it forward that's that's that's just from my heart to yours amen on today and and I just wanted to take time and say that I've told sister Tina don't put a title up I'm just making comments from this weekend that's all I'm doing that's all I'm doing I preached last night a man and I think there was enough here for unity to get something if you come to church tonight you'll hear another sermon I guarantee amen if you can make it a night but I didn't want to keep you long today and I want to have a word of Prayer before we before we go and I have one other thing that I need to do before we leave here on today so just pray with me amen at this time don't musicians don't worry about coming father we just thank you for your spirit we know that you it was you God that was involved and this whole like the fire just I can just go back in my mind I just think of so many things that if that happened along the journey thank you for this church I thank you for God just just these cents I thank you for spirit and truth Tabernacle thank you for their Lord many of them might not have realized but they were they were holding up my hands through this entire process and Lord just little things here little things they're holding up my hands I just I just appreciate them all the details that were looked at different ones would just go to the store buy things just to kind of make sure that we were prepared for it they spent of their own money their own time doing so much to make sure that we were thoroughly prepared for this god I am so grateful you have put the right people in the right places in order to make to make that weekend a success and I'm grateful Lord some don't even think our hearts didn't even want to take credit for it but God do know about it God even the the young men that was sacrificed of time three times they went out there God to just try to get the word out to people in the community and Lord what a tremendous sacrifice but God I'm grateful for the experience that they had the things that they gained and and from that what it will do for them later on in their own lives Lord I'm so appreciative of that and lord I just pray that as we as a church just yield to what you have planned for us then God we trust that you would use us for your glory and for your honor this is not to bring glory to ourselves but this is the very glory to the king of kings and to the Lord of lords I pray O God is that you have returned to each one everything that they put out to make these to make the weekend a success everything that they gave me you give back their strength their time their money the effort give back to them down 100 folders my prayer continue to bless warrant this church may we may we be wise watching the devil on every hand that will keep him out of the midst of what you're doing in this place o God we won't let her have any victory and God everything that we would that we've heard that we won't we won't give glory and man and just appraise to what the enemy is doing we want to give glory and praise and honor to what our God is doing we're gonna keep the focus on you and God you told us what we bound on earth shall be bound in heaven what'd we lose donor shall be loosed in heaven so we're we're loosing a man sickness from the people releasing sin from the people we're losing a man confusion from the people and we're releasing revelation and understanding we're releasing healing for their bodies we're releasing healing for their minds we're releasing healing for their souls we're we're releasing that right now wherever they are whatever they're going through we're releasing the healing power of God the Bible says you sent your ear to heal so that let it be done father if you just have to start with one let the change begin with that one and when it starts there in a create that that

wildfire it can't be stopped father let that occur Lord and okeechobee a man you've seen the church go through some some great things but you promised to restore and we're under expectation for you to

side and I wanted to publicly tell her that 25 years ago I said I do and today I still do and butter Geoffrey if you would just do me the honors I wanted to just appreciate her you know 25 years ago there's there's so much that has happened in our life things that we did not plan for 25 years ago spirit and truth was not in our plan but it was in God's plan and and there's no way I could've did this without her right so she's been a real rock and I just wanted to say thank you it's 25 roses for 25 years [Applause] and and in 25 years a man be because she is stood by my side and you know I learned my grandmother taught me some things the years ago and I learned I was a pretty tough fella growing up I had a part of the sermon last night I was going to share my mother didn't want me to go to the military I was trying to go to military after I graduated high school and my mama just didn't want me to go and my mama knew that I was the type of child that once I made up my mind I was gonna do what I wanted to do so mama would talk to me like no I'm going to the military and mama got my pastor to talk to me and I remember going into the office I cannot usually don't go to the office unless you done did something wrong dang did nothing wrong so what is this all about and my pastor stopped talking about brother Jack please consider please pray about it pray about it about going to the military where I I can't say I prayed about I just said I wanted to go to military and I had just dropped that little seed in me and and I said okay all right I ain't prayed about it and I say if I do pray that God can probably tell me no so I won't go to the military and and and Mama's desire was granted you know and but I was grateful to see she didn't want to put me in certain environments she saw other things in me that God could use and if I would been in that environment then Satan would have tried to override what God had for me but but I'm grateful for that and you know so one of the things that my grandmother taught me one time you know I was doing okay a man with my job and and mama wanted to pursue something like that for for Christmas and I said say you know how much that goes so somehow my grandma got ahold of that information and I had to take her mom to the no to the first oh she go thrift shopping on certain days from stolen stolen I was just waiting in a car for and she stopped me and touched your mama and worth everything that you can't spend on how I'm saying it again she said your mama's worth everything you can't spend on say so don't don't tell her no it's okay grandma all right so I went and got that person but that taught me a lesson that not only with my mother be worth everything I could spend on her but my wife would also be worth everything I could spin on her and when I got married 25 years ago I bought my wife this ring and I she she wore it proudly a man for a number of years and I was you know grateful for that and then we got to our 10th year anniversary and I found out that I had to buy another ring and that's what I found out because I saw looking online and all kind of things I'm just kind of go Stephen all your other brothers following up just understanding so how many of you don't vote how many you know biomemory oh yeah my brother just celebrated 30 years so we celebrated 25 and today I got to give my wife a third ring [Applause] so somebody would hold her flowers here for her let her open a ring this is a this is for my precious wife and when we first got married I couldn't do this but I'm grateful that the the Lord has allowed us to be able to do this and and I give this to her today it's expression of my love to her for 25 years thank you [Applause] [Applause] [Laughter] thank you so much very I love you
