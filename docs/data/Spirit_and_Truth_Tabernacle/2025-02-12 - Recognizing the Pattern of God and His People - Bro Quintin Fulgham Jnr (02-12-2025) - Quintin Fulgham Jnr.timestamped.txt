[10:45] you all um I want to uh welcome some
[10:50] special guests that we have today um uh
[10:54] our coworker back there uh Claudia um
[10:58] she's here us to join us tonight today
[11:01] um
[11:04] Y and is it Janiah Janiah and that's her
[11:07] daughter Janiah so it's it's great to
[11:09] have y'all with
[11:13] us so we are going to get straight into
[11:15] the word um we are going to turn to turn
[11:20] our Bibles to um 1 Corinthians
[11:24] 11:1 and then we'll also be reading Joel
[11:27] 2:24
[11:29] so just say Amen once you uh once you
[11:32] get
[11:39] there all right and 1 Corinthians 11:1
[11:44] reads be ye followers of me and this is
[11:47] Paul speaking even as I also am of
[11:52] Christ and then uh Joel 2 we're going to
[11:55] read uh chap we're going to read Joel
[11:58] chapter 2 we're going to read read verse
[12:00] uh
[12:02] 24 just say Amen once you get
[12:05] there and it reads in the floors shall
[12:08] be full of Wheat and the vat shall
[12:10] overflow with wine and oil so may the
[12:14] Lord add a blessing to his word as
[12:15] you're as you're seated
[12:17] today so the message that the Lord
[12:20] inspired me to speak today the title of
[12:22] it is uh recognizing the pattern of God
[12:25] and his people with the subtitle of who
[12:28] are the Christian of today right so
[12:32] brother Jack has given us the theme of
[12:34] the year which is a year of overflow and
[12:36] I've been really enjoying enjoying the
[12:39] way how brother Jack has led with this
[12:41] theme how he's uh we all want a physical
[12:43] over uh overflow right we want God to
[12:46] bless our businesses God to bless our
[12:48] health God to bless our jobs uh but
[12:51] brother Jack really has been focusing on
[12:55] a spiritual overflow right uh and how
[12:58] the spiritual overflow has got to be the
[13:01] first thing when you have a spiritual
[13:03] overflow you'll find that the physical
[13:05] stuff gets taken care of and that's just
[13:08] the way that God has uh patterned things
[13:11] so uh in this message of recognizing the
[13:14] pattern of God and his people we have to
[13:16] understand how God works and God always
[13:18] works in a specific set of ways so when
[13:22] God um when God God showed that it would
[13:25] have to be a blood offering in the
[13:27] beginning when Adam and Eve sent
[13:30] that means it would have to be a blood
[13:31] offering again it have to be a sacrifice
[13:33] so God couldn't change his way of doing
[13:35] things so when Cain brought a offering
[13:38] it wasn't that God was trying to hurt
[13:39] his feelings it was just God couldn't go
[13:41] contrary of what he already approved of
[13:44] all right which is a pattern and I
[13:47] looked online of what a pattern is and a
[13:50] couple of definitions that I have is an
[13:52] arrangement or sequence regularly found
[13:54] in comparable objects another definition
[13:57] was a set of instructions to be followed
[13:59] in making a sewn or knitted item so
[14:02] you're in order to get uh that uh
[14:05] something that you a particular thing
[14:06] that you want to uh sew a design or
[14:08] something you're following a particular
[14:10] pattern to get that design another
[14:12] definition is an example for others to
[14:14] follow that is a pattern and another
[14:16] definition is to give something a form
[14:18] based on that of something else right so
[14:21] you're basing a pattern based off
[14:22] something else and a pattern essentially
[14:24] allows to you to help you to identify a
[14:27] thing right what a thing is for example
[14:29] of shape if I were to have let's say uh
[14:33] four lines Drawn Together you would be
[14:35] able to identify that that was a square
[14:37] and if I had a uh if I drew a curved
[14:40] shape uh uh totally around you would say
[14:42] well that's a circle so patterns help us
[14:44] to identify what something is so we'll
[14:47] know what it is uh and not only are
[14:50] patterns seen in like uh concrete
[14:53] objects like that but they're also seen
[14:54] in behaviors you can find patterns in
[14:57] people's behaviors which can can help
[14:59] you to avoid certain people or know to
[15:02] go towards certain people based off
[15:03] their patterns and so patterns are um
[15:08] patterns so you'll notice that smart
[15:10] people take advantage of patterns in
[15:12] order to be successful right so let's
[15:15] say you wanted to be rich what's the
[15:17] best thing to do in order to be rich
[15:19] follow someone who's already rich right
[15:22] someone who's already gone through and
[15:24] gone through the ups and downs and you
[15:26] see that they're rich which means that
[15:28] it's not something that's imaginary that
[15:29] you're trying to speculate you see this
[15:31] person is actually rich so if you could
[15:34] for example give this person some Google
[15:37] glasses with a camera and be able to
[15:39] watch what they're doing every single
[15:42] day you know maybe you would see when
[15:44] they wake up first thing the morning
[15:45] they'll go online or they'll read the
[15:46] newspaper and they'll read some
[15:48] Financial art articles or look at the
[15:50] market and then you would see as they go
[15:52] to the grocery store they go shopping
[15:54] you know they always buy the stuff on
[15:56] sale so my dad's a big Financial person
[15:59] and he loves to find a sale I'm I'm
[16:01] almost the complete opposite I'll spend
[16:03] money right but my dad is very very good
[16:06] at finances so he always is looking for
[16:08] the sale so if you're looking at this
[16:09] rich person he's always trying to get
[16:11] the sale buy one get three free right
[16:14] that's how he is right that's how that's
[16:16] how people are when they want to uh uh
[16:18] obtain riches right um also you would
[16:21] see is that when the person's paycheck
[16:23] comes in you will see they will allocate
[16:25] some of their money towards the rent to
[16:27] buy food then they will allocate some
[16:29] money for savings and then they will
[16:31] allocate some money for other
[16:32] Investments and if you kept watching
[16:34] this person's daily movements and the
[16:36] daily week you would see he does the
[16:38] same thing every single day he does the
[16:39] same thing every single week every month
[16:41] it becomes a pattern and when you follow
[16:44] that pattern you'll find that in your
[16:46] own Financial life that you'll get
[16:48] better as well right because you're
[16:50] following someone uh Studies have also
[16:53] Studies have been shown and our studies
[16:54] are used because they help to identify
[16:57] patterns so for example stud say that if
[17:00] your parents your mom and dad are
[17:01] college educated you're more than likely
[17:04] as a kid to be educated as well right
[17:06] that's a pattern um studies also sh
[17:09] studies also say that if your parents
[17:12] are in a successful marriage it's more
[17:15] than likely that you'll end up in a
[17:16] successful marriage and why is that is
[17:19] because as a kid you're constantly
[17:21] looking for patterns in life so let's
[17:23] say for example you have a daughter and
[17:26] she's sitting at The Breakfast Table
[17:28] Right and she sees her mother you know
[17:30] cook food for her husband and come bring
[17:32] her come bring the food to her husband
[17:34] and kiss him on the cheek and tell her
[17:36] uh tell him that he loves her when she
[17:38] sees that she's going to try to emulate
[17:40] that in her own marriage right and so
[17:42] and let's say there's also a son at the
[17:44] table and before the husband goes to
[17:45] work he gets up and you know he plays
[17:47] with it tickles his wife or whatever and
[17:49] kisses her and everything and says you
[17:50] know you're the you're the best woman in
[17:52] the world right when that son sees those
[17:55] behaviors he was going to want to
[17:56] emulate those behaviors for his wife as
[17:58] as well and just as that is true the
[18:01] opposite is true so if you have a son
[18:04] and he sees a man constantly yelling at
[18:07] his wife always uh kind of downplaying
[18:10] his wife and being mean to her more than
[18:12] likely when he gets into a relationship
[18:14] he'll do the same exact thing to his
[18:16] wife and if a and if a daughter sees a a
[18:20] wife constantly uh nagging to the
[18:22] husband or just trying to tell him you
[18:24] need to do this this and that more than
[18:26] likely she'll grow up and be exactly the
[18:28] same thing so it's a pattern that people
[18:31] pick up on um a pattern that uh that
[18:34] these young ones pick up on and a lot
[18:36] and that's why sometimes you know when
[18:38] you're around certain people and you
[18:40] wonder why they act a certain way right
[18:43] and a lot of times they may not know it
[18:45] themselves but they've picked up on
[18:46] something when they were younger and now
[18:49] they're emulating what that pattern was
[18:51] which is why it's important that we meet
[18:53] the Lord Jesus Christ when God comes
[18:55] into the life all that ceases you don't
[18:57] have to worry about the person's uh what
[18:59] they've grown up in or the behaviors or
[19:01] the genetics that they have all that
[19:03] ceases to exist when Cod comes in right
[19:06] so now that's the physical side of stuff
[19:08] and we love the physical side of things
[19:09] but we want to also look at the
[19:11] spiritual side of patterns right because
[19:13] before you can receive an overflow of
[19:15] blessings God one of God's uh
[19:18] requirements is you have to be a genuine
[19:21] Christian God will only bless a genuine
[19:24] Christian and we're going to get into
[19:25] that later because there's a difference
[19:28] between a blessing and just receiving an
[19:31] increase God will give you an increase
[19:34] but you can have an increase without
[19:36] being a blessing as we see in the story
[19:38] of the Rich Young Ruler when God came up
[19:41] to him and presented him with the word
[19:43] right he rejected the word it didn't say
[19:45] he got worse the Bible says he got
[19:48] better right he got an increase but
[19:50] that's not the type of increase of
[19:52] genuine Christian wants a genuine
[19:54] Christian wants an increase where they
[19:56] can say Amen to the word and God can
[19:58] come and bless them as well that's what
[20:01] a True Believer is looking for so we
[20:03] have to ask ourselves what is a
[20:06] Christian right and what's the pattern
[20:09] that God deals with his people so going
[20:12] back to 1 Corinthians uh chapter 11
[20:14] we're going to read the first three
[20:15] verses to kind of see what Paul uh
[20:19] establishes with that thought of uh
[20:21] being uh uh of being a
[20:24] Christian so we'll
[20:27] do go back here read
[20:30] that so 1 Corinthians 1 says Paul says
[20:35] in the first chapter be ye followers of
[20:38] me even as I also am of Christ now this
[20:43] is interesting we have to kind of take a
[20:44] pause here and look at kind of break
[20:47] down what Paul has said here because the
[20:49] definition that the world uses today as
[20:51] a as a a what a Christian is is someone
[20:54] that follows Christ right but here Paul
[20:57] says follow me right God says follow me
[21:01] not to directly follow Christ so we have
[21:04] to realize that there's got to be
[21:07] something very very very special about
[21:09] Paul in order for him to be able to say
[21:10] something like that right and we have
[21:13] because we have to realize that this was
[21:15] during a time where you know you had
[21:18] Peter you had John you had James you had
[21:23] uh other fivefold ministers uh that were
[21:25] in the ministry right and these were
[21:27] righteous men all filled with the Holy
[21:29] Ghost right so what makes Paul different
[21:32] from these people right and this is just
[21:35] this is just the Bible right so Peter
[21:38] didn't say I mean Paul didn't say follow
[21:40] me and Peter or follow me and a group or
[21:43] follow me and a church he said follow me
[21:45] singular right he identified it as a
[21:48] singular right so just by the Bible we
[21:51] can identify that during that time right
[21:55] the pattern of following with Christian
[21:57] was to follow you had a follow a special
[22:00] man which this in this case was Paul and
[22:03] as Paul you follow Paul it meant that
[22:05] you automatically were following Christ
[22:08] right so we have to recognize also that
[22:12] because a lot of times people have
[22:14] trouble with following a man a lot of
[22:16] times people have a lot of debate and a
[22:19] lot of uh um issues rise up when people
[22:23] say to follow another man and it's hard
[22:25] for us to Humble ourselves but the thing
[22:28] that we have to realize is that Paul
[22:30] didn't pick himself right Paul wasn't
[22:32] the one that picked himself God had to
[22:35] come and pick Paul and in fact Paul
[22:38] wasn't even trying to serve God the
[22:40] right way he was going the opposite way
[22:43] and God said no this is going to be the
[22:45] man that is I'm going to I'm I'm going
[22:47] to use this man in order to show people
[22:50] the way for what this day and age is so
[22:52] right Paul didn't pick himself so
[22:54] anytime you see a big messenger it is
[22:56] not someone that has picked him self God
[22:59] has picked them that's just the Bible
[23:02] right in verse two uh it says now praise
[23:06] you brethen that you had that you
[23:08] remember me in all things and keep the
[23:10] ordinances as I delivered them to you
[23:13] and I like that word ordinance here
[23:15] because I looked up some of the
[23:16] definitions of what an ordinance is and
[23:19] it's a piece of legislation one of the
[23:21] definitions is a piece of legislation
[23:23] enacted by Municipal Authority another
[23:26] definition is an authoritative order or
[23:28] a decree and the last one is a
[23:30] prescribed religious right so what that
[23:33] says is the things that this person says
[23:36] comes with authority right and the thing
[23:39] with authority is usually it it has to
[23:43] come from one person right that's that's
[23:46] some of the that's some of the beliefs
[23:47] that the kings of old if you if you read
[23:49] your history and stuff like that the
[23:51] kings of old had full authority meaning
[23:53] that they were the only ones in charge
[23:55] and when they spoke a word that word had
[23:57] to come that was it no one else could
[23:59] debate it right so this Paul this person
[24:03] that we are uh that we're looking at now
[24:05] had a a level of authority where he
[24:07] could say something that could be an
[24:09] authoritative order of course you know
[24:11] based off of Christ right yes sir so I
[24:15] want to kind of take a take a moment to
[24:17] kind of just tell a little testimony
[24:18] because we also have a prophet in this
[24:20] day right we also have a prophet in this
[24:23] day who lived a life and also gave
[24:25] decrees and also told us things and how
[24:27] to live and I kind of want to tell a
[24:29] story how just to kind of mirror off
[24:31] that where Paul was saying I praise you
[24:33] brother that you remember me in all
[24:35] things um we were out with the youth and
[24:38] we were at this place called pette we
[24:40] was out with the youth kind of um you
[24:42] know letting the youth enjoy themselves
[24:44] and stuff and I was going up to this
[24:46] little um this little food truck and I
[24:49] was going to order me some food and
[24:50] there was someone in uh that was in
[24:52] front of me so I was waiting in line and
[24:53] the person moved and I came in next and
[24:55] there was this young kid uh This Tall
[24:58] Young kid that was standing next to me
[25:00] and as I was beginning to order my food
[25:01] cuz I was next and line he just burst
[25:03] right beside and just started talking to
[25:05] the cast register didn't even look at me
[25:07] didn't acknowledge me or nothing like
[25:09] that and I'm just sitting here like oh
[25:11] my goodness like I'm just sitting here
[25:12] just kind of looking like are you really
[25:14] doing this he didn't look at me he
[25:16] didn't say anything to me and the cast
[25:18] register is kind of looking at me like
[25:19] like he didn't know how to react as well
[25:22] and so I remember I started to get upset
[25:24] cuz I'm like all right this is messed up
[25:26] like how you going to sit up here and
[25:28] just this butt in front of me I'm
[25:29] sitting here waiting out in the sun and
[25:31] you just going to come up here and just
[25:33] so I'm getting upset I'm getting hot and
[25:35] upset and um after the kid he helped the
[25:38] kid out and he walked away and then the
[25:40] cashier started to say some negative
[25:43] things about the situation and I can
[25:45] remember uh in my heart I remembered how
[25:48] the prophet talked about Elisha right
[25:51] and how when Elisha those kids came and
[25:53] they started making fun of the prophet
[25:55] and he spoke a word to them and the she
[25:57] Bears came and tore him up I remember
[25:59] the prophet said that wasn't the right
[26:01] way to act so then I looked at the kid
[26:04] and I said you know what I forgive you
[26:06] right I said I forgive you he said I
[26:08] don't know maybe you w maybe he wasn't
[26:09] raised the right way maybe his parents
[26:11] never told him anything like that but I
[26:13] said I forgive you for doing that right
[26:15] so I need we need an example for this
[26:18] age in order for us to help point us to
[26:21] what it is to be Christlike right the
[26:25] prophet came and revealed to us that
[26:27] what Elisha did was wrong I've never
[26:29] heard any other religious person or any
[26:31] other denomination read the Bible and
[26:34] say that what a prophet did was wrong
[26:36] right so and we're going to continue now
[26:39] to verse three it says but I would have
[26:42] you know that the head of every man is
[26:46] Christ and the head of the woman is the
[26:48] man and the head of Christ is God so
[26:52] here um Paul is further lay laying out
[26:56] this pattern of a head and a body right
[27:00] and so Paul has positioned himself as
[27:04] not not not the head but he's still
[27:06] representative of what God God's word is
[27:09] supposed to be on earth and how we're
[27:12] just following him and it's just a
[27:13] pattern it's just a pattern between
[27:14] these things we we can't come on Earth
[27:17] and do things ourself we need someone to
[27:20] come and lead us we need someone to
[27:21] guide us that's why in your household
[27:23] you know when the father is the head of
[27:26] the household it's his job to kind of
[27:27] take care of things you know and the
[27:28] wife is there to kind of support him
[27:30] right it's uh and that's just the way
[27:32] the uh the pattern that God has uh used
[27:35] right so what the scripture is saying is
[27:38] that Paul was picked by God to be the
[27:41] head of that time right and we know
[27:44] during our time that a man was picked to
[27:46] be the head of our age in order for us
[27:48] to follow as well right and
[27:51] so but the problem seems to come is that
[27:54] when you talk about these things during
[27:56] this age
[27:58] uh people struggle with believing it
[28:01] even though it's something we literally
[28:03] see in the scripture we just read in the
[28:05] scripture an example in Paul and how God
[28:08] used Paul but nowadays it seems to be of
[28:11] it seems to be a struggle for people to
[28:13] believe that a man can come down that
[28:15] God can take full control of and to lead
[28:17] the people into all truths right uh you
[28:21] know a lot of times people will put it
[28:24] into a logical sense where you know
[28:26] they'll say you're just following a man
[28:28] right or this is just a man's uh opinion
[28:31] was just a flesh for man or they say
[28:32] you're worshiping a man they'll say that
[28:34] you're in a cult uh um but my response
[28:38] would be that would be idolatry anytime
[28:40] you worship a man anytime you worship
[28:42] any object or if you worship a man it's
[28:44] considered idolatry right and my
[28:48] question was when Paul said follow me as
[28:50] I follow Christ was that idolatry for
[28:53] Paul to say
[28:56] so right
[28:58] if it was idolatry for Paul to say so
[29:01] why did God keep it in the
[29:03] word amen why did God keep it in the
[29:07] word the Bible says that God shares his
[29:09] glory with no
[29:11] one you see so you have to make sure the
[29:14] scriptures are running in continuation
[29:16] when you have your thought process to
[29:18] make sure you have an expected outcome
[29:20] right so there's got to be something to
[29:23] God having a messenger and getting his
[29:25] hands on a man right for Christians to
[29:27] follow
[29:28] and what I like how Paul said this thing
[29:30] is that Christians cannot follow Christ
[29:34] directly right during this time and age
[29:37] that we're living in Christians don't
[29:38] follow Christ uh follow Christ directly
[29:41] now there will be there will come a time
[29:43] right where you will follow Christ
[29:45] directly just stay with me because
[29:46] sometimes it sounds a little weird there
[29:48] will be a time where you will follow
[29:51] Christ directly right in the new Heaven
[29:53] and a new Earth the prophet said there
[29:55] won't be any more preaching there won't
[29:57] be any needs forh prophets there'll be
[29:58] no need for the fful ministry just going
[30:00] to be you and Christ directly but that
[30:02] day isn't today right that day is not
[30:06] today and that's why it's important to
[30:08] follow the light of your day and that
[30:11] has to be the key theme for any believer
[30:13] is following the light uh uh for your
[30:16] day that has to be your theme and
[30:18] everything you do every I don't care any
[30:20] kind of Christian Endeavor that you have
[30:22] going to church worshiping God reading
[30:23] the Bible always remember that you have
[30:25] to follow the light for your day what is
[30:27] the for our day right and it always
[30:29] comes through a man right in the
[30:31] beginning when Adam was on Earth he
[30:35] didn't need any
[30:36] restoration he was the spoken word of
[30:39] God right he didn't need ministers he
[30:42] didn't have to have people to tell him
[30:44] to be baptized and all this kind of
[30:46] thing he was the direct spoken word of
[30:49] God so that was a different time or it
[30:51] was a different scenario right Adam was
[30:53] all all already perfect and we're going
[30:55] to get to that later so God sending a
[30:58] messenger with the life of the day isn't
[31:00] anything new it's not anything new that
[31:03] he hasn't done before but it does seem
[31:06] strange to people uh in this time and
[31:09] the problem with a lot of the churches
[31:11] today is it's it's a problem that they
[31:15] always had through history right they
[31:16] have no problem following what God has
[31:19] done they've got no problem following
[31:22] what God will do in the future but when
[31:24] you're asking where is God in your life
[31:26] right now no one has an answer they
[31:29] always talk about what he's done they
[31:31] always talk about what he's going to do
[31:33] but what is he doing in your life right
[31:35] now right they fail to see what God is
[31:38] doing during their time and we're going
[31:39] to turn to the message God hiding
[31:41] himself in Simplicity then revealing
[31:43] himself in the same uh preaching 63 I'll
[31:46] give her time to pull it up to kind of
[31:48] see what the prophet said about this
[31:49] paragraph 113 through 114
[31:58] all right there we go and it reads the
[32:00] prophet said it is strange to
[32:02] think how that God does such a thing as
[32:05] that God will hide himself in simpli so
[32:08] simple that it'll cause the wise to miss
[32:10] it a million miles and then turn right
[32:13] back around and that some simple thing
[32:15] in the Simplicity of his way of working
[32:17] and and reveal himself right out again
[32:19] right it's a pattern and it's a simple
[32:21] pattern it's not it's not difficult to
[32:24] understand I thought it made a text that
[32:27] we might study this before we get into
[32:28] the great teaching of the Seven Seals
[32:31] many miss him by the way he reveals
[32:33] himself and I love how the prophet said
[32:35] before you get into great teachings
[32:37] before you get into the deep things make
[32:39] sure you know how to see Christ make
[32:42] sure you have a uh you have like to be
[32:44] able to recognize them or when you get
[32:46] into the seals you just get all confused
[32:48] and then you cause other people to be
[32:50] confused and all a sudden we're back at
[32:52] square one again right so the prophet
[32:55] continued to said in 114 he said now men
[32:58] has their own idea own ideas of what God
[33:00] ought to be and what God is going to do
[33:02] and as I have made the old statement
[33:04] many times that man Still Remains man
[33:08] man is always giving God praise for what
[33:10] he did do and always looking forward to
[33:13] what he will do and ignoring what he is
[33:16] doing and I like how the prophet said
[33:18] that word
[33:19] ignoring which means you recognize
[33:21] something there but you just choosing
[33:23] not to see it
[33:26] amen see see
[33:28] that's the way they miss it they look
[33:30] back and see what a great thing he done
[33:32] but they fail to see what a simple thing
[33:33] he used to do it with and what he's
[33:36] referring to is the pattern how God
[33:38] sends a messenger a man in order to get
[33:42] his church in line right see and then
[33:46] they look forward and see a great thing
[33:48] coming that's going to happen and here
[33:50] here here here's a uh the key part right
[33:53] here why you need a great messenger and
[33:55] nine times out of 10 is already
[33:58] happening right around them and it's so
[34:00] simple that they don't know it so
[34:03] everybody wants to get into the seals
[34:04] not knowing some of this stuff is they
[34:07] looking for things to happen not knowing
[34:10] how do you know it hasn't passed how do
[34:12] you know it's not currently happening
[34:14] people don't know what time it is and
[34:16] it's scary do you know not what time it
[34:18] is because the coming of the Lord is a
[34:20] real event amen it's a real
[34:24] event right so we're going to continue
[34:26] on with with this thought of the pattern
[34:30] cuz we want to start looking at these
[34:32] key things in the pattern so that we
[34:34] know how to
[34:35] recognize where God is in order for us
[34:38] to be ready right and we want to look at
[34:40] this pattern that Paul has stated and
[34:43] compareed to see how God interacted with
[34:46] God in the beginning and I know I've
[34:48] been preaching a lot about Genesis in uh
[34:50] in the Book of Genesis but I tell you
[34:53] this as long if you're following the
[34:55] light for your day and you want to live
[34:58] a Christian Life you want to be blessed
[35:00] you want a life that's not full of
[35:01] stress and turmoil and all that kind of
[35:04] stuff if you read the first two chapters
[35:06] of Genesis of how God originally
[35:09] designed things it takes away a lot of
[35:12] headaches it takes away a lot of
[35:14] Heartache it takes away a lot of stress
[35:16] because God always points back to that
[35:18] that's why when the Pharisees came to
[35:20] Jesus Christ and they said hey uh Moses
[35:23] wrote us a letter for divorcement Jesus
[35:26] Christ response was it wasn't so from
[35:28] the beginning what was he referring to
[35:30] he was referring to back to Adam and Eve
[35:32] there was no such thing as divorce right
[35:35] God never instituted divorce he was
[35:37] referring back to that time if you live
[35:39] during this time you you you'll you'll
[35:42] save yourself a lot of heartache and
[35:43] trouble right so now Adam was a
[35:47] beautiful example of what a Christian is
[35:50] to be and that's why I love to talk
[35:51] about him right he had God which was the
[35:54] representation of his head and Adam of
[35:57] course was the body and we're going to
[35:59] see how Major Prophets or these
[36:02] Messengers these end time Messengers
[36:03] that we have type to the way that God
[36:06] dealt with Adam in the beginning because
[36:08] like we said about a pattern God has to
[36:10] do things the same exact way God's got
[36:12] to treat everybody the same exact way
[36:14] it's nothing new here right so when we
[36:18] look at this pattern there's two things
[36:20] we want to we there's two things that we
[36:21] want to recognize first one is the head
[36:25] right and the head will always follow a
[36:27] particular pattern and the head is
[36:29] always a person right it's always a
[36:32] person two is the body that's the second
[36:35] thing and by following and by the body
[36:38] following the head you'll see that it
[36:40] will follow a particular pattern as well
[36:42] these things have to dovetail together
[36:45] that's why when God when God sent a
[36:48] messenger it's because he expected there
[36:50] to be a people to receive that message
[36:53] he didn't send that message for no
[36:55] reason that's why he told the disciple
[36:57] if you guys want praise the stones will
[37:00] raise up in Praise something has got to
[37:02] receive the message someone has got to
[37:04] receive this thing there has to be
[37:06] another recipient on the other side of
[37:08] God's message in order to bring the word
[37:10] of God to pass because the Bible says
[37:12] God can't lie all right so we're going
[37:15] to look at these different elements and
[37:17] we always have to start with the head
[37:19] because the body has to follow the way
[37:21] of the head so if you noticed um
[37:25] biologically um when you move move your
[37:27] hand or when you move your foot you're
[37:30] actually what you're doing is in your
[37:31] mind you're telling your foot to move
[37:32] and you're telling your hand to move and
[37:34] it starts from the head and then the
[37:36] body acts accordingly so we always got
[37:38] to start with the head first and then
[37:40] you get a response from the body right
[37:42] these patterns have to Dove tell each
[37:44] other now this isn't an all-inclusive
[37:46] list about about these types and stuff
[37:48] but there just some things that I
[37:49] believe God has inspired me to kind of
[37:51] say um and the first thing the first
[37:55] element that we're going to look at is a
[37:56] head must have thus saved the Lord right
[37:59] a head has to have the word of the Lord
[38:02] and nothing else it can't have an
[38:03] opinion and it can't be mixed with any
[38:05] other ideas it can't be mixed with any
[38:07] other words it has to be thus sayith the
[38:10] Lord and the re and the body pattern
[38:14] that follows that is the body has to
[38:17] receive the message right they've got to
[38:20] receive the message the second element
[38:23] that we're going to look at is the head
[38:26] always comes with a message of warning
[38:28] right they always come with a message of
[38:30] warning and warnings are perspective
[38:33] depending on the cut how the recipient
[38:36] is cut out right meaning a warning is
[38:39] actually good news for a Believer right
[38:42] when a warning comes to a Believer is
[38:44] actually good news to them right or if I
[38:47] can say it this way a Believer should
[38:49] not be afraid of the coming of the Lord
[38:51] if when people are talking about the
[38:53] coming of the Lord that makes you afraid
[38:55] there's something wrong with the way
[38:56] you've been cut out
[38:58] right the coming of the Lord is bad news
[39:01] for the unbeliever right it's a bad news
[39:03] for unbeliever but the but the but the
[39:05] believer takes that message a different
[39:08] kind of way they prepare themselves a
[39:10] different kind of way and the last thing
[39:12] we're going to look at is uh aead is a
[39:16] Onan message it's only one person that
[39:19] comes it's only one person that's on the
[39:21] scene and the body only responds to that
[39:25] one person the pattern of the body
[39:27] follow they stand behind that one person
[39:29] they won't stand behind anything else
[39:32] right so we're going to start our
[39:33] journey now in
[39:35] Genesis uh
[39:43] 215 going right back to the
[39:47] beginning right Genesis 2:15 through1 17
[39:50] and we're going to read this and kind of
[39:52] type these things so verse 15 says and
[39:55] the Lord God took the man and put him
[39:57] into the garden to Eden to dress it and
[39:59] to keep it verse 16 says and the Lord
[40:02] God commanded the man saying of every
[40:04] tree of the garden thou mayest freely
[40:06] eat but of the tree of knowledge of Good
[40:08] and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in
[40:11] the day that thou eatest thereof Thou
[40:13] shalt surely die all right so here we
[40:17] see a great example of a thus sayith the
[40:20] Lord now God didn't say thus save the
[40:22] Lord because he is the Lord all he did
[40:24] was just give the word but when a
[40:27] Prophet comes on to the scene a
[40:29] characteristic theme you'll see with
[40:30] them is they'll say thus sayith the Lord
[40:32] which means it is the voice of God right
[40:35] it's a uh when a when a prophet says
[40:37] thus sayith the Lord and something comes
[40:39] to pass you got to listen to that person
[40:41] because that shows that God is backing
[40:44] that man and that is the voice of God
[40:46] right so now God was the word here that
[40:50] I said but when a major prophet or a
[40:52] messenger comes on to the scene the word
[40:54] is fully with them God had already
[40:56] proved that when uh Moses uh when Moses
[41:00] had come onto the scene um and I'll
[41:04] turn I'll turn and read this uh verse
[41:07] right you don't have to turn to it
[41:08] though uh it's in
[41:11] um Exodus 4 uh chapter 16 and uh chapter
[41:16] yeah not chapter 16 chapter 4 verse 15
[41:19] and 16 and I'll just read this and it
[41:21] says and thou shalt speak unto him and
[41:23] put words in his mouth he's talking
[41:25] about Moses and Aaron and I will be with
[41:28] thy mouth and his mouth and will teach
[41:30] ye teach you what ye shall do and he
[41:33] shall be thy spokesman unto the people
[41:35] and he shall be even he shall be to thee
[41:37] instead of a mouth and what did God say
[41:40] to Moses and thou shalt be to him
[41:43] instead of God right so now God has
[41:46] elevated Moses into this position and we
[41:48] all know that Moses was a major
[41:50] messenger for that time now if you read
[41:53] over in Psalms uh and this is a verse
[41:55] that brother Solomon likes to uh uh say
[41:58] a lot of times it says ye are Gods right
[42:01] and it's true it says you are children
[42:03] of the most high but when you look at
[42:04] that Bible First when it says God's it's
[42:06] little G but when God spoke to Moses
[42:09] here in verse 16 it's big G which means
[42:12] that it's God's word God's word is with
[42:15] this man you may be a Christian you may
[42:18] be anointed but God has a particular
[42:21] position and place that he's put this
[42:23] person uh um in control and that you
[42:26] have to consider what his word was right
[42:28] so now Adam and Adam and his wife they
[42:31] were God's children when God put him
[42:33] into the garden he created them and he
[42:35] wanted them to um uh furnish the garden
[42:38] and take care of the garden take care of
[42:40] the garden they were his children but
[42:42] the thing was they didn't know what tree
[42:44] to eat from when God spoke these words
[42:46] to them they had to be instructed on
[42:48] which one was okay to eat and which ones
[42:51] they could not eat right though they
[42:53] were God's children so we see a a
[42:55] pattern with these Special with these
[42:57] Special mer these special
[43:00] Messengers uh the word is with them
[43:03] right God had the word God had the
[43:05] instruction of the day and and how they
[43:07] were to act in the garden right it
[43:10] wasn't with Adam it which represented
[43:12] the church right the word was with God
[43:15] and God had to instruct the church this
[43:17] is how you act in the garden right so
[43:20] when a messenger comes and speaks a word
[43:23] it's nothing different than what we've
[43:25] already seen in the Bible how God has
[43:26] treated Adam
[43:28] and I can predict the way you receive a
[43:31] messenger is how you would act if you
[43:33] was in the garden if you can receive a
[43:35] messenger for the day that comes with
[43:37] thus saith the Lord it'll be a glorious
[43:39] time in the garden but if you cannot
[43:41] receive a message from the me a message
[43:43] from the messenger of the day it would
[43:45] be turmoil in the garden right so they
[43:49] were even though they were children's of
[43:51] God they didn't they start to be be
[43:54] instructed and we want to further kind
[43:57] of show this thing is that when Adam and
[43:59] Eve fell uh I was talking to my dad
[44:02] earlier today and he was uh he had a
[44:04] conversations with uh with his neighbors
[44:06] and they was talking about a word having
[44:07] a really good time in a word and one of
[44:10] the things they came across was the
[44:12] question that they had the topic they
[44:14] were talking about was why wasn't Cain's
[44:16] sacrifice accepted and my dad was kind
[44:20] of showing them that you know when Adam
[44:24] fell what did he do he went to get some
[44:27] fig leaves put him on himself and he put
[44:30] it on his wife and then God came around
[44:33] and said Adam where are you and he saw
[44:35] them fig Lees and he took them off right
[44:38] Adam didn't know what to do to please
[44:40] the Lord he needed God right in order to
[44:45] tell him what to do in order for him to
[44:47] be accepted Adam didn't have it in
[44:49] himself even though he was God's son all
[44:53] right so these Messengers they come to
[44:56] tell us what to do not to bully us or
[44:59] anything like that but just to show us
[45:01] what is acceptable to God right you
[45:04] would meaning you wouldn't know how to
[45:06] accept god without a messenger you
[45:08] wouldn't know what is acceptable to God
[45:10] without a messenger you wouldn't know
[45:12] what it is to be a Christian you
[45:14] wouldn't know what pleases God and what
[45:16] not pleases god without being instructed
[45:18] how to do it a lot of Christians try to
[45:20] do it but God uh if God rejected Cain's
[45:24] way and Adam's way then he'd have to
[45:26] reject your way today as well right so
[45:29] you can't please God with your own
[45:31] thoughts and Adam wasn't trying to do
[45:33] put those figes on cuz he was trying to
[45:35] be disobedient he was really trying to
[45:37] fix the situation so it takes more than
[45:39] just sincerity and trying to be a good
[45:42] Christian it takes the word the exact
[45:45] thus sayith the Lord this is what please
[45:47] God regardless of your feelings right so
[45:52] when the word comes forth to this
[45:54] special messenger the body also has a
[45:57] work to do or a pattern to follow so
[46:01] when God spoke these words to his
[46:02] children when he told them uh to eat
[46:05] from this tree and not to eat from that
[46:07] tree there was no questioning after what
[46:10] God had said right meaning Adam response
[46:13] to what God Said was amen God said don't
[46:16] do this and do that go Adam said amen no
[46:20] questioning no argument so you see he
[46:23] just responded to the word and just
[46:24] received the word as it was my question
[46:27] is how come when a prophet now comes
[46:30] into our day and says something all of a
[46:33] sudden there's always a debate wow wow
[46:38] if we're following the pattern of God
[46:40] and we're trying to be like Adam who was
[46:42] the original Christian when God spoke a
[46:44] word that settled it but nowadays when a
[46:47] prophet will come on the scene or
[46:48] someone uh this messenger speak a word
[46:51] now there's always a struggle there's
[46:54] always a struggle of reasoning about
[46:56] what he said and the problem that we
[46:59] have with that is mixing mixing is what
[47:02] has created this problem the world today
[47:05] is mixed with Believers make Believers
[47:07] and
[47:08] unbelievers um the prophet typed today
[47:11] to uh Sodom and gomorrah's time where
[47:14] Abraham represented the believer lot
[47:17] represented the make believer and Sodom
[47:19] and gomorah represented the unbelievers
[47:22] right and the key thing that God said to
[47:25] uh for Abraham was to separate yourself
[47:28] when God called Abraham Abraham brought
[47:31] lot trying to mix God didn't call for a
[47:35] lot though and that's what a lot of us
[47:37] try to do when God gives us the word we
[47:39] try to mix the word with something else
[47:42] and all it does is Just Cause issues
[47:44] because when God brought lot along it
[47:46] said all their people was fighting each
[47:48] other until God until Abraham finally
[47:50] said you know what I'm going back to the
[47:53] original word lot choose where you want
[47:55] to go I'll go the opposite opposite
[47:57] direction when they separated themselves
[47:59] from each other notice God came to visit
[48:04] Abraham that's right when he fully
[48:06] separated himself right to the word of
[48:08] God he came to visit Abraham right you
[48:11] got mixing uh you got mixing in the
[48:14] church world uh you have mixing in your
[48:17] own with your own ideas the prophet told
[48:19] the story of the Indian who said you
[48:22] know I find that there's always a battle
[48:24] in my head there's a white dog and then
[48:25] there's a black dog
[48:27] and brother brandom had uh asked him a
[48:29] question he said well which one wins he
[48:30] says the one that I feed the most all
[48:32] right so in order to get rid of the
[48:34] mixing you got to feed the white dog the
[48:36] most and just feed on what he wants to
[48:38] eat and that'll bring about the promise
[48:40] that you're looking for right so before
[48:44] we can receive the word or receive what
[48:47] a prophet a major prophet for our day
[48:49] has to say has to say we need a body
[48:53] change right we need a body change
[48:56] because our body have been mixed with so
[48:58] many generations and you can look at
[49:01] your past Generations in your history
[49:03] and you may have people in your life
[49:05] that you're not uh uh particularly proud
[49:07] of and you got all those genes mixed
[49:09] inside of you so we need a born again
[49:12] experience just as Adam was cuz Adam
[49:15] wasn't brought to the World by sex he
[49:16] was spoken Adam was the direct spoken
[49:19] word of God which means God could trust
[49:22] Adam to say Amen right so we need a born
[49:26] Born Again experience in order to be
[49:28] able to receive the word for our day
[49:31] right and you say well why is that
[49:33] important because your overflow may come
[49:36] in a particular way that you're not
[49:38] seeing and if you can't say Amen to the
[49:40] word how are you going to receive
[49:42] it right for example you know you pray
[49:46] and you're like Lord I want to be rich I
[49:48] want money I want a million bucks or
[49:51] whatever God's like okay I got you
[49:53] you're my kid I got you and so when your
[49:56] next paycheck comes in after you pay
[49:59] finish paying your ti after you finish
[50:01] paying your offering after you finish
[50:03] paying the rent got the food kids taken
[50:06] care of and now you looking at your
[50:08] little portion like this is my money God
[50:10] comes around and Taps your shoulder hey
[50:13] take that money that you got and when
[50:15] you when you when you're walking out
[50:16] through the week I'm going to inspire
[50:18] you who I want to give you that money
[50:20] too and you're sitting here like what
[50:23] this is my money amen this is my money
[50:26] but what God is trying to do is he's
[50:28] trying to see can he trust you right cuz
[50:32] when you can then say Amen to the word
[50:35] in the way that God delivers it so now
[50:37] you're going down the street and you see
[50:39] the guy and God's like this the person I
[50:41] want to get I want you to get that money
[50:43] to you're like man I was really going to
[50:45] do I was going to buy me a boat with
[50:46] this money I was going to buy me a new
[50:49] motor or you know a go-kart or something
[50:52] right I was going to do something with
[50:53] this money but because you've got a new
[50:55] birth and can say he Amen to the word
[50:57] you can then hand that money over you
[50:59] hand it to the guy God says thank you
[51:02] goes on his way 6 months down the road
[51:04] he comes back knocks on your door says
[51:06] hey you know when you gave me that money
[51:07] my business was going under now we're
[51:10] successful and I want to give you some
[51:11] money uh to thank you for that thing so
[51:14] now you received your overflow it didn't
[51:17] come the way you thought it was but
[51:19] because you said amen to the word by a
[51:21] new birth God could work with you amen
[51:25] so it's important for us to be
[51:27] uh it's important for us to be um born
[51:30] again and what I said is nothing that is
[51:33] not scriptural because it's just like
[51:35] the uh the shemite woman when uh Elijah
[51:38] came and told her hey man bake me a cake
[51:40] she's like look we about to take these
[51:41] two cakes and die like we already got I
[51:44] already got our Graves dug up in our
[51:47] Stones we about to eat these cakes and
[51:48] he said no feed me first and when she
[51:51] said amen to the word she got an
[51:55] overflow
[51:57] yeah is it not the word right so we need
[52:01] a new birth to be able to say Amen to
[52:03] whatever God comes down and says we just
[52:06] want to respond I don't understand what
[52:08] it is amen the new birth says I don't
[52:11] care what it I don't care about my
[52:13] understanding of it I'm just saying Amen
[52:15] to the word right God always knows how
[52:17] to take care of his kids right um so and
[52:21] that's where that's where one of the
[52:23] biggest problems that we uh that we kind
[52:26] of that we kind of find today is that
[52:30] when God gave adam that word of what to
[52:32] do what tree to eat from and what tree
[52:34] not to eat from you notice that his wife
[52:38] was inside of him it wasn't until she
[52:42] came out afterwards that in the next
[52:44] verse so when Adam said amen to the word
[52:47] his wife was on the inside she said amen
[52:50] too right and this was one creature it
[52:53] wasn't two people right and so when when
[52:56] Eve when God took uh his wife outside of
[53:00] him we notice that Adam took care of his
[53:04] wife Adam loved his wife she didn't lack
[53:06] anything she didn't have anything that
[53:08] she needed to go extra to do God Prov uh
[53:12] Adam God and Adam provided her a place
[53:14] to stay and gave her food um the the
[53:17] Bible says there was gold there you know
[53:20] ladies love diamonds she had probably
[53:22] diamonds as big as watermelons right
[53:25] that she could every girl that wants to
[53:27] get married at engagement they want a
[53:28] diamond she probably had diamonds as big
[53:31] as watermelons as much as she could see
[53:32] right so she had everything for her not
[53:35] only that the prophet said on the cool
[53:37] of the evening God will come down and
[53:39] fellowship right so God brought his wife
[53:41] to come and fellowship with the Lord she
[53:44] had everything but somehow it wasn't
[53:47] enough and I'm telling you right now
[53:49] without the baptism hold of the Holy
[53:51] Spirit the word will not be enough for
[53:53] you you need a new birth you need a new
[53:56] chain you need God to come inside of
[53:58] your heart what the what the new birth
[54:00] is is God coming inside of your heart
[54:02] and you going back inside of God and now
[54:05] you're one creature just like it was in
[54:07] the beginning with Adam so that now when
[54:09] God speaks a word you say Amen even when
[54:13] you're struggling the Bible says that
[54:15] Christ uh he'll say amen for you on the
[54:17] inside right and it ensures that you'll
[54:19] get to your destination when you get
[54:21] weak Christ will come around and say oh
[54:23] no no no he says amen we believe the
[54:25] word God is always looking at the head
[54:29] right that's why when God came to
[54:30] Abraham and told him you're going to
[54:32] have you're going to have a child and
[54:34] Sarah laughed behind the tent Prophet
[54:36] said God would have took her out but she
[54:37] was connected to Abraham's amen right
[54:41] and when you receive the baptism the
[54:42] Holy Spirit your amen is connected to
[54:45] Christ and Christ has already said amen
[54:47] to the word right you have nothing to
[54:51] fear amen we're talking about God's
[54:54] pattern here and what it and uh for
[54:57] believers uh and so the next thing that
[54:59] we want to look at is with a major
[55:02] prophit is God sends them with a message
[55:04] of warning right so we've had great
[55:08] reformers in the age we've had great men
[55:10] that have come and reformed and given us
[55:12] different kinds of messages and stuff
[55:14] you know we had Luther right Luther was
[55:17] a reformer but he couldn't warn us
[55:19] because he didn't know what time it was
[55:21] we had Wesley God uh God sent Wesley to
[55:24] come and reform but Wesley couldn't warn
[55:26] us because he didn't know what time it
[55:28] was we had Pentecost and great men in
[55:30] the Pentecostal experience but they
[55:32] couldn't warn us because they didn't
[55:34] know what time it was right Luther's
[55:37] group Luther's group they were justified
[55:39] by faith they said we ain't believing in
[55:40] the Catholic Doctrine we justified by
[55:42] faith go home and smoke a pipe and be
[55:45] okay all right true and it was the word
[55:48] for that day Wesley's group could shout
[55:52] hey we've got it we've got it God is
[55:54] with us go home and crack open the here
[55:57] all
[55:58] right uh Pentecost speak in tongues
[56:01] coming to church speaking in tongues and
[56:04] then go to work that same day and curse
[56:06] their co-workers out all right and they
[56:09] could they could sleep around with
[56:11] people in the church and the next day
[56:13] come to church prophesying just living
[56:15] any old kind of life doing any old kind
[56:17] of thing right no we needed a prophet to
[56:21] come with a warning message right not
[56:24] just gifts not just great IDE ideas but
[56:27] we needed a prophet to come with a a
[56:29] warning message and in the restoration
[56:32] of Pentecost they had prophets they had
[56:35] the fold Ministry they had prophets they
[56:37] had teachers they had pastors they had
[56:38] evangelists but it wasn't enough right
[56:41] we needed someone special to come uh and
[56:45] reveal not only reveal the seals to us
[56:47] to tell us that we're in the end time
[56:49] but to make sure we were ready for the
[56:52] coming of the Lord which means that we
[56:53] were living right for his coming right
[56:56] that's why the prophet comes he says
[56:58] don't drink or don't smoke or don't do
[57:00] these things it's because he's trying to
[57:02] prepare you for the coming of the Lord
[57:04] right we needed to know when the end
[57:06] time was or where the end time was to be
[57:08] able to be right before when God comes
[57:10] here because uh in Past Times you go to
[57:14] a lot of churches everyone reads their
[57:16] Bible and everyone's always talking
[57:18] about the coming of the Lord that ain't
[57:19] no secret everyone always preaches get
[57:22] ready for the coming of the Lord the
[57:24] Pentecostals re preach the coming of the
[57:25] Lord but the problem is does your life
[57:28] prove that the Lord is coming which is
[57:31] what God is looking for God is looking
[57:32] for your life to speak that he is coming
[57:35] not just profession right because the
[57:38] problem with the denominational church
[57:40] is they'll profess the coming of the
[57:42] Lord is and do the same thing that the
[57:44] world does so now the warning message
[57:47] has no
[57:48] effect it doesn't mean anything because
[57:51] you doing the exact same thing we're
[57:53] doing you see what I'm saying they uh
[57:56] they'll they'll drink smoke and do all
[57:58] these kinds of things and not live a
[58:00] life it shows that they don't they don't
[58:02] believe the coming of the Lord uh is
[58:04] here but the believer will dress right
[58:07] she'll act right when this messenger
[58:09] comes comes in he's not just going to
[58:11] give him a message just to tickle their
[58:12] ears and get blessings and all these
[58:14] kinds of things no he's going to warn
[58:15] them of the coming of the Lord and
[58:17] you'll see that this group will act
[58:18] different they'll respond different in
[58:20] situations when they're when uh great
[58:23] temptation is brought their way they'll
[58:24] respond the right way people will wonder
[58:27] what is different about these people
[58:28] right right their lives show they
[58:31] believe God is coming right their lives
[58:33] show that they believe God is coming
[58:35] right and so remember we're watching for
[58:38] patterns here so did God warn Adam and
[58:41] Eve that God give him a message of
[58:43] warning he sure did he told him that if
[58:46] you eat from this tree you'll be
[58:48] successful and if you eat from that tree
[58:49] you will not be successful a messenger
[58:52] always has to have a a warning message
[58:55] and a warning can have multiple purposes
[58:58] because in Adam's day he didn't need a
[59:01] restoration as we said before he was
[59:03] already perfect he was always perfect
[59:05] but a warning also come so that you can
[59:07] keep your blessing you got to be warned
[59:10] to make sure you stay uh uh once you've
[59:13] been restored that you keep your
[59:14] blessing uh and we can look in the Bible
[59:16] at The Prostitute when she was on the
[59:18] ground and people were getting ready to
[59:20] Stone her to death and Jesus came and he
[59:22] sat down and he said the person without
[59:24] sin throw the first stone and they all
[59:26] walked away and he said where are your
[59:28] accusers neither do I accuse you right
[59:31] that was a restorative restoration
[59:33] message that restored her back right
[59:35] that restored no matter what she did in
[59:37] her life no matter what mistake she had
[59:39] in her life that message when God said I
[59:42] neither do I judge you that restored her
[59:44] back to a Adam condition right but God
[59:48] ain't ended
[59:50] there God didn't stop it there the next
[59:53] thing he said was go and send sin no
[59:57] more right so what he did was he brought
[1:00:00] the original message you can eat from
[1:00:02] this tree but you cannot eat from that
[1:00:05] tree he brought her the message in order
[1:00:07] for her to stay in that restorative uh
[1:00:10] position that she was in so we needed
[1:00:13] prophets to come to keep us on track and
[1:00:16] we're going to talk about en closing
[1:00:17] we're going to talk about the last
[1:00:19] element in this pattern is that it is a
[1:00:21] Onan message right this is a onean
[1:00:24] message God doesn't send multiple people
[1:00:26] with different kind of ideas that's why
[1:00:28] you have some people that believe in the
[1:00:30] baptism of the the Father the Son and
[1:00:32] the Holy Ghost right it's not three God
[1:00:35] it's not three Gods it's one God it's
[1:00:37] one God with one message right God's
[1:00:40] voice in the garden was only one voice
[1:00:42] there wasn't another voice right it
[1:00:45] doesn't matter how many motivational
[1:00:47] speakers are during this time or phds or
[1:00:50] religious leaders or religious ideas cuz
[1:00:53] everybody seems to have a word from the
[1:00:55] Lord nowadays
[1:00:57] right everybody seems to got a word from
[1:00:58] the Lord everybody seems to hear
[1:01:00] something from God but this group right
[1:01:03] here they've patterned theirselves after
[1:01:05] the word that if anyone speaks something
[1:01:08] outside of the messenger that God has
[1:01:10] sent they won't receive it right no
[1:01:14] matter how much the uh serpent tried to
[1:01:16] come to Adam whatever he told Adam Adam
[1:01:18] never believed what he said Adam never
[1:01:21] believed what he said right so there's
[1:01:23] the there there's the pattern that
[1:01:25] that's the pattern for a Christian a
[1:01:27] Christian follows the messenger of their
[1:01:29] day as they follow Christ and this is
[1:01:32] why we believe in the message of the
[1:01:33] hour this is why we believe God sent a
[1:01:36] man William brandom as the prophet of
[1:01:38] our age in order to prepare us for the
[1:01:41] coming of the Lord to teach us what it
[1:01:43] is to live right we wouldn't know what
[1:01:45] to do we wouldn't we wouldn't know how
[1:01:48] to live we wouldn't know how to act we
[1:01:49] wouldn't know how to respond to the word
[1:01:51] we wouldn't know how church order was
[1:01:53] supposed to be we wouldn't know how to
[1:01:55] say Amen to the word we wouldn't know
[1:01:56] how to love our neighbors and and not
[1:01:59] just love people that loved us but love
[1:02:01] people that don't loved us the prophet
[1:02:02] said you know if someone wanted to kill
[1:02:04] you even if they wanted to kill you you
[1:02:06] should be able to love them back right
[1:02:08] we needed a messenger of that day to
[1:02:10] come down and uh speak those words to us
[1:02:13] so just to reiterate what we've gone
[1:02:16] over so one the messenger has thus saved
[1:02:19] the Lord as God did have in the
[1:02:22] beginning brother brandham came with
[1:02:24] thus saith the Lord right and he proved
[1:02:26] it right in the body which was Adam or
[1:02:29] Christians they received the word just
[1:02:31] as Adam did in the beginning right we're
[1:02:34] talking about the pattern of what a
[1:02:36] Christian is today the second thing is
[1:02:38] the messenger comes with a warning that
[1:02:40] causes the Christians to not only be uh
[1:02:43] prepared for the coming of the Lord and
[1:02:44] to get in the step but to stay in Step
[1:02:47] just as God did in the beginning with
[1:02:49] Adam and Eve and just as Adam did Adam
[1:02:52] took heed to the warning in the
[1:02:54] beginning and the Christians of the day
[1:02:56] take heed of the messenger right in
[1:02:59] order to stay in step and the third
[1:03:01] thing is the messenger is a oneman
[1:03:03] message it's not two groups or anything
[1:03:06] but God was the only person with the
[1:03:08] word of the Lord in the garden he was
[1:03:10] the only person that could bring the
[1:03:11] word of the Lord and the Christians
[1:03:13] today only receive that one voice they
[1:03:15] won't receive any other voice and I I I
[1:03:18] I I'll end it in this
[1:03:20] as cuz brother quu has a great uh
[1:03:24] testimony of how he came came to the
[1:03:26] church I believe he was on his school he
[1:03:28] was going to school and uh he saw sister
[1:03:31] Amanda and he saw the way that she was
[1:03:34] dressed and that attracted him right not
[1:03:38] not no worldly attraction but just a a a
[1:03:41] Christian attraction right and so he
[1:03:43] went up to her and said you know where
[1:03:45] do you go to church and he asked her
[1:03:47] these questions but then he asked her
[1:03:48] the most important thing who is your
[1:03:50] messenger and when she said brother
[1:03:52] brandham he said this is the church I
[1:03:54] want to go to
[1:03:56] this is the pattern of a Believer a
[1:03:58] Believer is not just attracted to and
[1:04:00] it's good it's good to come to church
[1:04:03] it's good to wear the right clothes it's
[1:04:05] good to live the correct life it's good
[1:04:07] not to drink and not to smoke and all
[1:04:08] these things those stuff is good it's
[1:04:10] good to have a it's good to live a holy
[1:04:12] life but who are you following who is
[1:04:15] your messenger amen all right we'll end
[1:04:18] it in a word of
[1:04:20] prayer Lord Jesus Lord your word has
[1:04:24] come forth oh God
[1:04:26] Lord we know that it's only you oh Lord
[1:04:29] God that can bring Revelation oh Lord
[1:04:31] Jesus as Peter when you ask the question
[1:04:34] of who they thought you were oh Lord God
[1:04:36] and Peter said the correct thing oh Lord
[1:04:38] Jesus Christ Lord you said flesh and
[1:04:41] blood has not revealed that to you but
[1:04:43] my Father which in heaven has and Upon
[1:04:46] This Rock will I build my church oh Lord
[1:04:49] God lord you have a church that is built
[1:04:51] on Revelation oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord
[1:04:54] we know Lord God that we cannot live
[1:04:57] this word without you oh Lord God lord
[1:04:59] we can't say it's it's it's it's a
[1:05:01] struggle for us to say Amen is some
[1:05:03] things oh Lord God but Lord we're
[1:05:05] dependent upon your grace oh Lord God
[1:05:08] lord if there are those that have not
[1:05:09] been born again oh Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:12] help them oh Lord God receive this free
[1:05:14] gift oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord no one
[1:05:17] has to pay for it oh Lord God you don't
[1:05:19] have to you don't have to work for it oh
[1:05:21] Lord Jesus Christ you just said repent
[1:05:23] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:05:25] Jesus Jesus Christ and this birth would
[1:05:27] come oh Lord God which would make us a
[1:05:30] new creature oh Lord God we will be able
[1:05:32] to recognize the messenger you sent in
[1:05:34] our hour we will be able to recognize
[1:05:36] the message that he said oh Lord God we
[1:05:38] will be able to say Amen to all the word
[1:05:41] oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord that will
[1:05:44] prepare us oh Lord God for when you come
[1:05:46] again oh Lord God and when you create
[1:05:48] your new the new heavens and the new
[1:05:50] earth oh Lord God and there's no more
[1:05:52] sin oh Lord God we would be a people
[1:05:54] that would be comfortable living there
[1:05:56] oh Lord God whatever you would say oh
[1:05:58] Lord God we would end it with amen oh
[1:06:01] Lord God whatever Direction you would
[1:06:03] have oh Lord God we would end it with
[1:06:05] amen oh Lord God lord I pray that the
[1:06:07] message comes across oh Lord God lord
[1:06:10] you see those in the audience oh Lord
[1:06:12] God they have they have needs oh Lord
[1:06:14] God some of them have Wayward kids some
[1:06:16] of them want a deeper relationship with
[1:06:18] you some of them are sick in the body
[1:06:20] Lord I ask that you would touch them oh
[1:06:22] Lord God I ask that you would be with
[1:06:24] them oh Lord God Lord help them to
[1:06:26] realiz help them to be a genuine
[1:06:28] Christian oh Lord God and that as the
[1:06:31] first step would take care of all the
[1:06:33] disease oh Lord God in the beginning
[1:06:35] when Adam was this perfect example of a
[1:06:37] Christian there was no disease Lord
[1:06:39] there was no sickness oh Lord God there
[1:06:41] was no fear oh Lord Jesus Christ you had
[1:06:44] everything there for him and you were
[1:06:46] his protection oh Lord God and as we
[1:06:48] receive your word today oh Lord God
[1:06:51] according to your pattern you have to
[1:06:52] treat us the same oh Lord God I ask that
[1:06:55] you will bless bless the uh rest of the
[1:06:56] service in the precious name of Jesus
