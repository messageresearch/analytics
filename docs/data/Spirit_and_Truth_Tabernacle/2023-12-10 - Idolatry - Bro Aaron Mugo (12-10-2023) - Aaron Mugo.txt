morning we know we want you there Lord Jesus we ask this in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen thank you sister thank you all the musicians um it's great to be back here in spirit and Truth am um our uh our little Ministry trip that we just had went really well in beckway it's good to be home good to see everybody around here and I know we're going to our second home over there in Indiana going to have a safe trip back but Lord willing um and uh it's just great to see you guys uh I want to uh let's just go to our Bibles actually it's going to be in habach I'm going to give you some extra time to find that this morning because without the you know I'm I'm kind of used to using a digital Bible these days and uh it makes you kind of lazy as you can see my physical one is right behind me I don't even I haven't even looked at it but um it's great to see how God just uses technology to help him out you know um don't want to condemn that at all uh so it's habac chap 2 verse 19 and 20 uh goes like this woe unto him that saith to the wood a awake to the dumb Stone arise it shall teach behold it is laid over with gold and silver and there is no breath at all in the midst of it verse 20 says but the Lord is in his holy Temple that all the Earth keep silence before him you can have your seats so uh I was I was honestly struggling to figure out what to speak uh this morning because I've spoken on this topic a few times over the last couple months and uh and I was thinking surely God you wouldn't have me just preach the same thing over and over again but apparently yeah so we're just going to follow his will this morning uh my topic is called idolatry and uh I just want to take us through the scriptures on that thought it's uh it the first time I studied it I thought it was just like something to be in my notes that just to refer to later but then after I started getting into it I realized there's a lot in there in the Bible that can feed people it's not just for the minister to sit back and hold it in his notes for reference but it can actually feed people so that's what I want to do this morning that's what we're in the business of doing so uh the the longer I study the more the lord gave me on this and uh I like when he does that and I I decided I'm just going to dial it back all the way back to the very beginning uh before there was even time and then let's look at where idolatry first appeared amen just follow with me here all right we're going to go to Isaiah 14 how art thou fallen from Heaven A Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which is weaken the Nations for thou H has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will and these are key words here I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high so if you've read the if you've heard uh the message at all you hear Brother brandham talking about idolatry he says it's anything that gets between you an idol is anything that gets between you and God so we're going to follow that metric going through the Bible now when the devil decided to elevate himself to the point where he was thinking he's like God he wanted to be worshiped like him and you got to you got to recognize God did make the devil perfect he made him perfect and and and there's actually scripture that says he was made perfect but sin was found in him now I want you to think back and think about the I didn't have a picture of it in my in my slides but the stature of a perfect man the way it's built is like you know you have your faith virtue blah blah blah blah blah and then you get towards the top and it has godliness right up there right now the devil he took godliness and then since sin was found in his heart that godliness is something that we should all have right we want to be like God but then he took that and allowed it to be perverted and he took it and it became Pride instead of godliness and since it was Pride instead of godliness that's where it turned South now whenever it got to that point the de see the devil was made perfect right that's what the Bible says and god is perfect so the other angels are looking at the Devil and they're looking at God and they see Perfection and they see Perfection but this is perfection with one flaw and that one flaw the Angels completely got deceived and started to worship the devil instead of God right there that became their Idol right there so if you follow through the scripture uh let's go to uh uh this quote brother Bram said in 1955 the Seal of the Antichrist did you know that in heaven that the devil was God's right-hand man in the beginning that Lucifer the son of the morning was given power and the reason that he brought sin into the world he was able able to take something that God had created and pervert it back to into an evil thing which started all this trouble in the beginning then God back before the foundation of the world was ever laid when he seen what Satan done in his pride went over in the north and set up a kingdom and fought against Michael and his angels do you see it the right-and man of Almighty almighty God was Lucifer the son of the morning the first God granted him almost co-workers with him he was a coworker partly equal with him only Satan could not create God is the only Creator but Satan took something that God created and perverted it back into something else evil so back back when God created the devil he said okay first he's perfect and then he had almost the exact same set of powers and abilities that God had on his side and he trusted him with that now whenever Satan he he gets elevated to that point you got to realize um all Angels were were made perfect they were made already following the word they were made to where they already worshiped God and they didn't have to come back from a a downtrodden condition like we are here on Earth right and yet God he did whenever he created angels He did not issue a proclamation over them the way he issued a proclamation over us right the proclamation over us what does it say it says we will not be deceived because we are already elect we were already part of God from before the foundation of the world and he creates these perfect beings angels and they get deceived something that he created perfectly 2/3 of the Angels actually follow Satan out of heaven when they get cast out because they didn't realize who God was between him and and God made that complete mistake and then they got deceived and we're so blessed this morning God just decided and and I don't know why he decided that cuz I'm already coming from an imperfect State and he decided I'm not going to be deceived you're not going to to be deceived you don't have to worry about what the devil throws at you you don't have to be worried about being deceived because God already said you won't in your already fallen condition he already saw where you were before he created you he saw where you were and he's just referencing back to that and he said this is my child whatever I send forth it will come back to me and it will not be void he's going to be perfect just like what God intended amen amen amen we're going to dial it back to Revelation we're still following the devil I like to follow him through the scripture because he likes to hide you know and I like to expose where where exactly he's at Revelation 123 uh 3 um and there appeared another Wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon this is where the devil gets cast out a great red dragon having seven heads and 10 horns and seven crowns upon his heads and his tail drew a third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the Earth this is the devil and the angels getting cast out of heaven after they follow the devil in Ezekiel um he's not called The Devil in in this uh uh chapter of Ezekiel 28:12 he's not called the devil there it's called the king of Tyrus but it's still referring to the devil it says son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus and say unto him thus saith the Lord God thou seest up the th full of wisdom and perfect that's what I was talking about perfect in Beauty thou H has been in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was I covering all those stones right there and uh I'm just going to cut to the next slide gold the work workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared for thee in the day that thou was created so way back there he had all those stones as a covering and and he was made perfect by God in job you're going to see that even though the devil got cast out of heaven and he was given those Powers by God even though all of that happened God wasn't scared you realize God didn't take his powers away and be like oh no he's going to deceive people no the devil kept all of his powers he kept all of that status that he had beforeand God wasn't scared he said take two-thirds of my angels leave me with a third and then he he he goes and he takes that power only only only difference is he cannot create right you know right and God wasn't scared amen amen and yet the devil he has the audacity in job we're about to read chapter 1:6 now there was a day he he has the audacity now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them he just walked on in nobody stopped him you say Sons or God are here Satan's here too Satan's here too don't forget he came to church with you this morning amen and the Lord said unto Satan whence comest thou then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro on the earth and from walking up up and down it the audacity God didn't even take his power from him in John 12 now you're I'm just I'm building this up so you can see Satan's status has not diminished John 12:31 now now is the Judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be capped out so he's been called a king back in e in Ezekiel he was called perfect way back in Isaiah actually in Ezekiel is also called perfect in Isaiah is talking about how he Sealth up the Sun and over here in John it's saying he's a prince so he still has all of this status in Ephesians chapter 2 I think he's called a prince again wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience so his status never diminish Saints and then in Daniel chapter 10 verse 12 and in in it's this is a this is this is a time when Daniel is actually praying to God because he sees something in the scripture and he wants to know when it's going to come to pass so Daniel is just he's reading there and he decides I'm going to pray and ask God exactly when this is happening and you're going to see exactly why it took so long for God's answer to come through said then said this is the Angel who finally came to Daniel and told him hey here's the answer and this is why I'm late he said then said he then said he unto me fear not Daniel for from the first day that thou did set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy God thy words were heard and I am come for thy words so day one when Daniel Prayed God sent an answer what happened but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one in 20 days but Lo Michael one of the chief princes came to help me and I remained there with the kings of Persia so he's still being called a prince here and he was able to stop the blessing from getting to Daniel for 21 days what do you think that angel was thinking while he's fighting with the devil for 21 days 21 days it's like God sent me on this path God ever sent you somewhere and you don't know why but everything you try to do is coming up against you right there he tried to tell you to do something and you don't know why it seems like he disappeared but don't worry sometimes help is on the way and you just haven't seen it yet sometimes he has sent his answer and you haven't heard it yet you got to stay in the promise and keep praying believe that he's going to come through believe that he's already sent that answer to you before you even prayed he said before I call before you call I will answer you right let him answer you in his time yes you can see the angels are still fighting the devil to this day still having trouble with him now back I mean the topic is idolatry I want to stay on topic right here so be certain of God 1959 brother brandom says we may not think that we are Idol worshippers but we are and the government endorses it people today are Idol worshippers because they worship idols some of them worship movie stars for Idols some worship money for idols and some worship television stars as Idols but all that you put before God is an idol let it be whatever it may be now I'm not one to change the words of the Prophet but let it be what ever or whoever it may be because he's talking about a lot of live human beings he's saying movie stars he's saying uh television stars it could be anybody it could be someone in church it could be anybody anything that gets between any human or any object or any um intangible object that gets between you and God is your Idol now I know some people these examples he's listing at it's like it actually makes me think of of this this story brother Brandon was talking about I think he was in South Africa and he he's he's doing these campaign meetings and a lot of these South Africans I don't remember it was a 30,000 or something decide to uh they they get healed and then they convert to Christianity and they start to follow because of his ministry so powerful and then uh after the meetings have been going on for a while he he actually sees this young boy his name is Thomas and he's walking and he's coming to the meeting and Thomas says that he's a Christian but uh brother brandham sees that he's holding an idol in his hand actually he's just carrying it along just like this just holding an idol like this coming to church and he can see that it's carved out and he says well he gets a translator and he asks him like okay I thought you were a Christian Thomas he says yeah I'm a Christian and then he says well why why why are you carrying the idol then what are you doing and he's like Thomas says I'm a Christian if I pray to God and he doesn't answer me I'm going to use this Idol you guys any have anything in your lives like that we have that all the time it's like when God doesn't answer me I'm going to use that little Idol over here you know why because that's my safety net that's what I've been holding on to I knew that before I knew God God might have known me before the foundation of the world but I don't remember him I remember that I remember when I was sick I used my um my my health insurance plan yeah and you know if I pray and God hasn't answered me fast enough about being sick I'm just going to go to the doctor I'll be fine you ever done that before you ever thought that before Oh if I crash if my car crashes I'm not worried all my bills will be paid because I have an insurance plan or if I can't afford something and God hasn't provided for for me fast enough put it on that Visa put it on that American Express don't have to worry about that because God will my little God is going to come through for me if he doesn't right we do that all the time this is a this is Lea everything comes easy to us and we expect it to be really fast right that's true amen now how do people get into the point where where they're where they're actually worshiping idols and I I want to um actually want to I want to break that down because if you look in the Old Testament you you see people who it's like step one they're Israelites they're read LED out of out of Egypt and then God's doing all these wonders in the wilderness they get to the promised land they're killing people left and right and then they get their land and it's like a beautiful thing then you know two books later everybody's worshiping Idols it's like how'd you get there right and then they worship idols then they have a good King who knocks all the idols down then they worship idols again then they do it again and that goes on and on and on till the end of Malachi right and it's like how did they do that how did they get to that point good thing we have a prophet who broke it down yeah I want to jump to slide uh 38 actually in presuming 1962 says the human soul cries out for something it knows that there's something that brought it here it knows that there is something that's beyond here they know that they come from out of the night and they go back into the night and they want to know where they come from and where they're going now if that hunger is in there you can never get it by blighting your mind you know I heard someone was in a meeting here sometime ago someone said just let your mind go blank now now this this is something dangerous I want you to follow word for word exactly what I'm saying the person he's talking about was in a meeting so this morning we're in church we're in the right place right and then he's saying that someone in the meeting said that they were in a church environment the words going forth and this person blanks out their mind just look right straight up towards the skies let your mind go blank you'll get an experience and no doubt but what you do that's right but you get an experience but what an experience you see when you do that you just open your soul to Satan he'll give you something that's true what did I just say Satan came to every meeting he comes to church with you right and if you come in here and blank your mind and let whatever happened cuz oh I'm looking left and right sister Susie got healed I'm looking at over brother over there just got the Holy Ghost I want a blessing from me that's a good thing to have that hunger to have God's blessings coming down in the service and to see it working among the people that's a great thing to have but how are you supposed to get that that's what we're trying to get into next next quote Christianity versus idolatry he says now idolatry it's still today we find I find people coming to the Altar and with blind sayings of blind teachers that'll say just open up forget everything make your mind a blank you'll become an Elijah you'll become this that or the other what a lie you don't come to God that's to open up your soul to all kinds of devil Spirits get in don't you do that you must remember that there is a devil and he impersonates Christ to the letter almost amen now he he's going to describe uh um he's going to describe exactly how people came to the point where the H how how they worshiped Idols whenever they went into the temples and went when they went to these places back in the past in the Bible times and you're going to see that it's a parallel to what he's talking about in those previous quotes same tape 1961 now idolatry is a strange thing down Through the Ages we've had it ever since the beginning of time now the order for this idol worship is the man that sets up the idol fixes the idol then he goes in and prepares himself for this great worship now he believes that the idol is made in the image of some God that he has never seen he's without form so he believes is in the image of this Idol and he makes to this God that he makes to this God now don't let that believe you the image is in the image of the myth mythical god that he believes in then he goes to before this Idol and prostrates himself and believes that the god that's an unseen person comes down into this Idol and he believes that he talks to God through this Idol that God brings himself into this Idol and answers him back so that's just like people coming to church bowing their heads because they want something from God and then they empty out their mind it's like it has to be through whatever this Idol is and he believes that whatever and that person believes whatever happens in the service whatever happens to their Spirit automatically came from God that's not always the case and many of you teachers here that's took the mythology even those gods they had battles with one another they claimed and everything in those days now in other words the God hypnotizes himself from a supernatural standing into this Idol and speaks back to the worshipper through this Idol and the worshipper in some kind of a builtup emotional sense believes that the idol speaks to him to his heart and he's forgiven of his sins and what more through this Idol which plainly shows it's the devil it's the devil that does it and they don't just do things half-hazard some of them does but some there's some true worshippers of these things for example I could tell you some stories of how those devils and those Idols perform all kinds of things make blood come out of things and everything else they are devils now I I believe this is a this is a quote where he actually explains it this is how you're actually supposed to supposed to approach God right and God has a provided lamb 1964 it's the answer to that question now you see you just let yourself believe him now come don't let your mind go dormant as people says don't do that you don't come to God half-hazard you come to him intelligently with his word you bring the word before you and say Lord I made you made the promise I've asked you to open my eyes let my my faith stop the Lord Jesus tonight may he turn to me and tell me like the woman they met many years ago and you believe with all your heart so when you go to pray to God in the service and I'm not just trying to scare you guys I mean it's it's a fact the devil will try to deceive you in church he will try to deceive you at home when you're praying it doesn't have to be if it's at church it could be anywhere you could be praying to what you think is God and it's actually the devil trying to turn your mind and make you dose see the devil if he can convince you while you're praying to what you think is God if he can convince you that whatever answer you're getting in that prayer is the right thing to do even if it's contrary to his word then he can get you to do anything you'll be like you ever heard people who say I prayed and God told me to do this or I prayed and he told me to go there it's like okay you're an alcoholic and he told you to go to the bar why why would he do that that doesn't match his word if it doesn't match his word then it couldn't have been from God that means their prayer should have had the word presented before them whenever they went to talk to God in the first place then if they get an answer that doesn't match that that doesn't match the word then automatically you know it's not God right amen amen so I I was on this topic and I was thinking how on Earth am I going to get this this this portion of this sermon across and I was I was like I don't know what title to beat so I told Becca about it and she was just like I got you a title next slide it says an idle mind is the devil's workshop don't forget that English major right there don't forget that make sure you don't empty your mind and let the devil put anything in there amen amen now next next quote it we're we're going to talk about how what kind of idol what things that uh we humans make into idols and um it's from 1960 the unchangeable God now the thing is with the people is the way God Appears many times we want to make an idol out of god let's stop right there now um we do this we do this all the time now if we if we pray to God and have I don't know how to get this across so have you ever met or heard somebody read it online it might be in the comments it might be anywhere but somebody talking about God and they say how could God let those children die you ever heard something like that yeah it's like oh another school shooting Where's God When that's happening well you kicked him out of school so he's not there so don't be salty but then they then they look in the then they look in the newspaper it's like okay Wars and wars and stuff going on like that where is God when that's happening and then some some Christians are at the point where they're like oh well my God loves everybody he just loves everybody so much so we should let those kind of Sinners and that kind of sin come into church because he just loves everybody that's how you get churches who support lgbtq rights because they don't recognize that they should have looked in the word and it said God doesn't condone that stuff that's your own fabricated idea of what God is they say my God wouldn't send anybody to hell that's your that's not God that's not God my God told me that he would send them to hell my God told me that there's a law and you should follow his word and if you don't follow his word there's a consequence because that's what a law is and my God doesn't change no matter what age it is [Applause] amen so they want to make an idol out of God they make an idol out of what they perceive to be God at that point if they're not worshiping God then they're worshiping an idol and it's like my God and then some people get to the point where they're like okay I have a lot of bad baggage in my life and it's sad it's really sad to see that I have baggage too we're human we have flaws we have character flaws from our family traits and then they decide oh well God can't change that that's just part of my that's just part of me so you're telling me the god that you created in your head is so weak that he can't take care of that he's so weak he can't heal you he's so weak that he can't touch your situation or change your family situation you're telling me the god you created in your head is has limits that's not exactly what the Bible told me it told me that it can fix anything anything he has no limits because he is Unlimited in power am we want to make an idol out of God some people they go and pray to God and brother bram's about to talk about it it's go they go to pray to God and then uh they want to treat him like a genie like Aladdin's Genie you know or something like that it's like anything you want just wish for it and then they go and pray to God and because he didn't say they could have it they they think they should cast him aside that's not how that works God is God God is Sovereign amen now if your definition of God when you pray doesn't match the god that's in the scripture who can change anything that you you you Des desire Lord who has unlimited power but also has the wisdom to give you what you need in the hour that you need it if you don't recognize that God acts that way then that's your fault cuz he said it in plain letter in the King James Bible any other Bible too as long as it's the Bible now the next slide it says we ask God to do something and then he must do it just the way that we ask it or we'll say he never answered when we do that we weaken our faith in God and we weaken Our Testimony when we do not take him at his word his word said that follow the word now in in in the Bible uh Paul is actually talking to these Romans in the Book of Romans he's he's talking to them and the Romans are used to uh worshiping a bunch of um uh like a whole Pantheon of gods right and they're used to worshiping uh I always have to Jupiter Saturn Uranus all the all the all the nine planets they're they're used to worshiping as deities and the the I think the C top of all of that I think Jupiter was like the king of the Gods for them and they worship all of these people and Paul has to break it down for them and undo all of that idolatry that they're used to doing and they're used to following that's in their society all around them so he's talking to them and he's breaking down exactly how they get to that point where they're worshiping God the the fake Gods as opposed to the real God that he knows in Romans 1:19 it says because that that which may be known of God is Manifest in them for God hath showed it unto them so they were shown these things says for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seeing being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened so they're creating their own Gods out of nothing professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of The Incorruptible God into an image made like to corrupt corruptible man into birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things so here here back back in habc Chapter 2 where we started the very first scripture it says woe unto him that sayith to the wood awake to the dumbster it shall teach so it's actually people who decide to create something with their own hands and the reason they're creating this thing with their own hands is because they want something they can control they want to have control over their own worship I feel to realize if you actually worship a deity and believe that the deity is Sovereign then there's nothing you can do to change their personality and to change their their their attributes and you it down into one you can't it it down into that because it's a it's a living it's something with so much power and a mind that's so much higher than yours and yet they try to make it into something that they can touch with their own hands and then they pour gold and silver all over it and then call it special and it's like that's not what what are you doing like if you actually believe that that thing had the power to save you then you shouldn't be able to make it with your own hand you made it in your backyard why are you worshiping to that that doesn't make any sense and people do the same thing nowadays they try to take money they try to make as much money as they can you know we get to the point where we just rely on things that we can control I can control how much money I make if I work harder right and that means that I created this thing in my bank account that I rely on when things get tough amen that's that's my right there some people make make children I haven't done it yet but some people make children and then they idolize their own children to the point where they give them more time and more resources than they give to God you're supposed to give your children to God not give your life for your children all the time you realize if your child goes one way don't just don't be like well we got soccer practice on Sunday guess I'm missing service like come on what are you doing you have to follow God God is your god not your child am and their Eternal destination isn't bent on B bent on whether they went into soccer practice or not who cares make sure they come to church amen idolizing their children how much time do we give our children and I recognize it's not hard it's not sorry God forbid I say that it's not easy to parent it's not easy at all to parent and I haven't done it yet but I respect parents to the m and it's so much harder to do that in this age right now that we're living in I respect parents it's been harder than ever any other age to raise kids these days but you can't idolize them to that point amen so don't idolize your kids do we check that off don't idolize God check that off the list too don't idolize money health insurance right now some people here's another one they idolize themselves so they get to the point and you see this stuff on social media all the time right and I'm not even on social media but I've heard people say this stuff have you ever seen if if uh that you need you ever seen those statements like you need to learn to love yourself you need to learn that you're a special human being you're a butterfly you're an amazing person and if there's anything that people don't like about you then it's their fault it's their fault they don't understand they're the ones causing you trauma you need to be you and love yourself so they take themselves to that point and then they're like oh if you go to therapy you're just going to be a perfect human being and happy all the time you know what that's fake there is nothing you can't do anything in your own life to perfect yourself that leave the Perfection to God let him use you so that comes completely at odds with the Christianity that we know the Christianity we know says God will do the perfecting of us he'll accept us in a broken condition and he'll make us better but they decide that no matter what condition you're in if you have a negative personality trait it must have been your relationship with your father it must be your mother who did that to you maybe it was but God can make it better let him act that way idolizing themselves to the point where they just spend everything they have and on on me time quality time it's like they don't live for others see eternal life is living for others not living for yourself so that's completely at odds with exactly how the scripture is supposed to work they stop living for others they stop caring about others and that's exactly how we get to the place in this day and age where people just they can show up at a school just like this one and then shoot it up because they don't care and they don't value human life what do it matter it's not me that's dying it's them I decide that they die today amen making many gods out of themselves that ain't how that worked and also along the lines of um This Modern Age it talks about God as if well they take one or two attributes of God and then they push those so hard to the point where they forget all his other attributes I I was already talking about this how they they just say God God loves people so God is love amen he loves everybody now for God to love the world he died for everyone yes um but then they take that one step farther and they say that he'll never condemn someone to hell and then they create their own idea of God there was this there was this thing I saw online and and I'm I'm not trying to preach on everything online I'd be here all the rest of my life like clearly you shouldn't follow everything online don't listen to it not everybody in the world is doing that one thing that you saw that was messed up I I I understand that but there was this thing where um uh has anybody ever heard the the Catholic uh Apostles Creed you know I believe in the and then communion of the Saints blah blah blah so that's bad enough but then somebody took that and did a filter to it and then they modernized it with um with uh the lgbtq rights included in there now some of you might have seen this it was a lady lady priest I guess um and and she she's reading this out and it's called the sparkle Creed in instead of the Apostles Creed it's the sparkle Creed and so they took the sparkle Creed and it says uh I believe in actually I'm just going to pull it up hang on I had it in my notes I may as well the sparkle Creed there we go it says I believe in the non-binary guard God whose pronouns are plural so they took they there's a lot to unpack in the first sentence the non-binary god whose pronouns are plural so they're saying that this God identifies as Jesus as God the father and as the Holy Spirit and that makes him non-binary and that makes his pronouns plural so you should call him they like what in the world did you do to get that I believe in Jesus Christ their child who wore a fabulous tunic and had two dads it's like where in the world did you get that from are they reading the same book that I'm reading do they come up with and and they take something and they twist a couple details and they decide God's Own identity for him and then they said that's my God that I created right there and that's who I worship so I'm not going to read that whole thing it's very disturbing um it gets worse [Applause] so in influences 1964 brother brandom's talking about a young man he talked to and I think it's fitting that it's a young man because this is a young modern way of thinking that people tend to do it said I young I heard a young man tell me not long ago he said you know God loves me so much brother brandom he just lets me do anything I want to he don't care next verse says I hear so much today about God being a good God he is I'm not disputing that he is a good God but he's also a god of wrath his Holiness requires righteousness his Law requires judgment and if there's no judgment to law law is of none effect what good would it do to say it's against the law to run this red light down here without being a penalty behind it see it would be no law they couldn't do nothing about it there isn't a penalty there is a penalty of trans for transgressing uh God's laws and it will you'll have to pay to the utmost far thingss before you're brought out I'm going to skip down to uh slide 81 said a young a young fellow said and this is the token 1964 a young fellow said the other day God loves me so well God is a good god that is true but he's also a god of anger too he's a god of judgment he's a god of wrath we fail to get that you make him so good till you make him some old daddy grandpa he's not no Daddy grandfather he is almighty God and he don't have no grandchildren he has Sons and Daughters of God not shook hands and adopted in you must be born again in the blood applied it's Sons and Daughters of God not some old soft grandfather let his kids get by grandchildren get by with anything he is not a grandfather he's a father yes sir every child must be born of him he's a father of Correction so getting to this point uh well actually this's this other verse it's talking about the the idols that people make of their own hands in in in Psalm 135 ver1 15 says the idols of the heathen are silver and gold the work of men's hands they have mouths but they speak not eyes have they but they see not they have ears but they hear not neither is there any breath in their mouths they that make them are like unto them so is everyone that trusteth in them that hits hard you decided you see see the Pharisees did the same thing actually they looked at the Old Testament and they saw that Jehovah was there and they saw the way he was acting through Moses and they they they they took his word that Moses had given them and then they got to the point where they tried to make their own selves perfect in that word so their Idols they they first off they had a false conception of God so that was an idol because they they didn't realize when God came it was Jesus In the Flesh they didn't realize that that was God and then when they were they were persecuting their own countrymen and making them live through the live these laws that supposedly God had made up they got to the the point where uh they weren't following God's word and Jesus had to call them out on it yeah so the biggest thing I think they were idolizing was actually themselves cuz they they made these laws they they they love the law of Moses so much and that it wasn't a bad thing to love to love the word of God but what they did with it and what it produced in their lives proved that their Spirit wasn't right right amen so they they they start to they love the law so much they start creating new laws and then they tried to make their countrymen follow those so they made their their bodies perfect and clean make sure to wash your hands after you do this don't touch this don't touch that kind of person don't do this don't mingle with any and they did all of these laws so well to the point where they made their bodies a like some sort of fake Temple right you know and it's a corruptible body so it it has limits on how perfect it can be right and yet they decide to continue doing that for themselves this scripture right here it says the one I just read it says they have ears but they hear not they're not hearing the word neither is there any breath in their mouths they that make them are like unto them so their bodies were just like those Idols that the Heathen were making right right because they're not speaking the word they're not hearing the word they're not seeing what's being manifested right in front of them because they're so caught up and just how perfect and amazing they are so um let's see we're going to look at some examples um of exactly how the devil turned different things that God gave as gifts into idols and um before in order to start that I'm going to go back to habak 1 verse1 15 says they take up and these are it's it's using fishermen as an analogy to say how people worship idols they say they take all of them with the angle they take up all of them with an angle angle they catch them in their net and gather them in their drag therefore they rejoice and are glad therefore they sacrifice unto their net and burn incense unto their drag because by them their portion is fat and their meat plenteous so God gave these fishermen a gift it's like I've given you the tools to catch your own fish and that's the net and the drag whatever you're using to go catch fish and then they're like thank you God then they go get their fish and they're like let me worship this net it's like doesn't make sense they forgot where the net came from they forgot Who provided that thing in the first place amen am amen that's true amen who gave you that in the first place so the first example is actually going to be uh in 2 Kings 18 um let's go down to uh H yeah Second Kings 18 so they come there there's a king that comes uh around and it's a young man I guess and it's uh his name is Hezekiah and he's a king of Judah and the first thing he does is he starts to cast out Idols from the kingdom and it's a good thing it's a worthy plan but you got to realize this Idol that he's casting out is actually something God gave the people way back in the book of Exodus or Deuteronomy somewhere and uh this Idol you're going to recognize it when I read it let's jump to verse three and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord according to all that David his father did he removed the high places and break the images and cut down the Groves and break in pieces the Brazen serpent that Moses had made for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it and he called it nushin so this Brazen serpent God recognized that there were fiery serpents that you know he they they they bit the children of Israel because of their Disobedience and and not only did he cause judgment to fall on them them but he also provided healing you know because he's a good God they deserved what they were getting but he divid decided that there was going to be a way for them to find their healing so he puts that in the camp it's the he tells Moses to to make a Brazen Serpent and puts it up there and then they get their healing and after the fiery serpents this whole episode's done someone had to have kept that thing and they said well Moses made it so it must be holy debatable but then after that they take it one step farther and it's like it's a gift from God yes but one step farther they take it and then they start to burn incense to this fiery Serpent and they can point back at the scripture and tell anybody who questions them Moses made it so it must be fine yeah but this King comes and he has to be a Godly King and he recognizes this is not right because Moses never told us to burn incense to it Moses never told us to take it to that level it was for healing at that appointed time at that time that's like the equivalent of us um you know God forbid somebody goes to brother brandom's grave and they said okay well was it his left hand or his right hand I think it was his left hand would touch people and then it would he'd be able to tell exactly who's sick and who needs healing and the bumps and the stuff would appear on his hand it'll be like somebody going and getting that hand and expecting it to do healing for them and starting to worship it that's extreme right right right people do that spiritually I'm just going to talk about it so people do that spiritually they decide that their healing if they need healing or or not not healing I'm going to get out of that people decide that if they're going to go to church then they recognize that brother brandom was God's voice to this age amen I believe that but they decide that the only way they're going to hear from God is through brother brandom yeah yeah and then they get to the point where they're just listening to tapes only and then they get to the point where it's like if I go to church and this is their Idol right there they decide if I go to church I'm not going to be fed unless I hear from the tape only yeah and if there's anybody else who tries to talk to me I'm not going to listen to it people do the same thing on the opposite end of the spectrum they decide if this brother's not preaching I'm not going to be f yeah if that sister isn't playing the piano I just don't really know if I'll get a blessing at all and then they get to the point where they expect certain things to happen in church and they decide ahead of time there's no point in going there this XYZ isn't happening like I realize that God works through different people in different ways there are people who've been healed listening to tapes amen I believe that amen there are people who' been healed through music or specific preachers or they had their prayer answered or God spoke to them through specific Ministries but when you start to idolize that Ministry and decide God can only work through that Ministry then you're in the you're on the wrong road now there's some Churches I've been to I'm going to I'm GNA keep going with it certain churches I've been to and I'm not condemning this church I'm not coming after any individual I'm just saying what the root of idolatry is churches I've been to where their ptor passes on godly man amen believe in his ministry fine and then they decide that they're not going to look for the next Ministry or whoever the pastor was leading they decide they're only going to play recordings of that Pastor and that's the only way they're going to get fed because apparently when that Pastor died God died like you can't hear a service after that because that guy that come on now don't limit God he can work through anyone he can work work through a 5-year-old it doesn't matter let him work and then they limit God and decide that's the only way things are coming to me and then it's like they're trying to tell god well you're going to work through that channel right that's the way you're going to do it I'm not going to receive it otherwise it's like that man who was drowning I think there was not drowning but there was a flood and then there you know his house is about to go under so a Robbo comes by he says no God's going to help me I prayed and then the Robbo goes on then a motor boat comes by the Coast Guard comes by a guy with a helicopter comes by just grab the ladder come on up no God's going to me don't worry about it and then he dies and his house is gone he comes to heaven what's God going to say I sent you a rowboat I sent you the Coast Guard I sent you a helicopter and you said no and then you come back to me you can't blame God at that point if nothing's happening in your life you can't blame God if you're sitting in a church like that and you get to the point where your children are going away from the church be like God I committed them into your hands yeah but did you really feed them though right right did you take them to the right atmosphere did you give them what they needed when they needed it did you give yourself what you needed when you needed it amen you decided that God's going to work that way and that's just it's just it's the same exact thing as what Catholics do because they go to church and and I have quotes on this I'm just off my notes whatever but they go to church and I used to go to a Catholic school and this is what you see whenever you walk in a Catholic Church anywhere you go because I've been been to them around the world and you walk inside and if it's a big enough Catholic Church like a cathedral and everything you're going to see um statues or pictures of saints lining the walls Going Down the Walls like that and you'll see uh in front of the Saints you're going to see these uh little uh shelves right there and it'll describe the saint and it'll say what they did and then what they do is each Saint is specialized for specific reasons so you go to them for specific reasons and then you get to what what a good Catholic will do is when they want to pray to God they go and grab a candle they pay a bit of money they get a candle it's like this big and then they light it and then they take it to that sent the the saint and whichever Saint will answer their prayer they go and then they place it right there and then they light it and then they pray to St uh Cecilia mother Mary whoever it is they'll pray to that person and that person's supposed to talk to God for them it's the same thing tell me how that spirit's different you decide that you go to church and it's like oh I'm not spiritual enough I'm going to have brother whoever pray for me cuz he has a gift of talking to God you realize God wants to talk to you he wants to answer your prayer like it doesn't you shouldn't diminish your own prayer because you have that access to him what do you think he died for so you can talk to him directly am amen he did away with that priest nonsense like we shouldn't be dealing with that be like oh I got to take my lamb and have it sacrificed by the high priest to make sure he absolves my sins no we don't do that that's not what that's about you shouldn't have somebody pray for you if you haven't prayed for yourself amen amen now I recognize God can work through somebody praying for someone specifically he told first thing he told Paul when he had scales on his eyes go to ananas He he'll pray for you and that'll be like you might have that Revelation but 90% of the time come on now yeah pray for yourself yeah you're like oh I got to go to this service in this camp in this state in this country and make sure that brother who's having service there lays his hands on me otherwise it's not going to happen ridiculous amen and we decide that they work that way you know some people people idolize their um their parents and I I used I didn't well as a child I thought like a child right as a child I was like my mom and my dad they were the epitome of spiritual to me because they were my spiritual guides and that's how it should be right but in growing up I I always thought well if anybody in our family is making it to Heaven it's Mom that's what I thought you know I was like it's definitely her and then I I I used to think that she was just like the epitome of what spiritual means and if I could just get on her level and it's good to have um mentors but if it it got to a point where I realized I needed God for me I needed my relationship with God myself now you can do that when you think like a child but when you don't realize that it's for you no matter what your age is then yeah you're in trouble right there so there's actually I'm just going to try to find that quote because it's relevant to what I was just saying I know I said I was going to talk about examples then I only did one so uh another example I think I talked about it last time I ministered here it was somewhere in July and it was talking about the CH children of Israel um when they left Egypt they were given extra things by the Egyptians and it was their jewelry it was the earrings and all that stuff that they took from the Egyptians and then those same uh pieces of jewelry Aaron fashes them fashion them into the golden calf that was another example and um it's just a gift of God that was turned into something bad hang on give me a second I'm going to look through these you know what get that here right so my last example is actually from Daniel chapter whatever uh chapter one now I'm going to preface this pre preface this um when Daniel gets captured by the uh Babylon Babylonians in Nebuchadnezzar's King he he changes their names of the of of these people he wants to serve him that were used to be Israelites uh because he's just trying to change their entire identity and um he decides that he's going to name Daniel Bel shazar right and when when it comes to the point where he has this dream and his wise men cannot answer this question of what the dream means Daniel comes and he interprets the dream by the help of the Lord and he's still calling him Bazar because he thinks his identities changed but that's not it's that's not how identities work but Daniel is still Daniel and he's still praying to God so the blessing came through Daniel but Nebuchadnezzar still sees Daniel as Bazar and the reason he sees him as Bazar is because I think brother brandom says that uh Nebuchadnezzar worshiped Bel shazar as his God so he thought that Daniel was his God right there so whenever the whenever um you look at Daniel chapter 2: 46 now Nebuchadnezzar's reaction whenever Daniel interprets the dream says then the King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshiped Daniel and commanded that he they should offer an oblation and sweet odors to him the king answered unto D Daniel and said of a truth it is that your God is a god of gods and a lord of kings and a revealer of Secrets seeing that thou couldest reveal this secret so he recognize that recognize that God is working through Daniel but he deifies Daniel to the point now when down the line I don't know it's probably the very next chapter he creates this image of Bazar and he tells the three Hebrew children Daniel's friends he tells them to worship that in the handwriting on the wall 1956 brother brandom says now I want you to notice as soon as the king saw this vision and he made it he forced every person in his kingdom in his domain to worship this image he made an image and it's believed by Scholars which I do believe that a spirit filled person would see it that he worshiped Daniel is what he did and he made an image to Daniel and he called it Bazar he called Daniel Bazar which was the name of his God and he made an image and forced every person to worship that image so if you recognize the spirit behind what Nebuchadnezzar is doing and you recognize how it manifests itself in this day you see people who decide God works through a certain Ministry or a certain person or a certain thing and then they try to hold the whole world accountable to that thing it's like they create their own version of how God operates and they said if you don't do it this way you're wrong and you're not going to go to heaven you're not in the will of God read between the lines here it's scary it's the same exact thing and I just want to say that we should be immune to this like there there are way too many examples of how God operates in the Bible it is varied he appears in many different ways he he talked to many different people and we shouldn't be beholden to something like that shouldn't let the let the devil dictate how he gets worship you see the devil he doesn't care what Avenue you take to worship the devil God doesn't take second hand worship the devil does Amen cuz as long as you're not worshiping God all avenues lead to the devil it doesn't matter everything I just named leads to the devil so he doesn't care how he gets you to fall to the left and right like clearly being in the message is not enough because in the message could mean worshiping somebody indirectly it's like oh well that must be the eighth messenger so everybody needs to follow him right that means it leads to the devil cuz it's not matching what's in the word amen amen the devil don't care musicians can come back the devil does not care how he gets his worship are there things in our lives that we need to think about and double check and be like God I I don't know where all my time is going but it's not going to you for some reason I need to get that out of the way I don't know where all my resources are going but they're keeping me from paying towards your kingdom they're keeping me from paying my tithes from offering as much as I want to offer they're keeping me from uh giving my gift to you like if you have a gift for the Lord and you're not using it for God for some reason what is that that you're using it for he gave it to you he's the creator of that gift he gave you arms legs he gave you limbs you can work every day you can make your money you can he gave you a spirit to worship Him by yes yes and we fail to do that over and over again whenever we don't take him at his word and listen to what he has to say come through his path let him work through whatever path he wants to work through let's bow our heads just let God use you let him let him work in your life Heavenly Father we thank you for the word that came forth this morning uh we thank you for uh you just being present in our lives and we want to make you free to op operate however you wish to operate Lord let's not limit you Lord please help us to follow your will and to recognize when it's you calling and you answering prayers and not some lie of the devil not something that was fabricated or made up that doesn't even match your word Lord

doesn't matter if angels fall if angels wrestle wrestle with your word and get deceived by the devil we are not supposed to be deceived we can lean on that promise Lord Lord as we go to our homes and um through our jobs throughout the week Lord please help us to keep our focus on you and not be distracted please uh keep us safe to and fro Lord please help our Spirits give us what we need through

that amen amen amen God bless you brother amen Aaron uh very timely uh words there uh just so much uh that was said this morning amen into that um on idolatry you know the prophet was saying how uh it'll be so close it'll deceive the very elect and uh we're living in the most deceptive time that ever been uh he wants to deceive us into worshiping the idol worshiping him he read the scripture there how he would Place himself here he would Place himself there the were people are worshiping the devil thinking that they're worshiping God yes that's a real bad place to be amen so and he gave us amen so many wonderful examples and things he said how uh uh the truth uh is in the uh to say the stature of a perfect man you have uh Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience God brotherly kindness godliness but you take one ingredient the godliness and replace it with pride godliness is humility yes amen but if you replace that with pride begin to get in mhm and you have a whole you it it it looks good it looks good to the outer man it looks good to the Natural Eye it looks good to the mind but that Pride begins to defile the whole body yes yes amen defile the whole image amen and you go along you're doing everything you're shouting you're going to church and it all looks good it looks Prim it looks propit it looks good but it's false he say he that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and truth so truth is revealed said there can't be anything between us and God I'm reminded of that song Say Jesus on the main line yes tell him what you want amen but we don't want nothing in between us and God or is that line is going to be distorted amen amen when we go to him we got a wrong number one digit off yeah yeah yeah and the devil will answer amen oh W amen amen one digit off yes amen and the devil say hello it's me Jesus right amen oh Lord I need this and I want to do this I do this and he say okay do this this this and he lead you down the wrong path and you the Lord told me nine times out of 10 when you when a person and you go back and look in the word Lord ain't tell him that whole thing I can't when the person say the Lord told me ain't nothing else I can say that's right yeah ain't nothing the pastor can say ain't nothing ain't nothing Deacon can say ain't nothing nobody when they come and say well the Lord told me well brother God bless you amen you say the Lord told you yes many times come to uh uh the pastor and see once he say the Lord told you I I you ain't come to me and say brother pray with me on this yes I want to be right right amen I want truth amen see it's more important to have truth Revelation than anything than anything amen we can Shout jump and everything else but TR the truth yes revealed in your day when you receive the truth for your day it is light amen when you receive the truth in your day guess what you become the light for that day amen amen amen idolatry it'll be so close till it'll deceive the very elect it if it was possible amen Prophet said this here he said it'll be as close as your right hand and your left hand on each hand I got five fingers they look exactly the same but one is right and one is wrong not saying that left-handed people are wrong but one is right and one is left see my mom's left-handed I had clear that up that fix that but that's what he say he say one is right and one is not yeah and but it'll be just that close so a lot of times we people are looking for the wrong things they're looking for and not saying not all these things are wrong but you you you're trying to find these things in and you just like he said probably said they come in they empty their mind oh Lord don't that or they or they looking for looking for God but they looking for God in knowledge yeah yeah amen looking for them in knowledge but you don't get the wisdom of the Holy Ghost amen amen see knowledge you can have all of the not knowledge is just information yes yes yes it's like the ingredients to baking a cake I the perfect cake we want to he's already made the cake and oh the the the cake is is oh it tastes so good and it looks so good but there's certain ingredients that went in the cake now I can give you all of the ingredients that went into that cake yeah yeah but if you don't know the instruction amen oh my amen how much how long yes yes you going to have a mess it ain't going to taste like this it may taste good right but it ain't this but what you trying to produce is this amen but you produce something false amen and you eat it and you eat it and you become it oh this is right why I taste and see that the Lord is good quot scriptures with it wrong all the time why because you had knowledge you had the ingredients but you didn't have the wisdom of the Holy Ghost on how to create amen that's why he had to send a prophet in this day amen amen to give us the knowledge and the instruction and the instruction you got to stay with the word got to stay right with the word
