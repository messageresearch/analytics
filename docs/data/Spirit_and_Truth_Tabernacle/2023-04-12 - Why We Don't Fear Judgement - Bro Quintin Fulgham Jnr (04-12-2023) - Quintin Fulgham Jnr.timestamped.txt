[4:28] Prayer
[4:31] Lord Jesus Christ we come before You O
[4:33] Lord God another day O Lord God broken
[4:35] bodies broken Minds O Lord God but
[4:38] we come in a place the Lord God where we

[4:43] O Lord we know that our sacrifice is
[4:46] sweet smelling oh Lord Jesus Christ we
[4:48] we we we thank You O Lord God for giving
[4:51] us the faithful Lord God and the
[4:52] strength oh Lord to make it out here O
[4:54] Lord God oh Lord let us return oh Lord
[4:57] not empty-handed O Lord Jesus Christ but
[4:59] full of your spirit O Lord God that we
[5:02] can we can show the people who you are O
[5:04] Lord God not just in word O Lord Jesus
[5:07] Christ but in action oh Lord God Lord
[5:09] let it be that O Lord that as as we
[5:12] leave with your with your with the
[5:13] anointing of your spirit on us O Lord
[5:16] God that we wouldn't even have to say a
[5:17] word O Lord because but that people will
[5:19] know there's something different
[5:21] of being in our and being in our
[5:24] presence O Lord God with your presence
[5:25] inside of us O Lord bless each every
[5:28] every one of them oh Lord God answer
[5:30] their needs O Lord in the precious name
[5:32] of Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen
[5:35] so uh we'll get right into it I don't
[5:39] have any slides or anything
[5:41] um
[5:42] but
[5:43] um
[5:44] the title of the message is why we don't
[5:47] fear judgment
[5:48] uh so it's a it's a it's a good message
[5:51] it's actually I kind of got I got some
[5:53] inspiration from Brother Jack
[5:56] um when he uh preached the resurrection
[5:58] a message on Sunday so we're going to
[6:01] start our journey here in Matthew
[6:04] chapter 7. and then verses uh one
[6:08] through five
[6:11] so I'll wait for everyone to get there
[6:18] all right so here it says judge not that
[6:23] ye be not judged
[6:24] for with what judgment you judge ye
[6:27] shall be judged and with what measure
[6:29] you meet it shall be measured to you
[6:32] again and why behold this thou the moat
[6:34] that is in thy brother's eye but
[6:37] considers not the being that is in thine
[6:39] own eye or how will thy say to thy
[6:42] brother let me pull out the moat out of
[6:44] thine eye and behold a beam is in thy
[6:46] own eye thou hypocrite First cast out
[6:49] the beam of thine own eye and then Thou
[6:52] shalt See Clearly to cast out the moat
[6:54] out of thy brother's eye all right this
[6:57] is a beautiful beautiful verse where
[7:00] Jesus is teaching us uh um not to judge
[7:04] but at the same time we're still
[7:06] required to help our brother right which
[7:09] means we still got to judge situations
[7:11] right we still got to judge the
[7:14] situations right and the key a key word
[7:17] in this last verse verse 5 it says and
[7:20] then Thou shalt see clearly we know see
[7:23] from the prophet means to understand
[7:24] clearly right so you got to understand
[7:27] the situation before you can provide
[7:29] help to your brother right
[7:32] a lot of times we like to uh send people
[7:36] to Hell on little things and stuff and
[7:38] it's it's and most of the time when
[7:42] you're trying to help someone they know
[7:43] they're wrong which is why people go to
[7:45] the hospital they know they sick they
[7:47] know something's not right right so it's
[7:50] our job to give him a word of
[7:51] encouragement to get them back on path
[7:54] right but you got to understand how to
[7:56] do it so why don't we fear judgment
[8:00] oh yes y'all can be seated yes sorry
[8:02] yeah
[8:04] Why Don't We Fear judgment there's a
[8:06] couple questions that we have to ask for
[8:08] that right so one we have to establish
[8:11] uh where is Judgment today right
[8:15] so judgment lies in the body of the
[8:17] Saints right judgment lies in God and
[8:20] this is where I kind of got inspiration
[8:21] from Brother Jack about
[8:23] um how the old Saints had the power to
[8:26] stay in the grave he was he was touching
[8:28] on that point because the resurrection
[8:30] was in them and they could leave anytime
[8:32] they wanted to but they had the power to
[8:35] stay in the grave right and so you see
[8:37] judgment lies in the Saints just as much
[8:40] as the resurrection does and God has a
[8:42] plan with all of that so when you've
[8:44] received the message of your day
[8:46] judgment lies inside of you
[8:49] Resurrection is in the message judgment
[8:51] is in the message and it all lies inside
[8:53] of you it is in us to judge right it is
[8:56] in us to judge a lot of times people say
[9:00] um
[9:00] and we'll get to this saying again only
[9:02] God can judge me God is using people to
[9:06] judge you all right when he places his
[9:08] message inside of people he's using them
[9:10] to judge your situation right
[9:13] so uh as brother Jack was preaching
[9:17] about you know those things have the
[9:19] power to stay down in there and there
[9:20] was a reason why they got to stay down
[9:21] there there's a reason why we don't want
[9:23] them to come out there just yet right
[9:25] there's also a reason why we have to die
[9:28] to ourselves as well when uh uh when we
[9:32] are dealing with situations right we
[9:34] have to die to what we want to say about
[9:36] things right because the fact of us
[9:38] saying something could bring judgment so
[9:40] we want to be careful about exactly what
[9:42] we say and kind of let God lead lead the
[9:45] direction of what we're saying right so
[9:48] that is where where the Judgment lies
[9:50] today it is in his Saints uh the next
[9:53] question to ask is what exactly is
[9:56] Judgment right and you can read
[9:58] throughout the Bible everywhere you'll
[9:59] see judgment on all over the place but
[10:02] there are different kinds of judgment
[10:03] right and the time you receive it or
[10:07] when you receive it shows which one
[10:08] you're dealing with so we're going to go
[10:10] over to a James chapter 2.
[10:14] and verses uh 10 through 13.
[10:18] all right
[10:23] amen
[10:27] glory and it reads here
[10:31] for whosoever shall keep the whole law
[10:33] and yet offend in one point he is guilty
[10:35] of all for he said that do not commit
[10:38] adultery said also do not kill so he's
[10:42] saying this is God saying don't commit
[10:43] adultery and don't kill right we know
[10:45] the Commandments now if thou commit no
[10:47] adultery yet if thou kill Thou Art
[10:49] become a transgressor of the law so here
[10:52] he's saying you can't just pick and
[10:53] choose what you want to do right you
[10:55] gotta you have to eat the whole book you
[10:57] have to follow the whole book and here
[10:59] comes the key verse here in verse 12. so
[11:02] speak ye and so do as they that shall be
[11:05] judged by the law of Liberty that's very
[11:08] very important we want we want the law
[11:10] of Liberty to be we want to be in
[11:12] Judgment of the law of Liberty right
[11:15] as we read the next verse of verse 13 it
[11:17] says for he shall have judgment without
[11:20] Mercy that have show no mercy so see we
[11:23] here we see two judgments one is being
[11:25] judged by the law of liberty another one
[11:27] is being judged without Mercy because
[11:29] they didn't show any Mercy all right and
[11:32] then the most beautiful thing in this
[11:33] verse 13 is Mercy rejoices against
[11:37] judgment
[11:38] that's the kind of judgment I would want
[11:40] to be in something that you there's
[11:42] still a rejoicing in right something
[11:44] where they're still a praising right
[11:48] that's the kind of judgment that uh that
[11:50] I would want to receive uh and that's
[11:52] the kind of judgment that we want to
[11:53] give to people that they can leave with
[11:56] joy right and hope in their heart
[11:58] knowing that hey there's hope for me
[12:01] right I can I can make it out of the
[12:03] situation and you know they're not
[12:05] there's no condemnation where you kind
[12:07] of what kind of what brother Branham
[12:08] says you're kicking them down the ditch
[12:10] instead of trying to help them up right
[12:12] so that's the kind of judgment that we
[12:14] want to give because judgment lies in us
[12:16] so it's important the kind of judgment
[12:19] we give to people and that's what God is
[12:21] concerned about for us so we're going to
[12:24] read some stories where God gives this
[12:28] judgment within the law of Liberty right
[12:30] these ones haven't received Mercy uh
[12:33] this is the kind of judgment Where Mercy
[12:36] always follows right and there can be a
[12:40] rejoicing in that judgment so we're
[12:42] going to go to Second Samuels
[12:46] going to go to second Samuel
[12:49] um
[12:51] and it's going to be verses five through
[12:54] seven I'll give a um
[12:56] uh chapter 12. so second Samuel chapter
[12:59] 12 verses 5 through 7.
[13:02] and just to kind of give
[13:04] um
[13:05] a summary you know David had committed a
[13:07] sin he had committed adultery then
[13:10] committed a murder and so Nathan is now
[13:13] Nathan the prophet God sent Nathan a
[13:15] prophet to come talk to David and he he
[13:18] gives a story about a rich man and a
[13:20] poor man and a rich man uh you know
[13:23] taken from the poor man right
[13:25] he's telling the story he ain't
[13:27] mentioned that as David and that and
[13:29] that's and that's and that's the
[13:30] beautiful thing I like about it God
[13:32] didn't just come down there and say
[13:33] David you're wrong he wanted to know
[13:35] where David Hart was amen he wants to
[13:38] know where his David Hart was uh he
[13:40] wanted to check the maturity of David
[13:42] right
[13:43] so we're going to read what David's
[13:45] reaction was when uh Nathan had given
[13:48] the story from starting from verse five
[13:52] and David's anger was greatly kindled
[13:54] against the man and he said to Nathan as
[13:57] the Lord liveth the man that have done
[13:59] this thing shall surely die he no mercy
[14:02] he's going to die right and he shall
[14:05] restore the lamb fourfold because he did
[14:07] this thing and because he hath no pity
[14:10] uh verse 7 right uh and Nathan said to
[14:15] David Thou Art the man right so now Dave
[14:18] is like oh hold on a second wait
[14:21] hold on let me kind of backtrack right
[14:26] but one of the beautiful things in this
[14:28] verse 7 is the next part
[14:31] even though they even though Nathan had
[14:33] said David you're that man the next part
[14:36] is thus saith the Lord so now God is
[14:38] speaking whenever there's a thus say
[14:40] Lord he said thus saith the Lord of
[14:41] Israel I anointed thee King over over
[14:44] Israel right and that's the most
[14:46] important part God is confessing David I
[14:50] made you a king and the king is also a
[14:52] judge all right God had told David uh uh
[14:57] God has said David you was a man after
[14:59] his own heart so right away God is
[15:01] saying David I just can't cut you off
[15:04] I told you you would be king I anointed
[15:06] you King I called you to this position
[15:08] and remember he received the anointing
[15:11] by accepting the message of a prophet a
[15:14] prophet had come into town was looking
[15:16] to anoint someone King
[15:18] God said hey God told me to anoint David
[15:20] David accepted the anointing of uh of of
[15:24] that Prophet right so God couldn't just
[15:27] cut him off right I believe God was
[15:29] upset though with David's reaction and
[15:32] hearing how he judged a man and there
[15:35] was no mercy after God had called him to
[15:37] judge
[15:38] so we're going to keep reading
[15:41] and we're going to go to uh versus
[15:44] second Samuel 12 verses 11 through 13.
[15:48] all right
[15:53] so now here's just here's just um here's
[15:56] just God giving some judgment God giving
[15:59] some judgment to David David right he
[16:02] says thus save the Lord
[16:04] behold I will raise up evil against thee
[16:07] out of thine own house and I will take
[16:09] thy wise before thy eyes and give them
[16:11] unto thy neighbor and he shall align
[16:12] with our wives in the side of the son
[16:14] for thou dids it secretly
[16:17] but I will do this thing before all
[16:19] Israel and before the sun and that's
[16:22] that's that's a beautiful verse right
[16:23] there because uh I love the laws of
[16:27] contrast that you see in the Bible how
[16:29] which makes God just right because the
[16:32] Bible says uh which When you pray in
[16:35] secret Jesus instructed them to pray in
[16:37] secret so that your father heavenly
[16:39] father would reward you openly and so
[16:42] here we see David doing something
[16:44] secretly and God's saying all right you
[16:46] did it in secret but I'm gonna expose
[16:48] this thing to everybody
[16:50] so it's beautiful to see the laws of
[16:52] contrast and the right and and the
[16:54] righteous judgment how God gives you
[16:56] what you ask for all right
[17:00] and we're going to keep reading and
[17:02] David said unto Nathan I have sinned
[17:04] against the Lord that's the beautiful
[17:06] thing he recognized he was wrong and he
[17:09] said God your judgment is right I did
[17:12] wrong right and Nathan said unto David
[17:14] the Lord also hath put away thy sin thou
[17:18] shall not die David had done confessed
[17:20] that this man should die and God gave
[17:22] him his judgment told him this is all
[17:24] you're going to suffer and at the end of
[17:26] all of it God said I've put your sin
[17:28] away you're not going to die and I'm
[17:30] thankful that God doesn't give us what
[17:33] we deserve sometimes right and we're
[17:35] going to sit on this for a little bit
[17:36] because it's not just in judging a lot
[17:41] of times we think about judging right
[17:42] from wrong but it's a lot of times it's
[17:44] in the situations you know it's uh you
[17:46] could be sick right I mean on the death
[17:49] bed stage four cancer and you don't
[17:51] judge the situation I'm about to die but
[17:54] what does God say about it right what
[17:56] does God say about it you know you may
[17:58] have you know Wayward kids kids out
[18:00] there I mean they're just saturated in
[18:03] sin you're like man there's no hope in
[18:05] that but what does God say about that
[18:07] right so it's important to get the mind
[18:10] to Christ inside of you so you can judge
[18:12] situations rightly right or else man we
[18:16] just be like David it's just dead it's
[18:18] dead situation dead situation dead but
[18:20] then God's got to come back to the
[18:22] prophet and say no there's still life
[18:24] amen right
[18:25] there's still life right so we see the
[18:28] law of judgment we see the Judgment here
[18:30] within the law of Liberty how there's
[18:33] always Mercy at the end of it and all
[18:36] that and all that God had told David all
[18:38] that judgment he said you're going to
[18:39] deal with this the sword is not going to
[18:41] leave your house but you ain't gonna die
[18:43] so the Judgment had come but there was
[18:45] Mercy at the end I believe that's
[18:48] something David could be happy about to
[18:50] hear that that no matter what the sword
[18:52] is not going to leave my house I'm going
[18:53] to suffer with all these things but I
[18:55] ain't gonna die
[18:57] he has something to Rejoice about that
[18:59] God wasn't going to leave him right so
[19:02] we love this kind of we love this kind
[19:04] of judgment where people can leave with
[19:06] some relief right you done made the
[19:09] mistake you got to go through it right
[19:11] but there's Mercy at the end of it right
[19:13] there's Mercy at the end of it uh it's
[19:16] the reason why David could write the
[19:18] book of Psalms why he was going through
[19:20] that situation he still had a praise he
[19:24] still had a praise to God he could still
[19:26] reach out to God he could still talk to
[19:28] God even though he know he did wrong he
[19:30] was going through his family situations
[19:33] uh the like his the household situation
[19:36] with the wives and he still had a praise
[19:39] on the inside
[19:40] amidst all the Judgment that God had
[19:42] given all right
[19:44] amen so now we're going to go to a uh
[19:46] we're going to go to another story of
[19:49] somebody else and this is going to be in
[19:52] Joshua Joshua chapter 6. and we're going
[19:56] to start from the verse 17.
[20:02] I'm going to start from verse 17.
[20:05] right
[20:07] and this is Sister rehab all right
[20:10] and the city and this is Joshua and this
[20:13] is uh this is I believe God speaking uh
[20:16] and the city shall be accursed even it
[20:19] and all that are there into the Lord
[20:21] only Rahab the Harlot shall live she and
[20:25] all that are with her in the house
[20:27] because she hid The Messengers that we
[20:30] sent
[20:31] right this is a lot to unpack uh and
[20:35] it's one of the reasons why we really
[20:36] really love the story of Rahab uh so we
[20:40] notice in verse 17 God had come down and
[20:44] judged this city right he said it's
[20:47] accursed and he's going to destroy it
[20:49] right judgment come down God said I've
[20:52] cursed it I'm going to destroy it now we
[20:55] have to come back to that train of
[20:56] thought of
[20:58] um The Only God Can Judge Me thought
[21:00] right because I hear that a lot I see
[21:03] that a lot I hear a lot on social media
[21:05] from a lot of people that you know
[21:06] profess Christianity all right and it's
[21:09] a funny thought because it's the thought
[21:11] that says uh Only God can judge me I can
[21:14] keep living and doing what I want to do
[21:16] and God is still before me right but
[21:20] let's look at the attitude of Rahab
[21:22] during this ordeal because God done
[21:24] cursed her city right God done cursed it
[21:27] and we can translate to we could
[21:29] translate that to saying God is saying I
[21:30] don't like culture I don't like what you
[21:33] guys talk about I don't like what you
[21:35] guys think about I Don't Like Your
[21:37] Entertainment I don't like your music I
[21:39] don't like the parties I don't like the
[21:41] clothes I don't like the businesses I
[21:43] don't like the government I don't like
[21:45] the lifestyle I don't like your ideas
[21:47] right and Rahab had to withstand this
[21:50] judgment against her culture or her way
[21:53] of life and say Lord you're right amen
[21:56] you're right amen right that's opposite
[21:58] from how these other people think uh
[22:02] this Only God can judge me I can still
[22:04] do what I want and God still be Rahab
[22:07] hath a total opposite mindset and she
[22:10] said you know what Lord you're right
[22:11] it's horrible the city that I live in is
[22:14] horrible the things that I've been doing
[22:15] in life is horrible right and we're
[22:17] going to go to this uh message why why
[22:19] Christ speak 59
[22:23] um laundry and we're going to see what
[22:25] the prophet uh had to say about uh this
[22:29] situation situation with Rahab right
[22:33] um
[22:34] so it is while she's pulling up I'll
[22:36] start reading so it is today nothing
[22:37] less
[22:39] I think today I'd make a mention of one
[22:42] woman that I think of in the Bible and
[22:45] she was bad to begin with rotten to the
[22:48] core a young beautiful woman by the name
[22:51] of Rahab
[22:52] she was a heathen to start with and she
[22:54] was a prostitute on can you imagine like
[22:57] we haven't even gotten to anything yet
[22:58] only good thing I heard was just a young
[23:02] beautiful woman but outside of that bad
[23:04] to begin with rotten to the core Heathen
[23:07] to start with she was a prostitute on
[23:09] the street
[23:10] but she heard there was a God not an
[23:13] idol that set dumb or Declaration of
[23:15] Creeds but a God who lived among his
[23:17] people anointed them and signs and
[23:19] wonders was following them she heard
[23:21] about it one day two Representatives
[23:23] came to Jericho those The Messengers and
[23:26] quickly on her street as a prostitute
[23:28] she called them took them into the house
[23:29] and said they're after you and she hit
[23:31] them right and I like that because these
[23:35] Messengers were carrying a message and I
[23:37] like when the prophet says and the Bible
[23:39] says that she hid them in her house
[23:41] right she took the message right which
[23:45] was a message of judgment that hey your
[23:47] city's coming down and she took that hit
[23:50] it inside of her own household right so
[23:52] uh uh it's a good indication of taking
[23:55] the message and hiding it in your heart
[23:57] right and I like her attitude she never
[23:59] said
[24:00] I'll believe it when I see the great
[24:02] anointed Joshua do some sign if I could
[24:04] have seen Moses do the science I would
[24:06] have believed it but she said I've heard
[24:07] Faith come by hearing hearing of the
[24:10] word of God right
[24:12] so
[24:14] it and it just kind of amazed me how he
[24:16] was just talking I mean he just rotten
[24:19] to the core he then he said but it was
[24:21] true
[24:22] she knew it was true and her attitude
[24:24] was Lord help me
[24:27] um uh down uh down here in uh in uh the
[24:31] paragraph and now you have to pull it up
[24:33] she said I've heard that the god of
[24:34] Heaven who was a real God with you all
[24:36] and he's done great signs and wonders he
[24:38] dried up the Red Sea he brought plagues
[24:40] upon Egypt we see how he turned the
[24:43] enemy over to your hands and our whole
[24:44] country's trembling so she knew judgment
[24:47] was coming
[24:49] and this is what she said I'm asking
[24:51] Mercy I'm asking Mercy right
[24:54] so not only did Rahab have to withstand
[24:58] that attack by God on her culture and
[25:01] her way of life but all the ones that
[25:03] wanted to follow Rahab into the house
[25:05] had to have the same mindset right by
[25:09] agreeing to the destruction of the city
[25:11] they approved that the Judgment of God
[25:14] was right they said Lord you're right
[25:16] meaning they wasn't going to fight for
[25:18] the city they wasn't going to defend it
[25:20] it wasn't going to offend their way of
[25:22] life right they said no it needs to be
[25:24] destroyed the Bible said he told the um
[25:28] he told the army of Israel to kill the
[25:30] man the woman young old animals I mean
[25:34] old people I mean it's everything wipe
[25:37] it all out
[25:38] right and they was agreeing with it they
[25:42] probably knew some of the people
[25:45] they probably have friendships with so
[25:47] many people they probably had their
[25:48] favorite stores their favorite
[25:49] restaurants God will said no I'm taking
[25:52] it all out wow so it showed if it will
[25:55] show with inside of their heart that
[25:56] they were totally sold out
[25:59] on this message that they weren't
[26:01] willing to take anything with them right
[26:03] now
[26:06] um
[26:07] now even in that decision and this is
[26:09] the other part even in that decision God
[26:12] didn't take them out of the city during
[26:14] the time of his destruction right
[26:16] they were instructed to put a Scarlet
[26:18] thread on the outside of their house
[26:20] right
[26:22] and that's God's way of saying now you
[26:24] guys y'all sinned in the city so you got
[26:27] to stay right you got to stay judgment's
[26:30] coming you got to stay but because you
[26:33] receive the messengers there was a red
[26:36] Scarlet as instructed that they could
[26:38] put over their door of the house which
[26:41] signified God wasn't going to touch it
[26:43] the prophet said that when they came
[26:45] inside and destroyed the city Only rehab
[26:48] sections stood up right right only Rahab
[26:52] sections stood up she still went through
[26:54] the Judgment right but there was Mercy
[26:57] at the end meaning that I imagine inside
[27:01] that house while they hear and
[27:03] everything that's going on on the
[27:04] outside they could shout they could
[27:07] praise they could sing they could enjoy
[27:09] the food they were eating knowing that
[27:11] it wasn't going to touch them not one
[27:14] one sword with not one sort of
[27:16] Destruction was going to touch them
[27:17] right
[27:18] amen so this is so it's a rep this is a
[27:21] representation of of as we were
[27:24] preaching before of Mercy rejoicing
[27:27] against judgment right this is a type of
[27:30] judgment that God has given uh given to
[27:34] the to Rahab in them but he made a way
[27:36] of Escape inside of there and we want to
[27:38] read uh verses 22 uh Joshua 6 22
[27:46] 22 23 and 25. all right
[27:51] [Music]
[27:53] all right so it says but Joshua has said
[27:56] unto the two men that had spied out the
[27:58] country going to the harlot's house and
[28:01] bring out fence the woman and all that
[28:02] she hath as ye swear unto her
[28:06] and the young men that were spies went
[28:09] in and brought out Rahab and her father
[28:11] and her mother and her Brethren and all
[28:13] that she had and he brought her out to
[28:15] out of the Kendrick and left them
[28:17] without the camp of Israel right
[28:20] so the same Messengers that came
[28:25] to give her the message of Grace were
[28:28] the same Messengers that came and
[28:30] brought her out into the camp of Israel
[28:32] so uh it's the message that's going to
[28:35] take you places right it's not how good
[28:38] you are
[28:39] it's not what you think of the thing
[28:40] right it's it's it's your reaction to
[28:44] the message and then the message does
[28:46] everything else it did it didn't say
[28:48] they had to get up and go to the camp
[28:50] themselves no they said Joshua said no
[28:53] go and get them and bring them right
[28:56] into the camp and of course the camp of
[28:58] Israel representing spirituals are
[29:00] representing
[29:01] eternity right we want to go back to uh
[29:03] Israel that's the true nation that'll
[29:05] survive everything right
[29:07] uh and and it's it's funny because
[29:12] I was experiencing a moment of this on
[29:16] uh I remember it was Monday I just come
[29:18] back from doing take doing some business
[29:20] uh and
[29:22] um
[29:23] I was sitting in Wawas and I was on my
[29:26] phone because sometimes I like to go to
[29:28] Wawas and just eat and just sit in my
[29:29] car and I was on my phone and I read
[29:31] this story about a woman who had this
[29:34] guy had done this guy was accused of
[29:37] doing something to this woman which was
[29:38] proven to be false and the man had to
[29:42] spend 16 years in jail right 16 years in
[29:45] jail for something he did not do and man
[29:48] it just like I just got angry I just got
[29:51] upset when I heard the response of the
[29:54] woman it kind of sounded like there was
[29:56] no remorse in it all right and I just
[29:59] got the man she deserves this this this
[30:01] and that
[30:02] I'm thankful for the spirit of God that
[30:05] can come on you and tell you to stop
[30:07] thinking certain things
[30:09] stop thinking certain things because
[30:11] then it started coming to my mind
[30:13] do you know her end wow do you know her
[30:17] end right
[30:18] [Music]
[30:19] because this is the funny thing well not
[30:21] the funny thing of the matter but this
[30:22] is the this is the thing of the matter
[30:23] if within her last breaths of life if
[30:26] she asks God for mercy and God grants
[30:29] that Mercy with her her sins are gone
[30:32] Amen on the flip side if this young man
[30:35] this guy that was done wrong if within
[30:37] his last breaths he doesn't ask God for
[30:40] Mercy his sins will still be there I
[30:43] don't care how wrong he was right so in
[30:47] that moment I believe it was God
[30:48] teaching me you got to judge rightly
[30:51] right you can't judge people by their
[30:53] circumstances by the by what they're
[30:55] going through right it's always the
[30:57] ending of it you never know what a
[31:00] situation someone is going in it's one
[31:02] of the reasons why we can see in the
[31:04] Bible Paul has such a good work Paul God
[31:08] used Paul to write so many books in the
[31:11] Bible right so many books in the Bible
[31:12] but if you look at how he started
[31:15] it kind of would it kind of would have
[31:17] thrown you off when God was trying to
[31:19] begin God's when God was trying to begin
[31:22] the work of God inside of Paul all right
[31:24] dealing with his Brethren they didn't
[31:26] even want to talk to him they said what
[31:28] this guy is against you God said no go
[31:31] and baptize him I've chosen them I've
[31:33] ordained them for work right people he
[31:36] ordained him for work so it's never we
[31:39] you got to judge situations rightly and
[31:42] it's never by how you think the
[31:44] situation should go
[31:45] that's one of the reasons why
[31:48] in the Bible when God anointed Solomon
[31:51] King
[31:53] he asked the right thing as being the
[31:56] king he said Lord give me the wisdom in
[31:58] order for him to judge situations
[32:00] rightly and it pleased God when he asked
[32:03] that thing because he didn't want his
[32:05] opinion on the matter he wanted what God
[32:07] saw uh in the situation of of the matter
[32:11] so it's and and that's how God wants us
[32:13] to be because the Judgment lies inside
[32:16] of us which is why we don't we we're not
[32:18] afraid of it we're not afraid of
[32:20] judgment because God is using us to
[32:22] judge right God is using us to judge but
[32:26] the kind of judgment we need to use has
[32:28] to be right has to be righteous right
[32:30] and that kind of judgment always comes
[32:33] with Mercy at the end right always comes
[32:35] with Mercy at the end right
[32:38] so um
[32:40] and we get that judgment and and a lot
[32:44] we don't just get that judgment by God
[32:46] just coming in and just giving us and
[32:48] giving us judgment and we're just going
[32:49] out there and just judging people no in
[32:52] our mistakes right and our mistakes uh
[32:56] in our sins and we are and we and we
[32:58] when we sin every day the Bible says the
[33:00] righteous fall seven times one day but
[33:02] we get back up eight and our sins right
[33:04] in our mistakes and the things that we
[33:06] do uh when we come back to God and ask
[33:09] God for forgiveness and ask God for
[33:11] Mercy right we're proving his judgment's
[33:13] right which then gives us not only
[33:16] judgment on a situation but compassion
[33:19] right which is what a lot of people lack
[33:21] when they try to judge is they try to
[33:23] judge a situation with no compassion
[33:26] right no compassion no no no care it's
[33:30] just you did wrong people know they're
[33:32] wrong but now they want to know what can
[33:34] I do to get back and a lot of times it's
[33:37] not what you say but it's what they see
[33:40] is what they see in your life when I see
[33:43] you make mistakes right when you admit
[33:45] that you've made mistakes it gives
[33:47] people confidence that's why the prophet
[33:49] one time the prophet was um the tax
[33:53] collector was calling him and the
[33:54] prophet ain't going to deal with that
[33:55] situation and he just walked away and
[33:58] told his wife to tell him he wasn't
[33:59] there when he was there he told a lie
[34:01] try to go pray for a baby and the same
[34:04] Jesus here called him a hypocrite
[34:08] praying for that kid go make that thing
[34:10] right brother Brandon went back told the
[34:13] man hey I was there I did it wrong and
[34:16] what and this guy I don't know if he was
[34:18] a Christian or not but the the response
[34:20] from the guy was brother Branham I now
[34:22] have more confidence in you I have more
[34:25] confidence in you that you've done the
[34:26] right thing so even in even in
[34:30] um making your risk making your your
[34:32] mistakes wrong right it's a life that's
[34:35] being proven that gives confidence to
[34:37] people
[34:38] no judgment was given but the fact that
[34:41] brother Brandon was living a life that
[34:42] was according to the gospel brought
[34:44] confidence in a man that we don't even
[34:46] know was a Christian that's right it
[34:49] brought confidence inside of him right
[34:50] without having to say one word of
[34:52] Judgment of your wrong
[34:54] not one Judgment of your own right
[34:57] so when we prove that the uh the the
[35:00] judgments of of God as true uh it builds
[35:04] our ability to judge righteously right
[35:06] it builds our ability to judge
[35:07] righteously right uh and one of the
[35:10] things is because the way we judge
[35:11] people it shows which judgment we will
[35:14] receive right the Bible clearly said in
[35:18] James second it says you know those that
[35:20] judge without uh those that receive
[35:22] judgment without Mercy because they
[35:24] showed no mercy right so I'm so I'm
[35:27] thankful for the spirit of God that can
[35:28] come into our lives when we want to
[35:30] judge situations you know wayward
[35:33] children friends uh what we think about
[35:37] the politics and all that kind of stuff
[35:38] right God can come and say hold on a
[35:41] second I need I I see what you're doing
[35:43] I I know they're wrong but I need you to
[35:45] end it with some mercy right I need you
[35:47] to end that judgment with some mercy
[35:48] right well and uh because it shows with
[35:52] judgment will receive God doesn't want
[35:53] us to receive judgment with no mercy so
[35:56] we can't give it without any Mercy right
[35:58] we cannot give you without any Mercy
[36:01] right uh it's a hypocrisy uh and uh one
[36:04] of the stories
[36:06] um the prophet
[36:08] um had actually went through where he
[36:10] kind of had a little hypocrisy well now
[36:11] yeah it's a little hypocrisy moment for
[36:12] him uh is he went into this
[36:15] establishment one time and I think it
[36:16] was like drinking and people were just
[36:18] in there sinning and the prophet said
[36:21] Lord burn it all down
[36:23] thought he was doing something thought
[36:26] he was doing God of work thought he was
[36:28] doing God of service he said just burn
[36:29] it right down to the ground
[36:31] right no compassion No Love
[36:36] the Prophet this is one of the things
[36:39] like we ain't following a man
[36:41] we're not following a man men will the
[36:45] Flesh of a man I don't care how
[36:46] righteous it looks won't lead you to
[36:49] Christ amen so you got to be careful and
[36:52] I was thinking to myself I was you know
[36:54] imagine if we would have had people in
[36:57] that establishment with brother Branham
[36:58] and he would have said that words how
[37:01] would they have reacted if you were
[37:03] following a man oh man the prophet is
[37:05] right he's true wow but if you got God's
[37:07] spirit I that Spirit got to say hold on
[37:10] a second
[37:11] hold on a second I don't know if that
[37:13] sounds just right Glory and that's what
[37:16] we're looking for we're not pushing down
[37:18] the man that was God's chosen man God's
[37:20] chosen vessel but Paul said follow me as
[37:23] I follow Christ right so here we have
[37:27] the prophet in this establishment and
[37:28] he's wanting God to burn the place down
[37:30] right and so God said hold on a second
[37:32] took him to a little corner I love those
[37:35] little corner moments where God can get
[37:37] a hold of you and say hold on a second
[37:39] God showed him a vision and his sins
[37:42] were going as they were going to God
[37:44] there was I think there was like a red
[37:46] streak a bumper right so they wouldn't
[37:48] get to the throne of God and God and
[37:51] brother Brandon asked God for
[37:52] forgiveness and God had wrote forgiven
[37:54] right and that changed his whole that
[37:58] changed his whole mind that one little
[38:00] moment changed his whole mind and he was
[38:02] able to go inside of that establishment
[38:03] and there was a there was a lady sitting
[38:06] down there had all kinds of makeup on
[38:08] and she was talking to guys and he came
[38:09] down there and just started talking to
[38:10] her and catching her spirit to come to
[38:13] find out it was a sheep hidden what in
[38:16] Wolf's clothes
[38:17] and he was ready to burn the place down
[38:21] you see it's
[38:23] the bride don't persecute bride so
[38:25] that's why God has to give us those
[38:27] Corner moments to uh to uh first realize
[38:32] that we ain't what we are right by
[38:35] ourselves we didn't get to the position
[38:37] that we are by ourselves we don't
[38:39] deserve and it's just like David we
[38:42] don't get what we deserve right David
[38:44] was ready to cast this person die him
[38:47] out and God said no David I ain't gonna
[38:49] kill you that's not what I think about
[38:51] you right and so uh he found this little
[38:55] lady
[38:56] started talking to her and then she gave
[38:58] recommitted her life to Christ come to
[39:00] find out she was always a sheep she had
[39:02] just gotten astray a little bit
[39:04] so God has sent him to this place not to
[39:07] judge it right
[39:08] to get the one
[39:10] right to get the one leave the 99 to get
[39:14] the one amen amen
[39:18] right
[39:19] so um in closing in a little bit
[39:22] um
[39:23] brother Jack talked about the the
[39:26] staying power of the Saints and the
[39:28] grave
[39:29] we love that staying power
[39:31] that shows that there's still a work to
[39:34] be done right A lot of times you know
[39:36] you have some people that say you know
[39:38] oh man I just I miss I miss I miss my
[39:41] loved ones I miss my uncle you know he
[39:42] was a saint he's passed on I miss
[39:44] Grandma miss Mama and all my brother and
[39:47] everything like that they were Saints
[39:48] and they moved on and they're in the
[39:50] grave and I want to I want to see him
[39:52] again if your life ain't right you don't
[39:54] want them to raise up yet
[39:57] you don't want them to raise up yet
[39:59] all right
[40:00] because that judgment is lying inside of
[40:03] them right right the judgment is lying
[40:05] inside of them that's right so that's
[40:07] why it's it's a beautiful thing when
[40:10] brother Jack was was preaching about
[40:11] that thing uh uh that staying power
[40:14] right to stay down in the grave and not
[40:17] resurrect so that we could get our last
[40:20] loved ones in right so we could get
[40:22] someone in in the body because as soon
[40:24] as they raise up it's finished they have
[40:27] a purpose of holding back the wrath of
[40:30] God while they're staying in the grave
[40:32] so that's why God's like nope y'all
[40:33] can't come up yet
[40:35] it means god not only is God working on
[40:37] our loved ones but God's working on us
[40:40] right Lord is there an area in my life
[40:43] where I have been totally surrendered to
[40:45] you that means I still need work I'm not
[40:48] ready for them to come up amen amen so
[40:52] when we receive uh uh uh when we receive
[40:55] the Judgment of God now right uh in our
[40:59] life it's only to perfect us
[41:01] that's why there isn't any fear in it
[41:04] right
[41:06] the only way you can fear judgment is if
[41:08] you haven't accepted the antidote for it
[41:12] that's the only way that you could fear
[41:13] it because judgment Jesus said to
[41:15] himself he says I come not into the
[41:17] world to condemn it
[41:18] right but through me that uh people
[41:21] would receive life that's what Jesus
[41:23] said he said I ain't coming here to
[41:24] judge which is why my people that have
[41:27] my spirit they ain't judging either
[41:30] right which is why we need a little
[41:31] correction moments uh my dad actually uh
[41:34] had him um showed a message to me
[41:37] from the uh the lifeline app
[41:40] and this was this was something that uh
[41:42] kind of hit me before I received this
[41:44] message he says here uh you don't have
[41:45] to pull up I'll just I'll just read it
[41:47] and if there's anything that we ought to
[41:49] be is kind to one another when you see a
[41:52] brother or sister and fault don't never
[41:54] don't never breathe it to nobody keep it
[41:58] to yourself and pray for that person be
[42:02] kind to them and if the spirit of God is
[42:05] in you then you will be kind to one
[42:07] another Jesus said I come to do thy will
[42:11] father we are about the Master's
[42:13] business and he was about the father's
[42:15] business and the same spirit that he had
[42:18] to begin the works of the father and to
[42:20] finish the atonement to make a way that
[42:22] we could carry the message if that
[42:24] spirit is in you you'll have that
[42:26] attitude towards people trying to do
[42:28] what you can to help them no matter
[42:30] where no matter who they are and where
[42:32] they are you'll try to help people amen
[42:35] that's it's kind of strong but it's the
[42:36] truth right so it's
[42:39] that spirit that God has blessed us with
[42:42] is always looking to show Mercy to show
[42:44] Grace to help people in their situations
[42:47] right and yes there is a judgment that
[42:50] comes with situations it's like a doctor
[42:52] you and if if you ain't if you ain't
[42:55] eating what you're supposed to eat
[42:57] right and you come up in the doctor's
[42:59] office or you got to be honest with you
[43:01] right right but they they try to be kind
[43:03] you know they don't they don't just
[43:05] they don't just you know
[43:07] if he's a good doctor right if it's a if
[43:10] it's a good doctor they hang on just
[43:13] they ain't gonna just say anything right
[43:14] because they don't want to hurt you
[43:16] they don't want to hurt you but at the
[43:19] same time at the same time you're wrong
[43:22] but I'm still trying to help you all
[43:24] right and that's how God wants us to be
[43:27] right we see you don't you don't help
[43:31] people by getting down on a level that's
[43:33] not how you want people to Christ you
[43:34] don't want people to Christ by uh um
[43:37] living the lifestyle that they have no
[43:40] we are against the lifestyle right Jesus
[43:43] when when God came to uh uh Rahab in
[43:45] them he said I'm destroying the city
[43:47] it's Starbucks everything is going it's
[43:51] gone right he wasn't going in there
[43:54] trying to sit and talk it out he was
[43:56] going to destroy it
[43:58] but for those that could receive the
[44:00] message he was willing to uh uh give
[44:03] that offer Mercy right
[44:05] give that an offer Mercy right
[44:08] so um yeah there's nothing we should
[44:12] fear in judgment right uh God sends his
[44:16] word to us in order to perfect us to
[44:19] make us more perfect David said uh you
[44:22] know if there be anything inside Lord
[44:24] that is not of You O Lord search me
[44:27] search my heart right God David was
[44:30] asking for judgment he wasn't asking for
[44:33] that the bad judgment but he was asking
[44:35] for the good judgment right because God
[44:37] is going to be honest about your
[44:39] situation right that and that's one
[44:41] that's one of the things the prophet
[44:43] will say before you come up to this
[44:44] prayer line if you want nothing exposed
[44:47] don't come up that's right all right
[44:49] because God's going to look at your
[44:51] heart he's not going to uh uh what's the
[44:53] word he's not gonna uh reason with you
[44:56] he's going to tell it like it is this is
[44:58] wrong that's wrong this is wrong and
[45:01] that's one of the reasons why you know
[45:03] you know the children of Israel
[45:06] when they want it when Moses was coming
[45:07] and talking to him he's like no we want
[45:09] to talk to God directly you know they
[45:11] thought that God was going to be like
[45:12] hey what's going on kids how y'all doing
[45:15] today
[45:16] but it's it was a terrible voice from
[45:19] Heaven because it was a righteous God
[45:20] looking into their hearts and exposing
[45:24] uh the things that they had hidden in
[45:26] there they said no we don't want to hear
[45:28] no Moses Moses talked to us Moses you
[45:31] got more grace which was a beautiful
[45:34] thing because Moses was a Christ to the
[45:37] people when God was looking to destroy
[45:39] them
[45:40] now Moses he had gone through so many so
[45:44] much stuff with the People Israel they
[45:45] had got on this nerves so much right but
[45:48] when God was looking to destroy them
[45:50] Moses stood in the Gap said Lord don't
[45:53] do it amen Lord don't do it and I could
[45:56] see God
[45:57] I could see God looking at Moses and
[46:00] seeing himself so then he said you know
[46:03] what I can't I can't do it because I see
[46:05] myself in you making an atonement for my
[46:09] people right and that's how God wants us
[46:11] to be in our situations when we're
[46:13] judging things right I tell you uh uh um
[46:17] there's a um there's a Bible verse where
[46:20] it says that there will be days where
[46:23] there would be no no compassion no
[46:25] forgiveness I go online and I see a lot
[46:28] of these videos of you know people talk
[46:30] about murderers and abusers and stuff
[46:33] like that and you read the comments and
[46:35] people just lock them up put them under
[46:37] the sale right no mercy no forgiveness
[46:41] right
[46:43] um just hey they did wrong judge them
[46:45] they did wrong judge them right and it's
[46:48] sad because it shows what's in their
[46:51] hearts
[46:52] right they want to be judged with no
[46:54] mercy right and so I'm thankful that
[46:57] haven't received that we can receive a
[47:00] message from a prophet and not only just
[47:02] see the prophet just talk about it but
[47:05] even being in a situation where he was
[47:07] just like that and God had to pull him
[47:09] back there and say hold on a second
[47:10] you're not right and for him to be able
[47:12] to give us that experience to know that
[47:15] it ain't nobody holy and we all need God
[47:19] we all need God to give compassion on
[47:22] each other and there's a reason for it
[47:23] and when we see the mind of Christ and
[47:25] we see that there's a lost sheep Jesus
[47:27] said I'll leave the 99 which is which is
[47:30] a it's a beautiful thing right
[47:32] 99 righteous living right they doing
[47:35] everything right they're doing exactly
[47:36] what you want all right but God said
[47:39] I'll leave every single one of them just
[47:41] to get one right so when we receive
[47:44] judgment now uh God is trying to judge
[47:47] us righteously uh not only for ourselves
[47:50] so that we won't receive the Judgment
[47:53] without Mercy but to also look for
[47:55] someone else that may need Mercy right
[47:59] so I ended with fat if God before us who
[48:03] can be against us amen
[48:19] amen
[48:22] so we praise the Lord for
[48:26] the word of the Lord on tonight
[48:29] amen this is a wonderful wonderful
[48:31] thought there from
[48:33] brother Quentin
[48:35] I don't think I've ever looked at that
[48:37] scripture
[48:38] in all my years I don't think I never
[48:41] looked at that scripture but why not to
[48:43] just look at it but to take us through
[48:45] the Bible and show us examples of uh of
[48:49] what James was telling us there I
[48:51] thought that was just a very very uh
[48:54] remarkable
[48:55] thought you know at James 2 10-13 I have
[48:59] to go back and look at that but the one
[49:01] statement Mercy rejoices against
[49:03] judgment and the I think the heart of
[49:06] the thought is just get us to realize
[49:08] that even as we have to you know we have
[49:10] to we have to judge situations you know
[49:13] sometimes things get out of hand and you
[49:15] know in a household sometimes the
[49:17] parents have to say something to the
[49:20] kids you know they have to get them back
[49:21] in line and uh but the the fact of the
[49:24] matter is that we're also looking to try
[49:26] to bring Mercy into whatever we're doing
[49:28] and I think it just really really just
[49:31] helps us so praise the Lord God bless
[49:33] you brother Quentin we really really
[49:34] appreciate you Amen on tonight let me
[49:37] just have the announcements and I will
[49:40] make mention of that and
[49:43] um

[53:16] I see Bob sitting in there just eating
[53:18] his meal and they always had that world
[53:20] World War II veteran hat on and I would

[54:13] at the Honda Classic and he was he was
[54:15] like the chief of the area you know

[58:16] recently lost his daughter
[58:18] uh she had a baby and something you know
[58:21] after giving birth to the baby uh
[58:23] something happened I think he ended up
[58:25] losing her and then after he got through
[58:27] that then the enemy started attacking
[58:29] his body and uh and one thing I thought
[58:33] I heard that they were trying to take a
[58:34] footer or a part of the leg or something
