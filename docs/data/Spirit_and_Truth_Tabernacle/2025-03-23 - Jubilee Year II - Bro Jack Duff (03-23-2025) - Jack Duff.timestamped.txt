[43:56] listening to a a sermon uh that was
[43:59] preached there in South Carolina,
[44:01] Brother Simmons Church, which is
[44:03] churches that they're from. And uh
[44:06] Brother Smiley had gone to preach there
[44:08] some years ago and just listened to the
[44:10] the sermon and was blessed by it. But uh
[44:13] they recorded the special, the song Lead
[44:16] Me to the Rock came out of their church.
[44:18] And man, when I heard that I said, "Hey,
[44:20] hey, hey, I need that one.
[44:25] I had never heard it before, but that
[44:27] was that was that was for me. And uh you
[44:30] know, we it's sometimes you get songs
[44:32] that just carry you through seasons.
[44:35] No matter what you're going through in
[44:36] your life, you can always reach back to
[44:38] that song and and somehow just get a
[44:41] little strength to keep pressing on.
[44:44] Amen. We thank God for that. And if you
[44:47] ain't never had to reach and grab a song
[44:49] yet, just keep living.
[44:51] You just keep living and and you see why
[44:54] grandma used to moan.

[46:04] I I will say
[46:06] um um let's Brother Smiley today is over
[46:10] at brother Mike's preaching. So, we want
[46:12] to remember him in prayer. And it's so
[46:14] certainly good to have brother Quu back
[46:16] with us. Amen. He was there in uh Puerto
[46:20] Rico. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, uh um
[46:24] we want to turn back to Isaiah 61. We
[46:28] read this on last week and uh we'll
[46:30] continue in our journey um this week.
[46:34] And you know there I have a lot in my
[46:37] spirit that I want to get out. But uh
[46:42] sometimes if you're not careful how you
[46:44] release it, then um it just becomes too
[46:49] much, right? So I'm praying that God
[46:52] would just give us um the right channel
[46:56] of inspiration to be able to get it all
[46:58] out. Amen. Uh I I could just certainly
[47:02] read the quotes. I got them, but I just
[47:04] trust that God would give us the
[47:05] inspiration. And and one of the reasons
[47:07] I like to read quotes, I like for you to
[47:09] see where I'm getting my thoughts from.
[47:11] Uh these are not my thoughts. These are
[47:14] God's thoughts that he sent through a
[47:15] prophet uh to us. And if we just stay in
[47:19] line with that, um we'll we'll be all
[47:22] right. Amen. Amen. So, uh, uh, Isaiah 61
[47:27] says, "The spirit of the Lord God is
[47:30] upon me because the Lord hath anointed
[47:34] me to preach good tidings unto the meek.
[47:38] He has sent me to bind up the
[47:40] brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty
[47:44] uh, to the captives, and the opening of
[47:48] the prison uh, to them that are
[47:51] bound." Amen. Amen.
[47:55] I like these words.
[47:58] You realize
[48:00] um some of us are in a prison
[48:05] that does not have a lock
[48:11] you get it. You you you might be bound
[48:15] in a prison and there's no lock on the
[48:18] door
[48:19] and what you need is somebody to come
[48:21] and tell you
[48:23] Just come out.
[48:26] Amen. Push the door open and come out.
[48:30] You ain't got to sit there no more. Come
[48:32] out
[48:36] to proclaim the acceptable year. Amen.
[48:40] Of the Lord and the day of vengeance of
[48:42] our God to comfort all that mourn. Amen.
[48:48] Let's pray. Father, we thank you for the
[48:50] reading of the word, but we trust that
[48:53] the Holy Spirit would now uh make it
[48:57] clear to us what you want us to know uh
[49:00] from your word. And some of the
[49:02] scriptures that you've laid in my heart
[49:03] to share with the church, God,
[49:05] scriptures that your prophet shared with
[49:07] us as the bride of Christ. And uh Lord,
[49:10] we trust that uh our eyes would be
[49:13] enlightened and that Father, our spirit,
[49:15] man, would be renewed and refreshed uh
[49:18] through the word. Come, Lord, in a
[49:21] special way upon your word. We we we
[49:23] felt your anointing throughout the
[49:24] worship service. Now, let your
[49:26] anointing, Father, settle in on the
[49:28] word. We take control over every spirit
[49:30] that's against your spirit right now and
[49:33] claim this service for the glory of God.
[49:36] In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God
[49:40] bless you. You can be seated. Uh our
[49:43] journey continues. Amen. On Jubilee
[49:47] year. Amen. Jubilee year. Amen. And it
[49:52] seemed like um everywhere I turn,
[49:56] um this word Jubilee just keep popping
[50:00] up. Amen. As I told you on last um
[50:03] Sunday, I went back to this old song
[50:05] that this is the year Jubilee. And uh
[50:08] and then last night, oh, I forgot to say
[50:11] that. Thank you everyone that was able
[50:14] to make it to the meetings uh there to
[50:16] support uh brother Bernard. I I really
[50:19] appreciate you all and your sacrifice
[50:21] that you made. Uh we had two wonderful
[50:24] services. Brother Mike did a a a
[50:26] wonderful job. Amen. On Friday night and
[50:29] then uh we had uh brother um uh Trace on
[50:33] last night and he did an excellent job.
[50:36] uh you know, we just we just had some
[50:38] really really good fellowship. But last
[50:39] night as we were there um the first
[50:42] night they uh they said all pastors
[50:44] leave and uh go to the tent so you can
[50:47] you know we want to feed you and all
[50:48] that. So I I was obedient. I got up and
[50:50] I left. Amen. That's what they said.
[50:54] That's what the pastor said. He said
[50:56] they they want all the pastors to leave.
[50:58] I said, "Okay, I'm I'mma leave." So last
[51:00] night there was a few things happening
[51:03] uh towards the end of the service. One
[51:06] of them was my mother-in-law forgot her
[51:09] uh Bible on Friday night there and uh so
[51:13] I called down and they they found it
[51:15] said we going to put the Bible in the
[51:17] pull pit. Now why would they put the
[51:19] Bible in the pull pit and at the very
[51:22] end of service they raised the Bible up
[51:25] and they say now whose whose Bible is
[51:28] this? And I knew what was going on. I
[51:32] can read between the lines. So they say,
[51:35] "Oh, this Brother Underwood, this." No,
[51:36] you know that. Oh, it's Brother Jack's
[51:39] mother-in-law. Brother Jack, you want to
[51:40] come get the
[51:41] Bible? So I sent one of the other
[51:44] brothers up to get the
[51:47] Bible chess.
[51:53] So then another brother say, "Okay, I
[51:55] got another chess move for you." Brother
[51:58] say, "We want Brother Jack to come and
[52:00] pray a closing prayer." Oh God.
[52:04] put me he made a move on me when he had
[52:07] me there. He had me then they said now
[52:09] brother since you here just go ahead and
[52:11] sing a few
[52:13] songs checkmate I was in checkmate I was
[52:16] done but uh there they begin to sing
[52:20] this song behold he comes riding on the
[52:25] cloud shining like the sun at the
[52:28] trumpets call lift your voice is to gear
[52:33] up oh out of Zion's he shout
[52:38] salvation
[52:41] comes. I I heard that jubilee again.
[52:46] Praise God. So, we're preaching Jubilee
[52:48] year. And the prophet told us as we
[52:52] shared it last week, we'll repeat some
[52:54] of the things we said last week and then
[52:56] we'll go forward as well. Uh but it says
[52:59] a a jubilee was God's manner of
[53:03] expressing grace to his people.
[53:07] Amen. A jubilee was God's manner of
[53:10] expressing grace. And as I was just
[53:12] saying with that scripture that we're
[53:13] just reading, uh Isaiah is prophesying
[53:16] that the opening of the prison to them
[53:19] that are bound. Now, if you find
[53:20] yourself in a prison, whatever that
[53:22] prison may be, and and I'm hoping that I
[53:25] can kind of get into that uh oh my, it's
[53:29] kind of I was trying I be trying to save
[53:31] things and um and it just it just kind
[53:36] of comes to me.
[53:39] Oh, a prison could be anything.
[53:43] Praise God. You could be a prisoner of
[53:45] your past. Right. You can be a prisoner
[53:49] of what other people think about you.
[53:52] Come on. Praise the Lord. Uh you can be
[53:56] a prisoner to hurts and pains and Amen.
[53:59] and and and and and just all kind of
[54:01] stuff. You can be a prisoner to
[54:03] sickness.
[54:04] Praise God. Uh you you can you can be a
[54:07] prisoner to um different addictions.
[54:12] Hallelujah. Uh, brother Brandon, he he
[54:16] made a statement. Amen. In in a message
[54:18] and and I I I have this question because
[54:21] you know when when when when Isaiah
[54:23] prophesies that I'm I'm uh uh
[54:26] proclaiming liberty to the captives, the
[54:28] opening of the prison to them that are
[54:30] bound and to pre to proclaim the
[54:33] acceptable year, which is the Jubilee
[54:35] year. Amen. So there's a prophecy that
[54:38] comes to say that the Jubilee year is
[54:40] going to be amen proclaimed. Hallelujah.
[54:44] Now, now, now you got to understand, uh,
[54:46] Brother Brandham say that what what
[54:48] what's this Jubilee for? He says, "Maybe
[54:50] you've been bound by whiskey." These are
[54:53] his words, right? I'm I'm I'm just kind
[54:56] of uh summarizing them, but he said,
[54:58] "Maybe you've been bound by whiskey."
[55:00] Amen. A jubilee comes to set you free
[55:02] from whiskey.
[55:04] Drinking. Praise God. He said
[55:07] cigarettes.
[55:09] Amen. And some people need to know that
[55:11] there's a Jubilee trumpet sounding to
[55:13] set you free from cigarettes.
[55:16] Hello. Now, I need you to understand
[55:17] something. When a Jubilee trumpet
[55:19] sounds, that's not based on an emotion.
[55:22] A Jubilee trumpet when it sounds is not
[55:24] based on a feeling. I don't care how you
[55:28] feeling at that time. If you can hear,
[55:31] Amen. with your ear, the trumpet is
[55:34] sounding for you. That trumpet sound is
[55:36] simply for your freedom. The the trumpet
[55:39] sounding is not for your feelings.
[55:42] Amen. The trumpet sound not for your
[55:44] emotions. The trumpet sound is for your
[55:46] freedom.
[55:48] And if you can hear the gospel trumpet
[55:51] sounding this morning, you can go free
[55:54] from whiskey. You can go free from
[55:57] cigarettes. I got another one for you.
[56:00] Brother Brandham say you can go free
[56:02] from mistreating your spouse.
[56:07] You can have a jubilee in your
[56:09] relationship if you can accept what God
[56:13] is trying to do.
[56:15] [Applause]
[56:18] Hallelujah. Amen. I mean, once you hear
[56:21] a Jubilee trumpet sound, you don't go
[56:23] back to what you used to do. You free.
[56:27] My God. Amen. He says you can get you
[56:30] can get set free from mistreating your
[56:32] spouse. He says also you can get free
[56:34] from running around.
[56:38] Amen. You want another another one that
[56:40] he said? You can be free from cursing.
[56:45] Amen. You can have a jubilee today and
[56:49] you can stop using that foul language.
[56:53] Amen.
[56:55] And I mean, tomorrow you're going to go
[56:57] right on the job and somebody going to
[57:00] say something for uh to to stir your
[57:02] stir up your your that that anger again.
[57:05] But you got to realize on Sunday I heard
[57:08] a jubilee trumpet sound. So I'm not
[57:11] going back to that same old lifestyle.
[57:14] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[57:16] My Lord. Hallelujah. I'm telling you
[57:19] things that the prophet said that you
[57:22] can have a jubilee from. Amen. Another
[57:24] thing he said you can have a jubilee
[57:26] from lying.
[57:29] That's right.
[57:31] Praise the Lord. You ain't got to keep
[57:33] lying no more. Lying only hurts you. You
[57:37] the one have to keep remembering that
[57:39] lie. And then somebody else ask you
[57:41] different questions and you got to come
[57:42] up with another lie.
[57:45] Hallelujah. You ain't got to do that no
[57:47] more. A jubilee trumpet set you free
[57:49] from lying.
[57:54] It'll set you free from stealing.
[57:57] [Music]
[57:58] Amen. Now, see, back in my day, it was
[58:01] all kind of ways that people we get we
[58:03] get the preachers would preach about
[58:04] stealing all the time, and and and you
[58:06] know, and and and and they they caught
[58:08] different angles on it so that we could
[58:10] understand what we were doing, right?
[58:13] Because when we when we here stealing,
[58:14] we think, okay, if I if I if somebody
[58:16] dropped something over here then and I
[58:18] go and pick it up, you know, actually
[58:20] they didn't have to drop it. I just saw
[58:21] it sitting over there and I sneaked over
[58:23] there and got that thing and put it in
[58:25] my pocket and went on. Hallelujah.
[58:27] Right. Right. Oh, that's stealing. Yeah.
[58:30] I mean, you you at the store. Uhhuh.

[58:51] and pay for that. Let them people know I
[58:53] forgot to pay for this. Not know this a
[58:57] blessing.
[58:59] Can I go a little further? You stand in
[59:01] line. This why they stopped accepting
[59:04] cash
[59:06] cuz you stand in line and somebody done
[59:08] miscounted your change and they gave you
[59:11] back more than what you gave them. And
[59:14] you sitting there, oh, what a blessing.
[59:16] No, it's not a blessing. That person
[59:19] going to have to pay for that. That's
[59:21] right. You stealing. Amen.
[59:26] And uh can I go a little further? How
[59:29] long is your lunch break?

[1:00:31] Lord.
[1:00:32] Amen. Brother Brandham also said you can
[1:00:34] have a jubilee from weariness.
[1:00:36] So, if you worried about anything,
[1:00:38] worried and weary, you don't have to
[1:00:40] accept that from the devil no more. You
[1:00:42] can you can hear the jubilee trumpet

[1:03:32] Hallelujah. Thank you.
[1:03:35] Here we
[1:03:39] have we
[1:03:42] have Sarah was in a place of
[1:03:46] bondage when Abraham had lied. Both her
[1:03:49] and Abraham lied. Said, "This is my
[1:03:52] sister." As they got down there, amen,
[1:03:55] with Aimilec,
[1:03:57] uh they were in a desperate
[1:03:59] situation. Uh there was nothing that
[1:04:02] Abraham could do about it. There's
[1:04:03] nothing that Sarah could do about it.
[1:04:04] How could they go back and try to
[1:04:06] straighten this up? It was a death
[1:04:08] sentence. You lied to the king. It was
[1:04:10] It's death sentence. Why would you do
[1:04:12] something like that? So only God could
[1:04:14] intervene.
[1:04:15] Amen. On both of their behalfs. And God
[1:04:19] had to give Aimilec a dream and tell him
[1:04:22] in the dream, "Don't touch that man's
[1:04:24] wife." And I said, "Now I know he lied,
[1:04:26] but I'm not calling him my liar. That
[1:04:28] man is my prophet." And give that man
[1:04:30] restore. restore that man his wife.
[1:04:34] Praise God. Uh and then also have him
[1:04:37] pray for you.
[1:04:38] Amen. Because if if you if you don't
[1:04:40] give that man back his wife, I'mma kill
[1:04:42] you and everybody in this household. So
[1:04:44] the man knew God meant business. And
[1:04:46] only the grace of God could come and
[1:04:49] bring freedom. Yeah. Hallelujah. To
[1:04:52] Sarah and to Abraham. And it's only the
[1:04:55] grace of God that can come and bring a
[1:04:57] jubilee to us. Y'all got to watch
[1:05:00] things. Y'all got to watch things. Be
[1:05:03] spiritual. Be spiritual. If you're not
[1:05:05] spiritual, you're going to miss
[1:05:06] everything God is doing. Now, watch.
[1:05:09] Amen. We saw uh that the the the the
[1:05:12] Jubilee or the restoration occurred.
[1:05:14] Regardless of the conditions, regardless
[1:05:16] of how Sarah and Abraham were in
[1:05:17] bondage, the Jubilee still occurred. And
[1:05:20] regardless of your condition, Amen. the
[1:05:22] Jubilee occurs. Brother Brandham made
[1:05:25] the statement, and I'm just quoting
[1:05:26] this. I'm I didn't pull this up for you
[1:05:28] to pull up there, but just a a quick
[1:05:30] quote. Every seven years they let the
[1:05:32] ground rest. They grow no fruit on it or
[1:05:36] uh uh planted no crops. They let the
[1:05:38] crops in the field rest every seven
[1:05:39] years. And at that time was a jubilee.
[1:05:42] Amen. And so we were reading uh
[1:05:44] Leviticus last week uh praise the Lord.
[1:05:47] And Leviticus
[1:05:49] 25:1-7 or it talks about how the land
[1:05:52] was supposed to be given rest on the
[1:05:54] seventh year. Hallelujah. And he said,
[1:05:56] "Now don't plant. Don't don't worry
[1:05:58] about planning. Don't don't do
[1:05:59] anything." Amen. In that seventh year,
[1:06:01] this was a uh if the land got rest, the
[1:06:04] land received a jubilee, the land
[1:06:06] received a release, the land itself,
[1:06:09] right? And and and I and I know God is
[1:06:11] more concerned about you than he's just
[1:06:13] concerned about land. Amen. So if the
[1:06:16] land got a jubilee and all they had to
[1:06:18] do is be obedient and just follow God's
[1:06:20] instructions, then he put a question for
[1:06:23] them in Leviticus 25:20. We read it last
[1:06:27] week. I'll read it for you again. But
[1:06:28] the question was, "And if ye shall say,
[1:06:31] yeah, what shall we eat the seventh
[1:06:35] year?" Now, you done told us, Moses,
[1:06:37] amen, to to not do anything during this
[1:06:39] this the seventh year. Uh but but what
[1:06:41] what what what we going to eat in the
[1:06:44] seventh year? If we don't plant our
[1:06:46] crops, if we don't do anything, what are
[1:06:48] we going to eat? Amen. In the seventh
[1:06:50] year, he says, "Behold, we shall not sow
[1:06:52] nor gather in our increase. Nothing
[1:06:54] going to happen in the seventh year.
[1:06:56] It's a year of rest." Praise God.
[1:06:59] Hallelujah. If you would just if you'll
[1:07:02] trust me now, if you'll obey my word, I
[1:07:06] got something for you. Hallelujah. If
[1:07:09] you'll bake me a cake first. Hallelujah.
[1:07:14] Huh? That's what that's what Elijah had
[1:07:16] to tell the sister. If you'll bake me a
[1:07:18] cake first, I guarantee
[1:07:20] Hallelujah. Your barrel will never go
[1:07:23] empty. And your cruise will not run dry.
[1:07:27] Now, it may it may look like it's going
[1:07:29] empty. Your bank account sometimes may
[1:07:32] look like it's going empty. But somehow
[1:07:35] someway out of somewhere
[1:07:40] [Applause]
[1:07:42] Somewhere
[1:07:43] between here, Amen. my empty bank
[1:07:47] account. It look empty, but somewhere
[1:07:50] between here and when that bill is due,
[1:07:55] God is going to
[1:07:57] move. Somewhere between here and there,
[1:08:01] God is going to
[1:08:03] move. He did it before.
[1:08:07] He'll do it again.
[1:08:14] Don't tell me I done seen him do it too
[1:08:16] many times.
[1:08:18] [Applause]
[1:08:21] [Music]
[1:08:22] [Applause]
[1:08:24] I I I should wait till Sunday on
[1:08:26] Wednesday night when we have our
[1:08:28] testimony service. But I might Let me

[1:09:14] Lord.

[1:09:19] And you know where he got his money
[1:09:21] from?
[1:09:23] Amen. A fish had the money in his mouth.
[1:09:26] God, I need a fish.
[1:09:29] [Music]
[1:09:29] [Applause]
[1:09:32] I prayed that on one night.
[1:09:34] Next day I I had a a text going back and
[1:09:37] forth and um somebody say, "Oh, you
[1:09:41] know, I I thought this and I thought
[1:09:42] that. I was looking at your account and
[1:09:43] I thought this." Oh, but you got to
[1:09:45] check this other account over here. It's
[1:09:47] a business. Like, oh, I didn't know you
[1:09:50] had that kind of money sitting in the
[1:09:51] account. I said, "Yeah, uh that's last
[1:09:54] year the Lord blessed and we had this. I
[1:09:56] just didn't do nothing with it." Well,
[1:09:57] you can take a bonus.
[1:10:00] You know, the the bonus was enough to
[1:10:02] pay
[1:10:05] I got myself a fish.
[1:10:10] And the fish came the very next day.
[1:10:18] Oh, hallelujah. Look, if you need a
[1:10:21] fish, God will give you a fish. Just
[1:10:23] pray and see. God, you'll know how it's
[1:10:25] going to come.
[1:10:28] But be obedient.
[1:10:31] Bake me a cake first. Oh my. You know
[1:10:34] how the devil like to talk to you. Oh
[1:10:36] no, you you just got that. Now what you
[1:10:38] Yeah, you going to pay your tithe on
[1:10:39] what you just got.
[1:10:42] Make sure you pay your tithe. That's how
[1:10:44] the blessings keep flowing.
[1:10:46] Oh my. I ain't getting I ain't getting
[1:10:48] very far here today, Lord.
[1:10:53] Here. Um the
[1:10:56] um so in verse 20 uh uh uh uh it says,
[1:11:00] "Behold, we shall not sow nor gather in
[1:11:02] our increase." So if you're obedient,
[1:11:03] God says, "Now I want the seventh year
[1:11:05] to be a year of rest, also a year of
[1:11:07] release." Another another uh type of the
[1:11:09] jubilee. He says, "And so if you if
[1:11:12] you're obedient, now what happens in the
[1:11:14] 21st verse says, then will I
[1:11:18] command it." Can you you got that? if
[1:11:22] the blessing didn't even want to come
[1:11:24] your way.
[1:11:26] But because of commandment,
[1:11:31] oh Lord, how many people done God don't
[1:11:35] they don't walk right by you. The Lord
[1:11:37] already done told him, "Get him get him
[1:11:39] that." Yeah. Yeah. I know this happened
[1:11:42] to a preacher friend of mine, sister. Um
[1:11:45] the Lord had told her to give a certain
[1:11:47] amount to the preacher, right? and she
[1:11:49] uh she said uh well he'll need all that.
[1:11:57] She went and just wrote what she wanted
[1:11:58] to write, right? And she gave and
[1:12:00] thought that would appease God. And uh
[1:12:03] throughout the the the weekend meetings,
[1:12:05] God just kept dealing with her. Now I
[1:12:07] told you she couldn't even get free in
[1:12:08] the service. My God because she had not
[1:12:11] been obedient. And and say now I told
[1:12:14] you what to do. I told I gave you the
[1:12:16] amount to give to that preacher. And he
[1:12:18] just went on that not thinking nothing
[1:12:19] of it. He getting ready to catch his
[1:12:21] flight to go back home. And the sister
[1:12:23] calling the pastor say, "Wait, is the
[1:12:24] brother still there? Is he I got to come
[1:12:26] to your house. I got to come right now.
[1:12:27] I can't I can't I I can't I can't rest
[1:12:28] until I get this done." He said, "The
[1:12:30] Lord told me to give him a certain
[1:12:31] amount." I thought within myself that he
[1:12:33] was all right. He ain't need all of
[1:12:34] that. But the Lord told me to do. So
[1:12:36] here the rest of it that God told me. It
[1:12:38] was exactly what the preacher needed.
[1:12:42] Hallelujah.
[1:12:45] People walk right by you and they got
[1:12:47] the blessing that God done commanded
[1:12:48] them to give to you. Oh yeah.
[1:12:50] Hallelujah. May may May may maybe your
[1:12:52] job is trying to hold up a a promotion.
[1:12:56] Amen. But God God said God said, "I will
[1:12:59] command
[1:13:01] my blessing upon you in the sixth year."
[1:13:05] And I love this part. And it shall bring
[1:13:08] forth fruit. Amen.
[1:13:11] Amen. For three years. Amen. Amen. Now,
[1:13:16] for me, these ain't just promises that
[1:13:20] are for Israel. Right. If God put it in
[1:13:24] his words, we are like brother like like
[1:13:26] like brother Simba said this morning, we
[1:13:28] are spiritual Israel. We ought to expect
[1:13:30] the same thing. Now, I'm not planting
[1:13:32] crops and selling food to people to make
[1:13:35] my money. But I got a business that I'm
[1:13:38] running.
[1:13:39] Hallelujah. Amen. I got other things
[1:13:41] that I'm involved in and I look for
[1:13:44] those things to be blessed just like
[1:13:46] they land was blessed.
[1:13:49] I'm expecting my business to be blessed.
[1:13:52] So much business that I can take a year
[1:13:55] off.
[1:14:02] What you think they did in the jubilee
[1:14:04] year? They took a year off. Uhhuh.
[1:14:09] Glor.
[1:14:11] They weren't supposed to sew no more in
[1:14:12] the next year. No reaping in the next
[1:14:14] year. They took a full year off.
[1:14:18] And and so now here's the other thing.
[1:14:19] The reason they're getting three years
[1:14:20] worth so so the first year, the Jubilee
[1:14:23] year, uh you're not going to work. All
[1:14:26] right? So we got we got to eat from, you
[1:14:28] know, what we got last year. And not
[1:14:30] only that, when we sew the next year,
[1:14:33] the eighth year is when we start sewing
[1:14:34] again. Now, it's not going to grow
[1:14:37] immediately, right? You got to wait for
[1:14:39] that to actually grow. So, you have to
[1:14:41] have an overflow from two years ago
[1:14:43] that's carrying you even in the eighth
[1:14:45] year. Amen. That's right.
[1:14:49] [Applause]
[1:14:51] God done thought this thing all the way
[1:14:53] through. God going to take care of you
[1:14:55] in the sixth year, in the seventh year,
[1:14:58] in the eighth year, in the ninth year.
[1:15:01] Whatever year you got, God going to take
[1:15:03] care of you.
[1:15:05] And when you see the overflow,
[1:15:07] you know it's time for a jubilee.
[1:15:11] Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:15:15] Let me move forward. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:15:17] Also here in Luke 4, let's pick it up
[1:15:20] again. Isaiah 61 was referring to Luke
[1:15:26] 4 verse
[1:15:30] um 16.
[1:15:33] Praise the
[1:15:36] Lord. It says
[1:15:39] um and he came to Nazareth where he had
[1:15:44] been brought up and as his custom was he
[1:15:46] went into the synagogue on the Sabbath
[1:15:49] day and stood up for to
[1:15:53] read. And there was delivered unto him
[1:15:56] the book of the prophet Isaiah. So here
[1:15:59] they come bringing Isaiah to to Jesus
[1:16:02] not even knowing what they doing. They
[1:16:05] could have picked Jeremiah. They could
[1:16:07] have put pick, you know, one of the book
[1:16:08] that Moses wrote, but no, they bring
[1:16:10] Isaiah.
[1:16:13] Jesus knowing knowing exactly where he
[1:16:15] was. I I believe he's there by vision.
[1:16:18] He already know what they're getting
[1:16:20] ready to do. They don't know it, but he
[1:16:22] knows. So he says, it says, "And there
[1:16:25] was delivered unto him the book of the
[1:16:27] prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened
[1:16:28] the book, he found the place where it
[1:16:32] was written. So he turned to Isaiah 61,
[1:16:34] the same way we just turned this
[1:16:36] morning. The spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:16:39] me because he hath anointed me. Can you
[1:16:43] imagine Jesus reading this to them? I am
[1:16:47] the very
[1:16:49] fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah.
[1:16:53] The spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:16:56] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:17:00] the gospel to the poor. Amen. Uh he hath
[1:17:04] sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to
[1:17:07] preach deliverance to the captives, and
[1:17:10] recovering of sight to the blind, to set
[1:17:14] at liberty them that are bruised, to
[1:17:18] preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
[1:17:21] of the Lord. Now here the Bible says,
[1:17:23] "And he closed the book, and he gave it
[1:17:27] again to the minister and sat
[1:17:31] down, and the eyes of all them that were
[1:17:35] in the synagogue were fastened on him."
[1:17:39] He must have read this in a certain way.
[1:17:42] Now these people like, "What? What is
[1:17:45] what
[1:17:46] is what's going on here in church today?
[1:17:50] How could this man take that script and
[1:17:52] read it and make it so personal?
[1:17:57] So they are their eyes are fixed on him.
[1:17:59] He's sitting down and their eyes are
[1:18:01] fixed on him and and and look at what
[1:18:03] the scripture say. And he began to say
[1:18:05] unto them, "This day
[1:18:10] is this scripture
[1:18:13] fulfilled in your ears?"
[1:18:18] That was the end of the sermon. And he
[1:18:20] preached it sitting down.
[1:18:25] Yeah. Brother Random tells us something
[1:18:27] here in the message. Why are people so
[1:18:30] tossed about?
[1:18:33] It says something here and I want us to
[1:18:36] get it. Says some people
[1:18:39] gets the wrong impression of what the
[1:18:42] anointing is.
[1:18:45] My God. He says, "Did you ever think of
[1:18:49] that some people gets the wrong
[1:18:51] impression?" Right? Some people gets I
[1:18:53] think I put some people gets the all
[1:18:56] right says some people gets the wrong
[1:18:58] impression of what the anointing is. Did
[1:19:01] you ever think of it of that? It says,
[1:19:04] "When was the greatest anointing ever
[1:19:08] give to anyone?" Now, and I I think this
[1:19:12] is important because, you know, when we
[1:19:13] we we we we come to church last week and
[1:19:16] as soon as the song service started,
[1:19:18] man, y'all was y'all was up here. And
[1:19:21] actually, I think sister um Shalom was
[1:19:24] playing the same song that Brother Tate
[1:19:26] just come and sung. And and that it just
[1:19:29] it was up here. It was up here. I I we
[1:19:32] was high. The brothers was asking me
[1:19:34] say, "Y'all do that all the time." I
[1:19:35] say, "Bro, not all the time. It don't be
[1:19:36] like that." But but today it was. And
[1:19:39] and then and then soon as brother Tate
[1:19:41] come up here and they hit that song,
[1:19:42] y'all were all over it all over again.
[1:19:44] And certain songs carry you through
[1:19:46] certain seasons. And you would feel like
[1:19:48] that's a great anointing. It was. But
[1:19:51] the greatest anointing.
[1:19:54] All right. The greatest anointing that
[1:19:57] was ever given to anyone was Jesus
[1:20:00] Christ. We have the spirit by measure.
[1:20:03] He had it without measure. And one day
[1:20:06] he entered into the temple and picked up
[1:20:08] the scroll and read and said, "The
[1:20:11] spirit of God is upon me, for he has
[1:20:14] anointed me to preach the acceptable
[1:20:16] year, to bind up the broken hearts, to
[1:20:18] heal the sick, give sight to the blind."
[1:20:20] And now we would think if such an
[1:20:22] anointing was on him, that that had been
[1:20:24] prophesied 800 years before that that it
[1:20:28] would come. Here he was with that type
[1:20:30] of anointing and the full blessing and
[1:20:32] anointing of the Lord upon him. We would
[1:20:35] want to run all over the building.
[1:20:39] Hallelujah. Scream and holler. But the
[1:20:43] Bible said he laid down the scroll and
[1:20:46] sat down and precious words proceeded
[1:20:50] from his mouth. That's what he done
[1:20:53] under the anointing.
[1:20:55] Look at what he says here. The anointing
[1:20:59] is not
[1:21:01] emotions. However, blessings are
[1:21:04] emotions.
[1:21:07] Don't get that wrong now. That that
[1:21:09] we're not preaching this to take the
[1:21:11] emotions out of the church. Cuz when God
[1:21:14] blesses you, it's going to produce some
[1:21:15] type of emotion.
[1:21:18] When I got an unexpected bonus, I was
[1:21:20] thanking God for it. But the anointing,
[1:21:23] don't get confused now with anointing.
[1:21:25] The anointing is not emotions. The
[1:21:27] anointing
[1:21:29] is supreme power in control. Amen. Amen.
[1:21:36] What that simply means is when you know
[1:21:37] who you are in Christ.
[1:21:40] All right. Amen. When you recognize your
[1:21:43] position in Christ, when you recognize
[1:21:46] your place, can't nobody shake you from
[1:21:48] it. All right. All right. All right.
[1:21:50] Amen. Because you anointed. All right,
[1:21:53] Father. Amen. Oh, I know what I'm
[1:21:55] talking about. That's right. It don't
[1:21:57] matter what nobody say at all. But when
[1:22:00] you got your own revelation, your own
[1:22:03] understanding, something that God gave
[1:22:04] to you,
[1:22:06] I I don't have I'm not sharing a group
[1:22:08] revelation. Come on, brother. Amen.
[1:22:10] Amen. When when he asked him disciples,
[1:22:12] he said, he says, "Who do men group who
[1:22:16] do men say that I am?" And this is what
[1:22:18] men were saying. And then then he say,
[1:22:21] "No, no, no. I heard what they had to
[1:22:22] say. But who do you say that I, the son
[1:22:26] of man, am? Peter had his own
[1:22:29] revelation. And he didn't care if nobody
[1:22:31] else. Y'all ain't going to say nothing.
[1:22:32] You ain't got nothing to say. Nothing.
[1:22:35] All right. I'mma be the one. I'mma step
[1:22:37] out here and say what's been revealed to
[1:22:39] me. Thou art the Christ,
[1:22:42] the son of the living God.
[1:22:46] Amen. Amen. And because his revelation
[1:22:50] identified Christ perfectly, then Christ
[1:22:52] could let Peter know who he was. Amen.
[1:22:55] Amen. Thou art Peter. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:23:00] Gave him a name change. And it say it
[1:23:02] says, "And upon this," it says, he say,
[1:23:04] "Flesh and blood didn't reveal this."
[1:23:05] You didn't get a group revelation,
[1:23:06] Peter, but my father gave you this
[1:23:08] revelation. That's right. And since my
[1:23:10] daddy gave it to you, it's upon this
[1:23:13] rock. I'm going to build my church and
[1:23:16] the gates of hell will never prevail
[1:23:17] against it.
[1:23:19] The anointing is supreme power
[1:23:22] in control.
[1:23:24] Like knowing exactly what and how and
[1:23:27] that's what's
[1:23:31] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Are y'all Did
[1:23:33] y'all catch that? Yeah. The the the
[1:23:35] anointing is not emotions. The anointing
[1:23:37] is supreme power and control like
[1:23:39] knowing exactly what and how. See, and
[1:23:43] that's what's here. Godraise God. Praise
[1:23:47] God. You know, I believe the angel told
[1:23:49] the prophet to pick up his pen and
[1:23:50] write. And he and it says those in the
[1:23:53] bride will only do his will. No one can
[1:23:55] make them do otherwise. That's right.
[1:23:58] Hallelujah. They have thus sayaith the
[1:24:00] Lord or they keep still. All right. Yes,
[1:24:03] sir, brother. Nobody can make the bride
[1:24:05] do nothing. Right. The rod has an
[1:24:08] anointing on her. It's supreme power and
[1:24:11] control. She know where she stand with
[1:24:13] the word. Amen. All right, let me move
[1:24:16] on. I got something else to say. Uh I
[1:24:19] want to go to this sermon, the mark of
[1:24:20] the beast. Brother Brandham uh refers to
[1:24:24] this. I I didn't read uh Leviticus 25,
[1:24:27] but uh I read it last week. I read a
[1:24:29] portion of it, but uh Leviticus 25 is
[1:24:31] what actually told them uh they would
[1:24:34] count seven Sabbaths. And then uh on
[1:24:36] that seventh Sabbath, the day after that
[1:24:38] seventh Sabbath, which would be uh 50
[1:24:40] days, seven Sabbaths would be equal
[1:24:43] seven weeks, seven full weeks. And on
[1:24:46] the 50th day, it would be a time of
[1:24:48] jubilee. And when they had that jubilee,
[1:24:51] uh actually a seven uh um I want to say
[1:24:54] it was 49 years, not just 49 days, but
[1:24:57] um uh 49 years. And then that 50th year
[1:24:59] was a 50 year of jubilee. All right. So
[1:25:02] when they when they when they when they
[1:25:03] went into that jubilee season, it didn't
[1:25:05] matter how much debt you were in, right?
[1:25:09] Your debt was canceled.
[1:25:13] That that just let you know how God feel
[1:25:14] about your debt. God don't even want you
[1:25:16] under the burden of death.
[1:25:18] And there always comes a little season
[1:25:21] in your life where God does something to
[1:25:23] release you from debt.
[1:25:25] The problem is we make bad decisions.
[1:25:29] And we find our way right back into
[1:25:31] debt.
[1:25:33] Don't Don't do that, church. Ask God for
[1:25:35] wisdom. Lord, I I I I feel that I have
[1:25:39] an abundance. Show me how to make this
[1:25:40] last for three years. Amen. Amen. I got
[1:25:45] I got to move on cuz there's so much
[1:25:47] that happened here today this morning.
[1:25:49] Um
[1:25:51] let me let me let me read this out of
[1:25:52] Mark of the Beast and then I I I'll say
[1:25:54] something else here. Okay. Yeah. Mark of
[1:25:58] the Beast. It says this. Now in the Old
[1:26:00] Testament, the Bible said that there was
[1:26:02] to be a 50th year jubilee. That was
[1:26:05] seven times seven years. And in the 49th
[1:26:08] year that w that it was to be made ready
[1:26:11] and the 50th year was the jubilee year.
[1:26:14] 50 means jubilee. 50 is God's jubilee
[1:26:20] number. 50
[1:26:22] uh it says this now 50 means jubilee. 50
[1:26:26] is God's jubilee number. The word
[1:26:29] Pentecost means 50.
[1:26:34] So the Jubilee year, amen, occurred at
[1:26:38] the 50th year. Okay? And uh and then
[1:26:42] brother Brandham is telling us also the
[1:26:43] word Pentecost. Actually, I'm going to
[1:26:45] read something for you in in in a little
[1:26:46] bit, but in the Jewish language, pent.
[1:26:51] Yeah. Just p means 50, right? But now
[1:26:55] it's pent. Hallelujah. So, so, so we see
[1:26:59] there's a connection. Amen. in the
[1:27:02] Jubilee year and the day of Pentecost.
[1:27:07] Hallelujah. Watch what the prophet says
[1:27:09] here now. He says um uh it was uh 50 is
[1:27:12] God's jubilee number. The word Pentecost
[1:27:14] means 50. It was the outpouring of the
[1:27:17] Holy Spirit at the end of the 50 days.
[1:27:20] It was also the end of the 50th year.
[1:27:23] Yeah. My God. Jesus come to foreshadow
[1:27:27] or forewarn rather the people of the
[1:27:30] coming year of Jubilee. So, so now what
[1:27:33] he's what he's telling us when Jesus
[1:27:35] picked up the scripture, amen, in Isaiah
[1:27:38] and began to read about this acceptable
[1:27:41] year, he said Jesus was actually
[1:27:43] forewarning or letting them know about a
[1:27:46] coming year of Jubilee.
[1:27:49] Oh my my my. It says he went into the
[1:27:52] synagogue at Capernaum and sat down
[1:27:54] taken a scripture and turned it over to
[1:27:56] Isaiah 6:11 and read this scripture. The
[1:27:59] spirit of the Lord is upon me has
[1:28:00] anointed me to preach the acceptable
[1:28:02] year of the Lord to set the captives at
[1:28:03] liberty and to give sight to the blind.
[1:28:05] And when he got through reading, he sat
[1:28:07] down and hand the scripture back to the
[1:28:09] priest. And he said, "This day this
[1:28:11] scripture is fulfilled in your ears and
[1:28:13] eyes." He says, "You see it? For he was
[1:28:16] giving forth a warning of the coming
[1:28:18] forth of the great gusher of Pentecost
[1:28:23] to set at liberty everyone that was
[1:28:25] slaves to sin and bound. And that's the
[1:28:28] thing, you know,
[1:28:30] um uh uh when somebody is a slave to
[1:28:33] sin, they actually can't help
[1:28:35] themselves. Right.
[1:28:38] No matter no matter what happens, they
[1:28:40] kind of get free for a little bit and
[1:28:42] somehow they find themselves right back
[1:28:44] in the bondage again. They they're a
[1:28:47] slave to that thing, right? People don't
[1:28:49] want to smoke. People don't want to
[1:28:52] drink that. I mean, they see all the
[1:28:53] stuff uh that is doing to them. They
[1:28:55] they they see the same articles that
[1:28:56] everybody else see. You know what that's
[1:28:58] doing to your lungs? How could
[1:29:00] you want to? They they know all that.
[1:29:03] But there's a spirit that has them
[1:29:05] bound. Hallelujah. And it take the Holy
[1:29:08] Ghost to set them free. And when the
[1:29:11] Holy Ghost set you free, look, when when
[1:29:13] when when it when when when a when when
[1:29:14] when that house is empty, those demons
[1:29:17] leave, you got to get something else
[1:29:18] inside the house to fill the house so
[1:29:22] that when them demons come back, they
[1:29:23] won't have no opportunity to take
[1:29:26] residence again.
[1:29:29] [Applause]
[1:29:30] Did you believe Trump is sounding?
[1:29:31] Somebody's going free. Amen. Praise God.
[1:29:34] Amen. It's not based on a feeling. It's
[1:29:36] not based on emotion. It's based on a
[1:29:38] revelation of knowing who you are. Now,
[1:29:41] Brother Brandham just tied that 50th
[1:29:44] year Jubilee to the 50th day after Jesus
[1:29:48] was on the cross. Uh 50 days later, I
[1:29:50] believe, is when um uh um the the the
[1:29:54] the day of Pentecost came. So, he's
[1:29:56] tying both of these together. It's a
[1:29:57] it's a jubilee uh in the spirit. Now, I
[1:29:59] want to I want to catch something here.
[1:30:02] I want to catch something
[1:30:08] here. I uh I have this little
[1:30:12] book. Amen. Uh years ago, I picked it up
[1:30:16] at the uh at
[1:30:19] the fair and you know they had like the
[1:30:22] little book expo and and I saw this one
[1:30:25] guy had a book and he was a Jewish man
[1:30:28] selling selling books about you know
[1:30:30] just the religion of the Jews and and
[1:30:32] how it kind of connected to uh the New
[1:30:36] Testament. Now uh I I I'm telling you my
[1:30:38] source. I'm not just reading this and
[1:30:40] and then you know not giving you my
[1:30:41] source. Thank you, brother. Yeah. Thank
[1:30:44] you so much. I always appreciate Brother
[1:30:48] Joseph being in church. Amen.
[1:30:52] It's I appreciate him. Appreciate him a
[1:30:54] lot. Um but the uh this this man, you
[1:30:59] know, like I say, um I I I don't
[1:31:02] necessarily read a lot of stuff. This
[1:31:03] guy's name is Douglas Carmel, but I saw
[1:31:06] this when I picked it said, "Yeah, I
[1:31:07] wanted to, you know, just maybe kind of
[1:31:09] learn about these these um feasts that
[1:31:13] the children of Israel had. The feast of
[1:31:14] Passover, the feast of unleven bread,
[1:31:16] feast of first fruits and feast of
[1:31:18] weeks, um the feast of trumpets, the the
[1:31:21] day of atonement, and and you know, also
[1:31:23] the the feast of tabernacles. So, there
[1:31:25] are some things that they say that this
[1:31:26] man said from a Jewish perspective that
[1:31:30] I thought was very very good. And and
[1:31:32] like I say, I'm I'm hesitant. Uh, I
[1:31:35] don't I don't recommend y'all just go
[1:31:36] get any book and read it. You have to
[1:31:38] filter things through the the lens of
[1:31:40] the message. Amen. Now, I'm going to
[1:31:44] read, you know, something here because
[1:31:45] it's going to kind of come come back.
[1:31:47] We've already read, you know, some of
[1:31:49] these things from scripture, but uh I
[1:31:51] want to just read, you know, just just
[1:31:53] some things that they said. He is uh
[1:31:55] focusing here uh out of Leviticus 23.
[1:31:58] And uh uh this is where we get a number
[1:32:01] of these feasts there. So I want to kind
[1:32:03] of talk about this feast of weeks which
[1:32:05] is the feast of Pentecost. Okay. And um
[1:32:09] before the feast of weeks there would be
[1:32:11] the feast of first fruits. Now what
[1:32:14] happens during the feast of first fruits
[1:32:16] is the very first thing in your field
[1:32:20] that comes to maturity like if you had
[1:32:22] some some any anything that you plant in
[1:32:24] your crop any what the very first thing
[1:32:26] that comes to maturity what you're
[1:32:27] supposed to do is bring that thing to
[1:32:29] God and present it in a wave offering.
[1:32:32] Hallelujah. Amen. So you know what would
[1:32:35] happen during that that that feast they
[1:32:37] they would present that and it would be
[1:32:39] a wave offering before the Lord. This
[1:32:40] the first thing that come to maturity
[1:32:42] but it also showed that there was going
[1:32:44] to be other things coming to maturity as
[1:32:46] as well. Now, now, now the first what
[1:32:48] was accepted, amen, at Christ's uh
[1:32:50] death, he was a wave offering before
[1:32:53] God. But there was going to be other
[1:32:56] people that was going to reach the same
[1:32:58] level of maturity. Hallelujah. That
[1:33:01] represents us will be presented before
[1:33:04] God. Oh my my my. Now, now, now they
[1:33:07] made some statements here, and I just
[1:33:08] wanted to I want you to catch this
[1:33:10] because
[1:33:11] um this morning, and and let me just
[1:33:14] kind of uh just set this up this
[1:33:18] morning. We um I you know, we're here in
[1:33:21] prayer and and I didn't I didn't catch
[1:33:23] the text, but I believe one of the
[1:33:25] brothers was supposed to be here to pray
[1:33:26] and and then he wasn't able to do it.
[1:33:28] So, uh, they asked another brother to
[1:33:31] pray. And then I got a a personal text
[1:33:33] from one brother said, "Hey, could you
[1:33:34] step in for me cuz I'm going to be late
[1:33:36] and I'm I was praying. I didn't see the
[1:33:38] text." And then when I got the the the
[1:33:40] next one, uh, the next set of textes,
[1:33:42] another brother said, "Well, I won't be
[1:33:44] there." Said, "Can somebody step in?"
[1:33:45] "Yeah, I got it. I'll step in." Brother
[1:33:47] Simba stepped in. It wasn't even
[1:33:48] supposed to be his day. And Brother
[1:33:50] Simba not just stepped in. Brother Simba
[1:33:53] stepped into the sermon. Praise God.
[1:33:57] Praise God. Amen. What I'm going to read
[1:34:00] from this book was what Sup brother
[1:34:02] Simba read today in prayer. Now watch
[1:34:05] this. Watch the statement that they
[1:34:07] make. We're talking about the feast of
[1:34:11] uh uh of
[1:34:13] Pentecost. It says uh like the previous
[1:34:17] feast of first fruits, this holiday also
[1:34:20] acknowledged God as the source of their
[1:34:22] agricultural blessings. It says
[1:34:25] specifically by giving to God some of
[1:34:27] the first fruits of the land again. This
[1:34:30] time it was from the wheat harvest. As a
[1:34:32] matter of fact, the bountiful harvest or
[1:34:37] lack thereof was distinctly tied to
[1:34:39] Israel's commitment to the Mosaic law.
[1:34:42] So now notice the words that they use.
[1:34:44] The bountiful harvest. Now why did they
[1:34:47] get a bountiful harvest? Because in the
[1:34:50] sixth year, if you obeyed God's
[1:34:53] commandment not to sew in the seventh
[1:34:55] year, in the sixth year, the bountiful
[1:34:58] harvest was that you were going to get
[1:34:59] three years worth. Yes, sir. Amen. All
[1:35:03] right. So, they said the bountiful
[1:35:04] harvest or lack thereof was distinctly
[1:35:06] tied to Israel's commitment to the
[1:35:09] Mosaic law as the Mosaic law told them.
[1:35:12] And they tied the Mosaic law to a
[1:35:15] scripture in
[1:35:18] Deuteronomy 7 verse 11
[1:35:22] through13. The exact scripture that
[1:35:26] brother Simba walked up here and read.
[1:35:30] [Applause]
[1:35:31] Let me just try to break this down. You
[1:35:34] can pull up Deuteronomy 11 and uh and
[1:35:37] and and verse uh what did I just read?
[1:35:40] 71 11-13. just get that ready. But but
[1:35:43] let me let me just try to uh put this in
[1:35:45] in in a better context. When Jesus
[1:35:49] went into the temple, they brought him
[1:35:52] the book and he turned to Isaiah and he
[1:35:57] read Isaiah. My God. My God. Today,
[1:36:01] Brother Simba was not supposed to be the
[1:36:03] one closing out prayer, but they gave
[1:36:05] him the book. All right.
[1:36:09] Amen. Right. Amen. Huh? And he read
[1:36:13] Deuteronomy. What? What is Deuteronomy?
[1:36:16] What? 7. He uh verse uh is it 11:7?
[1:36:22] 711.
[1:36:24] Deuteronomy 711. Now, he walked in this
[1:36:27] morning and he read Deuteronomy 711.
[1:36:33] Is that right? 12. Is it? Let me I got
[1:36:36] it right here. I'm I'm trying to go off
[1:36:38] memory here. Deuteronomy 7 verse 11.
[1:36:43] There we go. Now, this is important to
[1:36:45] me because as I mean here they picked it
[1:36:48] up in this book and they say if they was
[1:36:50] just obeying the blessings of God, these
[1:36:51] are the things that would happen. Now,
[1:36:53] it's not just a blessing. Amen. Just for
[1:36:57] your crops. Right.
[1:37:00] And again, now now y'all bear with me.
[1:37:02] I'm I'm I'm I'm kind of running out of
[1:37:03] time. But
[1:37:11] but but but listen listen uh like I say,
[1:37:14] I don't I'm not planting uh stuff in the
[1:37:17] ground, right? And making money off the
[1:37:19] stuff that I plant in the ground. I I
[1:37:20] have a business. So the way that they
[1:37:23] got their land blessed, I'm expecting my
[1:37:25] business to be blessed.
[1:37:28] Huh. Amen. We We have a church that we
[1:37:31] need and I'm expecting that to be
[1:37:34] blessed.
[1:37:35] Come on, somebody. Whatever I find my
[1:37:39] hands involved in, I'm expecting that to
[1:37:43] be blessed.
[1:37:45] Amen. Amen. Come on, church. If you got
[1:37:49] just a a I mean, you got a 9 to5, you
[1:37:52] ought to be expect you ought to expect
[1:37:53] to be blessed on your 9 to5.
[1:37:57] I expect increase. Yeah, I expect
[1:38:00] promotions.
[1:38:02] I expect raises when I didn't even ask
[1:38:04] for a raise. Huh? These are the things
[1:38:07] that I'm expecting.
[1:38:10] [Applause]
[1:38:12] Yes, sir.
[1:38:15] Yes, sir. But but these blessings went
[1:38:17] beyond just the land. And this is what
[1:38:19] brother Simba was bringing out this
[1:38:20] morning. And they they they tied the
[1:38:22] same thing. Thou shalt therefore keep
[1:38:24] the commandments. Yes, sir. and the
[1:38:26] statutes and the judgments which I
[1:38:28] command thee this day to do them. Yeah.
[1:38:31] Look at it now in the next verse.
[1:38:38] Wherefore it shall come to pass if you
[1:38:42] hearken to these judgments and keep and
[1:38:45] do them that the Lord thy God shall keep
[1:38:48] unto thee the covenant and the mercy
[1:38:51] which he swear unto thy fathers. Mhm.
[1:38:53] Now, God going to keep brother brother
[1:38:55] Simba say it's an equation.
[1:38:57] First part of the equation is that you
[1:38:59] got to keep your end of the bargain. And
[1:39:01] if you do your side of the bargain, then
[1:39:03] God got God got God got something that
[1:39:05] not not just not just not just keep his
[1:39:07] side, he going to overflow on the other
[1:39:09] side. All you got to do is follow the
[1:39:12] word. Amen. And what's the what's the
[1:39:15] word to some of us? Some of the word is
[1:39:17] simply just pay your tithe and offering.
[1:39:21] Amen. or you ain't even seen a blessing
[1:39:23] yet. Oh my. You don't even know what a
[1:39:25] blessing look like if you can't pay
[1:39:26] tithe and offering. Hallelujah. Pay your
[1:39:30] tithe and offering. And and you was
[1:39:32] like, "Lord, if the Lord just give me a
[1:39:33] little extra money, then I'm get started
[1:39:34] paying my tithe. He just gave it to you.
[1:39:41] But now I'm going tell you something. If
[1:39:43] you get if God even do something like
[1:39:45] that for you, he actually do it a little
[1:39:47] different than how he normally do it.
[1:39:49] Because typically God wants you to bake
[1:39:50] a cake first before he blesses you.
[1:39:54] But if on on on one side of the
[1:39:56] equation, if we just keep his
[1:39:57] commandments,
[1:40:00] it says, "Wherefore it shall come to
[1:40:01] pass if ye hearken to these judgments."
[1:40:04] Now, now look at what it say. It shall
[1:40:10] it shall come to pass if ye hearken to
[1:40:13] these judgments and keep and do them
[1:40:15] that the Lord thy God shall keep unto
[1:40:17] thee the covenant and the mercy which
[1:40:19] which he swear unto thy fathers. Verse
[1:40:22] 13, watch it. Now
[1:40:24] this is this is this is the other
[1:40:26] equation. He will love thee
[1:40:31] and bless thee.
[1:40:36] Now, I'm Can I just be honest? Let me
[1:40:38] just stop. If he loved me,
[1:40:43] [Applause]
[1:40:45] if he just stopped right there and just
[1:40:48] said he loved me, there would be more
[1:40:51] than enough for me. But he didn't stop
[1:40:54] there. He said, "I'm going to love you."
[1:40:57] Oh my
[1:41:00] man. If a man love his wife, he going to
[1:41:02] do things for his wife. If a wife love a
[1:41:05] husband, she going to do things for her
[1:41:07] husband. We are the bride of Jesus
[1:41:10] Christ. He will love us. He will bless
[1:41:13] us. He will multiply.
[1:41:16] [Applause]
[1:41:21] Yes sir. Thank you Jesus.
[1:41:33] up.
[1:41:36] In one scripture,
[1:41:39] I think it's 10 or 11 blessings in one
[1:41:41] scripture.
[1:41:44] Overflow.
[1:41:47] He will love thee
[1:41:49] and bless thee and multiply thee. He
[1:41:54] will also bless the fruit of thy womb on
[1:41:56] y'all. Now, now wait, wait, wait, wait,
[1:41:58] wait. Now, I'mma tell I'mma tell y'all
[1:42:02] chilling something.
[1:42:05] Y'all blessed because your parents are
[1:42:08] blessed.
[1:42:13] Now, I got to say something else. The
[1:42:16] Lord going to bless you one day, sir.
[1:42:18] You're going to get married, sir. And
[1:42:20] you're going to have children. If you
[1:42:22] want your children to be blessed, you're
[1:42:24] going to have to follow the same word
[1:42:27] that your parents followed. And these
[1:42:30] blessings will overtake generation after
[1:42:32] generation after generation.
[1:42:35] I believe my kids got jobs.
[1:42:39] They got certain jobs because of how I
[1:42:42] lived and how they mama live.
[1:42:47] Can I go a little further? Even though
[1:42:50] some of them might not be serving the
[1:42:51] Lord.
[1:42:53] [Applause]
[1:43:04] And and notice uh notice the promise
[1:43:08] now. It says he says bless the fruit of
[1:43:10] thy womb.
[1:43:12] There was no condition placed on the
[1:43:15] blessing. Hallelujah. Not for them. The
[1:43:17] blessing came through me because I
[1:43:20] followed the Lord. That's why the
[1:43:21] blessing came through me.
[1:43:24] I saw the Lord's and he heard and he
[1:43:28] answered me.
[1:43:30] That's why I trust him. That's why I
[1:43:34] trust in God.
[1:43:38] My
[1:43:41] savior. He will never
[1:43:44] [Applause]
[1:43:52] Glory to
[1:43:55] God. Man, there's blessing upon blessing
[1:43:58] upon blessing if we would just follow
[1:44:01] the Lord.
[1:44:04] [Applause]
[1:44:17] My
[1:44:19] [Applause]
[1:44:20] this blessing is flowing because of me.
[1:44:23] And sometime you can just give a
[1:44:25] scripture right back to your child. You
[1:44:26] know why you being blessed.
[1:44:29] Oh, don't you get it twisted.
[1:44:32] It ain't because of your goodness. It
[1:44:35] ain't because of nothing you done. It's
[1:44:38] all that God has done.
[1:44:42] Now, I want to give you some advice.
[1:44:45] When you have children, if you want the
[1:44:48] blessings to flow into your children,
[1:44:51] you better start following the Lord.
[1:45:01] [Applause]
[1:45:06] He will he will love thee
[1:45:09] and bless thee
[1:45:13] and multiply thee.
[1:45:15] Amen. I'm not supposed to have decrease,
[1:45:18] increase.
[1:45:20] Yes, sir. Glory to Amen. He will also
[1:45:23] bless the fruit of thy womb.
[1:45:26] Fruit of your land. And the fruit of thy
[1:45:27] land. That's my That's my business.
[1:45:31] Thy corn.
[1:45:34] And thy wine.
[1:45:37] And thine oil.
[1:45:44] the increase of thy kind. Hallelujah.
[1:45:47] And the flocks of thy sheep. Hallelujah.
[1:45:50] And the land which he swear unto thy
[1:45:52] fathers to give thee. Now that's where
[1:45:55] they stopped. But brother Simba kept
[1:45:56] reading. Yes, sir.
[1:45:59] and the Lord
[1:46:03] will take away from thee.
[1:46:06] [Applause]
[1:46:10] If the doctor can't do it, don't worry
[1:46:12] about it. Because we have a promise from
[1:46:14] God. He will take away
[1:46:18] away from thee all sickness,
[1:46:23] and will put none of the evil diseases
[1:46:25] of Egypt, which thou knowest upon thee,
[1:46:28] but will lay them upon all them that
[1:46:30] hate thee.
[1:46:32] Now, is there another verse to this? Did
[1:46:34] I miss I missed something?
[1:46:37] There it is.
[1:46:40] There it is.
[1:46:42] That's the other blessing that is
[1:46:45] supposed to flow when we obey the Lord.
[1:46:50] Brother, this ain't just about land.
[1:46:52] It's also about children.
[1:46:57] Brother Smiley told us this years ago,
[1:46:59] and we we were we've been riding this
[1:47:01] for a long time, and I'm still riding
[1:47:03] it. Thou shalt be blessed above all
[1:47:08] people. There shall not be
[1:47:12] male or female barren among you or among
[1:47:17] your cattle. That means somehow someway
[1:47:21] the barren will have children.
[1:47:29] And and listen listen I don't care what
[1:47:32] is stopping it because the next verse
[1:47:35] tells you see what happened in the next
[1:47:37] verse. We skipped it but now verse 15.
[1:47:39] and the Lord.
[1:47:42] Hallelujah. Whatever is stopping you
[1:47:44] from having a child, the Bible
[1:47:48] declares the Lord will take it
[1:47:52] away. Win in the year of
[1:47:59] Jubilee. Glory to God. The blessings are
[1:48:03] to overtake us in the sixth year.
[1:48:07] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:48:10] Oh, praise God.
[1:48:15] [Applause]
[1:48:17] I'm under expectation.
[1:48:20] I'm looking for children. I'm looking
[1:48:22] for my bank account to
[1:48:25] to increase.
[1:48:28] I'm looking for a church. I'm looking
[1:48:30] for a school.
[1:48:33] Man, I'm looking for everything. I think
[1:48:35] I I thank sister Z said, "Lord, just
[1:48:38] bless me with everything
[1:48:40] everything
[1:48:44] because you can't think of everything,
[1:48:46] so just include everything."
[1:48:54] All right,
[1:48:57] let me let me try to I I want to I want
[1:49:00] to go a little further in this. I'm I'm
[1:49:02] just about out of time. I I told my wife
[1:49:06] that I had a certain way that I wanted
[1:49:08] to bring this and and I didn't get to
[1:49:10] none of the things that I told her I
[1:49:13] want to get to.
[1:49:15] But uh I told her I was depending on the
[1:49:17] inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Just
[1:49:19] drive it home and we'll take bit by bit
[1:49:21] by bit until we get what we what we
[1:49:24] need. Amen.
[1:49:26] Amen. Now,
[1:49:30] um oh my let me I'm going just have to
[1:49:33] move on. Let's see here. Uh,
[1:49:38] okay. So, in this feast of weeks or what
[1:49:42] they call the feast of Pentecost as
[1:49:44] well, Israel was to take some of the
[1:49:47] finest flour from this wheat harvest and
[1:49:50] then bake two loaves of bread and offer
[1:49:52] them up at the temple along with other
[1:49:55] items like lambs, bulls, goats, and
[1:49:57] rams. And it says, "Interesting enough,
[1:50:00] these two loaves are baked with leaven."
[1:50:02] And levan is usually associated with
[1:50:04] sin. Uh and so as I said, the first
[1:50:08] feast of first fruits, they always
[1:50:09] brought their first uh wave offering, a
[1:50:12] wave loaf. It was the first thing to
[1:50:13] come to maturity. They waved that before
[1:50:15] the Lord. And then when they got to this
[1:50:17] feast of of weeks or Pentecost, then
[1:50:20] they would wave two loaves. And these
[1:50:22] two loaves would actually have levan in
[1:50:25] them, which was a type of sin, which
[1:50:26] represents us. We also are coming to a
[1:50:29] place of maturity in the word of God.
[1:50:32] Amen. We'll get to that same spot that
[1:50:34] Jesus got uh where uh the Lord was
[1:50:37] perfectly pleased. This is my beloved
[1:50:40] son in whom I am well pleased. God will
[1:50:44] also be able to say the same thing about
[1:50:45] us. These are my beloved sons and
[1:50:47] daughters in whom I am well pleased.
[1:50:51] Amen. Amen.
[1:50:54] Praise God. Amen.
[1:50:57] They go
[1:50:59] on and they say uh something
[1:51:03] here said according to the tradition of
[1:51:06] the
[1:51:08] rabbis they have deduced that since
[1:51:11] Israel left Egypt in the first month
[1:51:18] um and I want you to notice this. to say
[1:51:21] they the the rabbis in Jewish
[1:51:25] teaching. They actually believe that
[1:51:29] Israel left Egypt before they went to
[1:51:33] the wilderness that they left Egypt in
[1:51:36] the first month. I want to make this
[1:51:38] very clear because I don't want you to
[1:51:40] leave and say, "Well, brother Brandham
[1:51:41] said no. No, I said I'm reading a book
[1:51:44] here by this gentleman Douglas Camel and
[1:51:48] uh he's being that he is uh uh of the
[1:51:52] Jewish descent he's writing this about
[1:51:54] his own experience and what he is
[1:51:57] telling us in in their religion in their
[1:52:00] faith they actually believe the rabbis
[1:52:04] believe or they deduce that Israel left
[1:52:07] Egypt in the first month and in their
[1:52:09] calendar the first month is April. Mhm.
[1:52:16] And watch this. Yeah.
[1:52:19] Israel left Egypt in the first month,
[1:52:21] approximately April on our
[1:52:24] calendar. It says 50 days later brings
[1:52:27] us to the third month, approximately
[1:52:31] June on our calendar.
[1:52:33] And the scripture tells us that
[1:52:35] something historical that did indeed
[1:52:38] happen during the third month after
[1:52:40] Israel left
[1:52:42] Egypt. Now
[1:52:46] um just to let you know what happened 3
[1:52:50] months and they they they refer to
[1:52:51] Exodus 19. I don't have time to read all
[1:52:54] of this but what happens in Exodus 19?
[1:52:56] This is where Moses actually receives
[1:52:59] the law.
[1:53:01] So 50 days after leaving Egypt, which 50
[1:53:05] days 50 is a jubilee. 50 days after
[1:53:09] leaving Egypt and they left in April is
[1:53:12] what they're saying. Now now like I told
[1:53:14] you this is somebody else saying but let
[1:53:15] me just let me just pause for a quick
[1:53:17] second. The reason I can agree with this
[1:53:19] is because I remember brother Brandham
[1:53:21] reading a book one time and in the book
[1:53:24] he read that the same
[1:53:29] uh heel that Jesus died on was the same
[1:53:34] heel where they would they where they
[1:53:36] found Adam's skull.
[1:53:39] And brother brother Random said when he
[1:53:41] read that he he read it put the book
[1:53:44] down jumped up and start screaming and
[1:53:46] praising God. And he read it again. He
[1:53:49] he says, "Now, I don't know if it's
[1:53:50] true, but if it is, how perfect this
[1:53:53] would be."
[1:53:55] And and and I say the same thing. How
[1:53:57] perfect this would be at from leaving
[1:54:00] Egypt. 50 days later, Moses gets the
[1:54:03] law. Oh my my my. Now, now just stay
[1:54:06] with me. Just just just hang tight with
[1:54:08] me, right? Because brother Brandam said
[1:54:10] that uh uh it was the going forth the
[1:54:12] war when Jesus took the book. It was a
[1:54:14] going forth uh of the warning of the
[1:54:15] coming forth of a great gusher of
[1:54:17] Pentecost. So now after Jesus had died
[1:54:20] 50 days later, praise God, there was a
[1:54:23] Jubilee trumpet sounding, it was the
[1:54:25] Pentecostal Jubilee. Now watch what they
[1:54:28] say
[1:54:30] here. It says um therefore since the law
[1:54:33] the ten commandments was given in this
[1:54:35] month and and also let me let me mention
[1:54:37] a couple other things. Now, I I was
[1:54:40] blessed by this when they said April
[1:54:42] that that Israel left Egypt in April. Do
[1:54:45] you know how many things happen in the
[1:54:46] month of April?
[1:54:48] Easter typically happens in April.
[1:54:52] Do you know what we're celebrating at
[1:54:54] Easter? We're celebrating the death and
[1:54:57] the resurrection of our savior. We say
[1:55:00] he died probably in April
[1:55:04] since he was the lamb of God. All right.
[1:55:06] and lambs are born in the springtime.
[1:55:11] It's highly likely that our Lord and
[1:55:14] Savior was born in April. That's right.
[1:55:18] We had a prophet come to the seventh
[1:55:21] church age.
[1:55:23] He was born in April. The children of
[1:55:27] Israel were going across into the
[1:55:29] promised land. Amen. They had to cross
[1:55:32] the Jordan. And the Jordans were very
[1:55:35] full during the month of April.
[1:55:39] There's a lot that happens in April.
[1:55:42] Amen. Good God
[1:55:44] almighty. Here it says um uh uh uh
[1:55:49] therefore since the law of the ten
[1:55:50] commandments was given in this month,
[1:55:52] the rabbis felt confident enough to
[1:55:54] associate this holiday with the giving
[1:55:56] of the law. And he says, "As Ruth
[1:55:58] Spectre Lel says, the Jewish people call
[1:56:00] this day shava shiovat uh or weeks
[1:56:03] because it comes seven weeks after
[1:56:06] Passover. They are reminded on that day
[1:56:08] of the ten commandments that were given
[1:56:10] to Moses 50 days after the Passover lamb
[1:56:14] was slain for their redemption from
[1:56:16] Egypt. This feast is also known known by
[1:56:19] the name the day of giving the law. All
[1:56:22] right? And we're we're talking about um
[1:56:24] this feast of weeks or feast of
[1:56:27] Pentecost. Now the the gentleman goes on
[1:56:30] to say this
[1:56:32] um it says Exodus gives us some unique
[1:56:35] details about that day. So this day that
[1:56:38] Moses was getting the
[1:56:41] law and you all remember it's uh God
[1:56:44] himself writing on the tablets with his
[1:56:47] own finger right man. God can write.
[1:56:51] God can
[1:56:52] read. God can do whatever we need him to
[1:56:55] do. Right? And and they were they were
[1:56:57] saying here at the same time that God
[1:56:59] was given this law, the children of
[1:57:02] Israel were down in in in the camp
[1:57:04] breaking the
[1:57:07] law. Can you imagine that? While God
[1:57:10] giving this supernatural experience to
[1:57:14] Moses, the children of Israel are down
[1:57:16] in the camp with a golden calf.
[1:57:21] naked before God.
[1:57:24] Dancing be before a golden calf, upset
[1:57:27] that Mo, we don't know what happened to
[1:57:28] this guy Moses complaining and
[1:57:30] everything. What in the how could they
[1:57:32] get like that? Well, it's the same thing
[1:57:34] with us. People leave right here from
[1:57:36] church with all this good preaching and
[1:57:39] still go out and talk doubt. Oh yeah.
[1:57:43] Didn't we just read that God going to
[1:57:44] take that away from you? Well, I know
[1:57:47] God going to take it from him, but he
[1:57:48] ain't done it yet.
[1:57:52] Amen. Maybe he waiting for you to get
[1:57:54] the right attitude.
[1:57:55] Amen. With the attitude you got, you
[1:57:58] won't even praise him right now.
[1:58:01] Amen. Somebody. But but I I want you to
[1:58:04] know that here here in this book, they
[1:58:06] made a they made a statement. It says uh
[1:58:09] uh while Moses was up in the mountain
[1:58:11] receiving the law, Aaron was down there
[1:58:12] making a golden calf for the people. And
[1:58:14] when he had finished it, they had a
[1:58:16] party worshiping this golden calf as the
[1:58:19] God who delivered them from Egypt. And
[1:58:20] what happened when Moses came down? Now,
[1:58:22] just to shorten uh this, what happened
[1:58:24] when Moses came down? He threw them
[1:58:26] tablets down. A man was angry.
[1:58:31] He was so angry. And you see, who on the
[1:58:33] Lord's side, let him come to me. And um
[1:58:35] and and so he threw the tablets down.
[1:58:38] And uh I believe the scripture said
[1:58:41] about 3,000 men died in Israel that day
[1:58:45] and their own brothers was killing them
[1:58:47] because they were they were worshiping
[1:58:48] that golden calf. They wanted to get rid
[1:58:50] of that out out of out of Egypt. I mean
[1:58:52] I mean out of Israel. They couldn't have
[1:58:53] that. No that type of sin. No no no no
[1:58:54] no. Not worshiping no golden calves.
[1:58:56] Don't don't worship no other god but our
[1:58:59] God. Hallelujah. And and so he said
[1:59:03] 3,000 people died. Say what a sad day.
[1:59:05] 3,000 Israelites died. They broke the
[1:59:07] law before it was ever given. But does
[1:59:09] that specific number 3000 ring a bell
[1:59:11] for you? Now, this is what they saying.
[1:59:13] It says, "Let's look at the new covenant
[1:59:15] scriptures to see what happened on the
[1:59:17] 50th day after first fruits in Jerusalem
[1:59:20] during the first century." Well, they
[1:59:22] took us to Acts chapter 2. I don't have
[1:59:27] time to read it all. I'm out of time,
[1:59:28] but I'm giving you where you can go find
[1:59:30] it. And you know what happened when the
[1:59:32] when when
[1:59:34] when the Jubilee Because brother
[1:59:36] Brandham called it a Pentecostal
[1:59:38] jubilee.
[1:59:39] And Jesus was actually letting them know
[1:59:42] this was coming. When he when he said he
[1:59:45] said, "The spirit of the Lord's upon me
[1:59:46] and has anointed me to preach the
[1:59:47] acceptable year of the Lord." He was
[1:59:49] letting them know a jubilee is coming.
[1:59:51] Freeing them from churchity, freeing
[1:59:54] them from organization, freeing them
[1:59:56] from the wrong thoughts about what the
[1:59:58] kingdom of God was, freeing them from
[2:00:00] all of these things. Hallelujah. We've
[2:00:03] been freed from the same stuff. We were
[2:00:05] free from denominational thinking. Amen.
[2:00:08] We were free from what the bishop had to
[2:00:09] say. We were free from a lot of Amen.
[2:00:12] We're free from people that were doing
[2:00:13] things against the scripture. We could
[2:00:16] go. We heard a Jubilee trumpet sound. We
[2:00:18] went back to the word for ourself. Amen.
[2:00:21] And we do things that are based on the
[2:00:23] word of God. Amen.
[2:00:26] He
[2:00:27] says Holy Spirit poured out in such a
[2:00:30] way on the day of Pentecost. The very
[2:00:31] first time that the Holy Ghost fell. And
[2:00:33] when it fell, uh, man, people were were
[2:00:37] were were hearing, uh, hearing the 120
[2:00:41] speak in their own native languages. The
[2:00:43] tongues were going forth. You talking
[2:00:45] about a Jubilee speaking in tongues
[2:00:47] going, they heard in their own native
[2:00:48] languages. And and uh, and people just
[2:00:50] begin to ask qu what what must I do to
[2:00:52] be saved? You know what? What what do
[2:00:54] they have to do? And Peter, stand up
[2:00:55] said, repent every one of you. Be
[2:00:57] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:00:59] Christ. Right? It says, and you shall
[2:01:01] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. the
[2:01:02] promises unto you, to your children,
[2:01:04] those that are far off, as many as the
[2:01:06] Lord our God shall call. I like that
[2:01:08] scripture
[2:01:09] because over in in in in um was that
[2:01:13] Deuteronomy where we read from just now?
[2:01:15] Yeah. That they was they was your
[2:01:18] children were blessed because you were
[2:01:20] following. Yes, sir. Do you realize that
[2:01:22] if I'm baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:01:25] Jesus Christ? Amen. All I got to do is
[2:01:28] just look at my child. Amen. That's
[2:01:30] right.
[2:01:32] Amen. Amen. I ain't going to fuss with
[2:01:34] him. I ain't going to argue with him
[2:01:36] because it told me that if I was
[2:01:39] baptized. Then it said the promise is
[2:01:41] unto me. Ain't got nothing to do with
[2:01:45] you. It's my promise. And all I'm all
[2:01:48] I'm saying, did you come from my
[2:01:51] [Applause]
[2:01:54] womb? Amen.
[2:01:57] [Applause]
[2:01:59] You can just you can
[2:02:02] you can drop the mic and just tell did
[2:02:05] they come from me, Satan? Did they come?
[2:02:07] You tell me what is their their
[2:02:09] their bi biological line or whatever.
[2:02:14] You you tell me how it flow.
[2:02:19] And then when you really think about it,
[2:02:20] think about all you went through to give
[2:02:22] birth to that child.
[2:02:24] how the devil fought you during your
[2:02:26] pregnancy.
[2:02:28] Huh? He fought you during your pregnancy
[2:02:30] and now he's fighting you after the
[2:02:32] child and come forward. But God gave me
[2:02:35] a promise. And since God gave me a
[2:02:38] promise, I ain't even got to do no
[2:02:40] fighting.
[2:02:44] [Applause]
[2:02:48] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. When when the
[2:02:53] day of Pentecostal
[2:02:55] happened and God poured out God poured
[2:02:58] out in a supernatural way and and that
[2:03:01] was not just for the day of Pentecost.
[2:03:03] That is something that's supposed to be
[2:03:04] going from from that time to this time.
[2:03:07] Amen. We're supposed to be expecting the
[2:03:09] same experience of Pentecost and the
[2:03:11] same life of Pentecost. Amen. And that's
[2:03:14] why brother Rand say Pentecost is not a
[2:03:16] denomination. Pentecost is an
[2:03:18] experience.
[2:03:20] That's it. Oh my my my my. Pentecost was
[2:03:23] a release. Pentecost was a jubilee.
[2:03:27] Brother. Glory to God.
[2:03:30] Amen. And there are promises that come
[2:03:32] at the time of the jubilee.
[2:03:35] One of those promises that come is you
[2:03:37] supposed to receive your children.
[2:03:42] Hallelujah.
[2:03:43] Amen. Now remember, Lord. Amen.
[2:03:48] If Yeah. You caught the devil
[2:03:52] stealing your child
[2:03:56] double.
[2:03:59] Give it back. I I'm I'm taking double.
[2:04:02] These are my promises.
[2:04:04] All right. Amen. Amen. But on the day of
[2:04:07] Pentecost, after all that happened,
[2:04:09] Amen. the Bible actually tells us that
[2:04:12] about 3,000 souls Mhm. got saved.
[2:04:20] So when Moses got the
[2:04:23] law and no, I'm sorry. So 50 days after
[2:04:26] they come out of Egypt, Moses got the
[2:04:30] law. Now it seemed like that law would
[2:04:32] be a jubilee. And it is. It's it's to
[2:04:34] help you live. Right. Right. Right. The
[2:04:36] problem is they just didn't have nothing
[2:04:37] in them to to keep them. That's right.
[2:04:39] That's why they would bring their
[2:04:40] sacrifice and they'd offer it to God and
[2:04:43] then they would it would it would it
[2:04:45] would it would cleanse them for, you
[2:04:46] know, for that day or whatever, but soon
[2:04:48] as they gave the sacrifice right back
[2:04:50] out to sinning the same old way that
[2:04:52] they just you just offered that and they
[2:04:55] would only do it once a year. So the
[2:04:56] rest of the year they were sinning like
[2:04:57] crazy. But see, God didn't want a
[2:05:00] relationship like that with people. God
[2:05:02] wanted to set you free once and for all
[2:05:05] and you never go back to that lifestyle
[2:05:07] again. Exactly. And the only time you
[2:05:10] can go free for from a lifestyle like
[2:05:12] that is when you hear a jubilee trumpet.
[2:05:15] Amen. Amen. If you walking away from an
[2:05:18] ungodly relationship, you don't owe that
[2:05:20] person no explanation.
[2:05:22] Amen. You just left me. Yeah. It's it's
[2:05:25] a jubilee. In the jubilee, you don't
[2:05:28] have to tell the boss. Let me let me put
[2:05:30] it this way. You don't give the boss no
[2:05:32] resignation letter at a jubilee. No. No.
[2:05:36] Amen.
[2:05:38] I'm giving you my two week notice. No.
[2:05:42] No. You There is no notice at all. I'm
[2:05:44] going tell you heard the same sound that
[2:05:46] I heard. You heard it. When that when
[2:05:49] that priest began to blow that trumpet,
[2:05:51] you know what that means?
[2:05:53] I don't care what I'm in the middle of
[2:05:55] doing. Amen. I had a I had a friend of
[2:05:59] mine tell me one time he says uh he come
[2:06:01] home from the military and uh and he was
[2:06:04] trying to get some work and he got hired
[2:06:05] by a lawn care company and uh he say uh
[2:06:08] he say he say he um he was there working
[2:06:11] and um and they had to get a tree moved
[2:06:13] and planted and put somewhere and just
[2:06:16] him and this guy. So the guy um the boss
[2:06:19] you know yelled out to him say hey man
[2:06:21] we got to get that tree over there say
[2:06:22] okay all right so he went to try to move
[2:06:23] that tree he really couldn't do it the
[2:06:25] boss yelled at him say come on man put
[2:06:27] your back into
[2:06:29] it say when he heard it he says uh
[2:06:34] there's two of us out here
[2:06:37] and u one is yelling put your back into
[2:06:41] it right and the other is actually
[2:06:44] putting his back into it you say Which
[2:06:47] one you think getting paid the most?
[2:06:49] Right.
[2:06:52] He say the one that's yelling put your
[2:06:54] back into it is the one that's getting
[2:06:55] paid the most. I don't want to be the
[2:06:57] guy that's putting my back into it. I'd
[2:06:59] rather be the guy yelling, put your back
[2:07:01] into it.
[2:07:03] Amen.
[2:07:06] You You The devil been telling y'all for
[2:07:08] a long time, put your back into it. No,
[2:07:11] you ain't going to tell me no more.
[2:07:12] I'mma make you put your back into it.
[2:07:15] Amen.
[2:07:17] Brother, this is Jubilee. You ain't
[2:07:20] yelling at me no more. That tree ain't
[2:07:21] going to get planted today.
[2:07:26] Not by me anyway. I'm going back to my
[2:07:29] house. I'm going back to my land. I'm
[2:07:32] going back. Praise God. That everything
[2:07:35] God had for me. Everything I lost, I'm
[2:07:38] going back to it. I heard the Jubilee
[2:07:41] trumpet.
[2:07:44] Amen.
[2:07:46] Let me They They said this. There you
[2:07:49] have it. When the law was given, 3,000
[2:07:51] people died. But when the Holy Spirit
[2:07:53] was given, 3,000 people were saved.
[2:07:56] Amen. Says, "Isn't that the case? The
[2:07:58] law brings death only because none of us
[2:08:00] can keep it. But Jesus brings life. The
[2:08:03] law law gave us good, but it was given
[2:08:06] externally. Our sin nature caused us to
[2:08:08] break his good law. But in Jesus, the
[2:08:12] spirit of God gives us
[2:08:16] new gives us a new heart so that we can
[2:08:20] live a godly life and not break his
[2:08:22] law. And that's exactly what Ezekiel
[2:08:26] prophesied. I give you a new heart. I
[2:08:28] give you a new spirit. And then in the
[2:08:30] middle of all that, I'm going to put my
[2:08:32] Holy Spirit there. And the reason you're
[2:08:35] getting the Holy Spirit is so you can
[2:08:38] you can keep his word. Amen. And the
[2:08:41] reason he gave you a new spirit is so
[2:08:44] that you can get along with the Holy
[2:08:46] Spirit when it comes.
[2:08:50] Hallelujah. Amen. Look, and Jesus said
[2:08:53] he was I mean, brother Ram said that
[2:08:54] Jesus was telling them about this great
[2:08:56] gush of Pentecost because that was a
[2:08:59] jubilee and we're still under that great
[2:09:02] gusher, that jubilee of Pentecost. May
[2:09:05] God continue to pour out his spirit.
[2:09:07] Amen. give us more love for him and
[2:09:10] desire to live for him and and to walk
[2:09:12] in his statutes.
[2:09:14] Come out here this morning. I'm
[2:09:15] listening to the saints worshiping and
[2:09:17] praising God. I'm like, "Well, praise
[2:09:19] God."
[2:09:20] It's good to hear people when they free,
[2:09:22] they sing.
[2:09:24] Amen. You know, the uh David wrote a
[2:09:28] song uh a psalm. He says, "How can we
[2:09:31] sing?" Right? Yeah. Right. When we're in
