see your grace and mercy your grace and mercy brought me through praise Lord you may have you cease we have one more special thing I just believe today in Sunday school we were talking about waiting on the Lord and just not moving ahead of him making sure that when you pray and you believe that you trust in him regardless of how much it seems like something needs to happen right now like you're at the verge of something happening and you feel like you need to move right now God's will is for us to wait and to trust in Him and to just believe in his will and believe that his timing is everything this song just talks about I've sung it many times but it's coming alive you know it talks about the three Hebrew boys about to be thrown into the fire it seemed like God needed to move right then but he waited until they were actually in the fire before he actually stepped on the scene the children of Israel you know Oh God delivered us you know and they end up at the Red Sea and they have no way to get over it no way to get around it God waited until they got right to that situation that seems hopeless before he opened up the way for them in the last verse it's just a personal story of how sometimes it seems like this situation for me is different so God's gonna have to act differently but God's never changed the way he moves he always makes sure that just in time he's there you know so regardless of what this situation looks like oh it looks bigger than last time it looks different than last time either way regardless of the situation God is able God is more than able so all he asks is that we simply believe and that we trust in him [Music] standing at the Red Sea with no hope of victory they didn't know what to do hoping that somehow someway their God would come and make a way they put their trust to you could their God get them off the shore they hadn't seen this before but they just [Music] then he just [Music] standing before the king with all the others worshiping they knew what they had to do hoping that somehow someway their God will come and save the day they put their trust in could their God save them from the sword they hadn't seen this before but they just [Music] they just [Music] so how could I disbelieve after all you've done for me how can I give up on you knowing you're able to see what to do [Music] can my god rescue me once more I haven't seen this before but I just really [Music] I just [Music] so I do after all you time for me and how can I give up on knowing you were able to see me [Music] what a problem is not seeing I believe not knowing I receive along you have for me walking in my destiny knowing you have plans for me I know you'll make away you lord I never see this boy [Music] I just [Music] yes my just [Music] yes [Music] can you help me say yes [Music] I just [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] yes no matter what [Music] I just yes I just believe I'm free I believe oh I just believe I'm healed I believe I just believe your word I believe I just believe in promises say they can say I just believe you have to say it before you see it you have to say it before you see it you have to say it before is it you have to say you have to say you have to speak [Music] I just believe so how can I do this after all yours only for me and how can I give up on you you are able to see me no matter what the problem is we just we just we just we we just oh we believe your word we just [Music] [Applause] we were born to believe that's what believers do who believe God hallelujah oh praise Allah praise alone praise Lord amen he said it believed him and man believed who the promise comes to pass and then he's going to fulfill his word he can't fail only believe

Brown who had a little situation here earlier this week that you were just strengthened him and touched him in his body Lord I heard on yesterday many distinctive Zimbabwe are going through in the country Lord with the leadership and so much just happening just pray to to protective people that you would keep the people during this tremendous time that they're facing Lord we also heard of some believers there in Russia there's something getting ready to happen tomorrow a decision that will be made where they'll be looking to ban the message of the hour from coming into the land of Russia they call it here is see and God we just pray that you would just move on the scene if if the law passes this that the believers will have to go on hiding and God we pray that you just make a way for the people that you would open up doors that they can't see touch those that are leadership of God's to make a way for your word Lord Jesus a man that stay published there in that country Lord we pray that you moving far other states that are traveling to and fro God during this busy holiday season we pray your traveling mercies upon each one that to a distress in your people that you would keep them and to able to come back together again repair our hearts now Lord to go into the word of the Lord on today we pray that to administer to our hearts and to our needs it's in Jesus Christ's name that we ask it amen and amen let's give the Lord a hand to praise a man thank you God bless you God bless you preciate our musicians a band song leading and praise the lord of the specials that went forth it's everything that's been done in the name of Jesus amen we certainly appreciate it and it's so good just to be back in the house of God a man you know David made a statement he said I was glad when they said unto me let us go to the house of the Lord come in the church ought to be a joyous occasion hey man it ought to always be joyous to get to the house of God and a man if if somehow the devil amen you know if something happens and he takes some of your happiness right he can't take your joy right he is sometimes he messes with your happiness you know sometimes something has to happen for you to get happy hey man but but joy is just always there no matter what your what's your face it no matter what you're going through you still got joy there's a song that says I still got joy after all not some not not some not some but after all the things that I've been through I still got joy still got joy go over to God amen so we just we just thank the Lord for all things I'm a read one scripture a man and I will let you have your seats Amen thank y'all for standing in and everything that will let you be seated praise Lord up just John four and I want to read a man of Scripture that all of us amen are very familiar with it says God is a spirit and they that worship Him must and then there's no other way around it if you're gonna worship Him you but you must worship Him in spirit and in truth the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated the Lord I want to just use for our topic today ritual rather than relationship in man ritual rather than relationship a man I draw my my thought a man from just observing a little something on my journey a man a few weeks ago as I was traveling to Israel something that I noticed I was and I had a I had a nice layover and I went from Miami to Detroit had an eight hour layover in Detroit from Detroit to New York and had a about an hour hour and a half way over there and then my flight left New York about 11 o'clock that night I started out eight o'clock that morning in Miami and and when I got to New York we got on playing this loaded with people and you know but when you get to New York sometimes you see things that you don't typically see you know too much around you know here but but when we got to New York we just a lot of people you know getting on the plane and I saw all the the the Jewish men and they were they were dressed in their garb and they had their their hats on and you know the ones that you know kind of where the long beers and things like that and I saw them I believe they're called of Orthodox I'm not really sure but they they hold true to some things and you know and and I come to find that there's divisions even amongst them you know there there's some of them where their hair a certain way or they might wear a certain kind of cap the Hat might look a little different one might be more round or one might be square and and they're actually from two different groups a man and and and the reason that they might wear one way or a square hat and one wear a hat the reason that separates them is simply because the rabbi said so a man and and people do things because the rabbi said so oftentimes people do things because the bishop said so a man or they do it because the pastor said so but it's not based on what the bishop says or what the rabbi says or what the pastor says but it's based on what God says and then we do things because God said so amen but you know as I as I looked at these men you know with a very long flight but you know I noticed that they're all dressed up in mandate you know they you know you know who they are based on how they dress a man and I think that's good right because Christians should be known for who they are by the way that they dress a man we ought to be known in the streets that we Christians praise the Lord we it shouldn't be a compromise when we leave Church hallelujah a man it should be a compromise because we have some other presents some where a man we Christians all the time a man just because of some event we say we don't stop becoming Christians actually at the event it's that greatest time to shine as Christians that's where people need to see something different inside of us come on somebody Hey hallelujah that that I mean you know a wedding is the best time to shine as a Christian because of you know typically I mean when people come to weddings they especially presented church that come there to a situation like that but they won't come to church on Sunday morning so you got a really great opportunity and then to let your light shine before men when you're doing something like that funeral is a great time to shine right there opportunity God give us what we can really shine it's not a time to shrink back but it's a time to step up right and be who God has called you to be out I'm not just gonna be a Christian on Sunday mornings praise the Lord somebody right so you know I was looking at these men and I was admiring them I was admiring them I said man look at these guys where they dressed and everybody know who they are right you ain't gotta ask no questions you know exactly where they come from where they're going you know you know everything about them just by the way that they dress I say boy that's something and you know and adds up you know I'm there on the on the plane and you know getting a little sleeping and I think it must have been about a 10 or 12 hour type of trip but you had a certain time amen on the plane right these fellows got up man and see that the thing of it is they don't crush their hat don't put your stuff on their hat they put that hat in a certain place and the dunk not just up there wait to everybody get that stuff but then they kind of put their hats up there at the top don't mess up my hat right you know they were very meticulous about what they was doing right so so at a certain time I saw I mean I woke up and you know and I was sleeping I woke up and I see these fellows they they like that now they got they pressure on zone they got their hats on because when these men we pray they could not pray with their heads uncovered they had to make sure that they were covered right so they put these hats on they begin the prayin and write down the plane they got a book that they read and they just you know when they praying Oh God I'm gonna just talk a little bit but but when these brothers praying you know they praying right Amen they saying some words they uttering some things you know I know sometimes we you know as believers we don't want to pray out loud I know I know I know we a little shy to pray out loud you know you know when you find people praying out loud when they really going through you ain't got you ain't got you got no problem opening your mouth when you really go through right I mean when when you ain't got no troubles what you say you know you ain't going through nothing but you let somebody call you some bad news by one of the children I won't agree to do something like that lord help me help my family God ain't got no problem print out loud then why is it while you got to wait to you in desperation to call on God these fellas weren't waiting for desperation the plane was going down plane was going down it was it was a part I hate I'm happy to put it this way but it's a part of their ritual it was part of a ritual they get up at a certain time they don't care who looking they don't care who's around they don't care who hear them they don't care who see them they don't care anything about that it was time for them fellas to pray hallelujah amen when I would I what I liked about it is that you know they weren't embarrassed of who they were but I think sometimes as Christians we become embarrassed we don't need to be embarrassed God has done way too much for me to be quiet a man what he did was in public why can't I do something in public I can at least live right in public come on somebody but I watched him you don't let nothing fellows begin you know and every night I'm talking about they pray you know they praying you know Oh God cuz sometimes we don't know whether you praying or not hello somebody really stopped to pray fifoota no mom I don't want nobody to see it some people if you get into a restaurant they hold hands you know what they're doing all right if suddenly just kind of bow their head right but it means pray you know they're not no looking straight ahead well when did you pray when I was looking straight ahead I know no stop and pray and thank God stop and stop and pray don't be ashamed to pray Oh glory even you young people in school you ain't got to be ashamed to pray with your lunch you ought to thank God for that lunch that you just was given right but but don't be ashamed to pray I watched these men I was I was so impressed by you know but I'm not just maybe not be not worried about who's on the outside looking they knew who they were they knew who they were so now we don't you know it's time to pray about four or five and just get up and stand in the island and when they pray they they rock you know they're getting into it you know they just I'm not talk about sit down quiet no no they just start rocking start reading they just print I mean for about an hour's so just going just I said Lord look at this I was I was very impressed with what I was seeing you know in these men I was very impressed I had the opportunity a man to go to the Western Wall and the Western Wall is a place there and what I noticed as I was traveling around a man just the country of Israel these men that I saw in the plane I really didn't see them too many other places in Israel but when I got to Jerusalem I saw them again because they was going to Jerusalem these men were headed up to Jerusalem and and they they go there for a reason you know and and many out when I got Jerusalem so so many of these people that that dress that way and look that way just the ladies that dress that way you know it's just it was just I'm like wow you know there's something about it but you know I got to the Western Wall and and they had a little sign up at the west wall say they say the glory the Lord never departs from this place and I say wow you know what what what what a statement to make and I speaking of thing why can't we have something like that here at spirit and truth Tabernacle where people know the glory of the Lord never departs from this place i'ma tell you what went when you when you when you get to you know when you get to the place where a man the glory of God is always here you start approaching church difference when you know God gonna meet you right then you start approaching church different it just Oh hallelujah Amen I'm gonna tell you I've stopped some of y'all need to do something different if you want to see something different we we just can I put it this way we ritualistic some are sit in the same place every service we've done I mean it's my my comfort zone maybe need to get out your comfort zone sometime some of y'all need to sit next to sister Brown right I mean I mean it cuz she has a way of creating an atmosphere well you know you need comes from God from from God get next to somebody that can get in touch with God now let me have let me also taste some don't drains just the brown you need to become a person that can create an atmosphere for others to be able to get something from God I told you don't come to church with your your mouse briefs but come to church with your loud the allow priests see we you know I watch these men you know and and a lot of the people there in Jerusalem and say and they come to the Western Wall and when you go down there to the Western Wall they have a area people can pray but they separate the brothers and sisters the men and women and as a man I don't care whether you hello whether you Israeli in there don't you approach this wall without your hair coming I don't care what country you come from they got they got they got stipulations somebody might escort you away from the place right but but you're gonna respect how we do things you you gonna have to respect how we do things you just can't come here and do it your way we got all done right and you got the respect to order you just you just can't come in here and do it like that come on somebody right so sorry I watch out I mean yeah I don't care what country they were coming from they had to put on something and even had a sign up to tell the ladies this is a holy place so you don't mind watch the way you dress and we saying the same thing this this is a holy place watch the way you dress see I'm trying to get a mentor spot we got to understand we've not come to church under rituals it's not a ritual it's not just something we commonly do this has got to go beyond the ritual it has become a relationship see every time I open up my Bible I'm getting closer to him every time I come to church I'm getting closer to him right I mean it's relationship not just a ritual but you know as I went down there towards the wall and and they said the glory to Lord never depart say the present Lord is always here and I walked I said well if the president waters always here I want to get here next to the president Lord and you start walking and you trying to find yourself a little spot just to get in because people got the wall covered I think that's good wouldn't it be such a blessing that every seat was filled with people praying that you got to look for a spot to get into jest so that you can get some time in prayer right I mean you know I mean by here you know you got to try to find a spot and then and and the way that they get it you got some guys sitting on a bench right there they don't plan on leaving see yeah we coming we got we got set you got an alarm clock for your plan as to win your fare don't stop Lord I ain't got but a few minutes you know you talking to you you ain't got but a few minutes as we were there I just do not started I walk night I went down to one little area see I can't get in there see I'm going over here I can't get in there and you you know what you don't want to stand back man I'm at the western wall and you and we told us take a request and put it inside the wall and pray over it and just stick it in the crevice of the wall so I carried the burdens of the church and stuck it in the crevice of the wall and I now reach way up so people can get up there and I reached I stood on my tippy-toes not stuck it and I just lifted my hands and I just began to just praying and man the presence of God that was in that place for something so special and I said lord I see why they say the presence of God never leave and and and it was it was it was it was it was it was a very unique you know thing and Here I am the same guys that I see on the plane that's praying now I'm there in the midst of some of these guys and I'm praying at this western wall it's a man that says this is beautiful but a title's ritual rather than relationship because I saw something else with these these men that that that that that that were praying on the plane I saw that they dressed apart they look the part they they they created atmospheres you know they did all these things but but but but when we were getting off the plane and and and and you know how on the plane before you get on you have to check in your duty-free if you have some if you already travel I'll tell you what duty-free year's duty-free typically typically is liquor right it's liquor or it might be cigarettes or something like that that you carry in you know and and so I'm looking at these men and what they hatch so with all of this and I'm seeing carrying a carton cigarettes and carrying liquor now I don't know if they're gonna use it if they don't sell it well what are they doing whatever they're doing it shows a very bad testimony and this is why I begin to see doubt now now see what God is calling for is relationship not ritual and ritual it just becomes routine but nothing ever really happens in your heart if you're gonna come to prayer meeting and not allow God to do something inside your heart then you're wasting your time if you're gonna come to church and not allow God to do something inside your heart you are wasting your time if you say I believe the message but the message and change your heart you are wasting your time God God don't want just reach the wall it's not what he's looking for so yeah you know I watched this one brother you know and I you know when you get there for the first time it's kind of hard to come out that presence when I watch this one brother that was with us and man he got there holding that wall and he was just praying and we ought to stop him but he's still praying and he stopped for a little bit and he go back to praying again and he stopping and go back to praying again and you know and finally one the brother say we gotta go you're gonna have to go get him and I have to walk back down cover that head walk back down on inside of there find the brothers down there on the west wall I just have to touch them a little bit cuz see you don't want to be interrupted when you're praying right and I just don't just touch a little bit but that but but but what I went out without what I gather from that is that I wish that we can get so locked in with God that somebody have to come touch you alright I might have to come get you out of here all right I mean cuz you don't got so locked in with God that I ain't going no you you find yourself like John Ryan you gonna file a found a pile of dead bones if you don't do something funny see I mean when we got true relationship that's the way we approach God it's not it's not just ritual oh my god it's Oh God you know I you know this this form of worship that we got for some of us it's Sunday morning only but some of us it's Sunday morning only worship that that's all we got for God sund'ys I took suddenly off Lord so I could come worship you like you did God a fever and I got I got I got Sunday morning I do got more time but I'm only gonna do this on Sunday morning and what up what I'm here to tell you this morning even though I was impressed by all their men was talking those first time I saw it I don't think God wants can I say some oh all right I mean sometimes I might be impressed by the church being full on Sunday but maybe God not you know why and one of the reasons why God not impressed it's our approach it's the way we come in the church it's the way we're doing things I mean this thing has become so practice you know exactly what time to leave home right you know what what if you go get caught by this lighter that like you got this thing time okay and I want to get there just about now and Oh like you don't did something right I mean look we have we have to break rich the wall you're coming to church is not because mom and them used to do this then of them did this something that we don't done all our life we just go to church that's what we do also it's got to go beyond dance it's got to really become Laura I just I just love being in your presence you see they're not so oftentimes we're not coming in to add nothing to the service we're just coming to take everything from it that's why we don't get here early to pre you know the Prophet talked about being in the church 30 minutes early to pray yeah it is for you to create an atmosphere and then you're gonna say in brother solomon then say your favorite song you got man you ain't got none because if you had one you would've been singing it all week long and you too coming here to help create an atmosphere right here amen you come on our approach has got to be different if you know you're going to church on Sunday morning you can't be out all types of night on Saturday night your your mind is not being prepared your spirit is not getting ready for what's getting ready to happen yeah I mean so you have to change your approach you got I mean you really you really gotta look at how you how you coming into the presence of the Lord and sometime the reason we don't get nothing cuz we ain't gave nothing let's look at a scripture let's look at a scripture turn with me to Luke 18 I was I was impressed but I don't think God was it was it had become ritualistic but it was rock and they looked good while I was pending at the western wall and and you know I'm looking at these fellows some gap I mean they get they got what they call phylacteries the other family of y'all Bible but they have these phylacteries that they just tie around they they are and in their tie around and then they have some things they have that they're holding in their hand it's like scriptures and things like that they hold a hand and then sometimes if I just put across their head and they just stand there they just sitting there just from the phylacteries just praying their sleeves rolled up and they just got this stuff I mean they they look spiritual but I saw one rocking like this I mean first you know first he started out you know like that then when he really got into it you saw him going he hadn't he don't you know he didn't got herself right but as they're doing that I see another one just talking to him while he's praying and he just talking and giggling and laughing and everything I say Lawrence now wait a minute this thing this thing right just to Westar law I realized it had become a ritual but but but when my brother went down there he won the ritual for him he had a relationship and he was a lock then we had to go come on brother we got to bring you out of here time to go if he could have stayed right there he would be right there right now all glory scene and I wish that our approach to God would be the Lord Oh hallelujah I wish I wish that I approach to God would be that you know Lord I'm going to church and I ain't got nothing else on my schedule today I ain't got nothing else on my schedule because you know sometimes we come in and especially last weekend brother Reggie might appreciate a couple hours but he did a wonderful job and by the way brother brother Jerry did a wonderful job too Friday night I certainly appreciate brother Jerry did an awesome job but but but brother go go for about two hours and I would be late why did you plan that on Sunday why did you do that a Sunday used to be the Lord's Day it used to be that way why are you planning the work on Sunday now I'm not talking about if you're ox falling a ditch that you can't get to get it out the ditch but I'll talk about your plan I'm talking about your plan that I have yes you did some other time you could have got that done honor God army of every week every day honor God don't make it a ritual make this about a relationship do you even even in a husband and wife relationship you know it can't just be ritualistic if it become that way then you know nobody appreciate nothing if every day he walk in you know doing it I mean you know he'd never do nothing different nothing but just well how do I know it's because it's just a ritual for you how do I know your heart is in this it you've got to do something do something just stop doing the same thing you do something not not just not just here Church when you leave church do something different brother branham say worship I read the quote on Wednesday I can't be today you say worship is not just when we come and sing songs in church he said but when you leave church and you see something out of your job doing something wrong the sense I'm gonna say something to them he said then you worshiping God encourage somebody witness to somebody you know when you get to heaven if there's somebody to witness to you had an impact of their making it brother branham's there to be a halo hanging over their head and you'll see that halo hanging realizing that you you had something to do with them get in there when I said we got we to Revelator I'm just be honest we to Revelator you know you know what I revelation is if they go they see they see they're gonna come things you know if you would just open up your mouth and let God you you maybe you can help somebody Amen right but we just to ritualistic I'm looking at them but I'm also looking at us we went with two ritualistic God don't want ritual worship if you don't worship Him you gotta worship Him in in two ways in spirit and in truth that's what God wants let's look at this it's a condition of the heart you know we've been working with this in Sunday school ah I won't read the whole thing I started with verse 1 through 8 y'all can go back and read that those y'all that do not attend Sunday school hey man I might as well just say it why not why what else you doing on Sunday morning what you doing what time you go to work open up your mouth and talk to me what time some of y'all go to work just highlight what time you go to work 11 p.m. 6:30 what time y'all go to work you don't go to work that's fine what time brother Jimmy go to work 8:30 anybody else what time people go to work in here 4 o'clock in the morning 5 o'clock in the morning ok praise the Lord and we got service cool at 9:30 you can't come but you can show get to that job four hours earlier than Sunday school you can get there and be smiling when you get there I heard people say they want to come to Center school because they want to do no homework this ritual worship that we got going on I'm just trying to point it out that y'all you know in fact things become so ritualistic that we lose the heart I'm talking about I'm talking real good right when we've been doing pinnacle pawns for years and when we first started boy everybody's going so inspired and singing and doing you'd be surprised that when I go through they have to give a song ritual it's not from the heart and when we're doing things and it's not from the heart it's not being accepted I'm gonna just be honest with you I mean we will approach it just like these these these Jews we had we get we look the part we dress right we're doing all this but man our heart is messed up I can tell because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh and I don't let that the actions that come from your outside reflects what's on the inside let's look at this man you know Luke 18 when you go back and read it there was at first the first eight verses is talked about a judge that had a really bad heart towards God but because he had a woman that just kept pestering him pestering him he's even though I own regard God you know I'm gonna just give it to her because I'm tired of what she said his heart changed because of her actions his heart changed because of her actions you know if you want to see people in your family's heart change maybe your actions need to change that right oh I know I'm talking good I know that and you know I'm telling I just you know when you when you're going you see things just start observes they Lord look at this we approach the same the same way lord have mercy it's is it really from the heart y'all just extra stuff a question there was a time that you were really happy about your salvation but I want to ask have you lost that fervor have you lost that zeal if so what do you need to do to get it back you want the favorite sermon reach or something I mean that don't work that way you got to put some time in and when you put in time and it's not like brother Troy yet when you study in the Word of God you're not studying for head knowledge its life to you his word is life right I mean and when you spend time with God that that's best Oh God I'm trying to get here I remember you know we go to church at some time and I pass it accident how many here read a book this week and stay down how many how many how many listen to the prophets tape this week all right so what we do is go put on a tape so if he acts that question the king now you see not by me approaching it that way and get nothing I ain't getting because I'm not coming to him with relationship I'm developing a ritual so I don't have to be asked that question we don't want to approach God that way we got to change what we doing look at these look at this here and Luke 8 verse 9 and it says any spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others they trusted you we trust in ourselves that's what we do we trust in ourselves and you know you don't you don't realize ain't none but grease that got you where you are and don't you ever forget that grease I mean we just oh we just think me somebody yeah and i'ma tell you this you are somebody and you're not somebody it's all as long the way that you present yourself all right he spake this parable to certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others look at this two men went up into the temple to pray see it's all about the approach look the one a Pharisee and the other a publican these two men going to the same church to pray two men going to the western wall to pray right I mean one approaching it this way one approach that we look at and say the Pharisee stood and prayed now they've both praying but look at this man's prayer the Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god I thank thee and he sounds so holy so righteous God I think thee what you're thinking of that I am NOT as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican I mean he saw me now why he going to free what he praying for I mean lord I'm glad I'm not like him he don't even know the man but look at look at him say he say I fast twice in the week looking at me telling god what did I give time of all that I possess not think someone's just so happy that we can pay times we feel like that's well Lord you blessed me with this right here but just pay sometimes patting satisfying guard no you know what you know what times does it blesses you it don't bless God do you understand that ties do not bless God times bless you a man tithe actually is what keeps the devil at your house you understand time went because he say say when you pair say I will rebuke the Devourer for your sake ties is what puts the promise around you it's not about it's not about being a blessing of God God got everything he owns at all so don't think you doing something God God blessed you with a last job you paid something great great great but they ain't all got looking for this what this man said I paid my tires I fast twice a week I paid my times with everything I possessed but look at this verse 13 saying the public and standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner this man was ready to enter into relationship it wasn't just a ritual for him it was relationship he says he said I tell you this man Jesus says this I tell you this man went down to his house justified rather rather than the other for everyone that exalted himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted Jesus was looking at the condition of this man's heart well both of them going to pray but their hearts are different the way that they're approaching God well we're coming here what is our hearts what is it like right I mean I I want to just read a couple of things here and then we'll go on as I looked at these men it really it drew attention to just my heart my kitchen condition of my heart Lord how am i approaching you is it just a ritual is it just a ritual do we just do that that's what we do on Sunday right and after we leave here we go we eat that's what we do all the time it's just a ritual it's not a real relationship I'll tell you when we when we really get into a relationship it's something that you long for it's something that that's why I said earlier when David said I was glad when they sent him to me it's something that he longed for if you're in a spot where you're not longing to get the church something wrong with you you know brother branham say we are you know we ought to be in a situation where we can't wait for the church doors to open but now we got plans on church night it's the truth we put plans on church night knowing has come well God understands he understand you need to repent he gotta hing down across for you to be talked about he understands you got to give got motive that all right let's let's go on a little further I've know y'all all right I know y'all listening any time to get quiet people listening praise God I want this to go deep because I ain't going through the motions why I sit here underneath all this word you know people can sit here and still go to hell come to church every week coming to church every week and miss heaven miss the rapture ain't worth it it ain't worth it y'all alright let me go on amen don't worry you know some of y'all I was thinking God that many of stuff mean how they just enjoyed that sermon or no fear this is a good one here too and I thank God for it Amen all right let me don't worry I got more for y'all I'm just telling y'all the start of the trip I got mo for you keep coming back I got I got some mo for you yeah hey man but we gotta get we got to get started right and then we can't even enter into it well tell me all about it well what is it gonna do for you a man I don't want y'all looking just dressing the part all of us we just dressed the part no no no we get this thing got to be real and spirit and truth worshiping in spirit and truth is not just because that's the name of this church that's not what Jesus talking about we can we can name it whatever name we want to name it but that's not what you're talking you talk about a condition of the heart glory to God see I mean the other thing about those fellas they they worship in the Spirit of God may be there but they don't have all the truth they reject in Christ as a messiah right they reject him truth so so they don't have all of that and I don't not only them that was just that was just with the the Jews on Friday I was leaving I'm preparing to leave and I was in I was walking along that western wall again there was a because they have a thing where above the on the top of the wall there's a Muslim temple up there and up there with that Muslim tipple no Jews can go in that area no Gentiles I mean it's got our Christians I should say you got to be a Muslim to be up there so so they have it where no Jews better be caught up there it might be some trouble so underneath the wall the Jews can walk underneath underground they can go they can go all up underneath there and there's a little spot that you get to underneath while you're walking along the wall and they say on the other side of that that spot there's where the holders of Holies would have been so many people there they're coming to get to that spot and they stop and they start rocking again they start praying right then that area cuz I mean yes if you had a like you know a serious condition you went to that spot and that's where you got your prayer through because they felt it was gonna get it through to God that's what that's the way people approached it when we come out from underneath that walking underneath the ground we come out and we come out on the other side and this is where the Muslims live right but you can come on down but as we were coming down the hill as of Friday City shut down we're coming down the hill and lord have mercy coming up the hill you should have saw the people um it was service started at twelve o'clock for them I was coming out at eleven thousands of people coming to church at eleven Muslims a hour before service Muslims y'all hearing me Muslims were coming to church a hour before service y'all Christians and you come ten minutes fifteen minutes thirty minutes hour after the service has started and Jesus died for your sins that's how you approach it but I'm telling people that don't even know Jesus hour before I'm I seen men on canes walking up the hill little kids in everybody knew it wasn't no complaining what I don't want to go to church everybody knew it they're supposed to be doing and they was doing it with everything they had but see even that was rich long even that was ritual but when we come to relationship church these things will they'll just become part of our of who we are and we do it out of love alright let me I was going somewhere I was gonna read something the Prophet said worship is to express yourself to him that's what worship is all about worship goes beyond our intellect our knowledge of God it's a true condition of the heart worshiping in spirit and truth goes beyond the name of our church a man it must become reality and our life now let me say something let me say this ritualistic worship will sit home and string when one is capable of rising and going to church but when it's become ritualistic we don't have no problem Oh Lord you know people just I'll just reading the service you couldn't do that in Jesus day you had to be there are you gonna miss everything but now we just so it's so common right we don't let Church become so so calming it oh yeah I'll just go back and watch the video so that type of attitude make us want to take every video down but the reason we leave without that's because there's some people that cannot come to church I'm not I'm telling that there's some condition that doesn't allow them to get here so they want to watch but others they can get there but you know they choose not to I was reading a quote for the Branham said that uh we oughta we ought to just be so grateful for the Lord Jesus that he stands at the door and he knocks oh you just keep knocking trying to come in he said you know if I came to your house and I knocked on your door and I saw you peep out the window look at me and then decide not to let me in send me on my way he said I'll tell you what the prophets say he said if it was me it'd probably be the last time I came to your house he say if you came to my house and I did you the same way that'll probably be the last time you came to my house you say but not Jesus he's standing at me keep knocking but I seen people do that I'm actually seems to go to the house knocking come to see about him trying to figure out what's going on with him I see you I see the window shade moving back and forth and everything I I know you there nitin drove our Iowa in the tree God like that but I stream and when they stream they know they know what's going on in every church can tell you what's happening on that church it's gone why you know they're not gonna have service on that day because well how you know all these things streaming you're not even here and you know everything if you're gonna be that connected why not just come on and sit on the side well we forget description for sake not to Assembly excels together as you see the Day approaching anybody leave we living in last day well we supposed to be in church more now than we ever was all right I was I was reading something here okay ritualistic worship was sitting home and stream when one is capable of rising of rising and going to church Saints know everything happening in every church but do not attend anywhere it's become a ritual it's no longer relationship there used to be a time in a person's life you couldn't keep him out of church couldn't keep him I mean just just couldn't keep him and and and and and you know it's beyond the head knowledge can we read about this woman in John 4 because you know this lady had had knowledge I was just you know I was I was trying to go a different direction the day I had him I in my heart to go a different way in and I had talking to one brother and I was telling him about you know my experience on the plane or what I saw and as I was just explained to him on the phone he like brother you gotta preach that Sunday I'm like now I got something else on three you know I got something else he's no no you got a preset on Sunday okay all right I'll see and then I left that conversation I found this this man that you know that I know he was standing out here on the corner we walked over to Publix and got some fruit together and and when I was sitting down with him and talking he was telling me that he he had this little thought in his heart about the heart of worship I say okay go ahead and work with me tell me what you got and he said I think people are getting you know their their hearts are not right and when it comes to worship they don't they don't really they're not approaching the right way and he start talking a little bit I said okay okay okay work with that and then as they start talking I begin to think about you know this woman and and and and John four and then he say like the woman in John 4 I say oh okay so that's that's a confirmation I say you know I've been thinking about this little worship thing and say I'm gonna just stay right there I'm gonna stay right there with this because when I say it's not intellect if you would look at this woman's condition if you look at the conversation that she's having with gee what I want on what I want you to understand is that this lady could go toe-to-toe with Jesus y'all in here this lady was able to quote scripture this lady was able to lay down the quotes and and say we worship here and we do this and we do it this way and y'all have been saying it this way for a long time but we do it this way because it is our Father dis I mean she just she just go and talk but toe with Jesus you got people the same way today before they can tell you the quotes they can tell you the Bible verses but you ask them to living they can't do it but they know it I mean intellect this lady had this thing down pat I just you know let's look at her a little bit let's look at her verse 4 John 4:4 and he must needs go through Samaria then cometh he to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar near to the parcel ground that Jacob gave to son Joseph now Jacob's Well was there Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey set us on the well it was about the 6:00 hour there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her give me to drink those disciples were going away into the city to buy meat then said the woman of Samaria to him how is it that thou being a Jew ask a drink of me when am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living water and and the woman said unto him Sir thou has nothing to draw she just you can just kind of maybe he kind of getting underneath her her skin now to talk about drawing something and the other thing about her she doesn't her doll to pick up knives she didn't hurt her mom she got a certain attitude because she'd been a cheater I had a rough life all right I mean she don't her dance I hit go another pick-up line if I knew who I was talking to I be asking for some that shrink and she can look down sir that has nothing to draw and even gotten in a draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water art thou greater than our Father Jacob so see this she getting into some worship now she know he's she know he's he's Jewish right it actually I can't call Jesus Jewish because he won of Jewish blood he was the blood of God but she knows that he's of the Jews right so he said aren't that great and our Father Jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle she's going all the way back you know Jacobs day we get we got this well from Jacob so since jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again I said but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst oh my god said by the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life and it goes on to say the woman saith unto him Sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw she goes on jesus said in her and see this before she can get the water he had to deal with something oh I like I like I like this I just I like you know when when he's dealing with the sin issue here now before we deal with this I wanted to tell you this lady from a intellectual purse and point she knew who she was intellectually but from a heart standpoint she was far from what God needed her to be and when Jesus began to deal with her Jesus he broke rock he'd get cut right to the chase no longer we gonna sit here and talk intellect right we not not talk Jewish that the way the Jewish people worship because they were in Jerusalem and where the Samaritans work it worship is in Samaria we not we're not going to talk about that we're gonna talk about you what what really God is looking for when we talk about worshiping in spirit and truth it's got to come from the heart oh my I cannot just be honest with you if you ain't gonna give God your heart it's not gonna be accepted i'ma say it again if you are not going to give God your heart it will not be accepted you know when I'm going I'm gonna go further in Scripture you know folk come to church with no sería motives you know that I mean sometimes you can get fokin Church now at some time foot will come they got they got one reason I know why I'm here in this church I don't know exactly why but God get a hold a heart and change that reason now I'm gonna tell you two things is they come with ulterior motives and the person that's inviting now is invite the with ulterior motives it ain't about the it ain't about no relationship with God it's that's hopefully I might as well see it and I'm so glad God can get in the mix of your hopefully and taste some things around but you know and God know you got ulterior motives someone's invite certain people I was witnessing really how come that's the only person we seen come to church with you I'm talking I get me on the ritual I'm telling going deep into relationship with God all right can we go further look at the lady she says the woman saith unto him Sir give me verse 15 give me this water that first not neither come hither to draw jesus said in her go call thy husband and come hither the woman answered and said I have no husband jesus said unto her thou has well said I have no husband thou has had five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband and that's and that says thou truly the one that said unto him sir I foresee that thou art a prophet again this lady was spiritual intellectual she actually she understood certain things right and and she can see this gift that was in Jesus life sir I perceive that just a little conversation and I perceive you a prophet something wrong something different about you I perceived out of profit and then she goes on to say our fathers worshiped in this mountain see I mean going toe to toe with Jesus our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh and and I like this because I saw these men on the plane going to Jerusalem because that's that's where they thought that you're going to that Western Wall that's what I thought that's not where God is looking for us to go to get a man that to get through to us what God is looking for a condition of our heart then he can get through to us listen jesus said unto her woman believe me that the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers glory to God shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him if you're gonna worship and please give me a heart don't don't be ritualistic about it don't do that don't please don't it's not being accepted I don't know what other way to put it I you know I I wish that I could just a man just tell you that oh God just loves you in and he doesn't care he he just won't know it God cares you know God was not even God in the beginning till he created something to worship that God the word God it actually means object of worship and so when God created angels they worshiped him God had Adam and Eve in the garden they worship they did all that and until sin kind of came in then they stopped going to church is that the truth the reason they didn't come to church because sin was there and you know so I mean that that's what's the question that you have to actually become even in church well you all right yeah I'm good well why you ain't in church and when we get so comfortable we go years years I'm gonna tell you something you never meant for it to go this far you never meant for it to go this far but it has and somebody got to get in your face and tell you it's far enough you thought it just gonna be one week maybe two weeks and the devil don't put you off to two or three years and that don't even involve you I got another message that I'm gonna preach it's come I'm gonna tie it's gonna be called conviction cuz we ain't got it no more we don't lost conviction it used to bother us now it don't even God understand you know God knows I mean you know you keep taking that attitude you're gonna miss the rapture you're gonna miss the rapture I'm gonna tell you and we live in a rapture conditions right now hey man Church it's just become too much of a ritual I'm trying to get into some some things here but but I got a stopped church I looked at these men I look at and I was impressed and sometimes you think other people impressed by what you're doing God not God not I mean it goes beyond just paying tithes and offering God wants your heart see Samson gave God his strength but it didn't give God his heart God wants your heart and when God got your heart there's no ulterior motives well Lord if I serve you not do this to maybe know you ain't I said you don't serve God on them let's make a deal platform he's already made the deal seal the deal when he died at Calvary now he just walked somebody to give him that God wants undivided ticked he wants your heart please don't come just dressing the part don't do that go further and whatever you do for God give everything you've got do it with all your heart whatever you do for the Lord do it with all your heart amen God is a spirit day that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth there is no other way around it brother Branham said there's a way to worship a right way and a wrong way to worship said I'm not just trying to tell you which way you to worship but I'm telling you there is a way you have to approach God and if you don't come that provided way you certainly can't find God alright let me go a little further here the just talking about this woman he met the woman at the well and even though she thought she had the correct form of worship she realized that she was lacking something and quickly turned from her wicked ways to offer worship in spirit and in truth she had head knowledge she could hold her own in a conversation with Jesus she was well taught but she could not live what she was told it is it is more to it than just looking like a Christian we have to truly have Christ in our hearts daily pleasing him is what we should desire and and the other thing is Jesus was trying to get the woman at the well to realize that worship wasn't limited to a specific place like Mount Gerizim and Samaria or in Jerusalem worship was a condition of the heart and it could only be expressed after a true encounter with Jesus Christ and the other thing I like about this the Bible says through her testimony you know others begin to believe now now I think I got that that was verse 41 is that right yeah I said and many more believed because of his own word and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy Singh but we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ the Saviour of the world now I was just thinking on that she they say not because of I sing I think the life that she was living was so shabby there were nobody no I don't care how much hit knowledge she had her life is so shabby they would not have believed brother Branham said that your life speaks so loud that we cannot hear your voice i'ma say it again your life is speaking so loud that we are not able to hear your voice and what we want to do is get your life align with your voice and the only way gonna do that you gotta have a change in the heart I'm not talking about you know it's got to happen in the heart cuz when it happened in the heart you know what ain't nobody gonna be able to keep you out of church ain't no no no no snow situation no snow snow circumstance gonna be able to keep you we got to we got to pick this thing up I'm just under I don't want to look like that I don't want to like the fellas I got dressed up got my hat got me this is I'm approaching but and all along in my heart I got something else going home all right let me uh this displace what I what I noticed the same place where the western wall is and they're doing all this you know praying in that same area was it's also where the temple is and a temple that they were telling say this is the same temple where Jesus beat people out of the temple because it became a ritual and when it became a ritual rather than men coming and offering their best sacrifice to God they began to now buy lamps they begin to buy you know offerings that they could they could give to the pre-staged they stopped raised to the own animals now they want to just buy it's become merchandise Jesus beat them folk out of that temple now imitate brother Rama say you know what that same loving Jesus sometimes you know he'll have to give you a message to kind of beat you in line that's the lovin Jesus yeah if they gave you something to get you back in line cuz we get an understand all right all right let me go on and I'll bring it to a close here those men after they after Jesus kind of beat them you know out of the temple you look even years later they still selling their not selling offerings and things of that nature but they're still selling right then Saint Mary it shows that it became a ritual so many of the people it became a ritual don't let this gospel that God's given us become ritual let it be relationship let it be relationship I was I was impressed by the brother a man that was when we got down there both him and his wife because I told you they separate the men from the women that brother got there to pray and we could not get him out of there he got locked in so he went that brother I had to touch up on the side like brother we got there we got there we got to keep going and he like man I really don't want to go and they went and got his wife and they come out there they just they just volunteers from this place because of the presence of the Lord and I thought about it I said I want to be like him when I'm going to church I wanted to be like a magnet and they all ever had two magnets that she was working with and you get it you get two magnets and maybe got one you know place somewhere but the other magnet you you you see how far you can pull away before it actually begins to draw your back right and sometimes the magnets just big enough and you start playing with them man that that Mack the strength of that little magnet will pull your body you know and you're just trying to keep it away you know you you trying to separate but but the strength of it just just it just locks in that's the way I want to be that I can't I can't separate myself from the presence of God I can't separate separate myself from the house of God I mean I want to be mad but let me tell you something in order to be magnetized you gotta have something on the inside of you to allow you to be magnetized that brother was so connected in prayer we had to go get him they were magnetized to the atmosphere we want to be magnetized to prayer service we want to be magnetized to church we want to be magnetized to the things of God they used to sing a song only what you do for Christ will last only what you do for him will be counted in the end only what you do for Christ will last and if you're gonna do it for Christ do it with all your heart because he's seeking people to worship them but they that worship Him must no rap with no way around it get all the up tear your motives out of the way and you're gonna have to do this in spirit and in truth spirit because you understand how God wants to be approached you know he's not three gods right you have the right you have the right revelation of it you know but I mean that's the truth part but also but also in spheres like my heart has got to be right which way am i approaching God is it just gonna be ritual you ain't hurt nobody but yourself but if you're gonna get real with God now's the time get real give him everything because that's what he's asking for I'm telling ya I I know God wasn't accept accepting what I was seeing and I know that uh if he went accepting that it went a little further I know you're not accepting some of the stuff that we're doing either let me read a quote here and I'm a close I stand at the door and not look at this some time ago a man was on his road to the seaside he was going over there for arrests he wanted to refresh himself because he thought he would like to hear the seagulls as they flew over another quote he was saying this man had never even been to the sea before so he heard about him he said man I want to go hear these seagulls I want to I want to hear the waves just kind of beat the shore I want to hear that I never I've read about it but I want to hear it I want to experience it myself this is what the man said he thought thought thought he would like to hear the seagulls as they flew over the water to skip down by the great white tip waves as they roared him bursting in the air and he wanted to smell the Sun where it said it would be such a rest to live by the seashore for a while I just want to rest I want to live by the seashore to see all the things the sea has to offer the blue sky as it reflects from the sky to the water how that the foam of the salt water will boil up in the great wave strike and roll and they said if I can stand and look at that and hear the scream of the goal and on this road down to the seashore he met a man coming and he was no salt and an old seller from the sea he said we're going down he said I go down to the seashore to enjoy the goodness of the sea and the old sunset I don't see nothing strange about it the waters are just waters the sky is just the sky the goal is just another bird you see he had seen seen it so much until it become common to him it wasn't thrilling to him and I'ma tell you church has become common to many of us it's no longer thrilling to us and actually what lost earth Rilke is used to add some thrill and what you used to do it add it three all but since we lost that the thrill is gone all right hey man and that's what's the matter with you people you've seen the goodness and the miracles and divine things of God moving and working until it becomes common to you you don't notice it no more and the meters I've noticed where the Lord on this discernment will speak right out in the audience just as he did when he walked in Galilee just as promised that he said he would do and people the first time they said oh did it ever oh that's that's got to be the Lord and the next time it's well become after and after a while well it's just it's just another thing it's common it's passed over you don't notice it your eyes of understanding your heart becomes close to it the thrill the blessedness of knowing the risen Lord Jesus standing our Michos send every sort of Heights for y'all anything this world could thrill it should do something to you it should shake your faith till you open up every door faith in every everything else they Lord Jesus take full possession of me now take me into your caring here come here come into my heart take my selfishness away take my misunderstandings away take my doubts away open my eyes Lord and let me see and take all of me and be my lord till the church does that we're walking and blindness Jesus is knocking at the door and we're leaving him outside don't let the devil make your relationship with Christ just common ritual let it be real if you've lost that thrill you need to go pick up Jesus with you where you found them I mean where you lost a man search back in your own life Lord I don't know I don't know why I lost it I don't know what happened but you need to search back and you need to go find Jesus where you left it's it's we're gonna get into some things I believe by the grace of God we'll get there but what use would it be to just share some of these things and it not do nothing for your heart I'm not here preaching to your head ain't no sense in me preaching to your head um I believe there's gonna be a rapture and I believe we're gonna be a part of it but I also believe that we got to get our hearts right with God we can't just keep the treating out any kind of way a man Church don't let it be ritual let it be relationship let's pray lord I know for a fact that you allowed me to see some of the things I saw because you wanted to challenge me as well as everyone else here god it's so easy as I just looked at those men and watching them here they are carrying I'm in there they're there the little Bibles and they're reading they're on the plane and they're they're worshiping and they're praying and they're doing all these things the Lord even after they did all of that then I noticed the same man were carrying packages that they shouldn't have been carrying what about us Lord come to church we we played a we played a part but in our hearts God there is wickedness we still have hatred bitterness and so much more that's there that we really cannot get beyond the ritual you want to take us deeper you want to take us further than where we are right now and God my prayer is that that each one of us would be willing to go I can only speak these things as you have shown them to me and God I know that you speak because we all have need to hear this my prayer is that it won't just go in one ear and out the other don't don't let us come I mean there's a quote that for the Rando saying that we were so busy God loves to have fellowship he wants to fellowship with us but we're so busy that he can't even get the time in and fellowship with us the way he desires don't let us be that way let us let us start freeing up our Sundays where we're not putting things in place and and plans in place where if you decided to just hold us just for a little bit that we'd be looking at our watches wondering what time was gonna get out of here god that's that's not the way you want us approaching you and if we're doing things just because that's what we do we're missing the point we don't come to prayer because that's what we do we don't we don't we don't come on Wednesday night because that's what we do a Friday night know Lord that we come because we want to draw closer to you you say if you draw nigh to me then I was drawn out of you so god I pray that we would all just do a inventory we would just just really begin to look at where we are as we're going to this Thanksgiving season help us really to look at where we are or God just to really begin to just process and if we're not what we need to be help us throw it to make things right with you that we can get where we need to be we have to realign our priorities and and all kind of things that we have we've put so much in front of you but now God let us reset keep you first we don't want this thing to be ritual you you you you don't you don't appreciate that that the scripture you know says people draw near with a mouth but their hearts are far from you we want our hearts to be close to you other times in Scripture Lord where there are many of you said that they did this and they did that and they did it all in your name but they did it with the wrong heart and because they did was wrong a heart you told them depart from me you worker of iniquity I don't even know you so it's not about how much we do it's the heart in which we're doing it in help us God help us Lord Jesus don't let us shout over this but let us really meditate and think about what's in our heart God I pray afraid that you do the work that only you could do in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen thank you Jesus can we sing of course that a song I surrender all a man will sing that and just give me those words please church I want you to just just really Amen think think on where you are it's just one of the little notes that the Lord gave me so you can be doing a lot of things for God without the right heart and doing it but you'll find at the end of the road God was not accepting it and when you Matthew 7:21 through 23 said not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have them have not we prophesied my name and in thy name have cast out that was the main done many wonderful works then I then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity and what I gained from that church is it's all about what's in our heart is not doing a whole bunch of stuff of God if our heart is not right in what we're doing it's not being accepted we really want to don't make it a ritual make it relationship a man as we just sang a few courses of this song amen I surrender all I surrender on I surrender all to him my free leading I will ever love and trust him in his presence daily I surrender Oh [Music] surrender Oh [Music] all to thee my sit Savior where I [Music] surrender oh come on sing it again all to Jesus Oh or to Jesus I surrender ugly-ass and his feet I bow Oh whirly pleasures all forsaken Oh take me Jesus take me now [Music] I surrender Oh [Music] Surinder Oh all to thee my blessed Savior yes our hallelujah wash a river all yes I surrender to you Jesus I surrender [Music] yeah to feed my is it Saviour I surrender oh come on sing it again without your heart we say aye Oh to you Jesus I surrender [Music] all to thee my a Blissey Savior I surrender oh just give the Lord a head the priest just keep playing softly please thank you Jesus a man forgot to mention just a couple of things we want to have a word of Prayer brother wisdom is shared with me man by the name of Charlie is actually in the hospital now with leave his terminal cancer and we want to remember him Charlie is the gentleman that responsible for this curtain that we have over here the signage the little scripture that we have on the wall there in the back the signs that we have on the front door of the church and everything like that brother the wisdom used to work with Charlie and and he just did a lot of these things just out of the kindness of his heart didn't charges anything and and and I know what we can do for him is certainly offer prayer on his behalf this morning brother Steven had mentioned as we just you know we was just giving God a thanks for some of the things that he's done for us this year and one of the great things is we saw God but heal cancer two times two times in our myths sister Sam and man this was healed my sister Tanya and God been good to us I've been God then God big God been real good to us a man and you no need to see he deserves our pastor she deserves our best and you know so mr. Charlie we want to we want to go a man on back on his behalf and stand in the gap for the wisdom to be going down to pray with them a little a little later today and just pray that God would just even give brother wisdom the right words a man the sharing in his prayer but we want to go believe in God we know what God is able to do in and and that has been so kind to the bride of Jesus right we just were asking God just to kind of give him a man you know just return back to him for some of the kindness that he's given also no service this week I want to wish everybody a Happy Thanksgiving holiday time and I always try to take this time to spend with my family so will be will be a way of just up in Orlando for a couple days through Thanksgiving but we'll be back on next Sunday morning a man will be having our prayer service and our Sunday School a man and also we'll also regular service on next Sunday so keep that keep that in mind but I can't think of the exact date I think it's the first Wednesday in December I think it might be December 5th I can't I don't know the exact date but we will have a guest minister here at our church a brother from from Africa he's from he's a pastor from I believe it's Nigeria and he'll be passing through he's coming through to a couple to churches series gonna be preaching that brother James church it's the sixth okay thank you he'll be preaching brother James church and also brother Bernard Church down in Miami he's preaching here on that Wednesday he'll appreciate brother James on that Thursday and then and preached in Miami on that Friday I invited for the West Coast Church to come and be a part of the service amen on that night as well so that's the 6th of December first first first Wednesday night in December we'll be having a guest minister just want to get that on everybody's calendar if you can make it and be a part of the service I think that would be real good I will say that there was a time man we had somebody preach there was a brother from England I can't thank Chico see he came on a Wednesday night he preached when he did a wonderful job and I brother Westco brought the believers over and and I was so happy to see the Saints from from the West Coast Church here but what I was sad to see is that we had less things of our own that attended than the sanction brother let's go to church it shouldn't be that way if you if you hosting a get-together shouldn't you be home huh if you hosted it shouldn't you be at the house phrase alone so I'm gonna ask everybody put that on your calendar December 6 get your schedules of range so you can be in church amen on that night and and if you and I'm sure if you get your schedules around you can get to church on December 6 then December 13th and then December 20th all right y'all got it amen every time the church does open you'll be there so god bless you amen let's have a word of Prayer over yes yes Charlie I want to pray for Charlie this was pray for him Lord Charlie is a man that has blessed us every time we walk through these church doors we see what this man is done god he did it from his heart out of his own money it was his way of just just giving to your people Lord he really didn't know us but because he knew brother wisdom God the man gave us favor Charlie needs you God Charlie is in need Lord he needs a touch we know the doctors say it terminal or we know what they've said but God we know the tree but a touch Charlie and that you're able to raise him up off that bed that he this don't have to be the end of his testimony God and we are a group of people that have experienced you here brain cancer Lord you you you you you deliver from cancer right here in our midst three times that we know my dad had being a testimony sister Sam it's just the time yeah God you have done that here and I'm it so we came down to just because we hear cancer God even sister wisdom sister was touched a man because of our prayer she had cancer she was touched and she came back here Lord to tell us thank you for the prayer so God we know what you're able to do looked upon charlie God right where he is made an angel or go in and touch him Lawrence and God may he realize this because of what he did for the Bride of Christ that favors being returned back to him even right now and I know Lord by revelation that those that give a cup of cold water to the bride God they'll be able to receive eternal life so I know you have even a greater reward than this but God while he's here on this earth we're gonna stand in the gap and we're gonna ask you the Bible said we had not because we asked not so we're gonna ask that you would touch his body and as brother wisdom but go down and sister wisdom would go down Lord just to be in his presence anoint them Lord as they pray anonymous not how much we say but it's what we say God and let it come from their hearts but let them pray God as as as a son and daughter of gods and may we see the results Lawrence we ask it father in the mighty name of Jesus Lord and as we just prepare Lord today to go our respective ways I pray Lord for every family this church God as the people be celebrating Thanksgiving and time that families get together have some time off from work and things that nature just bless Lord everything that's done and God may you be the center of the conversation that's around the table that and your presence would just be welcome God Lord we trust that she would just get all the glory and all the honor all the praise keep us until we're able to meet again father in this place and God I just pray that even if there's one today that just want to sit at your presence just for a little bit and not worry about trying to get outside and start talking God deal with their hearts and just minister to them Lord and only way that you can we never want to be in a hurry we know that you want to fellowship with us and we want to we want to we want to fellowship with you God so have your way God in our hearts in in our lives it's in Jesus thing that we pray amen amen happy Thanksgiving to you you may be seated and man the brothers will come at this time to dismiss you and if you haven't your heart where you wanted to stay man for a little time and worship feel free to do that amen he loves it loves it meant for you to worship Him god bless you [Music] you
