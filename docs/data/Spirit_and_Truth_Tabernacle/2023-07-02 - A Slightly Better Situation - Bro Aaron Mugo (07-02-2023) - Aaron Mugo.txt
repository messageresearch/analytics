this wonderful wonderful flow amen and the anointing that I've been this morning and I heard that the specials Amen Brother Joseph [Music] amen certainly uh my hearts are heavy amen and losing one of our own uh and it always is tough amen when you lose one of your own but we have come to recognize and realize that God is not a God that makes mistakes and uh um I just believe that it's God's timing is perfect I believe God wanted to speak to for the robles's family and I believe he gave them a word that they would need for this next season life his daughter text me amen and was just thanking me for you know just all the things that the church did and everything just just helping them through this time and I said well we certainly uh were honored to be able to serve for the West brother Robles the way that he served us and uh and I said I hope to see you soon you know Before you depart hopefully we'll get a chance to see and she says well in the words of my dad later [Music] yeah you got to be able to read between the lines but she said daddy didn't say goodbye to me but he said see you later amen so we'll meet again on that other Shore Hallelujah I can see my daddy having Fellowship somehow brother Mike [Music] Tillman got a hat on come on somebody [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah I see brother Reggie over there too and he's joined the conversation so many is going on before us but we longed to see him again for the roleplay is the last time I saw him he told me it won't be long it won't be long it won't be long and I actually absolutely believe that I believe we have much time left uh so I'm doing all I can for the for the Lord amen because we we we want to be ready for that great catch in a way I want to say thank you to all the church amen for all of your support for the family amen and I know you'll continue to support them since Robles will need us over these next few weeks amen I know she ultimately will be transitioning I don't know what time frame it will be but she will be transitioning back to New Jersey be there closer to daughters and I also know one of our daughters want to move to Florida so I don't know how God gonna do this amen but we're just gonna pray for them that God will just direct them during this next season of life that God will be with them amen so continue to pray for them amen um is this your sister okay God bless you she's bit me before right good to see you again hey man God bless you praise the Lord praise the Lord all right um you know a few weeks ago maybe a month or so I don't know how long it's been uh but I um I had told my son-in-law said uh you're coming so you might as well be prepared to speak since you're gonna be sitting here and I had no idea that it would fall on the same weekend that brother Robles we'd be doing his homegoing service and uh so I'm glad that the Lord already had the ram in the bush and uh and I know that you know God had this orchestrated God had it planned and uh and I just believe a man that God has a word for us on today amen I sincerely believe that so I'm not going to take any more time hey man I want my want to just turn this service over to my son-in-law brother Aaron mugel and man certainly appreciate him appreciate my daughter my man always always appreciate that amen and we we are expecting a grandchild any day now any day now and um maybe not any day now someday Let's Dance [Music] I don't know all this stuff [Music] cause your name is power your name is healing your name is [Music] shine through the shadow burn like a fire come on everybody sing it again cause your name is [Music] it is [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you amen [Music] believe that amen [Music] it's great to be here this morning um to be with you all um as you can see singing's not my gift but uh no whenever the prophet they were asking him for what to do I think it was Elijah or Elisha rather and uh you know when he told them to make the valley full of ditches before he did his prophecy he said bring me a Minstrel and uh you know I before I preach I always like to sit back there and just listen because this church is full of minstrels and God just sends them and after that after you listen to them it's like how can I not speak the word of God how can I not speak over my situation how can I not speak to these people how can I not speak the name of Jesus there's just no way I can can't do that you know um uh thank God that uh the past couple years has been crazy for me so uh I think I started preaching right before uh I met Rebecca and I didn't have a Minstrel and then a couple years ago I asked for the check for a hand of marriage and I was like okay I got a Minstrel now and uh before I preached I usually ask her to sing and I hope that's okay today um I I usually like to have her sing before I go because it helps me calm my nerves and I hope it helps the service so whatever you feel like uh singing today is anything that's on your heart she knows how to pick it it's her gift not mine so I'd like you guys can be seated watch these things actually foreign [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] God bless you all it's good to be home I wrote this song some time ago looks like October of 2018 recently Aaron asked me for a concert so he asked me to sing some songs that I wrote so uh he asked me if maybe I would sing this song sometime soon so I guess I'll give it a shot with you guys [Music] foreign [Music] Jesus you are my defense I will trust your promises in every single circumstance I will remain confident the battle it was never mine cause you've already won the fight when Satan tries to crowd my mind you come through Lord every time Jesus you are my defense so I will trust your promises in every single circumstance I will remain confident [Music] but I won't believe the devil's lies Jesus I am in your hands I will remain confident every day is an uphill kind but I won't believe the devil's lies Jesus I am in your hands so I will remain confident Jesus I am in your hands so I will remain Jesus you are my defense so I will trust your promises in every single circumstance I will remain confidence oh Jesus you are my defense so I will trust your promises in every single circumstance I will remain confident cause Jesus you are my defense thank you [Applause] thank you for that love that he is our defense um you you guys can all stand thank you I started the timer before she sang so she's taking that out of my time that's fine um so this morning I'd like to turn to uh Genesis chapter 15. and um verse 13 Genesis 15 13 so um I'm gonna get right into it I I've never had this many notes as far as I know for any sermon so I might go a little quickly in some parts I might just cut it off we'll see how the Lord leads if if I just get off the notes entirely then we'll still be in his will it's fine it's all good okay so uh verse 13. this is God speaking unto Abram before he even got his name changed to Abraham it says and he said unto Abram know of assured that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them for a hundred years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterwards shall they come out with great substance let's just pray right here Lord we are uh we don't we don't feel a need to welcome your presence here today Lord because you're already with us we can just feel you in the room we've seen how you permeated the service and taking control of everybody was a part of different things uh the musicians and the singers and more just the testimonies and the prayers Lord you've been with us this whole thing and we know that you'll be with us for the rest of it you're building up to something and we just want to see what that is Lord just uh take your take control over the service and be with me as I speak Lord please just use my lips and my tongue to say what you would have said and open all of our hearts to receive me included in Jesus name I pray amen you can be seated thank you so um in reading this scripture it's it's really short but it's actually prefacing a really a long period of time with the Israelites in the Book of Genesis going into Exodus and uh it starts with Joseph and his his departure from the land that Abraham had given them and he goes all the way to Egypt and nobody at the beginning could foretell how long the Israelites who followed him there would stay in Egypt and they didn't understand what God had for them but I I don't think that the Israelites back in that time that they realized that that they would that they were not called to live in Egypt because if you I just take history and I try to put things together and I look at how one group of people reacts and then I try to compare it to another group so if if you looked in our history and you see that a lot of people in the transit transatlantic slave trade they pulled uh Africans and they brought them over here and probably about I don't know a couple hundred years slavery goes on and they they pull these people out of their land and they put them in this place they don't recognize people but they're just torn apart and then placed here and they're given some new name that they don't even recognize it doesn't sound like the culture they're from then they're they're they're told to socialize with people they don't know just because of what they look like and then fast forward 200 years and none of these people even know what their ancestors religion was right so that's just 200. now these people are here for 400 years you got to picture that now then the life of an Israelite 400 years did they even know the god of Abraham like to be honest every if they didn't have a Bible they didn't have job they probably had job The Book of Job that's it but I don't I doubt they actually had it and were able to read because you know why would you want to teach them to read their history why would you want to do something like that so I can picture in their minds I think it's just a miracle it's even more of a miracle that Jesus learned from no sorry not Jesus Moses learned from his mother what his job was as his deliverer how God had to watch that family line and make sure they passed it from word of mouth all the way down there to make sure it got to Moses that he realizes that he's the deliverer even though he went about it the wrong way but still his mom had to teach him that God predestinated it that way so it's just a miracle to me how did they ugh can you imagine and then they get to this point and I don't think they understood that a lot of prophets before uh before um Moses and before Joseph actually actually before Joseph they probably knew Joseph at best but they probably uh didn't realize there were a lot of prophets before Joseph who had been talking to God about Egypt and God was not telling them to stay in Egypt so he realized that Joseph had brought them there yes that's great and they got out of the fam and everything but when the famine was over they didn't realize they were supposed to leave they probably didn't understand that God had already talked to Abraham right here so actually I don't know which verse is I probably messed up the slide somewhat but I want to go to Genesis 26. verse 2 um it says in the Lord and this is God talking to Isaac actually it says and the Lord appeared unto him and said go not down into Egypt dwell in the land which I shall tell you God he's saying don't go to Egypt sojourn in this land and I will be with thee and bless thee For unto thee and unto thy seed I will give all these countries and I will perform the oath that I swear unto Abraham that father so he's referring to that Prophecy from before now I want to go over to Genesis chapter 50. you realize Joseph had that Revelation that they were not supposed to stay there but this is before the 400 years of slavery so this is Genesis chapter 50 24 and Joseph said unto his Brethren I die and God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he swear unto Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob and Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones from hence he didn't even want his bones over there he realized that's not what his generation was called to do so even though the prophet might have taken you to a place he might be pointing you somewhere else they might point you to somewhere that he doesn't get to it might point you to something that he doesn't reach but he'll be pointing up ahead and you have to use his word and follow his word to get there right you with me right all right and uh actually Genesis chapter 49 this is where Jacob dies verse 28 and all these are the 12 tribes of Israel and this is it that their father spake unto them and bless them so this is Jacob talking to his sons everyone according to his Blessing he blessed them and he charged them and say it unto them I am to be gathered unto my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the hintite that cave was not in Egypt the field was not in Egypt what Abraham purchased for them to have as a burial ground was not in Egypt there was nothing in their future that was for Egypt beyond the famine okay so I realized that the Israelites they were in this uh interesting position where they were called for something more but they just sat there and I'm not saying they could have just left I'm just saying that at the beginning you got to realize Joseph had it made whenever he was first whenever he brought his family there before they multiplied and increased more than the Egyptians at the beginning before Joseph died and the pharaoh who knew not Joseph actually started to enslave them before all of that they had a chance to leave nobody was stopping them from leaving they got comfortable and then they sat there and while they were comfortable and didn't step into the vision of what they were told to do honestly they just sat there and then their rights were gradually taken away one by one one by one their ripe system you see if you want to enslave somebody you don't just do it up front to their face just like that you tell them you can't do that just one little thing it's like all right all right I'm comfortable everywhere else here you can take that one thing from me right and it's a slippery slope downhill from there so they reached this point where they are enslaved and they've forgotten who they were and they don't know the words of the prophets they don't realize what they were called to do so uh I hope you realize I'm typing this to us you know and it's down to an individual level you can look at what the prophet said you can look at whatever whatever the Branham said but you got to realize he he's passed away so I I honestly don't see him as a perfect person because if he was a perfect person he probably would have been like Enoch and Zoop out of here right so if he passed away what is he pointing me to that he was talking about so much why is it so important that I need to read what he's saying and that to me that's the Rapture that's it he didn't make it there he didn't take a Rapture yet and him without us will not be made perfect right so that means he's calling me to something I have to realize my place in the word that he spoke and actually take that place step four now I heard somebody talking about I don't know what point in the service someone was talking about a theophany in in uh stepping into that theophany I realized you know there it is a lot easier to do that than you think you realize your theophany is your perfected body your glorified body it's like the perfect image of what God has of you right so whenever he gives you his word it's to step into that theophany so I'm not doing jumping jacks here this is common sense if he's telling me to step into something I have to picture that for myself and have faith in my own heart that God will put me in that position so if he tells me in his word that he's going to heal me my theophany is not sick that means I'm not supposed to be sick if I'm not supposed to be sick I'm gonna step into that vision and it's like easy just step into what that vision is he happens with you if I have a broken heart if I have sorrow in my life that means I know my theophany is not supposed to be like that I was not born to be like that and if I was not born to be like that I'm gonna step into what he told me to be I can do that right now when I claim my healing when I claim that word in my life and how it changes me I'm already stepping into it it might be a long slow process I might not realize it right now how he's Gonna Change Me by that point but I'm already stepping into it one little step by one step at a time I don't have to stop anywhere I just have to keep taking the word at its value and realize that's for me I need to keep walking into that theophany it might look amazing at the end depending the the difference between me at the end and me at the beginning you won't even recognize me I'm gonna look so different and I can claim that right now right now why wait that's my theophany and I'm claiming that for me right now but I'm friends it's for all of us it actually brings me to my next quote brother Branham he said amen in the Intervale 1956. he says you gotta realize this is for everybody I'm not just pumped up for here for me myself I'm excited for you he says God's no respective person or God doesn't respect persons he wants all of his children to have the same amen next slide please he wouldn't a righteous father wouldn't give one a dish of ice cream without giving them all ice cream certainly he wants you to live and I'm not talking about gifts I'm talking about Grace he's not talking about preaching he's not saying all y'all need to be actually it's on the next slide it doesn't mean all of us need to sing I realize I'm not supposed to sing I don't have that gift he's talking about Grace now of course some are called Apostles and Prophets and teachers and evangelists and church offices and so forth God placed in the church these things but I'm talking about measures of Grace overcoming Grace to each one then he elects you to your office but then in but in Grace God has given us to us all freely as we have need everything that we have need of so when he's promising you different things in his word it's for everybody it's not just for oh that sister in that Churchill she's got so much Faith it's all for her she can get all of that she can I need to go to her to pray for me no I don't no I don't I don't need an intermediary that's not what that's about come on now that's me that's for me she can pray for her and that's fine I'm gonna pray for me I'll pray for her too because I love her but I'm claiming this for me this is mine so if you if you think of uh something like if you I know some a lot of you have been on YouTube and um yeah they're ads it got a lot a lot worse but at the beginning basically all you had to do was have an internet connection and you can attack you can go to YouTube and you can you can subscribe and you won't see ads or nothing and you go there you can still do that and you're gonna have ads but it's free you know if you go there and you you subscribe to a channel and you get there like let's say let's say you watch The Chosen I watched The Chosen it's a good Bible show it's great it's free on YouTube you can watch it on there so if I go there I I don't pay when I go there I'm cheap I've never I've never contributed to the chosen I probably should because it's a great show but it's it's wonderful and they say it's for everybody so if I go there and I'm like all right this is free and I'm gonna like go there and I'll expect the same quality every time I show up even though I did not pay for this I expect the same quality so whenever you go to God's word and he's saying this is for everybody and you look in there you realize the quality is there you should expect what you're asking for because he told you you're supposed to get it I don't have to bargain I have that internet connection I have the connection like I got that I got the Wi-Fi I no password needed I just go up there and I'm like hey God it's in your word why don't you hey there a lot of these have no conditions what was the Holy Ghost given for 1959 you take a person that's lived a good life but they're always defeated oh I tell you good person oh sure I love the Lord Brother Brandon always defeated they never get a prayer answered you feel that little woman with a holy ghost one time watch what takes place when she goes before the Lord before God she is not defeated she comes boldly to the fluent of God believing she has a right because she's a daughter of God by a birth take that little man so cowardly the Boss Kick him all over the place say wait a minute here now something changed see he's got the Holy Ghost it gives you power your life is full of power it gives you power in speech see this power in speech it's a two-edged sword you can it it gives you power to talk to people who are trying to take advantage of you that's that's the example of the man at work but it's also the other Edge it gives you power to talk to God you can't come boldly to the throne of God unless you've met his requirements when you meet his requirements come boldly like I I can stand here with my back straight and pray for something I can pray for my brother my sister whatever the needs are in Hebrews chapter 4 he's actually quoting uh verse 14. it says seeing them that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession we have not on high priests which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin Let Us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need so that Grace it's not just about salvation that Grace is about everything you have need of in your Earthly walk see I thought oh God's grace is just about ooh my sins are gone so much grace I didn't realize you need Grace just to stand in front of him you need Grace every day for all of those things that you keep failing at you need Grace for everything you're asking for because it's just by his grace that you receive so actually all of that is uh I have this under a category called entitlement so that was positive entitlement right now we're going to talk about negative entitlement and that means all right I meet his requirements I you know you might have the the perfect experience according to spiritual Realms and stuff you know you might okay all right Justified Sanctified baptism the Holy Ghost and then sit here that's that's negative entitlement and that's for me because I know I have the Holy Ghost but I also know I'm entitled in a bad way you know I hear I hear people talk about oh these younger Generations they're so they're so entitled ah they're asking for all this stuff not everything's supposed to be handed to you and it's like all right well if they had that attitude about God's word they'd have a lot more than you do right because God just gives freely you don't need to earn anything with God but if I could just tap into that attitude and think about that but in terms of God's word I'm not going to be denied anything anything but then if you are sitting there with a negative version of entitlement you're just going to sit there and expect God to just change you and you're not even going to do what he tells you to do you still have the Holy Ghost you're still sealed but if you're not telling doing what he tells you to he's going to force you because if he doesn't Force you you're not gonna make it so you may as well just walk into what he's telling you to do right I actually have a quote here from C.S Lewis he um drawn a blank he he wrote The Chronicles of Narnia and the screw tape letters if you like reading this group tape letters is a very nice book um but he says God is not so much offended that we want too much as by the fact that we are satisfied with so little you could stop it right there he ain't the prophet but that was good the next line though he offers us oh yeah you can he says though he offers us the highest of Adventures in our Christian Life we settle for the stale mediocrity of our lukewarm religious routines not that that right there it don't matter I'm not I'm not trying to preach off of what he said but it's hard not to that hits everybody at every level it doesn't matter if you've been baptized not baptized doesn't matter if you're Justified not justified doesn't matter if you have the Holy Ghost or not everybody is living beneath their privileges because if if I was living to my potential I wouldn't be here if you were living to your potential we'd be perfect in God so that's for me that's for everybody we just need to ask and walk into what he tells us to do and Oneness 1962 what is it you got to get with the word get yourself killed out I'm persuaded that many of us friends have received the Holy Ghost but we just receive enough holy ghost in us to make us to a place where we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything but God wants us to fill every fiber of his church he wants us he wants to fill your thinking and he wants to fill your mind he wants to fill every bit of you just make you completely totally dead to yourself or to your thinking just so surrendered in God till his words just living right through you you don't know nothing else but God's word just stay right with his word it is life amen it is life I want him to fill me with life I want to live for him to where there's nothing I do that is not according to his will am I there yet no do I want to be yes what do I have to do walk in it he said who was praying and said read your Bible and pray was it your brother Solomon was it yeah read your Bible and pray it's not that hard I know I'm using a lot of words to say this but seriously read your Bible and pray like there isn't much else and then walking what he tells you to do because if you're reading your Bible and you're praying you're gonna do what he tells you to do that's all there is to it and and that brings you to the point where you're in Hebrews 10 too uh Part B it says because that the worshipers once Purge should have had no more conscience of sins you shouldn't have to worry about whether you're sinning or not because you're stepping out of his will because you always know what his will is you always do that which pleases the father you know that actually makes me think uh that you got to realize God God's trying to push you to something no matter what state you're Christianity you're at he's pushing you to something it might be a soft push it might be a hard push depending on how you're yielding to him it can just be a soft push all the time if you just do what he tells you to do but you got to realize he's pushing from one end and there's an adversary and a lot of people don't really talk about the devil that much but he's a person and he's at the other end and he's pushing you the other way so if he's pushing you the other way you got to realize there's a struggle going on and those are those are let me pause on that right there you see God God is actually calling you to to something more and and there are some scriptures where Jesus is talking uh I think Peter has one uh Luke 6 36 and he says a statement he says be therefore merciful as your father also is merciful so you read something like that in your scripture you're like okay I'll try to be merciful I won't be mad at people I'll just give him a little Mercy I can do that and then you get to First Peter 1 16 it's like okay because it is written be holy for I am Holy can I do that 100 of the time can I do that can me I'll try but the best I'll be is a Pharisee because that's the best example ever in the Bible they were they were clean they were perfect they did everything the law told them to do by the letter and then they came up with new rules because they loved rules so much and they became traditions and it's like all right I'm so holy yeah and then you get to this one in Matthew 5 48 be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect it's like all right I'm not doing this I can't do this nobody like I I can't be perfect because I don't know what that is I don't know what perfect Aaron looks like without the word I don't know what that looks like right then Israel in the church 1953 so brother Brown's talking about he says be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect how could you ever be perfect but in the sight of Christ tonight every born-again Christian is perfect I'm just as perfect and God as Christ was you are to every other believer for it's not my Holiness it's his holiness God can't accept mine I have none but I come in Christ by faith and by Christ I in him imperfect in the sight of God so I I don't know if you've seen my title it's a slightly better situation so it's uh thank you and it's it's um it's it's basically about what you're settling for you got to realize we've all hit a point but we haven't hit the perfect point we haven't hit the holy point I a lot of us having to hit the merciful Point that's me I get mad at people all the time I have a job it happens you know and it's without him for it's not my Holiness it's his Holiness if I let him fill every fiber of my being am I not holy if I let him fill every bit of me with his Holy Ghost and let him continue to work on me am I not perfect eventually if I let him take over entirely will I not be merciful and those are just a few of the things he's asking us to do you could read the Beatitudes and it's like all right the sermon on the mountain with Jesus telling us things it's like blessed are all these people I can't even be half of those people just me I can't I can only do like one or two in and even then it won't be perfect it'll just be me yeah yeah so so why am I not there why are we not there church yeah so 1961 perfect strength by Perfect weakness it's good title there that's it we smother him out we drive him away with our from the poorest poorest of us to the richest of us from the least to the greatest we keep God out of our Lives because they're our own selves so that's why I say there's a common there's a common problem here see Satan and God have the same problem as you it's like okay you gotta realize it's you because whatever their agenda is they can't do it without you so God's having trouble pushing you one way Satan's having trouble pushing it's not God versus it's you like and if it's all on you how much more power do you have in the spiritual war how much more power you can tell Satan's not today I'm not gonna do it and what are you gonna do nothing you can't do anything he'll keep trying he'll try to make you scared but next part of that quote I've often said the greatest enemy I got is William Branham he's the one that gets in God's way he's the one that gets lazy he's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something about it and when he does that shoves God right out of the picture so you can be serving God to the best of your ability but not doing what he's telling you to do and you shove him out of the way but when I can get rid of that guy when I can get to a place where he is out of the way then God can come over and do things that William Branham knows nothing about that's when God can use you that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody when we get out of the way but as long as we got ourselves in the way then we cannot so I'm talking about God's side he's really pushing you to do something but you got to realize there's somebody in each of us who we are catering to and that's the third person so there's God there's Satan and then there's a third person which is you it's me it's me too they're three people just fighting away all right in my life you know I'm not going to say Satan's in here but God's in here and he's trying to fight Satan and I just need to pick a side I just need to pick a side that's it if you have a vote and there's only three people voting when one person votes one way and yellow and votes the other way who's the tiebreaker raise your hand it's you you're the tiebreaker vote for God yes amen make Aaron great again that's still Maga isn't it I didn't realize okay okay so in in Genesis chapter 4 verse 6 I think is where you have the first example of God referring to that guy in there in here he's talking to Cain and says and the Lord said unto Cain why are thou wrath and why is thy countenance Fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire so that's a person and thou shalt rule over him see that that desire Cain could have done the right thing and still been Justified if he had brought the sacrifice and followed the word of the Lord like Abel had see Cain had much more reason than Abel to he had much more reason than able to do the right thing and shed the blood sacrifice for his sin because he had that nature in him that was from the Devil so you're talking about that nature and and I I I'm not saying that you guys are serpent seat I'm not doing any of that I'm saying that there is a character inside each and every one of us who we have to fight so Cain had that character and sure it's it doesn't seem fair he didn't he didn't try to make his daddy somebody he couldn't choose who his daddy was but he had a nature in there and a character from somewhere that was not of God and since he didn't yield it to God and do right then lay at the door and it caught him just like that he did the wrong thing but if we go all the way to Romans chapter six for six to seven it's um it says knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin so if you die out to yourself and you're actually following God in his will you will die you'll be completely dead and God will have no other choice but to fill you with his life then you'll be really living because you don't know what it's like without that it's different also in John 8 34 still referring to the same thing Jesus is saying Jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you whosoever committed sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed you know uh also in Thessalonians I'm just talking about the man of sin just just keep noticing there's that third guy who's got to give his vote um without money or without price 1959 and how much more will it do to the old then that has rejected the new birth because only as your life has changed and you've been converted and born Anew into the kingdom of God your nature will still be of the things of the world no matter how religious you are no matter what you do unless that has been changed in you you could worship and be religious but still that will have some kind of a drawing power to you because this old man of sin and his desires is not dead in you yet but once let Christ take the throne in your heart those things don't matter it is so much greater see um there's the scripture in Thessalonians which I I believe he's referring to because he's talking about the man of sin um in second Thessalonians it says let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there coming a fallen away person that man of sin be revealed the son of perpetition so I understand if you go to the the table app and message and you type in Man of sin he's usually talking about you know the the satanic worship he's talking about the pope and all these things but this quote that I just read here he's talking about you he said you could worship and be religious he says um wait where did he say the Madison okay because this old man of sin and his desires is not dead in you yet so that could be yeah sure you can put it on some foreign power way out there I'm not I'm not fighting that man of sin personally he he doesn't affect my life on a daily basis honestly if I'm taking this word and applying it to me I'm gonna talk about the personal one for now once I deal with me I can worry about all that now you just realize there's a guy there's a there's a throne in your heart and two people are vying for attention here you're going to give one the throne just like that with no fight no I'm not gonna give it to him I'm gonna give it to the one who who loves me who told me about the throne in the first place the one who sits he's king of all Kings he can be king of this Throne too I don't mind I'm gonna give it all to him I don't mind laughs and there's this other uh quote in 1962. it kind of hurts so um hang on to your seats it says for it for in forsaking all you see we want to hold on to everything that we can and then follow Jesus but sometimes Jesus wants to us to turn loose of everything so we can get both hands on him if I just let go of everything it's it's literally Jesus Take the Wheel let him do it who has the the strength to do that who's brave enough to do that that's what he's calling for right now sometimes we think that just because we've got a hole and there's this example in in um in uh Exodus we're still talking about the children of Israel that's where we started right so uh example I was thinking about it the other day and I realized you know if you go to the Book of Exodus you go to chapter 12 where he's talking about um where God's telling them to leave uh Egypt he's telling them what to bring on their Journey so he knows the beginning and the end he knows exactly what they're going to need and he tells them all right uh do this I think the scripture's there is it there okay yeah verse 31. and he called for Moses and Aaron by night and said rise up and get you forth from among my people both you and the children of Israel and go serve the Lord as ye have said also take your flocks in your herds as you have said and be gone and bless me also he said flocks and hurts count with me that's all he said right and the Egyptians were urgent upon the people that they might send them out of the land and haste but they said we be all dead men and the people took their dough before it was leaven their kneading troughs they're being brought up is it Charles needing jobs right yeah yeah okay being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders so they got bread now where'd that come from right and the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver and jewels of gold and Raymond so I I look at that and I'm like okay he told you to bring what was it uh it's cattle right floxin hurts yes flax flux and hurts that's it he didn't say to bring bread he didn't seem to say to bring silver he didn't say to bring gold Raymond nothing right and if you look at at the end of Exodus they came they came into the promised land and they were wearing hand-me-down clothes let's be honest all those people who died in the wilderness they gave their clothes to the other people because you know and there wasn't one stitch among them that was gone like nothing was torn God took care of them and they didn't need to bring kneading troughs they didn't need to bring that God gave them Manna so he told them exactly what they needed because he knew that they would need to give a sacrifice it's like all right flocks and hurts that's it and then all these extra things like gold and silver they take it all the way to the promised land they take it on their journey and it becomes an idol to them what did they do with that they took that in Exodus chapter 32 there's no slide for it and Aaron said unto them break off the Golden Earrings which are in the ears of your wives and your sons and your daughters and bring them unto me and all the people break off the Golden Earrings which are in their ears and brought them unto Aaron and he received them at their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool after he had made it a molten calf so they literally took something God that never told them to bring brought it with them into this new life and it becomes an idol to them we do the same exact thing people we do the same exact thing you might think oh yeah I'm saved now I I and then you just couldn't let go of one thing just one thing it doesn't have to be something that's physical it could be something that's spiritual too some people have this nature and this thing inside of them that they cannot fight no matter how long and no matter how long you live and how long they try to serve God they still cannot fight this one little thing and it becomes a snare into them then it can be an idol if you just end up just sitting there and you realize I I thought I was saved I thought I had the Holy Ghost because you can be the whole have the Holy Ghost and be insane that means there's something in there that shouldn't be there right so I thought I was saved I thought I was you know everything I did everything you told me to do and I'm just sitting here and it's like ah does that mean this isn't for me that you're starting to worship that Idol over there you think that thing is greater than God so you make it an idol you put it above God and then there's your idol right there there's a sister in our church and um she had this uh she had this years ago I I don't know I think I was still dating Becca and I was already telling her about it on the phone I was like okay there's a sister and I worry about her I I was honestly worried about her she's like 12 years younger than me and um I I I've always been worried about her I don't know why I just think of myself as an older brother she probably doesn't see me that way but I I pray for her even though she didn't know about it and um she had this uh this she had overcome something I don't know around that time when I told Becca about her it I'm not sure the whole testimony because she hasn't told me personally I just understand from different sources and the testimony she gave later um she had this the one of the spirits that Legion had she was self-inflicting so you could see these giant like cuts on our arms you still can the scars of her past you know and while I was praying for it like she didn't look like she had any friends but while I was praying for her she suddenly gets friends and then she starts having experiences in church and I'm just like yes everything's great and as far as I could tell with my eyes she was fine God answered my prayer I was so happy I was telling Rebecca how she's socializing now I was just so excited for us like everything's good but uh for some reason she still kept coming to the prayer line and I didn't know what was going on and I thought oh all right well girl she's fine right but she still keeps coming and it and not every not every prayer line she just come once in a while you see her go up in the prayer line so there was a youth meeting uh probably one or two weeks ago three I don't know um and I I'm in the prayer line because I'm one of the preachers and uh people start coming up there and all of us ministers are trying to help people in the prayer line some at the altar uh some coming straight in the line some people standing at the edge it was just packed so um I was just standing behind the brother who had preached his brother Ronnie long and um for some reason I I I'm not an emotional person and I almost never cry but um for some reason in that service in that prayer line I could not stop crying and you know for someone who doesn't cry I'm just like ah I don't know what to do my face doesn't stop and I'm still trying to pray for people and uh the sister comes in the prayer line again and um as far as I know she comes and she raises her hand she gets prayed for I don't know what was what was bothering her and um I didn't understand all that clicked in my head is like okay little sister crying I don't know why I just and I'm just praying as hard as I can for her and I don't know her situation because I didn't hear what she told Brother Ronnie so afterwards she comes over to the side and she prays on the altar and starts praying in the altar so I take a step back and I kneel down on the ground and I placed my hand there and I'm praying for her and there's another Minister brother who's who was telling her in her ears like okay try to confess it because and from what I gathered she'd been coming the prayer line over and over and getting prayed for but she had never confessed that she was delivered so since she never confessed that she was delivered she kept coming back in the prayer line so the brother and and uh a Minister's Wife they were over there on the side and they're just like telling her please just confess it out loud just claim it claim it and I I'm over there just praying and I prayed as hard as I could I could barely talk because I was still crying and then she um she spends the rest of the service still praying there you know and I don't know what it was but a day or two later she texts the whole church and she claims her healing and after that you should just see how happy she is like she she was happy before but she settled now like is there's a big difference between that and now like I could say she had all the experience that she needed to in Aaron's book the book of Aaron says she's fine she looks fine I can't see your spirit I can't see her soul but she looks fine to me and she has all these testimonies but she had claimed onto something and she broadcasted that paragraph of her testimony was so long she's saying I come in the prayer line so many times and I thought this would be just like any other day that came in the prayer line but I came there and something different happened now I can tell you there we come to church a lot and we all need a lot of things some things we've been praying for for years years I've been praying for a few years I've been praying for some stuff forever but if I realize that it doesn't have to be like every other day this is Sunday right it doesn't have to be like every other Sunday if you have something you're praying for and you came here and you heard something I said that would help you just speak Jesus accept it say it out loud confess it to somebody confess it to yourself argue with yourself it doesn't matter God can see and it might just make the difference between life and death might be the difference between you serving that little Idol inside of you in complete deliverance again this can affect everybody I'm not just talking to people who don't have the Holy Ghost I'm talking to everybody me too that affects all of us 1955 the ark brother Brandon says and now to one thing the man appliable in the hands of God could be a great thing to God or you could be a great thing to the devil again the same tape I think he says um in verse 89 uh let me skip over that no I have to read the whole thing okay no matter what you got here in this world what you haven't got Keep Your Heart Right in tune with God for it's all everything all your hopes lands all your money all your sickness all your health all your children all everything that you've got here on this Earth will everything leave you and you'll go right straight back to the beginning again if that's right with God you'll come forth again just as certain as there is a God in heaven it's not if it's not right with God you got to take the other out you're here to make a choice make it today for Christ here's what I was talking about a second ago and in this day the scripture is fulfilled 1965. uh I've voted once that was for Christ I got to win the devil voted against Me In Christ voted for me depends on which way I cast my vote I'm glad I cast it on him let the world say what they want to I still believe that he's the same yesterday and forever he'll prove it he certainly will just cast your vote cast your vote on the word whatever I said today if it helped and it's not me I'm reading this a lot of these are verbatim like 50 of what I say in a sermon is read off of the tape or or somebody else said it it's not me no I I uh that reminds me you're talking about brother bless who just passed I never I never met him but um I just I see the reactions of those people you have and uh I remember it was it was hitting Becca hard when she first heard it we were still in Indiana at that point when she heard about it and it started affecting me so then I come here in the service and I sit back there I'm listening to service and sister uh sister Birds uh starts uh giving singing her song and tribute and um it started bringing tears to my eyes why I've never met him I don't know him uh you gotta there's this place where brother Brandon's talking about um I don't know what he's talking about he's talking about uh Jesus saying that they garnish the tombs of the prophets and they're the ones who put them there but he says the statement which is was interesting he says The Testament is not enforced until the testator is dead says The Testament is not enforced until the testator is dead so if you're getting a will you're getting your inheritance that person has to die for you to get your inheritance from what they have so I see all these testimonies and the Saints passing on I see those those are Testaments you guys they could say Old Testament New Testament it's all Testaments put it all together it's one big Testament and you know it hits the book of Acts and it doesn't end there Testament continues Our Testimony what are we going to tell our kids it's more of a testament more of a testimony for them and and it's just like what are they going to say about me after I pass well I've never met brother Robles but just because his Spirit was so christ-like and he touched all of your hearts and those people I can see your reaction and affects me and I'm starting to think about how I live bless that brother's heart I don't know him I will but I don't know him right now can't wait to see him that's a testament right there so um I'm going to kind of pivot a little bit you got to realize there's there's uh whichever way you cast your vote there's going to be terms and conditions all right how many people read their terms and conditions when you buy your phone or when you get your email address please one person just tell me you read all of it nobody I've never read one I read the title terms and conditions check that's it I didn't read that right there in church I didn't read it they could be buying my organs off of that terms and conditions I never read it I don't know I see the devil he don't he does terms and conditions the way the world does that's where they get it from that's the way these companies do it they they make that print super tiny zoom out you gotta zoom in I don't know 20 paragraphs long 10 pages I'm not gonna read that he makes it to where you don't want to read that and then he's like all right look at this great thing I'm giving you terms and conditions okay great thing and that's the way they lay it out because they know they can get you because you checked it yeah thank you the devil's going to do that but God does not do it that way praise God he says whenever he uh is giving you something he tells you with bold front what he's gonna do what things are good and what things are bad let me give you an example of terms and conditions from uh the book of Samuel first Samuel it says um I don't know if I want to read all this it's a Latin where I'm supposed to be wrapping up but um uh all right I'll read the whole thing then okay first Samuel chapter 8 10 to 20 11 verses let's go and this is Samuel talking to the Israelites and they want a king they want that and Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people and asked of them that asked of him a king and he said this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you he will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his chariots and be his Horsemen and some shall run before his chariots and he will appoint him captains over thousands captains over 50s and set them to ear his ground and to reap his Harvest and to make his instruments of Warren instruments for this chariots and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries and be cooks and to be Bakers and he will take your fields and your Vineyards and your hall of yards and the best of them and give them to his servants I know some of y'all eyes just glazed over terms and conditions right there right riveting stuff and that's what the Israelites thought they were just like all this stuff I said I just want a king I want someone I can see in front of me and that desire is it's good in a way because ultimately it's God's word you know he comes before them in the flesh and it was the greatest thing greatest person that ever set foot on Earth Jesus Christ they get to see that but it wasn't their time and this wasn't God's way that's not what he wanted and he will take a tenth of your seeding of your venions and give to his officers and to his servants and he will take your men servants and your maidservants and your good least young men and your asses and put them to his work he will take the tenth of your sheep and ye shall be his servants now he's telling them what's going to happen after they check this box and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which he shall have chosen you and the Lord will not hear you in that day nevertheless the people refuse to obey the voice of Samuel and they said nay check but we will have a king over us that we also may be like all the nations to be like others and that our King May judge us and go out before us and fight our battles any all done that for but God pray for something I I read your word and I prayed over it like 30 seconds I'm gonna do it and that's it you didn't listen he probably told you directly what is going to happen he told you in his word you might have spoken to you somehow giving you a sign that you shouldn't do it but you go and do it anyway I go and do that all the time sometimes I don't even ask because I know what he's gonna say and then I go and do it actually do I have a slide with a picture on it I do yes please I'll let you watch that while I read water [Music] I've been here before ask him what he wants you to do do whatever you want to do and then he has every right to question why you did what you did and then you ask him to bring you out of it that's me I'm not perfect but God when he gives you terms and conditions it's like I told you it's in bold font he challenges you in those terms and conditions Malachi 3 10. bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in thine house and prove me now herewith this is a promise that's his terms and conditions it's a promise if you check this box you get all these things saith the Lord of hosts if I will not and prove me not here with saith the Lord of host if I will not open you the windows of Heaven pour you out of blessing and there shall not be room enough to receive it I believe this church right here is evidence of that yeah pours you out of blessing and we got plenty of room coming and he's gonna fill that up too Luke 6 38 give and it shall be given to you another one good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that you meet with all it shall be measured to you again he's not saying you give me a you give me one the same measure I'm going to give you back the same measure you know he's saying a hundred times a thousand times a million times give me a dollar I'll give you a million I'm not preaching prosperity it's probably not literally going to be a million but your life will be fulfilled because you gave that to God and it might not come here on Earth it might come in heaven but he's gonna give it to you he doesn't have debtors God doesn't have debtors he got plenty to pay you back Mark 10 29-30 and Jesus answered and said verily I say unto you there is no man that hath left house or Brethren or sisters or father or wait left house or Brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake in the gospels but he shall receive 100 fold now in this time houses God's house you left how many houses y'all left I don't know you let first house your house right yeah was the second house that storefront okay and then that's the third one and then this is the fourth one this is a fourth yeah how many y'all left you've left four houses I'm I'm claiming it now we've left this house you can't forsake one and he won't give you another one there's no such thing as that it says it right here you left that house he's going to give you another one you're living in your father forsakes you your mother forsakes you your brother your sister doesn't matter who forsakes you God got another one for you most of mine I've had trouble with family I I honestly have spiritual fathers in the message that are better than my Earthly father in terms of leading me and guiding me I can go to them for the Jack's one of them I can ask them for advice I'm like oh Finance Finance Finance brother Jack what do I do brother Quentin somebody here like somebody is I can ask them for advice God gave me them I came here when I was 19 to the states I didn't have any Father Figure here now I've got multiple ones in my phone I got no problem with calling texting them mothers I got plenty of mothers I didn't realize it till I got married and then I knew I was getting married that wedding day I had a lot of mothers laughs a lot of mothers some of them younger than you mothers I got three older sisters those are also my mothers I got an older brother that's also my father yeah I love him to death God make sure you have who you need and what you need where you need however you need it no matter what you leave behind he's got something better for you my life's a testimony of that [Applause] and and I I allude to this a lot and it's it's um it's it's in um so that scripture where he's saying nobody's forsaken any of these things and not been given them back um I have this this quote from Laura Grace and I keep talking about this I don't know why I just keep feeling to say it a lot um this is one of those parents who have kids and you know you don't they're they're not following the Lord you don't know why you might have siblings it might be brothers sisters might be parents who aren't father and Lord you don't understand why brother Brandon says it's in the law of Grace say I want to ask you something here do you remember how he give his children back he's talking about Joe now remember he give him a double bunch so many thousand Ox he had first when they was all taken away he doubled the boxes when the Sheep he doubled them sheep but remember he had I believe it was seven or twelve at seven I forget just how just which it was sons and daughters but he had the same amount of sons and daughters God gave him gave them to him is that right see he doubled all his portions of goods here on Earth but his sons and daughters all of them got killed but he gave him the same amount of sons and daughters did you ever notice you take thought of that you remembered when we taught it there where was those sons and daughters in glory waiting for him see he give them every one to him see there wasn't one of them lost see the same amount of sons and daughters that he specified first he specified the same amount at last but he doubled his portion of sheep and ox and so forth like that but his sons and daughters were all saved waiting in glory for job to come to them that's worth it all isn't it and and just because just because there's somebody related by blood who's who's um who you've been praying for who's not coming in it doesn't mean there's not someone in the church who's supposed to take that person's place are you looking out for your your your little siblings your little children in Christ are you looking out for them am I I don't know I I pray for who I remember I'm really bad with names but I try I try to look out for those younger than me those who are still just starting out if you don't then you're kind of neglecting something that's like that someone in church who you should have who's who you've adopted just by being there now parental negligence puts you in prison what does this do I'm not saying it's going to put you in prison I'm just saying you're it's just as bad as if you didn't give them a home didn't clothe them and they're your blood and your flesh and blood you should look out for those people those people who walk into churches sometimes I see young people coming to our church and they don't have anybody they just came by themselves brother sister uh young like under 25 and bringing themselves to church alone their family might have kicked him out of another church it's or they their family doesn't know anything they don't have family they don't know like am I looking out for him did God put him or her in the position for me to watch over God help me I don't want to miss that I'm almost done I don't know how time works here um so I'm still in terms and conditions one last thing God is he the devil the devil he he is just like the tech if you want to know what the devil's like look at tech support if you've ever had to call them right you call tech support how long before you actually talk to somebody you can't find them you can't you wouldn't first off you're not gonna me if I call tech support for my phone right here it's a Google pixel if I call tech support for this phone I'm not going to meet the engineer who designed this phone I'm not gonna meet the person who coded the software in this phone I'm not gonna reach them they don't have to be there they're not going to answer me that's exactly how the devil is when everything goes wrong after you followed his advice where is he nowhere couldn't find him if I tried can't even find the number it's not on the website type of an email he's not going to read that that's tech support here but God if you if you you need to have a relationship with God just to get what he are asking for from him so if he's given you something that's a relationship starting right there you go to Jeremiah it says in verse 12 it says uh verse 12 of uh chapter 29 then ye shall call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me and when ye shall search for me with all your heart in Isaiah 65 24 and it says and it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer wouldn't that be crazy if you picked up your phone to call tech support and they were calling you it's like I knew you had a problem I designed it this way live it that's what you got to do that's God right there that's that's my tech support I think I think I'm done for now I'm cutting this short for now because uh I want to be mindful of the time musicians can come back thank you um but I'd like for us to pray one more time before before I close um precious uh Heavenly Father we thank you for the word we heard from you today and uh for the blessing that you bestowed upon us you use the lips of singers and people praying and our pastors speaking words

much that we could take from amen all that he spoke to our hearts amen he made a statement towards the end about um if in the natural we parental negligence and wasn't taking care of our kids they would come and do things to us Mike calls us to go to prison because we're neglecting children and you know I was just thinking spiritually sometimes God will allow you to go through certain situations in your life and oftentimes what happens as Believers we neglect to be able to reach out to other people that's going through the same thing that God has already brought us through and when we do that it actually creates more bondage for the person and something and I know that my wife have talked about this there's some times that you really wish that you could just be open and honest with people and just let them know all you know you need to let them know uh but sometimes folk just don't know how to handle information hello somebody and man sometimes when people open up and just giving you on their heart you got to know that you can't take that and just be sharing it everywhere [Music] in order to help you come on somebody right so I'll tell you we have a we have a job to do we want to watch out for one another um we want to we want to make it make it that's the best that's that's the objective we all want to make let's have a word of prayer we'll close the service amen
