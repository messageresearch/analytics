through on the other side of covet amen also uh thank god for the sister is this sister rosanna ramirez and then god bless you good to have you in fellowship with us on today amen also she was invited by brother quentin late man thank god for that and brother lucy good to see you amen luke is in the house amen praise the lord could i just get a little bit more on the monitor amen um let me just give you all um some announcements say man a number of things that we kind of have going on praise the lord um thank you so don't forget service this um wednesday uh we'll continue to do our periscope and facebook i know that um we have been having some issues with the sound and things like that but i believe um it was last sunday during service brother clinton discovered something that kind of revolutionized everything and i believe everything should be running pretty smooth uh you know as it stands now and the exp what you should see on uh the experience that you have on periscope should be the exact same experience that you have on uh on facebook so uh thank you for just your patience and working with us as we were just trying to navigate all the new equipment but by god's grace i think we made it through and now we have things kind of stabilized and and uh trust that your experience would be pleasant amen so we'll continue to do our periscope and and facebook on wednesday night only the saints that are 60 and above are allowed to come to service amen on wednesdays but everybody else reacts that you would just dream amen uh also no service on friday night into further notice however this this week this upcoming week uh there will be a service a youth service on saturday night it'll start at 6 30 p.m saturday night that's this this coming week and that youth service amen is uh is is for our saints only those that are spearing truth tabernacle only are only ones allowed to actually come into the sanctuary we want to maintain social distances so uh we know that we invite all the other churches but this time it'll just be spirit and truth tabernacle and uh we ask that others just join us online because we will live stream the service so keep that in mind that happened again 6 30 on um on saturday so keep that in mind uh also next week uh we'll be having our 9 a.m and and 12 p.m service but we'll have some guest ministers coming from brother nathan bryant's church and uh they'll just be joining us here next weekend and but nathan's gonna be preaching on next um sunday at 12 and we're gonna be having uh i was telling him early in the year that we want to do a prayer line but i just couldn't figure out how to do it with this this pandemic uh but the lord just kind of put in my spirit just to do a virtual prayer line as well as amen one that would be done in person so saints that are here in the church if you had a particular need or if you knew someone that had a particular need we want to invite you to be a part of the prayer line but those that uh that um that are joining us online um we're putting things out on social media and i'm going to ask the saints here in the church as you see the different announcements on social media make you make sure you share that with others because we want to just get people just to kind of put their requests in but we're going to pray over their requests right here amen just like we would pray over the people that are coming through the line so it'll be something different be something new but i am basing it on the scripture uh where jesus was told by the centurion you don't need to come into my house it says but if you would just speak the word only my servant will be made whole so we gonna put that in practice is that all right that was the first that was the first virtual prayer line praise the lord and it worked hallelujah so we're going we're going to do the same thing right here we're going to speak the word over some conditions and you know i i put the request out and and i saw somebody uh already sending a request they say pray that god would deliver me from a stroke that attacked my body we praying over that i believe god can reverse the effects of a stroke i heard brother branham pray for somebody like that and god reversed it so you know i believe he's the same yesterday today and forever he hears our prayers just amen even today so we're going to be uh taking these things before the lord and i want to encourage you have people uh just submit their requests there'll be a form just go to the you know click on the form submit the request we'll get it and we're going to be praying on it just as if they were walking through the line the only other thing that we ask is that put your faith with our faith join the service connect to the service and that way you can hear the requests being called and when you hear that your faith get anointed and believe god for your healing right so we're just asking amen that everybody would do that just encourage people to join us online and amen i believe god's gonna do something special so that'll be next week amen and also uh just want to quickly mention about our outreach amen um opportunity before i do that i'm being i forgot we got birthdays coming up amen uh this week uh sister darishna a man uh she's celebrating on the 12th and we thank god for that praise the lord and uh also brother troy be celebrating on friday august 14th the lord gives giving him another year as well so we thank god for that as well amen uh so this week we'll be starting on the 13th uh thursday august 13th uh i believe about four o'clock uh we'll be starting out a new outreach that's been given to us uh it's a food pantry that will be uh serving food and uh and i just want to just mention that if you if you desire it's going to be we're going to be doing it every thursday right here off of skis road and um and if you desire to be a part of it just either get in contact with me or uh like i mentioned to your sister tina i'm actually having her spearhead this uh cesatina has already demonstrated that she had a passion for this right uh we were she had been giving food out to the homeless uh when nobody knew it she was taking food down there giving it to the homeless in late worth and uh so she's already demonstrated she got a passion for this so when i was told about the uh the opportunity i just immediately said well you know this this would be a good fit for sister tina and uh you know but we need to come alongside and try to help her but i want her to be the one to spearhead and just kind of lead this up uh from our church and and that's that's that's how we're doing that but uh we need everybody uh that would want to participate to participate there's there's things to be done uh in this opportunity for us just to serve our community so uh i want to ask if you if you have time you might not be able to do it every thursday but if you can find one thursday out of the month that you can commit to let's try to put a plan together a schedule together that we'll know who gonna be there on what days and and then we'll know what what to do uh but i believe uh god's gonna use this for his glory and uh i think we get an opportunity first to start feeding physically but ultimately we want to feed spiritually amen and and uh so so we're just we're just praying that god's going to open up those doors and and we're asking that everyone that wants to join us please join us now and the other thing i want to make make mention of it's a food pantry amen we are there to serve amen so if you are volunteering remember you're there to serve not yourself but to serve other people y'all understand what i'm saying amen don't take the food home praise the lord somebody amen the food is there to be given to somebody but don't look at this as an opportunity oh of some free no we there to serve people praise the lord now if you know if somebody were to give you something that's one thing don't take it let somebody give it to you is that all right because if you take it that's considered stealing and that's one that's against one of the commandments thou shalt not steal all right praise the lord so you know i'm just i'm just asking just give your heart to this amen and and let's serve people that might be might not have as much as what we have let's let's serve them with everything we can and and and just look for opportunities that we might be able to get people into the presence of the lord as well so that is our desire that's why we're there and that is our hope so keep that in mind that'll be starting on this thursday this will be the first week that we'll start it at 4 00 p.m so if you desire to uh to be a part please let us know let me know or just reach out to cesatina as well just let her know and we'll make sure we get you uh connected amen praise the lord all right let's uh just quickly amen share about our giving uh since things have changed amen in this season we are giving uh we've uh provided ways for people to be able to give online we've always had the church paypal account but we added cash app during this season and if you desire to just send a offering a man through cash app you can do that the uh cash symbol spirit and truth t is our name there and also if you want to use paypal just make sure you choose giving select gift gift a friend or family member and when you choose that option you should be able to give to the email address of giving at john423.org in the past my email my personal email address was attached i have taken my personal email off of the church account and we're trying to make it all church related so uh so if you try to use my old email address it may not work so i just want to i want to ask everyone please use giving john423.org amen that's going to be much much better if you desire just to mail it into the uh into the uh through the mail that's perfectly fine as well our church address is there on the screen at the bottom of the screen spirit and truth tabernacle 3951 happy hill road suite 109 west palm beach florida 334 17 praise the lord so we thank god for all things amen let us pray over our giving amen at this time god we thank you for the opportunity we have to be able to give we ask that you would use it for the furtherance of your kingdom lord jesus here on earth and uh we trust lord jesus that you continue to meet the needs of your people as you have continued to meet the needs of this church lord how grateful we are and our expectations are rising daily we we walk like abraham uh father the longer he waited for the promise the more he believe and god that's where we are when it comes to the church in school the longer we wait the more we believe god that uh we're fully persuaded that what you've promised you're able to perform and and god we're just believing you for great things we've seen you move in so many ways uh it just blows our minds so god we're just on expectation for this this final piece uh that you will bring us into the right building uh lord you know exactly what we stand in need of and what we have faith for uh we ask that you just meet it father according to riches and glories in christ jesus name we pray amen amen praise the lord god bless you thank you musicians i really appreciate you all amen certainly thank god uh for giving us the best musicians amen in the message praise alone i'm just just so grateful god is god is good um after um service if you all don't mind i'm i need to just mention something to you all uh just privately so if you don't mind just remain seated after service amen i greatly appreciate that um so i want to read a uh a scripture two scriptures if i can very very familiar scriptures um and i i just trust that the lord will just bless amen our time together uh here from i want to go to isaiah 40 and just read verse 31 and then also psalm 27 we praise the name of the lord actually it's hard to just read this verse 31 i i got to read more than that verse 26 let's let's start there um and um and isaiah says lift up your eyes on high and behold who hath created these things that bringeth out their hosts by number they call them all by names by the greatness of his might for that he is strong in power not one faileth why says thou jacob and speakest o israel my way is hid from the lord and my judgment is passed over from my god hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth faith is not neither is weary there is no searching for of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength even the you shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run not be weary they shall walk and not faint amen also here in um psalms 27 hey man um this um i think i'll start reading um a little early here verse seven let's start at verse seven here in psalms 27 praise the lord nothing like the word of god amen amen uh says um hear o lord when i cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me uh when thou sayest seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face lord will i seek hide not by face far from me putting out thy servant away in anger thou hast been my help leave me not neither forsake me or god of my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the lord will take me up um teach me thy way o lord and leave me in a plain path because of mine enemies deliver me not over into the will of my neighbors for false witnesses are risen up against me such as breathe out cruelty i had fainted unless i had believed to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living and this is a very very important statement that david makes wait on the lord be of good courage so while you're waiting you got to have a right attitude wait on the lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait i say on the lord amen the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word shall we pray father we thank you for the ability to read scripture we trust that the holy ghost would come now to make us understand what it is that we have read god take control over the thought here today be glorified and magnified exalted to the lord in this place and we uh act so god that you would just uh come in and speak to every heart we take control over every spirit that is against the holy spirit here this morning and uh lord may you just have your way in and just minister to each and every need we commit this portion of service into your hands in jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated praise the lord uh we want to uh use for a subject today uh waiting for the appointed time amen waiting for the appointed time and um i'm still in the channel of uh pick up your pen and write we are grabbing another uh paragraph uh from when the prophet was told by the angel lord to pick up his pen and write say i'm gonna write this message and this is gonna be a word uh to the bride hey man this is the word that comes forth to the bride and and actually i'll be honest i am thoroughly enjoying uh just going through this myself and just almost picking it paragraph by paragraph uh we have an opportunity just to kind of sit and dwell on what the lord wants to speak to us just in that section amen uh it's like we're taking a paragraph and and expanding it right uh that that's that's that's what i feel like we're doing on on this journey and uh so there was a statement that was made and i'm going to read out of the programming church age i'm reading two paragraphs before we get to the thought of where we are today i'm starting at paragraph 175 1 and we've already preached this paragraph but i'm kind of just bringing us forward and bringing us into where we are today so uh here in the pergamos the prophet says this uh i should say the angel said to the prophet amen the strange behavior of moses elijah and john withdrawing from the people into seclusion left many confused they did not realize that it was because their message had been rejected but the seed had been sown the planting was over judgment was next they had served their purpose as a sign to the people so judgment was next when god would send the prophet amen it was uh it was a it was a sign that judgment was coming after that prophet was leaving right so uh here uh he goes on and we hit this on last week says i believe according to revelation 13 16. amen that the bride will have to stop preaching glory for the beast is demanding the mark in the hand or forehead hallelujah and that mark in the hand represent them you're gonna be working for some system hallelujah amen your thoughts would be all about that system come on somebody you got that that's i mean then um uh a brother gene came just a week before and told us that we got to think on the word of god so your word is a as a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path we have to constantly think on the word of god amen because if you stop thinking on the word of god you start thinking with everything else that's going on around us and then we we respond the wrong way we don't respond like believers we do respond like nominal christians come on somebody but believers are different than nominal christians we think different we act different we walk different we talk different we live different amen and we're not ashamed to be different blessed be the name of the lord but but this you know as i was just kind of going through this last week the lord the holy spirit just kind of gave it conditioning for the boycott amen because this is the great boycott that's that's really about to happen amen wait till they bring the picket signs to your church oh wait wait wait today wait wait till they come and and say y'all can't go until no one have service they already doing that with this i mean with this corona thing amen it's going to get worse hallelujah church that's why we better take advantage of the time that we have amen i believe according to this is the angel speaking this amen i believe according to revelation 13 16 that the bride will have to stop preaching i know it's the bride not the church but the bride will have to stop preaching amen for the beast is demanding the mark in the hand of forehead if permission to preach be granted now you all y'all remember hallelujah there in um uh in acts 4 they had come and told the disciples no more preaching about jesus amen amen i mean nowadays uh they don't mind you praying uh and publicly but they really have a problem if you put in jesus name they don't want that right i mean they have to write out their prayers right but uh but but if you put that in jesus name it just it just draws attention hallelujah uh we we baptized in the name of jesus we pray in the name of jesus everything we do is in the name of jesus so it's god it's going to be an attack against people that's standing in the name of jesus hallelujah watch you know so so you know they told those boys say now uh don't don't y'all use this name no more you know y'all can go out there and preach i can do this but don't use the name jesus but they say now who should we uh who should we actually obey should it be you a god hallelujah should it be y'all y'all y'all rules are god's rules which one are we going to obey and now they say say i tell you we're going to stand with god hallelujah and uh and the bible said they began to pray after they were threatened glory to god and the bible said after they prayed the place was shaken amen and and i'ma tell you if you want to see something shake again today we better get back to prayer hallelujah the place was shaken it said now behold their threatenings grant unto thy servants that with all boldness we may speak thy word by stretching forth on hand to heal and signs and wonders will be done by the name of thy holy child jesus brother god was moving in the book of acts and he's still moving today hallelujah boycott of no boycott god is still moving god is still god amen he says denominations will take the mark or be forced to quit preaching then the lamb will come for his bride and judge the great harlot i thank god for that promise that even when we feel this pressure uh there's going to be a a pressure to lift us up out of here so i'm on the expectation but now we go forward amen in this in this statement that the angel's making says now remember that moses was born for a certain work but he could not do that work until he had received the gifts which would enable him to do the work now you know when he when he went to the the burning bush and had an experience with god this is where he was receiving the gifts that would enable him to do the work right he had to go out he he uh he threw that rod down and turned into a snake and you know he put his hand inside his chest it turned to you know a leprosy pulled it back out it was healed picked the rod up the rod turned back to the stick these are the gifts that he received in order to do the work now watch this he had to go out in the desert and wait there god had an appointed time now now this is important because moses with all the training that he had received with his mother a man telling him uh that he was born to be the deliverer moses tried to take his military training and use that to bring deliverance hallelujah glory to god but that was not the way god wanted to bring deliverance god wanted to use the supernatural god wanted to blow people's minds by sending a man with a stick in his hand amen 80 years old not even in good strength and good health but i'm sending you down there in this condition to get my people out of egypt bless it be the name of the lord it shows that it's not gonna have anything to do with moses but it's gonna have everything to do with god hallelujah if you're waiting on god this morning maybe you've been trying things a little bit too hard god wants you to know it's got nothing to do with you but everything to do with him amen he deserves the glory he deserves a honor he deserves a praise amen god just needs you to show up but he gonna take care of this hallelujah he had to go out in the desert amen and wait there 40 years of waiting hallelujah 40 whole years of waiting imagine it and god because god had an appointed time there was to be a certain pharaoh on the throne and the people had to be crying for the bread of life before god could send him back this is true for our day now i was you know just kind of meditating on that waiting uh for the appointed time and that word wait you know oftentimes if we really really want something and we want it real bad the the work the one word we don't want to hear is weight hey man i mean i i really want it i'm looking forward to getting this and amen i mean i i can i i got to have it and if somebody come and tell you wait we just don't want to hear that hallelujah we live in a society where uh people just don't want to wait for nothing amen i'll be the first one to say i i if i'm going to a fast food restaurant praise the lord you you named it fast food therefore there should be no wait no wait hallelujah right and i'll be the first one to pull out the line because i had to wait a little bit too long it's going to take me just as long to get to some other restaurant and get the food but i just didn't want to wait there we live in a world where even people just get tired of actually waiting jesus amen but yet in our christian amen our development waiting is a part of that and learning how to wait with a good attitude god let me preach to myself jesus learning how to wait a man is still keeping a smile on your face when things ain't going your way amen i'm still waiting and i'm still pressing praise god i'm not gonna lose my christian experience because i had to wait oh hallelujah weight means to stay where one is think about this weight means to stay where one is it also means to delay action until a particular time or should i put it this way to delay action until the appointed time look at this it also means a man uh it's to delay action until something else happens so you know i'm looking at uh of this definition and i'm thinking about the children of israel they were in bondage for 400 years down in egypt uh but you know and and maybe somebody was looking at a calendar and they were thinking that you know 400 years has hit it's time for us to get out of here and maybe moses even thought that hey man this is the 400th year we got to do something so he tried in his own strength to start getting the people ready for this great deliverance but god said no that's not the way i want you to do it amen i got an appointed time as to when this is going to happen not only do i have an appointed time there has to be a certain pharaoh on the throne and then the people have to have their hearts in a particular condition before i can actually send you down there and we get some results hallelujah amen they had they had a time but maybe not the appointed time now now genesis 15 verse 13 through 16 shows us that they had to wait until something else happened oh glory to god amen yes we have 400 years but maybe we got to wait till something else happens look at this amen genesis 15 verse 13 it said and he said unto abram no of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them four hundred years my and also that nation whom they shall serve will i judge and afterward they shall come out with great substance hallelujah when they borrowed all the goods from the uh from the from the egyptians they went out with great substance i i tell you we're not leaving this earth poor that well i'ma put it this way i'm not leaving poor i don't know what somebody else revelation is if i'm gonna walk on streets of gold that means there's gonna be an upgrade for what i got down here hallelujah glory to god amen look he says and also that nation whom they shall serve will i judge and after it shall they come out with great substance and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full they were waiting for the iniquity of the amorites to get full for god to get tired of the things that was happening in that land they had to wait for some other conditions before they would be released to go in hallelujah see sometimes waiting amen requires us to wait till something else happens uh i thought i thought about ruth ruth had to wait for boaz to make his public testimony amen um he had to approach the nearer kinsmen and uh and he had to i had to offer redemption for the nearest kissman to naomi and uh and when he when when he got to the nearest kinsmen he'd say now you know if you're going to redeem him naomi say yeah i'll take it say are you going to redeem me say yeah i'll take say now if you take her you also got to take ruth and you got to raise up seed to the dead so the man said oh i can't do that because that'll marry my own testimony that am i my own amen inheritance i don't want to do that he said well if you're not going to do it give me the right to redeemer he said i'm going to give you the right and then boaz had to take off his shoe and make a public testimony that in front of the elders say this is the woman i'm going to redeem naomi i will redeem but ruth i will marry praise god he made a public testimony and jesus when he went to the cross amen he made a public testimony he was redeeming not just israel but all the world but he also got a wife this gentile bride has become his wife hallelujah amen ruth had to wait for that thing to happen we're waiting for the coming the second coming of the lord jesus christ i also thought about this young lady that kept approaching the prophet every time he would see her she said brother brandon what's the interpretation of my dream what's the interpretation of my dream and uh brother branham you know he said i don't know sister and then he would go and interpret somebody else's dream right in front of her and then she'd say well brother branham you told them what that dream meant but you haven't told me what mommy what is the interpretation of my dream and uh brother branham said sister let me tell you something to say your parents they support my meetings they're very uh good people and i really love them they love me he says but if i was to tell you something wrong then that would admire my testimony before your parents say so i can't go ahead of god if i don't have the word amen he said i think i know what it means but until i'm sure i'm gonna wait for god to give it to me amen and sometimes amen we gotta get to the spot where we we just gotta wait amen don't get ahead of god god has an appointed time even if he's made you a promise and you know he's going to come through on the promise you just have to wait for him to fulfill it in his appointed time glory to god stay where you are that's what weight means just stay where you at stay where you're at and wait on god's appointed time don't try to make it happen just stay where you're at wait because you'll know when god has opened up a door hey hallelujah you'll know when god opens up the door and i'm going to tell you something when god opened up the door typically he makes you feel very uncomfortable hallelujah that's when god is opening the door when you start feeling very uncomfortable in your situation because you you know here in america it's very easy to get comfortable man all we believe god for is that that one job that can pay us so much and if i can make this much money on this job and i can get all these bills paid then i'm good hallelujah but you don't realize that that company you're working for they making a lot more money on you being there hallelujah amen so sometimes god will make things get very uncomfortable and when it gets uncomfortable that is the tender hand of jehovah leading you to greener pastures oh glory to god sometimes you got to wait though amen because oftentimes we don't want to go through nothing amen but have a testimony when you when you're leaving somewhere have a testimony this happened that happened that happened we knew it was god amen amen amen all right all right all right uh i was reading this quote here and trying to do god of service without it being being his will uh paragraph 80 is what i'm reading here now the prophet himself had to wait before he took an invitation to preach amen he had to wait says now when all this happens let us now see uh what happens when god and his age and his time is not considered just the people's idea it says many people have said to me why don't you come over here and hold a meeting well we'll call for you sign this that or the other wait you might wait you might want it but what does god say about it many people said to me i've had invitation i've had interviews personal interviews and things waited for a year wait how will i know what to say until god tells me what to say see got to wait that's the reason i said write that out let me see what he said see wait they that weighed upon the lord shall renew their strength that's right we got to learn how to just wait on the lord even when god give a dream he might not be given an interpretation right away amen oftentimes we want the interpretation right away but god may not do it that way hallelujah you got to learn how to just wait on commit the thing to god and wait hallelujah glory to god so important to learn amen this we have to learn to wait look at this i was looking at uh saul because saul didn't didn't wait for the appointed time amen uh he got ahead of the prophet amen and he began to give some excuses as to why he got ahead and i'ma tell you whenever you begin to give excuses excuses only satisfy the person that's given it hallelujah your excuse will only satisfy you it's not going to amen satisfy the other person that you're giving it to yes they'll work with you but they don't appreciate the excuse god does not appreciate our excuses as to why we did this and why we did that god wants us to learn how to wait look at this look at this i was reading this on about sammy and i and i i want you to get uh first samuel 13 reading about saul first seven 13 verse eight just give me a second i'll pull it up in a second let's get ready for that first samuel 13 8 saul was pre-anointed i should say anointed to be king he went there to the prophet samuel and uh sam he was looking for some animals that is that his dad in lawson when he got there to the prophet to go ask the prophet hey where the animals are where are the animals uh the prophet pulled them to the side and say hey i'm gonna anoint you god told me you was coming you're gonna be the first king of israel hallelujah and as he's telling them all of this and and i mean sam saul did not go to the prophet's house to get this type of anointing but he just went there looking for animals hallelujah but god had something greater for him now while he was in the presence of the prophet the prophet gave him some specific things one was uh he says you're gonna when you leave here you're gonna find two men by rachel's sepulcher and they they're gonna inform you that the animals were found this was a prophecy that he was about to walk into he is going to step into this vision look at this amen he says then after after that you're going to meet three men carrying three kids or three goats say three loaves of bread and also one of them gonna have one bottle of wine they're gonna try to give it to you make sure you receive it from their hands this is another vision that he's about to step into glory to god says now he said third thing you're gonna meet a company of prophets who who are gonna be under the anointing prophesied and this anointing gonna be so great it's gonna get on you saul and it's gonna cause you to become another man three things that were supposed to happen all three things happened but the prophet gave him a full thing to do hallelujah now you know god is with you when these three things happen you also know god is speaking through me as a prophet when you see these three when you see these three things happen so you need to learn how to wait on this fourth thing hallelujah the fourth thing was go down to gilgal and wait seven days before you make an offering to the lord not only wait seven days but wait for me to come before you make an offering to the lord now let's pick this up in first samuel 13. the other things happened and it was so clear uh that god was speaking through samuel but here saul had a problem waiting and i'm going to tell you something that's where most of our problem is we have a problem just waiting we we have no problem taking the promise god you said it but waiting for it to happen we got a problem with we can always remind god of what he says hallelujah hallelujah that's why that's why when you know what it says you can you can rest it's going to come to pass god can't lie i don't care how long it takes if you got to wait 25 years like abraham wait 25 years you got to wait 120 years like like noah wait 120 years brother man i'm saying say god ain't in no hurry we're the only ones in a hurry watch this watch this he tear it seven days now now remember the appointed time is not just the seven days the appointed time is when the prophet comes amen on the seventh day that's when we're gonna do the offering don't just wait seven days that's not what i told you but wait until i come hallelujah on the seventh day glory to god see he's looking at the time but not the appointed time oh jesus amen some must be looking at the time but what is the appointed time praise god church amen we got to get right in between there find god's appointed time hallelujah so he's waited seven days that's what he that's what he heard the prophet say wait seven days but he didn't wait on the prophet look at this and he teared seven days according to the set time that samuel had appointed but samuel came not to gilgal and the people were scattered from him glory and saul said now see now god allows it to get a little rough here amen for saul that's why i say you know when god's moving when things get a little hey man you you feel a little uncomfortable now you know god's starting to move but in the midst of this god is challenging this man to see where his faith is his faith is actually in the people that got him surrounded oh god help us here sometimes some of our faith is in that job that we got oh hallelujah my faith was in the job that i had my my face said i gotta keep this job god said no i want you to go full-time in ministry god i got a house payment i want you to go full time a minute god i got car payments i want you to go god i'm gonna do this hallelujah glory to god but god made it so uncomfortable that i couldn't i couldn't stay on the jobs amen i learned how to wait on the lords hey man look at this he teared seven days according to the set time that sammy appointed but samuel came not to give god the people were scattered from him so now he's thinking about doing something different because the situation is changing on him and saul said bring hither burnt offering to me and peace offerings and he offered the burnt offering and as a king he was not supposed to be doing this hallelujah this was not his position to be doing this look it says uh and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering behold samuel came and saul went out to meet him that he might salute him no no no now now he now he's getting up quickly going to samuel because you know some people glory to god they uh you know they the way he's coming to samuel is that i want to i want to greet you before you greet me amen because i want to try to influence you before you say something to me hallelujah somebody hey man glory to god god can read right through all that type of stuff and look at look at this nice answer and samuel said what has thou done and saul said because i saw that the people were scattered from me amen his faith was in the people not in god he's i mean all the prophecies that samuel had given him had already come to pass he should have known this had nothing to do with the people but everything to do with almighty god i saw that the people were scattered from me and then look at this and that thou came as not within the days appointed how could he fix his mouth to say something like that to the prophet because here the prophet is coming at the end of his offering on the seventh day all he had to do was wait a little bit longer now i'ma tell you something hallelujah because he refused to wait he got refused as king oh jesus i want you to think about it because he refused to wait he got refused as king look at this look at this look at this it goes on to say this in verse 11. it says samuel said what has thou done and saul said because i saw that the people were scattered for me and that thou came is not within the days appointed and that the philistines gathered themselves together uh at mickmash therefore said i the philistines would come down now upon me the good guy says what he thinking he don't he's not even giving god any credit here oftentimes we operate in what we feel going to happen actually you are creating that that situation oh y'all don't get that you actually creating what's going to happen in your mind oh jesus let me read this and i'm gonna just tell you so therefore said either philistines would come down now upon me to give god and i have not made supplication unto the lord i forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering look at the words he choose i i forced myself to do this no you didn't force yourself you were afraid you did that out of fear amen sometimes when we're waiting we get afraid that things are not going to come to pass but if god made a promise god gonna bring it to pass hallelujah glory to god just wait on the lord and be of good courage he'll strengthen thy heart see sometimes we create it i remember uh brother uh we were just talking about him amen uh gatson he came here and he preached and and he was talking about how he would fear the deer he said i just i would just fear the deer and it says he would go down this street and he'd gone down one time and you know he and the first time he went down there was no problem living in south carolina he had no problem saying but one day he hit a deer on this street on one of south carolina streets winding through the neighborhoods and they say say hit a deer and at night so so he was just always afraid that when he come down through that park that he's gonna hit another deer and he says uh uh uh he got another car after hitting the first deer he said now you know i don't want to be there at night i have a feeling i'ma hit another deer he come down at night hit another deer and it kept happening over and over and over again he would hit deers because he was actually create the very thing that he was fearing he was creating and the very thing that you are fearing because you keep talking about it you keep worrying about it the very thing that you are fearing is the thing that you are creating if you can just have some faith and change your your fear to faith then you'll create positive experiences you'll create positive testimonies hallelujah you gotta change the way you look at things and while you're in the midst of just waiting just just just worship and praise god in the midst of it he'll bring you through he's going to strengthen your heart he's going to give you a testimony the longer the test the greater the testimony hallelujah oh my my my my i was thinking about uh david let me just uh oh my before i go there oh jesus jesus yeah let me do i have this david david had to learn how to wait david a man uh was battling the philistines and uh before he went out to battle he asked god some specific instructions god said okay do it this way and then um the philistines regrouped and won the fight again and david was ready to go attack again but he asked god before he went out and said lord shall i go lord said no no no no don't don't go this time he says but what i want you to do is go wait underneath the mulberry trees it says and wait till you hear the sound going forth in the mulberry trees then you'll know to go out to battle hallelujah and he had to sit there and wait now brother branham brings this out on a quote that i won't just read amen and um make it away hallelujah he says how did my blind eyes be healed god made a way oh yes i love that how you got out of this situation god made a way how you got that house that you got god made a way how you got the car that you got god made a way come on somebody he always wants to make a way you don't need to make the way let god make a way that way you have something to say in a testimony service god did this and god did that and god did this and god did that god made a way it says god made a way hallelujah sir he will always make a way and for you here that's in the earth today you who are waiting for the consolation you who are pilgrims and strangers be like david it says david was going to the battle he didn't go flustrated amen he didn't go with a halfway mark he didn't go thinking maybe it'll do it but he waited in the mulberry bush until after a while it was death silent sometimes you feel your situations like that god ain't heard your prayer he heard you the first time you prayed you just waiting on the answer to be manifested glory to god it says uh uh while it was death silent nothing going after a while way back in the distance he heard the leaves start got louder and louder and louder after a while a great gush of wind went on before him he know that was god and a holy host of angels going before him and he drew his sword and took the battle and set the enemy to flight but before these things happened david had to wait in silence church sometimes before we see god move on our behalf we're gonna have to learn to wait in silence not saying a word blessed be the name of the lord this message trying to do god of service without it being the will of god brother branham made a a comment and i know what it means to wait in silence amen i had to experience that before i even started the church i had to wait in silence and you know when you when you when i was waiting in silence there was things that i couldn't even tell my wife amen i had to actually wait for her wait for god to do something in her life amen god had to show her some things and then we could have a conversation because had i said it it would have been me inflecting my spirit on her brother branham say i'm afraid we're not getting the people to christ he says i'm afraid we're getting one another spirit and not the holy spirit so i couldn't say anything glory to god watch this it says who is it that will dare to correct him brother branham's talking talking this and uh making this comment and and uh trying to do god of service without it being his will who is it that will dare to correct him and say now lord you made a mistake by putting this man in the ministry this man doesn't believe like we believe who is going to tell god he is wrong in it it would take somebody that's a little more of a delinquent than i am to tell him that he knows what he's doing he knows who to choose and who not to choose what to do and when to do it no matter how much we think that a certain person is qualified to do a certain job god knows who is qualified for the time and the season or the time and the right time to do it appointed time look at this he says and the real true christian the real true believer in god waits upon the lord for these things look at this wait on your ministry if you feel a call be sure that it's god be sure that it's right be sure that it's timely of what you're saying the bible says they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings like an eagle they shall run and not be where if they walk they'll not faint i was i was i was listening to this message earlier this week and and it just blessed my heart you know as i was thinking i said because you know i had to wait i had to wait before the spirit and two time and i could got started i had to wait uh i mean i was i was i was uh holding on to something god had showed me and i was still doing things for two years with just just waiting see sometimes folks could get something from the lord they just jump up so quick they god show me this and i'm out of here hey man you ain't got nowhere to go you ain't got you you don't even know what you're doing hallelujah and you and you out of here because god showed you that's why things don't work out because people get ahead of god right you got to learn how to wait on the lord right and i sat there and i said no i i said i know the lord just showed me this i'm reading this out of scripture i'm seeing this and i've seen that god showed me and i just i just waited just wait waited just waited and then uh you know one day the lord began to give my wife some dreams and as we start talking about the dreams and then start figuring out some things that okay this is the lord speaking hallelujah this is the lord speaking so you know and and when she finally come to me saying uh she knew that we had to make a decision she we got to do something we got to do some i said yeah i know she'd say well we started church if you start a church what you gonna name it i said spirit and truth tabernacle and i said it just like that she said uh where you get that from and i just began to tell her what the lord done for me two years prior hallelujah when i was uh reading john 15 and john 15 said uh you know a tree would be fruitful amen but there were times where that tree had to be pruned it had to be cut it wasn't that the tree was not fruitful but it had to go through a process of being pruned in order for it to bear more fruit so i knew that the ministry that i was a part of was a fruitful ministry but in order for that minister to bear more fruit i was going to be the ones cut prune cut from it hallelujah glory to god but by in the midst of being cut i knew i was also being planted blessed be the name of the lord so so i i said lord i i see what you're trying to speak to me through john 15. went to a convention very first service that the preacher come out and preach he say i'm preaching from john 15 and he saved the title my sermon is fruit much fruit more fruit i said i said god this man came from from his church just to preach to me and i sat there and i heard the word of the lord and i said lord i know you're speaking to me what do you want me to do god with this i say lord i know you're calling me to start a church but what do you want me to do he said well i said lord what's going to be the name of the church he said spirit and truth tabernacle i held it i never said a word to anybody i waited i waited i waited went back to my former church and still had song service everything i was asked to do by the past i did never telling nobody i didn't pull nobody to the side saying god told me to start a church and it's going to be spirit and truth tabernacle god i never said a word to anybody you got to learn how to wait in silence i'ma tell you while you're waiting in silence god has proven you uh um let me just let me i'm just just give me a little time here god has proven god is watching your faithfulness while i'm waiting i'm still cleaning the church on saturdays while i'm waiting i'm still preparing for song service while i'm waiting i'm ready to do whatever the pastor asked me to do while i am waiting all the way down to amen hallelujah i just leave that i i have to leave that but oh god knows all things god knows all things while you're waiting be faithful while you're waiting be committed while you're waiting watch your attitude now let me just kind of uh drop something in here i want to bring this up the spiritual adoption because adoption is your placing amen but you got to learn how to wait you know david had a placing too his placement was to be king but he had to wait before he could actually become king and i got something to read about that in a second just just bear with me glory spiritual adoption i want you to get this so here's a point that i want to drive home may the holy spirit take it every heart of you believe us just because you are believers certainly have everlasting life god said so but would you want to just get in as job said by the skin of your teeth would you just want to come before the father and the talent that he's given every one of you and being negligent so all of y'all got a talent that god gave you are you negligent with your talent amen some of us watch to see what other folk going to do before we use our talents god might not have given uh them what he gave you so don't be negligent with what god gave you look amen as being negligent you just didn't uh you just didn't use it or you let something else stand in your way see you let little pretty things that meant nothing to you after all little fusses and stools and arguments and church differences take the meek you let church differences take the meekness and gentleness from your life you used to be a different person before your trial can i say it again you used to be a different person before your trial now because of that trial you let it take it out of you hallelujah watch this let church differences take the meekness and gentleness from your life see i was just you know um let me just stop there just for a second uh you know what has to happen is that uh if you ever uh like uh uh cooked you know and had a real nice meal uh but sometimes what you cook amen someone gets stuck to that pot praise the lord and um and you have to take that pot because sometimes you can cook and hey man you can practically just wipe the pot and it's clean but sometimes stuff gets stuck on the bottom of the pot hey man and the only way you're gonna get that out is you gotta let it soak come on son you gotta let it soak in some water the only way you can wipe that thing clean and get i mean and i'm talking about you got to wait while while it's soaking you just don't put it in water and expect it to do something you got to let it soak in there hallelujah and this is what i what i what i feel like sometimes we got to soak in the presence of god sometimes we get so hard we get so rough we get so rugged that we got to come into god's presence and just let him soak let the reign of his presence just rain on us and we soak in his presence it'll melt that hardness amen it'll change that cold heart those cold thoughts and everything it'll it'll it'll make the indifference it'll make you more lovable when we soak in his presence we need a soaking rain from god look at this he says it he says arguments and church differences take the meekness and gentleness from your life would you want to stand before the father like that i don't believe you would i don't believe that you would do it neither would i says how i want to how i want him to say it was well done not by the skin of my teeth but it was well done my good and faithful servant see be faithful while you waited amen enter to the joints of the lord for you did well with what you had to do maybe you're a housewife if you are god made you a teacher of your children do a good job out of it regardless of what you have to do do it well whatever you doing do it well god bless you with a job work well on that job amen notice then if the child did prove to be a real worthy of the things that the father had over his kingdom and had been a real faithful child then the tutor brought message to the father oh your son oh that's the message i want to bring uh for you and i owe your son his whole thoughts is upon you all he's trying to do is please you he's so interested in your and and your affair uh until it's hard to hold him down i'd rather be just a little overzealous about the father's kingdom than to have no zeal at all for it i'd rather overwork when it come to god look at this he says and as the church of christ preacher told me some time ago mr branham i'd rather wear out than rust out hallelujah somebody and i'm talking about when it come to working for the lord i would rather wear rot than rust out glory glory glory yeah i said that is a lot of truth i rather wear out and die in the harness as brother neville says than they refuse to have the harness on it says you can't do nothing any worse than the neglect to try let us let us do all we can with what we what what you have uh what you have to do with and the holy spirit our tutor will bring it to the father and now notice if the child become a gallant child then was told to the father and oh just i just love the word at an appointed time set by the father alone everything is in god's timing right amen at an appointed time set by the father alone the child was his glory and honor was manifested before the public the father taking care taking his own child under celebration took him into a public place being his own son born in his own house yet the sun was placed positionally in the family to inherit all things that the father had you see it amen now if we all behave some glorious day will fall heir to all the things god in his appointed day that he will judge all men by christ jesus the time will come when god will give out rewards for those who are faithful and the rejecting of those who fail to be faithful i want to tell you while you are waiting be faithful while you are waiting be committed while you're waiting be dedicated amen to the things of god and in the process watch your attitude watch your attitude so i was thinking on this i thought about david david also had to wait for the kingdom he had to wait for the throne he was pre-anointed uh but he had to wait and and and what i found david was still a faithful shepherd while waiting for the throne david was also a faithful musician while waiting for the throne david was a faithful warrior while waiting for the throne hallelujah he was fighting for the man that he was about to replace oh y'all don't get that he was fighting for the man that he was about to replace god already told him he was the next king but he didn't help god out by getting rid of saul he waited for god to take saul out and i'ma tell you something right now you cannot kill the souls that are in your life they have to die on their own praise the lord i was looking at this and i happened to just i got some little bible software called aluminum and i said let me let me just look up this word wait and i want to see what they say and and then illumina it brought out amen the story about david i said well that was exactly what my thought was so let me just read something that said david uh here in psalm 27 14 it says wait on the lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen our heart wait i say on the lord now they were given some notes on this and they said uh waiting creates time during which we can trust god david knew from experience so the reason he can write psalm 27 14. you can put that on the screen just leave that in the bottom of the screen just for a second uh it says uh dave david david can write this because he was writing from experience right david knew from experience what it meant to wait for the lord he had already been anointed the king at age 16. he was known a king at age 16 but he didn't become the king until he was 30 years old right so during the interim he was chased through the wilderness by a jealous king the very man that he's supposed to replace is chasing him through the wilderness my god look at it amen david had to wait on god for the fulfillment of his promise to reign as king now i want to also say this waiting waiting for god is not easy often it seems that he isn't answering our prayers or doesn't understand the urgency of our situation that kind of thinking implies that god is not in control or is not fair i'm going to psalms 40 you can take that down just get me ready at psalms 40. see when we're waiting on god it's not easy often times we think he's just not answering our prayer god heard your prayer as soon as you prayed it sometimes we think that god don't understand the urgency of the situation huh that's what you think that god don't understand god know he has an appointed time for it we think god don't understand the urgency of this i mean god i need this now amen i'm gonna tell you let god work it out he has a way of just giving you more than you ever imagined amen i remember we were looking for a house that took us a year to find the house that we wanted and uh we had found this one house and and say oh yeah this has got to be it this has got to be it and we went there and and and we had then we got the compromise on this got to compromise this ain't the house this thing we're doing all these compromises so then we found another house and like oh this is it this is it we put in our we put in our offer on the house the people never even responded to the offer and we were sitting there wondering like what in the world why won't they respond to the offer what's going on here why didn't why we were just our minds were just messed up so we're like lord maybe this ancient will then another house popped open and this one popped up and when it popped up um i mean i was willing to sacrifice on the other house because i loved it so much but there was one thing that i wanted in the house that that house didn't have it i wanted my i wanted an office and it didn't have it but god knew what i wanted but here i'm going i'm just i'm i'm compromising if i can say that with my thoughts because because i just like this house hallelujah but i told god i want an office so uh so another house pop these people never responded so another house pops up and and uh when it popped up i called a guy was for sale by owner i said i say huh hey does it does your house have this and does your house have that does your house have this does your house have that he said yes he said have you ever been here i say no sir i've never been there say but i've been to some of the other homes in the area and this is what i'm looking for says only one thing different about my house than the other ones that you saw you know that third car garage yeah i said yeah he said we converted that to an office i say oh glory i'm coming to see your house sir oh jesus and and and and just to go a little further just when we bought the house because we had another house that we needed to sell and when we bought the house we couldn't get our other house so we had trials with that i could just sit here and tell you it had a neighbor that had saw a person knocking on my door to buy my house that neighbor had a key to my house all they had to do was let him in to see it but the neighbor refused to let him see the neighbor say what y'all here for she said she uh as they said we want we saw the for sale sign we wanted to come in and see the house say oh they're not here they at church but my house is for sale took the people over the house showed it and they signed a contract right then never even opened up the door had a key to my house never even gave them the option to look at it god know how to do things so i had that house i couldn't sell it and i told a guy i'm doing a contingency on this it's based on me selling my house he said okay waited three months i could not get the house sold market was down at that time couldn't get it sold so the man came back to me and changed the contract he said i'll tell you what i do i give you ten thousand dollars to make make to make you six months of your house payments if you buy my house i said you're going to give me ten thousand dollars i say where we sign see how you wait on the lord and i wouldn't have got that if i would enter the other house god wanted to give me double-double glory to god and we learn how to wait watch this waiting for god is not easy oftentimes it seems that he's not answering our prayers or doesn't understand the urgency of our situation that kind of thinking implies that god is not in control or that god is not fair but i want to tell you something they said it and i'm going to say it god is worth waiting for hallelujah while you're waiting he uses that time to to refresh renew and teach you glory to god so make good use of your time your waiting time by discovering by discovering what god may be trying to teach you in the midst of waiting now here in psalms 40 verse 1 through 4. oh jesus i waited patiently for the lord he inclined unto me and heard my cry he brought me up also out of a horrible pit a pit out of the mire clay and set my feet upon a rock and establish my goings and he has put a new song in my mouth even praise them to our god many shall see it in fear and shall trust the lord blessed is the man that maketh the lord is truth trust and respect of not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies i say this and we're going to go back to verse one in a second waiting for god to help us is not easy but david discovered some key benefits from waiting we just read over them real quickly i want to go back to verse 1 and i want to show you these blessings because oftentimes uh you won't get these blessings until i mean often often blessings cannot be received unless we go through the trial of waiting so often times you won't get the blessing unless you've gone through the stage of waiting and here's the blessing i said bless verse one uh on that i waited patiently for the lord hallelujah and he inclined unto me and heard my cry that's the first blessing he inclined unto me and heard my cry that word incline means to stretch out or to turn to amen so when you say god incline that mean he turned to my situation i mean he heard me when i first prayed it and god turned to do something about it amen he stretched out his hand towards me come on somebody he inclined unto me and heard my cry the other thing here amen and the next verse says he brought me up also out of a horrible pit because sometimes when you're waiting you can get depressed hallelujah somebody sometimes you can get you know you can get a little despondent because god ain't moved when you thought he was gonna move but it's a it's a way that when he does move he lifts you up out of a horrible pit amen out of the maori clay praise god i love this that's the second thing the third thing is that amen the bible said he set my feet upon a rock what that means is that he gave you a revelation and when he spoke to you and gave you your personal revelation you start standing not in my clay but you were on a solid rock jesus glory to god and says he established my goings so when he put me on the rock then he establishes my goals as i meditate on this i thought about my daddy helping me establish my goals when i was first learning how to ride a bicycle amen uh if you know if you don't if you don't know how to keep the bicycle in balance you get on and you start rotting they have to give you training wheels glory to god and that way if you lean too far to the right you won't fall if you lead too far to the left then you won't fall hallelujah but but oftentimes that that rider when he first on the ride he's always leaning in one direction or the other oh hallelujah amen when we when we're learning to trust god and walk by faith sometimes we lean a little bit on our family members sometimes we lean a little bit on our friends we say if god don't come through then my friend gonna come through if god don't come through then my family gonna come through you gotta take them training wheels off amen stop leaning in this direction that direction get the bike balance amen with your own strength get the bike balanced and begin to ride that bike amen when you learn how to ride it without training wheels then god has established your goings glory to god and here's the last thing that happens when you learn how to wait the blessings that come from the trial of waiting the last thing that happens he puts a new song in your mouth and i now notice what david said he put it in my mouth not just in my heart because when god give you the song you're supposed to sing it he put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our god and know that they say many shall see y'all gonna hear what god did for me y'all gonna hear this and now not only are you gonna hear but the purpose of me sharing it is so that you can learn to fear god learn how to trust god know that he'll do the same thing for you many shall hear it many shall see it in fear and shall trust in the lord say i mean you don't know how your testimony helps somebody else when you're waiting you know we're we're helped by what abraham waited for we're helped by what uh noah waited for we're helped by what david waited for you know what i'm also helped by what you wait for glory to god let me read this quote here out of philadelphia church h hey jesus brother branham is referring to revelation 3 10. which which says because thou has kept the word of my patience this is a paragraph 3 12 3 it says because thou has kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth it says what does he mean by the word of his patience hebrews 6 13-15 for when god made promised abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing our blessing and multiplying i will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise you see the spirit is speaking about the word of god which is given to us to wait for the fulfillment of that word required patience even as it did in the case of abraham he endured as seeing him who was invisible he was patient and the word finally was fulfilled this is the way god teaches his people patience says why if he fulfilled his word and physical manifestations the very instant you prayed you would never learn patience that means god could have did what you asked him to do a long time ago but the reason he has not done he's waiting for his appointed time during that he's giving you a man character glory to god you're developing character glory it says uh you would never learn patience but would become even more impatient with life let me now show you this truth even more fully set forth hebrews 11 17 by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he that had received the promises the word of god offered up his only begotten son he says there it is abraham was tried after he received the word of promise most think that as soon as we pray in jesus name over the good promises of god there could not be a trial but here it says that abraham was tried after he received the promise that is exactly correct according to the psalmist referring to joseph in psalms 105 19 he says until the time that his word came the word of the lord tried him blessed be his name it said god gives us exceeding great and precious promises he has promised to fulfill them he will i want to tell you all that right now god ain't hurt god and forgot about your prayer god heard your prayer he he gave you a promise and he will fulfill it he will but from the time we pray until the time we give the answer we must learn to receive patience into our souls for only impatience do we possess life you know often times when we're waiting you know often times we stop praying why are we waiting you know we we we get to a point where we're not we're not even talking to god about it no more hallelujah we don't we don't forgot you know well the lord didn't do it in my time so i'm not going to say i'm not going to do nothing your faith ought to get stronger not weaker while you're waiting your faith is supposed to get stronger your actions should get stronger not weaker now don't wait to you receive what you're going to get to start praising god then amen you need to be in that in that channel right now god i'm gonna worship you now i'm gonna be in prayer right now about this i'm not waiting for the manifestation hallelujah glory to god god want to see are you committed you're gonna remain faithful in your waiting states are you still gonna you know still do what he what he called you to do hallelujah amen well lord you ain't done nothing for me yet i was i was coming to prayer because i was thinking that you no no no no i'ma tell you something right now when you're approaching it that way what you actually just showed god is that you didn't really want a relationship with him you just want to use him all right you just want to use god for whatever you have need of god i'm gonna call you up when i have a need god want a relationship praise the lord amen so when when things going good you still should be in prayer when things are going bad you still should be in prayer nothing should stop you from your prayer time and and just having having time committed to the lord amen people change as their situation change right you know like yeah if i ain't going through nothing i'm ready i mean i'll do this but when i start going through i'm going to do something else actually typically when they start going through that's when desperation kick in desperation i mean you're just ready you lord i fast for you lord but as soon as you get as soon as that burden get uplifted you don't stop your fasting you don't stop you're praying and stopped everything god don't want that kind of relationship hallelujah glory to god amen what what what what man would want to be married to a woman she she only cooked when she get presents praise the lord i mean that's that's a woman that don't love him hey man but when he had a hard day and and everything she's trying to set the atmosphere in the house here's your dinner honey she might give him his best meal when she ain't got no present the thing that he really enjoy eating i'm gonna make sure you got that when it when he when he when he when it when he ain't brought nothing home no flowers or nothing i look god don't we shouldn't be just motivated to serve god based on what he gives us he gave us enough when he went to the cross hallelujah church amen but i i mean the the the we got to keep praying church got to stay on our knees got to keep doing everything we can just serving god no matter what the situation while we wait and be faithful look at this look at this i'm finishing this up here it says god gives us exceeding great and precious promises he has promised to fulfill them he will amen but from the time we pray until the time we get the answer we must learn to receive patience into our souls for only impatience do we possess life he goes on to say this may god help us to learn this lesson even as we know the people of the six age learn patience we read the history of the lives of these great christians what a contrast we see between their lives and hours for they were so patient and quiet and today we are all but overcome in uh and over impatience and haste we got to learn to just wait on the lords we gotta learn to just wait on the lord i want to finish by just telling the story uh as believers we are waiting on the second coming of the lord and since we're waiting we're gonna be faithful a god gonna find us a man uh uh busy about his work like like i said i'd rather i rather uh wear out than rust out right i'd rather be overzealous for the things of god and sometimes i get so tired and and i don't know why i mean i i know the the the people that lived in in uh years before us man they used to do so much more for the lord they prayed more than we pray they fasted more than we fast they had more services than what we have i mean they did so much for the lord but and now just seeing like we just tired after one service can't take no more than one servant right but i you know but but but here here um you know the thing is we're just gonna you know we we know we're waiting on the second coming lord and we just gotta remain faithful no matter what it is no matter how the devil tries us we're gonna remain faithful and i thought about this story that brother branham told about this uh young lady she was the niece of a man that owned a great ranch i believe out in colorado and uh and her parents had died and and she was the niece since she went out there and this man had five daughters uh she was a niece and you know they pretty much just treated her like like denise uh there was a time where these daughters heard that this this great businessman from chicago was on the way to colorado and he was bringing his his son who was uh you know the young man had not been married he was a bachelor eligible bachelor and they heard they heard that he was coming so the girls began to have conversations amongst themselves about oh i'm going to marry him and it's going to be this we're going to have this many kids and we're going to have this kind of life we're going to do this and the other girl said no i'm going to marry him and we're going to do this we gonna do that oh no you too young i'm dumb man they just talking about all the things that they was gonna do so they began to prepare themselves for a man this this boy coming they were gonna set up a a little party amen and invite this boy amen to just be there and and they they didn't realize it but the boy was actually coming looking for a wife hallelujah they never included the the lump the young the younger uh niece or the cousin in in their plans but the five sisters got themselves together bought their best dresses they went to the party trying to get the boys attention hallelujah but the boys walked into the house and he looked at the lady and said you know i didn't want these ladies out here looking like the ladies in chicago i want somebody to look a little different a little homely amen that that you know just not trying to impress me but somebody's going to be a good wife and somebody's going to be a good mother to my children so i don't want one that looks like she's she gonna run from club to club i need somebody that's gonna be a woman of character he said i'm looking for somebody like that so he was looking around and said these girls have disappointed me these five i mean they're disappointed he slipped out the house and just went out to the back maybe back there praying a little bit like lord i came looking for a wife and i can't find nobody and while he's in the back he sees this other young lady walking out to go with this water to empty the dishwater and uh she's not dressed she's not dressed uh amen impressed or anything like that but she said he said he sees the walking dead and brother brandon said he kind of got himself in her path as she was coming back with the pail of this i mean the pail that had the water in it it said you say uh excuse me she she said she said oh oh i'm i'm sorry i i didn't mean to be out here and my intruder and respect he said no no no i want to just talk to you say what's your name and uh she gave the name and she had the same last name as the other girls he said are you a sister say oh no i'm not a sister i'm a cousin and my my parents passed away so i came here to live with this family and you know i just i'm just here doing my work and say you know did you know that i'm here looking for a wife you say she said yeah we we kind of thought that that would be the case say you know i think i found the one i was looking for say oh i'm glad you got one of my cause no i'm not looking at your cousins i'm looking at you she's saying me she said she said no i'm not worthy that you would look at me look at the way i'm dressed and say i don't care about the way you're dressed but i'm looking at your character hallelujah say you're the one that i came out looking for he says but the thing there it is i'm gonna go away and i'm gonna be back for you but you're gonna have to wait but you gotta make preparation while you're waiting it says i'm coming back at a certain time of the year i'm gonna be back and you got to be ready when i come and the lady she she heard his promise he walked away and she went in and told the cousins what he said and they said you you you the one that you you think he chose you said yeah yeah he he told me that i'm gonna be his wife well you ain't got this so you ain't got that he said well it didn't matter and i didn't have it because he gonna give me all of that he's gonna take care of that for me he said say he say uh she say hi hi hi you you only make so much money how you gonna get addressed say i don't know but but i'ma just be prepared for the day that he come she began to save her money gotta dress together and brother branham say every day during a certain season she would put on the dress and she would walk out to the gate waiting for him to come one day would go by and the next day go by she done went through the process and he never came but she was faithful while she waited she was committed while she waited she kept the right attitude while she waited and finally one day after after going through all the criticism of the cousins that we told you he wasn't gonna come he's just like any other man he didn't got your hopes all up and now he dropping you she said no he told me that he gonna come and i believe what he said and maybe one day as the sun is going down she sees some some some horses galloping a man and a big cart a man coming across the hill she said i told y'all he was coming for me and here he come and say he said he said uh i'm here we're gonna get married i told you that i was coming she said she said i didn't know what was happening he said he said dear i had a man stationed here watching your behavior watching your actions watching your commitment watching everything that you was doing i had him here and he was reporting that back to me i couldn't let you down i had to get here for you he said not only that i brought a preacher with me and we're gonna get married right here in front of your cousins i'm gonna prove that i love you and the reason she was able to get married is because she was prepared while she was waiting i'm gonna tell you something when that lady left at home that day i guarantee she had herself a new song i i guarantee a man that uh all those i mean that she said she could probably say the same thing david said he inclined unto me and heard my cry he brought me up out of a horrible pit out of the mirror clay he set my feet upon a rock he's established my goings and he's put a new song in my mouth and i don't care what nobody say i'm gonna praise him because of what he's done for me he might not have done it for you but he's done it for me and he's worthy of my praise god bless you church god bless you glory to god amen musicians come let's have a word of prayer oh god lord help us to wait wait for the appointed time
