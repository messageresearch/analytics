[12:46] I I believe as
[12:48] Christians sometimes we're always always
[12:52] on the defensive all right today we want
[12:54] to go on the offensive right we want to
[12:57] go into the enms camp yes and take that
[13:00] which he stole from us we are children
[13:03] of God who are destined to go to heaven
[13:06] all right one of these days when we are
[13:08] seated in heaven we will be asked by
[13:11] Brother Paul can we share your testimony
[13:14] all right what are we going to say if we
[13:16] don't have testimonies my brother my
[13:18] sister all right the only way we can
[13:20] have a testimony is to go on the
[13:22] offensive go into the enemy's Camp don't
[13:25] be afraid of the devil the devil is just
[13:28] a dog without any teeth Hallelujah he's
[13:32] just like thunder without
[13:35] lightning and we are here to tell and
[13:37] declare to him that tonight another
[13:40] night a different night all together
[13:44] praise be to God I am going to my
[13:46] message that I have is some kind of a
[13:48] message that is going to invoke mothers
[13:52] all right Hallelujah why am I saying so
[13:55] because the devil has found a place and
[13:59] little group that he can disturb so that
[14:02] they cannot hold on to this message and
[14:05] that little group is none other than our
[14:07] youths our children these are the
[14:10] Ministers of tomorrow if the Lord
[14:12] carries Hallelujah these are the deacons
[14:15] of tomorrow if the Lord teres these are
[14:19] the trustees of tomorrow if the Lord
[14:21] teres but he has targeted our children
[14:24] and we are want to adopt a stance like
[14:27] Moses did said not even a wolf is going
[14:31] to remain behind Hallelujah we will go
[14:34] with our young ones we will go with our
[14:36] old ones my brother my sister no matter

[15:14] God my Bible says therefore I say unto
[15:19] you we want us to read between the
[15:22] lines therefore I say unto you what
[15:26] things soever you desire
[15:29] When you pray believe that you have
[15:33] received them and you shall have
[15:37] them the equation is very simple let me
[15:41] just pray before I go on precious father
[15:44] we thank you this even for your grace
[15:45] and mercy we appreciate you Lord for
[15:48] bringing all the saints into this house
[15:50] oh God to commune with you not to listen

[16:15] amongst us I invite you Lord God
[16:17] Almighty to come and circumcise the lips
[16:19] of the the the the hearer and the lips

[16:24] desk oh dear God lord may we feel your
[16:27] presence at the end of the day and when
[16:28] we be like clas of old who said was it
[16:31] not good to be in the house of God as he
[16:34] spake unto us we give you glory we give
[16:36] you everything in the wonderful name of
[16:39] our Lord Jesus Christ we pray and

[16:59] you shall have them the equation is not
[17:02] complete when you only
[17:05] desire you have to take another step
[17:08] right of praying for your desire all
[17:11] right and when you have prayed for your
[17:13] desire it's not time to relax my brother

[17:32] we have this tonight you might be having
[17:35] plenty of desires they are covered in
[17:37] this scripture the more you have the
[17:40] more God likes it because God says our
[17:43] Prophet teaches us that when you ask for
[17:46] anything ask big don't ask for small
[17:49] things which will make people doubt to
[17:52] say is this God or not God wants people
[17:55] to be convinced beyond measure and
[17:58] realize that that whenever he gives you
[18:01] something even the world must come to a
[18:03] stand still GL

[18:34] business and prove beyond measure all
[18:37] these Philistines out there they must
[18:39] realize that I'm a Child of God because
[18:43] the word says we shall never be taals
[18:46] but heads God hallelujah hallelujah I
[18:51] want a little bit of noise my brother my
[18:52] sister don't wear that long face my
[18:55] brother my sister you have come to the

[20:18] have this I want to have that and I want
[20:20] to have this I want to have that once
[20:23] you start to desire then when you kneel
[20:25] down my brother my sister God is bound
[20:28] to answer you because God is not a man
[20:31] who can lie neither the son of a man who
[20:33] can repent what he said you make it come
[20:36] to pass yes am it's his word that's
[20:40] right amen praise God when I'm put in

[20:58] be a Christian it's your duty to look
[21:02] after me I Feast on your word day and

[21:50] sister pandemonium takes place Doom
[21:53] devil they start to run Hallelujah no
[21:57] matter how many times how many days your
[22:00] prayer has been held up there remember
[22:03] Daniel himself he prayed for 21 days but
[22:07] his prayer was being held by the Prince
[22:09] of Persia until God said let me go and
[22:13] relieve my son then he said to him in
[22:16] Daniel chap 12:1 he said the moment you
[22:20] started to believe and pray I was with
[22:23] you
[22:26] yes you must have been praying some my
[22:28] brother the angels have been watching
[22:31] over you God was looking at you God was
[22:35] looking and weighing your desire my
[22:37] brother my sister this is the time to
[22:39] make exploitation amen there's no time
[22:43] any other time that we're going to
[22:44] exploit other than in this age when we
[22:48] go to Heaven There is no more about
[22:50] preaching the word it is only about
[22:53] singing and rejoicing not even in the
[22:57] Millennium Hallelujah
[22:59] my God hallelujah Glory oh praise be to
[23:02] God my my my my my my my my my
[23:06] Hallelujah my brother brother Branham
[23:08] says the church has got power to shake
[23:12] this
[23:13] world and he says he has
[23:16] invested he says God has
[23:19] invested his power in his word that's
[23:23] right that's right when he has invested
[23:25] his power in his word he needs some
[23:28] people who believes the word who can be
[23:31] the chief speaker who can use their
[23:33] mouth to release that power within the
[23:37] word if that power remains dominant my
[23:40] brother my sister we will be like slaves
[23:43] oh my
[23:45] Hallelujah faith without works is dead
[23:48] Paul even goes on to say we are
[23:50] justified by our works all right
[23:53] hallelujah amen if you have not
[23:56] exploited something along those those
[23:58] lines then there's something wrong
[24:00] something is lacking my brother my
[24:01] sister oh praise be to God hallelujah
[24:05] and I did not have that scripture let me
[24:07] just read it to you I want to justify
[24:11] the scripture that goes hand in hand
[24:13] with this scripture that I have read in
[24:17] in uh 1 John 5 verse1 15 it says and if
[24:22] we know that he hears us right
[24:25] whatsoever we ask we know that we the
[24:29] petitions that we desired of him thank
[24:32] Jesus there we are thank you Jesus
[24:34] Hallelujah yes hallelujah amen tonight
[24:38] I'm going to speak about the impact of a
[24:43] desire the impact of a
[24:46] desire where are you
[24:49] mothers I said I'll be speaking much
[24:51] about the mothers today because these
[24:54] mothers are the one who carried N9
[24:56] months of the babies they know all the
[24:59] groanings and all the pains and now the
[25:02] devil has targeted our youths to destroy
[25:05] us once he destroys our youth we have
[25:08] got no future my brother my sister we
[25:10] are gr go getting old now the gray hairs
[25:14] are now mushrooming and now we need a
[25:16] cop of people who can stand in a Kimo
[25:19] and say devil you have come this way you
[25:22] can never cross this line anymore we are
[25:24] here to discomfit you and defeat you
[25:28] amen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah you
[25:32] know the power that you have my brother
[25:34] my sisters and so the prophet in the
[25:37] message he was to pass that way he says
[25:40] and so a good Praying Wife or a mother I
[25:45] have mothers in
[25:47] here I have good praying wives in here
[25:51] hallelujah it says can do more for the
[25:54] kingdom of God on your knees at home all
[25:58] right you don't need to come here my S
[26:00] my my sisters even at home when you
[26:03] kneel down you are damaging the the the
[26:06] the the kingdom of the devil God
[26:09] hallelujah he said can do more for the
[26:11] kingdom of God on her knees at home than
[26:14] sometimes the preacher can do on the
[26:16] platform that's
[26:19] right Hallelujah this is the power that
[26:23] God has invested in you my sisters this
[26:25] is the power that you need to exercise
[26:28] yes when you see s something is not
[26:30] going on all right in the homes you are
[26:33] the first ones to notice God I don't
[26:36] think my daughter is walking right I
[26:39] don't think my son is walking right
[26:41] there's something there's a connection
[26:43] between you and the
[26:44] children then you start to say okay
[26:47] devil I've seen you and I've recognized

[44:38] you know me within and without if I'm
[44:42] wrong don't give me anything that I'm
[44:43] asking for and he would raise his arms

[46:05] can be defeated they say in English
[46:08] charity begins at home if you do right
[46:11] at your respective homes you bring in a
[46:14] good spirit in the home in the house of
[46:16] God the pastor won't even struggle to
[46:20] minister the word of God by just song
[46:23] service Alone song service alone you
[46:27] will say let's pick our bags and go home
[46:29] because the job has already been done

[46:35] saying let's have a spirit of
[46:36] togetherness let's have love for one

[46:42] of empathy where if at all something
[46:46] wants to go to Sister Shar there you
[46:48] must jump inside and say before you go
[46:51] to Sister sharing you have got to pass
[46:53] through me first that is what we call
[46:56] laugh what brought the holy ghost in the
[46:58] upper room it was
[47:00] Oneness Hallelujah they waited for one
[47:04] day the Holy Ghost did not come waited

[47:16] it to another sister from there before
[47:19] the juice went out she gave it to
[47:21] another one there was Oneness there was
[47:24] Oneness no one thought this one is a
[47:27] disease or what there was equal sharing
[47:30] and when the Holy Ghost saw that he said
[47:33] I can now go down and he proved it by
[47:36] the way when he came in the Bible says
[47:40] even the cracks of the building they
[47:43] were filled with the power of the Holy
[47:45] Ghost why because of Oneness why because
[47:48] of unity until people started to speak
[47:52] in tongues Hallelujah and when they
[47:55] spoke in tongues and lady stood up and
[47:57] say oh brother ja daff by this time in

[1:31:52] encouraged by what we heard Lord the the
[1:31:56] scripture tells whatsoever we desire and
[1:32:00] I know that there are many desires that
[1:32:02] went forth tonight as they heard as we
[1:32:04] heard the word of God and um God I know
[1:32:07] that you have granted each and every one
[1:32:09] of them you don't send a minister here
[1:32:11] just to share something you don't play
[1:32:13] with your word God you're you you you
[1:32:16] you are um more concerned about
[1:32:19] manifesting your word to us than we are
[1:32:23] in and looking for it you you want to
[1:32:25] make sure that we get it as any father
[1:32:28] would do for his children it goes out of
[1:32:31] his way to try to make sure those kids
[1:32:32] get everything that they desire Lord
[1:32:35] that's the way you feel about us and we
[1:32:36] thank you uh for that it has to start
[1:32:39] with a desire and from that we pray and
[1:32:42] then we receive what we have prayed for
[1:32:45] and God there's a certain order to this
[1:32:47] so God we are leaving here we've prayed
[1:32:49] about that we we've expressed our
[1:32:51] desires we've prayed about it now father
