to live in where where time is blending in with eternity Lord and Lord how our hearts just long to be with you for eternity Lord but Lord right now you've called us on this Earth Lord to live a life above sin Lord may you just bless this night Lord may you speak to our hearts Lord may you move me so out the way that the people hear from you and only you Lord may you take preeminence Lord of of your house of your service of your word Lord and just have your way with our hearts Lord and Lord we're just looking And depending upon you for Revelation tonight Lord because you are the great rator Lord and father we thank you for letting us be here once again Lord knowing Lord that you've made it safely for us to be here Lord God Just Have Your Way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen we're opening scripture will be in uh Psalms 46 verses 1- 11 very familiar scriptures in the Bible and so say Amen when you get there let me just see something real quick just bother me little bit all right so uh says the Bible says God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will we not fear though the Earth be removed and the mountains be carried to the midst of the sea it's more though the waters therefore Roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof silah there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high God God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved amen God shall help her and that right and early the Heathen raged and the kingdoms were moved he uttered he uttered his voice the Earth melted the Lord of host is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge Salah think about that come and behold the works of the Lord what desolations that he made in the earth he maketh Wars to cease unto the end of the Earth he breakthe bow he cutteth the spear in a sun he burneth The Chariot in the fire verse 10 be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen I'll be exalted in the Earth the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge Salah so I look the word up refuge in the old Webster's Dictionary and the Bible and it says shelter or protection from danger or distress that which shelters or protects from danger distress or Calamity so if all these things going in our life that is trying to bring us down it's trying to take our eyes away from this Refuge that we have you may be seated you may be seated so we have this Refuge that is accessible at all times of the day no matter if you wake up at 3:00 in the morning no matter if it's 10:00 at night that Refuge is accessible and a lot of times I think we forfeit The Refuge that we have in Christ Jesus and so I love the Bible said he is our refuge and strength a very present help in the time of trouble you don't have to just wait for trouble to get inside the Refuge he's he's available at all times amen so I want you to notice that Refuge is is mentioned three times in Psalms 46 right there three times and what is three Perfection Perfection amen and uh so David is trying to tell us that God is your personal Refuge not only David's refuge in the Old Testament but he's your Refuge today because the Bible says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so if he's a refuge back in that time he's a refuge in this time as well and so I remember uh some years ago I was over a friend's house and he had this uh this uh picture of what be still really meant cuz people think be still is just you're still but this is what it means in the Hebrew so be still and know that I am God the original Hebrew root be still doesn't mean be quiet it means let go think about that a lot of times we don't let go in a situation we're not being still in a situation because we want to have control in the situation because we're scared to let we're scared to see what the outcome will be so he says um let go that's a very different don't you think and you know that I am God let go of trying to control your spouse let go of your worry about your finances let go of your unforgiveness let go of your past let go what you cannot control and rest in the knowledge that God is in control so that's what be still really means is to let go like that song let go and let God have his wonderful way amen and now let's let's go to Psalms 91 now amen and read verse we'll start with verse one so it says the Lord that has been our Dwelling Place in all generations so think about that he is your Dwelling Place he was a dwelling place for Abraham for Moses for Jeremiah but now he's your dwelling place as well and we'll go to Proverbs 18:10 this is another good one I love it's another very familiar one it says the name of the Lord is a strong tower I'm going read that again the name of the Lord is a strong tower and what the righteous runneth into it and is safe see the bride in this day and age in every age she had this righteousness she had this uh this tower that she can run into but a lot of times we fail to run into the tower because we let life dis engulf us but don't let life engulf you but let the Lord engulf you amen because he's your peace he he's your everything he's your life without him we would have nothing amen so let's keep going let's go to uh verse um let's go back to Psalms 90 let's go to Psalms 91 now this is a very good Psalm right here I think it's something that it fits this day and age so 91:1 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty that's what we need to be dwelling day and night verse two I will say of the Lord he is look look at word again my refuge and my Fortress and and the word uh Fortress is any fortified place a fort a castle a stronghold a place of defense or security there's more the English have a strong fortress on the rock of jalter or the rock that is a fortress defense safety security you can't be safe and protected if you live outside that Fortress so back in the day when they lived in those type of things they they lived in there to have protection and safety but the type of Fortress that we have no man can destroy it no man can pick it apart there's no atomic bomb that can blow it up it's always and forever will be Eternal and it's a place that we need to abide in Daily because a lot of times we go through unnecessary stress that God doesn't want us to go through because we're not in that Fortress we're not fortified away in Christ Jesus let's keep going I will save the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress I always said this before look at that word he says my my is so important you got to experience that for yourself my God in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the nonsense of the pestilence he shall cover thee talking to you right now he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings Thou shalt trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flyth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in the darkness for the destruction that wasteth at noon day A thousand shall fall at thy side and 10,000 at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh to thee only with thy eyes Thou shalt behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou Hast made the Lord which is what my refuge even the most high thy habitation look at that there shall no evil Beall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou Dash thy uh foot against the stone Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder the Young Lion and the dragon shall thou trample under the feet because he has set his look it says because he has set his love upon me we got to set our love upon the C our lord Jesus we got to we live in a day and age where where love is just it's not there anymore but we got to cling that much closer to Christ because we need the love of Christ ring radiating outside of us because he set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him I will set him on high because he has known my name he shall call upon me and I will answer and I will be with him in trouble same thing it says in Psalms 46:1 I will deliver him and honor him with long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation now the word Shield means to cover as with a shield to cover from danger to defend to protect to secure from assault and we look uh last week we were talking about uh in the book of PS Book of Psalms the book of Ephesians how you have the shield of Faith The Shield of faith is important because it it quenches the fiery darts of the enemy so a shield is very important in an armor set and we got to make sure that we take the shield of Faith every day we need every piece of the armor of God that he's given us we can't leave one thing away and I I I want to say this statement right here the word refuge is used 85 times in the Book of Psalms think about that the Lord is trying to bring something to our attention that he is our refuge we don't have to go through this life alone trying to trying to struggle and find everything out ourselves but there's a refuge that we can go to any time of place but we have to be willing to to um humble ourselves and get into that admit when you're wrong sometimes you're not always right all the time and I I can I can attest to that because I used to have that mentality a lot that I know everything and life hits you sometimes and show you don't know everything let's go to Luke 16 so I I believe the day the day and age we're living in we got to be still we got to be willing to let go uh because God is trying to do something in our lives right now uh the Lord lord gave uh Pastor Jack uh restoration for a reason and God can't restore you if you're not willing to let go of the things that you need to let go see we hinder our blessings because we're not willing to let go we want to hold on to the driver's will but not let God get control so 16:16 it says the law and the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it so you got to press into the kingdom of God and another rendition it says um uh talks about how that uh the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence and the violent take it by force so we got to take our walk by force because we're going against a worthy adversary see you you can't underestimate what the devil can do see that's why the thing is you can't outsmart him with worldly wisdom you got to outsmart him by surrendering to God cuz that's the only thing that can ever defeat the Devil is is God God in his word Jesus showed us how to defeat the Devil not by intellect not by reasoning against him you look one thing Jesus did not reason with the devil not one time he said it is written thou offense get behind me he didn't get the devil no time of day but we get the devil a time a day we said man the devil puts a thought then we start pondering it pondering it then it becomes a manifestation and that's what the devil wants you to do that's where his traps he sets you he wants you to reason just like with Eve in the Garden of Eden if she would just stay if she would just stayed upon the word she never would have fail but what she did was she reason and say whoo that sounds good I've never heard that before but but God spoke already and she didn't follow it same thing in our life anytime that we go through something unnecessarily we have to go away from the word of God in order to fall so amen amen keep goinging I'm read a quote now so I I remember this quote years ago but it's so powerful and I think it's so it's so uh beautiful for the word the lord gave us restoration you just put one or two good members in the church that's really on fire for God it'll do something for that church more than than 40 revivals could I'm read that quote again I don't think you guys heard it you just put one or two good members in a church that's really on fire for God it'll do something for that church more than 40 revivals you could have think about that think about 40 revivals but Revival should be happen in our life every day we should be getting up and being revived in God because he's think about this the message of the hour has been revealed to us we have all the truth revealed to us the Bible's been open we should be the happiest people in the world in fact we should be the desper people in the world because the Bible says the Bride haath made herself ready also says the the bride will be out spot or wrinkle so in order for the bride to make herself ready she has to be desperate for restoration because what is God trying to restore us back to from the beginning see we got to catch the vision of restoration it's not just knowing about restoration but it's about catching the vision that God has for our church we we got to step into that Vision not not just knowing about but you got to step into that Vision that God has given to us just let just let him find one sincere heart that he can get into he will come any time any hour of the night I'm so thankful that we have a doctor that will come anytime oh I'm so happy to know for that to know he's my refuge and my strength the very present help in the time of trouble amen now the Lord is our refuge and strength a very present help in the time of trouble and the Redemptive names Shema the Lord is present so I want you to tell this right now the Lord is present right now in your situation you may not want to believe it or say oh I'm I'm in the toughest predicament in my life but the Lord is right there present in your situation you got to claim it by faith you got to believe it and he's going to show up time and time and time again time and time and time again amen so the Lord is present now Jehovah Gyra will provide so he's he's providing and he's present he's going to provide every need that you have need of not not your wants but your needs so Jehovah Jehovah the provider is present I love that Jehovah the provider is present you get what I mean if he's the Lord if if he's the Lord's provided sacrifice that he's got to be the Lord God present in that time of help now see what I mean now if here tonight if he's here tonight to save everybody from sin he's got to be present to tonight to fulfill the rest of the Redemptive names you believe that he's Jehovah Gyra Jehovah RFI Jehovah our provided sacrifice our healer our Banner our peace Our Shepherd our righteousness and his presence he's got to be all that right now the last thing so think about all those things we just said just now he's all those things to you personally amen often the the peace that we forfeit because we don't realize what Jehovah God really is to us I I think that's why brother Bram said we live uh we live a million miles below our privilege because we don't recognize what we have in God we have everything that we need we have to go venture out for no anything else no no therapists no counselors none of that stuff you have a mighty counsel right here I'm not I'm not saying you can't go to a counsel I'm not saying that but a lot of times we we like to lean on a crutch on a counsel or crutch on something else in our life but lean upon God lean on his Everlasting Arms he's not going to change not one time he can't fail you he won't fail you he's never lost a battle amen amen amen so I remember I was listening to this message today the seven compound names Jehovah and brother Brandon was um with his wife and his son Billy I believe and uh he went hunting on his trip and it was storming and uh he thought himself he's a good Woodsman and everything and he thought you know he's pretty he's kind of thinking kind of highly of himself and then sometimes God will put us in situations where it makes us really realize that we're not as good as we think we are and it kind of humbled brother Brandon cuz he was lost he was worried about his kids you know like his wife and kid being alone and and suffering and so so God was was whispering this thing into his ear I'll read it so I kept hearing something whispering in my ear the Lord is our refuge and strength a very present help in the time of trouble now I'm getting franked frantic I started walking on something said the Lord is our refuge and a help a very present help in the time of trouble I just kept on walking it got louder the Lord is our refuge and strength a very present help in the time of trouble I kept moving and dragging my gun along I was so tired then you know the Lord is our refuge and strength that was Jehovah shemma talking to me think about that the Lord is reminding you who he is in the situation see sometimes we forget who God is in our our situation we get so so bound so bogged so stressed uh our boss is just this just riding on us and everything our wife's yelling us our husband's yelling whatever it is the kids acting crazy and we forget who God is in that situation and each Redemptive name is for a certain situation because you always don't need healing in every situation but you need peace in some situations so we got to recognize that God isn't just this one thing God's Not In The Box I'll tell you that God is omnipresent he's everywhere you got to believe that he's everywhere in every part of your life you got to believe that amen amen so now let's go to I want to talk about some of the Redemptive names now so amen so we'll go first Jehovah Gyra so that was first mentioned uh when Abraham was to sacrifice Isaac so Jehovah Gyra the Lord will provide so he'll provide bills he'll provide restoration the most thing he the most thing the Lord wants to provide in your life is restoration of your soul that's the most important thing cuz you can get brand new cars your bills can be paid but the most important thing God is looking for is your soul to be restored he wants to reconcile you so you can go reconcile somebody else see God wants to see that restoration inside of you so he can use you to show somebody how important rest restoration is just like the wel Revival they said where's the wel Revival I'm the wel Revival they got to look at it like that CU God wants to use you in a certain way but if you're not restored in the proper way how can he use you to your full potential right and then we got Jehovah Rafi the Lord that Health all thy diseases it doesn't matter what what demon they call it or what name they call it the Lord can heal that disease he can use doctors to help aid it or he can heal you just like that whatever the Lord but you got to believe that your healing lies in God your healing doesn't lie in what the doctor can do but your healing lies in what God can do cuz he promised to heal you so I I put a scripture with that too and he said if thou will diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God and will do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to his Commandments and keep all his statutes I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord that Health thee that's right even said he sent your word and he heal your disease and then we got another Redemptive name Jehovah Shalom I think in a day and age where Satan is running so rampant he's trying to get our eyes off of Peace he doesn't want you to have peace he wants you to have headaches he wants you to have worry he wants you to have arguments he wants if you look at what Satan is trying to do he's trying to take uh the the the perfect image of a family of a man and a wife and the proper like that Christ man and woman he's trying to reverse it and put woman and man he's trying to get the woman to be the provider of the house he's trying to get the woman to do everything that the man's trying to do but God didn't create a woman to do a man's job he created a woman to do everything a man can't do and a man do everything a woman can't do and that's how a family supposed to mesh together I'll say in the statement yesterday I believe that in a household I believe uh the backbone of a family is the prayers of a wife I believe it because the man go out there and he's doing all the things getting to certain spirits and all these things and she's staying home and praying for the f I believe it's that backbone I believe a wife a Godly wife is so important brother Bram said this statement he said that outside of Salvation is a wife I I believe that outside the greatest thing God can give you out of Salvation is a wife and I believe that a wife is helps you anchors you and if if a man is staying in the right position in his uh called position then the wife is going to fall right in line see we as in as men we got to fall in line with the word we can't go say well I'm the boss of the house I I got the authority no it doesn't work that way you got to fall in line cuz the Bible says it's not my notes but let's go to Ephesians it says I love this right here it says verse 21 Ephesians 5:21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God wives submitting yourself unto your own husbands as unto the Lord see sometimes the husbands will stop right there but it's a little bit more after that says for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything look what it says right here verse 25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it Christ doesn't go around and tell you how much Authority he has over you he doesn't so as as husbands of the household we got to lead by example I know I'm not a husband yet but one day I will be I believe it by faith amen so you got to love your wives even as Christ also loved you so in order to know that you got to fall deeper in love with Christ the love of Christ has to be radiating outside of you and so I think that's so important because the devil is is constantly trying to dismantle familyhood that's it and that's how he starts in the homes that's why you have all this social immorality people don't want to get married anymore divorces happen because they're marrying for the wrong things you don't marry somebody because they look good but you marry somebody what's inside of them and the the most important thing that has to be inside of him is himself seal with the Holy Ghost that's the most I don't care how good they look how good a person now they have the most important thing is what's inside because when when Beauty Fades what's left what do you got left amen amen let's keep going so now he said Jehovah Shalom our peace so think about that our peace he said I leave peace with you that passes all understanding he say if you keep your mind stay on him he'll keep you in perfect peace notice that word perfect peace not temporary peace but perfect peace so the the when it first mentioned uh then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord and called it Jehovah Shalom and unto this day yet an ofer of the aites judges 6:24 so Jehovah our peace just think about that no matter what situation you're going in no matter what's going on you can lose your job you can still be in peace You Can Be You Can Be months behind your bills and still have that peace because to me peace isn't based upon circumstances just like just like Joy isn't based upon circumstances only thing is based upon circumstances is happiness but joy joy doesn't look at the circumstances peace doesn't look at the circumstances peace and joy look at God because it says the joy of the Lord is my strength so notice that my strength now we got Jehovah nii the Lord our Banner think about that and Moses built an altar and called the name of Jehovah nii unto this day yet in ofra that's Exodus 17:15 and we got Jehovah Ro the Lord my shepherd now I love this scripture right here the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want let's go to Psalms 23 see a lot of times we we're always wanting for something the wrong thing and we got to be careful what we're setting Our Eyes Upon Our Pastor brother Jack was talking about a couple weeks ago how you got to be careful in the things that you watch because they can make you want things that are outside of God's perfect will for himself time you got to be careful what you're watching because they can make you want things that are outside of perfect of God's perfect will so we got to be careful the things that we're feeding upon us a black dog and a white dog inside of all of us you can either feed the white dog or the black dog the white dog is your spiritual man the black dog is your carnal man now whatever you feed out the most is going to be what comes out on top now I'm not saying you can't watch TV I'm not saying you can't play games I'm not saying all that what I'm saying is watch what you're watching and watch what you're playing cuz they can bring Spirits into your home and and spirits come on you just like our Pastor said so verse 23:1 it says the Lord is my shepherd notice that personal again my I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside look at that word Still Waters he restoreth my soul when I'm reading this I think of Peace that's the first thing comes of Mind Jehovah Shalom he restoreth my soul look at that restoration he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I love that description in that Valley there has to be light to be a Shadow so just because there's Darkness around you there's a light somewhere in there and that's God's light he's leading you because he knows there's going to be tough times where the he's the enem is going to run rampant in your life but don't let trials surprise you they're there for your benefit they're there to help you get to more restoration that's what trials are for they're here to help you grow it says yo yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever I remember this scripture so vividly because when I was me and my brother were growing up we uh my our mom used to read the scripture every night to us and all it means something special me always she used always get like the cup and I used to love it so it just it means a lot to me just reading the scripture and now as I got older it means even more to me because it's been revealed to me personally so now I've experienced these things in my life and it means that much more than it did when I was a kid that's how the word of God should be that's how our walk should be uh the longer we serve God he should mean that much more to us it's like in a marriage your highlight of your marriage shouldn't be when you first get married it should keep growing it should keep building it should be even better than when it was when it first started just like your walk with Christ if you're really putting in the work the diligence the desperation it should build just like in a marriage you should be putting the work in I know it gets hard sometimes I know we get comfortable and lazy but it's no time to get comfortable and lazy our our kids needs us they need to see a perfect example so they can cuz your kids are going to do what you do whe whether you like it or not and then you ask why why you acting like this I'm acting like you I'm acting like I see I I can testify that I I didn't realize that thing things that were in my life that I got from watching what my parents did or watching the bad Tendencies they did and I didn't real realize that till I was put in certain situations where I was I got tested or I got in a situation where something happened or lashed out that I didn't expect to come out I'm like where' this come from and then I realized oh my goodness it came from what I saw my parents just like with finances bad with finances because that's what I saw growing up and I never got out of the habit and there something I have to break and and so there's certain things that want to make sure we want to iron out because they're not just going to go away magically just like with Moses instead of speaking to the Rock he hit the rock so he never gave God his anger just like with Samson he never gave God his heart all the way so certain things that we got to we got to deal with before they get out of hand just like with David David never uh dealt with his woman problem I say anybody has that problem but he never dealt with that issue in his life and he was still getting Revelation he was still walking close with God but a certain situation happened where that under the rug situation it came out of the rug and he had to pay for it he had to really pay for it and certain things that we're going to have to pay for if we don't get things handled out right now cuz God is giving us a time for restoration right now he's trying to restore all aspects of our life not just one but all aspects of our life and we got to get back in step with the word of God Amen we got we got uh we got one more so we got Jehovah I don't know how to say this word t thank you thank you thank you the Lord my righteousness so think about that in in his days Judah shall be saved and Israel swad safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called the Lord our righteousness so I always think about this scripture in um in Hebrews it talks about how he's a high priest that can be touched by the feeling your infirmities he said we can come boldly into the throne but it's not your righteousness it's his righteousness it's his merits that let you enter into the holiest of the holiest place and the thing is we got to recognize it's nothing that you and I can do or you and I can or did it's what he did that allows us to have this personal walk that allows us to have this Beau this this this building we have right now cuz some some churches are are are just hungering for a place just to worship we got a beautiful place right now I know it's not the perfect setup but it will be the perfect setup when we get our new building amen so until now we got to show God how faithful we are cuz it doesn't matter where you're having church at because we're the church Hallelujah we we can have church outside in in in uh in the courtyard and God still be there see God isn't Bound by some building God is only thing time God can be bound if if our faith isn't there so we got to if we believe he's here we got to bring them here too cuz it's a liquor fire and all all side of you got everybody has liquor fire but we got to don't leave God out there bring him with you amen amen now I believe we're living in the in the in the last days we're living in the days that we're otherwise the days that we're living in should cause the church to go completely into desperation I believe since the message this morning from God not me I believe it ought to throw this entire congregation into desperation that we have played long enough we went to church long enough we've got to do something and I read this uh this other quote I read this I was reading this quote the other day and it just really challenged me I believe that the reason we don't have desperation is because it's a lack of love God the love of God I'm read that one more time cuz it cut me a little bit I believe that the reason we don't have desperation is because it's the lack of love God the love of God I I think that the love of God causes desperation if God is in you the token inside of you and you see the conditions of the time and people waiting in sin the way they are it'll throw you into desperation I believe in will so I think we've the devil has gotten so cunning and so crafty like I always said this before he we got all this technology and it's a blessing but it's also a cursing because it can lead you so far away from God you got YouTube social media you name it you got these reals that reel you in just scrolling videos and just laughing ha and you you try to do something you try to look for this video and then other videos pop up and before you know it you're too far in and so it's caused us to lose our desperation because 40 50 years ago Christians were desperate to see God move and I think we get so comfortable oh the the Lord's coming is going to come someday but brother Bram said this he said still plant your potatoes but live like God's coming tomorrow cuz we living like God's coming 20 years from now it could be it could be right now it could be 10 minutes from now so we got to live like he's coming I remember the statement I said one time pray like it's your last prayer imagine the desperation you'll have we just pray like oh I I got to get in today like like a meal I got to get this fast food real quick let me stuff my face real quick and we that's how we treat God don't treat we can't treat God like that anymore we got to be desperate because God's going to move if you're desperate if you really sincerely desperate God will move in the situation you need him to move in just like with Hannah she she hit the right vein she got desperate and say God I'm going to dedicate this child to you and God was like okay I hear you now and the same thing with that's like you may say you want res restoration but do you really want it your prayers are going to indicate if you really want it you're read you're reading the Bible life message of Y life is going to indicate how bad you want Restoration in your life CU restoration isn't going to come just because brother Jack because brother Jack's preaching what the Lord said to you but you got to be able to receive what is being spoken through brother Jack because he can't do it for you he can't he he would love to but he can't I can't do it no Minister here can do it you all responsible we have is is getting the word across as God's put in our hearts is to give it to you and we got to become not only hearers of the word but we got to do what is being spoken across the pulpit the prophet said this that I rather somebody live me a sermon than preach me a sermon so we got to live the message of the hour not just know about it yeah you can quote stuff but are you living the quotes that's that's the biggest thing like you said living Epistles that that's what God is looking for is living Epistles let's go to Romans chapter 8 we'll close after this on one more quote so this scripture just reminded me of um uh Psalms 46 so it says who shall separate us from the love of Christ so my Bible's telling me that nothing should separate us from Love Of Christ but we let things separate us from Love Of Christ we let life getting away we let our jobs getting away our our business getting away our our our family issues getting away we make all these excuses but never have a solution to the excuses because our excuses sound so good to us we've deceived our own self say it again our excuses sound so good to us it deceives our own self and we got to lay aside excuses because excuses will not get you anywhere with God CU God doesn't want to hear him and I don't want hear my God doesn't want hear my excuses either so it says who shall separate us from Love Of Christ shall tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I'm persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord so now the Bible just gave us all the excuses we could have and it's telling us that none of these excuses should separate us from the love of God so right there is telling us our excuses are nothing they're worthless we we might as well just cast them right then and right out and I'm guilty of making excuses sometimes I'm not going to say I put myself right in the CHP like I am guilty but the thing is we got to this should be the year where we we stop making excuses cuz all it's going to do is just prolong what God's trying to do in your life you can either go the easy way or the hard way you pick it Go God's perfect will permissive way you pick it you make that choice right now we'll close on this quote just think of that that everything in the old Testament pointed straight to Calvary all the plans of redemptions all the names all the symbols all the worship all the Tabernacles all of the wood all everything in this Tabernacle everything spoke of Christ wherever you go whatever you do God was back there in those old Hebrew prophets and so forth speaking and speaking to that time of perfection that Jesus would come to the perfect believer just of what think it means friends so we said before just don't forget Jehovah is present right right now whatever situation you're going in he's present right now waiting for you to access him brother Bram said this statement everything you have need of is inside of you just waiting to be gerti by the Holy Ghost everything you have need of not everything you want but everything you have need of and and God will bless you exceedingly and abundantly I always will say the scripture the day I die Matthew 6:33 but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you so God knows what you need he he knows what you need from the beginning of your journey to the end of your journey he said I have plans to prosper you and give you an expected end he promised to give you an expected in and it says you got to seek him with all your heart though that that that's the Catch 22 right there God doesn't ask for much all he ask for is is you that's all he wants is you all of you not just the portion you want to give him but every single last piece of you your heart your mind your body and soul and I promise if you really do that if you really really do that God is going to do things that you never seen him do before in your life because you are letting him have full premeny in life let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we are so thankful Lord for this day Lord thank you just for reminding us Lord that this the seven compound names that you are Lord you are still those names every name that that you named Lord that we named lies in you Lord Jesus and father we're so sorry for forgetting those things sometimes you just have to bring things to our remembrance I'm so thankful Lord that you bring those things to our remembrance or to remind us who you really are ohmighty God we're so thankful Lord that you're calling us in this season to Restoration Lord father that that song says Lord don't do without me what whatever season that you're in Lord just don't do without me Lord I believe your healing in this season I believe your Financial Freedom in this season I believe a closer walk in this season all these things Lord that you're trying to restore Deliverance in this season Lord father we want to miss it Lord we want to be right front and center Lord we want to be aware spiritually to hear and to see what you're trying to lead us into Lord Lord just give us eyes to see a heart to receive and and and faith is to walk in as you speak Lord and almighty God uh as we uh would leave soon Lord we pray that your presence doesn't leave us but it goes with us Lord may you continue to lead us and guide us Lord as we need your help Lord you said in your word that you're a present help in a present time and Lord we we need your help we want to wait until uh everything's falling apart and then the ship's falling apart but Lord we want to just call on you right now even in the good times and the bad times Lord because our tendency Lord as human beings is to wait until we we need help but Lord we don't want to wait till we need help but Lord we want to call upon you day and night Lord I want to cry out to you Lord just as your word says I remember David was just talking about how that he needed you like like water like in a dry and thirsty land oh God may we be desperate from this day day forth Lord may we no longer just be lazy and slothful but Lord let us let our eyes be always fixated on you the author and finish of our faith almighty God may you have your way tonight Lord let us just meditate upon this word Lord let us just just think about this word throughout the coming days Lord and help help this word just to be just written Upon Our Hearts and our minds Lord we give you all the praise all the honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen [Applause] amen praise the Lord amen amen appreciate that brother Mark amen so many uh we call them golden nuggets amen and and in that and he was talking about that one quote where he we talking is uh in God hidden in himself in Simplicity say the beauty of the church is in the character of the people the beauty of the churches and the character of the people and I just believe that amen God has a place amen that he that he's getting ready for us to move right into but it won't be no good if if the character of the people ain't no good amen cuz uh that's that's the building is just uh breaking mortar amen because uh I believe honestly that that when when people come through the door they must feel the love of Christ amen must feel the love of Christ in in in that Sanctuary amen so we probably have some things we need to just clean up amen little things that uh we got in our hearts against one another and things like that because how can you uh say you love God and and that who you never seen before amen and and and don't love your fellow man who you fellowship with every week amen make things right with one another love one another amen these things are very important because see the devil will come in and just put little things in your heart put little things against this right there and against this one it ain't nothing but the devil it ain't nothing and and when somebody draw a circle and draw you out you just draw a bigger Circle and draw them back in amen amen that's what's going to keep the church strong amen that's right amen so we love that brother brother brother uh Mark I appreciate that he was talking about that City of Refuge amen that that place that we can see sometime uh uh things come out of left field I don't know how many's ever been hit without seeing it coming yes see some look when when it's easy sometime when you get hit and you got time to brace for it you see it coming so you can clinch up and Brace and and you ready for it and you can absorb that blow but when you don't even see it coming out of left field you just walking and minding your own business and P now you're disoriented you got to get yourself you don't even know who hit you but see we got to get ready and stay ready amen because see the devil will come out of left field sometime amen and catch you off God like the brother say sometimes some things happen and all of a sudden we resort back to our old ways we'll Resort back to what we've seen amen but we have to stay steady on the word of God get ready Stay Ready that's a message get ready Stay Ready amen so it's important for us to just be ready because things come quick and the devil will come and get and surprise you amen uh uh uh but he'll come amen it's just beautiful how he just deals was us in Simplicity Amen in the Simplicity uh recently just a a little quick testimony I have my my wife we getting ready to go to the doctor and uh I don't know you don't mind if I tell this do you honey she's getting ready to go to the go to the doctor her the first appointment and uh that morning she's you know we had prayer Sunday and uh she leaving the house and right when she get in the car and

that in beautifully he's Jehovah J amen that's he might come we might need Jehovah nii amen we might need uh uh uh Jehovah Shalom amen so he's he's he's everything he's everything that we need when we need it and sometime we like I say we get caught off God who I didn't see that coming I didn't see that coming and we making plans and we doing this and we're trying to achieve things and we trying you know doing what we do and trying to do this and all of a sudden boom something I look we got to hold to God's unchanging hand we sang the song but you know in times like these we need a savior in times like these we need a friend you never failed me yet Jesus Christ has never failed me yet he's Jehovah Gyra my provider amen a he's just wonderful wonderful Jesus is to me my counselor Mighty God
