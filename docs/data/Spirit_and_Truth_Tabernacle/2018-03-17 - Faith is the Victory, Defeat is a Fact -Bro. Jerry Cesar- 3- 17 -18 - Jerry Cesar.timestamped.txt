[55:31] Lord some Jesus Christ's name that I
[55:33] pray amen
[55:34] [Music]
[55:36] thank you
[55:37] [Music]
[55:40] god bless you sites I'm very grateful to
[55:44] be here with you guys today I trust you
[55:47] all had a good day
[55:56] turn with me to first John chapter 5
[56:00] verse 4
[56:07] last time I was here I was very nervous
[56:10] so definitely a different feeling by
[56:16] grace of God thankful for everyone that
[56:19] I see so I pray that his word can be
[56:21] preached in the rightful way to your
[56:24] hearts today first John chapter 5 verse
[56:30] 4 for whatsoever is born of God
[56:35] overcometh the world and this is the
[56:39] victory that overcometh the world even
[56:41] our faith who is he that overcometh the
[56:44] world but he that believeth that Jesus
[56:48] is the Son of God this is the this is he
[56:52] that came by water and blood even Jesus
[56:54] Christ not by water only but by water
[56:58] and blood and this is the spirit that
[57:01] beareth witness because the Spirit is
[57:04] truth thank you
[57:07] made a load out of blessing to his
[57:08] reading I like to use as a title faith
[57:15] is the victory defeat is a fact
[57:22] so I like to pose a question what is
[57:25] faith we go to Hebrews 11 it tells us
[57:28] that faith is the substance of things
[57:30] hoped for the evidence of things not
[57:33] seen so see faith is a reality it's your
[57:38] reality of the things that the things
[57:41] that you don't see and it's the proof of
[57:43] what you don't see what you're believing
[57:47] in God for whatever it is that your
[57:50] prayer consists of it depends on your
[57:53] faith your faith will either bring you
[57:56] victory or it'll bring you you know it
[58:01] allowed it already bring you victory or
[58:02] your faith can can get compromised and
[58:06] when you when you fit they're
[58:07] compromised
[58:08] that's when fear settles in right but
[58:11] understand that your faith is supposed
[58:13] to be proven because the right type of
[58:16] faith can only produce victory and if I
[58:19] could just add this only rapturing faith
[58:22] can produce and allow you to get to a
[58:24] rapture so what is the right type of
[58:29] faith if we go to Galatians 5:16 it says
[58:34] this I say then walk in the spirit and
[58:37] ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the
[58:40] flesh
[58:40] so what is your dwelling place it says
[58:45] walk in the spirit and you shall not
[58:49] fulfill the lusts of the flesh your
[58:52] faith determines where you go everybody
[58:54] has faith but your dwelling place
[58:57] determines what your faith is going to
[59:00] bring out of it if you're walking in the
[59:02] spirit your faith will produce victory
[59:05] but if you're dwelling in your flesh is
[59:07] going to produce defeat by faith Enoch
[59:12] was translated that he should not see
[59:14] death and was not found because God had
[59:18] translated him for before his
[59:21] translation he had this testimony that
[59:24] he pleased God
[59:28] how did he please God if we could just
[59:31] connect the to the few words in the
[59:33] first the first part of that scripture
[59:35] in last it says by faith he please God
[59:37] he walked with God see it wasn't bad it
[59:41] wasn't by sight but it was by faith and
[59:45] and the Bible doesn't tell us so much
[59:47] about Enoch but it tells in Genesis 5
[59:49] right that that he walked with God and
[59:53] he was not for God took him that's got
[59:57] to be our testimony today you can't wait
[59:59] for the rapture to say that you have
[1:00:01] faith faith focuses on the now right
[1:00:04] believing all the things on scene as if
[1:00:07] there already work if you're dwelling in
[1:00:09] defeat then it means you never had faith
[1:00:11] right so God has already given us
[1:00:14] victory it's been it's been purchased
[1:00:16] already at the cross but you leave faith
[1:00:19] it's accepted faith to receive it and
[1:00:21] faith to keep it see you have to put God
[1:00:25] first and by putting God first you also
[1:00:29] have to keep God first I learned that
[1:00:31] the trials will continue the burdens
[1:00:34] will increase and the weights will be
[1:00:36] heavier but no matter what you ask God
[1:00:38] for putting it into your trials is one
[1:00:40] that he's not going to fulfill and 1st
[1:00:44] Peter 1:7 says the trial of your faith
[1:00:46] being more precious than of gold that
[1:00:48] person though would be tried with fire
[1:00:51] might be found on to praise and honor
[1:00:53] and glory at the appearing of Jesus
[1:00:55] Christ so your trials are not meant to
[1:00:58] destroy you but to prove you it's a
[1:01:01] revelation with the right kind of faith
[1:01:03] it shows who you are it shows what
[1:01:05] you're identified right so if you think
[1:01:08] about all the times you've been tried
[1:01:10] and to think that the enemy allowed you
[1:01:13] to get this far it's the enemy that
[1:01:16] tries you with the seat with the sit
[1:01:17] with deception but God allows him to try
[1:01:21] so you can be proven God allows you to
[1:01:25] go through a trial so that the fruits of
[1:01:27] his spirit can be reflected what are the
[1:01:30] fruits of his spirit in Galatians it
[1:01:33] shows us that it's joy love peace
[1:01:36] long-suffering gentleness goodness faith
[1:01:39] meekness
[1:01:40] temperance against such there is no law
[1:01:42] and they that are in Christ have
[1:01:45] crucified the flesh with the affections
[1:01:47] of less so as a question we all have to
[1:01:51] come to a point where all the attributes
[1:01:54] of God has been fulfilled right before
[1:01:58] before the foundation of the world God
[1:02:01] already knew you would he set him right
[1:02:03] you chose sides we all did that but it
[1:02:07] didn't mean you didn't still have to
[1:02:08] fight see the children of Israel had to
[1:02:11] fight every step of the way to claim
[1:02:12] their victory and when they claimed
[1:02:14] their victory the fight was still not
[1:02:16] over see God gives us victory but we all
[1:02:20] need faith to keep it think that what we
[1:02:23] need faith in Christ and the spite of
[1:02:25] their victory as we see the children of
[1:02:27] Israel they still don't defeat even
[1:02:28] after that right they forgot their taste
[1:02:31] of victory they forgot what God had done
[1:02:34] for them right it's not so much that
[1:02:38] didn't realize who and and what God was
[1:02:42] doing but they didn't have enough faith
[1:02:44] to keep the fire burning they lost sight
[1:02:46] of their victory and I learned even
[1:02:49] today you can't fight today's battle
[1:02:51] with yesterday's faith your faith has to
[1:02:54] be renewed every single day the thing
[1:02:58] that you had to overcome yesterday you
[1:03:00] need a different faiths overcoming today
[1:03:02] because the enemy's greatest gift is
[1:03:05] deception
[1:03:05] he just wants you to know that you're
[1:03:08] lost and as long as he can get that
[1:03:10] instill in your mind and your spirit
[1:03:12] right then you know she's got you but
[1:03:14] the spite of all of that if we can walk
[1:03:17] in the spirit being God gives us victory
[1:03:20] because of our faith right
[1:03:22] faith is what makes the difference faith
[1:03:25] is the victory many caught many can't we
[1:03:28] call on facts and things like that right
[1:03:31] now in our day of what's going on people
[1:03:34] leaving a message people leaving the
[1:03:37] revelation of that God gave to us right
[1:03:40] what is it that they're leaning on
[1:03:42] Deerling in there leaning onto their own
[1:03:44] understanding right
[1:03:45] the Bible says lean not to your own
[1:03:46] understanding acknowledge God in all
[1:03:49] your ways and he shot direct your path
[1:03:50] right so your faith has to
[1:03:54] be greater than the fact the facts I
[1:03:57] learned that God God cannot be figured
[1:04:02] out all right
[1:04:03] a fact can only be proven based on
[1:04:06] something that's already been created
[1:04:08] but faith has the ability to create so
[1:04:13] which one is greater fact or your faith
[1:04:16] faith overcomes death if we go to faith
[1:04:21] is the victory this is 50 1958 faith is
[1:04:30] the victory
[1:04:37] she says
[1:04:44] bear with me so it says when you come to
[1:04:48] him don't come to him as a floater
[1:04:51] paragraph 55 by the way don't come to
[1:04:55] him as a floater I'll go up and try it
[1:04:57] and see if it works you'll never get
[1:05:00] nowhere but when you come with this kind
[1:05:02] of determination that you have sold out
[1:05:04] lock stock and barrel when you are tired
[1:05:07] of the world and sin and unbelief in
[1:05:09] frustrations and doubts and come to the
[1:05:12] Living God where they anchor surely tie
[1:05:15] into the Rock of Ages the Holy Spirit is
[1:05:17] here to pull you into the presence of
[1:05:19] the Living God that will give you a
[1:05:21] faith that will overcome anything that
[1:05:24] there is in the world sickness disease
[1:05:27] and even death itself see
[1:05:32] faith is what overcomes death with the
[1:05:36] fact see the fact that Lazarus was dead
[1:05:39] but faith raised them up before you died
[1:05:43] before he died you couldn't have made it
[1:05:46] effect until afterwards he was dead
[1:05:49] see it wasn't that he became a fact but
[1:05:52] even with that faith overcame faith
[1:05:55] doesn't wait until it focuses on the now
[1:05:57] it can create anything out of nothing in
[1:06:01] church I'm here to tell you can claim
[1:06:03] victory right now you guys we all have
[1:06:06] the faith to overcome we all have the
[1:06:08] faith to create anything out of our
[1:06:11] uncle wanted circumstances that's the
[1:06:13] victory God has given us so it isn't our
[1:06:17] place or position to let the foolish
[1:06:19] facts out there fool our faith because
[1:06:21] that's not what work that's not what
[1:06:23] we're living by that's not our
[1:06:24] foundation that's not our revelation see
[1:06:27] our revelation is that Jesus Christ
[1:06:30] overcame the world and by his Spirit we
[1:06:33] overcame the word also see faith is the
[1:06:40] victory but but we we all have to
[1:06:44] understand that wits with with with
[1:06:46] victory comes purpose so you can't have
[1:06:50] victory without first finding purpose
[1:06:54] what is the life what is the the journey
[1:06:57] the
[1:06:57] the money that God has purposed in our
[1:06:59] hearts right because we're all God's
[1:07:02] masterpiece but until we've identified
[1:07:04] what he's purposed for us we won't be
[1:07:07] able to fulfill his purpose in our lives
[1:07:10] and that's that's how we we can reflect
[1:07:12] who God is in our life by allowing his
[1:07:14] his plans to be fulfilled it's not our
[1:07:19] plans but his plans our plans got the
[1:07:21] surrender to his right
[1:07:26] paragraph 62 now faith is a conqueror
[1:07:29] faith is an overcomer it isn't just a
[1:07:33] peacemaker it overcomes faith is the
[1:07:37] victory that overcomes the world what
[1:07:38] does it do what is faith what is it to
[1:07:42] conquer to conquer and victory is the
[1:07:44] same to conquer it means to beat down to
[1:07:46] override to handcuff to throw it to
[1:07:49] prison it means that the same that
[1:07:52] wrongs that once ruled you you rule it
[1:07:54] now it means that you have overcome it
[1:07:57] you are you have whipped it you're
[1:08:00] greater than it is the devil and his
[1:08:03] plans are far beyond us nothing that
[1:08:07] he's doing now can disrupt the plans of
[1:08:10] God and with faith it's got to be
[1:08:13] unconditional it can't be conditional
[1:08:16] faith
[1:08:17] it can't be waiting for something first
[1:08:19] to happen for us to have faith it has to
[1:08:21] be faith that believes even when things
[1:08:23] are not going our way see with faith in
[1:08:29] James 2:26 it says for the body without
[1:08:33] the Spirit is dead so faith without
[1:08:38] works is dead also see I realized that
[1:08:41] our next blessings are as close as our
[1:08:45] next prayer see prayer is the weapon
[1:08:48] that God has given us to change and to
[1:08:51] change any and every circumstances that
[1:08:53] opposes his plans see the word is his is
[1:08:57] the weapon he's given us prayer is our
[1:08:59] place to show God who we are to show our
[1:09:04] circumstances that we have power and
[1:09:06] authority over it see I can go as much
[1:09:09] as say faith without pray
[1:09:11] is dead you can't say you have faith and
[1:09:14] not pray right because before you pray
[1:09:17] you have to first believe before you can
[1:09:20] believe you have to have faith right so
[1:09:22] prayer gives us dominion over sickness
[1:09:25] addiction bondage anything that opposes
[1:09:28] his word and the word is the very thing
[1:09:31] that defeats the enemy now how do you
[1:09:33] fight someone that's already been
[1:09:35] defeated because the enemy is already
[1:09:37] defeated right see oftentimes the real
[1:09:41] fight is not with the enemies within
[1:09:43] ourselves
[1:09:44] cuz Satan is not omnipresent he can't be
[1:09:47] everywhere at the same time right so so
[1:09:51] how is it that he can cause a whole
[1:09:52] nation to be divided or or or to
[1:09:55] completely be outside of the will of God
[1:09:57] right it's his tactics he uses was
[1:10:00] already ours to corrupt us right Satan
[1:10:03] is a really God but he tries to be like
[1:10:06] God right he uses what belongs to us to
[1:10:10] deceive us right you already have
[1:10:13] victory but he gives you fear you
[1:10:16] already are you're already healed but he
[1:10:18] comes to you with sickness you're
[1:10:20] already an overcomer but he comes to you
[1:10:21] in discouragement right everything
[1:10:24] that's already yours he uses this to
[1:10:26] deceive you right he's already defeated
[1:10:29] but his plan is to keep trying and I saw
[1:10:32] he knows to do they're the same
[1:10:34] revelation we got he got and the best
[1:10:37] way to fight someone that's already
[1:10:38] defeated it's the claim was already
[1:10:40] yours and that's victory right if this
[1:10:44] seems hopeless our position in the job
[1:10:46] is to pray if it seems impossible what
[1:10:49] we ought to pray if it seems good we
[1:10:52] ought to still print right see Moses he
[1:10:57] pleaded with God to preserve his own
[1:10:59] name and character and not to destroy
[1:11:01] Israel Hezekiah prayed for deliverance
[1:11:05] and healing right a godly King about to
[1:11:07] see his nation conquered and destroyed
[1:11:09] by the mighty Assyrian army but then he
[1:11:12] hears from a prophet that he should
[1:11:14] prepare to die soon so how does he pray
[1:11:17] in defeat no sir
[1:11:20] trusting that God was able to do
[1:11:21] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[1:11:23] can ask he
[1:11:24] was able to actually change God's mind
[1:11:27] God already has something planned for
[1:11:30] him but he prayed and his prayer changed
[1:11:33] God's mind David prayed a prayer to
[1:11:36] surrender to God Jesus Christ he prayed
[1:11:40] that the father's will be done right so
[1:11:43] our job as a Christian is to pray by
[1:11:46] prayer our faith can be led to do
[1:11:50] greater and bigger things to accept the
[1:11:52] promises of God because if God gave us a
[1:11:55] promise then every promise he gave us
[1:11:57] he's obligated to fulfill we're standing
[1:11:59] on his word in Matthew 20 21 13 and said
[1:12:05] and said unto them it is written my
[1:12:08] house shall be called a house of prayer
[1:12:10] so by prayer and faith is how we can
[1:12:14] defeat the enemy I learned that church
[1:12:19] faith is the only thing that can get us
[1:12:24] ready to get out of here
[1:12:26] faith is what allows us to continue this
[1:12:28] race but our faith has to be dealt with
[1:12:32] Wheldon in the right things see our
[1:12:34] spirit has to our spirit is with God we
[1:12:37] walk with God
[1:12:38] the reason Enoch was able to be raptured
[1:12:40] is because he walked with God you know
[1:12:42] he did fulfill the lusts of his flesh
[1:12:44] but he walked with God our testimonies
[1:12:47] got to be the same because we don't have
[1:12:49] much more time in Ephesians 6 verse 10
[1:12:57] says finally my brethren be strong in
[1:13:02] the Lord and in the power of his might
[1:13:05] put on the whole armour of God that you
[1:13:09] may be able to stand awhile to stand
[1:13:11] against the wiles of the devil for we
[1:13:13] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[1:13:15] against principalities against powers
[1:13:17] against the rulers of darkness of this
[1:13:20] world against spiritual wickedness in
[1:13:22] high places
[1:13:23] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[1:13:26] of God that you may be able to withstand
[1:13:28] in the evil day and having done all to
[1:13:31] stand stand therefore having your loins
[1:13:33] gird about with truth and having a
[1:13:36] breastplate of righteousness
[1:13:38] so see it's our it's our job to make
[1:13:40] sure that we can identify with making
[1:13:44] sure we overcome all the things that the
[1:13:47] devil has are coming our way because as
[1:13:49] a Christian the fight doesn't get easier
[1:13:51] but we're promised to get there and and
[1:13:54] no matter what it is that's come our way
[1:13:56] we already have victory to Jesus Christ
[1:14:00] see last Sunday pastor Jack was saying
[1:14:05] we have to get into the spirit and I
[1:14:08] thought it was appropriate to go over
[1:14:09] this again this is making a valley full
[1:14:13] of ditches 1956 it says and the only way
[1:14:18] you're ever going to see your way out is
[1:14:21] an old-fashioned spiritual revival where
[1:14:24] the hallelujahs of God is ringing from
[1:14:27] the bottom of your heart and an
[1:14:29] old-fashioned Holy Ghost sent revival
[1:14:31] hits the place then you begin to see
[1:14:34] things then God will begin to reveal
[1:14:37] things then you'll wonder why these real
[1:14:39] Christians are hanging on while they're
[1:14:41] praying for you what a revival and he
[1:14:44] got into the spirit now the reason these
[1:14:47] people have dances is that they if they
[1:14:50] didn't have a dance so they could get
[1:14:52] into the spirit of dancing you can't
[1:14:54] have a bell game unless you get in the
[1:14:56] spirit of a ball game you have got to
[1:14:58] get into the spirit of it and we can
[1:15:01] never have a revival in a seventh port
[1:15:03] or anything else until church gets into
[1:15:05] the spirit of revival God can come and
[1:15:08] perform miracles he can show us wonders
[1:15:10] he can stretch forth his arm his hand to
[1:15:13] heal the sick and afflicted the preacher
[1:15:16] can preach the gospel as hard as he can
[1:15:18] but there never be a revival until the
[1:15:21] church gets in the spirit of it so we
[1:15:23] have to get into the spirit of revival
[1:15:25] no matter what is it well no matter what
[1:15:27] it is is going on today God is still the
[1:15:30] same yesterday today and forever right
[1:15:33] redemption has a name that's Jesus
[1:15:35] victory has a name that's Jesus healing
[1:15:39] has a name that's Jesus
[1:15:50] 19:58 hear his voice like to also read
[1:15:55] this says God has a new birth for you
[1:15:59] but listen to his still small voice
[1:16:02] every one of you people who profess to
[1:16:05] be Christians to get yourself quiet
[1:16:07] before him
[1:16:08] don't let the work don't let the washing
[1:16:10] hinder don't let the work hinder don't
[1:16:12] let nothing hinder don't let nobody know
[1:16:14] what you're doing just go before him get
[1:16:16] up in the woods somewhere and get out of
[1:16:18] the side of the road and go into the
[1:16:20] secret closet and close the door when
[1:16:22] the kids get at school there get down on
[1:16:25] your knees you've heard all the voices
[1:16:27] you've heard all the noises but you've
[1:16:29] got to go there and stay there until
[1:16:31] those voices are silenced and you begin
[1:16:33] to lift it up it'll change you to make
[1:16:36] you different it'll make you the kind of
[1:16:38] Christian you ought to be so Church
[1:16:42] we're living at a time where prayer has
[1:16:44] to be our foundation faith is our
[1:16:47] victory and we have to accept every all
[1:16:49] the promises of God it says clearly that
[1:16:54] we've already overcame the world and and
[1:16:57] and this is the faith that God has given
[1:16:59] us so we have to keep prop we have to
[1:17:02] keep the race we have to keep overcoming
[1:17:05] all the trials in all the battles
[1:17:06] because the truth is we have everything
[1:17:10] we need to get to where we want to be
[1:17:11] we're just suppose in this in this world
[1:17:14] and it's earth I'm just allowing the
[1:17:17] promises of God to be fulfilled no
[1:17:20] matter who and what is coming with what
[1:17:22] they have manat enough to interrupt or
[1:17:26] disrupt what God has done for us and
[1:17:29] what he's given us already because faith
[1:17:32] is is something that no matter who you
[1:17:36] are you have it but what your dwelling
[1:17:39] determines where you go so I'm very very
[1:17:44] grateful I know there's there's a little
[1:17:51] bit more but
[1:17:56] with what God has allowed me to to do
[1:18:03] faith I realize is the only thing that's
[1:18:07] that's holding this world together and
[1:18:09] and and despite of all the horrific acts
[1:18:13] and in this world the light of this
[1:18:17] world is us here and and and when we're
[1:18:22] finally removed from the scenes there'll
[1:18:25] be a tribulation there'll be a
[1:18:27] destruction and we we have to praise the
[1:18:31] Lord that that we're in a position where
[1:18:34] we won't have to see those things and
[1:18:36] it's our job to stay away and stay in
[1:18:40] tune stay in tune with the Spirit of God
[1:18:42] that he can prepare us and get us ready
[1:18:45] for what's getting ready to happen
[1:18:55] may the Lord add a blessing say his word
[1:18:58] thank you thank you lord
[1:19:37] is the Lord for brother Jerry that's
[1:19:46] certainly a wonderful thought there man
[1:19:50] faith is a victory defeat is a fact and
[1:19:56] there was the that your faith has to be
[1:20:01] greater than facts right I say that now
[1:20:05] that's that's pretty good you know you
[1:20:08] especially when you you know you see all
[1:20:10] the stuff you know floating on the
[1:20:13] internet or whatever it is social media
[1:20:15] about the message you know and now
[1:20:17] somebody recently was telling me that
[1:20:19] they couldn't they couldn't find the
[1:20:22] fact was they could not find 16 men that
[1:20:26] fell off a bridge and brother branham
[1:20:29] said that you know these people would
[1:20:30] fall off the bridge and they couldn't
[1:20:32] find that you know so the fact was they
[1:20:34] couldn't find it so their facts said
[1:20:36] that it didn't happen and that the
[1:20:38] Prophet was not telling the truth and
[1:20:41] when they brought that to my attention I
[1:20:44] you know said let's let's go back to
[1:20:45] that time period you know you couldn't
[1:20:49] find that I'm sure they did a Google
[1:20:50] search and couldn't find it
[1:20:52] not that Google has everything but
[1:20:54] nonetheless they trust Google over the
[1:20:57] Word of God right so I said let's go
[1:20:59] back to that time and let's just think
[1:21:01] about it I mean really really think
[1:21:02] about it if you were the boss of a
[1:21:08] company that was pouring concrete and on
[1:21:12] your job 16 men died while he was
[1:21:17] pouring concrete why use building this
[1:21:19] bridge would you want the rest of the
[1:21:23] people to know that this just happened
[1:21:24] on the job or would you try to cover it
[1:21:27] up so that you can get this job finished
[1:21:29] I said most people that are in that
[1:21:33] business it would get covered up and the
[1:21:37] only way you would know it would happen
[1:21:39] is that a prophet have to tell you
[1:21:41] cousin to be covered up right it's just
[1:21:44] no way that they released information
[1:21:46] like that so the media puts out there
[1:21:50] they want to put out there or what is
[1:21:52] control as to what was being spoken and
[1:21:54] and and that's why we thank God for a
[1:21:57] prophet you know that can kind of tell
[1:22:00] the secrets you know that happened in
[1:22:02] the Bible remember it was the Elijah I
[1:22:05] believe it was and and he was telling no
[1:22:08] Elijah and he's told that the King you
[1:22:13] know to avoid certain places because
[1:22:15] this other king was coming in to fight
[1:22:17] him and I think if the King does series
[1:22:18] like well do I have a spy in my camp or
[1:22:22] what's going on saying how does this fan
[1:22:24] know these things before I get this now
