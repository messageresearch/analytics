[30:23] so everything else everything else this

[30:37] little teaching for you tonight out of

[30:43] Sunday we'll take our time but we'll
[30:44] just have a short teaching in the Word
[30:46] of God and I want to I just want to just
[30:51] speak a little bit tonight and I talked
[30:54] a little bit about Israel and in the
[30:56] last she just had her birthday here last
[30:58] year seventy years and I want to talk
[31:00] about how they have prospered in just
[31:03] seventy years come from nothing and
[31:05] God's restored them to everything you
[31:08] know instils a type of our lives
[31:09] spiritually and so I'd like to talk
[31:12] about surviving and thrive and not just
[31:15] survive
[31:16] but thriving under the prophesy and
[31:18] under the Word of God praise the Lord so
[31:20] let's read a few places tonight and when
[31:22] we read these they might be a little
[31:24] different for you but they'll I believe
[31:27] they'll pull together as we speak of
[31:29] these things tonight Isaiah chapter 11
[31:31] Isaiah chapter 11 and appreciate my wife
[31:36] being with us as well and just those
[31:41] times that we just leave the kids at
[31:42] home and come away ourselves Isaiah
[31:45] chapter 11 verse 11 and 12 and these
[31:49] things will come together as you we
[31:51] speak of it tonight but just want to get
[31:53] them in your your minds and it came to
[31:55] pass isaiah 11:11 it shall come to pass
[31:58] in that day that the Lord shall set his
[32:00] hand again the second time to recover
[32:03] the remnant of his people which shall be
[32:05] left from Assyria and from Egypt and
[32:08] from Pathros and from cush and from Elim
[32:11] and from shanaar and from hamath and
[32:14] from the islands of the sea and he shall
[32:18] set up an in sign for the nations and
[32:21] shall assemble the outcasts of Israel
[32:24] and gather together the dispersed of
[32:27] Judah from the four corners of the earth
[32:30] Jesus referred to this in Matthew as
[32:32] well when he'll gather his elect from
[32:34] the four corners of the earth this is
[32:36] the scripture that speaks of them
[32:38] gathering and it mentions an in sign
[32:40] which brother Brandon referred to as
[32:41] being when Israel became a nation after
[32:44] so many years and then if you go under
[32:46] chapter 18 and verse 1 says woe to the
[32:50] land showering with wings which is
[32:52] beyond the rivers of the theö PIA that
[32:56] sinneth ambassadors by the sea even in
[32:59] vessels of bullrushes upon the water
[33:01] saying Gogi swift messengers to a nation
[33:05] scattered and peeled to a people
[33:07] terrible from their beginning hither to
[33:09] a nation meted out and trodden down
[33:12] whose land the rivers have spoiled all
[33:15] ye inhabitants of the world and was on
[33:17] the or sea when he lifted up an inside
[33:20] on the mountains and when he bloweth a
[33:22] trumpet hear ye and then another
[33:25] prophecy in Ezekiel 36 and I'm reading
[33:28] all
[33:29] prophecies for Israel whether it's the
[33:32] decline and the barrenness that comes to
[33:34] the land or the restoration there the
[33:37] Bible and the Old Testament is full of
[33:39] accounts of prophecies for Israel
[33:41] Ezekiel 36 Ezekiel 36 and verse 34 and
[33:52] the desolate land shall be tilled
[33:54] wherever it laid desolate in the sight
[33:56] of all that passed by and they shall say
[33:58] this land that was desolate is become
[34:02] like the Garden of Eden and the wastes
[34:05] and desolate and ruined cities are
[34:07] become fenced and are inhabited then the
[34:11] heathen that are left roundabout you
[34:14] shall know that I have I the Lord excuse
[34:17] either Lord build the ruined places and
[34:20] plant that that was desolate I the LORD
[34:23] have spoken it and I will do it so it's
[34:26] another place in Nehemiah that even the
[34:27] heathen after has to testify this work
[34:31] was wrought in God only God could do
[34:33] this to restore his people and he can
[34:35] take something desolate and prosper it
[34:37] caused it to survive and then caused it
[34:40] to thrive he's a God of restoration now
[34:43] I just started this just before I was
[34:45] coming in tonight
[34:46] Psalms chapter one so you related just a
[34:50] tad bit with it here Psalms chapter one
[34:54] I wanted to add this in blessing is the
[34:57] man that walketh not in the counsel of
[35:00] the ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[35:03] sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the
[35:05] scornful now look where this believer is
[35:08] look where he's positioned now he's not
[35:11] taking the counsel from the in godly
[35:13] ungodly he's not standing the way
[35:15] sinners nor sitteth in the seat of corn
[35:17] so scornful but his delight is in the
[35:20] word his delight is in the law of the
[35:22] Lord and his law doth he meditate day
[35:24] and night he's living in a different
[35:27] position he's living under the Word of
[35:29] God and so then it goes on to say and he
[35:33] shall be like a tree planted by the
[35:35] rivers of water that bringeth forth his
[35:38] fruit in his season know
[35:41] it's where he's planted in position it
[35:43] doesn't have anything to do with him as
[35:45] such it's because he's planted in the
[35:47] right place he's under the right word
[35:49] he's planted in the right place and look
[35:52] what happens he'll bring forth fruit
[35:54] news isn't his season his leaf also
[35:56] shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth
[36:00] shall prosper now don't try to change
[36:05] that that's what it says it's God's
[36:07] promise I'll take a hold of it tonight
[36:08] you take a hold of it a believer
[36:12] position in the word not because of your
[36:14] personality not because of that your
[36:16] position in the right place you're not
[36:19] taking your counsel from Google can you
[36:21] say mine you're living under the
[36:23] prophecy of the Word of God and God says
[36:27] that man or woman whatever they do is
[36:29] gonna prosper the ungodly are not so but
[36:35] are like the chaff which the wind
[36:36] driveth the way there is no purpose for
[36:38] their life
[36:39] there is no prophecy over their life
[36:41] we're different than the ungodly
[36:44] therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
[36:47] the judgment nor sinners in the
[36:49] congregation of the righteous for the
[36:51] Lord knoweth the way of the righteous
[36:52] but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish
[36:55] two groups of people as those that are
[36:57] under the prophecy of the word and those
[36:59] that aren't but those that are
[37:03] everything she does will prosper she's
[37:07] gonna thrive not because of herself but
[37:09] because she's under the right word
[37:11] father bless your word tonight god we
[37:15] pray that you'll anchor something into
[37:17] the hearts of the believers this evening
[37:18] and Lord I pray your Holy Spirit would
[37:21] just take preeminence speak through the
[37:23] word and as we teach this tonight I pray
[37:25] you'll break open the word of life and
[37:27] Lord excite us not under just an emotion
[37:30] but something deeper than that Lord to
[37:32] recognize our place we thank you father
[37:34] in Jesus name Amen god bless you may
[37:39] [Music]
[37:44] change my direction just a little bit
[37:46] before the service this afternoon and I
[37:49] want to just look at this just a little
[37:51] bit and it was quite exciting last year
[37:53] when I was looking into
[37:55] some of the celebration that took place
[37:57] for Israel when she celebrated 70 years
[38:00] as a nation and on May 14th they
[38:05] celebrate 70 years as a nation and they
[38:08] celebrated becoming one of the greatest
[38:12] nations and countries among the world
[38:14] now now you got to remember that this is
[38:17] a nation that was no nation for many
[38:20] many thousands of years and had become
[38:24] desolate and here because of the word
[38:26] had said that they had become desolate
[38:28] and the people were scattered abroad as
[38:30] I read neither prophecy and and so now
[38:33] now we see in just seventy years which
[38:36] this astounds the people as they looked
[38:39] at it at the birthday it astounded them
[38:41] for a nation to become a nation and to
[38:44] advance and to prosper just in 70 years
[38:48] as like the number twenty last year was
[38:51] the number twenty nation of all the
[38:53] nations in the world economically
[38:56] agriculture in every way they've
[38:58] advanced in every way above a lot of the
[39:00] other nations and everybody's going how
[39:03] does this happen if you don't have a
[39:04] spiritual mind you don't know how it
[39:06] happens but you got a spiritual mind you
[39:08] know exactly how it happens they are a
[39:10] people in a nation under a prophecy
[39:12] they're carrying a word can you say man
[39:15] that's the difference they're a nation
[39:18] that's under a prophecy of the word and
[39:20] that word is going to come to pass a man
[39:25] I don't have time to preach this and
[39:27] apply to you very much tonight so I'll
[39:28] pray you apply to yourself because
[39:30] everything Israel comes to naturally as
[39:32] a nation comes to the individual as the
[39:34] bride of Jesus Christ so as you know
[39:37] your Bible then it brings out things and
[39:39] that they were a nation if you study it
[39:41] they were a nation before of course and
[39:43] when they were a nation before of Israel
[39:45] they were a thriving nation under
[39:47] Solomon they came to a millennium they
[39:49] came to a time that all the nations of
[39:51] the world regard is regarded Israel the
[39:54] the the the there was a woman that
[39:57] traveled all those all those countries
[39:59] and all those miles where the RAM talked
[40:01] about to come and see the greatness of
[40:03] Israel and so we've got all those
[40:05] references and then
[40:07] and it's because due to honour 28:1 says
[40:09] and it took come to vas if thou shall
[40:11] hearken diligently into the voice of the
[40:13] LORD thy God to observe it and do all
[40:15] his Commandments why commanding this day
[40:17] that the Lord thy God will set the on
[40:19] high above all nations of the earth so
[40:23] now even back then they begin to work
[40:26] off of a prophecy of a prophet that they
[40:29] actually advanced and became above all
[40:33] the nations of the earth 2,000 years ago
[40:36] Israel had become the mighty superpower
[40:38] of the entire world and acknowledged
[40:42] nation a nation that was just coveted
[40:45] can you say men everybody wanted to go
[40:48] see what was happening in Israel and so
[40:51] then exactly what had happened according
[40:53] to prophecy that happened but then just
[40:55] after that if you read in your Bible and
[40:57] tonight I'm just gonna I'm just gonna
[40:59] refer to these you can study him on your
[41:00] own then he says these words moreover
[41:03] the Lord will scatter you and this is in
[41:05] the same chapter Deuteronomy 28 the Lord
[41:08] will scatter you among all peoples from
[41:11] one end of the earth to the other so
[41:12] then he says you'll be blessed in this
[41:14] way but if you leave the Word of God
[41:16] then all these curses will come upon you
[41:18] and you'll be scattered and so now a
[41:21] nation that thread all of a sudden
[41:22] they're scattered everywhere the people
[41:24] are dispersed around the world but it
[41:27] wasn't just that the people were
[41:28] scattered he also added in there
[41:31] Deuteronomy 29 22 that the land itself
[41:35] would become a burning waste unsewn and
[41:38] unproductive and no grass growing in it
[41:41] now these are prophets this is the
[41:42] prophecy says also the stranger will
[41:45] come from a far land and look at it and
[41:48] see the sickness upon it the land would
[41:51] become filled with diseases and plagues
[41:54] and I got these in front of me where he
[41:57] refers to these not only scattering
[42:00] these things but then a curse comes on
[42:02] the actual geographical land of the area
[42:05] where it says the desolate land will be
[42:08] cultivated instead of being desolation
[42:11] let me just go back here and just read
[42:14] this just a second here I wanted you to
[42:16] catch yeah he says here and do it on
[42:18] between in the land
[42:19] self-will become a burning waste unsewn
[42:22] unproductive and no grass growing in it
[42:24] the curse would be so terrible that when
[42:27] foreigners came to vent to the land they
[42:29] would cry out why has the Lord done what
[42:31] has the Lord done to this land why this
[42:34] great outburst of anger that's in
[42:36] Deuteronomy 29 and the answer will be
[42:38] because they forsook the covenant of the
[42:40] Lord and the God of their fathers so
[42:43] this is all scriptural references and it
[42:45] all took place in a cycle where Israel
[42:48] got away from the Lord and then they're
[42:50] not only now listen now I want you to
[42:52] catch this not only were they scattered
[42:54] and come away from God and their land
[42:56] their home and but their land became dry
[42:59] their land become desolate everything in
[43:01] their life begin to dry up and and that
[43:04] geographical place of Israel wasn't
[43:07] groaning grass there wasn't any trees it
[43:09] was it was an actual mess that was
[43:11] taking place and then the Bible refers
[43:14] to strangers traveling from abroad
[43:16] remember I read that strangers being
[43:18] sent to go view the land that happened
[43:21] according to prophecy because in night
[43:23] 18 1855 an American medical doctor
[43:27] Jonathan Meese traveled to the Holy Land
[43:29] and published his recollections
[43:31] recollections in a book called a journey
[43:33] to Egypt in Palestine and this was his
[43:36] words when he looked at Palestine at
[43:38] present nearly three thousand years
[43:40] after David the country is a prey to the
[43:43] wild beasts and to the wire beat
[43:46] Bedouins and of the inhabitants eat
[43:48] plants just enough to satisfy his
[43:52] greatest bodily wants all surplus the
[43:55] Boyden takes over and what he leaves
[43:57] behind the ruling Turk will confiscate
[44:00] moving head in 1867 12 years later an
[44:05] American journalist Mark Twain made a
[44:08] trip to Palestine he published it in the
[44:11] innocence of abroad and he says that he
[44:13] said describe Palestine as a blistering
[44:16] naked treeless land 1884 another
[44:20] American tourist Henry field now this is
[44:22] prophecy because it says the stranger
[44:24] they'll say send the stranger abroad
[44:27] with ships can you say man
[44:30] how specific the word of God is because
[44:33] that's the way they traveled back then
[44:34] and there there even the unbeliever is
[44:38] working according to the Word of God
[44:40] they don't even know what they were
[44:42] doing when they got on a boat to come
[44:44] across there but they're walking in the
[44:46] vision praise the Lord and so he wrote
[44:49] about he says the country seemed
[44:51] deserted of human Abaddon habitations
[44:53] this is 1884 deserted of human
[44:57] habitations its appearance was made
[44:59] still more desolate by being without
[45:01] trees while riding among the hills I did
[45:04] not a sink see a single tree whether
[45:06] this be owing to the government tax on
[45:08] trees or the wastefulness of the people
[45:10] and cutting for fuel every young tree
[45:12] almost as soon as it grows its head
[45:14] above the ground I know not I only state
[45:16] the fact that the landscape was
[45:18] absolutely treeless goes on to say in
[45:21] 1912 he said another one describes it's
[45:25] practically tree list such hedges are
[45:27] exist are mostly prickly cactus the
[45:29] villages past are secret to looking
[45:31] clumps of flat and that goes on the city
[45:34] itself is the shadow of a rock and a
[45:36] weary land with the exception of a few
[45:38] pallet off olive trees a patch here and
[45:41] there of indefinite green and melancholy
[45:45] Cypress the errands of Jerusalem are
[45:47] dusty like a limestone waste I think
[45:52] that's enough to let you know I
[45:53] witnesses the scripture says send I
[45:55] witnesses what God said came to pass a
[45:58] thriving land a thirsting place under
[46:02] Solomon a flourishing place and then it
[46:05] becomes a desolation but God had another
[46:10] word for God had a word of restoration I
[46:16] remember a word of restoration coming up
[46:19] in Joel where he says the years that the
[46:23] cankerworm has taken the caterpillar of
[46:25] day and begins to eat that broad tree
[46:28] and broad roses it takes the fellowship
[46:30] it takes the doctrine it takes the bark
[46:32] off it drinks it down right to a stop
[46:35] and then sucks the very life out of it
[46:37] prophecy for the church chapter tool
[46:40] Joel says but I will restore save the
[46:43] Lord all the years everything that's
[46:47] didn't destroyed I'm gonna restore it
[46:48] all that's our God friends I don't know
[46:52] what you've lost here tonight but God
[46:54] says he restored back to you because
[46:57] he's a God of restoration I pray that's
[47:01] a blessing to you we can close the
[47:02] service and shout right now you're under
[47:04] a word restoration you're under a word
[47:08] of restoration this message is a message
[47:11] of restoration this this isn't a new
[47:16] denomination
[47:17] this isn't do's and don'ts this isn't
[47:21] just something with a dress code this is
[47:23] a prophecy this is a word to restore our
[47:27] lives back everything's lost will be
[47:30] recovered
[47:31] that's the message unless it be his name
[47:37] we're under a word of restoration so now
[47:43] when this desolation took place for
[47:45] Israel it culminated in Rome it's a
[47:48] little history here finishing them off
[47:50] in AD 70 until there was nothing less
[47:53] the temple was destroyed
[47:55] no nation it was cut off from Rouen 80
[47:57] 70 they were driven out from that point
[48:00] on the place become nothing for almost
[48:02] 1800 years no more flag or identity in
[48:06] the world people scattered all over the
[48:08] world Rome was used to do it the same
[48:11] thing happens the spiritual church Rome
[48:13] was used to take the spirit out of the
[48:15] church can you say man but I want you to
[48:19] see the miracle of where Israel is at
[48:21] today she has not only survived
[48:25] impossible odds to become a nation again
[48:29] just the odds to become a nation was
[48:33] supernatural that they can even be
[48:35] called a nation today have their own
[48:37] flag have their own nation it was a
[48:40] supernatural God there was no way
[48:42] possible for that to take place because
[48:44] they had no identity in the world and
[48:47] besides that Satan's persecution against
[48:49] them
[48:50] if that would been in charge they would
[48:51] have never been allowed to have a nation
[48:53] there's several and United Nations that
[48:56] want to dissolve her now they want to
[48:58] get rid of her there's enemies still of
[49:01] Israel can you say man
[49:02] whatever statistic I read the other than
[49:04] I can't remember how high it's risen
[49:05] even in the last five years the the the
[49:08] hatred towards the Jews anti-semitism
[49:11] raising that's the spirit of the age
[49:14] it's the persecution it's two thousand
[49:17] thousand demons against the spiritual
[49:19] elected seed natural seed the spiritual
[49:22] seed so you guys know you the message so
[49:25] i don't i just need refer to these
[49:27] things because i know you're picking up
[49:28] on it so now she has struck she has not
[49:31] only survived all odds but now she's not
[49:35] just survived to get into become a
[49:37] nation after seven years she's thriving
[49:40] as one of the top nations now we're
[49:42] talking about naturally now okay
[49:45] a lot of in israel aren't believers
[49:46] spiritually things I don't have the Holy
[49:48] Ghost but God deals with them as a
[49:50] nation as a nation the prophecy was
[49:52] fulfilled they're actually thriving is
[49:54] one of the greatest nations economically
[49:57] geographically our agricultural e
[50:00] they're leading the field in medicine
[50:03] they said they're only a few years to
[50:06] discovering the cure for cancer
[50:08] Israel thriving because the word says
[50:13] she will so she had no identity in the
[50:17] world secret people all over the world
[50:19] holding to the original word that Moses
[50:21] gave but now has become the most
[50:23] powerful military in the Middle East and
[50:26] an economy that's in the top five of the
[50:29] world
[50:29] she has risen in the most shaky times
[50:31] with much of the world against her from
[50:34] the start
[50:35] does that sound like anybody here
[50:36] tonight she has risen with much of the
[50:40] world against her against all odds all
[50:45] kinds of nations and people and
[50:47] governments against her become a nation
[50:50] against her prospering and despite what
[50:52] the devil could do militarily in every
[50:54] way she's risen to the top
[50:58] I'll tell you if you're under the Word
[50:59] of God there ain't nothin gonna stop you
[51:03] [Applause]
[51:05] you say well I don't feel very much like
[51:08] that tonight on this Wednesday night it
[51:10] doesn't matter how you feel
[51:11] it's the word that you're under it's
[51:15] what you're carrying can you say man
[51:19] it wasn't about Mary Mary it was about
[51:22] what she was carrying why God chose Mary
[51:27] wasn't about Mary it's who she was
[51:29] carrying a man so she's come through all
[51:36] this and the world's guest comes and
[51:38] there's only one reason there's a
[51:39] prophecy over them people spoken by the
[51:42] prophets of the Bible it's gonna come to
[51:44] pass it is coming to pass nothing can
[51:47] stand in the way of God's Word being
[51:49] fulfilled if you're living your life
[51:51] right now with just a little bit of
[51:53] Bible religion that's not enough but
[51:57] when you're living in obedience to the
[51:59] original Word of God under the word of
[52:01] prophets and the prophets word for this
[52:03] age it's gonna be fulfilled in you
[52:05] against all that's what this Bible is
[52:07] this is a Bible that's full of prophets
[52:10] spoke in the word of the Lord that's
[52:13] what your Bible is people are against
[52:14] Prophet sure it gets prophets the whole
[52:16] Bible is mostly prophets even in the New
[52:19] Testament that's how God brought his
[52:21] word and when he spoke that through the
[52:23] mouth of a prophet that's his word and
[52:26] it will come to pass should be his name
[52:31] so they live by the original word and
[52:35] Adam and Eve you know Adam and Eve
[52:37] didn't have a Bible but they live by the
[52:40] original spoken word of God and that was
[52:43] their life until the serpent injected
[52:46] other ideas Adam II need have no Bible
[52:49] they were living by the word spoken and
[52:53] they lived in an Eden just by living by
[52:56] the word spoken prospering so now at the
[53:00] end time when these wheels of prophecy
[53:02] for Israel begin to turn in the
[53:04] restoration now the the wheels of
[53:06] prophecy they go slow but then when they
[53:10] begin to turn
[53:11] now we see these prophecies for
[53:13] restoration begin to turn before 1948
[53:16] when the United Nations recognized them
[53:19] as a nation before that time some
[53:21] strange things started to happen in the
[53:23] world events and we understand these
[53:26] things in events in the World War one
[53:28] and World War two because of the message
[53:30] we understand the spiritual meaning of
[53:32] why those things took place
[53:33] we had a prophet take world war two and
[53:36] bring an understanding to it
[53:37] that none of this world understands they
[53:40] don't know the purpose of those wars but
[53:42] in God's eyes that was a purpose I'll
[53:43] tell you the purpose his word had to be
[53:45] fulfilled that the people that he had
[53:47] scattered now there's a word says I'm
[53:49] gonna gather you all so now all these
[53:53] men are being held in the in the in the
[53:55] end the hand of God as they begin to
[53:58] fulfill these things and you see the
[54:01] focus of the war on the dictators side
[54:04] was mainly one thing the persecution and
[54:07] the extermination of a group of people
[54:10] so these men especially in World War two
[54:12] the when you look what's the perp was
[54:15] the purpose of war was that denominates
[54:16] the world be a dictator of the world you
[54:18] can read Hitler's focus you can read
[54:21] these dictators hooks and the main focus
[54:23] the the persecution and the was the
[54:26] person and the complete extermination of
[54:29] this group of people the Jews other wars
[54:34] had different agendas but this one was
[54:37] focused against God's elect there was
[54:44] always a hatred and jealousy against to
[54:46] use the Jews why because they're God's
[54:49] favor to people he gave the promises to
[54:53] those people they're always hated as
[54:55] they are still today it's incredible in
[54:58] a world that has such tolerance for
[55:00] everybody
[55:01] there's still a hatred for the Jews and
[55:06] for true Holy Ghost fill Christians
[55:09] in a world that tolerates the
[55:13] homosexuals and everybody still hold a
[55:16] hatred for the Jews let trump pass some
[55:20] laws and let trump move the the
[55:22] headquarters for our embassy to
[55:24] Jerusalem and let them make a few moves
[55:26] and it just it just erupts the hatred
[55:28] for that what's going on you're supposed
[55:31] to be tolerating you're supposed to
[55:32] allow everybody everybody supposed to
[55:34] have a part here not the Jews why it's a
[55:36] spiritual meeting its hatred in their
[55:38] heart towards God's elect he's a lord
[55:43] that's right I hope you've seen yourself
[55:45] in this tonight so always been hatred
[55:48] but it's God's favored people and so
[55:50] it's because you carry the word so now I
[55:54] got to move on here so I can be short
[55:55] like I said the low girl coming in
[55:58] sister Ellen's uh baby granddaughter
[56:01] there said she loves to come to church
[56:04] except when it's lone I love an honest
[56:07] girl like that I love it Kennedy thank
[56:10] you for being honest I feel the same way
[56:13] sometimes thank you so that was just a
[56:16] little hint to the preacher I love you
[56:20] honey good I like that I like you having
[56:22] a good time you have a good time okay
[56:24] she was having a good time too I just
[56:26] embarrassed her
[56:27] praise the Lord so now the hatred has
[56:31] always been there but just before the
[56:34] prophecies fulfilled that her inside
[56:36] will be lifted up there's a huge
[56:39] increase in the hatred to the extreme
[56:41] Hitler's agenda was not to be a world
[56:44] leader but Hitler's main agenda was to
[56:47] kill and exterminate God's people and
[56:52] I've got a reading there for someone
[56:54] with what it was head generals and he
[56:57] explains that perfect am i gonna read it
[56:58] tonight he explains it where this was
[57:00] Hitler's agenda this is what he wanted
[57:02] to do the Jews would be exterminated
[57:08] who put that spirit on him who did that
[57:10] what's he being motivated by it wasn't
[57:15] just a personal thing with Hitler
[57:17] something is happening
[57:19] prophecies getting ready to be fulfilled
[57:22] the Prophet pointed us to the scripture
[57:24] what's happening in seven trumpets
[57:26] he said that seven trumpets are for
[57:28] Israel is the same as a seventh seal for
[57:30] us and he speaks of it in the trumpets
[57:32] he says now notice the trumpets are
[57:34] speaking of as a call together for
[57:36] either a feast or for some person or
[57:39] some sacred day and you got the
[57:42] background of the seals in the church
[57:43] now we're going to go into the trumpet
[57:44] the trumpet sounded the trumpet denotes
[57:46] either war or feast day or what it means
[57:48] it's a gathering together the people God
[57:51] uses a war to gather his people if your
[57:54] life is having a bunch of war well he's
[57:57] getting you closer to he's bringing you
[57:59] closer to himself it's all war going on
[58:02] in your life it's a good thing you're
[58:04] being driven closer to the Lord
[58:05] you're being driven on your knees boy
[58:10] you should look around say boy there's
[58:11] war going on everywhere but I know what
[58:14] God's doing praise the Lord
[58:16] so this gathering the trumpet denotes
[58:19] words that gathering together God's
[58:20] people when the trumpet is an uncertain
[58:23] sound who can to prepare themselves for
[58:24] war for peace whatever he who knows you
[58:26] have to know what the trumpet sounds
[58:28] therefore when the trumpet sounds we see
[58:30] something in the earth today there's a
[58:31] great trouble somewhere everybody knows
[58:33] that everybody has become a neurotic the
[58:36] war whole world is an erotical world and
[58:38] we know there's something wrong the
[58:40] Pentagon everywhere we know there's
[58:42] something wrong
[58:43] it's the feeling before this thing
[58:45] happens so notice with all this after
[58:48] the war ended three years later she
[58:52] still gets to put up her in sign and
[58:54] become a nation three years later yeah a
[58:57] war that was to exterminate the Jews and
[59:01] just years later she has her own flag
[59:04] and becomes a nation how does that
[59:06] happen
[59:06] you're under a prophesy you're under the
[59:10] word my it's a wonderful thing so not
[59:15] only that shall prosper now this writer
[59:17] says an Israeli the Israelis have a lot
[59:20] to celebrate in seventy short years the
[59:23] nation has developed from a cultural and
[59:25] economic wasteland to a global
[59:28] powerhouse in agriculture cyber
[59:31] technology and medical innovation
[59:33] Israel's economy
[59:35] has grown from three billion in 1948 to
[59:38] a whopping 300 billion today 70 years
[59:43] what am i preaching to you they're not
[59:46] just they haven't just survived they're
[59:48] thriving they're thriving as a nation
[59:52] and Israel's economy has grown from 3
[59:55] billion in 1940 to 300 billion today the
[59:58] population has ballooned from 800,000 in
[1:00:01] 1948 to 8 point 8 million in 2018 Israel
[1:00:05] has become a global technology
[1:00:07] technology hub called
[1:00:09] Silicon Wadi rivaling their American
[1:00:12] counterparts Silicon Valley and as both
[1:00:14] boosted tourism to an all-time high of
[1:00:17] 3.6 million visitors in 2017 out of the
[1:00:22] defensive neccessity its military ranks
[1:00:27] as one of the top five in the world
[1:00:29] praise the Lord blessed be his name for
[1:00:34] their entire history Jews have had to
[1:00:36] face constant danger and this may be the
[1:00:38] secret to their success as a nation they
[1:00:41] managed to turn adversity into an asset
[1:00:45] striving to survive they have thrived
[1:00:50] blessed be his name might mention this
[1:00:53] too to a land that had no water even up
[1:00:56] to ten years ago they had problems water
[1:00:57] with water they've turned the whole
[1:00:59] thing around until their whatever their
[1:01:01] envied by all the nations now how they
[1:01:04] fixed their water problem what they says
[1:01:07] now the country that is is is now a
[1:01:10] country that is 60% a country that was
[1:01:13] 60% desert and he was in population
[1:01:15] increased tenfold since 1948 not only
[1:01:18] has enough water for itself now but in
[1:01:21] fact has a surplus and even exports
[1:01:24] water to its neighbors in 1930s British
[1:01:27] economists predicted that all of
[1:01:29] Palestine including today's Gaza Israel
[1:01:31] in the West Bank had enough water to
[1:01:33] sustain 2 million people today the area
[1:01:36] is home to more than 12 million people a
[1:01:38] feat that psychoactive attributes to
[1:01:40] large part to Israel's first class water
[1:01:44] planning management the world's inven
[1:01:46] what have you
[1:01:47] all the places without what have you
[1:01:49] done and let me tell you something
[1:01:51] that's not because just the mentality a
[1:01:53] man that's not enough can you say men
[1:01:55] they're under a prophecy that the land
[1:01:58] that was desolate will be thriving and
[1:02:00] grow arrogation and grow trees that were
[1:02:03] no trees places the beautiful place
[1:02:05] brother Jack has been there it's a
[1:02:07] beautiful place the desert has blossomed
[1:02:09] my friend if your life has become a
[1:02:12] desert there's a word that can bring a
[1:02:14] blossom to your life it can thrive can
[1:02:17] you say man only God can take a desert
[1:02:21] and make it bloom with all the flowers
[1:02:23] and all the good things hallelujah
[1:02:26] blessed be his name you think it was the
[1:02:30] mentality the intellect of man that made
[1:02:32] the best water system in the world
[1:02:33] no they're under a prophesy can you say
[1:02:36] a man they're working under a prophesy
[1:02:39] God said I'll make that the best in the
[1:02:41] land again I'll give you water in the
[1:02:43] desert Oh blessed be his name blessed be
[1:02:48] his name and that wonderful so friends I
[1:02:51] wanted to tell you tonight I'm gonna I'm
[1:02:53] gonna be short I told you what I'm
[1:02:54] wrapping this up now because I think you
[1:02:57] got the thought listen we are God's we
[1:03:00] are God's elect spiritually speaking
[1:03:03] everything that's happened there has
[1:03:06] happened to the bride she become
[1:03:10] desolate spiritually when the church
[1:03:12] system took away the Spirit of God from
[1:03:14] the early church all the way after the
[1:03:16] Catholic Church first organized system
[1:03:18] all the way till until become the Dark
[1:03:20] Ages no Holy Spirit left in the church
[1:03:23] God says I will restore and that's not
[1:03:26] just as a people together because God
[1:03:28] deals with us in individuals he restores
[1:03:31] us as individuals
[1:03:34] everything that's lost what God will
[1:03:36] give back again
[1:03:37] even families even families
[1:03:42] Isaiah said the restoration of many
[1:03:44] generations so I'm jumping way ahead
[1:03:50] here to conclude for you tonight that
[1:03:52] you are God's people spiritually not
[1:03:54] just to restore now not just to restore
[1:03:58] the land of the Word of God because he's
[1:04:00] brought brought us back to his full
[1:04:02] promised land the word our inheritance
[1:04:06] in the word not just that though but he
[1:04:09] says that person in the position will
[1:04:12] prosper in everything that he does I'm
[1:04:15] gonna take a hold of that tonight and
[1:04:18] that of my motives are right and I'm
[1:04:19] under the right word despite my mistakes
[1:04:23] despite what I do intellectually that's
[1:04:25] failures if I'm under the right word and
[1:04:27] I'm believing it and I'm obeying it can
[1:04:30] you say man and I'm in that channel of
[1:04:32] the word and I'm doing my best to follow
[1:04:34] that word of God then that word is more
[1:04:36] powerful than my mistakes that word is
[1:04:39] going to lead and guide me blessed be
[1:04:43] his name I believe that with all my
[1:04:44] heart and I believe that do you that
[1:04:47] believers let me say it this way this is
[1:04:49] not in my notes this is the believer
[1:04:51] today under what God has given us
[1:04:53] through the restoration of the word the
[1:04:54] opening of the seals you are spiritual
[1:04:58] billionaires tonight in this shopping
[1:05:06] center at spirit and truth in this place
[1:05:11] with just 20 people here you are a
[1:05:15] spiritual billionaire
[1:05:18] [Applause]
[1:05:20] you are called to prosper
[1:05:24] first of all spiritually but not just
[1:05:28] spiritually cuz second John says I wish
[1:05:31] above all things that you prosper and be
[1:05:34] in health as your soul prospers it's
[1:05:38] talking about the bride it's not talking
[1:05:40] about the ungodly it's not talking about
[1:05:43] some person that's kind of a religion
[1:05:45] we're talking about God's Holy Ghost
[1:05:48] filled people my children I wish above
[1:05:52] all things that you prosper and be in
[1:05:54] health and this has nothing to do with
[1:05:59] what the TV preachers on a prosperity
[1:06:01] gospel they're only trying to take that
[1:06:04] and build up their own motive but
[1:06:05] they're not under the Word of God for
[1:06:07] this day they're not under the message
[1:06:08] but you are so those scriptures for
[1:06:12] prosperity it don't apply to some
[1:06:14] ungodly person it applies to you tonight
[1:06:17] yes yours
[1:06:19] [Applause]
[1:06:20] so if you if you do hear those TV
[1:06:24] preachers or you listen to those hear
[1:06:26] everything and they're going through all
[1:06:27] this process and using scriptures to do
[1:06:29] it you can sit there and say listen I'm
[1:06:32] one of the ones he's really talking
[1:06:34] about because I'm under the word that
[1:06:37] God's in in this hour praise be to God

[1:07:23] now don't stop giving your offerings and
[1:07:25] tithes that's not what I'm preaching cuz
[1:07:29] that's one of the ways you tap into
[1:07:30] God's blessings but it's not just that
[1:07:32] you give your tithes and offerings it's
[1:07:34] because you have tapped into the word of
[1:07:38] life for this hour and that's why you'll

[1:17:24] watching Israel and you know having the

[1:17:29] and I remember a quote that wanted a the
[1:17:33] Israelis said up I can't remember exact
[1:17:35] words but he talked about how Mark Twain
[1:17:37] made a comment when he when he when he
[1:17:40] went there he says it's no way he could
[1:17:42] see that as the land of milk and honey
[1:17:44] no way he could see it that way
[1:17:47] alright and and and and you go now and I
[1:17:50] remember going
[1:17:51] I mean fruit trees everywhere anything
[1:17:56] you anything you can think about growing
[1:17:57] there growing it and they're growing it
[1:17:59] in desert conditions I remember it's
[1:18:03] kind of being you know in the area of
[1:18:04] the Dead Sea and as we were driving
[1:18:06] along the road they had just a roll of
[1:18:08] palm trees and date trees and all kind
[1:18:10] of stuff like this all along there and
[1:18:12] you look at the end and the soil is like
[1:18:14] how does anything grow in this soil
