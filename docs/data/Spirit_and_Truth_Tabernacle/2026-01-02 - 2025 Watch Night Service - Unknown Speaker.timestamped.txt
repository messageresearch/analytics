[12:00] God bless you, church.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; I want to thank God because he protected
[12:04] me from a car accident um yesterday on
[12:07] my way back home after work. I want to
[12:10] thank him for that. Um
[12:14] I saw um the car was coming on my back
[12:18] and then I'm like, where is this car
[12:21] going? because it was
[12:24] uh wash hours so there was a lot of car
[12:26] in the street. I'm like where you going?
[12:28] I don't know how it just pass and then
[12:31] I'm like where? There's a car right next
[12:33] to me. I don't know where the car how he
[12:36] can go. I'm like if that car hit me I
[12:39] wouldn't make it. I I know I wouldn't
[12:41] make it because he was driving really
[12:43] fast and I really thank God for that.
[12:46] And then even when I get to the
[12:48] community, another co I'm like, "Oh, let
[12:50] me go home because I have service too."
[12:53] And then I want to see the next year. So
[12:55] I thank God for that. He protected me
[12:57] and my family. Thank you.
[13:01] [applause]
[13:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [applause]
[13:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is a protector.
[13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your purpose is your protection.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Does anybody else have a testimony
[13:18] you like to share tonight?
[13:22] God bless you, Sister Sarah.
[13:30] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[13:33] I just want to thank God for keeping me
[13:34] this year. It's a definitely a trying
[13:37] year by the way. It was definitely a
[13:39] trying year um with just trying to
[13:42] balance school and work and just life
[13:44] and responsibilities was definitely was
[13:46] a lot on on [snorts] me mentally and
[13:48] just physically just definitely very
[13:50] tired. But um the scripture that I was
[13:52] holding on to this year was um I think
[13:55] it's Joel 2:21. I should have had my
[13:56] phone but um it's a scripture that says
[14:00] be glad and rejoice land for the Lord
[14:02] will do great things. And of course you
[14:04] know the rest of that chapter is we have
[14:07] as a church have been holding on to when
[14:09] it comes to restoration. And so I
[14:13] definitely saw a lot of restoration in
[14:15] my life in different areas, not only
[14:17] just for me, but in family members. I've
[14:19] had cousins and just old friends
[14:21] reaching out talking about how they want
[14:23] to, you know, get back to serving God.
[14:25] And um even just, you know, seeing
[14:28] restoration within my immediate family
[14:30] with my sister and her husband. um
[14:33] restoration and finances or even just
[14:35] provision and finances because it was a
[14:37] lot of times I didn't know how I was
[14:39] going to make it. But God really just,
[14:41] you know, he made a way out of now way
[14:43] for me this year. And I just thank him
[14:44] for restoration even in my spiritual
[14:46] life, you know, giving me the joy of my
[14:47] salvation and just, you know, taking me
[14:51] from the beginning of the year to the
[14:52] end of this year. And just honestly,
[14:54] when I tell you I don't know how I made
[14:55] it, I really don't know how I made it.
[14:57] [laughter]
[14:58] Um, another thing that I really want to
[15:00] thank God for was something that um was
[15:04] just something I desired. It wasn't not
[15:06] necessarily a big thing, but it's just
[15:08] something that I really desired. And one
[15:09] of those was uh um in school I wanted to
[15:13] get all A's one semester. And so I was
[15:15] able to do this this last semester. I
[15:17] didn't have bad grades the other
[15:18] semesters. It's just something I really
[15:20] wanted in order to have honors when I
[15:22] graduate. Um, so I just I thank God for
[15:25] that because even though it's seems
[15:26] small and it's like I wouldn't have
[15:28] failed either way, but it's just
[15:30] something I really wanted. Um, so I
[15:32] thank God for that. I have two more
[15:33] classes to go and then I'll be done.
[15:35] Thank God. UM, [applause]
[15:41] and I definitely want to give him the
[15:43] thanks for giving me the ability to pay
[15:45] to go to school because I really didn't
[15:47] want any student loans. Um, so I thank
[15:50] God honestly for providing a way for me
[15:53] and I definitely didn't lack and I just
[15:54] thank God so much for that. Um, that was
[15:57] it. God bless you.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [applause]
[16:04] The Lord is good.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sure we all have a testimony
[16:10] &gt;&gt; about what the Lord brought us. Sister,
[16:13] come on, sister.
[16:23] God bless you.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; I want to thank God for bringing me, my
[16:27] family through this year. For me
[16:29] personally, it was incredibly rough. Um,
[16:32] very painful. Not painful. Yeah, painful
[16:36] at some parts, but mainly just hard. I
[16:38] had to deal with passing my program and
[16:40] my job was giving me really hard time.
[16:43] Um, they were cutting my hours.
[16:47] Oh, they've been cutting my hours and I
[16:50] just can't afford that being in school.
[16:52] So, after graduating, um, I was applying
[16:55] to different jobs and today I got hired
[16:58] a new job AND
[17:01] [applause]
[17:06] my other job texted me and said that
[17:08] they actually don't need me to come in
[17:10] tomorrow because the census is low. And
[17:12] I said, actually, just take me off the
[17:14] schedule.
[17:15] So for good. [applause] SO
[17:21] &gt;&gt; YEAH, I'm very thankful for God.
[17:25] [applause]
[17:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; I believe I want to testify.

[17:36] this.

[30:07] Hallelujah.
[30:10] The testimony of the man that tasted a
[30:13] piece of watermelon, he said it was
[30:16] good. They asked him how was it. He said
[30:17] that was good. He said, "But it's got to
[30:19] be more that come from."
[30:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the way we feel about our
[30:24] God. We thank him for all he did this
[30:25] year, but it's got to be more where that
[30:28] came from.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me just read a couple
[30:32] scriptures. Amen. Uh for tonight, and
[30:35] then I'll let you be seated. Um we are
[30:40] going to the book of Joel, uh which was
[30:43] a scripture that has carried us for
[30:46] roughly two years. and and as um the
[30:50] last time I spoke um uh at church, I
[30:54] didn't finish uh one sermon, and we'll
[30:56] get to that later on. Uh but I had
[30:59] something else I just wanted to share
[31:01] here uh tonight, and then um uh we'll
[31:04] we'll move on. But let's let's read Joel
[31:07] 1 uh and then verse 4 and then we'll go
[31:11] to verse chapter 2. It says in verse 4,
[31:14] chapter 1 says, "That which the palmer
[31:16] worm hath left hath the locust eaten,
[31:19] and that which the locust hath left,
[31:21] hath the cankerworm eaten, and that
[31:22] which the cankworm had left, hath have
[31:25] the caterpillar eaten."
[31:27] Over in chapter 2, uh, starting at
[31:30] verse, uh, 21.
[31:33] Amen. Thank God for his promises. Uh,
[31:37] fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice,
[31:40] for the Lord will do great things.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Uh, be not afraid, ye beasts of the
[31:46] field, for the pastures of the
[31:49] wilderness do spring, for the tree
[31:51] beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the
[31:53] vine do yield their strength. Be glad
[31:56] then, you children of Zion, and rejoice
[31:58] in the Lord your God, for he hath given
[32:01] you the former rain moderately, and he
[32:04] will cause to come down for you the
[32:06] rain, the former rain, and the latter
[32:08] rain in the first month, and the and the
[32:12] floor shall be full of wheat, and the
[32:14] fats shall overflow with wine and oil.
[32:20] Uh, we know God did that.
[32:23] We know God did that. Uh, and I will
[32:27] restore to you the years that the locust
[32:30] hath eaten, the canker worm, and the
[32:32] caterpillar and the palmer worm, my
[32:34] great army, which I sent among you. And
[32:36] ye shall eat in plenty
[32:38] &gt;&gt; and be satisfied. And praise the name of
[32:41] the Lord your God, that have dealt
[32:43] wondrously with you, and my people shall
[32:46] never be ashamed. Ye shall know that I
[32:48] am in the midst of Israel, and that I am
[32:50] the Lord your God. And none else, and my
[32:53] people shall never be ashamed. And it
[32:55] shall come to pass afterward that I will
[32:57] pour out my spirit uh upon all flesh,
[33:01] and your sons and your daughters shall
[33:03] prophesy. Your old men shall dream
[33:04] dreams, your young men shall see
[33:06] visions, and also upon the servants, and
[33:08] upon the handmmaids. In those days will
[33:10] I pour out my spirit. uh says, "And I
[33:13] will show wonders in the heavens and the
[33:15] earth, blood and fire and pillars of
[33:17] smoke. The sun shall be turned into
[33:19] darkness and the moon uh into blood
[33:22] before the great and terrible day of the
[33:24] Lord come. And it shall come to pass
[33:26] that whosoever shall call on the name of
[33:27] the Lord shall be delivered. For in
[33:29] Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be
[33:31] deliverance as the Lord hath said uh and
[33:35] in the remnant whom the Lord shall
[33:37] call." Let's pray quickly. Father, we
[33:39] thank you for the ability to read the
[33:43] scripture. We pray the Holy Spirit would
[33:45] just make uh the word alive to us even
[33:48] tonight that God you would just minister
[33:50] to uh every heart. Um and uh just uh
[33:53] those present, those that are online uh
[33:56] just for remember each one, Father, in
[33:58] their respective places. We thank you

[34:02] year and God you have provided uh over
[34:05] and over for us Lord and we're just
[34:07] grateful for your goodness for your
[34:09] mercy that has been given to us and Lord
[34:11] we just uh we could never repay you for
[34:15] all the the great things that you've
[34:17] done uh for us. So we pray that you
[34:19] bless Lord this this portion of the
[34:21] service. It's in Jesus name we pray.
[34:23] Amen. Amen. God bless. You can be
[34:25] seated. Uh just let me give um um uh my
[34:31] greeting from uh from Ghana. Amen. Many
[34:36] of the saints sensed the greeting uh to
[34:38] you and uh we certainly had a wonderful
[34:41] time while we were there. Uh as we were
[34:44] preparing to go, we were supposed to
[34:46] leave on Sunday. Uh right after service,
[34:49] we jumped in the car to go to the uh
[34:52] airport and we got there and uh when we
[34:55] were trying to check in and give our
[34:58] luggage to the uh counter, they told us
[35:01] that uh hey, you need um you need a
[35:05] visa. I said, "Well, no. I've been to
[35:07] Ghana times and typically we get the
[35:10] visa on arrival." They said, "No, not
[35:13] this time. You're going to need the visa
[35:14] before you go." and they say you're
[35:16] going to need to, you know, um, go to
[35:19] this website, you're going to need to do
[35:20] this. And so they talking, my wife went
[35:22] to the website and found out that the
[35:25] process would be months before we get
[35:28] that visa. And uh, I said, "Look, uh,
[35:31] that ain't going to work. We need we
[35:33] need something different, you know, some
[35:35] other option here." And uh, so calls
[35:38] begin to be made. Uh, brother Quinton
[35:40] was all set. He was already getting on
[35:42] the plane and taking off. And uh me and
[35:44] my wife and sister Sarah was stuck right
[35:46] here. And and but we made some phone
[35:48] calls and found out on the other side uh
[35:52] we had a a brother uh that used to be
[35:54] brother Quinton's pastor up in um in in
[35:58] in Maryland. His name um brother
[36:01] Augustine. He had some connections and
[36:04] he uh began to he said in the morning
[36:06] we'll have your have your visas the
[36:09] numbers to you in the morning. I said
[36:10] well that that'll be fine. Uh, so we
[36:13] rebooked for to leave out on Tuesday and
[36:15] just waiting on things to get settled on
[36:17] on on um on Monday. And finally on
[36:20] Monday, the pastor got involved and he
[36:22] made a few phone calls and and they had
[36:25] them visa numbers to us in about two
[36:26] hours.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[36:31] AMEN.
[36:32] [applause]
[36:34] So by the grace of God, we got on the
[36:38] plane. I got it all We got it sorted out
[36:40] on Monday. got on the plane and made it
[36:42] there on uh on uh we left Tuesday, made
[36:45] it there on Wednesday. Uh and uh you
[36:48] know and it was just um you know really
[36:51] my we we we kind of hit the ground
[36:53] running and um you know and just we just
[36:57] we thank God we had a fight going and
[37:00] then a fight coming back home and uh so
[37:03] we we got you know through the services
[37:06] and had a wonderful time you know with
[37:07] the saints. But when we finished the
[37:10] last service, we, you know, we get on
[37:12] the plane to come home and and we
[37:14] noticed that they've changed our route,
[37:16] you know, on the plane and we were
[37:19] supposed to fly from Ghana to back to
[37:21] Atlanta. Well, they say they're going to
[37:23] take us to New York and then to Atlanta
[37:25] and and and then we'll come home. Well,
[37:28] because of the changing of the route, we
[37:32] missed our connecting flight in Atlanta
[37:35] to be able to get home on Monday. And uh
[37:38] so we're, you know, we get there almost
[37:41] midnight into Atlanta. Uh and um you
[37:45] know, everything's closed, you know,
[37:46] pretty much. So um we uh we said, "Okay,
[37:50] well, you know what? What's what do we
[37:52] need to do here?" And they said, "Well,
[37:54] we can give you a hotel room." And and I
[37:56] said, "Okay." I say, "My flight is 7:00
[38:00] the next morning. Um I really don't want
[38:03] to have to go to a hotel and then come
[38:05] back here at 5:00 in the morning. I'm
[38:07] only get about 4 hours in the hotel. I
[38:09] say, "Do y'all have a a day room or
[38:11] something I can use?" I said, "We don't
[38:13] we don't provide them. Y'all need to
[38:15] provide them cuz uh so we decided we'll
[38:18] go ahead and try to take the hotel." But
[38:21] my god,
[38:23] uh, we weren't prepared for the weather.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; And we went out there trying to wait on
[38:30] the buses to take us to the hotel. And
[38:32] and as we got out there and I'm in that
[38:34] weather and I said, "Lord Jesus, I don't
[38:38] know what it was, but it was cold."
[38:42] And uh, and I How much was it?
[38:45] &gt;&gt; 30 30 something. I ain't have nothing to
[38:49] deal with. No. 30° weather and uh and
[38:52] that that cold hit your body,
[38:55] &gt;&gt; everything be
[38:59] &gt;&gt; and I stood out there and the bus didn't
[39:01] come and y'all know I'm getting my
[39:04] patience level as I get older start
[39:06] dropping where the bus at. And I said,
[39:10] "Okay, that's it. I'm going back into
[39:12] the airport. I'm going just have to
[39:14] sleep in the airport." But they had us
[39:16] wait about 40 minutes in that cold. And
[39:19] I felt it all all over. So, uh you know,
[39:23] but we made it, you know, we went back
[39:25] and slept on the floor in the um in in
[39:28] the in the airport.
[39:30] And uh
[39:33] we tried to sneak into the what do they
[39:36] call that?
[39:37] &gt;&gt; The chapel.
[39:39] It was warm in that chapel. And we went
[39:42] in that chapel and found ourselves a
[39:44] back of the chapel. And and I I told I
[39:46] told y'all be sleeping in church. So,
[39:48] y'all might as well sleep, right?
[39:54] But somebody come and kicked us out the
[39:56] chapel.
[39:58] I said, "Lord have mercy. Devil just
[40:00] fighting." So, you know, we finally get
[40:02] through the TSA and and and get on the
[40:05] plane and and we get all the way here
[40:07] and and when I get here, um I noticed
[40:10] that my luggage is the only luggage
[40:12] missing.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; I said, "Boy, that devil, he going to
[40:16] fight. But uh God gave us a victory.
[40:20] They brought my luggage to my house and
[40:21] and and and and we made it through. So I
[40:24] tell you sometimes you you go on trips
[40:26] like this and you know and it ain't all
[40:28] fun and games. You got to be ready for a
[40:31] trial, you know, but God brings us
[40:34] through and you know he gets all the
[40:36] glory no matter what. So we we're we're
[40:38] happy just to be back home. Amen. And
[40:41] and and and and they say ain't no place
[40:43] like home. I I say amen to that. Amen to
[40:47] that. But but it's good to be be back
[40:49] here. Amen. So, um I heard Sister Kesha
[40:54] earlier. God bless you. So good to have
[40:56] you with us. Amen. On on tonight.
[40:58] [applause] Praise the Lord.
[41:01] Amen. My sister, so good to see you,
[41:03] Sister Gina. Amen. Tonight. And
[41:06] [applause]
[41:07] and and brother Derek, God bless you.
[41:10] Amen. So good to see you tonight,
[41:12] brother. Praise [applause] God. Amen.
[41:15] Um, we have a just a a little something
[41:18] that I that I I have uh uh the Lord just
[41:21] kind of put in my heart to to do
[41:23] tonight. Uh I will be sharing just a
[41:26] little bit here um on a little thought.
[41:30] Easter for the bride. Amen. Easter for
[41:33] the bride. Uh but uh I will only go so
[41:38] far and then I am going to um turn this
[41:44] mic over to brother Simba. Amen. And and
[41:47] brother Simba is going to recap
[41:51] uh the last two years of this our
[41:54] restore sayeth the Lord. Get back in
[41:57] step. So he's going to recap that. So if
[42:00] you all would just bear with me, let me
[42:02] just give you just a little bit here of
[42:05] this Easter for the bride. We have read
[42:09] our scripture here out of Joel 1 as well
[42:12] as Joel 2. And uh when I think of the
[42:15] word Easter, uh Easter to me is the very
[42:19] thing that separates Christianity from
[42:22] any other religion. Amen. And no matter
[42:25] what people call themselves following,
[42:28] Easter is where Jesus proved who he was.
[42:33] Amen. He he said certain things, amen,
[42:37] out of his mouth, certain prophecies.
[42:39] But when Easter occurred, it actually
[42:41] proved that he was who he said he was.
[42:45] Amen. Uh there is many uh people that
[42:48] follow some leader like we follow Christ
[42:51] but their leader is in a grave somewhere
[42:54] and has not risen again. But Jesus said
[42:57] uh in John 2:19 he said um Jesus
[43:01] answered and said to them, "Destroy this
[43:03] temple and in three days I will raise it
[43:07] up." Hallelujah. And in three days he
[43:10] did exactly what he said. In Matthew
[43:13] 17:22, it says, "And while they abode in
[43:16] Galilee, Jesus said unto them, the Son
[43:19] of Man shall be betrayed into the hands
[43:21] of man, and they shall kill him, and the
[43:24] third day he shall be raised again." And
[43:27] they were exceeding sorry. But uh when
[43:30] he told them in that prophecy that he'd
[43:32] be raised in 3 days and he manifested
[43:35] it, hallelujah, at the resurrection, uh
[43:38] then we know Jesus proved who he said he
[43:42] was. Now there were certain scriptures
[43:44] that I just read here in Matthew 17 and
[43:47] John 2. Uh these scriptures were
[43:49] pertaining to uh Jesus rising from the
[43:53] dead. Amen. We can look back on it and
[43:55] see that now a prophecy went forth and
[43:58] then it was manifested when he got up on
[44:00] the third day. Hallelujah. But I'm here
[44:02] tonight to also just mention to you that
[44:06] just as there were scriptures uh for our
[44:09] Lord Jesus to manifest, there are also
[44:12] scriptures that will be manifested by
[44:14] the bride.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:18] Amen. There is an Easter that comes for
[44:22] the bride. There's a resurrection time
[44:25] that comes for the bride. The same way
[44:27] it happened for the bridegroom, it also
[44:30] happens for the bride.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I can tell you over the last
[44:36] two years, there's been some people that
[44:38] have experienced their own personal eas.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. They come up out of some things
[44:43] that the devil might have had them bound
[44:45] in. Hallelujah. But tonight, when you
[44:48] look back, Amen. on how far God brought
[44:50] you, Amen. You can say I had my own
[44:53] Easter.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Just like the devil can
[44:57] hold him down. Amen. The devil can hold
[45:00] you down.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Just like the devil can hold him back,
[45:04] the devil can't hold you back. Amen. You
[45:07] got joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Despite your test, despite
[45:13] your trials, Amen. You still got joy.
[45:16] Hey, after all the things that I'VE BEEN
[45:19] THROUGH, HEY, I STILL GOT JOY.
[45:23] [cheering]
[45:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It's because I've had MY OWN
[45:27] PERSONAL EASTER.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; There there are scriptures that pertain
[45:36] to the bride.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're identified in this. And
[45:40] sometimes you don't even realize that
[45:42] you're a part of, amen, what God has
[45:44] spoken as prophecy in the scripture. We
[45:47] don't even realize we're included in
[45:48] that. And when you are included, I'M
[45:51] TALKING ABOUT IN GOD'S MIND THAT HE HAD
[45:54] YOU INCLUDED IN THAT SCRIPTURE. He might
[45:56] not have wrote your specific name.
[45:59] Hallelujah. But you CAN TELL THAT THAT
[46:01] SCRIPTURE BELONGS to you.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. AMEN.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; IN JOEL 2:25,
[46:09] AMEN. AND IT SAYS, "I will restore to
[46:12] you." WHO IS TO YOU?
[46:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It might not HAVE YOUR
[46:16] SPECIFIC NAME, BUT YOU KNOW IT BELONGS
[46:19] TO YOU.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'LL RESTORE TO YOU the
[46:23] years that the locust hath eaten. The
[46:25] cankerorm and the caliper, the palmer,
[46:28] my great army which I sent amongst you.
[46:30] This is your scripture.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; It has to be FULFILLED IN YOUR DAY.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S a it's a Easter OR
[46:37] RESURRECTION FOR THE PRIDE. HE SAYS,
[46:39] "AND YE SHALL EAT IN PLENTY."
[46:41] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. And when I tell you
[46:44] that that that that probably stood more
[46:46] out to me during our meetings because,
[46:49] you know, we had a a few people that was
[46:51] concerned about who was preaching.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who's going to preach the
[46:54] meetings? And I never let nobody know
[46:56] who preaching.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; The reason I do that is because I want
[46:59] you to come under expectation.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; If I give you the name to it, then you
[47:03] can kind of decide, you know, I don't
[47:06] know if I want to hear that brother or
[47:07] not. No, I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE THAT
[47:09] KIND OF SPIRIT. JUST JUST COME JUST
[47:11] KNOWING THAT THE HOLY GHOST GOING to
[47:13] take over THE MEETING.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT BUT THE ONE THING I CAN
[47:16] TELL THE PEOPLE IS THAT WE'RE UNDER
[47:19] AMEN. an inspiration for our meetings.
[47:21] And what the Lord HAS TOLD US IS THAT YE
[47:24] SHALL EAT IN PLENTY.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU FOR TWO YEARS
[47:28] WE'VE BEEN EATING IN PLENTY.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; AND NOT ONLY DID IT SAY WE'LL eat in
[47:32] plenty, SAYS YOU'RE GOING TO BE
[47:34] SATISFIED.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. AND BE SATISFIED AND
[47:38] PRAISE the name of the Lord your God
[47:40] THAT HAVE DEALT WONDROUSLY WITH you and
[47:43] my people shall never be made ashamed.
[47:45] Another scripture that belongs to you in
[47:48] this hour. Hallelujah. JUST AS JESUS HAD
[47:52] SCRIPTURES connected to him, I'm telling
[47:54] you, there are scriptures that are
[47:55] connected to you as the bride of Christ.
[47:57] Another scripture is Malachi 4:5 and 6.
[48:01] Behold, I will send
[48:03] &gt;&gt; you.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who is you?
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And behold, I was sending you,
[48:08] ELIJAH.
[48:10] WELL, WHAT THIS TELLS ME THAT ELIJAH
[48:12] DIDN'T COME FOR EVERYBODY.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; ELIJAH ONLY CAME TO YOU.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY YOURSELF
[48:20] IN THE SCRIPTURE, THEN YOU KNOW GOD WAS
[48:22] SPEAKING of you.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet
[48:28] before the coming of the great and
[48:30] dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall
[48:32] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[48:34] children, and the heart of the children
[48:36] to their fathers, lest I come and smite
[48:38] the earth with a curse. THESE ARE
[48:40] SCRIPTURES THAT BELONG TO THE BRIDE. And
[48:43] therefore, the bride had to have her own
[48:45] Easter.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. IN ORDER TO BE IDENTIFIED
[48:49] WITH THE SCRIPTURE, THE BRIDE HAD TO
[48:52] have her own Easter.
[48:54] here in the message restoration of the
[48:56] bride tree. Uh this is actually the last
[48:59] paragraph uh of the sermon. Brother
[49:01] Brandham goes into a prayer line after
[49:03] this. But uh and it's closing prayer and
[49:05] a prayer line. But the last uh uh uh
[49:08] quote there, but the evening light shall
[49:10] rise in the west. It says what for? To
[49:14] to to shine upon the word. What? to
[49:17] ripen the fruit, bring forth the bride
[49:20] tree with the same signs, wonders, and
[49:23] fruits they had at the beginning. Now, I
[49:25] I I like that. I like that because the
[49:28] evening light comes and it shines. Amen.
[49:31] Uh um on us here in the west, just like
[49:34] it did at the those I mean those in on
[49:36] in the east. So, uh somebody made a a a
[49:40] a statement here recently and I thought
[49:41] it was really good. If you ever, you
[49:44] know, I'm I'm one that I like fruit.
[49:46] Amen. You know, some fruit. Not all, but
[49:49] I I do like I like I like a good mango.
[49:52] Uh praise the Lord. I don't mind oranges
[49:54] and, you know, uh things like that. And
[49:57] uh grapes, you know, fruit. I I I like a
[50:00] lot. But it's one thing about fruit.
[50:03] Amen. Um you can you can get a fruit
[50:07] that looks real. It looks like it's
[50:10] ripe. It look like it's ready
[50:13] &gt;&gt; and then you go to cut it and go to eat
[50:16] it and find out this thing ain't ready
[50:18] at all.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; And and and I'm going to tell you when
[50:22] you really got in your mouth uh that you
[50:24] already got the taste in your mouth, you
[50:26] ain't even tasted it yet. And you like,
[50:29] man, I can't wait to cut into this
[50:30] thing. And you know, I can't wait. I
[50:32] mean, cut this watermelon open and and
[50:34] and and you cut that thing open and look
[50:37] at it like, oh Lord. I mean either
[50:40] either it's not it's not ripe enough,
[50:42] it's bitter, IT SHOULD BE SWEET. IT'S
[50:44] SOMETHING ABOUT WHEN FRUIT has not
[50:46] reached the stage where it's ripe.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; AND SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN CHURCH in
[50:55] the church world is that the church has
[50:57] reached a stage where it WAS NOT
[50:59] [screaming] RIPE.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T FULLY RIPE. AMEN. BUT IT'S
[51:03] ONLY IN THIS HOUR THAT THE CHURCH COULD
[51:06] COME TO complete ripeness. AMEN. WHERE
[51:09] GOD CAN GET THE BEST OUT OF THE FRUIT.
[51:11] IT'S ONLY IN THIS HOUR THAT GOD CAN DO
[51:14] THAT.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE SAYS THIS, "BUT THE
[51:16] EVENING LIGHT SHALL RISE in the west.
[51:19] Wherefore to shine upon the word, what
[51:21] to ripen the fruit, bring forth THE
[51:23] BRINE tree with the same signs, wonders,
[51:26] and fruits that they had at the
[51:28] beginning. It shall be light in the
[51:29] evening time." Right. All right. Oh, the
[51:32] word will bring forth its fruit in its
[51:34] season. It shall not wither, but it'll
[51:37] bring forth its fruit, David said, in
[51:39] its season. Amen. SAME FRUIT IT HAD AT
[51:43] THE BEGINNING. NOW, I want to I want to
[51:45] just camp there just for a little bit.
[51:48] YOU KNOW, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT, AMEN.
[51:51] UM, the gifts, amen, have have left the
[51:55] church.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; I don't believe in that at all. I
[51:59] believe that the same gifts that we see
[52:01] in the book of Amen of Corinthians and
[52:04] also in you know and what happened on
[52:05] the on the day of Pentecost in THE BOOK
[52:07] OF ACTS THOSE THINGS ARE supposed to
[52:09] still be manifesting in the church
[52:12] today. The only thing is they just need
[52:14] to be in order.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; And and other thing is they need to be
[52:19] uh with a a WITH A LIFE BEHIND IT
[52:22] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE KNOW GIFTS AND CALLINGS ARE
[52:24] WITHOUT REPENTANCE,
[52:26] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF FOLK,
[52:27] EVEN BROTHER RANDOM START IN THIS DAY. I
[52:29] MEAN, HE RUN ACROSS THEM TWO MEN FROM A
[52:31] PENTECOSTAL CHURCH MANIFESTED IN GIFTS,
[52:34] BUT ONE WAS LIVING A DEMONIC LIFE.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT THAT TYPE OF GIFT ANYMORE.
[52:39] WE WANT IT to be the real thing.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND AND I JUST I HONESTLY
[52:44] FEEL I KNOW WE HAVE GIFTS ALREADY IN OUR
[52:47] CHURCH.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS ALREADY PROVEN THAT THROUGH THIS
[52:50] SEASON. AMEN. THAT THESE GIFTS ARE RIGHT
[52:52] HERE. BUT WHAT WE GOING THROUGH IS THAT
[52:54] THAT THE DEVIL HAS BEEN TRYING TO BLOCK.
[52:58] AMEN. AND BIND UP THOSE GIFTS.
[53:00] HALLELUJAH. [screaming] BUT I'M HERE TO
[53:03] TELL THE DEVIL THAT IF THERE'S A PROMISE
[53:05] THAT THESE THINGS WILL BE RELEASED, THEN
[53:08] WE GOING TO HAVE OUR OWN PLACE WHERE
[53:09] they can be released.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT,
[53:12] &gt;&gt; BROTHER. WE GOING TO STOP GOING THROUGH
[53:14] THE WILDERNESS AND GOING FROM AMEN. FROM
[53:16] CITY TO CITY. WE GOING TO GET OUR OWN
[53:18] PLACE and be established.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE THAT WHEN WHEN THAT
[53:23] HAPPENS, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THEM GIFTS
[53:24] JUST JUST GOING FORTH LIKE LIKE I DON'T
[53:26] KNOW WHAT.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And they're going to be done
[53:29] in decency and in order.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Cuz I don't believe it's supposed to be
[53:33] anything short of that.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[53:38] Glory to God. So, SO HERE HE SAYS THIS
[53:40] now what what uh with with this word in
[53:44] his predestined stage as he's got it
[53:46] now. And we see these words all being
[53:48] manifested. What is it? It's a perfect
[53:51] vindication that the coming of the Lord
[53:53] is at hand. And the time when he said,
[53:56] "I will restore, sayeth the Lord, all
[53:59] that them cankerorms, all the all that
[54:02] the Methodist left, all that the
[54:04] caterpillar has eaten, all that done
[54:06] after they stripped it down, but I'll
[54:08] restore in the evening time." He says,
[54:10] "Oh my." Woo. So, I believe that we are
[54:13] living in this time of restoration.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The prophet told us, amen,
[54:20] that uh the palm worm, the cankerworm,
[54:22] the locust uh and the caterpillar, they
[54:24] moved through the the stages of the or
[54:27] the church ages, I should say. They
[54:28] moved right through the church ages. The
[54:30] Catholic Church was the first church
[54:31] that organized. They persecuted those
[54:34] that would not agree with them. And uh
[54:36] it says four death messengers, which was
[54:38] the palmer, the cankorworm, the locust,
[54:40] and the caterpillar. Those four death
[54:42] messengers took life from the the tree.
[54:45] But the four life messengers brought the
[54:47] life back into the tree. And the fir the
[54:49] first life messenger was Luther. He
[54:52] began the process of restoration by
[54:53] preaching. Amen. The just shall live by
[54:56] faith. And then Wesley comes along and
[54:58] carried the baton to the next age with
[55:01] sanctification. And then the
[55:03] Pentecostals came along and brought the
[55:06] joy of the Lord through the
[55:07] manifestation of gifts. Hallelujah.
[55:09] Look, I believe that the just still live
[55:11] by faith. I mean, I believe I believe in
[55:14] justification. I believe in
[55:15] sanctification.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe in the restoration
[55:20] of the gifts.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just because we made it to
[55:24] the fourth stage don't mean that we lost
[55:26] all these other things. WE GOT THAT
[55:29] PLUS.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. So justification, sanctification,
[55:33] the manifestation of the gifts
[55:36] &gt;&gt; and we also have the fullness of the
[55:38] word.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[55:42] Hallelujah. Because that fourth stage or
[55:44] the fourth messenger of life was Malachi
[55:47] 4. He was to restore the truth and our
[55:49] hearts will be turned back to that
[55:51] truth. And I'd like to say this. Amen.
[55:54] Because he said that I will send you
[55:56] Elijah. Glory to God. You know what that
[55:58] does? That make you a part of the
[56:00] prophecy.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Amen. That make you a
[56:05] part of the predestinated word for this
[56:09] day.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; And and and I'm going tell you, when you
[56:12] can see yourself in the scripture, then
[56:14] you know where you stand.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; You know where you stand. I mean, Jesus
[56:20] could tell him, say, "Search the
[56:21] scriptures. Look at this. Look at that."
[56:23] And and we can say the same thing. Look
[56:25] at THE SCRIPTURE. IT SPEAKS OF ME BEING
[56:27] HERE. THAT'S RIGHT.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD SAID, "BEHOLD, I SEND YOU." HE
[56:32] WAS THINKING ABOUT ME.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE ALREADY KNEW THAT. HE AND
[56:36] HE DIDN'T HAVE TO PUT MY NAME THERE
[56:38] BECAUSE THERE WAS MANY OF US THAT WERE
[56:40] GOING TO BE YOU.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. AND WE'RE HERE TO MANIFEST
[56:45] THIS WORD FOR OUR DAY.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. There's been an Easter
[56:51] &gt;&gt; for the bride. All right. Let me go back
[56:54] to uh another little statement that we
[56:57] read in this journey this side of the
[56:59] sermon proving his word. Uh brother
[57:01] Brandham said notice it was by his
[57:04] believers that he proves his word. And
[57:08] and and this is this is the thing. It's
[57:10] it's the word can only be proven by
[57:13] believers.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Unbelievers will never prove it.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Uh make believers will never prove it.
[57:18] But believers will prove it.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. All God had to have is just one
[57:24] you.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; That's all God need is one you. That
[57:28] when he says, "Behold, I send you." He
[57:30] only need one. ONE PERSON THAT WILL
[57:33] RECEIVE IT,
[57:34] &gt;&gt; ONE PERSON THAT WILL ACCEPT IT, ONE
[57:36] PERSON THAT will believe it. And then
[57:38] God's word is made manifest through that
[57:40] one person.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[57:44] them.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, you know, as we
[57:48] journeyed for the last two years uh
[57:51] through this uh get back in step and our
[57:54] restore, sayith the Lord, that's been
[57:56] our uh journey. Uh it it is it is to me
[58:01] very obvious that God has manifested
[58:04] himself in our midst.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Very obvious to me that God has
[58:08] manifested himself in our midst. I was
[58:10] um telling uh brother Simba back there,
[58:13] I said, you know, I don't know how long
[58:16] it's been since I heard Sister Boyd
[58:20] sing.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; I don't know how long it's been, but I
[58:24] say to God be the glory.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; I I I say to God be the glory.
[58:29] [applause]
[58:33] Well, that I it it took me way back, you
[58:36] know, uh you know, year years where just
[58:38] coming up in church. She she was one of
[58:40] the ones that used to sing a specials in
[58:41] the church. And to see her get up here
[58:43] and sing that tonight, I'm like,
[58:44] "Praise, praise the Lord. Praise the
[58:47] Lord." God God is God is doing great
[58:49] things. When I see Sister Zion come up
[58:51] here and giving her testimony,
[58:53] &gt;&gt; oh my sir,
[58:55] &gt;&gt; I I I know what restoration look like.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Uh when I when I I I see sister Chenise,
[59:02] I know what restoration look like.
[59:05] When I see Nehemiah on the drums,
[59:08] &gt;&gt; I I know what restoration looked like.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Uh I I I it just all around us.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; When I when I can share with you a
[59:16] testimony that I I baptized my my
[59:19] son-in-law
[59:21] &gt;&gt; this year.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; I know what restoration look like.
[59:25] [laughter]
[59:26] &gt;&gt; God has manifested this in our midst,
[59:29] right? And and I I believe you know,
[59:31] brother brother Sim as he caps things
[59:32] off, he might remind us of some things
[59:34] that we might have forgot about. But uh
[59:36] but but God proves his word through his
[59:40] believers.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; And God's been proving it through his
[59:43] believers through this through this
[59:44] season. He says uh it was by his
[59:46] believers that he proves his word. He
[59:48] can only prove his word, not by
[59:50] unbelievers. It it's only by the
[59:52] believers that he can prove his word. No
[59:54] matter how much the rest of them claim
[59:56] to be, "Oh, I believe, brother. See, if
[59:58] you do, God will prove it so. Cuz we
[1:00:02] look and see the others. How can we say
[1:00:05] then? See, it's by true believers that
[1:00:07] he proves his word. Not by those who say
[1:00:09] they believe, but those who really
[1:00:11] believe. It's by his believing children
[1:00:14] that he proves his word. Now, no. Now,
[1:00:16] he had the believers, the old crop had
[1:00:19] died off. The unbeliever who said, "We
[1:00:21] couldn't take it." He let every one of
[1:00:24] them perish. Why? Every one of them. the
[1:00:27] believers who was left. Moses had been
[1:00:29] taken to uh uh taken to glory and the
[1:00:31] unbelievers had perished in the
[1:00:33] wilderness and this was their children.
[1:00:36] They were only uh they they were there
[1:00:38] they were only two that crossed over and
[1:00:41] that was the believers Joshua and Caleb.
[1:00:44] THEY WAS THE BELIEVERS. THEY WAS THE ONE
[1:00:46] WHO CROSSED OVER. IT'S THE ONLY WAY GOD
[1:00:49] CAN DO IT IS by his believing children.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; All right. His believers was the ones
[1:00:55] that done it. He used them to cross over
[1:00:58] with. See says now I want you to notice
[1:01:00] he does it that way in every age. He
[1:01:03] does it every time by the same method.
[1:01:06] He has to take believers. And then in
[1:01:09] order to have believers to meet that
[1:01:12] word, HE'S GOT TO PREDESTINATE IT TO
[1:01:16] THAT AGE. That mean God had to God God
[1:01:18] had to have God knew he would have
[1:01:20] believers in an age and he had had to
[1:01:22] predestinate those believers to come to
[1:01:24] this age. Yes, sir.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Man, THIS IS THE HARDEST AGE TO live in.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; This is the most difficult age to live
[1:01:30] in. BUT YOU KNOW, SOMEHOW SOMEWAY, WE
[1:01:33] STILL GOT VICTORY IN THIS AGE.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; BROTHER, NO MATTER WHAT'S GOING ON, WE
[1:01:39] STILL GOT VICTORY IN THIS AGE.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND LET ME TELL YOU
[1:01:43] SOMETHING. WE DON'T HAVE TO LOWER THE
[1:01:44] STANDARDS OF THE WORD
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO GET VICTORY.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE KEEP THE STANDARD LIFTED
[1:01:51] HIGH.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. AND AND AND I'M TELLING
[1:01:54] YOU, GOD GOT A HOLY GHOST THAT'S STRONG
[1:01:56] ENOUGH
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; TO GIVE YOU VICTORY.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. HE SAYS
[1:02:02] HE'S GOT TO PREDESTINATE IT TO THE AGE.
[1:02:04] YOU SEE, HE'S GOT TO PREDESTINATE THIS
[1:02:06] thing to be there to MEET THE CHALLENGE
[1:02:10] OF the age. Glory to God. There there's
[1:02:13] a there's a tremendous challenge of the
[1:02:15] age, you know, and and and and one of
[1:02:18] the one of the challenges is that you
[1:02:21] can't approach God just just with head
[1:02:23] knowledge.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Intellect.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Look look, you can't figure God out in
[1:02:28] intellect.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Ain't no way. I mean, his his ways are
[1:02:32] too so so much higher than our our ways.
[1:02:35] His thoughts are higher than our
[1:02:37] thoughts. His ways are beyond our
[1:02:39] comprehension. That's right.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; You got to take God by faith.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; THAT MEAN WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN
[1:02:45] IT,
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; you got to TAKE GOD AT FAITH. NOW, NOW,
[1:02:48] NOW, NOW, NOW I CAN EXPLAIN THAT I am
[1:02:52] predestinated TO THIS AGE BECAUSE I JUST
[1:02:54] READ YOU SCRIPTURES OF ME BEING
[1:02:56] IDENTIFIED THERE. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. He
[1:02:59] says, um, he's going to have A CHOSEN
[1:03:01] GENERATION. HE TALKING ABOUT ME.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN WHEN THAT THAT THAT SCRIPTURE
[1:03:05] WAS WRITTEN FOR ME, A A ROYAL
[1:03:08] PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, THAT WAS MY
[1:03:11] SCRIPTURE.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF
[1:03:14] IN THE BOOK.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But but here, you know, we
[1:03:19] we can we can we can we can we can see
[1:03:20] these things clearly, BUT THERE SOMETIME
[1:03:22] THERE'S THINGS THAT COME amen along the
[1:03:24] road that you might not have an
[1:03:26] explanation for.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; And that's okay. I got a God that can
[1:03:30] take care of that. AND AND HERE'S THE
[1:03:32] OTHER THING THAT I FOUND OUT ABOUT MY
[1:03:33] GOD. THINGS THAT I MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND
[1:03:35] right now, don't let that BE NOTHING TO
[1:03:37] SHAKE ME.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; There are things I might not clearly see
[1:03:44] right now and I don't I I don't have to
[1:03:46] be SHAKEN BY IT BECAUSE AMEN. THAT IF I
[1:03:50] JUST WALK BY FAITH AND NOT BY SIGHT,
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL EVENTUALLY REVEAL THAT THING TO
[1:03:55] ME.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'VE SEEN HIM DO IT. UH-HUH.
[1:04:00] AMEN.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHAT HE CAN DO. ALL YOU GOT TO DO
[1:04:03] IS JUST KEEP HOLDING ON TO WHAT WHAT YOU
[1:04:05] GOT. JUST A LITTLE BIT [screaming] YOU
[1:04:06] GOT IS ENOUGH TO CARRY YOU.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; God wants you to walk by faith and not
[1:04:12] by sight.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; That That's the way believers That's the
[1:04:15] way believers walk. They I mean they
[1:04:17] they live they live by faith.
[1:04:19] Hallelujah. But here he says this um uh
[1:04:24] he he he he's got to predestinate this
[1:04:26] thing to be there to meet the challenge
[1:04:28] of the age. Did did did he says did it
[1:04:30] get you? He's got to predestinate this
[1:04:32] thing to meet the challenge of the age.
[1:04:34] Did it get you? Did you feel it? Did you
[1:04:36] see it? He says, do you understand it?
[1:04:39] That's what's happening today. He
[1:04:40] predestinated it to this by his
[1:04:43] fornowledge. When he predestinated
[1:04:45] Malachi 4, it's got to happen.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Listen, he goes on. He says when he come
[1:04:51] over and predestinate anything to happen
[1:04:53] in his word, he had to prove his word to
[1:04:56] be so. when he predestined anything to
[1:04:59] happen and says it will happen. He knows
[1:05:01] that seed will be there just at that
[1:05:05] time.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Just guess what? You were the seed that
[1:05:10] was supposed to be there at that time.
[1:05:12] Yes sir.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; And a and God knew that's why you know
[1:05:16] this whole scripture say my my great
[1:05:18] army which I sent among you.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; The palmer worm the caterpillar locust
[1:05:23] you know this is a great army that God
[1:05:26] he sent it and God knew that these what
[1:05:29] these things would do to us along the
[1:05:31] journey. Hallelujah.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; But even in knowing what these ant what
[1:05:36] this insect was going to do along the
[1:05:38] journey he put a promise on the other
[1:05:40] side of it.
[1:05:42] Amen.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; After you've been struck down by a
[1:05:45] palmer worm,
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; after you've been uh taken to pieces by
[1:05:50] uh a a canker worm,
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; and and you know, and and it's like the
[1:05:55] devil the devil the devil ain't a ain't
[1:05:57] satisfied just sending a palmer and a
[1:05:59] cakeworm, man. He go in the locust
[1:06:01] stage,
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; I mean, the thing look useless already,
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; but he ain't done with it yet. THAT'S
[1:06:08] BECAUSE IT'S THE DEVIL'S JOB TO STEAL,
[1:06:10] KILL, and
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; destroy. SO AFTER THEY GET INTO I MEAN
[1:06:16] PALMER, canker worm, locust, he takes it
[1:06:19] to caterpillar phase. Man, he going to
[1:06:21] eat THE THE VERY LIFE OUT OF THIS THING.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; SOME OF US HAD THOSE TYPE OF
[1:06:26] EXPERIENCES.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; WE FELT LIKE WE were finished.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; That how we GOING TO MAKE IT OUT OF
[1:06:31] THIS?
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; BUT LOOK AT US NOW. UH-HUH.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; AND THE REASON THAT YOU ARE WHERE YOU
[1:06:37] ARE NOW IS BECAUSE THERE WAS A PROMISE
[1:06:40] ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FOUR DEATH
[1:06:43] MESSENGERS.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; THE PROMISE ON THE OTHER SIDE IS
[1:06:47] HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:48] It's that I [screaming] will restore
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; SAYITH THE LORD. NO MAN COULD BRING
[1:06:55] RESTORATION. HALLELUJAH. NO PREACHER
[1:06:58] COULD BRING RESTORATION. HALLELUJAH. NO
[1:07:01] POPE CAN BRING RESTORATION. ONLY GOD
[1:07:04] HIMSELF CAN BRING RESTORATION. ONLY GOD
[1:07:07] CAN REACH IN AND PULL US OUT OF SOME OF
[1:07:10] THE SITUATIONS WE WERE IN. [screaming]
[1:07:12] MAMA COULDN'T DO IT. DADDY COULDN'T DO
[1:07:14] IT. BUT GOD DID.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; WE ARE WE ARE WE ARE PRODUCTS
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; OF GOD'S PROMISE.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; OH, blessed be the name of the Lord. I
[1:07:27] know I am. I'm a product of his promise.
[1:07:30] That's the REASON I'M HERE TONIGHT.
[1:07:33] BECAUSE I'M A PRODUCT OF THIS.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; God predestinated me to be there TO MEET
[1:07:38] THE CHALLENGE
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; SIR
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS COMING in this age.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Let
[1:07:46] me move on here. I want to just um
[1:07:49] just drop this. Amen. You know, we we we
[1:07:54] as I said, we we we we've seen so much.
[1:07:57] Um God I believe God has proven u this
[1:08:00] inspiration for our church. It might not
[1:08:03] have been for anybody else, but God has
[1:08:04] proven there's so much that happened
[1:08:06] along the way.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; So much that happened. And um
[1:08:13] this this to me is is is nothing but an
[1:08:15] Easter that we've experienced. And you
[1:08:18] know and and there's a statement here
[1:08:19] that that brother Brandham made out of
[1:08:21] the restoration of the bride tree. He
[1:08:23] says um it started growing and what it
[1:08:26] do denominated. So God pruned them off,
[1:08:29] bound them up, laid them back, let them
[1:08:31] go ahead and organize. Then the next one
[1:08:34] come up and he's talking about each age,
[1:08:36] right? So Luther's time uh uh it was a
[1:08:39] reformation. It was the beginning of a
[1:08:41] restoration cycle, but it was a
[1:08:42] reformation. But they got organized,
[1:08:45] denominated, and God left it. Right? God
[1:08:48] left. God God leaves. Anything that's
[1:08:50] denominated, God leaves it. Because what
[1:08:53] happens that they start putting periods
[1:08:54] on the word of God, they believe this
[1:08:56] and no more. That's how we got so many
[1:08:58] different denominations. But we don't
[1:09:00] want to be denominated. And and I'll be
[1:09:02] the first one to admit to you that even
[1:09:03] in our message, we have to be so
[1:09:05] careful. Uh people have tried to
[1:09:07] denominate this message. That's why
[1:09:09] anytime you see anybody get a group
[1:09:11] started with some some catchy something,
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; it never lasts
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; and it never will last
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; because this cannot be denominated.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Bottom line, it will never be you that
[1:09:25] might it might take 20 years, 30 years,
[1:09:27] 40 years, but it will it will fall
[1:09:28] apart. And any group that I've seen rise
[1:09:31] up with any little special thing, I've
[1:09:33] just watched it. This group fell apart.
[1:09:35] that group felt especially after the
[1:09:37] lead of the group dies.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; It's done.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; If it's but if it's on the word
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; see that's that's the thing brother
[1:09:46] Brandham was on the word that's why you
[1:09:49] still see it's still moving forward.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If it was false it would
[1:09:54] have fell apart long time ago. Now now
[1:09:56] look you going to have false people that
[1:09:57] come and get a hold of it
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; and they going to produce some false
[1:10:00] stuff. But you got to and I I just thank
[1:10:02] God not that we had to because the
[1:10:05] scripture actually says that uh if it
[1:10:07] were possible it would deceive the very
[1:10:09] le but since it was not possible we
[1:10:11] might be in a situation for a number of
[1:10:15] years. Hallelujah. But because there's a
[1:10:18] predestinated seed there
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL ALLOW SOMETHING TO HAPPEN
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; TO PULL US OUT OF THAT TO PUT US WHERE
[1:10:24] WE NEED to be so we can experience the
[1:10:27] restoration.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh Lord, I thank you Jesus.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I belong to him. I ain't got
[1:10:35] nothing to worry about.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He I I am his responsibility.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Let me go on right here. He says this.
[1:10:44] He says, "Let them go ahead and
[1:10:45] organize." Then the next one come up. He
[1:10:46] bound them up, laid them off. Tree went
[1:10:48] on. Uh then he bound them up, laid them
[1:10:51] off. Now, one of these days they'll be
[1:10:53] burned. Says, "Bind them up. bind up
[1:10:57] their bind them up in their
[1:10:58] organization. But then what? Right in
[1:11:00] the top of the tree is where the fruit
[1:11:03] ripens first. That's right. Right in the
[1:11:05] top of the tree. So it's the top of the
[1:11:07] tree here that sees the evening light. I
[1:11:11] like that statement. It's the top of the
[1:11:13] tree that's going to see the evening
[1:11:14] light. my mama my mother when when we
[1:11:16] were coming up and had to go uh raid the
[1:11:18] mango trees.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Mama wasn't you know and and you you a
[1:11:24] mango tree not all the fruit come
[1:11:28] get ripe at the same time.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; The ones at the bottom are green. And
[1:11:35] when you see them green like that, you
[1:11:37] already know don't even try to get that
[1:11:39] off that tree and eat that. You know
[1:11:41] something something's that that thing
[1:11:42] ain't ripe at all. It ain't it ain't had
[1:11:44] time to sit in the presence of the sun,
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; But the one at the top and it's turning
[1:11:52] colors,
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; boy, that it got a little yellow in it,
[1:11:56] got a little red in IT FOR YOUR EYE, go
[1:12:00] right towards that. And you pick up a
[1:12:01] rock, a bottle, a stick, a anything. I'm
[1:12:05] going after that. And and and and mama
[1:12:07] was one that you know if if if if if
[1:12:11] she couldn't give it a rock, a bottle,
[1:12:13] amen, a stick, it was a little bit too
[1:12:16] high, she had some little fellas
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; and y'all have to climb that tree. And
[1:12:22] and mama be pointing it out from the
[1:12:24] ground.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Get that one. And I don't care how
[1:12:29] scared you are.
[1:12:32] you can get out there on that limb and
[1:12:33] get that one
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; and be waiting at the bottom for that
[1:12:36] thing just to fall. Because if it if
[1:12:38] it's right now, if it's right, all you
[1:12:40] got to do is just just touch it,
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; that thing going to come off that tree.
[1:12:44] Just just a little touch.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; And and and if you hit it with a rock or
[1:12:49] a bottle, you do you trying YOUR BEST
[1:12:51] NOT TO DAMAGE IT BEFORE IT ACTUALLY HIT
[1:12:54] THE GROUND. YOU TRYING TO CATCH IT
[1:12:55] BEFORE it hit the ground, right? Because
[1:12:57] one of the things that make you upset
[1:13:01] THAT THING HIT THE ground and leave it
[1:13:03] done busted
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; and and and hallelujah. If you if you
[1:13:07] the if you the one that got to go up
[1:13:09] there and look for another one, you
[1:13:11] don't you got this one but it fell and
[1:13:12] hit the ground and busted open. We can't
[1:13:14] use it. You got to go over here.
[1:13:19] [laughter]
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE ONES AT THE TOP OF THE TREE
[1:13:22] that that that that everybody be going
[1:13:24] after.
[1:13:25] THAT'S THAT'S THE ONE THAT THAT THAT
[1:13:27] RIGHT BECAUSE IT HAS A IT IT'S SET IN
[1:13:30] THE PRESENCE of the su n
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; AND IN THIS HOUR WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT
[1:13:36] HAVE SAT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE S NAL
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE WE'VE SAT IN THE PRESENCE OF
[1:13:42] THE S O N IT'S IT'S NOW TIME TO TO COME
[1:13:46] FORTH IN EVERYTHING THAT HE'S supposed
[1:13:47] to bring forth in us.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; I believe that. Amen.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; I believe that
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; it says the top of the tree where the
[1:13:57] fruit ripens first. That's right. Right
[1:13:59] in the top of the tree. So, it's the top
[1:14:01] of the tree here that sees the evening
[1:14:04] light.
[1:14:06] That's something that's a powerful
[1:14:07] statement. Only the top of the tree
[1:14:08] going to see the evening light. Now, and
[1:14:10] and I've also had some green mangoes
[1:14:14] that got right. They didn't they never
[1:14:17] got the color, but on the inside they
[1:14:19] maybe it's because of the process they
[1:14:21] went through. They they got right and
[1:14:22] the only way you can tell because the
[1:14:24] outside will fool you.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; But the only way you can tell is you got
[1:14:27] to squeeze it.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Now you don't want God have to squeeze
[1:14:34] you, do you?
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; You don't want God. You don't have to go
[1:14:40] through that spot process with God. The
[1:14:42] only way you know is when I squeeze it.
[1:14:44] Oh. And even sometime you can't even
[1:14:46] trust it
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; because this thing green
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; and that color green is telling me that
[1:14:50] this thing is not ripe
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; but it's soft. Something ain't right
[1:14:55] here.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; And you go to cutting that thing open
[1:14:57] and next thing you know part of it
[1:14:59] rotten
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; and part of it right because it never
[1:15:02] went through the full process.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Don't waste our time.
[1:15:07] God God wants something to go through
[1:15:09] the proper process and and it's only the
[1:15:11] fruit at the top of the tree
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; that's going to come to full maturity
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; the right way.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; He goes on to say this. Says, "Now Noah
[1:15:22] had three rooms in his ark. One room was
[1:15:25] for the creeping things. See, the second
[1:15:28] room was for the fowls, but the top room
[1:15:32] was where the light was."
[1:15:34] He says the light that shine first never
[1:15:37] come on the first floor or the second
[1:15:40] floor but on the top floor. See he says
[1:15:44] uh the tree he says he says uh the tree
[1:15:47] don't bear its fruit first at the bottom
[1:15:50] or the second like that. It was all
[1:15:52] pruned off in organization. But it's in
[1:15:54] the top part where I will restore saith
[1:15:57] the Lord. That's where the I will
[1:15:58] restore sayith the Lord is at the top
[1:16:00] part. It says, "I'll send forth the
[1:16:03] evening light. It'll bring back bring
[1:16:05] back the word, making it manifest. I'll
[1:16:08] restore all that I promised. All that I
[1:16:10] promised the same Holy Spirit will bring
[1:16:12] be and bear the same signs." This is why
[1:16:14] I say uh we're not losing what they got
[1:16:18] what Pentecost brought back. We This not
[1:16:20] a church that's that believe we should
[1:16:21] have lost that. No, that should be a
[1:16:23] part of our everyday experience.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; It just need to be done proper. That's
[1:16:28] all.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; That's all. He says this, "All that I
[1:16:32] promise, the same Holy Spirit will bring
[1:16:34] bear the same signs." And this is what
[1:16:36] this is where my thought comes from.
[1:16:37] I'll have an Easter, a resurrection for
[1:16:41] the bride.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; God said he going to have an Easter for
[1:16:45] his bride. I'm here to tell you tonight,
[1:16:48] you are a part of God's Easter
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; for his brides. You are experiencing a a
[1:16:54] resurrection even when you don't want a
[1:16:57] resurrection. Amen.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; God will still give you one because if
[1:17:02] you are predestinated part of that word,
[1:17:04] there's nothing that can stop you from
[1:17:06] seeing it.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; I'll have an Easter resurrection for the
[1:17:13] bride. The same as I had for the
[1:17:15] bridegroom. See, evening lights come out
[1:17:18] to shine. Same as the morning. The same
[1:17:20] signs, same things, the same light will
[1:17:22] produce the same truth that they had
[1:17:24] there. If if it's if it's shining on the
[1:17:27] same tree. Amen. proves his word is now
[1:17:30] fulfilled. I will restore saith the
[1:17:35] Lord. I say his word has certainly been
[1:17:38] fulfilled
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; in spirit of truth tabernacle.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; I will restore saith the Lord.
[1:17:46] [applause]
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; So I want to uh ask that our brother
[1:17:55] Simba would come. Amen. and he will
[1:17:58] recap, amen, this journey that we've had
[1:18:01] through restoration. Amen. Praise the
[1:18:04] Lord. Let's welcome Brother Simba. Amen.
[1:18:07] TONIGHT [applause]
[1:18:34] God bless you saints.
[1:18:38] [sighs]
[1:18:41] It has fallen my lot to speak tonight.
[1:18:45] Uh,
[1:18:48] and uh,
[1:18:50] if if it was up to me, I would prefer
[1:18:52] that, you know, the the other brothers
[1:18:54] speak. Uh, but um, brother brother Jack
[1:18:59] uh, approached me and um, asked me if I
[1:19:01] could um, recap the last two years. And
[1:19:05] when he told me, I said, "Okay, uh, all
[1:19:09] right. Um, I guess I guess we'll see."
[1:19:12] But deep down inside, I was going,
[1:19:15] Come on, man.
[1:19:17] This is why I didn't want to be a
[1:19:19] deacon.
[1:19:20] But but um I was thinking about it and a
[1:19:24] part of me was ready to uh just let him
[1:19:27] know that I I was going to pass on it.
[1:19:30] Um but I remembered
[1:19:33] um this time last year he had also asked
[1:19:35] me to to to maybe say something and um
[1:19:40] he well he didn't ask he he made a
[1:19:42] suggestion. So he he just said, "Oh, I
[1:19:44] was thinking." And I said, "Oh, is that
[1:19:46] right?" Okay. And then I just never got
[1:19:50] back to him. So I felt uh maybe it was
[1:19:53] it was it was uh okay for me to take
[1:19:56] this one. Um
[1:19:59] how many can say we've we've eaten in
[1:20:01] plenty over the last two years?
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's that's that's a
[1:20:07] reality for Spirit and Truth. We ate in
[1:20:09] plenty. Um, and not not only did we end
[1:20:12] eating plenty, but we were satisfied.
[1:20:13] Yes, sir.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. How can how many can say we were
[1:20:15] satisfied?
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. It reminds me of um
[1:20:20] Thanksgiving this this year. We were at
[1:20:22] um uh brother brother Jerry and uh
[1:20:24] sister Melissa's place and just as any
[1:20:27] Thanksgiving, there was a whole lot of
[1:20:28] food. Uh, and it was some good food and
[1:20:32] th those that would there would tell you
[1:20:34] we had we had uh some good food and so
[1:20:36] we had plenty to eat and it was it was
[1:20:39] one of the first times where I put food
[1:20:41] on my on my plate and you know sometimes
[1:20:43] you put you know a lot of food on your
[1:20:44] plate. You eat this and it's good. You
[1:20:46] eat that and it's good and you eat that
[1:20:48] and it's like h and you eat that it's
[1:20:49] like no I don't like that. And when you
[1:20:51] go to get you know second plate maybe
[1:20:52] you only get you know half the stuff
[1:20:54] that you got. But when when we were at
[1:20:56] their place, I I filled up my plate. I
[1:20:58] enjoyed every single thing that was on
[1:21:00] that plate. And I went back and got
[1:21:02] every single thing that I got the first
[1:21:04] time because it was good. And so I ate
[1:21:07] in plenty. And I was very satisfied. And
[1:21:11] when I got home, I kept telling my wife,
[1:21:12] I was saying, "Man, I I I really enjoyed
[1:21:15] that food." And that was because my
[1:21:16] belly was full,
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; because I ate in plenty. And I was very
[1:21:20] satisfied. It's one thing to eat in
[1:21:21] plenty, but it's another thing to eat in
[1:21:23] plenty. and
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; be satisfied.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, um to re So, my recap of
[1:21:31] course is of the inspiration over the
[1:21:34] last two years, and that's the I will
[1:21:36] restore inspiration.
[1:21:38] Um, brother Jack asked me to to do a
[1:21:40] recap and kind of uh give give like a
[1:21:43] summary of of the last two years. So,
[1:21:46] what I'm going to say today is is is
[1:21:49] nothing that you haven't already heard.
[1:21:51] uh hope you don't get tired of hearing
[1:21:53] that I will restore because it's it's
[1:21:54] it's a promise that we ought to hold on
[1:21:56] to in this day. And there was so much uh
[1:22:00] good eating uh in in this in this
[1:22:03] inspiration that just just one year
[1:22:06] wasn't enough to contain how much food
[1:22:09] we had.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we we we had the the
[1:22:12] inspiration uh spilling over from 2024
[1:22:16] into 2025, right? It was it was it was
[1:22:18] there was there was a a surplus, right?
[1:22:20] there was an an overlap an an overflow
[1:22:23] right and an overflow is when the excess
[1:22:26] or surplus uh is not able to be
[1:22:29] accommodated by an available space right
[1:22:32] so now we moved the I will restore into
[1:22:35] 2025 because 2024 wasn't enough to
[1:22:38] accommodate what what what the
[1:22:40] inspiration has so it fell into 2025 and
[1:22:43] we had an overflow of the inspiration so
[1:22:45] now I'm uh I'm going to give a a summary
[1:22:48] and and one thing I learned in in
[1:22:50] college with a summary is when someone
[1:22:54] goes up and does their presentation, at
[1:22:55] the end of their presentation, they give
[1:22:57] a summary, right? And they highlight the
[1:22:59] key points of what they said. And a
[1:23:01] summary allows uh those that were
[1:23:04] listening to make sure they understood
[1:23:07] what was being said.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; And not only that, I also realized
[1:23:12] because sometimes, you know, you you you
[1:23:14] you distracted when someone is
[1:23:15] presenting, right? Maybe I like in my
[1:23:17] case, I was trying to finish my own
[1:23:18] presentation when someone was
[1:23:20] presenting, right? So, I didn't catch
[1:23:22] every single thing, but when it came to
[1:23:23] the summary, it allowed me to be able to
[1:23:26] understand everything that the person
[1:23:27] has said in a in a quick recap. So, I'm
[1:23:31] I trust that tonight as I summarize,
[1:23:33] those that understood what was being
[1:23:35] said in the inspiration will make sure
[1:23:37] that they got the correct understanding
[1:23:39] of I will restore. and those that may
[1:23:41] have missed it for one one reason or the
[1:23:44] other will get to appreciate what God
[1:23:46] has done over the last two years.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then and and and before I get
[1:23:51] started, I do have a disclaimer. Uh this
[1:23:54] is my first time standing in front of
[1:23:56] you. Um I
[1:23:59] uh I'm new to this. I have a lot of
[1:24:01] notes. I tried to cut them down. I don't
[1:24:03] know if I cut enough or I cut more than
[1:24:05] I needed to. So, I don't know where
[1:24:07] we're going to land on time, but I I
[1:24:09] promise that I won't hold you hostage.
[1:24:11] Um, so we'll we'll we'll start by
[1:24:14] reading um a scripture that we've we've
[1:24:18] been reading throughout the the the two
[1:24:20] years. Brother Jack just just read it.
[1:24:22] You don't you don't have to stand up. It
[1:24:23] was already read. So, I I'll just read
[1:24:24] it real quick. And that's um Joel 2 uh
[1:24:28] starting at verse uh 23. and says,
[1:24:32] "Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and
[1:24:35] rejoice in the Lord your God, for he had
[1:24:37] given you the former rain moderately. He
[1:24:40] will cause to come down for you the
[1:24:43] rain, the former rain, the and the
[1:24:45] latter rain in the first month, and the
[1:24:48] floors shall be full of wheat, and the
[1:24:50] fats shall overflow with wine and oil.
[1:24:53] And I will restore to you the years that
[1:24:56] the locust had eaten, the cankerworm,
[1:24:58] and the caterpillar, the palmer, my
[1:25:00] great army, which I sent among you. And
[1:25:03] ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied.
[1:25:06] And praise the name of the Lord your God
[1:25:08] that had dealt wondrously with you, and
[1:25:11] my people shall never be ashamed. And he
[1:25:14] and ye shall know that I am in the midst
[1:25:16] of Israel, and that I am the Lord your
[1:25:18] God, and none else, and my people shall
[1:25:21] never be ashamed. The second time he
[1:25:22] says, "My people shall never be ashamed.
[1:25:25] And it shall come to pass afterward that
[1:25:27] I will pour out my spirit upon all
[1:25:29] flesh, and your sons and your daughters
[1:25:31] shall prophesy. Your old men shall dream
[1:25:34] dreams. Your young men shall see
[1:25:35] visions, and also upon the servants, and
[1:25:38] upon the hand handmaids. In those days,
[1:25:41] I will pour out my spirit." Right? So
[1:25:45] when we talk of um restoration, the
[1:25:48] definition um uh uh of of of
[1:25:51] restoration, right, is the action of
[1:25:52] returning something to a former owner uh
[1:25:56] place or condition, right? And
[1:25:59] restoration is an attribute of God. And
[1:26:02] we see it throughout the Bible, right?
[1:26:04] We know God has different, you know,
[1:26:05] attributes. He's he's an omnisient God,
[1:26:08] right? Which means he's all knowing.
[1:26:10] He's an an an omnip omnipotent God,
[1:26:13] meaning he's present everywhere, right?
[1:26:15] He could be uh hh uh with with you uh uh
[1:26:18] healing your body while with me saving
[1:26:20] me from an accident while with someone
[1:26:22] else comforting them from loss, right?
[1:26:23] God is an omnipotent God, meaning he's
[1:26:26] present every that's an attribute of
[1:26:27] God. He's also immutable, meaning he's
[1:26:29] unchanging. So what he was yesterday, he
[1:26:32] is today and he will be tomorrow and
[1:26:34] forever more. Amen. He's an immutable
[1:26:36] God, right? He's a faithful God. He's a
[1:26:39] father. He's a a healer, a provider,
[1:26:41] right? But we're focusing right now on
[1:26:43] the the attribute of restoration. And we
[1:26:45] see it throughout the Bible through I
[1:26:47] think the prime example is the story of
[1:26:49] of Job, right? We see where his life
[1:26:52] started, right? And then what happened
[1:26:54] uh in the middle, all right? It took a
[1:26:56] it took most most of the book of Job is
[1:26:58] just, you know, the negative stuff that
[1:27:00] took place and then in the end we see
[1:27:01] that restoration, right? So he started
[1:27:03] somewhere, something happened and then
[1:27:05] he was restored back to where he was,
[1:27:07] right? Joseph, the story of Joseph. Um,
[1:27:10] we we see we see restoration when he
[1:27:11] gets to uh to Egypt. He was in a
[1:27:13] position of authority in Piper's house,
[1:27:16] right? Something happened. He ended up
[1:27:18] in prison, but he was restored back to a
[1:27:20] place of authority in in in in Pharaoh's
[1:27:23] house, right? Even more authority than
[1:27:25] he had before, right? We see it in the
[1:27:27] prodical son. He was he was in his
[1:27:29] father's house. He decided to move out
[1:27:31] of his father's house. And we know what
[1:27:33] happened there, but he returned back to
[1:27:35] his father's house. That was
[1:27:36] restoration. Even the story of Lazarus,
[1:27:39] we see a restoration. There was life and
[1:27:41] then death came and Jesus came to bring
[1:27:44] back that life. That's restoration,
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; right? When we talk of so so so as human
[1:27:49] beings, right? There's two aspects of
[1:27:51] our lives, right? That that two aspects
[1:27:53] that our lives revolve around. That's
[1:27:55] the spiritual aspect, right? And the the
[1:27:57] the uh the natural uh aspect, right? And
[1:28:00] we have to attend to the needs of both,
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; right? We have to attend to the
[1:28:04] spiritual needs and also the natural
[1:28:06] needs. Right? The on the natural you you
[1:28:08] you you your body needs food, right? You
[1:28:11] cannot go without food. At some point,
[1:28:12] you're going to need to put food in your
[1:28:14] belly, right? Your body needs rest. You
[1:28:16] can't just stay up all all day. At some
[1:28:18] point, you're going to need to rest,
[1:28:20] right? You need shelter, right? That's
[1:28:22] why we go to work so that we can have
[1:28:24] money to pay a rent or mortgage so that
[1:28:26] we have shelter. We're we're attending
[1:28:28] to our natural needs. So, when we wake
[1:28:30] up in the morning, get dressed, and go
[1:28:31] to work, that's because we're attending
[1:28:33] to our natural needs, right? our
[1:28:36] spiritual uh uh is is the same as well.
[1:28:38] We read the Bible. That's because we
[1:28:40] want to attend to our spiritual needs,
[1:28:42] right? We go to church, we come to
[1:28:44] church, we we we pray, we listen to
[1:28:46] tapes, we we we fast, we fellowship with
[1:28:48] saints of like precious faith that's
[1:28:50] feeding the inner man, right? That's
[1:28:51] feeding the spirit. Amen. So now when it
[1:28:54] comes to restoration, we must understand
[1:28:56] that restoration applies to the
[1:28:59] spiritual and to the natural,
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; right? It's not it's not just on the
[1:29:03] spiritual nor is it just on the natural
[1:29:05] only. Right? So when we say amen, we
[1:29:07] must say amen to the spiritual and we
[1:29:08] must say amen to the natural. Right?
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So so when it comes to the
[1:29:13] spiritual aspect, we'll start with the
[1:29:14] spiritual aspect. Uh brother Brandham um
[1:29:18] mentioned to us as as brother Jack has
[1:29:20] already u spoken about at at Pentecost
[1:29:25] uh he brother Brandham says at Pentecost
[1:29:27] God planted a tree, right? And that tree
[1:29:30] was supposed to bring forth fruit. Amen.
[1:29:33] But we know that according to the word
[1:29:36] that tree got attacked by the palmer,
[1:29:38] right? The locust, the cankerworm, the
[1:29:40] caterpillar, right? The four death
[1:29:43] messengers, right? They attacked the
[1:29:44] tree,
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; right? That was planted by God at
[1:29:47] Pentecost, right? And the brother
[1:29:49] Brandham goes on to say there were four
[1:29:51] death messengers, all right, that that
[1:29:53] ate away at that tree. Now, when
[1:29:55] restoration comes, there's going to be
[1:29:56] four life messengers. Amen. And the and
[1:29:59] as brother Jack already explained,
[1:30:01] justification, right, through through
[1:30:02] through Wes through through Luther,
[1:30:04] sanctification through Wesley, uh
[1:30:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost, and the
[1:30:08] restoration of gifts through Pentecost,
[1:30:10] and then the the word through Malachi 4,
[1:30:12] right? Those were the four life
[1:30:13] messengers. Amen. And now, why is
[1:30:16] restoration important, right? The reason
[1:30:20] the reason why restoration is important
[1:30:22] is because Jesus can't come back until
[1:30:25] restoration takes place.
[1:30:28] Amen. We must understand that Jesus
[1:30:31] cannot come back until restoration takes
[1:30:34] place.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Now, why do I say that?
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Right? Why do we say Jesus cannot come
[1:30:39] back until the restoration takes place?
[1:30:42] Do you want to know why?
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Let me show you. Let's go to Acts 3.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Uh we're going to read Acts 3 uh
[1:30:49] starting at verse 19.
[1:30:51] It says, "Repent ye therefore and be
[1:30:55] converted that your sins may be blotted
[1:30:57] out when the times of refreshing shall
[1:31:00] come from the presence of the Lord. And
[1:31:02] he shall send Jesus Christ, which before
[1:31:05] was preached unto you, whom the heaven
[1:31:08] must receive until the times of
[1:31:11] restitution of all things,
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; which God has spoken by the mouth of all
[1:31:17] his holy prophets since the world began.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Now, this is this is Peter speaking,
[1:31:23] right? And he's he's explaining that u
[1:31:26] this Jesus uh uh heaven must receive
[1:31:29] him. is referring to what happened. So
[1:31:31] we know that when when when Christ died,
[1:31:33] he rose again, right? And when he rose
[1:31:35] again, he he um he he he showed himself
[1:31:38] to to some to to his disciples and a few
[1:31:40] others, right? And he was with them for
[1:31:41] a short period of time. And then in Acts
[1:31:44] one, we hear that um once he was done
[1:31:46] with his work here on earth, he ascended
[1:31:49] into heaven.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Right. So that ascension is what Peter
[1:31:52] is talking about when he says the
[1:31:54] heavens must receive him, right? Until
[1:31:57] when? the time of restitution of all
[1:32:00] things. So for him to come back down as
[1:32:02] we're expecting, we must look for a
[1:32:04] restitution of all things, right? Which
[1:32:07] God has spoken um by the mouth of all
[1:32:10] his prophets since the world began.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the the uh Jesus also
[1:32:15] spoke about this restitution or
[1:32:17] restoration of all things in Matthew 17
[1:32:21] uh starting at verse 11. He says, "And
[1:32:23] Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias
[1:32:26] truly shall first come and restore all
[1:32:30] things." Amen. And this happened um uh
[1:32:33] after the transfiguration, right? When
[1:32:35] Jesus went went up with um Peter, James,
[1:32:38] and John uh if if if I'm not mistaken.
[1:32:42] And the transfiguration happened and
[1:32:44] Peter, James, and John saw something
[1:32:46] that caused them to start to wonder.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; They said, "Wait, well, don't the
[1:32:51] script, the scribes say, uh, Elias must
[1:32:54] first come, right?" And then Jesus said,
[1:32:56] "Yes, truly I say unto you." Right?
[1:32:59] Jesus answered them said, "And Elias
[1:33:01] truly shall first come and restore all
[1:33:05] things." Right? Now, he's talking about
[1:33:07] that restitution of all things. Right?
[1:33:09] But he goes on to say, "But I say unto
[1:33:12] you that Elias is come already, and they
[1:33:14] knew him not, but have done unto him
[1:33:17] whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall
[1:33:19] also the Son of man suffer of them."
[1:33:21] Then the disciples understood that he
[1:33:23] spake unto them of John the Baptist.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Right? That's the part that may confuse
[1:33:29] a few people, right? And you can
[1:33:31] understand why. Because the Bible
[1:33:33] clearly says the disciples understood
[1:33:35] that he spake unto them of John the
[1:33:38] Baptist, right? But by revelation and
[1:33:41] through reading the word, we know he was
[1:33:43] talking about two different comingings
[1:33:45] of Elias, right? Two different
[1:33:47] comingings of Elijah
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; and and and the the the um the the the
[1:33:52] the the disciples understood that,
[1:33:54] right? And so because Jesus even even
[1:33:57] Jesus himself spoke about this
[1:33:59] restitution of all things and this
[1:34:01] restitution or restoration of all things
[1:34:03] must happen before Jesus comes back down
[1:34:05] for his second coming then that means if
[1:34:08] you are a a a a Bible reader right if
[1:34:11] you are a serious Christian right if you
[1:34:13] are if you are serious about the coming
[1:34:15] of the Lord you should be concerned
[1:34:17] about this restitution of all things
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; right if you are serious you should be
[1:34:22] concerned about this restitution of all
[1:34:24] Right? And you shouldn't be confused
[1:34:27] with whether it was John or whe if you
[1:34:29] are a Bible reader, you should be
[1:34:31] concerned about the restitution of all
[1:34:32] things. Right? And when you look when
[1:34:34] you look at the scripture, uh we we we
[1:34:37] uh uh I believe brother Jack uh told us
[1:34:39] when when when when you were pre he was
[1:34:41] preaching on this and he said, you know,
[1:34:42] sometimes people will say, oh, it was it
[1:34:44] was it was uh John the Baptist that res
[1:34:47] that Jesus was talking about restoring
[1:34:48] all things. And he said, we you can just
[1:34:50] ask one question. Do we remember what
[1:34:54] that question was?
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; What did he restore? What is it that
[1:34:58] John restored that you can listen to us
[1:35:00] so we understand that it really was John
[1:35:02] the Baptist?
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. What did he restore?
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Right? And and and and on top of that,
[1:35:08] uh one of the disciples that was there
[1:35:10] when Jesus answered this question was
[1:35:12] Peter,
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; right? Peter heard Jesus says saying,
[1:35:16] "Elias truly shall first come and
[1:35:18] restore all things."
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Peter was there.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Peter then in Acts uh uh uh uh uh three
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; when Jesus is already gone.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. When Jesus is already gone is
[1:35:32] talking about Jesus is coming back but
[1:35:34] not until the time of restitution of all
[1:35:37] things. If John fulfilled the
[1:35:39] restitution of all things, why good
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; why would Peter, who was there when
[1:35:44] Jesus answered the question, Amen, be
[1:35:46] talking about a restitution of all
[1:35:48] things as a future event if it already
[1:35:51] happened in Jesus' time?
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Peter was there and he understood that
[1:35:57] this restitution of all things is a
[1:35:59] future event and that is what will allow
[1:36:02] the Lord Jesus Christ to come back a
[1:36:04] second time.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; I mean according to the word.
[1:36:07] Amen. So if you are a Bible reader,
[1:36:09] serious Christians, serious about the
[1:36:11] coming of the Lord, Amen. you should be
[1:36:13] concerned about this restitution of all
[1:36:15] things. Amen. And you being in the
[1:36:17] message makes you a part of the
[1:36:20] restoration. Amen. You are a part of
[1:36:22] restoration because as we heard about
[1:36:23] the life messengers, the justification,
[1:36:25] someone is going to have to be
[1:36:26] justified. Sanctification, someone's
[1:36:29] going to have to be sanctified.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Uh baptism of the Holy Ghost and and and
[1:36:32] and and the gifts, someone is going to
[1:36:34] have to receive that Holy Ghost.
[1:36:36] Someone's going to have to express those
[1:36:38] gifts. Amen. And someone is going to
[1:36:40] have to receive the revealed word.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so like brother Jack said,
[1:36:44] there is no restoration without you.
[1:36:47] Amen. The restoration requires you.
[1:36:49] Amen. If justification comes,
[1:36:51] sanctification comes, baptism of the
[1:36:53] Holy Ghost and and the gifts and the
[1:36:55] word comes and there's no you, then
[1:36:56] there is no restoration.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So um that gives a restoration of
[1:37:04] the tree that was planted at Pentecost
[1:37:06] that justification, sanctification,
[1:37:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts
[1:37:11] and the uh the revealed word. Right? We
[1:37:14] are we are res we we are looking for the
[1:37:16] restoration of that tree that was
[1:37:18] planted at pentecost.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now
[1:37:23] we must understand what Pentecost had
[1:37:26] for us to um to see what we should have
[1:37:30] during uh this restoration right because
[1:37:32] restoration remember is returning
[1:37:34] something to its former condition. So we
[1:37:36] must understand what they had at
[1:37:38] Pentecost for us to understand what we
[1:37:40] need to look for or what we must have
[1:37:42] when that tree is restored.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because everything that Pentecost
[1:37:45] had belongs to us, right? Everything
[1:37:47] that Pentecost had belongs to this time
[1:37:50] of restoration of all things.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when we look at Pentecost, uh
[1:37:54] one of the main things that we realize
[1:37:56] is at Pentecost they were in one accord.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; At Pentecost they were in one accord.
[1:38:05] Right? One of the things that were they
[1:38:07] were in one accord about is prayer. And
[1:38:09] we see that in Acts uh chapter 1
[1:38:11] starting at verse 13. It says, "And then
[1:38:16] sorry, and when they were come in, they
[1:38:18] went up into an upper room where abode
[1:38:21] both Peter and James and John and
[1:38:24] Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, and
[1:38:27] Matthew, James, the son of uh Alfus, and
[1:38:30] Simon, Zelottes, and Judas, the brother
[1:38:33] of James. These all continued with one
[1:38:37] accord in prayer and supplication with
[1:38:40] the women and Mary the mother of Jesus
[1:38:43] and with his brethren. Right? So prayer
[1:38:46] being being uh in one accord in prayer
[1:38:49] is important, right? If we're looking to
[1:38:51] have the same results that they had at
[1:38:53] Pentecost, right? And brother Brandham
[1:38:55] says in um Jesus Christ the same
[1:38:57] yesterday, today, and forever. He says
[1:38:59] um then in every local church there's
[1:39:02] nine spiritual gifts right should be
[1:39:05] operating in that church if they're a
[1:39:08] good praying congregation.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. If they're a good praying
[1:39:14] congregation. Right? So we cannot look
[1:39:16] for those nine spiritual gift if we're
[1:39:18] not a good praying congregation.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Right now there's two facets or or two
[1:39:25] facets to prayer life. Right? And those
[1:39:27] two are uh your individual prayer,
[1:39:30] right? How you pray at home,
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; right? How you pray in different
[1:39:33] situation as an individual, right? What
[1:39:35] you pray for for your individual needs
[1:39:37] or your family, your children, uh
[1:39:39] whatever it might be, your prayer
[1:39:41] closet, you fasting, you being in prayer
[1:39:43] as an individual. That's one facet,
[1:39:46] right? And the other facet is us coming
[1:39:48] in prayer together as a church,
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; right? And just like with the spiritual
[1:39:53] natural, you cannot neglect one, right?
[1:39:56] You cannot focus on praying and say,
[1:39:58] "Oh, I I I I I I'm not attending the
[1:40:00] prayer meeting because I'm praying at
[1:40:01] home."
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; They didn't say that at Pentecost. Had
[1:40:04] they said that at Pentecost, they
[1:40:05] wouldn't have had the same results.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Right? So, when it comes to the your
[1:40:09] your your prayer life, right, there
[1:40:10] should be a balance between your
[1:40:12] individual prayer and you praying as a
[1:40:15] church.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. And and and we we we we
[1:40:18] ought to ask ourselves, right, as as
[1:40:21] spirit and truth, right? Are are we a
[1:40:23] good praying church?
[1:40:26] Right?
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Not not not only as an individual. Yes.
[1:40:29] Actually, as an individual, are you a
[1:40:31] good praying individual?
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; But on top of that, are you a good
[1:40:34] praying church?
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Right. We have we have um prayer
[1:40:39] meetings twice every month. That's only
[1:40:41] two times in 30 31 days,
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; right? It's I I don't believe it's too
[1:40:46] much to ask for if we want to see this
[1:40:49] level of power that they had at
[1:40:50] Pentecost. Two nights, right? two nights
[1:40:53] of prayer, right? We ought to give our
[1:40:56] best, right? We if if if only only only
[1:41:00] you know, you and God know how much
[1:41:02] effort you're putting into the prayer as
[1:41:05] a church,
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; right? On only you know, only you can
[1:41:08] answer the question. But my question to
[1:41:10] you is, if God were to ask you, are you
[1:41:12] giving your best
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; to praying as a church? What would your
[1:41:16] answer be?
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; What would our answer be? If if God
[1:41:21] asked us, are you why weren't you? How
[1:41:24] many times did you make it to pray in
[1:41:25] 2025?
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; What was your excuse right now for of
[1:41:29] course you know sometimes people work
[1:41:31] during that time but if you know you
[1:41:34] know yourself you know whether you could
[1:41:35] have made it or not you know whether you
[1:41:37] have a a legitimate reason why you're
[1:41:40] not making it to prayer. Amen. We cannot
[1:41:43] expect these things yet we are not being
[1:41:47] a a praying a praying congregation.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and and and I I I would
[1:41:52] hope that we we wouldn't be a church
[1:41:55] that because at the end of the day, the
[1:41:58] word of God is going to be to be
[1:41:59] fulfilled regardless, right? God is
[1:42:01] going to pour out his spirit on
[1:42:03] somebody,
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; right? Let us not be the church that God
[1:42:06] looks at and says, "Ah, they're not
[1:42:07] ready.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; They're not a good praying church."
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Right? And he goes to the next one,
[1:42:11] they're ready, and he pours out his
[1:42:13] spirit. They're ready. He pours out the
[1:42:15] spirit.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Right? So, we ought to take inventory
[1:42:18] and see are we are we really being a
[1:42:20] good uh uh praying congregation.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, if we move to Acts 2 um
[1:42:25] starting at verse one, it says, "And
[1:42:27] when the day of Pentecost was fully
[1:42:29] come, they were all with one accord in
[1:42:33] one place. And suddenly there came a
[1:42:36] sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
[1:42:39] wind and filled all the house where they
[1:42:42] were sitting." Right? Now this time it
[1:42:44] doesn't say in one accord in prayer. It
[1:42:46] just says one accord in one place.
[1:42:49] Right? And to me one accord means people
[1:42:52] being in complete agreement. Right?
[1:42:54] Being united right all right in thought
[1:42:57] in purpose or action. Right? Essentially
[1:43:00] being uh of the same mind, same spirit,
[1:43:03] right? And to meh that encompasses
[1:43:06] unity, right? Brotherly love,
[1:43:09] fellowship, peace, right? No conflict
[1:43:11] amongst brethren. I don't believe that
[1:43:13] they they they they they they were up
[1:43:15] there and one didn't want to sit next to
[1:43:17] the other or they couldn't one couldn't
[1:43:18] fellowship with this one or they was
[1:43:21] they were there without unit. I believe
[1:43:22] when it says they were in one accord,
[1:43:24] they were of the same mind, same spirit,
[1:43:27] complete agreement, united in purpose
[1:43:29] and in action.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Right? And brother Jack um made a
[1:43:33] comment and he said he said we we we we
[1:43:35] can't even start to talk about these
[1:43:37] spiritual gifts if we have no unity if
[1:43:40] we have no brotherly love if there's no
[1:43:42] fellowship amongst brothers and sisters.
[1:43:44] Right? And brother Quu made a statement.
[1:43:46] He said uh when there is division in the
[1:43:48] church there is no restoration.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; God is not going to restore where
[1:43:53] there's division here. This one doesn't
[1:43:55] hang out with that one. when this one uh
[1:43:58] uh uh is coming to to to to talk to the
[1:44:00] group, that one leaves. No, God is not
[1:44:02] going to to to to restore when there's
[1:44:05] division in the church. Amen. And and
[1:44:07] and I believe Brother Troy uh mentioned
[1:44:10] when he was preaching uh during this
[1:44:11] inspiration, he says, "When we have love
[1:44:14] for one another, it causes God to move."
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; If we want to see God move, we ought to
[1:44:19] have love for one another. If we want to
[1:44:22] see a restoration of these gifts, we
[1:44:24] ought to love one another.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; And then um
[1:44:31] we went through uh Pentecost, right? We
[1:44:34] we went through Pentecost as an
[1:44:36] experience experience, right? We we we
[1:44:38] we we know that Pentecost is not a
[1:44:40] denomination, but it's a truly an
[1:44:43] experience, right? We referred to
[1:44:44] Pentecost as being a denomination, but
[1:44:46] the true meaning of Pentecost is is is a
[1:44:47] Pentecostal experience, right? and and
[1:44:50] uh we went through the whole Pentecostal
[1:44:52] experience uh from the early 1900s, the
[1:44:55] Isuza Street revival, um William
[1:44:58] Seymour, you know, the the the moving of
[1:44:59] the spirit and what happened back then.
[1:45:01] Um how the spirit was moving uh um even
[1:45:05] how they were ridiculed. Um and then how
[1:45:08] they ended up denominating and in
[1:45:10] denominating they ended up
[1:45:11] misunderstanding the gifts and until
[1:45:14] those gifts have have been uh pretty
[1:45:16] much preached out of the church,
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; But when it comes to restoration,
[1:45:21] restoration involves bringing back those
[1:45:24] things back into the church.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; But they have to be handled correctly.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Right? They have to be handled
[1:45:30] correctly. That is why brother uh
[1:45:32] Quinton could come and then preach to us
[1:45:34] the power of responsibility, right?
[1:45:37] Because you have to be responsible.
[1:45:39] Amen. With the gifts that God has given
[1:45:41] us.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I um he I believe he said he
[1:45:45] got the inspiration from from sister
[1:45:47] Abby getting a car from from her father.
[1:45:49] And and he said for her to receive a car
[1:45:52] from her father, he must have seen
[1:45:54] something that made him feel that she
[1:45:56] was mature enough to have a car,
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; right? And we know that maturity comes
[1:46:01] with responsibility. The more you mature
[1:46:03] you mature, the more responsible you
[1:46:05] expected to be, right? I cannot expect
[1:46:08] uh um uh my little mason to have the
[1:46:11] same maturity and responsibility as uh
[1:46:13] say brother Josiah, right? There are
[1:46:15] different levels of maturity and because
[1:46:17] of that there are different levels of
[1:46:18] responsibility. Amen. Those two have a
[1:46:21] direct correlation, right? And so how we
[1:46:24] then handle those gifts will reflect our
[1:46:27] level of maturity.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then after that, brother
[1:46:31] Quinton again came and and and Quinton
[1:46:33] Jr. came and preached to us about the
[1:46:35] spiritual gifts of the church, right?
[1:46:37] And he laid a wonderful foundation on
[1:46:39] the spiritual gifts of the church and
[1:46:41] told us that those gifts are here to
[1:46:43] edify the church. Amen. They're not here
[1:46:46] uh for for for us to have an individual
[1:46:48] gain, right? I don't have wisdom so that
[1:46:51] I can prosper, right? uh you don't have
[1:46:53] faith so that you can get things that I
[1:46:54] can't get but it's here to edify us and
[1:46:56] he gave us a very wonderful example that
[1:46:58] I still remember um he said when it
[1:47:02] comes to these gifts that that that
[1:47:04] edify the body they're there for one
[1:47:07] another and he used the example of faith
[1:47:09] and he said there are certain things we
[1:47:11] have different levels of faith right and
[1:47:13] there's se certain things someone may
[1:47:15] have a gift of faith right and I may
[1:47:18] have something that I need that's within
[1:47:20] reach within my faith's reach and I can
[1:47:22] reach out and get it.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Right? There's certain things that maybe
[1:47:25] my I cannot reach the thing that I'm
[1:47:28] trying to get,
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; but there's a brother somewhere that has
[1:47:31] the the the the faith height to reach
[1:47:33] that thing. Right? Just like a physical
[1:47:35] height. If I'm if I'm not tall enough to
[1:47:36] reach something, I can maybe reach out
[1:47:38] to my brother Garen because he's so tall
[1:47:41] and so he can reach whatever it is that
[1:47:43] I'm trying to get, right? And that's how
[1:47:44] it works with faith that someone may
[1:47:46] have a level of faith that makes it easy
[1:47:48] for them to reach out and get something
[1:47:49] that you're in need of. Right? These
[1:47:51] gifts are there to edify the entire
[1:47:53] body, right? And then brother Jack came
[1:47:55] and and and and took each and every one
[1:47:57] of those um uh uh uh gifts and dove
[1:48:01] deeper into each one. you know what wis
[1:48:03] the gift of wisdom is the gift of
[1:48:04] knowledge, the gift of faith, the gift
[1:48:06] of healing, what the what what that is
[1:48:08] and and and the the gift of miracles,
[1:48:10] prophecy, uh discerning of gifts,
[1:48:12] tongues and interpretation of tongues
[1:48:14] and all that was preparing us for that
[1:48:17] suddenly that they had at Pentecost in
[1:48:19] Acts two where where it says and
[1:48:20] suddenly there was this there came a
[1:48:22] sound from heaven of a rushing mighty
[1:48:25] wind, right? and and and God uh by his
[1:48:28] sovereign grace gave us a suddenly,
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; right? One one one of the services uh we
[1:48:33] we we we we we experienced that
[1:48:36] suddenly, right? When when when it says
[1:48:38] suddenly, it's not it's not that you're
[1:48:39] not expecting it. You are expecting it,
[1:48:42] but it just comes upon you, right? And
[1:48:44] when it comes upon you, you must be
[1:48:46] prepared, right? And that is why we went
[1:48:48] through this whole journey of being
[1:48:49] taught how to handle th those gifts. And
[1:48:52] I believe that uh when when when when
[1:48:54] when when God gave us the suddenly uh
[1:48:56] and the spirit came down and and a
[1:48:58] sister spoke in tongues, right? One of
[1:49:00] the uh the nine spiritual gifts, right?
[1:49:02] I believe all of us as a congregation, a
[1:49:04] congregation, a well-taught congregation
[1:49:06] started praying for the interpretation
[1:49:07] of tongues because that's what we were
[1:49:09] taught to do,
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; right? And because everything happened
[1:49:11] in order, it allowed God to then uh give
[1:49:15] a vision to a brother, right? give a
[1:49:17] vision to a brother where he saw the the
[1:49:19] the the the entire interpretation of the
[1:49:21] tongues that were spoken and then he
[1:49:22] spoke out and gave that interpretation
[1:49:24] of tongues. Why? Because everything was
[1:49:27] done in order. Amen. And like brother
[1:49:29] Jack said, I believe there's more where
[1:49:30] that came from. I believe that we passed
[1:49:32] the test. Amen. I believe that God is
[1:49:35] going to give us more of that. And we've
[1:49:36] got we've got to expect more of that.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then brother brother Quu came
[1:49:41] and then preached to us about
[1:49:43] restoration in completeness.
[1:49:46] a very powerful service. Um he's talked
[1:49:48] about us being perfect beings with God,
[1:49:52] right? We we we came from God and we
[1:49:54] were perfect beings with with God. But
[1:49:56] then when we came on in into this world,
[1:49:58] because of the way we came into this
[1:50:00] world, we became imperfect beings,
[1:50:02] right? We enter into this world as
[1:50:04] sinners, right? And because we are now
[1:50:06] we move from being perfect beings to
[1:50:08] being imperfect beings, we have to have
[1:50:11] a restoration that takes us back to
[1:50:13] being perfect beings because we came
[1:50:15] from God and we're going back to God,
[1:50:17] right? We cannot go back to God as
[1:50:19] imperfect beings. Right? We have to have
[1:50:21] a restoration to take us back to being
[1:50:24] perfect beings. Right? And um
[1:50:28] you becoming a complete being completes
[1:50:31] the restoration, right? the
[1:50:33] justification, sanctification, baptism
[1:50:34] of the Holy Ghost and the gifts in the
[1:50:36] church and the word. All of that is
[1:50:38] coming in order to to in order to to to
[1:50:41] complete the restoration in you and make
[1:50:43] you a perfect being again. That's why
[1:50:44] the Bible says, "Be ye perfect." Right?
[1:50:47] There's nothing in us as human beings
[1:50:49] that can make us perfect. But it is
[1:50:51] Christ that makes us perfect. Right? And
[1:50:53] the restoration is what brings us to
[1:50:55] that point of perfection. So we can go
[1:50:57] back to where we came from. So we can go
[1:50:59] back to being perfect beings. Right? And
[1:51:02] then um um to even be in the
[1:51:05] conversation of being perfect again, we
[1:51:09] have to be redeemable,
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; right? And that's why brother Smiley
[1:51:12] came and preached to us understanding
[1:51:14] what it means to be redeemable, right?
[1:51:18] Because this this restoration is is not
[1:51:21] for everyone, right? Not everyone is
[1:51:22] going to be made perfect again,
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; right? Not everyone came from God and is
[1:51:26] going back to God.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. This restoration is for a special
[1:51:30] group of people, a predestinated people,
[1:51:32] a people that was for ordained before
[1:51:34] the foundation of the world. Amen. The
[1:51:36] the seed of God.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Because this this this we we're just
[1:51:40] passing through this world. This world
[1:51:42] is not our home. Amen. We're trying to
[1:51:44] make it back to our home,
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; right? And in order for us to make it
[1:51:49] back to our home, we've got to
[1:51:50] understand where we're at,
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; right? And if you don't know where you
[1:51:54] are, you are going to get lost in the
[1:51:56] more of life. And that's why brother
[1:51:58] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:51:59] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:51:59] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:51:59] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:51:59] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:51:59] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:51:59] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:51:59] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:51:59] brother Troy came and preached to us a
[1:52:00] very powerful service in my opinion
[1:52:03] about being lost in a mall right he came
[1:52:06] from home he had a reason to be at the
[1:52:08] mall he came from his home went to the
[1:52:11] mall got lost in the mall and that gave
[1:52:13] him an inspiration to preach lost in the
[1:52:15] mall because his goal was to get out of
[1:52:17] the mall make it back home
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; right and he typed that to our spiritual
[1:52:21] lives right we come from home we're in
[1:52:23] this this this this mall spiritually
[1:52:25] speaking we're in this mall but we have
[1:52:27] to find our way out so we can go back
[1:52:29] home. Amen. And one of the things that
[1:52:31] he said was that when he got lost, he
[1:52:34] started trying everything he could. He
[1:52:35] went here, he didn't find the exit. He
[1:52:37] went there, he didn't find where he was
[1:52:38] trying to go. And then he ended up
[1:52:40] calling his wife and say, you know, help
[1:52:41] me out, right? He was trying to find a
[1:52:43] way out, but he just couldn't find his
[1:52:45] way out to his car, right? And then one
[1:52:47] of the things that he mentioned is he
[1:52:49] went to those those maps that they have
[1:52:50] in the mall, right? That shows you a a
[1:52:53] blueprint of of the mall, right? And it
[1:52:55] can show you it it does show you the
[1:52:57] blueprint of the mall. But there's one
[1:52:59] important detail on that map that you
[1:53:02] need. You can see where the exit is, but
[1:53:05] you have to understand where you are.
[1:53:07] Right? Because if you don't understand
[1:53:08] where you are, you won't make it to your
[1:53:10] exit. Amen. So you have to understand
[1:53:13] where you are spiritually speaking.
[1:53:14] Where are we?
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Where are we in that restoration? Amen.
[1:53:18] Where is that restoration? I'm looking
[1:53:20] for that restoration. I'm looking for
[1:53:21] that Elias because Jesus will not come
[1:53:24] back before that restoration happened. I
[1:53:26] cannot make it back home
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; unless
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; I know where I'm at.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; I have to know where I'm at. And it says
[1:53:34] right there, you are here. Amen. And we
[1:53:38] have to understand that in terms of
[1:53:39] restoration, we are here. Amen. Because
[1:53:42] the goal is to get out of a mole.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that covers hopefully gives you
[1:53:48] an understanding of the spiritual um
[1:53:51] aspect of the restoration right and now
[1:53:53] with the with the with the natural u
[1:53:56] aspect of the restoration. We know that
[1:53:58] restoration covers a lot of things
[1:54:00] naturally, right? Restoration, right,
[1:54:02] like we said, is returning something to
[1:54:04] a former owner, place or condition,
[1:54:07] right? And restoration covers your
[1:54:09] family,
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; right? The enemy can come in and disrupt
[1:54:12] your marriage. Restoration will cover
[1:54:15] that marriage, right? Restoration will
[1:54:17] bring back your your your your wife.
[1:54:19] Restoration will bring back your spouse.
[1:54:21] Restoration will bring back wayward
[1:54:23] children that the enemy unrightfully and
[1:54:26] deceitfully stole from you. You are the
[1:54:28] rightful owner of that husband. You are
[1:54:30] the rightful owner of that wife. You are
[1:54:32] the rightful owner of that child. And
[1:54:34] the enemy has unrightfully deceitfully
[1:54:36] taken that from you. But restoration
[1:54:38] covers that.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Restoration covers your finances.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. You were here at one point. The
[1:54:44] end, the palmer, the locust, the
[1:54:46] cankerorm, the caterpillar have eaten
[1:54:48] away at your finances.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you're down here
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; struggling to make ends meet. I mean,
[1:54:53] paycheck to paycheck. You used to be
[1:54:55] comfortable.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Now you're not.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Right. Restoration brings back, Lord.
[1:55:00] Bring it back. Amen. Restoration brings
[1:55:03] it back. Heavenly.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Brings back your finances to where
[1:55:07] they're supposed to be. Amen. Your
[1:55:09] health, right? Your health. You used to
[1:55:11] be healthy.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Something happened and you're not
[1:55:14] where you used to be in your health.
[1:55:16] Restoration covers that. Your position
[1:55:18] at work, your positions. Maybe you you
[1:55:20] were a home owner. That was a title that
[1:55:22] you held and the enemy has taken that
[1:55:24] away. Restoration will give you back
[1:55:25] your home and more. Amen. Amen. And and
[1:55:28] and restoration covers peace, joy, and
[1:55:30] all these things. Right. Now, let's read
[1:55:33] um restoration of the bride. Um
[1:55:37] starting at uh paragraph 83 it says now
[1:55:42] that's what Webster says the word
[1:55:44] restore means to bring back to the
[1:55:46] former owner or to bring back to a
[1:55:49] former state of condition. And if a
[1:55:52] claim is made on something to make that
[1:55:55] restoration you can enforce it to make
[1:55:57] it come back to its right place. And may
[1:56:00] God bless the fe the feeble words. Now
[1:56:02] to restore means to bring back or to
[1:56:04] restore a claim can a claim can be
[1:56:06] enforced. Now to bring um to bring
[1:56:09] anything back to its rightful owner
[1:56:11] where it belongs. Therefore some way it
[1:56:14] went away from its rightful owner and
[1:56:16] can wander around anyway. But to restore
[1:56:19] is to bring it back to who really owns
[1:56:22] it or to bring it back to its natural
[1:56:25] estate where it was at the first time.
[1:56:28] bring it back into its natural
[1:56:31] condition. And in order to do this, we
[1:56:33] have a right to enforce, I like that
[1:56:36] word, to enforce. If there is a law, to
[1:56:40] enforce this rightful condition of
[1:56:42] restoration to restore. Then he goes on
[1:56:45] to say, like if somebody stole some
[1:56:47] property and they're holding that
[1:56:49] property captive, then you can take the
[1:56:52] law and go to this person and the law
[1:56:54] forces enforces this person to restore
[1:56:58] this property back to its natural owner
[1:57:00] into its liable first estate. Amen. I
[1:57:04] like the word enforce. And that word
[1:57:07] means to cause something to happen by
[1:57:10] necessity or by force. by necessity or
[1:57:15] by force,
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; right? By I I like that. By force
[1:57:18] because when it comes to by force, you
[1:57:20] don't have to be nice. You You ain't got
[1:57:21] to be nice about it.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. You a You don't have to be nice.
[1:57:25] He He The enemy was not nice when he
[1:57:27] destroyed your family. He wasn't being
[1:57:29] nice when he stole your money. He wasn't
[1:57:32] being nice. Amen. When he took you from
[1:57:35] here financially to there, he wasn't
[1:57:37] being nice. He didn't ask your
[1:57:39] permission to take your child. He wasn't
[1:57:40] being nice. So you don't have to be
[1:57:43] nice. Amen.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've suffered the violence of
[1:57:47] the enemy
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; because you've suffered the violence of
[1:57:50] the en enemy. You have to take it by
[1:57:52] force. Amen. Be violent as well and take
[1:57:54] it by force. Amen. Like Matthew 11:12
[1:57:57] says, the kingdom of God suffer. That's
[1:57:59] a biblical principle. The kingdom of God
[1:58:00] suffereth violence and the violent take
[1:58:03] it by force. Amen. You got to be
[1:58:05] forceful when it comes to restoration.
[1:58:07] Amen. You tell the devil, "Now is when I
[1:58:10] need my things back. And now and and
[1:58:12] brother Jack preached on now. Amen. Now
[1:58:14] I want my son back. Now I want my wife
[1:58:17] back. Now I want my husband back. Now I
[1:58:20] want my money back. I want my money and
[1:58:22] I want it now. Amen. J, you ever heard
[1:58:25] of JG Wentworth? You seen that JG
[1:58:28] Wentworth commercial? It's my money and
[1:58:30] I want it now. Amen. You don't have to
[1:58:33] be nice about that. Amen. And when
[1:58:34] someone says now, they mean business.
[1:58:37] Amen. Now means immediately. I want my
[1:58:41] son immediately. I want my finances
[1:58:43] immediately. I want my health right
[1:58:45] away. Amen. I want my health instantly.
[1:58:48] Amen. I want my family back ASAP. Amen.
[1:58:52] Without further delay, I want it now.
[1:58:55] Amen. You have to be forceful when it
[1:58:57] comes to the devil. Amen. To take back
[1:58:59] what he stole from you. Amen. Because he
[1:59:01] wasn't nice when he did it in the first
[1:59:02] place.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the the other thing I like
[1:59:05] about the word enforce is when you when
[1:59:07] you are enforcing, Amen. You are going
[1:59:09] on the offense.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We remember those sermons on going
[1:59:13] on the offense. Amen. We are in attack
[1:59:15] mode, heavenly. Amen. Amen. And when the
[1:59:18] palmer worm, the locust, kangle worm,
[1:59:19] the caterpillar, Amen. that enemy is
[1:59:21] attacking, he is on the offense, right?
[1:59:24] But when it comes to restoration, the
[1:59:25] ball has changed possession. Now we are
[1:59:27] on the offense, right? We are on the
[1:59:29] attack. Amen. Now we can say, "Give it
[1:59:31] back." Amen. And the Holy Ghost is there
[1:59:34] to back us up and enforce those claims.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost is the enforcer.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Then brother Jerry came and preached to
[1:59:43] us a a sermon called sealed in
[1:59:46] restoration.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Another powerful sermon. Amen. And one
[1:59:50] of the things he said was, "What unlocks
[1:59:52] the restoration that belongs to us is
[1:59:55] when we recognize our need for it."
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Unless you recognize there's need
[2:00:00] for restoration, there is no restoration
[2:00:03] for you.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's naturally and spiritually.
[2:00:07] Amen. Unless you come to a point
[2:00:08] naturally where you say, you know what,
[2:00:10] enough is enough. I need my joy back.
[2:00:13] I'm tired of depression. I'm tired of
[2:00:15] paying unnecessary medical bills. I'm
[2:00:17] tired of taking these pills. I'm tired
[2:00:19] of of of whatever it is that the enemy
[2:00:21] has as a whatever condition the enemy
[2:00:23] has put you in. Unless you come to that
[2:00:25] point,
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; amen, of realizing and recognizing that
[2:00:28] you need things to change, restoration
[2:00:30] is not unlocked.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Right. and and and and unlock it. Come
[2:00:33] unlocking it comes from recognizing your
[2:00:36] need for it. And even spiritually, Amen.
[2:00:38] Maybe you were up here spiritually
[2:00:39] before.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe you were up here spiritually
[2:00:43] before and something has happened
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; and you're not where you used to be.
[2:00:46] Maybe you're wandering around
[2:00:47] spiritually trying to find a place to
[2:00:49] rest and you know you were here before,
[2:00:52] right? You know you were here. You know
[2:00:53] you got out of step. Amen. And we the
[2:00:55] the the the the we had the whole series
[2:00:57] of uh getting back in step, right? You
[2:01:00] were here spiritually and something has
[2:01:02] happened. Now you're not where you used
[2:01:04] to be. You have to get back in step.
[2:01:06] Amen. You you you have to realize
[2:01:08] something must change.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; My inner man needs to be fed like it
[2:01:12] used to be fed.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; I need restoration. You have to rec
[2:01:16] recognize that you need that restoration
[2:01:18] to unlock that restoration. And it
[2:01:20] reminds me of um uh this this little
[2:01:24] video um that that I that I saw a couple
[2:01:27] of years ago.
[2:01:29] and it was a um a denomin Pentecostal
[2:01:33] preacher. And I I just as a disclaimer,
[2:01:35] I don't I don't go listening to
[2:01:37] denominational preachers. So before
[2:01:39] before you judge me, I I I wasn't
[2:01:41] looking for it. But you know on social
[2:01:43] media sometimes you just come across
[2:01:44] things, right? And um I was watching uh
[2:01:49] this little video. Um
[2:01:52] and this minister says
[2:01:56] he's talking about how the he was
[2:01:57] talking about how the enemy the enemy
[2:01:59] will come and steal stuff from you. And
[2:02:01] he said, "You mean to tell me you're
[2:02:03] just going to sit there and watch the
[2:02:05] devil take your stuff?"
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; No, you've got to fight. Amen. That's
[2:02:08] why brother brother Mark preached it's
[2:02:10] time to fight, right? That's why we know
[2:02:12] to go on the offense. That's why we know
[2:02:15] to be forceful because you cannot just
[2:02:16] sit there and watch the devil take your
[2:02:18] stuff,
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; right? You've got He's not going to hand
[2:02:20] it back.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not going to give you back
[2:02:23] what he stole from you. Amen. You've got
[2:02:25] to come to that recognization and say,
[2:02:26] "Hey, I need my stuff and I need it now.
[2:02:29] I need my money and I need it now. I
[2:02:31] need my health and I need it now." You
[2:02:33] cannot sit there and watch the devil
[2:02:35] take your stuff. You've got to stand up
[2:02:37] and fight because it's time to
[2:02:39] Restoration is a time to go on the
[2:02:41] offense. Restoration is a time to fight.
[2:02:43] Restoration is now time.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. When it's now time, you mean
[2:02:48] business. Amen. You mean business. All
[2:02:50] right. Um, and when it comes to
[2:02:54] fighting, we know that we use this to
[2:02:57] fight,
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; right? We use this. This is how we fight
[2:03:00] our battles because the claims that we
[2:03:02] can make are in the word of God. The
[2:03:05] promises we need are in the word of God.
[2:03:07] Right? This is how we fight our battle.
[2:03:09] And and brother Brandham says in uh
[2:03:11] Believest thou this he says you he says
[2:03:14] the word of God the written word of God
[2:03:16] will defeat Satan anywhere any place any
[2:03:21] time it's written.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say to you there it is. We
[2:03:26] need the word of God. Amen. All we need
[2:03:28] to do is recognize uh naturally speaking
[2:03:31] all we need is to recognize um our need
[2:03:35] for restoration because that unlocks
[2:03:36] that restoration. Once you recognize the
[2:03:39] need for it, find your promise in the
[2:03:41] word of God. Make your claim and then
[2:03:43] you leave it to the Holy Ghost, the
[2:03:45] enforcer, and say, "Lord, it's in your
[2:03:47] court." Amen. I've done my part. I've
[2:03:50] recognized my need for restoration.
[2:03:52] Amen. And I've found my promise. I've
[2:03:54] made my claim. Now the ball is in your
[2:03:56] court. You are the enforcer. You go and
[2:03:58] enforce the claim. You made the
[2:03:59] promises. Amen. And we're looking to you
[2:04:02] to to to do the restoration. Amen. And
[2:04:05] then and then to to to to in closing um
[2:04:09] I'll say this restoration is an
[2:04:11] attribute of God that we cannot exhaust.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. We cannot exhaust the restoration
[2:04:16] of God.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. The promises of God also do not
[2:04:19] have an expiry date. Amen. So when God
[2:04:22] says I will restore, right? And that was
[2:04:24] that was the inspiration for 2024 and
[2:04:27] 2025. That doesn't mean it stops and
[2:04:29] ends in 2024 and 2025. Amen. Even though
[2:04:32] we're entering into a new year with a
[2:04:34] new inspiration, we still take amen that
[2:04:37] I will restore with us. Because whatever
[2:04:38] situation we find ourselves in, we must
[2:04:40] know that God is a God of restoration.
[2:04:43] Amen. That that attribute can never be
[2:04:45] exhausted.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. God bless you, SAINTS.
[2:04:50] [applause]
