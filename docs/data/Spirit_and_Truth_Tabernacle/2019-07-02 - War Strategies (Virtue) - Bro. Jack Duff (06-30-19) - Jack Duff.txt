Truth mr. speech and everyone and in their respective places just I thank God for what he is doing and I met a man and heard the specials and thank God for that hurt my wife singing and I just had a question anybody get a recording brother Jeffrey okay you got it to make sure you send me the recording man you know that those it was a few and far between she got a beautiful voice a man and just you know I just I just appreciate when she uses it for the Lord like that just she took us back to old school and a man brought one out or whatever it takes and know that I wasn't it it was it okay cuz there was a part a part in that song y'all gonna be seated just for a second there was a part of that song that says something bow down no not not that something about being like Jesus to be more like you that's what I'm willing to do and yeah I was just kind of thinking on that because this is a really our the channel that we're in you know we started a journey and war strategies and man and and and our foundation and this dog is the statue of a perfect man which we see here to my right and you know in order our whole objective as Christians is to be like Christ a man it's not just to go to church that's great but the objective is to be like Jesus right and everything that we do were trying to be more and more like him so I was just very appreciative of that and a man and sister Tina took us old-school and a man I would certainly appreciate then can never never get enough of the blunt and you know I'm hearing that there are some churches say that we don't need the same songs like that anymore I can't agree with that we need more blood all right blood is blood is extremely important in it and if the blood it lost his power I wouldn't be where I am today [Music] and can wash you it can't claim she heard you a man and like brother branham said it's like dropping a man ink into the bleach once the ink actually hits the bleach you never find the ink again it disintegrates right and that's what happens when you're seeing is washed in the message of the hour [Music] no actually is when your saves watching the blood now you have to be careful because in the message the brother brother branham tells us that the majors talk about the the bride actually beating the blood right so you know there's some there's some things that we can talk about there but we just think up for them an umbrella solemnly thank you also for going back and I'm pulling out at that good one too and we just appreciate a man so much God is a good God a man a man I just love them I just needed to make you all aware so you brother Quentin's father will be we say laid to rest on next weekend there in Arlington Cemetery so this ass tonight you all just be in prayer for him I actually have to go up to perform the ceremony there at Arlington on next weekend so I'll be leaving out on Saturday morning and going up there and we'll be back just keep me in prayer just kind of a I knew that I had that coming I knew it was you know on my schedule and I needed to take care of it and and then you know this morning I got a telephone call brother what's going on me to pray about speaking at the meetings and opening the services so y'all pray for me like oh I didn't see that one coming that was on the radar and just pray that you know the Lord would just you know if it's the Lord's will give us inspiration for for that but a lot going on over the next month or so I think I'd also have to correct something I mentioned that we try to do questions and answers on the last Friday of the month I totally forgot that brother Caleb Duran was coming from Tucson Arizona to be with us that weekend he'll be here on that on that Friday night in that Sunday morning with us so what I'll probably end up doing is after we come through Hebrews chapter 11 there's a few more lessons on that and after we get through that I'm gonna inject on a couple of Wednesday nights the remaining portion of the questions and answers so I know that and I won't necessarily record that because we do our periscope live on Wednesday nights and I don't necessarily want that going out I'd like to keep that for our church amen the questions and answers is really for our church every Church is sovereign amen and we certainly honor how other people might feel about certain things but we're just doing the best we can the lead spirit and truth tabernacle so I won't put those things out on periscope or anything like that I don't even do video recordings of it I do mp3 recordings but it's something that if you were to request it my request to you would be keep it to yourself a man don't don't give that out to other churches where it might create a problem a man with so many other churches I've come to understand that we as ministers we don't see everything I tie a man quickly know what I'm saying but we don't see everything eye-to-eye we still love one of them a man and we pray for one another but we don't see everything at times and the Prophet said that the Prophet said that we probably wouldn't see things I'm even he said that if he had a board and he had a man on this board that wouldn't stand up and speak what he believed he kicked a man off the board so he didn't want people around him that were just saying yes yes yes that's right let's know so iron sharpens iron all right so sometimes you can see things from a different angle and not that you know I wouldn't dare say we've all the ones got it right I wouldn't say that we can we can learn from other people but you know we don't need to necessarily introduce some things you know to people just just let it be for our church and you know we'll just take it from there so keep those keep those things in mind and and I like I say I'll probably inject right after come out of Hebrews 11 before I go into Hebrews 12 I will bring some other questions and answers amen forward to try to get that and and it gives it again depends on how much we have there because if more questions start coming then I'll have to come up with another time to get that and I will commit to doing that I want to make sure that we we try to get you know the the heart set of people settle in just about every area amen how many love the Lord Jesus a man so praise the Lord a man I think that's all I need to know so I wanted to thank God again for mr. Tom a man not being being with this home today we came came here on on Tuesday night for our brothers prayer meeting and mr. Tom walked through the door and and I said how you doing I'm pastor Jack he's like Oh Jack Duff I said yes sir yes sir and and you know we got to talking a little bit and I said well how do you see it heard I was having prayer and I'm coming I said well how did you hear about prayer and I said I was watching online and and my prayers say didn't y'all have a combined service too so yeah that was on Sunday and say okay so he came to prayer and my you know just we appreciate you know him just coming and just entering in you know being with us for the first time then it came back on Wednesday night a man for Bible studying and I came back Friday night for questions and answers and I mean he's here this morning so it's so good to have me he's one of our neighbors who lives here in the neighborhood and I just so good to have him I there's many people that hear us online but never actually come into the church right so we're very very grateful that he's here with us segment on today and I'll just pray that the Lord bless them in a very special way amen all right so I think that's all that I need to know one other thing we are we're gonna try to do a back-to-school drive and access to Tina just to put on the on the board here some of the things that we need it then we're going to access just stay within the things that we needed we I think need about 32 backpacks and with those 32 we would have a total of a hundred backpacks that we'd be able to give to some of the kids in this area as they go back to school and I think that would be awesome you know if we're able to do that I don't think that we'll be going back to Okeechobee this year we'll try to do this local and you know I know there is a meeting with brother Simmons that's coming up and and I you just heard through the grapevine some of the Saints that's planning on going and that's that's perfectly fine if if you are going please just kind of let me know so I can just kind of you know we try to just be prepared for those things but I think we probably end up doing the back-to-school Drive that we can not to stop people from going to the meeting but there's a lot of other things on the schedule and I and that's that's the only time that I know that I'd be able to kind of commit to it so if you're going that's fine don't change your plans for any of that but but those that would still be here and want to be a part of that back-to-school drive it'll probably happen in that first weekend and August so just kind of keep that in mind keep that on your calendar and we're looking to do something here local we'll try to find a hundred kids that we can be a blessing to and also if you would just help us with that just get those last 32 backpacks and whatever other material that we need there if you would just help us with that weight greatly appreciate it and also don't forget brother westcoast birthday celebration is going to happen on Thursday Thursday and they're gonna do it at at the church at rapture and Faith Tabernacle and so if you were if you desire to go and be a part of that please again let me know cuz sister Wescoe wants me to give them a number account from our church as to who all will be there so if you're gonna be there please let me know and we will um we would get that into sister Wesco a man I think I think that's good Maurice God yeah when I get you know you I'm reaching something I'm hitting something this it's a new day for me a man and and sometime you know I've been having things in my head just saying let it be gone if I don't say it right then it's gone I gotta write it down or something I don't know what happened things change I can't wait to get my new body but but but I think I got everything that I needed to say this time around so god bless you let's stand to our feet let's read a couple scriptures here today a man and we'll go from 2nd Peter chapter 1 this is our basis as we are going through this journey of war strategies a man we talked on war strategies faith amen today we'll talk on war strategies virtue a man war strategies virtue here in 2nd Peter the one starting at verse three says according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue a man so he's called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you glory to God the man is an inside job for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins verse 10 says wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure but if you do these things ye shall never fall a man what a promise and let's just go back over here and we'll pick up a scripture in second chronicles a man chapter 14 second chronicles chapter 14 and I'll start reading at verse 9 a man 2nd chronicles chapter 14 and start reading here verse verse nine Amen praise the Lord says in there came out against them Zehra the Ethiopian with a host of a thousand thousand and three hundred chariots and came unto Malaysia now what that thousand thousand is that's 1 million alright so when we read that in Scripture thousand thousands talking is speaking of 1 million three hundred shares verse 10 says the NASA went out against him and they set the battle in a ray in the valley of zefa at Marea now aster knew that he was outnumbered but even though he was outnumbered he still went to battle praise the Lord Amen oftentimes when we feel like the thing is against us we don't show up hallelujah we run from the thing right but this man was outnumbered and still went to battle glory to God you got to know who's fighting for you a man in verse 11 says and asks a cried unto the Lord his God now notice he's in the battle crying hey man he's not at home crying he's there on the battle fronts hey man church Lori to God he'll always come through now a man and acid cried unto the Lord his God and said Lord it is nothing with V to help I see a man it is nothing with me to help whether with many or with them that have no power oh my god a man I need I need a lot of money gods and it's nothing for you to help cuz once you get involved in this thing things change Amen this the scale just just drops when God get involved right ain't no balance is no more a man this thing it's like a seesaw right you put you will try to get that thing balanced but man you get somebody look too heavy on the other side you can forget about it you're going straight up in the air right man when God is God is in this thing this minor problems like the I mean the problems Leafly God just got involved in this hallelujah glory to God it says it is nothing with Vita health whether it's meaning or with them that have no power help us somebody say that we rest on thee and in thy name we go against this multitude a man o Lord thou are our gods let not man prevail against V wait a minute after this is your battle right this is your battle it may you the one in the mrs. why are you praying let not man prevail against thee because Isis representing God hallelujah whatever situation you're in you're representing God listen first to us that so the Lord smoked the Ethiopians before acident means they didn't even fight he was just there the Lord smote the Ethiopians before asked him before Judah and the Ethiopians fled and asked and the people that were with him pursued them unto Guerard and the Ethiopians were overthrown that they could not recover themselves for they were destroyed before the Lord and before his hosts and they carried away very much spoil I like that and they smote all the cities around about Guerard but the fear of the Lord came upon them and they spoiled all the cities for there was exceeding my spoil in them they smote also the tents of cattle and carried away sheep and camels and abundance and returned to Jerusalem amen let's pray father we think you for the opportunity to read the word of the Lord today but God we know it takes the Holy Spirit to quicken the things that we have read and make it alive for us right now that we might be able to apply what we read father we just trust that you take control over this portion of the service as you have certainly been in control of everything else thank you for touching brother Solomon in his body driving that devil away hallelujah God we thank you for giving them victory thank you for him pressing his way into the house of the Lord to lead the saints in worship this morning and O God we just we just appreciate you being a right now gone a man and father that we can depend on you so whatever else that anybody else here may need today God may your meet us all at the point of our need we commit ourselves unto thee O God it's in Jesus name we pray amen and amen god bless you you can be seated praise the Lord Amen as we again just continue our thought here and war strategies dealing with the the topic of virtue a man these these things that are on the chart here which says faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godless brotherly kindness love that's identified as the seven virtues but we're looking at the the second layer their virtue today so just just bear with me as we just kind of comb through this just kind of set us up I want to start with a quote from the sermon what is the Holy Ghost amen the Prophet gives us a man some statements here and I want to just pick up there it says now we're at the end of this time says each man has looked at the end of his Junction for the coming of Christ but they had a lot to look forward to the returning of the Jews and flying saucers in the skies all the things that we see today but we're at the end it says where here now they know the church was to receive power that would work in the church the same works of Christ so they know to everybody know that the church was to receive power that would work in the church the same works of Christ because as a shadow becomes deeper and deeper and reflects more so as you take a shade farther away from the shade the least reflection you get of the sheen and after a while the gets closer closer to the tree and the shade and si the closer and closer to the tree and the shade is the same thing so as you bring it closer the tree and the shade becomes one hallelujah amen the further and further away you get then it's the tree is not casting any more shape so he says now the Spirit of God has worked on the justification under Luther sanctification under Wesley the baptism of the Holy Ghost under Pentecost and here it is in the last days performing and doing the very same thing that it did when it was in Christ now I was you know it was a quote in Sunday school in our lesson the problems talked about it was explaining the Philadelphian church age the Bible said that they had a little strength they had a lot of word but they did not have any dynamic power to go with that word and it says thank God you know even though there was in that kitchen said thank God because the power was starting to return to the church amen and what we saw in brother Brandon's ministry was not only just the word but we saw the power amen also coming back into the church and I believe even though the Prophet is already gone a man often seen that same power still here Amen Akeem manifesting through the church hallelujah so he goes only says this he says now the baptismal goes on the Pentecost and here it is in the last day performing and doing the very same things that it did when it was in Christ what is it the church in Christ has become one and as soon as they connect together that last link she'll go through the sky shout oh my I like that statement there a man she'll go through the sky shouting hey man you know now that that tells me that uh we not gone into heaven quietly Amen that tells me we're not leaving this earth that they meant but we're gonna go through the sky shouting Oh hallelujah hey man if you ain't if you ain't got a dance maybe we can give you some lessons or something but glory to God you better learn how to shout a little bit Amen even if you look me not not you know I let's be honest when folk dance in the world they look crazy hey man some of the stuff they do look absolutely crazy I mean if I'm gonna look crazy I'm gonna look crazy for God hey man while I let loose for God's hallelujah so much when we was out there in the world we didn't mind looking crazy for the devil but we come to church and we want to look yeah dignified right get rid of that why don't we enjoy Jesus enjoy this thing because when we leave here we meet him shouting oh hey man you might as well get I was watching a little video to this they put out on Instagram and in a brother brother brother brother was in the car with some of his brother Larry he in the car with with some of his uh his relatives and stop the car stop the car stop the car and got out of a car everybody jumped out of context and then god I say I remember doing that brother man me and my brother one time we stopped right there that 45th Street and all stretch stop the car I don't know what we was listening to but whatever it was it got it was an anointed we just got it and shot it then got back in those to me a precious memories huh a many things I mean I actually get more joy thinking about my shouting then thinking about when I was sad remember when God gave you the victory it made you know the shooting is a sign a victory shouting is a sign of victory now now I'm what I've also learned that I gotta wait to have the victory shout some time I'm prophesied in my that I'm going alright search glory to God we leave him here alright let's go let's go he said she'll go through the sky shouting says up will come Wesley Luther all the rest of them back in those days he that first would be last and he that's last will be first and they'll come the resurrection we're at the end time listen that's what the Holy Ghost does the Holy Ghost by justification see just a little shadow of it the Holy Ghost by sanctification a little deeper shadow of it the Holy Ghost by the baptism of it a deeper shadow now the Holy Ghost by the restoration of it's very person so when we're talking about these a man seven virtues this is the restoration of the very person of Christ living inside of you amen this is where we come to that every believer has to be manifesting amen the true life of Christ in every situation in every circumstance you got to manifest the life of Christ coming the church is not good enough amen he didn't die so he could come to church he did not send his spirit back so you could just come to church but he sent his spirit back so you might manifest his life because you can't do this with your nature amen you don't need a change of nature which is his nature that's why he said I'll give you a new heart I'll give you a new spirit and then I'll put my spirit in the midst of that that's what this thing is all about alright let's go on a little further say you said a restoration of this very person being in in here forming signs and wonders like you did at the beginning woo glory gonna call me a Holy Roller anyhow you might as well just get started now he was feeling that let's go on amen to this sermon a statue of a perfect man glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you know the Prophet just I'm going to paragraph 131 in there but you know as he was just sharing this it's tell us that faith was the foundation of this faith was the very foundation and and as we look at you know some of the things that he said about it been the foundation when you're building a many say just like if you're building a house you have to start with the foundation amen you just can't come out there with the roof right you got to start with the foundation and when you get the foundation then you got to put walls up and the walls have to tie to the foundation glory to God right and then once you got walls up and amen and the foundation you got walls up now you can put a roof on the top of this thing but there has to be has to be a foundation of faith is that foundation that God can build upon hallelujah all right let's go on he says this in the message stature of working man says first you must be born again amen that that's a new nature has taken over you this is what the Holy Ghost does it changes your nature and you are you and let me tell you something it's very easy to tell when a person's feeling the Holy Ghost and when one's not it's very easy to tell your nature changes the way you were born that lying sneaking conniving cheat deceptive nature you had hallelujah Amen that that leaves now you loving you come you sweet humble huh glory to God all these thing I'm in your whole your whole characteristics begin to change when you used to on the fuss with everybody huh Amen you had then you had the sass with everybody now you can love everybody come on somebody we took my to nature hallelujah amen see and this is when we look at Christ he wasn't doing a lot of stuff that we do come on somebody Amen Christ in Christ in handle situations like that Christ in handle circumstances like that it shouldn't just be a band that we put on our hand WWJD it should be a lifestyle that we live really with Jesus do and we should follow the scriptural patterns as to what he's already done you ain't got no wonder what he would do it's right in the Bible and we gotta follow his patterns oh come on somebody Amen Jesus Jesus was faithful in church you know the bottom say it was his custom to go to church it was Jesus custom so that ought to be your custom a man church see it's so many things it's right there in the scripture we can follow the pattern he already laid it out when we when we read about its life we know what we supposed to be doing all right come on let me go on first you must be born again and then when you're born again you have faith now when you're born again you have faith let's get that when you're born again you know at faith you have things so so did this really if something has to happen on inside we were talking about that this morning you know Judas had that this justice ministry that Jesus gave him the cast out the sick right and I mean I mean I cast out Devils in heal the sick you know I mean Judas did all these great things but brother branham say he stopped short of going to Pentecost now wait a minute with all these miracles being formed amen performed by Judas why we need to go to hemming house hallelujah the purpose of going to Pentecost is so that your nature can change still had a problem with money come on somebody amen even though many people have manifestations in their life they still have other problems on the inside that gotting dealt with you and only Pentecostal experience will take those things out of you but life has a way of Cole's and us to kind of get disconnected from the water source disconnected from this water source begins to crumble [Music] you got to change some things then I tell you the truth I come from a day when folk men the Holy Ghost we hit the church and if there was any little thing going on a man the Holy Ghost were half people go hug one another anybody remember them days and I mean they really meant it they was apologized and I'm sorry my brother I'm sorry the Holy Ghost was forced him to go do dance they would leave church without making things right but now we sweep it all under the carpet I know I did you wrong oh well what kind of spirit that ain't the Holy Spirit how do you touch we talk about the character of Christ being manifested in his people all right I'm going on glory to God glory to God he says this said you must be born again and then when you're born again you you you have faith you believe the word until you're born again you're arguing amen if you're just religiously inclined you got a little human knowledge that you should do right you'll never be able to agree upon the Word of God you'll never do it you've got to be born again and born again it produces faith oh this is powerful me born again when you're truly born again it automatically produces faith all right then after you get faith this right here he says fa fa I th was looking at that foundation FB i th faith then you're just in position of growing then you're just in position of growing now the Prophet also goes on to make a statement here and I'm gonna bring this in if we can that's the same power that was in Jesus it's supposed to be in his church and he also said the Christ is a truth try Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts now let's read that out of church age book made man and and we will just bring this amen a little a little further for you glory glory glory says let me show you another reason why Satan hates this book of the revelation of Jesus Christ a man in the end the church and I'm reading from the revelation of Jesus Christ it says hates this book of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus is the same yesterday and today and forever and he changes not he knows that a whole lot more than do 90% of the theologians he knows that since God is immutable in in his nature God God can't change his nature says then he then he's just as immutable in his ways that Satan knows are surely that the original church at Pentecost with the power of God it says mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else is false it has to be so this is our standard this is what we're aiming for we want to be like that original church at Pentecost March 16 in action that's the true church that Jesus will claim as his own he goes on now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shows that how that how the Antichrist spirit we're coming to the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless now you know you all need to just kind of meditate on that statement how has the Antichrist spirit coming to your own personal life to make you lukewarm former and powerless amen if you know how he got in you know how to get him out hallelujah somebody right he said he says it exposes Satan revealing his word a tempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's Word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot spend it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater works hallelujah I love this statement she will be an invincible army that mean you can't be defeated no matter what the devil brings your direction you you cannot be defeated she will be an invisible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit design and withstand the Antichrist fear Satan will be powerless before her he will be D will be us definitely thought of today as when Christ was stood as every effort the gain power over him in a desert yesterday Satan hates revelation but we love it a man with true revelations in our lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them some of us may feel like we stand at the gates of hell this morning you got a promise surrounding you that you will prevail over the of hail hallelujah amen all right thank you Jesus a couple more the coach that I want to just kind of give here and amen as we talk about this war strategist virtue a man thank you Jesus this is also coming out of statue of a perfect man I'm at paragraph 141 thank you Jesus mentioned to you to be good for you to go back and just listen to this sermon and you're your own quiet time they men just hear how to profit late these things out but this is the objective is not just a chart a man it's an objective and we all ought to be striving for this daily constantly striving always doing an inventory taking inventory like lord I missed it there Lord I fell right there god I need I need I need your help in this area and like we said earlier help us right Lord help me right here in this area I needed God I like my temple my temple mine I mean I missed it there maybe some of y'all need some need to need to get the study in the Word of God so much we can get some knowledge hey man you got into a conversation with somebody and they had you all tied up you need some more knowledge god I missed it I noticed messages rights I needed some more knowledge I need to spend some more time with you God ain't man some patience huh glory to God I mean so you know you know maybe we run out of patience and we ain't got patience for nothing hey man soon as somebody didn't do any little thing oh you just oh you all over them amen need a little bit more patience kind of wait oh my sumit some of us if we travel overseas we'd really be in trouble hey man I'm just being honest you travel overseas you really be in trouble there's some countries they don't move the way we move they don't do things the way we do things I remember my first time going to Zimbabwe I thought I went back to the place that I had come from that's what I thought said this is where we came from and then I made that comment and the brother said now you know there was never any slavery here in Zimbabwe yet say oh okay I guess they say where we come from you know and and and I said that you know but the reason I said it because I they told me to be ready a particular time and I think they might have said be ready by by 11 o'clock would be there it must have been four o'clock but folks somebody showed up to come pick me up and now I'm pacing going back and forth like what I ain't got no felt telephone in the car my body and my patience is really being trying hallelujah oh my glory to God in the first time I went to Beck way and I got thing I'm trying to catch the flight and I had an arrangement thing and I know I should have called that flight and these people are done kind of pulled one over on me real fast and I had to let him know a few things and then I come to find out you know they I think the name of the airline was Lian Li eighty Li OTT and then I was talking with somebody and they say yeah you know Ali I stands for writers say what leave Island at any time and I say Oh Lord my patience is being tried hallelujah you know you go through little things here and there and we gotta learn how to just let God be God sometimes God might be willing to set you up with a free ticket but your patience your patience you just lost the ticket with your patience my god already saw another meeting coming he was gonna give you a free ticket to the meeting with your trial but you understand you got to go through a trial to get something oh my god but we don't even want to trial all right y'all stay with me here glory to God and even you're gonna go through trials to get these things birth in you hallelujah so get ready for the trial God is just pulling this out of you Amen this is what he wants to see his reflection in you amen all right let's get let's keep going it says now here's what we do what's the first thing have faith be born again that's laying the foundation then after we lay the foundation foundation secondly you add to your foundation I like this you know this secondly you add to your foundation add to your faith Peter said here add to your first you have faith then you add virtue to your faith this is the next column first pour your foundation faith then to your faith at virtue now right there knocks a lot of us down yes sir virtue to your faith that doesn't just mean living a virgin life you know like the woman our man and so forth that doesn't have nothing to do with that the Bible said we read over here in the Book of Luke we're saying virtue went out of him a man now just pull it down there i want to i want to just inject there he's referring to the story there and Luke chapter 8 a man you'll find it in verse 43 through fifth that we won't read it amen but I'll just tell it but gyruss had come to the Lord Jesus and his daughter was dying and and and his wife him and his wife had a conversation like you know look the church that we go to they not able to handle the situation that we in and I know that if we were to go associate ourselves with Jesus we might get excommunicated from the church but see it's not their child dying it's our child dying so so we're gonna have to counter break protocol and we're gonna have to go I am take whatever chance that we got to take because this is our one and only daughter go get Jesus amen here the wife just just just kind of put it on jobs go find Jesus and bring Jesus back to this house hallelujah he might not be welcome in our church but Jesus is certainly welcome in this house the reason he's welcome because only Jesus can change the situation that we're going through how do you somebody we need to make changes more welcome in our houses but Majoris goals and amen is going to get Jesus and and he finally gets torment it tells him you know what his issue is and Jesus jumps up self-care I'd go home with you oh my god and as he's Amen on the way to this man's house a big crowd begins to kind of crowd around the Lord Jesus in and they're headed down to Charles Houston and there was a woman that was a men sitting in her house and she recognized it when there's a big cry like this somebody important must be around hallelujah maybe she began acts who is this man that that's around why are they crowded up like this and and what's going on they say Jesus is in town she said Jesus the condition that I have I've had it for 12 years and the Bible says she went from Doctor to doctor she went from a man from one position to the next position and the Bible said not one person was able to help her so she said within herself now I know he didn't come to the city for me Amen I didn't give him a personal invitation John's the one has his attention now but if I could just touch the hem of His garment then I know my condition will be solved I ain't trying to touch Peter I ain't trying to touch char I need to touch Jesus and she begin to press to the crop and she come up the Bible says she come up from behind them and I don't know what she had to do but she reached him she got ahold of Jesus garment and just pulled on it and walked away now when this happened Jesus say who touched me Peter begin to rebuke the Lord Jesus how you not say who touch you in when the cross I've thrown to you everybody touch you how loose a say Peter because virtue strength just left my body and I know somebody just touched me a man I want to show you something here he's a she say who touch me say he'd say he'd say how could you say to all these people touching you he said no no somebody just touched me a different way cuz weren't you just left and he stopped and he started looking around the crowd and he finally make contact with this woman say a woman well you know what is it she say she come and confess tonight I'm with the doctor after doctor after doctor and you know I wasn't able to get anything from the doctors but I said within myself if I could just touch the hem of your garment now you gotta understand Jesus couldn't touch help with the condition that she had the Bible amen the law would not allow him to go to her with this issue of blood couldn't even touch anything in her house my god what the law did not say that she couldn't touch him oh praise God so see women she went she went around the law and she touched him and she was made whole right then we ought to come the church look into touch Jesus he say say woman don't you worry about everything good now your faith has saved you and while he's sitting there having this conversation with the woman Amen with the issue blood and I love them with the way but the way the Bible describes it don't even give him give us a name just a woman with the issue of blood now can't you imagine yourself getting to heaven and the sister come up and say god bless you and y'all begin to have a little conversation yeah and as you know what age did what time did you live you know what yeah I'm I was actually I was a Jew and you know I was I was chillin over the Israel I'm from here and I'm from there you know I lived Aliyah to seal say well you know my name is so-and-so Russian my name is Jack I'm I'm the woman with the issue of blood oh you don't want me hallelujah I see them a completely whole Amen and I just sit down listen to testimony tell it took me all over again I don't think they recorded it Amen exactly the way it was maybe somebody else testimony I want to hear your testimony come on somebody near heaven gonna be wonderful knocking I can just I can just I can just see you know you know after after Jesus say get your faith to save you you may hold why he was telling her this somebody from gyruss house walked up to the Lord Jesus say don't trouble to master your daughter's already damn jesus said now if you would have faith I already told you if you have faith not even in that one story there was two different types of faith one was if I could touch the hem of your garment I'll be made whole he responded to that and the others come home with me he responded to both of them both of them but I want you understand now he just said he said saying I told you if you have faith you'll see the glory of God in your daughter's life now here's what I like about this [Music] situation daughter from the team he's expecting us as believers to have the same type of virtue let me just keep on reading in this quote glory to God glory to God since the Bible said we read over here in the Book of Luke where it say it virtue went out of him that's right if we're gonna be like him we must have virtue since we must have it to be like him it's the first song that I ever loved in the hymns one of the greatest was to be like Jesus well if I'm gonna be like Jesus I got to have virtue and a past that it can pass for from me to the people because virtue went out of him to the people glory to God virtue and before you can let it out you got to at first you haven't got it it won't come out if you haven't got it it won't come out there's nothing for it to come out of what if someone tried to drop virtue out of us and the check will return insufficient funds see no non dare to draw from check bounced that's your spiritual check you don't want any of y'all ever had a check bounced it's not a good feeling hey man you have to do a lot of explaining talk to me somebody when when your check bounces yeah it should've been there I know it should have been there buddy and one now now not only not only not only do you have to pay them what you were paying them there's also some fees associated praise the Lord you pay a little more when the check bounces hey man hey man do you want to make sure you got something in your spiritual account you don't want that the check you don't want people come to you and they've drawn insufficient funds from you big face of situation you get nothing insufficient funds here and God brought them to you for a reason because he knew you could do something about it but insufficient funds see you see you know that I'm getting into this let me finish this quote it says the check will return insufficient funds see no none there to draw from check bounced somebody looking at you as a Christian and tomorrow see you out here carrying on like a sinner not much virtue can be drawn from that that's why foot connects you to pray because they see different lifestyle come on somebody one day you won't fire are you sitting quotes and everything hello somebody then all of a sudden we can get no quotes hey man right people can see right through that type of stuff we talked about godly virtue being inside of you amen you know talk about insufficient funds you know the disciples went through a time where they also have some insufficient funds here the the they had a situation that support was a epileptic I believe him and they brought him to the disciples and many just could not get the devil out of this boy so you know and here they've been given power they've been given you know authority to cast out Devils but they can't get the devil out of this boy and finally that the man say he needs to say you know what I'm kind of I'm kind of tired of you know of y'all where is Jesus where's Jesus I need Jesus right say I appreciate your efforts but I need Jesus and say well here here's Jesus a and he saying Jesus you know I got this situation and now I want to tell you now I did not bypass these disciples I brought them to your disciples but not one of them could do anything is there anything you can do for my boy and say bring them to me we ought to be in situations like Jesus where we can tell people bring that situation here bring that circumstance here because there's virtue to be able to handle the situation oh my god there is knowledge and patience and temperance and God loves to be able to handle the situation Jesus bring the situation here and Jesus Jesus you know dealt with the boy and got the spirit cast out of another type of light well why could we do the same because of your unbelief your unbelief and say not only that these kind only go out by fasting and by prayer but the real problem was their unbelief that's where the real sin is they had a situation where it was insufficient funds look in your own life has there been some circumstances where there's been some insufficient funds where people could not get from you what God ordained you to give them I looked at this and you know I want to use a man a couple of things here oh my god my god we read about ass there at the beginning and I'm I'm using a man the statue of her commanders my foundation but when we talk about war strategies amen where there's gonna be a couple different angles that I'm hitting this from but we talked about acid and how he you know he was there you know just just kind of believing God for you know him to show up in this battle that he was fighting but there was a time and an ass's life that I want to just kind of go back to and I want to read this in a second you know he got this victory over all these Ethiopians but you know there was a time where there was insufficient funds and assets life answer did a lot of great things a lot of great things here you know I can show where he depended completely on God and God brought them out of this battle with the Ethiopians Eve I mean he showed up didn't have to battle he was standing there with virtue with fortitude which strength even he was standing there in that place my god but but there was a time where acid did not do that and I wonder I want to bring this forth to you we're gonna go to second chronicles 16 as we get that lined up it's gonna be verse 7 2nd chronicles 16 asks her had the people renew their faith in their commitment to God under his reign there was another thing great that AXA did his mother was actually sacrificing to Idol God since she was a queen answer had his mama dethrone taken off the throne because she was sacrificing some Idol God that's that's a pretty big thing for you I fought for a man to do the call says mama to say no you're not gonna be queen no more because you sacrificed tonight Oh God that's a that's a tremendous Dana I have to commend the man like that hallelujah but there was a time whereas amen through insufficient funds because he did not depend on the Lord now look at this in second chronicles 16 oh my let's look at verse 7 and I want to I want to just kind of also say to you that there are times where you might draw some insufficient funds because you didn't depend on the Lord you might have been dependent on yourself a man you might have been dependent on you know just your ability but you got to depend on the Lord in all things hallelujah glory to God amen and here we find a situation verse 7 I like this and at that time and let me let me let me also give you what what happened acid was getting ready to go to another battle and what he did was reach out to another king of another country and asked him to kind of come and make a make a league with him and and and and and and make it a league with him he took took money out of the temple and and gave it to this King and say make a league with me and now now when you're making it make a league with me break your league with the other king over there he tried to pay him off now the problem was after acid did that now the king did exactly what he actually do but after he did it after got a visitation from a prophet oh my goodness I love this you know because sometimes after we go through situations you can also get a visitation from the Prophet how through listening to the message and through listening to the message you know what you can do as I got a rebuke from the Prophet you know you can also get a rebuke from the Prophet just by listening to the man oh my god oftentimes were you listening or maybe somebody sent out a quote like oh Lord I didn't see from that angle but the good thing is that you humble yourself to what you heard the prophecy did not humble himself and he endured I'm in this condition with a pretty bad condition because he didn't humble himself after you heard what the Prophet said now let's read verse 7 says and at that time had an eye of the the seer came to ask a king of Judah and said unto him because thou has relied on the king of Syria now remember in this first battle he was crying out to God and praying and God God delivered he said because thou has relied on king of syria we talked about that this morning and you know in Sunday school I was I was sharing how I was reading there and then the church age book and brother branham's telling story about the the the young man in Africa and he had a little Idol that he carried around he had a little tag on his neck that said he was a Christian but he had an idol that carried around and brother Ram said well why is he carrying an idol if he's a Christian so him and the mayor got out and they started talking to the young man they say well my daddy gave me this and you know and and and and say you know I carry this Idol just in case something go wrong cuz this thing deliver my daddy for some major major things and say what happens - there were some Lions was the lion was stalking my daddy coming after him and he said my daddy built a fire and when he built the fire did he start talking to this Idol and the lion left him alone so predators brother Prem said oh it wasn't it wasn't the idol that delivers your daddy it was the fire because our animals aren't afraid of fire he said he said oh I was just saying if a moria the spirit fails then I don't want hallelujah and I asked a question to the solicitor class how many a man already got a plan B after your plan a fails huh your plan is I'm a pray about this thing but if it don't come in the time that I need it I'm going to plan me and I want to just let you know right now you never had a plan a plan B was your plan a and that's why God ain't do nothing listen if you can do a garden go to it [Music] you gotta get totally dependent Asha was in that battle he was totally dependent I got an army surrounding me they did that the arm is much greater than us god help us when you get like that gotta move hallelujah alright let's go on I want to read this way this is a good script I just love this scripture so at that time had a 9 the seer came to answer because now this is a second matter that he's in he did not rely on God he relied on the king of Syria look at this he says ask the king of Judah and sending him because thou hast relied on the king of Syria and not relied on the Lord that God therefore it is the host of the king of Syria escape out of thine hand now therefore is the host of the king of Syria escape got it on him were not to eat the opens he's reminding him of what God did because this is insufficient funds on Isis part right we're not we're not the Ethiopians amen and Lubin and the Lubin a large a huge host with very many chariots and horsemen yet because thou didst rely on the Lord he delivers them into that hand now this is the verse I love for the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him let me just just highlight that God is actually looking for something to get involved in [Music] God is God God God is waiting for you to invite him into your impossible situation he actually looking for something that he can place his stamp oh oh yeah when the Hebrew boys was amen couldn't go that's why couldn't go it was a god-sized job and let me tell you something you got some situations you see God is the only plan honey if he says no Denise just know I want to get to a spot where there's no it's just as good as his yes and I'm just as satisfied with a know that I am with a yes for the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong on behalf of them whose heart it's perfect toward him hearing thou has done foolishly therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars so when we look at this situation as through insufficient funds when he was faced with this circumstance and often times in our life we would draw insufficient funds as brother Branham said we would draw insufficient funds in the area of virtue when we're faced with certain certain certain circumstances we don't want that to be the case now let me go on a little further here a man oh my I was reading a man to you all first Pete I mean a second second Peter one and we read it a man from the King James Version but I want to read a man verse 3 through 7 from the emphatic diag lot so you can a man just pull up 2nd Peter 1:3 on the screen and start at verse 3 hallelujah but I want to read it from the emphatic die Glocke you can read it on the screen but I'm gonna read it from the emphatic dagger-like verse 3 says even at his even as his divine power has granted to us all things related to life in piety through the knowledge of him who called us by glory and virtue verse 4 on account of which very great and precious promises have been bestowed on us so that through these you might become partakers of a divine nature having fled away from the corruption that is in the world through lust verse 5 this is important and for this very thing also using all diligence the scripture I mean an emphatic dog - exactly it says superhead right there says and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue but in an emphatic dr. Bagla it says super add to your faith fortitude hallelujah so when it uses the word virtue in the Amen in the King James and emphatic doctors use the word fortitude super add to your faith fortitude and to fortitude knowledge verse 6 and to knowledge self-control my god we don't get into that we ain't there yet but to your knowledge you must add self-control what good would it be to have all this head knowledge and can't control yourself so to your knowledge you must add self-control and notice that our actual set it's super add to knowledge self-control and a self-control patience of the patience piety to party brother Conor brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness love now I love that that statement of super add I was looking at that and it means to add something to what it's already been in it super admins to add something to what has already been added that's why you know it was important that first quote that I read to you that when you're born again you already have faith you're not adding to it but you're super adding oh my you're adding something to something that's already there Oh hallelujah that is that's powerful to me because the devil would like to tell you that you ain't got it you failed here you fail there and you ain't got it super and when it run out go back to the resource that gets along when Jesus felt virtual leave somehow virtue got back in there for him to go to Jerry's house come on somebody so when you feel like the devil I mean not the devil but maybe God has used you and maybe maybe when these virtues have been tested in and maybe somebody's pulled I've drawn this out of you God will put it back in if you feed yourself a lot of time this is what happened as we go through trial the first thing we do is run from church we run from the Word of God no I mean the way you've got ad is by our super address by by by feeding yourself on the Word of God sometimes you feed yourself you might get rebuked by a prophet nothing wrong with that let me go a little further oh my fortitude it says add to your your it says super add to super add to your faith fortitude into fortitude knowledge so we're using that word fortitude we're using that word fortitude it's also in our King James says virtue but I'm pulling from the emphatic Diagon today and I'm using the word fortitude when we when we just give a definition a man of a virtue its strength its power it's its ability a man also when we when we look at brother Branham said in one place virtue is strength power that's what he said in the church's book it's its strength I mean I'm sorry in the statue of a burger man he said its strength power that's what virtue is but I'm also using this definition a man from of of my fortitude be encouraged its having courage in pain or adversity fortitude or virtue would be having courage in pain or adversity having courage and pain or adversity now let me just read here you know I think of a couple people that we could look at but I want to go back to second chronicles a man we're gonna read from their chapter 13 but I think of one one man that had virtue and a man and had courage he had fortitude was Gideon he was called a mighty man of Valor and what that meant he had boldness or determination and facing great danger he had boldness or determination when he was facing great danger especially in battle he had heroic courage bravery David could also be considered this category Samson with a jawbone that man that take courage to stand up there face of thousand Philistines with a jawbone hallelujah it take courage you know and look if Samson can do that with a jawbone and overcome I don't know what you're facing a man gotta get in your jawbone if God if God needs you to use a jawbone God will get in your jawbone brother branham say one hit against one of them one of them he'll miss it should've broke the jump on the first time he hit it if it would have broke the jawbone I believe Samson could have used his hands and still beat down a thousand Philistines that's why I said Michelle something that last week what's that you got in your hand God can use it if you're willing to lose him take take not not not not a lot but take the little you have and God will make it crane come on church man I'm encouraging myself I might have a little but my god it's able to multiply and you'll make it grand oh my he's el shaddai he's all that we need he needs us to depend on him get rid of Plan B God we only got one plan you hallelujah it took it took fortitude virtues strength power for some of these people to face some of the challenges that they face I just read to you about awesome but I had a father by the name of Abijah Abijah and he's my example when we talk about war strategies virtue he's the one I want to use as my example today of a man that had hurt you yet strength he had grit he had determination he had courage yeah power can I tell you something you might be going through something don't run from it run to it amen oftentimes when you know what I want to face it no no no dude you're not showing fur to not showing courage you're not showing run to this thing oh my god it might cause a little death to yourself but you know unless a corner week go on the ground and die it will abide alone I want to say that again unless your corner week goes into the ground and dies it will abide alone the reason that some of us are alone is because we won't put our corner wheat in the ground and no I don't think y'all hear me your situation won't change until you take your corner wheat into the ground and die if you die it'll bring forth much fruit Oh daddy yourself daddy of thoughts daddy are ideas that to your ways Datta who you think you are amen amen this is just who we are my family has always been like this well which family is greater your family are God's family mmm because the family of God it's supposed to be manifest in this so which which which which characteristics or traits dominate hello somebody praise the Lord is this okay this morning hallelujah glory to God amen we want to look like Christ he's the head of this family if I want to look like my dad I act like my daddy let my daddy be Christ all right all right this man I be job or abide I felt like he showed some fortitude or virtue while he was in battle a man and and and and this battle is a battle between Judah and Israel this is this is a this is a closer battle than fighting Philistines this is a man this is this is a much more difficult battle Amen when you fightin your own brothers hallelujah I hope you understand you know your greatest trials would be the trials you faced in the church y'all ain't heard it your greatest trials are gonna be the ones that happen right inside the church glory to God and you're gonna be thinking to yourself they should've did detonation have said that they gotta love them you know Davis greatest trial was when he was actually leaving Amen and his son kicked him off the throne not only did his son he came to this boy raised up eating all his groceries y'all hear me eating all his groceries I'm going out to bed and I'm getting Spaulding up bringing it home and kick me off my floor and as David is all the way leaving it's crying and then you get another fella by the name of Shimei or shimmy I say oh you finally got capture you should've never been King in the first place do you know David I've been waiting for a day like this he just picking up rocks and pants and and bottles and throwing it at David and when a davis miss it should we let that that dog's head stay on his body he say leave him alone you got enough in the English to be able to do that leave him alone maybe God is letting him do this are you gonna

who the first person to come me David once sir Oh spirit gotta want me and I don't know what happened oh that's my count we talked about the character Jesus you say David say yeah you're not gonna die don't worry about it she may just stay right here you know you're gonna be all right and then when he was getting ready to leave the scene they called his son Solomon there's a guy in your kingdom by the name of Jimmy how you remember how he did me son I promised him that I wouldn't kill him I wouldn't do nothing to him I was gonna let him be all right you know I mean everything good some but watch him okay daddy Jimmy I have the David dies he comes with full solid man so I'm gonna serving I'm gonna do this it's something that here's the thing just stay in your house don't get involved in nothing just in your house thing you'll play staying yo lang right staying your Lang everything will be all right Jimmy I said that's got that no problem Thanks couple years later Jimmy I had two

a - Mei what yeah you left you die and see the thing what is it wasn't that he died for what he did he actually died for what he didn't do and what he didn't do was stay home I want to talk about a bi job this man is asses father he demonstrated total total dependence on God forwarded to virtue while he was in battle the other thing is he's fighting against he's representing Judah which the children Israel they were they were one under Solomon I mean under under David and under Solomon but when Solomon died the children Israel split all right you got two kingdoms you got the children Israel didn't get with children Judah underneath ray of bones ring I'm talking by boy I hope y'all with me today all right so so so so now what we have here is an issue the children of Judah are under a by just rain but the children of Israel on the share of bones ring I'll stay with me here watch this here's a battle getting ready to take place abaya the king of Judah has four hundred thousand warriors a man but Jeroboam knew he had more warriors because there was more trottin more tribes underneath his reign he came to the battle with eight hundred thousand warriors and it's already sound like a problem but let's read this is Scripture oh I love this I love this second chronicles thirteen verse eight a by just actually speaking to Jeroboam and the children Israel before they actually intend to this battle it says now you think to withstand the kingdom of the Lord in the hand of the sons of David and he'd be a great multitude and there with you golden calves which Jeroboam ate you for God's now what initially what he was telling him God established the kingdom of David God promised David that he'd always have somebody on the throne somebody in his lineage would always be on the throne and here a visor is in there and he's saying God said these things I'm not just only stone just because I want to be here but God said these things God is doing this right so so so he's there talking and he said now now you all have already forsaken God y'all already feel sick God and then it's a neat thing you gotta go in he's gonna go and just kind of tell him a few things that they've done he says now on you coming against me and you got you got golden calves and you miss now that mean you got Idol gods in your midst and you're trying to tell me something and you want to come fight against me and you got Idol gods in your myths and now remember this is this is brother to brother fighting this is this is this is the nation of Israel that's divided but it's probably the brother and he said not now we've got the priests we still following the laws of God y'all got golden calves and idols you know what God did to the children of Israel and in the days of Moses you know what happened and y'all went right back to all of that now now stay with me here look if look at this man Abijah first thing I like about him is for the tools that he stand with the word that's one thing he stand with the word look at this look at this verse 9 he not cast out the priests of the Lord Jeroboam actually put the priests out of this of the city these are people that God established to handle the holy things of God this man has put them out he says have you not cast out the priests of the Lord the sons of Aaron and the Levites and have major priests after the man of the nations of other lands so they make their own priests they're not following you know people can still do that today they make to church and they don't that you know oh my oh my and and just let one person in the family be call hello there's some going that church there light no one person they found this call guess what just happened Church gets got started praise the Lord hallelujah and man look at this now he'd say he says major priests after the main after the manner of the nations of the other lands so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullet and seven Rams the same maybe a priest of them that are no gods now they're making priests you know out of men that got back that did not call in order to be a priest in Israel you had to be born into this lineage but they're making these men preach this because they have a certain offering look at it look at it verse 10 I love Abijah but as for us the Lord is like God we're not serving a golden calves I'm not like that the Lord is our God this is fortitude this is strength this is virtue this man got this man is this man this man got something but that's what the Lord is our God and we have not forsaken him and the priest which medicine to the Lord are the sons of Aaron and the Levites wait upon their business let's keep going and they burned into the Lord every morning and every even these are the things that Moses established and they said we found them in the Word of God hallelujah sometimes you got to be able to remind God I'm following standing there with fortitude don't back up hallelujah somebody look look say you say say say they brining them to the Lord every morning every evening burnt sacrifices sweet incense the showbread also set there in order upon the pure table and the candlestick of gold with the lamps therefore thereof to burn every every evening for we keep the charge of the Lord I got but ye have forsaken him it says in behold God Himself is with us for our captain I want to know who's leading you this morning who is your captain God Himself is with us for our captain this man is talking remember his arm is twice - twice as small as the other army but yea he's keeping this thing aligned with the Word of God we're doing things according to the Word of God and if I'm doing things according to the Word of God than I expect God to back up what I'm doing let's go let's go let's go verse verse 12 well God Himself is with us for our captain and it's priest with sounding trumpets the cry alarm against you O children Israel fight here not against the Lord God of your father's for he shall not prosper see now you coming against us but you're not fighting us you fighting God that's what he's trying to get him see I love Abijah he goes on and look at this verse 13 now while he's talking while a by just reminding them of all these things that they've done wrong look at this but Jeroboam calls an ambushment to come about behind them so they were before Judah and the ambushment was behind them now I don't know about you you might be facing something where you don't I mean here you were facing this and all of a sudden something else just come out of nowhere and you wonder where in the world that come from and you wonder how in the world am I gonna get through this not if I get over this mountain I got another mountain facing me and and then Lord I don't even I have no idea what to do in the midst of this God I'm I'm confused I thought you were with me but you allowing all these things they hit me at one time I got I got I just got as I read this the first thing came to my mind when I read this here here here Abijah is spinning there amen declaring these things about God and how they've been serving God and now the enemy has him surrounded can I just say it like this it may look like because if you just stopped at verse 13 it may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by you no matter here's the thing as we go forward we're gonna see what they did I said this earlier I said this early this is why I'm it's up to me I didn't I didn't catch it while I was studying but it came to me while I was here you know we're gonna leave this earth shouting do you know how amen Joshua with him overcame Jericho they let out a great shout hallelujah we're gonna find out that a bank shot the way today overcame in this battle is they also let out a shout now here's the thing with me my my my my my my interpretation of shouting might be different than what the scripture is actually stating amen they might be saying just raise your voice and I'm okay with that too don't come to church with your switcher with your your shower please come to church with your loud has multiple meanings [Applause] look at this first 14 and when Judah looked back behold the battle was before and behind the Bible says and they cried unto the Lord I mean they start praying and when they when they did that then the priests sound it with the trumpets next verse the men of Judah gave up gave a shout that I wonder when's the last time you just gave a shout not not because you so something that God did but just something that you want to do for God God I'm coming today even if they don't sing my song I'm gonna give you a shout I'm gonna grab a hold of check I just had to come give God a shout I'm not anything in those shout music but sound sometimes they show the devil his place [Music] right I think the devil get a headache because he's under your feet right I believe he get a headache when you begin to like I told you the words can have multiple meanings it could be a movement of the feet or it could be raising your voice or whatever let out a shot sometime come to church with that that that that quiet voice the dignified one come come with the shout what are the last time you dig God I just want to give a shout out to tell about yeah man I came no you made it a church this-this-this man the men of Judah gave a shout and notice this description as the men of Judah shouted so it's why you shot me God is moving not why you know why you let me tell you when you get in action God get in action it has the minute you to shout it it came to pass that God smote terrible and all Israel before a be job and Judah here's another one they not even faint they just showed up to the battle God did the fighting because they had enough fortitude enough virtue to stand there amen and faced a thing that they were facing keeping it aligned with the Word of God look we've done this we've done that we're doing this so you can have virtue when you when you when you're standing like that god I know what I've done fast and I'm praying I'm this God I'm doing everything that you asked me to do and this devil still coming against me all the thing I know I'm gonna be defeated I can't tell you how I come through this thing but I'm gonna stand here and because I'm going through don't mean I'm a quick church I told you you know you might be able to take this and you might be able to take that but you're gonna take my praise God been too good to me I don't know about what he's done for you but I'm talking about for me he'd been too good to me for me to let the devil take my face my brother Jean tell us all the time tell us that story about the husband and wife and it was fussing and fighting before they come into the church I said the wife was just a little trouble she just just couldn't really enter into service because of what had just happened at the house or in the car and the husband came to church in glory just worshiping and praising God he's done he's going out of his way to praise God yelling screaming and pollen and the wife just sitting there looking at him and then after church they get in the car and she like how could you be in church to another yelling screaming knowing what you and I just went through you know the reason I can do this because Jesus didn't do nothin to me you did and since he didn't do not to me I'm not gonna let emotional leakage seep out of our situation and block me from freezing now that don't mean you don't need to go back and try to fix them thanks but don't let the devil take your praise in the midst of it what I'm saying I'm gonna give him no victory I praise them what I'm going through I'm gonna have some fortitude I'm have some virtue my has some strength i'ma stand right here and I'ma worship God virtue is strength power do you still got strength to be able to praise them when you're going through got to have it that's the character Christ that we talking about and when you got that people be looking for that from you brother branham made the statement how Reverend mr. Linley he had to have virtue they say he say everything come to take from Reverend mr. Lilley and and sometimes they you know what every time I turn around this one taken from me that when taken from me that would take yeah that's the way it's supposed to be but what do you really looking for is the spiritual things from here you say Reverend mr. Lilley always said when they come in and take this from him take that one from he see he just he give to the first man and he just willingly give to the next one and Willie he just keep giving the everybody that come and get some but that little e you got to understand something about the lily it just it just just didn't pop up the overnight it didn't pop up they overnight it had to go through some stuff underneath the water see some things that folk going through right now you can't see because on the top they look good but underneath they've really facing some stuff hallelujah but underneath that water underneath them it's not just water but it's mucking my room and clean and I mean it's just it's just nasty stuff it's got the workers way Sun constantly hitting it wise in that condition and drawing the lily to the top and once it gets to the top everything come to get it and maybe the reason you go on through what you're going through because you might see yourself underneath but maybe you already own time [Applause] Laurie [Applause] that's it that's the shout even when you're going through letter shouts like that because why you situation and you begin to church [Music] [Applause] [Applause] this word is real this were to pull us out of whatever it is that we have remind God obligor remind it this is what we've done the priests are serving they given the offerings they're doing everything they're bringing in the sacrifice we serve a living God we ain't got no golden calves over here and because we're doing this when we get ourselves in trouble our Gaga's you act here's what we do here's what we do we show up he shows happy [Applause] thank you Jesus thank you Lord Jesus God your word makes the difference penetrates goes through the the depths of whatever it is that we are facing God it moves in ways that we never even imagined thank you for drawing us closer to you father thank you for showing us our shortcomings and showing us Lord our victories father I just I just pray that God these won't just be words that would just go in one day or not the other way Lord let it be something that really registers on the inside let it make the difference in us God we we appreciate you we look at look back at these various characters in Scripture and we can see Lord just we can see Lord a portion of ourselves into them help us Lord to display the same fortitude [Music] with strength and virtue Lord we super add it to the faith that was already given to us once we were born again in God if there any Lord that have not experienced that new birth have not been born again the way that you've told Nicodemus you must be born again it wasn't a maybe or perhaps it was it was necessary fully necessary for us to be born again not just coming to church Lord but birth must take place that old nature must die and the nature of Christ must come forward I pray God that we would hear these things as the Spirit of God speaks it to us oh Jesus be glorified in us be magnified be exalted bless your people Lord thank you for Lord just speaking to our hearts God we give you the glory we give you the honor we give you the praise some Jesus
