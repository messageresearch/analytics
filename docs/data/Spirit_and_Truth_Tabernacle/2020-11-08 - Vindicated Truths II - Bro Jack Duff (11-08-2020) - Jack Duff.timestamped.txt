[34:48] [Music]
[34:52] certainly good to be in the house of
[34:53] lords
[34:55] this morning
[35:00] i think all the announcements were given
[35:03] i just had one other that i needed to
[35:06] make mention while we're doing that just
[35:08] actually get your bibles and
[35:11] we'll prepare to go into the word of the
[35:13] lord on today
[35:15] uh praise god
[35:20] amen um outside i'll have a
[35:25] card sister brown st
[35:28] augustine is turning 90 years old
[35:31] and um so from the church i figured we
[35:33] would just send a card just
[35:35] everyone have it outside after service
[35:37] if you just write a little note there to
[35:39] her and
[35:40] man just something to encourage her just
[35:42] to wish her happy birthday
[35:44] i greatly appreciate that we want to do
[35:47] that for her i also
[35:48] forgot to mention on last week that in
[35:50] our pantry
[35:52] we had last month we served 739 people
[35:57] and grateful that god gave us the
[35:59] opportunity to do that
[36:00] and i was mentioning on wednesday night
[36:03] that
[36:05] we wanted to see if we could try to
[36:08] bless
[36:08] the families that are coming to the
[36:10] pantry to get food we want to bless them
[36:12] with turkeys for thanksgiving
[36:14] and um so we're just asking everyone
[36:16] like rather than do the gift cards that
[36:18] we typically do for
[36:20] um for christmas we like to try to do
[36:23] something for the
[36:24] these families at thanksgiving so if you
[36:27] would like to
[36:28] just give a little something one of
[36:30] these envelopes that we have sitting on
[36:31] the table we ask
[36:32] that you just if you could just uh cash
[36:35] only
[36:35] uh just take one of these envelopes not
[36:37] on the tithe and offer them
[36:39] one of these and just right on that
[36:40] pantry and uh and our goal is just to
[36:43] try to bless
[36:44] every family with a turkey we have
[36:46] roughly about 45
[36:47] 50 families that kind of come through on
[36:49] a weekly basis and we want to just be a
[36:51] blessing to them
[36:52] if we could so if you desire to do that
[36:56] just put it there
[36:57] we'll make sure it gets to the proper
[36:59] hands and
[37:00] we'll just be a blessing amen to these
[37:02] families in whatever way we can
[37:04] so i certainly appreciate that the lord
[37:07] bless you
[37:08] thank you musicians amen i appreciate
[37:10] you all
[37:11] thank you sister sarah for the special
[37:13] and uh
[37:14] uh brother solomon and leadness and
[37:16] worship amen just so
[37:18] so good to see everybody in the house of
[37:20] god
[37:21] amen amen praise the lord good to see
[37:24] sister ruth
[37:25] amen praise god amen
[37:29] amen praise god
[37:33] uh so um
[37:36] um uh i want to read
[37:39] amen um scripture
[37:43] we will go back to the book of john and
[37:46] we will read from there we are carrying
[37:50] uh forward in our thought from last week
[37:52] and what we
[37:53] spoke um on vindicated truths
[37:57] and um there uh
[38:00] in all honesty i have a uh
[38:04] i have probably uh today's sermon and
[38:07] next week's sermon will probably still
[38:08] stay in the same channel
[38:10] and uh and and i was pushing to preach
[38:14] next week's sermon but the holy spirit
[38:18] i want you to just deal with this part
[38:20] today so i don't know why he wanted me
[38:22] to do it but i i've learned to be
[38:24] obedient
[38:25] i learned not to wrestle uh with god
[38:29] right even if what i say is only for one
[38:31] person
[38:32] then that is for the glory of god
[38:35] amen not not for the glory of jack duff
[38:37] amen so
[38:39] i'll just submit myself to him and allow
[38:42] him to
[38:42] be glorified here today but we we
[38:46] want to read here let's start at verse
[38:48] 19 in uh
[38:49] john chapter one
[38:53] praise god amen john chapter one we'll
[38:56] start at verse 19.
[38:58] um
[39:03] amen praise the lord
[39:11] says um and this is the record of john
[39:16] when the jews sent priests and levites
[39:19] from jerusalem to ask him who art thou
[39:23] and he confessed and denied not but
[39:25] confess
[39:27] i am not the christ amen so john was
[39:31] very very
[39:32] uh specific in that now if you all know
[39:35] the um i mean we know scripture
[39:38] and we know that um as uh
[39:41] uh john the baptist was sent to forerun
[39:44] the first coming
[39:45] uh then uh there'd be another spirit of
[39:48] elijah to come to forerun the second
[39:50] coming
[39:51] and uh and also in knowing that uh it's
[39:56] uh the spirit of elijah is uh used in
[39:59] such a powerful way
[40:01] that uh unfortunately are people that
[40:03] get confused
[40:05] along the journey and uh and they
[40:08] begin to think that uh man this could be
[40:11] christ
[40:12] right uh there were people that got
[40:15] brother branham confused like that and
[40:16] when
[40:17] when when they got it confused uh with
[40:19] brother branham
[40:20] uh being in a certain certain position
[40:23] it caused the prophet to come to the
[40:24] pulpit and say i'm coming off
[40:26] the field right so
[40:29] uh so when we when we see things like
[40:32] this happen
[40:33] amen in the prophet's ministry all we
[40:35] got to do is go back to the scripture
[40:37] and see that it's already happened
[40:38] before amen so
[40:40] and and i can i'll just be honest with
[40:42] you brother branham say there is
[40:43] a spirit that actually comes
[40:47] into the land to cause people to do what
[40:51] they do
[40:54] come on church now see i'm the problem
[40:57] with the spirit is that you can
[41:00] see it with your natural eye
[41:03] sometimes you can't even feel it
[41:09] right but but but but with a spirit
[41:12] a man is only uh expressed through
[41:15] manifestation
[41:19] right so that that's when we know it's a
[41:21] spirit based on what it
[41:23] manifests all right
[41:26] all right right so so uh he says uh it
[41:29] says this and scripture says and he
[41:30] confessed and
[41:31] uh do not not but confess i am not the
[41:34] christ
[41:35] and they asked him what then art
[41:38] thou elijah and he says i am not
[41:43] art thou that prophet now see
[41:47] um now he's not lying when he say he's
[41:49] not elijah
[41:50] he's not elijah but he is john with the
[41:54] spirit of
[41:54] elijah you understand he's not elijah
[41:58] but he is john with the spirit of elijah
[42:01] right and so so then they asked the
[42:03] question art thou
[42:04] that prophet and the prophet that
[42:06] they're referring to is the one that
[42:07] john
[42:08] said i mean moses said the lord thy god
[42:11] shall raise up unto your prophet like
[42:12] unto me
[42:13] so they're asking john the baptist these
[42:15] things that says i am not art thou that
[42:17] prophet
[42:18] and he answered no glory to god and he
[42:21] says
[42:21] um then said they unto him who art thou
[42:25] they couldn't be satisfied with these
[42:28] mysterious
[42:29] answers right who art thou that we may
[42:31] give and answer to them that sent
[42:33] us what sayest doubt of thyself
[42:37] glory to god i like that it says he said
[42:40] i
[42:41] am the voice of one crying
[42:44] in the wilderness makes straight the way
[42:48] of the lord uh as said the prophet
[42:51] isaiah so he he identifies himself in
[42:55] the word of god
[42:56] and it says um and they which were sent
[42:58] were of the pharisees
[43:00] and they asked him and said unto him why
[43:03] baptizes thou then if thou be
[43:05] not that christ nor elijah neither
[43:09] that prophet now so they were looking
[43:12] for
[43:13] some things but they weren't looking for
[43:17] all things because john just identified
[43:21] who spoke of him he just told him
[43:25] it's in the words it's right here in
[43:27] scripture
[43:28] isaiah spoke this go back and look at it
[43:30] but they're not even concerned about it
[43:32] oh my think about it now says um
[43:36] uh john answered them saying i baptized
[43:39] with water
[43:40] but there standeth one among you whom ye
[43:43] know not
[43:44] here it is who coming after me
[43:47] is preferred before me whose shoes
[43:50] latches i am not worthy to unloose
[43:53] say these things were done in beth beth
[43:55] arbor
[43:56] beyond jordan where john was baptized
[43:58] and the next day
[44:02] john see of jesus coming unto him and
[44:04] saith behold the lamb of god
[44:06] which taketh away the sin of the world
[44:09] this
[44:10] is he of whom i said after me cometh a
[44:13] man
[44:14] which is preferred before me for he was
[44:17] before me and i
[44:18] knew him not but that he should be made
[44:22] manifest to israel therefore am i come
[44:25] baptizing with water
[44:26] and john bear record saying i saw the
[44:28] spirit descending from heaven like a
[44:30] dove and it evolved upon him
[44:32] and i knew him not uh but he that
[44:36] sent me to baptize with water the same
[44:38] said unto me
[44:39] upon whom thou shalt see the spirit
[44:41] descending and remaining on
[44:43] uh remaining on him the same is he which
[44:46] baptizes with the holy ghost
[44:48] and i saw and bear record that this
[44:51] is the son of god all right we will stop
[44:55] our reading there
[44:57] we will bow in a brief word of prayer
[45:01] uh and um
[45:04] let the lord just carry us here this
[45:06] morning
[45:08] lord we thank you for
[45:11] the privilege that we have to stand in
[45:14] your presence
[45:18] it's um we don't take it lightly that we
[45:21] come to church uh there's uh
[45:24] we realize just through our study on
[45:27] wednesday nights
[45:28] through the book of ephesians that you
[45:31] actually had to go to a cross and die in
[45:34] order for
[45:35] us to be able to come to church and and
[45:38] lord we're grateful for that so we don't
[45:40] take this
[45:40] this lightly but we also know according
[45:42] to prophecy there is going to come
[45:44] a day where we will not be allowed to
[45:48] walk through the church doors
[45:51] and god your prophet has told us that
[45:53] they'll put padlocks on the doors and
[45:55] so we need to take advantage of the time
[45:58] that we do have and
[46:00] and my prayer is that uh lord we can get
[46:02] ourselves out of the way that you could
[46:04] speak
[46:05] uh i know that you have grabbed the
[46:07] attention of the people
[46:09] you've allowed certain things to occur
[46:12] uh so people uh interests are picking up
[46:15] but lord uh i pray that it'll go deeper
[46:19] uh than an election lord i pray that uh
[46:23] people would
[46:23] really get their hearts right with you i
[46:25] i pray that
[46:27] lord folk would really draw not not just
[46:29] to know what the prophet said
[46:31] amen but to know jesus
[46:34] god we need relationship with the lord
[46:37] jesus
[46:38] uh and god my prayers that while you got
[46:40] the people's attention do something
[46:42] special for the people anchor them uh
[46:45] in the faith anchor them in amen in an
[46:48] experience so send father
[46:50] uh the ring into this place today father
[46:54] we just
[46:54] invite you to come and take complete
[46:57] control
[46:58] of this service be glorified and
[47:00] magnified and exalted
[47:02] in this place in jesus name we pray amen
[47:05] amen god bless you you can be seated
[47:09] we will continue our journey in
[47:12] vindicated truths
[47:18] this is part two and like i said i
[47:20] believe that there will
[47:22] be a third part to this uh particular
[47:24] sermon
[47:25] and um now in order for me to be
[47:29] obedient to what the the lord
[47:30] said for me to do i'm gonna have to do
[47:34] my best to avoid
[47:35] saying some things praise the lord
[47:40] because if i if i started down a
[47:42] particular channel today i already know
[47:45] which way we would end up going amen but
[47:48] i want to be obedient so
[47:50] i'm going gonna do all i can initially
[47:52] just to avoid
[47:53] saying some things uh this is greater
[47:57] what we're what we're dealing with is a
[47:59] lot greater than what you see
[48:02] praise the lord it's what we're dealing
[48:04] with is a lot greater than what you see
[48:06] amen and and and i don't want us to be
[48:11] um uh
[48:14] twin tower christians
[48:22] praise the lord amen twin tower church
[48:26] members
[48:27] you understand we don't want to be like
[48:29] that you know
[48:30] walmart ran out of bibles to sell when
[48:33] the towers went down
[48:35] you understand right and and so
[48:39] if you're a believer amen the things
[48:42] that you're seeing
[48:44] uh you read in the paper 87 years ago
[48:51] all right let me read this quote
[48:56] i'll come back to that in a little bit
[48:59] okay so here um i want to read from
[49:02] this quote what shall we do with jesus
[49:04] call christ
[49:06] what shall we do with jesus call christ
[49:09] uh the prophet
[49:10] makes these statements he says um
[49:13] you may say to me brother uh brother
[49:16] branham you got
[49:18] the wrong interpretation of it
[49:22] brother branham you got the wrong
[49:23] interpretation of it
[49:25] and uh he says well that's that's to
[49:28] your opinion
[49:29] amen amen glory to god that's your
[49:31] opinion
[49:33] god don't need any interpreter right
[49:36] amen god is his own interpreter
[49:40] so that's what the trouble of it is
[49:41] today we got
[49:43] too many man-made
[49:47] interpreters god can interpret
[49:51] i like that amen uh he says uh
[49:55] god can interpret himself his own
[49:57] vindication
[49:58] of his word is the interpretation
[50:03] i want to say that again his own
[50:06] vindication
[50:07] of his word is the interpretation
[50:11] amen the pharisees might have cried out
[50:13] too
[50:14] we got the interpretation the sadducees
[50:16] says we got him
[50:18] but jesus was the interpretation
[50:21] amen glory to god the manifestation
[50:26] of god's revealed power
[50:29] promised is the vindication
[50:33] i'ma say it again the manifestation of
[50:36] god's revealed power
[50:38] promised is the vindication says
[50:41] read the scriptures and see what the
[50:43] church is supposed to be today
[50:45] yes sir god don't need any interpreter
[50:48] that's what they've done to jesus they
[50:50] found out back there
[50:52] that that though he didn't have the
[50:54] interpretation
[50:55] he was the interpretation god didn't
[50:58] have to interpret it
[51:00] jesus's life interpreted he said search
[51:03] the scriptures
[51:04] from them you think you have eternal
[51:06] life they are they
[51:08] that testify of me and if i do not the
[51:11] works of my father
[51:12] then believe me not if the works that
[51:14] was spoken this day
[51:16] don't manifest itself in me he said then
[51:18] don't believe it
[51:20] now you know as we talk about these uh
[51:23] vindicated truths
[51:24] uh you know i want to just put a little
[51:27] emphasis on the lord jesus
[51:28] you know people had a problem uh you
[51:31] know
[51:32] we just read in the scripture we just
[51:34] read it uh here they come to
[51:36] john and they're asking now are you that
[51:39] prophet they was expecting the messiah
[51:42] they were looking for i mean for them to
[51:44] even ask the question
[51:46] they knew that the time of messiah to
[51:49] come
[51:50] must have been at hand hallelujah amen
[51:53] because
[51:54] the reason i can say is because they
[51:55] they're referring to particular
[51:57] scriptures
[51:58] they are under expectation for these
[52:00] scriptures to be manifested
[52:01] and when they see john do what he's
[52:04] doing now
[52:05] john never worked one miracle john john
[52:08] john ministry was so powerful yet
[52:10] never worked one miracle these people
[52:12] got confused saying
[52:13] are you that christ are you the one are
[52:16] you
[52:16] that prophet you know i mean you got all
[52:19] the all these people coming to your
[52:20] meetings
[52:21] but are you the one just saying no i'm
[52:23] not him i'm not him they were looking
[52:24] for it
[52:25] and john told say now the one you're
[52:28] looking for
[52:29] good god almighty the one you're looking
[52:32] for
[52:32] is standing amongst you right now
[52:38] they're looking forward and oh
[52:40] hallelujah church what
[52:41] amen i want to ask you what are you
[52:43] looking for this morning
[52:45] hallelujah because the one they were
[52:47] looking for was standing amongst them
[52:49] right then
[52:51] and uh and john's saying now now i know
[52:53] how to identify him when i see him
[52:56] glory there's certain things gonna
[52:57] happen when he comes down here to the
[52:59] water to be baptized and i'm going to be
[53:01] able to identify him when i see him
[53:02] because the same one that sent me gave
[53:06] me some information to be able to
[53:08] identify him when it comes
[53:11] so after john tells them amen on this
[53:13] disservice
[53:15] he says the one that you're looking for
[53:16] stand amongst you the bible say the very
[53:19] next day
[53:20] jesus comes walking into church i want
[53:23] to tell you something about jesus he
[53:25] loves
[53:26] going to church hallelujah
[53:30] he went to john's church amen and
[53:33] and and in their scripture where where
[53:35] the bible talks about how
[53:36] it was accustomed
[53:40] it was a custom for him to go to church
[53:42] and if it was
[53:43] customary for the lord jesus christ
[53:48] to go to church what you think about us
[53:52] amen all right they were looking for it
[53:55] they were expecting it
[53:57] amen and here he comes walking up uh
[54:00] fulfilling the very thing that they were
[54:01] looking for but because it didn't come
[54:03] the way that they wanted it to come
[54:05] they missed it all right let's keep
[54:08] going in this quote
[54:10] i don't need nobody a man trying to
[54:13] interpret he interprets himself
[54:15] when when he fulfills it he's
[54:17] interpreting the word himself now
[54:18] look at this amen uh uh uh
[54:22] paragraph 85 says did they did they do
[54:25] it
[54:26] god said a virgin shall conceive
[54:30] this was prophesied of the lord jesus a
[54:32] virgin shall conceive
[54:34] and she did do you believe it
[54:38] certainly but they didn't
[54:41] right we believe it but they didn't
[54:44] even though the bible declared that it
[54:46] was supposed to happen
[54:48] these religious leaders did not believe
[54:50] the bible that they were carrying all
[54:52] right
[54:54] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory
[54:57] to god now he says
[54:58] it says certainly but they didn't a
[55:00] virgin shall conceive and she did it
[55:02] said
[55:02] the lame shall walk the blind shall see
[55:06] when what would take place it proved
[55:08] they would do it and
[55:10] jesus was the manifestation
[55:14] right moses said the lord your god shall
[55:16] raise up a prophet like
[55:18] unto me the word comes to the prophet
[55:20] and the prophet
[55:22] the word is a discerner of the thoughts
[55:24] of the heart
[55:25] when they see him doing that discernment
[55:28] they said this is beelzebub a fortune
[55:30] teller
[55:31] that's no more than a name they pin on
[55:34] him the same thing today called a holy
[55:36] roll or something like that that's right
[55:38] he said he needs no interpretation he
[55:41] was the interpretation
[55:43] god proved it by himself who is that
[55:46] sinful man today or who is that sinful
[55:48] man then
[55:49] that would deny that the word wasn't
[55:51] interpreted
[55:53] now i can ask the same question right
[55:56] now who is the sinful man
[55:58] who is the sinful woman that will deny
[56:02] that the word is not interpreted
[56:05] amen and the way that god interprets his
[56:08] word is by
[56:08] manifesting it amen the manifestation
[56:13] is the interpretation all right
[56:16] glory to god the manifestation is
[56:19] the interpretation when you got a
[56:21] manifestation you don't have to argue
[56:23] with anybody
[56:26] amen you don't actually you don't even
[56:28] have to prove anything
[56:30] the manifestation proves it
[56:35] you know what believers do
[56:39] that's all we do believe amen we don't
[56:41] have to explain nothing to nobody we
[56:42] simply believe amen
[56:44] hallelujah all right let me go on uh he
[56:47] says
[56:47] uh he needs no interpretation he wants
[56:49] the interpretation god proved it by
[56:51] himself
[56:52] who is that sinful man today or who was
[56:54] that sinful man then
[56:55] that would deny that the word wasn't
[56:58] interpreted
[56:59] jesus asked them said search the
[57:02] scriptures
[57:03] they testify who i am they are the
[57:05] interpretation
[57:06] if my life doesn't interpret what i'm
[57:09] talking about
[57:10] then don't believe me he says what
[57:12] sinful man could be there
[57:15] could there be today that could look in
[57:17] the face of the bible
[57:18] and see if the holy spirit isn't the
[57:20] interpreter of the word today
[57:22] making himself known by manifestations
[57:26] of
[57:26] promises of the uh of the gifts and
[57:29] things that he promised to do in that
[57:31] day in this day
[57:32] malachi 4 being fulfilled all the rest
[57:35] of the scriptures being fulfilled
[57:36] and see it right here at the end of the
[57:39] time you don't need any man to interpret
[57:41] it no sir
[57:42] it interprets itself it proves
[57:45] it's the message of the hour repent
[57:49] that's it right there repent and turn to
[57:53] god
[57:54] hallelujah all the world you churches
[57:57] repent and turn to god don't try to wash
[58:01] them from your hands
[58:02] cause you can't do it the issue is right
[58:04] on now
[58:05] as it was then he said search the
[58:07] scriptures they testified me jesus said
[58:10] my works
[58:10] are my interpreter now i feel
[58:14] you know if jesus said search the
[58:15] scriptures i felt that it would be
[58:17] important for us maybe just to go back
[58:19] and just look at a couple of scriptures
[58:20] you know
[58:21] jesus himself was the interpretation
[58:24] amen or the manifestation or even the
[58:26] vindication
[58:28] of what god had wrote in his word now
[58:30] let's just go back and just search a few
[58:31] scriptures
[58:32] hallelujah john 5 39 is where we get
[58:35] this statement from jesus
[58:37] it says search the scriptures for in
[58:40] them
[58:40] you think you have eternal life and they
[58:43] are they which testify of me
[58:46] this is where jesus tells us that in
[58:48] john 5 39
[58:50] so let's go back and search a scripture
[58:53] genesis 3 15 hallelujah
[58:57] glory says search it they have day that
[58:59] testify of me
[59:01] glory let's look at genesis 3 15.
[59:04] the bible says and i will put enmity
[59:08] between thee and the woman between
[59:12] thy seed and her seed it shall bruise
[59:15] thy head
[59:16] and thou shalt bruise his heel now when
[59:19] we just look at that scripture
[59:21] we realize that a man according to the
[59:24] anatomy of the body
[59:26] a woman does not carry the seed
[59:29] the woman carries the egg hallelujah
[59:32] but here is a prophecy by god himself
[59:36] amen that i'm gonna put enmity between
[59:38] thee
[59:39] and the woman between thy sea and her
[59:41] seed
[59:43] so when jesus comes on the scene amen as
[59:46] the virgin born
[59:48] son of the living god he was fulfilling
[59:51] this
[59:52] prophecy in scripture hallelujah
[59:55] they called him amen every other name
[59:58] but the fulfillment of the word
[1:00:00] of god hallelujah amen here's another
[1:00:03] scripture isaiah 7 and 14
[1:00:05] amen isaiah 7 14
[1:00:08] glory the bible says therefore the lord
[1:00:11] himself
[1:00:12] shall give you a sign behold a virgin
[1:00:15] shall conceive and bear a son
[1:00:17] and shall call his name emmanuel so here
[1:00:21] when
[1:00:21] mary shows up pregnant not married to
[1:00:24] joseph
[1:00:25] amen they're they're spot i mean their
[1:00:27] spouse they're engaged to be married
[1:00:29] but here mary shows up with amen with
[1:00:32] this pregnancy and
[1:00:33] and the people just begin to criticize
[1:00:35] what was going on there
[1:00:37] hallelujah but failing to recognize
[1:00:40] that it was the fulfillment of scripture
[1:00:45] hallelujah amen today they they they're
[1:00:48] criticizing this message that we believe
[1:00:51] today they they criticize you for
[1:00:54] staying with the message
[1:00:56] hallelujah but they failed to see that
[1:00:58] this message
[1:00:59] was spoken of in scripture hallelujah we
[1:01:03] don't have to vindicate it god has
[1:01:05] already vindicated and i'm telling you
[1:01:08] there's
[1:01:08] many vindicated truths laying right here
[1:01:10] in the message
[1:01:12] the reason some of y'all are in church
[1:01:14] today
[1:01:15] is because you have recognized another
[1:01:18] vindicated truth
[1:01:22] amen hallelujah glory glory glory
[1:01:26] i'll tell you something about prophecy
[1:01:29] amen the wheels of prophecy
[1:01:32] turn really slow but they turn
[1:01:35] all right amen hallelujah the wheels of
[1:01:39] prophecy turn really slow
[1:01:42] brother adam come out in 1933
[1:01:45] and begin to give us a prophecy glory to
[1:01:48] god in
[1:01:49] 87 years later the prophecy is
[1:01:52] manifested
[1:01:55] and you you happen to be in the
[1:01:57] generation that saw it fulfilled
[1:02:00] amen if we if we can see six of seven
[1:02:03] things already fulfilled amen
[1:02:06] huh i want to tell you the sabbath is
[1:02:09] the worst one
[1:02:12] glory to god the sabbath the seventh one
[1:02:15] talks about destruction all over
[1:02:17] the usa come on somebody
[1:02:20] so if all the other six have been
[1:02:22] fulfilled we ought to get ready for that
[1:02:23] seventh one
[1:02:24] and i can tell you right now when that
[1:02:26] hits we better be ready to go
[1:02:28] i preached it a few weeks ago you got to
[1:02:30] be in the shuttle
[1:02:34] you can't be coming to the shuttle you
[1:02:37] got to be
[1:02:37] in the shuttle ready for the countdown
[1:02:42] oh hallelujah in in houston or
[1:02:46] or cape canaveral they saying t minus
[1:02:48] and t minus t
[1:02:49] minus ten t minus nine t minus eight
[1:02:53] t minus seven all the way down till they
[1:02:55] get the one when it hits zero it's
[1:02:57] it releases and and that thing takes off
[1:03:00] to go through the sky
[1:03:00] we're not doing any minuses it's plus
[1:03:04] because god does not subtract he adds
[1:03:07] god does not divide but he multiplies
[1:03:11] glory to god we watch them in ephesus we
[1:03:14] watch them through amen uh uh uh smyrna
[1:03:17] and pergamus and thigh tears scientists
[1:03:18] philadelphia
[1:03:19] but we are not leons
[1:03:24] praise god we are the pride
[1:03:27] amen we find ourselves inside the ship
[1:03:32] ready to go praise god when god is ready
[1:03:34] to call we ready to go
[1:03:36] all right look at this numbers 24 17.
[1:03:40] here's another one we see the lord jesus
[1:03:42] spoken of here in scripture
[1:03:43] go back and search the scriptures you'll
[1:03:46] see amen
[1:03:47] in them you think you have eternal life
[1:03:49] but the scripture is what
[1:03:50] testifies to me oh lord i i just
[1:03:53] this is i have to always go back to this
[1:03:56] the reason i believe this
[1:03:58] message is because it's in scripture
[1:04:02] that's why i believe it i'm not
[1:04:04] believing it just because of the signs
[1:04:06] wonders and miracles
[1:04:07] i believe it because i can see it in
[1:04:09] scripture
[1:04:11] i'm i'ma say it like this even if there
[1:04:14] was never another sign wonder miracle
[1:04:16] i still believe it why because i see it
[1:04:20] in scripture
[1:04:22] all right numbers 24 17 i shall see him
[1:04:26] but not now i shall behold him
[1:04:29] but not nigh there shall come a star out
[1:04:32] of jacob and a scepter
[1:04:34] shall rise out of israel and shall smite
[1:04:38] the corners of moab
[1:04:39] and destroy all the children of seth now
[1:04:42] you know that that step is capitalized
[1:04:45] it's speaking of a person that's coming
[1:04:47] and now back in the
[1:04:48] in uh in the days where they had the
[1:04:51] kings
[1:04:52] uh you all remember the story of esther
[1:04:54] esther could not
[1:04:55] approach the king unless the king
[1:04:58] amen put out his scepter oh
[1:05:02] hallelujah amen esther realized that if
[1:05:05] i go when the king does not give me a
[1:05:06] scepter
[1:05:07] i'm good as dead but uh but but mordeca
[1:05:11] i mean her uh her uncle mordecai began
[1:05:13] testing out
[1:05:14] esther amen i know you might be afraid
[1:05:16] but maybe
[1:05:18] amen it's a possibility that god
[1:05:22] brought you into this place oh
[1:05:25] hallelujah
[1:05:26] for such a time as this
[1:05:30] hey hallelujah church
[1:05:33] maybe this is an opportunity for you to
[1:05:35] start witnessing
[1:05:37] with everything that you know and
[1:05:39] everything that you've seen
[1:05:41] maybe this is an opportunity for you to
[1:05:43] witness about this message
[1:05:45] maybe god has given you an open open
[1:05:47] door to share this with somebody
[1:05:49] for such a time as this
[1:05:53] you know i i i was thinking to myself i
[1:05:56] said you know if uh
[1:05:57] somebody you know want to join a
[1:05:59] conversation with me
[1:06:01] about you know what has just happened in
[1:06:02] our country and
[1:06:04] and how exciting it must be for
[1:06:07] certain things i hope you can read
[1:06:10] between
[1:06:11] the lines how exciting it must be
[1:06:15] for certain things i began to think to
[1:06:18] myself you know i i think i should ask
[1:06:20] them say
[1:06:20] you believe the bible what about
[1:06:24] prophets do you realize that before this
[1:06:27] even happened there was
[1:06:28] you know there was a prophecy that was
[1:06:30] stated even 87 years ago
[1:06:32] seven things that were gonna happen
[1:06:33] before jesus returned
[1:06:35] oh glory to god see there's an open door
[1:06:39] glory to god there's an open door for
[1:06:41] you to share truth with somebody
[1:06:43] if you just open your mouth and do so
[1:06:45] can i ask you a ques can i just
[1:06:47] i'm not a question i'm gonna make a
[1:06:49] statement be spiritual
[1:06:52] don't be carnal be spiritual
[1:06:57] all right right so so the scepter had to
[1:07:01] be offered to esther in order for her to
[1:07:03] be able to approach the king
[1:07:04] and he had she not received the scepter
[1:07:07] she would have been good as dead
[1:07:08] now before we can approach god amen the
[1:07:11] scepter had to be offered which was
[1:07:14] christ when he died on the cross the
[1:07:17] scepter was being offered
[1:07:18] now we have an opportunity to go right
[1:07:20] into the presence of almighty god
[1:07:23] thank god that he was that scepter
[1:07:28] jesus was vindicated signs wonders
[1:07:31] miracles
[1:07:33] his birth was was spoken of in scripture
[1:07:36] his life was spoken of in scripture
[1:07:38] so many things this is why i told the
[1:07:40] leaders of that day just
[1:07:42] just search the scriptures if you you
[1:07:43] got a problem with me
[1:07:45] amen that's one thing but just search
[1:07:47] the scriptures because if i'm fulfilling
[1:07:49] what the scripture is saying i'm under
[1:07:51] fulfilled then you got to take that up
[1:07:52] with god
[1:07:54] amen hallelujah many people might have a
[1:07:56] problem with brother branham
[1:07:58] but if he fulfilled what the scripture
[1:08:00] said he was supposed to fulfill then you
[1:08:02] got to take that up with god
[1:08:04] amen all right now look at this i was
[1:08:07] just thinking on this jesus was
[1:08:09] vindicated
[1:08:10] and that word vindication means to clear
[1:08:13] of all
[1:08:13] suspicion all suspicion at his
[1:08:17] birth angels came to sing
[1:08:20] amen and provide a direction to the
[1:08:23] shepherds as to where they could find
[1:08:24] the christ
[1:08:25] and angels amen uh the angel scene was
[1:08:28] extra identifying
[1:08:30] that royalty had been born oh hallelujah
[1:08:33] because in those days when a king was
[1:08:35] born the people would sing
[1:08:38] but god didn't just have people singing
[1:08:40] god had
[1:08:41] angels singing identifying royalty
[1:08:44] had been born glory to god
[1:08:48] the three magi that came a couple years
[1:08:52] uh after jesus was on the earth they
[1:08:54] brought their gifts
[1:08:56] gold and frankincense and myrrh and each
[1:08:58] one of these gifts
[1:09:00] identified a uh uh uh something about
[1:09:03] the lord jesus
[1:09:04] amen the goal identified his deity
[1:09:07] amen the frankincense identified his
[1:09:10] service
[1:09:11] and the myrrh identified the anointing
[1:09:13] for death
[1:09:14] and what brother branham tells us that
[1:09:16] jesus was deity
[1:09:19] in service to die glory glory glory
[1:09:23] the works testified of him when he fed
[1:09:26] 5 000 that testified who he was
[1:09:30] what matter of man is this when he fed 4
[1:09:33] 000 that testified who he was glory to
[1:09:37] god
[1:09:37] amen when he turned the water into wine
[1:09:40] that testified who he was god didn't
[1:09:44] need nobody
[1:09:45] else to try to interpret the
[1:09:47] manifestation
[1:09:48] amen what's the interpretation
[1:09:51] amen glory to god a man amen
[1:09:55] all the doubt should have been settled
[1:09:57] when they experienced these things
[1:09:59] amen that that that all the suspicion
[1:10:02] should have been gone
[1:10:03] when the people experienced these things
[1:10:05] if i can just go a little ahead of
[1:10:07] myself
[1:10:08] your suspicion should be gone by now if
[1:10:11] the message is right
[1:10:12] or if the message is wrong hallelujah
[1:10:15] you shouldn't
[1:10:16] have no more suspicion you are living in
[1:10:20] vindicated truth
[1:10:26] hallelujah somebody i'm not i'm not talk
[1:10:28] about coming here to get
[1:10:30] head knowledge i can read quotes to you
[1:10:32] but i want to go beyond your head
[1:10:34] knowledge
[1:10:35] this ought to touch something inside
[1:10:37] your soul
[1:10:38] cause you don't want to live right cause
[1:10:41] you want to walk right and talk right
[1:10:43] praise god get yourself back on the word
[1:10:46] of god
[1:10:48] amen oh hallelujah forgive me
[1:10:52] for being so animated
[1:10:55] how can i how many uh how can i not be
[1:10:58] animated at a time like this
[1:11:02] how can i not brother brandon you say
[1:11:05] you see you see a
[1:11:06] a a a a person headed towards the false
[1:11:10] right you standing on the bank and you
[1:11:12] see him in a wrath out there
[1:11:14] on on on on life's ocean just headed
[1:11:17] towards a falls
[1:11:18] they can't see in front of them but you
[1:11:21] see it coming
[1:11:21] he said he said now what kind of friend
[1:11:23] would you be if you standing up on the
[1:11:26] on the shore saying uh get out the boat
[1:11:29] get out the boat they came what what get
[1:11:31] out of the boat i told them to get out
[1:11:33] of the boat

[1:11:35] really concerned you got
[1:11:36] get out the boat
[1:11:42] get out the boat you're gonna yell and
[1:11:45] scream you're gonna get animated
[1:11:48] you the reason you get animated is
[1:11:50] because you care
[1:11:59] they say the system just go crazy when i
[1:12:01] preach
[1:12:03] it it'd be it'd be like this and then
[1:12:05] they say i mean they have to buy
[1:12:06] special equipment for me in order to try
[1:12:08] to uh
[1:12:09] get to get it to harmonize because i
[1:12:12] start yelling and screaming and things
[1:12:13] just start peeking like crazy
[1:12:15] that's just i'm animated amen god made
[1:12:18] me that way
[1:12:19] i mean the reason you're here glory to
[1:12:22] god is because we're we're
[1:12:24] you you've seen the vindicated truth and
[1:12:27] it's just something how
[1:12:28] we kind of remember what the prophet
[1:12:30] said
[1:12:31] i'ma tell you one of these days it's
[1:12:34] gonna be too late to remember
[1:12:37] y'all didn't get it it's going to be too
[1:12:40] late to remember
[1:12:41] why not why not live under expectation
[1:12:44] now
[1:12:45] rather than waiting because one day
[1:12:47] you're going to call and they're not
[1:12:48] going to be no answer
[1:12:50] one day you're gonna come trying to get
[1:12:52] into the church and we can't we can't
[1:12:53] open it up
[1:12:55] so you better take advantage of the
[1:12:56] moments that you have now
[1:12:58] all right church go ready god amen amen
[1:13:02] when when there's a new article just
[1:13:05] went out
[1:13:06] sharks sharks
[1:13:09] near los angeles sharks
[1:13:13] right amen right and we already know
[1:13:16] what a prophet said
[1:13:18] he said he said los angeles going
[1:13:20] underneath the water yes
[1:13:22] hallelujah you thank you cena pandemic
[1:13:26] amen praise the lord
[1:13:36] god is a master chess
[1:13:39] chess man all right
[1:13:43] and chess you just don't just make moves
[1:13:46] you better know what it's got to be
[1:13:47] calculated
[1:13:49] there's an objective here so when i put
[1:13:52] this here
[1:13:53] something can really happen
[1:13:57] right i i sir actually what he has to do
[1:14:00] i got to put a certain president in
[1:14:02] office
[1:14:04] he has to have a certain disposition
[1:14:09] because his disposition will make the
[1:14:12] people
[1:14:14] put themselves in another condition
[1:14:23] they're gonna get so mad they're gonna
[1:14:26] get so
[1:14:26] upset that they're gonna go to the polls
[1:14:30] and make my prophecy come to pass
[1:14:32] [Applause]
[1:14:36] amen and and then call it that i'm
[1:14:39] i'm voting for the lesser yeah
[1:14:43] actually i ain't voting for evil
[1:14:46] [Applause]
[1:14:48] that's right but i want to take the
[1:14:50] lesser to i ain't taking
[1:14:54] evil
[1:14:57] but this is our mindset right
[1:15:00] i got the lesser two evils then you know
[1:15:02] you get a little
[1:15:03] happy
[1:15:06] because of certain things if you can
[1:15:08] read between the lies
[1:15:14] and don't realize you just fulfill
[1:15:16] scripture amen just
[1:15:18] walk right into a prophecy and like i
[1:15:20] say you shouldn't have no more questions
[1:15:22] about this message
[1:15:24] amen with your eyes seeing it first hand
[1:15:30] and some people hand welcomed it
[1:15:35] i'm keep preaching jesus was vindicated
[1:15:40] when he fed five thousand and four
[1:15:42] thousand when he turned water into wine
[1:15:44] all these manifestations were
[1:15:46] vindications of who he was
[1:15:48] right when he uh when he when the sick
[1:15:50] were healed amen
[1:15:52] by a word glory to god i i i i always
[1:15:56] love the story of the
[1:15:58] uh the centurion amen that sent
[1:16:01] uh a sermon he said i'm not even worthy
[1:16:04] that this man should
[1:16:06] come to my house now here's a centurion
[1:16:08] a
[1:16:09] a leader in a man in the roman army
[1:16:12] but yet he has enough respect he has
[1:16:15] enough
[1:16:16] revelation he has enough understanding
[1:16:18] that
[1:16:19] if i want something to change with my
[1:16:21] servant
[1:16:22] i don't tried the doctors and they can't
[1:16:24] do them no good they actually sent him
[1:16:26] home to die
[1:16:28] but i love this man so much that i don't
[1:16:30] want to see him die
[1:16:32] like that he said could you please go to
[1:16:35] jesus
[1:16:36] he's saying now i'm not worthy to go
[1:16:38] into his presence but if you could
[1:16:40] go on my behalf and and just talk to him
[1:16:43] and see if he would come and heal
[1:16:44] the servant so the man didn't know
[1:16:46] whether jesus would accept this
[1:16:48] amen invitation or not but i want you to
[1:16:51] know jesus goes wherever
[1:16:53] he is invited
[1:16:56] hallelujah somebody that's glory to god
[1:16:59] he goes wherever
[1:17:00] he's invited glory to god he went to
[1:17:04] simon's house when he was invited
[1:17:06] amen he came to the centurion's house
[1:17:09] when he was invited he will come to your
[1:17:12] house
[1:17:14] if you'll invite them
[1:17:18] here jesus gets the request from these
[1:17:21] the the the servants um uh uh uh
[1:17:25] you know his uh his servant i mean it's
[1:17:26] this leader's servants he gets the
[1:17:28] request and he says you know what i'll
[1:17:30] come and i'll heal him
[1:17:31] so as they as this man sees this great
[1:17:34] crowd approaching the house
[1:17:35] he knew it must have been jesus they
[1:17:37] must have talked him into coming to
[1:17:39] to to do something about the situation
[1:17:41] and the man said
[1:17:42] man got up out of his house and i i i'm
[1:17:45] not worthy that he'd come and say
[1:17:46] let me just stop him before he get here
[1:17:49] and he said jesus
[1:17:50] you know uh i'm a man of authority and i
[1:17:53] tell this one to come
[1:17:55] and he comes i tell this one to go
[1:17:58] and he goes not a man could say that
[1:18:00] because he had just
[1:18:02] sent people to jesus
[1:18:05] he told them to go and they went he said
[1:18:08] i tell something to come
[1:18:10] and they come i tell this one to go and
[1:18:12] they go i tell this will do that do this
[1:18:14] and they do it he said jesus the same
[1:18:17] way i have that authority
[1:18:18] you have authority over sickness and and
[1:18:20] i'm not worthy that you come underneath
[1:18:22] my roof but
[1:18:23] if you could just speak the words
[1:18:28] if you could just speak the word my
[1:18:30] servant will be made whole
[1:18:33] jesus marveled at this he said what kind
[1:18:35] of faith this
[1:18:36] kind of faith i'm looking for in israel
[1:18:39] but i'm finding this kind of faith
[1:18:41] amongst gentiles
[1:18:43] say man go find it the exact way that
[1:18:46] you just requested it
[1:18:48] jesus never went to the man's house just
[1:18:50] spoke the word
[1:18:51] and the servant was made whole right
[1:18:54] then
[1:18:55] god i'm looking for some people to be
[1:18:56] made whole
[1:18:59] and i know it's going to take the word
[1:19:00] to make them whole
[1:19:03] see he was vindicated in that man's eyes
[1:19:07] he was vindicated the dead were raised
[1:19:10] when lazarus got about the grave that
[1:19:12] that should have vindicated who jesus
[1:19:14] was
[1:19:14] it should have settled all the questions
[1:19:17] glory to god it should it should have
[1:19:19] cleared all the suspicion amen when the
[1:19:22] when the death had their hearing
[1:19:24] restored
[1:19:25] amen when blinded eyes were open it
[1:19:28] should have cleared
[1:19:29] all suspicion i remember amen the the
[1:19:33] the one man that was blind from birth
[1:19:36] hallelujah amen and and uh uh
[1:19:39] you know he's blind and jesus comes by

[1:22:08] scriptures y'all should have known this
[1:22:10] man was coming
[1:22:10] didn't the bible say these things was
[1:22:12] supposed to happen and they said
[1:22:14] now who are you to teach us
[1:22:19] hallelujah see the the manifestations
[1:22:23] were the vindication of who christ was
[1:22:27] the manifestations in his life the
[1:22:29] people that were healed
[1:22:30] the the the uh the the deaf hearing the
[1:22:33] blind seeing the feeling of fact all
[1:22:35] these miracles they were the manifest
[1:22:36] they were
[1:22:37] vindicating who christ was i want to go
[1:22:40] a little further
[1:22:41] when we look at uh the river jordan
[1:22:44] where
[1:22:45] john saw the spirit descend from heaven
[1:22:47] and abide on jesus
[1:22:48] and in john's mind this was
[1:22:52] the vindication amen of who christ was
[1:22:55] he said there's one standing amongst you
[1:22:57] amen whose shoes i'm not even worthy to
[1:23:00] lose when john saw the spirit come and
[1:23:02] abide
[1:23:04] he said this has got to be the one this
[1:23:06] is the one this is the one this is the
[1:23:07] one
[1:23:08] but now let's just pick him up i i told
[1:23:10] you all this on last week
[1:23:13] oh my good god almighty i want to pick
[1:23:16] him up
[1:23:17] in uh matthew 11.
[1:23:21] let's pick up john glory to god
[1:23:25] i just mentioned it amen uh last week
[1:23:28] but i want to read it today
[1:23:30] if we can now john it was vindicated to
[1:23:33] him
[1:23:34] and and and i said this said this amen
[1:23:37] last week and i'mma say it again today
[1:23:39] well what what caused john's eagle eye
[1:23:42] to get
[1:23:43] filmed over because that's what brother
[1:23:44] branham says eagle eye got filmed over
[1:23:47] right he was i mean it was clear
[1:23:50] the one that you see the spirit rested
[1:23:53] on and abide
[1:23:55] that's the one now look god don't have
[1:23:58] to vindicate
[1:23:59] no more to john vindicated it once i
[1:24:02] told you who he was
[1:24:05] right you testified of it john now now
[1:24:07] what caused john's eagle eye
[1:24:10] to get filmed over
[1:24:13] the reason he got filmed over is because
[1:24:15] of the trials of his
[1:24:17] own life i i need you to see it
[1:24:21] the reason many of us are in the
[1:24:23] conditions that we're in
[1:24:24] is how we approach the trial

[1:24:35] come on you might as well be like david
[1:24:40] don't run from goliath but run to
[1:24:43] goliath

[1:29:45] gonna get to matthew 11.
[1:29:47] some of us really have a problem amen
[1:29:49] getting into that
[1:29:50] that mindset it's hard
[1:29:53] it's hard to get yourself in that
[1:29:55] mindset of thanksgiving
[1:29:57] glory to god hey man let me try to get
[1:30:00] this devil out of here
[1:30:03] see you the devil show you you did this
[1:30:08] and the devil showed you you did that
[1:30:10] you made this mistake
[1:30:13] you made that mistake and as you start
[1:30:15] thinking like that it's hard for you to
[1:30:18] to get up in the spirit
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:21] amen it's hard for you to get up
[1:30:26] amen and just just kind of try to say
[1:30:28] lord i want to just
[1:30:29] enter with thanksgiving because you come
[1:30:32] to church
[1:30:32] bombarded in your mind your mind just
[1:30:35] thinking about all these mistakes that
[1:30:37] you

[1:30:43] devil still couldn't keep you from the
[1:30:46] truth
[1:30:49] [Applause]
[1:30:51] with all those mistakes that you made he
[1:30:53] can stop you from coming to the message
[1:30:55] of the hour
[1:30:57] [Music]
[1:30:59] brother predestination will override
[1:31:02] every mistake
[1:31:03] [Applause]
[1:31:07] and when you know that you are a seed of
[1:31:09] god
[1:31:12] god is casting every mistake into the
[1:31:14] sea of forgetfulness
[1:31:18] you gotta understand your position by
[1:31:20] the blood
[1:31:22] the blood cleanses you now the blood
[1:31:24] don't want you going out doing the same
[1:31:25] old thing all over again
[1:31:27] the blood wants you to repent make
[1:31:30] things right
[1:31:31] and then move on from there be
[1:31:34] really sorry about what you did
[1:31:38] but you you approach god right he won't
[1:31:40] leave you there and you're in
[1:31:42] that condition so he'll give you

[1:34:59] now uh as i you know i i shared this
[1:35:03] about john
[1:35:05] and when i won't have time to read this
[1:35:07] quote but i'm gonna just tell you what
[1:35:08] the prophet said
[1:35:09] he said uh when jesus actually came to
[1:35:12] john to be baptized
[1:35:14] of him at jordan river jesus said
[1:35:17] that that i mean the prophet said there
[1:35:19] was the two most important people on the
[1:35:21] earth
[1:35:25] the two most important people on the
[1:35:27] earth was
[1:35:28] jesus himself god himself in the body of
[1:35:31] of jesus
[1:35:33] amen standing there being baptized by
[1:35:35] his
[1:35:36] prophet greater
[1:35:39] than the high priest greater than
[1:35:43] the the leader of the sadducees and
[1:35:45] pharisees or whoever they might be
[1:35:47] greater than the king amen here was the
[1:35:50] king of kings standing there
[1:35:52] identifying himself with the prophet now
[1:35:55] when jesus
[1:35:56] comes to john it actually vindicates
[1:35:59] john's ministry
[1:36:03] hallelujah and when john sees his spirit
[1:36:06] descend
[1:36:06] and abide on jesus to john
[1:36:10] jesus ministry was vindicated but the
[1:36:13] problem is
[1:36:14] when we picked this up in matthew 11 is
[1:36:16] that john went through trials
[1:36:18] after that moment can i tell you
[1:36:20] something
[1:36:21] amen we come and have a good service

[1:37:07] to understand why john is

[1:43:17] what i want to do
[1:43:18] and you're on your way to hell
[1:43:21] amen you're on your way to hell if you
[1:43:24] died
[1:43:25] right now in hell you lift up your eyes

[1:43:38] can't
[1:43:39] i i can lead you to the water but i
[1:43:40] can't make you drink
[1:43:42] amen right but here you know this lady
[1:43:46] asked for the head of john the baptist
[1:43:47] said go go in there and tell tell
[1:43:49] tell them tell your daddy we want the
[1:43:50] head of john the baptist in a
[1:43:52] in a play after all is preaching god
[1:43:55] vindicated his ministry
[1:43:56] but you know what the reason that john
[1:43:59] had to go through that john had already
[1:44:00] said
[1:44:01] he made a statement he says i got to
[1:44:03] decrease
[1:44:04] right so that he can increase
[1:44:07] and god took him off the earth quickly
[1:44:10] went to went to prison over preaching
[1:44:17] amen all right
[1:44:20] so while john's in prison you get a
[1:44:22] little discouraged now let's pick them
[1:44:23] up in in
[1:44:24] and and uh matthew 11. i'm trying
[1:44:29] to just uh leave us here to add a little
[1:44:31] something here if i can uh
[1:44:35] says and it came to pass when jesus had
[1:44:39] made the end of commanding his twelve
[1:44:40] disciples he departed thence to teach
[1:44:43] and to preach in their cities now when
[1:44:46] john had heard in the prison
[1:44:48] the works of christ he sent two of his
[1:44:50] disciples so these fellows are visiting
[1:44:52] john in prison and
[1:44:54] and um and and and john is you know
[1:44:56] saying now i'm hearing about
[1:44:58] i'm hearing about what's going on with
[1:44:59] jesus says but uh but i want you to go
[1:45:02] and and talk to him from me now here um
[1:45:05] uh uh he gives him some instruction here
[1:45:08] in verse 3 says
[1:45:09] and said unto him uh art thou he
[1:45:12] that should come or do we look for
[1:45:14] another
[1:45:16] now again remember this john was john
[1:45:18] was told by god himself
[1:45:19] the one that you see the spirit abide on
[1:45:22] that's him
[1:45:23] so he said a prophet
[1:45:26] came to this point in his ministry that
[1:45:28] he's wondering
[1:45:30] i can i'll even put this away hey man
[1:45:32] you can go through some trials you start
[1:45:34] wondering about your calling
[1:45:37] you start wondering about it was i
[1:45:39] really called it this
[1:45:41] was did god make a mistake by letting me
[1:45:43] hear this message you start you start
[1:45:45] really wondering about
[1:45:46] you know your position am i really
[1:45:50] predestinated
[1:45:51] right your trial makes you feel that way
[1:45:55] but the devil is still a liar
[1:45:58] so so here john has this because of the
[1:46:01] trial he's in prison
[1:46:02] are you the one or should we be looking
[1:46:03] for another somebody looking for another
[1:46:05] so so here he says uh
[1:46:09] uh jesus answered and sent it to them go
[1:46:12] and show john again those things which
[1:46:14] you do
[1:46:14] here and see now what happened brother
[1:46:16] branham gives us some clear
[1:46:17] understanding here
[1:46:19] it says that these disciples came to the
[1:46:21] service where jesus was preaching and
[1:46:22] jesus said now just sit
[1:46:24] sit down and and just go through the
[1:46:27] service and at the end of the service i
[1:46:28] answer your question
[1:46:30] so here we're at the end of the service
[1:46:31] and and now and jesus say uh
[1:46:34] uh jesus answered and said unto them go
[1:46:36] and show john
[1:46:38] again those things which you do hear and
[1:46:40] see
[1:46:41] the blind received their sight
[1:46:44] and the lame walk i mean they had a
[1:46:47] mighty outpouring
[1:46:49] oh lord i forgot that i
[1:46:52] i said this early and i and it just
[1:46:54] slipped my mind but the lord just
[1:46:55] brought it back
[1:46:56] i told you we elevated we elevated
[1:47:00] right we went from just thanksgiving
[1:47:03] amen and then praise but wednesday night
[1:47:05] we elevated
[1:47:06] and brother branham told us that we can
[1:47:07] go into the pentecost of chicago
[1:47:12] so what you're feeling here this morning
[1:47:15] is a little bit
[1:47:16] we ain't even tap the surface

[1:47:26] we go to pentecost of chicago
[1:47:28] somebody gonna prophesy all right
[1:47:31] and somebody else gonna interpret and if
[1:47:34] your life
[1:47:35] ain't right
[1:47:40] it may come out so we're gonna go to a
[1:47:43] church
[1:47:44] where the prophets say i love to be in a
[1:47:47] church
[1:47:49] where sin can't hide
[1:47:52] all right so i'm gonna tell you a way
[1:47:55] that you get your
[1:47:56] you get your your stuff straight confess
[1:48:00] that way you don't have to walk in here
[1:48:01] to the pentecostal shekinah and somebody
[1:48:04] beat them reveal what they done saw
[1:48:08] right just confess actually that's how
[1:48:12] you get victory over the devil
[1:48:14] by confessing they have an old
[1:48:18] saying in old days shame the devil
[1:48:21] confess all right all right
[1:48:25] confess your faults one to another and
[1:48:27] then do what
[1:48:28] talk about them talk about them put it
[1:48:30] on instagram
[1:48:33] that ain't what the bible say confess
[1:48:35] your faults one to another and pray one
[1:48:37] for the other
[1:48:38] amen you better find somebody to know
[1:48:41] the word of god
[1:48:43] all right amen all right so i'm at verse
[1:48:46] five
[1:48:46] the blind see that sight the lame walk
[1:48:49] the lepers are cleansed
[1:48:50] and the death here the dead are raised
[1:48:52] up the poor
[1:48:53] have the gospel preached to them and
[1:48:56] this is a bliss this is wonderful right
[1:48:58] here
[1:48:58] blessed is he whosoever shall not be
[1:49:02] offended in me
[1:49:06] now you know it because it's very easy
[1:49:08] to um
[1:49:09] especially you know you have to dress a
[1:49:11] certain way with this walk
[1:49:12] you gotta look a certain way but don't
[1:49:14] don't be offended in christ
[1:49:15] and what he's calling you to do all
[1:49:17] right blessed is he
[1:49:19] that's not offended in me
[1:49:22] let's go on and as they departed when
[1:49:28] jesus waited till these disciples left
[1:49:29] john's disciples left
[1:49:30] as they departed jesus began to say
[1:49:34] unto the multitudes now i want you to
[1:49:35] understand when john heard the words of
[1:49:37] jesus
[1:49:39] that the lame walk the blind see the
[1:49:41] deaf here
[1:49:42] his question was answered what answered
[1:49:45] the question
[1:49:46] was the manifestation
[1:49:49] i hope you got that what answered the
[1:49:51] question
[1:49:52] was the manifestation and what should be
[1:49:55] answering questions
[1:49:56] today is the manifestation
[1:49:59] i told you we read a newspaper 87
[1:50:03] years ago that told us what we just saw
[1:50:06] this week
[1:50:07] was going to come to pass it was already
[1:50:09] headlines
[1:50:12] 87 years ago and the prophet even said
[1:50:16] i'm trying to read it for he even said
[1:50:17] he said i might not live to see it but
[1:50:19] you young people
[1:50:23] and many of them are seeing it saw it
[1:50:25] with their own eyes
[1:50:27] praise god i told you look look look
[1:50:31] look god is a a professional chess
[1:50:34] player
[1:50:35] he moved pieces he had there was a
[1:50:38] president that had to come before this
[1:50:42] it had to happen like that everybody i
[1:50:44] mean the whole
[1:50:45] world
[1:50:49] may i mean a guy that can just get
[1:50:51] underneath everybody's
[1:50:53] feet god designed the man like that
[1:50:57] i'ma say it again god designed
[1:51:00] the man like that amen
[1:51:04] got
[1:51:11] it's a shame before god we christians
[1:51:14] get out like that
[1:51:16] christians are all over social media
[1:51:18] fighting each
[1:51:26] it just just keeps propagating
[1:51:29] people not even looking at the scripture
[1:51:31] no more not even looking at the quotes
[1:51:33] just just
[1:51:34] propagating this stuff hate and all kind
[1:51:36] of stuff rising up
[1:51:38] right where this come christians
[1:51:45] i'ma tell you something when when when
[1:51:47] the pressure on
[1:51:49] that's when you really know who the
[1:51:50] people are
[1:51:54] someone's gonna need to learn i mean
[1:51:56] really learn how to pass right by
[1:51:58] you have to see things and not say
[1:52:00] things
[1:52:05] i'm gonna tell you you're gonna have to
[1:52:06] get control of your spirit
[1:52:08] [Music]
[1:52:10] amen holy ghost don't want you saying
[1:52:12] all that that's right i i there were so
[1:52:14] many times
[1:52:15] i hear different people say certain
[1:52:16] things and i just start
[1:52:22] yeah but i'm gonna tell you how some of
[1:52:24] y'all do y'all get the same spot
[1:52:25] i'm not but you come right back and find
[1:52:29] some other way to get it get your
[1:52:31] message across
[1:52:33] so you really didn't overcome you failed
[1:52:35] the test
[1:52:39] all right church all right but but you
[1:52:42] know
[1:52:42] it was it's strategic it's we looking at
[1:52:46] it from a totally different lens
[1:52:47] yeah and so so god has to use these
[1:52:50] pieces to get the whole world an
[1:52:51] uproar i mean even to the to not even
[1:52:54] conceding
[1:52:55] that got everybody you won't even
[1:52:59] he has a certain spirit of a certain
[1:53:01] anointing
[1:53:04] that anointing got to be there to get
[1:53:05] everybody that's driven right towards
[1:53:07] this other thing
[1:53:08] and can't y'all see this handwriting all
[1:53:10] over the wall
[1:53:13] before this announcement the pope come
[1:53:15] out and said something
[1:53:19] about same-sex marriages he was for it
[1:53:21] the
[1:53:22] the pope
[1:53:25] and what do we end up with a party that
[1:53:29] supports it
[1:53:30] with a catholic president
[1:53:35] and a woman so the prophecy double
[1:53:39] fulfilled pretty much
[1:53:44] [Applause]

[1:53:50] what

[1:54:06] right hey man we're citizens of another
[1:54:08] kingdom

[1:54:11] like it that's right
[1:54:12] amen amen all right
[1:54:16] i i got a few more minutes i'm trying to
[1:54:17] get to just something here where where
[1:54:20] am i i don't even know what verse i'm on
[1:54:25] okay thank you okay and as they departed
[1:54:29] jesus began to say unto the multitudes
[1:54:31] concerning
[1:54:32] he's preaching john's this is his eulogy
[1:54:37] so what when you out into the wilderness
[1:54:41] to see a reed shaking with the wind
[1:54:44] but what went you out for to see a man
[1:54:46] clothed in soft raiment behold they that
[1:54:48] wear soft raiment are in king's houses
[1:54:52] but what went you out for to see what
[1:54:54] you came to church for to see
[1:54:58] notice what jesus said a prophet y'all
[1:55:00] went to see a prophet
[1:55:02] yeah i say unto you and more than a
[1:55:06] prophet
[1:55:08] even though john gary loses his head
[1:55:11] brother jesus said he's more than a
[1:55:12] prophet this
[1:55:13] is vindicating john's ministry
[1:55:17] the words of jesus himself vindicates
[1:55:20] john's ministry hallelujah
[1:55:24] glory to god um
[1:55:27] and it says for this is he of whom it is
[1:55:30] written
[1:55:31] behold i send my messenger before the
[1:55:34] before thy face
[1:55:35] which shall prepare the way before thee
[1:55:38] jesus put them even back in scripture
[1:55:41] right verily i say unto you among them
[1:55:44] that are born of women
[1:55:46] there have not risen greater than john
[1:55:48] the baptist notwithstanding he that is
[1:55:50] least in the kingdom of heaven
[1:55:52] is greater than he now here the
[1:55:54] disciples
[1:55:55] are standing here listening to jesus
[1:55:58] talk about john the baptist
[1:56:00] but on mount transfiguration
[1:56:04] after this tremendous experience and
[1:56:06] peter wants to build three temples and
[1:56:08] and all this other stuff and say no no
[1:56:09] no
[1:56:10] this my beloved son hear ye him say then
[1:56:13] peter asks questions now
[1:56:14] then the scribes say that elias was
[1:56:17] afraid was for was to come first before
[1:56:19] this happened say yeah
[1:56:20] and i and i said to you elias shall come
[1:56:24] and restore all things but i also say
[1:56:27] elias has come and they've done unto him
[1:56:30] exactly what was written
[1:56:33] and do you realize this after the second
[1:56:35] time now they heard it here in matthew
[1:56:36] 11.
[1:56:37] but it was only then it finally sunk in
[1:56:41] oh he talking about john the baptist
[1:56:44] john was already dead before they
[1:56:46] realized who he was
[1:56:50] some people didn't realize yeah brother
[1:56:52] branham's come and gone
[1:56:54] before they realize who he is
[1:56:57] now you know jesus said this verily i
[1:57:00] say unto you among them that are born
[1:57:01] a woman they have not been greater than
[1:57:05] john the baptist
[1:57:06] and i was standing he that is uh least
[1:57:09] in the kingdom of heaven is greater than
[1:57:10] he
[1:57:11] i got to read this this quote out of
[1:57:13] influence
[1:57:14] should be on the back of the page there
[1:57:16] the first quote out of influence
[1:57:19] i just want us to try to get this and
[1:57:22] and then i'll
[1:57:23] i'll try to bring us bring it home a
[1:57:25] little bit today
[1:57:26] this says
[1:57:31] oh my god says what did john the baptist
[1:57:35] do
[1:57:36] the man that jesus said there was never
[1:57:38] a man born of woman like him
[1:57:41] or could compare with him
[1:57:45] until that time
[1:57:48] hmm i would love to just underline that
[1:57:53] yes yes jesus said there was never a man
[1:57:56] like john the baptist but brother
[1:57:58] branham just added a little something
[1:57:59] there
[1:58:00] until that time
[1:58:04] why could he say that because john the
[1:58:06] baptist's ministry
[1:58:08] was to introduce his first coming that's
[1:58:11] why jesus said that about john the
[1:58:12] baptist
[1:58:13] but there's another ministry coming that
[1:58:16] will introduce his
[1:58:17] second coming and that ministry be just
[1:58:20] as
[1:58:20] important
[1:58:26] there was a never a man born a woman
[1:58:28] like him or could compare with him until
[1:58:30] that time
[1:58:31] that great prophet ordained of god
[1:58:32] before the foundation world spoke
[1:58:34] of 1207 years before he ever come on or
[1:58:38] 712 years rather
[1:58:39] before he ever come on earth by the
[1:58:40] prophet isaiah here
[1:58:43] said what did he do when he seen a man
[1:58:46] come walking down
[1:58:47] out of the audience and looked up above
[1:58:49] and saw that fire coming down from
[1:58:51] heaven in the form of a dove he cried
[1:58:52] out i had
[1:58:53] i have need to be baptized of thee
[1:58:56] i must decrease he must increase god
[1:58:58] can't have
[1:59:00] two on the earth at the same time only
[1:59:02] one has the message you know
[1:59:04] i must decrease he is the messenger i've
[1:59:07] been
[1:59:07] up to to this time now he takes my place
[1:59:11] as elisha when elijah went up and throw
[1:59:14] back his robe to elijah elisha his
[1:59:17] ministry was finished
[1:59:18] elisha must take up where he left off he
[1:59:21] must increase
[1:59:22] i must decrease john the baptist i want
[1:59:25] to say something there
[1:59:27] and uh just line up the message the
[1:59:30] quote spoken words original seed

[1:59:44] notice he said uh
[1:59:46] as uh elijah went off the scene elisha
[1:59:49] had to take his place
[1:59:50] i want to just just drop this in elijah
[1:59:55] had to deal with jezebel and ahab
[2:00:01] but elisha had to deal with
[2:00:05] their daughter athalia
[2:00:08] and athelia actually became king
[2:00:13] well you can't be a king as a woman but
[2:00:16] she took over the authority of the
[2:00:18] kingdom
[2:00:18] of failure and it was elijah underneath
[2:00:21] elijah's day
[2:00:22] that they had to deal with that
[2:00:25] types us
[2:00:40] let's just read from spoken word's
[2:00:42] original seed i'm just i'm just dropping
[2:00:44] these things out and
[2:00:45] you know and and maybe enough for y'all
[2:00:47] to have some dentists dinnertime
[2:00:48] conversation
[2:00:52] smoke wars of regency this is where
[2:00:54] we're getting our thought vindicated
[2:00:55] truths from uh we're still in that same
[2:00:58] journey of uh speaking i mean of
[2:01:01] of stepping to the vision we we have
[2:01:03] just stepped into one
[2:01:04] we just stepped into one right we got
[2:01:06] another one that we're in right now
[2:01:08] uh but here uh this this this the angel
[2:01:10] told the prophet pick up his pen and
[2:01:12] write and
[2:01:12] this was a portion of what he wrote says
[2:01:14] the messenger of malachi 4
[2:01:16] will appear at god's appointed time we
[2:01:19] are all looking for him
[2:01:21] we believe he will come now here brother
[2:01:23] bran is pick picking up his pen and
[2:01:24] writing
[2:01:25] and he's reading this to the people
[2:01:28] realizing that he
[2:01:29] is the one fulfilling it right my god
[2:01:33] fulfilling this so
[2:01:34] say the the messenger malachi 4 will
[2:01:36] appear at god's appointed time
[2:01:37] we are looking for him we believe he
[2:01:39] will come that is according to his word
[2:01:42] it will be at the end time which it is
[2:01:45] time
[2:01:45] now for to see it he will be
[2:01:49] correctly dedicated to the word as
[2:01:52] they have always been indicated by god's
[2:01:55] word
[2:01:55] and a vindicated right the message is
[2:01:59] going to be indicated in the word
[2:02:01] and then vindicated on top of that and
[2:02:04] when he's vindicated that should settle
[2:02:06] all questions
[2:02:11] if i were you i was if it's somebody
[2:02:14] that walked away from the message and
[2:02:16] still got a question
[2:02:18] just pull up the quote
[2:02:21] on what brother branham prophesied in
[2:02:22] 1933 and just tell me has it been
[2:02:25] fulfilled or not
[2:02:27] right you don't have to argue when
[2:02:29] things are vindicated and
[2:02:32] what i'm saying when god vindicates it
[2:02:34] no arguments
[2:02:35] no explaining nothing no here it is
[2:02:38] right here
[2:02:39] glory to god look at this
[2:02:43] god will vindicate what he preaches to
[2:02:45] be the truth
[2:02:47] as he did elijah for it is
[2:02:50] elijah coming how did god vindicate
[2:02:53] elijah when he called him to the
[2:02:54] mountain
[2:02:55] amen uh uh uh uh it says the god that
[2:02:58] answers by fire
[2:03:00] let him be god when when god answered by
[2:03:02] fire he vindicated elijah
[2:03:05] right look at this he says uh god would
[2:03:08] vindicate what he preaches to be truth
[2:03:09] as he did elijah
[2:03:10] for it is elijah coming making ready for
[2:03:14] the mount zion rapture jesus said in the
[2:03:17] last days it would be
[2:03:19] like lost time look at these statements
[2:03:22] jesus said the last days it'll be like
[2:03:24] last time what happened in lot's time
[2:03:28] homosexuality was out of control
[2:03:32] right out of control and and then first
[2:03:34] they said is that that's
[2:03:36] that's hate speech i was looking at some
[2:03:37] of these news things on the internet and
[2:03:39] they
[2:03:40] they said we want to know what's going
[2:03:41] to happen with christianity what you
[2:03:43] mean
[2:03:44] what's going to happen with christianity
[2:03:48] let's see that means there's going to be
[2:03:50] a boycott there's going to be an attack
[2:03:54] and we're going to find out where you
[2:03:55] really stand
[2:03:57] and won't that be something the very
[2:04:00] person that people put in the office
[2:04:03] comes against your very beliefs
[2:04:08] won't that be something all right
[2:04:11] all right um here
[2:04:15] it says uh uh in the last days it would
[2:04:18] be like
[2:04:19] lots time uh the pope not our pope but
[2:04:22] they pope
[2:04:22] just said he was okay with it same-sex
[2:04:25] marriages and
[2:04:25] and now we got a party that's also okay
[2:04:27] with it hey man they equate
[2:04:30] uh being a certain skin color to uh the
[2:04:33] same as being
[2:04:35] uh gay no no no
[2:04:38] and and the holy spirit told me a man
[2:04:41] being a certain skin color
[2:04:42] is not sin amen
[2:04:48] a certain color skin is not seen
[2:04:54] amen i i i i was reading this morning in
[2:04:57] the book of jeremiah
[2:04:59] jeremiah said can a leopard change his
[2:05:01] spots
[2:05:03] and he said something else
[2:05:08] jeremiah said can an ethiopian change
[2:05:11] his skin
[2:05:16] but just because ethiopia is born a
[2:05:18] certain color it's not sin
[2:05:21] amen amen all right
[2:05:27] his preaching will be with the spirit
[2:05:30] and strength line of god's word
[2:05:32] because so much has been called god's
[2:05:36] truth
[2:05:37] many will will misunderstand this true
[2:05:39] messenger
[2:05:40] i god wrote here p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y
[2:05:45] prophecy because because so much has
[2:05:49] been called god's truth by
[2:05:50] fakers many true ministers will
[2:05:55] misunderstand that messenger
[2:05:58] see but when god comes to vindicate it
[2:06:01] then it clears up all suspicion
[2:06:04] so we have a prophecy that i thought
[2:06:07] would be very appropriate to end on
[2:06:09] today
[2:06:12] the prophet preaches a message from that
[2:06:14] time
[2:06:17] he gives us a prophecy
[2:06:22] he says i won't have time in this
[2:06:24] meeting to tell
[2:06:25] you in 1933
[2:06:30] this is a woman's nation
[2:06:34] did i write this down 60
[2:06:37] uh it might be on the back of the page
[2:06:40] uh
[2:06:42] says uh uh this is a woman's nation
[2:06:45] it's the number 13.
[2:06:49] it appears in the 13th chapter
[2:06:52] of revelation 13 stars so when we start
[2:06:57] we got our first flag it was the flag
[2:06:59] was
[2:07:00] uh first designed by a woman right and
[2:07:03] and that woman put 13 stars and 13
[2:07:06] stripes on the flag
[2:07:07] the one that we see just flapping and
[2:07:08] everybody get so much pride and joy and
[2:07:11] you ought to
[2:07:12] y'all thank god for the country you live
[2:07:14] in amen i i
[2:07:15] sometimes i see that flag like man
[2:07:16] that's that's i've been other places
[2:07:20] i've traveled when i get back to the u.s
[2:07:22] i say
[2:07:23] thank you lord
[2:07:27] and all you got to do is go out the
[2:07:28] country sometime you ain't got to go
[2:07:30] that far
[2:07:33] y'all ain't with me
[2:07:37] you'll be like thank you lord i live
[2:07:38] here
[2:07:40] right so i mean there's a balance
[2:07:42] because some people just man they write
[2:07:43] us off americans americans
[2:07:45] america's finished well not the bride in
[2:07:47] america
[2:07:48] amen right so say this is a woman's
[2:07:52] nation
[2:07:53] it's the number 13. it appears in the
[2:07:54] 13th chapter of revelation
[2:07:56] and you know and as brother brandon talk
[2:07:58] about the the the flag uh written by a
[2:08:00] woman
[2:08:00] um i mean designed by a woman but
[2:08:03] there's uh
[2:08:04] that song america the beautiful oh
[2:08:06] beautiful for spacious
[2:08:08] guys and amber waves and all that uh
[2:08:11] that was written by a woman right so so
[2:08:13] a lot of things it just deals with a
[2:08:15] woman our
[2:08:16] free our symbol of freedom is a woman
[2:08:19] holding a torch in her hand statue of
[2:08:22] liberty
[2:08:24] right this is a woman's nation and the
[2:08:27] prophet had already told us this
[2:08:29] but it took a a certain pharaoh
[2:08:36] a certain leader to be in position right
[2:08:39] that caused the people to get
[2:08:41] so
[2:08:45] people just i if i could just use this
[2:08:47] way people became
[2:08:48] hateful
[2:08:51] but it took a certain man with a certain
[2:08:54] disposition
[2:08:55] to push the people that when you only
[2:08:58] got two choices
[2:09:00] you're going to take the lesser two
[2:09:01] evils i told you i don't even vote for
[2:09:04] evil
[2:09:06] amen i wrote a guy in on the ballot and
[2:09:09] he didn't even show up in one percent of
[2:09:11] the votes
[2:09:16] what he created the united states
[2:09:24] um it appears in the 13th chapter of
[2:09:27] revelation 13
[2:09:28] 13 stripes 13 everything's at 13.
[2:09:31] everything is a woman
[2:09:32] and remember thus saith the lord
[2:09:36] there will be a woman rule
[2:09:39] before the end time now so we
[2:09:43] many people excited about what they see
[2:09:46] but remember
[2:09:48] this is a sign of something to happen
[2:09:51] before the end time
[2:09:55] when time winds up when time shall be no
[2:09:58] more
[2:09:59] so you just saw it right you just saw it
[2:10:02] manifested
[2:10:03] now it's time to really get your heart
[2:10:04] right with god amen
[2:10:07] amen look at it now
[2:10:10] says uh he says uh there will be a roman
[2:10:13] a woman ruled before the end time
[2:10:15] she'll either be president vice
[2:10:18] president
[2:10:19] or it'll be the catholic church as a
[2:10:21] woman now brother branham tied all that
[2:10:23] together
[2:10:25] and all this can fit in this one
[2:10:27] election we already got the vice
[2:10:28] president part
[2:10:29] we got the catholic church because this
[2:10:31] is from my understanding the second
[2:10:32] catholic president since john f kennedy
[2:10:35] so a good search for you is actually go
[2:10:37] back and
[2:10:38] brother branham was living during john f
[2:10:39] kennedy today he said john kennedy
[2:10:42] got there because of the vote of the
[2:10:46] women and if you just see what's
[2:10:48] celebrating hold
[2:10:49] on a whole bunch of women they just this
[2:10:52] the empowerment of women that's right
[2:10:56] all women amen
[2:11:00] glory to god and that's that hey glory i
[2:11:03] just i tell you
[2:11:04] it i heard i heard uh kamala say that
[2:11:08] i might be the first one but i won't be
[2:11:09] the last one
[2:11:13] and she right she right if
[2:11:17] if if they can get past this
[2:11:21] because it's supposed to be the last one
[2:11:22] destruction all over america yeah
[2:11:24] so this thing is going down yeah we're
[2:11:26] gonna go down fast
[2:11:29] praise the lord amen all right so here
[2:11:31] it is
[2:11:32] uh or uh she'll either be president like
[2:11:34] i'll say another a good search for you
[2:11:36] go back and see what brother branham
[2:11:38] said about a catholic president see what
[2:11:40] he might have said about it right
[2:11:41] because uh here the pope comes out and
[2:11:43] make a statement
[2:11:45] about same-sex marriages and then
[2:11:46] there's a leadership
[2:11:48] that goes into the u.s that agrees with
[2:11:50] what the pope said
[2:11:52] so laws may start changing
[2:11:56] right amen and now they're coming
[2:11:59] against your faith
[2:12:01] now some of y'all some of y'all
[2:12:05] uh the lord been telling you to go in
[2:12:06] business for yourself a long time ago
[2:12:08] you're gonna have to go in business
[2:12:10] because you're gonna be able to work
[2:12:11] that job they're gonna it's either this
[2:12:13] or that
[2:12:14] your faith can come into question praise
[2:12:17] the lord
[2:12:18] all right church all right all right all
[2:12:21] right
[2:12:22] god gonna make a way the squeeze a man
[2:12:25] the squeeze is here to squeeze us closer
[2:12:26] to god that's that's all
[2:12:28] said should i be president vice
[2:12:30] president or it'll be the catholic
[2:12:31] church as a woman
[2:12:32] i've seen her a great woman
[2:12:36] the nation bowed to her
[2:12:39] it'll be one before the end time and
[2:12:41] look at that capital
[2:12:42] thus save the lord i want to tell you
[2:12:46] something
[2:12:48] god can talk
[2:12:51] tell you something else god can hear god
[2:12:54] can
[2:12:54] see god can smell
[2:12:58] [Music]
[2:13:00] god can taste god can do all these
[2:13:04] things
[2:13:05] next week i'm going to show you how he
[2:13:06] do all that
[2:13:08] but i want you to see that yes we have a
[2:13:10] this is this is prophecy
[2:13:11] he said 1933 that's why i said 87 years
[2:13:14] ago this was already written
[2:13:16] newspapers didn't pick it up but i mean
[2:13:18] since since
[2:13:19] um for years we've been watching it
[2:13:22] hillary clinton come up
[2:13:23] we watch it uh sarah palin we watch it
[2:13:26] but finally
[2:13:27] it's here and that's why as soon as it
[2:13:30] happened
[2:13:31] i had to put out on my social media this
[2:13:33] day
[2:13:35] this prophecy is fulfilled
[2:13:40] thus saith the lord write it down and
[2:13:43] find out your young people see if it
[2:13:45] happens
[2:13:45] if it isn't i'm a false prophet
[2:13:50] now he put this he put himself out there
[2:13:52] and for years people have been trying to
[2:13:53] just tie this thing down to the catholic
[2:13:55] church
[2:13:56] it is it's todd he said oh he said oh
[2:13:59] and i believe i believe sometimes
[2:14:01] prophecy has multiple meanings
[2:14:03] but we just saw another fulfillment of
[2:14:05] what the prophet spoke
[2:14:07] and if that ain't vindication
[2:14:11] i don't know what people looking for but
[2:14:14] i got enough to keep me grounded
[2:14:16] ain't got enough to keep me close i got
[2:14:20] enough to keep me satisfied
[2:14:22] amen i want to tell you church we are
[2:14:24] walking and vindicated truths
[2:14:25] and i got another little part to the
[2:14:28] sermon that i want to bring
[2:14:29] and i'll do that on next week but uh i
[2:14:32] pray that the lord would just help us
[2:14:34] um you know with this and uh
[2:14:37] i'm gonna ask that we just bow our heads
[2:14:39] we're going to have a word of prayer
[2:14:40] and while i'm i it would just be
[2:14:45] wrong of me if i didn't open up this
[2:14:49] altar
[2:14:51] um to anyone that is here and and just
[2:14:54] feel like
[2:14:54] brother jack i need to draw closer to
[2:14:56] god i need to repent of some things i
[2:14:58] need to get
[2:14:58] i need to get things right i don't want
[2:15:00] to leave this church the way i came in i
[2:15:03] want to
[2:15:03] i want to leave different i want to
[2:15:06] leave difference the lord has been
[2:15:07] speaking to me and i'm seeing him and
[2:15:09] it would just be wrong with me if i did
[2:15:11] not open this alt and allow you an
[2:15:13] opportunity to come
[2:15:14] amen and make things right the scripture
[2:15:16] tells us that the day that we hear
[2:15:18] his voice heart not our hearts and and
[2:15:22] church i don't want us to just kind of
[2:15:23] go through the motions it's not about
[2:15:25] just going to church it's about getting
[2:15:26] our hearts right with god this is the
[2:15:28] place to do it
[2:15:29] this is the place to do it i'm going to
[2:15:31] pray and amen if you
[2:15:33] desire prayer if you desire you know
[2:15:36] anything
[2:15:36] i'm the altar is open for you to come
[2:15:39] and
[2:15:39] we'll pray with you we'll pray for you
[2:15:43] or whatever you desire amen we'll we'll
[2:15:45] do that but
[2:15:46] let's pray and amen you are welcome to
[2:15:48] come here to this altar amen at any time
[2:15:50] the altar is open
[2:15:52] father we uh just approach your throne
[2:15:56] lord we are believers
[2:16:00] we see god very clearly god that the
[2:16:04] word has been vindicated in our day
[2:16:06] those we can go back there to uh the
[2:16:10] scripture and see how they miss the lord
[2:16:13] jesus
[2:16:15] they miss john the baptist they missed
[2:16:18] so many god it was just
[2:16:19] completely missed they they had certain
[2:16:21] things that they were holding on to it
[2:16:23] they were just missing the whole picture
[2:16:25] and god in this hour we don't want to
[2:16:27] miss nothing we really want to be
[2:16:29] spiritually in tune with what the holy
[2:16:30] spirit is doing because
[2:16:33] this is what's bringing us closer to the
[2:16:35] coming of the lord
[2:16:36] and god i don't want to miss the coming
[2:16:38] of the lord i don't want to come to
[2:16:40] church
[2:16:40] lord and hear these things but no my
[2:16:43] life is not up to par where it should be
[2:16:46] god and all i got is head knowledge head
[2:16:48] knowledge will not put me in heaven
[2:16:50] but it's going to take a change in my
[2:16:52] heart and father i need something that
[2:16:54] gives me power over
[2:16:56] sin i i need something that gives me a
[2:16:58] power over
[2:17:00] uh the the enemy that has me bound in my
[2:17:03] life
[2:17:04] god i need something that gives me
[2:17:05] victory i realize i'm gonna leave here
[2:17:07] and i'm gonna face trials but

[3:02:45] the way things happen here uh
[3:02:48] god allow a precious sister to speak in

[3:02:53] to the presence of the lord god gave
[3:02:55] somebody the interpretation
[3:02:58] so yield it to the presence of the lord
[3:03:00] and
[3:03:01] this is what we're longing for this is
[3:03:04] what we're looking for
[3:03:06] it only gets greater from here we know
[3:03:08] the prophet told us that when somebody
[3:03:10] and even the bible says somebody speaks
[3:03:12] in tongues or interprets
[3:03:13] should be out of the mouth of one or two
[3:03:15] that's all he said so it did exactly the
[3:03:18] way the scripture and the way the
[3:03:19] prophet taught us so
[3:03:21] church we are free amen to receive what
[3:03:24] god has done and
[3:03:26] i trust that we'll be able to go back uh
[3:03:28] to the video
[3:03:30] and hear what was being spoken
[3:03:34] because god was trying to say something
[3:03:36] to us amen and i know sometimes we get a
[3:03:39] little
[3:03:40] excited and that's fine because god is
[3:03:42] speaking but sometimes he has something
[3:03:44] he's really trying to say to you
[3:03:46] and i could feel the anointing just kind
[3:03:48] of coming on that and i just thank god
[3:03:50] amen i thank god for what he what he
[3:03:52] spoke to us so we'll go back to the
[3:03:54] video and try to get
[3:03:55] the exact words of what he said
[3:03:58] what he said to us may may god reveal it
[3:04:03] may god reveal it sometimes god wants to
[3:04:05] give us personal messages for the church
[3:04:08] and he he gave us something here today
[3:04:10] church
[3:04:11] amen this 11th month

[3:14:22] i know i haven't been here
[3:14:25] but the lord has been dealing with me
[3:14:28] while i was not here
[3:14:30] and i've been going through a lot so um
[3:14:35] some of you guys may know with some of
[3:14:37] them don't know
[3:14:40] i was expecting a child
[3:14:44] and i lost the baby a couple of weeks
[3:14:48] ago
[3:14:50] and i was so um down and depressed
[3:14:54] couldn't understand why it happened
[3:14:58] i still i mean i still can't understand
[3:15:00] what happened
[3:15:02] but all of it and this a few sisters
[3:15:05] that i spoke to
[3:15:07] that called me and talked to me just was
[3:15:10] encouraging me
[3:15:12] and letting me know that you know
[3:15:14] especially sister ruth
[3:15:15] um that god don't make no mistakes
[3:15:19] and it happened for a reason we don't
[3:15:21] know why
[3:15:22] and i said okay well and i just
[3:15:25] after talking to her i couldn't
[3:15:28] understand still
[3:15:29] couldn't understand so i began to
[3:15:33] just pray i said lord if this is a way
[3:15:36] to bring me back because you
[3:15:41] hallelujah hallelujah
[3:15:46] hallelujah
[3:15:51] hallelujah from from when i had my son
[3:15:55] you never left me you always been here
[3:16:01] no matter how i may not come to church
[3:16:04] when but you've always been there
[3:16:08] and i just began to pray this
[3:16:11] this week pastor just and i just been
[3:16:14] praying i've been reading my bible
[3:16:16] and he's just been showing so much stuff
[3:16:18] to me
[3:16:20] that me losing his child
[3:16:24] started to make sense
[3:16:32] and on my way i have it thank you
[3:16:38] on my way um coming to church i was not
[3:16:41] going to come to church
[3:16:42] because i had to go into the hospital
[3:16:45] last week thursday
[3:16:46] to um so they can proceed to doing
[3:16:49] a dnc to remove the baby
[3:16:53] and um you know i was in the healing
[3:16:56] process and i said you know what
[3:16:59] i'm just going to pray my way through it
[3:17:01] and come to church
[3:17:02] this morning and on my way coming down
[3:17:05] haverhill and i just began to pray i
[3:17:08] said lord
[3:17:09] you've been you started from when it was
[3:17:11] thursday morning at my house my daughter
[3:17:13] woke me up at 4 30 in the morning
[3:17:16] and i just began to read my bible and
[3:17:18] pray
[3:17:19] i said you started then and you i
[3:17:23] asked that you come today and speak to
[3:17:25] me
[3:17:30] you reveal yourself to me
[3:17:38] he did he did
[3:17:41] i just took my daughter to the bathroom
[3:17:44] and she said something she's only two
[3:17:46] years old
[3:17:47] she just said something to me that let
[3:17:49] me know that this is a confirmation
[3:17:53] she just was like mommy while you were
[3:17:56] praying
[3:17:57] god was touching you
[3:18:00] and she said god is singing in your
[3:18:03] heart
[3:18:05] she's only two years old
[3:18:29] although i've been hurt trying to
[3:18:31] understand why
[3:18:32] this happened now it makes sense
[3:18:35] one of the ladies from my old job called
[3:18:37] me and said
[3:18:38] jemima you know god don't make no more
[3:18:42] say and she's not even a christian she's
[3:18:44] not even a believer
[3:18:45] she just said it to me she was like god
[3:18:47] don't make no mistake
[3:18:49] he took the baby for a reason and you
[3:18:52] know
[3:18:54] you you don't know what could have
[3:18:55] happened but um
[3:18:58] he don't make no mistake so just thank
[3:19:00] god for the three kids that you have now
[3:19:03] and just move on
[3:19:05] and that's what i've been i've been
[3:19:07] doing and
[3:19:08] today been a confirmation from the lord
[3:19:12] that everything is going to be okay
[3:19:18] [Applause]
[3:19:24] hey man you know there's been a lot
[3:19:28] going on
[3:19:32] in all of our individual lives
[3:19:37] to those that
[3:19:42] might have been sort of coming sometime
[3:19:47] and not coming sometime
[3:19:51] there was a reason for you being here
[3:19:52] today
[3:19:58] god don't make any mistakes
[3:20:03] he had you here today
[3:20:06] for a reason
[3:20:10] i'm hearing that testimony
[3:20:14] all the things you know
[3:20:18] you know jack mentioned in this message
[3:20:22] that how god is a he's a
[3:20:26] he's a chess player create a condition
[3:20:29] over here
[3:20:31] just to move you into the position he
[3:20:35] really wants you to be in

[3:20:41] ones are going through
[3:20:45] your trials let's see your trials that
[3:20:49] you go through is just
[3:20:51] god putting you in the fire
[3:20:55] for the purpose of molding you
[3:20:59] to his will
[3:21:02] i think it's not strange these fiery
[3:21:04] trials
[3:21:07] amen but count them all joy
[3:21:12] because it's just to mold you and to
[3:21:15] make you
[3:21:16] the beautiful thing about going through
[3:21:18] the fire
[3:21:20] is that on the outside of the fire
[3:21:24] you go into the mold to mold you
[3:21:28] and his hands is the mold
[3:21:31] he don't put you into some mechanical or
[3:21:33] man-made mold
[3:21:35] he mows you with his hands
[3:21:39] no place i'd rather be
[3:21:42] than in the hands of almighty god
[3:21:48] he's the potter and i am the clay mold
[3:21:51] me and
[3:21:52] shake me after your will
[3:21:55] he's doing the molding it may seem
[3:21:58] difficult what we're going through
[3:22:01] the fire's hot but what's it doing
[3:22:05] it's heating you up to making you
[3:22:08] harder as he molds you for a purpose
[3:22:14] he's a great architect he's a great
[3:22:16] builder
[3:22:18] and he's building a bribe without a spot
[3:22:20] or a wrinkle
[3:22:21] molded and tried and tested true
[3:22:26] how many thank god for the word thank
[3:22:29] god for the
[3:22:31] what he's doing
