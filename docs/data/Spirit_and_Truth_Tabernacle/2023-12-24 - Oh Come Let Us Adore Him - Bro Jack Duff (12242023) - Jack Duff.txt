got something I got to do this morning uh and thank God for my niece and my my nephew-in-law and being with us from South Carolina um please y'all y'all y'all notice somebody sell my suit last week in my suit this week and I'm going tell yall what happened I got attached to my nephew-in-law there and he took me shopping amen um on on the day after Thanksgiving and it was buy one get two free said now this a good deal if you buy suits then you know that's a real good deal so I bought me one actually I bought two then I got four [Music] frees so I thank the Lord for His blessings amen but I got something to do this morning amen before we before we go forward uh I got a very special testimony uh that's going to be shared typically Wednesday nights and the nights that we really like to do all the testimonies but this one is somebody that I that usually don't testif and uh and I think we going to be blessed by what they got to say I'mma ask my nephew Caleb come up and just share testimony this morning amen how y'all doing this morning well I'm gon start off with happy holidays to you all um so about maybe six five months ago um me and my father went out looking for jobs um since I've been back here from Portland it's kind of been hard finding something that's you know worth having so um we were just like today we're going to go and show face stop out all the places that we have in mind and just see what happens um we went to the city Riviera didn't get nowhere with that go online can't really show face for that um stopped by Amazon warehouse tried to show face there they already had their um had their interviews already a few months prior so as we were leaving the Amazon warehouse we just happened to stop in the middle of the street for no apparent reason I'm in the passenger seat wondering why are we stopping in the middle of the street for no reason but I didn't say it just in my mind why are we just sitting here but as we look up we see my sister Candace driving right by all right she stopped right next to us um and we told her what was going on I'm looking for a job trying to see what we can find um she she told us that um she had a guy she knew a guy um and she could probably get me in give me a good look uh well opportunity so we went to her office office she sat me down she called the guy he said yeah I need workers I need somebody um and my sister was like my brother he's a good worker he needs a job um he was like okay um we'll go ahead and we'll do the application right now I'll make sure he gets through right so that was the first blessing the fact that we were out there just sitting in the middle of the road and my sister just came by with that blessing so that was was one um so fast forward um I get the interview um the gentleman was telling me that even though he knows my sister and that he got me into the interview it's a panel interview so it's him and five other guys who've never seen it before so I really have to sell myself um so when I got there I did the interview um I felt like I aced it you know few weeks down the line I end up talking well fast forward I got the job right [Applause] so and it's for the City of West Palm Beach so that was a blessing so something stable so so a few weeks down the line I'm talking to one of my supervisors on like the first week um and he's telling me I don't know if you know this but you're the only one who made it past that process process so so so that was another blessing that I saw from God his gentle hand you know guiding me forward um and in the midst of my first week I don't know if you all I'm pretty sure you all know my grandfather uh granddaddy Roosevelt um he was a gardener he took pride in his gardening and I just happened to be out there one day planting some flowers hours all right and it was probably last weekend where it was real windy gloomy it wasn't looking too pretty um but as I was down there on my knees planting these flowers something came over me and I felt just his touch um and I looked up and in the midst of all that gloominess and wind blowing the wind stopped and the sun seemed like it just came down and beam right on me and touched me so I knew that was God with him letting me know I'm in the right place I'm doing what I need to do so that was another occurrence of his gentle hand guiding me forward Another Blessing in my life um then fast forward maybe a week later they told me the 6:30 time I've been starting was just temporary I start at 6 and I've been taking public transportation to get there taking the public transportation from where we live I can't get there by six so I was trying to figure out okay got to find a vehicle maybe cise um my parents blessed me with the opportunity of helping me finance a car so now I have a new vehicle so now I can get to work responsibly hallu so yeah so he's been using his gentle hand in many ways over the last few months to let me know I'm right where I need to be um I've been doing everything I need to do and keep going on the path I'm going um try try to humble myself you know um it took me a while I needed to find myself in order for him to find me amen okay so um it took a little while of you know locking in making sure I got my head right um but in the midst of doing that um I found the right path um and I want to thank you sister Michelle you've helped me so much within these last few months um I would not be here today if I didn't have the help and the words of encouragement from you that I received so I thank you so much from the bottom of my heart everything you've done for me means a lot you've kept my stomach full on days I didn't know when I was going to eat that your words of encouragement have gone a long way um so I thank you from the bottom of my heart I appreciate you [Applause] um both my parents I thank you both God bless you both you all have been a beacon for me from day one um that may not be the easiest to get along with I'm kind you know I go against the grain sometimes but y'all always there for me and y'all always try to understand where I'm coming from and y'all help me so I appreciate you both and I thank you um to my grandmother Rose Dixon you're praying over the years have not gone in vain they've they've done wonders for me I know you pray for me almost every night and I want to let you know that they haven't been in vain and I appreciate you praying for me every night huj hallu um but yeah that's pretty much it so thank you all God bless you appreciate [Applause] it thank the Lord uh for his wonderful provision amen um God is good don't stop praying church I encourage you to just keep praying no matter how long it take Caleb said that he is one that goes against the Green and may not realize but uh Caleb in the Bible was one that went against the Green he stood with Joshua against all the others and say we can take the land it's a good land we're going to stand on the promise regardless of what everybody else was saying they said I'm I'm going into the land and it took him about 40 years to get there oh my but when he got there give me this mountain all right so we thank the Lord amen um I just need to do a quick test a quick test um if if I did come come let us adore him okay that's enough that's enough I'm going read my scripture God bless y'all thank y'all so much I'm going read my scripture let's stand and let's read the word of the Lord y'all can forget about it tur in your Bibles to Luke Chapter 2 [Laughter] turn to Luke Chapter 2 praise God it was just a test it was just a test that's all it was just a test I saw I saw uh brother Simba's uh sister and it's brother-in-law the family God bless you all good to have you all with us amen from Canada uh this this morning I saw Sister Sarah back there Sarah fim and a precious brother here from New York City uh the name again brother brother Amos God bless you amen good to have you uh with us on on today amen y'all can sing that at the end of church all right but not right now I'm going let you sing it later so save your save your singing voices amen but let's let's turn Amen to Luke Chapter 2 and um being that uh tomorrow amen the world celebrates Christmas uh I I always like to maybe bring a little Christmas sermon and uh we see things differently than the rest of the world we realize that our Lord and savior was not born on Christmas day amen but he was born in the spring time when all Lambs are born amen and um but you know nonetheless I I like at this time and I know that people have completely uh taken Christ out of Christmas amen uh we like to put them in and I think it's a perfect time for us to remind the world of what the story really is all about amen it's not about Santa Claus amen it's about Jesus amen and uh so we want to just read a a scripture that relates to this and I would encourage you tomorrow uh before you open your gifts sit down and open your B Bible amen and read what this is all about amen amen uh here in Luke Chapter 2 um um uh hold on one second let me just think about something here I got something y'all know I haven't stand in this pull pit on a Sunday morning to preach for y'all for about six weeks so I got a lot of hay on my fork and uh y'all just bear with me let me change this I'm going to go back to Luke to hold your finger there but let's read Revelation 5 then we'll go back to Luke 2 in a second Revelation 5 and it says this and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book not neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a land L as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of oders which are the prayers of saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for the for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall rain on the earth and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I sing blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and the four beasts said amen and the four and 20 Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever amen let's just pray over what we've read um and then I'll let you be seated before I go back to Luke Chapter 2 let's pray father we thank you for the uh privilege and the opportunity to gather here in the house of the Lord God we bring our adoration we bring our praise uh we bring our love to you because you deserve it Lord um um we uh just reflect on what a year this has been but God you have made a way throughout the year you have been a provider you have been a protector you have been a deliverer you have been a way out of no way you've been our hope amen you have kept our minds you've kept our bodies uh you've been a Healer God everything we have needed you have been and Lord we are grateful for uh all that you have done for us and all that you continue to do and father as we would uh just meditate on this little thought here uh as we uh approaching Christmas we pray God that you would just help us to keep Christ in the center of all that we do for it's all about you it's in jesus' name that we pray amen amen amen God bless you you can be seated amen I saw sister CES too over there good to have one of the daughters of the house amen oh praise the Lord uh let us quickly uh just turn here to uh uh Luke Chapter 2 amen for our title today amen oh come let us adore him amen oh come let us adore him I was so happy to hear the musicians start the service off with that amen and song leader came and and and was singing that and said well that's a confirmation for us amen but we want to uh just take that thought amen oh come let us adore him uh just reading amen the a portion of the true Christmas story as it pertains to scripture uh here in Luke chapter 2 verse um so it's so much I'm going start at verse eight I'm going just skip a little bit here um the Bible says and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night Lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the Lord amen amen uh and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and I love this and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men and it came to pass as the Angels were going away from uh from them into heaven the Shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us now uh I'mma just inject this really quick how did the Lord make it known to them it was through an angel Hallelujah and there are some things that the Lord has made known unto us and the way that we knew it it came through an angel verse 16 says and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the sing which was told them conc concerning this child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the Shepherds and look at this but Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them again our thought today is oh come let us adore him when we talk about adoration amen it's also uh can be used the other word that can be used is the word worship amen and and what worship means is to reverence or render homage with body and mind amen uh you know different people you see that and and I want to tell y'all um you know we only give our worship to the Lord we only bow before for him nowadays it's this people be joking and stuff but I don't like to joke amen but you see somebody coming just start bowing nuh-uh nuh-uh uh-uh don't ever do that that don't belong to nobody but Jesus amen don't give that to nobody but Jesus amen so worship is to reverence or render homage uh with body and mind and they they they U they were referring to a scripture here that I I'll refer to later Genesis 225 I got that out of my key to the Bible uh in the uner Bible dictionary uh this word worship uh the Hebrew word is shaha shaha amen is to bow down or prostrate oneself before another in order to do him honor and reverence and and I love the second song We sung today was Bow Down and Worship Him amen so uh prostrate oneself be before another in order to do him honor or reverence and you know earlier this week I saw a little post by Brother Quenton he put out there in his social media he quoted a scripture amen Psalms 95 and6 the scripture says this oh come let us worship and bow down hallelujah oh come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the Lord our maker the only one deserves that reverence and that respect amen is the Lord Jesus Christ so let us worship and bow down and kneel before the Lord our maker amen another thing uh that they said here uh as far as a definition for this word Worship in the anger Bible dictionary says it is a it's it's as natural to worship as it is to to live think about that statement it is as natural to worship as it is to live amen and uh and and what the feeling and expression of high adoration reverence trust love loyalty and dependence upon a higher power human or Divine is a necessity for mankind brother brandom gives us a definition for the word worship he says to worship is simply to express yourself to him amen I like that and and and now I'm I'm going to just kind of uh walk us through a couple things here because I believe worship is a verb I believe worship requires action hallelujah amen I believe worship requires your participation amen amen amen and here in Psalms 100 verse 1-5 uh we'll look at some things here when it comes to this this worship oh come let us adore him here in Psalms 100 verse 1-5 says Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands amen serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing hallelujah amen and when you when you singing You Can't Keep keep your mouth closed amen you got to actually open your mouth in order to be able to sing Hallelujah you have never heard of an artist a a singer that that that that was that recorded an album never opening their mouth hello somebody that wouldn't be singing that's that's just an instrumental Hallelujah but a singer has to open his mouth and sing hello somebody amen and and you know we can't get so uh so so so so so uh stuck up on oursel that we can't open our mouth and sing to the Lord we come here to the house of God to worship and we need everybody the brothers got to find their part you ain't holy just standing there you ain't that deep no you need to get simple open your mouth you say I don't know the words where we put them on the screen so you can read along and you can sing to the Lord we come here to worship he deserves to worship hallelujah hallelujah and the Bible amen tells us says serve the Lord with gladness don't be sad serving God serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing that mean you ain't got to wait for the s leader to sing your song you already got a song on your heart before you got here come before his presence with singing know ye that the Lord he is God hello it is he that hath made us not we ourselves we are his people amen and the Sheep of his pasture and then here David gives us instruction enter into his gates with Thanksgiving oh yes hello somebody if you said you ain't got nothing to thank God for like like brother Andrew Glover told us I got 10 reasons for you to give God glory number one all right all and all 10 reasons is the same reason he woke me up this morning if you woke up this morning got in a car drove to the church had gas in the car come on somebody you got more than enough to give God glory for if he watched over your family you got something to thank him for if he made a way out of nowhere you got something to thank him for hey he bless you with a job you got something to thank of he gave you a car you got something you don't need to be quiet on them now this is the time to give him praise and when he ain't gave you you nothing you still ought to give him praise enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise the Bible says Be Thankful unto him and bless his name and you want to know why we do this for the Lord is good my boss might not be good my neighbor might not be good sometimes the Saints in the church they're not so good but the Lord is good his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations everybody in here from the youngest to the old oldest got something to give God praise for I invite you this morning oh come let us adore him in reading Psalms 100 we can see uh that worship is done with an attitude of gratitude and here's the other thing that I I've come to realize according to scripture I won't read it but you can find it in 150 amen I like the way Marvin sap says it says you don't even have to be saved to give God glory you Ain even got to be a Christian to give God glory because Psalms 150 says let everything let everything that has breath praise the Lord and Marvin sap said look at your neighbor and say neighbor are you breathing are youa well you should be worshiping there's a man by the name of John Francis Wade he made his living copying manuscripts by hand and way became famous for his artistic calligraphy they had a knack for copy of music as well Scholars had debated whether Wade merely copied the Christmas hymn or whether he actually wrote it but recent scholarship indicates that he did in fact write the hymn it was it was originally written in Latin as adeste Fidelis Wade was a Roman Catholic and all services in the church were conducted in Latin in 1750 He Slipped this hymn that he had written He Slipped it into a manuscript he was copying for the English Roman Catholic College in Lisbon Portugal over 30 years later 1785 it was sent that same little hymn that he slipped into a manuscript it took 35 years somebody else got a hold of it it was sent to the Portuguese Chapel in London and the Duke of Leeds heard it sung there and included it in the repertoire of his own singing group it soon became known around the world it's so known that we open our service with this song but when we open that we only sung the chorus but there are verses to the song and actually you know if if I was to ask some of the young people we might think that the song is called oh come let us adore him but that actually not the name of the song the song is called Oh Come All Ye Faithful so he slipped this in amen a little manuscript and it took 30 years or over 30 years before somebody found it picked it up and began to sing it and and and and what he put in there says Oh Come All Ye Faithful joyful and triumphant Oh Come Ye Oh Come Ye to Bethlehem come and Behold Him born the king of angels then he says oh come let us adore him oh come let us adore him oh come let us adore him Christ the Lord he uh wrote two other verses that I I found in in uh uh um you know one says Sing choirs of Angels sing in exaltation oh sing All Ye citizens of of Heaven above and that's what happened when you know our Lord and savior was born here the angels are announcing to the Shepherds that Christ was born but there was a host of Heaven that joins these angels and they begin to sing and brother brandham tells us that you know when kings are born people sing but here on Earth there was no people to sing for our Lord and savior being born but the Angels did sing Hallelujah here it says glory to God all glory in the highest come let us adore him come let us adore him oh come let us adore him Christ the Lord this other verse he wrote thought was very special and I can't say that I agree with all the words but it says this yay Lord we greet thee it says born this happy morning no he wasn't born on a Christmas morning but I I put it like this born a happy morning Jesus to thee be all Glory given word look at the word there word of the father Jesus was the word amen word of the father now in flesh appearing oh come let us adore him come let us adore him come let us adore him Christ the lord we're going to go back to that verse in a little bit later I want read a a statement here from the prophet amen out of the sermon the uncertain sound amen he makes this this statement here and I want to just read this quickly to you there is a way too that seeth right unto a man but the end thereof is the ways of death it is a little off the subject but I want to dwell on that just a moment pertaining Amen to a certain person that I might just take in my mind a mythical person and name it m Miss John Doe amen this Miss John Doe when she was brought up in church she was a fine woman she loved God oh she went to church with her mother she was taught to do what was right now God give us more of those oldfashioned mothers that'll teach their girls and boys how to do right to know right from wrong that's what we need today we got too many other kind of examples before our young people such as smoking drinking carousing and so forth that ought not to be amen and it's it's uh uh is by mothers socalled sometimes mothers are setting the wrong examples he says now notice in the human body our makeup our regular Anatomy that we live in here is not made to sin amen your your your your your human body was not made to sin look at this amen it says it's made to do righteous you were made for that created to do righteous it's made to serve God God NE never made you just to work and come home and love your children now watch if he said that's all good enough God made you to work God made you to come home love your children love your wife and the wife to be loyal and love her husband the children love their father and mother that's all good watch this it says but God made that's just background for something that God made you to do amen God made you to be a worshiper amen a worshiper of him and look at this now you worship something because it's in man to worship it's in him to do that you worship something regardless of what it is you worship your wife look at what the prophet say now you worship your children all right you worship anything your automobile my God you worship your pleasure you worship something because it's in mankind to worship now we want to know what we worship he goes on to say this Jesus told the woman at the well you worship you know not what we Jews we worship we know what we worship uh we know that we worship God cuz salvation is of the Jew now and then the woman began to explain to him how one said an amount to one said Jerusalem he said the hour is coming I like this and now is when the father will seek worshippers who will worship Him in spirit and in truth for God is spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and Truth now you know I was you know we can see here that uh through this statement you're going to worship something I mean you know often times uh you know we worship our children we put them before God God if we worship our wife or we worship our husband we put them before God right sometime you worship your career you put your career before God it's God that blessed you with the job right hello somebody amen all of you got a new car and all of a sudden you just want to take off going everywhere and it's always on Sunday that you want to make your drive you don't go nowhere on Saturday but Sunday I got to take it for a drive take it for a drive to church amen amen you got you got to put God first in everything in life you got to worship something why not give God his worship here you know um you know as I was just kind of pondering this and thinking through this amen it's important to know that your worship is being accepted the children of Israel worshiped one time a golden calf and that was not accepted amen the children of Israel also worshiped baale one time and had to be restored back to the true worship of The One and Only God Amen uh Cain worshiped one time and his worship was not accepted amen balam built altars but that type of worship was not accepted and there was one time even in the camp of Israel there was a man by the name of Dayan that built himself a church he had a tabernacle and he invited people there he say Moses you ain't an only one hear from God but we hear from God too but but they found out that that Tabernacle was not being accepted by God got swallowed up into the Earth we want to make sure that our worship is being accepted when Jesus had the conversation with the woman at the well regarding worship amen he told her the father was looking for some to Worship in spirit and in truth and and I want to just I want to make it clear that Hallelujah worship was not just related to a physical place oh hallelujah amen not just the mountains of Samaria or the mountains of Jerusalem amen even though our church name is spirit and truth it's not related just to a physical Place hello somebody worship is not even amen limited to one day in the week but worship is something that we give him every day yes sir 24 hours a day seven days a week we worship with our lives we worship with our actions we worship amen and when we come to church we worship when we leave church we're always worshiping God on your job you Worship in school you worship wherever you go you worship here spirit and Truth is is not a physical place and I and I I I I I ask the question then where is Spirit and truth if God is looking for someone to worship him where is Spirit and truth hallelujah spirit and Truth can only only be found in Christ it's a spiritual place that can only be found in Christ when we look at this word worship talking about come and let us adore him when we look at this word worship I was looking at something in scripture and the very first time that the word worship is used in Scripture it is in Genesis 22 oh my Hallelujah Genesis 225 is where we find it the very first time that it's mentioned but amen here um we have a a a a situation where Abraham has been told by almighty God to to take this son that I have promised you and amen I said that you know in him Nations G to be blessed and everything it says I promised you I gave him to you but I take this boy and give him back to me Hallelujah now when when Abraham left home that morning just in my amen thoughts I just don't think Abraham told Sarah what he was about to do I don't think Sarah knew this hello somebody sometime you can't tell your right hand what your left hand getting ready to do but I don't think Sarah knew exactly what was going on not only did not Sarah know but when you when we read there in the scripture even the people that were with Abraham had no idea what was getting ready to happen I love this I love this I love this but here they ask Abraham a question in Genesis 22 and5 it says Abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder oh my my my my my I love this is prophetic word from Abraham I and the lb will go Yonder and worship and come again to you now he knows that God told him to offer this boy on that altar but Abraham speaks by faith I'm going amen up this mountain me and my son we're going to go worship Hallelujah but we coming back to y'all again amen and what I find Amen in this in this particular passage scripture amen uh worship sometimes Demands a Sacrifice it don't always feel good you ain't going to always be happy when you worship but but but worship sometimes Demands a Sacrifice and here's what I find amen the circumstance don't have to be perfect for you to give God worship H amen it ain't a't got to be working in your favor for you to give God praise see the circumstance may not be perfect but the Declaration of Praise demonstrates the position of the heart of the believer I'm going say that again the circumstance may not be perfect but the but the but the Declaration of praise demonstrates the position of the heart of the believer see job lost everything he had children were gone animals were gone money was gone even his body was being wrecked with pain but the Bible said job bowed his faith before God and he worship I'mma tell you something when you're going through one of the best things you can ever do is just begin to worship worship changes atmospheres worship changes circumstances worship changes your outlook worship is a powerful tool in the hands of the believer when he begins to worship it's God even when I don't feel like it amen sometime worship going to require a sacrifice but it shows the position of the heart of the believer It Ain't Easy sometime you you're so down in your spirit it's hard to get words out of your mouth but just open them anyway come let us adore him you just start talking about him his presence comes near you start singing about him his presence comes near there's something about worship also in the Book of Genesis we would see there was another time of worship let's pull this up out of show us to father and it suffices Adam and Eve would Worship in the cool of the evening came and Abel offered their sacrifices in worship to God we know Abel's offering was accepted but Cain's was rejected here brother brandom says look in the beginning when Cain and Abel were turned from the garden their parents and they both seemed they were mortal beings and knowing they had to die look Cain and Abel both of them wanted to worship God Cain he built an altar to God now if an altar is all that God requires Cain was justified and Cain made a sacrifice upon the altar is that right well if a sacrifice and an altar is all God wants Cain was justified sometimes they not just uh you know a sacrifice and altar no no God God want God wants your heart God wants your life look amen he says this then Cain also uh he built an altar he worshiped he put a sacrifice on it and he knelt down and worshiped God but God was displeased because he didn't come the right way see he built the church an altar he put a sacrifice on the altar brought the fruits of the land was probably more beautiful but but you must watch this friend don't never forget this and see you know and and this is this is the thing there's many people going to church today and my uh Hallelujah and and they got all kind of Christmas programs and all kind of things going but you know God might not be accepting everything that everybody doing it it's got to be done in spirit and in truth hello somebody amen so so so we know that H our our forefathers C uh uh uh Cain I mean uh uh Adam Eve uh Cain Abel all of them worship it's just in man it is in man it's in woman to worship something what we want to do is worship God that's it I found that as I just read in Genesis 225 the the word itself worship the very first time it was found in scriptures gen Genesis 225 but we also find Amen in Genesis I'm sorry revelation 22 the the end of the Bible the first book of the Bible the last book of the Bible this word worship is found here and we find it in the very last chapter of the Bible we find a problem here with Worship in this verse Revelation 22:8 and N want to make sure we're putting our worship in the right direction here the Bible says and I John saw these things and heard them and when I heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute we we have a problem here now now I need you to understand John represents the bride all right revelation 22 and verse eight and say he said now now the Bible actually tells us that that John uh says when I when I heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things now now we're not here to worship the angel Hallelujah somebody amen we're not here to worship any we thank God for the angel but we're not going to give no glory to the angel and and here's here's the other thing I like about the a true angel will do this what he just did to John verse n then sayith he unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren the prophets and of them which keep the Saints of this book worship God give me the quote out of the fifth SE let's just read this really quick worship is showing homage bowing down before somebody and we find John doing this representing the bride but John got back up on his feet because he was corrected by the angel hello and I'm going to read you a quote where the angel corrected the people and hopefully they'll get back up and and put their Worship in the place that is supposed to be in and that's on the Lord Jesus Christ look at this in the 56 says have you caught anything he says I was just wondering if you was I might not have to tell you this Sunday notice notice now and then according to the time that God was going to deliver the anti Delian world he sent the eagle and the time he was going to deliver Israel sent the eagle do you believe that that that the time even on John on the aisle of Patmos the message was so perfect that he couldn't he couldn't trust it with an angel you know an angel is a messenger but do you know the messenger was a prophet all right watch says do you believe that let's prove it revelation 22 see let's see if it was an eagle sure he was an eagle he was a messenger but it was a prophet that revealed this whole book of Revelation to him Revelation the 22nd chapter and the 19th verse and he he says I believe that's right I've got it written down here Revelation uh 22:19 I may be wrong no 229 now that's what is I was looking looking at 22:9 that's right oh yes then sayith the eny see thou do it not for I am thy fellow servant of thy brother and the prophets watch what John seen here John I John saw these things and heard them now he's closing it this is the last chapter and when he says I heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things and then the angel amen then he see then then say the unto me see thou do it not no true Prophet Hallelujah would be worship or messenger of any kind I like that I say that again no true Prophet would be worshiped or messenger of any kind amen then he said unto me see thou do it not for of thy fellow servants and of thy Brethren the prophets and of them that keep the sayings of this book you know there is uh uh preachers nowadays they're not even prophets they pastors and they they love when the church worships them they love it they enjoy it do all kind of crazy things in the church I mean it's going on right now in the ranks of this message but but and and I'm going tell you this right now if you ever find yourself visiting one of these churches because you don't know everywhere you go you I'm just going over here sometimes it's good to call and ask Pastor about the church before you go jumping up in there hello somebody you get a spirit on you before you know it but some of these churches in the message they worship their Pastor oh Hallelujah I mean you know all kind of all kind of nonsense I ain't G to go into all that but all kind of nonsense going on you we don't worship no man we don't worship no Prophet hello we don't worship no teacher we don't worship no evangelist amen we don't worship no pastor we don't worship no Apostle we worship God I like this I wrote just a few notes Here John had to be corrected Amen in his worship and we don't worship holy men or holy women uh we worship God we don't worship our jobs our careers or our families we worship God we don't worship we don't worship creation wood or stone we worship a living God our worship is reserved for God and God Alone Oh come let us adore him let's read amen a couple scriptures here since we have time um Matthew 2 is another scripture that refers to this Christmas amen season now just so that we have the the record straight this is a story of the Magi but the Magi did not show up on the day that Jesus was born the Magi came actually roughly two years later we'll find here in the scripture that the Magi did not find Jesus in a manger the Shepherds did but the Magi didn't the Magi actually found him in a house that's right Hallelujah so so so when you see these little scenes amen that everybody got they got a little mixed up they're not really following the scripture but nonetheless we get a to talk about these things so I'm grateful for the opportunity here in Matthew amen chapter 2 the Bible says now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and and and look at I love this why are are they coming Matthew chapter 2 verse two amen says saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen a star in the east and are Come Oh Glory to God they they're they're coming with a purpose oh Hallelujah when you come to church you should be coming with a purpose it's okay to have a new dress it's okay to have a new suit but that's not the purpose the purpose is to worship and even when amen My Worship amen Demands a Sacrifice of me I'm still going to give worship I'm G to open my mouth and I'mma give him praise I can always find a thank you Jesus amen I can always find a thank you Jesus I can always find a lord I Love You Lord Lord I praise you somewhere in the service I can give them one of them amen Lord you've been good to me oh Hallelujah but here the the wise men are coming amen with a purpose they're coming to worship him look at this the next verse says when Herod the king had heard these things he was troubled all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people to together he demanded of them where Christ should be born and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judea art not the least among the princes of Judah for out of these shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel so now so here they're going back to Old Testament scripture and they're finding amen exactly where Christ was supposed to be born what got the city all stirred up is these three visitors that's am man walking through the city and and and they're being led by a star to get here to the city and when they get there they they come with uh I mean these guys have a conviction where is he can you imagine amen strangers showing up in the city amen where is he that was born King of the Jews where is he I mean every they went to the the corner store and asked where is he went to the well and asked where is he somebody here got to know where he is man it stirred up everybody in the city who are these guys and why are they asking this question well they finally open up the scripture and they really they realized that amen there was supposed to be somebody born a Christ the the the the Savior the Redeemer was supposed to be born and here the the the the the wise men were able to recognize said by the star not a star went out when they got to Jerusalem but the light came back on when they got to Bethlehem let's just finish reading this glory to God Amen verse uh verse five again they said to him it in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah art not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come Governor thou shall rule My People Israel then Herod when he had prively called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently Oh My My My for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again that I may come and worship him also and in reading that it just kind of struck me you see uh everybody not coming to church for the same reason you coming hello somebody young sister there young man say I want to go to church with you everybody ain't coming to church for the same reason you coming young man that young lady say well I don't I wouldn't mind going to church with you amen everybody Ain coming to church with the same intentions that you coming you know early this year my my daughter I I bless her heart I thank the Lord for her man come to church and saw a plan of violence said I want to put you in a video of mine says okay all right no problem say can I get your a telephone number she said yes she gave him she gave that man her telephone number it's good to know your daddy number by heart when you ready to call me call this number right here I ain't going to say my number cuz it's it's just streaming everybody get my number there but she knew my number she gave the man a number and and and and I don't know where I was but I was I was I was out somewhere preaching and and I got a telephone call from a stranger say hello it's Sarah there I say Sarah I said hello uh you she said yeah Sarah there she gave me this number I said oh Sarah gave you this number I said yeah yeah I ain't with her right now I said I said what can I help you with uh you know I had this and I had that I had this and I want to get I want to just give her this information I said oh okay I make sure she get that message and then he realized real quick oh she didn't give me her number she gave me your number young young sisters if you want to stay out of trouble give them your daddy's number you say I ain't got no Daddy give them your pastor's number cuz everybody ain't coming to church with the same intentions let's read this I don't even know what verse I stopped on but let me keep reading verse eight okay that I may come and worship him also when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the East went before them until it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with the seed and great joy and when they would come into the house they saw the young child with Mary's mother and fell down and look at this and worshiped him see he's the only one worthy to be worshiped and when they had opened their Treasures they presented un him gifts gold and frankincense and myr and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to herro they departed into their own country another way now brother brandom helps us to understand this amen and these wise men brought very specific gifts to the Lord Jesus and again as we just read it was in the house that they found him not in the manger so they didn't come at the time of his birth the Shepherds did but the wise men came two years later amen while he was a little child and and they brought these gifts the gold the gift of gold that they brought brother brandham says it represented his deity as king of kings his supremeness is why they brought gold the fr frankincense amen was used in service offering you find it in Leviticus 2 you find it in Leviticus 16 verse 6- 15 and it said we find out that that's the order of the priesthood to make an offering to Jehovah when he made the offering and had to be made and mixed with frankincense for a sin offering they took different things and mixed it for the meal offering for the wave offering frankincense was added because it was acceptable to Jehovah if it was anointed with frankincense which means it was was a service to Jehovah his go the gold representing his deity the frankincense mix representing amen the service that he'll have for Jehovah and myrrh the reason that they gave him myrr amen is because that was an anointing for death brother brandham says he was deity in service to die this is what the real meaning of Christmas is all about deity was in service to die now my question is when the shepherd showed up they brought worship and adoration to the Lord at his birth when the wise men showed up they came two years later but they also brought worship and adoration and both of these incidents Hallelujah let me just see if I'm where I want to be yes both of these incidents amen they brought worship based on what they had seen and what they heard come on work with me now just for a little bit but but the Shepherds amen they were in the field watching their flock and and you know it took an angel from God to come down and reveal to them where Christ was if the Angel would have never showed up hello they would have never amen come in contact with Christ they would have never been there at that manger if a angel would not have directed them to where they needed to go they got there and and and we read it in the scripture said we'll read it Again Luke 2 and20 let me just read it real quick so you're with me Luke 2 and20 the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they heard heard and sing as it was told unto them Hallelujah they heard from an angel they heard a host from Heaven joining him and singing about Christ birth and since they heard it they went to find where Christ was Hallelujah and they got very specific instruction from the angel based on what they heard based on what they saw with this Angel amen this is why they went to worship I want to say that again based on B on what they heard based on what they saw based on their experience this is why they went to worship the wise men had an experience they were watching a star brother brandom tells us that they were just looking at the scriptures and and they knew that a star would rise amen based on the scriptures and when they saw that they begin to unpack everything that they had and they begin to get ready for a journey didn't realize how long it would take but they went to Jerusalem following a Star based on what they saw when they got to Jerusalem they pulled out the scripture and they say in Bethlehem is where you're going to find Once the word of God was read to them this is what they heard it took them right into the presence of Jesus the star brought them into proximity but the revelation of the word brought them into the presence I'm going to say that again the star brought them into proximity but the revelation and the revealed word brought them into the presence they worship based on what they sing a star and then when the word was revealed to them they worship on what they heard the Shepherds worship on what they seen and they heard the wise men worship on what they sing and what they heard and I'm here to tell you this morning the reason that we worship is because of what we seen and what we heard I want to just I want to inject this if there's ever a group of people on the Earth that need to give their worship to the Lord Jesus is this group that knows the message of the hour oh Hallelujah let me let me just read a a little quote here for you aen coming out of the message Revelation chapter chapter 5 oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah look at this now we read this a little earlier I I just I I I I like this this is this just this just something uh hold on one second I was we we were reading this we were reading it in Revelation 5 and maybe maybe what we'll do is just go back to that I read it and um I want to just just give you just a John in Revelation five was worshiping based on what he seen and heard the Shepherds worship based on what they seen and heard the wise men worship based on what they seen and heard John in Revelation 5 which represents us he worshiped based on what he sing and hurt let's go back and look at it again so we can we can follow this in the scripture now um the reason that I I I said that oh Lord Jesus Jesus the reason I said this I'm I'm going to read this quote Revelation uh chapter 5 now there's a there's a little something that's going to come out of this quote that's going to help us here brother Rand say the seventh and last one of these seals when they're open is found in Revelation the 10th chapter there was a mighty Angel which was Christ came down and put one foot on the lamb and one on the sea and rais up his hand and say the day is finished time is running out it's all over time shall be no more and he said at the sounding at this time the Myster of God should be finished when God is who God is and how he was made manifest how when that seal was open how we begin to understand now how that he was the son of God he was God himself made flesh and the revelation of who he is that should be finished before the angel can put his feet upon the land and sea and swear that there there'll be time no more when this time comes look at this we're right in that front yard of it right now Hallelujah it says the last one of them is revelation 10 foot on land and on sea time it run out Redemption is over and now he comes in as lion for he was a lion then he now he comes in as Lion of the tribe of Judah watch this now let me just read the rest of this so I can get get to you right quick now the e verse and he's going to Revelation 5 he says and when he had took the book the four beats and 20 four and 20 Elders fell down and worship L having their having every one of them Harps and golden vows full of odors and and prayers prayers of the sints now watch this now this is the time and I want to I wantan to I want I want to make sure we we get this one this is the time when everything must be worshiped everything got to be worshiped even when it Demands a Sacrifice from you it's still got to be worshiped watch this now remember how appropriate now don't let us miss this now listen close when all the mysteries of the church Ages was finished when all the mysteries of the plans of redemption them Seven Seals was open right immediately after this now look it's time for everything in heaven and everything on Earthship to worship God I I like that statement when all the Mysteries have been revealed then it comes a time where everything has to enter into work worship hey hey hey hey hey you shouldn't even be coming here looking for somebody to take you on some deep Trail amen we already got the Mysteries open we know the Seven Seals have been revealed amen we know who the seven Messengers to the seven Church ages are we already have this information based on what we have seen based on what we have heard we ought to enter into worship yes sir amen the wise men did it John did it the Shepherds did it we ought to be in the same spot based on what we've already seen and what we've already heard it should enter us into worship I don't need nobody to pump me up no more I know who I am in Christ brother brandom let let me now I want to he made that statement now I want to just take us back to the scripture and let me finish it here let's go back to Revelation five because based on what John saw based on what John heard it caus him to worship now I'm going tell you something what John saw if you ever get a glimpse of what he saw it would trigger such a worship in you that nobody be able to take it away from you let's look at it again Revelation 5 look at it and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof now what John sees is something very hopeless watch this no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on look at what John does and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on this book was the book of redemption and John realized that if no if there's nobody able to take this book all creation is lost it was important that somebody step forth and take this book Abraham was there couldn't take the book Jeremiah Was there couldn't take the book Isaiah was there couldn't take the book Paul Peter there couldn't take the book John couldn't take the book William brand was there couldn't take the book you were there couldn't take the book John began to cry look at this one of the elders said unto him weep not so see B based on what he heard based on what John heard it triggered worship when the elders spoke to him and said we not the lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David have prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seof and I beheld I like this and lo in the midst of the throne and the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood the lamb see John turned to look for a a lion but when he saw a lamb what he heard and what he saw produced a worship inside of John what we have heard what we have seen had should produce a worship inside of us you see you see let me let me let me put this way the the the the the Shepherds rejoiced because of his birth but they had no idea what else was getting ready to come from this child say the songwriter say Mary Did You Know that your baby boy was going to be the savior of all creation Mary did you know and I can tell you based on scripture she had no idea CU Mary denied the Virgin birth when she lost her son rather than just admitting you wrong and you lost your son hello you should have your father and I I see he said wait wait wait wait wait wait did not you know that I was going to be about my father business he the word had to correct that error here John was discouraged but when he got this this this this message from the the elders saying don't cry John don't cry because the lion of the tribe of Judah Judah has prevailed and when John looked what he saw what he saw was a lamb look at it verse verse six and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beast and in the midst of the Eld stood a lamb as it had been slain a bleeding bloody lamb having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of of the Saints and they sung a new song I want to just pause there just for a second because you know uh brother Brandon made the statement that I just read uh I read it to you it says when all the mysteries of the church age was finished and all the mysteries of the plans of redemption then Seven Seals was open right immediately after this now look it's time for all everything in heaven everything on Earth to worship God now I said this as message Believers if there is anybody on the face of this Earth that ought to know how to Worship in spirit and in truth it ought to be us and do you realize because of Amen what has been given to us Hallelujah somebody we are the only ones that can sing a new song everybody else can't sing songs like this the inspiration comes from underneath the preaching of the word amen some of the new songs that we've heard is our step into the vision I take my place in line another little new song we heard was little by little you'll win every battle little by little you'll conquer every FK out set boundaries around you they'll stretch from sea to see and little by little you'll gain the victory amen you heard a song this morning brother Solomon began to sing let your word be born in my heart another new song that we heard was somewhere between here and there that's a new song that we heard and only people with Revelation only people that done seen these things and based on what they heard can worship like this another new song is I feel the pool I hear the call and I know his Spirit C speaking to me give my all another s new song is it's going to take a stronger win than this to keep me from my promises it's going to take a stronger win hello somebody another new song is he drew me out of many Waters come on somebody new songs you don't hear this in an average denominational Church they wouldn't be able to take this and understand what it was all about but you can sing a new song based on what you seen and what you heard another new song is you are with me those the mountains May Roar and the oceans so I don't know I don't know I can't even remember but I know it's a new song Third Exodus sing the sound of Freedom Jubilee new song Amen another new song has saved me from my airing [Music] way restore me to the faith I pray no no no I think about a song like that and and and Mama wrote that years ago but how appropriate that song is right now it's it's prophetic we didn't know people was going to stray from this message but save me from my airing way restore me to the faith restore me to the faith what faith the faith that was once delivered to the Saints Amen brother Wesley Van Wick sing just another day a new song sister Bernie says I can hardly wait till the church doors open preaching and the singing and the shouting begin I can hardly wait till the minister steps forward a new song Hallelujah some people go to church and they want to see the choir step forward but sister ber say I want the minister to step forward a new song yes sir brother Isaiah Brooks says grant that every day I can have communion a new song Third ex says by his word a new song sister bird say how could I walk away way how could I how did that happen to me I don't I don't know how I got into a condition like this oh how could I walk away but he'll save you

up my praise a new song he say I'mma turn up my praise and I'mma drown out the doubt sister Sher La fontain wrote a song I'm not going anywhere I don't care what I'm going through I ain't going

got to worry about the in between I'm a sing to God a new song based on what I seen and what I [Applause] heard glory to God hallelujah amen don't let her praise him by herself come let us adore him glory to God he's worthy to be praised Glory hallelujah thank you Jesus Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah my God my God we know why we worship we worship in spirit and in truth it's a place in Christ that we found my body wrecking with pain but praise God my bills are passed through but praise God Amen I ain't got this but I got Health praise God hallelujah somebody we got something to give him praise for thank you Jesus Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah I want you to know notice something about John I want you to notice something about John as we just finish reading this chapter and I got one other quote that I want to share with you verse verse nine says and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the Earth and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the numbers of the of them was 10,000 times 10 thousands and thousands of th thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice now they weren quiet with their praise the bible say that with a loud voice they said wor is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing Hallelujah and see let me tell you something you know uh s sister Dixon just entered into this scripture Lord she just did the same thing John did Hallelujah because the very next verse say look let me tell you your worship is not when you participate in Worship You G to Make Some Noise you you go you going to disturb somebody and let me tell you your worship is not even worship until you don't cause somebody to criticize you y'all didn't hear that but your worship has not even reach the worship level until you Calla somebody to criticize you because Paul said I worship God in a way they call hey crazy but when John saw what he saw and when John heard what he heard it caused John to enter into worship verse 13 and every creature which is in heaven can you imagine this worship what this man is doing on Earth calls heaven to he every creature which is in heaven and on the Earth Earth and Under the Sea and such as are in the uh and and on and under the and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying come on somebody you got to open your mouth blessing and honor and glory and power I think he just ran out of words amen be unto him that sth upon the throne wrong oh my my my my my and unto the lamb forever and ever and the four Beast said amen fell down and the and the 4 and20 Elders fell down and worship him that liveth forever and ever John based on what he saw based on what he heard caused him to enter into a a place of worship that everything on the earth everything under the Earth everything above the Earth everything heard John praise God and there's John represented us and if there's ever a group of people that need to worship God on a way that's called here see you are that group based on what you have seen and based on what you have heard one last quote come let us adore him that man had no idea that that song was going to be sung 300 years later little church in the school they come out singing your song right before Christmas on Christmas Eve man had no idea glory to God and and some of the songs that that that some of the Saints have written right here in our midst many of them songs I called out I know it's others out there that write but you know what sometime you got to just kind of think about the gifts that God has given you I can't remember I know sister Rachel wrote a song too what's that song you wrote didn't you write a Christmas song or something that y'all did you going to wrote some songs I know it but sister Ashley I was thinking about her she done wrote songs amen and everybody not a songwriter I'm a first I'm the first one to say I'm not a song writer you don't want me to you don't want me to write a song it just won't have that that meaning that nothing in it you know but I can preach your song brother Brandon makes a statement as we bring this to a close deity of Jesus Christ is where I want to read from Hallelujah that same power that same Christ Hallelujah let the fundamentalists let them people who deny the power of God say it's wrong but the same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost that's right men and women it's time that we find out who you are the devil's trying to hide you back and tell you that you're some little Trot down something you're not your sons and daughters of God the deity is not in heaven well where is it then it's in you Hallelujah I know you think I'm crazy let me tell you something brother when you realize that almighty God lives in you immortal life my life I give Zoe the life of God is in the human being remember uh earlier I I I told you that that man wrote uh in his song one of his verses that he wrote was really really prophetic I I just love that verse it was the last one says oh Lord we greet thee born a happy morning I put that in Jesus to thee be all glory given word of the father now in flesh appearing whose flesh whose flesh is he appearing in your flesh My Flesh he's appearing in our flesh look at this he goes on to say this um it says um he stood back there he's the creator of all things he made life frogs and all these ducks chickens animals created everything and nothing was made but was made by him who Christ the deity he brought down plagues and everything in the days of Egypt who Christ he stopped the mouths of lions he quenched the violence of fire they escaped the edge of the sword they raised the Dead from the grave who Christ oh my what would it be who is it Christ the deity here it is brother sister that deity is in you a little while in the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age Christ in the [Music] manger no Christ in you hallelujah we're not worshiping Christ in the manger but Christ in you the Holy Ghost the hope of Life The Creator God himself dwelling in the human being it does not yet appear what we shall be but we shall see him as he is for will'll be made like him in the in in like like him the spirit in the human being we understand what worshiping in spirit and Truth is all about and and we're not bringing our adoration to Christ in the manger we bring our adoration and our praise is that God you can take somebody like me you can dwell here your word can be born in the manger of my heart if there's anybody that should be singing a new song it's us because of what we see and what we heard I invite you this morning come let us adore him God bless you let's pray father we get the grand opportunity to look through scripture and to see all that you have done Shepherds came on the day of your birth wise men came a couple years later we look at John he saw a lamb slain before the foundation of the world and based on what all of these saw and based on all that they heard it produced a worship for us it has done the same based on what we see in scripture based on what we've heard from your Prophet it produces a real worship what type of
