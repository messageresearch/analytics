[48:13] brother Solomon already said good to see
[48:16] brother friends so uh here in the house
[48:18] of the Lord on today uh good that good
[48:21] to have him I don't know if we announced
[48:23] about the upcoming meetings Okay so
[48:27] y'all know brother Danny got a meeting
[48:29] coming up
[48:31] um the first weekend and in December so
[48:36] we want to encourage everyone to try to
[48:38] be a part of that and I know we also
[48:40] have uh brother
[48:42] um uh Jason's meetings that are coming
[48:44] up at the end of this month
[48:47] um I believe it's next weekend and we
[48:48] got a few of our young people that are
[48:49] going up
[48:55] okay
[48:57] I know we saying the same thing
[49:00] so when I say this weekend I'm talking
[49:03] about right here but I'm when I say next
[49:05] week and I'm talking about next weekend
[49:07] so it's all right I know we're saying
[49:09] the same thing uh but I know that we got
[49:12] young people that are that are headed up
[49:14] that way and my prayer is that God would
[49:18] do something special for our young
[49:21] people uh you know when I was younger
[49:23] our parents used to send us to some of
[49:26] the meetings like that and they were
[49:28] life-altering experiences that we would
[49:31] have and I'm glad that you know there
[49:33] are churches that are picking it up my
[49:35] brother Jason was telling me
[49:37] um you know the one time he was a part
[49:39] of a church but in that church they just
[49:42] had no vision for the young people
[49:44] and I was telling some of the other
[49:46] brothers I said when you see a church
[49:48] that is just all young people you got a
[49:50] problem
[49:51] and if you see a church with all old
[49:53] people you got a problem uh you got to
[49:56] have a church that's mixed with both
[49:58] right that that's a living church right
[50:02] and uh so so it's very important that we
[50:04] continue to uh you know just try to put
[50:08] in our our youth you know put them in
[50:10] environments where God can get a hold of
[50:11] their life uh and you know coming to
[50:14] church is great and I mean but sometimes
[50:15] when you're just sitting underneath the
[50:17] the coattails of Mom and Daddy uh they
[50:20] not as free as they like to be sometimes
[50:23] so it's good to put them amongst other
[50:25] young people that's striving Amen to
[50:27] serve the Lord and and young people that
[50:29] want you know the right things so uh you
[50:32] know we want to encourage them and you
[50:34] know and and and and parents I I would
[50:37] just you know throw this out anytime you
[50:39] desire to send your kids to something
[50:41] like that and uh you know don't don't if
[50:44] you have a situation where we just we
[50:46] want to do it we just don't have the
[50:47] finances just talk to us just let us
[50:49] know something right because we want to
[50:51] help we want to put the kids in
[50:53] environments like that that is our
[50:55] desire amen and I'm praying that God
[50:59] will get a hold of them they'll come
[51:00] back changed and amen with a fire in
[51:04] their soul
[51:05] praise God Amen this is the next
[51:09] Generation so we got to sow into the
[51:12] Next Generation amen praise the Lord so
[51:14] let's just read a scripture here uh
[51:16] Second Chronicles chapter 20. and verse
[51:20] 20 praise the Lord
[51:26] amen Second Chronicles chapter 20 and
[51:29] verse 20. uh just says this and they
[51:33] Rose early in the morning
[51:36] and went forth Into the Wilderness of
[51:40] Toccoa
[51:41] and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood
[51:44] and said Hear Me O Judah and the
[51:47] inhabitants of Jerusalem uh believe in
[51:51] the Lord your God
[51:52] so shall ye be established believe His
[51:56] prophets so shall ye Prosper amen the
[52:00] Lord had a blessing to the reading of
[52:01] his word let's pray father we thank you
[52:04] for the ability to read scripture uh but
[52:08] we know it takes the Holy Ghost to help
[52:10] us not only understand but even apply
[52:13] the scripture to where we are right now
[52:15] so we pray father that you would just uh
[52:18] speak to us and that you would Minister
[52:20] to each and every heart to every need
[52:23] here today may you be glorified
[52:25] magnified exalted father in this place
[52:28] and we'll be careful to give you all the
[52:30] honor and all the glory and all the
[52:31] Praises in Jesus name we pray amen amen
[52:35] God bless you can be seated amen
[52:39] um we want to take for a subject today
[52:44] believe His prophets and so shall ye
[52:48] prosper
[52:49] my man believe His prophets and so shall
[52:51] you prosper
[52:53] um we'll open amen our thought with a
[52:57] quote coming out of the message a
[52:59] greater than Solomon is here amen
[53:05] um I will just make mention that
[53:09] sometimes in just listening to the title
[53:12] of brother branham's sermons there was a
[53:16] sermon actually in the title uh and uh
[53:19] you know you you just sometimes just try
[53:21] to catch what the Holy Spirit might be
[53:24] trying to sing but hearing this message
[53:26] are greater than Solomon is here the
[53:29] prophet says this now and anytime
[53:33] that God ever sent a gift to the world
[53:37] and the people
[53:39] received it so it's one thing to send a
[53:42] gift to the world but it's another thing
[53:44] to receive the gift uh respect the gift
[53:50] a man uh appreciate the gift that God
[53:54] has sent us right he says uh any time
[53:57] that God ever sent a gift to the world
[54:01] and the people received it they become
[54:03] it was a golden age for them he says but
[54:08] when they rejected it good God Almighty
[54:12] they went into chaos
[54:15] all right watch this not a list they go
[54:17] to and disaster now look I I don't have
[54:20] to look very far Amen to see that what
[54:24] brother Branham said here this is 1961
[54:27] that he's making a statement and when
[54:29] you just look around and you see people
[54:31] that have rejected the messenger amen
[54:35] right they rejected the message their
[54:37] lives go into chaos and disaster
[54:40] amen it's very very clear what the
[54:42] prophet is saying here anytime amen God
[54:45] sends a gift come on y'all not not a man
[54:48] coming with his own gift and his own
[54:50] what uh his own ideas and thoughts but
[54:53] when God sends the gift when people
[54:56] accept it it's a age it's a golden age
[55:00] for them but when they reject it it
[55:02] becomes chaos and disaster
[55:05] all right he says he says this they went
[55:08] into chaos and disaster and into
[55:11] punishment now your Bible historians
[55:13] just speak uh uh when one time that they
[55:16] ever rejected God's gifts and his signs
[55:18] and they ever prospered I I just look at
[55:21] the prophet saying this to these people
[55:24] preaching a sermon uh greater than
[55:26] Solomon is here
[55:34] create him inside great in Solomon is
[55:36] not coming amen the great and Solomon is
[55:39] here
[55:41] good God Almighty amen hallelujah says
[55:44] he says uh one time when they were going
[55:47] to battle he spoke God spoke to him says
[55:50] if you wish to prosper do my prophets no
[55:54] harm believe my prophets believe my
[55:57] prophets if you want to prosper well now
[55:59] we know that if this United States of
[56:02] America would accept the gift of God
[56:04] that sent to it which out of America has
[56:07] went evangelists and missionaries that
[56:11] started healing Revival worldwide as the
[56:14] angel Lord 31 years ago spoke down there
[56:17] the river when that light pillar fire
[56:20] hung there and the papers packed it
[56:22] Mystic light appearing over local
[56:24] Baptist Minister uh boy while baptizing
[56:28] 500 at the Ohio river and he said as
[56:31] John the Baptist was sent to forerun the
[56:33] first coming of Christ this message
[56:36] shall forerun II and here we are has it
[56:40] did it see from there it sparked from
[56:43] there from there amen it sparked Oral
[56:47] Roberts come on somebody amen it sparked
[56:51] Tommy Hicks it sparked T.L Osborne and
[56:55] so forth around and around the world
[56:56] they went you know there was a I was
[57:00] just listening to uh a brother just kind
[57:02] of share his testimony
[57:04] um there was just just uh you can take
[57:06] that down for a second he was um
[57:09] you know he's he's believing this
[57:10] message and and uh living out there in
[57:13] in Oregon I believe it was and there was
[57:15] a particular church that invited him to
[57:17] come in as a minister and everything
[57:19] they invited him to come it's like you
[57:20] know we really need you to to be here in
[57:23] our church we really want you to be in
[57:25] our church we really like feel like
[57:26] you'll be able to kind of take us to the
[57:28] next level and uh just just having you
[57:30] around here and speaking every once in a
[57:32] while we really feel like you'll take us
[57:33] to the next level it says but the only
[57:35] thing is now uh we just can't have you
[57:37] preaching about brother Branham right we
[57:40] can't have you doing that around here so
[57:43] he says well you know uh uh I believe
[57:45] the message amen and I'm going to preach
[57:48] that if y'all have me preach that's what
[57:49] I'm gonna preach so you know he knew at
[57:51] this church teal Osborne was very well
[57:54] connected to this group of people it
[57:56] says T.L Osborne was one of the people
[57:58] that actually helped get this church
[58:00] started and he says uh he knew T.L
[58:02] Osborne was coming to the church and
[58:04] there he was like the only one in the
[58:06] church believer in the message and he
[58:08] couldn't find another message church
[58:09] around so he was just going there he
[58:11] says now if I preach y'all know what I'm
[58:13] going to preach I'm gonna tell you what
[58:14] brother Branham said right so he says
[58:16] teal Osborne was coming and he said he
[58:19] was sitting there praying he said now
[58:20] T.L Osborne I know you've had some
[58:23] experience with this message he says I
[58:25] hope you would get up here and share
[58:26] with these people what you've had
[58:28] experiences with you know don't don't
[58:29] don't sit here and just kind of shirk
[58:32] your responsibility tell these people
[58:33] where it comes from your Healing
[58:35] Ministry and I had all God tell these
[58:37] people where it comes from so he was
[58:39] just praying Lord don't let them don't
[58:40] let them get out that Pulpit without
[58:42] sharing his testimony well teal Osborne
[58:44] got the talking and preaching he says I
[58:47] I just feel led to stop right here
[58:49] I feel like to stop I I want to just
[58:51] kind of take time and just kind of share
[58:53] this is how it all got started for me
[58:55] and it began to tell him about brother
[58:57] Brandon and this church was against
[58:58] brother Branham but they're here here
[59:00] he's connected to the church he helped
[59:03] get the church started but he had to
[59:05] tell him the truth as the weirdest thing
[59:07] got started
[59:08] Hallelujah glory to God if if if the
[59:12] nation of America would accept it the
[59:14] gift that God had the gift that God sent
[59:17] if the nation of America would have
[59:19] accepted where would we be today
[59:22] glory to God and then I want to go
[59:24] deeper in destination what about the
[59:27] church if the church would have accepted
[59:29] the gift that God had sent where will we
[59:32] be today
[59:33] all right let's go on a little further
[59:35] here amen he says um uh notice now it
[59:39] says if America would receive God's gift
[59:41] it would be a golden age for us if all
[59:45] of the American churches would accept
[59:46] God's gift what is God's gift to the
[59:50] church the Holy Ghost amen he says what
[59:53] if all the American people that believed
[59:55] in Christ would receive the Holy Ghost
[59:56] they wouldn't have to wonder who's going
[59:58] to be in the Sputnik now I like that
[1:00:01] brother Branham did not even put it on
[1:00:02] himself amen he said the gift is the
[1:00:05] Holy Ghost all right he says uh the Holy
[1:00:07] Ghost what if all American people
[1:00:08] believe uh that believed in Christ we
[1:00:11] received the Holy Ghost they wouldn't
[1:00:13] have to wonder who's going to be in the
[1:00:14] Sputnik or who's going to be in a
[1:00:16] machine
[1:00:17] 180 miles around that church would be in
[1:00:20] glory before they could get a Sputnik
[1:00:22] started Hallelujah glory to God I don't
[1:00:26] care what is going on with Russia we
[1:00:29] don't have to be worried about that
[1:00:31] it ain't nothing to be worried about
[1:00:34] church glory to God I mean you start
[1:00:37] don't don't don't feed on everything you
[1:00:39] you hear in the news because they're
[1:00:42] only telling you what they want you to
[1:00:43] know
[1:00:45] well I'm gonna tell you something for me
[1:00:47] I'm always watching prophecy and man I
[1:00:50] mean and I know that Russia is the King
[1:00:52] of the North
[1:00:53] amen I believe all that's happened in
[1:00:56] Ukraine is that they're forcing a man a
[1:00:58] portion of the 144 000 to get back to
[1:01:01] Israel
[1:01:03] that's all guys doing for us in a
[1:01:05] hundred a portion of the 144 000 to be
[1:01:08] back in Israel because he cannot deal
[1:01:10] with the 104 44 000 outside of Israel
[1:01:14] and now when he's Gathering that 144 000
[1:01:17] to deal with them the bride has to be
[1:01:20] gone
[1:01:21] glory to God before he starts dealing
[1:01:23] with them
[1:01:24] blessed be the name of love so I'm
[1:01:26] looking for a rapture
[1:01:28] I'm under expectation for a change in my
[1:01:30] body
[1:01:31] all right church I'm not really worried
[1:01:33] about what's happening over there but
[1:01:35] watch this brother Brandon's going to
[1:01:36] say something here he says uh he says uh
[1:01:39] uh uh now that they're they're they the
[1:01:42] church would be in glory before they
[1:01:44] could get a Sputnik started that's right
[1:01:46] and you don't have to worry about now
[1:01:49] they're so scared if we would receive
[1:01:52] God's gift to us why we wouldn't have to
[1:01:54] try to dig holes to hide from the atomic
[1:01:57] bomb
[1:01:59] if we just receive the gift believe it's
[1:02:02] prophets and you'll Prosper all right he
[1:02:05] says uh uh uh you wouldn't have to they
[1:02:07] wouldn't have to dig holes to try to
[1:02:08] hide from the atomic bomb and put all
[1:02:10] the newscasts out to build a shelter to
[1:02:13] get into it I want to ask you something
[1:02:15] they claim this new hydrogen bomb that's
[1:02:18] the only ones we know of
[1:02:21] amen we don't know what they got back to
[1:02:25] sleep it says but they can stand in
[1:02:28] Moscow Russia and time a bomb right on
[1:02:31] this building by the stars and got it by
[1:02:34] radar and got them placed to every major
[1:02:37] nation in every major city in the world
[1:02:39] just pull on a string and There She Goes
[1:02:42] somebody's gonna drink too much vodka
[1:02:44] one day and there it'll be
[1:02:47] but you know what we we realize that uh
[1:02:50] you know they got stuff that they ain't
[1:02:53] even told us about amen and all the
[1:02:55] little threats going on back and forth
[1:02:57] everybody trying to prove who what that
[1:02:59] what they got we we realized that it
[1:03:01] could just be wiped out in no time but
[1:03:02] for me I'm looking for a Rapture of the
[1:03:04] church before the destruction come and
[1:03:07] the other thing I know about this is
[1:03:09] that they can't wipe out this whole
[1:03:10] earth
[1:03:11] I don't care what threats they make they
[1:03:13] can't wipe it out yet the reason being
[1:03:16] that 144 000 have not been called yet

[1:12:40] Soul prosperous
[1:12:44] now you know I I just want to say this
[1:12:46] you know uh Prosperity is something a
[1:12:49] lot of people look forward to
[1:12:51] amen and and that they want to succeed
[1:12:53] in just about every area of Life uh they
[1:12:56] want to succeed in business
[1:12:58] um you know those that play sports they
[1:13:00] want us to see it in sports those that
[1:13:02] have careers they want to succeed in
[1:13:03] career in their career music a man
[1:13:06] preaching everyday things in life we
[1:13:09] want to be successful but I want you to
[1:13:11] realize the most important thing that
[1:13:13] you can be successful in and the most uh
[1:13:15] the best thing that you can have
[1:13:16] prosperity in is when your soul is
[1:13:20] prospering
[1:13:22] hallelujah amen the Bible say what does
[1:13:25] it profit a man to gain this whole world
[1:13:27] and then lose his soul right so when
[1:13:30] your soul is prospering but in order for
[1:13:33] your soul to prosper you got to be
[1:13:34] planted amen amen
[1:13:38] and it's one thing to be planted in the
[1:13:41] house of God and to be potted in the
[1:13:43] house of God
[1:13:45] two different things amen I learned this
[1:13:48] when I was working at Christ Fellowship
[1:13:49] they say you want to be planted in the
[1:13:51] house of God not just pot it because a
[1:13:54] potted plant can be moved
[1:13:58] easily moved
[1:14:00] picked up and just drug away
[1:14:03] a trial coming you gone just like that
[1:14:05] but brother something that's planted you
[1:14:09] have to do some digging to get that up
[1:14:12] [Music]
[1:14:15] glory to God I'm I'm so glad we got
[1:14:18] Saints that's planted
[1:14:20] not just pot it here it is Greek Lexicon
[1:14:23] amen this word Prosper uh it it says to
[1:14:28] to lead by a direct and easy way
[1:14:31] amen uh to Grant a successful issue to
[1:14:35] cause the Prosper to be successful all
[1:14:38] right and they also use another
[1:14:39] definition to Grant a prosperous and
[1:14:41] expeditious Journey so you know when I
[1:14:44] look at it from the the Greek there are
[1:14:47] a couple things that I want to point out
[1:14:48] here and I want to get back to another
[1:14:50] scripture in a second but Ellie easer a
[1:14:54] man was the uh the faithful servant to
[1:14:57] Abraham
[1:14:58] and uh Elise or what caused his journey
[1:15:01] to be successful or what causes journey
[1:15:05] to be prosperous is that Eliezer found a
[1:15:09] wife for the promised son
[1:15:11] Hallelujah when Rebecca said that she
[1:15:13] would go back with Ellie he's all she
[1:15:15] heard was the testimonies of who Isaac
[1:15:18] was she never saw a picture of him amen
[1:15:21] and there were no Facebook connections
[1:15:23] amen no social media connections all she
[1:15:26] heard were the testimonies of what was
[1:15:28] going on in that house and she says I
[1:15:30] will I will go and be with this man I
[1:15:33] will be his wife so elieza had a
[1:15:35] prosperous Journey when he prayed that
[1:15:37] prayer at the well and Rebecca coming
[1:15:39] was an answer to his prayer that made
[1:15:42] his journey prosperous
[1:15:45] glory to God I think about Joseph amen
[1:15:48] and all the things that Joseph went
[1:15:51] through there uh in uh in his lifetime
[1:15:53] Joseph the Bible says was a prosperous
[1:15:56] man amen and Joseph prospered at home
[1:16:00] his daddy gave him the rainbow the seven
[1:16:03] color rainbow coat which was a little
[1:16:05] different from all his brothers and and
[1:16:07] and I I I I I I always when I talk about
[1:16:10] his stories always tell parents you'd be
[1:16:12] careful how you treat one kid over the
[1:16:13] other because you can cause a problem in
[1:16:16] your family
[1:16:17] amen don't don't be telling I love you
[1:16:19] more than I love no no don't be saying
[1:16:21] things like that I love you equally
[1:16:24] amen amen you want you want to want to
[1:16:28] minimize some of the troubles in your
[1:16:29] family
[1:16:30] treat them all equally now they all
[1:16:32] different but treat them equally
[1:16:35] some of them cut up some of them act up
[1:16:37] but you still gotta love them all
[1:16:38] they're yours
[1:16:41] praise the name of the Lord
[1:16:43] amen amen they see Christ through you
[1:16:47] come on certs amen you got to be Jesus
[1:16:51] to them children
[1:16:54] Hallelujah
[1:16:56] all right but but but but Joseph
[1:16:58] prospered at home
[1:16:59] Joseph even prospered in slavery
[1:17:05] that's why I got promoted in Potiphar's
[1:17:07] house Joseph Joseph was probably
[1:17:09] whatsoever he was doing
[1:17:11] Joseph was prospering
[1:17:14] not only did Joseph Prosper slavery
[1:17:17] Joseph's prospered Joseph prospered in
[1:17:20] jail
[1:17:21] [Applause]
[1:17:24] he became the head man over everybody in
[1:17:27] jail everywhere Joseph went
[1:17:31] he prospered and Everywhere You Go
[1:17:34] praise His holy name you're supposed to
[1:17:37] prosper believe His prophets and so
[1:17:40] shall ye prosper
[1:17:45] at home I'm a prosper
[1:17:48] Amen in slavery he prospered in jail he
[1:17:51] prospered
[1:17:52] on this job I Prosper on my next job I
[1:17:56] Prosper wherever I go I prosper
[1:18:00] and the reason I'm plus because I'm
[1:18:01] planted
[1:18:03] in the house of the Lord
[1:18:05] glory to God Amen the other thing I
[1:18:08] found is that Joseph also profited in
[1:18:10] the palace
[1:18:11] everywhere he went because he became
[1:18:13] second in charge to Pharaoh Joseph was
[1:18:16] prospering
[1:18:18] and I want to say this in Noah's day his
[1:18:21] family believed
[1:18:23] and they prospered amen they were the
[1:18:26] only ones that survived the flood of
[1:18:28] that time is because they believed a
[1:18:30] Prophets
[1:18:31] and they prospered and Moses Dave those
[1:18:35] that believed his message they prospered
[1:18:38] amen the firstborn received life praise
[1:18:42] God Amen later on you see in the
[1:18:44] scripture that Caleb was still holding
[1:18:46] on even though Moses was gone Caleb was
[1:18:49] holding on to a man of things that Moses
[1:18:52] told him it had not yet come to pass in
[1:18:55] the days that Moses was alive but
[1:18:57] because God was in Moses and everybody
[1:19:00] knew God was in Moses what he said it
[1:19:03] was going to prosper amen and Caleb said
[1:19:05] look I says uh I realized that Moses is
[1:19:09] gone and I've been waiting on this
[1:19:10] mountain for 40 something years
[1:19:12] he says I'm just as strong today as I
[1:19:16] was when I received the promise it says
[1:19:18] now therefore give me this mountain
[1:19:21] praise God Caleb kept us kept this focus
[1:19:24] on on that mountain that he knew Moses
[1:19:26] promised him keep your focus on the
[1:19:29] promises that God gave you
[1:19:32] you're prospering you'll be successful
[1:19:34] in it Caleb received his mounts another
[1:19:37] one that I I want to pick up because he
[1:19:39] believed the prophet
[1:19:41] Joshua believed the prophet
[1:19:44] and he prospered
[1:19:46] can we pick him up in Joshua 1 verse 5.
[1:19:50] glory to God
[1:19:53] look at this
[1:19:55] oh yes amen amen Joshua accepted his
[1:19:58] commission to take the people to the
[1:20:00] land and he also had the commission to
[1:20:02] divide it amongst the people and here he
[1:20:05] was told in Joshua 1 verse 5 says there
[1:20:08] shall not any man
[1:20:10] be able to stand before thee all the
[1:20:13] days of our life
[1:20:15] my this man was not gonna lose no
[1:20:17] battles
[1:20:18] amen as long as they follow the word of
[1:20:20] God as long as they follow what the
[1:20:22] prophet said they wouldn't lose no
[1:20:23] battles so there should not anymore and
[1:20:26] I love this you know uh uh here let me
[1:20:28] keep reading their son I need man to be
[1:20:30] able to stand before thee all the days
[1:20:31] of life as I was with Moses so I will be
[1:20:36] with thee I will not fail thee nor
[1:20:39] forsake thee and you know and I think
[1:20:42] about that that promise that God gave
[1:20:44] Joshua that um you know I never let even
[1:20:48] though Moses did things that he wasn't
[1:20:49] supposed to do he when God told him to
[1:20:52] speak to the Rock he struck it struck it
[1:20:54] twice right and uh uh and it caused him
[1:20:57] to miss the promised land because he
[1:20:58] disobeyed God Amen uh Joshua saw Moses
[1:21:03] failed but God said look as I was with
[1:21:05] Moses I will not failed enough for
[1:21:07] safety Joshua saw Moses called for flies
[1:21:10] and and and all the plagues that hit
[1:21:12] Egypt and he saw God just operate in
[1:21:15] Moses life Hallelujah but he saw that
[1:21:18] same God come on the scene in his life
[1:21:20] glory to God because here Joshua had the
[1:21:23] opportunity to speak the word son stands
[1:21:27] still Moon hang over Angeline the same
[1:21:30] God that was with Moses was now
[1:21:32] demonstrating that he was with Joshua
[1:21:35] my Joshua held to the word that God told
[1:21:38] me hell to what Moses said look at this
[1:21:40] verse 6 be strong enough good courage
[1:21:42] For unto this people shall not divide
[1:21:45] for an inheritance the land which I
[1:21:47] swear into their fathers forgive them
[1:21:49] only be thou strong and very courageous
[1:21:52] that thou mayest observe to do according
[1:21:54] to all the law which Moses my servant
[1:21:58] commanded me
[1:21:59] I love these words Joshua do all the law
[1:22:04] not the parts that you agree with
[1:22:07] right but Joshua do it all yeah amen if
[1:22:10] you want to prosper just accept it all
[1:22:13] elujah amen we're not here to try to
[1:22:16] explain it away we're here to just
[1:22:18] accept it all amen all that the prophet
[1:22:22] said all right says this uh it says only
[1:22:24] be thou strong and very courageous that
[1:22:26] thou man subserve to do according to all
[1:22:28] the law which Moses my servant

[1:22:34] mayest Prosper with us so ever thou
[1:22:37] goest amen this book of the law shall
[1:22:39] not depart out of that mouth but Thou

[1:23:23] you know Joshua uh given this Great
[1:23:26] Commission and he fulfilled it in his
[1:23:28] day and he prospered in the thing that
[1:23:30] God sent him on this Earth to do amen
[1:23:33] but he hailed to what Moses said he
[1:23:35] always reminded the people what Moses
[1:23:37] said
[1:23:38] Glory Glory Glory Joshua did not have
[1:23:41] his own message
[1:23:43] hello somebody he was still following
[1:23:46] Moses message even though Moses was gone
[1:23:49] amen we don't have our own message we're
[1:23:52] following a message
[1:23:54] glory to God even though our Prophet is
[1:23:56] gone believe His prophets
[1:23:59] so shall you prosper all right this uh I
[1:24:03] think we'll find in scripture there's so
[1:24:05] many people a man that had the
[1:24:07] opportunity to come in contact with a
[1:24:09] prophet in their day and they believe
[1:24:12] that Prophet May prospered uh one of
[1:24:15] them amen we find the story in in second
[1:24:18] Kings chapter seven
[1:24:20] and I won't I won't read it I'll just
[1:24:22] tell it tell it to you but this was a
[1:24:25] very
[1:24:26] um a a difficult time the prophet had
[1:24:30] already spoke that there was not going
[1:24:31] to be any rain until he called for rain
[1:24:33] and uh here he was impacted by his own
[1:24:36] words glory to God there was no rain and
[1:24:39] and the people are in a family and uh
[1:24:42] one day he's you know God sends him and
[1:24:44] and has some Ravens there prepared to
[1:24:47] bring him food glory to God he had not
[1:24:49] just room service but he had Raven
[1:24:51] service amen that probably was receiving
[1:24:54] food from the he never worked for it God
[1:24:57] just sent it
[1:24:59] oh I love God you know God would just
[1:25:02] send you business when you need it
[1:25:05] and you all your mark
[1:25:07] ERS would never get that
[1:25:11] sending you business when you need it
[1:25:14] hey he'll have the Ravens bring it to
[1:25:16] you
[1:25:17] Hallelujah you get an email
[1:25:23] find out about me God know how to get
[1:25:25] you what you need
[1:25:28] and here you know the prophet is is uh
[1:25:31] it's benefiting from the Ravens bringing
[1:25:33] them the food but that got to a point
[1:25:34] where the brook had dried up amen the
[1:25:37] Raven's not bringing uh any food and the
[1:25:39] other thing about the prophet now in
[1:25:41] order for him to get the food from the
[1:25:43] Ravens he had to be in the very specific
[1:25:45] spot
[1:25:47] amen that God had ordained the Ravens to
[1:25:50] go
[1:25:51] I I want you to understand you just
[1:25:53] can't be anywhere to get spiritual food
[1:25:56] you got to be exactly where God wants
[1:25:59] you to be in order to get your soul fed
[1:26:02] in order for your soul to prosper
[1:26:06] glory to God amen amen so you know uh
[1:26:10] hear the the the the brook is dried up
[1:26:13] and and now they're at a spot where you
[1:26:15] know God has told the prophet to move
[1:26:17] said there's no more water here the
[1:26:19] Ravens are not coming back but he says I
[1:26:21] got a woman that I have uh ordained to
[1:26:24] sustain you through this drought he said
[1:26:27] I want you to go down to her house and
[1:26:30] here he goes down to this this woman of
[1:26:32] zarephathy goes to Harrison and the
[1:26:34] seeds are out there going to maybe pick
[1:26:37] up some sticks to kind of get a fire lit
[1:26:39] so she can make her last cake Hallelujah
[1:26:42] and the prophet looks at it says now uh
[1:26:45] woman if you don't mind would you go and
[1:26:47] just fetch me some water and brother
[1:26:49] Brandon said she was feeling sorry for
[1:26:51] this old man she didn't realize this old
[1:26:53] man happened to be a prophet glory to
[1:26:56] God but she's feeling sorry to say you
[1:26:58] know what I think I can share my last
[1:27:01] thing of water with him but I'll eat
[1:27:03] I'll save the cake for my son and I but
[1:27:05] I'll give him the water Hallelujah and
[1:27:07] that she's going to get the water see
[1:27:10] here's a voice from the Bible say if you
[1:27:11] don't mind Hallelujah glory to God if
[1:27:14] you don't mind would you bake me a cake
[1:27:16] first
[1:27:18] in the start of the woman she said now
[1:27:21] wait a minute now I don't mind giving
[1:27:23] you the water but don't you see there's
[1:27:25] a famine in the land and I got one more
[1:27:28] uh a thing that I can bake a cake with
[1:27:30] and I was gonna give it to my son and to
[1:27:32] myself and then we were gonna die he
[1:27:35] says now don't you worry about dying
[1:27:37] sister says if you would bake me a cake
[1:27:39] first
[1:27:41] Hallelujah I'm here to tell you
[1:27:43] something that you've been looking to
[1:27:45] hear my sister you've been waiting on
[1:27:47] these words thus
[1:27:49] saith the Lord
[1:27:52] your Crews will not go empty and your
[1:27:55] bear will not run dry if you can believe
[1:27:58] His prophets then you will prosperized
[1:28:01] [Applause]
[1:28:04] the Bible says she was sustained through
[1:28:07] that because she believed the prophet
[1:28:10] her household prospered
[1:28:14] I want to pick up this a man these
[1:28:17] disciples in Luke chapter 5. let's pick
[1:28:20] him up here Luke chapter 5. believe His
[1:28:23] prophets
[1:28:24] you'll prosper
[1:28:27] and this has been something that people
[1:28:28] been doing all all since time began I'm
[1:28:32] telling from the days of Noah they
[1:28:34] believe the prophet they prospered those
[1:28:36] that rejected to the prophet they didn't
[1:28:38] Prosper this is going to be the same
[1:28:40] thing today glory to God God don't
[1:28:42] change his mind Jesus himself being the
[1:28:45] prophet of all prophets here's a we're
[1:28:47] picking up the story here in in in in in
[1:28:49] Luke 5. let's read it
[1:28:52] says uh and it came to pass as the
[1:28:56] people pressed upon him to hear the word
[1:28:57] of God
[1:28:58] he stood by the lake of genocide now
[1:29:01] let's just try to put ourselves on the
[1:29:03] scene as to what's going on here I thank
[1:29:05] God that God sent us a prophet that can
[1:29:07] kind of give us some a panoramic view of
[1:29:11] everything that's going on this day he
[1:29:13] enters into Luke 5 and he tells us amen
[1:29:16] that what has happened is that the
[1:29:18] disciples have been out fishing all
[1:29:19] night
[1:29:21] and they finally parked there at their
[1:29:23] boats they they put them to dock in a
[1:29:25] certain spot and the Very spot that they
[1:29:28] put their their boats to dock in Jesus
[1:29:30] happens to come to that area and he's
[1:29:33] preaching to the people hallelujah and
[1:29:35] as he's preaching to the people you know
[1:29:37] uh the disciples that come to a spot
[1:29:39] where you know here they are absolutely
[1:29:42] discouraged
[1:29:44] amen of of of of of not catching any
[1:29:47] fish they're discouraged because this is
[1:29:50] their their livelihood they sell these
[1:29:52] fish and they make money they feed their
[1:29:54] family but here they're going out at
[1:29:56] night and they caught nothing amen so so
[1:29:58] the day that uh Jesus shows up I'm sure
[1:30:01] this is a day when the disciples are
[1:30:03] absolutely discouraged
[1:30:07] let's get it now amen the absolutely
[1:30:09] discouraged while Jesus is preaching
[1:30:11] amen the people are just approaching the
[1:30:13] Crowds Are Gathering and and brother
[1:30:15] Brandon say Peter's just sitting on a
[1:30:17] stop saying you know let me just hear
[1:30:19] what this man got to say so you know I
[1:30:21] heard about him I heard this I heard
[1:30:23] that but let me just hear what this
[1:30:24] fella got to say hallelujah he coming
[1:30:26] with an attitude to church
[1:30:29] glory to God Amen sometimes we come to
[1:30:33] church with the same old types of
[1:30:34] attitude we don't realize God can change
[1:30:37] our situation with just one word
[1:30:40] one action can change everything amen
[1:30:43] the power of the spoken word is here to
[1:30:46] change anything
[1:30:47] if you would just operate in faith God
[1:30:51] can speak to your condition
[1:30:55] let's pick it up here in Scripture
[1:30:58] he said something came to pass that as
[1:31:01] the people pressed upon him so he's been
[1:31:03] pressed out into the waters standing a
[1:31:05] short preaching about the people keep
[1:31:07] oppressing pressing now he's standing in
[1:31:09] the water now watch what happens it says
[1:31:11] upon him to hear the word of God he
[1:31:13] stood by the lake of genocide and he and
[1:31:16] saw two ships standing by the lake but
[1:31:19] the fishermen were going out of them and
[1:31:22] were washing their Nets it says and he
[1:31:25] entered into one of the ships which was
[1:31:28] Simon's and prayed him that he would
[1:31:31] thrust out a little from the land and he
[1:31:34] sat down and taught the people out of
[1:31:35] the ship now now what Jesus is doing is
[1:31:38] just I got to separate just a little bit
[1:31:40] from the land I don't want the people to
[1:31:41] kind of trying to come out here in the
[1:31:43] water to hear what I got to say imma
[1:31:44] talk loud enough so y'all can hear me
[1:31:46] right here from this ship now it's not
[1:31:48] an accident that Peter is in church this
[1:31:52] morning it's not an accident that he
[1:31:54] Parks his boat glory to God right where
[1:31:57] Jesus gonna meet up need a boat amen all
[1:32:01] these things are foreign by God
[1:32:04] everything you going through right now
[1:32:07] has been for ordained by God
[1:32:14] Pete is discouraged Jesus see the other
[1:32:17] disciples
[1:32:18] um uh getting their necks and everything
[1:32:20] all fixed up because they they want to
[1:32:22] go fishing again this is their this is
[1:32:23] their their trade but he's there on the
[1:32:26] boat he said just push out a little bit
[1:32:27] uh Peter I need to talk to the people
[1:32:29] just pushed out a little bit from the
[1:32:31] show so they don't press me and try to
[1:32:33] get in the boat either just just push
[1:32:34] out a little bit Hallelujah some
[1:32:36] Miracles are just for you
[1:32:38] [Music]
[1:32:44] putting a little distance between him
[1:32:46] and the people because he really need to
[1:32:47] deal with Peter
[1:32:49] come on somebody
[1:32:51] amen he really want to deal with your
[1:32:53] situation
[1:32:54] so sometimes he got to separate you from
[1:32:57] everybody just create a little distance
[1:32:59] because this miracle is for you
[1:33:04] look at it now
[1:33:06] it says in uh now when when uh
[1:33:10] uh verse three and he entered into one
[1:33:13] of the ships which was Simon's and
[1:33:14] prayed him that he would thrust out a
[1:33:15] little from the lamb and he sat down and
[1:33:18] talked the people out of the ship now
[1:33:20] when he get left speaking his sermon was
[1:33:22] over
[1:33:23] he's in the boat still now
[1:33:25] the sermon is over and maybe Peter
[1:33:28] trying to figure out what no okay what
[1:33:29] we gonna do now Hallelujah Peter got
[1:33:32] something for you thank you for letting
[1:33:34] me borrow your ship
[1:33:36] I got something for you Peter glory to
[1:33:39] God Amen said now when he left speaking
[1:33:42] he said unto Simon launch out into the
[1:33:44] deep
[1:33:46] Hallelujah don't get shallow now
[1:33:49] amen but launch out into the deep

[1:34:13] he says and have taken nothing look I
[1:34:16] tried this before I got nothing I tried
[1:34:19] that before I got nothing and then you
[1:34:21] come to church and God will say do this
[1:34:23] and now you got to watch it because
[1:34:25] because if you don't believe that it's
[1:34:26] God you you sit there and you reason
[1:34:28] like Peter look I don't tried that
[1:34:30] before brother Jack I done did that
[1:34:32] before brother Chad and one brother Jack

[1:34:42] God
[1:34:45] look at look and say we didn't he says
[1:34:47] this we uh uh we have torn all the night
[1:34:50] and we have taken nothing

[1:34:59] nothing but nevertheless and I love the
[1:35:02] Lord I love the Lord I love the Lord
[1:35:04] even with your doubt you can't stop him
[1:35:08] from blessing you

[1:35:12] your doubt can't stop God's blessings
[1:35:16] you trying to help him out and all that
[1:35:19] that that don't work
[1:35:21] Hallelujah believe it's prophets and

[1:35:40] says and and when they had when they had
[1:35:42] this done

[1:35:50] multitude of fishes and their net break

[1:37:20] this then closed a great multitude of
[1:37:24] fishes and their net break and they
[1:37:27] beckoned them to their Partners which
[1:37:28] were in the other ship that they should
[1:37:30] come and help them and they came and
[1:37:33] feel both the ships
[1:37:36] so much fish
[1:37:38] that it filled both the ships and not
[1:37:41] only that
[1:37:43] so that they begin
[1:37:45] to sink
[1:37:48] can I tell you something we all don't
[1:37:50] have problems and sometimes I like to
[1:37:53] classify like this there are some good
[1:37:55] problems to have
[1:37:59] I want my boat to sink
[1:38:01] with fish
[1:38:07] I went from not having nothing on my
[1:38:10] boat sinking
[1:38:18] but believe His prophets now if he would
[1:38:20] have kept arguing with the prophet he
[1:38:22] wouldn't have got this blessing but when
[1:38:25] he believed the prophet he prospered
[1:38:33] when Simon Peter saw it he fell down and
[1:38:36] Jesus knees saying depart from me I'm a
[1:38:38] for I'm a a a a sinful Man O Lord now
[1:38:42] Peter still don't even know how to pray
[1:38:45] this man just got on your boat and your
[1:38:47] boat sank and you accidentally leave no
[1:38:49] no stay

[1:38:59] and all that were with him at the
[1:39:01] drought of the fishes was he had taken
[1:39:04] all right let me leave that let me just

[1:41:24] Second uh Chronicles 20.
[1:41:28] they were told
[1:41:32] to believe the prophets and they would

[1:41:52] our mind and with them other beside the
[1:41:55] Omni ammonites

[1:42:01] Then There came some that told Joshua
[1:42:03] saying there cometh a great multitude
[1:42:05] against thee from Beyond the Sea on this
[1:42:07] side Syria and behold they being
[1:42:11] haza santamar which is in Getty and

[1:45:09] I just wanted to say that verse 4 says
[1:45:11] and Judah gathered themselves together
[1:45:13] to ask help of the Lord
[1:45:16] even out of all the cities of Judah that
[1:45:19] came to seek the Lord and and Jehovah
[1:45:22] stood in the congregation of Jude and
[1:45:24] Jerusalem in the house the Lord before
[1:45:26] the new court
[1:45:28] and said oh Lord God
[1:45:31] of our fathers
[1:45:33] art not thou God in heaven and rule is
[1:45:36] not thou over
[1:45:38] all the kingdoms now these are his
[1:45:40] enemies he talked about but he said God
[1:45:42] you're still in control of my enemies
[1:45:44] amen he says the rule of not thou over
[1:45:47] all the kingdoms of the Heathen and in
[1:45:50] thine hand is there not power and might
[1:45:53] so that none is able to withstand thee
[1:45:56] look at it now and it goes on in verse 7
[1:45:59] says art not thou our God
[1:46:04] who this drive out the inhabitants of
[1:46:07] this land before thy People Israel and
[1:46:10] gave it to the Seed of Abraham thy
[1:46:13] friend forever now look at what what
[1:46:16] he's doing as he's praying you can see
[1:46:18] he is reminding god of the things God
[1:46:22] has already done God you promised us
[1:46:24] this land we dwelling in our land and
[1:46:28] here come the enemy trying to take us
[1:46:29] from our land God we can't fight this
[1:46:32] battle but you can
[1:46:34] Hallelujah watch it now he goes on a
[1:46:36] little further says and they dwelt
[1:46:38] therein and have built their Sanctuary
[1:46:41] therein for thy name saying if when evil
[1:46:45] cometh upon us as the sword judgment or
[1:46:49] pestless or famine we stand before this
[1:46:52] house this is another reminder of what
[1:46:55] God had told him because he is actually
[1:46:57] quoting Solomon's Prayer
[1:47:01] my God you got to remind god of what he
[1:47:04] already promised you amen hallelujah and
[1:47:08] when you're reminding god of what he
[1:47:09] promised you the devil got nothing he
[1:47:11] can do then
[1:47:12] you stand on God's words do you believe
[1:47:15] it's Prophet prophets and you're going
[1:47:16] to prosper watch this he says uh if Will
[1:47:19] evil cometh upon us as a sword of
[1:47:22] judgment or pestilence or famine we
[1:47:24] stand before this house and in thy
[1:47:26] presence for thy name is in this house
[1:47:29] glory to God and cry unto thy unto thee
[1:47:33] in our fiction then thou will hear and
[1:47:38] amen singing We Serve a God they're not
[1:47:41] just hears but a god that is also able
[1:47:45] to help
[1:47:47] I thank God for the God that I serve
[1:47:49] yes it says it now behold the children
[1:47:52] of our mind and Moab and mount Sierra
[1:47:55] are whom thou with us not let Israel
[1:47:57] invade when they came out of the land of
[1:47:59] Egypt but they turned from them and
[1:48:02] destroyed them not behold I say how they
[1:48:06] reward us to come to cast us out of our
[1:48:08] possession which thou has given to given
[1:48:10] us to inherit look at it now he says uh
[1:48:15] uh uh oh oh our god without not judge
[1:48:19] them for we have no might against this
[1:48:22] great company that cometh against us
[1:48:24] neither know we what to do but our eyes
[1:48:27] are upon thee sometimes you go through
[1:48:30] things in your life and you have no idea
[1:48:33] what the answer is
[1:48:34] you have to sit there and just you know
[1:48:36] just wait on the Lord and I want I just
[1:48:38] want to uh throw this out in verse 13 go
[1:48:41] to the next verse it says in all Judah
[1:48:43] stood before the Lord with their little
[1:48:45] ones their wives and their children so
[1:48:46] what I want to get you to understand he
[1:48:48] prays and when he realized that lord I
[1:48:52] can't do nothing about this this great
[1:48:54] arm is coming against us and God I can't
[1:48:56] I can't me myself I can't handle it but
[1:48:58] I know you can so I'm bringing it to you
[1:49:00] and when after he makes his prayer the
[1:49:02] other thing he does is just just wait
[1:49:04] the Bible say they stood before the Lord
[1:49:07] with their little ones their wives and
[1:49:08] they just stood there
[1:49:10] Hallelujah
[1:49:13] God knows you're waiting on them
[1:49:16] and God got a word for you when you're
[1:49:18] waiting
[1:49:19] now look let me tell you something you
[1:49:21] can't be waiting and scheming

[1:49:43] glory in this God gonna get all the
[1:49:46] glory he puts you the spot where you
[1:49:48] can't do nothing but just depend on him
[1:49:50] and the Bible say Judah stood before the
[1:49:52] Lord
[1:49:53] and with their little ones and their
[1:49:56] wives and their children standing there

[1:52:07] Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on
[1:52:10] high amen and they Rose early in the
[1:52:14] morning glory to God I mean after they
[1:52:17] got the promise they just began to
[1:52:19] worship and this is something that you
[1:52:20] need to learn how to do when God give
[1:52:22] you a word he speak to your situation

[1:52:48] believe His prophets
[1:52:51] and so shall you prosper
[1:52:54] and let's see how they prospered let's
[1:52:57] just read how Jehoshaphat and the army
[1:53:00] of Israel Prosper after they believe
[1:53:02] what God spoke through this prophet
[1:53:04] look at it
[1:53:06] oh my says and when he had consulted
[1:53:09] with the people he appointed singers
[1:53:11] unto the Lord that should praise the
[1:53:14] beauty of Holiness as they went out
[1:53:15] before the Army and and uh and murder
[1:53:18] and and to say praise the Lord for his
[1:53:20] mercy and doeth forever and when they
[1:53:22] began to sing and to praise the praise
[1:53:25] the Lord set ambushments against the
[1:53:28] children amen that means God was already
[1:53:30] strategizing God was already moving God
[1:53:34] was already doing what he needed to do
[1:53:36] you know typically what that ambushment
[1:53:39] was is like like what would happen they
[1:53:41] would always uh send a few people out
[1:53:43] into the field
[1:53:44] right understanding that y'all are
[1:53:45] higher in the field they did this back
[1:53:47] in in Joshua's day y'all hide in the
[1:53:49] field and just stay stay on the cover
[1:53:51] and we're gonna run in a certain
[1:53:52] direction and then we're gonna draw them
[1:53:54] out into the field and they don't even
[1:53:56] know that y'all there and we're gonna
[1:53:57] surprise them they think they fighting
[1:53:59] just one little group of people but
[1:54:00] they're gonna be surrounded by a group
[1:54:02] of people
[1:54:03] God know how to set ambushments on your
[1:54:06] enemies
[1:54:08] God will shock them God will surprise
[1:54:10] them God will turn things around for you
[1:54:13] but you got to believe it's prophets
[1:54:15] you'll Prosper you might be running to
[1:54:18] something that's impossible for you to
[1:54:19] handle
[1:54:20] yes but believe His prophets and you'll
[1:54:23] prosper and learn how to just praise God
[1:54:25] in the midst of it
[1:54:30] hey
[1:54:31] you know the devil might take a lot of
[1:54:32] things
[1:54:34] but don't never let them take your
[1:54:35] praise
[1:54:43] my God my God my God hallelujah man
[1:54:47] y'all should have heard brother Smiley
[1:54:48] up there singing that special last week
[1:54:50] tow the church down
[1:54:53] amen but you know it's just it's just
[1:54:56] something about you know when we learn
[1:54:57] to praise God
[1:54:59] hey Hallelujah now I'm not praising
[1:55:02] because I'm always on the Mountaintop
[1:55:03] Sometimes the best praise comes from the
[1:55:06] valley
[1:55:08] that's the best praise when it's in the
[1:55:10] valley
[1:55:10] [Music]
[1:55:17] hey I'm not serving God just for my
[1:55:19] blessings
[1:55:21] hey I believe David said I will bless
[1:55:24] the Lord
[1:55:26] at all times he said his praise shall
[1:55:31] continually be in my mouth
[1:55:35] says magnify the Lord with me let us
[1:55:39] exalt his name together
[1:55:44] glory to God
[1:55:47] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:55:49] all right let me keep on reading here
[1:55:51] where am I verse 20 did I read verse 22
[1:55:54] I'll read it again when they begin to
[1:55:56] sing and to praise the Lord said in
[1:55:58] bushments against the children of Aman
[1:56:00] Moab and mount Sierra which would come
[1:56:02] against Judah and they were smitten for
[1:56:06] the children of our mind and Moab stood
[1:56:07] up against inhabitants of Mount Sierra
[1:56:10] utterly to slay and Destroy them and
[1:56:12] when they had made an end of the
[1:56:14] inhabitants of Sierra everyone helped to
[1:56:16] destroy another this means the children
[1:56:18] of Israel did not have to fight this
[1:56:21] great armor that was come they hired
[1:56:23] different nations to come we're going to
[1:56:25] go against and the Nations start
[1:56:26] fighting amongst themselves
[1:56:28] I'm gonna tell you now that that's uh
[1:56:30] that that's the way we want to see it
[1:56:32] let the Devils fight amongst themselves
[1:56:35] but don't let the devil see us fighting
[1:56:37] amongst ourselves
[1:56:40] brother random made a statement said he
[1:56:42] says uh branham's fight in the backyard
[1:56:45] [Music]
[1:56:47] not the front

[1:56:58] and sisters
[1:57:00] glory to God
[1:57:02] all right I'm still reading my God uh it
[1:57:07] says uh verse 24 when Judah came toward
[1:57:09] the Watchtower in the wilderness they
[1:57:11] looked unto the multitude and behold
[1:57:14] there were dead bodies falling to the
[1:57:15] Earth and non-escape
[1:57:17] and when Jehoshaphat and his people came
[1:57:20] to take away the spoil of them they
[1:57:22] fought they found among them in
[1:57:24] abundance both riches with the dead
[1:57:27] bodies and precious Jews which they
[1:57:30] stripped off of themselves
[1:57:31] more than they could carry away and they
[1:57:35] were three days and Gathering of spoil

[1:57:59] was just in a in a very very dire
[1:58:02] situation not like this God loves to
[1:58:05] operate

[1:58:14] disciples they caught all them fish when
[1:58:16] they least expected it
[1:58:18] amen the drought came when they were the
[1:58:21] most discouraged
[1:58:23] and when they were doubting
[1:58:25] that's when God did his best work
[1:58:29] oh you some of y'all think about giving
[1:58:31] up on your careers and giving up on your
[1:58:33] business and giving up on this that's
[1:58:34] when God want to do something best did
[1:58:36] God give you that idea

[1:59:16] couple different people
[1:59:18] one of um I did a a Google I'm sorry A
[1:59:22] message search uh where brother random
[1:59:26] use the term you believe me to be his
[1:59:28] Prophet just at that term I found 316
[1:59:32] times where he said that and there were
[1:59:35] times where he would say it and he'd
[1:59:37] kind of go back and say oh I'm sorry do
[1:59:40] you mean do you believe me to be his
[1:59:41] servant now he have to say that to
[1:59:43] unbelievers
[1:59:47] but to believer
[1:59:49] you believe me there is you believe me
[1:59:51] to be his Prophet yes I believe that you
[1:59:54] were God's prophet
[1:59:57] you were the gift that God sent to this
[1:59:59] earth
[2:00:00] and I'm going to experience my own
[2:00:02] golden age
[2:00:04] because I believe that you were his
[2:00:06] prophet
[2:00:07] amen
[2:00:09] here the one of the last times that this
[2:00:13] is recorded where he made that statement
[2:00:16] do you believe me to be his Prophet
[2:00:18] actually the last quote that I found was
[2:00:21] out of the message to choosing of a
[2:00:22] bride
[2:00:24] and I want to just read this amen
[2:00:25] because he said this to you he says you
[2:00:27] believe me to be his prophet and I say
[2:00:29] yes this the last time he's made that
[2:00:31] statement was in the message choosing of
[2:00:33] a bride it says this is a solemn warning
[2:00:37] says we don't know what time
[2:00:39] you don't know what time that this city
[2:00:41] one day is going to be laying out here
[2:00:43] in the bottom of this ocean
[2:00:45] is old Capernaum said Jesus thou who
[2:00:49] thou who exalted into heaven will be
[2:00:51] brought down into hell for if the mighty
[2:00:54] Works had been done in Sodom and
[2:00:55] Gomorrah it had it had uh it have had
[2:00:59] been standing to this day in Sodom
[2:01:01] Gomorrah lays in the bottom of the Dead
[2:01:02] Sea and Capernaum is in the bottom of
[2:01:04] the sea now as I as I'm reading this
[2:01:07] quote my mind just kind of goes back to
[2:01:09] a little um situation I had
[2:01:12] some brothers that were telling me that
[2:01:13] you know brother Brandon made the
[2:01:15] statement says he he didn't tell the
[2:01:16] truth he says Capernaum is not in the
[2:01:18] bottom of the sea he says brother random
[2:01:20] is not a prophet because capernaum's not
[2:01:22] in the bottom CSA I say I said brother
[2:01:23] are you sure about that you sure so yeah
[2:01:26] I looked it up it's not in the bottom of
[2:01:28] the sea I said okay give me just a day
[2:01:31] or so I'll get back to you so when I
[2:01:33] went and found the scripture where Jesus
[2:01:35] himself
[2:01:37] spoke that Capernaum would be in the sea
[2:01:40] I first did the research and said now I
[2:01:43] know Jesus spoke it I say Jesus spoke
[2:01:45] and then I got to find where it was
[2:01:46] manifested so I went and did all the
[2:01:48] history I did I found found exactly
[2:01:50] where manifested now I didn't tell him
[2:01:53] where it was manifested all I gave him
[2:01:56] was the scripture
[2:01:58] I said now you say brother Brandon said
[2:02:00] that this was supposed to happen and it
[2:02:03] didn't happen I said now look at this
[2:02:06] scripture and do some research on it
[2:02:09] and when he uh he got back to me says
[2:02:11] good point no I'm not trying to make a
[2:02:14] good point
[2:02:16] that's not my objective for making a
[2:02:18] good point I just prove to you that if
[2:02:20] you're gonna say brother Brandon was a
[2:02:22] liar with this quote then you also are
[2:02:25] saying Jesus is a liar
[2:02:28] and I'm trying to get you to see that's
[2:02:30] the bad spirit that is on you
[2:02:33] amen and you need to be delivered from
[2:02:35] that Spirit I'm not trying to make good
[2:02:36] points I'm trying to bring Deliverance
[2:02:39] the Bible say you'll know the truth and
[2:02:41] the truth will make you free
[2:02:45] so here he's using this term you know
[2:02:48] you believe me to be his Prophet now
[2:02:50] he's prophesying about Los Angeles all
[2:02:53] right and it says Thou City who claims
[2:02:54] to be the City of Angels
[2:02:56] who is exalted yourself into heaven
[2:03:00] and send all the dirty filthy things of
[2:03:04] Fashions and things to even the foreign
[2:03:07] country some here to pick up our filth
[2:03:09] and send it away to your your fine
[2:03:11] churches and Steeples and so forth the
[2:03:13] way you do remember one day you'll be
[2:03:15] laying in the bottom of the sea amen he
[2:03:18] says your great honeycomb under you
[2:03:20] right now the wrath of God is belching
[2:03:22] right beneath you how much longer he
[2:03:25] will hold this Sandbar hanging out over
[2:03:27] that when that ocean out yonder a mile
[2:03:30] deep will slide in there Plumb back to
[2:03:32] the Salton Sea it would be worse than
[2:03:35] the last day of Pompeii repent Los
[2:03:37] Angeles repent the rest of you and turn
[2:03:40] to God the hour of his wrath is upon the
[2:03:41] Earth flee while there's time to flee
[2:03:44] and come into Christ let us pray says my
[2:03:47] brother sister I don't know what more to
[2:03:48] say if I found Grace in your sight by
[2:03:50] the power of God if you believe me to be
[2:03:53] his prophet
[2:03:55] he said this is the first time in public
[2:03:58] I've ever said that
[2:04:01] he says but I feel a strange warning of
[2:04:03] some sort I'm not prone to this you know
[2:04:05] I'm not I don't act like this I
[2:04:08] hesitated to speak that message and say
[2:04:10] those things I run sideways and
[2:04:12] everything else to keep from doing it
[2:04:14] but it's been said and it'll stand at
[2:04:16] the day of the Judgment as a witness
[2:04:18] that I've told the truth that thus saith
[2:04:21] the Lord God oh Pentecost run for your
[2:04:23] life lead to the horns of the Altar and
[2:04:25] cry out before it's too late for an hour
[2:04:27] will come when you can cry and it'll do
[2:04:30] no good for Esau sought to find a place
[2:04:33] of his Birthright and couldn't find it I
[2:04:35] commit you oh California oh Convention
[2:04:38] of the Full Gospel businessman who I
[2:04:40] love who I've who I've left and strung
[2:04:42] to with all my heart I commit you uh I
[2:04:46] commit you to Jesus Christ tonight flee
[2:04:48] to him don't let the devil ever cool you
[2:04:50] off from it from this stay right with it
[2:04:53] until you're everyone filled with the
[2:04:55] Holy Ghost in so much that will make you
[2:04:57] come to this word that will make you
[2:04:59] women straighten up that will make you
[2:05:02] men straighten up if you say you got the
[2:05:04] Holy Ghost and won't cope with the word
[2:05:06] it's another Spirit In You
[2:05:08] God's spirit is on his word the
[2:05:12] Messianic uh the anointed word the bride
[2:05:15] must be Messiah the anointed word
[2:05:19] you know as brother Brandon was you know
[2:05:22] making this and like I said the very
[2:05:23] last time that he uses these words
[2:05:26] you believe me to be his Prophet like he
[2:05:28] said he says he really never really made
[2:05:30] that statement publicly if you believe
[2:05:33] me to be his prophet
[2:05:35] he says uh you know and make it in that
[2:05:37] fashion
[2:05:39] um we've seen Justin brother Randall's
[2:05:41] Ministry
[2:05:42] he prophesied about
[2:05:44] America and where we would be he
[2:05:46] prophesied about a a a a a a a woman
[2:05:50] vice president or president
[2:05:53] and it has already manifested itself we
[2:05:55] are living in the day where we see it
[2:05:57] manifested and I am so shocked that all
[2:06:00] these people that heard that prophecy
[2:06:02] and knew it
[2:06:03] but too much pride to acknowledge that
[2:06:07] God's Prophet was right
[2:06:08] to drop all these funny ideas
[2:06:12] drop all these funny ideas and and
[2:06:14] because and just repent say Lord I was
[2:06:16] wrong this message is right God you sent
[2:06:18] you I'ma just accept what this Prophet
[2:06:20] is saying
[2:06:22] I'm surprised that people just weren't
[2:06:23] able to do that it's a spirit that's on
[2:06:25] the people that does that and I'm gonna
[2:06:26] tell you something else if we sing
[2:06:30] the vice president be a woman and like I
[2:06:32] say you know this is stuff that was pre
[2:06:34] 80s prophesied 87 years ago so when it
[2:06:37] happened it was not a surprise to me
[2:06:40] I also know that Los Angeles is going
[2:06:42] under
[2:06:45] and it won't be a surprise to me I mean
[2:06:48] I mean scientists may say anything that
[2:06:50] they want to say and and I mean the the
[2:06:52] they they see things that happen over
[2:06:54] there they know something they don't
[2:06:56] even know when but we know according to
[2:06:58] a prophecy that is going to happen
[2:07:01] and brother Adam said it'll be you know
[2:07:03] we ain't seen nothing yet we ain't seen
[2:07:06] disaster yet I mean just what they went
[2:07:08] through on the west coast of Florida
[2:07:09] here that was pretty bad that was really
[2:07:11] people's businesses people's homes swept
[2:07:13] away just like that and with a storm
[2:07:16] that came out of nowhere
[2:07:21] what what the prophet spoke about Los
[2:07:23] Angeles it's going down
[2:07:25] a prophet is spoken I believe it
[2:07:29] amen and what what I'm doing is living
[2:07:32] right I want to be ready because I know
[2:07:34] that as this destruction comes God has a
[2:07:36] Rapture awaiting his bride
[2:07:38] [Music]
[2:07:40] amen
[2:07:41] I believe is prophet and the greatest
[2:07:43] way I can prosper is to catch this
[2:07:46] rapture
[2:07:48] wrapped in faith is in these books and
[2:07:50] these tapes amen so I'm gonna stay I'm
[2:07:53] staying with it
[2:07:55] amen I'm planted not potted
[2:08:01] praise the Lord God bless you Church
[2:08:06] there's a gentleman I I
[2:08:10] um
[2:08:11] I'm gonna just read this last quote and
[2:08:13] I'm gonna let you I'm Gonna Let You Go
[2:08:14] this this is how to does God ever change
[2:08:16] his mind about his word
[2:08:19] um
[2:08:19] this is the brother
[2:08:21] you know people you know you get
[2:08:23] Blessings by by just believing and we
[2:08:26] didn't have the opportunity to to live
[2:08:28] in the day that brother Brandon was here
[2:08:29] but there were people that lived during
[2:08:30] that time and they received some mighty
[2:08:31] blessings but they had the right
[2:08:33] attitude towards God's profit look at
[2:08:36] this man
[2:08:37] and I'm gonna say this before I read
[2:08:39] this
[2:08:41] we we were Prosper because we believe
[2:08:45] we're going to prosper physically
[2:08:48] we're going to prosper spiritually we're
[2:08:50] going to prosper emotionally
[2:08:52] we're going to prosper mentally we're
[2:08:55] going to prosper financially
[2:08:57] we're going to prosper because we
[2:08:59] believe
[2:09:01] hearing this message that God does God
[2:09:03] ever change his mind about his word look
[2:09:04] at this uh this brother Earl Martin says
[2:09:07] brother Brandon would you lay hands on
[2:09:08] me ordain me to work as a pastor
[2:09:11] he says John Martin says Earl says how
[2:09:14] many knows Earl Martin
[2:09:16] says how many believe him to be a
[2:09:18] servant of Christ he comes to us
[2:09:20] I believe the the originally from a
[2:09:22] Pentecostal group and now I think he
[2:09:25] passes and does an independent work
[2:09:27] I've known Earl to be a real servant of
[2:09:30] Christ I'll never forget one act many
[2:09:32] has been but one act with Earl I
[2:09:34] remember one night they called him when
[2:09:36] I was in Dallas Texas but I believe you
[2:09:39] know a sister says Beaumont Beaumont
[2:09:41] Texas is right sister and they said his
[2:09:43] baby was laying dying and they thought
[2:09:46] it was already dead it wasn't breathing
[2:09:49] no more and Earl made his way around to
[2:09:52] my room
[2:09:54] as a daddy bending shoulders stoop down
[2:09:57] before me as I was in bed hear the
[2:10:00] prophet laying in bed
[2:10:02] rolled out
[2:10:04] he put his arms around me and said
[2:10:06] brother
[2:10:08] I believe
[2:10:10] you are God's Pride
[2:10:13] I've always believed that
[2:10:15] says if you'll just say the word
[2:10:18] though my baby is dead
[2:10:21] yet shall it live
[2:10:25] and his baby
[2:10:27] come back to life
[2:10:29] is living
[2:10:31] I believe is Prophets
[2:10:34] you'll prosper
[2:10:36] can I put it this way believe it's
[2:10:38] prophets even your family
[2:10:42] will prosper
[2:10:52] let's pray
[2:10:56] father we thank you
[2:11:00] for your word Jesus
[2:11:04] thank you Lord that we can look at
[2:11:06] scripture that's at a little different
[2:11:07] light
[2:11:10] to housefat in the
[2:11:12] and the Army surrounded not knowing what
[2:11:16] to do but they were waiting and
[2:11:18] depending on you and they began to
[2:11:19] praise you and thank you
[2:11:21] the prophecy went forth
[2:11:25] this battle
[2:11:27] is not yours but is the Lord's
[2:11:30] all you need to do is show up for the
[2:11:32] battle
[2:11:33] and God they the the prophecy did not
[2:11:35] tell them that they would be three days
[2:11:37] and gaining the spoils that were there
[2:11:42] that's how they Prosper because they
[2:11:44] believed and Lord just even showing how
[2:11:46] Earl Martin prospered not only him but
[2:11:48] his son that was dead came back alive
[2:11:53] Lord the word was spoken in Beaumont
[2:11:55] Texas his son not even being there but
[2:11:57] the word was spoken and God the young
[2:12:00] man came back alive because his father
[2:12:02] believed
[2:12:04] Lord we stand on these same promises
[2:12:08] uh the prophet's not here for us but we
[2:12:10] still believe that he was the prophet
[2:12:13] that you sent this gift that you sent to
[2:12:16] this age
[2:12:18] and God it becomes a golden age for us
[2:12:20] if we could just accept it and walk in
[2:12:23] it those that believed in in times past
[2:12:26] and God the days of Noah they believe
[2:12:30] days of Moses they believe those that

[2:17:52] [Music]
[2:17:54] my God
[2:17:57] sometimes you realize that for
[2:18:00] generations and generations since the
[2:18:03] death of the Lord Jesus and the Bible
[2:18:04] has been written it's been written over
[2:18:07] and over there's all kind of Bibles now
[2:18:09] but everybody has a Bible and they're
[2:18:13] religious
[2:18:14] but we don't only have the Bible we have
[2:18:17] the voice of the seventh angel
[2:18:19] we have a prophet so there's no reason
[2:18:23] for us not to prosper in every aspect of
[2:18:27] Our Lives
[2:18:28] praise the Lord I tell the young people
[2:18:31] all the time you can search the
[2:18:32] scripture there's not one promise in the
[2:18:35] Bible of us to have poverty
[2:18:39] it's always prosperity
[2:18:43] and sometimes Prosperity becomes a bad
[2:18:46] word to people because they think it's
[2:18:48] always riches
[2:18:50] people that's not serving God he'll send
[2:18:52] leanness to their soul but he didn't
[2:18:54] promise that for us
[2:18:56] amen he has already provided the
[2:18:58] character to handle
[2:19:01] Prosperity through the trials that we
[2:19:04] have gone through so take your limits
[2:19:06] off God
[2:19:08] emotionally
[2:19:10] physically financially
[2:19:13] your spiritual walk
[2:19:15] there's no limits to a believer
[2:19:19] you have the power within you now to
[2:19:21] create a world out there and go and live
[2:19:23] on it
[2:19:24] foreign
[2:19:25] [Music]
[2:19:31] brother Billy Paul used to always make a
[2:19:33] statement God thought it the prophet
[2:19:36] said it that settles it and I believe
[2:19:40] amen do you believe it amen amen let's
[2:19:45] bow our hearts
[2:19:47] almighty God
[2:19:49] father we thank you for every promise of
[2:19:52] God Lord that you have written in your
[2:19:55] Holy Bible for us Lord
[2:19:57] Lord and we believe it
[2:20:00] father we refuse to doubt you anymore
[2:20:04] Lord God we refuse to reason with your
[2:20:06] word anymore
[2:20:07] father you have brought your word to us
[2:20:10] this morning Lord we believe it with all
[2:20:12] of our hearts we thank you for our
[2:20:15] pastor Lord God getting himself out of
[2:20:17] the way thank you for speaking to him

[2:20:22] this message Lord God father We Believe
[2:20:25] father thank you for sending us a
[2:20:27] prophet Lord God while the world is
[2:20:30] looking at a sealed book lord you tore
[2:20:32] back the seals Lord and you got on a
[2:20:34] personal level and spoken to each one of
[2:20:37] us Lord you called us from all walks of
[2:20:40] life that we may sojourn together Lord
[2:20:42] before going home so father I pray Lord
[2:20:45] God as you have blessed us with your
[2:20:47] presence and with your word today that
[2:20:49] you'll continue to abide with us and as
[2:20:51] we meditate on your truth Lord God may
[2:20:54] you bless it to our hearts Lord and may
[2:20:57] it continue to transform Our Lives into
[2:20:59] the image of the Sons and Daughters of
[2:21:01] God that you said that we are and Lord
[2:21:04] we intend to manifest your your word it
[2:21:08] shall not return to you Lord we are the
[2:21:10] sons and daughters of God so I pray as
[2:21:13] we prepare to leave this place for not
