they short people sitting over yonder I like to never made it out of there hallelujah Amen god bless you tonight amen so thank the Lord for His mercy they man let's get right into the word of the Lord amen I want to speak to you tonight the Lord helping us upon overcoming Goliath overcoming Goliath First Samuel chapter 17 verse 4 4 Samuel 17 verse 4 and we read verse 4 and then verse 23 where is the Lord should appreciate brother Jack and church body lines come by one more time I was looking back there he had a little notes from different brothers another jeweler the Andrew and different ones and I said well brother cliff farmer differ ones I said you've had some really great men of God come by here I serve few little and small and then as a friend of mine told me brother Bend you ain't never felt a little and small nowhere you win hey amen but amen I I certainly don't feel worthy to share the pulpit with such great men of God but we appreciate y'all allowing us come by we've had a good time already amen amen 1st Samuel 17 verse 4 and there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of Gath whose height was six cubits in the span verse 23 and as he talked with them behold there came up the champion the Philistine of gafe goliath by name and now the armies of the Philistines spake according to the same words now watch closely and David heard them it's one thing for the devil to brag in the ears of those that are cowards but in the ears of a man who is truly an overcomer that's the wrong thing to say to anytime they defy our God there's going to be somebody somebody that's going to be willing to stand up for what's right amen it may not be a few a number that's willing to stand up for what's truth but us is the elect of God before we go out of here in this world I believe we're going to have the ability to stand for what's right even brother Branham taught us like this he said in the last day he said we could be able to discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit within the framework of the Christian Church and I believe we're living in that hour of being able to stand for what's right look around us tonight we should be busted out the walls and build and bigger but where are they they're cowards running from the service of the Lord amen like like a little boy will go into a graveyard whistling trying to pretend like he ain't scared they know this whole world's coming to an end but they don't have the courage to withstand in this evil day thank God for those of you here tonight that's got courage to stand on this last day takes real courage amen let's just pray together over the word amen as we ask the Lord to help us tonight I wonder if you just have a need on your heart you'd like to be remembered just by the lifting of your hand if you don't mind amen mine's up with you god bless you each one father we we come before your place tonight Lord God this holy sanctuary where you dwell and all of the great bright lights of glory surrounded by angels of God Lord it's such a beautiful thought compared to what we deal with down here and lady osya thank you for a place of refuge we can hide in a place of sanctity Lord a place of safety so father's we come before thy throne boldly tonight the throne of grace of Mercy we pray that you'd help us give us the ability Lord Jesus to say only that which you'd be pleased with strengthen us give us your favor in the word Lord that as we begin to break the bread of life that it won't be just a man breaking words to the people but it would be you taking your word and making it live to us you see the little thought laying before me tonight Lord and God I can read them the quotes read in the scriptures but Lord it takes you to bring the context I'm praying you'll do that tonight and then for every uplifted hand I pray the Holy Spirit will just move on each one of them Lord that are sitting here tonight with great needs in their heart and lives may the Holy Spirit I pray bless them each one now God as you see the requests down underneath that hand that you'll meet that need Lord in the name of Jesus Christ as we commit the service now both speaker and listener in Jesus name Amen god bless you you may be seated all the saints said amen amen good to be a mint in the house of the Lord one more time let me say how good it is to be here glad you're here a man I would be able to preach nobody if y'all didn't show up Amen I'm glad you're here a man and it is um it is a difficult hour that we're living in a time of trouble like we've never seen and I recall and remember the words of brother Branham when he was speaking about the rapture he pulls his thought from the Book of Psalms where he said in the time of trouble that he would hide us the elect of God and his pavilion in his secret place for each of us there is a refuge there's something that we all can run into that will make us safe from the world as we know him as I told people many times I may be in a lady Ossian age I may live in a lady Essene body I may rub shoulders elidio sins but as a Christian I'm not a lady of sin I'm a member of God's body a member of God's bride and by God's grace we're moving forward into a deeper revelation of who we are where we came from and where we're going and this is a time like we've never seen trouble is every where we look and even when when people seem like they're safety all around they find a reason to make trouble with that people aren't satisfied anymore with nothing seem like when it comes to life in general the most miserable people that you've ever seen somebody wins the lottery they say enjoy it while it lasts you'll probably be broke tomorrow Sun comes out today why they they they say well glory to God the sun's out but it'll probably raining in four hours it didn't seem like they're happy with anything man's heart is so unsatisfied with where is that but for you and I there should be something inside of us hallelujah of the glory of God that rings in our heart on a daily basis that I am a Christian and I have a place of refuge that I can myself in and I don't have to worry about the storms growing around me I don't have to worry about what's going on and in different parts of the world I can hide myself in Jesus Christ and there I can find my solace I can find of inner sanctum that I can hide from all the things of the world we realize that being a Christian is a battle and being in a Christian battle it's one of the hardest and greatest battles that a man a woman will ever fight the Battle of a mind rather than a psychologist in the world to help you explain it all they've tried to take all the great fine instruments and all of their understanding and their knowledge about life in the human brain and the human psyche and they still can't figure out why people are going crazy by the bucket pools they still can't find the medicine as it was to regulate the human mind in the human spirit why because man was made in such a manner to be after God and made in a way that he is a creator that he is a conqueror Adam was placed upon this earth to rule and govern over the earth man and his fallen condition it it does something to his human spirit when he cannot control that fallen condition when he when he loses him and he loses battles it affects him in a way that sometimes they never recover but that is the part of overcoming that we all must recognize is the most significant because in every Christian life there's two attributes that come with a Christian walk wins and losses now let me read the other message how can I overcome now just listen the way brother Brandon says this I love the way that he puts this paragraph 105 he says overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks lots of people say there is no devil it's just a thought don't you never believe that there is a real devil and he's just as real as you are or anybody else is he's a real devil and you must recognize him real and you must know that he is a devil now let me just stop there for just a moment let me bring something to your attention because I think here is where we tend to trail off the path a little bit because what we don't realize is that this being called Satan this this creature that was once an angel in heaven once the right hand man to God to fellowship I don't think we recognize that this devil this being this creature is actually putting together meetings down inhale and holding meetings about you and sending out imps to your house and to your job and to other places around that's you that you have an influence at that is having meetings about you because the devil looks at you as a potential threat to the entire overthrow of his kingdom now if we can recognize that everything that goes on in our life there's not happen by chance my friends listen to me carefully everything that goes on in this life there's a reason and a purpose behind it that promotion you got there was a reason when you lost your job there was a reason that sickness in your body there was a reason everything has a purpose everything has a reason behind it and it's up to us to recognize which spirit is behind what circumstance this is what Bill Hemmer saying he'll when he said to recognize the devil and what he is we must recognize that Satan is a tormentor and he was created in a manner to torment everything that is of God remember Satan wanted to be God he wanted to have a throne he wanted to have subjects you want to have power he want to have dominion but Jack he's done every bit of it the Bible calls him the god of this evil age don't get upset at me but there are people even around the ranks of this message that worship the devil and don't even know it come on now because they worship ignorantly those things that they don't recognize and there's where brother Bentham said real overcoming takes place when you can recognize the devil and what is all about I wonder if our eyes are wide open I look at some of these young girls and boys sitting around here tonight and I wonder are our eyes open for the coming age if the 10th the coming of the Lord tarries another 30 and 40 years you're the Church of tomorrow but are you recognizing today what's laying before you tomorrow and also legal a is going to be a despised way after a while even people around the ranks to this message we're beginning to hate the way of the Holy Ghost way and they don't want people shouting and worshipping and praising the Lord and they don't want your singing and rejoicing they want you to settle down sit there and fold your arms and take a few notes and and just learn a few things and go out the door but brother before we go out of here this true bride will be referred back to the original word let's roll on the data back on the original worship the original power the original authority that comes with the Holy Ghost filled church are we recognizing are we recognizing what's going on around us today many times in the discernment where the man would say now that's Lord Jesus if he's really who he is let's see if he is here today in one place that really strikes me but the band said it's time for us to recognize who is in our city today I wonder if we recognize who it is as amongst us as the people of God as the Spirit of God is beginning to lift up off the Gentile people and it seems like people are getting more and more cold and going away and want to get on a website little drama 'we want to hear a certain sermon in a drama way a boy or a girl or drama where some something in the world will draw but are we recognizing where are ours it has taken us to Satan is so slick he's so sly he'll allow you to come sit on a Pew and have religion it doesn't bother him if you say you're a believer this message I don't strike him at all because the devil's a believer the message you say that's nonsense no thought the Bible said he believes in one God and he trembles do you realize the devil don't even believe his own Trinitarian doctrine come on now because the Bible said he believes in one God not three persons he believes in one that's right he is a believer the devil is as religious as anybody can be religious we have to recognize that religion alone it will put us in religion ain't going to make us ready for the rapture we got to have more than that we got to have an old-fashioned Holy Ghost experience Amen one that takes away all of the desires of the world out of your heart and makes a real son and daughter out of you we needed we need it as I said there tonight it brother Willis we're getting to the place around the range this message where people want to say Holy Spirit and they kind of kind of tighten the tie up and straighten their coat Holy Spirit they're afraid to say Holy Ghost because Holy Ghost sounds like a wild man come on some company a man it sound like a wild peg out yonder they want to say Holy Spirit and they want to sip their water with their pinky out and they want to be they want to be cultural they want to be intellectual amen but the only bride that's going on here is a bride that is baptized with pyre and baptized with the Holy Ghost and has the power of Jesus Christ on the inside of her soul not just a reformed person a restored person Reformation is one thing but we need restoration amen we need to be redeemed back to the things of God every one of us sitting in this room tonight we can have an old-fashioned experience with Jesus Christ amen gifts could fall in here powers of God could fall in here the anointing could fall in here visions and signs and wonders and I even believe tonight even tonight I believe God will confirm his word with a supernatural movement of the Holy Spirit amen we didn't come for a protracted meeting just a set on the Pew and here a few good scriptures and go home but we came here to meet God and to look out deeper than we've ever walked out before a man who said you must recognize him real Oh is their brother being there ain't no way the devil's hold meetings about me yes we are a threat in this last day whoo come on preach seminar we're a threat I know you don't see that in yourself but you are do you realize just sitting in this church tonight being identified with this truth you're a threat because there's enough power laying in the Bible in the revelation of the hour to make you a press because he knows that what lays in the truth that the truth will set you free and whom the Sun sets free is what free indeed there ain't no way in the world that you could associate around this message and the cover not be pulled off who the devil really is all you have to do is listen to one message from the prophet of God and that one message he exposes every imp and everything that's around you it's a whole lot more and you get the Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Church of God they read out of some old Creed broker they try to tell you about how to be a better neighbor and how to be a better person but let me tell you you won't get to the rapture by being a good person there'll be plenty of good people in Hell goodness don't make them the Spirit of God what makes you what you are you got to recognize that and if you can recognize that God Himself is trying to fill your heart with the baptism of the Holy Ghost God Himself are you listening to me tonight God wants to fill your heart with the power of himself he wants to fail your soul with a little speck of God inside of you but it's hard for us to recognize that because we make so many mistakes ah that's what I want to preach on tonight wins and losses it's what makes a real overcomer because you see the real overcomer ain't the guy that wins all the time we'll come on now I think I read on a statistic one time Michael Jordan's will he you know he was shooting the ball and doing free throws and three-pointers all them practices he said I'll I said I missed the goal a whole lot more than ever made it but losing sometimes what's makes you a winner come on out amen I love what Edison said I think it was Edison too many the light bulb it was Edison one he said it was a thousand in one ways he was making light bulbs and he failed a thousand time on a thousand and one he made a light bulb and they said you failed a thousand times and said no I didn't he said I found a thousand ways how not to make a light bulb amen it's all in the way you approach it it's whether he recognized that's why I wanted overnight spirit and truth tabernacle are you recognizing what's among you tonight it's God's brightest God's Word it's his power if it's his authority is everything he is right here on this church tonight if we can just get a hold of it faith will declared faith will bring it to us but we've got to recognize it's here if you come in the back doors of this church and the only thing you recognize as a man in the pulpit a woman on the pen and a man on the drums or a guy back there at the camera ever what it might be if all you see is flesh that's all you get out of it amen that's the reason why people come the church is too hot the church is too cold the preacher look right at me when he said that will tell me where I'm supposed to look when I preach come on somebody I could look at that that that screen up here maybe I should preach to the piano come on piano gets saved it can't get to say you can so I figure I'll look at you because you're the ones that can get saved and then an organ tankard say the Panda can't get say but you can but he looked right at me when he said that what is it it's carnality it's not recognizing what's in your city right now what's sitting here amongst us tonight that presence is you feel when certain things are saying in certain words are said that anointing that comes over that sweet warm feeling that comes over you what is that that's a Holy Ghost that's Jesus in the form of a pillar of fire sweeping over the congregation amen you say how did that preacher know them things about my life somebody must have told it no you know you had a recognized recognize what's standing in the platform what's coming across the platform what's coming through the singing what's coming through the music what's come into reading your Bible how did he know I read that scripture this week you got to recognize come on somebody you got to recognize what's going on around you if you don't recognize that you'll miss it a hundred times over and you got to recognize the devil the same way you got to recognize that if Christ is here tonight so is the devil to discourage you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and if he can hear to scourge every one of us out of the promise of God he wants to because you're a threat you're a prick and he knows you're a threat so he's having meetings down in hell or it might be not the literal devil himself but he's delegating and whatever whatever demons have been dispatched to your front door or to your home I guarantee they're having meetings about how to get you the prophet of God said he studies your life to see how you fight how you live how you act how you walk how you talk he wants to know what kind of man that you are what kind of woman the cha what are you weak to what are you strong to they're having meetings down inhale about you trying to figure out a way to get you in their grip and get you in their class but oh my that's all we got a record I seem to be a real devil we got to recognize him to be true and to be against you now watch this but man goes on to say at the same time that you recognize him you know that he is a devil and he is against you then to overcome him now here's the key event you must recognize event that God in you is greater and mightier than he is Oh because if you don't recognize him and you how can you defeat the devil if you can't recognize Christ is in your heart how can you be a true overcomer you must recognize God in you that is the hope of glory in it and now what the Bible said the real Christian would be to be Christ in you which is the hope of glory that's the only hope I've got amen I can't trust in the Republican Party I can't trust in the Democratic Party there's no one that I can trust there's not a preacher there's on a church there's not a mama there's not again there ain't nobody I can trust but God in me is who I can have confidence in there's no such thing as the perfect church is the perfect God in it that's the confidence I got I have a hard time trusting church people after you get burned so many times you realize they pack pretty hard tires but I do trust God and his people I do trust that the Holy Ghost promised he'd have a bride without spot without wrinkle will hallelujah somebody it doesn't matter you said this one doesn't matter what they're doing calling you it's greater than that in the world you must recognize God and use greater and mightier than he is the one that is in you has already overcome him someone said I'm waiting on my deliverance to comments over to come you've already been delivered you see this cross we pack up here in the corner of our churches it represents a symbol of overcoming what Jesus did when he died at Calvary it's finished right there it's not like a thing I read today from a bunch of fanatical brand amides who worship brother Branham they said what the cross could not finish brother Brennan came to complete that work that the cross couldn't finish I said that's blasphemy against oligos because my Lord Jesus said it finish ah his violence over with I'm not writing on somebody to come bring deliverance it's already been done it's already been completed how can I look for something that's already been done I said Lord of God one of these days if I get to praying and reading and listen to so many tapes and if I can get to where I can pay tithes every week Alleluia and not get matted to Walmart lady and not I'll be an overcomer glory to God you can do every bit of that and still not be an overcomer because being an overcomer means you must recognize God as in you and if you recognize Christ is in you that's the hope that's the overcoming now watch prevent says there it is he said by His grace you're more than a match for him it's that there's real overcoming when you recognize a certain approach Samuel chapter 4 now verse 2 now with that said now how is it then as a child of God the most difficult part of being a child of God or being a Christian and serving the Lord if everything we did for him was perfect and never made a mistake and never had a problem we wouldn't have a lot of discouragement would we if everything I made and everything I said and everything that I put together it was just perfect everything just fell just exactly I'd have all the confidence in the world seemingly if every time I preached I never missed scriptures or if I maybe stumbled over certain words if every time I saw it in his siren ode or hit a long note on the piano I feel like boy I've got the world by the tail and really is the child of God that's the thing I think discourages is the most is that we feel like because we have losses that were not really overcomers but a part of your Christian life and a part of your Christian walking you might as well get used to it because it's going to be this way to the day you die or the day you're changed out of here one or the other you're going to have winds you're gonna have losses you might as well get used to because it's going to happen if you like to cook sometimes you're going to burn it hello somebody hey if you didn't matter what you do somewhere you're going to mess up somewhere wins and losses now let's go to the hill now and let's get a picture on mind of Goliath now we see Goliath come we know the Bible says about nine foot tall somewhere around there's a big guy but what kind of made me stop and think I thought he is a big dude but why didn't Israel just put it together in their brain we're going to get 10 of our biggest and we're going to ambush him and when he ain't lifting all 10 of us big boys are going to take him down why didn't they just why didn't they just flip the script as they say to the world and turn it around on old Goliath and the Philistines there was a reason why these people were scared you got one man making a threat come have a man coming with me and we'll serve you and if he doesn't win it's vice versa you'll serve us well service that would have been somebody in that army to come up and say hey I'm a child of God I'm God's servant and I've take him on they should have been lining up to fight this Philistine but there was a reason they were scared y'all ready I just couldn't give you the punchline now wins and losses all right get ready now we're going to go through eternity in the Bible First Samuel chapter 4 verse 2 now let's look this is one of the first confrontations that this group of Israelites has with with the Philistines one of the first and this is one of the most impactful parts to their walk in their journey in this whole thing and the Philistines put themself in array against Israel and when they join battle Israel is victorious before the Philistines huh I heard a lot of us no way preacher what the Bible say they were smitten before the Philistines not know Amen these are prophet quoting people right same people that can stand and quote glory to God every place that the I put heads upon I got to give me that place in victory their profit creating people they can appoint into every place Moses said this ain't supposed to happen now what are you going to do now you've got profit quoting people that's lost a battle hello now come on bridge with me they've lost one of the big battles against the Philistines not only are they smitten but watch how the Bible is is out and when they join battle is really split before the Philistines and they slew the army in the fear of that four thousand men now you imagine you live with these people you work with these people go to church of these people so after the first major loss you go back to church and you realize hey who's going to lead singing around here Oh John got killed last week by the Philistines we got to find us anybody in the church know any good drummers we need another drummer he was he was beheaded by one of them Philistines out on the field of battle you imagine that loss how it affected the church after they had to regroup prophet quoting people come on everybody prophet quoting people that had losses in their life oh I know we don't like to talk about it but it just so happens I'm the type of preacher that I talk about it whether you like it or not because this is the kind of stuff I think we need to hear in message searches you sisters already know how to dress and hopefully God you brothers know how to behave yourself so I don't think I have to stop and start preach and holiness do it hopefully this is where we should be living at into this place of how do I live above failure don't you understand that's what just even preachers around this matter they have failure after failure after loss after loss and they just don't know what to do about it oh by God's grace I'm hoping we can solve a lot of that tonight wins and losses now let's go to First Samuel chapter 4 and also pick up verse 10 now now notice this this next battle now there's some time period between these two fights but remember now they're going into the battle with the knowledge that they know now that they can lose with eject now they know profit quoting people who could stand up there and say glory to God Israel is an invincible army we've got the power jehovah on our side but now they can add to that resume and we also lost 4,000 men the other day as four thousand graves four thousand gravestones four thousand widows mentions four thousand children that needs to be taken care may be orphaned hey this was a big deal this wasn't something that just kind of a sniff that walked on you're talking about four thousand men and the armies of god he's might have been captains he's might have been all kinds of people there were leaders they might have been footmen they might have been in the middle but yet this loss put a little something in the armies of israel they recognized they had the ability to fail well i hope that we get that tonight I hope that you recognize you're not deity we have preached the People of God or deity and deity as in you and all that that's true but you're fleshing deity that's why men should dress right women should dress right while we should talk clean and act clean and live clean because our bodies are not converted come on now that's where the Rebbe said the Bible even said our body is a temple for the law but instead our flesh needs to be kept under wraps Paul said the good I would I don't do the things I don't want to do if I myself do and he said there's a law on me not me said but sin that dwells in me so our body not being converted it has the ability to lose oh I hope somebody's hearing what I'm saying tonight now watch this verse 10 and the Philistines fought and Israel is smitten good lord have mercy if you imagine being the preacher this next Sunday having a drag back to the platform on Sunday well how'd it go and so and so live that battle with cancer no well didn't you no time at all we did put a prayer cloth mother Branham put for them on there did you call this one called Allan schore did laid hands on this when we played their enjoyment on the Holy Ghost came down what happened they died oh god oh god that must mean is word ain't right that desert brother bender said if I pray for a million people tonight and everyone died he said I'd be on the field tomorrow praying for a million more because God's Word is right but how to deal with wins and losses that's our biggest thing how do idea the winds are easy hey when I get a win glory to God hallelujah praise the Lord but when I lose what do i do what do I do when I lose we don't get any quieter we go turn into the Nazarenes well this is over with anyway woo come on out please with me now what I said and they pred every man into his tent perfect quoting people running for the sanctity of their tents what's happening they recognize they've got the ability to lose and because they know they can lose fear is setting in John imagine the preacher got up and quoted to them what Moses said next Sunday morning over to God every place the so I put and I wonder if that preacher might have avoided that subject come Sunday morning you know how preachers do so at least the compromising ones whenever they see an issue they usually dodge around it because they don't want to offend the people or hurt the people or affect the people that's the problem I got with a lot of these modern-day guys coming up around the ranks of the mess they're too nice everything's nice and sweet and they don't want to hurt nobody's feelings and and I don't want to bother y'all with this trouble and everything so I just preached the rapture and preached resurrection and going home time and we're with a bride glory to God we're gone in the rapture and you know we've done we've preached ourselves into a rut and we've called the bride the bride the bride until we're bad as it was 30 years ago is to walk around saying God send a prophet God send a prophet God send a prophet till finally somebody spoke up and said tell me what he said well that's what I'm asking you tonight we wanted the bride the bride the bride the bride but tell me how to be bride tell me how to be elected of God tell me what God looks like we need more we need more we know the brides on the scene but we need to identify and recognize who she is and what she lives like problem is we've hollered about the message in the message in the message the message the people don't even understand what you're talking about the message is an everyday living of recognizing and this failures in it and its successes and its wins and its losses and it's taking chances and it's being discouraged and sometimes sick that's the message but i dont preach blab it and grab it name and claim it hello I know that sometimes there's going to be times that all hell is breaking loose around you that's the message that's what bride looks like I imagine that preacher you know being a nice preacher he probably hoarded all in the scriptures and due to Romany and just had everybody together and say well he said he bless you and you're coming in and blessing you going out god bless you I tell you a preacher preach to me like that I'd never walk cross street to hear him again if I'm wrong I want him to tell me I'm wrong and I want him to tell me how to get right to a man tell me how to get right have some how to live right now once there was a very great slaughter for there fell of Israel watch now 30,000 footmen now our number is up to 34,000 so not only have you devil but you've tripled you've quadrupled and so now when they go back to Israel the great slaughter that they've just experienced was even more so than the 4,000 so the little bit that they experienced with that look how many times it was multiplied after this failure because sometimes little failures they just start a pathway they start a cycle of things in you the first time you felt that the setting sin you as little discouraged over if you thought glory to God I'm gonna raise up my whip this thing the second time you failed to it it was even greater loss than the first one was because you're thinking to yourself I should be able to whip this I should be able to beat this hey God didn't say that the settings sins to be whipped overnight there'll be certain things you may be fighting them for years and years and years and years to come it doesn't mean it gets the best of you but it means you got to fight it sometimes keeping it under your feet we're over it hey I don't need nobody to tell me I'm hitting home right now I can feel it in every one of you why because this is where we're living at this is what real Christianity looks like this is the type of Christianity I deal with on a daily basis look at how many times brother venom about font discouragement every time you see brother BAM he's plotting discouragement nobody loves even nobody wants to hear the message what was it the gift of God in his life to be a prophet and for evangelism the things in mating that type of man where he would preach and cut and whip and hurt and everything he had to go home and deal with it oh I can't believe I said I heard him say this other day I put on some of them records and listen is that I said did I say that oh please tell me I didn't say that surely I didn't say that hey I can recognize that because not every time too brother BAM preach did he get home and say go over to God the greatest message has ever been preached has been preached the greatest revelation has Berthe media I hope they recognize how great tonight was because brother Brennan went home with his head hanging down thanking God why do I have to strike these things over and over again why do I have to hit denomination why do I have to hit organization why do I have to hit all that oh my I believe in one way we would want brother Brennan back but I believe in another way he would be proud to see what his message is accomplished it may not be in the majority but the true word that he preached has got a bride ready to get out of here in the sure I believe he'd be proud of what God's accomplished in this thing all the work all the labor all the sleepless nights all the tears don't you tell me brother BAM went home after every campaign and said who were to God we got the devil this time there were times he went home and he would say God don't never let me preach a sermon again he fought it over and over and over again but yet when we when we present Christianity to people we present it's a happy-go-lucky everything is blessed everything you touches prospers really does it then they're not recognizing the devil's a real devil then because everything you try to prosper the devil standing right there to tear it back down I wish somebody would help me preach tonight everything you ever put your hand to the devil's right there to try to tear it down that's what we got to recognize who he is oh I've fallen to that thing ten thousand times and you may fall ten thousand more the question is are you going to go hide your tent or you'll get back out and fight a man a man oh my listen thirty thousand Pittman and it gets even worse than that and the Ark of God was taken oh my goodness the two sons of Eli hold for nine Phineas were slain so not only they get thirty thousand of your brothers but they've also killed your preachers now you understand people that follow people religion this is a big deal for them those that are following Jehovah they just say well glory to God we'll just keep on moving just dust yourself off and keep on moving people that follow Platt pass to religion hey let me ask you a question what do you think is going to happen give us twenty years around here some of the big celebrities and big names around this message if someone was to die what do you think people in this message is going to do because they can't find nobody like their favorite preacher well come on look at me by God I know I'm telling the truth well they ain't nobody like so-and-so there ain't but Jesus is better than Zones oh jesus is the greatest preacher anyhow I would rather hear Jesus any day of the week than anybody else oh but what are we going to do you heard brother vistacal the other day had a heart operation whatever the mystical goes off the seat and then to some people where the physicals are holy ghost that's the reason why when this happens in their life they're so devastated because they've got their expectation built on perfection you're not a perfect person to go over to God I didn't need you to tell me that did you maybe you need to hear it maybe we've got kind of our own complex in our mind thinking oh I'm bride I'm bride I'm bride I'd never deal with sexual things I'm bride I never feel I want to say cuss words to people I never want to tell a lie when I get in trouble uh-huh really so you must be a special kind of stupid that's what they say in the world come on now because there's not a person in this world that don't live with their own humanity mm at the Holy Ghost serve me today is the heat of humanity the heat of humanity whenever the body whenever the mind whatever pressure begins building up the heat from humanity it almost drives you crazy because it's like your thoughts and your emotions are the boiling point and it just keeps going going going going going you think you're going to go crazy and then you say but I'm bright but I'm bright i'm elect yeah that's right but did you recognize who's in the city do you recognize who's living in your heart can you recognize god and use greater than the devil out there trying to destroy you that's the thing you got to recognize because if not wins and losses will pull you down right hey listen I've got many more losses than I do wins - head nods a few eye blinks in one little shake come on now I've got many main losses than I do wins I've failed a whole lot more than what I have succeeded but I refuse to lay down just because I fail how about you how about you I refuse to quit just because I mess up because if I quit I'll never become an overcomer if I stop I'll never go forward I'll never cross the finish line if I stop when I fall there's been many of them come from the behind come from the behind spot then put them come from the behind part when they're so far back behind they can't hardly even hold on but because of grit and determination and because of the Holy Ghost in you you'll come from the behind all the way up to the front that's what God wants us to go to recognize that's true overcoming now here we've got thirty four thousand people slain wonder what church look like on Sunday better yet what looked like on Wednesday night because that's when half the church shows up so when he comes to church that night I'll tell you children of God I'll tell you God Jehovah he said we are a peculiar people and you know he also said every every blessing God's give you every blessing that's right pastor avoid that subject stay away from it you might upset people because he knows if he wasn't start quoting that prophet again they're going to point to him to them 34,000 fresh graves and say if brother Branham is right I mean if Moses is right you got to be careful when people produce evidence because evidence can be twisted that's why you can't believe everything you see every report about a bridge and everything about a versa did it be careful about stuff like that cuz I'm gonna tell you something right now a lot of times the people that left this message when the believe this hide and seek you the truth when all them showed up that was just the ticket they've been looking for anyhow because it was in their heart to find a way out so they just take it all the glory to God they've got evidence they got facts so do we and we've even got greater evidence than that they try to tell me all the one message I preached some time ago I had a did a little interview with a sister from Newfoundland and she asked the question are women underestimated in this message I said yes I said frankly women are bullied around this message we've beat him in the head we tell him to live this way live that way and every time they come to church you poor sister how to endure us preaching on whether you're dressing right or not half the women in this message ain't really been instructed how to be mothers kind of how to be ladies how to live for God how to overcome we got preacher after picture one guy wrote me and said oh don't give him evidence I said to keep our most mouths shut gives them evidence why are we so afraid to challenge that devil out there why wins and losses oh there was a pastor for 30 years quit the message altogether thank God I said thank God because if they ain't genuine in the first place we don't need him around know how Amen I don't wish anybody harm but why would we back up when the challenge is on why people so afraid to talk of one brother groped me and said oh you better be careful identifying that we've got problems in the message I said any idiot can see we got problems in the message you know why some people think we're caught some people live like we're a cult their life is like a cult they won't talk to nobody they're not nice to nobody I'm here anyhow I just got to say it brothers won't open the door for sisters and they won't say yes ma'am and no ma'am and on and on and on and sisters are living like a like a jewel in a pet pig snout no discretion and no ladylike about her come on out and yet we cower down whenever the challenge is on about what brother branham's birthdate was well I I'd be afraid they can sure point to a lot of problems so could they and so did they so Goliath of em say makes his boast he's bluffing because he he knows if Israel really becomes unified they can whip them he knows that he can read the history books like the rest of them can he knows if they ever become unified around that word he knows that Israel is an army to be reckoned with but he's bluffing him is trying to use their own fears based on their own wins and losses as evidence that they can't whip him so send me a man to fight us he knew they were cowering in the cave he knew they were hiding in the tents he knew they were scared same thing around the message oh brother bin I just don't know if there's any church we can go to this ride and I'm looking for the perfect Church well when you show up you'll you'll you'll ruin that [Music] there's a lot forgive me but it's true there's no perfect person anyway oh I just wish we had some preachers around the message that that would tell us the truth they are we do have people around the message over tells you we do have honest people around I'll grant it to you that there's a whole lot more problems than there is is it solutions but that's not a reason for us to throw up our hands and say well that proves the message is wrong the problem is friends we back down from challenges that we ought not back down to oh if I serve the Lord my momma won't like me and my daddy won't like me and just want to turn me down laugh do what they want to I'm saying with God's word as long as Jesus don't do away with me that's all that matters you may hate me after tonight but as long as he loves me that's what I'm looking for I love you anyhow but now you may not love me but I love you but I want him to love me more does he's my ticket out of here hey man he's my he's my token out of here oh praise the Lord look here in 1st Samuel 7-7 chapter 7 verse 7 9 watch this and when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpah the Lords of the Philistines went up against Israel oh now now we're getting down to business now I just think the Philistines coming on now it's the Lords of the Philistines I imagined them dudes I bet they'd walk with a little bit more spring in their step when they walk across that line because they knew they had Israel right in the palms of their hand they were determined to put their their pressure their influence just like in in Rome when they would place the cross it's a known fact that they would use folks crucified all over the city when you'd enter into the city there might be people to the gate hanging on the cross it was a message Rome would send to all of their captors don't mess with us you cross us we'll cross you the same way once they get influenced but remember this way the devil does you get you in a corner he gives you a bluff try to make you feel like there's no way out so well I've been reading some of them websites and I've been looking at what some in folks and some of the stuff they say makes sense you ever read about Flat Earth sometimes people make sense when they talk about things you ever read about we didn't really go to the moon it was just a stage thing some of that stuff makes sense they have the ability to reason it out but we're not talking about reasoning of the word we're talking about proof and facts that Jesus Christ did not vindicate William Brennan to be the prophet of God for this last day he did benda Kate him he did back him up one picture they showed was with Edie Sullivan and the Beatles standing there in Houston where the pillar of fire was taken as I was fabricated see there look at the white streaks of light the pictures in back of them for black and white and look at in white streaks of light over the Beatles I guess the Beatles have indicated - one day I was looking at the picture and I thought to myself that's a toughy I wonder how can hack and deal with that and all of a sudden I was reading in the revelation series a brother man makes this one comment that woke me up and that jeantel you'd solve the thing for me but REM said now watch him here in the revelation in the fourth he said John standing there in the presence of God and the mystery of his colors and light going all around he said because as John stood in this place the rainbow colors shot on Shawn in that amber gold yellowish green color that is the pillar of fire and I looked at the pillar of fire over brother brems head black and white I looked at the Beatles and over their head black and white and it hit me if you put it in color what you find out is that the light above their head is a streak of light like this electric light right here but show up the one over the band's head and it's an amber yellowish gold green color altogether because that's the color of the pillar Oh fire he's not electric light like that he's yellowish green he's an amber color the thing of it is God hides these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent but reveals from the babes such as we learn there's an answer out there if you're willing to seek for it if you're going to really look for what's right and for what's truth but you realize many of these debates many of these battles are based upon wins and losses many of these people that have left the message to leave it because of treatment not because of doctrine but because of treatment they've been treated poorly and they've had poor people treating them that's exactly the right problem after problem they get offended has nothing to do with whether the message is right let's go on and talk about the message that brother Ben and brought forget birthdays forget bridges forget failed visions forget all that nonsense let's just talk about for the Breton's doctrine for a minute let's go to the Bible find oneness of the Godhead let's find if the serpent had a seat or not let's find water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ let's find out if the Holy Ghost is promised for today come on somebody when it comes to the doctrine of the Bible it's absolutely flawless a friend of mine up in Connecticut I hope this is okay a friend of mine up in Connecticut not long ago about two months or so he just walked up to the platform and he told everybody he was done with the message he's going to quit brother man is not the prophet that came said because brother Vance told everything from Charles taze Russell the founder of the Jehovah Witness said see there see his pyramid-- his a gravestone as a pyramid just like brother branham's he called himself the lady you see a message just like brother Branham did I said so what do you think about I said his argument is weaker than the broth made from the shadow of start after death I said because even Jesus himself standing in pilots Hall when they said which Jesus would you rather us release to you realize Barabbas first name was Jesus there'll be many impersonators come along what are you saying that de la Garde we cast out Devils and done this that and the other they said but brother branham plagiarize I wish some of these folks would go to school a little bit plagiarism is when you steal an idea and make it your own but when you tell where you got it from that's not plagiarism plagiarism is when you steal it and make it your own but brother Bentham always told us where he got everything from he told them folks I gotta read this I was reading Joseph Smith and I was reading that one and reading that one he said when he opened up the seals and the Holy Spirit come to open the seals he said when I got down and started studying many of the old scholars and many of the riders and Charles Russell and all the rest rebel he said I was about to make a terrible mistake until the Holy Spirit corrected me on something I was going to say do you have problems listen to a guy preachers preachers up reaches other people's ideas do you have a problem that's good because that's all I've done tonight I preached from Samuel I preached from John I've quoted to you from brother Branham I place some things in from history well we've got the original thought anyways come on somebody but what is it why are we afraid to challenge these things wins and losses because people can always point to some failure oh that's what there are were preachers I don't believe in preachers because I knew this preacher run off with a piano player and this preacher robbed the people apply and disputable what about the good ones so now I'm not going to church therefore we're hypocrites I said in over the grocery store don't go to the bank because God have mercy on you this hypocrites all over the place oh god you're Taylor is a hypocrite and no Walmart lady there's probably I have a craft don't never eat your restaurant ever again as long as you live there maybe wins and losses this is how the devil holds these things over our head really comes down to his fear fear Satan knows because he studied us he knows when we're afraid to step forward and he knows what it will take to make us step backwards too but I refuse to back up when our God the shot of the king is in the camp I recognize God in me is greater than him oh my you say don't you get afraid and sure I do you get scared you better believe it when they publish this little interview I'm talking about and I started getting critics come back my flesh was so scared I thought oh god here we go Here I am just trying to help the body of Christ and they say I know this one that one of the other one it's amazing to me when you tell the truth what kind of response you get from people because I actually had some of the critics write me back and said thank you brother bin thank you for being one of the first message preachers we know to actually tell the truth about what's going on in the rankings of the message because that's the reason I left the church one sister said because I was being mistreated as a sister I was being bullied as a sister and some of the brothers that heard my little interview the other day they wrote in and told the sister we got delivered from being bullies ourselves when somebody spoke up and told the truth I said thank God at least God got a few little David's around there someone and I'm afraid but we back up on things parents do with their children yeah because you had a bad childhood because your mom and dad abused you and was rough on you and too hard on you well you just let anything go at home I've just that guy went from preaching to middlin already to because you don't want to repeat the same cycle so you're too easy on them well you're just shifting it to the other side of the ditch here here's what's holding it there instead of keeping everything focused on the work and having discernment and saying god help me have me balance all of this out so it would be hard but not too hard help maybe lie but not too light but because mama was I was a authoritarian and disciplinarian and all that or daddy was I were afraid somebody yells at a child oh we shake all over and the devil knows that's there he knows that's there so he uses that against us you're going to find out before your changed that many of the battles that the devil fought you with was battles it was a part of you already things that you were dealing with already yourself and he just used it against you verse 7 7 7 and when the children of Israel heard it they were what afraid of the Philistines listen to me prophet quoting people I said my god did you see the Lord's up there they know they know we're done we've already lost 34 thousand people to these to this group to this army we know if we stand up against them they'll slap us again so watch what happens it's got down a first sandwich chapter 13 verse 5 remember because of the condition of Israel's fear there was actually peace and in Israel for many years after this last encounter that we just read it wasn't for sake of peace between the armies but it's because Israel just wouldn't pick the fight that reminds me the way people live sometimes it make deals with the devil I won't bother you you don't bother me okay don't make deals with the devil he crosses his fingers behind his back I'll leave you alone and you leave me alone okay he'll say okay I do it but don't you ever bite he's got his fingers crossed behind his back he don't never believe what I don't remember you know how to know the devil's line and lived for moving a mad he walked these people he won't be sincere if he promises I don't make deals with the devil it don't work well I'll just back off from being a fervent Christian maybe I won't fight so many battles and by doing so you already losing the battle because if you ain't fighting you ain't winning if you ain't losing some you ain't fightin hello right First Samuel 13 verse 5 for this thing's over with y'all want to go from shouting the paten aren't you we're getting to the good part just hold on hold on get through this first and the Philistines gathered himself together to fight with Israel thirty thousand chariots six thousand horsemen and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude they came up and pitched in mcNeish eastward toward Beth Haven I remember many times the children visitor wasn't permitted to ride horses and chariots and fight they were footmen so could you imagine this site when they look up here across the mountain and they see all of this gathered up there and they know we could lose maybe some I would speak up yes but the prophet of God said is a shot we've quoted in quotes all these years why not these 34,000 men that's about the way they do in divine healing they'll point to everybody didn't have enough faith to be healed by divine healing and everyone that backslidden left to church didn't have enough faith to say saved their point to all of those instead of pointing to the ones that are actually saved and I've been healed by the power of God the papers will pack a verb and said like this he said somebody died under divine healing the papers packet across the globe he said how many hospitals lost patients just today they don't say nothing about it that's what the devil does he changes the focus of it he changes the look of it so that he can convince you it's a different way of looking at it he changes emphasis many times he emphasizes your mistakes hey brother if the devil come to you and told you every good thing you ever done it wouldn't be much of a fight the devil ever told you how many times he's ever whipped you anybody ever have the devil come to you and let you know how many times you whipped it anybody any demon give you a resume or a readout or an updated printed out version of how many times you've won battles nobody me either but what do they do they always focus them spirits always emphasize you know the last time you tried that you know what happened you know the last time you felt like shouting brother so-and-so was looking at you awful hard when you started shouting you know the last time you sang that song you made a mess out of it and you know you get up there and then people think you can sing or think you can play you mess it up though you're going to look like the fool share the world and yet I'll never say to you you know what you can get up here and if you get under the anointing the Holy Ghost you may mess up but God will bless it anyhow it never tells you if you start shouting it's going to be the greatest experience you've had this week you never hear that other devil in that's strange you never even talk that way you know why always wants to focus on your lost part that's what keeps you down that's why you must recognize no matter how many times you lose God in you is greater than he that is in this world that's the key of the overcoming of it it's not how many times I whip him it's how many times I let Jesus with him out of me hey man hey man watch this now and when the men events are far they went straight for the people were distressed then the people hid themselves in caves it rolled up their books and their spoken word books and they ran with the games boy had enough of this mess I've lost in loss and loss of anglers and no more I'd rather be a coward than to be found out there dead at least in this thicket back here my head will be on my shoulders that's about the way some people live for God I'll just kind of you know hide myself I won't talk about God all the time and and I might say a few little easy light cuss words just to kind of you know keep everybody from thinking I'm a certain type person that's you hidin in the thicket well glory to God I'd be afraid I'd be afraid to testify that Jesus in the workplace because I'm there to work after all I talk about God well there's the truth to that but what if God moves on your heart to testify to somebody while you're there huh you're hiding you thicket I remember some time ago a young lady that she's back slid now but my wife was working with him and they were sitting there one day and a certain subject come up and all at once there she is in the office for all these women I mean you talk about man-hating type women Jezebel last days I think Laurel dimers didn't talk about God they will talk about none that kind of stuff I want to put their husbands down at home how sorry they were and all this that all of a sudden this young lady got to talk about the Lord and my wife become anointed to start testifying to her and told her about Jesus thought about salvation she's must be a message girl but told her says you don't get rights you're going to hell because there ain't no heaven for a place with a person that's got doubt in their heart and got the sin of the world in their heart you got to get saved and some of them women boy they was a real in their neck around at her and what in the world but I said that's right I said if a man a woman is full of the Holy Ghost by them said it gives them boldness they're not afraid who's listening to him I'm not afraid who's looking a man but instead what was these people doing they were hiding away because they were afraid they would lose again well I tell people I'm a Christian but I keep making so many mistakes how in the world are people going to think I'm a Christian with all the mistakes I make you know the bem said he said overcome that thing just a few times and watch your testimony bloom you don't even have to to permanently overcome it just let people see you trying that respects you for that down in the heart they'll respect you for being honest but these people are hiding look at them in the thickets in the caves and the rocks and the high places in pits last prophet quoting people doing in pits wins and losses now let's turn to the first time in 28 verse 4 now let's read together just just a couple verses here about the leader of Israel let's see what was the problem of Saul when the Philistines gathered himself together and came and pitched and shoot him Saul gathered all Israel together and they pitched in Gilboa when saul saw the host of the Philistines he was encouraged by the Lord grabbed his sword PHAB his shield to cut envoys of fires this way he was afraid and he greatly trembled the world has an expression it's called the armchair leader now what that means is when a person is an armchair leader do these move ok yeah when a person is the armchair they have armchair quarterbacks armchair politicians and what it basically means is this a person if they're armchair quarterback that can sit there like this watch the football game and tell them every play they should have made everywhere the Super Bowl what was his name Tom Brady I think the Patriots right I was in Pennsylvania preaching the weekend that they won the Super Bowl and after we got done with church we went to a little place that served mom and pop style pizza you know we got a piece of my wife and I was heading back to the room I'm going to enjoy the rest of the night we're sitting in there and there's these three men gather around television and it's just about over with the Patriots about to lose and there's this one old boy and they were just a hot and as a glory to God well they didn't go to God as if our son so I tell you what I do right now and I looked at him and I thought you 450 pounds easy and I'd say you are more familiar with a Little Debbie than you are a football plays not other guy on the other side of him he was saying okay after I do boy I get that barn discharge through all of them and I said I doubt very much that that guy gets up out of his chair to change the television with a remoteness and much less charge through a line like that with the football man and the other guy he was going on and he was a whopper too and he was evidence running I would do this and I would do that and I thought and that's something they can sit in the armchair and tell everybody else how to do it but they'll never get on the field of battle and show them how it's done well everybody that doubted mr. Brady they found out real quick what grit and determination will do for a man because if they were betting people I'm sure there's almost a lot of money on that deal and there were gamblers all over the country so disappointed they could only stand it they were changing their bets halfway through the game sitting in the armchair armchair politicians I'll tell you how to run this country some poor old boy in Tennessee he's got one tooth in his head he's got $5.00 in his bank account and yet he's gonna tell me how to run this nation arm-chair saul was this kind of man you got the scripture there sister flash it again look look look at what kind of man this was saw saw the horse of the Philistines so what did he do nothing he sat back well I wonder what these boys are going to do about all this hey man you're the King you're the ones supposed to be doing the thing you're supposed to be leading him to battle why aren't you standing up and said anything because he was too busy hiding in the armchair but see David was a man trained under a different atmosphere David had wins and losses as well but he didn't let him affect him hey you only gonna tell me that every time David slung his rock he hit the bear you ain't gonna tell me every time he threw that little sling that he got the lion every time I'm sure there were times that David probably mr. bear and he almost became a lion supper but he knew God was with him and no matter how many times he messed up he knew that God would be with him no matter what was going on so when he walked up now if you go back to our text when we started God Goliath rose to make his big brag the moment he makes his bag David hears the words could you imagine what it must have been his brothers and all them standing around watching give me a man to fight and David's going goody-goody this is going to keep good which one of these boys all have been he'll get him he's at least eight foot tall man that guy he's a left-handed fighter I bet he'll come at him by surprise take his head plumb off his shoulders and the more Goliath talking the more that the men was he'll give me a man to fight David go where y'all going uh-uh what were y'all going and nobody going fight huh anybody yeah then we'll fight him he said well glory to God you bunch of cows y'all won't take him I will I like determination like that he didn't look at the odds he didn't look at the circumstances or listen to me he didn't look at what was going on around him and if he looked at a website it didn't influence in that much David said God's with us the word says that were circumcised he's an uncircumcised philistine he don't have a promise he don't have a covenant he don't have nothing so when David shows up to Saul's chambers you know Saul's doing of course sitting in the armchair he's not willing to fight he's like that guy from Louisville that was telling the fireman squirt a little water here squirt a little water there but Dave is like the guy from Clarksville who before they could get to the fire the ladder was over to going up and he was at the top of the ladder kicking a window open with us with the with the hole slung over shows a convoy surprise this way that was the kind of man David was David might have had wins and losses as well but he did that affect him because everybody was looking at Goliath's being 9 foot tall but David was saying um Goliath and look behind you Goliath look behind you there's somebody bigger there behind you he wasn't looking at Goliath he was looking at his big gods over that was behind him Alleluia as long as he kept his eyes on Jehovah and not on his wins and losses he knew that no matter how many times he put on that rock and failed there was a purpose wars are fought for principles and David knew that this armor needed some courage so he throws his stone I love a bit of em says and why Christ speak in 1963 Brennan said David knew he was vindicated to be a good shot come on somebody he knew that if God ever got a hold a lock that he would take Goliath down ha together so he didn't have fear Saul said David David David come on boy he's been a warrior from his youth he knows more about he has forgotten more about fighting than you know yourself he said yeah but you don't realize I'm a little bitty old guy 90 pounds soaking wet little ruddy thing and a line about 500 pounds came up to get one of my father's sheep so what kind of odds would you put on me if you were betting people I imagine if you saw David on one side of the hill Goliath on the other who would you cast you bet board you know how the ultimate fighters are when they put them in the cage they match them up between their scythes wrestlers they put them between their sides and their height and their ability to throw or whatever it is this guy knows jiu-jitsu or this guy knows Taekwondo or this guy's a boxer whatever is they they match them up if you'd have been casting Lots on which one you thought was going to win this battle when David comes running up there and he's got little spindly skinny arms he's probably hunts back a little bit from leaning over on the Sheep all day and here's Goliath at his glistening armor standing up before all of the people and all their glory and all their power let everybody know how tough he is who would you put your money on you'd have chose the guy that looked like you had the fight won that's what the devil likes to do he likes to put your focus upon what you see but it was because David was looking to the unseen and looking to God's promise that's the reason David wasn't in the armchair he was willing to fight Saul used to be that kind of man but he lost it he lost the anointing fort he thought that it was easier to send people off to do it and you remember one of the main times that David got in trouble that he got in trouble that she even got trouble with the Lord you remember it was the very same time he sent your ayah to the frontline of the battle that wasn't in David's character because David usually the guy riding to the front of the battle himself amazing how Satan would use such things against the people but David didn't listen to none of it he heard Goliath say send me man he said I'll be your man I'll be your huckleberry you want to fight let's fight boy he said what is this a dog is in the dog to fight about he said I'll take your flesh and feed him to the thousand-aire oh I like this David said bring it on and we'll see who's feeding who to what you see what he was doing he's putting the word before him the word of his testimony because see that's the only way you can overcome is you got to recognize God's already give you the battle before you even face you Goliath that's the power of true overcoming listen that again let me read it to you one more time and how can overcome the sort of BAM said let me read you one more time is close he says you must recognize him a real devil you must know he's a real devil when you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that God in you is greater and mightier than he is and the one that is in you hallelujah has already overcoming you're not waiting on overcoming you've already overcome you've just got to accept it that's the whole reason I think sometimes we don't get the deliverance we want to get brother BAM talked about this little crow it had to bring tied around his leg little been said the farmer would let that little crow go this far and then let him go that far so one day the farmer untied him but that crow still believed that he was tied and so he only went so far this way and so far that way he was already delivered he just didn't recognize it that's where it is with us that I don't let your winds and your losses blinds you because no matter how much you win or lose the real overcoming is recognizing that God is in your heart because if he's there nobody can overcome you and we might lose the battles excuse me for being cliche we may lose many battles but we will not lose this war we've been promised to overcome in the last day god bless you let's stand again praise the Lord you believe it is it for you can you identify with it Amen let's pray together Lord Jesus thank you father for what we've heard tonight Lord no matter how many times I go over this little thought it always has such influence to me such a power and God and I realized reason it influences me so much is because it's so much a part of my life there are times I preach Lord Jesus or such favor in the church and favor in the congregation it's just one win after another after another after another in the congregation to see my people are just lining up in successes and things and God there's times you go into a church and there's their reasoning in their doubt in there they've had struggles that all in the valley is it were it seemed like you get done preaching you don't even feel like you've even got through anywhere at home as a dad I feel that very way I win I lose as a husband I win I lose sometimes when I feel like I should be a certain way I find myself falling so short no doubt that's what Paul said the good I would I do not the things that don't want to do if I myself doing he recognizes that once the Holy Ghost comes to a man it doesn't change his flesh at law still exists in his flesh but God help us each one of us tonight I pray help us to come to the realization of what we really are as your children God that were not just a bunch of fly-by-nights so her brother Brendan say it the other night is it the true child of God isn't a fly-by-night a man means that we're here today gone tomorrow but Lord we're in this for the long haul Lord in the long term but help us recognize it cuz God this what I preach tonight is what gets so many of us wins and losses we can identify with these children of Israel here each one of us can look back over the course of our life and see how many times that you've been there for us and we've won and one and one and one and then Lord it seems like after 15 wins or 50 wins we have won great loss and the whole bottom falls out of it a lot of it is because Lord we want to please you we want to serve you with trueness we want to serve you with perfection but God what we need to realize tonight is that no Christian can serve in a perfect way they serve do flaws they serve through mistakes they serve through growing they serve through learning they serve through all of it you said be you therefore perfect but Lord that word doesn't mean sinless perfection it means maturity well I may not be able to handle everything perfectly but Lord I can handle with maturity if I do wrong I can repent if I make a mistake I can clean it up and straighten it out that's being mature it's not wallowing in things it's dealing with them looking things eyeball to eyeball god we've run from our problems so long in this message people try to pretend like we don't have any issues what a shame what a shame when you are the very God that died on Calvary so that you could heal us of our mistakes and our failures and misgivings Lord we don't want to slap you in the face or trample your blood by trying to pretend like we have no errors we do we do but lord help us recognize Alleluia that the Great Holy Ghost I thank you Lord is living inside of our hollers ha hey hallelujah and God no matter what's going on around us although hair may be breaking loose around us that great Holy Spirit living in us is the Conqueror of everything around us ha I just bless your name Jesus abolition hanging God let this word this message tonight help you people help them to be encouraged by it Lord recognize where we're standing in Jesus name I pray with your heads bowed just another minute now I just want to ask this because the one I'd like to pray again one more time but how many tonight would like to raise your hand to the Lord and say I was affected by what I've heard tonight and I want Jesus to help me I want him to help me I've been discouraged I've been going through battles wins and losses I I've been feeling the fight feeling the pressure the heat of humanity I've been feeling all and I want God to help me god bless your hands let's pray one more time father forever you've lifted a hand in this place tonight I pray the Holy Ghost would meet with every person Lord as they gave their confession before you tonight they need your help we raise our hands here tonight Lord because we believe you we trust you we have confidence in you I pray you to speak to us deal with us anoint us and give us favor Lord in your presence that our needs may be met before you Lord I pray in the name of Jesus Christ forever hand amen and amen thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus [Music] thank you lord hmm it's already done it's already done [Music] the battle is over the victories won it's already done oh can we sing it together tonight with a hands race oh it's already done it's already done battle is over victories won it's already done all this thing now well I'm already here you I'm already

is won I have overcome um come on stick it again hey I have overtime [Applause] I have over [Music] battle is over victory is won I have overcome let's give the Lord a hand the phrase tonight hallelujah thank you Jesus Oh glory to God glory to God hallelujah Jesus my how we certainly appreciate the word of the Lord that was brought to our hearts tonight and man rather than just was going through wins and losses and you know I think if we were to be honest with ourselves we look at the history of the nation of Israel and how often they found themselves living in the fear and the reason they lived in fears because of the things that they experienced oftentimes we kind of go through that whether it's a sickness in our body or some trial that we're trying to overcome a man we look at others that might have been defeated and we wonder if we can actually overcome in that but I tell you what greater is He that is in you that he that is in the world and if there's nothing else she got out this tonight a man to just just know that your God is great I mean when David looked at situation he saw something different than the rest of them Amen even though he had gone through different battles and maybe lost some but I think David focused on his victories but when he went before Saul he just began to testify what God had already done this they looked at this giant gonna be just like the lion and just like the bear so focus on what God is already done before you don't focus on a man on the negative part focus on the positive part amen it's only the devil that want to focus on the negatives brother ben god bless you we really appreciate you tonight we really appreciated that tonight my my my my my my mind that was that was all right I just thank God for it I really do I really do amen I was we won't do this but I was just thinking amen last time the other families here I don't nothing the last time on time before that but we have a song on on the church website Holy Spirit rain on us yeah and and and that song when you listen to it on the church website the organ player for the band he's the one that was playing the organ on that song that we put there and and we just thank God for it for the talent yes a man was singing the word and we leave here inspired and courage and strengthened and I believe we leave here overcoming hey man we're not defeated we are we are over cometh a man praise the Lord I mean let's just have a word of Prayer and we'll prepare to dismiss you tonight I'm one that truly believes that if we would hold on to what God gave us it tonight whatever it is that you're facing that thing will change it meant by the round and say the right mental attitude towards ending divine promise we'll bring it to pass a man so have the right attitude as you go out of here tonight no matter what you're facing you are an overcomer Amen father we are blessed to hear the words that we heard you tonight and god how real it is we as human beings we know that we go through times we have wins and losses but God where we're determined to focus on the wins we're determined amen the focus on your greatness not ours because when we step out there in our own what with our own strength we fail every time but God knowing that the greater one lives on the inside of us and God you've never lost the battle the Lord we we rest on that so we pray God that you would help us for to all just do that evaluation of our own lives and God after doing that may we reflect on the on the things that you have done for us that calls us to be victorious reminds of another minister denominational minister made a comment so we fight from a place of victory not fight to get the victory God's you're the one that won the victory account and Lord we fight from that place so help us God stay hidden behind the cross amen hidden and underneath the blood that you God would just continue to give us power over the enemy there might be some here tonight suffering in their body Lord may they not look at the symptoms but may they look at the promise that God has given them and made a whole to God's unchanging hand no matter who else has gone down Lord may they know that you've made them a promise and your promise word cannot fail you were wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace is upon you and with your stripes we are healed God whatever it is that the people are facing tonight Lord if faintness brought all types of condemnation may they know that if they walk after the spirit and not after the blest and they don't have to be condemned Lord but they can think and they can stand in the place of victory even tonight so we trust you God that you would just help us to fly what it is that we hurt bless your servant for the Noah Lord as he prepared in the morning the pre-chat okeechobee in tomorrow night Lord will be preaching their Boynton Beach use them for your glory for your honor father may you bless
