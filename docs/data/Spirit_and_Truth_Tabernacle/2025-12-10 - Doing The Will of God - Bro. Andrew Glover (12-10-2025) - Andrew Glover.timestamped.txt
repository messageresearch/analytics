[0:00] The more that I surrender,
[0:04] the lighter
[0:06] my load,
[0:08] the more that I release my cares, the
[0:13] more he takes control.
[0:18] The more that I can humble myself, the
[0:23] more he lifts me up. And every day I

[2:22] Let's Let's bow our heads.
[2:25] Almighty God,
[2:28] what a glorious privilege it is to be
[2:30] back in the house of the Lord, Lord, to
[2:32] worship you, Lord, in spirit and in
[2:34] truth. Father, as your people, Lord,
[2:37] have wared, Lord, throughout the day to
[2:39] get to this place, Father, that we may
[2:43] feel your presence, Lord, to hear your
[2:45] word, Lord Jesus, and to believe you,
[2:48] Father. We're so grateful, Lord God,
[2:50] that you have brought us here safely,
[2:51] Lord. And we pray for our brothers and
[2:54] sisters who have yet to make it, Lord.
[2:56] Give them traveling mercies. Father, we
[2:59] pray, almighty God, that you would
[3:00] shower down your rain upon us just now.
[3:03] Anoint the musicians, Lord. Anoint this
[3:06] congregation, Lord. Anoint brother
[3:07] Andrew, Father God. Father, you brought
[3:10] him a mighty long way, Lord, that he may
[3:12] speak to us, Lord. He's a vessel in your
[3:15] hands, Lord. He's the microphone. You
[3:17] are the speaker, Lord. Anoint him and
[3:20] use him. Help him to get himself out of
[3:21] the way, Lord. Lord, and may every ear
[3:24] and every heart believe you, Lord. For
[3:27] we are believers, Lord. We delight in
[3:29] your word, Father. Your word has
[3:32] transformed our lives, Lord, and made us
[3:36] Christians in the last day. Lord, as we
[3:39] have welcomed you to this service, Lord,
[3:41] we commit ourselves to you, asking that
[3:43] you have complete preeminence.
[3:46] We commit all things to you now in the
[3:47] name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and
[3:49] Savior. Amen. Let's give our God a hand
[3:52] clap of praise.
[4:05] You are not a god created
[4:10] by human hands. You are not a god
[4:15] dependent
[4:17] on any mortal man.
[4:20] You are not a God in need of
[4:25] anything we can give by your plan.
[4:31] And that's just the way it is. Come on.
[4:33] You are not a God. See,
[4:36] you are not a God created
[4:41] by human hands.
[4:44] You are not a God dependent
[4:49] on any mortal man.
[4:52] You are not a God in need of
[4:57] anything we can give by your plan.
[5:02] And that's just the way it is.
[5:09] Say you are God alone
[5:13] from before time began.
[5:18] You are on your throne.
[5:22] You are God alone.
[5:26] And right now
[5:29] in the good times and bad
[5:34] you are on your throne.
[5:38] You are God alone.
[5:45] You're the only God whose power
[5:50] none can contend.
[5:53] You're the only God whose name
[5:59] praise will never end.
[6:02] You're the only God who's worthy
[6:07] of everything we can give. You are God
[6:12] and that's just the way it is.

[8:51] And right now
[8:54] in the good times and bad
[8:59] you are on your throne
[9:02] because you are God alone.
[9:10] Somebody give him praise.
[9:13] Thank you Jesus.
[9:15] Amen. Amen. So good to be back in the
[9:18] house of the Lord uh on tonight. Um as
[9:22] we mentioned on Sunday, um we are being
[9:27] blessed to have uh brother Andrew Glover
[9:29] with us on tonight. He is passing
[9:32] through on his way to Trinidad and uh
[9:34] decided to stop in and see us. And
[9:38] there's many other churches that he
[9:39] could have gone to, but God saw fit to
[9:42] have him come our way. Amen. And so
[9:45] we're looking forward to what the Lord
[9:46] has in store for us on tonight. We want
[9:49] to just get ourselves out of the way and
[9:51] allow our brother to come in his own
[9:53] special way to minister to the hearts of
[9:56] the believers. Amen. Let's continue to
[9:58] sing. Amen. This um and uh we'll welcome
[10:03] brother Andrew. You're unchangeable,
[10:05] unshakable, unstoppable. Amen. That's
[10:08] what you are. Hallelujah.
[10:11] Thank you, Jesus. Oh,

[10:18] Yes, you're unshakable,
[10:21] unstoppable.
[10:25] Well, that's what you are. Unchangeable.
[10:31] You're unshakeable.
[10:37] You're unstoppable.
[10:41] is what you are.
[10:44] Hallelujah. One more time. UNCHANGEABLE.
[10:49] You're unshakeable.
[10:53] God, you're unstoppable.
[10:57] That's what you are. Oh, you are God.
[11:03] Say you are God alone.
[11:07] And from before
[11:17] God alone.
[11:23] Oh yes. Good times
[11:28] that you are on your throne.
[11:33] You are God alone.
[11:38] Amen. How many believes that tonight?
[11:41] Amen.
[11:43] There's no God with him. There's no God
[11:45] beside him. Amen. He is God and he is
[11:48] God alone. Amen. I think about how many
[11:51] gods there are in the world tonight. And
[11:54] Amen. to think that the grace of God has
[11:56] given us the privilege tonight. Amen.
[11:58] Not to be serving a God, but to be
[12:00] serving the one true and living God.
[12:03] Amen. We know who he is tonight. We're
[12:05] not worshiping at the altar of the
[12:07] unknown God, but our God has been
[12:09] clearly identified in this generation.
[12:11] I'm thankful for that tonight. Aren't
[12:12] you? He's been identified as a savior,
[12:15] as a healer, as a deliverer. Whatever
[12:17] you have need of tonight, I believe
[12:19] that's who he is tonight. Maybe we just
[12:21] bow our hearts for a word of prayer as
[12:23] we open his word. Maybe you have just a
[12:25] special need upon your heart tonight.
[12:27] Something that you would desire from the
[12:29] Lord if you would just want to slip your
[12:31] hand up to him. I know he sees every
[12:33] hand. He knows every need. Heavenly
[12:36] Father, Lord, as your believers have
[12:38] gathered here this afternoon, Father,
[12:41] we've not gathered here out of ritual or
[12:42] out of tradition, Lord. But, Father,
[12:45] we've gathered here because there is a
[12:46] deep calling to the deep. And Lord, your
[12:49] prophet told us that before there was a
[12:51] deep calling to the deep, there was a
[12:52] deep to respond. Lord, how thankful we
[12:55] are tonight that we're not gathered
[12:57] here, Lord, just trying to work
[12:59] something up or find something. But
[13:01] Lord, you're still Jehovah Gyra. You
[13:03] provided something. Lord, you provided
[13:06] something for us to believe. Your word,
[13:08] Lord. You provided something for our
[13:10] healing. You have provided something,
[13:12] Lord, for every need that's represented
[13:14] here tonight. Father, you've seen every
[13:16] hand that was raised behind that hand.
[13:19] Lord, you know the need. Whether it be a
[13:21] a financial need, a spiritual need, a
[13:23] physical need, Lord. Whatever the need
[13:25] would be, there's no need too big for
[13:27] you, Lord. And father, I invite you to
[13:30] come in the building tonight. Lord, may
[13:32] you walk up and down the aisles of this
[13:34] sanctuary. Father, Lord, maybe for one
[13:36] at home unable to be here, listen to
[13:38] this service or one that'll go back and
[13:40] hear it. Father, I pray that you would
[13:42] minister to their needs, Lord. I pray,
[13:44] oh God, you would forgive us of our
[13:46] failures. You would forgive us of our
[13:48] shortcomings, Lord. That we would be
[13:50] transformed by the renewing of our mind,
[13:52] Father. Lord, I pray tonight that you
[13:54] would come and meet the needs of your
[13:56] children, Lord. Father, we've not
[13:58] gathered here to be seen or to be heard,
[14:00] but Father, that you would come among us
[14:02] in the preaching of your word. And Lord,
[14:05] by that you would meet the needs of your
[14:06] children. Father, I pray a special
[14:08] blessing upon our brother Jack, upon
[14:10] this family, upon this assembly. Dear
[14:12] God, I pray, Lord, that you would make
[14:14] ways out of no ways for them. Father, I
[14:17] pray you would give them their heart's
[14:18] desire. Oh God, Lord, they've stood here
[14:20] for many, many years faithful in this
[14:22] community, Lord. Father, holding up this
[14:25] end time banner, I pray Lord, you open
[14:27] the windows of heaven. And Lord, you
[14:29] pour them out a blessing that they would
[14:30] have not room enough to receive. And
[14:32] Lord, as we open your word, may you come
[14:34] among us tonight. And Lord, we'll be
[14:36] sure to give thee all the praise, all
[14:38] the honor, and all the glory. For it's
[14:40] in the wonderful name of our Lord and
[14:42] Savior Jesus Christ. We pray. And all
[14:44] the believers says, "Amen." And amen.
[14:48] God bless you tonight. We greet you all
[14:50] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We
[14:52] want to say it is a real honor and a
[14:54] privilege to be here tonight with you
[14:55] all. And we thank brother Jack for this
[14:57] opportunity to uh stand here behind the
[15:00] sacred desk and speak to you tonight
[15:02] from the word of the Lord. And we sure
[15:03] appreciate brother Jack, appreciate his
[15:05] friendship. And uh there's one thing
[15:07] about uh brother Jack, no matter how
[15:09] long we go without seeing each other, it
[15:11] seems like just pick up right where we
[15:12] left off. And we always enjoy our
[15:14] fellowship with him and the assembly
[15:16] here and you all. And amen. We thank the
[15:18] Lord for what you're doing for the
[15:20] message of the hour and your stand. We
[15:21] say God bless you all. Amen. We do want
[15:24] to bring you greetings from our church
[15:25] at home there. Our pastor, brother Matt,
[15:26] and the saints at Grace Tabernacle send
[15:28] their greetings. We're actually I'm on
[15:30] my way to Trinidad and it worked out the
[15:33] way we were uh traveling to come through
[15:34] here and see you all tonight. So, we
[15:36] thank thank the Lord for that
[15:37] opportunity. And I don't have my family
[15:39] with me this time. So, you all forgive
[15:41] me. But, uh we were last time we was
[15:43] here a family of three, but we're now a
[15:45] family of four. So, the Lord blessed us
[15:47] with a little girl. Haven Grace was born
[15:50] September 20th. And so, the Lord has
[15:52] been um the Lord has been blessing us.
[15:54] Our little boy Malachi fell and broke
[15:56] his leg on the 18th and Haven was born
[15:59] on the 20th. So, but by God's grace,
[16:01] we're here and Malachi's recovered and
[16:03] we're pressing on. So, we sure want to
[16:06] thank the Lord for his blessings
[16:07] tonight. And I know it's a Wednesday
[16:09] night. If you have your Bibles, we want
[16:10] to go to the book of Romans, the 12th
[16:12] chapter. the book of Romans uh the 12th
[16:15] chapter here tonight. I want to uh read
[16:18] the first and second verse and then I
[16:20] want to look in Ephesians chapter 6. I
[16:23] know Romans chapter 12 and verse one is
[16:25] a very familiar reading. Uh brother
[16:28] Brandham uses it in power of
[16:29] transformation. God's power to
[16:31] transform. In Romans 12 and verse one it
[16:35] says I beseech you therefore brethren by
[16:38] the mercies of God that ye present your
[16:41] bodies a living sacrifice. Now I think
[16:44] it's very astounding there that Paul
[16:45] does not say your soul but he says that
[16:48] you present your body a living sacrifice
[16:51] holy acceptable unto God. Now watch what
[16:54] he says. Which is your reasonable
[16:57] service and be not conformed to this
[17:01] world, but be ye transformed by the
[17:04] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[17:07] what is that good and acceptable and
[17:11] perfect will of God. Now in the book of
[17:13] Ephesians chapter 6, Ephesians chapter
[17:16] 6, I want to begin there in the fifth
[17:19] verse. Ephesians chapter 6 and verse
[17:22] number five. Paul here writing,
[17:26] he says, "Servants, be obedient to them
[17:29] that are your masters according to the
[17:31] flesh with fear and trembling in
[17:34] singleness of your heart as unto Christ,
[17:37] not with eye service as men pleasers,
[17:40] but as the servants of Christ." Now, I
[17:43] want you to notice this. Doing the will
[17:45] of God from the heart. How many wants to
[17:48] do the will of God from the heart?
[17:50] &gt;&gt; Now notice this. With good will, doing
[17:53] service as to the Lord and not to men,
[17:57] knowing that whatsoever good thing any
[17:59] man doeth, the same shall he receive of
[18:03] the Lord, whether he be bond or free. We
[18:06] ask Lord this evening to bless the
[18:08] reading of his word. As you can have
[18:10] your seats here this afternoon, I want
[18:12] to by the help of the Lord for just a
[18:13] few moments tonight. Uh if I would take
[18:15] a title, I want to speak to you on this.
[18:18] Doing the will of God. I've been a bit
[18:21] of a series there at home speaking uh on
[18:23] your reasonable service there from
[18:25] Romans 12. And I just uh this fell on my
[18:28] heart tonight. And I want to maybe pull
[18:29] it out here and speak to you for just a
[18:31] few moments here on doing the will of
[18:33] God. I I believe tonight that that
[18:35] knowing the will of God is one thing.
[18:38] Amen. But I believe doing the will of
[18:40] God is another. I believe it's important
[18:42] to know the will of God. But I believe
[18:44] it's important or more important. Amen.
[18:47] To know and to do the will of God. Now,
[18:49] Brother Ram will say in the believer's
[18:51] position in Christ, he said, now when
[18:53] you have a call from God, that doesn't
[18:55] altogether mean that you just jump right
[18:58] out and you're doing the will of God. He
[19:00] said, you have to find the will of God
[19:03] and you have to find the time of God to
[19:05] do it. So God has a will and God has a
[19:08] time for that will to be fulfilled.
[19:11] Again he would say Jesus said verily
[19:13] verily I say unto you that the son can
[19:16] do nothing in himself but what the
[19:18] father shows me. Now what I see the
[19:20] father doing the father shows me then I
[19:23] go and do it. Remember said in other
[19:25] words amen Jesus done nothing in himself
[19:28] until he saw amen vision of what the
[19:31] father said to do. Then he went and done
[19:34] it. He said that's Christianity. Amen.
[19:37] Is doing the will of God. I think that's
[19:40] powerful. Amen. That the prophet of God
[19:42] would actually would actually define.
[19:45] Amen. The entirety of Christianity,
[19:48] Amen, is doing the will of God. Again,
[19:51] and by faith Moses, he said, see, the
[19:53] real inspiration comes, Amen, by doing
[19:57] the will of God. See, whether it's just
[19:59] one or just a handful, whether it's a
[20:02] big church or a small church, it matters
[20:05] not. Whether he is a great eloquent
[20:07] speaker or just a man that hardly knows
[20:09] his ABCs, it doesn't matter. Amen. It
[20:13] depends on the message that he's
[20:15] bringing. Amen. Whether it's inspired by
[20:18] the word of God, amen, or it is inspired
[20:21] by intellectuals conceptions of human
[20:23] inspiration. Amen. So there is a human
[20:26] inspiration. Amen. And then there is a
[20:28] divine inspiration. And he said some
[20:31] people can be inspired because of an
[20:33] eloquent speaker or or they can be
[20:35] inspired because some man is trained. He
[20:38] said now that doesn't mean it's of God.
[20:40] Amen. It's only through God's
[20:42] everlasting eternal amen. Blessed word
[20:46] we can receive inspiration AND THAT IS
[20:49] GIVEN BY THE HOLY GHOST. AMEN. AMEN. I
[20:52] THINK IT'S powerful how the prophet will
[20:54] be speaking. Amen. of the prophets in
[20:56] the Old Testament. And he'll say, "Now,
[20:58] they were God's servants." Amen. They
[21:00] were doing the WILL OF GOD. AIN'T THAT
[21:03] POWERFUL? AMEN. THEY WERE NOT JUST
[21:04] WALKING around boasting about THE FACT
[21:06] THEY KNEW THE WILL of God. Amen. But
[21:09] they were doing THE WILL OF GOD. HE SAID
[21:11] THEY WERE DOING THE SERVICE of God.
[21:14] Amen. And therefore, they were
[21:15] misunderstood. Now, it's a powerful
[21:18] point here. He says, "Anybody that
[21:20] follows God is misunderstood."
[21:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. JESUS our Lord when his birth,
[21:26] amen, he was misunderstood. Jesus on the
[21:29] cross, you all remember when he's
[21:31] hanging there on the cross and the
[21:32] critics, AMEN, ARE WATCHING him hang on
[21:34] the cross and they scream out those
[21:36] words. If you be the son of God, Amen.
[21:39] then bring yourself DOWN OFF THE CROSS.
[21:42] The Reb SAID, "NOW, WATCH WHAT Satan
[21:44] said." He said, "That can't be the son
[21:46] of God. It just can't be. If it was THE
[21:49] SON OF GOD, HE WOULDN'T PUT UP WITH
[21:51] THAT." HE SAID, "BUT sons of God," HOW
[21:54] MANY SONS and daughters of God have I
[21:55] got here tonight? HE SAID, "SONS OF GOD,
[21:58] AMEN, PUT up with anything AS LONG AS
[22:02] THEY ARE KNOWING THEY'RE DOING THE WILL
[22:04] OF GOD." AMEN. AMEN. THEN THAT'S WHERE
[22:06] YOUR STRENGTH IS COMING FROM. AMEN. To
[22:08] keep on believing and KEEP ON
[22:10] PERSEVERING IS BECAUSE YOU DON'T JUST
[22:13] KNOW, AMEN, THE WILL OF GOD, BUT THERE
[22:15] IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN QUICKENED IN
[22:17] YOUR HEART TO DO THE WILL of God. Now
[22:20] when I when I think there in Romans 12 I
[22:22] if it's okay I want to share it to you
[22:24] uh from the Amplified Bible in Romans 12
[22:26] and verse one it says therefore amen I
[22:29] urge you brothers and sisters by the
[22:32] mercies of God to PRESENT YOUR BODIES
[22:35] DEDICATING ALL OF YOURSELVES AMEN SET
[22:38] APART AS A LIVING SACRIFICE holy and
[22:41] well pleasing to God listen which is
[22:44] your rational Amen logical intelligent
[22:48] act of worship. Amen. So your reasonable
[22:51] service then, Amen, is your rational,
[22:54] LOGICAL, INTELLIGENT, AMEN, act of
[22:57] worship. Now look at verse two. AND DO
[22:59] NOT BE CONFORMED to this world any
[23:01] longer with its superficial values and
[23:04] customs, but be transformed, amen, and
[23:08] listen, and progressively changed, amen,
[23:11] as you mature spiritually by the
[23:13] renewing of your mind, FOCUSING, AMEN,
[23:17] ON GODLY VALUES AND ETHICAL ATTITUDES.
[23:20] So that you MAY PROVE FOR YOURSELVES,
[23:22] AMEN, WHAT THE WILL OF GOD IS, that
[23:25] which is good and acceptable, amen, and
[23:28] perfect in his plan and his purpose for
[23:31] you. Amen. I WANT TO TELL YOU TONIGHT,
[23:33] GOD HAS A PLAN. AMEN. AND GOD HAS A
[23:36] PURPOSE FOR EVERY ONE OF HIS CHILDREN.
[23:39] AMEN. I think IT'S POWERFUL HOW PAUL,
[23:41] AMEN, WILL SAY, "WE are transformed."
[23:43] And then in that translation, it says,
[23:45] "We are transformed." Amen. and
[23:48] progressively changed. Amen. As you are
[23:51] maturing spiritually now in things of
[23:53] our to be, the prophet OF GOD SAID,
[23:55] "AMEN. YOU HAD A BIRTH, RIGHT?" AMEN.
[23:58] But then YOU GREW FROM THAT BIRTH. When
[24:00] you was born and presented into this
[24:02] world, he said God knew that you were
[24:05] going to be here. Amen. In this earth
[24:08] and you grow from birth to maturity.
[24:11] Amen. Things that seem strange to you.
[24:14] Amen. in your young womanhood and your
[24:16] young boyhood. AMEN. AS CHILDREN, IT NOW
[24:19] SEEMS VERY REAL. He said, YOU COULDN'T
[24:22] UNDERSTAND IT WHEN you was a child.
[24:24] AMEN. BUT NOW, AS YOU BECOME AN ADULT,
[24:27] AMEN, you begin TO UNDERSTAND AND FIND
[24:30] OUT THAT EVERYTHING was just set just
[24:32] right. It really means SOMETHING TO YOU
[24:35] NOW. HE SAID, "SO IT IS IN YOUR
[24:37] spiritual birth." He said, "YOU DO
[24:40] THINGS." SOMEBODY SAY, "DO THINGS."
[24:43] YOU DO THINGS THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
[24:45] WHEN YOU WERE A little baby, come to the
[24:47] altar, YOU GIVE YOUR LIFE TO CHRIST, you
[24:50] do strange THINGS. AMEN. YOU WONDER WHY
[24:52] YOU DID IT. BUT AFTER A WHILE, WHEN YOU
[24:55] mature as matured Christians, AMEN. THEN
[24:59] YOU UNDERSTAND IT. AMEN. NOW, DON'T EVER
[25:01] FORGET THAT THERE IS a birth. Amen. And
[25:04] then there is an adoption COMING TO THAT
[25:06] BIRTH. AMEN. WE'RE NOT JUST TO BE BORN
[25:09] AND TO REMAIN BABES IN CHRIST. AMEN. BUT
[25:12] PAUL SAID WE WOULD GROW UP IN HIM AND
[25:14] THAT we would be able to receive, AMEN,
[25:17] THE MEAT of the WORD OF GOD. NOW, AMEN.
[25:20] I'LL SAY THIS. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY,
[25:22] AMEN, THAT A baby can go from infancy to
[25:24] maturity. DO YOU KNOW HOW THAT IS? HE
[25:27] CANNOT BUY HIS WAY FROM INFANCY TO
[25:29] MATURITY. HE CANNOT SHOUT HIS WAY FROM
[25:32] INFANCY TO MATURITY. THERE'S ONLY ONE
[25:35] WAY TO GO FROM INFANCY INTO MATURITY,
[25:38] AND THAT IS TO BE WILLING TO LEARN.
[25:41] AMEN. NOW I KNOW THAT'S A HEY A THEN
[25:42] THAT'S NOT A SHOUTING POINT BUT it's a
[25:44] truth. THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID WE GOT TO
[25:47] COME SAINELY and sound to God. AND WHEN
[25:50] WE COME WITHOUT ANY MALICE ANY PREJUDICE
[25:53] WITH AN OPEN HEART. HE SAID WILLING TO
[25:56] LEARN. NOW LISTEN. AMEN. GOD IS ABLE TO
[25:59] teach when we are WILLING TO LEARN. GOD
[26:03] IS ABLE TO TEACH when we are willing to
[26:06] learn. He said BUT WE MUST FIRST LAY
[26:09] ASIDE TRADITION. HOW MANY WANTS to do
[26:11] that? WE MUST LAY ASIDE TRADITION. WE
[26:14] MUST LAY ASIDE IDEAS, AMEN, that we have
[26:17] BEEN TAUGHT. NOW, I THINK IT'S POWERFUL.
[26:19] THE PROPHET IDENTIFIES SOMETHING. AMEN.
[26:21] YOU CAN BE TAUGHT SOMETHING AND WHAT
[26:23] YOU'VE BEEN TAUGHT CAN BE STUNNING YOUR
[26:25] GROWTH. AMEN. BUT IF you can lay it
[26:28] ASIDE AND COME BACK TO THE ORIGINAL
[26:31] TEACHER, which is the spirit of truth,
[26:34] AND HAVE AN OPEN HEART, HE WILL BEGIN TO
[26:36] LEARN. YOU WILL BEGIN TO grow from
[26:38] infancy to maturity. Amen. Now, there's
[26:41] a big difference here. Amen. In a baby
[26:43] and an adult, right? AMEN. A BABY HAS NO
[26:46] RESPONSIBILITY. AMEN. A BABY HAS NO HAS
[26:50] NO PRESSURES. AMEN. AMEN. But an adult,
[26:52] you've probably heard me use the example
[26:54] before, but I'll just use it again.
[26:56] Amen. I'll tell you the DIFFERENCE IN A
[26:57] CHILD AND A MAN. YOU KNOW, PAUL SAID THE
[27:00] time would come THAT WE WOULD LAY ASIDE
[27:02] CHILDISH THINGS, RIGHT? AND WE WOULD PUT
[27:04] ON OR WE would become men in Christ.
[27:07] Now, uh you take a child, that child
[27:09] WAKES UP ON ON uh say Monday morning and
[27:12] he's got a little sniffle in the nose
[27:13] and a little sore throat and he don't
[27:15] feel THE BEST. WELL, HE'LL JUST GO IN
[27:17] THERE AND TELL MAMA, "I'm not going to
[27:18] go to school." And she'll call down the
[27:20] schoolhouse and say, "Junior's not
[27:22] coming in." Amen. He don't feel well.
[27:24] And he'll go back to bed. Amen. Now, now
[27:27] what is resting on his shoulders? He
[27:30] might miss A LESSON. HE MIGHT MISS
[27:32] PLAYTIME. HE MIGHT MISS A A A LUNCH OR
[27:35] SOMETHING. AMEN. BUT YOU TAKE A MAN THAT
[27:38] WAKES UP ON MONDAY morning with the
[27:39] sniffles and the sore throat. Amen. He
[27:42] can't just go lay down. AMEN. BECAUSE
[27:44] THERE'S A HOUSE PAYMENT RESTING. AMEN.
[27:47] THERE'S MOUTHS TO BE FED. THERE'S BILLS
[27:49] TO BE PAID. AMEN. DO YOU SEE THE
[27:51] DIFFERENCE IN CHILDHOOD AND MATURITY IS
[27:54] WHEN YOU'RE ABLE TO ACCEPT THE
[27:56] RESPONSIBILITY AND TO DO WHAT GOD HAS
[27:59] CALLED YOU TO DO? I THINK IT'S TIME,
[28:01] AMEN, THAT WE GET SOME MATURE SONS AND
[28:03] DAUGHTERS OF GOD. AMEN. THAT SAID, I
[28:05] DON'T JUST WANT TO WALK AROUND AND SAY,
[28:08] I KNOW THE WILL OF GOD. I WANT TO WALK
[28:10] AS A SON OF GOD, AS A DAUGHTER OF GOD.
[28:13] AMEN. MANIFESTING THE WILL OF GOD IN THE
[28:16] AGE that I'm living in.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; I don't just want to WALK AROUND, AMEN,
[28:21] AND TALK ABOUT KNOWING A GOD THAT HEALS.
[28:23] AMEN. Thank you, brother Jack. AMEN. BUT
[28:25] I WANT TO STAND AS A WITNESS. AMEN. IS
[28:28] ONE WHO HAS DONE AMEN THE WILL OF GOD.
[28:30] AMEN. I think it's powerful in Matthew
[28:32] the 24th chapter and the 46th verse
[28:35] Jesus said these words. He said blessed
[28:38] is that servant WHOM HIS LORD WHEN HE
[28:42] COMETH SHALL FIND SO DOING. AMEN. Look
[28:45] at this word doing. IT MEANS TO ACT
[28:48] RIGHTLY. It means to do well. It means
[28:51] to carry out to execute. In 1961, THE
[28:56] PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "AND WE ARE HIS
[28:58] SERVANTS." AMEN. And are carrying out
[29:01] his commission. Again, in ' 62, he said,
[29:04] "And we're only carrying out his wishes
[29:09] &gt;&gt; and his commandments." Now I THINK IT'S
[29:12] POWERFUL WHEN BROTHER PREACHES GOD'S
[29:14] POWER TO TRANSFORM IN paragraph 256 he
[29:17] says oh wondering SONS DEFORMED BY THE
[29:20] CREEPERS of this earth WONDERING SISTERS
[29:22] THAT THE PLACES AND FASHIONS OF THIS
[29:25] WORLD amen has drawled YOU AND SISTER
[29:27] DEAR YOU MIGHT CONSIDER ME AN OLD CRANK
[29:30] BUT ONE OF THESE DAYS when you meet what
[29:32] Florence Shakarian met the OTHER NIGHT
[29:34] SHE SAT IN THIS ROOM in this place as
[29:37] you know when you meet that you will
[29:39] find out THAT NOT ME BUT THIS WORD is
[29:43] right. HE SAID KEEP OUT OF THOSE BARBER
[29:46] SHOPS. AMEN. KEEP OUT OF THOSE FASHION
[29:48] SHOPS. KEEP OUT OF THOSE THINGS. YOU SAY
[29:51] WHY DON'T YOU TEACH THEM GREAT things
[29:53] how to BE THIS. HE SAID JUST START WITH
[29:56] YOUR ABCS AND then we'll come to
[29:59] algebra. JUST START LEARNING WHICH IS
[30:03] YOUR REASONABLE SERVICE. NOW I THINK
[30:05] IT'S POWERFUL. AMEN. WE GOT PEOPLE
[30:07] WALKING AROUND. AMEN. THAT KNOWS THE
[30:10] WILL OF GOD ON HOW A WOMAN OUGHT TO
[30:12] DRESS. AMEN. AND THEY'RE PAINTING THEIR
[30:14] NAILS AND PAINTING THEIR FACES. WELL, WE
[30:16] MIGHT AS WELL PREACH WE'RE HERE. AMEN.
[30:18] MEN WALKING AROUND. AMEN. SAYS, "We know
[30:21] the will OF GOD. WE KNOW THE MYSTERIES
[30:23] OF GOD." AMEN. AND CAN'T EVEN PROVIDE
[30:25] FOR THEIR FAMILIES. AND I DON'T I DON'T
[30:28] MEAN TO GET UGLY, but I'm just preaching
[30:29] something FROM MY HEART. AMEN. IT'S an
[30:31] age where MEN HAVE LAID ASIDE
[30:34] RESPONSIBILITY. AMEN. AND WOMEN ARE
[30:36] HAVING TO DO THE PRAYING. AND WOMEN are
[30:39] having TO DO THE FASTING. AMEN. I THINK
[30:41] IT'S TIME TO COME BACK. AMEN. TO THE OLD
[30:43] LANDMARK OF THE BIBLE. AMEN. IT'S NOT
[30:46] ENOUGH JUST TO KNOW THE WILL OF GOD FOR
[30:48] A HOME. YOU GOT TO RAISE UP AND DO THE
[30:50] WILL OF GOD FOR THAT HOME. YES, SIR.
[30:53] JUST DO YOUR REASONABLE SERVICE. AND I
[30:56] LOVE WHAT A PROPHET SAID. HE SAID, "AND
[30:58] GOD WILL take care of the rest of it."
[31:00] AMEN. JUST DO. AMEN. JUST REASON THE
[31:03] THINGS. AMEN. THAT YOU CAN REASON OUT
[31:05] AND DO IT. NOW, I WANT TO SAY THIS VERY
[31:07] PLAINLY. What is reasonable TO GOD,
[31:10] AMEN, IS UNREASONABLE to the world.
[31:14] AND WHAT IS REASONABLE to the world IS
[31:17] UNREASONABLE TO GOD. NOW, I THINK IT'S
[31:19] POWERFUL THAT ANOTHER WORD FOR
[31:21] REASONABLE IS ACTUALLY ACCEPTABLE. IN
[31:24] OTHER WORDS, PAUL IS SAYING THAT YOUR
[31:27] SERVICE, AMEN, WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE. HOW
[31:29] MANY WANTS TO SAY, LORD, I WANT TO DO
[31:32] YOUR WILL, BUT I WANT IT TO BE ACCEPTED.
[31:34] I I DON'T JUST WANT TO DO SOMETHING.
[31:36] AMEN. BUT I WANT WHAT I'M DOING TO BE
[31:38] ACCEPTED. NOW look at this word service.
[31:41] It is the service and worship OF GOD.
[31:44] AMEN. ACCORDING TO THE REQUIREMENT of
[31:47] the Levitical law which WAS IN TO
[31:49] PERFORM, AMEN. SACRED SERVICES. NOW IN 1
[31:53] Peter chapter 2 and 5, you know this
[31:55] verse by heart. Peter says, "Ye also,
[31:58] Amen, AS LIVELY STONES." HOW MANY LIVELY
[32:00] STONES HAVE WE GOT HERE? AMEN. YOU ARE
[32:02] BUILT UP A SPIRITUAL HOUSE. AMEN. AND A
[32:05] HOLY priesthood to offer up spiritual
[32:08] sacrifices. NOW WATCH WHAT PETER SAYS.
[32:11] ACCEPTABLE TO GOD BY JESUS CHRIST. AMEN.
[32:15] BROTHER RAM COMES ALONG AND SAYS, "Go
[32:17] back to Cain and Abel." He said, "Cain
[32:19] worshiped. HE BUILT AN ALTAR. HE
[32:21] SACRIFICED. HE worshiped God." NOW, WAS
[32:24] HE DOING SOMETHING? HE WAS. BUT THAT
[32:27] WASN'T ENOUGH. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. HE
[32:29] SAID, 'NOW, as soon as Easter comes
[32:31] across the nation, there will be
[32:33] millions of dollars spent for EASTER
[32:34] FLOWERS, AND THEY'LL LAY THEM ON THE
[32:36] ALTAR. HE SAID, 'WELL, GOD DON'T care
[32:39] about that Easter flower on the altar.
[32:41] HE WANTS YOU ON THE ALTAR. HE AMEN.
[32:44] YOU'RE THE PERSON FOR THE ALTAR. AMEN.
[32:47] THE ALTAR IS NOT FOR YOUR FLOWER, FOLKS.
[32:49] AMEN. THE ALTAR IS NOT FOR YOUR MONEY.
[32:52] AMEN. HE WANTS YOU. NOW, HERE'S A
[32:54] PROPHET. THE ALTAR WAS BUILT FOR YOU TO
[32:58] SACRIFICE YOUR OWN WILL TO HIS WILL.
[33:01] AMEN. THE ALTAR WAS BUILT FOR A SON OR A
[33:04] DAUGHTER OF GOD TO SACRIFICE, AMEN,
[33:07] THEIR OWN WILL, THEIR OWN AMBITIONS,
[33:09] AMEN, THEIR OWN AGENDAS TO THE will of
[33:12] God. Amen. I think it's powerful. He
[33:14] said, "Now look what Kane done." He
[33:16] said, "Now that's why many of full
[33:17] gospel church is coming right into the
[33:19] same thing. They want to build a little
[33:21] better church or put a few thousand
[33:23] dollars in A PIPE ORGAN. LISTEN, THAT
[33:26] DOESN'T BRING GOD IN. AMEN. That might
[33:29] bring people, BUT YOU SAY, "PREACHER,
[33:31] THEN WHAT BRINGS GOD INTO AN ASSEMBLY?"
[33:33] BROTHER BAM SAID, "SELF-SACRIFICE
[33:35] BRINGS GOD IN TO THE WILL OF GOD?"
[33:40] &gt;&gt; NOW, that's a heavy one, y'all. I'm
[33:42] sorry. I know it's Wednesday night and
[33:43] I'm preaching at you, but I FEEL AN
[33:44] ATMOSPHERE. AMEN. BUT LET ME SAY THIS.
[33:47] SACRIFICE IS WHAT BRINGS GOD IN TO THE
[33:50] WILL OF GOD. NOW, I LOVE WHAT DAVID SAYS
[33:52] IN PSALMS 19:14. He says, "Let the words
[33:55] of MY MOUTH AND THE MEDITATIONS OF MY
[33:57] HEART." LOOK WHAT HE SAYS, "LORD, LET
[34:00] THEM BE ACCEPTABLE IN THY SIGHT, O LORD,
[34:03] AMEN, MY STRENGTH AND MY REDEEMER."
[34:06] AMEN. Then to BE ACCEPTABLE IN THE SIGHT
[34:09] OF GOD IS TO BE ACCEPTABLE IN THE
[34:11] PRESENCE of God. AMEN. NOW LOOK, WHEN
[34:14] YOU ARE ACCEPTED IN THE SIGHT OF GOD, IT
[34:17] OPENS A DOOR FOR YOU INTO THE PRESENCE
[34:20] OF GOD. AND YOU KNOW WHAT DAVID SAID? HE
[34:22] SAID, "IN THY PRESENCE IS THE FULLNESS
[34:25] OF JOY." AMEN. SELF-SACRIFICE WILL
[34:29] LITERALLY BRING THE PRESENCE OF GOD INTO
[34:31] AN ASSEMBLY. AND BY THAT SACRIFICE,
[34:34] IT'LL OPEN A DOOR FOR YOU TO STEP INTO
[34:37] JOY UNSPEAKABLE AND FULL OF GLORY. My
[34:41] when I when I THINK ABOUT THIS, HOW CAN
[34:42] I NOT THANK brother's sermon on trying
[34:45] to do God a service without being the
[34:48] will of God? He goes to 1 Chronicles 13
[34:51] and he says, "Do you see King David?"
[34:53] AMEN. HE'S BRINGING THE ARK OF THE
[34:55] COVENANT, AMEN. NOW, THAT was the right
[34:57] thing, right? He was bringing the ark of
[35:00] the covenant back, Amen. to Jerusalem.
[35:03] HE SAID, "NOW WATCH. IT WAS A PURE
[35:06] MOTIVE, BUT A WRONG METHOD."
[35:09] AMEN. PARAPHRASING, DAVID DIDN'T FOLLOW,
[35:12] AMEN. GOD'S INSTRUCTIONS. AMEN. NOW,
[35:15] GOD'S INSTRUCTIONS OR GOD'S METHOD,
[35:18] AMEN, WAS THAT THE LEVITES would carry,
[35:21] Amen, THE ARK ON THEIR SHOULDERS. NOW,
[35:23] BROTHER SAYS HIS INTENTIONS were good.
[35:26] AMEN. BUT GOD DOES NOT GIVE US MERITS ON
[35:29] GOOD INTENTIONS. THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY
[35:31] TO SERVE GOD. LISTEN, THERE'S ONLY ONE
[35:34] WAY TO SERVE GOD, AND THAT'S BY DOING
[35:37] HIS WILL AT HIS COMMAND. AND GOD BEING
[35:40] SOVEREIGN, THERE IS NO ONE TO TELL HIM
[35:43] WHAT TO DO OR HOW TO DO IT. HE DOES THE
[35:46] WAY HE knows is right. He said, now
[35:49] there's one great THING AGAIN ABOUT GOD.
[35:51] HE HAS NOT LEFT US NOW WITHOUT KNOWING
[35:54] WHAT'S THE TRUTH AND HOW TO DO IT. AMEN.
[35:58] GOD HAS NOT LEFT US HERE WITHOUT KNOWING
[36:01] HIS WILL AND KNOWING HOW TO FULFILL OR
[36:04] BRING TO PASS HIS WILL. HE'S A GOD THAT
[36:07] SPEAKS. HOW MANY BELIEVES GOD SPEAKS?
[36:09] AMEN. HE SPEAKS THE WORD and then he
[36:12] expects his children to BELIEVE IT AND
[36:15] THEREFORE HE KNOWS WHAT'S BEST. AND WHEN
[36:18] WE DO IT AND HOW TO DO IT, WE HAVE OUR
[36:21] IDEAS OF IT, BUT HE KNOWS. AMEN. NOW
[36:24] LISTEN, WE NOTICE GOD THEN, AMEN, WILL
[36:26] REVEAL HIS word in his own predestinated
[36:30] season. REB SAID, "HOW?" AMEN. COULD THE
[36:33] PENTECOSTALS know this message? Amen.
[36:35] SEE, HE REVEALS IT IN HIS SEASONS
[36:39] BECAUSE IT'S A SEED. ARE Y'ALL READY FOR
[36:41] THIS? AND AS IT GROWS,
[36:44] AS IT GROWS AND MATURES, he reveals
[36:48] himself. COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. THAT
[36:51] BABY MIGHT LOOK LIKE HIS FATHER, BUT HE
[36:54] DOES NOT BEGIN TO REVEAL HIS FATHER'S
[36:56] CHARACTERISTICS UNTIL HE COMES TO
[36:58] MATURITY. AMEN. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU
[37:00] TONIGHT, THERE IS A SEED ON THE INSIDE
[37:03] OF YOUR SOUL. AND IT WAS PUT THERE FROM
[37:05] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. IT
[37:08] WAS NOT PUT THERE TO BE A BILLBOARD OF
[37:10] PUFFED UP KNOWLEDGE. IT WAS PUT THERE TO
[37:13] BE SACRIFICED, AMEN, TO THE WILL OF GOD.
[37:16] THAT YOU WOULD BE A DIRECT REFLECTION ON
[37:18] EARTH OF YOUR FATHER'S WILL FROM HEAVEN.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; My to think ABOUT IT. THERE'S A SEED IN
[37:25] YOU. AND AS THAT SEED BEGINS TO GROW, it
[37:28] begins to mature. And as IT BEGINS TO
[37:31] MATURE, GOD BEGINS to reveal himself.
[37:36] Man, I wish I had two hours on that. AS
[37:39] THAT SEED BEGINS to grow, it begins to
[37:43] mature. And through the maturing OF THE
[37:46] SEED, GOD BEGINS TO reveal himself. He
[37:50] said, "NOW LIKE THE HEAT OF THE sun to
[37:52] open up when it's tender AND YOUNG,
[37:54] BRING IT OUT OF THE GROUND, THE SEED,
[37:56] then give it its leaves. It's another
[37:58] stage of the sun. HOT SUN WILL KILL IT
[38:00] if it's the ripening time." SO HE
[38:03] REGULATES THE sun and regulates nature
[38:07] to meet his word.
[38:10] He regulates the church, the
[38:12] predestinated, the bride to meet the
[38:15] season that they are LIVING IN. NOW I
[38:17] THINK THIS IS POWERFUL THAT GOD REVEALS
[38:20] THIS word in the season.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; All right.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Now watch this. And to whom HE CHOOSES
[38:27] TO REVEAL IT TO. NOW LOOK HERE. GOD
[38:30] CHOSE WHO HE REVEALS IT TO. NOW WHEN DID
[38:33] HE CHOOSE IT, BROTHER JACK? HE CHOSE
[38:35] THAT BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[38:39] NOW WATCH THIS. SO NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE
[38:41] THINK A CERTAIN PERSON IS QUALIFIED TO
[38:44] DO A CERTAIN JOB, GOD KNOWS WHO IS
[38:47] QUALIFIED FOR THE TIME AND the season.
[38:50] Are you ready for this? OR THE RIGHT
[38:52] TIME TO DO IT. LISTEN NOW. WATCH WHAT A
[38:55] PROPHET SAYS. NO MATTER HOW SINCERE OR
[38:58] WHAT GOOD MOTIVES or what of GOOD
[39:00] OBJECTIVES, HOW PEOPLE WANT THOSE THINGS
[39:02] and see the need of it, there is a will
[39:05] of God. Direct quote, THERE IS A WILL OF
[39:08] GOD TO BE CARRIED OUT IN these things.
[39:11] SO, IT'S NOT JUST DOING SOMETHING, BUT
[39:14] IT'S CARRYING OUT THE WILL OF GOD IN
[39:16] WHAT YOU'RE DOING. LISTEN, ANYBODY CAN
[39:18] SING A SONG, BUT I WANT TO CARRY OUT THE
[39:21] WILL OF GOD IN THE SONG THAT I'M
[39:23] SINGING. ANYBODY CAN PREACH A SERMON,
[39:25] BUT I WANT TO CARRY OUT THE WILL OF GOD
[39:28] IN THE SERMON I'M PREACHING. LISTEN,
[39:30] ANYBODY CAN build a church, but I WANT
[39:32] TO BUILD A CHURCH THAT'LL CARRY OUT THE
[39:35] WILL OF GOD FOR THE SEASON THAT CHURCH
[39:37] IS BEING BUILT IN. HEY, I MIGHT AS WELL
[39:40] PREACH I'M HERE. AND I WANT TO TELL THE
[39:42] DEVIL IN HELL THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO
[39:44] TO DEFEAT THE WILL OF GOD OR THE SEASON
[39:47] OF GOD OR THE TIME OF GOD.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; COME ON. AND I TELL YOU TONIGHT, SPIRIT
[39:51] AND TRUTH, YOU MAY THINK THAT SOMETIMES
[39:53] THAT GOD HAS FORGOT ABOUT YOU AND AMEN,
[39:56] YOU DON'T HAVE THIS AND YOU DON'T HAVE A
[39:58] BILLION AND YOU'RE HAVING TO BE. AMEN. I
[40:00] WANT TO TELL YOU TONIGHT, AMEN, THERE'S
[40:02] A LOT OF CHURCHES THAT HAD A LOT MORE
[40:04] THAN YOU HAD AND THEY STARTED OUT. AMEN.
[40:06] BUT WHERE ARE THEY TONIGHT? AMEN. BUT
[40:08] HERE YOU ARE AND YOU'RE STILL TOGETHER
[40:11] AND YOU'RE STILL BELIEVING AND YOU'RE
[40:13] STILL PERSEVERING. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE
[40:16] THERE'S A SEED ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR
[40:18] SOUL. AND THERE'S A WILL OF GOD TO BE
[40:21] REVEALED THROUGH THE SEED THAT'S IN THE
[40:24] BRIDE OF SPIRIT AND TRUE TABERNACLE. AND
[40:26] THERE AIN'T ENOUGH DEVILS IN HELL
[40:28] THAT'LL DEFEAT THIS CHURCH. SHE WILL
[40:31] PREVAIL BECAUSE GOD IS BRINGING HER INTO
[40:34] MATURITY.
[40:36] My when I THINK ABOUT IT, I'M NOT JUST
[40:39] HERE HAVING A SERVICE. I'M MANIFESTING
[40:41] THE WILL OF GOD.
[40:44] THERE'S A WILL OF GOD TO BE CARRIED out
[40:47] &gt;&gt; in these things.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Now, Hebrews 11 SAYS IT BEAUTIFUL. PAUL
[40:52] SAYS, "WITHOUT FAITH, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
[40:55] TO PLEASE HIM."
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Do you know where A LOT OF PEOPLE GET IN
[40:58] TROUBLE is they leave the will of God
[41:01] and start trying to please men.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; BUT LOOK WHAT PAUL SAID. FOR HE THAT
[41:07] COMETH to God must believe that he is
[41:11] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[41:15] diligently seek him. NOW LOOK WHAT THE
[41:17] PROPHET OF GOD SAYS. HE SAYS the only
[41:19] way for you to please God is to obey
[41:22] him. Now that's pretty clear folks. The
[41:26] only way to please God is to obey him.
[41:30] They that come to God MUST BELIEVE. NOW
[41:34] I GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU. WHAT IS FAITH?
[41:37] WE TALK ABOUT FAITH. WE SING ABOUT
[41:39] FAITH. WE PREACH ABOUT FAITH. BUT WHAT
[41:42] IS FAITH? THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID,
[41:44] "FAITH IS SOMETHING THAT IS REVEALED TO
[41:46] YOU THAT IS NOT YET, BUT YOU BELIEVE it
[41:50] will be." Amen. Faith is a revelation
[41:55] of THE WILL OF GOD. SO FAITH IS NOT AN
[41:58] EMOTION, SAINTS. AMEN. FAITH IS NOT A
[42:01] SENSATION. AMEN. FAITH IS a revelation
[42:05] OF THE WILL OF GOD. HE SAID IN THE
[42:08] CHURCHES TODAY, they don't even believe
[42:10] in spiritual revelation. They believe in
[42:12] a dogmatic teaching of SOME SYSTEM. BUT
[42:14] BY REVELATION, ABEL OFFERED unto God a
[42:18] more excellent SACRIFICE THAN THAT OF
[42:20] CAIN, WHICH GOD TESTIFIED HE WAS
[42:22] RIGHTEOUS. AGAIN, NOW FAITH IS A
[42:26] REVELATION from God. Faith is a
[42:29] revelation. It's a revelation. HE HAS
[42:32] REVEALED IT TO YOU BY HIS GRACE. LISTEN,
[42:35] IT'S NOTHING YOU DID. NOW, I KNOW WHAT
[42:38] YOU'RE THINKING. YOU'RE THINKING,
[42:39] "PREACHER, YOUR SERMON IS ON DOING THE
[42:41] WILL OF GOD, AND HERE YOU'RE SAYING,
[42:44] THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO TO RECEIVE the
[42:46] faith, WHICH IS THE REVELATION OF THE
[42:49] WILL OF GOD." HE SAID, "YOU DIDN'T WORK
[42:51] YOURSELF UP into faith. IF YOU EVER HAVE
[42:54] FAITH, IT'S GIVEN TO YOU BY THE GRACE OF
[42:56] GOD." NOW, I WANT TO SAY THIS TO YOU.
[42:59] YOU DIDN'T DO NOTHING TO GET IT.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T DO NOTHING TO GET IT, BUT
[43:05] ONCE YOU GOT IT, IT'LL CAUSE YOU TO DO
[43:07] SOMETHING.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? YOU DIDN'T DO
[43:11] NOTHING TO GET IT, BUT ONCE YOU GOT IT,
[43:13] IT'LL CAUSE YOU TO DO SOMETHING. WHAT'S
[43:15] IT GOING TO CAUSE YOU TO DO? IT'S GOING
[43:17] TO CAUSE YOU TO DO YOUR REASONABLE
[43:20] SERVICE. HE SAID, "SEE, YOU'LL FIND
[43:22] SOME, AND THEY'RE ALL GOOD PEOPLE. WE'LL
[43:25] SAY THERE'S SOME OF THEM THAT'S TRYING
[43:27] HARD to believe it. They're trying to
[43:28] work themselves into it. Just some CAN'T
[43:31] DO IT AT ALL AND OTHERS IT'S JUST BY
[43:33] GRACE. IT'S JUST GIVEN TO THEM. NOW
[43:36] THERE IS THE DIFFERENCE. Now let's
[43:38] separate the church from the bride. Is
[43:39] that okay?
[43:40] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "NOW THE CHURCH, THE BRIDE, are
[43:44] you ready for this? The rapture is a
[43:47] revelation to her.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; IT'S REVEALED TO HER. THAT'S THE
[43:53] REVELATION. THE TRUE BRIDE OF CHRIST
[43:56] WILL BE WAITING FOR THAT REVELATION OF
[43:59] THE RAPTURE. LISTEN, THE TRUE BRIDE of
[44:02] Christ WILL BE WAITING FOR THAT
[44:05] REVELATION OF the rapture. NOW, I DON'T
[44:07] HAVE TIME TO GO INTO IT. AMEN. BUT IF
[44:09] YOU IF you study the rapture sermon,
[44:11] AMEN. A LOT OF GUYS love to inject
[44:13] themselves there and say, "Now, see,
[44:15] that bride's waiting for that
[44:16] revelation." Brother's got to come back
[44:18] and he's got to set up a tent and he's
[44:20] going to ride a white HORSE OUT OF THE
[44:22] WEST. AMEN. JUST TURN A FEW PAGES OVER
[44:24] AND HE'LL SAY, "NOW, HERE IS THE
[44:27] REVELATION OF THE RAPTURE." AND HE TURNS
[44:29] to 1 Thessalonians 4 AND BEGINS TO SHOW
[44:32] YOU THAT THERE WILL BE A SHOUT WHICH
[44:34] WILL BE A MESSAGE WHICH WILL BE THE
[44:37] LIVING BREAD WHICH WILL BRING FORTH A
[44:39] BRIDE FOR CHRIST. HE SAID, "THEN THERE
[44:41] WILL BE A VOICE WHICH IS THE VOICE OF
[44:44] RESURRECTION." OH, BUT DON'T STOP THERE.
[44:46] AMEN. THEN THERE WILL BE A TRUMPET. COME
[44:49] ON, FOLKS. AMEN. LET ME SAY IT AS PLAIN
[44:51] AS I KNOW HOW. OUR REASONABLE SERVICE IS
[44:54] TO MEET GOD'S REQUIREMENTS. YOU SAY,
[44:57] "WHY ARE YOU SAYING THAT?" AMEN. BECAUSE
[44:59] WHEN IT COMES TO YOU DOING SOMETHING OR
[45:01] WHEN IT COMES TO THE WILL OF GOD COMING
[45:03] TO PASS, THERE'S TWO PARTS TO BE DONE.
[45:06] ARE YOU WITH ME? THERE'S YOUR PART AND
[45:09] THERE'S GOD'S PART. LISTEN, GOD HAS DONE
[45:12] HIS PART. LISTEN, WE ARE NOT WAITING FOR
[45:15] THE REVELATION OF THE RAPTURE. THE
[45:17] REVELATION IS ALREADY HERE. THE POWER OF
[45:20] GOD HAS ALREADY RETURNED. THE PRESENCE
[45:23] OF GOD HAS ALREADY BEEN RECOGNIZED, HAS
[45:26] ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED. HEY, HEAR ME
[45:29] TONIGHT. BROTHER, COME TO THE END OF
[45:30] THIS MESSAGE. And he said, "THERE'S ONLY
[45:32] ONE THING I CAN SEE BETWEEN her and the
[45:34] rapture is to lay in the presence of the
[45:38] son is the readiness of the church."
[45:43] &gt;&gt; SO, BROTHER JACK, IT WASN'T THE
[45:44] READINESS OF GOD. THE REVELATION'S
[45:47] ALREADY HERE. NOW, I'm just going I'm
[45:50] just going to preach TO YOU TONIGHT. IS
[45:51] THAT OKAY? AMEN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH
[45:53] IT?
[45:55] &gt;&gt; It's here.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH IT? AMEN. I'LL
[45:58] TELL YOU WHAT PAUL SAID IN COLOSSIANS
[46:00] 3:23. HE SAID, "WHATSOEVER YOU DO, DO IT
[46:03] HARDILY."
[46:06] &gt;&gt; NOW, don't get mad at me, but do you
[46:08] give your all in every service you come
[46:10] to? Oh my.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU STOP RIGHT NOW AND SAY, "FROM
[46:15] THE TIME THIS service started until this
[46:17] point in the meeting, I'VE GIVE MY ALL.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING I'VE DONE IN THIS SERVICE,
[46:23] I'VE DONE IT HEARTILY AS TO THE LORD and
[46:26] not UNTO MEN." LOOK HERE IN 1 Timothy
[46:29] 4:15. He says, "Meditate upon these
[46:32] things." LOOK HERE. HERE'S YOUR PART.
[46:34] GIVE THYSELF,
[46:36] BROTHER JACK. GIVE THYSELF HOLY TO THEM
[46:39] THAT THY PROFITING MAY APPEAR TO ALL.
[46:42] LISTEN, WE DON'T HAVE TO ASK YOU IF
[46:45] YOU'RE LAYING IN THE PRESENCE OF THE
[46:47] SON. WE CAN SEE IT BY THE MATURITY
[46:50] THAT'S BEING REFLECTED OUT OF THE SEED
[46:53] THAT'S IN YOUR SOUL TO MANIFEST THE WORD
[46:56] IN THE SEASON YOU'RE LIVING IN. LOOK
[46:58] WHAT JAMES 4:17 SAYS. He says,
[47:00] "Therefore, TO HIM THAT KNOWETH TO DO
[47:04] GOOD." THERE WE are again, "KNOWING THE
[47:05] WILL OF GOD. TO HIM THAT KNOWETH TO DO
[47:08] GOOD AND DOETH IT NOT, TO HIM IT IS
[47:12] SIN." NOW, FOLKS, WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN
[47:15] GET ALL TORE UP ABOUT SOMEBODY CUTTING
[47:17] THEIR HAIR or going to the movies or
[47:19] going to drink a beer or or or ADULTERY
[47:23] OR WHATEVER. WE WE can we can we can
[47:25] NARROW ALL OF IT DOWN. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
[47:27] A PROPHET SAID? HE SAID A A PROPHET SAID
[47:30] SIN IS UNBELIEF. HE SAID SMOKING'S NOT
[47:33] SIN. HE SAID DRINKING is not sin. HE
[47:36] SAID SIN IS UNBELIEF. HE SAID THE
[47:39] SMOKING IS THE ATTRIBUTE OF THE SIN. NOW
[47:41] COME ON CHURCH. IF THERE IS A PEOPLE ON
[47:44] THE EARTH YOU SAID BROTHER ANDREW WHAT
[47:46] IS SIN? THANK YOU FOR ASKING ME. BROTHER
[47:47] M SAID THIS. He said sin is REJECTING
[47:51] THE REVEALED WILL OF GOD. IF THERE IS A
[47:55] PEOPLE WHO CAN KNOW THE REVEALED WILL OF
[47:58] GOD AND CAN REJECT IT AND CAN BECOME A
[48:01] BILLBOARD FOR THE ATTRIBUTES OF
[48:03] UNBELIEF, THEN WHAT ABOUT THE LITTLE
[48:05] FAITH WOMAN? WHAT ABOUT THAT LITTLE
[48:08] ELECTED LADY WHO CAN RECEIVE THE
[48:10] REVEALED WILL OF GOD AND SHE WILL BECOME
[48:14] A LIVING MANIFESTATION OF THE ATTRIBUTES
[48:17] OF FAITH IN HER GENERATION. MY I'M
[48:21] SORRY. I'M I'M FEELING GOOD TONIGHT.
[48:24] AMEN. YOU KNOW WHAT PAUL SAID IN HEBREWS
[48:25] 10:26? HE SAID, "If we sin willfully,
[48:30] AFTER WE HAVE RECEIVED THE KNOWLEDGE OF
[48:34] THE TRUTH, THERE REMAINTH NO MORE
[48:37] SACRIFICE FOR SINS." NOW, I just want to
[48:40] lay some quotes out to you. Is that
[48:41] okay? BROTHER SAYS, "AFTER WE HAVE A
[48:44] KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH, WHAT WE OUGHT TO
[48:46] DO, AND THEN WE WON'T do it, WE CAN'T GO
[48:50] NO FARTHER WITH God
[48:53] until we do it." SEE, GOD JUST PRESENTS
[48:58] SOMETHING to us THAT WE SHOULD STOP THIS
[49:01] TYPE OF LIFE. WE SHOULD QUIT LIVING FOR
[49:03] the world and professing to be
[49:05] Christians. AND WE'LL CONTINUE RIGHT ON
[49:07] OUT IN THAT SAME THING. THEN WE CAN'T GO
[49:10] NO FURTHER WITH GOD. HE SAID THE PLACE
[49:14] THAT IT'S DONE BEEN REVEALED TO US. SO
[49:16] WE GOT TO STOP RIGHT THERE UNTIL WE MAKE
[49:19] THAT THING RIGHT AND THEN GO ON WITH
[49:21] GOD. FOR NOW LISTEN FOR THEN IS WHEN WE
[49:25] ARE BACK IN THE GRACE AGAIN. NOW CHURCH.
[49:28] AMEN. SOMETIMES THE TROUBLE IS COMING
[49:31] NOT FROM WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT FROM WHAT
[49:34] YOU'RE NOT DOING.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? BROTHER SAID, "BROTHER
[49:38] RAM, I DON'T DO NOTHING." HE SAID,
[49:39] "MAYBE THAT'S WHAT'S THE MATTER." THAT'S
[49:42] THE TROUBLE OF IT. LISTEN, IT'S MORE SIN
[49:45] NOT TO DO THAT THAN IT IS TO DO WHEN YOU
[49:48] KNOW TO DO BETTER.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, Y'ALL REMEMBER THE PROPHET OF
[49:51] GOD SAID, GENERAL GRANT, he said HE HAD
[49:53] A SOLDIER BOY AND THAT SOLDIER BOY WAS
[49:56] ON GUARD DUTY AND HE SAID, OH, HE SAID
[49:58] HE WAS OUT THERE AND HE SAID THE REBELS
[50:00] were across the river. Y'all remember
[50:02] the story? AND HE SAID THAT LITTLE BOY,
[50:03] HE GOT TO WALKING AROUND. AND BROTHER
[50:05] SOLOMON, HE GOT IN A DAYS. HE WAS
[50:08] picking flowers. AMEN. CUZ HE WAS
[50:10] DREAMING ABOUT HIS SWEETHEART that was
[50:12] back home. BUT REMEMBER SAID, "NOW
[50:14] WATCH." HE SAID, "NOW LISTEN." HE LEFT
[50:16] HIS post of duty TO PICK THE VIOLETS. HE
[50:19] DIDN'T MEAN TO do no wrong. AMEN. THEN
[50:22] AT THAT TIME, THERE WAS A SPY THAT came
[50:24] in. AMEN. AND WIPED OUT TWO OR THREE
[50:27] TIMES THE SIZE OF GENERAL GRANT'S ARMY.
[50:29] HE SAID, "WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?" THE BOY
[50:31] CAME BACK ON THE POST OF DUTY
[50:35] &gt;&gt; NOT KNOWING WHAT HAD HAPPENED. BUT THE
[50:38] SPY HAD ALREADY BEEN THERE. AND WHAT
[50:41] HAPPENED? THEY STORMED ACROSS THE RIVER,
[50:44] &gt;&gt; DROVE THEM PLUM BACK UP INTO THE STATE,
[50:47] AND THAT BOY WAS SHOT AN HOUR LATER.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THEY DIDN'T HAVE NO OBJECTION TO
[50:54] HIM PICKING THE VIOLENCE. IT WASN'T WHAT
[50:56] HE HAD DONE. IT WAS THE THING HE DIDN'T
[50:59] DO. NOW, NOW COME ON. AMEN. YOU SAY,
[51:02] "WELL, I'M TIRED OF BROTHER JACK." AMEN.
[51:04] ALL TIME PREACHING ON ME FOR GOING ON
[51:06] VACATION. WELL, HE'S NOT PREACHING ON
[51:08] YOU FOR GOING ON VACATION. HE'S
[51:10] PREACHING BECAUSE YOU'RE LEAVING THINGS
[51:12] UNDONE THAT YOU THINK VACATION'S GOING
[51:15] TO FIX. COME ON. COME. OH, GOD. I'VE
[51:18] SEEN IT, RIGHT? I' I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN
[51:20] AROUND A FEW DAYS. I'VE SEEN IT. I'VE
[51:22] SEEN PEOPLE GET IN BAD SITUATIONS AND
[51:24] THEN ALL THE SUDDEN WHEN THEY WHEN ALL
[51:26] THE PRESSURE IS ON AND ALL THE TROUBLE
[51:28] STIRRING, THEY PACK UP AND GO TO DISNEY
[51:30] WORLD OR PACK UP AND GO TO THE BEACH or
[51:33] miss church FOR A MONTH. LISTEN, WHEN
[51:34] THE BATTLE IS HOT AND HEAVY, WHEN THE
[51:36] HEAT IS ON, THAT AIN'T THE TIME TO PACK
[51:39] UP AND RUN TO THE OCEAN. THAT'S THE TIME
[51:41] TO RUN TO THE CHRIST. RUN TO THE ALTAR
[51:44] AND LET THE POWER OF GOD FIX THE PRO.
[51:46] LISTEN, OH GOD, is this okay, BROTHER
[51:49] JACK? WE AIN'T PREACHING AGAINST
[51:51] VACATION. WE'RE SAYING GET THE THING
[51:53] FIXED AND THEN GO ON THE VACATION.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Oh God. I I remember one time I was a
[52:00] pastor called me and he was having a
[52:02] situation. He was talking to me and I
[52:03] said, "Well, funny thing is, brother," I
[52:05] said, "That brother just just reached
[52:07] out to me and he's wanting to talk to
[52:08] me." And I said, "I was fishing to call
[52:10] you." I said, "Cuz I want to know if I
[52:12] had your permission to talk to him." He
[52:13] said, "Brother Andrew, talk to him. By
[52:14] all means, do what you can to help him."
[52:16] So, I met with a brother and I'm sitting
[52:18] there and he starts telling me, you
[52:19] know, well, the pastor's done this and
[52:21] the pastor's done that and the pastor's
[52:23] done this and the pastor's done that.
[52:25] And I finally just stopped him a second
[52:26] and I said, "WELL," I SAID, "WHAT ARE
[52:28] YOU going to do?"
[52:29] &gt;&gt; "What are you going to do?" HE SAID,
[52:31] "WELL, I'M JUST GOING TO go over here to
[52:32] this church for a while." And he SAID,
[52:34] "I'M GOING TO take a break." He said,
[52:36] "AND I'LL COME BACK WHEN I THINK THINGS
[52:38] are good." I SAID, "SO, WHEN DID WE
[52:39] START TAKING BREAKS?"
[52:43] &gt;&gt; COME ON. COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. THERE
[52:45] WOULDN'T BE A SPIRIT AND TRUTH
[52:46] TABERNACLE IF JACK DOVE TOOK A BREAK
[52:49] EVERY TIME SOMETHING WENT WRONG.
[52:51] I'M JUST PREACHING. THERE WOULDN'T BE A
[52:54] CHURCH HERE IF THE PREACHER, AMEN, JUST
[52:56] PACKED UP AND WENT ON VACATION AT EVERY
[52:59] LITTLE PROBLEM AND EVERY LITTLE TROUBLE
[53:01] THAT COME THROUGH. LISTEN, IF YOU'RE
[53:02] PACKING UP AND RUNNING, IT'S BECAUSE
[53:04] YOU'VE NOT COME TO MATURITY. BUT IF
[53:07] YOU'VE GROWN FROM INFANCY TO MATURITY,
[53:10] THEN YOU WILL STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
[53:12] BATTLE UNDER THE PRESENCE OF THE
[53:14] CORRECTION OF THE SON OF GOD AND SAY,
[53:16] "LORD, BREAK ALL THE GREENNESS OUT. I
[53:20] DON'T WANT TO BE A BABY. I WANT TO BE A
[53:22] MATURE SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD."
[53:27] &gt;&gt; It wasn't what he done.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; It was what HE DIDN'T DO.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; NOW, HE DIDN'T STAND ON HIS POST OF
[53:34] DUTY. HE DIDN'T GUARD THE POST LIKE HE
[53:37] WAS SUPPOSED TO. NOW, I JUST GOT TO BE
[53:40] HONEST WITH you folks and and y'all just
[53:42] give me some GRACE TONIGHT. I FOUND THAT
[53:44] WHEN TROUBLE ARISES, PEOPLE JUST
[53:47] automatically become spiritually lazy.
[53:51] Y'ALL EVER SEEN THAT?
[53:52] &gt;&gt; THEY JUST THEY JUST BECOME JUST BECOME
[53:55] SPIRITUAL LAZY. AND I GOT TO LOOKING IN
[53:57] THE BIBLE, AND Y'ALL FORGIVE ME, BUT IN
[53:59] PROVERBS 13:4, THE BIBLE SAYS, "THE SOUL
[54:02] OF THE SLUGGER." NOW, I looked up that
[54:04] word slugard. IT MEANS LAZY. THE SOUL OF
[54:08] THE SLUGARD DESIRETH
[54:11] AND HATH NOTHING. BUT THE SOUL OF THE
[54:15] DILIGENT SHALL BE MADE FAT. NOW, YOU
[54:19] KNOW WHAT THAT WORD FAT MEANS? IT MEANS
[54:21] TO BECOME PROSPEROUS. LISTEN. THE SOUL
[54:24] OF A LAZY MAN WILL DESIRE FOR VICTORY
[54:28] AND WILL NEVER RECEIVE IT. BUT THE SOUL
[54:30] OF THE DILIGENT SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD
[54:33] WHO HAS HAD A BIRTH AND IS BEING
[54:35] TRANSFORMED BY THE RENEWING OF THEIR
[54:38] MIND INTO THE MATURITY OF THE SONS AND
[54:40] DAUGHTERS OF GOD. THEY WILL BECOME FAT.
[54:43] AMEN. THEY WILL BECOME SPIRITUALLY FAT.
[54:46] THEY WILL BECOME PROSPEROUS. OH, I WANT
[54:48] TO TELL YOU TONIGHT, THAT'S THE REASON
[54:50] YOU'RE PROSPERING. THAT'S THE REASON
[54:51] YOU'RE OVERCOMING IS BECAUSE YOU FOUND
[54:54] THAT THERE'S MORE TO CHURCH THAN JUST
[54:56] SHOUTING. THERE'S MORE THAN JUST
[54:58] DANCING. THERE'S MORE THAN JUST EMOTION,
[55:00] BUT THERE'S SOME BATTLES TO BE FOUGHT.
[55:02] THERE'S SOME VICTORIES TO BE WON.
[55:04] LISTEN.
[55:06] COME ON. WHERE DOES THE GROWTH COME
[55:08] FROM? IT COMES IN THE VALLEYS.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; IT COMES IN THE VALLEYS.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; NOW, I FIND THIS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.
[55:19] YOU KNOW WHAT PAUL SAYS TO TIMOTHY IN 1
[55:21] TIMOTHY 5:13? He's speaking ABOUT HE'S
[55:24] SPEAKING ABOUT YOUNG ABOUT WOMEN and
[55:26] young ladies. AND HE SAYS, "NOW, AND
[55:28] WITH ALL they learn to be idol." Now
[55:34] y'all,
[55:35] y'all forgive me. Sometimes we we'll be
[55:37] driving down the road and we'll be
[55:38] listening to Brother Jack or Brother
[55:39] Smiley preaching here. I'll hear Brother
[55:41] Smiley sometimes say, "I feel the
[55:43] preacher coming on or I feel my help
[55:45] coming on."
[55:47] They learn TO BE IDOL. NOW, NOW DO YOU
[55:49] REALIZE YOU DON'T just become idol?
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Can I bring it down to street terms? You
[55:55] don't just become lazy.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; You learn TO BE LAZY.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; LOOK WHAT PAUL SAID. HE SAID THEY LEARN.
[56:02] THAT WORD LEARN MEANS TO LEARN BY USE
[56:04] AND PRACTICE. TO BE IN THE HABIT OF TO
[56:07] BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO. LISTEN. THEY LEARN
[56:10] TO BE IDOL. LOOK AT THIS WORD IDOL. IT
[56:12] MEANS FREE FROM LABOR.
[56:15] IT MEANS AT LEISURE. THEY'RE LAZY. NOW,
[56:18] THIS IS a I may need to hide on this
[56:20] one. THEY'RE SHUNNING THE LABOR which
[56:23] one OUGHT TO PERFORM. LOOK WHAT THEY'RE
[56:25] DOING. THEY'RE WANDERING ABOUT FROM
[56:27] HOUSE TO HOUSE AND NOT ONLY IDOL, BUT
[56:30] TATTLERS ALSO AND BUSY BODIES. AMEN.
[56:33] SPEAKING THINGS WHICH THEY OUGHT NOT.
[56:35] NOW LISTEN HERE, FOLKS. WE DON'T HAVE TO
[56:37] WE DON'T HAVE TO PUT THAT 50 YEARS AGO
[56:39] FROM ONE HOUSE TO ANOTHER. IT'S CALLED
[56:41] FACEBOOK TODAY.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; IT'S CALLED FACEBOOK. IT'S CALLED
[56:46] SOMEBODY SAYS A LITTLE SOMETHING TO THEM
[56:49] AT CHURCH ON THE PARKING LOT AND THEY
[56:51] DIDN'T LIKE WHAT THEY SAID. SO THEY GO
[56:53] HOME AND THEY WRITE THIS LONG FACEBOOK
[56:55] POST AND THEY GET EVERYBODY IN THE
[56:57] CHURCH ALL WONDERING WHO'S WHO HEARD
[56:59] THEM AND WHO OFFENDED THEM. AND BEFORE
[57:01] LONG THEY GOT A WHOLE TROOP. AMEN. I'LL
[57:04] TELL YOU WHAT THAT IS. THAT'S CALLED
[57:05] LAZY.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE SONING FROM THE LABOR THAT YOU
[57:10] OUGHT TO DO TO FIX IT. IT'S A LOT EASIER
[57:12] TO GO HOME AND TYPE IT UP ON THE
[57:14] COMPUTER THAN IT IS TO WALK OVER THERE
[57:17] AND SAY, "SISTER, WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY
[57:19] WHAT YOU SAID?" BROTHER JACK, WAS YOU
[57:21] AIMING THAT AT ME? OR DO YOU SEE?
[57:24] WELL, GLORY TO GOD, SOMEBODY.
[57:27] HALLELUJAH.
[57:28] ARE
[57:30] LAZINESS. LOOK WHAT HE SAYS. THEY WILL
[57:33] SHUN THE LABOR WHICH ONE OUGHT TO
[57:35] PERFORM.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; All right. Goodness.
[57:40] I will therefore that the younger women
[57:42] marry and bear children and guide the
[57:43] house and give none occasion to the
[57:46] adversary to speak reproachfully. Now
[57:49] look what brother Ram says. He says our
[57:51] home life is in a crisis. HE SAID IT
[57:54] SEEMS like the home life is RUNNING OUT
[57:57] INTO SHALLOW WATER. IT USED TO BE IN THE
[58:00] HOME THE FATHER THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE
[58:02] WOULD SAT DOWN IN THE MORNING. HE WOULD
[58:04] SPEAK with his family. THEY WOULD ALL
[58:06] TAKE OUT THE OLD FAMILY BIBLE. I pray
[58:08] this is okay.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; All right.
[58:10] They would read just a little bit and
[58:11] all GATHER AROUND THE TABLE AND HAVE
[58:13] PRAYER. YOU DON'T SEE THAT NO MORE. WHEN
[58:16] THE DAY WAS DONE, MAUL HAD THE DISHES
[58:18] WASHED AND THEY'D ALL GATHER IN AND THEY
[58:21] READ some more OF THE BIBLE AND THEY
[58:23] PRAYED BEFORE GOING TO BED. HE SAID,
[58:25] "NOW LISTEN, JUVENILE DELINQUENCY
[58:28] CERTAINLY WAS A HARD THING TO FIND IN
[58:31] THEM DAYS." HE SAID, "THE BOYS ALL WENT
[58:34] TO THE FIELDS TO WORK." NOW, I KNOW
[58:37] FOLKS THAT THIS IS old old fogy and
[58:39] oldfashioned. AMEN. BUT A PROPHET
[58:41] ACTUALLY SAID THAT YOUNG BOYS USED TO
[58:43] GET UP BEFORE 3:00 IN THE AFTERNOON.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; COME ON. AND THEY FOLLOWED IN THEIR
[58:54] FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS AND THEY WENT TO
[58:57] WORK. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE HE SAID? AND
[58:59] THE GIRLS HELPED MOM WITH THE WASHING
[59:01] DOWN AT THE CREEK. AMEN. THEY DIDN'T LAY
[59:03] IN BED TILL 5:00 AND ROLL OUT AND COME
[59:05] DOWNSTAIRS AND SEE WHAT THEY COULD FIND
[59:07] IN THE REFRIGERATOR. NO, THERE WAS A
[59:09] FAMILY VALUE THERE. COME ON, CHURCH. I
[59:13] THINK THERE'S MORE TO BEING MESSAGE
[59:15] BELIEVERS THAN JUST WALKING AROUND
[59:16] SAYING WE GOT THE REVELATION, THE
[59:18] MYSTERY. I THINK IT OUGHT TO BRING A
[59:20] REFLECTION OF THE DIVINE NATURE OF WHAT
[59:23] A PROPHET AND WHAT THE BIBLE SAID A HOME
[59:25] OUGHT TO LOOK LIKE.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Now y'all, I'm just preaching, okay? HE
[59:31] SAID, "BUT TODAY WE JUST PUSH A little
[59:32] button and the dishes are all done
[59:38] AND MALLS IN THE CAR AND GONE TO THE CAR
[59:40] party ratting around over the streets
[59:43] AND WORKS DONE BY A TRACTOR AND WE DON'T
[59:46] HAVE NOTHING BUT JUST A BUNCH OF LAZY
[59:50] IDLE PEOPLE AND HOME LIFE IS SO
[59:54] NEGLECTED TILL THE BIBLE IS LAID BACK
[59:57] TILL THEY WOULD HAVE TO HUNT FOR AN HOUR
[59:59] TO FIND ONE IN MANY HOMES IN AMERICA.
[1:00:03] FOLKS, THAT'S YOUR PROPHET. THAT'S MY
[1:00:05] PROPHET'S WORDS. BUT IT'S A TRICK OF THE
[1:00:07] DEVIL BECAUSE THE DEVIL KNOWS IF HE CAN
[1:00:10] BREAK THE HOUSE, HE CAN BREAK THE CHURCH
[1:00:12] HOUSE.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; NOW, COME ON. I DON'T CARE. I DON'T CARE
[1:00:16] HOW MANY MEMBERS YOU GOT. AMEN. THE
[1:00:18] STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH IS ONLY MADE UP
[1:00:20] BY THE STRENGTH OF THE FAMILIES THAT IS
[1:00:23] A PART OF THAT CHURCH. BROTHER JACK, I
[1:00:24] HOPE I'M NOT overstepping my bounds. I'm
[1:00:26] just preaching. ARE YOU HEARING ME?
[1:00:28] AMEN. BUT WHAT IT IS, IT'S A NEW CART
[1:00:31] IDEA. ARE YOU WITH ME? THAT'S THE
[1:00:34] PROBLEM WITH DAVID WAS THEY WERE TRYING
[1:00:36] TO BRING THE WORD BACK ON A NEW CART.
[1:00:39] BUT GOD DIDN'T WANT A NEW CART. HE
[1:00:41] WANTED THE OLDFASHIONED WAY. AND I'LL
[1:00:43] TELL YOU TONIGHT, THE WORLD IS TRYING TO
[1:00:45] RAISE OUR BABIES ON A NEW CART RELIGION.
[1:00:48] THEY'RE TRYING TO ESTABLISH OUR
[1:00:50] MARRIAGES ON A NEW CART RELIGION. I SAY,
[1:00:53] GOD, GIVE US SOME OLD-FASHIONED, HOLY
[1:00:55] GHOST FILILLED, FIREBAPTIZED CHRISTIANS.
[1:00:58] IT'LL FOOL AWAY THE NEW CARD AND SAY,
[1:01:00] "IF I'M LAUGHED AT, IF I'M MADE FUN OF,
[1:01:03] I'M GOING TO FOLLOW IN THE PROVEN WAY."
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; NOW,
[1:01:12] like a boy told me not long ago, he
[1:01:13] said, "Brother Andrew," I'm just
[1:01:15] preaching. He said, "Brother Andrew," he
[1:01:17] said, "I I there's just something about
[1:01:19] these messes girls. They just they just
[1:01:23] they I just can't get one." I said,
[1:01:25] "What?
[1:01:27] How old are you? He said, "Well, I'm
[1:01:30] 19." I said, "Where do you work?"
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, I don't have a job."
[1:01:39] I said, "Oh."
[1:01:41] I said, "WHO ARE YOU AFTER?" HE SAID,
[1:01:42] "WELL, I LIKE THAT sister there." I
[1:01:44] said, "Do you realize she's done
[1:01:46] completed college?"
[1:01:49] Now, I remember AS A YOUNG PREACHER
[1:01:51] SITTING IN A TRUCK WITH Juel Forny years
[1:01:53] ago. I remember just a young preacher
[1:01:54] sitting in the truck with brother Juwel
[1:01:56] and brother Juwel looked over at me and
[1:01:57] he said he said I'm going to tell you
[1:01:58] the problem is he said the spirit of ind
[1:02:01] I hope I'm not getting out of line he
[1:02:02] said the spirit of independence is
[1:02:04] creeping in around the ranks of this
[1:02:06] message and he said it won't be many
[1:02:08] more days and our young girls will get
[1:02:09] so justified in their CAREER AND THEIR
[1:02:12] HOUSE AND THEIR CAR THAT THEY WON'T NEED
[1:02:14] A MAN AND AS A YOUNG PREACHER I THOUGHT
[1:02:17] BROTHER JUA I THOUGHT BROTHER JUEL WHAT
[1:02:19] ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT BUT HERE WE ARE 15
[1:02:21] YEARS DOWN THE
[1:02:23] AND I'M LOOKING AT THE MATERIALIZATION
[1:02:25] OF WHAT THE MAN OF GOD SAID YEARS AGO.
[1:02:27] YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE IT'S AMERICA'S
[1:02:29] WAY. AMERICA HAS TORN DOWN THE ROLE OF A
[1:02:33] MAN AND HAS BUILT UP THE ROLE OF A WOMAN
[1:02:36] UNTIL THEY HAVE CROSSED THE ROLES AND
[1:02:39] NOW BOYS DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE BOYS AND
[1:02:41] GIRLS DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GIRLS. OH,
[1:02:43] BUT IN THE LAST DAYS, GOD PLANTED A SEED
[1:02:46] IN THE SOUL OF THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST
[1:02:49] WHO WOULD REFLECT THE WILL OF GOD.
[1:02:52] CONCERNING THE HOME.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; NOW, Abraham said, "Look, just like a
[1:02:58] husband takes a wife and says, "If
[1:03:00] you'll be a good woman, if you'll Now, I
[1:03:02] know we we can we can preach on the man
[1:03:05] not working and not taking care of
[1:03:06] things." But let's take a let's take
[1:03:07] another quote of a prophet.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Just like a husband taking a wife and
[1:03:11] saying, "If you'll be a good woman, if
[1:03:14] you'll take care of the house, if you'll
[1:03:16] be true to me, if you'll keep my clothes
[1:03:18] clean, if we have children, you'll be a
[1:03:19] mother them. If you'll do these things,
[1:03:21] I'll work till my hands bleed
[1:03:24] to make you a living if you'll do it.
[1:03:27] But then think, what if that woman turns
[1:03:30] out wrong? Now listen, lives lazy,
[1:03:39] brother man. Pretty straight, wasn't he?
[1:03:41] Won't work, WON'T DO NOTHING. THEN IT
[1:03:45] TAKES GRACE TO KEEP THAT FAMILY
[1:03:46] TOGETHER.
[1:03:48] WELL, I don't know why my husband don't
[1:03:50] want to come home and I I DON'T KNOW WHY
[1:03:52] HE ALWAYS COMES HOME WITH AN ATTITUDE,
[1:03:53] WELL, IF HE COMES HOME AND THE FLOORS IN
[1:03:55] HIS LIVING ROOM is dirtier than the
[1:03:57] floors he worked on all day.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; SEE, BUT THE SPIRIT OF THE NEW CART HAS
[1:04:04] COME IN TO REJECT THE REVEALED WILL OF
[1:04:07] GOD. FOLKS, I'M NOT TRYING TO BE MEAN.
[1:04:10] I'M TRYING TO BE HONEST. IT'S TIME WE
[1:04:12] REALIZE THIS MESSAGE HAS COME TO RESTORE
[1:04:15] THE STRUCTURE OF A HOME, OF A FATHER, OF
[1:04:19] A HUSBAND, OF A WIFE, OF A MOTHER, OF A
[1:04:21] CHILD. LISTEN, I'M OLD ENOUGH TO
[1:04:23] REMEMBER WHEN MAMA AND DADDY TOLD BABIES
[1:04:25] WE WERE GOING TO CHURCH, AND BABIES
[1:04:27] DIDN'T TELL MOM AND DADDY we're going to
[1:04:29] the ball game.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; But the new car has come in.
[1:04:38] Now, now, now when that happens, then
[1:04:40] the devil just opens up a whole another
[1:04:42] channel and says, "Well, if the p
[1:04:44] statistics of marriage is falling apart,
[1:04:47] then I'm a young person, then why even
[1:04:49] try to get married?" YOU KNOW WHAT THE
[1:04:51] PROPHET GOD SAID?
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "The fear of failure," listen
[1:04:55] to this. HE SAID, "WE FIND THAT GOD
[1:04:57] CALLED MOSES. HE CALLED HIM TO GO AND DO
[1:05:01] HIS SERVICE." LISTEN, ALL THE FAILURES
[1:05:04] AND MISTAKES MOSES HAD, HE SAID, NOW
[1:05:06] LISTEN, HE SEEN THAT GOD WAS WITH
[1:05:09] JOSHUA, COME ON. WHEN JOSHUA SEEN THAT
[1:05:13] GOD, RATHER WHEN IS THIS OKAY? WHEN
[1:05:17] JOSHUA SEEN THAT NO MATTER THE MISTAKES
[1:05:19] THAT MOSES MADE AND THE FAILURES AND THE
[1:05:23] BLUNDERS, GOD STAYED WITH HIM.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT THAT DONE? THAT RELEASED A
[1:05:29] CONFIDENCE IN MOSES. NOW, I JUST WANT TO
[1:05:32] SAY THIS TO YOU. AMEN. BECAUSE GOD GIVES
[1:05:34] US ELDERS IN ASSEMBLIES.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT JUST THERE TO BE THERE.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS? THE BIBLE
[1:05:43] SAYS, "MARK THE UPRIGHT ONE AND FOLLOW
[1:05:46] IN THEIR EXAMPLE." THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Y'ALL EVER NOTICE YOU CAN HAVE A HOLY
[1:05:50] GHOST FILILLED WOMAN IN CHURCH FOR 50
[1:05:52] years, 60 years, never cuts her hair,
[1:05:54] never looks like the world, sings
[1:05:56] praise, has a sweet spirit, AND AND AND
[1:05:59] AND THERE'LL BE 15 YOUNG GIRLS, AND
[1:06:02] THEY'LL NEVER ONE TIME TRY TO LIVE THAT
[1:06:03] LIFE.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU LET ANOTHER ELDER SISTER COME IN
[1:06:08] WITH SOME NAIL POLISH ON
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; OR SOME HIGH HEELS
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; OR SOME MAKEUP OR LIPSTICK, AND THEN
[1:06:14] EVERY YOUNG GIRL WILL START PATTERNING
[1:06:16] THAT. YOU KNOW WHY? AMEN. BECAUSE IT'S
[1:06:18] IN THE NATURE OF THIS WORLD TO PATTERN
[1:06:21] THE WRONG. I WANT TO SAY THIS. OUR
[1:06:23] ELDERS ARE NOT HERE JUST TO BE SET ON
[1:06:25] THE SIDELINES. WE OUGHT TO GO TO THEM
[1:06:28] AND SAY, "LISTEN, I WANT TO KNOW. I WANT
[1:06:30] YOU TO TEACH ME HOW."
[1:06:33] I TOLD OUR CHURCH BACK HOME THE OTHER
[1:06:35] NIGHT, I SAID, "WE GOT WE GOT PROBABLY,
[1:06:37] I DON'T KNOW, PROBABLY 10 OR 11 YOUNG
[1:06:38] MARRIED COUPLES WITH KIDS." AND I SAID,
[1:06:40] "GOD BLESS YOU." AMEN. YOU KNOW WHY?
[1:06:43] AMEN. BECAUSE THEY DON'T LET THINGS KEEP
[1:06:45] THEM OUT OF THE HOUSE OF GOD.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; NOW, I I just say this, y'all. Y'all may
[1:06:49] know I'm not mean to open up about our
[1:06:52] church, but it's just here. I was
[1:06:53] preaching there and I saw Brother Joe
[1:06:55] Reynolds and Sister Mandy uh Reynolds
[1:06:57] sitting over there on the side OF THE
[1:06:58] CHURCH AND I SAID, YOU KNOW, I SAID,
[1:07:00] WHEN THE GOING GETS HARD, I SAID, RATHER
[1:07:02] than taking the new cart WAY AND
[1:07:04] THROWING IN THE TOWEL ON MARRIAGE, WON'T
[1:07:06] YOU YOUNG COUPLES GO OVER THERE AND SAY,
[1:07:08] BROTHER JOE, TELL US HOW THAT YOU GOT
[1:07:10] THROUGH IT. SISTER MANDY, HOW DID YOU
[1:07:12] ALL GET THROUGH IT WHEN YOU BURIED THAT
[1:07:14] LITTLE BOY YEARS AGO? HOW DID YOU GET
[1:07:16] THROUGH IT A FEW YEARS AGO, BROTHER JOE,
[1:07:18] WHEN YOU SAW YOUR BABY LAYING DEAD IN A
[1:07:20] CAR WRECK? AMEN. LISTEN, MARRIAGE IS NOT
[1:07:23] ALL BLISSFUL ALL THE TIME. AMEN. BUT THE
[1:07:25] STRENGTH OF A MARRIAGE IS BECAUSE GOD,
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SAY IT AS PLAIN AS I KNOW HOW.
[1:07:33] GOD HAS RECEIVED OR HAS REVEALED A SEED
[1:07:36] IN YOUR SOUL AND THAT SEED IS THERE TO
[1:07:38] RESTORE the structure. Yes, sir.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother said this. Don't you let
[1:07:44] now and I'm I'm moving on. Okay.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; People say, "Well," he said, "I'm afraid
[1:07:49] God will leave me. I don't have much
[1:07:51] confidence about afraid to try." Now,
[1:07:53] these brother's words. "I'd rather be
[1:07:56] found a failure."
[1:08:00] Brother Solomon, am I reading this
[1:08:01] right?
[1:08:03] I'd rather be found a failure than too
[1:08:06] lazy to try.
[1:08:09] Yes.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Now, can I bring this to a point
[1:08:13] tonight?
[1:08:16] Overcomers are not lazy.
[1:08:20] You know what the pro of God said? He
[1:08:23] said, "You take a Christian supposed to
[1:08:24] be a Christian." He said, "You let the
[1:08:26] life of God go from him and the
[1:08:28] experience and the joy of serving Christ
[1:08:31] and living in a church where such is
[1:08:34] going on, he rottens twice as quick."
[1:08:37] Right? living right here. So if we are
[1:08:39] trying to follow the message of the hour
[1:08:42] or at least this part of the message, we
[1:08:45] should live constantly in the life of
[1:08:48] Christ. See, because if it don't, you
[1:08:52] lay around and you know that these
[1:08:54] things you're supposed to do and you
[1:08:56] don't do it. The Bible said, "He that
[1:08:57] knoweth to do good doeth not to him is
[1:08:59] sin." Then you become doy. You become
[1:09:02] rotten when you're separated from the
[1:09:04] life of God. Now here it is. So strive
[1:09:08] with all that's in you to stay in the
[1:09:11] life of Christ that you be fruit bear.
[1:09:14] Remember I said what is it? I'm I'm
[1:09:15] going somewhere. Okay. He said it's a
[1:09:17] promise. God made the promise. If
[1:09:20] everything comes lazy, then what are you
[1:09:22] overcoming? They overcome by the word OF
[1:09:25] GOD. LISTEN, YOU GOT TO OVERCOME
[1:09:27] SOMETHING. YOU GOT TO HAVE SOME
[1:09:29] OBSTACLES.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; And it amazed me. You know, people say,
[1:09:34] "Well, that couple made it and they had
[1:09:36] it so easy." YOU DON'T KNOW THE
[1:09:37] OBSTACLES THEY WENT THROUGH.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:09:44] Oh, God help us. I'm going I'm going to
[1:09:46] move on. Okay. PEOPLE THAT DIFFERENT
[1:09:49] WITH YOU AND FUSS WITH YOU AND TELL YOU
[1:09:51] HOLY ROSES AND THINGS, IT'S A TRIAL. IF
[1:09:53] YOU HAVEN'T GOT THAT, YOU'RE NOT EVEN IN
[1:09:56] THE BATTLE. CAN I SAY THIS TO YOU? BUT
[1:09:59] OVERCOMERS ARE WINNERS.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; CAN I SAY THIS? AND WINNERS ARE NOT
[1:10:04] LAZY. BUT WE'RE LIVING IN A GENERATION
[1:10:06] WHERE EVERYBODY IS A WINNER. I'M CLOSING
[1:10:09] RIGHT HERE. OKAY. EVERYBODY IS A WINNER.
[1:10:12] YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, PUT NO work in.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; STAY UP HALF A NIGHT PLAYING VIDEO
[1:10:18] GAMES. DON'T RUN, DON'T EXERCISE, DON'T
[1:10:21] CONDITION, EAT CRISPY CREAM ALL THE
[1:10:23] TIME, EAT MCDONALD'S, AND SHOW UP AND
[1:10:25] TRY TO RUN THE BALL AND OH, YOU'RE A
[1:10:27] WINNER.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Y'all know I'm telling the truth.
[1:10:32] Listen,
[1:10:34] PUT NO WORK OR EFFORT IN AND GET THE
[1:10:37] SAME REWARD AS SOMEONE WHO PUT THEIR
[1:10:40] WHOLE HEART IN IT.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; NOW LISTEN, THEY MAY HAND OUT
[1:10:43] PARTICIPATION TROPHIES IN LEODYSA, BUT
[1:10:47] THERE'LL BE NO PARTICIPATION TROPHIES AT
[1:10:50] THE MARRIAGE SUPPER OF THE LAMB. PAUL
[1:10:52] SAID, "KNOW YE NOT THAT THEY WHICH RUN
[1:10:55] IN A RACE RUN ALL, BUT ONE RECEIVETH A
[1:10:58] PRIZE?" LISTEN. SO RUN THAT YOU MAY
[1:11:02] OBTAIN. YOU KNOW WHAT PAUL SAID? HE
[1:11:04] SAID, "I LAY DOWN, CROSS MY ARMS, KICK
[1:11:06] MY FEET UP, DRINK A CUP OF COFFEE
[1:11:08] TOWARDS the mark of the pry.
[1:11:11] I press.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; I PRESS OVER OBSTACLES."
[1:11:18] It's kind of like, "Oh god, I'm getting
[1:11:20] trouble." It's kind of like reason
[1:11:22] church attendance has gotten so lazy.
[1:11:23] Just stay home and push play. Well,
[1:11:25] well, well, you don't have
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; There's no obstacles.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOBODY GOING TO GET YOUR SEAT IN
[1:11:36] YOUR LIVING ROOM, BUDDY. THERE'S NOBODY
[1:11:39] GOING TO GET YOUR PARKING SPOT IN THE
[1:11:40] PARKING LOT, SIS. BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:11:42] COME TO CHURCH,
[1:11:45] I didn't read it, but it's Hebrews
[1:11:46] 10:25, right above Hebrews 10:26.
[1:11:49] Forsake not the assembling
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; of yourselves together.
[1:11:53] And then Paul says, "And then there
[1:11:55] remained no more sacrifice to him that
[1:11:57] knoweth what to do good."
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; See, it's an age, and I I'm not I don't
[1:12:02] want to sound like I'm beating on you.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; It's an age where laziness has taken
[1:12:06] over.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Look what the Bible says, but overcomers
[1:12:09] have something to do. I want I want you
[1:12:10] to catch this right here. He that
[1:12:12] overcomemeth shall, somebody say,
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; shall
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; inherit
[1:12:18] all things.
[1:12:20] I will be his God and he shall be my
[1:12:24] son. Listen, so many says, "If the Lord
[1:12:26] will take this evil spirit from me from
[1:12:29] drinking or from gambling or from lying
[1:12:32] or stealing, I'll serve him." Bram said,
[1:12:35] "That's up to you.
[1:12:38] See, you got to do something, too. They
[1:12:41] that overcome shall inherit all things.
[1:12:44] They that overcome, you have power to do
[1:12:47] it." Brother Andrew, I just tell you, I
[1:12:49] I just If God will just take this
[1:12:51] depression away from me, if God will
[1:12:52] just if God will just take this
[1:12:54] depression away, if he'll just take it
[1:12:56] away, well, try getting up and raising
[1:12:58] the shades in the living room.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. It ain't It ain't It ain't
[1:13:05] deep, folks.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; RESIST THAT DEVIL.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; COME ON. REMEMBER SAID THAT I'M GETTING
[1:13:12] LONGWINDED. A MAN LAYING ON HIS BED
[1:13:14] DYING AND THEY PULLED THE SHADES DOWN
[1:13:16] AND BEGIN TO SING THEM OLD MOURNFUL DEAD
[1:13:19] SONGS. HE ROSE UP OFF HIS DEATHBED AND
[1:13:22] SAID, "HEY, WHO'S DYING, ME OR YOU?"
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "RAISE UP THEM CURTAINS AND
[1:13:28] SING SOME HAPPY GOSPEL SONGS." OH
[1:13:32] CHURCH, I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU WANT TO
[1:13:33] WHIP A DEVIL, RAISE UP THEM CURTAINS AND
[1:13:36] LET THE SUNLIGHT OF THE PRESENCE OF GOD
[1:13:39] COME BACK IN YOUR HOME. HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; LET THE PRESENCE COME ON. AMEN.
[1:13:44] SPIRITUALLY, AMEN. RAISE UP THEM
[1:13:46] CURTAINS TONIGHT AND QUIT FOCUSING ON
[1:13:48] ALL THE NEGATIVE. QUIT FOCUSING ON ALL
[1:13:50] THE NEGATIVE TALK AND ALL THE NEGATIVE
[1:13:52] NEWS REPORT. LISTEN, GOD HAS RAISED YOU
[1:13:54] UP FOR A PURPOSE. SPIRIT AND TRUTH, HE
[1:13:57] RAISED YOU UP FOR A PURPOSE. AND THERE'S
[1:13:59] A SEED INSIDE OF YOU.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; You see, God could not just push you
[1:14:04] through a little pipe
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; and pull you out on the other end and
[1:14:06] say, "Blessed is he that overcomemeth."
[1:14:08] You had nothing to overcome. You just
[1:14:11] pushed through. But you got to make
[1:14:12] decisions for yourself.
[1:14:15] If I had to make decisions for myself,
[1:14:17] so we show our faith and respects to
[1:14:19] God. Listen. Beam says it beautiful. He
[1:14:22] said, "God have mercy on these
[1:14:24] lazyhearted Christians. Become no good."
[1:14:28] Here it is. Here it is. Know so much
[1:14:32] about it and tell so little to other
[1:14:35] people. Listen as our musicians are
[1:14:37] coming. Leot see an age is loose folks.
[1:14:41] It's lazy. It's soft. Bre said this
[1:14:44] happy golucky joking sinful age of lust
[1:14:47] we're living in now. It's a wonder. God
[1:14:49] don't just say step back church. I'll
[1:14:50] liquidate the whole group. What an age
[1:14:52] we're living in. Listen, he will do that
[1:14:55] one of these days. We know that, right?
[1:14:58] There is going to be no spare in this
[1:14:59] because he's already someone died for
[1:15:01] those who wanted to escape. But he'll
[1:15:03] take those who was. I want to be one of
[1:15:06] them. He'll take those who was or has
[1:15:09] accepted Christ and become Christians.
[1:15:12] What is Christians? Doing the will of
[1:15:15] God. They will be taken out of the
[1:15:18] wrath. We are in that bride age, folks.
[1:15:21] We're under that fourth anointing. Let
[1:15:23] us stand to our feet tonight. We're
[1:15:25] under that fourth anointing, aren't we?
[1:15:27] It's that eagle anointing. Can I Can I
[1:15:30] just Can I just remind you here tonight?
[1:15:31] How many eagles have I got here? You
[1:15:34] know what a prophet said? He said,
[1:15:36] "Eagle's not lazy like a vulture."
[1:15:39] Listen, I believe I'm looking at some
[1:15:40] people tonight that will never become
[1:15:43] lazy, soft, lukewarm, slothful
[1:15:47] Christians.
[1:15:49] Don't Don't get mad at me, but I believe
[1:15:51] I'm looking at some spiritually fat
[1:15:52] people tonight.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Your soul is prospering.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; You're overcoming devils.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; I know that might not be politically
[1:16:02] correct to say, but I don't believe I'm
[1:16:04] looking at slugards tonight.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Said, "Did you ever see an eagle
[1:16:09] compromise?" No, sir. There is no
[1:16:11] compromising in him. Neither does a
[1:16:14] genuine Christian. He ain't soft. He'll
[1:16:17] hunt till he finds it. He'll find his
[1:16:19] meat. He wants fresh mana. He'll get
[1:16:22] down there and dig till he finds it.
[1:16:24] He'll fly higher and higher. If there's
[1:16:26] none in this valley, he'll raise a
[1:16:29] little higher because the higher you go,
[1:16:31] the more you can see. He says, "So, it's
[1:16:33] time for the eagles of this day." How
[1:16:36] many eagles of this day have we got
[1:16:37] here? It's time for the eagles of this
[1:16:40] day to get to flying higher. Dig into
[1:16:43] God's promises, not live on vulture food
[1:16:46] that's been killed years ago. Get out of
[1:16:49] it. Folks, I'm thankful for this end
[1:16:52] time word. I'm thankful that a prophet
[1:16:55] come and reveal to us by the preaching
[1:16:58] of the word the will of God. And I I
[1:17:01] want to say this, and I know it's a
[1:17:02] Wednesday night, and I didn't have time
[1:17:05] to go really deep in some of the areas I
[1:17:06] wanted to, but I just want to say this
[1:17:08] to you. Satan's doing everything he can
[1:17:10] to attack the structure
[1:17:13] of a family, of a home. Listen, where
[1:17:17] we're at right now,
[1:17:20] and and y'all forgive me, but but but
[1:17:22] five more years from now, we got a whole
[1:17:23] generation right now that don't know
[1:17:25] what church is.
[1:17:28] Do do y'all realize we got we got babies
[1:17:30] being raised told that your living room
[1:17:32] is a home church and church is just
[1:17:35] playing a tape in your living room. Do
[1:17:37] you realize if time goes on they'll
[1:17:39] never know how to conduct a service.
[1:17:44] Now you say bless God that must be out
[1:17:46] there among them Baptist. That's right
[1:17:47] here around the ranks of the message.
[1:17:52] Somebody's got to raise up
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; and say, "I'm an eagle.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to lay down here. I'm
[1:17:59] going to rise up." I wonder tonight, how
[1:18:01] many say, "Lord, thank you.
[1:18:04] Thank you for this message. Thank you
[1:18:06] for your grace." I wonder how many
[1:18:09] fathers here tonight can say, "Thank
[1:18:10] you. Thank you for the structure you've
[1:18:13] given me, Lord." I wonder how many
[1:18:15] mothers fifth gospels can say, "Thank
[1:18:18] you, Lord, for this message. Thank you
[1:18:20] for sending a prophet to reveal the will
[1:18:24] of God in home life. I wonder how many
[1:18:28] young people could say tonight, Lord, I
[1:18:30] want to thank you for allowing me to be
[1:18:32] raised under the family I'm raised in.
[1:18:35] Lord, I want to thank you for the for
[1:18:36] the principles I've been taught by the
[1:18:38] word of God by my mother and my father.
[1:18:41] Lord, I want to wonder how many members
[1:18:42] in this church could say, "Lord, I just
[1:18:45] want to thank you for a structural
[1:18:46] church. Lord, I want to thank you for a
[1:18:49] place where it's not a bunch of
[1:18:51] sluggered people coming together.
[1:18:53] They're not just laying around and
[1:18:54] desiring and getting nothing, but
[1:18:56] they're prosperous. They're facing their
[1:18:59] giants. They're facing their battles.
[1:19:01] They're facing their obstacles. And
[1:19:03] they're overcoming by the blood of the
[1:19:05] lamb and by the word of their testimony.
[1:19:08] Almighty God, we bow our hearts in your
[1:19:10] presence tonight. Father, your word is
[1:19:13] true. And Lord, no matter how unpopular,
[1:19:16] how unreasonable it is to the world,
[1:19:19] it's still reasonable to you. And
[1:19:22] Father, I don't believe there's one
[1:19:24] person in this service and the sound of
[1:19:26] my voice tonight that wants to be
[1:19:28] rejected by you. Lord, I believe every
[1:19:31] one of us, the desire of our heart is to
[1:19:34] be accepted in the beloved. that our
[1:19:36] praise, our sacrifice, Lord, our our
[1:19:40] work, our our carrying out of your will
[1:19:42] would be acceptable in your sight. Now,
[1:19:45] Father, I know Satan's attacking on
[1:19:47] every hand. He's doing everything he can
[1:19:50] to destroy the faith of God's elect. But
[1:19:53] I want to tell that devil tonight,
[1:19:54] Satan, you don't have enough. You don't
[1:19:57] have enough to destroy the faith of
[1:19:59] God's elect. You will deceive everything
[1:20:01] and everybody but the elect of God. Now,
[1:20:04] Father, I pray for every believer under
[1:20:06] the sound of my voice. I pray for every
[1:20:09] man of God, every pastor, every every
[1:20:11] preacher, every every officer of this
[1:20:13] church, every husband, every father,
[1:20:16] every wife, every mother, every child.
[1:20:19] Father, there's a seed inside of their
[1:20:21] soul. And Lord, the only way to serve
[1:20:23] you is by carrying out your will. And
[1:20:26] Lord, you put that seed there, desiring
[1:20:29] that seed to be a revelation of
[1:20:30] yourself. Now father I don't want to be
[1:20:33] a revelation of Leona.
[1:20:36] I don't want to be a manifestation of
[1:20:38] the new cart. Lord I don't want my home
[1:20:40] or my family Lord. I don't want it to be
[1:20:42] a manifestation of the new cart. Lord I
[1:20:45] want to be found standing up on the
[1:20:47] principles that our prophet taught us
[1:20:49] Lord. God help us tonight Lord. If the
[1:20:53] enemy is coming in with pressure and
[1:20:54] intimidation may the sons and daughters
[1:20:57] of God rise up as evils Lord. May they
[1:21:00] get to dig it in the message of the
[1:21:01] hour. May they get to dig it in the word
[1:21:04] of God. May they get to flying higher as
[1:21:06] the eagles of this day feeding on the
[1:21:09] unfailing body word of the son of man
[1:21:12] gaining strength over this leodysy and
[1:21:14] lazy condition. Lord, this social media
[1:21:17] is almost gripped the hearts of women
[1:21:19] and mothers. Father, mothers sitting
[1:21:21] around in nervous conditions, Lord.
[1:21:24] Father, coming from these from from
[1:21:26] comparisons, Lord. Father, I pray
[1:21:28] tonight if there be one mother here, the
[1:21:30] devil is trying to attack that woman
[1:21:33] that that fifth gospel's mind with some
[1:21:35] thought that you're not good enough,
[1:21:36] you're not a good mother because you're
[1:21:38] not like some social media influencer or
[1:21:41] you're not like some Hollywood star.
[1:21:43] Satan, I rebuke you in the name of
[1:21:45] Jesus. Our our little sisters are
[1:21:48] gospel-filled mothers. YOU HAVE NO
[1:21:50] RIGHT, SATAN. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT to
[1:21:53] identify the standard of our mothers by
[1:21:55] social media or by some standard of
[1:21:57] Leodysa. These are Holy Ghost fililled
[1:22:00] daughters of Abraham. I rebuke you, thou
[1:22:03] demon of nervousness. Thou demon of
[1:22:05] anxiety. I REBUKE YOU IN THE NAME of
[1:22:07] Jesus. Take your hands off of that home.
[1:22:11] Restore strength to my sister, Lord.
[1:22:14] Restore strength to my brother, Father.
[1:22:17] Oh God, grant us your grace. we pray.
[1:22:22] I wonder tonight how many could say, "I
[1:22:24] don't just want to know the will of God.
[1:22:26] I want to do the will of God as a
[1:22:29] service unto God in the name of Jesus."
[1:22:34] In the name of Jesus.
[1:22:37] And man, I tell you, God is in this
[1:22:40] building tonight. I don't have to lay my
[1:22:42] hands on you. I believe where you're
[1:22:44] standing right now, you can open your
[1:22:46] heart and say, "Father, I need a
[1:22:48] strength tonight. I need a grace.
[1:22:52] I need your mercy."
[1:22:54] You realize the world we're living is
[1:22:56] insane,
[1:22:57] but God has given a grace. God has given
[1:23:01] a mercy to this generation.
[1:23:04] Hallelujah.
[1:23:05] Hallelujah. Brother Bram said, "The
[1:23:08] world is totally one degree." I believe
[1:23:10] he said, "From insanity." One place you
[1:23:12] said it's insane. Listen friends, we're
[1:23:15] living in the hours. We're seeing the
[1:23:17] fulfillment. But God has put a seed in
[1:23:20] your soul to reflect his will. Oh,
[1:23:24] Brother Solomon, the the more I've been
[1:23:26] in this study and this series and going
[1:23:27] through these sermons and these tapes,
[1:23:29] Brother Jack, is just a scream. I don't
[1:23:31] know how many times I've just stopped in
[1:23:32] my little office and screamed out,
[1:23:34] "Lord, I want to do your will." That's
[1:23:37] my only desire in life is to do the will
[1:23:40] of God.
[1:23:42] and we say, "Lord, that's my desire."
[1:23:45] Amen.
[1:23:47] God bless you tonight, friends. We love
[1:23:49] you with the love of the Lord. I pray
[1:23:51] something's been said to bless you. I
[1:23:54] pray something's been said to encourage
[1:23:55] you. Amen. I I just say this to you
[1:23:58] young people, and I just fill my heart.
[1:24:02] Take time sometime and thank your
[1:24:03] father. Thank your mother.
[1:24:06] Thank him for raising you with
[1:24:08] convictions.
[1:24:09] was in a was in a store the other day,
[1:24:11] brother Jack, and there was a little boy
[1:24:13] about the same age as Malachi and me and
[1:24:15] Malachi were standing there waiting on
[1:24:16] my wife and she was over there shopping
[1:24:18] and this little boy just said something
[1:24:20] to his mother and she just turned around
[1:24:22] and God is my witness. The most filthy
[1:24:25] foul language come out of her mouth,
[1:24:27] cursing and swearing at that little kid.
[1:24:30] I couldn't believe it. A little
[1:24:32] three-year-old kid probably. I looked at
[1:24:34] Malachi. I said, Malachi, you go over
[1:24:36] there and thank your mother for raising
[1:24:38] you in the fear of God. Go give your
[1:24:40] mother a hug and thank her for being a
[1:24:42] Holy Ghost. You say, "Well, he don't
[1:24:43] understand it." He will one day.
[1:24:47] Friends, this message has restored
[1:24:50] biblical structure.
[1:24:52] Hey, you you love the Lord tonight. God
[1:24:55] bless you tonight. Brother Jack, would
[1:24:57] you come?
[1:24:59] If I've said anything out of line, the
[1:25:02] pastor can correct me. It's just in my
[1:25:04] heart. I want to do the will of God.
[1:25:06] Don't you? We love you with the love of
[1:25:08] the Lord. God bless you spirit and
[1:25:09] truth. Tabernacle.
[1:25:24] Oh,
[1:25:27] to thee my blessed
[1:25:32] Savior
[1:25:35] I
[1:25:36] sender
[1:25:39] all. Everybody singing. Oh, we're
[1:25:43] singing. I
[1:25:46] sder
[1:25:49] all.
[1:25:52] Oh,
[1:25:53] I
[1:25:55] surrender
[1:25:58] all.
[1:26:00] Oh,
[1:26:02] it's all
[1:26:04] to thee, my blessed
[1:26:09] Savior.
[1:26:11] Oh, I
[1:26:14] surrender.
[1:26:17] Come on, sing it one more time. Oh,
[1:26:20] hallelujah. I I surrender
[1:26:26] all.
[1:26:29] Well, now I
[1:26:32] I surrender
[1:26:35] all.
[1:26:37] Oh, we're singing all
[1:26:42] to thee
[1:26:44] my blessed
[1:26:47] Savior
[1:26:50] I
[1:26:52] surrender.
[1:26:55] Oh, come on. Let's give the Lord a hand
[1:26:57] of praise.
[1:27:04] Hallelujah. can be seated just for a
[1:27:06] moment. We thank God for the word of the
[1:27:10] Lord on tonight and um just so much that
[1:27:15] we can feed off of from there. And one
[1:27:19] of those was statements, a couple things
[1:27:21] I was want to just highlight. Um
[1:27:26] he was talking about how the uh
[1:27:28] 19-year-old boy said he didn't have a
[1:27:30] job but was looking for a wife.
[1:27:33] Um, I don't think he finished the
[1:27:35] thought, but a 19-year-old boy, if you
[1:27:37] want to take a wife, you're going to
[1:27:38] have to have a job.
[1:27:40] But man, you got to have a job. You're
[1:27:43] going to need somewhere to take the take
[1:27:44] the lady when you take her from a
[1:27:46] father's house. So, it's very important
[1:27:48] that you get a job and and take care of
[1:27:50] the woman. But, you know, one of the
[1:27:52] other things he mentioned around there
[1:27:54] is this. um a lot of young men um they
[1:27:59] just had a little meeting up in Canada
[1:28:02] over uh some of the um issues regarding
[1:28:06] why young people are getting married so
[1:28:08] late um and and something actually is
[1:28:12] not just a message issue but it's
[1:28:14] something that's been happening uh
[1:28:15] throughout the world even in the world
[1:28:17] just getting married uh later and later
[1:28:20] later in life and and they're trying to
[1:28:22] figure out what's what's going on. One
[1:28:23] of the things, amen, that um I kind of
[1:28:26] felt and brother did it to me, the fear
[1:28:30] of failure.
[1:28:33] That is a real fear.
[1:28:37] Um even he talked about how the
[1:28:40] difference in being a child and being an
[1:28:42] adult is being able to accept the weight
[1:28:45] of responsibility,
[1:28:48] right? I mean these these are these are
[1:28:50] these are very rich things cuz you know
[1:28:52] it it's it's easy to sherk
[1:28:54] responsibility all your life right I
[1:28:58] mean and brother brother Smiley kind of
[1:29:00] hit it a few weeks ago like it's you
[1:29:02] know when you when you sit there and you
[1:29:04] got two car payments
[1:29:07] insurance hello somebody and I mean and
[1:29:11] you got all this stuff just kind of I
[1:29:13] mean you don't just call in sick
[1:29:18] Oh, you realize the weight of
[1:29:20] responsibility and you got to step up.
[1:29:22] But when you don't have none of that, it
[1:29:23] cause you to get a little bit more lazy.
[1:29:26] Oh, good God almighty. And sometimes God
[1:29:29] wants to stretch us. And the only way
[1:29:31] we're going to be stretches, we got to
[1:29:33] get into some situations where Amen. We
[1:29:35] begin to know God a little bit better.
[1:29:38] You you you can't talk about him making
[1:29:40] a way if you've never seen him make a
[1:29:42] way.
[1:29:45] If you ain't never seen God do that,
[1:29:47] it's hard for you to talk about that.
[1:29:49] But but but but I know what I'm talking
[1:29:51] about. When you're underneath that
[1:29:53] weight cause you to go to your knees and
[1:29:55] pray and and and you be able to tell
[1:29:57] God, "Lord, I paid my tithes and my
[1:30:00] offering." And you say, "You're going TO
[1:30:02] REBUKE THE DEVOUR FOR my sake. GOD, I
[1:30:06] DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GOING TO DO THIS, BUT
[1:30:07] I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT. I AIN'T
[1:30:09] GOT NO ANSWERS,
[1:30:11] BUT I GOT A GOD ON MY SIDE.
[1:30:15] I tell you what, it's something about
[1:30:17] being able to get underneath that
[1:30:18] responsibility and just watch God just
[1:30:21] make a way. Watch God make a way. I I
[1:30:25] mean, too many of us have seen it, if
[1:30:26] you know it works, they say, "I know too
[1:30:29] much about it. You can't make me doubt."
[1:30:34] But I I I I I
[1:30:37] like the I like that that fear of
[1:30:40] responsibility. I wrote that one down. I
[1:30:41] said, "I might have to preach that
[1:30:43] somewhere down the line." The fear of of
[1:30:46] responsibility
[1:30:48] or the fear of failure, the fear of
[1:30:50] failure. God help us. We don't want to
[1:30:52] have that. God has not given us the
[1:30:56] spirit of fear, but of love, power, and
[1:30:59] a sound mind. Amen. Amen. Amen. Brother
[1:31:03] Andrew, we appreciate you stopping by,
[1:31:05] brother.
[1:31:08] God bless you.
[1:31:10] God bless you. and and and this this
[1:31:14] spirit
[1:31:15] uh you all don't probably see it or hear
[1:31:19] too much about it because you know you
[1:31:21] go to church but um there are other
[1:31:24] places where people been encouraged not
[1:31:26] to go to church now I'm going tell you
[1:31:28] how they got there
[1:31:31] tell you how they got to the not going
[1:31:33] to church there's a couple things that
[1:31:34] happened one thing is that people
[1:31:37] exhausted brother Brandon too time
[1:31:42] they they they couldn't they couldn't
[1:31:44] see that uh they had to put Christ in
[1:31:47] that place not not the prophet in that
[1:31:48] place and and people used to say all
[1:31:50] kind of things you know when they went
[1:31:52] to Jeffersonville and they pray in
[1:31:54] brother Brandham's name and do all that
[1:31:55] kind of we don't do none of that here we
[1:31:57] don't worship the prophet we worship God
[1:32:02] right but people did that and they
[1:32:04] didn't get that thing back on the word
[1:32:05] so it kind caused them just kind of go
[1:32:07] to only want to play tapes only then we
[1:32:09] got to a spot now where we are uh push
[1:32:13] play only. No more preaching.
[1:32:17] All right. And and here's here's what
[1:32:19] here's well I I shouldn't say that. I
[1:32:21] shouldn't because it it it to me it's
[1:32:23] it's really sad. It's really sad that um
[1:32:28] you don't want any preaching but when
[1:32:30] somebody die
[1:32:32] you looking for a preacher to come and
[1:32:33] preach the funeral. And and I was going
[1:32:36] to say this and when somebody get
[1:32:38] married typically looking for a preacher
[1:32:41] to come and and and and and perform that
[1:32:44] ceremony. However, nowadays it's so bad
[1:32:48] that we push and play at a wedding
[1:32:50] ceremony.
[1:32:54] That's not even that's not even your
[1:32:56] name
[1:32:58] in them wedding vows. And and you going
[1:33:00] to push play. Come on now. This is out
[1:33:03] of it. It's It's out of control. It's
[1:33:06] out of control. Right. And I mean and
[1:33:09] and and again, like he said, you're
[1:33:10] going to have young people coming up,
[1:33:12] little kids growing up in environment
[1:33:13] like this. The very thing that they push
[1:33:16] and play on and listening to, they have
[1:33:18] never experienced,
[1:33:22] never actually been in a church.
[1:33:26] How many of you know what a church look
[1:33:27] like? What is that? That's church.
[1:33:31] That's where these things was preached
[1:33:33] at. What you listen at on the tape, they
[1:33:35] would preach that in a church. The
[1:33:37] reason brother Brandham got his
[1:33:39] inspiration when he got to the church,
[1:33:42] when the Holy Spirit would come and
[1:33:43] actually anoint what was being spoken,
[1:33:46] right? So, so, so we're going to have a
[1:33:48] generation that don't know nothing about
[1:33:50] that. That's going to be real sad. And
[1:33:55] it's the parents fault. Brother Brandon
[1:33:57] call it parent
[1:34:01] delinquency.
[1:34:03] That's going to be rough. God help us.
[1:34:05] So, we ought to thank God. I I like
[1:34:07] that. Young people, y'all tell your
[1:34:08] parents you appreciate it. Thank you for
[1:34:11] for putting me in a church where I can
[1:34:13] get fed. Thank you for put me in a
[1:34:15] situation where I can I can succeed.
[1:34:18] Thank you. Tell tell them thank you.
[1:34:19] Sometimes complaining all the time, but
[1:34:22] tell them thank you. Blessed be the name
[1:34:24] of the Lord. I I I appreciate the word
[1:34:27] of God tonight. Amen. I do. Let me have
[1:34:29] the announcements. Amen. Um and uh I
[1:34:34] will
[1:34:37] I know we have um
[1:34:40] you know Sister Dixon celebrated her
[1:34:42] birthday today. We thank God for giving
[1:34:45] her uh another year. Amen. Here we
[1:34:49] really thank God for that. Um on uh
[1:34:52] Sunday we'll be back. Um our prayers
[1:34:55] time start at 8:30 to 9:30. uh Sunday

[1:35:10] coming up on Friday, December 19th.
[1:35:12] That'll be 7:30 p.m. on Friday um
[1:35:15] December 19th. And we have our um the
[1:35:20] gift cards that we like to give out
[1:35:21] during Christmas time just to be a
[1:35:22] blessing to other families that um just
[1:35:25] may need, you know, a little blessing.
[1:35:28] So we have a box that we bring and put

[1:35:45] we can do that because we're going to

[1:35:52] have um a gift card, you just want to
[1:35:55] put cash and say she'll be glad to go
[1:35:57] and buy the gift card uh on your behalf

[1:36:24] have a address on the bottom of the
[1:36:26] screen of those in the sanctuary. If you
[1:36:28] want to use the wooden box there on the
[1:36:30] back table, feel free to do so. Uh, one
[1:36:33] of the other things, brother Andrew
[1:36:34] mentioned tonight that, um, I,
[1:36:39] it just made me just kind of stop and
[1:36:42] just be grateful.
[1:36:44] Um, was talking about how there there
[1:36:48] have been many of churches that have had
[1:36:51] a lot more that we have had at Spirit
[1:36:55] and Truth Tabernacle, but they got all
[1:36:57] of that and and not following the
[1:36:59] message today.
[1:37:02] nice buildings.
[1:37:04] I mean, um I mean got all kind of
[1:37:06] things, but but not they have fallen
[1:37:09] completely away from the words. I know I
[1:37:12] know I know um I know churches that have
[1:37:15] split over this tape only. You know,
[1:37:18] they had they had uh really nice
[1:37:21] building. They was worshiping and then
[1:37:22] when when it came to the tape only, the
[1:37:24] pastor said, "No, I want to keep
[1:37:26] preaching." Some people left the church
[1:37:27] because they thought the pastor was
[1:37:29] wrong by still preaching divided. Church
[1:37:32] shut down over tape only,
[1:37:35] right? We got each other.
[1:37:39] We got each other and we ain't got
[1:37:41] nothing else. We got each other.
[1:37:46] And and and I'd rather be doing this
[1:37:48] with with this group of uh believers
[1:37:50] than any other group I know. And brother
[1:37:53] brother Solomon was telling me that as
[1:37:54] you all are leaving here a couple weeks
[1:37:56] ago leaving here and um there's a lady
[1:37:59] that goes to the other uh church, you
[1:38:02] know, the church that we're renting
[1:38:03] from, one of the members that come to a
[1:38:06] couple brothers and said, you know, um
[1:38:09] there's two things we noticed about you
[1:38:11] all. One is that we can see y'all love
[1:38:14] each other. Y'all love each other so
[1:38:16] much. We just see how y'all interact
[1:38:18] with one another. Y'all y'all we we we
[1:38:21] can see the love. There was one other
[1:38:22] thing they said. What was
[1:38:25] Oh, the atmosphere, right? And they and
[1:38:28] they they said, um, when you all leave,
[1:38:32] the atmosphere is still felt in the
[1:38:34] church. So, it's so much easier for us
[1:38:37] to be able to enter in and get right
[1:38:39] into our service. We don't have to work
[1:38:40] too hard because the atmosphere is
[1:38:42] already set. And that's what they're
[1:38:45] saying about you,
[1:38:47] right? and and and um you know as I was
[1:38:52] uh brother I was talking with brother um
[1:38:54] Anthony and I was he kind of took me
[1:38:57] down a a little trail. I had to to jog
[1:39:00] my memory on something when we when we
[1:39:02] first came to this building. I brought
[1:39:04] the brothers to see this building.
[1:39:07] Um my wife and I already saw it but but
[1:39:11] um and we didn't think of anything of it
[1:39:13] because they just didn't have the right
[1:39:14] time slots for us. But uh when we when
[1:39:17] they called me back and said uh you know
[1:39:20] what those slots that you want, they're
[1:39:21] available and if y'all still want it,
[1:39:23] y'all can have it. And I brought the
[1:39:24] brothers here, you know, the the deacons
[1:39:26] and and the trustees and we looked
[1:39:28] around and and um and as we're standing
[1:39:31] out there in that that that that
[1:39:33] hallway, uh the pastor begin to say um
[1:39:36] that's my first time meeting him. He
[1:39:38] says we're talking about, you know, just
[1:39:39] his journey Christianity and he says,
[1:39:42] "I'm a son of WV Grant." I say, "Is that
[1:39:45] right?" Okay. I said, he said, "You
[1:39:47] heard of him?" I said, "I think so. Just
[1:39:49] a little bit. I know about him." He
[1:39:51] says, "Yeah." He says, "Well, have you
[1:39:53] ever heard of William Marry and
[1:39:54] Brandon?"
[1:39:56] And the brothers looked at me. I said,
[1:39:57] "Yeah, I heard of him a little bit. I
[1:40:00] know a little bit about him, too." You
[1:40:02] know, I He said, "Well, WV Grant got the
[1:40:04] anointing from William Mayor and
[1:40:06] Brandon." I said, "Oh." He said, "Oh,
[1:40:08] okay. Okay. they that anointing that
[1:40:11] they feeling when they coming in here
[1:40:13] after us. I think they now know where
[1:40:16] that anointing is resting. Praise God.
[1:40:18] It's is it's the Eli El Elisha
[1:40:25] gets the anointing from Elijah.
[1:40:28] All right.
[1:40:30] Hallelujah.
[1:40:32] Brother Brandham say know the the she
[1:40:34] and the he. Right. So So it's the bride
[1:40:37] that takes on that anointing. But but
[1:40:39] but as he was walk as we were walking
[1:40:41] down there, I said, "God is the one that
[1:40:43] opened this door for us to come through
[1:40:46] here now." And I feel there's a squeeze
[1:40:50] happening to us. And uh so we're going
[1:40:53] to have to just pray uh regarding these
[1:40:56] things because we know God is want to
[1:40:58] open this door and and if he's squeezing
[1:41:00] us out to go to better, praise God, I'm
[1:41:04] taking that. But uh if uh somebody else
[1:41:08] got to find another place to go or
[1:41:10] something like that, then that's that's
[1:41:11] fine, too. Yeah. Hallelujah.
[1:41:16] All right.
[1:41:18] I'll just leave it like that.
[1:41:21] Amen. But I know God opened up this
[1:41:24] door. It wasn't no accident that that
[1:41:26] brother asked by William Brandon. He
[1:41:28] didn't know who he was talking to on
[1:41:30] that day. And he didn't ask me no
[1:41:32] questions. If we would if we would have
[1:41:34] went deeper, I would have act I would
[1:41:36] have answered some things, but I just
[1:41:38] didn't say nothing.
[1:41:40] But I'm sure the videos and everything
[1:41:42] else pick up what's going on in here.
[1:41:44] But the anointing is what makes the
[1:41:46] difference.
[1:41:50] Glory. Before we leave here tonight,
[1:41:52] anybody got a special testimony they
[1:41:54] want to share? Okay. All right. Come on,
[1:41:57] sis. Um,
[1:42:00] did I have any other hands? I got one
[1:42:02] here. We got another one. Okay. All
[1:42:04] right. Here. You can take my mic, sis.
[1:42:06] There you go.
[1:42:12] God bless you. I want to thank everyone
[1:42:15] for their prayers. I finished school and
[1:42:20] I'm
[1:42:24] I'm very grateful because the last
[1:42:26] semester was extremely hard. They were
[1:42:28] just giving us tests back to back
[1:42:30] without giving us any direction what's
[1:42:31] on the test and our grade was completely
[1:42:34] dependent on it. So I'm very grateful he
[1:42:36] brought me through and I would like to
[1:42:38] thank him for bringing brother Andrew
[1:42:40] here tonight and speaking on anxiety
[1:42:42] because I rebuke it in the name of
[1:42:43] Jesus.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank God. Thank God.
[1:43:02] God bless everybody.
[1:43:04] I'm a little nervous. Y'all know I don't
[1:43:06] usually get up here, but
[1:43:08] um I have a couple of testimonies.
[1:43:11] On Saturday,
[1:43:14] myself and sister Melissa was out
[1:43:17] shopping for groceries and um we went
[1:43:20] over to um Sam's Club and we were just
[1:43:26] walking around purchasing groceries and
[1:43:28] stuff and then
[1:43:31] um but before I before we went into the
[1:43:35] store,
[1:43:37] when I got out of my car, I heard
[1:43:39] something fall.
[1:43:40] But I looked around. I didn't see I
[1:43:42] didn't see anything, but I know I
[1:43:45] dropped something.
[1:43:47] Um, but I couldn't find it. Um, so I
[1:43:50] said, I'll just go in the store and come
[1:43:52] back out. About by the time I got in the
[1:43:55] store, I had forgot about it. So, we
[1:43:57] left Sam's Club and went over to
[1:43:59] Walmart.
[1:44:01] And when we was walking shopping, I just
[1:44:03] didn't feel right. And uh Sister Melissa
[1:44:06] was like,
[1:44:08] "You don't have on your ring." And I
[1:44:10] looked at my hand like, "Oh, I don't I
[1:44:13] don't I don't know. I think that's what
[1:44:15] I dropped."
[1:44:17] So, and I kept feeling funny. And I was
[1:44:19] and I searched my purse. I searched my
[1:44:21] purse. I'm like, "I can't find my ring."
[1:44:24] And I was so scared. And it was actually
[1:44:27] a ring that
[1:44:29] it wasn't mine. It was belong to my mom.
[1:44:31] And I really didn't want to lose it.
[1:44:34] Um, I had I had it since she passed and
[1:44:38] she had it since I was a little girl.
[1:44:40] So, I said, "I want to keep that ring."
[1:44:43] And so, I told Sister Melissa, I said,
[1:44:44] "I got to find that ring. I got to find
[1:44:46] it." So, she said, "Okay, you go to the
[1:44:50] go back to the store. I'll get the
[1:44:52] groceries and
[1:44:54] um and I'll meet you over there." I
[1:44:56] said, "No, I'm not going to leave you."
[1:44:58] So, we finished shopping and we went
[1:45:00] over there searching. I'm I checked my
[1:45:02] purse again. and I couldn't find the
[1:45:04] ring. I'm like, I know that's what it
[1:45:06] was. So, I went to where I was parked
[1:45:08] and there was a van parked there. We
[1:45:10] both looking on the ground on the ground
[1:45:12] looking for it and whatever.
[1:45:15] And I went to crying and praying. I
[1:45:16] said, "Lord, if you did that for Sister
[1:45:20] Tina a while back, you did it for other
[1:45:23] people. You did it for brother uh
[1:45:24] somebody in brother Brandon's days. You
[1:45:26] gave them what they was looking for.
[1:45:28] even with brother um Jose with a garbage
[1:45:30] can. I know you can do it for me.
[1:45:34] So I looked at sister Melissa. She
[1:45:37] looked at me
[1:45:39] and some said just check your purse. I
[1:45:42] looked at my purse. The ring was right
[1:45:44] there in my purse.
[1:45:54] And then on Monday, I was headed to work
[1:45:58] and I got a call from my son, uh,
[1:46:00] Jeremiah.
[1:46:02] It was early in the morning and he said
[1:46:05] he, it's like I can barely hear him. His
[1:46:09] voice just was gone. I'm And I asked Mr.
[1:46:12] Jay, "What's wrong? What's wrong?" He
[1:46:13] said, "He just kept saying he was in a
[1:46:15] paramedic."
[1:46:17] I said, "Okay." So I turned my car
[1:46:19] around. I went all the way home and I
[1:46:21] told Jimmy what was going on and
[1:46:23] whatever.
[1:46:25] So I said, "Well, I got to get to work."
[1:46:27] Jimmy went to He said all I know he was
[1:46:30] going to the hospital and Jimmy and my
[1:46:33] daughter and um
[1:46:35] uh my nephew went up to the hospital
[1:46:37] where Jeremiah was. So I kept going on
[1:46:41] to work and I seen this car that was ran
[1:46:45] had ran into a pole. I'm like, "Wow,
[1:46:48] that's that's bad. That's a bad
[1:46:50] accident." So I said, "I prayed I just
[1:46:52] pray Lord whatever whoever that was.
[1:46:57] Please
[1:46:58] help them, protect them, let them be all
[1:47:01] right." So by the time I got on pass, I
[1:47:05] found out that accident the car had to
[1:47:08] hit the pole so bad to the car had
[1:47:09] split.
[1:47:12] I found out that accident that was my
[1:47:15] son.
[1:47:18] He actually fell asleep on the whale
[1:47:21] coming from Jupiter. He fell asleep and
[1:47:24] ran the car into the pole and split. So
[1:47:27] I said, "Lord,
[1:47:30] I thank you.
[1:47:31] I thank you because I didn't know that
[1:47:34] was him.
[1:47:36] It could have been worse
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; because that car could have hit the
[1:47:41] railroad tracks cuz a train had just
[1:47:43] came through. So he could have actually
[1:47:45] ran into a train. But I thank you for
[1:47:49] sparing his life.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; So just keep him in prayer so I know God
[1:47:55] has given him another chance
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; and he should be walking in that door.
[1:47:59] Amen.
[1:48:00] All right. Thank you.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Thank God for watching over uh brother
[1:48:09] and sister uh King's son. Amen. Um
[1:48:15] do we have any other um praise reports?
[1:48:19] Okay. All right. Come on, sis.
[1:48:32] God bless. I just want to thank God um
[1:48:35] just for meeting the needs and um
[1:48:38] providing one as brother Jack said,
[1:48:41] providing us with a place to worship and
[1:48:44] um just these Wednesday night uh
[1:48:47] testimonies are just they just just
[1:48:50] bless my soul. me from the little ones
[1:48:52] that come up and give testimonies to the
[1:48:54] oldest. And so, um, when God do
[1:48:58] something for me, I do want to just give
[1:49:00] him thanks and praise. Uh, when we came
[1:49:03] back from Australia,
[1:49:06] um, my refrigerator was empty. I left it
[1:49:08] empty. And came back and my pockets was
[1:49:11] a little empty, too.
[1:49:13] And I had a sister to call me and say,
[1:49:15] "Sister Ven, you want you want some
[1:49:17] green beans?" I said, "Oh, yeah. I'll
[1:49:19] take them." had to clean them, but I'll
[1:49:22] take them. I need some food. So, I got
[1:49:24] to the sister and I had some green beans
[1:49:27] and I had onion and I had some eggplant
[1:49:31] and some tomatoes and like, man, I can
[1:49:34] eat good. So, couple days later, I had
[1:49:38] all my vegetables. I went to the store
[1:49:40] and got a couple more items. And that
[1:49:42] night when I got home, my old neighbor
[1:49:45] came over and he said, "Hey, I got a
[1:49:48] whole lot of meat in the freezer. You
[1:49:50] want some You want some meat? Got some
[1:49:53] Got some seafood. You want some little
[1:49:54] Want some seafood?" I said, "Yeah, I'll
[1:49:56] take some." So he came back with the
[1:49:58] seafood. He gave me a big old slab of
[1:50:00] salmon. I I ain't know what kind of fish
[1:50:02] I was get. Slab of salmon. I can eat off
[1:50:05] of that for a couple weeks. So I'm like,
[1:50:07] man, I got my vegetables and my meat and
[1:50:09] everything. I'm set. But I just thank
[1:50:12] God for that. And and now I'm trying to
[1:50:14] be in in the market of doing some
[1:50:16] upgrades to the house. And um I was
[1:50:19] looking for tile and the least expensive
[1:50:22] tile. The nicest quality I could get was
[1:50:25] like $1.99 a yard. If I get somebody to
[1:50:28] do the installation, it's probably going
[1:50:30] to be about three $4,000 for the size of
[1:50:32] my house. So um when I priced the
[1:50:35] material, it came up to like $3,000. So
[1:50:38] I went back and I'm asking the guy, "Oh,
[1:50:40] this is, you know, this is the least
[1:50:41] expensive towel you got." He said, "Come
[1:50:43] here. Let me show you something." So he
[1:50:45] showed me some towel that was on
[1:50:46] clearance for a dollar a square foot.
[1:50:49] And he said, "It's much better than the
[1:50:50] one that you picked out." So I said,
[1:50:52] "Oh, man. Better and cheaper." So, okay.
[1:50:55] The only thing is he didn't have enough
[1:50:57] to do the whole house. He said, "You're
[1:50:59] going to have to probably go to this
[1:51:00] store and this store and all over." He
[1:51:02] said, "You don't want to do that." So
[1:51:04] I'm like, "A dollar a yard. I'm going to
[1:51:06] take my chances and go to this store and
[1:51:07] this. So, I went to the other store and
[1:51:11] on 441
[1:51:13] and it was the uh Lowe's. And so, I told
[1:51:15] the guy, I said, "Do you all have, you
[1:51:17] know, this tile that I'm looking for?
[1:51:18] They had it on clearance at the other
[1:51:20] store." He said, "Yeah." So, he had a I
[1:51:23] guess the crate of it, it was about 20
[1:51:25] boxes, but I still need about 50 more.
[1:51:30] So, um he was like, "Come here. Let me
[1:51:33] show you something." So, he pointed to
[1:51:34] me. of towels on clearance that was two
[1:51:37] or three times better than the other
[1:51:39] one. It was a dollar, still a dollar,
[1:51:41] but the quality was much higher. And the
[1:51:44] slabs are bigger. And I was like, man,
[1:51:47] look at God. He's giving me better for
[1:51:50] less. And I'm trusting that God's going
[1:51:52] to do the same thing for our church.
[1:51:54] He's going to give us better
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; for less.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that we get better
[1:52:06] for less.
[1:52:08] I like that.
[1:52:11] Praise the Lord. Appreciate Appreciate
[1:52:12] that testimony. Sister uh Vera, I was
[1:52:17] happy to hear how she was reminded of
[1:52:20] Brother Jose sharing a testimony about a
[1:52:22] garbage can. I forgot about that one.
[1:52:26] But if God will be mindful of your
[1:52:29] garbage can,
[1:52:34] How much more mindful will he be for
[1:52:36] everything else that you have need of?
[1:52:38] So God is good. All right. Any others
