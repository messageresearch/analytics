[29:23] water glory glory glory hey Manny Manny
[29:27] man praise the Lord for that I just
[29:30] appreciate that song and the man just
[29:32] encouraged my heart there just wanted to
[29:35] just quickly read the scripture to you
[29:37] and this morning my precious brother
[29:41] Troy will come in and deliver the word
[29:43] of the Lord to us but I was just reading
[29:46] this this week in my Bible readings and
[29:49] thought that I would just give this to
[29:52] the church Deuteronomy 30 and verse 9 I
[29:55] was reading and when I read the
[29:58] scripture just felt lay it to write it
[30:01] in my prayer journal oh I'm just kind of
[30:04] put it on a number of things as you're
[30:07] going through your fridge earlier this
[30:08] year a gobble just give you maybe some
[30:10] scriptures to go along with some of the
[30:12] things you've already been praying them
[30:13] and when you when you pray scripture
[30:15] you're actually praying God's promise
[30:17] right at the top of whatever it is that
[30:19] you're presenting to God and now
[30:21] sometimes it's just so good to remind
[30:22] the Lord you said this you said that
[30:25] and then I was just thinking about some
[30:26] things and a man the thing about the
[30:29] business and the Lord has blessed us
[30:31] with and this scripture came when I
[30:33] wrote it right there on top of the
[30:34] business but this scripture actually has
[30:36] a lot more to just do it businesses
[30:38] every area of your life a man and
[30:41] whatever you might be going through I
[30:42] pray that this will just speak peace a
[30:45] man to your situation the Bible says the
[30:48] Lord thy God will make the plenteous in
[30:52] every word of my man that mean anything
[30:55] you touch
[30:56] don't be blessed by God hallelujah and
[30:59] it says in the fruit of thy body amen
[31:04] there's somebody looking to have
[31:06] children to put this scripture right and
[31:09] in the fruit of that cattle and in the
[31:11] fruit of thy land for good for the Lord
[31:15] will again that mean he did it before
[31:18] he's gonna do it again
[31:19] the Lord will again rejoice over thee
[31:23] good that mean when you celebrating God
[31:25] is celebrating right the man would
[31:27] rejoice over thee for good as he
[31:30] rejoiced over that father's if my daddy
[31:34] was blessed my mom was blessed I'm gonna
[31:35] be blessed man I just I just think God
[31:40] for that and I was just just just
[31:42] encouraged by the word of the Lord just
[31:43] wanting to give that to the church a man
[31:46] this morning whatever it is that you
[31:47] might be faced and put the Word of God
[31:49] on it unless one let's watch God turn it

[34:55] second
[34:56] there were there's been a couple of
[34:58] churches that have been impacted by the

[35:03] I've been told of brother Hicks sister
[35:07] Hicks their daughter they're in in
[35:10] Mullen South Carolina I understand that
[35:13] there's some other things that might be
[35:14] dealing with some of the fallout of this
[35:17] also precious sister that comes to visit
[35:21] us quite often Amen sister
[35:24] ie Lee her father is in a nursing home
[35:27] and he was diagnosed as well with the
[35:32] koubek 19 virus and
[35:35] last night they were actually they
[35:38] didn't know if he would make it through
[35:39] the night but leave but she began to
[35:40] just sent out for requests and people
[35:42] getting to pray and they said last night
[35:45] his vitals went the other way positive
[35:52] we want to just remember a man DS

[50:49] fourth chapter but I would have but I
[50:54] would not have you to be ignorant
[50:56] brethren concerning them which are
[51:00] asleep
[51:01] that you sorrow not even as others which
[51:05] have no hope for if we believe that
[51:10] Jesus died and rose again even so them
[51:13] also which sleep in Jesus will God bring
[51:17] with him for this we say unto you by the
[51:22] word of the Lord that we which are alive
[51:26] and remain unto the coming of the Lord
[51:29] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[51:33] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[51:37] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[51:43] the Archangel and with the Trump of God
[51:46] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[51:52] then we which are alive and remain shall
[51:58] be caught up together with them in the
[52:03] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[52:09] so shall we ever be with the Lord and
[52:14] the eighteenth verse reads wherefore
[52:18] comfort one another with these words
[52:25] if I'll title this message this morning
[52:28] I would say comfort one another with
[52:30] these words
[52:33] amen let us bow his most gracious
[52:35] Heavenly Father Lord we come before you
[52:40] this morning the Lord guarded Lord God
[52:44] just by a mere education man's education
[52:47] we're able to read these words Lord God
[52:51] and but Lord it takes an anointing to
[52:55] make these words live Lord Lord God we
[53:00] ask your father God that you would use
[53:03] this vehicle of my voice Lord God to
[53:06] deliver take these words and deliver
[53:10] this message no father to the hearts of
[53:13] the people that they may be comforted
[53:15] in this hour we asked his blessings all
[53:18] God in Jesus name I pray amen
[53:20] we're gonna look at this just for a
[53:23] little bit the word comfort yeah Amen
[53:28] the Greek word is Pericles now I hope
[53:34] I'm saying that right I'm not a scholar
[53:36] I do the best I can at breaking down the
[53:39] syllables that some of these Greek words
[53:41] and things amen but it means persuasive
[53:46] discourse a stirring address Amen an
[53:52] example is like a general that would
[53:55] address an army before a battle Amen to
[54:00] give those that may be fearful courage
[54:04] right man that they may find comfort in
[54:08] those words and then it also means to
[54:12] exhort comforting and encouraging it
[54:16] also means to instruct a man or to teach
[54:21] a man yes so we take these words and a
[54:28] group of words together yeah a man to
[54:33] convey a message right I mean we'll take
[54:37] these words and these words are supposed
[54:41] to convey a message to you to bring you
[54:48] a certain level of comfort yeah yeah
[54:53] amen
[54:53] but in order to deliver this message
[54:56] Amen that that those words must travel
[55:01] in a vehicle called sound right I can
[55:05] say the words in my mind and but you
[55:09] won't receive them because there's no
[55:11] traveling vehicle to deliver the words
[55:14] to you man so the sound amen
[55:21] is the vehicle used to get your
[55:24] attention
[55:25] yeah so that you would turn any man and
[55:31] pay attention to the words that I'm
[55:34] saying right exactly that you may
[55:37] receive the message and if you receive
[55:42] the message you will be comforted right
[55:46] hey man hey man yes
[55:49] the sound is what you hear and gives
[55:53] your attention to prepare you to receive
[55:57] the message right yes sir
[56:00] the Prophet said the message is simply
[56:06] God's promises all right if you turn to
[56:10] the message system and the message the
[56:13] rapture all right a man 1965 1204
[56:20] paragraph 16 I want to give a time to
[56:24] get that amen
[56:27] the message to rapture 65 1204 paragraph
[56:33] 16 yeah amen the Prophet says this
[56:39] there's too much supernatural
[56:43] vindication of God's written word of
[56:48] this hour for something not to be
[56:52] approached for us now all right we're
[56:56] just it's too real the things that you
[57:04] it would be astounding to you just to
[57:09] let you know that what is really taking
[57:14] place right many of you strangers
[57:17] perhaps kill these men get up here and
[57:23] make these remarks about a message right
[57:26] of this out and so forth what they are
[57:32] getting at is
[57:34] God's promises for this that he promised
[57:42] what that he promised what he would do
[57:46] and we see him scripturally will
[57:51] vindicate right truly vindicated right
[57:57] not on visiting that again all right
[58:01] exactly what he said he would do he said
[58:09] he would do it
[58:11] Forbes hold it's just exactly perfectly
[58:19] because it's God singing it aiming
[58:24] comfort one another with these words
[58:28] right in the message the rapture
[58:32] preached December 4th 1965 I want you to
[58:39] notice my brothers and sisters there
[58:42] opening scripture that the Holy Ghost

[58:50] right okay all right we don't preach it
[58:55] flap right tell it just how it is amen
[58:59] to read now listen now a rapture message

[59:08] Thessalonians probably would have said
[59:12] you caught the thief in the night and
[59:14] you'll be Spiritualized my spiritual
[59:17] basis for action all right who wrapped
[59:19] your message what the Prophet you that's
[59:22] his opening Scripture supposed to go
[59:26] ahead and put that up rapture the same
[59:30] message there paragraph 27 all right he
[59:34] says and I want to speak on the subject
[59:37] this morning of the rapture see he said
[59:42] now we believe that there will be a
[59:44] rapture
[59:45] all Christians believe that that's Bible
[59:50] readers believe that there will be a
[59:53] rapture the church say Amen and now we

[1:27:06] how much the mechanics prove to be right
[1:27:09] there has got to be dynamics forward to
[1:27:14] work there's got to be dynamics forward
[1:27:17] to work a man he'd Bible says the letter
[1:27:21] killeth but the spirit giveth life amen
[1:27:28] he said in the message Amen so so I'm
[1:27:31] sorry 1957 twelve thirteen and then came
[1:27:35] Jesus I want you to go with me through
[1:27:37] this little story
[1:27:38] amen amen you'll find it in your Bibles
[1:27:43] at John the eleventh chapter that I
[1:27:47] think it starts
[1:27:48] I forget what verse but I have it down
[1:27:50] here don't want to prolong and look for
[1:27:53] it but you'll get it right one coming
[1:27:55] from him talking about Lazarus yes
[1:27:59] Lazarus was sick a man and then came
[1:28:04] Jesus you can go ahead and put it up
[1:28:05] sister paragraph 13 I'm sorry paragraph
[1:28:10] 13 and it says then Jesus came amen
[1:28:16] there was perhaps as anyone know the
[1:28:22] context of this that we will not have
[1:28:27] time to unfold tonight and I hope I have
[1:28:30] time today to you in the cold room but
[1:28:35] it was during the time of the death of
[1:28:38] Lazarus his friend Martha and Mary had
[1:28:43] been his bosom friend and he was
[1:28:48] associated with them and one time Jesus
[1:28:52] a vision from the father yes sir brother
[1:28:56] received a vision from the father and he
[1:28:59] said God had told him to leave this
[1:29:02] place and go to another place
[1:29:07] my brother said I just got the pause
[1:29:10] right days God telling you to leave one
[1:29:13] place and go to another place you got to
[1:29:20] listen to the leading of the Lord for
[1:29:24] Lazarus was going to die now you say
[1:29:28] brother branham that's not written in
[1:29:30] the scripture see this is why we need a
[1:29:34] prophet he said but in st. John 5:19
[1:29:38] Jesus said I do nothing except my father
[1:29:41] show me first
[1:29:42] I do nothing in myself the son can do
[1:29:46] nothing but what he see the father doing
[1:29:50] he see the father doing that doeth the
[1:29:53] Son and if he noticed him how the great
[1:29:58] vision he went away for four days and
[1:30:05] they sent for him to come Lazarus was
[1:30:09] sick they sit for him did they send a
[1:30:16] runner digby put mail in the mailbox did
[1:30:23] they use a carrier service
[1:30:26] Amen I don't know what vehicle they use
[1:30:30] live with the message to Jesus but I
[1:30:33] know we have one today right it is
[1:30:37] prayer Lazarus was sick and if any among
[1:30:42] you are sick a man he's only one prayer
[1:30:47] way he's only a prayer away he's not too
[1:30:54] far where he can't be reached he's only
[1:30:57] a prayer away call Jesus on the scene
[1:31:03] no matter what trouble you might be
[1:31:06] going through he's only a prayer way if
[1:31:10] there's depression or financial trouble
[1:31:13] or whatever the case may your car won't
[1:31:15] start
[1:31:16] he's only a but listen make the story
[1:31:20] now as we go home he come right away
[1:31:24] yes nah he's only a prayer way but he's
[1:31:30] not gonna come out at a time when you
[1:31:32] first call him now you see I'm sorry 14
[1:31:42] here put it back up sister no we don't
[1:31:45] know just listen at this we don't know
[1:31:48] just what the sickness was but some
[1:31:51] historians have said that he died of
[1:31:53] hemorrhages of the lungs sound like the
[1:31:58] coal v8 donut yeah I told you that's man
[1:32:01] putting egg on things but we know it's
[1:32:04] the same devil the same tormenting devil
[1:32:09] that is was the impact at the end Amen
[1:32:13] is here now but guess what Jesus was
[1:32:17] only a prayer he had an image in his
[1:32:35] lungs however he grew sicker and the
[1:32:40] physicians perhaps could do nothing for
[1:32:44] him and then after a bit he got sick
[1:32:48] until he died and when he called Jesus
[1:32:52] and when he died Jesus said our friend
[1:32:55] Lazarus sleepeth so the disciples we go
[1:33:02] on here let's check this out and they
[1:33:06] said well if he sleep he doeth well now
[1:33:09] see they don't they didn't they don't
[1:33:11] get and we don't today many time
[1:33:15] what the word death means that's mean
[1:33:18] separation it doesn't mean that it
[1:33:22] doesn't mean that you die forever you
[1:33:25] just separate from your friends you
[1:33:27] alive
[1:33:28] somewhere else Jesus told them in their
[1:33:33] own understanding that Lazarus is dead
[1:33:36] oh and for your sake I'm glad I wasn't
[1:33:43] there but I go to wake him
[1:33:46] Oh prophet got excited right there he
[1:33:49] said oh what a marvelous team amen he
[1:33:58] said I'll go and wake him could you
[1:34:14] imagine a man Jesus amen could you
[1:34:19] imagine the disappointment in this
[1:34:22] little family Mary Martha called a
[1:34:27] family of God
[1:34:28] it's little family those were in the
[1:34:34] house who faith stay with me here they
[1:34:40] have been excommunicated from their
[1:34:42] denominational churches I'm just going
[1:34:44] to kind of seal some things in here you
[1:34:47] know just stay with me help to worship
[1:34:50] they they they were they were
[1:34:51] excommunicated where their fathers had
[1:34:55] worshiped because they had accepted
[1:34:59] Jesus as their Messiah oh my and here
[1:35:06] miss about what he says I can't hear the
[1:35:09] mocking and the scarf of the unbeliever
[1:35:12] saying where's your evangelist now
[1:35:15] where's your healer
[1:35:17] oh when it comes time his own buddy he
[1:35:24] let him back now he had
[1:35:28] he'll people all the time
[1:35:31] yes but he wouldn't come back from for
[1:35:33] his own buddy yeah yeah but we're taught
[1:35:40] that all things work together for the
[1:35:42] good of them that love God God is making
[1:35:46] everything move just according to his
[1:35:49] great timepiece as it is ticking around
[1:35:53] then when the darkest hour that the
[1:36:00] little family had ever seen
[1:36:02] excommunicated from that church degraded
[1:36:05] in societies of the Church of their
[1:36:09] church their friends and their friends
[1:36:12] that they had put too much confidence in
[1:36:16] they fail them seemingly that all hope
[1:36:21] was gone
[1:36:23] Lazarus was dead and buried for four
[1:36:29] days for four days
[1:36:33] corruption set in after seven and two
[1:36:36] hours three days perhaps his nose had
[1:36:40] already fallen into his face that's the
[1:36:44] first thing that takes place the nose
[1:36:46] turns and falls in and then the skin
[1:36:49] worms had set in its in into his body
[1:36:53] and then it just at that great strategic
[1:36:59] moment when the darkest hour they had
[1:37:03] ever seen then Jesus came oh oh that's
[1:37:10] just like him to do that he comes in
[1:37:14] your darkest moment Jesus came by Amen
[1:37:20] but but then again I'll take just a
[1:37:27] moment longer to say this that when
[1:37:30] Jesus come by if he's not accepted then
[1:37:34] it doesn't do him any good to pass by
[1:37:38] your way but
[1:37:40] when he is good to come back come back
[1:37:43] and show himself then you should be
[1:37:47] thankful that you would receive him that
[1:37:52] you would believe him a man
[1:37:55] now Martha little Martha had been very
[1:38:00] much amen
[1:38:02] the word he said it's dilatory about the
[1:38:07] scripture
[1:38:07] coming you know okay yeah see but Mary
[1:38:19] was the one that sat and listened to him
[1:38:22] at the feet of Jesus but I think in this
[1:38:28] passage Martha showed just exactly what
[1:38:32] she was made of I see Mary was the one
[1:38:35] when they invited Jesus to the party she
[1:38:39] was a ill-fame woman she wasn't invited
[1:38:43] to the party but she saw Jesus sitting
[1:38:46] there with dirty feet and she went spent
[1:38:50] her money and got the oil the alabaster
[1:38:55] box and went back and washed his feet
[1:38:57] amen Saint Mary amen
[1:39:01] so what would seem that Mary was the
[1:39:03] more spiritual one I should say but
[1:39:07] Martha check my file man not the one to
[1:39:09] play with Martha she heard that Jesus
[1:39:18] come and she left Martha showed exactly
[1:39:23] the scene much I can just start what she
[1:39:25] was made out of she heard that Jesus
[1:39:27] come and she started through the streets
[1:39:31] to go meet him now seemingly that she
[1:39:34] had a right to unbraid him a man and say
[1:39:39] why didn't you come when we call just
[1:39:43] something you feel like that when Karl
[1:39:44] oh Jesus he don't come right when you're
[1:39:46] wanting amen
[1:39:47] the Prophet had that problem amen
[1:39:51] the devil came to him
[1:39:53] right he called on Jesus to heal his
[1:39:55] daughter yes and that's what the same
[1:39:58] devil same devil amen
[1:40:02] and she had every he says here seemingly
[1:40:05] she had every right to abrade him why
[1:40:09] didn't you come when I call you but to
[1:40:12] Martin it wasn't a question of whether
[1:40:16] he come or whether he didn't come the
[1:40:19] thing was that he's finally he was there
[1:40:22] and it doesn't make any difference
[1:40:25] tonight that we had had prayer meetings
[1:40:28] and what we done and so forth
[1:40:31] he's here that's the main thing how many
[1:40:35] failures we've had and so forth he is
[1:40:39] here how many believe he's here this
[1:40:41] morning amen now he has come and in our
[1:40:46] darkest hour in the world's history we
[1:40:52] are now live in listen at this we know
[1:40:56] that for both politics and religion
[1:40:59] everything seems to be in chaos notice
[1:41:05] it now when she went to meet Jesus
[1:41:08] instead of giving him a sharp rebuke
[1:41:11] when she saw him she loved oh I love
[1:41:15] this she fell down before him and she
[1:41:19] fell down before him and her beautiful
[1:41:22] face looking up into his face of Master
[1:41:25] she recognized quickly as her Lord you
[1:41:30] remember last night he says when I
[1:41:32] preach the door the door the hearts you
[1:41:34] must let him in every room amen for him
[1:41:39] to be your Lord paraphrasing cuz I want
[1:41:42] to get through this you will accept him
[1:41:44] as Savior but never as Lord seldom Lord
[1:41:48] the Lord is ownership and control he
[1:41:53] controls your emotions who controls your
[1:41:57] faith
[1:41:58] he controls your love he controls your
[1:42:01] life he's in full control of you and you
[1:42:06] walked in the Spirit of the Lord Jesus
[1:42:08] Christ and the Bible said that therefore
[1:42:12] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:42:15] to them that are in Christ Jesus who
[1:42:18] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:42:21] spirit the lordship of Christ has
[1:42:26] control amen
[1:42:28] I want to take this moment my brothers
[1:42:31] and sisters in we want to lose in the
[1:42:33] darkest hour we see that everything is
[1:42:37] in chaos in the darkest hour amen
[1:42:43] Jesus comes amen let me go on lordship a
[1:42:53] man so we see my brothers and sisters
[1:42:59] that Martha went to Jesus she had heard
[1:43:07] Amen that Jesus was coming he wasn't
[1:43:12] there yet but she had gotten word
[1:43:16] through the message of the hour that he
[1:43:21] was coming there were many that was
[1:43:25] before us that scene of the healings
[1:43:29] went to the revivals and saw the word
[1:43:35] coming amen but Martha a man had to
[1:43:43] catch the revelation amen
[1:43:46] she had to step amen
[1:43:49] into my god division notice my brothers
[1:43:55] and sisters she had spoken with the Lord
[1:43:59] and he said oh I know
[1:44:04] Amen that if you would have been here
[1:44:06] Amen my brother wouldn't have died
[1:44:11] and he said but she said but even now
[1:44:16] even now whatever you say will be done a
[1:44:23] man jesus said to her awesome
[1:44:29] Martha was looking at he said I am the
[1:44:32] resurrection I am the resurrection

[1:44:44] putting the resurrection off into some
[1:44:47] distant time a man she hadn't caught the

[2:02:59] same comfort that has been given to us
[2:03:02] the same conference that we offer to
[2:03:03] others
[2:03:05] we've been confident through the message
[2:03:07] that God has revealed to us through His
[2:03:09] Prophet
[2:03:10] that's why we're not alarmed
[2:03:13] while we are fearful
[2:03:15] time like this
[2:03:19] steps ahead of where this virus is and
[2:03:23] we're just trying to get him stepping
[2:03:24] where he's at
[2:03:25] catch division they ban him to step into
[2:03:28] it that is our that's our desire thank
[2:03:30] God for brother Troy they mad this
[2:03:32] morning using their special way to
[2:03:37] comfort our hearts amen
[2:03:40] I have a praise report that I just want
[2:03:43] to read before we prepared to leave I
[2:03:47] believe it was last week we prayed over
[2:03:49] this God is answering prayer sister Tina
[2:03:53] said I think I'm thankful for God
[2:03:55] answering prayers for the lady that had
[2:03:57] a terrible motorcycle accident last week
[2:03:59] she's up talking
[2:04:03] and with
[2:04:05] with through many surgeries but she's
[2:04:07] doing well although she went through our
[2:04:10] many surgeries she's doing well a doctor
[2:04:12] told her she was blessed a man into a
[2:04:16] more test but the results have been
[2:04:17] positive in favor favor in favor of all
[2:04:22] previous tests so God is good in her
[2:04:25] situation
[2:04:27] [Music]
[2:04:30] and I wanted the biggest things and I'm
[2:04:32] praying and asked the Lord for during
[2:04:35] the season and I believe for those way
[2:04:36] can we put this out I said to see Mike
[2:04:39] with everything going on spit so
[2:04:41] easyJet's just a witness to people
[2:04:44] you know bringing a confident we got you
[2:04:46] know that was a perfect time to be able
[2:04:48] to share with them the things that you
[2:04:49] know and why you have the just approach
[2:04:53] that you have some aspects we're looking
[2:04:55] at tomorrow's news but as we read what
[2:04:57] the Prophet said we are listening to
[2:04:59] what the Prophet said we're looking at
[2:05:00] tomorrow's newspaper so we already know
[2:05:02] what Spirit happened and we're not sure
[2:05:04] we're not alarm a man we know that we
[2:05:06] found the secret place knowledge brought
[2:05:08] us into it and that's that stuff a good
[2:05:10] thing that lasts for the fraud went to
[2:05:14] the Psalms 27 and I think the last verse
[2:05:17] says say he will hide us they men in his
[2:05:20] pavilion in the secret of us and it's
[2:05:23] time for like a hey he got Highness
[2:05:25] right so you don't have anything to
[2:05:26] worry about he's going to hide you from
[2:05:28] everything that the devil's trying to
[2:05:31] bring to your direction God Himself will
[2:05:33] hide you glory to God I think not and I
[2:05:37] want to encourage if you can maybe this
[2:05:39] week if you have some time or make some
[2:05:42] time go back and listen to the rapture
