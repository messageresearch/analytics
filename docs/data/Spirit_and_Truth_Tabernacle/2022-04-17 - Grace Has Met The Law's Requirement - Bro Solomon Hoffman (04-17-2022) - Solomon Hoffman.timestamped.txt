[55:06] but he's risen
[55:08] and i tell you there's thousands of
[55:10] sermons being preached today and
[55:12] no doubt this morning they're preaching
[55:14] about christ on the cross
[55:16] they're preaching about christ in a tomb
[55:18] they're preaching about baby jesus in a
[55:20] manger
[55:21] but we're preaching jesus christ the
[55:23] same yesterday
[55:25] today and forever that's alive and well
[55:28] amen i just want to declare this morning
[55:30] he's still given the holy ghost
[55:32] he's still saving the loss
[55:34] amen he's not lost any power he's not
[55:36] lost any ability
[55:38] but he's alive and well
[55:40] amen god bless you this morning we're
[55:43] certainly happy to be here with you
[55:45] we count on the privilege and honor and
[55:46] we certainly appreciate brother jack and
[55:49] giving us the opportunity to come and
[55:50] the invitation we want to remember him
[55:52] in prayer today and other services there
[55:55] in london we certainly appreciate him
[55:56] and just putting confidence in us to
[55:59] speak to you while he's away and
[56:01] amen i guess last time we was here i
[56:03] felt like we left a little piece of our
[56:04] hearts here with you amen and we're
[56:06] always thinking about you and praying
[56:08] for you with your building situation we
[56:10] know that god will make a way
[56:12] amen we're just looking to the lord just
[56:14] to speak to us and
[56:16] my what uh what a easter that they see
[56:18] as you know we we hear about having
[56:20] burdens sometimes and bearing burdens
[56:22] but could you imagine
[56:24] bearing every burden of every human
[56:26] being that would ever be born
[56:29] amen he buried those burdens upon his
[56:31] shoulders and i mean no wonder that his
[56:33] sweat turned to blood and
[56:35] we're just thankful for the price that
[56:36] he paid we could be here and i wonder
[56:38] just before we look to the word of god
[56:40] if we could just bow our heads and our
[56:42] hearts and maybe if you have a need on
[56:44] your life and
[56:45] you'd like to lift your hand and ask god
[56:47] to remember you
[56:48] and then maybe a sickness and
[56:50] maybe something you're battling and
[56:52] going through and you want him to
[56:53] remember you
[56:55] and let's just ask him to bless his
[56:56] father lord we're so honored to be in
[56:59] your presence this morning lord and
[57:02] we're thankful father to be in the
[57:03] presence of one another and to have
[57:05] fellowship with our fellow brothers and
[57:08] sisters but lord it's incomparable
[57:10] to the fellowship that we have with our
[57:12] lord and lord we're so glad to know that
[57:15] you're not in a tomb this morning
[57:17] lord but you're risen and what a
[57:19] resurrection that was but what a
[57:22] resurrection this is lord as your sons
[57:25] and daughters of god
[57:26] you have resurrected us lord or the
[57:29] gentile people that that didn't know
[57:31] your lord and gentile people that had
[57:33] nothing to do with you
[57:34] but oh father you resurrected us from
[57:37] deadness
[57:38] and you brought us to life as your sons
[57:40] and daughters we're thankful for this
[57:42] morning lord
[57:44] and lord we want to just invite your
[57:46] presence and your grace upon this
[57:47] service today lord we don't want you to
[57:50] be in the corner unwelcome and uninvited
[57:52] but lord i pray that every individual
[57:54] here would just begin to invite you to
[57:56] where they're standing at lord
[57:58] lord your arm ain't too short that it
[58:00] can't still reach lord there's not a
[58:02] situation that's too great lord there's
[58:04] not a problem to great lord that your
[58:07] hand of mercy can't reach to father and
[58:10] lord i pray that you would just come
[58:12] lord and make yourself visible this
[58:14] morning in the form of your word lord
[58:16] lord we're not here to see or to hear
[58:18] from one another but father we're here
[58:20] to see you high and lifted up in our
[58:22] midst lord you're the reason that we're
[58:24] gathered together this morning lord i
[58:26] pray lord may you take every word into
[58:29] your control every thought that's spoken
[58:31] lord may it be under your auspices lord
[58:33] your direction father or for every hand
[58:36] that was raised this morning behind that
[58:38] hand was a need lord and i pray this
[58:40] morning you'd meet each and every need
[58:42] according to your riches and glory lord
[58:44] we thank you lord for being here in our
[58:46] midst lord i pray that you'd anoint the
[58:48] gift of god in our lives which is only
[58:50] to get out of your way lord and may you
[58:53] anoint your children that they could
[58:54] hear and receive what they have need of
[58:56] when we leave the building lord we'll
[58:58] give you the praise for it in the name
[59:00] of our lord and savior jesus christ we
[59:02] prayed
[59:03] and the church said
[59:05] amen and amen may god bless you this
[59:07] morning if you have your bibles i will
[59:10] go straight to the word of god
[59:11] i know you're in a school building but i
[59:13] don't know is there any time restraints
[59:14] as far as how long the service can be
[59:18] amen he said have my way so
[59:20] i mean we won't hold you all day but we
[59:22] do want to let the lord have his way
[59:25] we'd like to read in the book of romans
[59:26] in the eighth chapter we'll read in the
[59:28] second verse and
[59:30] we'd like to greet you this morning from
[59:32] our pastor for the josh bennett uh back
[59:34] in maiden north carolina we we just sent
[59:36] you greetings from him
[59:38] amen we're just looking forward to what
[59:39] god would do in our midst the book of
[59:41] romans in the eighth chapter we'll read
[59:43] the second verse we'll also turn to
[59:45] romans 7
[59:47] and uh we've got just a couple places to
[59:48] read so we appreciate you standing with
[59:50] us the book of romans in the eighth
[59:52] chapter the second verse the bible would
[59:54] say this for the law
[59:55] of the spirit of life in christ jesus
[59:58] has made me free from the law of sin and
[1:00:01] death
[1:00:02] amen the law of the spirit of life in
[1:00:04] christ jesus has made me free aren't you
[1:00:06] glad to know that we're free
[1:00:08] from the law of sin and death
[1:00:10] and therefore he's made us free the book
[1:00:12] of romans in the seventh chapter that
[1:00:14] will be just a chapter before and we'll
[1:00:16] read the 12th verse there
[1:00:18] the bible says this concerning the law
[1:00:20] amen we we live in a time that everybody
[1:00:22] you read something in the old testament
[1:00:24] and they say well that was the old
[1:00:26] testament that's just the law amen but
[1:00:28] christ never did away with the law but
[1:00:30] he fulfilled all the law is that correct
[1:00:32] and when romans 7 and 12 would read
[1:00:35] how the law was pure and holy wherefore
[1:00:37] the law is holy and the commandment holy
[1:00:41] and just and good now to break the word
[1:00:43] of god is what we would call sin or in
[1:00:45] other words we would call it unbelief
[1:00:47] amen and to break the law it throws you
[1:00:50] into a state of debt amen so we
[1:00:52] understand that a law without a penalty
[1:00:54] is not a law so when you break the law
[1:00:56] you're under a penalty you're under a
[1:00:59] debt is that right
[1:01:01] amen romans 6 and 23 would read this for
[1:01:03] the wages of sin in other words the debt
[1:01:06] of sin to be paid is death
[1:01:08] but the gift of god is eternal life
[1:01:10] through jesus christ our lord
[1:01:13] final place in the scripture the book of
[1:01:15] genesis the second chapter
[1:01:17] we'll read the 15th verse down to the
[1:01:19] 17th and then we'll let you be seated
[1:01:21] genesis 2
[1:01:22] and 15
[1:01:24] the bible says this in the beginning and
[1:01:26] the lord god took the man and put him
[1:01:29] into the garden of eden to dress it and
[1:01:30] to keep it the lord god commanded the
[1:01:33] man saying of every tree of the garden
[1:01:35] thou mayest freely eat but the tree of
[1:01:38] the knowledge of good and evil thou
[1:01:40] shalt not eat of it for in that day that
[1:01:42] thou eat us thereof
[1:01:44] thou shalt surely die we pray that god
[1:01:46] will bless the reading of his word as
[1:01:48] you may be seated just for a short
[1:01:49] amount of time i want to speak to you by
[1:01:51] the help of god on the subject of grace
[1:01:54] has met law's requirement
[1:01:56] amen grace has met law as a requirement
[1:01:59] david
[1:02:00] in the psalms and psalms 51 would teach
[1:02:02] us the way that we come into this world
[1:02:05] and we know that we were born into this
[1:02:07] world shaped in sin and iniquity and and
[1:02:09] david covers that here in psalms 51 and
[1:02:11] 4 he says now against thee
[1:02:13] thee only have i sinned and done this
[1:02:16] evil in thy sight that thou mightest be
[1:02:18] justified when thou speakest and be
[1:02:20] clear when thou judge us and behold i
[1:02:23] was shaping in iniquity and then sin did
[1:02:26] my mother conceive me so
[1:02:28] we we can all agree this morning that
[1:02:30] when we were born we were flat-out
[1:02:32] lawbreakers amen we were born
[1:02:34] automatically breaking the law we was
[1:02:36] born a sinner we was born shaped in sin
[1:02:39] amen the very human nature was the
[1:02:41] nature to to send a man and to have
[1:02:44] unbelief and brother i'm going to say
[1:02:46] this in the message how can i overcome
[1:02:47] in 63 he was saying no see as i said at
[1:02:50] the beginning you are born defeated and
[1:02:53] that birth can never bring you to life
[1:02:55] because you're born defeated amen you're
[1:02:58] in a defeated world amongst defeated
[1:03:00] people amongst defeated creeds i mean
[1:03:03] it's a pretty damn picture he's painting
[1:03:05] isn't it amongst defeated creeds
[1:03:07] defeated nominations and you've got to
[1:03:09] come to victory some way so so i just
[1:03:12] want to build a foundation in this and
[1:03:14] to show you by the law we are defeated
[1:03:16] creatures amen by the law we're a
[1:03:18] hundred percent defeated we've got no
[1:03:20] hope amen to keep the law and to live by
[1:03:23] the law we're a defeated people
[1:03:25] amen now in the book of leviticus it
[1:03:27] teaches us that a murderer shall be put
[1:03:29] to death in leviticus 24 and 17 in the
[1:03:32] law of moses the bible would say this
[1:03:34] and he that killeth any man shall surely
[1:03:37] be put to death and you say well brother
[1:03:38] solomon i never killed nobody and never
[1:03:41] murdered anybody but actually that's
[1:03:42] that's incorrect amen we will amen when
[1:03:45] christ died amen he paid for the sins of
[1:03:48] the past paid for the sins of the
[1:03:50] present and paid for the sins of the
[1:03:52] future amen so even though you wasn't
[1:03:54] born amen there was still a amen christ
[1:03:58] still paid for every sin you would ever
[1:04:00] commit amen that was upon his shoulders
[1:04:03] amen and it was our sins that put him
[1:04:05] upon the cross so so that does away with
[1:04:08] the thought that we're not murderers we
[1:04:09] were born a murderer amen it was our sin
[1:04:12] that nailed him upon that cross is that
[1:04:14] correct i remember the man covers it
[1:04:16] here he says no you're just as guilty of
[1:04:18] his blood as pilate was it's on your
[1:04:21] hands you can't wash it off did you ever
[1:04:23] think about that so so by the law amen
[1:04:26] the law says that we should surely be
[1:04:28] put to death is that right amen a
[1:04:31] murderer shall be put to death now now
[1:04:33] that's the law that's in the bible
[1:04:35] amen so so we could say it this way this
[1:04:38] morning when we were born even as
[1:04:40] children i mean you're born with a debt
[1:04:42] that hangs over your head and when
[1:04:44] you're born and you see that debt is a
[1:04:47] debt that we have broken the laws of god
[1:04:49] we've broken the wall of god amen then
[1:04:52] that's the debt that amen any child amen
[1:04:55] even a child must come to the lord and
[1:04:56] receive salvation is that right amen so
[1:04:59] we're born with all of this debt that
[1:05:01] hangs upon our shoulders that's a 12
[1:05:03] year old boy a 13 year old kid you're
[1:05:06] born with a debt that hangs over you
[1:05:08] that weighs upon your shoulders and what
[1:05:11] that dead is it's a debt that you have
[1:05:13] broken the law of god and you've broken
[1:05:15] the word of god amen but i want to give
[1:05:17] you some good news amen we focused on
[1:05:19] some negative here for a moment and i i
[1:05:22] want you to know everything that's in
[1:05:24] you you're completely defeated without
[1:05:26] him amen there's no hope amen without
[1:05:30] him amen there's simply no way to make
[1:05:33] it amen but grace met the requirement of
[1:05:36] the law amen we were born with all this
[1:05:38] debt hanging above us but grace has met
[1:05:41] the requirement of the law amen now law
[1:05:44] would keep us out of his presence amen
[1:05:46] if we would all be living by the law and
[1:05:48] didn't have grace we wouldn't be here
[1:05:50] this morning amen we could not step into
[1:05:52] the presence of a holy and pure god
[1:05:55] amen underneath the law amen amen let me
[1:05:59] just say it to you like this amen we're
[1:06:01] without hope to live under the law amen
[1:06:04] if it was just by the law none of us
[1:06:06] would be here we couldn't be in his
[1:06:08] presence amen we can never even get
[1:06:10] close to his presence because of the law
[1:06:13] amen let me say it there ain't anybody
[1:06:15] in here that has had any hope within
[1:06:18] yourself amen to come into the presence
[1:06:21] of the almighty god amen but because
[1:06:24] grace has met every requirement amen it
[1:06:27] has enabled us to come into the presence
[1:06:30] of him
[1:06:31] amen it's enabled us to be gathered
[1:06:33] together and to be in his midst
[1:06:36] hallelujah
[1:06:38] amen grace has met all the requirement
[1:06:41] of the law amen it's grace that has
[1:06:44] brought us into the presence of god now
[1:06:46] brother adam would pick this up there in
[1:06:48] the beginning amen and would teach that
[1:06:50] the first covenant that god established
[1:06:52] with man would be the adamic covenant
[1:06:54] it's the covenant that god made with
[1:06:56] adam amen and what that covenant was
[1:06:59] it's a covenant that means if you do
[1:07:01] this then i'll do this amen if you do
[1:07:04] this then i'll do this now you can eat
[1:07:06] of every tree in the garden but the tree
[1:07:08] in the midst of the garden you cannot
[1:07:10] eat so if you don't do this i'll do this
[1:07:13] amen it's a covenant that relies upon
[1:07:16] the works of a man amen it's a law that
[1:07:19] god establishes that relies on what you
[1:07:21] can do
[1:07:22] amen and that's the law that god
[1:07:24] established in the beginning was a law
[1:07:26] that if you do this then i'll do this
[1:07:29] that's the way that god started him
[1:07:31] amen god established a law with mankind
[1:07:35] and we find that immediately man broke
[1:07:38] that law amen man could not keep his
[1:07:40] side of the covenant up amen man
[1:07:43] it's in the literal dna of a man that he
[1:07:46] can't keep the word of god with his own
[1:07:48] strength amen the first man adam that
[1:07:50] was born and yet even himself he did not
[1:07:53] have enough string to keep the covenant
[1:07:55] of god
[1:07:56] to keep the law of god now listen that
[1:07:58] was not a surprise to god being that god
[1:08:01] is all-knowing god knew what adam would
[1:08:03] do before he did it but it was all in
[1:08:05] the great plan of god that god would
[1:08:07] even give him this law was to be able to
[1:08:10] display grace at the end
[1:08:13] amen so it was not a surprise amen that
[1:08:16] adam did what he did i mean it wasn't
[1:08:18] amen god wasn't shocked when adam
[1:08:20] couldn't keep his end of the deal amen
[1:08:22] he was not shot he wasn't surprised when
[1:08:25] adam couldn't keep the word he knew
[1:08:28] amen that adam didn't have the strength
[1:08:30] to keep the word of god and to keep the
[1:08:32] law of god but y'all would make a way
[1:08:34] even now see whenever there's a law
[1:08:36] there must be a payment of the penalty
[1:08:39] of the law you just bear with me as we
[1:08:41] build a foundation in this amen i'm
[1:08:44] going somewhere in it whenever there's a
[1:08:45] law amen the law is broken there must be
[1:08:48] a payment or there must be a penalty of
[1:08:51] the law now
[1:08:52] the message is the all-coming storm but
[1:08:54] the mom covers it here he says now god
[1:08:56] is just and he has law any law that is
[1:08:59] broken has to have a penalty to it now
[1:09:03] any law that is broken but has no
[1:09:05] penalty it is not a law you cannot break
[1:09:08] the laws of god without having to pay
[1:09:11] for it somewhere we i mean we agree with
[1:09:14] that you cannot break god's law without
[1:09:17] having to pay for the law somewhere amen
[1:09:20] you can't break the law without there
[1:09:22] being a penalty you must do what the
[1:09:24] bible said i mean now i want you to
[1:09:26] notice what god did after that the
[1:09:29] children amen in the garden of eden they
[1:09:31] broke the law of god amen now now god
[1:09:34] didn't say well you know i i guess you
[1:09:36] broke the law it's okay i'll just figure
[1:09:38] it out it's okay you amen no god kept up
[1:09:41] his end of the covenant he said the day
[1:09:44] that you eat thereof you shall surely
[1:09:46] die
[1:09:47] now listen god didn't just you know fold
[1:09:48] his arms and say well i guess it ain't a
[1:09:50] big deal he couldn't keep up his end of
[1:09:52] the deal he couldn't keep the law that i
[1:09:54] came but no god actually meant the law
[1:09:57] that he gave amen and when god puts the
[1:10:00] law in the bible even god himself must
[1:10:03] live by that law and god himself must
[1:10:06] operate by that law you say how can you
[1:10:08] say that because when god gave the law
[1:10:10] in the beginning that that day amen now
[1:10:12] listen no doubt god loved adam and eve
[1:10:15] as his first two children he loved him
[1:10:17] with all of his heart but yet when they
[1:10:19] broke the law god said i've got to keep
[1:10:21] what i've said i've got to keep the law
[1:10:25] i wrote this law my law was holy my law
[1:10:27] is pure i can't do away with it i've got
[1:10:30] to keep it because i god have put this
[1:10:33] law into effect but i want you to notice
[1:10:35] this god made the law
[1:10:37] amen and the law was pure the law is
[1:10:40] holy the law is just amen and he he knew
[1:10:43] brother solomon that he would break that
[1:10:44] law amen amen upon the knowledge of
[1:10:47] knowing he would break the law he would
[1:10:50] also make grace and he would make a way
[1:10:53] back from them that it broke the law
[1:10:56] i want to give you a picture here by the
[1:10:57] troy amen after they had broke the law
[1:11:00] of god god did watch amen god took a
[1:11:03] lamb
[1:11:05] i said god took a lamb amen they had all
[1:11:08] the debt of the law on them brother they
[1:11:11] now had condemnation for breaking the
[1:11:13] law of god they now had guilt they aim
[1:11:16] and adam can look over to eve and say
[1:11:18] i've never felt this way before i've
[1:11:20] never i've never felt sorrow like this
[1:11:22] i've never felt condemnation like this
[1:11:25] amen they have all these strange
[1:11:27] emotions that they're now dealing with
[1:11:29] amen they have all of this battle
[1:11:31] because they broke the law of god
[1:11:33] but notice when they broke the law of
[1:11:35] god it put god in action
[1:11:37] amen when they broke the law of god it
[1:11:39] put god in action and you say preacher
[1:11:41] what did god do god immediately what'd
[1:11:44] he do as he sent him out of the garden
[1:11:46] by the random dramatized it he said god
[1:11:48] went and took a lamb
[1:11:50] and he slayed that lamb is that right he
[1:11:53] slayed the lamb and he took the skin of
[1:11:56] that bloody lamb and he put that skin
[1:11:58] around his children
[1:12:00] amen and a parallels in the book of
[1:12:02] hebrews amen that without the shedding
[1:12:05] of blood there is no remission of sin
[1:12:08] amen amen in the scripture as it shows
[1:12:11] that how god even covered that lamb
[1:12:13] around his children he was given a
[1:12:15] prophecy all the way back in the book of
[1:12:18] genesis
[1:12:19] amen i'm covering you with the animal
[1:12:21] i'm covering you with the skins of the
[1:12:24] lamb and god was putting the prophecy in
[1:12:27] the scripture amen that one day amen
[1:12:30] there's gonna be another lamb that's
[1:12:31] gonna come
[1:12:32] there's gonna be another land and it
[1:12:34] won't be the last it won't be the blood
[1:12:36] of an animal but it will be my very own
[1:12:39] blood
[1:12:40] amen god put a prophecy all the way in
[1:12:43] the book of genesis as he put those
[1:12:45] lambskins around his children but let me
[1:12:48] say it to you like this brother all it
[1:12:50] did was cover up adam and eve
[1:12:53] all it did was cover them up even but he
[1:12:55] put a prophecy in there and it was a
[1:12:58] greater it was a greater lamb that was
[1:13:01] going to come into lambskin amen listen
[1:13:04] church amen the lambskin there in the
[1:13:06] beginning all it did was cover them up
[1:13:09] but the lamb that would be coming it
[1:13:11] would not only cover up the believer but
[1:13:14] it would abolish the sin
[1:13:16] it would not cover the sin it would take
[1:13:19] the nature of the sin
[1:13:21] and it would wash all the sin
[1:13:24] out of the believer i say o lamb of god
[1:13:28] how great thou art
[1:13:32] hallelujah
[1:13:35] i want you to notice this amen adam and
[1:13:37] eve didn't go kill a lamb
[1:13:40] adam and eve didn't go say well there's
[1:13:41] a lamb but god himself brother
[1:13:44] i said god himself went and slew a lamb
[1:13:49] amen you say preacher what are you
[1:13:50] saying this is what i'm saying god
[1:13:53] himself has made a sacrifice
[1:13:56] amen god himself has made a sacrifice
[1:13:59] for you brother amen god ain't looking
[1:14:01] for you to kill a lamb god ain't looking
[1:14:04] for you to say a lamb he's looking for
[1:14:06] you to accept the lamb that's already
[1:14:09] been given
[1:14:11] hallelujah
[1:14:15] amen now the first covenant
[1:14:17] amen was a covenant it would be called a
[1:14:19] workspace covenant
[1:14:21] thank you brother
[1:14:22] amen i want you to realize something
[1:14:24] though there wasn't anything
[1:14:26] after they broke the law of god there
[1:14:28] wasn't anything they could do to mend
[1:14:30] the fellowship
[1:14:32] there wasn't anything they could do to
[1:14:34] redeem themselves back to a pure estate
[1:14:38] amen let me say it to you like this
[1:14:39] there ain't any good works that you can
[1:14:41] do that can redeem yourself
[1:14:44] back to a perfect estate as a son and
[1:14:47] daughter of god amen let me just throw
[1:14:49] that out the window amen listen the the
[1:14:52] first covenant got started in the
[1:14:53] beginning it was a workspace covenant
[1:14:56] but we're not under the old covenant no
[1:14:58] longer we're not under a workspace
[1:15:01] covenant we're under an abrahamic
[1:15:03] covenant which is i have already done
[1:15:07] i have already you just accept what i
[1:15:11] have done
[1:15:12] i've already done it it's no longer
[1:15:15] relying on your works it's no longer
[1:15:17] relying on your ability i mean i don't
[1:15:20] know about you but that's from shouting
[1:15:21] ground
[1:15:22] god ain't relying on my ability god
[1:15:25] ain't relying on my good works god ain't
[1:15:27] relying on what i can do but he's
[1:15:29] relying on my lamb
[1:15:31] amen that has took my place
[1:15:34] hallelujah
[1:15:36] the faith of abraham by the way talks on
[1:15:38] that covenant he said no you know he
[1:15:39] said to abram amen adam and the adamic
[1:15:42] covenant if you'll not do this and you
[1:15:44] won't do that he said but see adam
[1:15:47] turned right around and broke it another
[1:15:49] place i want you to notice when god made
[1:15:51] his first covenant the adam covenant the
[1:15:53] adamic covenant he made it between him
[1:15:56] and adam and man turned right around and
[1:15:59] broke the covenant amen now listen these
[1:16:01] are the first two children of god and
[1:16:04] they couldn't do it brother and when
[1:16:06] they couldn't keep the law they couldn't
[1:16:08] fulfill the law they must say why would
[1:16:10] we think
[1:16:12] i mean why would we say that we we've
[1:16:14] got enough good works and a good i mean
[1:16:16] good enough church attendance that we
[1:16:18] can do it on our own brother let me say
[1:16:20] this your your very best works is a
[1:16:23] filthy rag in the side of god your very
[1:16:25] best ability god ain't looking for your
[1:16:28] abilities looking for your heart
[1:16:30] hallelujah
[1:16:32] amen every time god makes a covenant
[1:16:34] with man man breaks it every time he
[1:16:37] made a covenant with man man breaks his
[1:16:38] cabinet he does it yet today man will
[1:16:41] always break his covenant with god
[1:16:44] amen but god can't break his covenant
[1:16:47] with man amen man always breaks his
[1:16:49] covenant man has always tried to find
[1:16:52] some way to save himself isn't that the
[1:16:54] nature of man right there i mean we're
[1:16:56] always trying to figure it out on our
[1:16:58] own we're always trying to work
[1:17:00] ourselves into it i mean some of y'all
[1:17:02] know what i'm talking about some of your
[1:17:03] brothers i mean to get yourself in a
[1:17:05] bind and you know you can't fix it
[1:17:07] you know you can't do it and but as a
[1:17:10] man as human nature you're like well
[1:17:12] i'ma try it anyway
[1:17:15] even some of you know what i'm talking
[1:17:16] about well i don't really know how to
[1:17:18] take apart that engine but hey i'ma try
[1:17:20] it anyway
[1:17:21] i mean that's the nature of man want to
[1:17:23] get in want to fix it want to get in and
[1:17:25] make it better i remember listening
[1:17:27] church listen what the prophet saying
[1:17:29] man has always tried to find a way to
[1:17:31] save himself or to make himself he said
[1:17:34] it comes from a strand in the garden of
[1:17:36] eden when man realized he had sinned he
[1:17:39] tried to make himself a religion make
[1:17:41] himself a covering amen adam and eve
[1:17:43] sold fig leaves together and made
[1:17:45] themselves a religion he says and since
[1:17:48] it's been a strain of man down through
[1:17:50] the age trying to do something to save
[1:17:52] himself but you are saved by grace
[1:17:57] amen you are saved by grace not ability
[1:18:00] you are saved by grace not by law you
[1:18:02] are saved by grace not by good works
[1:18:05] hallelujah
[1:18:07] amen man cannot keep up his side in the
[1:18:10] covenant amen now i want you to notice
[1:18:13] amen the law of god you you you read and
[1:18:16] i mean throughout the whole book of
[1:18:17] leviticus it's very amazing if you
[1:18:19] actually study it out and look at the
[1:18:21] law in the book of leviticus it's very
[1:18:23] staggering to live by that law i
[1:18:25] couldn't imagine
[1:18:26] amen all the little ordinance to keep
[1:18:28] all the little things you can't do you
[1:18:29] can do amen but i want to cover just a
[1:18:32] little bit here amen and this is the
[1:18:34] requirement of being a priest in the
[1:18:36] bible
[1:18:37] in leviticus 21 and 17 we read it this
[1:18:40] way now speak unto aaron saying
[1:18:42] whatsoever he be of thy seed in their
[1:18:44] generations that hath any blemish let
[1:18:47] him not approach to offer the bread of
[1:18:49] his god amen so there we have having a
[1:18:52] blemish don't let him approach the bread
[1:18:53] of his god for whatsoever man he be that
[1:18:56] hath the blemish he shall not approach a
[1:18:59] blind man or a lame he that hath a flat
[1:19:02] nose or anything superfluous or a man
[1:19:05] that has broken footed or broken hand or
[1:19:07] a crook back or a chore for amen or that
[1:19:10] hath a blemish in his eye or be scurvy
[1:19:12] or scribed or as stones be broken no man
[1:19:16] that hath the blemish of the seed of
[1:19:17] aaron the priest shall come nigh to
[1:19:20] offer the offerings of the lord made by
[1:19:22] fire he that hath the blemish he shall
[1:19:25] not come nigh to offer the bread of god
[1:19:29] amen listen church this is amen this is
[1:19:32] covering probably most everybody in here
[1:19:34] those that have a crooked back those who
[1:19:36] have a flat nose though the cab those
[1:19:38] that have a blemish those that have this
[1:19:40] and this and this among those that have
[1:19:42] broken a bone i'm gonna listen these are
[1:19:44] the requirements of being a priest amen
[1:19:47] in the old testament and i was going to
[1:19:49] preach on this for a minute i mean amen
[1:19:52] ever since a young boy i got in an
[1:19:53] accident and i've had problems with my
[1:19:55] back keeping my posture straight now i
[1:19:57] know according to the law those were the
[1:19:59] crooked back you couldn't be a priest
[1:20:02] and some of y'all you've broken a bone
[1:20:05] according to the law you couldn't be a
[1:20:06] priest i mean you couldn't come to god
[1:20:09] and offer the bread of god amen
[1:20:11] according to the law those that have a
[1:20:13] blemish on their face those that have a
[1:20:15] scab on their face and when they
[1:20:17] couldn't approach god and offer the
[1:20:19] bread of god you say preacher what are
[1:20:21] you saying amen i want to show you the
[1:20:24] law in the bible amen listen church i
[1:20:27] mean this would disqualify many people
[1:20:30] in here as being a priest but listen
[1:20:33] church grace has met the requirement of
[1:20:36] the law
[1:20:38] amen grace has met the requirement of
[1:20:40] the law brother and those with the
[1:20:43] cricket nose and those with the with the
[1:20:45] blemish and those with their broken bone
[1:20:47] and those amen that's full of bodily
[1:20:50] problems and issues in the new covenant
[1:20:53] the new testament and the bible says
[1:20:55] that he hath made us kings and he has
[1:20:59] made us praise
[1:21:01] in the old testament with the joy it was
[1:21:04] impossible for you to come in and give
[1:21:07] our offering unto god it was impossible
[1:21:10] for us to come to the presence of god
[1:21:13] and give us our offering but ever since
[1:21:16] grace has met the requirement underneath
[1:21:19] the new covenant we can come into the
[1:21:21] house of god
[1:21:23] whereas presence he is and we can offer
[1:21:26] bread of praise and bread of worship
[1:21:30] those that were full of issues those
[1:21:32] that were full of problems those that
[1:21:34] were full of sin by the troy
[1:21:37] we have now been able to come in as a
[1:21:40] priest unto god
[1:21:42] and give sacrifice of praise and worship
[1:21:46] you say how can we do it because grace
[1:21:50] has met the requirements
[1:21:55] and god ain't looking at me
[1:21:57] god ain't looking at you
[1:22:00] he's not looking at your good words
[1:22:02] he's not looking at your clean living
[1:22:04] and your ability
[1:22:06] he's looking at your lamb
[1:22:09] hallelujah
[1:22:14] i want you to notice this
[1:22:16] even a priest in the bible he can meet
[1:22:19] all this criteria
[1:22:21] he could be
[1:22:22] i mean listen church this cuts this cuts
[1:22:25] out a lot of people doesn't it
[1:22:27] i know many of us we've had i mean these
[1:22:29] qualifications that cut out me i cut out
[1:22:31] many of you that's here
[1:22:33] amen but even if they fit all this
[1:22:36] criteria
[1:22:37] they still
[1:22:38] amen had to slay a lamb
[1:22:42] even though they met all this criteria
[1:22:45] they still had to slay a lamb
[1:22:48] and had to offer the lamb
[1:22:50] showing that the believer amen even your
[1:22:53] best amount of works
[1:22:55] even your cleanest living you can do
[1:22:57] brother even the greatest ability you've
[1:23:00] got
[1:23:01] it still requires a lamb
[1:23:07] hallelujah
[1:23:08] in other words the very best we can do
[1:23:10] still ain't enough
[1:23:11] our very best abilities still ain't good
[1:23:14] enough even the very best things we can
[1:23:16] offer is still ain't good enough amen
[1:23:19] now you still haven't islam and that
[1:23:20] just ain't fair we're we're not here
[1:23:22] living by the law and i i want to say
[1:23:25] this because there's some confusion in
[1:23:26] this amen people say well
[1:23:29] the law of god that was just the law and
[1:23:31] law don't mean nothing the law ain't
[1:23:33] good and allowing this do you realize
[1:23:35] that god himself wrote that law
[1:23:38] god himself brother so you're saying
[1:23:41] what god said don't mean anything
[1:23:43] amen god wrote something now don't
[1:23:45] confuse me i'm not saying we're living
[1:23:47] by the letter we're not but give me some
[1:23:49] grace in this amen god himself with a
[1:23:51] willie he put that law and ordinance it
[1:23:54] was the mind of god and god wrote that
[1:23:56] law and i want to read to you what god
[1:23:58] and what david would say about it in
[1:24:00] psalms 19 and 7 the law of the lord is
[1:24:03] perfect
[1:24:07] the law of the lord is perfect
[1:24:09] so when you want to say the lie no good
[1:24:11] go quote this scripture instead the law
[1:24:13] of the lord is perfect converting the
[1:24:16] soul the testimony of the lord is pure
[1:24:18] making wise the simple the statutes of
[1:24:21] the lord are right
[1:24:23] rejoice in the heart the commandment of
[1:24:25] the lord is pure
[1:24:27] amen so let me go on record and say this
[1:24:29] there ain't nothing wrong with his word
[1:24:32] there ain't nothing wrong with his law
[1:24:35] i mean the only thing wrong is ask
[1:24:37] people
[1:24:38] amen they're not good enough to keep the
[1:24:40] law amen there ain't no problem with his
[1:24:42] word there ain't no problem with his law
[1:24:45] even the promised humanity that looks at
[1:24:48] the law and says well well i just don't
[1:24:50] know about that amen but let me give you
[1:24:52] some good words here amen we're not here
[1:24:54] trying to keep all the letter but we are
[1:24:57] here under grace amen for grace has met
[1:25:00] all the requirement of the law i want
[1:25:03] you to keep that in your mind even the
[1:25:05] law is good the law was perfect it's the
[1:25:08] mind of god and god established his law
[1:25:11] in the old testament
[1:25:14] and the message hear ye him but the womb
[1:25:15] talks about the law he says now the law
[1:25:18] only puts you in jail
[1:25:20] if he was under law probably most of us
[1:25:22] well all of us wouldn't be here because
[1:25:24] we're murderers
[1:25:25] we wouldn't be here if it was to the law
[1:25:27] everyone says the law puts you in jail
[1:25:30] the law puts you under condemnation the
[1:25:32] law magnifies it was to policemen that
[1:25:35] come and it caught you by the arm and
[1:25:37] said you're guilty
[1:25:39] and you're under the penalty of death
[1:25:42] amen the law has no redeeming grace but
[1:25:45] grace has come by jesus christ
[1:25:48] not by the law i don't plead the law i
[1:25:51] don't want nothing to do with the law i
[1:25:53] want grace this is the prophet of this
[1:25:56] generation i don't want nothing to do
[1:25:59] with the law i want grace hey man listen
[1:26:02] law was a policeman that caught you by
[1:26:05] the arm and said you're guilty amen law
[1:26:08] was a policeman that ran after you when
[1:26:11] you broke the laws of god and it said
[1:26:13] you're guilty let me just go on record
[1:26:15] and say it like this there ain't a
[1:26:17] single person in here that's not guilty
[1:26:20] under the law we are all guilty amen let
[1:26:24] me say that to you like this amen the
[1:26:26] devil didn't have to make anything up
[1:26:28] about us he didn't have to lie on us we
[1:26:31] we were actually sinners
[1:26:33] we actually sinned the devil didn't have
[1:26:36] to write a lie about us he had evidence
[1:26:38] brother we broke the law we were sinners
[1:26:44] i'm trying not to get ahead of myself i
[1:26:45] want to get to the good
[1:26:47] some of these other parts amen but
[1:26:49] listen church under the law we're
[1:26:51] completely guilty the devil didn't have
[1:26:54] to lie when he said you're guilty we
[1:26:55] were guilty but grace
[1:26:58] hallelujah but grace has met the
[1:27:01] requirement of the law
[1:27:04] as i said the penalty amen of breaking
[1:27:07] the law is death in romans 6 23 the
[1:27:09] wages of sin is death but the gift of
[1:27:12] god is eternal life through jesus christ
[1:27:16] our lord so so in other words the
[1:27:18] penalty of our sin is death
[1:27:22] pretty hopeless case is it not
[1:27:24] the penalty of us breaking the law is
[1:27:26] death you say but it's on your awful
[1:27:28] negative i'm not i'm showing you
[1:27:29] something i'm in the penalty of breaking
[1:27:32] the law is death
[1:27:34] unless somebody else takes your penalty
[1:27:37] oh god
[1:27:40] unless somebody else pays the penalty
[1:27:43] now listen we're born debtors are we not
[1:27:45] as a little boy me being a little 13
[1:27:47] year old kid i i had dead on my
[1:27:50] shoulders
[1:27:51] i i walked around as a teenager with
[1:27:53] debt i walked around as a boy with beds
[1:27:57] and then hanging up on my shoulders and
[1:28:00] the debt had to get paid brother the
[1:28:02] debt was death
[1:28:04] oh brother i said the debt was death
[1:28:08] so unless one came
[1:28:10] and paid the debt
[1:28:12] i was on death row
[1:28:15] you was on death row
[1:28:17] you was under a death sentence brother
[1:28:19] amen he was under 100
[1:28:21] death sentence and you were guilty
[1:28:24] unless somebody else
[1:28:27] paid the debt
[1:28:28] unless somebody else paid the penalty
[1:28:32] amen now now we're going through the law
[1:28:34] here in leviticus 25 we'll talk about a
[1:28:36] kinsmen redeemer
[1:28:39] hallelujah
[1:28:40] amen in leviticus 25 and 48 after he
[1:28:43] that is sold he may be redeemed again
[1:28:47] one of us brethren may redeem him
[1:28:50] oh brother this is a kinsmen redeemer
[1:28:52] scripture this is the law saying that
[1:28:54] wants to be redeemed then it must be kin
[1:28:57] either his uncle or his uncle's science
[1:29:00] may redeem him or any that is nigh of
[1:29:03] kin
[1:29:04] unto him or others family may redeem him
[1:29:08] or he be able he may redeem himself so
[1:29:12] according to the law the only one that
[1:29:15] could pay the penalty
[1:29:17] of redemption
[1:29:18] had to be kin
[1:29:20] amen now listen church god wrote this
[1:29:23] law did he not
[1:29:25] god wrote this law and in the back part
[1:29:28] of god's mind as he was writing it he
[1:29:31] was thinking one of these days i'm going
[1:29:33] to fulfill my very own law
[1:29:36] hallelujah one of these days i'm going
[1:29:39] to fulfill my very own law and the law
[1:29:42] said
[1:29:43] that it required a kinsmen redeemer
[1:29:46] to redeem a son or daughter so what did
[1:29:50] god do god said i wrote the law i must
[1:29:53] abide by my own law and he took a blood
[1:29:57] sale and created it and wrapped himself
[1:30:00] in the blood cell and he put it in the
[1:30:02] womb of a virgin
[1:30:04] and then jesus said i'm not just your
[1:30:07] master i am your brother
[1:30:10] hallelujah and god himself
[1:30:13] became one of us
[1:30:15] god himself became our friend he became
[1:30:19] our brother he became kin to us that he
[1:30:22] may redeem us you say preacher what are
[1:30:25] you saying i'm saying god has made the
[1:30:27] law
[1:30:28] and he had provided himself a sacrifice
[1:30:33] where he made the law and then he
[1:30:36] fulfilled the law
[1:30:41] hallelujah
[1:30:42] [Applause]
[1:30:45] he made the law
[1:30:46] he said well the law says it requires a
[1:30:49] kingman's word and a kinsmen redeemer so
[1:30:52] i guess the only way this is going to
[1:30:53] happen is i'm going to have to put on
[1:30:56] flesh
[1:30:57] oh brother
[1:30:58] amen so we were under the penalty of
[1:31:01] death
[1:31:02] hallelujah
[1:31:04] we was under the penalty of death
[1:31:07] and then grace wrapped himself in a
[1:31:09] blood cell and grace put himself in the
[1:31:13] womb of a virgin and then grace was a
[1:31:16] child and a manger amen then grace he
[1:31:20] fulfilled all the law
[1:31:22] hallelujah
[1:31:23] i feel like preaching on this i said
[1:31:26] grace fulfilled all the law
[1:31:30] amen the law said brother troy that the
[1:31:33] lamb must be spotless the lamb must be
[1:31:36] pure the lamb must be without blemish
[1:31:39] i say our lamb
[1:31:41] he was spotless he was sinless
[1:31:44] he was without blemish
[1:31:46] even pilate himself said why are you
[1:31:49] condemning him
[1:31:50] i find no fault in him
[1:31:53] and our lamb
[1:31:55] fulfilled every requirement
[1:31:58] to be our redeemer
[1:32:01] he fulfilled
[1:32:02] every requirement
[1:32:04] amen to be a kinsman redeemer to be our
[1:32:07] lamb
[1:32:08] and lamb
[1:32:10] paid the price
[1:32:17] hallelujah
[1:32:21] he walked the shores of galilee
[1:32:23] fulfilling the law
[1:32:24] fulfilling the law
[1:32:26] amen what did christ himself say brother
[1:32:28] willie he said i didn't come to do away
[1:32:31] with it

[1:32:35] i didn't come to put away the law i come
[1:32:38] to fulfill

[1:32:57] that it took to be the lamb
[1:33:00] i want you to notice something powerful
[1:33:02] in this
[1:33:04] i mean in the old covenant
[1:33:06] i remember when you was a sinner amen
[1:33:09] you went to go give a lamb

[1:33:13] the lamb sacrificed them an oxen when
[1:33:15] you went to shed blood aiming the priest
[1:33:17] would come to your household
[1:33:20] the priest would come to your household
[1:33:23] and whatever lamb you gave
[1:33:25] but you was looking that lamb over
[1:33:28] he was looking underneath his ears you
[1:33:31] were lifting up his leg he was being
[1:33:33] sure there was no blemish in the lamb
[1:33:36] he was being sure that the black that
[1:33:38] the lamb had no problems had no issues

[1:33:55] relied on that lamb
[1:33:57] your future relied on that lamb
[1:34:00] so you was really careful when you was
[1:34:03] inspecting it and god i can imagine it
[1:34:06] they'd go and set that lamb out there
[1:34:08] and i want you to notice something in
[1:34:09] this the high priest wasn't looking
[1:34:12] at the person who gave the lamb
[1:34:15] the high priest wasn't looking for the
[1:34:17] solomon at the person's faults the
[1:34:19] person's failures the person's problems
[1:34:22] amen
[1:34:24] hallelujah amen

[1:34:36] requirement

[1:34:41] gave that lamb they were all nervous
[1:34:43] thinking oh god oh god i hope that the
[1:34:45] lamb makes it i hope because he realized
[1:34:48] his future
[1:34:49] rested on that lamb
[1:34:52] amen and the priest examined the lamb
[1:34:56] and if it was spotless if they didn't
[1:34:58] have a blemish he said this one will do
[1:35:02] and let me say this amen god tested him

[1:39:09] ground he had no form nor conless that
[1:39:12] we shall see him there is no beauty
[1:39:16] that we should desire and he fulfilled
[1:39:18] that
[1:39:20] he fulfilled exactly what the scripture
[1:39:22] said he is despised and rejected a man
[1:39:26] a man of sorrows acquainted with grief
[1:39:29] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[1:39:32] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[1:39:36] surely
[1:39:37] he hath borne our griefs he carried our
[1:39:41] sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken
[1:39:44] smitten of god and afflicted all we like
[1:39:48] sheep have gone astray we have turned
[1:39:50] every one to his own way and the lord
[1:39:53] hath laid on him the iniquity of us all
[1:39:58] amen listen church every person under

[1:40:19] he's thinking
[1:40:21] i don't know if i can do it
[1:40:25] brother joy he began to think of your
[1:40:26] sin
[1:40:28] he thinks of the time that you let him
[1:40:30] down
[1:40:31] he thinks of the time you failed him
[1:40:33] amen and no doubt it got hard for the
[1:40:35] lamb every now and then and he kept
[1:40:37] putting one foot in front of the other
[1:40:40] even brother solomon maybe he was seeing
[1:40:41] your sin
[1:40:43] and he hung his head down low and he saw
[1:40:45] the times we would fail him but he kept
[1:40:48] putting one foot in front of the other
[1:40:50] he kept putting foot after foot after
[1:40:52] foot but and he walked up that lonely
[1:40:55] hill
[1:40:56] you say why was he doing it
[1:40:58] grace was meeting all the requirement of
[1:41:01] law
[1:41:02] and the church it was not the three
[1:41:05] nails that kept him on that cross listen
[1:41:09] he could have called legion upon legion
[1:41:12] upon legion of angels at any moment
[1:41:16] but he thought about us and he said i
[1:41:18] want to pay their debts so they don't
[1:41:21] have to
[1:41:22] i want to pay their debt so they won't
[1:41:25] have to

[1:41:31] you owe
[1:41:32] there ain't any debt you've got to pay
[1:41:35] but your debt is paid in full and i want
[1:41:39] to let the devil know the devil i used
[1:41:41] to be guilty but he paid my debt devil
[1:41:44] we used to be bound but he paid my debt
[1:41:47] devil amen we used to be under your
[1:41:50] control but he paid my debt

[1:48:05] he rejoiced that these things were
[1:48:07] hidden from the eyes of the wise and
[1:48:10] prudent
[1:48:11] and revealed church
[1:48:13] and jesus could rejoice i tell you i
[1:48:16] studied that word out and it said a
[1:48:18] sudden burst of emotion
[1:48:21] that would cause one to spin that would
[1:48:23] cause one to jump so i say god
[1:48:27] if you did it when you was on earth so

[1:48:45] the victory over everything
[1:48:48] i'm in church there ain't no use and
[1:48:51] that's letting some devil have his way
[1:48:52] with our lives

[2:00:09] and went and pimped him up
[2:00:12] you ever felt like you had a chain
[2:00:13] around you
[2:00:16] you couldn't break through in worship
[2:00:18] couldn't break through in prayer

[2:00:23] you could only fly but so high because
[2:00:25] you had a chain on you
[2:00:26] that's how that crow felt
[2:00:29] and that crowbar every time he tried to
[2:00:31] rise up a little higher
[2:00:33] that chain would tug on his leg
[2:00:36] and he would remember i've got to be on
[2:00:37] the earth
[2:00:39] i'm chained up
