[18:18] happened but her arms and so my sister's
[18:22] say well we'll watch it she drew a
[18:24] little circle around it just so we can
[18:25] see if the infection spread on a next
[18:28] day and it gotten bigger and red and hot
[18:30] and everything so they end up taking it
[18:32] to the hospital because she started have
[18:34] chest pain and difficulty breathing and
[18:36] all kind of stuff so they got her to the
[18:38] hospital and they immediately started
[18:40] hooking up to IVs and given IV
[18:42] antibiotics so I guess she has some
[18:44] reaction to the vaccine but nevertheless

[18:49] is good she's out of the hospital now
[18:51] she home she doing fine man thank God

[21:32] putting ear in one of my tires and I
[21:34] stood up to get back in the car and all
[21:36] of a sudden the sharp pain went down the
[21:39] right side and I could hardly move or
[21:43] hardly walk and and I just thought maybe
[21:46] it was just my sciatic but it's normally
[21:48] on the left side and I say oh okay
[21:51] whatever you want to move to the right
[21:52] side and but it was such a severe pain
[21:56] that I went home early from work and I
[22:00] did everything that I know to do to try
[22:02] to help relieve the pain the pain stay
[22:04] with me until yesterday actually but as
[22:08] after Sunday's message it every step
[22:12] that I take just it's a possession so
[22:15] instead on I always take the stairs so
[22:18] instead of taking the stairs I was
[22:19] taking the elevator but after the
[22:20] message I started taking the stairs and
[22:22] every step it was so hard and so
[22:25] difficult but I every step I took I said
[22:27] lord I thank you lord I thank you I made
[22:30] it on three flights of stairs came back
[22:32] down three flights of stairs I was
[22:34] hurting but I made it because I kept
[22:36] saying you know I have the victory and I
[22:38] know I have the victory and even tonight
[22:40] just to come and sit in a church like
[22:43] during the week Wednesdays and Fridays

[22:48] pain but I still make it like tonight
[22:51] the devil say well you're gonna walk up
[22:52] there they're gonna see your leg kind of
[22:54] dragon what I still have the victory and
[22:57] I give that all the phrase praise God
[23:05] man hallelujah that were always trying
[23:08] to steal some glory
[23:10] hey man but we thank God for touching
[23:12] our precious sister anybody else want to
[23:15] share it come on sis amen
[23:24] Alma's testimony was when brother sister
[23:26] Yolanda was giving her testimony about
[23:28] the house and stuff I was like anyway
[23:33] after church I text the lady that I'm
[23:36] corresponding with about and the house
[23:42] that I really like was a four-bedroom
[23:44] house and two baths then he was
[23:46] foreclosed and it's a really nice house
[23:48] it had a pool and everything that the
[23:50] kids want in there so anyway so I text
[23:53] and she said oh that house is the house
[23:56] is on contract isn't contract so I was
[24:00] like no we need a studio we need and I
[24:08] was like I just got quiet even say
[24:10] anything
[24:10] so anyway so she text me back with
[24:12] another house and it has had five
[24:14] bedrooms in it and I'm like oh that's
[24:17] the studio so tomorrow she's showing us
[24:19] the house we're coming back down here
[24:21] around 2:30 so I'm a man we agree with
[24:32] you all hallelujah
[24:35] my god hey man yes yes yes you gotta
[24:44] learn to praise God befouled man don't
[24:47] wait to after praising before hey man we
[24:50] agree we agree with a three man
[24:53] hallelujah anybody else want to share
[24:56] anybody else all right praise the Lord
[24:59] all right god bless you hey man thank
[25:05] y'all so much musicians I appreciate you
[25:06] all
[25:08] I'm i'ma tell a testimony it wasn't it's
[25:12] not mine either but I think it would be
[25:14] a blessing to us and I don't think they
[25:18] it would bother the person for me
[25:20] sharing this but we had a situation with
[25:26] a brother Simba's passport and somehow
[25:33] they on this job he gave the passport
[25:36] and a package to the like the mailroom
[25:40] and they said they gave it to you PS I
[25:45] believe and when he you know start
[25:47] trying to do some research UPS said they
[25:49] never received the package and say it's
[25:52] never been scammed we don't have it
[25:54] enough so he's like well being that it's
[25:58] a personal item the job doesn't really
[26:01] record what they sent out if it's
[26:03] personal
[26:03] they'd only record their business you
[26:05] know things so the job really couldn't
[26:07] tell them you know what was what and
[26:08] they say we know we gave it to ups but
[26:11] ups never you know actually scanned at
[26:13] him so he was getting pretty desperate
[26:16] because they told him that if he you
[26:19] know he had some things he had to take
[26:21] care of and if he didn't get that
[26:23] passport back he would have to pay a
[26:24] thousand dollars in order to get it and
[26:27] you know so I was like that was just
[26:29] really that's like the devil don't push
[26:32] me too far you know now you talk about
[26:34] money in my pocket you know and you know
[26:37] so we he'd been you know text all the
[26:40] brothers and let us know about it so um
[26:42] on Tuesday night we decided to put it at
[26:45] the top of our prayer list and we we
[26:47] came and we pray tonight I want to thank
[26:48] God for and that prayer meeting we had
[26:52] was it it was 11 people we had two on
[26:58] skype brothers actually three on skype
[27:02] who else I know brother Solomon brother
[27:05] Nehemiah and who else
[27:06] Josiah brother just say was dead a man
[27:09] and and brother Simba on skype and then
[27:12] we we stuffed all these other brothers
[27:16] inside this room bill a law and Hammer
[27:18] is we got to get some old room right but
[27:21] uh but we stuffed and we got in there we
[27:23] prayed and my what an anointing came
[27:26] during the time of prayer you know just
[27:29] just on on Tuesday night and you know we
[27:32] just we just prayed about it release it
[27:34] into the hands of the Lord and whether
[27:37] Simba Texas all the data say brother
[27:41] somehow they UPS are still looking for
[27:44] the package but it's already they
[27:46] already told me that well the people
[27:48] that risk the people that he was sent to
[27:50] already received it processed it
[27:56] received it processed it sending it back
[28:00] to them it's approved and UPS still
[28:03] looking for and so brother Steven and
[28:12] everybody else are bypassing the
[28:13] processes and God just showed us that
[28:17] he's able to bypass processing and and
[28:19] when we say nothing that's what we mean
[28:24] nothing is impossible to God I mean I've
[28:30] just been reminding the devil of that
[28:31] nothing I mean absolutely nothing right
[28:35] it is impossible with God right and you
[28:38] know but but brother brother Simba you
[28:40] know he was just overjoyed you know that
[28:44] he's getting us back in and and and it
[28:47] actually the approval for what he needed
[28:50] the approval came on the day after the
[28:52] prayer went for so the prayer went forth
[28:54] on Tuesday he got an approve on
[28:56] Wednesday and now you've got notified on
[28:58] Friday it's coming back his way
[29:00] so I God is a good god and and and I am
[29:04] I have found of this year that God has
[29:07] really answered a lot of prayers I mean
[29:10] a lot of prayers God has answered prayer
[29:14] and and I'm just I'm just in this state
[29:18] of mind where I just came to town right
[29:21] I don't care what I'm up against
[29:23] I just I'm sorry I can't doubt I've seen
[29:26] God do too much for me to doubt it it'll
[29:29] be a sin for me to doubt all right I'm
[29:32] gonna just believe man I can't do
[29:35] nothing else right but but just believe
[29:37] right so so you know whatever it is that
[29:40] you might be facing Church this you know
[29:41] be encouraged God is um God is mindful
[29:44] of all things he's mindful of all things
[29:46] and he knows where passports are even he
[29:50] knows he knows everything
[29:52] a man read this we just become team to
[29:55] walk by faith and not by saying I'm
[29:57] gonna read a scripture I try not to take
[30:00] too much of your time tonight but I
[30:02] wanted to just a quick scripture we're
[30:06] still in Luke 1 and I feel in my spirit
[30:13] that I'll kind of come with a part 2 for
[30:15] with God nothing shall be impossible but
[30:17] I wanted to kind of go into another
[30:19] little direction here tonight I
[30:21] mentioned a little bit about it on on
[30:22] Sunday morning and I want to kind of hit
[30:25] it a little bit tonight but Luke 1 let's
[30:28] read verse 37 and 38 let stand and read
[30:30] that real quick and we'll pray over this
[30:32] and I'll let you be seated amen
[30:36] it says this well with God nothing shall
[30:39] be impossible and Mayor said Behold the
[30:43] handmaid of the Lord be it unto me
[30:45] according to thy word and the angel
[30:48] departed from her
[30:49] Amen let's pray over that father we
[30:51] thank you for your word here tonight as
[30:54] we just heard some of the testimonies
[30:57] and things that you've done father we're
[30:59] we're just under expectation for so much
[31:03] more I'm reminded of the testimony that
[31:05] the prophets shared about the man that
[31:08] ate a piece of watermelon and they asked
[31:11] him the question after he eaten a
[31:12] watermelon say did you like it he said
[31:15] it was got to be more where that came
[31:17] from and father we've heard these
[31:19] testimony tonight and we've we've seen
[31:21] of some of the things that you've done
[31:23] but we say to ourselves there's got to
[31:25] be more where that came from so we're
[31:27] under expectation God for even even
[31:30] greater things that as we want to just
[31:33] even put some prayer around this home
[31:36] that the Johnson family is looking for
[31:38] God as they would come on tomorrow
[31:41] father there's nothing nothing
[31:44] absolutely nothing that's impossible
[31:46] so God as they press into that you know
[31:49] of their desires you told us that if we
[31:51] delight ourselves in you that you would
[31:53] give us the desires of our heart so Lord
[31:56] as they would just press their way back
[31:58] here on tomorrow Lord just go before and
[32:01] work everything out somehow move Lord on

[32:10] my father we just acts that you've moved
[32:12] by your spirit and Lord just continued a
[32:14] man to look up underneath of the other

[32:32] expectations
[32:33] lord thank you for Lord the the the way
[32:36] that the giving has happened this year
[32:38] thank you Lord for what this church has
[32:39] been able to accomplish
[32:41] Lord how you just bless the people from
[32:43] throughout the year and Lord we know
[32:45] there's more going into the next year
[32:47] that'll be waiting on us o God we just
[32:49] prepare ourselves for that blessed us
[32:51] now as we enter into this little thought
[32:52] tonight use it for your glorious in
[32:54] Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless
[32:57] you you can be seated just a quick
[33:00] thought on being unto me according to
[33:02] thy word and man be it unto me according
[33:04] to that word let me just start off by
[33:08] reading a couple of things here from the
[33:10] Prophet and I'm reading from the message
[33:14] spoken word was originally part one amen
[33:17] and there's a couple statements that he
[33:22] makes here and paragraph 142 says man
[33:25] wasn't made to die a man I love that I
[33:30] just absolutely love that man wasn't
[33:34] made to die a man he was made to live
[33:40] glory to God and if you ever see a
[33:43] person that's even approaching death
[33:46] they would struggle to continue to live
[33:48] because man wasn't made to die right and
[33:50] and and we know that death only came in
[33:53] after Adam did what he did in the Garden
[33:56] of II a garden of eatin it wasn't until
[33:59] after the fact right but before that he
[34:02] was an eternal being just like God right
[34:04] so man wasn't went so being made in the
[34:07] image of God man was not made to die man
[34:11] was made to live a man but high
[34:15] breathing
[34:16] brought death rather she hybrid it now
[34:21] you deny the serpent seed then I ask you
[34:24] why what's these funeral services about
[34:27] she was hot burying everyone of us our
[34:31] hybrid from the original that's the
[34:34] reason you're constantly dying right he
[34:37] says but all God there's a German life
[34:39] come from the real seat but God proved
[34:42] it was his seed he rose them up again
[34:44] see that through the life that's going
[34:47] over the original seat like was given
[34:50] Eve over his real Church is bringing
[34:52] forth life again oh my god a man that
[34:56] life that was over the real seat is
[34:57] bringing forth life again a man through
[35:00] the birth through the womb of his bride
[35:02] Oh hallelujah so life is coming through
[35:06] the womb of his bride see oh
[35:09] it's rich and glorious I give it a
[35:11] little time to study so it'll sink in he
[35:15] is that seed he is that seed that was
[35:18] produced by the Word of God be it unto
[35:20] me according to thy word there's a seed
[35:23] see you taking the word see so now now
[35:26] I'll get a little deeper into this in a
[35:29] second but you know as we see here for
[35:31] the Branham say life is coming through
[35:32] the womb of the bride life is coming a
[35:36] man through the womb of the bride and as
[35:38] we were saying on Sunday a man an order
[35:42] for Mary to produce Christ hallelujah
[35:46] amen Mary herself had to surrender a man
[35:52] through the womb of her spirit which is
[35:55] her mind that was the first thing God is
[35:58] actually every promise that he has made
[36:00] to you what he's trying to do is get
[36:02] through the womb of your spirit first
[36:04] before that thing can be manifested in
[36:07] your life you have to overcome every
[36:10] mind that you have to cast down what you
[36:15] feel Amen you're gonna cast out what you
[36:18] think anything that goes against the
[36:21] Word of God
[36:21] you gotta cast it down
[36:24] hallelujah and what God is trying to do
[36:26] is work through the womb of your I mean
[36:29] trying to get this word first into the
[36:30] womb of your spirit and once it rest
[36:32] there then everything else gonna work
[36:34] out
[36:34] Oh hallelujah let me go on a little
[36:36] further here this isn't a paragraph
[36:39] 176th of the saint no I'm sorry this is
[36:41] actually paragraph 176 of spoken word is
[36:46] original seat part to a man part 2 this
[36:50] is paragraph 176 a man let me see if
[36:54] there's actually okay I think what what
[36:58] brother Branham did he preached two
[36:59] sermons for about three hours each and
[37:01] and I think it's just a continuation so
[37:04] look at paragraph 176 in and I think
[37:06] that should be fine since now we're
[37:08] gonna hit something real rich full of
[37:10] vitamist from Genesis to Revelation oh
[37:14] my god it says notice and she and her
[37:18] daughter she and her daughters has a
[37:20] horse war now I I want you to try to try
[37:24] to catch this with the probably use some
[37:26] very plain language oh my it may use
[37:31] some very plain language and you know I
[37:34] mean and we had a prophet yo God sent us
[37:38] a prophet and you know there's some
[37:40] things that I want to just kind of say
[37:42] here because you know he's typing this
[37:45] because you know Christ is going to come
[37:47] through the womb of the church right the
[37:50] spiritual in the church that's how
[37:52] Christ will be reproduced again
[37:54] now now when we talk about that we're
[37:57] talking about the bright because when he
[37:59] started using terms like you know he
[38:01] said God would never bring Amen Christ
[38:05] through the womb of a and he's
[38:07] using that as a tight because Christ
[38:09] cannot come through denominational
[38:12] systems Oh hallelujah anybody expecting
[38:16] to find Christ in a denomination in the
[38:19] wrong place looking for hallelujah is
[38:22] the truth anyhow right I mean you can't
[38:27] compromise with denomination it meant
[38:30] the angel actually saying come out not
[38:34] go in right so if you go
[38:37] is something went wrong somewhere you
[38:39] have to hear the voice of the Lord
[38:41] calling you to come out hallelujah
[38:45] right because Christ cannot be produced
[38:47] in the womb of a hallelujah
[38:50] and we that's uh that's uh if you you
[38:53] know you won't script on that go to
[38:54] revelation 17 a man it talks about other
[38:57] the Catholic Church being the great
[39:00] a man that's what the Bible calls
[39:02] her but she had children a man and out
[39:05] of out of those children they're called
[39:07] harlots
[39:08] but like mama a man like daughter
[39:12] glory to God that's why we got to be so
[39:15] careful a man can I tell you something
[39:19] Mama's if y'all don't hold us stand it
[39:22] up can I tell you how it is if the
[39:25] mama's dumb ahold standing up the
[39:27] daughters gonna get worse and worse and
[39:29] worse
[39:30] amen if mama wear her skirt to her knees
[39:34] the daughter gonna wear it to her thighs
[39:37] praise the Lord anyhow right that's my
[39:40] mama gonna have to put it but make it
[39:42] longer if my aware ain't man 3-inch
[39:46] heels daughter gonna go to five inches
[39:49] praise the Lord somebody a man so like
[39:53] mama like daughter that I read the
[39:56] quotes you know what brother man see
[39:57] your grandma me was a flapper right your
[40:01] mama wasn't this and he just yeah chorus
[40:04] girl in a flapper we don't want that
[40:06] spirit do you realize that amen I was
[40:10] just listening to take the day and I'm
[40:12] gonna take if y'all listen to the
[40:13] Prophet when he get to like 63 64 65 he
[40:16] makes some things pretty plain
[40:18] hallelujah imma let me put a couple
[40:21] things out here to you even if you
[40:23] listening to the Prophet you really not
[40:26] getting it unless you get on the
[40:29] ministry you're not catching it amen you
[40:35] can be listening not really hearing what
[40:37] he's saying you know we want to know how
[40:40] many people listen to the Prophet in the
[40:43] house daily but still go to
[40:46] denominational Church evidently you did
[40:49] not
[40:50] here what the prophets tail that's why
[40:54] he has ministry amen to catch what he's
[40:57] saying and speak it back to the people
[41:02] it's important though I got order I got
[41:08] guy got away he do things and he I mean
[41:12] my god you remember when the King
[41:16] Hezekiah he was told that uh he was
[41:20] going to die Hezekiah prayed and when he
[41:23] turned his face of all afraid God heard
[41:26] the prayer but the way God brought the
[41:28] answer was not to give it to Hezekiah
[41:31] directly God had to bring it back
[41:34] through a prophet God has an all in the
[41:38] way - he does things so he says the
[41:41] Prophet then he raises up pastors and
[41:43] evangelists and teachers and they go
[41:46] back to what the Prophet said and they
[41:47] bring that to the people and it helps
[41:50] keep the church in line helps keep the
[41:53] church clean hallelujah somebody you
[42:00] know the Prophet made it coming to say
[42:02] he say now he say sister you say where
[42:05] God anoint you a man to wear something
[42:09] so sexy that it would cause his own son
[42:13] to lust after you you say what God do
[42:17] that you say no it's not God it is to
[42:20] devil so see if mama we're just a little
[42:23] too tight
[42:24] watch whether we're going back to you
[42:26] know you remember we I thought we had
[42:28] overcome the skin-tight weenie stuff you
[42:32] remember other brother making them
[42:33] comments you know who like a skin-tight
[42:35] weenie right I mean so so we we should
[42:39] be well past that now but if mama let
[42:42] down the standards hallelujah mama let
[42:45] down understand us watch what happened
[42:46] with the daughters Oh glory to God
[42:50] a man so so here you know we're just
[42:52] kind of picking up on these things here

[42:57] boom right this is what the prophecy she
[43:01] and her daughters has a
[43:03] horse boom I'm in paragraph 176 of

[49:59] to gain by lying on you
[50:15] if you want to join that organization if
[50:19] you want to join it is that you know
[50:21] that's the first thing folk do where
[50:23] they get upset and interdenominational
[50:25] Church they go I mean straight to the
[50:30] denominational Church they go now I can
[50:33] i'ma just I have to say these things
[50:34] Lord and Lord about if I'm wrong God
[50:37] please forgive me you know my heart God
[50:40] but at some time I just gotta tell the
[50:41] truth God you're not hurting me when you
[50:46] run to a denominational Church you
[50:49] hurtin yourself if you want to join the
[50:54] organization and think you're all right
[50:56] you see where you landed your landed
[51:00] right in the midst of death just exactly
[51:04] if you can't see that now if you can't
[51:06] see that now you're spiritually the line
[51:10] now you know i'ma just you know we've
[51:13] been we've been working through the
[51:14] church ages even in Sunday school and
[51:18] there was a quote that we just ran into
[51:22] last week and I can't even get to my
[51:24] subject here I'm trying I really am
[51:26] trying but but we ran into this boat on
[51:29] last weekend and it talked about
[51:31] Polycarp and how a Polycarp you know
[51:34] when he heard that the first church had
[51:37] went into pagan worship right that the
[51:41] church was was set up by you know some
[51:44] Jews the drew Lucas anjuna cos something
[51:47] like that a dronicus anjuna cos they
[51:50] were they left Israel they went to set
[51:52] up the church in Rome and man they had a
[51:53] flourishing Church but because the the
[51:56] Jews start arguing amongst themselves
[51:58] the people in Rome say y'all got to get
[52:01] out of here y'all calls him too much
[52:02] trouble right the Jews argot amongst
[52:04] themselves so so a dronicus in and junik
[52:08] estate they had to leave and they had to
[52:10] leave the church and the status that it
[52:12] was in for you know a number of years
[52:13] and but but by the time that came back
[52:16] the church they started had three you
[52:20] reunite it was some of the pagan
[52:21] traditions and that it was mixing
[52:23] Christianity and paganism together and
[52:26] and here they are trying to have church
[52:28] like that and when when when Elena's
[52:29] came back and they saw the pagan worship
[52:32] in the Christian and all mixed together
[52:34] they say oh my goodness this is you know
[52:36] that's not what we left so they couldn't
[52:38] get the people straighten out so they
[52:40] had to start another Church
[52:41] he said now Polycarp when he heard
[52:43] certain things was going on he well he
[52:45] went on a 1500 mile journey to try to
[52:49] turn the people back to God hallelujah
[52:52] but when he got there and saw the way
[52:55] the people's worshipping and doing
[52:56] things he was doing his best to try to
[52:58] get them to turn back to God but but
[53:00] what here's the thing he realized that
[53:02] he could not do it he tried but he
[53:05] realized he could not do it and a
[53:07] scripture came to his came to spirit he
[53:09] says Ephraim is married to her idols let
[53:14] him alone
[53:17] that's serious that's what God did in
[53:20] the Bible right eat from Mary to idols
[53:24] leave them alone that don't you ever
[53:27] cross the line where God has to leave
[53:31] you alone and you'll never know when
[53:36] you've reached it so I'm gonna tell you
[53:41] something you ought to be grateful that
[53:42] God would speak to you and try to get
[53:46] you come on come on come on come on you
[53:48] know cuz see there's there's different
[53:50] seeds being sown God trying to sow his
[53:52] seed the devil always trying to sow his
[53:54] seed so what you're gonna open up to the
[53:56] womb of your spirit what you're gonna
[53:58] open it up to amen praise the Lord
[54:02] hallelujah I know it's winter but some
[54:04] of us need to do some spring cleaning in
[54:07] our closets in our clothes we need to go

[54:17] little further all right now let's go
[54:21] back now and pick up again and come down
[54:24] for something do you remember what last
[54:25] Sunday service was the gate to the soul
[54:28] you remember now there is a womb of the
[54:30] physical there's a womb for the spirit
[54:34] do you believe that there is a spiritual
[54:36] womb and a physical womb and the mind is
[54:39] the womb to
[54:40] spirit why I remember I told you last
[54:43] something drawed it out here for you
[54:45] these five senses that enters this seat
[54:48] from the outside see taste feel smell
[54:50] hear five on the inside conscience and
[54:53] so forth from the inside five now on a
[54:55] life site there's only one that's your
[54:58] your on the basis of free moral agency
[55:00] to accept take it in or let it out see
[55:04] now as I just kind of think about that
[55:07] that wound because there's multiple
[55:09] definitions we know we noticed it the
[55:11] uterus of the human female and certain
[55:14] higher mammals but there's also another
[55:16] definition says the place of which
[55:18] anything is formed uh produced a man the
[55:21] womb is where things it's the place
[55:23] where things are formed and produce in
[55:25] the womb of the Spirit you know before
[55:28] Eve a man failed to the serpent she
[55:33] accepted something in her in the spirit
[55:36] oh my god before our lady falls into
[55:40] adultery before a man falls into
[55:43] adultery they have to actually battle
[55:45] something in the spirit realm oh my god
[55:48] and what's going on is that these
[55:50] thoughts start coming to you a man I can
[55:54] go out of a marriage bound I can do this

[56:12] down into the womb of your spirit and it
[56:14] does took root and before the
[56:17] manifestation takes place you had to go
[56:19] through something in your mind if that
[56:22] happens on the negative side it's the
[56:26] same thing spiritually you have to
[56:28] receive this word into your spirit a man
[56:31] before it actually manifests on the
[56:33] outside hallelujah glory to God you can
[56:37] overcome Devils it meant by taking this
[56:40] word and applied it I mean every mind
[56:42] added it come bring that thing back in

[56:53] because the prop
[56:54] says he goes only says that's how
[56:56] adultery just a minute that's how
[56:59] adultery is committed spiritually when
[57:01] you knowing better by the Word of God
[57:03] look at this look at this look at these
[57:06] words when you know I'm bad about a word
[57:08] of God by the intercourse of the mind
[57:11] and that's a hard by the intercourse of
[57:21] the mind take in a lie of the devil the
[57:26] act takes place in your mind you think

[57:35] use in the mirror just spinning and take
[57:37] it say that uh in your mind in

[57:50] got a full that a word that end with a
[57:52] wide you can either be holy or you can

[57:59] in the mind
[58:00] all right now somebody alright Amen
[58:04] sisters I'm gonna tell you something
[58:06] that ain't none of y'all have to do
[58:08] nothing nothing extra they get no young
[58:11] man's attention if you got to do that to
[58:14] give them imagine what you gonna have to
[58:17] do to keep
[58:21] and let me tell you something making me
[58:25] talk playing here tonight see you you
[58:29] know when you went went you went glory
[58:34] the Lord blessed and you have children
[58:37] your dynamics change it changes praise
[58:43] the Lord
[58:44] I'm just be honest with you thanks
[58:46] changed things that you used to be able
[58:48] to get rid of you can't get rid get rid
[58:50] of them all and every tape that man
[58:52] didn't love you before you had that
[58:53] child and he was only only with you
[58:55] because of your figure he'll be gone
[58:58] after the child is born you better make
[59:02] sure he love more than your body all
[59:06] right praise the Lord
[59:07] a man is to enter course of the mind no
[59:13] I'm bad about a word of God by the end
[59:14] of course of mine taking a lot of devil
[59:16] against the Word of God that's exactly
[59:17] what he done with a spiritual
[59:20] intercourse first that come you know and
[59:24] what brother branham preach the sermon
[59:25] if y'all go back and listen to the tape
[59:26] he said something like this he say he
[59:28] said I was I was alone I didn't know how
[59:31] to really write these things out I don't
[59:33] have an education so I don't know how to
[59:34] really present this he said but I had
[59:37] certain things written down the Holy
[59:38] Ghost had to tell me don't say that
[59:41] that's too much the Holy Ghost had to
[59:46] tell him don't say that that's too much
[59:47] so so when I'm reading the Holy Ghost
[59:49] actually approved exactly what you've
[59:57] done with the spiritual of course first
[59:58] that come by believing Satan's lying to
[1:00:00] the woman for mine that polluted us soul
[1:00:03] set death in the soul then the GNAT
[1:00:05] track takes place and that's the only
[1:00:06] way that a woman can a woman ever can't
[1:00:09] commit adultery against her husband is
[1:00:10] to first let some man talk her into it
[1:00:13] and then receive another man's that's
[1:00:16] not her husband then she's committed
[1:00:19] adultery now that's the same thing it
[1:00:23] happens with spiritual don't you right
[1:00:26] so you you you know you just don't count
[1:00:28] it up and just you know be going
[1:00:31] are you talking to somebody Oh y'all and
[1:00:34] y'all they gonna talk to me you've been
[1:00:36] talking to somebody
[1:00:37] your actions show it you know what when
[1:00:43] I win it when a husband and wife
[1:00:44] together they can kind of pick up when
[1:00:48] it's something wrong in this
[1:00:48] relationship so the story is a lining up
[1:00:56] and I thought you see who's gonna do it
[1:00:58] in soon you wait hold on and then you
[1:01:02] you gotta tell a lie and do you got to
[1:01:05] tell love a lot of cover that lie a man
[1:01:07] right and so you you know here here all
[1:01:10] this stuff you you're going through and
[1:01:12] the same thing happen spiritually you
[1:01:14] know the folk before a person just kind
[1:01:16] of come to the point but I'm going back
[1:01:18] to the nomination then entertain some
[1:01:20] stuff it's the same thing that Eve did
[1:01:24] right and and see when we talk about
[1:01:27] these two wounds
[1:01:28] the reason I've titled it be it be done
[1:01:30] to me according to that work because
[1:01:31] Mary did the opposite of what Eve Dean
[1:01:34] Eve actually thought that she could help
[1:01:36] the process out right II thought she was
[1:01:40] doing something to help God out now
[1:01:43] brother branham said a couple things you
[1:01:45] know being that the body was already
[1:01:49] full with with with with the organs to
[1:01:52] reproduce a man a reproductive system
[1:01:55] was there had they come to it on their
[1:01:58] own God would have blessed it that is
[1:02:00] one way it could have happened how Adam
[1:02:02] and Eve come to that on the oh god of
[1:02:05] less that's why the Bible say marriage
[1:02:06] is honorable right you say had they come
[1:02:09] to it on the own God with a blessing but
[1:02:11] another way that children could have
[1:02:13] been produced is the same way Jesus was
[1:02:15] produced through the spoken word
[1:02:19] hallelujah and the way did that happen
[1:02:22] oh my I'm taller impossible if there was
[1:02:25] anything that should have been
[1:02:26] impossible it's impossible for a virgin
[1:02:29] to have a baby
[1:02:30] ain't no way
[1:02:31] a virgin conceived and bare child ain't
[1:02:35] no way we know how children are born
[1:02:38] right but here you know their mayor
[1:02:41] rather than a man sit there being the
[1:02:43] reason now with the ain't she exquisite
[1:02:45] how can things be said he'd say the Holy
[1:02:48] Spirit got overshadowed II you know and
[1:02:50] and that's what's gonna call the child
[1:02:52] to come forth and they're not even I
[1:02:54] mean the Holy Spirit has not even come
[1:02:56] yet that was new language to her oh my
[1:03:00] god it was brand-new link what you
[1:03:02] talked about but she had never heard the
[1:03:04] preacher say anything like that but he
[1:03:06] said the Holy Spirit got overshadow you
[1:03:08] that's how you can have a child and what
[1:03:10] mary did it's the same thing God wants
[1:03:13] all of us to do is just settle that
[1:03:15] thing was gotta smoke it be it unto me
[1:03:19] Alleluia not according to my thoughts
[1:03:22] because my thoughts are gets what you
[1:03:24] just said and then being up to me not
[1:03:27] according to my feelings not according
[1:03:30] to my emotions but being unto me
[1:03:33] according to the word that you just
[1:03:35] spoke over me angel departed no
[1:03:43] wrestling with Mary no no fighting with
[1:03:47] Mary but the angel knew that she had
[1:03:50] received her womb was open to the world
[1:03:54] and all and she couldn't explain it and
[1:03:57] like I said you know as soon as she got
[1:03:59] it let's let's let's just go in and then
[1:04:01] maybe uh you know I've saved that I'll
[1:04:05] see that but soon she got it she went to
[1:04:07] tell Elizabeth she went to tell
[1:04:09] Elizabeth and and and i'ma tell you when
[1:04:11] you get it you'll testify about it - Oh
[1:04:13] glory to God
[1:04:15] can I just uh I have some other things
[1:04:19] lined up here but I'm not going to keep
[1:04:20] y'all here all night
[1:04:22] I won't do that I might have to come
[1:04:26] back Abe man and hit it again from at a
[1:04:29] different time but God knows what he
[1:04:31] won't see it God know what he won't see
[1:04:35] it alright let me uh let me
[1:04:45] paragraph
[1:04:50] paragraph 139
[1:04:54] in that same
[1:04:57] same message paragraph 130
[1:05:05] where they fail where Adam and Eve fell
[1:05:08] was where doc told him to multiply
[1:05:11] replenish the earth it fell and the way
[1:05:14] that they made that happen Eve when she
[1:05:18] fell to what Satan that represent a tour
[1:05:21] took it to Adam and that's where they
[1:05:23] both just state they failed there and
[1:05:25] day the replenishing could have happened
[1:05:27] multiple ways like I said it could have
[1:05:28] happened through those you know through
[1:05:31] the organs that they already have or it
[1:05:32] could have happened through the spoken
[1:05:34] word
[1:05:34] either way God would have blessed it
[1:05:36] right and but here you know it would
[1:05:38] pick up this in paragraph 139 says the
[1:05:41] true Bharath like Mary will have a
[1:05:43] virgin moon for the bride of the word
[1:05:46] which is Christ when Christ the word
[1:05:48] comes to the bride should be the same as
[1:05:50] he is a virgin by the word amen Oh God
[1:05:54] he says I hope I hope this I hope it's
[1:05:56] going over brother Neville see I hope
[1:05:59] you understand what was he were the Word
[1:06:02] of God upon his vesture he had a name
[1:06:04] written the Word of God in the beginning
[1:06:07] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:06:09] in the Word was God the Word was made
[1:06:10] flesh and dwelt among us He is God God
[1:06:13] is the word paragraph 141 says and when
[1:06:15] his bride comes she'll be the same
[1:06:18] product that he is a virgin did Christ
[1:06:22] belong to the denomination Hey look at
[1:06:25] that
[1:06:25] he'd say so that he talked about the
[1:06:26] bride all right cuz the bride has to
[1:06:28] have a virgin womb just like Mary had a
[1:06:30] virgin boom
[1:06:31] okay and when his bride comes she'll be
[1:06:34] the same product that he is virgin did
[1:06:36] Christ come to the denomination then
[1:06:38] Jehovah neither does his bride she is a
[1:06:42] part of him she needs no dogma she won't
[1:06:45] have any she'll be absolutely virgin how
[1:06:49] Bob a word a man she'll punctuate every
[1:06:52] word God says with an amen amen
[1:06:55] Oh be it unto me according to thy word
[1:06:57] Eman oh my there you are punctuate God's
[1:07:00] Word have a virgin womb what will she
[1:07:04] come out of a virgin womb the word what
[1:07:06] did Jesus come out of a virgin moon see
[1:07:09] now you know and so I'm gonna leave that
[1:07:12] there cuz he goes on to talk about how
[1:07:14] Adam came
[1:07:16] his wife amen before he got to know her
[1:07:18] she was already pregnant and saying she
[1:07:21] was pregnant with death but when Joseph
[1:07:23] came to his wife she was already
[1:07:25] pregnant with life hey man thank God for
[1:07:28] that
[1:07:28] all right let me uh let me just kind of
[1:07:30] wind up here tonight Oh glory I'll bring
[1:07:34] it home with this quote out of pergamene
[1:07:37] church age Laura to God hallelujah glory
[1:07:46] glory glory glory pergamene church age
[1:07:50] this is the angel the Lord speaking to
[1:07:52] the Prophet taught him to pick up his
[1:07:53] pen and write and this is something that
[1:07:56] he said here he says notice the harmony
[1:07:58] of the father and the son Jesus never
[1:08:03] did anything until it was showed him by
[1:08:05] the father John 5:19 this harmony is now
[1:08:09] to exist between the groom and his bride
[1:08:11] he shows her his word of life she
[1:08:13] receives it she never doubts it
[1:08:15] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[1:08:17] death but if the seat be planted this is
[1:08:20] what I love
[1:08:21] if the seat be planted the water will
[1:08:24] raise it up again a man and we're
[1:08:27] expecting rain a man because this is the
[1:08:30] season for both the former and the
[1:08:32] latter rain and if the seat be planted
[1:08:34] the water will raise it up again here is
[1:08:38] the secret of this the word is in the
[1:08:42] bride as it was in Mary the bride has
[1:08:47] the mind of Christ but she knows what he
[1:08:49] wants done with the word she performs
[1:08:52] the command of the word in his name for
[1:08:55] she has thus saith the Lord I like this
[1:09:01] I'm coming back to that one on Sunday
[1:09:03] morning I'm just I'm coming back she has
[1:09:06] the staff the Lord then the word is
[1:09:09] quickened by the Spirit and it comes to
[1:09:12] pass like a seed that is planted and
[1:09:15] water it comes to full harvest serving
[1:09:18] its purpose those in the bride do only
[1:09:22] his will no one can make them do
[1:09:24] otherwise they had thus saith the Lord
[1:09:27] or they keep still they know
[1:09:29] that it has to be God in them doing the
[1:09:31] works fulfilling his own word he did not
[1:09:33] complete all this work while in this
[1:09:34] earthly ministry so now he works in and
[1:09:37] through the bride
[1:09:39] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:09:41] for him to do certain things that he
[1:09:43] must now do but he will now fulfill
[1:09:45] through the bride the work which he left
[1:09:48] for this specific time and the only way
[1:09:52] he's got to be able to do that through
[1:09:53] the Pradas that she has to maintain a
[1:09:55] virgin womb a virgin womb
[1:10:00] and I would just have to be plain not a
[1:10:02] woman but it must be a virgin
[1:10:05] woman house how's it gonna be virgin its
[1:10:08] virgin to the words it's virgin to the
[1:10:11] words amen hey where God speak we say
[1:10:14] Amen and I'm gonna tell you something
[1:10:17] you Kate yeah it'll be hard to keep a
[1:10:20] virgin womb when you compromise when you
[1:10:26] compromise you compensate the devil can
[1:10:31] I tell you just don't compromise Church
[1:10:33] don't do that we got to have a standard
[1:10:35] for you don't measure up to this this
[1:10:38] bride is different we're not like
[1:10:40] denominations we're not trying to be
[1:10:41] like denominations and and and one of
[1:10:44] the biggest things for me is just to get
[1:10:46] people to see that you know that you're
[1:10:48] that that's that's you Christ not coming
[1:10:51] out of denomination he's not a man
[1:10:54] you're not gonna find him there so
[1:10:56] anybody trying to tell me that I'm sorry
[1:10:59] amen this our conversation will be short
[1:11:02] glory to God
[1:11:03] our conversation gonna be very short
[1:11:05] because I know what I had a denomination
[1:11:09] did not produce this they couldn't even
[1:11:11] talk things like this they couldn't talk
[1:11:14] about they couldn't even say anything
[1:11:14] like this I mean they like like brother
[1:11:17] Ram said you know and your denomination
[1:11:19] did you ever hear the seven seals seven
[1:11:21] thunders you ever heard that go ax just
[1:11:26] find you the best church you can ask the
[1:11:29] pastor to preach it could you open up
[1:11:31] talk about these seals and these
[1:11:33] thunders for me excellent
[1:11:35] and you might say what I don't mean uh I
[1:11:37] think everything in the buckle meant
[1:11:39] something everything and they
[1:11:41] and even touch it can't even touch it at
[1:11:43] all right so we got to thank God that
[1:11:46] he's giving us an open book that we can
[1:11:48] you know we can live but but keep the
[1:11:51] womb virgin hallelujah
[1:11:54] don't entertain this demo Amen church
[1:11:58] don't entertain this devil in no way
[1:12:01] hallelujah cause he's trying to defile
[1:12:03] what God has you know please before us
[1:12:05] amen let's pray father we are just
[1:12:10] grateful for just this little thought
[1:12:13] that you've given us here tonight and
[1:12:14] Lord as well I know it's important that
[1:12:18] we maintain this virgin womb
[1:12:24] Eve failed to do it Eve at it a little
[1:12:29] bit of this and a little bit of that and
[1:12:31] it brought death to the human race but
[1:12:37] but Mary when she had nothing to look at
[1:12:41] nobody as an example all she had was a
[1:12:46] promise from your word and she took that
[1:12:49] promise and she said be it unto me
[1:12:51] according to thy word wasn't fully
[1:12:56] understood couldn't really be explained
[1:12:59] this was all new to her new language
[1:13:02] everything was so new oh god she was
[1:13:08] ready to receive it and in doing so she
[1:13:13] brought forth
[1:13:18] the King of Kings the Lord of lords just
[1:13:22] as death came to the human race through
[1:13:26] life also came through a woman so father
[1:13:30] were grateful for that and as we just
[1:13:32] take time to even reflect on that
[1:13:34] throughout this Christmas season lord
[1:13:38] help us to remain pure don't let us
[1:13:40] compromise with the enemy in this our
[1:13:42] Lord he has so much that he's trying to
[1:13:45] do so many tricks he tricked Eve God we
[1:13:48] don't want to be tricked in this hour
[1:13:49] with pray that you'd open up by our eyes
[1:13:51] our spiritual eyes that we might see let
[1:13:57] the word settle in the womb of our
[1:13:58] spirit that it might produce Christ
[1:14:03] again some Jesus name that we pray amen
[1:14:09] amen
[1:14:11] praise the Lord glory to God
[1:14:18] she's singing a song of worship a man as
