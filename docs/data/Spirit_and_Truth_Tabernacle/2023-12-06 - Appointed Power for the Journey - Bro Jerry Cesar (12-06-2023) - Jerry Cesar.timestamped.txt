[3:20] to be here tonight with you guys um I
[3:23] know that our pastor uh had to attend uh
[3:26] his duties uh so he he asked me if I
[3:29] could step in so I'm just a spare tire
[3:31] tonight uh but spare tires do you good
[3:34] they get you to your journey they get
[3:36] you to your
[3:38] destination so I pray you guys will will
[3:40] be in prayer for me as we read the
[3:43] scripture uh we want to turn tonight to
[3:46] the book of uh Genesis uh and we'll read
[3:49] there in the 22nd chapter and just the
[3:52] first two
[3:54] verses and just say Amen when you're
[3:58] there you know I I've really been
[4:00] enjoying the ministering of the word uh
[4:02] by all the different Brethren I trust
[4:04] it's been a blessing to you as well I
[4:07] just really really enjoy what the Lord
[4:09] has been doing in our
[4:11] midst all right it reads and it came to
[4:15] pass after these things that God did
[4:18] tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham
[4:22] he and he said behold behold here I am
[4:25] and he said take now thy son thine only
[4:27] son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee
[4:30] into the land of Moriah and offer him
[4:33] there for a burnt
[4:35] offering upon one of the mountains which
[4:38] I will tell thee of Praise the Lord you
[4:41] may all have your
[4:43] seats may God add a blessing to his
[4:47] reading
[4:48] now tonight if I could use as a subject
[4:52] I want to use appointed power for the
[4:56] journey again that's appointed power for
[4:58] the journey I believe the last time I
[5:01] was here we went through the thought
[5:03] that there uh that there's no point of
[5:05] uh the point of no return and uh just
[5:08] kind of felt like the Lord added a
[5:10] little bit of inspiration after that uh
[5:13] just to continue uh so we want to
[5:16] recognize tonight that as there is a
[5:17] point of no return uh God did have an
[5:21] appointed power that he uh applied in
[5:24] your life that would be sufficient for
[5:26] you to get to your destination so as a
[5:28] theme we want to just focus on starting
[5:30] with Abraham strength and
[5:32] weaknesses now as we walk through the
[5:35] life of Abraham we can see that he had a
[5:38] lot of weak points in his life we can
[5:41] see that through Abraham uh of course
[5:44] our F Foundation we can see that is
[5:46] faith yet this was the same Prophet that
[5:49] God called and when he God called him uh
[5:52] he did laugh along with his wife Sarah
[5:56] he also lied about Sarah being his wife
[5:59] right uh to the king uh but Abraham had
[6:02] a testimony and his testimony Paul re uh
[6:06] Paul picks this up in Rook Romans chap
[6:08] 4: 19 he says that Abraham was not weak
[6:12] in faith he said that he considered not
[6:16] his own body now dead when he was about
[6:19] 100 years old neither yet the deadness
[6:22] of Sarah's womb it goes on to say in
[6:24] verse 20 he staggered not at the promise
[6:27] of God through unbelief but was strong
[6:29] in faith giving God the glory now I like
[6:33] this testimony about Abraham because it
[6:35] assures us that God recognizes one thing
[6:38] he recognizes What You Do by
[6:41] faith and as you along this journey
[6:44] there's an appointed power to you but
[6:46] you can use only use that power by faith
[6:49] you see now as you are at point of no
[6:53] return one of the things that I just
[6:55] wanted to pick up on is that it means
[6:57] it's the time in which it becomes no
[6:59] longer possible for you to make a
[7:02] different decision or to return to an
[7:04] earlier place or state here in Genesis
[7:07] 22 we find that God called Abraham and
[7:11] try uh called him to do a test it was
[7:13] approving grounds for his prophet and
[7:16] Abraham was obedient unto that call and
[7:19] we find that when God when Abraham went
[7:21] unto the mountain to offer his son
[7:24] Isaac God stepped in and says Abraham I
[7:27] see that you truly love me you were
[7:30] willing to withdraw your only son and
[7:33] God had an appointed Ram in a bush that
[7:36] would stand as a sacrifice as a type of
[7:39] Christ today you see now the prophet
[7:43] says something here I just want to point
[7:44] out in the message questions and answers
[7:47] on
[7:48] Genesis he says I think that the people
[7:51] today that are possessed with this
[7:53] Spirit or the spirit a part of these
[7:55] Angelic beings Spirits which rotated off
[7:59] of God that never fell in the beginning
[8:01] and resisted the devil's lie in the in
[8:04] heaven now those that what the prophet
[8:06] is speaking of here is when the when the
[8:09] enemy deceive a third of the angels in
[8:12] heaven the prophet is saying you will
[8:14] there and he saying at that time you
[8:16] were Spirits rotating off of God and you
[8:19] had your choice made there you chose
[8:21] your side there you see so God had an
[8:25] appointed power to you on this journey
[8:27] that would bring you to your destination
[8:30] in Acts
[8:31] 1:6 we find it says talking to about the
[8:36] disciples it says when they were come
[8:39] together they asked of him saying Lord
[8:43] will thou at this time restore again the
[8:45] kingdom to Israel and he said unto them
[8:47] it is not for you to know the times or
[8:49] the seasons which the father hath put in
[8:51] his own power but ye shall receive power
[8:55] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[8:57] and you shall be Witnesses unto to me in
[8:59] both Jerusalem and all Judea and all
[9:02] Samaria unto the uttermost parts of the
[9:05] earth and I believe we heard on Sunday
[9:07] that you are the uttermost parts of the
[9:09] earth you see uh but God has appointed
[9:12] this power that it would be sufficient
[9:14] for your journey whatever you have need
[9:16] of God has already written in his word
[9:19] everything that you need to get you to
[9:21] where you need to be and Y believe that
[9:23] everyone does possess everything the the
[9:26] very power in them at this moment
[9:28] through the Holy Ghost to have whether
[9:31] it's healing whether it's Deliverance
[9:33] God has appointed that in your life now
[9:37] a lot of times when we think about power
[9:39] people can associate that with with
[9:42] riches or with popularity or influence
[9:45] you see but real power comes down
[9:48] knowing what you have and a lot of times
[9:51] people don't realize what they have
[9:53] therefore they don't know what it's used
[9:55] what it could be used for you see but I
[9:59] believe that through the scriptures we
[10:01] can find an example here in Luke 10:1
[10:05] 17 where God had a pretty large group of
[10:10] disciples and here we find that Christ
[10:14] in verse 17 he calls them and they he
[10:16] set them on commission to do a work for
[10:19] the Lord and it says in the 70 returned
[10:22] again saying Lord even the devils are
[10:25] subject unto us through thy name and he
[10:28] said unto them I beheld Satan as
[10:30] lightning fall from Heaven behold I give
[10:33] you power to thread upon serpents and
[10:36] scorpions and over all the power of the
[10:38] enemy and nothing shall by any means
[10:41] hurth you but verse 20 says not
[10:43] withstanding in this Rejoice not that
[10:45] the spirits are subject unto you but
[10:48] rather Rejoice because your names are
[10:50] written in heaven you see God's not
[10:53] wanting you or waiting for you to do a
[10:55] certain thing uh for you to realize who
[10:58] you are right you see there there was a
[11:00] distinction between Luke 10 where God
[11:03] had appointed these people with these
[11:05] disciples with power and what happened
[11:07] in the upper room you see God's power
[11:11] was purposed so that you could realize
[11:13] who you are in this hour who you are as
[11:16] a bride of Jesus Christ you see now on
[11:19] the upper room when they can recognize
[11:21] that and they were filled with the
[11:23] anointing of the Holy Spirit it was no
[11:25] longer a a a what they can do or a
[11:28] commission of what what they were going
[11:30] to do but it was a a matter of how they
[11:32] can express Christ to the people it was
[11:35] a matter of how they can give Christ to
[11:37] the people Christ will be sufficient for
[11:40] them now you don't have power until you
[11:43] have a genuine marriage with the Holy
[11:45] Ghost amen I'm going say that again you
[11:48] don't have power until you have a
[11:49] genuine marriage with the Holy Ghost a
[11:53] relationship with the
[11:54] word now we continue here it says says
[11:59] uh verse uh 23 in Luke chap 10 and he
[12:04] turned unto his disciples and said
[12:06] privately said blessed are are the eyes
[12:09] which see the things that you see for I
[12:11] tell you that many prophets and Kings
[12:13] have desired to see those things which
[12:15] you see and have not seen them and to
[12:17] hear those things which you hear and
[12:19] have not heard them you see this this
[12:22] time in scripture we find that the
[12:24] manifested word which was Christ was
[12:27] quickening the predestinated word you
[12:29] see because God I believe our our
[12:32] brother said this a few Sundays ago how
[12:34] God has a private Ministry and a public
[12:37] Ministry God was speaking something
[12:40] privately specifically to those that
[12:42] were of his those that had their names
[12:45] written in heaven and they had to
[12:47] recognize what the scripture said about
[12:49] them so that it could bring forth a
[12:51] manifestation of the word amen amen
[12:56] now we continue here
[12:59] and I just kind of want to take a little
[13:01] part of this scripture I know uh we've
[13:04] heard it pretty uh few times in the last
[13:07] in the last week or a few weeks or so
[13:09] but I figured we'd certainly take a part
[13:11] of it here tonight in Matthew chapter 4
[13:15] I would call this uh just as a little
[13:18] imagination Peter's pie right in Matthew
[13:22] 4 verse 18 and it says in Jesus walking
[13:26] by the Seas of Galilee saw two brethen
[13:29] Simon called Peter and Andrew his
[13:32] brother casting a net into the sea for
[13:35] they were Fishers and they said unto
[13:37] them follow me and I will make you
[13:39] fishes of men you see God had called out
[13:42] Peter and his Brethren he had a specific
[13:45] uh a a word for them that would Quicken
[13:47] their their that word that gerti seed at
[13:50] an appointed time you see but we find
[13:54] later in Peter's
[13:56] life uh Christ go uh Christ sends out a
[14:00] commission to them as they were on the
[14:02] boat and Jesus says in Matthew 14:22 he
[14:05] says and straight way Jesus constrained
[14:08] his disciples to get into a ship and to
[14:11] go before him onto the other side while
[14:14] he was sent while he sent the multitudes
[14:16] away verse 24 but the ship was now in
[14:20] the midst of the sea tossed with waves
[14:23] for the wind was contrary and I just
[14:26] kind of want to stay there for a moment
[14:27] because
[14:29] this point Peter was the only one in the
[14:31] ship that was that was going to make the
[14:34] decision to step out on faith to see
[14:37] what the word had in store for him and
[14:40] sometimes you have to step out on faith
[14:42] to see what the word has in store for
[14:44] you you see you have to be able to take
[14:47] God at his word for any condition any
[14:50] moment and as Peter walked out we know
[14:53] the scripture go Jesus Christ started to
[14:56] say uh Peter why did you doubt
[14:59] cuz he started to look at the conditions
[15:00] around him says Thou of little faith you
[15:04] see but the same Peter we find that he
[15:08] had to meet Christ on the other side on
[15:10] the other side of what in the other side
[15:12] of his conversion cuz by that time
[15:15] Christ told Peter when thou are
[15:17] converted strengthen your brothers you
[15:20] see and Peter has a lot of examples on
[15:25] how he became a strength to the people
[15:28] around him him now power is not always
[15:31] received or given but it is the
[15:33] revelation of who you are and and Peter
[15:36] got to a place where he received the
[15:39] revelation of who he was now what good
[15:43] is it to have power to move mountains
[15:45] but don't know why the mountain needs to
[15:47] be moved you see and and Peter could get
[15:51] to a place where now it was no longer
[15:53] about him but it was about what Christ
[15:56] can do through him you see
[15:59] sometimes it's one thing to have the
[16:01] word but it's one thing to know the
[16:03] purpose of the word for That
[16:05] season now it goes on to say uh just
[16:08] want to read the scripture
[16:10] here uh in 1 Peter chapter 1 there's a
[16:14] few scriptures that Peter points out
[16:17] that could be an encouragement to us
[16:18] tonight and as we turn to that Peter had
[16:22] a commission but he did not identify
[16:25] with that with his purpose prior to his
[16:28] Comm verion and I I I realized going
[16:31] through this that as you are
[16:33] commissioned by God you have to identify
[16:35] with the purpose of God in your life you
[16:38] see Samson had great power but it was
[16:41] useless until he recognized the purpose
[16:43] of God he had to get to a place where he
[16:47] actually became the very purpose of that
[16:50] moment you see and Samson because he
[16:53] accepted that purpose he accepted death
[16:56] which means whatever the price was was
[16:58] he was willing to pay it right the same
[17:01] thing goes with Daniel he purposed in
[17:02] his heart that he would not defile
[17:04] himself in the king's court right while
[17:07] remaining faithful and he accepted to go
[17:09] even unto death into the lion's den
[17:11] whatever the cost was he was willing to
[17:13] pay for
[17:15] it 1 Peter chapter 6 says wherein you
[17:19] are greatly you greatly Rejoice though
[17:22] now for a season if need be ye are in
[17:26] heaviness through manifolds temptation
[17:28] that the trial of your faith being much
[17:31] more precious than of gold that
[17:33] perisheth though it be tried with fire
[17:36] might be found unto praise and honor and
[17:39] glory of the appearing of Jesus Christ
[17:42] and I like this because something
[17:43] Prophet says here you're going to go
[17:45] through many tests and battles but the
[17:48] trial of your faith is necessary so it
[17:50] can bring about a Perfection a diamond
[17:53] before it can be displayed it has to be
[17:55] cut and the prophet says you are he he
[17:59] what you are there so the only way you
[18:02] can reflect what's up there is by faith
[18:04] you see I'm going say that again you are
[18:07] here what you are there which means you
[18:09] have to be able to reflect by faith
[18:12] what's on the other side and what's on
[18:14] the other side is your Celestial body is
[18:16] your theophany and the only way you can
[18:19] reflect that on this side of Eternity is
[18:21] by Faith by that six
[18:23] sense Peter goes on to say in 1 Peter
[18:26] chapter 2 ver9
[18:30] it says here but ye are chosen
[18:32] generation a royal priesthood and holy
[18:36] nation A peculiar people that you should
[18:38] show forth the Praises of him of him
[18:41] that called you out of Darkness Into His
[18:44] Marvelous Light which in time past were
[18:47] not a people but are now a people of God
[18:50] which had not obtained Mercy but now
[18:52] have obtained mercy and I like that
[18:55] because we have to recognize what we
[18:58] came from I'm a dreamer so a lot of
[19:01] times God would remind me of what my
[19:03] life would have been like without him
[19:05] I'd get dreams sometimes about my
[19:08] friends that I had before that I used to
[19:11] hang around with and where they are now
[19:13] you see and through that just God is
[19:15] showing me how great his Mercy was
[19:18] manifested in my life and sometimes it's
[19:20] a great to realize that because it
[19:22] shakes your attitude you go from Victory
[19:25] to Victory because you realize that's
[19:27] what you're leaving behind is Trails of
[19:29] Victory you see God did not choose you
[19:32] to lose you God did not choose you right
[19:35] to not sustain you so Peter shows us
[19:39] these things by telling us we are
[19:41] peculiar people a chosen
[19:45] Nation right now if we go on here we see
[19:50] uh just uh first Peter uh chapter
[19:53] 4:8 and it says and above all things it
[19:56] says have fervent charity among
[19:58] yourselves for charity shall cover the
[20:01] multitude of sins and I like that
[20:04] because the love that you have through
[20:06] what you're going through can bring
[20:08] correction to the situation as long as
[20:10] you express that love you can bring
[20:13] Grace you can bring Mercy to a situation
[20:16] by the love you share in the midst of it
[20:18] by the love you share to your neighbor I
[20:20] remember one time I was driving to work
[20:23] and I was cutting the corner to uh turn
[20:26] the light as it was Green and it was a a
[20:29] unique situation but as I turned I
[20:31] looked for a quick moment to the other
[20:33] side just to see if another vehicle was
[20:34] coming and as I turned the vehicle in
[20:37] front of me I had already anticipated
[20:40] that it would it would already go by the
[20:42] time I I pressed on the gas and I I went
[20:45] forward I go I went ahead and I bumped
[20:48] and collided into the other vehicle's uh
[20:49] uh rear end now as that happened I was
[20:53] very surprised but when that happened I
[20:57] I I I I started to immediately think and
[21:00] this was years ago years years years ago
[21:04] before or the early stages of my
[21:06] conversion and I was just for a quick
[21:08] moment a thought came to my mind oh you
[21:10] know you could flee the scene right uh
[21:12] all you have to do is cut around this
[21:13] vehicle you didn't hit her too hard or
[21:15] him you could flee the scene and no one
[21:17] will never know and I had to stop for a
[21:20] moment and says you know uh I don't
[21:22] believe that thought come is coming from
[21:24] the Lord so I decided to stop and I got
[21:27] out my car and I went and it was a
[21:29] elderly white woman and I spoke to her
[21:32] and I says ma'am I am so sorry that I
[21:35] have reared your car uh please forgive
[21:37] me uh and I started to speak to her in
[21:40] such a way and she got out the car and
[21:42] she looked at me and she walked me over
[21:45] to her car and my car she looked at both
[21:47] vehicles and then she says young man
[21:51] have a great
[21:52] day she did not call get anyone involved
[21:56] she didn't say anything in fact back I
[21:58] believe she even gave me a hug and she
[22:00] says thank you for your honesty and she
[22:03] walked away and she says have a great
[22:05] day and I remember that moment because I
[22:08] had such a love in her I wanted to see
[22:10] if she was okay I could have fled the
[22:12] scene but I wanted to see is the driver
[22:15] in that vehicle all right and sometimes
[22:18] the love that you express through a
[22:20] situation can bring correction can bring
[22:23] healing can bring deliverance and I
[22:26] learned that that in that moment it
[22:27] brought Deliverance to
[22:30] me as we continue here in 1 Peter
[22:36] 4:12 it says beloved think it not
[22:40] strange concerning the fiery trial which
[22:43] is triy was is here to try you as though
[22:46] some strange thing happened to you I
[22:48] thought it was a strange thing but it
[22:50] goes on to say but rejoice in so much ye
[22:53] are partakers of Christ sufferings and
[22:56] you know
[22:56] Church Christ learned obedience through
[22:59] the things that he suffered right so
[23:01] when you find yourself suffering be
[23:03] obedient because in the OB of your
[23:06] obedience you will reign with Christ in
[23:09] his glory it goes on to say that um in
[23:13] as much ye are partakers of Christ
[23:15] suffering that when his glory shall be
[23:17] revealed ye may also be glad with
[23:20] exceeding Joy if ye be reproached in the
[23:24] Name of Christ happy are ye for the
[23:27] spirit of glory and of God resteth upon
[23:30] you on their part he is evil spoken of
[23:33] but on your part he is
[23:35] glorified and you see when I read the
[23:38] scripture I couldn't help but think that
[23:40] if there's any time in our day uh or
[23:43] history where the name of Christ was was
[23:47] blasphemed uh nowadays you find the the
[23:50] very name Jesus Christ is often used as
[23:52] a curse word instead of a name to be
[23:55] worshiped or glorified right people are
[23:59] quick to say Jesus Christ in the midst
[24:02] of any situation and I just trust that
[24:04] as they say that name to recognize what
[24:06] power lies behind
[24:08] it you see now I just this thought just
[24:13] came to me but I remember a few years
[24:17] after I just shared that testimony about
[24:19] the accident I remember I was driving
[24:21] from work this time around and I
[24:24] remember it was pretty late at night uh
[24:26] maybe it was 4 or 5 o'clock in the
[24:28] morning and there was a a driver and I
[24:32] remember I was under the light it was
[24:33] red and this driver just bumped into me
[24:37] and I got out the car and I looked and I
[24:40] was I was very surprised but when I got
[24:41] out the car it was a it was a was driver
[24:43] that appeared to have been a bit of
[24:45] under the influence so I spoke with him
[24:48] and I said um you know it's not safe for
[24:51] you to be driving at this time of night
[24:52] especially you know seems like you've
[24:54] been drinking and he he he goes on to me
[24:57] he says oh man I'm really sorry and I
[24:59] looked at my car and there was no
[25:01] damages but I looked at his car and you
[25:04] can clearly tell the bumper was was Mex
[25:07] was missed was mixed up and you can see
[25:09] that it was in a misplace and all that
[25:11] kind of stuff but when I thought about
[25:13] it I talked to him and I said you know
[25:16] I'm not going to get anyone involved but
[25:19] have yourself a wonderful night get to a
[25:22] place where you can be safe and when I
[25:24] left the scenes I began thinking about
[25:26] that moment that I had some years ago
[25:28] and I learned that because that someone
[25:31] was able to extend Grace to me I was
[25:33] able to in turn extend that Grace to
[25:36] someone else sometimes you'll find
[25:38] yourself in a situation where you have
[25:41] to be the one to bring that love that
[25:44] someone else can use for
[25:47] themselves wow in First Peter chapter 5
[25:51] verse
[25:52] 8 it says here be
[25:55] sober be vigilant because your adversary
[25:58] the devil as a Waring lion walketh about
[26:01] seeking whom he may devour whom resist
[26:04] steadfast in the faith knowing that the
[26:06] same afflictions are accomplished in
[26:08] your brethren that are in the world but
[26:10] the God of all Grace who hath called you
[26:13] unto his eternal glory by Jesus Christ
[26:16] after ye have suffered a while make you
[26:19] perfect established strengthen and
[26:22] settle you you
[26:24] see after you have suffered a while make
[26:27] you perfect establish strengthen and
[26:31] settle you you see often times I realize
[26:34] that people want a drive-thru gospel a
[26:37] microwave gospel that produces a hotel
[26:41] experience constantly moving from place
[26:43] to place never settled people don't
[26:46] realize that the the way that comes is
[26:48] the way it goes and I believe our
[26:51] brother talked about it the other night
[26:53] that we ought to be laboring into that
[26:55] rest laboring into the presence of the
[26:58] Lord something that you never labored
[27:00] will never sustain you and it's
[27:03] important to recognize that as you go
[27:05] through your sufferings Christ is on the
[27:07] other side waiting you see Christ is on
[27:10] the finish line now as we continue
[27:14] here just want to point
[27:17] out in first John chapter
[27:20] 3 it says behold first chapter first
[27:25] verse there it says behold
[27:28] what manner of love the father had
[27:30] bestowed upon us that we should be
[27:32] called the sons of God therefore the
[27:34] world knoweth us not because it who it
[27:37] knew him not beloved now are you the
[27:40] sons of God and it does not yet appear
[27:43] what ye shall be but we know that when
[27:46] he shall appear we shall be like him for
[27:49] we shall see him as he
[27:51] is and I like the scripture here because
[27:55] I believe we are to manifest and reflect
[27:59] Christ every day in our lives and this
[28:02] scripture allows us to see that when he
[28:05] shall appear we shall be like him and we
[28:08] shall see him as he is and I was able to
[28:11] connect this scripture back to Isaiah 53
[28:14] where it says that there was no beauty
[28:17] that we would desire him when we shall
[28:20] see him and sometimes we can get caught
[28:23] up with too much of ourselves instead of
[28:25] realizing that God is not found in the
[28:29] beauty of the world but God is found in
[28:31] the beauty of the character of his word
[28:34] as we reflect the character of the word
[28:36] then we can recognize that we are people
[28:38] of
[28:40] God now God has appointed us power for
[28:44] the destination power for this journey
[28:48] now we find one that God provided power
[28:51] that would sustain him there was a power
[28:54] that flow through him and there was a
[28:56] power that was given to him in his life
[29:00] in First Kings chapter
[29:02] 17 we find the story of Elijah the
[29:05] tishbite now you guys are familiar with
[29:09] the story where God uses Elijah in a
[29:12] powerful way to shut the heavens that no
[29:15] water Would Rain upon the
[29:17] Earth and in this instant in Elijah's
[29:22] life go we'll go ahead and read it here
[29:24] in the first verse it says Elijah the
[29:26] tishbite who was the inhabitant of
[29:28] Gilead and said unto Ahab as the Lord
[29:31] God of Israel liveth before whom I stand
[29:34] there shall not be nor due nor rain
[29:37] these years but according to my word and
[29:40] the word of the Lord came unto him
[29:41] saying get thee hint and turn thee
[29:44] Eastward and hide thyself by the Brook
[29:46] Chariot that is before Jordan now Elijah
[29:49] had spoke these words that they would be
[29:51] no rain and as he
[29:54] fled and he went to the brook cherith
[29:57] God will use the Ravens to sustain him
[30:00] he had an appointed power in his in his
[30:02] way that God would provide bread and and
[30:06] and meat unto him you see in the
[30:09] junction of time the prophet goes to say
[30:11] this in paragraph
[30:14] 34 he says but then just before that God
[30:18] brought down to show down to show who he
[30:20] was there come a time that there was a
[30:23] prophet came in the land by the name of
[30:25] Elijah who was Anointed with the message
[30:28] of a God and he performed a miraculous
[30:31] and prove that omnipotence was still
[30:34] miraculous the prophet stood out there
[30:36] and closed the heavens that it rain in
[30:39] uh that it did not rain in the days of
[30:41] his ministry and he brought the Rains
[30:43] Down out of the heavens and give the
[30:45] Earth and Angels appeared on the scene
[30:48] Hallelujah baked him some cornbread that
[30:51] kept him 40 days alive while he was out
[30:54] there in the wilderness of God angels
[30:56] appeared in the end time all the
[30:58] prophets in the signpost point saying
[31:01] the day that angels will appear prophets
[31:04] will arise signs and wonders and if God
[31:08] did uh if if God did that for those
[31:10] little Junctions back there what will he
[31:13] do now when all Hells turn loose all
[31:16] heaven will turn loose Angels appearing
[31:19] signs and wonders on Earth the
[31:21] counterfeits arising God proving which
[31:23] is right and which is wrong and I would
[31:26] like to say that God God will meet you
[31:28] at your showdown at the point where you
[31:31] recognize that God has appointed power
[31:34] in front before you in the midst of what
[31:36] you're going through God will meet you
[31:38] at your Showdown you see God directed
[31:41] his servant Elijah later in his life
[31:45] that he would uh after uh um the the
[31:48] after the desert dried up right God
[31:51] would direct his servant to the
[31:53] shunamite woman that the shunamite woman
[31:55] would sustain him but what I find
[31:58] strange is that the shunamite woman did
[32:01] not have much to sustain him you see
[32:04] when he went to the shunamite woman she
[32:06] only had one morsel of bread that was
[32:09] all that she had just enough for her and
[32:12] her son you see but God that operates
[32:17] and manifests himself in what seems
[32:20] impossible manifested himself in this in
[32:23] this situation here that he would send
[32:25] his Prophet to this woman the shemite
[32:28] and we'll pick it up
[32:30] here and it says in verse 10 so he arose
[32:33] and went to zarap zerath and when he
[32:36] came to the gate of the city behold the
[32:38] wow woman was there Gathering of sticks
[32:41] and he called to her and said fetch me I
[32:43] pray thee a little water in a vessel
[32:45] that I may drink and as she was going to
[32:48] fetch it he called to her and says bring
[32:50] me I pray thee a morsel of bread in
[32:53] thine hand and she says as the Lord
[32:55] liveth I I have not a cake but a handful
[32:59] of meal in a barrel and a little oil in
[33:01] a cruise and behold I am Gathering two
[33:04] sticks that I may go and dress it for me
[33:06] and my son that we may eat it and die
[33:09] now later we find this shunamite woman
[33:12] she was willing to give up what she had
[33:14] for the purpose of God you see she when
[33:19] when when when the prophet asked her
[33:21] again she says I understand that but
[33:23] bake me a cake first you see this woman
[33:27] was able to surrender and Obey God's
[33:29] word in her day you see the prophet says
[33:32] seek ye first the kingdom of God and all
[33:35] of his righteousness and everything else
[33:37] will be added unto her because of her
[33:39] obedience because that she was not
[33:41] withdrawing what she had from God's
[33:44] servant right the prophet was on went on
[33:46] to say that uh her the barrel of meal
[33:49] wasted not neither did the cruise of oil
[33:51] fell according to the word of the Lord
[33:53] which spake by Elijah the prophet now
[33:57] as we continue
[34:00] here we can see here in 2 Kings chapter
[34:04] 6 where God had appointed power to his
[34:09] servant now here we find that the king
[34:14] of the armies of Syrian was fighting
[34:18] against the king of
[34:19] Israel and
[34:21] here God had appointed Elisha as the the
[34:25] as a prophet of that day that he would
[34:30] be the very point of power to his people
[34:34] you see when it came that the king the
[34:36] Kingdom of Israel was fighting against
[34:39] the kingdom of
[34:40] Syria they were troubled because they
[34:43] realized there was someone in the camp
[34:45] that knew what the very things that were
[34:47] happening in the midst you see and i'
[34:50] like to just encourage you tonight that
[34:52] you have access to the enemy's Camp so
[34:55] whatever it is that you need or whatever
[34:57] it is that you have uh have been taken
[35:01] from you God has given you access to the
[35:03] enemy's Camp you see you can't be afraid
[35:07] to go to the enemy's Camp to take what
[35:09] God has given you what God has given you
[35:12] is for you not for your enemy not for
[35:16] someone else it's for you now I
[35:18] encourage you tonight to claim
[35:21] it we find that Elisha's servant as he
[35:25] continued
[35:27] he recognized that the king of Syria
[35:31] Army was a lot greater than the king
[35:34] than than the king of Israel but Elisha
[35:37] prayed and says God opened the young
[35:39] man's eyes that he would see and as he
[35:43] prayed that the young man looked around
[35:45] him and realized that there was more
[35:48] with him than there was with the Enemy
[35:51] and sometimes it's it's important to
[35:53] open up your eyes to the word and
[35:55] realize there's more substance in the
[35:57] word than any resource you might have
[36:01] whatever it is that you find yourself
[36:03] going through open your eyes to the word
[36:05] and see that God has given you
[36:07] sufficient Grace for your
[36:11] day now in Isaiah chapter 40 verse 29 it
[36:15] says he giveth power to the faint and to
[36:19] them that have no might he increaseth
[36:22] strength now if there's anybody at the
[36:24] end of their strength tonight I
[36:25] encourage you that when you've come to
[36:27] the end of your strength God's strength
[36:30] can
[36:31] begin it goes on to say even the youth
[36:34] shall faint and be wary and the young
[36:36] men shall utterly fall but they that
[36:39] wait upon the Lord shall renew their
[36:41] strength they shall Mount up with wings
[36:43] as eagles they shall run and not be R
[36:47] they shall walk and not faint whatever
[36:50] you do Church wait on the
[36:53] Lord now in John chapter 19
[36:59] verse
[37:01] 10 we going to come to this place
[37:05] here and it says then said pilate unto
[37:09] him speaketh thou not unto me knowest
[37:14] that knowest thou not that I have power
[37:16] to crucify thee and have power to
[37:19] release
[37:20] thee in verse 14 we'll jump there Christ
[37:24] goes on to say I am the Good Shepherd
[37:26] and know my sheep and am known of mine
[37:30] and my father knoweth me even so know I
[37:32] the father and I lay down my life for
[37:35] the sheep and other sheep have I which
[37:38] are not of this fold them also I must
[37:41] bring and they shall hear my voice and
[37:44] there shall be one fold and one Shepherd
[37:47] therefore doth my father love me because
[37:49] I lay down my life that I may not I may
[37:52] take it again no man taketh it from me
[37:55] but I lay down my life of myself I have
[37:58] power to lay it down and I have power to
[38:00] take it again this commandment have I
[38:03] received of my father
[38:06] now as we read this I want to just point
[38:10] out that as
[38:11] Christ was being led to the
[38:15] cross it wasn't an easy task for him
[38:19] there was a lot of things that he had to
[38:21] overcome the most the greatest thing he
[38:23] had to overcome was himself he had to
[38:26] overcome himself in order to see that
[38:29] going to the Cross was something that
[38:31] was possible he had to yield his will to
[38:34] the will of God you see and as we find
[38:38] in Hebrews don't have this scripture I I
[38:40] thought I did but in Hebrews chapter 4 I
[38:44] believe it talks about that be as he was
[38:47] going to the Cross there was a joy that
[38:49] was set before him that he was able to
[38:52] endure the the the the the the
[38:55] sufferings of going to the cross
[38:57] and I want you to know that as he that
[38:59] Joy I believe the prophet says was you
[39:02] was was the bride was his bride he had
[39:04] you on his mind as he was going through
[39:07] the cross you see God Christ in this
[39:11] moment was the weakest point of his
[39:13] ministry weakest point of his life but
[39:16] he had something appointed in him that
[39:19] would give him strength to endure until
[39:21] he was able to finish the work you see
[39:24] you were his appointed power you were
[39:27] his appointed strength and now he was
[39:30] able to use that so that he could become
[39:33] your appointed power in your
[39:36] journey now I want to just read a
[39:39] testimony of the Prophet here where it
[39:42] talks about the shunamite woman in his
[39:45] day and we know that we've we've heard
[39:49] this many times but we find that the the
[39:52] God was was able to hearken unto her her
[39:55] prayer for her son that the prophet
[39:59] going onto his destination God would
[40:01] ground a plane that the prophet would
[40:05] come into contact with this shunamite
[40:07] woman in his day that she would receive
[40:10] power that would sustain her life in her
[40:13] son's life you see now as the prophet
[40:16] came to her the prophet recognized that
[40:19] he had been in King's courts palaces
[40:22] he's prayed in many different big areas
[40:25] but he says they was nothing like that
[40:28] little house there with the shunamite he
[40:31] knew that the the presence of the Lord
[40:33] was there because he recognized there
[40:36] was an atmosphere there was a prayer
[40:39] that was happening you see the shunamite
[40:41] woman there she was interceding for her
[40:45] son and because she had the right
[40:47] attitude because she had the right
[40:50] faithfulness and obedience recognizing
[40:54] that God had a man that was sent to her
[40:56] her her son could receive healing you
[40:59] see now I want to encourage you tonight
[41:01] saints that whatever the situation is if
[41:03] it is a way were child continue to pray
[41:06] for that way child continue to intercede
[41:08] for that way were child because what God
[41:11] has started God will finish you see
[41:15] there was another woman that followed
[41:16] the prophet from meeting to meeting that
[41:19] she would receive healing for her body
[41:21] right she got to a place and I have it
[41:24] here in the message expectations and she
[41:27] got to a place she says I cannot go any
[41:30] further and it was at that point that
[41:33] God manifested himself to her the
[41:35] prophet says and she says the strangest
[41:37] thing happened it said that uh she said
[41:40] this morning I dreamed a dream that I
[41:42] should be standing here in front of this
[41:44] cafeteria at 10 minutes after 9: that
[41:48] was uh that just happens constantly and
[41:50] it was at that specific time according
[41:54] to that dream that the prophet
[41:57] was standing right in front of her and
[41:59] she was troubled in her heart and asked
[42:02] Am I Dreaming she asked Are You The
[42:04] Prophet are you brother brandom brother
[42:06] brandom says yes I am and she received
[42:08] her healing right there you see she had
[42:11] an expectation but God had appointed a
[42:14] power that would sustain her in her
[42:16] journey and I encourage you tonight that
[42:18] God had appointed a power to you tonight
[42:21] for your journey Psalms chapter 1 verse
[42:24] one says blessed is the man that walketh
[42:27] not in the counsel of the ungodly nor
[42:29] standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth
[42:32] in the seat of the scornful where are
[42:35] you sitting tonight you're sitting in
[42:37] the presence of God says but his Delight
[42:40] is in the law of the Lord and his law
[42:42] doth he meditate day and night and he
[42:44] shall be like a tree planted by the
[42:47] rivers of water that bringeth forth his
[42:49] fruit in his season now I would like to
[42:53] tell you that every season is your
[42:55] season no matter what season it is could
[42:57] be the winter fall spring it could be a
