[50:54] praise God
[50:55] let's go to um verse
[50:58] 24 and then we going to go to Hebrews
[51:00] chapter 11 Mark 5 verse
[51:05] 24 and Jesus went with him and much
[51:08] people followed him and thronged him and
[51:10] a certain woman which had an issue of
[51:12] blood 12 years and had suffered many
[51:15] things of many Physicians and had spent
[51:19] all that she had and was nothing better
[51:23] but grew worse look at that went to the
[51:26] doctors she know she sought out all
[51:28] these people for help for 12 years and
[51:31] she didn't grow better she went she got
[51:33] worse and and verse 27 when she had
[51:36] heard of Jesus came in the press behind
[51:39] and touch his garments for she said if I
[51:42] may touch but his clothes I Shall Behold
[51:47] and straight way the Fountain of her
[51:48] blood was dried up and she went in her
[51:52] and she felt in her body that she was
[51:54] healed of the plague and Jesus
[51:57] immediately knowing in himself that
[51:59] virtue had gone out of him
[52:02] turned him about in the press and said
[52:05] who touch my clothes Hebrews chapter
[52:16] 11
[52:21] Hebrews chapter
[52:24] 11
[52:25] let's start at verse
[52:30] one the Bible says now Faith is the
[52:33] substance of things hope for the
[52:36] evidence of Things Not Seen for by the
[52:40] elders obtain a good report through
[52:42] faith we understand that the worlds were
[52:44] framed by the word of God so that things
[52:47] which are seen were not made of things
[52:49] which do appear by faith Abel offered
[52:52] unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
[52:55] can
[52:56] by which he offered witness what by
[52:59] which he obtained witness that he was
[53:02] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[53:05] and by it he being dead yet speaketh by
[53:09] faith Enoch was translated that he
[53:12] should not see death and was not found
[53:14] because God had translated him for
[53:17] before his translation he had a
[53:20] testimony that he pleased God but
[53:24] without faith it is impossible to please
[53:27] him for he that cometh to God must
[53:30] believe that he is and he is that he is
[53:34] a rewarder of them that diligently seek
[53:39] Him amen may the Lord a bless the
[53:41] reading of his word you can have your
[53:43] seats by the grace of
[53:48] God today uh by the help of the Lord I
[53:51] want to use for a subject I think some
[53:55] something that we all are familiar with
[53:58] and and um we all want to see more of a
[54:01] manifestation of and today my my title
[54:05] is sow faith and reap evidence sow faith
[54:09] and reap evidence now when you think of
[54:12] sewing you think of the law of also
[54:15] reaping you don't sow not to reap so if
[54:19] we ask the question today what are you
[54:21] sewing amen some people sow Discord
[54:26] some people so hate some people so lies
[54:29] some people so so envy and Mischief all
[54:33] these things are being sold and you're
[54:35] going to reap that thing that you put
[54:37] out in the
[54:39] atmosphere but you know I don't want to
[54:41] talk to you about that because I don't
[54:43] believe that you're Hypocrites today
[54:45] Hallelujah you know I believe that we're
[54:47] sewing good things Hallelujah when it
[54:49] comes to God hallelujah I believe that
[54:51] there's some people here today showing
[54:54] love Hallelujah I believe that there are
[54:56] some people in here hallelujah sowing
[54:58] virtue Hallelujah sowing meekness and
[55:01] patience and Temperance the things of
[55:03] God the character of God you know when
[55:05] you when you get a song and you begin to
[55:08] worship you know that you are sowing in
[55:10] the spirit Hallelujah you're putting
[55:12] that out there Hallelujah and you have
[55:14] to receive that back in which you give
[55:18] out into the atmosphere now I'm not one
[55:20] of these people who say well I don't
[55:22] believe in God but I just believe in a
[55:25] higher power no Hallelujah I believe
[55:29] what you sow unto God you will reap
[55:33] Hallelujah because my sewing is not into
[55:35] the
[55:36] universe butn of
[55:39] nonsense h i put it out in the universe
[55:42] no uhuh uhuh your faith has a
[55:45] destination yes sir and what you put out
[55:47] there has a destination it's going to
[55:50] fall in somebody's life Hallelujah and
[55:52] it's going to bring forth something
[55:54] Hallelujah and evidence Hallelujah and
[55:57] you know you reap what you sow and you
[55:59] know let's just talk about the law of
[56:01] reaping and sewing before we go any
[56:03] further Hallelujah now to make this very
[56:06] very simple when we think of sewing what
[56:08] do we think of a farmer amen and what
[56:11] that farmer does is he gets a product
[56:13] Hallelujah he gets something that he
[56:16] wants to see more
[56:18] of Hallelujah Hallelujah he not just
[56:22] planting just to be planted no he want
[56:25] more of what he's planted he want more
[56:28] of what he had Hallelujah so he's going
[56:30] to get it in what seed
[56:35] [Music]
[56:36] for Hallelujah to get more of what he
[56:40] desires he has to get it in seed form
[56:43] and then once he get it in seeds form he
[56:46] has to find somewhere to plant it he
[56:49] can't just plant it anywhere he has to
[56:52] plant it in a place where it can bring
[56:55] forth his
[56:56] [Applause]
[56:57] desire W Hallelujah he has to plant it
[57:01] in a place that he believes Hallelujah
[57:04] under the right or correct circumstances
[57:08] it will come forth Hallelujah so what
[57:10] does he do he he gets that seed and and
[57:14] he unveils it and uh he does it now
[57:17] catch us now Hallelujah when he buys
[57:19] that seed he doesn't have to add
[57:22] anything to it
[57:27] hallelujah
[57:29] hallelujah he takes the
[57:32] seed he finds the proper ground and then
[57:36] he plants the seed but after he SWS the
[57:40] seed what comes next the element of
[57:43] Faith Hallelujah so he has to depend on
[57:48] Hallelujah the place where he planted he
[57:51] has to depend on the elements around it
[57:53] he has to depend on things that he
[57:56] cannot control Hallelujah that's what
[57:58] the farmer does he has as he SWS the
[58:01] seed he also has to step back into faith
[58:05] and depend on things that he cannot
[58:08] control he cannot control how much the
[58:11] sun will
[58:12] [Music]
[58:16] shine but he has to trust that when it
[58:20] shines it will be enough for what he
[58:23] planted woo

[1:06:06] is in what we call our message H and the
[1:06:10] message is Jesus Christ Hallelujah and
[1:06:13] you know Church there's a law that God
[1:06:16] put inside of a
[1:06:17] bird and what is that law to be able to
[1:06:20] fly in any kind of condition
[1:06:24] yes
[1:06:26] sir y'all remember that
[1:06:29] year you had uh like four hurricanes in
[1:06:33] a row back to back 2008 n something like
[1:06:36] that you know I was down here one of
[1:06:39] them
[1:06:40] years I was down here when when when we
[1:06:43] did our first meeting with brother
[1:06:45] Westco he was it was brother Char the
[1:06:48] hurricane out there I remember his name
[1:06:49] was Hurricane dentist H and we were we
[1:06:53] were were uh had the meeting plan
[1:06:56] already and and we had to go to brother
[1:06:58] West CO church and everybody flew in and
[1:07:00] came in and I didn't drove and now
[1:07:02] there's a storm out there Hallelujah and
[1:07:04] the storm is out in Miami already
[1:07:07] Hallelujah and it's beating and beating
[1:07:09] and beating Miami and the and the winds
[1:07:11] are blowing to we can feel the winds up
[1:07:13] here in West Palm but did that stop the
[1:07:16] Saints from going
[1:07:18] around no y'all was still riding around
[1:07:21] going to the store going out to eat
[1:07:23] everything I'm looking at y'all like
[1:07:24] somebody crazy they don't know it's a
[1:07:27] hurricane
[1:07:28] idea but there was a level of faith in
[1:07:31] you guys that the hurricane couldn't
[1:07:34] stop the hurricane couldn't stop you
[1:07:37] Hallelujah from going to get that
[1:07:39] chicken the hurricane couldn't stop you
[1:07:41] from going to the gas station the
[1:07:43] hurricane couldn't stop you from
[1:07:44] fellowshipping with one another why
[1:07:46] because your faith was greater than what
[1:07:48] your eyes could
[1:07:51] see Hallelujah and you know that that
[1:07:54] that that that hurricane came and and
[1:07:56] you know it blew some things up and and
[1:07:58] then I got under the atmosphere you guys
[1:08:00] we and I said you know what if they
[1:08:02] ain't afraid why am I afraid Hallelujah
[1:08:05] I serve the same God they serve so I
[1:08:07] said you know what before I preach I'm
[1:08:09] going pray about this thing Hallelujah
[1:08:11] so before I preach I got on the pull pit
[1:08:12] and I said you know what I can feel the
[1:08:14] fear in the building
[1:08:16] hallelujah what happen in this church
[1:08:19] today if there was no
[1:08:22] fear
[1:08:25] if there was no fear in this place any
[1:08:28] and everything will become possible
[1:08:31] right
[1:08:34] now because when fear is gone Faith
[1:08:37] takes
[1:08:39] over Hallelujah yes cuz remember it was
[1:08:43] fear first Hallelujah before he spoke to
[1:08:46] the bull
[1:08:50] sir sir he wanted to sh the bull uhhuh
[1:08:54] yeah but God put him in a situation
[1:08:57] where he couldn't operate in his fears
[1:08:59] he said he wanted to shoot it but he had
[1:09:01] no gun and then he wanted to out run it
[1:09:04] but the F was too far so what did he had
[1:09:06] to do he had to fall in the atmosphere
[1:09:08] he said you know what now what what he
[1:09:10] going to do he said the only thing I can
[1:09:11] do is trust God so what did he do he
[1:09:15] sold Faith to godall he said Lord if my
[1:09:18] time to go I guess it's my time to go
[1:09:21] but I'm not going to die like a coward
[1:09:23] Hallelujah and as he had as he sold that
[1:09:26] unto God hallelujah and evidence of
[1:09:29] substance Hallelujah begin to be created
[1:09:31] right there in his atmosphere Hallelujah

[1:09:36] of what he was swing came down in the
[1:09:38] atmosphere of controlling a b yes sir

[1:12:47] this cuz I got tired of getting
[1:12:50] whipped by God h
[1:12:54] well let's move
[1:12:55] on we understand that there's a law in a
[1:12:58] bird right is that law still working
[1:13:01] today talk to me church when you look at
[1:13:04] the bird what do you think about it can
[1:13:06] fly it doesn't even have to be
[1:13:12] explained this particular law Hallelujah
[1:13:16] your intellectual faith has nothing to
[1:13:18] do with it cuz you can't explain how a
[1:13:21] bird flies you just look at it and say I
[1:13:24] know it's
[1:13:27] true Hallelujah and it's the same thing
[1:13:30] with some of us we can't explain why we
[1:13:32] here all we know is that we still
[1:13:35] [Music]
[1:13:36] [Applause]
[1:13:39] here but you know one of my first trips
[1:13:42] I'm kind of going back just just to get
[1:13:44] you a law one of my first trips to South
[1:13:46] Africa I went to a
[1:13:48] safari you know a lion parking they had
[1:13:51] lions and cheaters and all these other
[1:13:53] things things and hyenas and all that
[1:13:55] but in this time they let the CB the
[1:13:58] baby lions you could come and get them
[1:14:00] and feed them and pet them and do all
[1:14:01] that now the teeth was still sharp now
[1:14:03] so you had to be
[1:14:05] careful cuz it still was a
[1:14:07] lion even in this baby stage Hallelujah
[1:14:12] but you know one thing I learned about
[1:14:13] that I looked at the lion and you know I
[1:14:15] begin to think about it and uh that
[1:14:18] little lion it'll come up to us you know
[1:14:22] we'll feed and everything and
[1:14:23] occasionally it'll look at you and it'll
[1:14:35] say what we call that we say that's a
[1:14:38] meow from a cat meow
[1:14:42] meow but to that
[1:14:45] lion that was a
[1:14:52] raw
[1:14:54] it don't change from a meow to a raw
[1:14:57] according to a li always was a
[1:15:00] raw but as it mature the sound of it
[1:15:05] Chang
[1:15:07] W and as you mature the sound of your
[1:15:10] prayer should change the sound of your
[1:15:13] walk should change the sound of your
[1:15:16] worship should change Hallelujah the
[1:15:18] sound of whatever you do your life
[1:15:20] should change you should go from a
[1:15:24] to something that could move
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:30] trees that same baby lion Hallelujah I
[1:15:34] would pick it up and caress it and rub
[1:15:36] it I just came back

[1:16:02] place why because now I want you to
[1:16:07] catch this now it's still the same
[1:16:10] creature but what's happening now is
[1:16:13] when I once pet it why can't I pet it
[1:16:15] now because I'm Living Through My Five
[1:16:21] Senses Hallelujah that's the only reason
[1:16:24] why I can't pet it right because my five
[1:16:28] senses is telling me D ain't a baby

[1:16:33] like to eat
[1:16:35] meat my five sister telling me you ain't

[1:16:44] seed Hallelujah when I was created the
[1:16:48] lion bow down to
[1:16:51] me and the only way I get back to that
[1:16:54] place is if I believe in what God says I
[1:16:57] am Hallelujah and if I can get to the
[1:17:00] place to where I believe what God says I
[1:17:02] am I could be able to walk up to that
[1:17:04] lion and say hey sit and be
[1:17:09] quiet but the only way you're going to
[1:17:11] get there Hallelujah if you live through
[1:17:13] another CEO in the building Hallelujah
[1:17:17] and your eyes are not the CEO your ears
[1:17:20] are not the CEO your touch your taste is

[1:21:56] what oh boy I set you up real good just

[1:22:26] least 20 years you've been hearing the
[1:22:28] word so where is your perfect
[1:22:33] Faith cuz the more you hear it the more
[1:22:35] you should become what you're
[1:22:38] hearing that's right right we got
[1:22:41] sisters in our church who are nurses
[1:22:44] they don't always remain floor nurses
[1:22:47] because as they stay on the job the
[1:22:49] better they get the better their skills
[1:22:52] get and as new people come along they
[1:22:54] have to move them up
[1:22:58] higher Hallelujah but some of y'all have
[1:23:01] been here for years and years and years
[1:23:02] and years still saying to God lord
[1:23:05] increase my faith oh Lord are you not
[1:23:09] hearing the

[1:23:19] again faith comes by hearing hearing of
[1:23:23] the
[1:23:29] word all
[1:23:31] right so there should be a measure of
[1:23:33] faith in this
[1:23:35] place in this

[1:23:48] of time oh
[1:23:50] my faith CU by hear hear of the word of
[1:23:53] God and and and and and the word says in
[1:23:57] Hebrews he says without faith it is
[1:24:00] impossible to please God why because God
[1:24:03] is the
[1:24:06] word
[1:24:07] hallelujah okay now we can establish
[1:24:11] Hallelujah that the word is being
[1:24:13] preached here but then the prophet of
[1:24:15] God he preached the message Hallelujah
[1:24:18] called perfect Faith Hallelujah why is
[1:24:21] the word in faith fa going together

[1:24:26] stimulates your
[1:24:29] faith you ever heard she you ever heard

[1:24:42] produce

[1:25:51] revelation

[1:26:47] joy in my seat
[1:26:50] Hallelujah don't let the the devil
[1:26:52] listen oh on couple years ago I was
[1:26:57] going through something I started to get
[1:26:58] depressed yeah and a brother this is
[1:27:02] this is kind of what I'm about to say is
[1:27:03] kind of the meat of my message a brother
[1:27:07] he called me and he said hey he said I
[1:27:11] know that you were sitting in the back
[1:27:12] of the church he said I know that's not

[1:27:24] Joy cuz once he steal your joy
[1:27:27] Hallelujah he'll send you out there in
[1:27:29] the world and what you think going to
[1:27:31] bring you real happiness is only there
[1:27:33] to destroy
[1:27:35] you right tall dark and handsome to
[1:27:39] destroy you peti sexy to destroy
[1:27:45] you because what the enemy is doing he's
[1:27:48] working on your emotions and real faith
[1:27:51] has nothing to do with your emotions the
[1:27:53] gospel of Christ has nothing to do with
[1:27:55] your emotions we don't live by our
[1:27:58] emotions we live by what's been
[1:28:04] revealed sir but listen what's been
[1:28:07] happening all this time the whole year
[1:28:09] and if you didn't miss the whole year
[1:28:10] shame on
[1:28:12] you now it's time to get back where you
[1:28:16] belong listen I'm going to show you how
[1:28:18] important this is you take all the
[1:28:20] things that I've been saying I don't
[1:28:21] know none of you really I know your
[1:28:23] faces and and different ones and we call
[1:28:25] each other family and we love on one
[1:28:27] another but I don't personally know your
[1:28:29] life I don't personally know your
[1:28:31] struggles so if I'm saying something
[1:28:33] that's hitting you that's God's telling
[1:28:34] you I love
[1:28:37] you oh you thought it was the devil no
[1:28:41] it's God it's God letting you know that
[1:28:44] he loves you so much he's trying to get
[1:28:47] you out of
[1:28:49] error he's trying to pull you back into
[1:28:52] the solid
[1:28:53] foundation and you get mad at me no it's
[1:28:56] God he loves
[1:28:58] [Applause]
[1:29:00] you I'm sick of waiting I'm
[1:29:03] sick don't be sick of it all right
[1:29:07] H
[1:29:09] listen so for the whole year we've been
[1:29:13] hearing what the
[1:29:15] word Jack going to be proud of
[1:29:20] y'all we've been hearing the word
[1:29:22] word but when we hear the word what's
[1:29:25] been happening the word comes to
[1:29:28] stimulate our faith that's right to
[1:29:30] stimulate something means what to excite
[1:29:33] to
[1:29:36] activity so when you hear the word it
[1:29:39] should produce an
[1:29:43] Awakening it should make something
[1:29:45] become more real to
[1:29:47] you it should awaken something that's
[1:29:50] already down there in that seed
[1:29:52] Hallelujah that's why sometimes you get
[1:29:55] so excited you dig up the
[1:29:57] carpet all right all
[1:29:59] [Music]
[1:30:03] right see some of y'all wasn't here for
[1:30:05] that but these are the kind of things
[1:30:07] that goes on when you get
[1:30:08] stimulated Hallelujah some people get
[1:30:11] stimulated Hallelujah they tear up the
[1:30:13] church some people get stimulated
[1:30:15] Hallelujah they speak in tongues some
[1:30:17] people get stimulated they get on the
[1:30:19] piano some people get stimulated they
[1:30:21] sing and they worship some people get
[1:30:23] stimulated and they
[1:30:28] cry but it's the word exciting that
[1:30:31] which is already in you calling it to
[1:30:36] activate that's why we come to church we
[1:30:38] hear the word of God because it's the
[1:30:40] word hallelujah that what quickens the
[1:30:43] seed it's the word hallelujah so brother
[1:30:46] Jag and and different ministers what
[1:30:48] have they been doing they've been
[1:30:50] sewing hallelujah

[1:31:24] a friend of mine in London the
[1:31:26] UK she she she she planted a pear tree
[1:31:31] and then when when the pear got a
[1:31:33] certain size it's supposed to push out
[1:31:36] and produce right but year after year
[1:31:38] this big old tree wasn't pushing out no
[1:31:41] fruit so she went up to the tree and she

[1:46:47] there for you to
[1:46:49] do
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:46:56] okay there was a woman with a blood
[1:46:58] issue for 12
[1:47:00] years and this went on and on and on she
[1:47:02] went to physician went to all these
[1:47:04] people and the scripture says hujjah she
[1:47:07] went to these people and still wasn't
[1:47:09] made whole but then hallelujah the Bible
[1:47:13] says that she did what the same thing
[1:47:15] y'all doing she heard of
[1:47:18] Jesus yes sir now let me ask you
[1:47:21] something is her hearing any different
[1:47:24] from your
[1:47:26] hearing because she responding to what
[1:47:29] she heard about Jesus Christ and you're
[1:47:32] here because you're responding to what
[1:47:33] you heard about Jesus Christ
[1:47:37] amen but then let's take it a step
[1:47:39] further
[1:47:40] H something begins to tap into her and
[1:47:43] she says if I could just touch the him
[1:47:46] of his
[1:47:49] gar see to show your perfect Faith
[1:47:52] sometimes you have to tap into
[1:47:56] inspiration she didn't have a
[1:48:00] quote she didn't have a good message
[1:48:02] from a pastor Hallelujah she didn't have
[1:48:05] a prophet she didn't even have a Bible
[1:48:09] she just went off simply by what she
[1:48:14] heard and what she heard Hallelujah put
[1:48:17] her in a mode of inspiration to speak
[1:48:20] speak something Hallelujah that nobody
[1:48:22] else had ever did
[1:48:24] before Hallelujah so she said if I could
[1:48:28] just Touch the Hem of His
[1:48:30] Garment I'll be made
[1:48:33] whole what was she doing she was so in
[1:48:39] faith Hallelujah she put that out there
[1:48:43] where did it go it went straight to
[1:48:45] Jesus amen all right she said if I could
[1:48:48] just touch the him of His Garment I'll
[1:48:50] be made whole and not only did she think
[1:48:53] it it wasn't just an imagination she
[1:48:55] went and did it yes
[1:49:01] sir
[1:49:03] Hallelujah see it's not an imagination
[1:49:06] if you think it oh I'm about to say
[1:49:07] something heavy now it's not an
[1:49:10] imagination if you can think it you can
[1:49:12] do
[1:49:18] it woo
[1:49:21] if you can think it you can do it you
[1:49:24] just have to catch the inspiration for
[1:49:26] that moment Joshua thought about the sun
[1:49:29] being
[1:49:32] still and as he thought about it he
[1:49:34] spoke on it and as he spoke on it
[1:49:38] creation Hallelujah obeyed his
[1:49:42] [Applause]
[1:49:47] voice praise God oh my there so much in
[1:49:51] this and I ain't got the time because
[1:49:54] when you catch the right inspiration you
[1:49:56] tap into things that have already been
[1:49:59] done right Hallelujah now she's tapping
[1:50:02] into the inspiration Hallelujah for a
[1:50:04] blood
[1:50:06] issue God had it was always about blood
[1:50:09] right there was somebody else who tapped
[1:50:12] into a blood issue remember God told two
[1:50:15] boys two twins I want y'all to go
[1:50:17] worship today not with Mom and Daddy
[1:50:19] Kane and Abel
[1:50:20] and one thought it was about his
[1:50:22] imagination God's so pretty he's so nice
[1:50:24] I'm going go give him some fruit and
[1:50:26] then hallelujah Abel caught an
[1:50:28] inspiration of what blood yes sir and as
[1:50:31] he caught an inspiration it became a
[1:50:33] revelation Hallelujah to bring God on
[1:50:35] the scene hallelujah what was it doing
[1:50:37] what was able doing Hallelujah as he CAU
[1:50:40] the inspiration he was showing what God
[1:50:43] was going to
[1:50:46] do the lamb that was slain before the
[1:50:49] foundation of the world Jesus hadn't
[1:50:52] died on the cross yet Hallelujah but
[1:50:54] Abel's inspiration picked it up he
[1:50:56] killed the lamb for his sins just like
[1:50:59] Christ would do for you and I yes
[1:51:01] [Music]
[1:51:02] sir
[1:51:04] hallelujah oh my let's come on down to a
[1:51:07] close but

[1:51:11] says if I could just touch the him of
[1:51:14] His Garment I'll be made whole what was
[1:51:18] happening she was sewing
