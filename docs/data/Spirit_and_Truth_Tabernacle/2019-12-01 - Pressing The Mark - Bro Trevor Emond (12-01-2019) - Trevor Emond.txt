had right before Thanksgiving it it was a wonderful time of just relaxation got a chance just seen a service on last week and just really enjoy my precious brother bill and they made him coming up just to be a blessing to the hearts of the Saints just just appreciate all that was done in Jesus name no we got many that our way this weekend for holiday and everything but we thank God for you that are here this morning so good to have a man two of my good friends here brother Steven Indiana he's here with us this morning he came along with brother Trevor they have recently returned from a trip to back away they were there in Beck way and ministering and just the Lord did a wonderful work and some of y'all may not know it is the Lord has called brother Stephen to ministry and he is accepted back home the Lord so this was his first time going out and preaching the gospel out about abroad there in Bequia and and just just a real lesson and they told me and sister Rachel that all the saints says the greetings to you a man a man from back away but the Lord is blessing them over there and you know a few years ago of sister Rachel I actually went and and I had a chance to administer there and there's a seven mile island just I had never heard a back way before in my life and just so happened one of the brothers from their church happened to just be passing through here and looking for a church to fellowship they found this online the brothers start fellowship before the Caleb Ford was his name and brother Caleb got him where he could get he a nice I have no I'm here for a while I song lead back get back at home and you don't mind I like the song lead while I'm here alright brother come on you don't find folk that want to work Oh y'all they got talked to you know what Lyon fine folk that want to work you know what I want variation I'm taking a break no any time the Lord need me to do something I'm ready to do it for him you know and I brother Caleb came and you know what he invited say so you got the they got to come and so we did and and they say when you come you gotta bring sister Rachel with him so right and I didn't realize you know what the impact was but a lot of the churches a man were not used to seeing female musicians male musicians but he weren't used to see a female musician some of these sauces to reach lay flat and they it just really inspired you know some of the sisters they're not only you know we went to the Zimbabwe for the first time some years ago with and then again took some few men female musicians so I remember the pastor made a comment say all I know is that became preach that's what that's all I know the Bible City nights was a pretty preacher man that's what the by Jose so uh so the next thing I went back to somebody that's awesome sisters on the camera in all kinda I said well praise the Lord that's that's the way it's supposed to be God got something that we can do Frank a man let's be faithful in what he's called us to do you know bless since that's it we just stay in our place God do have a order now and I know the church world has changed his order but God still has an order take man and he blesses that order so we think of all things a couple of things I need to just do here real quick before we get I'm gonna have brother Steven come and just greet you and a little bit and then they will hear from brother I got a two cards a man that I just wanted to read norm people nicest you gives life a brighter touch and so to each and all of you thanks very very much this is in the loss of our dear mother Rubio Daniels thank you for the love thoughts and prayers the dishes and donations the hands that you lent to our family may God bless each and every one of you and that's from this love from the Dana's family also to brother Jack in spirit and truth tabernac who appreciate your love support cards and prayers love from sister Brown brother Michael's sister Linda and sister Laura and the loss of their brother amen so I just want to acknowledge that I want you to just continue to keep both families and prayer their loss during amen this season this is first Sunday a man of the year I mean of December and I wanted to give our building fund update quick a man and I'll just do that real quick and then I'll have fun brother Steven prepare to come we are so grateful for the Lord Jesus a man and that's just what he's done for us this year and not only what he done for us this year but what he did for us last year and what he continues to do for us an expectation that he's given opened up some doors that we can't see they've had things that he get ready to do so I'm believing God it's just a second slide of you just saw press play on there for me [Music] praise the Lord we have been able to accumulate over 32,000 dollars this year has just been real good Gator salute [Music] okay so our goal for the year was to raise two hundred and five thousand dollars [Music] that came for the year was fifty six thousand three hundred and nine what has been received of that has been thirty-one thousand four hundred fifty seven dollars in twenty one sin to give God praise for $37.00 21 soon thing is that we were able to gain some interest off the money that we have put away and we got a six hundred and five dollars in manifold sin and interest might have to pay a couple bills that I couldn't build six hundred and five dollars of interest but we thank God for that which gives us a total for this year in total there's no transfers we did now that means we didn't have to take the money from the building fund to pay our normal operating expenses God met our needs he's this year and I saw all the man it's been given to the building fight has been able to stay in the building fund and so our total that we've been able to save for this year thirty two thousand sixty three dot fifteen seven the skill got race [Applause] you know we're not a large car but look as much when God is in it right and and I just been seeing the hand of the Lord just moving and I said and as we share this you know update this is not for us to just talk about money we got the bank this is for the glory of God because our plan is to buy a building that's what that money is for is to buy a building that next month what I will do amen we'll have a business meeting instead there in January and and I almost give you just I'll show you just through a presentation just a total amount that we have from last year and we had this year you know even from the year before but I know the Lord has allowed us to accumulate a roughly over seventy thousand dollars and I'm grateful for that for know where we were I've know where we come from it's times we couldn't get no more than five thousand dollars right and then we get that then we have to use it to pay some bills but the orders been so faithful to us and and when I when I look at I just I'm just I just believe that this is our seats sister-sister says the cops that we're in a new season now we have authority they man so I'm just leave this our season when you see the angel Lord moving like this you have to you got to get rid of the jump in man don't come to God with excuses I've been waiting years with it and I know it's time to jump in but angel orders moving now glory to God hallelujah so I'm just I don't I don't know how and wind I but I just I got my I got my faith on the line and God gonna bless us with a building a man and I still got a particular building in my heart that I'm looking at and they ain't been able to sell and they nobody else been able to buy it and I was talking to the realtor Nate told me some things that have happened with the build and they said I'm said they had sold the house they stole the apartments I say that's fine really we want a church and my belief is that and we get the church eventually going to get the house and we get the apartment we get it all ask that's what we ask God for right so I don't it doesn't matter that he bought it they can have it for now it's temporary right but we'll we'll take the church so they say in a we there's somebody has submitted an offer but we got to take it before the board because we don't you know know if the board are gonna approve that now and I say well you know what they just told me is that they did not like the often that was presented by the other person therefore they have to take it to the board to see if the Bourgogne approves that's gonna take a long time fools I mean they did not get the full price offer that's what they just said [Music] if they would take day off then maybe we can come up with an offer that they bought it can't consider [Music] it won't be what they asked it but it's a whole farm [Music] it's an offer so there's some number here somewhere then we gonna find that's gonna work for everybody praise the Lord so I'm the expectation Church I'll just keep it in prayer and the Lord would just watch over amen of this process and I'm just I I don't even want to say things like if that ain't it that God got something else for us I don't want to even talk like that that just seemed like I just put a look down there I ain't gonna say that until it's sold right maybe that wasn't it because you know when I when I when I bought my the house that we have we actually went looking at multiple houses and are closed many doors a man force and God knew exactly what we needed and when he brought us to the house that we have now every one of our we had so god no what are you doing I know that much I know that much but since it's available I'm gonna put my faith on it hey man I'm gonna put my faith on it so I'll keep it in prayer I'll keep it in prayer this you ain't over with y'all know what year this is right God can do something incredible around expectation brother Steven amen solder quits he's gonna come at this time indiscreet you in the name of the Lord Jesus a precious friend of mine from Indiana amen god bless you brother Steven god bless you precious Saints it's so good to be here I've wanted to come for such a long time and I know many of you have come to Indiana and I'm so thankful to have you there with us and sing and brother Solomon was talking about his favorite singers brother Jack and brother Hammond I think he said but I have to say I agree with him except I don't know that other brother but my two favorite are brother Jack and brother Solomon so I had a treat this morning already and looking forward to what the Lord will have but as far as favorite singers there's on the female side he mentioned there's one of my favorites singing sitting here sister brother Jack's wife I mean mother and my I have to say my number one singer is my wife on the female side so she wasn't able to come but well we'll definitely try and bring her down and fellowship with you sometime soon so we as brother Jack mentioned we went to a back way and as he mentioned I had accepted the call in my life I'd been kind of avoiding it for a while and brother brother Nathan our pastor there the Church of the open door had been preaching for probably about a year on yielding and boy every service it was just hitting me and hitting me and oh Lord I know I don't want to hear it I don't want to hear it but after a while he has a way of getting through and I'm so thankful to be serving him and and in his will and I just wanted to mention a little story from when we were down there and back way you know brother Graham said in this age that the the love of many would wax cold and there what you wouldn't really find true love outside of this bride and I know in a message he in his presence he talked about how when you come into the presence of God that you want to go and tell someone you want to tell people about the Lord and you know when we were there in back we went about four years ago and I noticed out by the airport they have this grassy Airport that they built out into the sea and there's grass kind of all around it and there was this real nice playground and and the parents were there and their children were playing on the playground and it was just it struck me how wonderful the fellowship was amongst these people these were just people on the island and I was so sad to see this time when we went that that playground was overgrown with grass and nobody was there the parents were gone the children were gone it was just a sign of this time no matter where you're at the cultures changing and the people are changing and technology is coming to the island and so forth but we know that amongst the bride' that love is there and I just want to encourage you to stay the sweet group that you are keep pressing on and when one more testimony uh brother Jack was mentioned in the building fund over there they're building a building also and the Lord is providing and and they're doing what they need to do knowing they don't have everything in place yet they don't have all their money but on faith they purchased some land and on faith they got the bricks and they started laying the foundation trust in the Lord to bring them all the way through the end and we we were able to go at a time when they found out some information that some brothers in the u.s. had come together and had donated some money so they can keep the work going and put that roof on and I know the Lord's gonna be doing the same for your all's building fund I you know there's gonna be some trials I think back a couple years ago I bought a house we we had a house my wife and I for about ten years and we sold our house and we bought a new house and the interesting thing was is we had special permission to move our stuff into the house before the closing date and I thought well thank you Lord this is wonderful and as the offer was accepted there was other people that was wanting this house just like other people's one I guess this property and and and the real estate agent said there's showings lined up the whole weekend long and and said to the seller do you want to take this offer for mr. Soderquist and and the man said well I think I do want to he gave me my asking price that's what I wanted I'll take it and the real estate agent probably saw the dollar signs in her I said are you certain you got showings listed all weekend long somebody's gonna come in and give you a higher price and said no they gave me what I wanted I'm gonna give it to him I know that was the Lord but you know the thing is there was trials after that because we got this special prepossession our stuff was already moved into the house we had already moved into the house even before closing a couple days before closing and the I think it was two days before closing I got notice that I'd been laid off of my job my job had gone away and here I sit in this house losing my job before closing what and you know what Satan comes and says you know they're gonna you're gonna get to closing your night they're gonna find out your job got let go and then you're gonna have to move all your stuff and your family to some apartment you know and you get worried by that well I had never met this lady this recruiter I work in the IT field and she came and I reached out to her I'd never met her but I had heard about her and I reached out and I said I I'm in need of a job ma'am do you know of anything in my profession and she said I do I do know of something and so she set me up on an interview and it was with a company I had worked for before and I get onto this phone call on this interview and it was the man who had hired me before and he said come on come on back come on back so the Lord provided me the job we were able to close on the house and I just want to say friends the Lord is mindful of you and I'm so encouraged that brother Jackie you all have been able to raise these funds and I know he's going to take you the rest of the way god bless you Saints I love you so much [Applause] [Music] my god God know how to encourage you it send the right person along at the right time just to strengthen your faith oh my and see I guess sometimes we don't see it that way but by him moving the stuff in the house before the closing God was already trying to say this yours no matter what happened afterwards this yours don't move your stuff mine because he had he not moved his stuff here he might like to have done it after he found out he was losing his job God know how to set you up with for something cuz he got great things in store he ready to do the exceeding the abundant above all you can ask a thing glory to God [Music] hallelujah a man there was a song I was listening to who can stand against the Lord [Music] this song says victory belongs to cheese trevor was singing this this morning as we were coming towards the church so you notice we're singing it in love and back way I say okay well we'll have to try to do a little bit of that a man this morning that see four pairs that come to bring us to work let's stand to our feet bailiffs prepare hearts to receive the word of the Lord [Music] you can stand against the Lord who can stand say no Alleluia to stand against the king [Music] [Music] come up safely to be lots of Jesus 40 below [Music] come on everybody victory Jesus hallelujah who can stand against the Lord everybody lift your voice say who can stand against [Music] hallelujah [Music] we who can stand against our king no one so and who can stand against our King [Music] victory belongs to Jesus victory belongs to me [Music] victory belongs to Jesus victory [Music] amen it's Jesus Christ that brings victory into your life to victory belongs to [Music] [Applause] if you have your Bibles just have you turn to Luke chapter 16 and verse 16 appreciate the song service and the specials always enjoy it very much when we come here happy to be back with my Florida family man just 18 years met brother Jack and it's been a wonderful relationship I was just flipping through the thing with the minister sign and just seeing how many just how many times we've been together and just appreciate the Lord creating this opportunity brother Jack was one of the really the first minister that ever had me had me preached outside of you know my home church back in South Dakota and one other place just real real close friend of the family and before I'd really even accepted a call to be preaching but so I I appreciate this place very much amen so Luke chapter 16 and verse 16 the law and the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it it also turn with me to Philippians chapter 3 we'll read verses 13 through 15 Philippians chapter 3 verses 13 through 15 brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind reaching forward forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if in anything you be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this unto you so even if you're perfect you should have this mind this mind is that you should be pressing toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus you say well but but wait wait wait wait what is there to be what what is there to do after I'm perfect like haven't I arrived let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lordan may you break down this scripture to us may you open our eyes to it Lord I was just seeing that a little plaque in the pastor's study about open the young man's eyes father I pray that you'd open the eyes of our hearts this morning to see your word to see our place in it to see how you have perfected us by the blood of Jesus Christ but father that we should never count ourselves to have apprehended but that we should continue to press the mark show us what that mark would be father that we would press towards it we ask it in the name Lord just just anoint us this morning anoint me to speak that may it be your words father I ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated so I want to take a title of press the mark now if I had slides or something like that you would you would see that I want to emphasize the mark I know that you've heard a hundred sermons on pressing and I know that you know it's it's it's fun to be an evangelist and evangelists like to come and stir the people up and get them all you know happy and you know Angela Starr kind of like grandparents right I mean you you send your kids to the grand you know grandparents and they show them up they get them all stirred up and then they send them back you know to the pastor back at home and then the pastor's got to deal with all that and you know and and then all the people like well how come you're not giving us candy pastors oh well because you know sometimes some of us gotta feed you something good you know so so I know that you've heard a hundred sermons on pressing and pressing the mark and and you know so as much as I would love to do that and you know well just frankly that's not me and you know it'd be just kind of awkward me trying to sit here and try to get you on your feet and try to get you all shouting and rushing the pulpit and things like that that's never happened to really ever when I preached I days it just doesn't happen because it's not me and I'm okay with it but what I do want to talk about is I want to talk about the mark you see because I believe that if we can understand what the mark is that the the the idea of the that I won't have to come if you get catch a vision of what the mark is I don't have to come here and feed you sugar and get you all stirred up and though Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya let's go let's press let's press no if you see what the mark truly is you'll be like hmm going I'm going you see see the problem of our pressing it's not it's not a motivation it's not our emotion it's not our you know where we're at but the problem most of the time is is that we don't go truly what the mark is and if we really look to what the mark is and values the mark and kept the mark high enough to where we realized you know I want that mark to be high I want that mark to be to be essentially unattainable because then I can continue to practice I can continue to press because if you have a high mark there's value have you bring down the mark and everybody can hit it well did you hit the mark today yeah I hit the mark today along with a bajillion other people you know good job good job you know it's like you know giving trophies to all the kids that played soccer whether they want anything or not oh did you get a trophy today oh that's so amazing you must be so good actually I got tired and I sat down and pick daisies and then the ball hit me in the head but I got a trophy yay yeah that's what happens you know and so and so even we we even recognize the kids the kids don't it's like oh yeah I got another certificate throw it in the thing with the rest of the certificates you know like it there's no value to it you know but but there were some things that my kids did you know I was surprised I when my kids were younger I said well let's do this triathlon and I thought there's no way you know cuz if I would have been there dad you want us to do a triathlon and that sounds lame you want me to run bike and swim long distances yeah no great idea dad you know great yeah but no but my kids were like okay yeah let's do this and my daughter actually got 2nd place and and and the only reason she didn't get first place is cuz the other you know we hadn't upgraded her bicycle yet and so the girl that actually won had a you know big you know person bike and so you know those wheels cover a whole lot more ground you know and she's like pedaling for all she's worth and she's got these little wheels and otherwise she beat her and you know both the run and the swim but anyway she remembers that she values that trophy cuz she knows she did well not everybody got a trophy and she you know and and then it got to the point where she was just like hey can we do those kinds of things again because she realized she was pretty good at it and she realized that you know hey there's trophies that I can earn that there's something in you know that something about me and my uniqueness and my individuality see I'm I'm pretty good at distance and I can go and press this thing and I can actually achieve something you see when and and so now there's value attached to it you see what we try to do in our age is try to lower the mark so often that's what our culture tries to do is lower the mark lower the mark lower the Mar you lower the mark use in then why do we do that in culture why do we lower the mark well we lower the mark because to keep a high mark is essentially interpreted this mean these days you know it's it's if one kid wins and one kid loses so that's mean to the to the losing kid well no it's not mean that just that's life that just happened you know nobody went over to the kid and like I'm gonna you know you know beat you while you're down like that would be mean okay but it's it's not mean to have a competition and have one person that succeeded more than the other the other would just say then oh you know what we need to work a little harder we need to try a little better we need to you know have more practice and then we could be feeling to what they feel right now but in in our culture we interpret you know well the higher the mark is the more values attached and that's great but if we bring it down see then everyone can achieve it's like yay everyone can feel worthless together and we all just hug ourselves right now and what's the what's the point of that see see then there's nothing that's mean but then there's nothing that's really worth doing right when you bring down the mark nothing's worth it you bring down the mark you bring down the thing that is to be achieved you bring down the value and then now we wonder why we have a generation of people who are totally depressed who are on on medication who are sitting there with hundreds and thousands of friends on their phone and lonely because we've given them nothing to do we've given them nothing to achieve the mark has come down so low like we can't even we can't even decide whether or not they're man or a woman or or you know I mean the mark has come down so far there's zero definition of anything in culture and if there's zero definition of anything in cultures and then nothing matters anymore so the point we're now even the feminists are getting mad at the you know the newer movie you know the LGBTQ movements because you know well there's well how come we can't be we can't be happy about being powerful women if it doesn't matter if we're women or men anymore I mean did you ever think you'd see that day why cuz the mark got brought down so far there's no there's no definition and if there's no definition there's no value now do you think culture doesn't has no way that it gets into the message has no way that it gets into the word of God you know if you do come out from under the rock and good morning I'm your wake-up call here it happens and if we're not careful we'll tend to bring the mark that we are pressing towards down and lower and lower because then everyone achieves then we can be one big happy church family you see in and and and to be quite honest unfortunately that's the mark that many of us have tried to to bring about in a church it is to say well the mark of a good church is to be one really big happy family and as long as we love one another and everybody's you know we just you know we have fellowships and we have food and we have you know and we have good worship and we have you know of course the preaching and and you know but as long as everyone's really United and happy then we're a good church is that the mark cuz if that's the mark and you're hitting it then great that's not the mark that's a good thing that's a wonderful thing to have and I hope your church has that but but but that's not the mark anybody shouldn't be able to achieve that but that's not the mark the problem is is when we think we hit a mark we tend to stagnate we tend to you know stop a lot I've hit the mark like we read in the scripture now as many as be perfect leave us minded Paul is telling us you you you need to feel like you you have to press Paul says I count not myself to have apprehended Paul says I myself have not hit the mark now now I just want I just let's think about who Paul is the first church age messenger you know a man who has so much revelation in his life that God gives him a thorn in his flesh now anybody else have that kind of Revelation you got a physical problem because you have too much revelation like that if you don't have this physical problem in your flesh you're gonna get a little prideful anybody okay but this man found that he has not apprehended yet so it was no problem for him to press he didn't have to wake up in the morning and go okay you know meditation get my mind on the right things visualize what I am supposed to do for today yes okay now I feel good and I'm going to press no he just he just knew there was so much there for him to attain there was so much of God for him to be able to press towards that it just it was just like oh man there's so I want him so much he's so amazing he's so great he's so righteous you know I mean what are you what are you looking for in the Millennium what what are you what are you looking for when we get to the morning what do you want the morning to be like what do you want the millennium to be like good food you're next so think okay what do you want the money knowing him to be like you don't know you guys need to think about this a little bit more okay we'll come back next time and we'll ask you she's laughing what do you want the millennium to be like peace and happiness we want peace and happiness in the lynnium right yeah why do you want peace and happiness in imodium because you're selfish you want it for yourself you know it I want peace and happiness alone well why well cuz I just really want that okay yeah that's good good I'm just teasing I actually told myself I was selfish one time so you know different than me so the curriculum what do you want what do you want millennium more manifestation of Jesus Christ okay like how so like you know how would you see that physically manifested what what is it you'd like to see he yeah he wants to be a musician the millennium why cuz he's not here he wants it for himself no he probably wants it so he can praise God so the really where I'm where I'm trying to go is this I I asked myself this time you know am I being selfish but like lord I just man bring on the Millennium Lord and then I started asking myself why what do you want the millennium well cuz I oh good food no it's happy there's peace there's there's you know righteousness we don't have to you know just like oh my I don't have to deal with that in the Millennium you know then I thought Lord am I being selfish why do I want these things and I begin to fit realize the reason I want these things is because I want Jesus Christ and if if the millennium is peaceful it's because Jesus Christ is there and made it so if the millennium has righteousness it's because Jesus is righteous and he made it so everything I like and everything you want about the millennium is cuz God has made it so it's because they're everything you wanted them how do the millennium is a manifestation of the character of God physically on the earth that's why you want the millennium is because you want God now many times we don't think through all that all that way it took me a very long time to come there and realize it's not just that I want peace but it's that I want peace because it comes from God that God is the source of everything that is wonderful in the Millennium so of course if I don't have all of that now then I want to strive and press for that because that is the mark I want to keep the mark high I want peace in my life now because why he gives it to me [Applause] amen so so there's a there's a mark that's high that we should press towards because it's who God is and I'll give you a little secret you know the closer you get to him the more you find of him to get we'll talk about that here just a little bit but but that shouldn't be defeating that should be exciting it's like man who you know it's like it's like you know going for Iran and getting five miles in and then realizing there's still like 10 miles left and I thought I was getting closer but well that would be and that would be pretty defeating feeling but that's for for me for sure like running that far are you kidding me like I always thought you know I'm gonna run to that stop signing you start running you know you get down to like two driveways away and you're like and that stop signs a long way away I set that mark way too high but that's not the way it is with Christ with Christ the closer you get to him the rhythm the more you find like wow there's so much more to get but it's amazing because you realize the journey has been wonderful and you realize wow he is he's just so much greater than I ever thought you know I don't think about the stop sign wow it's so it's so much redder than I ever thought it would be I'm so glad I'm here like no that's it's not even a comparison God gets more amazing and so you you you so it is your desire to have more of him grow but that is if you keep the mark high because once you've brought the mark down and you feel like oh I'm finally that I'm there and I'm good yay I'm a message believer so good to be here I have attained going in the rapture my name is written down and all these things are wonderful all these things are great but if that if that has caused you to stop pressing then you've missed what the mark should really be because the mark has not just come in sit on the Pew do the message thing say the message stuff clap at the right times rejoice at the right time say the right things no that's a low mark I'm glad if you've hit that mark praise God you should strive to hit that mark but that is not it that is not and you say no no no put up a brother Trevor you know isn't this a carrot on the stick you know you keep - you know you're riding on something in the horse and you keep the you have a stake and you keep the carrot and go the more the horse goes it doesn't matter the carrot is out on this end of the stick and he never gets there saying brother Trevor like you know I got the Holy Ghost like you guys been preaching to me you need the Holy Ghost you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost you need you new birds you you know and and you need to clean your life up and I've done all of those things and I finally did that and now you're telling now you're telling me now that I've got the Holy Ghost and you're like no I'm still not there you got to keep going is that that's just a carrot on the stick like when is it enough brother Trevor when is it enough brother Jack whatever and so so so make sure that your discernment is right here I'm not talking about your salvation I'm not talking about the purchase I'm talking about your life I'm talking about your purpose I'm talking about what what can define you even as an individual oh my I'm trying to get all these notes out and like one sentence and it's not working like we talked about if the world brought it low and there's no definition then then everybody's just a bunch of mush and nothing matters and if nothing matters there's nothing worth doing if there's nothing worth doing then what are you here for can you imagine that so bringing that back into the spiritual realm can you imagine sitting there having the Holy Ghost and feeling like whoa but I mean I've arrived and if I've arrived what's my purpose what am i doing what is there a value what is it that God is asking me to do now some of you would avoid that you want to avoid what is God asking me to do but I tell you if you're avoiding what God is asking you to do if you're avoiding the personal responsibility that God is calling you for then you're avoiding purpose if you're avoiding purpose you're avoiding value if you're avoiding value what are you doing you're bringing the mark down and when you bring the mark down you sit on the Pew like a puddle of mush all your message mush your Holy Spirit filled mush but you're just mush there's no definition there's no nothing there but what I'm telling you today is that God has a mark that's so high and so wonderful but then that he wants you to press and it talks about even you as an individual let me just for word you know like five pages into the notes and talk about this I don't we'll just let the Lord do what he wants a Christian is not a tool or some kind of mechanical wrench to a great big religious regime that's right a Christian is not some kind of tool that keeps a religious organization moving that that's not a Christian a Christian is to be christ-like and a Christian cannot be a Christian until Christ comes into the man the life of Christ in him then it produces the life that Christ lived and you do the things that Christ did did Jesus just sit on a Pew well Jesus went to church yes is that all Jesus did now let's let's let's reno the identified masterpiece of god we're always going to be that way because God is not a Sears and Roebuck Herman house he hasn't got a variety he makes one one way and one another but we must serve Him in the way that God made us and be glad and stay behind his word and that's the way God did it you see God has a uniqueness in you God made you a specific way and God had a reason to make you the way he made you this isn't just psychology this isn't just the New Age stuff everybody just hugged yourself and God made me lovely the way it's not just that no like they've taken that and perverted that but if there's nothing but the truth God made you a specific way God made God made my brother here his way and the way he teaches and preaches the message it's different than me and God wanted it that way you know I'll never forget you know I think it was the meetings I think 2014 or somewhere around there it's it's me and brother Andrew Glover preaching the meetings together that's like a good joke you know I don't wear a size 23 shoe you know I mean you know you get me who doesn't get a crowd up and off their feet very much and rush in the pulpit in and you get Andrew Glover who like does you know and I'm like calm down people let's talk about the word you know when brother Andrews like come on raise the roof you know and and I'm just you know I'm this and you know brother Andrews except he only needed like two hops to do that and I could be tempted you know I could be tempted because you know as a preacher you know I hey I like that right there or that you're hearing you know who get up off your seat just a little bit more and rush the pulpit you know and come on I want you guys to do that because it man that would just make me feel like an amazing preacher the response I got out of the people oh my goodness and and if I don't get that maybe maybe just maybe I'm not as good of a preacher as brother Andrew Glover and I could get discouraged but God didn't make me that way he didn't give me size 23 shoe to hop across this you know into hops and get all excited and you know do that you know all the way around you think you know cuz when he does it you know y'all get like your mmm this is great and when I do it you laugh so I realized God didn't make me to do that but I'm not that's not that's not how God made me that's not the purpose that God shaped me for and that's fine that's good and maybe then I should just focus on the things that God put in me to do through me another quote here brother Ram talks about how they were cutting out the stones for the temple you know and they'd be slotting these little stones and he says you know maybe God had some some odd shaped stones I think is is that what he says God down through time has cut out some very odd stones that we might not have understood but they have their place exactly in the temple in the building of God and Joshua by instrum inspiration not by just mathematics he inspired by God he was talking about how they positioned Ephriam and these different things so so God has odd stones he says God in his master works no one could have ever done it but God there's no way of doing it gone alone it was to be theirs forever it was a gift from God by his marvelous grace give these people this land in this position and place them in it according to his word in the birth of the people just perfect and how it clucked right together and I think it was a type so what he's saying is is that maybe you're an odd stone maybe you'll feel like you're cut just a little bit different that you're maybe just a little bit different than other one as someone else and no I just wish I could be this person or like that person and you know what God made you that way God cut you that way because God wants to use that God wants to use how he made you to bring glory to his name God wants to use you he wants to use you and your uniqueness and your individuality then what a defense would it be then if we're to just well yeah I'm unique I'm individual but you know I got the Holy Ghost and so pretty Sean preacher because I have attained and I'm going there and praise the Lord comes even so come Lord Jesus I will sit and relax to you get here you see that's a low mark now you could say oh brother Trevor you just want us to press more no I want you to raise the mark up I want you to realize where the mark is and and you know what's so great about that is when you bring the mark up and it inspires you but then it also gives you the value then you recognize that God is valuing you more than he's valuing more than just sitting on a pill but he has enough value in you to to make you in a certain way that he wanted to use you in a certain way as you press the mark he then fills you with purpose and when you fulfill a purpose it's wonderful see when you take responsibility when you take responsibility now these days we look at respond man responsibility like everyone just wants to get out of responsibility right right okay well jesus paid it all I don't have responsibility no yeah not not in your salvation but doesn't he deserve you doesn't he deserve getting glory out of your life and if he begins to get glory out of your life you'll start realizing like this is the best thing ever and like you'll become like addicted to like God get glory out of me now that's one addiction that I'm probably okay with and then you'll feel wonderful about yourself and that's the self-esteem I'm kind of okay with like hey I just have you know I serve god I feel good about it and I love preaching I mean just you know my daughter always asked me what was the best part of your trip daddy it's always the same answer preaching we were just we were just in the Caribbean on a seven square mile island with beautiful beaches perfect weather amazing this amazing creation that if you've never been snorkeling or diving like you think you know like you've seen God's creation and then you you put your eyes underwater in the Caribbean and you recognize like I know nothing about the creation of God because there is a another world down here and it's just amazing but the best part of that trip was preaching as I loved serving him I love to encourage the people I love that God Church I love that God can use me me I know who I am I know what I've where I've been and what I've come from and I know what my faults are I know what my failures are I know that I still have to you know I still have to make sure my thoughts are right and that I don't think the wrong things and that I don't you know but God wants to use me God values me he shouldn't do that but he does and he has value in you and he wants to use you he doesn't want you to just sit stagnant but he wants this one thing that that you to be mindful of that you should press the mark because the more you press the mark the more God can use you the more God can use you the better you're gonna feel and the more wonderful it's gonna be and you'll have this great relationship with God and you'll be moving forward and moving forward and recognizing there's more of God to get and but God is using me more and more and more and it's just this man it's just this wonderful cycle that you feel better and you do more and are there gonna be hard times sure there's gonna be hard times but don't we value in your life they'll be purpose in your life why because you're taking a personal responsibility to press towards a mark that is really really high and you have to work at it and and we think that seems lame these days like oh you have to work at it like wow work is hard and I don't want to work I'd rather be lazy and and and it's like well that's fine but then you don't have a mark that you're hitting do you so you can be lazy you know it's like it's like kids in the summertime let me finish school and then you know what are you gonna do this summer well I've been working so hard you know like six hours a day they've been working so hard you know not like adults who don't get the summer off and we're working eight hours a day but they've been working so hard you know you know fifth grade math that you know what are you gonna do this summer a whole lot of nothing like I mean I am so wiped from 5th grade math that I'm gonna take two months off and I'm gonna hit you I'm not gonna do anything this summer and you get towards the end of the summer it's just like well hey how was your summer it's like well I didn't do anything like well how do you feel about that yeah I don't know like it's not really good like it seemed like such a good idea at the beginning of the summer but now I look back and like what I just wasted my summer like i sat in front of a screen and played video games and I didn't didn't do anything I didn't get anywhere I just I just sat there and became a puddle of mush all summer long and you asked you know you asked him like whoa did you enjoy it yeah no I guess not why well because they set a low mark and they hit it they hit the mark they said it was so such a low mark that they they themselves didn't even ascribe value to it after they hit it set the mark high and you'll feel good about trying to hit it you may not you may never actually hit it and as a matter of fact you won't hit it but the point I was saying about that carrot on the stick you know you think well you're saying who set the mark high and then we never hit it and won't that be depressing it's like is that is that really how small your god is that that that he's good with you just you know do you do the right things and then you're you know that's what you give him that's how small he is because I serve a god that's so big and so amazing and so wonderful that even if I never hit it like fine I'm diving in I'm pressing on I'm going high I'm getting more into him and more into him because it's wonderful because it has value you know we have the quote we often we often quote this to ourselves we we say you know well brother Branham says we're living far below our privileges we're we're living millions of miles below our privileges you know when these young men someday you know they're gonna want the privilege of driving and before they get keys to a car they're gonna have to show something they're gonna have to show there's responsibility that they can handle that privilege you know what does every parent ever said when the child comes and says I want to pet well you'll have to feed it you'll have to clean up after it you'll have to wash it you'll have you know there's so much responsibility that goes with the privilege of having a pet and then we read the quote in church we live far below our privileges well if we type privileges to responsibilities in life and then we read this quote and say well we're just living far below our privileges God has so much more that he wants to give us and pour out on us and we're just living far below it like how is it that we're living far below our privileges what is it well you know we want that pet in Christ what do we have to have responsibilities in Christ we want access to the keys and access to the car in Christ then maybe we're gonna have to have the responsibility in Christ responsibilities not a bad thing so this culture would try to say that laziness is a bad thing it gives you no value it brings you down to depression but responsibility in Christ can give you more privileges and God is happy with you and you're happier with you and everything's just happy why because you're pressing the mark and it's a high mark and you're not sitting around thinking well I've just attained I'm oh good I'm going there names written down praise God even so come Lord Jesus no I'm pressing the mark that I can have responsibility that God can use me that God can fill me yes even me God can do something through and how wonderful I mean I reflect on that it's like god that's so amazing use me more then put it yes Lord put put me in the harness and let me pull for you okay I'm pressing God see I'm not telling you to press telling you to set your mark I don't bring your mark down maybe I should put my notes down and look at it for just a moment here praise the Lord so a big problem is is that we think we've arrived so many times brother Branham says all our churches has sowed the winds they're reaping the whirlwind we don't have the prayer meetings we don't have the services we used to have what's the matter we've let down the bars on everything even to our Pentecostal churches setting full of bobbed haired women we've lay down the bars but the Branham says that little song you know we lay down the bars we let on the bars the Sheep got out but how do the goats get in you know our culture today is like sheep goats four-footed animals like who's to say once one which one we should keep this one in and that one out like that's ya know there's sheep that keep in there's goats that keep out the bars are the the definition the delineation of what is good and what is not good you have to set a high mark you know if you if you want to be an archer and you want to you want to be known as a good archer an Olympic you know archery you know professional what do you have to do we have to practice you have to train what are we talking about well there's a there's the circles on the wall back there you know and the small one in the center is the thing I got a hit and if I don't hit it it's like man I can barely see that little dot in the middle like can we just make that just a little bit bigger well what Olympian wants that like can you make that a little bit bigger I can hit it better so can everybody else so what does that mean what's the purpose of being a limp an olympian then come on church what's the purpose of being a Christian is that so you can go to heaven or so that you can hit us a mark so that you can train that you can press that you can go in and say God maybe myself I'll never hit that market but I'm gonna keep trying and I'm gonna keep training because God you're worth it and your wants everything that I can I can give to you you're worth everything you can get out of me because you gave me everything that you were not only did you give me your physical life and died on a cross for me but then then not even the physical blood that cleanses me but then you gave me your spirit that it could come and live on the inside of me and make this body make something good out of it make it an overcomer make it something that could press and actually hit a mark from time to time that's what it's about you know we come to a place where you know I think it was just a few days ago was the anniversary of JFK being killed and isn't that JFK that said ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country I always thought man that's you know yeah preach a little while that's not just what God can do god I need this God I need this and oh god I need this oh god I need this but God what can I do for you today is anyone fit Church isn't he worth it but it's so hard the mark is so small it takes so much practice it drains me so much really really because with those responsibilities and as you you strengthen let me think about it think about look at look at how far you've come in your Christian walk yes you've come through trials and you've come through different things but but now let's take a moment and look back through your life and thank God I came through this and I came through this and God you used me here and what a privilege that was to do something for you and and then you begin to recognize that there's there's something that there's value that God is getting out of you and how wonderful that is that to know that God's getting value out of me and you know and instead of just being like well I'm just so glad that Jesus saved me and you know but I'm just you know I'm just the smallest of all Christians and I'm just you know I pretty much live a defeated life but but I'm so glad for the blood God wants more than that for you I mean thank God thank God that you can live that way if you so choose and then still go to heaven you know because yes God's blood did you know cleanse you from all sins and and and you know but but but then as you begin to look like well okay I'll try to do something for him and you know maybe I'll go and you know hey can I give you I just want you to have this this book or this tract and you know I did something for you Lord and you see what happens to your posture like like I'm not like this anymore but then I went and I was like here you go god bless you and and and and the more you do it you're like oh oh god bless you here I want to wanna give you something and you recognize it God man God's using me oh god bless you brother how are you you know it's certainly be good to be in service for the king isn't it I begin to feel pretty good about distance I'm hey you want a book let me tell you about a prophet and your shoulders roll back a little bit why because you're becoming a son and daughter of God and you're recognizing that a son and daughter of God they stand erect they they walk around like a son of the king even though there's all kinds of people sitting in slavery in the world but yet there's a bunch of people that are walking around with a different posture because they know they have value because they know they have purpose because they're fulfilling a responsibility in their lives that God is giving them and when they fulfill that purpose because there's definition that defines what is good they begin to recognize they are doing something of value and they don't have to be depressed like the rest of the world because the mark came down but because they kept the mark I and began to press for it man their soldiers came back they begin to recognize God values me and he wants to do something in my life and yes I'll give him everything yes so press tomorrow yes I'll keep going and that's what God wants out of each and every single one of you not only does he want everything from you but he wants to just continue to fill you and push everything that he is that is good into your life how good it is to be able to go back and go my even 10 years ago I was still struggling with this and struggling with this but God by His grace that's brought me so much farther and know I'm you know what I mean in one sense it's like yes I'm proud about how far God has brought me I'm not I'm not proud about what I did but I recognize it's that grace and I'm just so happy that God could have brought me this far knowing who I am and now I can serve Him like like people around the world actually invite me to come and preach to them what a crazy thought that is praise God I'm so happy to do it god I want to press tomorrow I haven't apprehended I'm not stagnating because I'm just sitting there feeling like I've done the thing I've got it you know god this is all you're requiring here you go I'm done happy day then you sit there and then things begin to creep into your life because you've just stagnated you're not pressing you're not doing anything you begin to you begin to lose the the value you begin to lose the purpose you you begin to lose the vision and then then well I'm not well what are you doing for him well I don't know I mean kind of bored in the evenings and so I just you know I just play video games that's what I'm a Christian okay good I mean fine and then you know then things just start coming in your life because you've stagnated because you're not striving because there's no value anymore and you're just kind of you're just sitting and existing and you know then fashion of the world comes in and then music and violence and garbage you know we started we were talking there in Sunday school about you know about God being personal God is very personal do you know wonderful that is that God is so personal he wants to live through you he doesn't want you to just come and sit and be religious that's not what God wants God didn't want to just hey everybody conform to the moral code that I tell you is right and then if you do it good enough and because you couldn't I I cleaned you and then I'll take you to heaven as long as you believe that and try well he's got lofty expectations if that's who your God is that small little God that you made up in your mind but that's not the God of the Bible it's the God of the Bible that is amazing God he's a big God he's a great God he's the author of every everything he made you and that amazing wonderful marvelous God wants to live inside of you and use you to bring him more glory like yes God that sounds you know what you know next summer that sounds better than anything I had planned amen serving you or sitting there doing nothing hmm well if you recognize the value of the mark there won't be you won't have to have the sermon that yells you'll press people press you've got a press and you gotta press and you gotta you know that you don't need that sermon because you're like hey cut that's so amazing I can't I just lay I wait I get to press yay let's press cuz I want to hallelujah see the problem is is that and I how long have I been preaching somebody just somebody just be honest with me how long have I been preaching it's 12:30 what time do I get called out oh my goodness all right let me I don't know all right all right yeah we got a couple more things that we want to cover okay so so let's talk about a mark that we that we bring down and one of the marks that I feel strongly that we we tend to bring it's we is we well it's the mark of message culture and and or the mark of our church culture and if we hit the church culture you know if all the sisters do the things that the other sisters do and all the brothers do the things that the other brothers do and then you know well we're just you know we're just pretty good spirit and truth Tabernacle Saints it's like well good and if you've hit that mark praise the Lord that's wonderful you know but then you begin to look at the others and you go wow they they don't do it like we do well then you have a problem because it's like well did I hit the mark are they not hitting the mark or what's what's the issue so then we come to message culture you know like I've talked about and we we kind of feel like yeah as long as I do the messaging things and I say the message e things where the message e things that I'm good and then then we stagnate we stop there and we go well I've arrived because I've hit this mark of culture and then when we find other churches that don't have this message culture that the same maybe there's just little bits that are different you know and then then then what do we do will we recognize well well now there's a problem so so yes as your pastor says you either lower the mark so that everybody can just be okay or what we begin to try to do is we begin to try to say well but our message mark is right so we want to get you know everyone else to the same message mark and you know how we do that well we do we do that with our own culture you know it's it's funny you know we'll just well just come over into our culture see and we'll then you'll have hit the mark and then you then you can stop pressing because you'll have hit the mark see we went on we were in South Carolina brother Luke's church and we were fellowship and with one of the young brothers whose deacon and get along really good with their family and they had a few families over and we were just having having a nice time and they have this they have you know they're kind of country folk in there out there you know in the sticks of South Carolina and and they're on this you know kind of farm and they've got the sheepdog and they were kind of laughing because they were there you know they were almost they weren't taking bets because they you know but they were kind of like cuz we don't do that but it was like you know you know but we say of course you know how much you want to bet that didn't you know the the sheepdog nips brother Trevor's heel this time because this dog was notorious for you know for because that's what sheepdogs do you know they they try to corral sheep together by nipping at their heels you know so so this dog just trying to fulfill its nature apparently like it could be off at the front you know very very front of the property you know a hundred yards from the from the door and they said you know and if you're walking in you know and you walk up the steps and in turn and to go in the door that dog will shoot from the from the front of the property and jump up onto that porch and nip your heel just as you're going in the door I said you won't know it you're like the dog was nowhere near me how did in and they'll come and it'll nip it you're healing and they were like I bet I bet it's gonna get brother Trevor this time and I thought Lord what am I gonna do is this dog nips at my heel and it's Saturday you know when I'm preaching twice the next day you know if this dog nips at my heel I'm gonna kill their dog and then I'm gonna be preaching to them later and I'm just not sure how that's gonna go so I really hope this dog doesn't nip me in the heel because I'll have to try you know to react you know differently than my nature disposes me to act and it will certainly be a trial so then they're like well let's take a walk you know and down the country road so we take a walk guess what the dog comes you know so there's like a good 12 14 of us you know just chatting and and you know so my family's there and and everybody's like I don't you know how about that stop biting me and I'm like we'll just stay in the middle you know cuz that's what the dog wants he wants everybody to stay in the middle of the pack you know just just stay in the middle and you're fine according to this dog you know so I mean of course we're like see you dog mmm-hmm I'm watching you dog I mean it's the most uncomfortable walk I've ever been on well we just you know my whole family's just like you know we're we're not petrified of this dog you know I guess we enjoyed the walk but you know just like I'm sure would have been better the dog wouldn't there and isn't that what we try to do we try to nip at people's heels to get them in the pack and that's what we try to get them to we try to get them to this very very low mark that is message culture just care get in my message culture and everything will be fine here just sit here you see isn't that just seeds of denomination right there just here just we bring down the mark to where it's this message culture and try to get people into it by like because we're message sheep dogs so you have to first in your mind have set that mark very very low it's higher than that it's higher than that so what God wants to tell you today is he wants he wants you to step up he wants you to see that the mark is higher than you with been thinking it and and to not get complacent to not sit here and and stagnate because you you've hit something and if you're sitting here and you're thinking well churches like the same like we enjoy it we have great music and but church has kind of been the same for me for the last I don't know three to five years so I asked a question when's the last time you pressed what is the last time you really felt like you pressed and if you haven't pressed why haven't you pressed it's not that I'm saying church start pressing you know you're you're lazy quit quit being lazy and press that's that's not what I'm saying but I would ask you if you feel like well it's been a long time since I really feel like I've pressed the mark why it's because you brought the mark down and you feel like you arrived but if you set that mark higher you set the mark of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus it is a high calling that God has called you to he didn't call you to a low calling he values you much more than that he called you to a high calling of of the prize of the mark in the in Christ Jesus it's a high calling he's asked you to press he's asked you to press because the mark is so high so if you haven't pressed I would say it's probably an indicator that you set the mark too low Church set the mark I he's so great he's so big he's so high how do we how do we instead of but but but instead of the unite because we're concerned about other people you know and we want them we begin to press the mark we want them to press the mark and that's that's great we want to fix other people's marks you know that's Noble that's Noble I mean that's what I'm trying to do right now so I can't say anything against it but but but where's this quote here from sudden secret going away of the church how could we help other people set their mark higher brother branham says it's not up to the Branham tabernacle neither is up to any church it's up to you as an individual to be ready at the coming of the Lord you must be ready I'll sweep my own steps it's up to you to sweep your steps leave mine alone me leave yours alone you've got to make your garment ready now if you think about this quote you know you would think well it's in it I'm just like hey sweep your steps no don't you worry about my steps you sweep your steps I'm dealing with mine you deal with your you know that seems kind of mean doesn't it seems like we don't care about that person you leave mine alone I'll leave yours alone doesn't sound Christian does it but what happens let's let's think about this though what happens if you begin to sweep your steps and you you know you get you get that broom and you get to the front porch and you you start sweeping and you realize there's color there that you haven't seen in many years and it's kind of nice and you get the dirt you know off that top step you see the dirt comes from the ground and it comes up the steps and and you know you can think about that is like coming through your heart and out you know on to the physical okay so your first step and you begin to sweep it you know and you get the DVDs that you shouldn't have any music that you shouldn't have in you know you get the makeup and you get the the the jewelry and that all of this is and that all of that sand you get it out you sweep it off all these things that that effect you know that people could see and you clean that step and then you would go down to the next step and you'd start cleaning that step you know you start getting bitterness and malice and jealousy and you know all these things that cause the problems up the step you know because you brought that you bought the dirt from the the ground of your heart you know and you brought it up the step still to where it's manifested you know and so now you begin to get down a little bit deeper and that that's where it gets a lot harder sweep in that step and then you would go even deeper and really get into it in the pride and arrogance and you know God starts showing you maybe you're not as great of a Christian as you really thought you were and you know maybe you need to get rid of that pride before I can actually use you you know and so you start sweeping that step but but you know the problem is is that when you begin to do that see there's there's to the reaction of two types that people can have they can walk by your steps and go ma look at those steps wait look at mine ma no mine are dirty but you know last week our steps look the same but now I see something going on here now there's two reactions people are gonna say what do you think you're doing well you think your steps are better than mine don't you or the other thing they're gonna do is like those steps look good what you've been doing well been sweeping them what I've been you know I've been really trying I've been really you don't strive in every I've really been pressed and I realize say that God wants more out of me and and and and instead of them saying like you you saying I'm not doing an office like man I'm nuts I'm not saying anything about you I'm saying I strove and swept my steps because I realized MA my steps were dirty we're in those sentences did you did you hear that I thought your steps were dirty I swept my steps because God showed me they were dirty so instead of them and you can't help that you know and so here's the thing is that you're gonna you're in a suffer persecution when you sweep your steps who you think you are oh you think you're just some prayer warrior don't you oh just trying to do what God asked me to do I'm trying to take it to another level oh you're saying I'm not there no I didn't say that see many people begin to hear those things you see so you're gonna suffer some persecution when you and maybe that's the reason we don't do that is because again we set the mark is the made big happy family we want the happy family you know pastor don't preach something to preach so hard you know we got some people struggling with that and we we don't want to offend them well I mean I'm not for preaching hard just to you know push people out of the church but but the mark is the high calling of God in Christ Jesus it's not to just keep us all happy and then hopefully by little you know however your church is gonna grow but the church should grow in grace and in holiness amen so so you sweep your steps and then people get kind of offended but but the other but the other reaction would be those look way better than my steps why well I started sweeping and I realized I had some things that were covering those steps and when I when I got the broom out and started doing it I could see the color honey yeah we got a boom yeah give me that broom Hey that's amazing I want my steps to look clean to sweep your steps other people catch the vision you don't have to you don't have to worry about it just sweep your sis just you know don't worry about everybody else press the mark Church don't worry about other people's marks you send the mark hi they're gonna recognize that guy is striving for perfection he's aiming at something high and I'm just sitting here going like is there a target over there like and they're gonna go well maybe I should practice maybe I should try to strive maybe I should you know maybe I should put on a suit and a tie and you know and really press in and no disregards to somebody who's not wearing a suit and tie but I'm just you know I'm just saying you know we raise a standard in some way we step up in some way and we strive a little higher and we get a little higher into Christ and then we keep pressing and we keep pressing and it doesn't stop but it's never tiring it's never depressing it's actually the opposite of that and our culture today would like to try to tell you that that trying something and trying to do hard is it's boring and difficult and just stop because everybody will like you better anyway if you don't you know show them up well I'm not trying to say show up a bunch of other Christians but I'm but I'm gonna show up for God so let's get rid of this stuff in our lives let's press the mark let's see here what have I not gone through in these notes yeah praise Lord so what are some of the what are some of the lies that you would tell yourself to say well I can't do that by the shopper I can't you know God could use other people but he can't use me because that's maybe where some of you are at and that's just but that's just a lie you know you think about the seventh church age messenger you know brother Branham you know born in a cabin in Kentucky to you know an alcoholic dad well what's his pedigree what's his was he look at and say you know yeah that's why God can use me because X no God can use me because he chose me that's that's what lie is it you know I mean you think about Moses you know he tried and killed a man and epically failed but God turned it around right what lie are you telling us I'm not good enough well God could not even use Samson I'm not good enough David fell and and and God got still used him a church God wants to use you even you in your own peculiarities your own uniqueness your own faults God still can use you in spite of all of those things and through all of those things and make you into something wonderful his strength is perfected in your weakness so don't lie to yourself don't feel like you've attained because Paul says I don't count myself to it to have apprehended amen because you're living instrumentality of God because you're the final voice to the final age under your messenger because you're the ones not this church but you as an individual you as an individual are coming up to a place where you are the super race the super church as you near him because you can be that spirit born spirit filled man that takes the Word of God into their heart and places it upon his lips and faith places upon his lips that's the same as deity speaking it's a high calling God don't just trust that to someone who hasn't pressed to hasn't strove you don't you don't just get to get to clean your sin out of your life and let God fill you with the Holy Ghost and then think my goodness sakes I'm just gonna I'm just gonna speak and everything's gonna go the way I say it that's like you know becoming 15 years old and thinking well my goodness I of my son of my dad and he's gonna give me the keys to the car tomorrow cuz that's my 16th birthday and I'm gonna drive all over this town no no that ain't gonna work well he's gonna take you to a big parking lot and then he's gonna put it in park and get out let you drive a little bit in a parking lot where you can't hit nothing and then you're gonna strive and practice and get better and maybe at some point in time he's gonna allow you to get onto the interstate and that first time you get on the interstate man that's gonna be some kind of scary you should be like these cars are going too fast it's like I thought you were just thinking like I'm just gonna become this myth this awesome driver on day one no but you kept pressing you kept striving you kept going through the fears and through the pains and sort of hurts and through but but through all of the successes you've grown and you've come so far keep pressing church don't let the mark come down set the mark hi the mark of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus it's the worst thing you can do in the most offensive thing you could really kind of do to Christ is to bring that mark down keep it high recognize I'm striving to serve you god you're awesome you're amazing you're worth pressing for you're worth giving everything for and then God can use you God can fill you brother Branham says in the message beyond the curtain of time musicians can come each one of us play a part in this picture and in this song we are parts of the kingdom of God and that is that we can play our parts as long as we realize where we are presenting lis belong in this place and then stay right there in that place and one place we know it's in love because that's what makes up the picture I just love how this how he lays this quote out that it's so artistic and beautiful each one of us play a part in the picture and in the song you get a choir each one of you is playing a part in that song you paint a picture each little you know maybe make it into a puzzle each little piece goes in a specific place and that's you you are a specific place and God wants to use you and make you the best whatever that place is that you could ever be and that'll fill you with the most value you'll ever have in your entire life I guarantee you but you have a part God wants to use you maybe you think you're insignificant and you think well what can I do well start pressing and God will show you start asking God get down to business with God don't don't don't allow yourself to just just like well I'm a believer so yeh no I don't don't stop that's that's that's just that's what the dot denominations do you know get get to our met get get to our church culture and then wait for God to come back and bring you to heaven and then otherwise go live however you want like that that's what I'm saying he's a personal God like he is you know it's a marriage it's a love relationship you know you don't you don't you don't get married and then just be like well we're married now good good deal good you know we come back for the same house but we live two separate lives like that's not a marriage that's not love who wants that no one why would you want that what's gone say well we come to the same house on on Sunday but otherwise you know we acknowledge that we'll be there together but no he's a personal God he wants he wants all of you he wants you to have all of him he wants there to be this wonderful walk together press the mark church press someone let him be personal to you let him be personal let him call you higher let him get closer to him let him get closer to you it's wonderful it's a wonderful relationship in it it provides so much meaning and so much value but only if you keep the mark I hey men let's pray Heavenly Father Lord you're so good to us pray that Lord we would we would continually press the mark that we would keep it high Lord Jesus and recognize father that there's so much value in you oh that we could strive every day of our lives and never attain and how wonderful that would even be father Lord it's it's great Lord to serve you to grow in you to value you and see that you value us all Lauren thank you Father but I'll just pray Lord that you'd quicken these things to the hearts of the people Lord and quicken it to my heart Lord may we wake up every day keeping that mark hai with a joy to serve you and press in Lord I ask that you be with us now strengthen our hearts by your word in your spirit Lord we ask you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen god bless you church certainly good to be with you wish we could stay longer but but headed headed back tomorrow - too quick of a trip for me to be here in Florida I tell you open but we're just trying to just be here because of the ending of the mission trip there and back way and and so glad that we could be a part of you today [Music] can we just look at that scripture that brother Trevor gave us there Philippians 3:13 I just really appreciate the way two lawyers down to 13 just to break this down today and I couldn't get this out of my mind after he - radius pondering Oh how does Paul formulate words of this nature and when we think about Paul and just about every Church throughout the world that would this one that's gathered for service somebody's quoted Paul is quoting from Paul Paul said this Paul said that and a man that has been used so mightily of God that was chosen to write two thirds of the New Testament is the first church eats messages right words like this brother that count not myself to have apprehended even though I got 2/3 of New Testament I still count not myself to have a prohibit but this one thing I do in the only way that a man weekend really set the mark higher we got to kind of look at it away Paul with Ben forget about the things that you have already accomplished as if this day's a new day in your life - never even heard this before but forget it all things which are bad got ain't nothing reaching forth unto those things which are if we can do that I can guarantee this we will never find ourselves getting complete sense when it comes to the things of God I think that's one of the biggest things that we have to battle because Satan loves them well you did this you did that sometimes we put God on the scale [Music] you know and I read in the Bible my Prima just feels so good so you just put something on this side and it caused us to come right back down again and God's always on this scale gonna wanna be a little scale he wants you to he wants to be first place in your life every minute every hour every day impressive doors a mark I'm pressing towards the mark even as I go into this next year I'm pressing toward some are not looking at all the things that maybe we did in 2019 that's like I'm not I'm starting all over again [Laughter] [Music] he's worthy of our praise is worthy of our life so were there everything we can give and I just love this statement that brother Trevor made and something that we should dismantle Tate on [Music] it's about a dangling carrot in front of you but he says the closer you get to him more of him you filed to get the closer you get fine again mr. singable corset is song to you a list and our feet [Music] you gave me my head [Music] to me [Music] my years the [Music] but can a wine they're team whoa [Music] just [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I

placed at your service heart father to speak to us don't let it just go in one ear and out the other father but maybe we all put it in action Lord if or if a man like Paul that has been used so mightily by you God churches quoting his whose writings every every Sunday father people studying everything that he had to say but he would write count not myself to have apprehended what I'm just every month will give me a profit Lord how he came to lured me and he said that he would serve you so much not even if at the end you were to tell him that he didn't do enough and that he was gonna have to go and go to hell father said he would still keep serving you god what a conviction half what a mock descent because this life that we're living in serving you is the best life that anybody could ever live god how could we say we're boards how we can happily say there's not enough to do father so many souls are dying without knowing Christ God give us a burden for lost souls give us a
