[18:01] Bible oh Lord Jesus but Lord in this day
[18:04] and age oh Lord You've provided us with
[18:06] a messenger oh Lord God to reveal the
[18:09] Mysteries oh Lord Jesus Christ to know
[18:11] the inner thoughts oh Lord God in the
[18:13] backside of your mind oh Lord God to
[18:15] know exactly what pleases you oh Lord
[18:17] Jesus Christ Lord we are the Ables of

[18:27] God and what would be accept to you oh
[18:29] Lord God lord we don't come in our own
[18:31] knowledge oh God or or our own way oh
[18:34] Lord God but because we know it's
[18:36] nothing within ourselves we could have
[18:37] done oh Lord God the Bible says we were
[18:40] born in sin and shaped in iniquity oh
[18:42] Lord God but somehow Lord God when you
[18:44] passed over the earth oh Lord God and
[18:46] you saw us in our States oh Lord God
[18:48] there was compassion in your heart oh
[18:50] Lord Jesus there was a love inside of
[18:53] your heart oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord
[18:55] God there was a mercy oh Lord God there
[18:57] was there was something oh Lord that
[18:59] Drew you to us oh Lord Jesus Christ oh

[19:07] with our past sometimes oh Lord God but
[19:10] when you see us oh Lord God you don't
[19:12] look through us with your own eyes oh
[19:14] Lord God but you look through us through
[19:15] your son oh Lord Jesus Christ oh Lord
[19:18] the only worthy one oh Lord God lord the
[19:21] only one that could walk through Earth

[19:25] Lord God and everything he did every
[19:28] action action he said oh Lord God from
[19:30] the from the moment he was born in this
[19:32] earth oh Lord Jesus Christ and Lord you
[19:35] did that oh Lord God that we could be
[19:37] represented with him today oh Lord God

[20:09] Lord God lord open up the hearts of the
[20:11] people oh Lord God to be able to receive
[20:14] something for you oh Lord Jesus Christ
[20:16] oh Lord we know oh Lord that the Bible
[20:18] is more than just a book oh Lord but
[20:20] it's Flesh and Blood oh Lord God it's

[20:25] Christ and Lord you indeed are the same

[20:33] preeminence oh Lord Jesus Christ be with
[20:35] us oh Lord God oh Lord we know sometimes
[20:38] that we fail you oh Lord God but here we
[20:41] are again saying try us again oh Lord
[20:43] and be with us oh Lord God bless the
[20:45] service oh Lord God in the precious name
[20:47] of Jesus Christ
[20:52] amen amen prise the Lord all right so
[20:55] we're going to get right into the
[20:56] message uh the title of of the message
[20:59] that the uh the lord gave me um is the
[21:03] the power of
[21:04] responsibility and um uh Abby kind of is
[21:08] the one that kind of inspired me when
[21:09] she got her new car um because I'm
[21:12] noticing the the young ones that are in
[21:13] church and there everyone's getting
[21:16] bigger I uh I know my dad had a picture
[21:18] of uh the Morales when they were young
[21:20] kids and I was uh at our TV it just kind
[21:23] of passes on the screen and I saw them
[21:25] when they were all young and you know
[21:26] you look at them today and you see
[21:28] everyone is getting bigger everyone's
[21:30] getting more wiser everyone's getting
[21:32] stronger right and uh and uh a big thing
[21:36] that comes with that is knowing the
[21:37] responsibility of what you've been given
[21:40] as you as more light cuz um your
[21:43] physical your physical matur maturity is
[21:46] a type of your spiritual maturity and as
[21:48] you physically grow you see more things
[21:50] and you understand more things than what
[21:52] you had when you were younger and with
[21:54] that understanding comes a
[21:56] responsibility now right just like as in
[21:59] the in the Supernatural sense as you're
[22:01] growing uh spiritually uh there's a
[22:03] responsibility that comes with that Paul
[22:05] said you know once when I see that you
[22:07] have milk but now that you eat meat you
[22:09] got to change the way you think and
[22:11] change the way you do things right all
[22:13] right so we're going to get right into
[22:14] it with the Bible verse reading let us
[22:16] turn to Genesis 1 and we're going to
[22:19] read verses 26- 28
[22:31] and I'll go ahead and start reading this
[22:34] and it reads and God said let us make
[22:36] man in our our image after our likeness
[22:39] and let them have dominion over the fish
[22:41] of the sea and over the fowls of the air
[22:44] and over the cattle and over all the
[22:45] Earth and over every creeping thing that
[22:47] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[22:50] man in his own image in the image of God
[22:52] created he him male and female created
[22:54] he them and God blessed them and God
[22:57] said unto them be fruitful and multiply
[22:59] and replenish the Earth and subdue it
[23:01] and have dominion over the fish of the
[23:03] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[23:05] over every living thing that moveth upon
[23:07] the Earth and you may uh uh be seated
[23:12] so um I looked up the definition of what
[23:15] responsibility was and I found four uh
[23:18] examples of it so we're going to go
[23:20] through each four of them and we're
[23:21] going to we're going later on in the
[23:23] message we're going to um provide
[23:25] emphasis on one specific meaning of it
[23:27] so the first
[23:29] uh definition that we have is the state
[23:30] or fact of having a duty to deal with
[23:32] something or having control over someone
[23:36] and the next one would be the state or
[23:38] fact of being accountable or to blame
[23:41] for something and the one that we're
[23:43] going to focus on a little bit later on
[23:45] this is probably my favorite one um it's
[23:47] the opportunity or ability to act
[23:50] independently and make decisions without
[23:53] authorization and I want instead of the
[23:56] word authorization I want to say
[23:58] interference so the opportunity or
[24:00] ability to act independently to make
[24:02] decisions without interference and I
[24:05] like that word opportunity because it's
[24:07] not something you give to yourself
[24:09] opportunities are not stuff that you
[24:10] give to yourself opportunities are what
[24:11] someone else gives to you right somebody
[24:15] else is giving you an opportunity to do
[24:16] something to be independent and also to
[24:19] make decisions and the last definition
[24:21] is going to be a moral obligation to
[24:23] behave cor uh correctly toward or in
[24:26] respect of right so as we've read in
[24:29] Genesis um it shows that power and
[24:33] Dominion is a goal that God wants for
[24:35] his children it's always been inside of
[24:38] his mind ever since he created a body
[24:40] for us to live in and dwell on the earth
[24:42] God has always wanted us to be in
[24:43] control God has always wanted us to be
[24:45] on top the Bible says he wanted us to
[24:47] subdue subdue means to have control over
[24:50] God wanted us to have power right but in
[24:53] the space of time that we're living
[24:54] right now the emphasis is no longer on
[24:57] power so in the beginning right before
[25:01] the fall the character was already in
[25:04] them there was no such thing as building
[25:06] your character up now they had power
[25:09] right they had power and they had
[25:11] character but it was already who they
[25:13] were because the Bible said that he was
[25:15] made in they were made in the image of
[25:16] God so the character was there there was
[25:18] no need to build character all right but
[25:21] now the space and time that we living in
[25:23] right now the emphasis is not on power
[25:26] right which is why a lot of times when
[25:27] you hear the the prophet you hear the
[25:29] prophet preach he says don't focus on
[25:31] the gifts right don't focus on the gifts
[25:33] right but focus on the character that
[25:35] become that's behind the gifts which is
[25:37] the word and that tells you what you're
[25:40] dealing with right so we're we're we're
[25:43] in a time in space where we're not
[25:45] focusing on power because the world just
[25:48] wants power and that's what we see
[25:51] nowadays it's power power power no
[25:53] character the sole focus is just getting
[25:55] power and the prophet even said that
[25:57] power
[25:58] without character is satanic right now I
[26:03] want you to know that every single one
[26:04] of us has power right now and what we
[26:06] choose to do with it which is the
[26:08] character shows uh who's using us right
[26:12] and so the question is well how do you
[26:15] get character right that's the question
[26:17] that every believer wants to have is how
[26:19] do we get character so that we can use
[26:21] his power right it's by fulfilling your
[26:24] responsibilities right and so when you
[26:27] get a child if you're uh you know you're
[26:29] newly married and you get a child and
[26:30] you take care of them that's going to
[26:32] help build your character right that
[26:34] child then becomes your responsibility
[26:36] and it helps you as you go through the
[26:37] ups and downs cuz children are not easy
[26:40] to deal with right I used to work at a
[26:42] daycare when I was in high school and
[26:44] you know some of them I know some of
[26:45] them parents were happy to drop their
[26:47] kids off for a little bit of time you
[26:51] know because some of them kids is rough
[26:54] right some of them kids are rough and uh
[26:57] uh but it's a good thing because it
[26:58] helps to build character as a person in
[27:01] your eyes right because you know when
[27:03] you get a side eye from your kid you
[27:05] know as they start getting older this is
[27:07] this is a kid that when they were
[27:08] helpless you fed them right you took
[27:11] care of them you gave them clothes you
[27:12] you gave them love when they were sick
[27:14] you took them to the doctor and
[27:15] everything and now all of a sudden this
[27:17] one eye makes you for makes you almost
[27:20] forget about all the other things right
[27:23] and you be ready to just you know what n
[27:25] I'm done with this right
[27:28] but it's a moment to help build your
[27:30] character right to show that you know
[27:32] what I I know exactly what I did for you
[27:34] and I see what you're doing now but
[27:36] you're my kid I forgive you and I love
[27:38] you and you just put it behind you right
[27:41] and it's all and that all that shows the
[27:43] character that you have right because
[27:45] you have the power over that child right
[27:48] but then choosing to love your kid in
[27:50] spite of what they're going through that
[27:52] shows uh uh your character it's also
[27:54] character building as a child and how
[27:56] you treat your parents growing up how
[28:00] you treat your parents is a reflection
[28:02] of how you're going to treat everybody
[28:04] else in life that's why a lot of times
[28:06] kids they think that oh yeah just
[28:08] disrespect your disrespect your uh your
[28:10] parents but I'm just going to be cool
[28:12] with my buddies that you don't live with
[28:14] and you not on them with a day-to-day
[28:16] basis so you're not going through ups
[28:17] and downs with them but the way that you
[28:20] treat your parents right that's exactly
[28:22] how you're going to be with your friends
[28:23] when you get on your own that's why a
[28:24] lot of times people try to move out with
[28:26] their friends and then and bad stuff
[28:29] just doesn't it just don't work they're
[28:30] like I don't know why I moved in with
[28:31] this person right it could be them but
[28:35] you also need to ask yourself well how
[28:37] were you in your own household you might
[28:40] have been the issue you might have been
[28:41] a problem in that
[28:43] situation all right so so the way you
[28:46] treat your parents is a moment of
[28:48] character and what that is is character
[28:51] building always comes when there's ATT
[28:54] tension right it's never when things are
[28:56] good that doesn't show character right
[28:58] that that that's not a sign of character
[29:00] that's just that's just a Mountaintop
[29:02] but when things get tense when things
[29:04] get real real uh down to it and it feels
[29:07] like you're going to explode that shows
[29:10] who you are right or it's either a
[29:13] moment where you'll fall or it's either
[29:15] a moment where you will allow the
[29:17] situation to make you better right and
[29:20] that's what Christians uh Thrive off so
[29:22] the world all they want is just power
[29:24] power power I was watching this video um
[29:28] on YouTube it was a YouTube reel and it
[29:30] showed a time during the Vietnam war
[29:33] where we were uh going to war Vietnam
[29:35] and the Vietnamese had dug these tunnels
[29:38] and it was a video showing how they you
[29:40] know fought each other and the
[29:42] Vietnamese had dug these tunnels and
[29:44] there was a trap that they had laid for
[29:46] the American soldiers where the soldiers
[29:48] would fall into this hole in this tunnel
[29:51] one end they would pour water in on the
[29:53] other side and then they would be
[29:54] waiting for them on another tone on the
[29:55] other side and so now you can imagine
[29:57] this soldier that is only the trapped in
[29:59] this little thing he can't go this way
[30:02] and he can't go that way because he
[30:03] knows deaf there so now he's just
[30:05] sitting in this uh hole waiting for the
[30:08] water to fill up knowing that death is
[30:10] there and it just kind of broke my heart
[30:12] to see man treat each other like that
[30:15] right to see knowing that this man uh
[30:18] possibly has a family uh he comes from a
[30:21] mother he comes from a father he comes
[30:23] from people that loved him right and
[30:26] just to see a man be in that position
[30:28] and you have the power to let them live
[30:31] and you let them die it just shows you
[30:33] that the world from the Garden of Eden
[30:36] even though we've been given power it
[30:38] just shows you without character uh uh
[30:41] it's totally a mess right it's totally a
[30:43] mess and we need a savior to help us
[30:47] right because that's just the the
[30:49] physical side of it but when you look at
[30:51] the spiritual side of it especially in
[30:53] the church you know the prophet said you
[30:55] may not murder somebody you may not stab
[30:58] somebody in the back right but when you
[31:01] take a cut at their
[31:04] influence right or or you take a cut at
[31:07] their hope CU a lot of times you know
[31:08] you'll have someone in a church and like
[31:10] we're
[31:11] family every family has their characters
[31:13] every family has their people that's
[31:15] difficult to deal with and when you take
[31:17] the side of you know what I'm just going
[31:18] to ignore this person because I don't
[31:20] like dealing with that and then someone
[31:22] else sees you doing that and then they
[31:24] follow like okay well if he's ignoring
[31:26] it I'll ignore him too all right now you
[31:29] have to understand that Christ doesn't
[31:31] always Christ is not coming to perfect
[31:33] people he even said himself if I have no
[31:36] need to go to the ones that are healed
[31:37] I'm coming to the ones that actually
[31:39] need help right so so by By ignoring
[31:43] these people or ignoring these uh as
[31:45] like brother Jack was pre uh preaching
[31:47] before about the fellowship by by
[31:49] putting off these people or you're going
[31:51] through kind of some discussion all a
[31:52] sudden you're you're in a spiritual war
[31:54] in the church and by choosing not to
[31:56] love or you're no different than these
[31:59] men that were killing these people
[32:01] physically even though we like to look
[32:03] at that video and say oh man what
[32:05] they're doing is wrong right weend we
[32:08] end up uh being in David's shoes where
[32:10] you know the prophet came he didn't tell
[32:12] them exactly everything he just told him
[32:14] a story to type it and David said where
[32:17] is this man at we going to finish him
[32:20] right and then uh the prophet said
[32:22] you're that man that's right right so we
[32:25] judge ourselves right but uh thanks to
[32:28] the grace and mercy of God we receive
[32:30] Grace so that we can do better right God
[32:33] wants us to love each other God wants us
[32:35] to strengthen each other that means that
[32:38] you're not going to things are not
[32:40] always going to be easy in a church
[32:42] you're not always going to have people
[32:43] are going to go through certain
[32:44] situations in life that affects how they
[32:46] act and then you have no idea what's
[32:48] going on right and that's a lot and a
[32:51] lot of times you know people get the
[32:53] wrong idea of church and they say oh
[32:55] well I left church because church is
[32:56] like the church was like this and the
[32:58] church was like that the first thing you
[33:00] need to ask yourself is that God's body
[33:03] is a diverse body God has a bunch of
[33:06] churches out there and your personality
[33:09] your characteristics are not going to
[33:12] fit in all churches that's right that's
[33:14] why you have to be led to the church
[33:16] you're supposed to go to or you end up
[33:18] causing problems you see what I'm saying
[33:21] you end up causing problems for that
[33:23] church and you're a Believer you're a
[33:25] Christian 100% but you're trying to
[33:27] venture without Authority it's no
[33:29] different than the body so the body is a
[33:32] you have a different body parts you have
[33:34] a heart you have a liver you have a
[33:35] stomach and they're all they're all
[33:37] different and they're all different
[33:38] cells that are doing different purposes
[33:41] but the end goal is to keep the body
[33:44] healthy right and so you have to look at
[33:46] it from a bigger picture of Lord where
[33:48] do I fit at what church do I fit at I
[33:51] know I'm a certain type of way and
[33:53] there's a certain people out there that
[33:54] can handle your ups and downs no
[33:57] different than marriage you know you're
[33:59] you're not you're looking Lord who am I
[34:01] to marry I have these characteristics I
[34:03] have these personalities who can help me
[34:06] through this stuff not everyone can do
[34:08] that for you which is why we have a lot
[34:10] of issues with marriage and divorce
[34:12] today because people are trying to make
[34:14] their own decisions right so power is
[34:18] easy power is the easy thing it's
[34:21] already with inside of us and in the
[34:24] story of the prodical son um when he
[34:28] left did his status change in the
[34:31] household status didn't change if the
[34:34] servants were to uh talk about the son
[34:37] just because he was in that St in that
[34:38] state the father would have said all
[34:40] right this this your last day even
[34:42] though the son wasn't living up to
[34:44] expection so the son still had power in
[34:47] the house you see what I'm saying he
[34:49] still had power in the house to
[34:51] influence the father's decision even
[34:53] though he wasn't living the expectation
[34:55] right so the problem was there was a
[34:59] lack of responsibility with his status
[35:02] that was what the problem was what there
[35:03] was no responsibility so he couldn't be
[35:05] allowed in the house so and and and I
[35:08] like to I like to talk about real things
[35:11] right real real things because a lot of
[35:13] times you know uh uh this is a youth
[35:15] Service A lot of times your parents
[35:18] there's going to be a point where they
[35:19] can't put up with certain things right
[35:22] and I don't say that as a way to be mean
[35:24] right but your parents Godly Parents
[35:27] they're trying to keep a certain
[35:28] atmosphere and when you start to go
[35:31] against that they have to make a choice
[35:34] right they got to make a choice and it's
[35:36] not to uh uh uh it's not to pick on you
[35:38] because a lot of times you know when
[35:41] kids end up in that situation they think
[35:43] the whole world is against them right
[35:46] we're going to do some reading because
[35:47] Jesus typed this to a story right and
[35:50] it's something that we all know so we're
[35:51] going to turn to Genesis 3 and we're
[35:54] going to read verses 22 to uh I believe
[36:06] 24 and it reads the Lord God said behold
[36:10] the man has become as one of us to know
[36:12] good and evil now least he put forth his
[36:15] hand and take also of the tree of life
[36:17] and eat and live forever therefore the
[36:20] Lord sent him forth from the Garden of
[36:22] Eden to till the ground from once he
[36:24] came so he drove the man out and I
[36:28] looked up that word drove what it meant
[36:30] in the Hebrew word and that was by force
[36:33] right one of the definitions was by
[36:35] force and the other definition was sad
[36:37] anger right so it wasn't it wasn't God
[36:40] wanting to kick them out they did this
[36:43] to themselves but God had an atmosphere
[36:45] in that Garden that he did not want to
[36:47] change right God had his own atmosphere
[36:49] and he said nah the way that you're
[36:51] living right now right you currently you
[36:54] guys can't you guys can't stay with me
[36:56] now uh cuz it says here he says at least
[36:58] they put forth and take also the tree of
[37:00] life and live and eat forever God ain't
[37:02] want them to live in that state God
[37:04] ain't want to live with them forever
[37:05] like that God was like no y'all can't
[37:08] could you sisters imagine having to give
[37:10] birth eternally cuz God wanted to create
[37:14] Sons he told them to multiply and be
[37:16] fruitful in the Earth the prophet said
[37:18] he wanted to speak them into existence
[37:20] not by could you imagine sisters having
[37:22] to give birth eternally God was like no
[37:25] y'all can't have that up in here y'all
[37:27] made y'all's decision y'all do it for a
[37:29] time when y'all get cleaned up and come
[37:32] back then we're good right God is
[37:35] thinking and and you know and and a lot
[37:37] of times you know you'll have kids go
[37:39] through birth defects you know and it's
[37:41] sad because you'll have sometimes
[37:43] mothers are pass away and all that kind
[37:45] of stuff and people always want to uh
[37:47] blame god well why does God allow these
[37:49] things God never wanted it in the first
[37:52] place all right that was never in God's
[37:55] mind in the first place all right all
[37:59] right
[38:01] so let's see where we at so the Bible
[38:04] says that even though they fail they
[38:06] still had uh the Bible says they still
[38:08] had access to the Tree of Life which
[38:10] showed they still had power right God
[38:12] had promised them access and I believe
[38:15] that any God-fearing parent you know if
[38:19] if if if they if they've told you to
[38:21] leave the house it's not forever you can
[38:24] come back right you can clan if as long
[38:27] as you get your act cleaned together
[38:30] right and you bringing in the same
[38:32] atmosphere that's being presented by the
[38:33] parent your parents will be more glad to
[38:36] let you back in right and and the only
[38:40] reason I say this is because when I was
[38:43] when I first became a Christian and when
[38:45] you first become a Christian everybody
[38:48] expects that things are going to be easy
[38:51] but that's not the case everybody wants
[38:54] the easy path to Heaven that's on
[38:56] everybody's heart but the Bible but the
[38:58] uh the song that they have out there
[39:00] that sings it says some through the
[39:01] waters some through the flood some
[39:03] through great trial but all through the
[39:05] blood so you can't choose your path to
[39:08] Heaven how much you're going to suffer
[39:10] what you're going to deal with the
[39:11] things that's going to uh cause you to
[39:14] uh go out of church get out of your
[39:16] parents uh uh parents house you can't
[39:18] choose these things now it is you
[39:19] choosing it right right it is you
[39:21] struggling with it and God's going to
[39:23] help you with it but I just want to I
[39:25] want to I want to give some
[39:26] encouragement to you that that you know
[39:28] and especially the ones that are out
[39:29] there if they're listening if you're in
[39:31] that state you know cuz God told Peter
[39:34] right and this is the only reason I can
[39:35] say this because Christ said it cuz
[39:38] Peter was enthusiastic that he was going
[39:39] to stay with the Lord he was
[39:42] enthusiastic he said no Lord I ain't
[39:44] leaving you I'm going stay right with
[39:46] you Jesus Christ said you going to deny
[39:48] me three times before the CR Clos you
[39:50] going to deny me three times but it's
[39:53] okay I've already forgiven you right so
[39:56] it's important for you young ones to
[39:58] know and even the ones that are uh that
[40:00] may be listening that are out there God
[40:02] has already forgiven you he's wanting
[40:05] you to come back right
[40:07] now he's wanting you to come back right
[40:09] now right and even when you get your
[40:12] even if you see yourself in that
[40:14] situation I at least want this to at
[40:16] least be a seed that's planted in your
[40:18] heart so that you'll know that God wants
[40:20] me back right because a lot of times
[40:23] people think that everything's going to
[40:24] be easy I can't promise you a Christian
[40:27] easy Christian life but I can promise
[40:29] you God will be there for you right I'm
[40:33] not one of those uh uh Prosperity
[40:36] preachers that promises you riches you
[40:39] may not have riches but you'll still
[40:41] have
[40:42] Christ
[40:44] right so now any good parent that wants
[40:48] the best for their children is not going
[40:51] to allow them just to do anything right
[40:53] you like you realize that even though
[40:55] the child is Young they have a greater
[40:58] potential as they get older like you
[41:01] young ones you have the great potential
[41:02] to do great things uh uh wonderful
[41:05] things you have the potential to do
[41:07] great good things and you have the
[41:09] potential to do great bad things right
[41:11] and so your parents play a role in uh uh
[41:15] in in raising you and wanting to see you
[41:18] succeed in life because God Likens we
[41:21] all know that God Likens a a the
[41:24] relationship between a parent and a kid
[41:26] to God and his own children right and so
[41:30] your your parents are are are going to
[41:32] raise you with discipline and support
[41:35] and I like to think of that as uh the
[41:37] the the Old Testament and the New
[41:39] Testament because we like you have
[41:41] people out there that only believe the
[41:42] Old Testament you got people out there
[41:44] that only believe the New Testament
[41:46] right or people that only believe this
[41:48] part or people that only believe that
[41:50] part but you need discipline and support
[41:53] right you need the discipline to let
[41:55] people know when they're wrong to tell
[41:56] you the TRU truth but you also need to
[41:59] support to understand when people are
[42:00] struggling just like the time when the
[42:03] prophet his son had got in trouble right
[42:06] and his wife wanted him to tear him up
[42:09] but he was able to catch a revelation
[42:12] that he's already beating himself up I
[42:14] don't need to do anything in that
[42:16] situation that's the support side but
[42:18] then there are also there are some sides
[42:20] where you have to lay down the law right
[42:24] and that will save them uh and that's
[42:26] and yall have already know testimony
[42:27] about how my mom kept us locked in the
[42:30] house it felt like
[42:32] prison I I mean I stuck in your room
[42:36] doing the same things over and over
[42:38] again hey mom there's a party can I go
[42:41] nope so I ain't go to I I I I don't
[42:44] believe I don't believe I probably went
[42:45] to like one little hangout but I Ain
[42:47] really go to no she ain't really allowed
[42:49] me to go to any parties right but I
[42:51] thank her for that because parties you
[42:54] know you just think you're just going to
[42:55] hang out with friends but parties lead
[42:58] to other stuff you don't see the tricks
[43:01] and traps that are there because you
[43:04] know I've I've SE I've seen people
[43:07] homeless on the street and that could
[43:09] have been just attending one party that
[43:11] has led to a choice that's led to a
[43:13] choice that's led to a choice and now
[43:16] they're on The Silo Road asking for
[43:18] money asking for help because they
[43:20] didn't have parents that told them the
[43:22] truth cuz I remember we were we were
[43:25] living in a neighborhood with this other
[43:27] with his other mother um and we used to
[43:29] love going over their house because
[43:31] their mom let them do anything me and my
[43:34] sister we love to we love to hang out
[43:37] with them because their mom wasn't
[43:38] strict like ours right but I but looking
[43:41] back in my life and looking back at how
[43:45] the reason why my mom put us in a
[43:48] situation that it was like that was
[43:50] because of love and now now that I've
[43:53] grown up and I'm more mature and I have
[43:55] that understanding I can look back and
[43:57] say thank you for that Mom right that's
[44:00] how that's how a parent should be for
[44:02] their kid you're not looking to be
[44:04] friends with them in that moment you're
[44:06] looking to be friends later on in
[44:10] life and that can be hard for kids to
[44:13] understand you know especially when
[44:14] you're younger because it's hard to know
[44:17] what you don't know like we've all been
[44:19] there right we we've all been there uh
[44:21] uh trying to figure out things on our
[44:23] own right and so you know a a parent
[44:27] wants to wants to a parent should be
[44:29] your biggest cheerleader right a parent
[44:31] should be your biggest cheerleader in
[44:33] life because they want to see you
[44:34] succeed right so that when kids get
[44:37] older and like I said this is typing God
[44:39] because this is how God is for us uh uh
[44:42] uh um we want God should be our biggest
[44:44] cheerleader and is our biggest
[44:46] cheerleader right and so he and and the
[44:49] reason why is because when you when you
[44:50] have your kids as they get older you
[44:53] want you want to be able to appreciate
[44:55] the value they add in life right you and
[44:58] God wants to appreciate the value that
[44:59] you add uh in life which is his creation
[45:02] right and they're not bringing shame uh
[45:05] to the family name now family name is
[45:08] something that's been taken out of
[45:10] culture right because back in the day
[45:13] your your name meant something that's
[45:15] right where you came from really really
[45:17] meant something nowadays it's it's it's
[45:19] uh every nowadays it doesn't even matter
[45:21] you say somebody's last name it doesn't
[45:23] really mean
[45:24] anything right but back in the day last
[45:27] name meant something that's right right
[45:30] and we're going to we're going to delve
[45:31] a little bit in on this topic because
[45:33] family means
[45:35] representation it means uh when you do
[45:38] something people aren't only looking at
[45:41] you right they're not only looking at
[45:44] you but they're looking at your name
[45:46] that's being attached to you right so
[45:48] you know we have we got the young people
[45:49] today we got Josiah uh you know we have
[45:52] Shalom we have hadassa we have Abby we
[45:55] have Linda but it's not just Josiah you
[45:58] know your friends may call you JJ and
[46:00] jdub you know kids try to get the
[46:02] nicknames but it's Josiah Solomon right
[46:06] Solomon shows what he oh yeah Johnson
[46:09] Josiah Johnson Johnson shows where he
[46:11] comes from it's shalom Johnson it's
[46:13] hadassa Johnson Abby Morales right it
[46:17] shows that you're attached to something
[46:19] else it's not just you right when people
[46:21] say your name is not just you right um
[46:25] you're born with an expectation of
[46:28] responsibility for the name that you
[46:30] have right it's an inheritance which is
[46:34] why when um when Esau rejected The
[46:37] Inheritance it was something you
[46:39] couldn't come back from because that was
[46:42] that was who you that was who you were
[46:44] this was what your father was given to
[46:45] you right right so you know and and and
[46:49] you think about what that name means
[46:52] because your last name brought you
[46:55] opportunities so a lot of s if you were
[46:57] a young kid and you had a a a OnPoint
[47:01] father did right everybody knew him in
[47:03] the community this was a good person and
[47:06] if you and if you just was looking for a
[47:07] job and you went up to some kind of old
[47:09] ice cream par or something you said hey
[47:11] I'm looking for a job I'm so and so oh
[47:13] you're so and so's kid come right on in
[47:16] here do I need to fill out an
[47:17] application don't even worry about it
[47:18] come right on in we'll get you a job
[47:21] just because of the name you are
[47:23] attached to right and the opposite is
[47:26] true too because if you had a parent
[47:29] that wasn't doing things that was right
[47:32] and everybody knew who they were and you
[47:35] try to come and get an application you
[47:36] say hey I'm so and so oh yeah n we a
[47:39] hiring we not
[47:42] hiring right because of the name because
[47:46] of the association that was with
[47:49] it right and it's it's and it's it's
[47:53] it's it's something that as kids you
[47:55] want to make your you want to make your
[47:57] parents proud you want to make your
[47:59] father proud you want to make your
[48:00] mother proud that's why you want to do
[48:02] things in life that doesn't cause them
[48:05] to uh um kind of take a pause like if
[48:09] you if you if you're if you're a young
[48:10] sister you want to have a respectable
[48:13] career you don't want to do a career
[48:15] that's uh uh engulfed in worldliness and
[48:19] all the lust and all those kind of
[48:21] things because now when your father is
[48:23] talking to someone maybe a business
[48:26] opportunity they and they asking about
[48:28] your family like yeah hey how what do
[48:30] your kids do and you're doing something
[48:33] that is
[48:34] not you know it causes the father to
[48:37] take a step back and like
[48:39] man like what do I say you're a
[48:42] Christian you can't lie that's what do
[48:45] you say right so whatever you're doing
[48:48] in life is it's it's just not just
[48:50] affecting you right and it's all and
[48:53] also that's why you know even in our own
[48:55] lives we have people in our family
[48:57] members now the blood of Jesus Christ
[48:58] covers all I'm not here to sit here and
[49:01] and pick on people and no God loves you
[49:04] God is in the sea of God's forgiveness
[49:06] but I'm just trying to point something
[49:07] out to prevent you uh from bringing more
[49:11] uh uh from bringing more problems right
[49:14] but you know if you have you have
[49:15] someone in a family member that hasn't
[49:17] done you know just exactly right when
[49:20] people ask about your family your only
[49:23] your your first priorities are going to
[49:25] be the ones that's doing good you always
[49:27] going to talk about well hey yeah my so
[49:28] Uncle son so he owns like five
[49:30] businesses and you know my aunt you know
[49:32] she's got her PhD and her Masters and
[49:35] and it's said oh yeah what about that
[49:36] Uncle over there and it's like
[49:39] man it's a hesitation because you're
[49:43] scared of the
[49:44] association right so it's a respon you
[49:48] can see the power of responsibility in a
[49:51] name and when it's and when you become a
[49:54] Christian because it's funny you say
[49:56] Christian but the word Christ is in
[49:59] Christian your name is attached it's no
[50:02] longer just you it's you and
[50:05] Christ right so whatever you do in life
[50:08] is going to reflect
[50:10] him true right so and it's funny because
[50:13] you know when people make you know kind
[50:15] of these selfish me decisions it's a
[50:18] deception because the thing about it is
[50:21] you're always going to need help in life
[50:22] and a lot of times when you're young you
[50:24] want to go out on your own you just want
[50:25] to do everything yourself
[50:27] but the reality is you will always need
[50:29] help you're always going to need help
[50:31] you're never going to be able to do
[50:33] everything yourself it may feel like it
[50:35] because you're young and you got all the
[50:37] energy in the world and you feel like
[50:38] you can just conquer everything but you
[50:40] will always need help from somewhere
[50:43] you're always going to need help from
[50:44] somewhere and when you go out and make
[50:46] selfish decisions right uh um what
[50:51] happens is you end up coming back for
[50:53] help you end up coming back uh for
[50:55] people to come and ask you for help
[50:57] right and when you belong to a good
[50:59] family you're going to receive good help
[51:02] when you belong to a good family and
[51:03] represented by a good family you will
[51:05] always receive help but the way you
[51:07] receive that help matters it's kind of
[51:10] like if brother Jack had had a cousin
[51:12] where he came and asked him to borrow
[51:13] some money and he ain't pay him back for
[51:16] the two other times he asked and you you
[51:18] being a Christian you want to say no but
[51:21] the Bible says if someone says you want
[51:22] to walk two miles walk five miles so as
[51:25] a Christian you're like okay I'll help
[51:27] you out versus someone that you know has
[51:30] been good levelheaded and they're and
[51:32] and they might be in a situation where
[51:34] they're struggling like Hey Brother Jack
[51:35] I need I need to borrow some money it's
[51:37] like I got you right so it's always help
[51:40] but how you receive that help matters
[51:43] right how you receive the help matters
[51:46] and so continuing on with this type of
[51:50] this type between God between parents
[51:52] and kids and God and Christ you know
[51:54] when you get old as a parent and this is
[51:57] something I begin to realize you know
[51:59] I'm I'm over 30 so I can I can say some
[52:02] things I know I'm not all the way old a
[52:04] lot of old people tell me to tell me
[52:06] that you not
[52:09] old
[52:12] but but as you get when you're a parent
[52:14] and as you get old the thing is you get
[52:18] you lose strength you know you get in a
[52:20] position where you're not able to take
[52:22] care of yourself you're not able to do
[52:24] the things that you once did before
[52:26] you're not able able to think the way
[52:27] that you used to uh think before so now
[52:30] you're depending upon someone else to
[52:32] help you out and when you have raised a
[52:35] kid right and you have taught them
[52:38] responsibility and the kid has accepted
[52:40] that accepted on that responsibility you
[52:43] now have total confidence that they'll
[52:45] take care for you right they'll take on
[52:47] that responsibility of what it means to
[52:49] take care for you when you're in your
[52:52] helpless position all right right and uh
[52:56] um so so young ones it's not your
[53:00] parents wanting to control you good
[53:02] Godly Parents don't want to control when
[53:04] uh Hannah made a prayer for her child uh
[53:07] she said Lord I want him to be your
[53:09] servant I want him to serve you I want
[53:12] him to uh uh uh uh um do the work for
[53:15] you you're the one that's in control his
[53:17] life when Mary had Jesus and when Jesus
[53:20] they were at that they were at the
[53:21] meeting where he kind of said well
[53:23] Joseph is not my father the Bible says
[53:26] that she took that to heart because it
[53:28] meant something to her because she
[53:29] realized the responsibility that she had
[53:31] in this kid and that she wanted to raise
[53:33] him up in the glory uh and admonishment
[53:37] of of the Lord so Godly Parents don't
[53:38] want to control you right good Godly
[53:41] Parents don't want to control you right
[53:43] and that that types God in a way of um
[53:48] God doesn't always want to do stuff for
[53:50] you you see what I'm saying God and it
[53:53] it sounds funny right it does sound
[53:55] funny but God doesn't doesn't always
[53:57] want to uh intervene in situations for
[54:00] you right now God doesn't get old like
[54:03] parents and weak right he doesn't get
[54:05] old and weak uh um because he keeps he
[54:08] keeps uh watch over his word day and
[54:10] night the Bible says he doesn't sleep
[54:13] but he wants us to get to a point where
[54:15] we care for his word like he
[54:17] does right when cuz he's in a position
[54:21] right now where he doesn't have hands he
[54:24] doesn't have physical hands Hees doesn't
[54:26] have a a a voice like he did when he
[54:28] walked on Earth he doesn't have feet he
[54:30] doesn't have a brain right it's not that
[54:32] he's helpless but he's in a position
[54:34] where he needs help and so now he needs
[54:37] us to be able to step in but he's got to
[54:40] have confidence that if he comes down
[54:42] and gives us a word and gives us a
[54:44] responsibility will handle the situation
[54:47] correctly all right we will handle it
[54:49] correctly right he doesn't have to push
[54:52] us and and and constantly uh tell us how
[54:55] to act all the time no we know exactly
[54:57] how to act at all times right and and
[55:01] and in that point there lies a mystery
[55:03] that in some
[55:05] situations uh that you face in life God
[55:08] doesn't say
[55:09] nothing and that's to come back to type
[55:12] our definition of responsibility uh is
[55:15] the opportunity to act independently and
[55:19] make decisions without
[55:20] interference right God is wanting to see
[55:23] how you're going to act in a situation
[55:25] that's why he won't say anything he
[55:27] wants to see what decision you're going
[55:29] to
[55:30] make he's trusting you to make a
[55:33] responsible decision right uh uh and
[55:36] your parents are no different than that
[55:39] so A lot of times you know when you ask
[55:41] your parents for something and they say
[55:44] well let me get back to you out of that
[55:46] means you know they probably can't do it
[55:48] you know but but sometimes it means
[55:52] they're watching you now well why do you
[55:55] want to do this well why should I give
[55:57] this to you like you know hey hey I I
[56:00] want to I want to increase in my
[56:01] allowance okay cool let me think about
[56:03] that but they're watching what you're
[56:05] doing with your allowance right now
[56:06] they're watching what you're doing with
[56:08] your chores right now they're watching
[56:10] how you handle situations right now
[56:12] because they want to see responsibility
[56:14] they don't want to just give you power
[56:16] right they don't want to just give this
[56:17] stuff in your lap they want to see some
[56:19] responsibility which is character so
[56:21] that when they give you something they
[56:23] trust that you will handle it well which
[56:26] is why sister Abby sister Abby has has
[56:29] built enough confidence in her dad that
[56:31] he gave her a car cuz he trust her to
[56:34] make the right decisions with the car
[56:36] right he trust her to make the right
[56:37] decisions with the car there was
[56:39] something in her lifestyle where he
[56:40] looked and said now she's ready for it
[56:42] do you see what I'm saying and that's
[56:44] how God is with us it's not that brother
[56:46] brother wants to drive in a car with her
[56:48] all the time right and God doesn't
[56:51] always want to uh okay do this do that
[56:53] do this do that do this do that no he
[56:55] wants you to be able to go go out and
[56:56] say man I'm confident that if he if I
[56:58] send him along that path I'm not going
[57:00] to hear a bad report I ain't going to
[57:02] hear some kind of uh uh complaint over
[57:04] there I just trust that you know you
[57:05] walk over there let me just do something
[57:07] else right God wants to have that Faith
[57:11] uh uh in US right amen so God was trying
[57:15] to show that um to the children of
[57:18] Israel right so when Moses got to the
[57:21] Red Sea sat there and cried out to God
[57:23] for help it confused God I believe God
[57:26] was pretty confused we're going to turn
[57:28] to Exodus uh uh Exodus 7 and read verses
[57:33] [Music]
[57:34] 10-2 and it reads and uh and this is
[57:37] just a pre this is kind of like a
[57:39] prequel to what happened at the rest and
[57:41] Moses and Aron went in unto pharaoh and
[57:44] they did so as the Lord had commanded so
[57:46] God had told him to do this thing told
[57:48] him what to do and Aaron cast down his
[57:51] robod before pharaoh and before his
[57:52] servants and he became a serpent then
[57:54] Pharaoh also called the wise men and the
[57:57] sorcerers Now The Magicians of Egypt
[57:59] they also did in like in in like manner
[58:02] with their enchant enchantments they
[58:04] cast for they cast down every man his
[58:06] rod and they became serpents so now we
[58:09] here we have Mo Aaron and Moses with
[58:11] this one Serpent and they said look
[58:14] God's with us and they dropped it down
[58:16] and pharaoh and them said okay and they
[58:19] brought all their sticks and said we can
[58:21] do the same exact thing right and I can
[58:24] see that Moses and Aaron kind of looked
[58:26] at each other and we're like
[58:28] okay what's going on here but let's read
[58:31] what happened
[58:33] next for they cast out every man his rod
[58:36] and they became serpents but Aaron's Rod
[58:39] swallowed up their rods God showed that
[58:43] they had the original word God showed
[58:45] that they had the blessing in their
[58:47] situation so when Moses was at the red
[58:50] se he had already seen God stand for him
[58:54] in the midst of a multitude
[58:56] right of a multitude of decisions and
[58:59] when God said why cry he was expecting
[59:02] Moses to take the driver seat and just
[59:05] speak the word that's right right CU he
[59:07] had showed him so many times and had
[59:11] confidence in him and was looking for
[59:13] him to take the driver's seat now he
[59:15] wanted to sit back and just I want to
[59:17] see what you're going to do now and
[59:18] Moses was crying out
[59:20] right and uh uh because it came down to
[59:24] a time of David when David had went
[59:27] before Goliath uh when he fought Goliath
[59:30] he didn't say a
[59:32] prayer he had so much confidence in God
[59:35] and what God had done before that he
[59:37] said you know what this is nothing right
[59:40] this is we I am able uh uh to overcome
[59:43] uh and have a victory in this and I like
[59:46] that because it shows the maturity of
[59:48] the word in the Old Testament of Moses
[59:51] time crying then we got David just going
[59:55] and speaking how how much more should we
[59:57] be in our time with the word that we
[59:59] have David didn't have the fullness of
[1:00:02] the word that has been revealed to
[1:00:04] us right David didn't have the fullness
[1:00:07] of the word uh uh that we have right but
[1:00:11] I but I like how that uh the word is
[1:00:13] maturing because what what's happening
[1:00:16] is God's confidence in US is growing the
[1:00:20] more he begins to reveal his word and
[1:00:23] the more he begins to reveal his word to
[1:00:24] you it shows he's confident with you and
[1:00:28] his word just as he was with Adam in the
[1:00:30] back of the garden right so when Adam
[1:00:33] and Eve left a garden they didn't like I
[1:00:36] said they didn't lose power but over
[1:00:38] time they lost their revelation of what
[1:00:40] the word the fullness of the word was
[1:00:43] and now in this day and age as we have a
[1:00:45] prophet that's begin to open up the uh
[1:00:47] open up the Bible to us now I want you
[1:00:49] to understand that it's already been
[1:00:51] open but individually we're all being
[1:00:54] revealed certain things
[1:00:56] right in our own walks the the Bible
[1:00:58] says that uh Paul Paul planteth Apollo
[1:01:02] Apollo wat but it's God that brings
[1:01:04] increase so you can only see as much of
[1:01:08] God as he allows you and a lot of times
[1:01:11] he's trying to see you be more
[1:01:13] responsible with what you have currently
[1:01:16] before he gives you more right because
[1:01:18] if he gives you more word and you not
[1:01:21] have you don't have the responsibility
[1:01:23] or you don't have the life behind it to
[1:01:25] back it uh you're no different from Adam
[1:01:27] and if if Adam if God kicked Adam and
[1:01:30] Eve out of the garden even though they
[1:01:33] had ability to get the tree of life he's
[1:01:35] going to he's going to uh uh keep
[1:01:37] himself back from us as long as we're
[1:01:39] not also maturing and in that same state
[1:01:42] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:01:43] and forever all
[1:01:45] right uh another example uh uh uh that's
[1:01:48] in the Bible uh is when Elijah cursed
[1:01:50] the children and killed the Bears
[1:01:52] because they had made uh they had mocked
[1:01:54] him they said uh thou B had go up right
[1:01:57] they had mocked him and that caused an
[1:01:59] emotion inside of Elijah to cause him to
[1:02:02] curse those Bears now we have Revelation
[1:02:05] in this day children yeah CH the
[1:02:06] children now we have Revelation in this
[1:02:08] day that the prophet said he was wrong
[1:02:11] for
[1:02:12] that he had
[1:02:15] power right he had power but that wasn't
[1:02:18] a responsible decision with the power he
[1:02:21] was given that wasn't a responsible
[1:02:23] choice though God was with him right he
[1:02:26] had power because now we see brother
[1:02:28] brandom and I believe it was one time he
[1:02:30] was having a service and some people
[1:02:32] were disrespecting in the service and it
[1:02:35] came to him well what are you going to
[1:02:37] do about it I forgive him right so now
[1:02:40] you see the maturity right the power
[1:02:42] that has been given with him but the
[1:02:44] prophet stood back and said you know
[1:02:46] what I forgive him right even though he
[1:02:48] had power to do something in that
[1:02:50] situation I believe that caused God to
[1:02:52] crack a smile right I believe that
[1:02:55] caused God to crack his smouth to see
[1:02:57] him handle the word the right way with
[1:03:00] responsibility it's not always about
[1:03:02] power and most of the time you realize
[1:03:04] that and that's why I say the
[1:03:06] responsibility and power uh uh it's it's
[1:03:09] more power in the responsibility that's
[1:03:11] the more bigger part because then the
[1:03:14] power just comes naturally just like it
[1:03:16] was in the garden all right am so we
[1:03:19] want to also look at the children of
[1:03:21] Israel uh that were stuck in the
[1:03:23] wilderness now Moses was the voice of
[1:03:26] God to the people right in that
[1:03:28] situation with Miriam and Aaron when
[1:03:31] they had talked about his wife and God
[1:03:32] had came to them and said I talk to
[1:03:34] Moses mouth to ear and then I use him to
[1:03:37] talk to you go Mo so Moses represented
[1:03:40] the voice of God uh uh to the people and
[1:03:43] and there was a time where Moses went
[1:03:45] off to go write the Ten Commandments and
[1:03:47] we're going to read a little bit from
[1:03:48] Exodus
[1:03:50] 321 to see exactly what happened
[1:03:57] and it reads and when the people saw
[1:03:58] that Moses delayed to come down out of
[1:04:00] the mount the people gathered themselves
[1:04:03] together unto Aaron and said unto him up
[1:04:05] make us Gods which shall go before us
[1:04:08] for as this Moses did the man that has
[1:04:11] brought us up out of the land of Egypt
[1:04:12] we W what we W not what is become of him
[1:04:15] now I want you to realize it says when
[1:04:17] the people saw Moses delayed to come
[1:04:20] Moses was the voice of God so they
[1:04:23] weren't doing this to Moses
[1:04:26] this is what they were doing to God
[1:04:28] right this is what they were this is how
[1:04:30] they were treating
[1:04:32] god um and then of course it says you
[1:04:34] know they uh they created a god of of
[1:04:38] themselves verse four it says these be
[1:04:40] thy Gods oh Israel which brought thee
[1:04:42] out of the land of Egypt uh and we're
[1:04:44] going to go down to verse um six it says
[1:04:48] and they rose up early on the mo marrow
[1:04:50] and offered burnt offerings and brought
[1:04:52] peace offerings and the people sat down
[1:04:54] to eat and drink and Rose up to play so
[1:04:56] they were living in sin right and the
[1:04:59] Lord said unto Moses go thee down for
[1:05:02] thy people which thou broughtest out the
[1:05:03] land of Egypt have corrupted themselves
[1:05:06] so God was still seeing how they were
[1:05:09] acting and the Bible says that God
[1:05:11] brought him into the Wilderness to be
[1:05:14] tempted which means he was giving them
[1:05:17] responsibility and when it says that the
[1:05:19] voice Moses which was the voice of God
[1:05:21] had came back God wanted to see their
[1:05:23] reactions so when the voice of God
[1:05:26] wasn't there cuz a lot of times you have
[1:05:28] people that come to
[1:05:29] church dress up sing play instruments
[1:05:34] right but when it comes to the voice
[1:05:36] that they feel like the voice of God is
[1:05:37] not there at work the decisions the
[1:05:40] actions that they make God has the same
[1:05:42] exact response to that when God wants a
[1:05:45] Christian he wants you to be a Christian
[1:05:47] 100% of the time it's not a Sunday it's
[1:05:51] not a Wednesday it's not a youth service
[1:05:53] God is looking for responsible
[1:05:55] Christians 100% of the time God is
[1:05:58] looking for some people that are going
[1:05:59] to live the life 100% knowing that God
[1:06:02] is always there right because the Bible
[1:06:05] said that God was still looking at him
[1:06:07] when he talked to Moses God was still
[1:06:10] looking at
[1:06:12] him all right and um and I wanted to um
[1:06:18] cuz in this
[1:06:20] situation uh and in verse uh 14 um cuz
[1:06:25] God had told Moses that his anger was
[1:06:27] wroth against them and how he wanted to
[1:06:30] he wanted to deal with these people and
[1:06:33] it was Moses was the one that reminded
[1:06:36] him that you made a promise to these
[1:06:38] people right you're the one that made a
[1:06:41] promise to the people uh uh and your
[1:06:43] word can't fail and the Bible says and
[1:06:45] the Lord repented of the evil which he
[1:06:48] thought to do unto his people and I like
[1:06:51] that because it shows you uh a little
[1:06:54] bit of level of responsib ability Moses
[1:06:56] had in in in talking with God like no
[1:07:00] God these people no Lord you made a
[1:07:02] promise to them I know that you're
[1:07:04] because Moses had a temper right Moses
[1:07:06] had a temper problem right and God he's
[1:07:09] like no God God no you Lord you promised
[1:07:12] these people right Lord you made a word
[1:07:14] to them Lord you promised that you would
[1:07:16] take them to the land that you inherited
[1:07:18] them so it I believe it I believe in
[1:07:21] that moment God could feel proud because
[1:07:24] Moses could say something that he was
[1:07:26] already thinking in his mind right and
[1:07:29] it kind of um and it kind of showed cuz
[1:07:31] I have a situation where you know I was
[1:07:34] really upset with people at my job um
[1:07:38] and I mean I was just thoughts just
[1:07:40] racing in your head right
[1:07:46] just man where did y'all come
[1:07:51] from
[1:07:53] what what in the you know thoughts just
[1:07:56] going through your head and I remember
[1:07:58] that uh uh um as I as I began to walk
[1:08:00] out the workplace uh of Bible verse
[1:08:03] which is why you read your Bible it's
[1:08:05] why you pray every day a Bible verse
[1:08:06] that came to me and said be angry but
[1:08:08] sin not so God is looking for you to be
[1:08:13] responsible God is because you don't
[1:08:15] know you don't know who you're dealing
[1:08:17] with you don't know who which one of
[1:08:19] those co-workers you say they're lazy
[1:08:21] now but the the problem is this is one
[1:08:24] of the biggest problems that we have
[1:08:26] cuz I play basketball with some of the
[1:08:27] brothers from church and I play them
[1:08:29] oneone right and I ain't trying to be
[1:08:33] I'm trying to be
[1:08:34] humble I'll be
[1:08:37] winning you know I'll be winning I'm
[1:08:40] trying to be humble no but but it's it's
[1:08:45] it's it's an analogy out of that because
[1:08:46] we'll play because they'll tell me you
[1:08:48] know let's play another game let's play
[1:08:50] another game and I realize they waiting
[1:08:52] for me to get tired so that I'm at my
[1:08:54] weakest so that they can beat me right
[1:08:58] and it's an analogy because a lot of
[1:08:59] times we like to judge people at their
[1:09:01] weakest we like to determine who people
[1:09:04] are when they're at their weakest but
[1:09:06] let God take a hold of them right let
[1:09:09] God take a hold of one of those
[1:09:10] employees let God come into their life
[1:09:12] and fill them uh with Bible verses of of
[1:09:15] work ethic and uh uh love for him and
[1:09:18] representing him and they'll turn into
[1:09:20] the best employees just like that right
[1:09:22] but it takes people it takes people our
[1:09:25] position that know the word to put up
[1:09:28] with it to show that you know what it's
[1:09:30] whatever I I'm still here for you what
[1:09:33] can I get you for
[1:09:34] lunch what can I get you for lunch how
[1:09:37] can I help you out because you're now
[1:09:39] showing the love of Christ you're giving
[1:09:42] them something that they could want
[1:09:45] right so God brought them through the
[1:09:48] Wilderness to try them and uh it's it's
[1:09:50] a um it it was a trying time and
[1:09:54] sometimes it's good and this is in
[1:09:55] closing sometimes it's good to take
[1:09:57] inventory you know when you're in
[1:10:00] situations that are not uh uh uh not
[1:10:04] pleasant right you know when you're sick
[1:10:06] you know it's good to take inventory you
[1:10:08] know to ask you know Lord if you heal me
[1:10:11] this is what I do to serve you right you
[1:10:14] know the these are responsible ways to
[1:10:16] handle situation Lord if you bless me
[1:10:18] this is what I'm going to do right if we
[1:10:21] go to Mark 10 uh 40 uh 10:46 to
[1:10:28] 52 we're going to read a
[1:10:31] story of a man that God
[1:10:34] healed and it says they came to Jericho
[1:10:37] and as he went out to Jericho with his
[1:10:39] disciples and a great number of people
[1:10:40] blind barus the son of tus Sat by the
[1:10:43] highway begging and when he heard it was
[1:10:45] Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry out
[1:10:47] and say Jesus thou son of David have
[1:10:49] mercy on me and many charged him that he
[1:10:53] should hold his peace now
[1:10:56] God could have just went over there and
[1:10:57] said no no y'all not going to just talk
[1:10:59] to him like this he's speaking to me but
[1:11:01] a lot of times God wants to see your
[1:11:03] reactions when you're in diverse
[1:11:05] situations when you're in when you're in
[1:11:07] situations where you feel like his
[1:11:09] presence is not there God still wants to
[1:11:12] see what your reaction is uh in spite of
[1:11:15] that right and it says that when they
[1:11:18] told him to hold his peace it says he
[1:11:20] cried the more a great deal thou son of
[1:11:23] David have mercy on me and Jesus Stood
[1:11:25] Still and commanded him to be called and
[1:11:27] they called the blind man saying unto
[1:11:28] him be of good Comfort arise he calleth
[1:11:31] thee and he casting away His Garment
[1:11:33] Rose and came to Jesus Jesus answered
[1:11:35] and said to him What wilt thou I should
[1:11:36] do unto thee the blind man said unto him
[1:11:39] Lord that I might receive my sight and
[1:11:41] Jesus said go thy way thy faith has made
[1:11:44] thee whole and the Beautiful part about
[1:11:46] this is and immediately he received his
[1:11:49] sight and followed Jesus in the way
[1:11:53] right so not just being healed not just
[1:11:56] asking God can I heal me and then go
[1:11:59] back out into the world right that shows
[1:12:01] that there's not really a responsibility
[1:12:03] with power right there right God wants
[1:12:05] you to when when God heals you when God
[1:12:07] gives you the power to have faith to be
[1:12:09] healed he wants you to be uh uh he wants
[1:12:11] it uh uh used in a responsible way hey
[1:12:13] Lord if you heal me if you make me
[1:12:15] better I'm going to serve you even more
[1:12:17] right um I'm going to I'm going to uh
[1:12:20] I'm going to uh do what you tell me to
[1:12:21] do Lord I want to I want to give more
[1:12:23] Lord if if you give me another job Lord
[1:12:25] I want to be able to uh bless more
[1:12:27] people I want to be able to do more for
[1:12:29] your kingdom right God's looking for
[1:12:31] those things God can give you whatever
[1:12:33] you want right but he wants to know that
[1:12:37] you're responsible and you're going to
[1:12:39] responsible thing uh thing to it right
[1:12:42] and so in it there's a concept called
[1:12:45] stress
[1:12:46] testing and it's when people put a
[1:12:49] system under stress on purpose to see
[1:12:53] how much it can handle and that's what
[1:12:55] God allows for us cuz God wants us to
[1:12:58] see us make the responsible choice right
[1:13:01] and so a lot of times your parents may
[1:13:04] put you in situations where you feel
[1:13:06] like man they just loaded in on me they
[1:13:09] want to see how much you can handle they
[1:13:10] want to know what you can handle what
[1:13:12] you not can handle now it a lot of the
[1:13:15] times because God knows the Bible says
[1:13:18] God knows what you can handle and what
[1:13:19] you can't handle so it's not for him
[1:13:22] it's for you to take inventory of where
[1:13:24] you're at
[1:13:25] when you say you got patience God's like
[1:13:27] okay you got patience all
[1:13:29] right give you some co-workers uh uh all
[1:13:33] a sudden your all of a sudden your all
[1:13:34] of a sudden your kid starts acting a
[1:13:36] certain way you don't know where this
[1:13:37] came from and then you explode and God's
[1:13:41] like you had patience I thought you said
[1:13:43] you had patience it's to take inventory
[1:13:46] Lord I need help in this area God
[1:13:48] already knows where you need help from
[1:13:50] but you have to ask him first you have
[1:13:53] to ask him to help you in that amen
[1:13:55] right and it's no different just as uh
[1:13:57] uh as uh um kids to your parents ask
[1:14:00] your parents for help you can ask your
[1:14:02] parents for help in areas uh that you're
[1:14:04] struggling with but a lot of times even
[1:14:07] as adults we tend to hold these things
[1:14:09] on the inside not admit them to God like
[1:14:11] God you know my temper is just not where
[1:14:13] it needs to be a lot of times we try to
[1:14:15] handle it ourselves because we think
[1:14:17] that uh we we think we know better or we
[1:14:20] think that we can do good but sometimes
[1:14:22] you have to kind of let those things uh
[1:14:24] let those things go
[1:14:25] let God help you let your parents help
[1:14:27] you right because they want to see that
[1:14:31] responsibility built up inside of you
[1:14:33] because they know that once you receive
[1:14:36] responsibility they can send you in any
[1:14:38] position they can give you anything
[1:14:40] brother brandom said God's looking to
[1:14:42] bless people but the problem is when he
[1:14:44] blesses people they go up but God's
[1:14:47] looking for someone that when they bless
[1:14:48] them they go down when they bless them
[1:14:51] more they go down when you bless them
[1:14:53] more they go down and down and down and
[1:14:55] down then God knows that this person can
[1:14:58] handle it because it's all in us the
[1:15:00] Bible says we're born and shaped and sin
[1:15:02] and iniquity we all have the same issues
[1:15:05] it was it was a it was a revelation
[1:15:07] point to me when I heard that character
[1:15:09] was not a gift right when you become a
[1:15:13] Christian you're not automatically just
[1:15:15] faith and joy and love and patience and
[1:15:19] you don't automat that stuff just it is
[1:15:21] automatically there for you to access
[1:15:23] but character is choosing to access it
[1:15:27] right you don't manufacture your own
[1:15:28] faith and your joy you have it when you
[1:15:29] receive the baptism the Holy Spirit but
[1:15:31] you're choosing to yield to it when
[1:15:34] situations come and that's where the
[1:15:36] character peace comes right so we're
[1:15:39] going to uh end this in
[1:15:43] prayer Lord Jesus Lord your word has
[1:15:47] been spoken oh Lord God lord we we're so
[1:15:51] thankful Lord God that we live in a time
[1:15:53] oh Lord God that you can reveal these
[1:15:57] things to us oh Lord God and especially
[1:16:00] at a age oh Lord God with this being a
[1:16:02] youth service oh Lord God and a lot of
[1:16:05] the younger ones oh Lord God are now
[1:16:07] becoming older they're becoming
[1:16:09] teenagers oh Lord God they're starting
[1:16:11] to think oh Lord God they're starting to
[1:16:13] form their own opinions they're starting
[1:16:15] they're starting to get feelings oh Lord
[1:16:16] God they're starting to experience
[1:16:18] things in life oh Lord God they're at a
[1:16:20] critical age oh Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:23] they're at a critical age and they need
[1:16:24] need more of you oh Lord God even though
[1:16:27] they may not realize it oh Lord Jesus
[1:16:29] Christ but Lord we just want to pray oh
[1:16:31] Lord God we ask that your blessing be
[1:16:34] upon them oh Lord Jesus Christ we ask
[1:16:36] that your wisdom would be upon them oh
[1:16:38] Lord God we ask that you would anoint
[1:16:41] the parents oh Lord God anoint the
[1:16:43] preaching anoint the all the all the
[1:16:45] people that they look up to from the
[1:16:47] church oh Lord God to to the family
[1:16:49] members Lord we ask that you anoint them
[1:16:51] oh Lord to live a life oh Lord Jesus
[1:16:54] Christ because that's what they remember
[1:16:56] oh Lord God they remember how they were
[1:16:58] treated they remember what they heard so
[1:17:01] that when they're in a situation oh Lord
[1:17:03] where they may not be uh uh um things
[1:17:06] may not be uh uh well in their life oh
[1:17:09] Lord Jesus Christ Lord you never promise
[1:17:11] a road of ease oh Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:17:13] some people go through great trials oh
[1:17:16] Lord God oh Lord we ask oh Lord God that
[1:17:19] you would touch them and anoint them oh
[1:17:21] Lord and help them in that time oh Lord
[1:17:23] God if any of them are listening oh Lord
[1:17:25] God oh Lord let your love wrap around
[1:17:28] their hearts oh Lord God to know that
[1:17:30] you want them more then they actually
[1:17:33] want you oh Lord Jesus Christ you want
[1:17:36] to see them more oh Lord you want to
[1:17:38] forgive them you want to love them when
[1:17:39] the prodical son came home his father
[1:17:42] wrapped him in the finest linen and gave
[1:17:44] him a gold ring and killed the uh the
[1:17:47] fattest lamb or cow Lord God he gave him
[1:17:50] the best even though he didn't deserve
[1:17:52] it oh Lord God let it sink in our hearts
[1:17:54] oh Lord God that you don't give us what
[1:17:56] we deserve but we still belong to you
[1:17:59] and you love us oh Lord God guide each
[1:18:01] one of the youth oh Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:04] help them make the right decisions oh
[1:18:05] Lord Jesus Christ help give them wisdom
[1:18:08] oh Lord God in a generation where Lord
[1:18:11] it seems that the kids are getting wiser
[1:18:13] oh Lord God but they're still making the
[1:18:16] wrong decisions oh Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:18] Lord give them an anchor oh Lord God
[1:18:21] that they may navigate through these
[1:18:22] Waters oh lord it's getting so confused
[1:18:24] using oh Lord Jesus Christ Lord It's
[1:18:27] hard to tell the difference between men
[1:18:28] and women sometimes oh Lord and they're
[1:18:30] going to need something to know right
[1:18:32] from wrong and discern and not only to
[1:18:35] discern oh Lord God but give them
[1:18:37] strength to stand on the truth they may
[1:18:40] be the only ones oh Lord Jesus Christ oh
[1:18:43] Lord but you showed Moses and Aaron all
[1:18:46] all all they needed was just one rod
[1:18:48] that was an original word in the midst
[1:18:50] of many and they could swallow them all
[1:18:52] up oh Lord God make them courageous oh
[1:18:55] Lord God make them champions for you
[1:18:57] Lord and we ask it in the precious name
[1:18:59] of Jesus Christ
[1:19:03] [Applause]

[1:19:18] Lord um certainly appreciate uh brother
[1:19:23] Quinton on tonight
[1:19:25] and um I I have to say I don't think I
[1:19:29] ever heard a sermon on the power of
[1:19:34] responsibility and um just seems like a
[1:19:37] a very very um appropriate sermon uh for
[1:19:42] uh not only for our young people but
[1:19:43] even for us amen Caleb's in the room but
[1:19:48] uh that was just that was full of
[1:19:50] nutrients amen full of nutrients and I
[1:19:53] trust that we'll all just
[1:19:55] um um take heed you know to what was
[1:20:00] being shared and um natural always typed
[1:20:04] to spiritual and you know as he was just
[1:20:07] kind of talking about how as the kids
[1:20:09] kind of grow up um you you expect more
