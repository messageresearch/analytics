[15:30] you
[15:31] and i've been hearing some really
[15:32] positive testimonies lately of just
[15:34] young people getting mighty deliverances
[15:36] in some of these youth camps sometimes
[15:38] it's much easier for them to worship
[15:40] when they're amongst their peers
[15:42] amen than just being with with parents
[15:44] so i want to encourage the parents let's
[15:46] try to get our young people involved uh
[15:49] the next generation we want them to have
[15:50] a true experience with god and we want
[15:53] to put them in atmospheres where they
[15:54] can have that experience with god so

[21:24] precious pastor brother jack duff a lot
[21:27] of saints that i've seen
[21:29] tinashe and his wife
[21:31] long time god bless you my precious
[21:33] brother back there
[21:35] ah brother simba as well
[21:37] oh my my sister's there
[21:41] the only thing i can say is i love you
[21:44] amen that will explain everything
[21:47] my but i don't even know where to start
[21:49] from
[21:51] maybe i might start to give you just a
[21:53] little bit of a background
[21:55] it's my first time to be in this country
[21:58] but in 2001 when i was still joining in
[22:01] zimbabwe
[22:02] i got a visa for 10 years to come here
[22:06] together with my wife and my
[22:09] four children
[22:11] but i never used them
[22:13] they got to expire in 2010
[22:16] and never step my foot in this country
[22:20] i just think god has got an appointed
[22:22] time
[22:23] for everybody amen i should have been
[22:26] here long back
[22:27] maybe with the same action that you have
[22:35] but however i believe you're going to
[22:37] understand my accent
[22:38] my one is mixed with a bit of african
[22:41] background
[22:42] and a bit of british accent all right
[22:46] i like it that way
[22:48] although i'm not a crossbreed
[22:51] hallelujah amen
[22:54] um
[22:57] i love the song that project deck was
[22:59] actually singing
[23:01] it really took me back as if i was back
[23:04] into the garden of eden
[23:06] yes
[23:07] those such are the songs
[23:09] that possibly esteems me
[23:11] and they take me
[23:13] to a certain level
[23:16] but however without wasting much for
[23:18] your time
[23:19] i would like us to first of all open by
[23:22] a word of prayer amen if we can
[23:25] close our eyes
[23:28] precious lord
[23:31] eternal in the heavens
[23:34] we give you glory this day
[23:36] we appreciate you
[23:39] father you saw it fit
[23:41] for this day
[23:43] to be what it is by your grace
[23:47] lord god almighty i'm not somebody who
[23:49] is important
[23:51] but father i'm just like my fellow
[23:53] brothers and sisters in here
[23:56] i take this opportunity to belittle

[32:26] and i thought let me just provoke this
[32:28] with this little message that i have
[32:31] maybe somebody might start to jump and

[32:50] me my mountain

[32:54] my brother your mountain is a potion to
[32:56] you
[32:57] my one is a portion to me
[32:59] there's no way i'm going to take real
[33:01] mountain
[33:02] it is your responsibility to tackle your
[33:04] mountain
[33:05] and god will see us through
[33:07] because he has fully equipped us with
[33:10] every gadget
[33:11] with every power
[33:13] hallelujah to tackle our mountains and
[33:16] there's no reason
[33:18] at the end of this service for somebody
[33:20] to say i haven't finished my mountain we
[33:24] should all say our mountains are done
[33:26] and done
[33:28] hallelujah
[33:29] praise be to god
[33:31] this is the place
[33:33] where we get everything
[33:35] this is the source of our inspiration
[33:38] i'm a believer of the faithful ministry
[33:40] this is the place
[33:42] where we come
[33:43] and suck
[33:45] and suck until we are full
[33:48] hallelujah this is where the source of
[33:51] our power is
[33:53] oh praise be to god
[33:55] let me ask you tonight
[33:57] don't go out
[33:59] the way you came in
[34:01] there has to be a time of transformation
[34:04] there has to be a time time of
[34:05] transformation
[34:07] i am saying
[34:08] don't go out
[34:10] the same way you came in
[34:12] there has to be a change
[34:14] the prophet told us
[34:16] you get according hallelujah
[34:20] you get according
[34:22] to expectation
[34:24] praise be to god
[34:26] i have titled my little message
[34:29] the influence of the spoken word
[34:34] we have not believed this message for
[34:36] not my brother my sister
[34:38] this message is rich
[34:40] this message has got influence
[34:43] this message once you get the influence
[34:45] of the message
[34:46] then you are a soldier of god
[34:49] you are ready to go out and fight the
[34:51] enemy
[34:52] hallelujah the influence of the spoken
[34:55] word
[34:56] sometimes we take these words for
[35:01] we take them for granted
[35:03] when i take my bible and read it
[35:05] i take my time to read
[35:09] from where the coma is
[35:11] where the
[35:12] full stop is
[35:13] where these some of these words are so i
[35:16] took the liberty this afternoon to say
[35:18] let me just search for the meaning of
[35:21] influence
[35:22] and the the meaning of influence from
[35:24] the english dictionary it says
[35:26] it is the capacity
[35:28] to have an effect on the character
[35:33] development
[35:34] or behavior of someone
[35:36] or something
[35:38] or the effect itself
[35:42] the capacity to have an effect
[35:45] that's influence
[35:48] we are influenced by the word of god
[35:51] that's why we are gathered here
[35:53] we are eagles
[35:55] we have come to feast
[35:57] on our daily fresh care
[36:00] there's been an influence behind
[36:02] to say to each and everyone it's time to
[36:05] go to church
[36:06] when i was coming from my hotel we got
[36:08] into a lift
[36:09] a certain white man jumped in and he
[36:12] said it's today wednesday i said yes he
[36:15] looked at my bible and he nodded
[36:18] then are you
[36:19] he knew this man
[36:21] is going to the source of power to go
[36:24] and sup
[36:25] and i was going to stop and have come to
[36:27] sap
[36:28] hallelujah
[36:30] there's something that echoed because
[36:32] when i was holding my bible i was
[36:34] treasuring it i was holding it like the
[36:38] like the the blood of jesus christ i
[36:40] didn't want no blood to be to drop on
[36:43] the floor i said i'll take all the
[36:45] liberty to hold my bible so reverently
[36:49] because i know what is contained in this
[36:51] bible is more than an atomic power
[36:54] this is where my atomic power is
[36:57] and i want to say to you tonight you're
[36:59] an atomic power as you're seated there
[37:02] there's no big or small and anything
[37:05] that can come to you that you can never
[37:06] tackle god has fully equipped you with
[37:10] every power to tackle everything that
[37:12] comes your way
[37:13] don't look down upon yourself my brother
[37:16] you are more than in atomic power
[37:19] hallelujah if all the nations
[37:22] want to know what an atomic power is
[37:24] they should not even go to their armory
[37:27] they must look for you to say what is
[37:29] the belief of the message of the hour
[37:31] he is the one she is the one with the
[37:34] answer to everything hallelujah not all
[37:38] these hydrogen bombs that they are
[37:40] making the atomic power lies into your
[37:43] hands
[37:44] now you've got the capacity to speak
[37:47] things into existence to speak things
[37:49] out of existence because then
[37:52] god gave you the power and this house is
[37:56] full of atomic power
[37:58] praise be to god
[38:00] hallelujah
[38:02] hallelujah don't mind my brother my
[38:05] sister even if they call you with names
[38:07] out there they'll come one time when you
[38:10] realize the power that is invested upon
[38:13] you then you can just speak the word in
[38:16] action and everything will be swept away
[38:19] hallelujah
[38:21] lord and behold
[38:22] we have power
[38:24] to create our own world
[38:27] but it is not right the right time right
[38:29] now because if you are going to create
[38:31] your own world you then escape
[38:33] and the rapture will take time
[38:36] hallelujah so hold your peace
[38:39] glory be to god
[38:41] glory be to god
[38:44] hallelujah
[38:47] we have read
[38:50] from the scripture
[38:52] they were gathered outside
[38:55] the four lepers yes
[38:57] talking to themselves
[39:00] what shall we do
[39:02] death is surrounding us
[39:04] hallelujah
[39:06] remember my brother my sister
[39:09] these four leprous people
[39:12] god took time
[39:14] to write about them
[39:16] but when you look into the whole country
[39:20] there were so many other leprous people
[39:22] but to god they were not important
[39:25] but these ones
[39:27] were important
[39:28] they were handpicked by god
[39:30] as much as you are my brother my sister
[39:33] out of the millions and trillions of
[39:34] people god took his spiritual binoculars
[39:38] and he started to survey and he said
[39:40] whom shall i pick whom shall i pick
[39:43] amongst these children and he picked you
[39:45] my brother he picked you my brother he
[39:48] picked you my sister he picked you my
[39:50] little brother and he knows
[39:52] that in this age hallelujah in this age
[39:56] you are more than capable to meet up
[39:59] with the challenges of this day
[40:01] because the gadget in you is greater
[40:04] than the gadget that is in the world
[40:06] hallelujah
[40:08] they were not the only leprous people
[40:10] around
[40:12] but these ones got in the plan
[40:14] and it was necessary for him
[40:17] to say i want to talk about these people
[40:20] because they've got a special place upon
[40:22] my heart hallelujah
[40:26] hallelujah
[40:27] hallelujah
[40:28] hallelujah
[40:30] let's go to my first quotation
[40:33] the hour has come
[40:36] the time comes when you have to stand on
[40:38] god's word
[40:40] stand alone
[40:42] hallelujah but when that time comes
[40:45] stand there
[40:47] each one has been approaching their time
[40:48] by god
[40:50] and you are being encouraged and urged
[40:52] by the prophet that the time will come
[40:54] when you have to stand on god's word
[40:57] you are not going to rely on your
[40:58] sister's
[41:00] help nor your brother's help there will
[41:02] come a time a perilous time as the bible
[41:06] records
[41:07] that those times are coming but we are
[41:10] saying
[41:11] hallelujah the time when you have to
[41:13] stand on you god's word is gonna come
[41:15] and when it comes my brother don't miss
[41:18] your portion stand alone
[41:21] but when that time comes stand there
[41:24] regardless as much as these leprous
[41:27] people did it was their time to stand
[41:31] alone
[41:32] outside the camber remember the prophet
[41:35] elijah he had to pronounce a spoken word
[41:39] hallelujah when he announced that spoken
[41:41] word these leprous people were not there
[41:44] hallelujah the leprous people were not
[41:46] there but they were influenced
[41:49] by the power of the spoken word by a
[41:52] prophet
[41:53] let me tell you children you might go
[41:56] astray but if you've got a father and a
[41:59] mother who are spiritual if they knew
[42:02] down and pray and say lord
[42:05] may you meet up with my son may you meet
[42:08] up with my child wherever he is
[42:11] condemnation will strike you there and
[42:13] there
[42:14] hallelujah
[42:16] hallelujah
[42:17] condemnation will strike you wherever
[42:19] you are
[42:20] even if you are in the middle of
[42:22] drinking beer
[42:24] hallelujah
[42:25] even if you are in the middle of dancing
[42:28] saying to all your other colleagues
[42:30] check this dancer which i'm doing check
[42:33] this one
[42:34] during that process my brother my sister
[42:37] when your mom
[42:39] or your dad
[42:40] raises up their hands
[42:42] and say lord
[42:44] lord
[42:46] hear my prayer
[42:48] especially you mothers
[42:50] you have got the most powerful
[42:52] most powerful voice that god is ready to
[42:56] listen to you and he is saying use those
[42:59] lips of clay
[43:00] speak to me
[43:02] i want to hear
[43:04] what he has upon your heart sir
[43:06] hallelujah
[43:07] oh praise be to god
[43:10] praise be to god
[43:13] when we the parents pray for you
[43:16] my brother sister
[43:18] god will intervene
[43:21] god will hear
[43:23] he knows
[43:25] he knows
[43:27] remember the prophet
[43:29] he said to your son
[43:31] billy
[43:33] you can do whatsoever you want
[43:35] but i've done the job already
[43:38] go astray
[43:39] you'll meet up with my god
[43:42] hallelujah and for sure he met with the
[43:44] god of the prophets
[43:46] hallelujah
[43:48] obedience is better than sacrifice
[43:51] all praise be to god
[43:53] not only to your parents
[43:55] even to your pastors because they are
[43:58] ordained shepherds
[44:00] to lead you to that glory length
[44:03] hallelujah
[44:05] praise be to god
[44:08] oh my god oh my
[44:11] oh my
[44:12] but when that time comes and
[44:14] that times comes stand there there's got
[44:17] to be a time when you've got to separate
[44:19] yourself
[44:20] between your feelings and your faith

[44:54] tonight

[54:20] hallelujah
[54:21] hallelujah if you ask yourself
[54:25] just when you're sitting down have you
[54:27] asked yourself why this message is so
[54:29] important to you
[54:32] you know these are some of the questions
[54:33] that we just overlook
[54:35] this message is so important my brother
[54:38] my sister i'll give you a little
[54:40] testimony
[54:41] which happened back home in zimbabwe
[54:44] they you know because of the housing
[54:46] situation
[54:47] some people would not afford to buy
[54:49] their own house
[54:50] so what they'll do is they'll go to a
[54:52] certain house and they'll ask the owner
[54:54] can i just rent this room
[54:56] and they'll say okay it will be about
[54:58] fifty dollars a month then say okay
[55:00] we'll be able to pay
[55:02] but that
[55:04] tenant
[55:06] was doing very well despite this fact
[55:09] that he had no
[55:10] no yet in his own home
[55:13] he was doing very well
[55:15] so what did what he did was
[55:17] every time
[55:18] in the kitchen there was the smell of
[55:20] meat
[55:21] the smell of god the smell of lamb the
[55:23] smell of beef fish and this really got
[55:27] to the names of the owner of the house
[55:28] saying this man is always eating with
[55:30] meat and i don't eat meat
[55:33] i'll
[55:34] devise a plan
[55:36] so what he did is he took
[55:38] a glass bottle
[55:40] he crushed it
[55:42] crushed it into small bits
[55:45] and he put it into the vegetables for
[55:47] this man
[55:49] the man hit
[55:52] slept
[55:53] the following morning he woke up
[55:55] nothing happened
[55:57] the man was just looking at him to say i
[55:59] think i will hear something inside there
[56:01] but he never had anything
[56:03] he started to wonder what's happening
[56:05] is my plan not working
[56:07] the following day he did the same thing
[56:10] this time a little bit bigger
[56:12] the glasses were left a little bit
[56:13] bigger so that they can actually cut the
[56:15] intestines as he ate
[56:17] the man who was given the vegetables
[56:19] he ate nothing happened
[56:22] the man did that for quite a long time
[56:25] until he said let me own up
[56:28] he went to the men and he said you know
[56:29] what
[56:31] i was so jealous about you
[56:33] and what i've been doing is i've been
[56:34] feeding you with crushed glasses so that
[56:36] you can get your intestines cut and they
[56:39] like but i don't know what's protecting
[56:41] you
[56:42] the man then turned to me said you know
[56:44] what it's not my ability
[56:46] it's the grace of god
[56:48] that man
[56:50] is into the faith right now because of
[56:52] what he was doing so what i'm saying my
[56:55] brother my sister
[56:57] in any situation that you go into
[57:00] god is always looking after you
[57:03] you don't know how many demons
[57:05] that we come across with out there
[57:08] how many demons that we brush our
[57:10] shoulders together with but god is
[57:12] always sparing us
[57:14] god is always sparing us
[57:16] so i urge you
[57:18] to think deeper about what this message
[57:21] has done to you it is actually
[57:23] transformed you to a new person
[57:26] to a person who can challenge any demons
[57:30] hallelujah
[57:31] hallelujah
[57:32] any demon can never stand before you
[57:35] because of this message

[57:46] tonight's message he's got something for
[57:49] you amen

[58:01] every time we say oh lord this oh lord
[58:03] this oh lord this
[58:05] but god is just looking
[58:07] and he's saying i'm waiting for you
[58:10] you want a job
[58:11] you get a piece of paper
[58:13] you put in an application
[58:15] when you put in an application then i
[58:17] can influence that whoever's going to
[58:20] touch and read it i can blind him and he
[58:22] can give you a job even if you don't
[58:25] have even any qualifications to match up
[58:27] with that job because i am god
[58:29] there's nothing nothing impossible
[58:32] before me
[58:33] the thing is we don't act let's act now
[58:37] and say lord

[58:40] we now have realized
[58:42] that we need to make a move we need to

[58:57] die but let's let's try our luck let's
[59:00] see if we are going to die and when they
[59:03] started to walk
[59:04] god magnified their footprints

[59:10] as they were walking
[59:12] when the enemies
[59:13] heard

[1:05:49] every type of food
[1:05:51] and they started to eat
[1:05:53] and they started to eat
[1:05:55] but because they were ordained of god
[1:05:58] then they said we cannot feed ourselves
[1:06:00] only
[1:06:02] let's go back to the camp
[1:06:04] yes they took us out of the camp but

[1:06:21] truth it is time for you to make a
[1:06:23] u-turn and say i've come with salvation
[1:06:26] to you people
[1:06:28] what did joseph do
[1:06:29] when he went to the land of egypt
[1:06:32] hallelujah when he was there
[1:06:35] he took his brothers
[1:06:37] and he said i know you sold me but it
[1:06:40] was not your fault
[1:06:43] it you were used of god
[1:06:46] it was don't blame yourself

[1:06:55] and i would give you food in plenties
[1:06:58] hallelujah little did i know my brother
[1:07:02] this is when pharaoh told joseph to go

[1:07:16] land
[1:07:17] where you are going to stay

[1:14:14] loaf of bread
[1:14:15] so they went and bought a loaf of bread
[1:14:18] when they the woman started to pray say
[1:14:20] lord i need a loaf of bread then the
[1:14:22] children took the loaf of bread and they
[1:14:23] threw it through the window when the
[1:14:25] woman opened the
[1:14:26] eyes she swell off a breath she says
[1:14:28] hallelujah praise god you are provided
[1:14:30] with with bread
[1:14:32] my brother my sister god can use your
[1:14:34] enemy
[1:14:36] you can ride your own enemy to fight it
[1:14:39] and once
[1:14:40] these boys were used by god to say go to
[1:14:43] the shops with your own money and buy
[1:14:46] this woman a loaf of bread
[1:14:49] they took it as a joke
[1:14:51] and they gave the woman a loaf of bread
[1:14:53] and the woman went to a table
[1:14:56] prepared a nice cup of tea
[1:14:59] with rich milk
[1:15:01] nice buttercup
[1:15:02] and jam
[1:15:04] and she started to enjoy
[1:15:07] my brother my sister whom do you think
[1:15:08] that is it is none other than god
[1:15:12] praise be to god
[1:15:14] i'm conscious of my time let's go on to
[1:15:15] my next life if you return he can't do
[1:15:18] no more his dad told you so so why don't
[1:15:21] you sit there till you die the only they
[1:15:24] only had one opportunity if they go down
[1:15:26] to the enemy's camp if they spare them
[1:15:29] they would they'll leave but if they
[1:15:31] killed them they were just going to die
[1:15:34] anyhow they was going to die sitting
[1:15:36] there so they was willing to take the
[1:15:38] chance
[1:15:40] why don't you take the chance this
[1:15:41] evening my brother
[1:15:44] take the chance of the impossibility
[1:15:47] and see the end of god in it
[1:15:49] hallelujah would call it a starvation
[1:15:52] committee there was already a salvation
[1:15:54] committee that was set up in syria
[1:15:57] to say this is the starvation committee
[1:15:59] this is going to look at possibly who is
[1:16:02] almost dying those who are still
[1:16:04] struggling they will say no no we are
[1:16:05] not going to consider these ones but
[1:16:07] let's consider those who are on the
[1:16:09] brink of dying that's why they actually
[1:16:12] set the commit
[1:16:13] to form that because it was death after
[1:16:16] death
[1:16:17] and the undertakers were no longer
[1:16:18] providing coffins they were just putting
[1:16:21] them in out
[1:16:22] in a trench and just burying them
[1:16:24] they said we need to set up a committee
[1:16:26] to cater for this
[1:16:28] so these ones these lepers were saying
[1:16:31] can we be put into a trench
[1:16:35] they said now
[1:16:36] let's brave ourselves
[1:16:40] they took a chance
[1:16:42] and they walked into the enemy's camp
[1:16:44] what can stop you tonight
[1:16:46] to walk into the enemy's camp
[1:16:49] if you're a child of god
[1:16:52] no matter what the apparent
[1:16:54] but because you're a child of god
[1:16:57] if you tell yourself i'm a child of god
[1:17:00] god will grant you whatsoever you want
[1:17:02] because you would have realized you are
[1:17:04] so much determined
[1:17:06] god god does not want people who are not
[1:17:09] determined
[1:17:10] he likes people who are determined if
[1:17:12] you are serious with god god becomes
[1:17:14] serious with you
[1:17:17] hallelujah let's go on my breath
[1:17:21] works is faith expressed
[1:17:23] then this story coming this afternoon
[1:17:25] about a man is probably here now that he
[1:17:28] was
[1:17:29] in the prayer line a year ago somewhere
[1:17:31] and he had said in the discernment was
[1:17:33] told that he had headed the mumps
[1:17:36] and the doctors told him after the moms
[1:17:38] felt that he could never have a baby
[1:17:40] girl
[1:17:41] my brother
[1:17:42] this man had boys
[1:17:45] but he wanted a baby girl
[1:17:50] hallelujah it's a desire
[1:17:54] maybe you don't have a child yourself to
[1:17:56] begin with
[1:17:59] you are not saying
[1:18:02] you are not making a choice
[1:18:04] you are saying lord just give me a child
[1:18:08] this is a challenge to you my brother my
[1:18:09] sister
[1:18:11] tonight this man
[1:18:14] he had boys
[1:18:15] only but he desired
[1:18:18] a baby girl
[1:18:22] because he had developed a disease of
[1:18:24] mums and the doctors i told him you know
[1:18:26] there's no chance of you having a baby
[1:18:28] anymore
[1:18:32] but when he realized he said i'm a man
[1:18:35] the bible says
[1:18:38] go out
[1:18:40] and do what
[1:18:45] hallelujah
[1:18:47] replenish
[1:18:49] go and replenish and you are saying
[1:18:52] me not going to be able to have a baby
[1:18:54] girl because i've developed this disease
[1:18:56] but lord
[1:18:58] if you once gave me baby boys
[1:19:01] what can stop you from being giving me
[1:19:03] baby girls
[1:19:07] and the doctors told him after the moms
[1:19:09] felt that he could never have a baby
[1:19:11] girl
[1:19:12] and he always wanted one
[1:19:14] if he ever desire
[1:19:16] my brother my sister
[1:19:19] you might have maybe pushed for years
[1:19:21] without a baby but let me tell you a
[1:19:24] prophet does not come easy
[1:19:27] a prophet does not come early
[1:19:31] samia
[1:19:32] that's right hallelujah he came after it
[1:19:35] some time
[1:19:37] but he became a prophet
[1:19:40] tonight
[1:19:42] if you zero your problem along that line
[1:19:46] god can provide you
[1:19:49] not tomorrow but today
[1:19:52] hallelujah
[1:19:55] the prophet is saying i think he had
[1:19:56] boys that's my assumptions as well
[1:19:59] because you just don't have to desire a
[1:20:01] baby girl when you don't even have a
[1:20:03] baby another baby other babies
[1:20:06] but in the vision from the lord he told
[1:20:08] him but we are going to have that girl
[1:20:11] baby
[1:20:12] despite the circumstances of mums
[1:20:16] if this man had doubted this let's go on
[1:20:18] my brother if this man had doubted this
[1:20:21] next slide
[1:20:22] and he said he's got the little girl
[1:20:24] here tonight
[1:20:26] this is the prophets announcing in a
[1:20:28] congregation
[1:20:29] that despite those moms and the
[1:20:32] and the the the what the doctors told
[1:20:34] you
[1:20:36] i i don't hate doctors
[1:20:38] they are urgents of god
[1:20:41] that's what we are told
[1:20:42] but they miss
[1:20:44] because they don't have the spiritual
[1:20:45] binoculars
[1:20:47] hallelujah and here
[1:20:49] the man went with the babe in church
[1:20:52] the baby girl
[1:20:54] against all odds
[1:20:56] then you tell me what type of a problem
[1:20:59] do you have yourself that god cannot
[1:21:02] solve if you can solve such a problem
[1:21:04] this is a magical situation
[1:21:07] [Music]
[1:21:08] hallelujah
[1:21:11] the prophet is saying
[1:21:13] i don't know the man might he will be in
[1:21:15] in the audience the person that i'm
[1:21:17] speaking of somewhere i don't know
[1:21:19] somebody just told me about it outside
[1:21:22] oh here's the baby hanging right back
[1:21:24] there
[1:21:25] hallelujah
[1:21:27] right there that's where the baby is
[1:21:31] that's fine
[1:21:33] that's very fine what a sweet little
[1:21:34] fellow
[1:21:36] it wasn't so far to walk over everybody
[1:21:39] it's a real cute little baby audrey if
[1:21:43] i'll ever come out here and give the
[1:21:44] testimony maybe she'll be sure by
[1:21:47] tomorrow or sometime when you are having
[1:21:49] our services
[1:21:52] my brother my
[1:21:54] sister the onus is in your hands
[1:21:59] the onus is in your hands
[1:22:01] if you have the right mental attitude
[1:22:03] toward god's word
[1:22:05] there's nothing that can stop god from
[1:22:07] granting you your desire
[1:22:10] we are talking about creation here
[1:22:13] of a baby girl
[1:22:15] there are so many
[1:22:17] so many sisters we have got baby boys

[1:44:43] start thinking this this this just
[1:44:45] temporary
[1:44:46] but i believe we had to be here and you
[1:44:48] had to preach that message
[1:44:51] here
[1:44:54] before you can preach where we're on our
[1:44:56] way to
[1:44:58] hallelujah you had to preach here before
[1:45:00] you could preach there
[1:45:02] and somewhere between here
[1:45:05] [Music]
[1:45:11] [Applause]
[1:45:18] somewhere between here and there
[1:45:21] i'm expecting god to move
[1:45:24] my god
[1:45:32] oh jesus
[1:45:35] i i i just
[1:45:37] i i would be doubting
[1:45:39] if i would have just left here and said
[1:45:41] nothing
[1:45:43] but i had to just release that
[1:45:46] the prayer has been prayed and
[1:45:49] man my faith is on the line that god's
