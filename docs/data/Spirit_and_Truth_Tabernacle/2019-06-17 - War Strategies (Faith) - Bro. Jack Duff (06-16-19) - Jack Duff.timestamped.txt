[29:05] now bless you all I greet you on the
[29:08] name precious name of the Lord Jesus
[29:10] Christ I'm so happy to be back
[29:14] excited to see all these beautiful faces
[29:16] I love you guys so much
[29:19] I brother Jack asked me to share a
[29:23] little bit of what happened over there I
[29:24] tried to put a slide together I tried to
[29:29] get from my mind what I thought was more
[29:32] important and the Lord shut it all down
[29:35] he did not allow me to do that and I
[29:40] said Lord and what is this why I believe
[29:43] in my heart that he's the one that wants
[29:45] to tell you guys what happened over
[29:47] there because if I tell you from my mind
[29:49] or what is what I thought that was the
[29:51] best thing that's just something coming
[29:53] for me and I believe that I'm standing
[29:55] right here and I guess I said Lord then
[29:58] you tell me what to tell them so they
[29:59] can see that it wasn't about me it
[30:02] wasn't about brother Kwaku it was
[30:03] something that God ordained to happen
[30:06] and I was able to see God working before
[30:12] we even left so it wasn't just the trip
[30:16] but it was what God had intended to do
[30:18] and what he wanted to do in this trip
[30:21] whether it was by using me by using
[30:23] brother Quaker by using brother Jack and
[30:27] first of all I would like to thank all
[30:29] of you for your support for your prayers
[30:32] for the giving that you did you didn't
[30:35] have to do that
[30:37] that was just praying for God to provide
[30:40] not only that there was some brothers
[30:43] that when we were actually praying in
[30:47] the feet washing brother Jack prayed and
[30:50] he said that for this sacrifice may God
[30:53] just bless them and may God grant them
[30:56] whatever they need and and in that part
[31:00] I can say that while the time that I was
[31:01] gone over there I tried to leave
[31:03] everything here with the business set up
[31:06] and I did not get no calls of nothing
[31:09] wrong but I did get some cause of some
[31:12] new people looking for me so I can just
[31:14] see how God was
[31:15] fighting while I was gone God was
[31:17] increasing my business over here
[31:19] so I wanted to put that because that was
[31:21] all him
[31:22] and you guys as we went over there we I
[31:28] felt I'm not gonna speak for brother
[31:31] quick but I felt that you guys were
[31:33] praying then you guys I felt like big
[31:35] because I felt that I had with us in
[31:39] this and was helping us was praying for
[31:41] us and we greeted all them in your name
[31:45] we told I they were they have so many
[31:47] questions about you guys spoke up to
[31:50] them about many of you guys and and that
[31:53] that plane pretty much takes care of
[31:55] that the I guess I'll just highlight a
[32:02] couple of things because if I wanted to
[32:04] tell you guys the whole trip we will
[32:05] literally be here all day because
[32:07] there's so much that happened
[32:09] but as we I was we were leaving and we
[32:14] got to the airport we got dropped off we
[32:16] get to the we get checked in and you
[32:20] know we were really exhausted because
[32:22] all the days we're getting stuff ready
[32:24] and preparing things and barely no sleep
[32:27] got up real early doing everything and
[32:29] we really talked so me and brother quake
[32:30] who had planned to get in the air
[32:32] airplane and we were gonna sleep for
[32:34] those three hours because we had a big
[32:36] when we got to Mexico City we were gonna
[32:39] have to do some crazy stuff and we
[32:41] weren't gonna get no sleep so our plan
[32:42] was to sleep those three hours we
[32:45] already spoke about it we get to the
[32:47] check-in and we sit down and we kind of
[32:51] sat down next to a little charging port
[32:54] place so we can get everything charged
[32:55] up and ready to go and I told brother
[32:58] quick go go grab us some coffee and some
[33:01] water I'll be back so I went and did
[33:03] that when I come back
[33:05] brother quake was sitting in that corner
[33:06] there's a young lady sitting where I was
[33:10] sitting and I'm like oh my god brother
[33:13] quake walk he went to work already so
[33:16] basically I go over there he's talking
[33:18] to this lady she actually needed it's a
[33:21] big testimony because that's how
[33:22] everything starting sometimes on a
[33:25] missionary trip which I'm new to this
[33:26] and I
[33:27] it's a lot of things I was learning it's
[33:29] not so much just about when we get to
[33:32] the church and the preaching that's
[33:33] going there and the people at the church
[33:34] this missionary trips have I believe
[33:37] with what I saw they have is more than
[33:40] just at the church it's like the the
[33:42] going the people that we need the people
[33:44] that we see the people that we get to
[33:45] talk to so this young lady sitting there
[33:48] and I get over there and brother quake
[33:49] who is she's Mexican doesn't speak too
[33:52] much English
[33:53] brother quake was there with his bro
[33:55] before I say this I want all you guys to
[33:57] I just spoke to brother quake uu the
[33:59] place where he's at right now he's
[34:01] preaching this morning they could not
[34:02] find a translator and he's about to
[34:04] preach in Spanish so keep him in prayer
[34:07] because he's going through that and so
[34:10] he's talking to her and he introduced me
[34:13] to her she actually needed to charge
[34:15] your phone so she was kind of plugged in
[34:19] right there and he's talking to her and
[34:20] and he introduced me and he's sharing
[34:23] some word to her and he's talking to her
[34:26] and he couldn't really do it in Spanish
[34:28] so that's where the translating already
[34:30] started so he starts talking to her and
[34:33] and he he basically told me he's like
[34:35] he's throwing something he's like give
[34:37] it to her and expand a little bit so you
[34:39] know I start talking explaining to her
[34:42] that he talks and then he tells her
[34:44] something and then I'm talking to her
[34:46] then all of a sudden his phone rang and
[34:48] he had to go take that cross bike
[34:49] started I was sitting there and talking
[34:52] to the young lady there's so many things
[34:53] that were just popping up and it was in
[34:55] like like just just talking to her you
[34:58] know and I'm gonna tell you why it was
[35:00] so so important that we spoke to her
[35:03] well we were talking about so many
[35:06] things and one of the things that really
[35:07] was like a big highlight that I see God
[35:10] how I was working I was I went to Fort
[35:12] Myers to shoot some hearts and Abby
[35:14] asked me to go with me and I took her
[35:16] with me and we were riding and she's
[35:18] like well you know I was in school and
[35:21] this girl asked me about my hair why I
[35:24] don't cut my hair and and now she's like
[35:27] well I just I just I just told her I was
[35:29] like well in first Corinthians 11:15 or
[35:31] 13 this is this is what it says so like
[35:35] I was like oh say that again so I
[35:37] recorded hit and I don't even know why I
[35:40] send it to
[35:40] brother Jack that it was just amazing
[35:43] how she didn't tell her like it was
[35:47] because I go to church she hit her with
[35:50] Scripture so I didn't think nothing
[35:52] other had the video whatever so I'm
[35:53] talking to the girl and I'm telling her
[35:55] so many things and I was explaining to
[35:57] her about how it has to until you have
[36:00] an experience for yourself and you can
[36:02] find yourself in the word if you're just
[36:04] going by other people experience it's
[36:06] not it's not gonna work you know I have
[36:09] to find that and believe that and hold
[36:11] on to scriptures the only thing that's
[36:12] gonna carry you so I was I was I thought
[36:15] about the video I was like actually I
[36:17] got to show you something so I showed
[36:18] the video of I be saying that and when
[36:22] she saw that I kind of like change
[36:24] something because I was like you see
[36:25] that like I'm not telling her that she
[36:27] has to do this she found something for
[36:29] herself and she's holding on to that so
[36:31] that in that part I just wanted to say
[36:33] that because it kind of like shows how
[36:35] she just said that and I recorded and I
[36:37] have that video like it was like things
[36:39] were just happening so the the girl that
[36:42] she was her her step that is a is a
[36:46] switch prophet he's not just doing
[36:49] witchcraft he is like a lord of that
[36:51] kind of like an example of brother
[36:53] Reginald
[36:54] so when she told me that came to my
[36:56] brother Ridge and I said you know what
[36:57] i-i've heard of somebody that went
[37:00] through something like you went through
[37:01] and I told her that I was gonna find
[37:03] that video where he preached here so I
[37:05] can send that that to her and she can
[37:08] kind of like a testimony to see
[37:10] well I she was just going through so
[37:13] many things in her life and she I needed
[37:16] to hear the word so basically I can say
[37:18] here and tell you all about the
[37:19] conversations not about that I want to
[37:20] kind of expand a little bit well when
[37:23] we're sitting there talking for about an
[37:25] hour before our flight was gonna leave
[37:28] and they call our flight and they say
[37:31] start boarding and she's like oh my god
[37:32] she didn't want to stop hearing while we
[37:34] were talking about
[37:35] she said what seat are you sitting on I
[37:37] said I'm we're sitting on c25 she's like
[37:40] I'm gonna see 14 I needed to hear what
[37:43] you had to him I said look if the Lord
[37:46] has a word for you
[37:47] you're gonna he's gonna make a way for
[37:50] you to sit right next to us and she's
[37:52] like
[37:53] my god anyways we get in the plane we
[37:56] sit down everybody gets in the in the
[37:58] seats they're about to take off nobody
[38:00] sits on the last see that we were of me
[38:03] brother Quaker MTC so I said brother
[38:05] quick well I told him what happened
[38:06] because he was in there he said go get
[38:09] her I got up I said Lord wants to speak
[38:11] to you she came and sat down I have
[38:14] videos I have pictures I wasn't able to
[38:17] put it all together because I'm not as
[38:19] good as brother Jack with all that stuff
[38:22] but if anybody has any question he wants
[38:25] to see some of this stuff I have it all
[38:27] in pictures and we can fellowship and I
[38:30] can show you guys and so anyways we got
[38:34] in the plane for three hours it felt
[38:36] like it was ten minutes went up we got
[38:38] in that plane we did not sleep the whole
[38:40] time we were talking to her we were
[38:42] sharing with her we we even went to acts
[38:46] 2:38 we're explaining that to her she
[38:49] was just if I show you the pictures how
[38:51] she was just listening and she just
[38:54] wanted to hear what we had to say to her
[38:56] anyways we got to the point where she
[38:58] wanted prayer we start praying for this
[39:00] lady for this young lady and the lady
[39:03] that's behind she bangs on my seat she
[39:06] said do you guys think you're alone in
[39:08] this plane like she was literally upset
[39:11] because we were sitting there quietly
[39:12] praying for her she I guess she was
[39:14] overhearing what we were saying her so I
[39:16] can just see how the devil is trying to
[39:17] stop God's plan and what was happening
[39:20] anyways we get to the airport down there
[39:23] rather quickly says we're gonna go we
[39:26] were all talking and we couldn't stop
[39:28] talking and we're gonna get the bags we
[39:29] we were two hours late the people that
[39:31] were picking us up were waiting for us
[39:35] for about two and a half hours okay now
[39:38] her bag wouldn't come out in and our
[39:41] bags we already have them so she said
[39:43] you know why you guys are waiting just
[39:44] go ahead I said rather quickly
[39:45] she said it's good you know go ahead and
[39:49] brother quickly said no we're gonna wait
[39:51] for her to get her back and then we're
[39:54] gonna go wait so we waited like another
[39:57] 20 minutes there and then finally she
[39:59] got her back now while we were waiting
[40:01] there she starts talking to me and she
[40:03] starts telling me what happened to her
[40:05] Miami this is what how God works and how
[40:08] God will get somebody and put him in a
[40:10] position to make you go through
[40:11] something for you to receive the world
[40:13] when it's time to receive it she had a
[40:17] business that she was partnering with
[40:19] somebody and they were gonna put half in
[40:22] half and the person didn't have the
[40:23] money yet and she put the whole money
[40:25] down and the person one day before they
[40:27] were coming were supposed to put the
[40:29] money in her bank account so she got to
[40:31] Miami and she had in her bank account
[40:34] five pesos five pesos is about seven
[40:39] cents all right because like or maybe
[40:42] like 15 cents cuz 18 pesos is $1 for us
[40:46] so she that's all that she had and she
[40:48] got to Miami
[40:49] she was gonna be here for four days
[40:51] because she was doing a like it was like
[40:57] a convention for haired she's like a
[40:59] hairdressing she's going to school she
[41:01] got to Miami had nobody here no money
[41:04] she's in the airport she didn't have no
[41:06] food no money no money for the hotel
[41:09] she's stranded she was for four days in
[41:13] Miami with no food well she got some
[41:16] food because she started calling people
[41:17] trying to get some money she was able to
[41:19] get enough money to get the hotel now
[41:21] when she got the hotel all the hotel
[41:24] would give her was breakfast so all she
[41:26] was having was breakfast she had no
[41:28] water
[41:28] she had no transportation to get to the
[41:30] place she had to walk to the place where
[41:33] the convention was that and she was
[41:35] saying that she had brought some little
[41:37] cute skirts
[41:38] some mini skirts that I heard I got into
[41:40] that and I was showing to her how God
[41:43] intends us to dress in care self same
[41:46] way and it's all to protect us and so
[41:49] everything that she was bringing was
[41:51] kind of like just letting her know how
[41:52] God wants to help you he's not saying
[41:54] those things to go against he's going
[41:56] against that nature that we are born
[41:58] with all right so it kind of helped to
[42:02] be able to tell that but she was walking
[42:03] with her little mini skirts that she had
[42:05] and she said that the guys were she was
[42:07] going down Biscayne guys were stopping
[42:10] trying to pick her up uh like like she
[42:13] went through those four days and she
[42:15] could not like no food no water
[42:19] only the hotel like she winning she got
[42:23] enough money to get an uber one time in
[42:24] the uber driver she got in the car she
[42:26] was hungry and the uber driver started
[42:28] like hitting on her and he was like do
[42:31] you need food like you see how bring in
[42:33] exactly what she needed you need food I
[42:35] buy you food you want to go get
[42:36] something then he asked him for her
[42:38] phone number and she was afraid to give
[42:41] him the wrong number because he if he
[42:43] would call it or something so she gave
[42:44] it a random the guy was harassing her
[42:46] like she went through all this stuff and
[42:48] she was devastated when she got to the
[42:51] airport she was just thinking about like
[42:53] this is over and she was hurting she
[42:56] didn't know she couldn't believe she
[42:57] went through this and there she sits
[42:59] down and here's the world of comforting
[43:03] word telling how much Jesus loves her
[43:05] telling how much God the footsteps of
[43:08] the righteous are ordered by God this is
[43:10] what she's gonna get and she was in a
[43:11] position when she was telling me this
[43:13] outside brother quick ooh I see what she
[43:15] wants to look what God did so she can
[43:17] hear that was the first thing that
[43:18] happen then after we walk away or my
[43:21] phone wasn't working where the quake
[43:23] whose phone wasn't working this Mexico
[43:26] City is the second largest city in the
[43:28] world this Airport is miles and miles
[43:31] that's how I look maybe it wasn't miles
[43:33] we could not call the people that we're
[43:36] waiting for us we didn't know where they
[43:37] were they didn't know where they were at
[43:38] we didn't know how they look they didn't
[43:40] know how we looked so we're walking away
[43:42] and we're lost in this Airport and we
[43:45] didn't know where to go in brother quick
[43:47] was right let's just go back inside
[43:48] we're gonna pray God is gonna do
[43:51] something when we walk back in the girl
[43:53] that we waited for at the back place was
[43:55] walking right by there and we found we
[43:58] connected with her again and she was
[44:00] able to connect connect with the people
[44:02] call them and we found the people so I
[44:04] was waiting for her then God we out of
[44:07] our heart even though people are waiting
[44:08] for then God made a way for us right
[44:10] that this is just like I mean just
[44:12] touching stuff I wanted to also tell you
[44:17] guys that this the the church that we
[44:20] were at if I show you guys the picture
[44:22] the floor was there there was dirt and
[44:26] rocks where the pulpit is that the
[44:30] people there
[44:34] just serve God because they love God the
[44:38] ones that are Silla I saw the people
[44:41] that were serving God and the people
[44:43] that were going to church it's two
[44:47] different two different types of
[44:49] conversation with those people the
[44:50] people were truly serving God they were
[44:52] just happy to be in the presence of the
[44:54] Lord the people that were going to
[44:56] church has some something to complain
[44:58] about they had some kind of some kind of
[45:03] this wasn't good this wasn't good like
[45:06] pointing out the bad things and I just
[45:09] want to let you guys know that this is
[45:11] happening everywhere
[45:12] those that brother Branham says these
[45:14] three kind of people in every church
[45:15] they have that everywhere over there
[45:17] there's very we have a lot of young
[45:21] people here the young people over there
[45:23] are running like crazy
[45:26] there was no young people in the church
[45:27] when we did the prayer line the people
[45:31] were coming up and most of the things
[45:33] that they were asking about was feeling
[45:36] of the Holy Ghost a lot of people
[45:37] seeking for the Holy Ghost a lot of
[45:39] people seeking for the Holy Ghost but
[45:41] that's that's good
[45:42] but in another way it's like so many
[45:44] people in this place are seeking for the
[45:47] Holy Ghost you know that that's that's a
[45:50] good thing but a lot of people are not
[45:52] filled with the Holy Ghost
[45:53] so they're a lot of people are seeking
[45:55] for the Holy Ghost and a lot of the
[45:57] mother she's crying out for the children
[45:59] like that was the biggest thing in the
[46:02] prayer lines was that the first message
[46:04] that we sir pre the brother Quaker
[46:07] preached was the transformation power of
[46:09] prayer that just like it was they needed
[46:12] that it was like they needed of it I was
[46:15] at first I was like you know such a
[46:17] simple you know message that you preach
[46:20] I was talking about the Quaker about his
[46:21] life we didn't come here to confuse the
[46:24] people with all this revelation we came
[46:25] here to get them in the right track
[46:28] where they need to be and they need to
[46:30] start praying they need to start asking
[46:31] for the Holy Ghost they need to start
[46:33] seeking God really you know so so
[46:40] basically we had a wonderful time there
[46:43] we had only three
[46:45] services at the place we got to pray we
[46:47] got to go to the house to a hospital and
[46:50] pray for a brother we got to go and pray
[46:52] for a couple of other people and the the
[46:57] people over there are just like really
[47:00] really sweet and they really love God
[47:03] and it's not because they have a fancy
[47:06] church or like we'd like this is fancy
[47:09] I'm telling you guys like this church if
[47:12] they had a church like this that would
[47:14] be like you guys have to see the
[47:16] pictures you know so brother quake ooh
[47:20] after I came back by the quake ooo went
[47:23] to to another another place and he's
[47:27] been over there he's had a couple
[47:28] services he's preaching today and he's
[47:30] coming back on Monday morning and also I
[47:34] wanted to let you guys know on the way
[47:38] back the people that picked us up which
[47:40] was some believers uncle and Auntie
[47:44] they're not message believers they just
[47:47] picked us up they picked some when we
[47:48] got then they picked us up on the way
[47:49] back and when we got there we were
[47:52] sitting in the car and they were taking
[47:54] us to their house and the guy starts
[47:55] asking me so kinda what is it that you
[47:58] guys really do what you what he said
[48:02] that you guys are preaching and all this
[48:04] so I start talking him a little bit
[48:05] about what what we do and stuff and what
[48:08] we're doing and they start asking some
[48:10] questions now these kind of questions
[48:12] that they're asking sometimes you have
[48:13] people in the world and they're asking
[48:14] questions because they want to prove God
[48:17] wrong see that when you have those kind
[48:20] of questions
[48:20] then that's somebody that's trying to
[48:22] prove God wrong that's they're not
[48:24] looking for God but the questions that
[48:26] they were asking were questions about
[48:28] like why is this why like that for
[48:31] example why was Lucifer if he was the
[48:37] angel that God had made how did he have
[48:38] evil you know so we kind of took him to
[48:41] like I say a 45 how God made good and he
[48:44] may lie in darkness and we showed him
[48:47] that and we showed him so many other
[48:48] things and it was it was such a blessing
[48:50] because they kind of were asking certain
[48:53] questions that where I can actually make
[48:57] the difference between their
[48:58] going to serve God or not you know so
[49:01] that was another time that we had off
[49:03] the church that we had to share the room
[49:05] we spent many many hours with them like
[49:07] five hours in three of those hours
[49:09] speaking to them so we got to minister
[49:11] to them and and basically that I don't
[49:18] know what else to say I mean there's so
[49:19] many other things that I can go into
[49:20] details but I just want to let you know
[49:22] that the trip was a success we were able
[49:25] to bring the Word of God we were able to
[49:28] see the people that God wanted us to see
[49:32] we went to another church and it's a
[49:35] small little congregation that the
[49:37] pastor with his such a blessing because
[49:41] he has a daughter that's nine year old a
[49:43] Sunday okay son that is eight years old
[49:50] and a little daughter that's seven years
[49:52] old and it was it was wonderful it was
[49:54] like I can see how how the love of God
[49:57] was in that little church because that
[49:58] his family was the one that were
[50:01] actually praising God more than the
[50:03] actually congregation that was there so
[50:05] we were able to see the love of God over
[50:07] there we were we had a wonderful time
[50:09] and I just if any of you want to see
[50:11] some other pictures so you can see how
[50:13] that what the church looked like and
[50:14] what the church that we have it was
[50:16] amazing and I just want to thank you
[50:18] guys for your prayers your support and

[1:13:00] praise the Lord let so let's read a man
[1:13:03] a couple scriptures I do think I want to
[1:13:08] start with Judges chapter 7 and then
[1:13:10] also a 2nd Peter a 1 is also where we'll
[1:13:15] read from 2 today as well judges chapter
[1:13:19] 7 a man starting here with verse 1 a man
[1:13:25] you all just bear with me Amen it says
[1:13:30] then jerubbaal
[1:13:32] which is Gideon and all the people that
[1:13:36] were with him rose up early and pitched
[1:13:39] beside the well of Herot so that the
[1:13:42] host of the Midianites were on the north
[1:13:44] side of them by the hill of Moreh in the
[1:13:47] valley and the Lord said in a giddy and
[1:13:50] the people that are with thee are too
[1:13:51] many for me to give the Midianites into
[1:13:54] their hands less Israel bought
[1:13:56] themselves against me saying my own hand
[1:13:58] have saved me now therefore go to
[1:14:00] proclaim in the ears of the people
[1:14:02] saying whose service fearful and afraid
[1:14:04] let him return and depart early from
[1:14:07] Mount Gilead and they returned of the
[1:14:10] people 20 and 2000 and there remained
[1:14:12] ten thousand and the Lord said unto
[1:14:15] Gideon the people are yet to many bring
[1:14:18] them down into the water and I will try
[1:14:20] them for the their and it shall be that
[1:14:22] of whom I say unto thee this shall go
[1:14:25] with thee the same shall go with the end
[1:14:28] of whomsoever I say unto thee this shall
[1:14:30] not go with thee the same shall not go
[1:14:32] so he brought down the people unto the
[1:14:34] water
[1:14:35] and Lord said unto Gideon everyone that
[1:14:38] Lapith of the water with his tongue as a
[1:14:40] dog Lapith him shalt thou set by himself
[1:14:43] likewise everyone that bow down upon his
[1:14:46] need to drink and the number of them
[1:14:48] that lapped putting their hand to their
[1:14:51] mouth were three hundred men but all the
[1:14:54] rest of the people bow down upon their
[1:14:55] knees to drink water the Lord said in a
[1:14:59] gideon by the three hundred men that
[1:15:03] lapped will I save you and deliver the
[1:15:06] Midianites into thine hand and let all
[1:15:09] the other people go every man unto his
[1:15:12] place Amen so we'll just turn over here
[1:15:15] to second Peter chapter one as well and
[1:15:22] we'll read from there praise the Lord
[1:15:25] 2nd Peter chapter 1 a man a man God is
[1:15:32] good a man second Peter chapter one
[1:15:36] hallelujah
[1:15:38] a man who says this in 2nd Peter 1 Simon
[1:15:42] Peter a servant an apostille of Jesus
[1:15:47] Christ to them that have obtained like
[1:15:49] precious faith with us through the
[1:15:51] righteousness of God and our Savior
[1:15:53] Jesus Christ grace and peace be
[1:15:55] multiplied unto you through the
[1:15:57] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
[1:15:59] according as his divine power hath given
[1:16:02] unto us all things that pertain unto
[1:16:04] life and godliness through the knowledge
[1:16:07] of him that hath called us to glory and
[1:16:09] virtue are given unto us exceeding great
[1:16:13] and precious promises that by these you
[1:16:15] might be partakers of the divine nature
[1:16:18] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:16:21] the world through lust and beside this
[1:16:23] giving all diligence add to your faith
[1:16:26] virtue and to virtue knowledge and to
[1:16:30] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[1:16:32] patience and to patience godliness and
[1:16:34] to godliness brotherly kindness and to
[1:16:37] brotherly kindness charity so if these
[1:16:40] things be in you
[1:16:41] Amen remember it's an inside job alright
[1:16:45] so if these things be
[1:16:47] you and not only in you but abound and
[1:16:50] you and abound they make you that you
[1:16:53] should neither be barren nor unfruitful
[1:16:55] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[1:16:59] Christ and that's a powerful statement
[1:17:02] all right man you you don't be in the
[1:17:06] Bride of Christ you don't want to be
[1:17:09] barren and unfruitful
[1:17:11] I understand a man in you know in Old
[1:17:15] Testament days it was taboo to be
[1:17:19] bearing it unfruitful right when you got
[1:17:22] married that was the purpose of getting
[1:17:23] married to bring forth children praise
[1:17:25] the Lord that that's the way it was and
[1:17:28] women prayed to God that they would have
[1:17:30] babies right and it still you know today
[1:17:33] you know we have some of the same
[1:17:34] situation but nowadays people don't want
[1:17:36] kids they want dogs and cats and
[1:17:39] hallelujah amen and maybe they dress the
[1:17:42] dog up and put them in a stroller and
[1:17:44] hallelujah somebody a man but you
[1:17:48] yourself not supposed to be barren or
[1:17:50] unfruitful right Amen in the knowledge
[1:17:53] of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that
[1:17:56] lacketh these things is blind and cannot
[1:17:59] see afar off and hath forgotten that he
[1:18:02] was purged from his old sins wherefore
[1:18:04] the rather brethren give diligence to
[1:18:06] make your calling and election sure for
[1:18:08] if you do these things you should never
[1:18:09] fall that's pretty quickly father we
[1:18:12] thank you for a man the ability to read
[1:18:14] the word but we know it takes the Holy
[1:18:16] Spirit to help us see what it is that
[1:18:18] we're reading God you have allowed us to
[1:18:20] embark upon a little journey here
[1:18:22] talking about war strategies and we pray
[1:18:25] that the Holy Spirit would make things
[1:18:27] clear to us bless our gathering Lord be
[1:18:30] glorified and magnified here in this
[1:18:33] place today bless the Saints that are
[1:18:35] not able to be here God for whatever the
[1:18:36] reason we trust Lord that you would just
[1:18:39] speak to them as well right where they
[1:18:40] are father's in Jesus name we pray amen
[1:18:42] amen god bless you can be seated another
[1:18:45] scripture that I just want to read real
[1:18:47] quickly a man is coming from numbers 21
[1:18:50] verse 14 I was
[1:18:53] [Music]
[1:18:55] I had this little thought that I've been
[1:18:57] you know just sitting on and and just
[1:18:59] waiting on how the Lord was just gonna
[1:19:01] bring it and so many different things
[1:19:03] that I was thinking about and I got a
[1:19:05] little text I want to say me it could
[1:19:09] have been about a month ago I'm not
[1:19:10] exactly sure but I got a little
[1:19:12] something and brother brother Nathan had
[1:19:14] sent this this scripture over to me and
[1:19:16] when he sent the script I said well hey
[1:19:19] hey that that that uh you know that
[1:19:21] that's kind of touching a little thought
[1:19:22] that I had on war strategies and and and
[1:19:26] then as we kept fellowship and around
[1:19:28] you know this that little thought it
[1:19:31] began to just kind of develop where I
[1:19:33] knew I would need to take the statue of
[1:19:35] a perfect man and bring this together
[1:19:36] but but here in numbers 21 14 it just
[1:19:39] makes this comment says wherefore it is
[1:19:42] said in the book of the Wars of the Lord
[1:19:46] what he did in the Red Sea and in the
[1:19:49] books of Arnon and you know there's many
[1:19:52] books that people look at when they get
[1:19:54] war strategies and things that nature
[1:19:57] different different military leaders
[1:20:00] that they go back and and they look at
[1:20:01] but I think the greatest military
[1:20:03] leaders a man that we've ever had is our
[1:20:06] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ a man and
[1:20:09] and and here the scriptures say that in
[1:20:11] the book of the Wars of the Lord so we
[1:20:13] want to look at some different war
[1:20:15] strategies that God has used you know
[1:20:18] our God is a military genius a man and
[1:20:22] he's one that ain't never lost a battle
[1:20:24] praise God don't matter who he got on
[1:20:27] the battlefield he won't lose the battle
[1:20:28] a man because he's the one that's in
[1:20:31] charge he's the one leading this army a
[1:20:33] man in church I don't know about you but
[1:20:36] I'm glad to be a soldier in the army of
[1:20:38] the Lord hey man I got my war clothes on
[1:20:41] me man I know that I'm in a battle I
[1:20:44] know that that I can't be defeated the
[1:20:48] same God that gave
[1:20:49] David Protection hallelujah in his
[1:20:52] battles the same God that gives us
[1:20:54] protection and not battle no matter how
[1:20:56] big the giant is a man we're still gonna
[1:20:59] be victorious they say the bigger they
[1:21:01] are the harder they fall right hey man
[1:21:04] so if you got big problems this morning
[1:21:05] your big car gonna take care of your big
[1:21:08] problem and whatever strategy you have
[1:21:12] to use to give you victory then we just
[1:21:15] follow that strategy oh praise God a man
[1:21:18] a man a man so just bear with me on
[1:21:21] today we want to just kind of get get
[1:21:23] get started down this but like I said I
[1:21:25] want to use a man for a background here
[1:21:27] the statue of a perfect man and I want
[1:21:29] to encourage you if you can maybe over
[1:21:32] the next few weeks just start listening
[1:21:34] to that sermon and a man just listen and
[1:21:36] keep listening God will speak to you in
[1:21:38] it but I want to start here by reading
[1:21:40] Amen a couple of things from this
[1:21:42] particular sermon the the Prophet says
[1:21:45] this it says Peter is saying here how
[1:21:50] that we must be partakers of his divine
[1:21:54] nature a man Peter is saying that as
[1:21:56] we're reading there in 2nd Peter 1 Peter
[1:21:59] said we must be partakers of his divine
[1:22:02] nature he says now each one of us are
[1:22:05] trying to grow into the Statue of God
[1:22:08] now your whole purpose for coming to
[1:22:10] church your whole purpose a man for
[1:22:13] being called to this word is so that you
[1:22:16] could grow into the stature of God amen
[1:22:20] God didn't call you just to be a church
[1:22:22] member a man God wants to ax reflect
[1:22:24] himself in you so that you won't be
[1:22:27] barren or unfruitful a man God is trying
[1:22:30] to do something special just for you
[1:22:33] glory to God amen that the whole purpose
[1:22:36] Amen it's not just going to church thank
[1:22:38] God for that
[1:22:39] but no it's so that we can grow into the
[1:22:41] stature of God hallelujah amen when he
[1:22:45] brings a word to us sometimes it
[1:22:48] corrects us it meant
[1:22:50] that that word in correctness is to grow
[1:22:53] us into his stature their things
[1:22:55] owners that God got to cut off of us
[1:22:57] amen and we got it just like a sheep we
[1:23:00] got to be willing to be sheared a man
[1:23:03] willing to let these things go because
[1:23:05] we want to be like Jesus huh to be like
[1:23:09] Jesus how we longed to be like him so
[1:23:12] meet so humbly man we want to be like
[1:23:15] Christ and then he goes on I'm skipping
[1:23:17] down to paragraph 61 man in this in that
[1:23:20] same quote he says last Sunday I
[1:23:23] preached glory to God says last Sunday
[1:23:26] night I preached on the key in the
[1:23:29] kiyose faith the faith faith holds the
[1:23:31] key hallelujah faith holds the key and
[1:23:35] the key is the scripture a man faith
[1:23:38] holds the key but the key is scripture
[1:23:42] now stay stay with me here since and
[1:23:44] Christ is the door see so faith takes
[1:23:48] the little hinges of the scripture and
[1:23:51] unlocks the glories and good of God I'm
[1:23:55] looking for that to a man be unlocked
[1:23:57] this morning faithful that takes the
[1:24:00] little hinges of the scripture and
[1:24:01] unlocks the glorious and good of God out
[1:24:05] to his people
[1:24:06] Oh hallelujah see so it's faith holds
[1:24:10] the key that unlocks Christ to the
[1:24:13] people unlocks it reveals him now let me
[1:24:16] just inject something there you know why
[1:24:19] we're talking here you know about faith
[1:24:21] and everything on today there was a
[1:24:23] brother one time a man he was he had a
[1:24:27] he had an apartment I believe it
[1:24:29] something like that and and and he lost
[1:24:31] the key to the apartment and I just
[1:24:33] could not find it and he had a arrange
[1:24:35] for us some guests to come to his house
[1:24:38] and and and here he you know the guests
[1:24:41] are only way to the house and he can't
[1:24:43] find the keep it looking for four days a
[1:24:45] man can't find the key to get into the
[1:24:48] apartment because faith I mean a kid I
[1:24:50] mean the kids needed to gain access I
[1:24:52] love your faith is your key that's gonna
[1:24:54] allow you to gain access to the glories
[1:24:56] of God hallelujah
[1:24:59] so so so this this brother could not
[1:25:01] find the key and and what he decided to
[1:25:03] do he say he just picked up the phone
[1:25:05] and he called the Prophet he called
[1:25:06] brother branham he said brother branham
[1:25:08] where is the key
[1:25:10] anything just acting like that where's
[1:25:13] the key brother branham and i and i the
[1:25:16] prophet just said a word of Prayer and
[1:25:18] through that God revealed where the key
[1:25:20] was who told her brother this is where
[1:25:21] the key is
[1:25:21] and it didn't breath didn't brother
[1:25:23] branham said now now now for some people
[1:25:25] you know they may have a little problem
[1:25:27] with me saying have a brother call me up
[1:25:30] to say where's the key he said but now I
[1:25:32] understand he said in Scripture when
[1:25:35] when the muse were lost
[1:25:37] hallelujah amen when Saul had lost his
[1:25:41] animals his daddy lost the animals amen
[1:25:44] we want to call them mules but you'll
[1:25:46] see a different word and amen when you
[1:25:47] read the scripture but these animals
[1:25:49] were lost
[1:25:50] hallelujah and so so had a servant that
[1:25:54] was with me say in this city is a
[1:25:57] prophet any say we go to the Prophet now
[1:26:00] they can go to anybody else but if they
[1:26:03] got to that prophet they knew that the
[1:26:06] Prophet would be able to tell them where
[1:26:08] the animals were hallelujah and if God
[1:26:11] could do that for Saul about some news a
[1:26:14] man God can use this prophet today about
[1:26:17] a key praise God and I want to tell you
[1:26:21] even though the Prophet might hear God
[1:26:22] is still here
[1:26:23] and if you have an e god I show you
[1:26:26] right wait a sec please
[1:26:29] [Music]
[1:26:30] God has got it but you got to come with

[1:28:06] faith well unlock this we got to have
[1:28:08] faith hey man let's go on and just kind
[1:28:12] of keep going here he says faith holds
[1:28:15] the key unlocks Christ to the people
[1:28:17] unlocks it reveals it so today we're
[1:28:19] gonna try to take that same key to your
[1:28:22] locked away to become a virtuous
[1:28:25] Christian right so we're trying to take
[1:28:27] the key of faith amen and remember now
[1:28:30] the scripture here glory to God faith
[1:28:33] holds the key but the key is scripture
[1:28:35] right so he's saying so now we're gonna
[1:28:37] try to take that and that take that same
[1:28:39] key and unlocked a way to become a
[1:28:41] virtuous Christian amen in the Statue of
[1:28:45] God and to be a living tabernacle for a
[1:28:48] living God to dwell in he says remember
[1:28:50] God reveals himself in three ways the
[1:28:54] first time he revealed himself himself
[1:28:56] in a pillar of fire that was called the
[1:29:00] Fatherhood a man in the pillar fire that
[1:29:03] was called the Fatherhood then that same
[1:29:06] God made manifested in Jesus Christ
[1:29:09] which he built a body made this party
[1:29:13] alright so he was dwelling in Christ
[1:29:15] amen as the Sun hallelujah but listen
[1:29:18] now thirdly through the deaths of that
[1:29:20] body he says he sanctified a church that
[1:29:24] he can dwell in it was God above us amen
[1:29:28] God with us when he came in Jesus but
[1:29:32] now in the form of the Holy Spirit a man
[1:29:35] huh it is now God in us and it's the
[1:29:40] same God all the time
[1:29:42] hallelujah so we understand what we are
[1:29:44] I was God above us God with us now is
[1:29:47] God in us he said that's the reason it
[1:29:50] was called Father Son Holy Spirit not
[1:29:53] three gods but three offices of one God
[1:29:57] they have only thought of that at the
[1:30:00] Nicene council we wouldn't have we have
[1:30:03] we wouldn't have been all messed up
[1:30:05] would we
[1:30:05] it may say that's right not three gods
[1:30:07] that people couldn't understand how
[1:30:10] Jesus talked to the Father and he and
[1:30:12] the father are one
[1:30:13] it says well there then the whole thing
[1:30:16] is sure just unfolds it certainly see
[1:30:18] it's not three gods it's three offices
[1:30:22] now you know anytime I look at that
[1:30:24] scripture because you know I believe
[1:30:25] it's the Lord our God is one that's what
[1:30:27] the Bible said right so so when we see
[1:30:30] Father Son and Holy Ghost says not three
[1:30:32] gods there's one God and three different
[1:30:34] offices hallelujah and there's so many
[1:30:36] ways that we can explain that but I
[1:30:38] wanted to use just for an example just
[1:30:40] for that today you know there are
[1:30:42] certain movies that people watch and an
[1:30:44] actor a man is actually performing
[1:30:48] multiple roles
[1:30:49] hallelujah Amen depending on the scene
[1:30:53] he changes who he is or she changes who
[1:30:57] she is depending on the scene but but if
[1:31:00] you are you know I mean you know being
[1:31:03] that you're a person that kind of a man
[1:31:06] you can kind of detect it's not a
[1:31:08] different person this is the same guy
[1:31:10] maybe all they did was kind of taking
[1:31:12] him and they put some some gray hair on
[1:31:14] his head huh make him look like a
[1:31:18] grandfather amen then he takes the gray
[1:31:21] hair off and now he looks like the
[1:31:22] father glory to God amen and they just
[1:31:26] keep working with the same character
[1:31:28] amen I mean it's the same actor he's
[1:31:32] actually performing different characters
[1:31:34] in the same movie on the same plane amen
[1:31:37] and this is nothing but a big play of
[1:31:40] life same God different times when it's
[1:31:55] lights action camera when it's cold on
[1:31:59] the scene you begin to act father then
[1:32:04] he acted as God whipped us in Jesus and
[1:32:06] now he's God in us as a Holy Spirit it's
[1:32:11] the same God I hope we get that the same
[1:32:14] God that was above us that created all
[1:32:18] of this that we have the same God that
[1:32:19] walked in Jesus it's the same God that's
[1:32:23] walking in us hallelujah not a different
[1:32:25] God he's the same God so to think the
[1:32:27] things that we saw in Jesus we now
[1:32:29] should see in us let's go on a little
[1:32:32] further sense what is it what is it says
[1:32:35] God condescending to his creation God
[1:32:38] wants to be worshipped the word God
[1:32:41] means object of worship and it's God
[1:32:44] trying to condition his people so he can
[1:32:48] get from them what he created them for I
[1:32:51] wanna I want to make sure we get that
[1:32:53] God is trying to condition his people so
[1:32:56] he can get from them what he created
[1:32:58] them for he never made you to be
[1:33:01] something else besides a son and
[1:33:03] daughter of God
[1:33:04] if you have missed that of being a son
[1:33:08] and a daughter of God you have missed
[1:33:10] the mark your whole purpose a man for
[1:33:14] being here is so that you could be a son
[1:33:16] or a daughter of God and if you miss
[1:33:19] that then you've missed the mark he says
[1:33:20] and miss the word sin si en means to
[1:33:24] miss the mark mr. mark then if I'm
[1:33:26] shooting at a target Drive
[1:33:29] attack at 50 yards and I shoot take my
[1:33:32] gun down and shoot and I miss it four or
[1:33:35] five inches what's that what's that what
[1:33:37] happens what's happened my gun needs
[1:33:40] tuning up oh I love that statement see
[1:33:44] ya last week we brought our guns here
[1:33:47] they got tuned up a man because we were
[1:33:50] missing the mark right so he said he
[1:33:53] said he sentenced I I'm one that believe
[1:33:55] God don't just give thoughts just to
[1:33:56] give thoughts God always know what he's
[1:33:59] talking about I might not know what I'm
[1:34:01] talking about but God I always know what
[1:34:03] he's talking about and God will come and
[1:34:05] say something because you need to be
[1:34:07] tuned up oh I love that a man I remember
[1:34:11] a man brother Troy made a comment about
[1:34:13] a guitar a man and how you have to take
[1:34:16] the string on the guitar and you have to
[1:34:19] tune it up hallelujah and and when
[1:34:22] you're actually tuning up the string on
[1:34:24] the guitar you actually adding stress to
[1:34:27] it you're tightening that string because
[1:34:30] it too loose do came do nothing with it
[1:34:32] come on if your life is too loose you
[1:34:36] live in any kind of way God can't do
[1:34:39] nothing with that so what do you have to
[1:34:42] do is put a little stress on it and he
[1:34:44] tighten it up and and you hear that
[1:34:46] thing go ping ping ping ping okay now we
[1:34:48] ready to do something now we can play
[1:34:51] and brother I say the guitar string is
[1:34:54] designed to be able to handle the stress
[1:34:58] can I say something you love a guitar
[1:35:01] string and God has designed to where you
[1:35:05] can handle the stress please God you've
[1:35:09] been made to him to live glory to God we
[1:35:12] destinated to handle it alright now come

[1:35:17] it man it says I miss it four or five
[1:35:20] inches what's after my gun nice tool
[1:35:21] enough there's something wrong and if I
[1:35:24] miss faith in God I miss being a
[1:35:27] Christian says God puts you here to be a
[1:35:29] Christian if you're off to one side
[1:35:32] I love these quotes if you're off to one
[1:35:35] side come back and get tuned up if
[1:35:38] you're off to one side that's
[1:35:41] I say go back and listen to this sermon
[1:35:42] play this in your house right because
[1:35:45] God is speaking something through the
[1:35:47] Prophet to us if you're off to one side
[1:35:49] oh my come back and get tuned up they
[1:35:55] meant and there's only one thing can
[1:35:57] tune you up I like that only one
[1:36:02] thinking to you that's the scripture
[1:36:04] listen the Holy Spirit in the scripture
[1:36:07] tune you brings you directly on to the
[1:36:10] target again that's right I say amen to
[1:36:14] that I believe I believe that you know
[1:36:17] and see I just kind of felt last week
[1:36:20] you know we needed a little tuning you
[1:36:22] know you know if you are the Lord just
[1:36:24] kind of kept dealing with me that went
[1:36:25] on that thought and and you know me and
[1:36:27] brother Quinton was just kind of
[1:36:28] fellowship and around it and and the
[1:36:30] Lord just kind of brought back to my
[1:36:31] attention you know it's a it's an inside
[1:36:34] job these virtues and things that's
[1:36:36] going to be on the inside you can't go
[1:36:38] to the grocery store and buy a pound of
[1:36:41] faith hey give me a quart a man of
[1:36:45] virtue no you can't do that
[1:36:48] this thing got to be burst on the inside
[1:36:50] of you and if it's been birthed
[1:36:52] inside of you then it's got to manifest
[1:36:54] itself on the outside right you know and
[1:36:57] you know we were just kind of talking
[1:36:58] and fellowship and I just begin to think
[1:37:00] on the a couple different things amen
[1:37:04] you all remember brother Branham talked
[1:37:06] about the revival that struck a man I
[1:37:08] believe was Lake Michigan and he talked
[1:37:10] about that revival a man that was on the
[1:37:12] water and he said he said it wasn't that
[1:37:14] it was new water add it to the lake he
[1:37:17] said it was the same water all the time
[1:37:20] but what happened is that inside the
[1:37:22] lake Amen it began to wash the trash
[1:37:25] that was on the inside
[1:37:27] people that don't come along and drop
[1:37:29] trash into the water the water say I
[1:37:31] can't do nothing with this Amen I'm not
[1:37:33] taking this in so the water begins to
[1:37:36] have its own personal revival and it
[1:37:38] takes that trash and throws it up onto
[1:37:41] the shore amen the river
[1:37:42] happened on the inside of the water and
[1:37:45] what we needed to revolve and I happened
[1:37:48] on the inside of us to take the trash
[1:37:50] out of our life and wash it onto the
[1:37:53] shore oh yeah
[1:37:55] that's what God's trying to do hey man
[1:37:57] you know I just began to think also you
[1:38:01] know how my god you see her a butterfly
[1:38:05] amen but before that beautiful butterfly
[1:38:08] took them colors he had to go through a
[1:38:11] process hey man that butterfly started
[1:38:15] out as a caterpillar amen that
[1:38:18] caterpillar had to going through a go
[1:38:20] through a cocoon process or glory and I
[1:38:24] want to tell you some aside in the
[1:38:26] cocoon right now amen we're in a cocoon
[1:38:30] but that's okay you stay right there
[1:38:31] brother better say now don't cut them
[1:38:34] out of that cocoon if you cut the
[1:38:37] caterpillar out the cocoon he will not
[1:38:39] develop properly so you have to allow
[1:38:42] the butterfly to were smaller tools that
[1:38:57] we got ten curvature is the law because
[1:39:05] in the process you're gonna get some
[1:39:07] beautiful wings as the after that
[1:39:10] caterpillar come through this cocoon
[1:39:11] process it's a transformation that is
[1:39:13] taking place it's no longer caterpillar
[1:39:16] it's a big beautiful butterfly
[1:39:19] hallelujah but all that happened we're
[1:39:22] inside the cocoon it's an inside job all
[1:39:29] right let me go oh oh I feel good just
[1:39:32] giving a couple quotes here from this
[1:39:34] sermon I'm not I won't read these a man
[1:39:36] we won't put them up on the screen but I
[1:39:38] just want to just just a little
[1:39:39] highlights that I'm pulling up from the
[1:39:41] same message here statue of a perfect
[1:39:43] man the profits that the church is now
[1:39:44] supposed to be taking the place with
[1:39:46] Christ carrying on his ministry he that
[1:39:48] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:39:50] shall he do also yet a little while in
[1:39:52] the world see it's me no more yet you
[1:39:54] shall see me for I
[1:39:55] a man shall be with you even in you to
[1:39:58] the end of the world see there it is
[1:40:00] carrying on his work so the church is
[1:40:02] now supposed to be taking the place of
[1:40:03] Christ a man he also says this my god it
[1:40:07] says but so many of us now we understand
[1:40:10] that we're supposed to be taking the
[1:40:11] place of Christ but it's a so many of us
[1:40:14] try to do the works of Christ before the
[1:40:17] reflection of Christ is in us so many of
[1:40:22] us try to do the works of Christ before
[1:40:24] the reflection of Christ is in us he say
[1:40:28] now there's the trouble he says we find
[1:40:31] those things happening he says you know
[1:40:33] I know it we see these stumbles along
[1:40:36] the road we find the scrap heap of
[1:40:38] ministers of Christians piled along the
[1:40:42] road because they didn't go into it
[1:40:44] right my love I love that statement see
[1:40:48] you know we got to approach this thing
[1:40:49] the right way make sure it's an inside
[1:40:51] job don't do this from the outside you
[1:40:53] know I'm gonna just kind of skip around
[1:40:54] a little bit but you talk about how a
[1:40:56] sheep a man is not axed to manufacture
[1:40:59] wool a man a sheet actually bears wool
[1:41:03] right he said now if a goat a goat get
[1:41:06] trying to manufacture it he said but
[1:41:08] he'll never a man no matter how much he
[1:41:10] tried to manufacture it he'll never be a
[1:41:12] sheep just like a bus that could never
[1:41:14] be a duck no matter how much that bus it
[1:41:17] would take dove feathers and stick it in
[1:41:19] itself and say now now now look I'm a
[1:41:22] dog it's probably and say he his shape
[1:41:25] is not like the tough right we know I
[1:41:27] don't care how much you got white
[1:41:29] pebbles oh your don't look like a
[1:41:31] dog you don't have nothing inside that
[1:41:35] acclaims you the way we don't tell
[1:41:37] whether you're both of the dogs let's
[1:41:39] put some dead carcass down and you might
[1:41:42] have white feathers but when the dead
[1:41:44] carcass comes on the scene amen then
[1:41:47] that buzzer would go and find a
[1:41:50] smorgasbords amen the dog won't have
[1:41:53] nothin to do with it but it's something
[1:41:55] about the nature of the Buzzard
[1:41:57] that
[1:41:58] everything to do with it huh what we
[1:42:01] needed to have our nature change and the
[1:42:04] nature is on the inside
[1:42:08] God is doing that he's doing that even
[1:42:11] right now listen he goes on to say so
[1:42:14] many ins to try to do the works of
[1:42:15] Christ before the reflection of Christ
[1:42:18] is in us that's the trouble with finding
[1:42:20] those things happening you know it I
[1:42:21] know it we see these stumbles along the
[1:42:23] road we find scrap he of ministers of
[1:42:26] Christians piled along the road because
[1:42:28] they didn't go into it right I want to
[1:42:30] make sure we're approaching this thing
[1:42:31] right he said a blood of Jesus Christ
[1:42:34] cleanses us it changes our nature that's
[1:42:37] what the blood supposed to do the blood
[1:42:39] of Jesus Christ will cleanse us and
[1:42:41] change our nature by sending upon us the
[1:42:44] Holy Spirit then we becoming to the
[1:42:46] divine nature of God then we become a
[1:42:48] dwelling place for God it's only after
[1:42:51] the Holy Spirit has to come upon you and
[1:42:53] change your nature then you become a
[1:42:56] dwelling place for God he goes on to say
[1:42:58] this he says and when you're a Christian
[1:43:00] you just bear the fruit of the Spirit
[1:43:02] you don't manufacture it you don't try
[1:43:05] to make it up you just bear it just like
[1:43:07] that that seeped in just bear wolf amen
[1:43:10] when you're truly a Christian you just
[1:43:11] bear these things you bear the fruit of
[1:43:13] the Spirit it says now don't make
[1:43:16] yourself something that you're not
[1:43:17] because you know and in this message he
[1:43:19] talks about how some people have a
[1:43:20] natural day just born with a natural
[1:43:22] patience they born with their nature and
[1:43:25] just just they born with certain things
[1:43:27] they they just do this
[1:43:29] they don't even profess Christianity but
[1:43:31] they still do certain things
[1:43:32] oh my y'all y'all ever seen folk that
[1:43:35] don't even profess to be Christians but
[1:43:36] live a better life sometimes than we
[1:43:38] live y'all ever seen that and I don't
[1:43:41] mean they're gonna make it a heaven but
[1:43:43] what I think God does allow that to
[1:43:45] happen to kind of show us where we need
[1:43:47] to kind of come up we call ourselves
[1:43:49] Christians let's be Christians all right
[1:43:52] now hallelujah glory to God amen I come
[1:43:56] at the light when something happened the
[1:43:58] Christians are blowing the horn
[1:44:01] yeah somebody do something is to
[1:44:04] Christians that's jumping like that car
[1:44:05] the first and you know I'm gonna tell
[1:44:07] you now you don't tell me why the
[1:44:10] Christians got to do that and then you
[1:44:12] got you got you got all the other
[1:44:14] unbelievers I'm say folk just looking at
[1:44:17] you with the hair about I can't believe
[1:44:20] they just said that now you use a curse
[1:44:22] word you use curse word but your actions
[1:44:25] does not does not reflect Christ can you
[1:44:28] see Jesus fussing them out like that
[1:44:30] come on somebody hey man I just had a
[1:44:34] conversation and then somebody say well
[1:44:37] Jesus didn't go to the temple and beat
[1:44:39] him I I said one time how many times you
[1:44:43] doing it glory to God all right I'm
[1:44:51] going on Church a man a man a man a man
[1:44:56] hallelujah he goes on to say this he
[1:44:58] says don't don't make yourself something
[1:45:01] that you're not you just become what
[1:45:02] you're supposed to be and then it takes
[1:45:04] care of itself
[1:45:06] says you must be born again and what
[1:45:08] that means that means you got to be
[1:45:09] changed
[1:45:10] you must be changed there's got to be a
[1:45:13] change you can't be born again without
[1:45:16] having faith alright I'm going a little
[1:45:19] further here a couple scriptures that I
[1:45:21] want to just read to you a man Hebrews
[1:45:24] 11 and six and also Hebrews 11 and one
[1:45:27] this says but without faith it is
[1:45:29] impossible to please him for he that
[1:45:32] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:45:34] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:45:36] diligently seek Him a man without faith
[1:45:39] it's impossible to please God it's
[1:45:42] impossible to please him for he that

[2:01:54] lower its sights a man it holds to the
[2:01:59] target amen any good shooter knows that
[2:02:02] that's the long range it's a telescope
[2:02:04] it's a binocular that you don't look
[2:02:07] around you don't look around here you
[2:02:08] don't use binoculars to look to see what
[2:02:10] time it is you got your watch here you
[2:02:13] can see exactly you don't take
[2:02:14] binoculars out looking at somebody think
[2:02:16] something's wrong with you
[2:02:17] you put binoculars on to see something
[2:02:20] that's way out and when you get it in
[2:02:24] the scope do you realize what's way out
[2:02:27] becomes present
[2:02:33] you understand that once that thing is
[2:02:36] in scope and I can see it if I can see
[2:02:40] it then I know it's there no matter if
[2:02:43] the person next to me say I can't see it
[2:02:45] it ain't not neck you don't have the
[2:02:47] binoculars but when I got it in school
[2:02:50] whether I get my sights set on this
[2:02:53] thing I live with an expectation how do
[2:02:57] I go to bed with an expectation because
[2:03:01] I'm seeing something that others cannot
[2:03:03] see my face is bringing that thing I'm
[2:03:08] getting closer and closer to my
[2:03:10] manifestation that's best that's only
[2:03:15] for a couple of y'all but I'm gonna take
[2:03:17] it I'm getting closer and closer to my
[2:03:20] manifestation thank you Jesus
[2:03:29] amen any day 9 my manifestation to be
[2:03:32] here amen I already started my shower I
[2:03:38] got my dance I got we all start see
[2:03:44] y'all ready no I'm just saying he's been
[2:03:46] so good to me I can't tell it all
[2:03:48] oh my mind all right let's see listen
[2:03:52] it's a bit knocking that you don't look
[2:03:54] around here you don't use we're not
[2:03:56] going to look to see what time it is see
[2:03:58] you don't use that but use your
[2:03:59] binoculars to look away off and faith to
[2:04:02] us that faith picks up gospel Occulus
[2:04:05] both of them both sides the new and Old
[2:04:07] Testament and sees every promise that he
[2:04:09] made and faith sees it out yonder and
[2:04:12] faith chooses that regardless of what
[2:04:15] the present tense says here y'all y'all
[2:04:18] not reading with me you needed faith
[2:04:24] it's a choice oh my god you you make the
[2:04:29] choice that are you gonna see this day
[2:04:31] and how you gonna respond to this thing
[2:04:34] but faith chooses that regardless of
[2:04:38] what the present tense says here he
[2:04:41] looks at the end he don't drop his
[2:04:45] sights down to look this away he looks
[2:04:47] out yonder he keeps the crosshair dead
[2:04:50] center on the word that's what faith
[2:04:52] does that's the faith that's in a man
[2:04:54] that does those things you know the
[2:05:00] Prophet was talking about faith leaders
[2:05:01] talk about the man that that came and
[2:05:04] said you know I'm not worried that it
[2:05:07] should come underneath my roof say but
[2:05:09] if you speak the word only then my
[2:05:11] serving to be made whole and and and
[2:05:14] what the man was was trying to get Jesus
[2:05:16] to see is that I'm a man of an under
[2:05:18] Authority and if I say this and I tell
[2:05:21] this when the go he'd go I tell this
[2:05:23] from the car me come he say the same way
[2:05:25] I had that authority I see you as a man
[2:05:27] of authority and you can tell spirits to
[2:05:29] leave you can tell them to come you can
[2:05:31] tell them to go you have that same type
[2:05:33] of third Jesus I never found faith like
[2:05:35] this in Israel he said you say this
[2:05:37] faith moved him and he says say he say
[2:05:39] he pretty much said you know he say if
[2:05:41] you just speak the word only I know my
[2:05:42] sertanejo Jesus poking the man was made
[2:05:45] whole right and brother branham said
[2:05:47] what that was was to show that distance
[2:05:51] made no difference distance does not
[2:05:57] make a difference if you got faith in
[2:06:00] God I handle it where it need to be
[2:06:02] handled
[2:06:04] this this makes no difference
[2:06:07] oh I wish I could get something out of
[2:06:09] there you don't need to know about sin
[2:06:11] the water face send the prayer face the
[2:06:16] Bible say he sent his word to heal if
[2:06:19] you would just open up your mouth and
[2:06:21] decree some page it's the same guy
[2:06:28] living inside of you and if he brought
[2:06:31] light didn't bring healing now whatever
[2:06:35] got it it's all based on your faith
[2:06:40] don't limit God you know and I just love
[2:06:43] this you know because I think about even
[2:06:46] in healing God used different strategies
[2:06:50] to bring healing and this man it was
[2:06:52] speak the word only and the woman with
[2:06:54] the issue of blood is if I could touch
[2:06:56] His garment but at the same time while a
[2:06:59] woman with the issue of blood trying to
[2:07:01] touch His garment you had Cyrus trying
[2:07:04] to get him to come to his house his
[2:07:06] faith was I don't want to touch the
[2:07:08] garment I want to at my house you had
[2:07:11] another man that said you just dropped
[2:07:13] me down in his presence I know I'll be
[2:07:16] made hope response a everybody's faith
[2:07:23] but it still reaches God and it still
[2:07:28] produces a result whatever your faith is
[2:07:33] just release it in God's hands
[2:07:34] whatever your battery is activate your
[2:07:38] faith and watch what God do a man I look
[2:07:43] at this war because this is not Gideon's
[2:07:46] war this is God's war hallelujah when we
[2:07:51] read the scripture you know there's
[2:07:53] there's been many a man that we can look
[2:07:56] at in Scripture that God used faith a
[2:08:00] man in order to bring a victory and you
[2:08:03] know let me just just you know Hebrews
[2:08:05] 11 30 says by faith the walls of Jericho
[2:08:09] fell down after they were compassed
[2:08:12] about seven days just just thinking
[2:08:14] about that you know the by faith the
[2:08:16] wall
[2:08:17] Jericho fell down here they had this
[2:08:19] this strategy that God gave them was
[2:08:22] just to march around the walls one time
[2:08:24] per day for seven days and then on the
[2:08:27] seventh day March seven times right this
[2:08:30] was the strategy amen and when they used
[2:08:33] this particular strategy it did exactly
[2:08:35] what God said and Joshua tone said now
[2:08:37] don't shout until I tell you to shout
[2:08:40] don't don't do anything don't let any
[2:08:43] secrets out a man don't do anything
[2:08:45] until we beat you to do it and on that
[2:08:47] seventh day at the seventh time God I
[2:08:48] mean Josh to say now it's time to shout
[2:08:50] and when they shouted all the walls came
[2:08:53] down except the part where rehabs house
[2:08:56] was Amen and it was their faith in God
[2:08:59] strategy they never even lifted up a
[2:09:02] weapon Oh hallelujah
[2:09:05] Amen they never lifted up a spear all
[2:09:07] they did was march around the way God
[2:09:09] told and some things you have to do
[2:09:11] because God told you to do Amen
[2:09:14] hallelujah glory the same way they did
[2:09:17] not lift up a spear you don't need to
[2:09:19] lift up your voice no I hope you get me
[2:09:25] a man that they didn't have to shoot a
[2:09:27] cannon in this battle this strategy was
[2:09:33] keep your mouth closed are you with me
[2:09:39] the in this matter it was keep your
[2:09:42] mouth closed hallelujah don't say
[2:09:46] nothing till it's time to say something
[2:09:48] so so y'all is facing a battle where you
[2:09:51] gonna have to keep your mouth closed and
[2:09:53] just smile as you're going through
[2:09:57] inside you gonna be brining up ready to
[2:10:01] say something but this is a battle for
[2:10:03] seven days
[2:10:08] [Music]
[2:10:11] for seven days they couldn't say nothing
[2:10:15] seven days of silence
[2:10:18] hallelujah seven days and don't say
[2:10:20] nothing to nobody
[2:10:21] I don't shout till I tell you to shout
[2:10:24] and when they followed that strategy
[2:10:28] then they had a victory some of y'all
[2:10:30] need to follow that strategy and you'll
[2:10:32] get a victory you can actually have your
[2:10:34] victory in seven days your situation can
[2:10:43] change and 17 limiters if you follow
[2:10:45] that strategy not only will your
[2:10:48] situation change thank you you will
[2:10:53] change as well what would I be doing
[2:10:56] perfecting that patients that temperance
[2:10:59] that colonists early kindness oh we got
[2:11:02] a journey here I'm loving this already
[2:11:04] oh my God my God my God but that was the
[2:11:09] strategy that God used and it took faith
[2:11:11] to to hold to what God said and do
[2:11:13] exactly the way he said didn't they saw
[2:11:15] the walls come down we all we all know
[2:11:18] about David fighting Goliath what a
[2:11:20] strategy a rock in a sling with a man
[2:11:25] that's that's that's a man that's been
[2:11:27] on the battlefield for all his life
[2:11:29] pretty much he was raised to do battle
[2:11:31] right this man was a he's an insult to
[2:11:34] say this man has been a warrior all his
[2:11:37] days and you were nothing but a youth
[2:11:39] say how you gonna go out here with a
[2:11:40] with a rock and see say look look look
[2:11:43] when when the lion came against the
[2:11:46] sheep like can you imagine David out
[2:11:49] that little ol itty bit of fella a big
[2:11:51] old lion and big old bear coming and
[2:11:53] take the sheep and and I think scripture
[2:11:55] say lion had it in his mouth
[2:11:57] they say so he - thought now that might
[2:12:01] that might actually cause David to go
[2:12:03] look crazy he see blood right you got my
[2:12:08] daddy's sheep and and he left all the
[2:12:11] other ones to go after this one he told
[2:12:13] the lion no you ain't taking it you and
[2:12:16] you will not have my daddy sheep
[2:12:19] hallelujah glory I'm coming I said
[2:12:22] whatever I gotta do and David didn't
[2:12:24] have no spear David didn't have did he
[2:12:27] didn't have anything say so what David
[2:12:29] had was just Rock and he took the rock
[2:12:31] and he hit the lion with it I don't know
[2:12:34] where he hid the lion that but wherever
[2:12:36] he hid him the lion let go to seep then
[2:12:40] when the lion rose up against David
[2:12:42] David said he grabbed him by his spirit
[2:12:44] and he slew the lion adrenaline was
[2:12:47] flowing this man go up against the lion
[2:12:52] not most of the lion can have it you
[2:12:56] know he hungry most us ain't got that
[2:12:59] like that
[2:12:59] Amen but but when when you when you kind
[2:13:02] of sick and tired of the devil taking
[2:13:04] anything and everything you you set up
[2:13:07] against yourself against lions and bears
[2:13:09] and everything else hurry up you say no
[2:13:13] to the devil he said no the lion could
[2:13:16] have him bear can have him he say in
[2:13:18] this uncircumcised Philistine God a god
[2:13:22] I got to give him to me just like he
[2:13:23] gave me the lion and the bear it say
[2:13:25] what's wrong with that type of faith you
[2:13:27] going out then you face and imagine this
[2:13:30] ball was 17 years old and the entire
[2:13:32] nation of Israel was resting on him
[2:13:35] being able to defeat Goliath even so
[2:13:39] they said I got confidence in and you
[2:13:42] know you could see the faith that day
[2:13:44] that David was exemplifying was
[2:13:47] contagious the rest of the armor was
[2:13:49] getting a little man this guy can do
[2:13:51] something right say so so when David
[2:13:53] went out there
[2:13:53] the sorcerer says I'm gonna let you go
[2:13:55] but not just take my armor just kind of
[2:13:57] protect yourself David put on the armor
[2:13:59] way too big for him and then he just
[2:14:01] before he went running out he threw it
[2:14:03] all off he said look I ain't tested none
[2:14:05] of this I fought in no battles with this
[2:14:07] armor some y'all trying to fight y'all
[2:14:11] battles with somebody else armor
[2:14:15] in your war strategy you can use
[2:14:18] somebody else armor can I tell you what
[2:14:21] you need to use use what God gave you
[2:14:24] Hey
[2:14:26] some of y'all God gave you a song in the
[2:14:28] missio battle use your song sorry y'all
[2:14:32] the prayer warriors use your prayer to
[2:14:35] intercede and get in touch with God huh
[2:14:38] whatever it is that God gave you use it
[2:14:41] some y'all are encouragers he meant
[2:14:43] something better you just got encourage
[2:14:45] somebody as you encouraged other people
[2:14:48] you yourself you get encouragement
[2:14:51] whatever God has given you use what you
[2:14:54] got come on touch the neighbors say use
[2:14:56] what you got whatever God's given you
[2:15:04] use that for his glory he's a war
[2:15:07] strategies amen and I want to bring it
[2:15:10] home here with Gideon cuz my god
[2:15:12] Gideon what was something that it took
[2:15:15] faith forgetting to do what he did it
[2:15:19] took faith now as I was reading I could
[2:15:23] not necessarily find this a man in
[2:15:26] particular but I did a little search on
[2:15:30] how big the army was the Midianite army
[2:15:34] because you know we all know Gideon went
[2:15:36] to battle here with only 300 men and now
[2:15:42] the army was stripped down Gideon had
[2:15:48] 32,000 men for battle but the Midianites
[2:15:52] had a hundred and thirty-five thousand
[2:15:54] men I want you to think about this with
[2:16:00] 32,000 men for the battle the odds were
[2:16:04] for Midianites to one Israelite that's
[2:16:09] bad odds
[2:16:10] I'm one man I gotta go against full huh
[2:16:14] that seemed pretty bad oh my but God
[2:16:18] tell Gideon Gideon first thing in the
[2:16:22] morning the ones that are scaredy-cats
[2:16:27] ask him if they're scared say whoever
[2:16:30] scared let them go on amen back to the
[2:16:33] house and getting it makes this grand
[2:16:36] announcement and you're lucky this man
[2:16:37] say now any y'all boys afraid that going
[2:16:40] this battle with me if you're afraid do
[2:16:42] you just get your stuff you go and I can
[2:16:44] see what I'm look and he probably
[2:16:49] telling its partner we were just talking
[2:16:52] about this last night God just made a
[2:16:54] way if you ain't going I'm going back
[2:17:00] you can stay if you want to say I ain't
[2:17:03] staying here I'm going and I can see one
[2:17:05] pick up his stuff in his suitcase and
[2:17:07] eat sorry for us I'm done before you
[2:17:10] know it another would follow in another
[2:17:12] twenty two thousand twenty two thousand
[2:17:17] scaredy-cats he only had 30 mm nah he's
[2:17:24] down to ten thousand me the odds were
[2:17:27] four to one with 20 to 30 mm now I got
[2:17:32] ten thousand the odds just with thirteen
[2:17:36] point five to one I got to take out
[2:17:44] thirteen and a Half Men because my
[2:17:46] brothers were scared and you know what
[2:17:49] God told Givens they say you're the
[2:17:51] numbers you're 32,000 you're 32,000 if
[2:17:55] y'all win the battle y'all gonna think
[2:17:57] y'all did this and y'all on strip even
[2:17:59] though the odds were against them they
[2:18:01] still would have thought they did in the
[2:18:03] old strip seven y'all in some battles
[2:18:05] where y'all thinking y'all doing this on
[2:18:07] your own
[2:18:07] this battle is not yours it's God's and
[2:18:12] God gotta get you to a place where you
[2:18:14] realize that he alone deserves glory so
[2:18:20] i'ma tell you in the process of getting
[2:18:23] you to the place where he alone deserves
[2:18:26] glory he has to strip you down
[2:18:31] can I tell you something if you are in a
[2:18:34] process right now in your life where you
[2:18:36] feel like your resources are being
[2:18:38] stripped from you
[2:18:39] anybody feel that way get ready for a
[2:18:42] miracle
[2:18:43] I heard her brother preach this a few
[2:18:52] weeks ago just preaching about getting I
[2:18:54] said oh yeah that's me I got it I gotta
[2:18:56] take that brother get ready for a
[2:18:58] miracle if you go through I mean I had
[2:19:01] 32,000 now I'm down the 10,000 and ain't
[2:19:06] it it's going to be another pull God
[2:19:11] tell Gideon say now your numbers are
[2:19:13] still too high for me huh y'all still
[2:19:17] don't think y'all did this in y'all
[2:19:19] ultra with ten thousand against 135
[2:19:22] thousand so gotta strip things down to
[2:19:34] get rid of that pride gosh I'll tell you
[2:19:40] what I need you to do is call them in
[2:19:42] down to the water and all I'm gonna get
[2:19:45] gonna drink this water thirsty they're
[2:19:47] gonna drink this water but if something
[2:19:48] I'm gonna approach it one way and
[2:19:50] another is gonna approach it a different
[2:19:51] way it said now as they approach to
[2:19:52] these two different ways I want you to
[2:19:54] kind of separate them the ones that kind
[2:19:57] of you know get it like like dogs not
[2:19:59] now understand they want a dog where the
[2:20:01] dog is drinking water even even my cat
[2:20:04] do this when they drink they always
[2:20:05] watching where they drinking right so
[2:20:08] this one just you know they when they
[2:20:10] got they get the water cup it and and
[2:20:13] and and drink it why the eyes are still
[2:20:16] on the enemy the other ones just fall
[2:20:19] prostrate on their face drinking water
[2:20:20] just facing and you can see some of the
[2:20:22] hairs just baptized in the water he said
[2:20:26] get them fellows put them to the side
[2:20:28] and 9700 over here 300 over there and
[2:20:36] God to Gideon
[2:20:37] send the 9700
[2:20:44] you tabata gods whose ways are higher
[2:20:48] than our ways and whose thoughts are
[2:20:50] higher than our thoughts you you you you
[2:20:53] you got to know who my God is say say
[2:20:57] now just takes in the 9700 home and give
[2:21:01] me 300 now look the odds with a 300 man
[2:21:07] army going against 135,000 meant that it
[2:21:11] would be 450 men to 1 y'all Satan but
[2:21:25] the Bible says one of you shall chase
[2:21:31] wanna chase a thousand and two of it ten
[2:21:35] thousand to a flight Oh God needed some
[2:21:39] warriors that I show up in the battle
[2:21:42] and he'll take care of the rest of it
[2:21:45] and when Gideon went down there where
[2:21:48] there's 300 God took the army out now I
[2:21:52] need you I need you just I need to just
[2:21:54] give you something here I was just a
[2:21:55] little note that was in my BOB I was
[2:21:57] just blessed by this Gideon strange
[2:22:00] battle strategy that's what they say
[2:22:03] Gideon strange battle strategy Carol it
[2:22:06] on the elements of surprise the elements
[2:22:10] of confusion the elements of the enemy's
[2:22:15] mistaken assumption amen when deadwood
[2:22:21] god can catch the devil off surprise
[2:22:24] oh my y'all know y'all got y'all y'all
[2:22:27] know many out on big cut off a surprise
[2:22:29] here you're going through and then you
[2:22:31] know everything that's so good just all
[2:22:32] of a sudden some just happen maybe a car
[2:22:35] something where that light come from how
[2:22:39] did that like come on I just had this
[2:22:42] thing service right and here you know
[2:22:45] this happened and then you get that
[2:22:46] fixed flat tire
[2:22:49] then you go home and it's hot AC not
[2:22:55] working huh hallelujah you such a
[2:22:59] problem after problem after problem and
[2:23:03] you had this night spits big cushion in
[2:23:05] the bank huh but then it start getting
[2:23:08] depleted because of all the problems Oh
[2:23:12] somebody but in the midst of your batter
[2:23:15] you keep holding on because gotta put it
[2:23:17] back and the way that God puts things
[2:23:21] back can I tell you how he do it for you
[2:23:30] that's the goal that you serve so be
[2:23:34] patient in your trial
[2:23:35] so temperance in your trial I don't care
[2:23:38] about what the devil's bringing to you
[2:23:40] just keep demonstrating the love of God
[2:23:45] double-double he liked to do that he
[2:23:50] liked to do that he liked to do that
[2:23:52] it says the Gideon strange battle
[2:23:55] strategy on the elements are surprised
[2:23:57] and I love when God like to surprise the
[2:23:59] devil he thought he had me boy boy God
[2:24:01] gotta throw a surprise on him it meant
[2:24:03] confusion y'all want to know how y'all
[2:24:06] confuse the devil by walk in here and
[2:24:09] praising God even though you're going
[2:24:10] through it you know what I'm gonna let
[2:24:17] me put it this way if I ain't got
[2:24:18] nothing else but a priest that's what
[2:24:21] i'ma give God
[2:24:25] the devil may take this the devil may
[2:24:28] take that but one thing you can take is
[2:24:31] my priests coming here I got the heart I
[2:24:38] got the loudest hallelujah man brother
[2:24:42] Jack Muscat victory no I'm going through
[2:24:45] but I'm praising God for the victory
[2:24:52] y'all gotta learn how to learn how to
[2:24:54] worship before you break through you
[2:24:58] worship it based on what you see in your
[2:25:00] binoculars
[2:25:01] you already see that thing over now come
[2:25:04] on somebody and brother brother when
[2:25:06] Scott used to tell us say don't you know
[2:25:08] we don't tell us going through we
[2:25:09] smell the smoke don't tell us that we
[2:25:12] see it all over you no no you don't ever
[2:25:14] want people to make it seem like good
[2:25:18] you think they start feeling sorry for
[2:25:20] you
[2:25:21] don't feel sorry for me feel sorry but
[2:25:24] if you want you can feel sorry for the
[2:25:26] devil if you want to but I don't even
[2:25:27] feel sorry for him
[2:25:29] hey man glory to God
[2:25:33] Gideon strange battle strategy counted
[2:25:36] all counted on the elements of surprise
[2:25:38] confusion and I love this - enemies
[2:25:41] mistaken assumption you know the devil
[2:25:45] can make some mistakes - he always
[2:25:47] talking to you about mistakes but he can
[2:25:49] he can have the wrong assumption it was
[2:25:55] a mistaken assumption and this is the
[2:25:59] the Midianites the Mennonites had a
[2:26:02] mistaken assumption that they had fallen
[2:26:04] prey to an innumerable attacking force
[2:26:09] God gave the man a dream and he saw
[2:26:12] Gideon just coming into the cabinet he
[2:26:14] tell him and dream in the man and other
[2:26:16] man need to talk to game interpretation
[2:26:17] that's the Swart of Gideon and they had
[2:26:20] an assumption that Gideon had this great
[2:26:23] army and then realized Gideon had 300
[2:26:27] men and we're getting this divided or
[2:26:30] 300 men of
[2:26:31] it's a chess follow me say now we're
[2:26:34] gonna make a lot of noise right we're
[2:26:36] gonna be banging pitches and carrying
[2:26:38] lights what kind of strategy is this the
[2:26:44] pictures come on get up out of here 300
[2:27:31] men just making a little noise banging
[2:27:33] on pitches and carrying carrying light
[2:27:36] lights lamps lights the sward of God and
[2:27:40] the sword of Gideon he put God first now
[2:27:44] that's why he said it the Swart of God
[2:27:46] and of Gideon because this was not
[2:27:49] Gideon's battle
[2:27:51] this was God's battle he just needed
[2:27:54] Gideon show up oh I love God I love God
[2:28:10] let me just read a quote here to try to
[2:28:12] finish this off this is coming from if
[2:28:15] God be with us
[2:28:16] then where's all this miracles and I'll
[2:28:20] just go right to paragraph 117 Oh
[2:28:24] actually no I got to read this state
[2:28:26] stay right there that that's 55 just
[2:28:31] stay with me here now I'll close out we
[2:28:33] read the scripture here we're Gideon
[2:28:35] scared out by the winepress threshing
[2:28:38] out enough wheat before the Phylis times
[2:28:40] that of Midianites found him him and his
[2:28:42] daddy out there getting a little grub
[2:28:44] for their winners food thrashing it out
[2:28:46] secretly so they couldn't find them
[2:28:49] because they just come in like
[2:28:50] grasshoppers and took all they had look
[2:28:52] at this that's the way the devil does we
[2:28:58] get a little church started everything
[2:29:01] going fine yeah I'm gonna tell you
[2:29:05] something I just read this same quote a
[2:29:07] few weeks ago in Bible study and I'm
[2:29:10] bringing it back around cuz I read it
[2:29:12] before now I'm reading it after all
[2:29:16] right amen
[2:29:18] I read it before I left to go to
[2:29:19] Zimbabwe not reading it after and look
[2:29:21] at what the prophecy that's the way the
[2:29:23] devil does we get a little church
[2:29:25] started everything going fine how many
[2:29:30] preachers don't know this to be the
[2:29:32] truth since just about the time
[2:29:34] everything's going along fine some of
[2:29:37] them pasta will come right amongst that
[2:29:39] group and tear it to pieces that
[2:29:40] imposters the devil will come right
[2:29:45] amongst that group and tear it to pieces
[2:29:47] that's right snatch the church right
[2:29:50] from a man if he can do it and I love
[2:29:54] the part that says that mean he can do
[2:29:58] that now you gonna try can I just be out
[2:30:01] of the job he gonna try to just disrupt
[2:30:04] all kind of stuff this is why I say you
[2:30:05] need a war strategy what some is gonna
[2:30:09] be faith and like I just using in a
[2:30:13] Joshua's situation it was actually just
[2:30:15] don't see nothing that was a strategy
[2:30:19] they overcame with not saying nothing
[2:30:22] some of y'all gonna have to leave here
[2:30:24] and don't say nothing halleluyah came
[2:30:29] out seven days nothing
[2:30:32] burning up you just old imposter come
[2:30:40] right amongst that group and tear to
[2:30:41] pieces that's right snatch the church
[2:30:43] right for many if he can do it see
[2:30:45] that's the devil come in like
[2:30:46] grasshoppers and take out what's been
[2:30:48] given says Gideon certainly certainly
[2:30:52] was a scripture man when the angel Lord
[2:30:53] said to him and if you notice it wasn't
[2:30:55] the angel of the Lord here it said and
[2:30:58] the Lord
[2:30:59] capital L Ord it was not an angel it was
[2:31:02] God it was a theophany
[2:31:04] in a man in the form of God like
[2:31:08] appeared to Abraham back in the
[2:31:09] wilderness and and look like a man
[2:31:11] so therefore being a messenger he was
[2:31:13] the angel of the Lord and he appeared to
[2:31:16] him and he said thou mighty man of Valor
[2:31:17] and he's going to make him and deliver
[2:31:20] Israel by him I'm skipping down to
[2:31:22] paragraph 117 in that same message and
[2:31:27] he says this it says now Gideon and
[2:31:30] those people there before they could see
[2:31:33] or can ever go see these miracles of God
[2:31:38] there was a condition that had to be met
[2:31:42] unlike that a man before they could see
[2:31:45] a man or ever go see the miracles of God
[2:31:47] there was a condition that had to be met
[2:31:49] to meet to see the power of miracles
[2:31:53] they had to believe to see the power of
[2:31:57] miracles they had to believe that
[2:31:59] sustained condition that we have to meet
[2:32:01] today if we want to see the power of
[2:32:03] miracles then we have to believe they
[2:32:06] also had to believe and obey the
[2:32:09] prophets word glory to God if they want
[2:32:13] to see miracles they had to believe
[2:32:15] because getting actually if the Lord is
[2:32:17] with us then we're all his miracles well
[2:32:19] God showed him a miracle amen
[2:32:22] when he stripped down his army two times
[2:32:24] and sent him out there were 300 men God
[2:32:26] showed him a miracle right he says but
[2:32:28] but to meet to see the power of miracles
[2:32:31] they had to believe they also had to
[2:32:32] believe and obey the prophets word
[2:32:34] see the miracles of God now remember
[2:32:36] before that they could see the miracles
[2:32:38] they had to obey what the Prophet sent
[2:32:40] and before we can see the miracles of
[2:32:43] God we've got to obey what the prophets
[2:32:47] said the Bible is the Prophet to us
[2:32:49] that's right thank God
[2:32:54] war strategies just trying to anoint
[2:32:57] your faith today amen same way Gideon
[2:33:00] went out there by faith you can approach
[2:33:02] whatever it is that you got by faith
[2:33:04] same way David went out by faith you can
[2:33:06] approach whatever it is you got by faith
[2:33:08] your Goliath will go down by faith amen
[2:33:11] Joshua and the children of Israel when
[2:33:14] they went to Jericho they walk by faith
[2:33:17] around them walls they came down each
[2:33:20] one no strategist God brought a victory
[2:33:22] and we approach God this morning with
[2:33:24] the same type of faith I guarantee you
[2:33:27] have a victory in your situation amen
[2:33:30] let's pray father how grateful we are
[2:33:34] for your word I would thank you Lord
[2:33:38] Jesus for the ability father just go
[2:33:43] back and look at these things in
[2:33:44] Scripture but Oh God our hearts are
[2:33:48] encouraged because in the midst of what
[2:33:50] we see in these stories we also see a
[2:33:52] deeper picture and that is that you are
[2:33:57] trying to bring us into the image to the
[2:33:59] stature of a perfect man God you want to
[2:34:04] display yourself in us and all God how
[2:34:07] we have to fight and wrestle with the
[2:34:10] enemy we see his his hand we see him and
[2:34:14] how he moves Lord but we also see you
[2:34:16] moving in our myths thank you for
[2:34:20] encouraging us thank you for helping us
[2:34:22] Lord and in God we don't want to be like
[2:34:25] the Buzzard trying to stick feathers in
[2:34:28] it and call ourselves Christians but God
[2:34:29] we really want this to be an inside job
[2:34:33] that every virtue will be birth in us
[2:34:36] and it be manifested Lord that that is
[2:34:39] our very purpose Lord this is what your
[2:34:41] your prophet said god this is this is
[2:34:44] why we're here this is why we come to
[2:34:46] church Oh God
[2:34:48] so that we might come to this place that
[2:34:50] you have called us to as Christians who
[2:34:54] add to our faith virtue
[2:34:57] we have the foundation of faith but we
[2:34:59] got to add and we're determined Lord she
[2:35:02] gives us to add we're determined to be
[2:35:04] all that you have called us to be Jesus
[2:35:10] we surrender our thoughts we surrender
[2:35:13] our ideas we surrender our life to you
[2:35:15] God we follow you Jesus wherever you
[2:35:18] lead God we go home pray in Jesus name
