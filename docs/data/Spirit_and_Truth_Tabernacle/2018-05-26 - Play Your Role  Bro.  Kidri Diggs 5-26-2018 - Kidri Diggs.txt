we are here tonight law and expectation father for we know that there's no good thing that dwells within us but when your spirit lives within it's all about you and your purpose so father we pray that tonight all flesh moves out of the way Lord God that and that I'm sure will will be done more God and Father for you know what was going to take place before the foundation of the world in this service today the Lord God we're just looking for the supernatural all know about we we have plenty of word we have plenty of scriptures plenty of coleslaw we have pity of services the Lord we long

put within us our word that says I won't complain nor for we know that whatever you're doing whatever is visiting us whatever standing before us is for our good so now let us have the right mindset more than hoople's to appreciate the growing process why we love you approaching bless this church northern keep them striving for more of you now northern that complacency sent in my heart now for many people are falling away and looking for something different when you've been here all along so when I open my eyes to those can I see you Lord and show yourself real in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and we thank you church say Amen amen you have your Bible let's turn to the Book of Jonah Jonah the second chapter praise the Lord that's his name for he is a mighty God how many appreciate what God is doing in your life that was real week Leah God doing something in your life amen good to see my confidant my soldier my friend brother smiley a man in the back hallelujah you know we was talking about it today I've been coming to Florida for about 20 years you know and it never gets old and the weather never stops to me cease to amaze me generally I'm in verse verse chapter 1 let's die read that verse 1 jonah 1 and 1 you ever say man now the work of the lord came unto jonah the father of Mattia saying arise go to Nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me hallelujah but generous up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the lord and went down to Joppa and he found a ship down to Joppa and it and he found a ship going to tosha's so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with him on to Tarshish from the presence of the lord but the lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken hey man let's go to st. John 11 God said I'm going to show you you gonna disobey me I'm gonna make this trip hard st. John 11 they start at verse 1 st. John 11 and verse 1 now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany the town of Mary and her sister Martha it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick therefore his sister's sick unto him saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick when Jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified here by a mail-order blessing to the reading of his word you can have your seats and you know the rest of the scripture says now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus so these people they knew Jesus real well and this wasn't just them umm presumptuously making a request they made this request because they knew he could hear that brother you know so tonight by God's grace I have a subject and I'm praying that the Lord gives the inspiration but that relies on you tonight you know because we don't know where God will go but I'm willing to follow so tonight my subject is play your role they may play your role because sometimes people are in desperate need but you got to play your role so they can be breast hernia you know as I as I looked in the scriptures and you know sometimes about playing a role you can look at something and not understand it and you can judge it before the time and you know as Christians we do that all the time we'll see something happen we'll see stuff happen to somebody we hear something said heard really something somebody say that we heard and we because we're human we're trying to understand it intellectually but we kind of understand it as natural people in a collar level but the Bible says sisters Virginia that hallelujah you can understand the mind of God the Bible says his ways in that our ways his thoughts are not our thoughts so let me say this me as a Christian me as a sort of God you just looking at me came understand what God is doing with me hallelujah because evening that know what God has in store for me you may not know the role he want me to play and sometimes you do play a role that role is really not you but it's the scene God won't you really yeah so you have to wait until the play is over before you open your mouth and speak about all throughout the scriptures we saw different roles we play you know and God oh yeah it is a great role playing himself God loves to play a role he loves to keep the people guessing and you know we was talking about this in the house and I was like Lord stop just stop you know and we started talking about God and how God begins you unveil himself see he wanted to change roles and the public God said in a mighty garden well it was God changing his name you know when you were younger [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so we look at look at the roadway somebody might get secret counsel oh no I'm just play the role I have to play the role of someone fill with a brain tumor just so got the show the hospital so I can play that role with the head that she is not on to death but father so sometimes we look like you're struggling sometimes you look like you found out but God has you played a role so he could get girly God won't screw me and sometimes we got the little like we defeated so God could be holy gonna stop you don't know what I'm going through my panel it ain't what it seems on the outside let's talk about it a little bit you know we look and we see that God loves to play a role but what he was doing he was on fellas you know he started that esterday the great eternal he was all by himself but that wasn't who he really was so he began to change masks and he started in valence him but we unveiled himself he kinda Cindy let me he came down a little bit lower honey that we already know he was dating hot but he wanted to come down so we could understand him so he had to play a role that we could catch because that's him the great control we couldn't understand that scene so he was playing and say that's Christ and he he condescended from the great eternal he changed man she took that mask off we were little mascot and separated him self-existing honey all by himself but he still couldn't catch the world we still couldn't catch her in Ross because at that time that he wasn't even God we still didn't know him creation didn't know him because you all by herself and he did not want to be all by himself so he had to change master here honey see you all about him getting going so he took off that mask put on the mask of the anger and the leg off with the public concepts that the low-cost is God created anointing the British started creating holiness he's got to create moons silence oceans rivers all these things because that's what the logos tell it comes out it create so he was saying from each mass he was revealing his glory he was from being eternal saying nobody can touch me catch it now catch out who wrote this play he was untouchable in the beginning Pilar did he changed to be self existent that means nobody stands with him but did that stop him from being untouchable still the same person still the same was he still in touch unchangable unshakable unstoppable passing you are oh you are God alone what we think these inspirations are coming from it comes from a place huh yeah that God calls just by himself and you don't touch as he I don't want to get too deep into this pot but you know church as he begin to change Mass he says okay I got something I got a real purpose in in this so he took that mess off of the logos creating and then he turned he put that aside Harish he created angels and all these things did he became gone and now he's in a surprise huh when meeting you can recognize the role we could look at him and say hey that stuff that was brought over here that was brought over there that was [Music] he became God we became worse of us failure so when God changed math to become something he brought us alone win the Java honey and God begin the play spot hurry so I'm saying tonight Church what role are you playing but we see God he kept condescending condescending condescending and I lived the part where he gets down he creates he begins to create man he says us make man in our image you know people have debated this for years they said well it was it was it was us in the garden it was you know me and press themselves and all these other things and he was talking to the US but no let's realize who the US was because at that point honey none of us were created we were in his mind so he wasn't talking to me he wasn't talking to you but this was happening if you can go there with me that we are what I'm doing is I'm illustrating a drop I want to show you the play that was in God's mind so as we remember God kind of seen it from these first steps earlier but he was still eternal take a look back and he can see that he was he killed her but now he's down here a man he's always in condescended always out to God but he still eternal hurry let's come down a little bit low he still held him let's come down a look at mo he's still hungry Oh God but here at God he says I want to create a man so he turns around and looks at himself nobody else to change mess with him nobody asked was eternal nobody else was self existent nobody else had power but we was talking to he turns around and he looks at the expressions of himself and he says hey you tunnel hey lo gosh hey let us make man in our image and we God comes inside of you that makes you eternal that makes you stop existence that gives you creative power to touch anything cats dogs roll out with you the road in the plane if you can see God in his room you could see yourself I'll say let us make me you know everybody was get the credit but no you know remember he said he alone get going and the Bible said he won't share his glory with nobody but then he comes back around and said hey that these problems you going through these sufferings it is not even worthy to be compared with for glory I just told you he said let us oh look at God playing a rope and his whole motive is that you may know who he is but I want to show you something tonight about playing a role you can look at something that you could characterize it even in a religious form and you can say man that brother look like it ain't true it look like it ain't real let the play be played out let the script be played out just in case you hadn't known just in case it is you know is so much stuff on the internet so much stuff going out let me explain something to you I almost things I just talked about almost different masks I just talked about was there before there was a Google was there before there was an Internet was there before there was a Wikipedia so I don't need to research that to understand my room I don't need to research that to understand that God sent some truth in this day it will connect with who I am as I pay out my JAMA you know some means some people can get so caught up in the role that stuff will come to them by inspiration that's not even on the script I just give you a natural natural one I've heard I've seen the interview of Denzel Washington never heard of him this is only if you order in this world but you're not of this world but you know he played a role of Malcolm X and he said he got so caught up in the role he starts to rehearse he's got to rehearse lines and scripts that wasn't even what the director put out it was coming from the spirit of the man who you know and you know partly that the proper God say God takes the man but he leaves the spirit he says the devil does the same thing so I'm here to say trust that demand they leave but the role will always be there for someone to act it out in no time I'm here to say tonight that there are scenes that are that have been specifically ordained that you've got to play in nobody else can play there's only one country teach nobody never be able to take my lines there are things that God gave me before the foundation of the world that no man will never be able to put claims on have you ever heard another preacher cousin what is it it's inspiration in my role never seen a preacher sniffing involved and only I could act out that role and that's things about him that nobody else can act but you know my hope I ain't going to fastly but you know what this is where we supposed to me we ain't supposed to be dragging around honey when your anointing is here we're supposed to catching it right choice let's look at a full second reason why I read Jonah we look at Jonah God told him specifically go to Nineveh and preach because the sin of the people have come up to me then in the first time God said he said the same thing about stop the sales of sign have come up to you so one thing I want you to understand when you in sin you ain't getting by it's coming up to God and eventually he's going to send a wire to deliver you but the problem is people don't understand the role that's being played then hit a preacher there see how it come and they're like nah he ain't the one to correct me you're missing the room oh yeah you're missing the room but you know God told Jonah he say hey I want you to go to Nineveh and I want you to present those I know they don't deserve the difference that wasn't his choice God can say we wanna see God could give grace do we wanna give grace to you but see the problem we look at things and we see hey they too far gone ain't no help for them but let God be the judge first and see we look at Jonah God gave him a direct order go and preach it doesn't nope I'm going to Tosh I'm gonna jump on his boat and I'm goin home to us he look like a direct backslide do backdrop well let me say like this low know the proper God saying he was in the complete will of God see this is what I love about the message of the hour the Prophet will say things to challenge you as a Christian because as a man as a regular man it looked like he was playing his role wrong but according to God lucky let's understand this you will never be able to do something catch God off God you would never be able to do something here in and any catch God by surprise you would never be able to do something god sake uh what I'm gonna do now so how could it be out of the will of God when God is watching over him remember the Bible says all things work together for good now we can select which play that's gonna work on it has to be for everything oh yeah but we look at we look at Jonah Helena we judge the situation with a God told him to go this way and he would another way backslider purpose here goddamn i'ma drop something on you now we're doing that about people that's left the message backslide let's talk about the topic last detail let's let it play out let's let it play out let me ask you something look children leave the house and they go out and do you know who just passed away and say I mentioned little paper not my child anymore no you're believing in a return you're believing that this is just something they're going through so you're waiting for God to get glory because you're holding all the structure that said write them up in the way that they should depart from so no writing for God to play as well cuz you play those sometimes we can't be God part of the time we got to be gods all the time hallelujah but we look at Joe Louis backslide boy are you going to hell you know I know we feel that way family members and different things but remember he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God you think about a child go out in the world get tattoos just start up hallelujah stop drinking and smoking URIs honey your boys hug let your hair grow out like a Rasta failures and all this stuff you know and then one day they look at the mom and dad and they say boy I had it good and then they started working they way back see if you already prejudge the situation ok we'll seize him and you know condemn him the hell you came you think it is a certain way he got to come no let God take care you just play a role judge I fight we miss it sometimes with our children with our loved ones little things God is with us in the place of Redeemer why is no child your love for your spouse get louder and then love when you love why don't you be upset yeah it's 10 attention it before that's what we do we look at it and we say oh lordy go on the head you don't know your role the sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God now let's look at it that child come back they surprise you when they sitting up in church you Presonus for a man priests and they have no hope what happens then God gets glory but if you prejudge it no that'll never happen so we got to press on we got to let it play out but you know these religious these religious these all going for luxury wear Pharisee acting message believers that think they know everything please don't get me started just me and my only personal opinion I think when people are so dogmatic that they don't believe in grace they don't know Jesus they don't believe that God could save a prostitute that God to save our children that God could say well I am the doctor say well chief the doctor say when I don't you up in the again let's take our hands off and play our role she chose let's remember the property God talked about the law of contrast so you need a negative to see a positive and if you it isn't certain somebody you know that I did on the negative why don't you be the pilot you see up to the place now and I say this humbly I'm not moved by what people say I've been called a lot of things but the word harderberg quintet this is let me laugh a little bit yes I you just you just nice man matter itself well they won't mean except in the name of religion and I won't curse I don't argue first I just say the Bible and the Prophet says just and I don't argue about it oh ah he just he just nice nasty I say thank you that means that really ain't got no hold on me I really didn't react the way they want me to reaction so I'm alright with it as long as I'm not singing Hallelujah she will see these will see things happen and then we try to put it in a certain category let it play out still let's look at the role a little bit everybody all right Jonah gets on the boat I got red disobedient get from the boat and he think he's running from God now this is the question I always acts it's just like a person that's gonna rob a bank and think they're gonna get away if they were sitting next to question how many people do I know ever got away they wouldn't do it because nobody knows somebody's I don't I got no friends that ever robbed the bank Sarah and got away with it so I don't have them kind of cause I don't go there those things are not in my mind you can't get me to step in one of those roles cuz I don't see guardian Gloria turning up suitors the only way God can get glory out of it is if you think it's possible so you know even when we look at the situation and we see Jonah he's gone the complete different route of what God told you headin and he heard God over here say go to Nineveh now what may tone of 8 that same God has put him over here what I'm gonna speak to him on the boat the road got to be played so don't get sunk a boat and to us if you looked like he backs it in hear him jump on that boat and not gosh shaking up the water why something had to be played out because Jonah had to play the role of a backslide but he was at a bachelor party so sometimes you can play a role but that's not who you really are let's look at a church he jumped on the boat and it looked like you know the water stock Giddings very shaky and the men on the boat start getting shook up and Jonah on the boats let me ask you something how many of you ever get good rest when you know you out of the will of God I don't know about you but when I doing wrong I don't get no rest so what was it about Jonah when he could get on the boat and go to sleep be confident everybody else shook up if you wrong God will not give you rest in your bag so Jonah didn't think he was back to me Rudi how could he have peace go on a direct opposite way of God to him the only way you can get pieces if God give it to you deviling or do you know pcs de tormenta husband so total of all these feet whoever in a boat shake what I think is just shaking obstacle like it was pressure you know Church the man come in the music in a time like this hey don't listen to me with your mind listen to me with your heart because you know when you roll you can't sleep huh you can't hardly eat that's if you love God you somebody playing Church you go out do all kind of crazy stuff and cookies like haha Lea Oh fake up but don't know headrests he's on the boat just relaxing toss it you know the man they experience it all the trouble so they come wake up Jonah is then - hey hey you hey do you realize what's going on call on your God Jonah's ain't no need for that throw me overboard and they're like don't you over playing he's in his role now she realized holy yeah I didn't miss uni Eliza cuz I'm out of the will of God if a child could ever get that revelation then you ain't the only one going through when you laugh no Paris I said yet defending you family members huddle charge bevels hallelujah don't know when y'all go I hear do stuff y'all represent hurry up here Bible truth and spiritual holy no they see the otic junk over there we followed him up cuz of the role you play you get on the internet and you make comments oh you represent in your church hey stop calling your pastor stop calling it pass to the police because of something you might like it don't get me wrong I got social media cheese but it gets on my nerves it's on my nerves hey they say they just all these internet preachers they say they just want to get out here and say something and try to draw people in all this stuff we got to be stronger not to get caught up in that father when they put stuff out and they asking questions you ought to say I don't know I don't know when keep moving when you're secure and where God is done let me say like this I've played the role of a council patient so you can't tell me God didn't play the role of a hero so no matter what kind of sickness you got you'll never be able to convince me that God can't heal you cuz I've already been in that scene and God ever save you by what we call this message you were dotted again and we was talking about me me me a jet was talking about I'll tell him I wasn't sometimes I'll just have another Becca Church talking about when him and sister Erica grounded a plane no I told Mike a woman in Memphis Tennessee that what you read about the proper deed is to say the miracle-working in here the same way it's the same garden oh so much so much has happened funny we've that time to entertainers foods God has been so real you've done so many supernatural things I don't have time to get caught up in previous file a I won't my way to happen and if I got to play the road somebody nice nasty if they give me to the rapture praise the Lord [Applause] what's a spiritual know-it-alls stay away from that person who ain't never roll cuz they are raised right I mean you can tell them they fit across the street and the bus coming at you till Hey look out for the bus I ain't coming boom see me cuz I'm nice nasty I see I thought it would come don't get me wrong I'm not one of those people like to say I told you so I just didn't play out let me get in since I don't want to be long tonight him I won't hit it and even gonna fly up idea huh the days of walking out of churches over it's time for us to fly you're not him should be so hot we don't wanna lose the people we have known in Cebu so high we walk out of here with the blessings of God in our hands hey it's too often we come to church with things are not hard and we leave with the same things on our heart we need church Jonah just showed that he was playing the role of a backslider he know he's on the boat the boats being on shook up he says hey throw me overboard I know what's going on and they like no no we're gonna get you out hey product put the sails up higher honey - told the guys to start rolling it rolling sails up higher the wind stopped in the water stop this is no we can't get out of here we can't get out of here he said I told y'all throw me overboard so finally they tied his hands they didn't just throw overboard they tied him up some of y'all need to tie up those loose seeds in your mind some of that used unbelieving either tied up cuz it's time to jump overboard with him shouting huh and they take him in a form of a board and as soon as he hit the water let's deal with the surface first doing gonna deal with the bottom on the surface that man who looked like a backslider as soon as he hit the water everything he had to play that role why for those men because those men wasn't in innovate but when you go back and read the Bible when Jonah hit the water they repented and offer sacrifice to the true and living God so Java had to play the role of a batch model because they were mean for Natasha that wasn't serving God like they supposed to so God had to use a man honey to play the role model but really was apostate to get these means to get back in their proper role because the controller was out of the will of God why he got all right have a special made system see we chose the situation before is over if you allow the winner God God we live round like a god save him because he was right where he was supposed to be the Bible says over in in verse 2 you sense Jonah says with my soul fainted within me I remember the law she says that's what we got to be in your darkest movie in your darkest hour you've got to remember you sir I said again this is the theme of my life I wake up and there's two things I say to myself one God cannot lock that do that don't do that self you realize that your God King lock that means is it in the Bible is truth that means you can't take it back that means don't sway to the left or the right that means it's a promise so I read it easy these things he said blessed is he who sins is forgiven that put me into a praise dance cuz I know I'm trying to live for the Lord when I like that so when I really seven skip does it just make me move a little bit partners I like come to church and wait for somebody to get it started out there I would get it started [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] he said I have a church with us my business or a cow to present to himself dealers with nobody else doing it by himself and you want me to dance in your church I'm sorry I'm one of them people who give you moves honey somebody tell not new that don't just belong to my mama she gave it to me I'm bowing them you know him praising - Minnie huh by them in the morning raisin with the silver bracelet with the hog wailing with the tones ladies a little hair Cap'n why you know what your feet lay low at the tone why did she the Lord let everything that has breath praise she's alone oh my man I'm running out of time all the time look Jolla had to play the role of a backslide to get these me who wasn't serving God I didn't supposed to but we're looking at it I know he was right with God water and then God puts them in the belly of a fish and journal begins to realize his error see God gotta get you in a place Holly way you can get back in your room you miss a couple lines hallelujah but God's sake these same lines waiting on you now go and rehearse and don't stop three say Solomon said whenever we look toward that temple that you were here I hope I see you heard those lines before honey so don't start rehearsing he's not praying right there in the red there in a bit of a wheel now how many of y'all pray some kind of weight don't like that loose he got loose in his bondage Karuna go ahead and play the rain God got a way to break every chain I said this before church think about heylia what we called to be the tambourine was created in a time of 400 years of bondage Miriam had a tambourine where did it come from it was created why they were in slavery because they had to play the role of someone that was insane but they still had instruments that we're going to dictate their future [Applause] it's a missile freedom instruments of worship and when they got on the other side of the Red Sea they brought those instruments that look like they were punish me honey and she stopped playing the instrument and they say all the tolerance of fire began to play their role hey Lucy huh but we look now it ain't over because John I have a role to play he couldn't go honey straight to Nineveh he had to go to tosha's for what the men on the boat see God had to get glory the Bible says those men offered sacrifice went down on the boat and say he serves the true and living God honey right there so to us you look like a bachelor but to him it looked like he was a man of God they didn't even care about the storm and ceasing and everything once everything was silent my donor is the intervener belly of a fish huh oh yeah a special fish hallelujah now the fish for some kind of weight you got directions turn Italy if Jonah was out of the will of God how does a fish know where God wants him to take Jonah the fish ain't got no mind but what we're saying the fish talk to God God's in control some kind of way God orchestrated all of this so he could keep glory but look at the idea brother in Here I am honey kill him man get scenes get in the fish honey we start to pray fish start going a little vague next thing you know funny the fish is like oh I'm sick I think I'm gonna stop right here I can't smell no more I'm tired I think I'm gonna stop right here and just so happen is right there had nothing now what's so powerful about that when you do your research we know that the people that literally worship the fish God I thought he was out of the will of gosh no he was playing a role he had to play that role so he could look like he was the fish guy Oh fish stop open his mouth people worship the fish car but a man a man with dust and the Lord telling the people to repent hey how can a backslider please repentance what was happening Church God was getting lonely out in the whole thing [Applause] somebody needed to play their role so ahead to play the room let alone of a backslider did he play the role of a fresh guy so God to get the glory you know what happened out of that it was the greatest revival ever recorded by one crossing over 250,000 people got saved in that one scene by me now how you gonna be out of the will of God and God weren't like that see don't judge it before it's over let's read a little bit in here and then I'm gonna get out you me honey this is her she says Jonah was it out just in case just in case y'all think the same in the message [Music] God said there's a profitable reason go go go go back and read your Bible Paul talks about the manifestation of this time that they waited for it for years but now we got how do you talk the Proms old he's old Daniel and different ones write it up don't know he say he's a filling up done right but in how are there honey is God opened the book God told us about honey let me tell you how important the seals are hugging God sending God sending a vindicated prophet now I don't know too many people that have ever wont written books or preached on the seven seals or the church changes I don't know too many people but I know there's some out there but the significance of it is how what's written changed the lives of the people that's when you know there's a real inspiration behind it and you know turns every plea of men who wanted to write about the seals and this blew me away when I heard just Hudler I was watching a documentary on on the oil what happened in Waco Texas I'm in the back some of y'all may be too young but Waco Texas there was a man hugs I forget his name but he called he wasn't David Koresh this man called himself a price this man honey went it's hard to say that he was Jesus he was Jesus what blew me away I remember back in the days when he saying Jesus I think Holly we actually met the man in Daytona Beach because we're falling with the Texas I think is a Daytona Beach and a friend of mine hunting wheels hustles back in freedom I went up to him and try to sell him some openness some opening shades 300 on shaking $80 some you know you're helpful you can't get all your money back but are you trying to get the money back what up - hey I want to say you say you how about the shaving man look at me saying I can't put those shades on my eyes because people can't see the Jesus in Jesus I ain't never felt like that but you know anyway this man how you say he was Jesus and all these things and blah blah blah he was playing a role but sometimes you can see a people play a role and you'll see that role don't sit in they doing something just don't feel right to me I hate Heights and I found that you know they shouldn't be doing it but it just don't sit right cuz we just had a and 70th birthday party my mom and it was a fullback 70 style so you know we had to put on stuffing these clothes you know some of y'all in the back but we had to put on some seven disclosure house to house the house it away by Alison ago John Travolta disco stop get me a white polyester suit oh I ready to do my fame but you know it was all in fun Christian atmosphere that's the problem people can't be Christians and enjoy themself we're all tight early I do that people don't think it's gonna tell Who I am when it's when the sky is cracking oh yeah but you know there's death there's a time in a place don't get me wrong but you know I didn't do it like that I just you know we can either dress up like there you go get your tie-dyed shirt or you know different things like that's what I did is I I wouldn't got me one of them to Rome we'd put them afro okay I got me a throw and put it on got me a tie-dye shirt and I already had the shades like prints cuz you know we did that's already back in style so you know I had that already but I was severing his bow but you know why we were waiting on my mom I had on all that gear you know portraying like I was from the 70s y'all I was sweating I was getting hot uncomfortable staying with itch in my head I'm trying to hold on you know what was happening I wasn't comfortable being an impersonator I wasn't confident play the role of something I'm not and I tried to hold it hold on says they even had one of them with to the African store and got me one of them one of them bees with the cross oh look that you know what you're doing doing certain things ain't nobody got ten you and everyone you know yourself so you know but I'll say I just won't mama to have a good laugh you know I mean I just wanna have a good laugh you know some people looked at me as a birdís you go to Fox I mumble I have a good lover take nacho us let me play the role for how I learned about you loose with Mama so anyway you know I got to stuff all I got to play Church I'll get so hot and thank each meal where I sit down I just got me a spot and I just started chili cuz he like the more I move the more I wanted to come on in so finally mama came you know and she surprised I heard a grand till then gave a hug and went to the bathroom for all so I could be myself see one thing about playing a role when you know your impersonate is gonna come to near because you can't hold out much longer it's gonna come to here well you know you may really say like you're supposed to be it's gonna come to in here when I say that to say Church huh yeah when we look in the scripture and we see that there were all kind of roles being played hung up Rahab played the role of Muhammad but she wasn't really a hard enough she was out in the prostitution and she and she she she gave up her cell she did all these things for a purpose why so God could get glory hurry up they look down and they criticize they call her they call all kind of name they call a prostitute now she played the role of a prostitute you should really work well the one that was gonna let the seed of Jesus Christ come through her body polio for a lot of people just think before it happens he said that God is willing if we are willing but we have our possibly this individual has a practically I can no more make a revival catches now I can never make a revival out of it or a meeting than nothing and no one individual or no just two people three of you how you three of you it'll take all of us see that you want to see in your church you've got to be a part of it you can't just put on a pressure on the ministry all the musicians or whatever you got a neighbor play honey and when you think about playing a role honey you gotta have those token things just so he could get glory Oh God amen when we look we look how how he changed man this was a promise a republic God said he said and God what what he does he just changes himself to be come to that generation to make know himself to that people holier so for every generation God changes his manage to fit the needs of the people so the need of those people the need of you and I what we're striving for perfection I'm not striving for just to be justified no we got that boy ain't striving for sanctification we know how to dress I ain't striving for gifts we got gifts in our life what I'm striving for the home I'm striving for the perfection hallelujah and we look at it there's a role to be played everybody has a role to be played and I want you to understand when you play a role it has to be in sync think about it we get up here musicians come it's only to come and we start singing a song and I'm in the key of C and then the kid elf song that's gonna sound like a mess because somebody ain't playing in Rome right you know musician can look at me and they say but I ain't built like that I can't play that role so they have to be able to hire you forget about their own home and help me with mine and then we all get blessed sometimes you got to forget about yourself and place for that person you know is in need hunger and either everybody get blessed earlier such as we've got to work as a team hariya look like i just said about Rahab she look like she was a prostitute but God was working things all in it like I said last night honey God took a three days journey and made it 40 years probably God say was three to five days to get to the promised land why did it take 40 years you say cause the people who complain is old somebody played that role somebody say I'm hungry they had to play that role and God dropped the bread down film they stopped you don't want you eat all that bread you get thirsty and there's somebody say how thirsty you ain't first yeah I'm thirsty stop the whole church again see all these roles had to be played Moses goes over the islands ticket wait no more than we need to get off a Golden Calf all these things had to be played just flow the church up why did God slow the tree allowed the church to be strong he couldn't just kill everybody they leaned over there but he had certain rules they had to be playing that this brings us to Rahab God could not let it go three days or five days because they were got there in three days or five days way that wasn't born yet so if we're having boiled hot Jesus Christ won't come to see if we haven't bought a know both hands they know Ruth may have a boy they know over they know Jesse there ain't no David there ain't no Jesus so God sometimes gosh rolling it up because some people ain't in position yet sometimes it look like things ain't happening church like it supposed to God intention is showing it up cuz we won't change into position we listen when things happen honey best thing for us to do is just be quiet go pray because you know come down we can no no you just pray better yet call that person and encourage them play a room cuz we want God to get glory right listen the public God say he said he's saying he said uh he said why did God let this happen he told my hoots with my Abraham listen a man listen April help everybody all right listen God's o Abraham hey you the Father faith you gonna have a child and then all of a sudden Pharaoh come up she saying yeah we have a child but it's gonna be through Hagar why did God let that happen why do you let that happen because there had to be some kind of opposition cuz so God could show how great he is in his elected church so they had to be a group of false belief had to be some false roles being played people that say they services let's say they dollars and it really ain't remember chance either you're gonna play the role of good on the role of band Judas played the role of a devil it was he really the devil yeah that spirit all he played the role and as in that spirit left what he did kill herself because once he realized what he did he came to his senses so he wasn't really a devil he just played the room you have to be careful what kind of spirit you let lead listen Abraham Sarah they marching Holly they're going the next thing you know honey we think they walk down here this a young king young king sees them but the phone even even see Sarah Abraham picked it up in the spirit so ever ham changed man right the same ain't your husband ain't you later I'm you I'm you on your brother she changed man he changed roles he changed role he said they gonna kill me they don't want to kill me because you knew my wife whatever and it's been said that back in those days and customs when the king wanted a woman it didn't matter who you would he kill you and take your life and Abraham feared that so he changed massively Abraham's egg good good see in the midst of him changing roles he forgot to give God glory because if you were really caught it here to see that severals in position now to have a baby but because of his own fears he put on the wrong mask hi Lisa he went from husband to brother which they actually was system brother but that wasn't the time for him to be a brother no he was supposed to be husband but he stepped back into a role that was paid out [Music] [Applause] don't live in a scene that's already been acted out radio part that's now play the part that the church needs now you step back into something you used to be see at one point he loves her brother but now who's supposed to be acting as her husband but what I love about God God say I'm gonna get glory I love huh so God let the man honey looks at said he looked at grandma support grandma good I got the help well that must stop this she's hot stepping up in the kingdom so he'd go down there ground nobody gonna get away with this everybody played a role role so he comes and he meets the man at night he says hey he says hey give that man give that man back his wife he told Abimelech give them my lord know what what do you mean you know the integrity of my heart meaning tamanna he told me that was his sister god I don't care what he told you God putting him in his right place now everybody got the wrong way from God on straighten stuff out Wow because God knew if they were in the wrong way he like a liar God ain't gonna let you get away with something make him look bad [Applause] [Music] go ahead already said you gonna have a baby by Sarah so God had to come in and strike not to see so God comes down and said give them back or you a good as a day not you know the integrity of my hájek that's why I stopped you because you've gone I'm a kid God can change man's too huh he went from grace to judgment holy just like that you know God straightens everything oh yeah he gives Sura back to Abraham honey Abimelech is all right everything is safe because God had to put it in the law and sometimes we were stepping do things don't worry about what people say God Street see we say we say we say uh-uh why the Prophet Sawa's and why did God allow that to happen because God had list several roles play out in the scriptures so we have faith that he can straighten it out now I'm closing honey listen I want you to understand about the rules in our lives certain things happen oh yeah hope y'all don't mind I'm I'm a person of I had to do a real life situation and I'm sorry but I got to go out there the new answer you think about all the years Rachel pray let's pray say Lord I'm ready you know no doubt so many young fellas me of Cain is five there they played the role of Stephen but they had the wrong name see in God's eyes God already knew who she was supposed to be with so you had some guys come and play the role her and some even they'll sound convincing and even when even when maybe Rachel man without was seeing things she was supposed to see because she was in that time or in that moment maybe sister Tina saw and she'd go up play home girl wasn't mama girl some roll with him don't you mess what what touchy go to who is faster so she shined light on something that right you can see about the script her because she's in her role as a protector hallelujah and you know maybe one bounce around someone come back he smiling happy here in church how do you know he got his eyes on y'all y'all look at all spiritually you know maybe he didn't snapchat live he didn't even talk to him Instagram or whatever he sneaking around whatever you get the church had it all spirits and hold plant Aloha glory but Jack kissters he planned a religious role but there's somebody who knew about God's brewery and he's looking at the young man he said well something right something right I know you want to talk young man just hold up let's go out to eat all these roles had to play so we could see what we saw two weeks ago y'all understand how do you Steve it was all this way to be a successful football player here and the role of a football player but no gosh I'm gonna put that to the ear that ain't what I want you to be and one day he was like that ain't nobody here ain't nobody touches all of a sudden is back star what did you back you back you want no hit ain't nobody blindside of nut he's there all of a sudden cuz God wanted to change rules see God had to get him away from that rail hugger so he could start directing he nobody get bodied thing you know your role you play your role the same way every time but the thing of it is you got to understand honey that it ain't them they just doing what they call together sometimes we get mad at people when they playing their role no doubt I know people think about me and my mission you gonna like me you can hate me cuz I ain't gonna fight on state god I'll tell him I'm glad you to pass tonight cuz God know who can deal with the people I'll be like oh my god and hate me like I can see myself not sitting down and husband and wife sessions and the wives hung up just be quiet let the man talk like man you know you were living your wife better y'all know what time here see God know who can play those roles right honey yeah and it don't make you a less of a person if you can't do what that person do you're just not assigned to that role in the body I'm closed let me close very close I hope everybody got the gist of what I'm saying [Applause] listen oh my I want to hit this real quick and you know again I want a guy he said God will never you can never exhaust God's love and mercy to you you say well I hate to bother you so much father he wants to be bothered that way he does know don't never think that you could ever exit much of God I believe the scripture says you have not because you ask not and you ask not because you believe me now what I'm doing I'm quoting the prophet and the Prophet is quoting the Bible so let me ask this what's the problem what's the problem home the Prophet always brought us to the Bible so if I read a poem is biblically inspired he said he won't son and besides when you go beyond the curtain of time hallelujah and the people hardly are saying this the people are talking to you in the saying you know I'm one of your comfort than what an Angels talking to you but with people funny the people talking you let me to cut when I was just 19 years old listen that lonely steep beginner actually say well I want to see the Lord say where he's in a higher realm you know it was two people talking to him his converse hallelujah Church and then utilizing without and everything and he says well we were parlor his groupie there and he talking they talking all the stuff him to come at the Bible and all these things let's get back to the Bible at all always in the Bible even he confessed that he was reaching out in the Bible cuz when when they said that he several Paul's groupies there he said they said they said yes he said cuz I preached the same thing he preached and the people we as we said we're resting on that because we're not depending on the words of brother Branham we were preaching the Word of God play the role or play it right we don't rush of the man we stick with the Word of God and he wasn't a Bible based people we wouldn't be following him we're resting on I want you to catch he say he wants us to ask and believe that our choice would be full he wants you to ask abundantly and acts big things don't let your faith oh yeah he said don't limit your faith to some little mustard seed he said get out there how do you say he said get out here to some kind of faith and move out into big things did you hear me big things let me finish look the proper God says he says you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering then this is the just of what I'm talking about and I'm gonna leave it alone he said they couldn't see that God's love he said but they felt that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with no parental care that God said his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact they were chosen to salvation because God had chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth he say that listen to this church we talked about God choosing you in his love Hanyu and what he's committed us to the role we must play listen touch he says he said he may commit you to death as he did Paul Paul understood his role when Paul II told no no gonna see they say for this purpose I came he knew it wrong Church he didn't shout out from getting whipped and scarred and all these things says he won't happen of New Testament in jail that was his role he wasn't thinking about his own way of being church he was so locked up in his word one winter you say hello yeah can you bring me a coat that man knew his room he says he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did Joe Joe had to play a role honey lost his money lost his cattle lost his children lost his wife knows all his friends you're playing a role why so God could get glory so that all that he loves you've never seen one time this guy will commit you to so he can get glory but you don't choose that hunger is God's choosing listen he says he is how easy that is his hunger prerogative he is sovereign but in all with the purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of

[Music] Oh [Applause] Oh so great Oh we shake the lord of the Lord's at night play your role 1 a a wonderful wonderful fountain there and just my mother digs just went in picked up Jonah and shown us that he was always in the public will of God everything that he was doing God had ordained you know and I believe the scripture tells us that the steps of the righteous are hoarded up alone so even when you and a backslidden state dog has don't get some glory out of that right he's gonna get some glory out of that and even when we've done wrong God's gonna get some glory out of that and I was just grateful you know using that going through Jonah I remember you know that I was coming from church I grew up and this a man of temping Pentecostal churches that you know they preach about Jonah he was always in fact slit prophet but it was only the prophet of God that I ever heard say no no he was not on the will of God he was he was right in the perfect will of God and you know I've never heard anybody bring out that the people of Nineveh actually saved the fish dog so when this fish got sick and decided to take a detour because he didn't have any intelligence of his own but he just stood up on the shores of Nineveh and when it gets there here they worship in the fish garden and he opens his mouth and out comes das prophet with the message of repentance only God to orchestrate something like that my I just I mean oh and when I heard the message brother branham brought that out I have never heard anybody bring that out before so I know you know this message is nothing but rules them in church don't don't don't don't don't be fooled by anything you hear anything you see I don't internet everybody's just playing a role and about this playing a role and we got we got some believers trying to go to Tarsus God somehow someway don't get into minima so I'd say what we just don't trust God we won't keep sodium monkey blessing and you know just doing all we can a brother Diggs we appreciate you tonight to mentor Lord the love of sin Russian I want to say something you know we are we are people we're not we're not a denomination you know and people like brother deeds if he was in denomination denominations would take care of Misenum all over the world that's what they would do for denominations but as believe is we got to learn to be sensitive to the Spirit of God and the voice of God that would speak to us you know sometimes when we have ministers these full-time in ministry right it's full-time in ministry and and with churches you know we certainly give love offers two different evangelists and everything that would come through but I want to showers the church sometime y'all be one of them people that can call them on the phone Wally at the airport I said I want to send you something be one of them kind of people that God has speak to you in that manner and you know and and and just do something special some time for somebody right and then I want to challenge you to do that and I thought sometimes you know we're faith when I given you know to the Lord and to the church saw that that's give us some time God want you to just do a little bit extra please the Lord a man so I want I want to just encourage you you know and actually I'm gonna do something I'm gonna do something I don't do this I don't normally do but I'm gonna do it tonight because I thought the Holy Spirit telling me to do it right we go we go we don't give everybody an opportunity to give an offering to support brother DS that's what we don't do all right we don't give anybody a chance and we now shout that we don't jump we don't praise God when I say hey man are we gonna do something to help keep this gift out on the field is that we gonna do that so I'm like why

try to do that tonight so that as the people just give from obedience we don't do this normally but we felt but we felt Lord just led by the spirit to do this tonight he didn't ask for it to be done and I know Lord that sometimes things like that happened it might even embarrass them that's not what we're trying to do God but we want to show our love we want to show our appreciation we want to show our respect to this gift of God's but I'm a witness that you have called this man the things that you've done amen for him through him to him but we know that it's been your mighty hand the devil

and amen god bless you just give as the Lord would lead you amen and we'll go from there I wanted to just quickly to share a man of testimony you know some of you all might not know this a man but um but if they see often shares about the cancer a man that he he had in his brain and that was just that was on that was just one testimony right that was just one testimony and but there was a time for the digs before he went into full time ministry the Lord the Lord sent him the Florida - brother smiley church and he came he came and he preached as a blind man we saw him blind come up to the pulpit pretty much happened to be laying up here to the pulpit and all the time his eyes were open is when he opened up his Bible and he's there many preached and when he closed the Bible he had to be led off the pulpit that's his chair and we watched this you know and my heart just went went out to him when I when I saw us awhile it's just hard to believe this you know that this was happening and he was out there for the smilers and you know we come back our hearts broken and the very next day they went out to eat at Golden Corral and brothers brother smiley played the part he put a real difficult part brother these could see and brother thigs wanted something from them from the bar up there at Golden Corral and brother smiley total state now better if you know that we're not going to get it for you all you got to go get it yourself so brother they say okay if it's gonna be like that it's gonna be like that I'll go get it myself he went to the bar got his food in this I stayed open ever since that time [Music] but the purpose why God allowed him to go through that is because God was actually making things uncomfortable for him actually made forced him off his job they had to fire him because he couldn't see he was drugged driving forced him off the job and forced him into full-time ministry and we had been enjoying this gift of God when he's 20 years and I'm grateful Church I'm grateful you know I you know even even we talk about the miracles and everything that God's prophet you know performed in different different testimonies we got some personal testimonies right amongst us proving that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and I'm gonna tell you any time you are you know anybody that might you might run subscribe they're down you know that whether God is a healer whether God does things or whatever anytime you hear brother Dave's coming to town get that person to church they can see a living miracle right before their eyes I'm not talk about one miracle multiple miracles that God has performed in this man's life he don't share them all the time but I I'm an eyewitness I know what God did God healed a blind man God healed a blind man we saw it with our own eyes you know if so when I see when I see that I know the devil don't like him but then we're gonna fight him but you know what else I know that there was a liar
