never heard any Minister actually bring out before and one of those things was with the scriptures say the kingdom of God suffered the violence and the violent take it by force they were saying the reason that it was such a you know a clash at that time is because the dispensation was changing from law to grace and because of that change of dispensation you know that the kingdom of God was suffering violence and I said man that was a really good you know good point and I love the way you know that all together so he's gonna be coming tonight a man to bless our hearts and we just want to

be in the house of the Lord tonight and then I truly solicit your prayers tonight God is still working on me Amen names who you notice just double always fighting him this is a kind of a different type of battle that I'm not quite used to so you know pressure I've never been one to be nervous not too much in front of people but uh I know when you're bringing the word for his bride it's a little different you know you taking a look very serious so it's a different kind of pressure so I definitely solicit your prayers and the devil is constantly fighting and giving you my best room one time I didn't know what the ministers to be referring to what I cannot know it's a it's a battle amen so I just pray that uh something to be said to encourage your hearts to strengthen you a man that we may see the hour in which we're living in and have a better understanding of a man him in this hour just leave encouraged and uh am I ready to do battle it's ready to do battle you know so we definitely live in a time you know we're in a in a great battle a man the Satan desired to be to hinder and to confuse people and it lifts up himself anything that above above God a man and that's that's what he's trying to do when a men and and we're doing just the opposite so there's always been a great contention a man and we just want to be able to a man be encouraged to just fight on it maybe we're not going to sink into mo we will go straight to the word I to open your Bibles I'm gonna take my time a man tonight if that's alright because I don't want to feel too rushed I feel like I'm among family and friends so I can try to just relax myself and compose myself and just deliver what was on what's on my heart and tell you what if I can deliver it the way I received it and it would be a real blessing to you I'm sure a man was gonna take it from the last time from Matthew 11 chapter in eleventh and twelfth verse and we're going to go to Luke 16:16 and we're going to just go from there I'm trying to make all this fit you see I'm I'm not quite as a few later so I don't have my tablet now that I got old school and I brought my big Bible this time so you know so I can see so I'm just trying to feed everything up here on the platform on me man Matthew 11:11 there's barely I say unto you among them that are born of woman there have not risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding that he is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he and from that day of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force command if we just go over to Luke 16:16 amen Matthew Luke seeing the same saying the same thing just saved a different way to say the law and the prophets were untrue John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it for is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than one tittle of the law to fail a man may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word now let us pray most gracious Heavenly Father dear God we just come before you Lord God just ask you to just have your way Lord God Lord you know the needs upon the heart Lord of the people of Lord Lord you know Lord God the need or father God that's before us in this our Lord Lord just looking at how the inspiration and things have been going on father God it just Lord God may I just fall right into that channel Lord God Lord God use my lips Lord my voice Lord for your glory Lord and you hide me behind the cross Lord Lord I'm reminded your prophets say that the gift is to get out of the way the Lord is not I but he that dwelleth on the inside and Jesus precious name Amen you may be seated man so we find a man that this passage of Scripture that I read that that that the kingdom of God a man a minute there's going to be resistance that there's something that this battle started long before we got here amen this battle started in in heaven amen and Lucifer was was kicked out of heaven amen and God had a will for man on the earth and the battle just came down to earth and just continued a man so this is not new this this battle has been going on this battle is going to continue and after we leave here amen so we have to choose this day whom we going to serve we have to be willing a man to to fight in this out we have to be willing to give up something this this walk is not a flowery bed of these amen we put it one way that we talked last week about you being enlisted into an army and man how the government they call the military people GIS amen and how this day God urg is for God a man of government issues but we are God issue amen so we're definitely in a battle but we have chose to be on the winning side on the lower side amen the kingdom of God amen you see that uh it's always been God's desire and his will to rule and reign a man as King a man ever since the fall in the Garden of Eden a man his desire was to dwell in his people a man so the question is the kingdom of God the Bible says that kingdom of God is within you a man so his desire is to to rule and reign in your heart I believe God is looking for people today that is totally sold out to him Amen that that it we're living at a time that when when Jesus was here amen and and and and and and he died on Calvary Amen that we may have a chance at eternal life because he there was a time us being as Gentiles a man was not privy they meant to - there's good news a man we we were we were on the outside but because of what happened at Calvary amen we now have this opportunity amen we we might call it this dispensation of grace amen and I thank God for this time that he allowed us a man to be grafted in today men that we may do his will that we may manifest him again you know I look around and I look and I am and I wonder you know will change his brother branham left you know you had the great revival was going on and amen there were tent revivals and people filled up churches by the hundreds if not the thousands but now we see that what happened to the love God the people are so lost in this hour I believe what they need to see is God manifested once again the Bible talks about how the whole world is groaning and travailing for the manifestation of the sons of God hey man but you see we have to be tested we have to go through something he has to know that he can trust us with his work he has to know that we have faith amen now in order for them it meant to be a kingdom a man there must be a king you know crisis that came a man when we know that he is in his word a man y'all Bear Whitman now amen there are things that we're going to have to be willing to go through to press means to a force against in opposition and the violent means those who oppose all opposition and force who will seize and press their way into the kingdom of God at any cost violence me free that again are those who will oppose all opposition and force who were seized and press their way into the kingdom of God at any cost amen amen the title of the message is confronting the opposition amen so I want to just keep that in mind that we're pressing our way into the kingdom and in doing so we are confronting the opposition insinuating that there's a battle going on all the time the Prophet talking about the Battle of the the place of battle is in our mind amen we always are going to be that's where the devil meets our saying that's where the war starts so is the battle is within us amen Jesus gave us all kind of examples and we'll go through those example of how we fight a man he says that this is not a battle against flesh and blood but against principalities and spiritual wickedness in high places amen amen let us saw Ephesians 6 shot that a tenth verse a man and I trust when we we get here it'll be encouraging I'm gonna take my time and I'm gonna get there amen Ephesians the sixth chapter the tenth verse amen and finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that ye may be able to stand the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places and now we see we're not fighting your brother and sister our battle is not not against a flesh-and-blood a man but it's the Word of God and those that would oppose the Word of God amen so we're confronting the opposition that Christ may rule and reign amen the general in an army a man he he's not going down and battling for himself he has soldiers and men that he sent out on the battlefield a man he he must train them a man he take the time to train his soldiers he take the time to make sure that his soldiers are fully prepared that they have everything that they need that they have enough ammunition that they have their boots that they have their helmet that they have a bulletproof vests and Men everything that they will need while they are on the battlefield and man that we see here God says to put on the whole armor of God a man that we are ready for the battle because we end up we in the battlefield amen amen but again like I say the place of battle is in your mind amen many times you will see that the Lord will be speaking to a person's heart Amen through the preaching of the gospel amen and immediately you feel that tug in your heart and immediately Satan to come to your mind and and and start bombarding your mind with all kind of salts these people looking at me from all kind of crazy things he'll put you your children on your mind it'll put the job on your mind anything that he can to distract you from God target on your heart amen let's go over here to acts the second chapter Amen leave me Holy Ghost amen acts the second chapter and we're gonna read here from the 21st verse and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as ye yourself also know him being delivered by the determinate counsel did that by the determinate counsel and the foreknowledge of God he have taken and by wicked hands crucified and slain whom God has raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holding of it and I will go down here to the 37th verse now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you for the remission Viva every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for this promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off and as many as the LORD thy God shall call now I want to refer you back to the 21st verse and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved and he said here in the 3rd of 9 that this promises unto you and as many as the LORD thy God shall call I'm reminded to probably say that you can't come until he called you amen you can't come until he called you so as many as the LORD thy God shall call Peter and the brethren the Apostle stood up and preached the gospel and we see that the preaching of the gospel the hearts was stirred by the preaching of the gospel and they wanted to tell what must we do what must we do and we can have this eternal life amen he said repent see when their heart was free the prophets taught us that a godly sorrow worketh repentance it has to be a godly sorry you can't just say something like your mouth or not meaning it has to be from the heart amen and their hearts were pre their hearts were troubled and he said what must I do be the laid it out to him repent every one of you in the name of the Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins a man who says and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost with his promises unto you and to your children and to all that afar off even as many as a Lord that God shall call a man and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save good save yourselves from this untoward this generation amen so we see that the heart was stirred amen but the minute that their hearts were stirred you know here comes the enemy starts speaking to your mind the greatest battle ever fought the Prophet told her that that was a mistake that evening that she just stopped for a little while and began to reason with the devil see he came to her and she began to have conversation with him and and and and and he got in the head she began to reason in our mind you shall not surely die and and the Prophet brought out how this man this beast he was a beautiful fellow he wasn't no ugly fellow he had six-pack ABS big masculine gentleman spoke smooth probably had a look sway in his walk and spokes him you shall not surely die amen and that's how the double do today he's not gonna see he he was the most beautiful angel so he knows you see the devil is really a one-trick pony he's really a one tree party once you once you figure out his best moves you got him figured I cuz he gonna come the same way every time he gonna come with the same tricks every time and you know I've the beautiful thing about it it's the same thing that defeat him every time the Word of God the same thing that defeated every time but see what he tries to doing this hour is he's the author of confusion if he can take one word and twist it it's powerless he'll take it and tell you the days of miracles are in pants God is not doing that anymore oh it don't take all of that you can come to church as you are you can God is concerned about what's on the inside so you can dress how your water these are the things that oh my Satan is poisoning the people taking their weapons from him I think you can't stand you know got nothing to stand on it's like you're going into battle God gave you swore it Sean and it's got a good balance to it and you keep chopping away at that school and making it shorter now you going into battle with a kitchen knife cause you know you don't you don't took away from it and took away from it now you got to get all up on the enemy to try to do damage when he gave you swore that a reach way into eternity then every swayin little pass anything that kind of just swing and swing and you kill thousands of Philistines Oh mine I'm reminded about a samson a great way in his own right he was called a man to kill that was his whole purpose Philistines but he allowed himself for his allowed his weapon to be cut same thing the double is doing the day by Jezebel we just gotta change the barrel spirit the daughters and the mother the people thinking that they're right it's not their uh you know my heart goes out and my wife was discussing you know she started out on a new job and and and lord knows I don't like a driving on that road and so but it was just something how this job came about a praying I lost a lawyer I don't know why you got her going down there and I say you know and she's I don't like it I said we're trying to figure out a ways and maybe a train cuz I just don't like a tribe of traveling that road every day and you know this came to me I said lord I don't know you maybe you got a diner for a reason maybe there's a seed of God down there in that building or somewhere that that uh the tender hand of Jehovah a man got a manifested daughter of God Amen that somebody can see Christ on display and 2018 go see that so read 2018 I mean we there was a move in 1963 in nineteen in 2018 oh man it's the tables are full of vomit there's nothing out there oh my so she will she say you know yeah I was I was then I overheard these people talking and they did was talking she said well I think they was talking about lunch and then the lady would uh said well I can't I can't now because I'm fasting she's over maybe and the lady and she saw Harold Bob Dolf earrings and I'm fasting fasting - what fasted for I mean but it's just like that that the fact that the lady is fasting for something and then to look at the condition they just breaks your heart that people are so confused in this out they think they're serving God but they're just doing the opposite so I'll share let's see what just she say oh that's what you mean confronting the opposition I said that's exactly what I'm talking confront the opposition you will be the light you'd be the example that she need to see one day they're gonna ask my notice you know well make up the earrings I noticed you just a little different I notice your conversation is a little different and she look at herself and then she may look at you and say my wait a minute wow we're so different see you confronting the opposition confronting the opposition Satan is trying to keep her confused but you right there if kindness and then wisdom not being unwise and brutish look here you need to take this off and you need to take that off and you need to do this and you need to do that no just live a life if the so does life loss is savor what good is it make them thirsty say something different about my god that's like these brothers here in acts a heard the preaching of the word and their hearts were free and through your life reading a pistol read of all men they may say the heart might be pretty well what is it about you have an opportunity to take your word and give the government good whack give the devil is good way amen amen amen confront the opposition a man turn with me to Luke 4 Luke the fourth chapter and there we're going to see a man our perfect example how Christ confronted the opposition a man Luke the fourth chapter and starting at the first verse and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness being forty days tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hunger amen and the devil said unto him if thou be the Son of God command these stones that it be made bread and jesus answered him saying it is not written it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God amen now we see that Christ a man was being tested a man just like we have to be tested a man he went through the same things a man that we would go through a man we see that a man the devil Satan tempted him a man to turn a man the stones to bread a man for he hungered after fasting for forty days no doubt he was extremely hungry and no doubt that it may have been tempted a man but Jesus confronted him with the Word of God it is written a man that man should not live by bread alone that test a man is to prove a man that a man you have to have faith in God a man being a man the man Christ Jesus he in his mortal body now he couldn't take on the test as God because he could have just destroyed scene but him being Christ Jesus the man he had to fight as a man as a man would fight so he fought with the word he had to have faith that my God shall supply all my needs according to his riches in glory I don't need you Satan to give me anything consider the fowl of the air he doesn't hunt neither does he gather but he eat every day a man my God will provide for me so what is he looking for faith your faith is being tested yeah I'll turn these stones to bread no my daughter supply I'm gonna stand on the word I'm not going to go down hidden rob the stove I'm not going to cause I want it's cause I'm hungry I'm not gonna go and do something I know that's wrong I'm gonna stand on the Word of God I may not have any groceries in the house I may be hungry but I'm not gonna break god's word to feed this flesh gotta supply my knees see that was the test well you trust God oh my he had to be tested the same tests that we're going through hey man a man will you have faith in God Hebrews keep the finger there Hebrews the twelfth chapter says no chastening for the present seemeth joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness now listen unto them which are exercised thereby see your faith has to be exercised your faith has to be challenged and see when your faith is challenged and you stand on the Word of God you come out just a little bit stronger you trust just a little bit more if my wife asked me to do something and I do it well what does that do it increases of confidence in me that well I asked him to do this this time and he did it and I actually will do that the next time and he came through so what all coffee you have no problem coming to me saying honey I need you to do this for me cuz she got confidence that he came through before that he'll come through again our faith has to be exercised has to be tried and tested a man stick Whitman we going somewhere a man the second test the devil taking him unto the high mountain showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whom so ever I will give it if thou therefore will worship me all shall be thine and jesus answered and said get thee behind me Satan for it is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shall I serve amen the second test a man we realize that your motive and objection have to be right see what the devil was trying to do was test Christ you want to be king I give you Kingdom I'll give you all the riches of the world if you just worship me he'll give it not a proper book the kingdom of this world they are his they all here is the guild yes sir but why would you give me something that I'm just going to take later see your motive and your objection have to be right if he was a man that was power-hungry a man wanted esteem more than wanting the wheel of God and may seem pretty tempting but he attacked him with the Word of God you see so many times today that preachers won't preach the Word of God because of the fear of losing membership you can't tell me they don't see this stuff in the word you see everything else but you looked at it in the congregation other people and they look just like Jezebel you afraid you afraid that you will lose your membership means that you won't tell the people the truth you won't confront the opposition because you agreed the love of money the love of power of prestige my god that Jezebel spirit that great hall and her daughter's again we go back to Samson son took his locks he's powerless and I'm puff his eyes out he can't even see anymore hey man but what's milord a man so a man a son or daughter God as they just lead me to the pillows young man you say that though everybody's here the Prophet brought out and that was just a cruel celebration it was Satan celebrating victory over God the Philistines threw off party celebrating a victory over God how sad how ignorant is he say they were celebrating and drinking and reveling and going on say they fail to see Samson tears streaming and those kept these suckers from where dad poked his eyes out him over their lips moving praying to himself Lord God I'm so sorry forgive me Lord if you just give me one more chance I'll be willing to die with the Philistines see we have to be willing to die we have to be willing to fight at all costs a good soldier on the battlefield is willing to give up his life knowing he may not make it back home but he has to fight anyway Oh Samson just said if you just leave it to those pillows and lord I just feel the strength coming back and by just you just push those pillars down and killed moe Philistines amen but he died himself with the Philistines amen I'm reminded that in these tests in order to be promoted you have to go through the battle we have an uncle as they didn't know that it's pretty hide in the military and I remember that a few promotions ago he had the education he had everything he passed the tests but he couldn't be promoted so he said you haven't been in battle you haven't been in battle so him being having favor with God they put him in a battle they sent him to Jamaica now I don't know what battle was over in Jamaica that sounded like a vacation more than a battle but from what I thought they said was the uprising in Jamaica and you had he had to go that should make this quilt is uprising so he put on his guild had a helmet all grabbed his gun and went into battle maybe took a cruise ship back I don't know but he had to go in the battle he had to have battle tested on his resume to get this next promotion amen and what I'm trying to say is we have to be battle tested each time we go through a battle and we come out on the other side victorious we promote it just a little high what is it your faith is your badge yo stripes is your faith Amen of the general no doubt now you see him he's got patches pins everywhere son of God that's the bit through the battle Purple Heart sleeve showing that he's been through some and he come out victorious that this person is that have we proven that they can stand the test a real soldier and man is ranked higher you say to that person you kick yes her that's her I see you've been through something and you're still holding up the blood-stained banner a man what a mighty warrior four-car seeing uh Hebrews I'm sorry mmm thank you Lord a scripture I'm looking for here man I could quote it but I would rather read it a man who just blessed my soul man and I thought I wrote it down and I probably did they didn't have their with me it made you love the Lord a man try not to feed before you too long but I ain't gonna let the devil this is just too rich it's just too rich and I just appreciate any man Amen Hebrews 11 thank you Jesus 24 amen Hebrews 11 24 says our faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the five the Pharaoh's daughter choosing now he had a choice but he chose rather to suffer the afflictions with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season I want to stop right there I want to just say one thing the pleasures of sin make no mistake about it seeing its pleasurable sin is pleasurable why because there's no opposition there's no resistance you just travel with the masses lost in the crowd going with the flow Amen but Moses chose chose to suffer suffer the affliction of God's people it's like fish swimming upstream there's gonna be some resistance chose the harder way why because he loved the Lord it's hard something in him wouldn't let it so he made a conscious choice and esteem the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward see motive and objection Amen Christ here and loo was not concerned about the money a man he was more concerned a man about the Word of God being manifested in that hour he understood a man who he was and what he was to do and what he was therefore a man let's go back to Luke 4 a man the third test and he brought him to Jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast ourselves down from hence for it is written now his Satan quoting the word well it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against the stone and jesus answered and said unto Him it is said thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God now again Christ Jesus the man now Satan know who he were he just said it he know who he was he knew the angel bongo letter but the man being an example for us limiting you trust God and have faith in God you don't test God I will do this just to see what you do thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God he tests us you don't test me when you fail to trust God you are questioning the authority and the plan of God you're telling God wait a minute I have doubt wanna see if your stand by your word that's my face that's not faith anybody cuz that's what science does sang it's through tests they do tests and we say okay this test happened and every time we did does this happen we did this again and the same thing happened so we want to say that that's what happened but tell me how a virgin can see if every time it happened one time blows your sight inside an award tell me how it rain science they had all kind of scientifical gadget if there were rainbows oh no you must be brought one wrong with you it never rain they never rain before the science said it won't happen but it happened amen they the water God you can't test God he's the tester a man Deuteronomy the 8th chapter a man in the second verse and Dow shall remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee before the years in the wilderness to do what to Humble thee and to prove thee to know that what was in that heart whether that would keep his commandment or no that's the whole reason for the test to know what's in your heart what's in your heart whether you would keep his commandment and I or whether you would go off and do your own thing amen turn the heat on Hebrews the twelfth chapter hey man I know we're doing a lot of flipping but the only way I know how to do Amen once I'm done getting one of them fancy slide things and I'd be quick about it a man Hebrews wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and sin which so easily beset us and let us run this race with the patient that is set before us looking unto Jesus who was the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of throne of God for considering him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest she be weird and faint in your minds you have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin and ye have forgotten the exhortation that speaketh unto you as unto the children my son despise not thou chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasing and scourge every son whom he received if he endure chastening God dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chases not but if you be without chastisement where for all are partakers there are ye bastards and not sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we give them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of the spirit and live for verily for a few days chasing us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his holiness now no chastisement for the present seemeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised amen but we see anything that that that the chest Heisman and the test a man unnecessary for us a man in the battle now I read earlier in X when they repent and was baptized with the Holy Ghost amen I'm I'm sorry with a baptized and repent and man that was the induction ceremony into the army okay now he had to go through training had to go through the training of being tested tempted proven and made a true soldier of God amen amen turn 2 corinthians corinthians the first chapter we're coming to a close hey man first Corinthians the first chat I'm in the fourth chapter let no man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and stewards of the mystery of God moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful now we are to be stewards over what the mysteries of God I remember we confront in the opposition and remember it is God's desire to rule and to reign and to have complete control of our lives amen our thoughts our desires but it's going to be a battle a man now a command man is forced to be stewards over the mysteries of God now moreover is required in stewards for a man to be faithful a man now 1st Corinthians the same chapter 4 chapter xvi verse now Paul said wherefore I beseech you bingi followers of me nah he didn't say be ye followers of Christ he said be ye followers of me not is Paul talking Paul had a revelation of who he was remember we talked about that that was a dispensation of change that we were no longer under the Covenant of the law but we were in the dispensation of grace and he said until many Alcon come it to many of the Lord thy God shall call not just Israel as many as the LORD thy God shall call see he told them it was unto you and your children till another far off then he said that so many as the LORD thy God shall call speaking of the Gentiles but Paul said I beseech you be ye followers of me hey man now it says in first Corinthians the 11th chapter amen Paul kind of broke it down for him a little bit so that they're not so confused he said being followers of me even as I also am of Christ see same thing Moses saying follow me as I follow this pillar of fire so a question I asked today who are we following a man so I'm gonna say well I don't worship a man or follow a man if you didn't follow a man back then well who you fall in you you said father crazy he always he's in a process for you to follow the word always come to the Prophet confronting the opposition timeout for I mean with wisdom but we have to tell people God's in a prophet folks and God sent a prophet this is why you're so confused around here worshipping that woman Jezebel being partakers of her sin come out from a bona goddess and a prophet to what show us how to be good stewards over the mysteries amen Ephesians first chapter the ninth verse having made known unto us the mysteries of having made known unto the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in all he might gather together in one all things in Christ both are in heaven and which are on earth even in him amen the mystery of it of his will according to his good pleasure a man if you could it's just I know I didn't give you the thing but could you pull up for me adoption a man the 3rd chapter is 6005 to 2 and 140 3rd 6005 to to morning and 143 yes the adoption now we're going to look at the mystery of his will that we ought to be stewards over amen now we talking about confronting the opposition we're talking about in that confrontation is gonna be a battle it means that we're gonna have to go through we have to be tried we have to be tested and after the test amen amen in that time he showed that back in Luke that after was Jesus went out in power amen and he began doing things manifesting who he was amen and like passion we here are tried and tested and and as we as we pass these tests and as we go through these things our faith is exercised and our faith is renewed and our faith is strengthened and and and and and we're coming to the fullness of the manifestation of who we are to manifest him again a man that the revival being us amen everywhere you go amen the people see the full manifestations of Christ a man once again a man that we dislike Jesus what didn't you know I'd be about my father's business my heart goes out and I'm to tell people to save as many as we can't because let me tell you something this dispensation is closing it's coming to an end I thank God thank God because uh so grateful and so blessed that he has allowed me to have this opportunity a man took to be to be to be tutored under this word Amen cause if not we'd have been out there just as losses anybody else amen and I'm going to read because I don't have it here but Paul said he didn't get this from man and I could see it I'm just making sure that they're for adoption 60 of how 140 yeah that's it okay Paul said he didn't get this from man now what does he say back to Galatians our lesson yes having made known to the mystery of his will not he that's a question what is his will made known the mystery of his will you that's taken down he said the ninth verse and I'm going to hurry right quick and get this out cause we're running late Oh everywhere is such Oh every word is is a nugget not he just saying you can go back all the way through the Bible and just polish this thing and polish this thing and it get better every time now you can dig I can you can take one of them words out of there take it over into Genesis and polish it up take it over in the inches and polish it again you can take it over in Leviticus and polish it again and again and the time you get over in the revelations it's every bit of Jesus amen amen you can just you can just polish it as much as you want to yeah it'll be Jesus when you hit when you hit revelations for he said I am he I am he that was which is and shall come I am the root and the offspring of David the Morningstar the Alpha and Omega that's the a and the Z to the Greek alphabet I am the a to the Z I am I am all I am all in all that's right I am he that was alive and was dead and is alive forevermore I have the keys to death inhale oh my every nugget you pick up here and start polishing it it polishes right to Jesus now just a little later and there as well stop ya waiting for it what you hear in the meeting for what's the purpose of it that's the world groaning for what's the atomic bomb hanging yonder what's the molecules and the atoms and oh what is it all about turn to Roman's a man turn to Romans 8 just a minute for it waiting for what's all this awaiting for what's the time Romans 8 chapter and let us begin to read about it oh I say the eighth say the eighth let's start along about the ninth or the nineteenth verse and just read right here and making it make it real sweet that's right I know where you're getting through there all right Romans eight chapter I believe I'm right now yes sir the eighth verse and let's begin here about the 18th verse let us begin for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye having received the spirit that you have for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again interfere amen I just hold it right there now we see Amen that we're talking about confronting the opposition and he said here after the test after you've been inducted into this fight after you have chosen like noses to to suffer with God's people a man so you go through these tests you go through these trials you go through these having your faith exercise to prove and then yourself amen to God that you love God a man that you love his word Amen you prove to him that you know how to fight a man you fight with his word hey man you know go half off against your brother's system Amen you don't go off oh I'll say it all kind of malice things out of your mouth and then you don't go off this because something bad happens to you you stop coming to church you don't go off and start doing all kind of things on singly when you get upset you don't go like the world over they in first thing they want to do is grab a pistol you don't go off you know how to fight you realize that the battle isn't your man that the belt is ax is a fight and he's always constantly bombarding your mind with all kind of crazy thoughts all kind of crazy ideas but your love for him how ways amen the battle that's going on in your mind that's the test and that you have faith your faith a man is built up so now after you go through all of this he says for as many a live by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for he have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear see when the children of Israel came out of Egypt a man they came out of bondage they were in bondage and they got out there in the wilderness and they had to go through the same tests they got hungry and they started murmuring and complaining and so we we were better off eating the garlic pizza vegan this we have some meat but they would think I would rather be in bondage then maybe I have suffering reflections of suffering with you so they couldn't enter into that race because of the murmuring Amen but you see Christ amen he showed us be an hour out the first part taken that we fight with the Word of God that we overcome and after the overcoming that's this is one react today for Azrael a by the Spirit of God amen to be led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God but we have not given over to the spirit of receipt have not received a spirit about it again that's a fear like the children of Israel oh man a man for for as many a lay-by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father my god that's what it mean my god the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and the children then heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ in so we that we suffer with him that we may be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us amen amen let us stand to our feet glory to God amen musicians if you come a man confronting the opposition a man that we be good stewards over the mysteries of his will his real is that we are led see the kingdom suffers violence and the kingdom of God is pressed unto the kingdom the must have a king that he ruled and reigned in our hearts that we do his will though that are led by God they are the sons of God but we must go through our faith must be exercised let us not get weary and well done I think I show by different scriptures and different examples a man that we are to fight the good fight of faith a man and continue all and a man until we have the full manifestation of the sons of God in this last and evil days amen for this is this is what the world needs to see a man let us pray most Heavenly Father Lord God how I just thank you Lord God for allowing me Lord God to just a man just my own broken up way Lord God to just deliver this message Lord God Lord how it's going to be a battle and we're in the midst of a battle the Lord like Moses Lord we choose to suffer with the afflictions of God's people rather than to dwell in the house of Pharaoh's daughter where there's no doubt many wonderful riches the pleasures of sin we denounce that we turn our back on it Lord to follow you knowing Lord God that is not popular Lord but we would have that your word be glorified Lord God and that you rule and reign in human flesh once again Oh God Lord God just like Lord and the body of Christ Lord to just rule and reign in this mini member body like we may do your will on earth Lord God once again or father stay humble O Father Lord God is just Lord just humble and then on our knees Lord God praying Lord depending on you father trusting in your holy word lord lord god I pray that someone receives something Oh father God was encouraged or father God identified in Jesus name I pray amen [Applause] let's give the Lord of another hand to praise brother Troy a man I certainly just appreciate that that felt tonight of confronting a man the opposition and there was a lot being said in there you know it's been spoken probably the last few weeks different ones I've said it and at different times I heard beliefs just the burgers I think I heard sister wisdom just talk about the attack that's on the message and you know oftentimes when you see different different brothers that are let down standards it's because of you know they didn't confront the opposition right there maybe maybe what I've what I found just in my own observation oftentimes somebody's desiring something in the world right they won't address like the world he want to look like the world you know all of these things I remember talking with somebody and it was all about being able to drink alcohol that that's really what that's what it brought out to you know being able to drink alcohol and because the message has a standard right that we live people are not able to confront that right and just really look you got a spirit on you you need to be delivered right and and it's just you know it's there's there's no other way around and I think people trying to sell me that that Jesus drank I know he turned water into wine but you didn't see him drink the wine well why did the Bible call him I want a blue they also call him you know Beelzebub right so what do you believe you know about the Lord Jesus so you know but but people got to be able to confront the opposition and I'm very grateful so so appreciative of that thought tonight and we just thank God a man for that he was talking about science and and I just heard a little something yesterday I was listening to sermons brother whisper preach and he was bringing out a point there was a scientist that wanted to prove that the cloud was not really the clown it wasn't supernatural and the scientists just he what he went through great limbs he said he was gonna give his life to proving that that was not you know a supernatural he went through so many things trying to prove whether it was uh you know when that moved you know uh you know move something over into that area if a jet flew or you know they said a rocket went off in the rocket went off about five hundred miles from where the cloud you know appeared and he was just going through great extremes the man went up to so many extremes that before he died he actually could not prove you know that the that it wasn't supernatural and and went for my understanding the way demand of diamonds he tried to commit suicide once was not successful and then later on his life he committed suicide and was successful you know and all of his efforts just to to disprove you know the word he lost his life in shame and and what you find is people doing the same thing you know trying to disprove this word you it's just easy to accept it it's so much easier just say Lord I believed and I'm gonna walk in and the things that I don't understand I still believe right it's so much easy to live that way than to sit here and try to you know try to go through and disprove what you know what God sent through his prophet but church we're just an hour we got to confront the opposition you know each one of us or in that and Amen we won't be afraid a man will stand up and do everything that God has called us to do let's take the course there's some walk in the light the beautiful light come where the dew drops of Mercy upright a man before we leave tonight let's just sing a little bit of that shine all around us by day and by night Jesus the light of the world whoa Jesus he is the light of the world we'll walk in the light whoa we'll walk here the line yes we will the Pew T fright oh come where we have two drops [Music] Mircea right whoo and shine hold this [Music] day and by night see this he is the light the world come on sing it one more time we will walk in in the right such a beauty for right whoa walk where where the two traps [Music] Mircea right away Vlad Oh I am by Jesus you are the light of the world a man let's just bow our heads father we thank you for your word a man tonight thank you for brother Troy just get himself out her way in God just stand with that felt tonight of confronting the opposition certainly we are in another time things are changed and we can we can feel the pressure all around as it was just spoken sent me that the Gentiles are rejecting the word and as they're rejecting it is opening up the door for the the Jews to come back in and God during this this this time of change there will be tremendous opposition but God help us to stand true on the word and not to compromise which sin and all these other things Lord that people presenting sometime this may be a man is compromising because of the way his wife wants to dress maybe a woman is compromising because the way husband wants to sin but God we we got it we got to confront the opposition we got to stand on the truth no matter what a man will fight in this battle at at every concert God your prophet even told us that anybody that would compromise a little bit with this word is our enemy no matter who they are if they're gonna compromise with its word they are our enemy so lord help us got to recognize that and lord suggests to have the same love that you have Lord but not to Lord not to to let down the standards not to let down the bars with the uphold father a man every word that you spoke to us in this hour God we want to uphold it with everything we got so we prayed if you just continue to bless Lord brother Troy continue God to use them for your glory and honor bless the states as they prepare to leave this place tonight going there respective ways give traveling mercies to each and every one bring us that the bring us back at the appointed time on Sunday morning a man for a time of Prayer and Sunday school and Lord of time of worship may you just be a part of everything that happens we give you all the glory all the honor and all the praise this in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen and amen God richly bless you you can be seated the brothers will come amen it's time to dismiss you amen [Music]
