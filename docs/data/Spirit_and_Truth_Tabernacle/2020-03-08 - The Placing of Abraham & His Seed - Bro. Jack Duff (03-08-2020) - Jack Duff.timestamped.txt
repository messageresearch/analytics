[1:11:20] I believe it would be a blessing to us a
[1:11:22] madness 1 Ephesians 1 and want to start
[1:11:27] at verse 3 a man in Ephesians 1 praise
[1:11:37] the lord says blessed be the God and
[1:11:43] father of our Lord Jesus Christ blessed
[1:11:48] us with all spiritual blessings in
[1:11:50] heavenly places in Christ according as
[1:11:53] he hath chosen us in him before the
[1:12:00] foundation the world that has that's the
[1:12:03] beautiful part of what Paul is writing
[1:12:06] to us a man God had a purpose in his
[1:12:10] mind before we even got
[1:12:13] here right and and and if I could just
[1:12:15] tell you your mistakes could not stop
[1:12:18] his purpose your failures and all it
[1:12:22] couldn't stop God's purpose
[1:12:24] this all happened before you were even
[1:12:26] old glory to God a man says according as
[1:12:33] he has chosen us in him before the
[1:12:36] foundation of the world that we should
[1:12:39] be holy and without blame before him in
[1:12:46] love these are powerful scriptures
[1:12:49] mouths words and what we have to do you
[1:12:53] know the Satan is the accuser of the
[1:12:55] Brethren and it's Satan's job to accuse
[1:12:58] you constantly constantly a man about
[1:13:01] things you did and mistakes you made all
[1:13:03] that but the scripture says that we're
[1:13:05] gonna be holding without blame before
[1:13:07] him Satan we not standing before you
[1:13:10] this is before him Satan didn't have no
[1:13:15] blood to wash us with lose us from our
[1:13:18] sins but our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:13:21] Christ
[1:13:22] not only loosed us from our sins but
[1:13:26] loosed us from the memory loosed you
[1:13:32] from the memory of when the devil keep
[1:13:35] bringing it back up you've been loosed
[1:13:36] from the memory glory to God it's time
[1:13:42] that we recognize who we are a man a man
[1:13:45] a man a man glory and he says having
[1:13:50] predestined us unto the adoption of
[1:13:52] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:13:54] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:13:57] will to the praise of the glory of His
[1:14:00] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[1:14:03] in the beloved in whom we have
[1:14:06] redemption through his blood the
[1:14:09] forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:14:13] riches of His grace wherein he hath
[1:14:17] abounded towards us and always
[1:14:19] and prudence having made known unto us
[1:14:21] the mystery of his will according to his
[1:14:25] good pleasure which he hath purposed and
[1:14:28] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:14:32] fullness of times that he might gather
[1:14:34] together in one all things in Christ
[1:14:39] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:14:42] on earth even in him praise the Lord I
[1:14:45] want to read also from just turn back
[1:14:49] there to Galatians and just a couple
[1:14:52] verses from Chapter three and then will
[1:14:54] flow right into Chapter four here in
[1:14:56] Galatians a man that started here verse
[1:15:00] 24 Galatians three says wherefore the
[1:15:05] law was our schoolmaster to bring us
[1:15:08] unto Christ that we might be justified
[1:15:10] by faith but after that faith is come we
[1:15:17] are no longer under a schoolmaster for
[1:15:20] ye are all the children of God by faith
[1:15:22] in Christ Jesus for as many as for as
[1:15:26] many of you as have been baptized into
[1:15:29] Christ have put on Christ there is
[1:15:32] neither Jew nor Greek there is neither
[1:15:34] bond nor free there is neither male nor
[1:15:36] female for ye are all one in Christ
[1:15:40] Jesus
[1:15:41] and if ye be Christ's then are ye
[1:15:45] Abraham's seed and heirs according to
[1:15:48] the promise
[1:15:48] going on into verse 1 chapter 4 now I
[1:15:52] say that the air as long as he is a
[1:15:56] child differeth nothing from a servant
[1:15:59] though he be Lord of all but is under
[1:16:03] tutors and governors until the time
[1:16:06] appointed of the Father even so when we
[1:16:10] were in children were in bondage under
[1:16:12] the elements of the world but when the
[1:16:14] fullness of the time was come God sent
[1:16:17] forth his son made of a woman
[1:16:21] under the law to redeem them that were
[1:16:24] under the law that we might receive the
[1:16:25] adoption of sons and because you are
[1:16:29] sons God has set forth the spirit of his
[1:16:32] son into your hearts crying Abba Father
[1:16:35] wherefore thou are no more servant but a
[1:16:39] son and if a son then an heir of God
[1:16:42] through Christ amen if you all don't
[1:16:45] mind just one more place of scripture
[1:16:48] here out of Genesis 17 a man tell you
[1:16:54] what I'll read this up I don't say a
[1:16:56] word afraid I'll let you be seated but I
[1:16:58] want I do want to read this just hold
[1:16:59] this in your hand let's pray father we
[1:17:02] thank you for the word of the Lord that
[1:17:05] has been read to our hearts and God we
[1:17:07] pray that you'd help us to hear what the
[1:17:11] Spirit wants us to hear today be
[1:17:14] glorified and magnified we take every
[1:17:16] spirit that's against the Spirit of God
[1:17:17] underneath the control of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:19] even right now and just thank you Lord
[1:17:22] that we have the opportunity to come and
[1:17:23] to gather in this place to hear the Word
[1:17:27] of God speak to us Lord and only way
[1:17:29] that you can us in Jesus name we pray
[1:17:31] amen amen god bless you can be seated
[1:17:48] praise the Lord so Genesis 17 I want to
[1:17:51] just read here this would be our found
[1:17:53] foundation pretty much we want to speak
[1:17:58] on the subject the placing of Abraham
[1:18:01] and his seat amen the placing of Abraham
[1:18:05] and his seed and here in Genesis 17 the
[1:18:09] Bible says and when Abram was ninety was
[1:18:15] ninety years old and nine the Lord
[1:18:18] appeared to Abram and said unto him I am
[1:18:22] the Almighty God walk before me and be
[1:18:25] thou perfect and I will make my covenant
[1:18:29] between me and thee and will multiply
[1:18:32] thee exceedingly and Abraham fell on his
[1:18:35] face and God talked with him saying as
[1:18:38] for me the whole my covenant is with
[1:18:41] thee and thou shalt be a father of many
[1:18:45] nations a man neither shall thy name any
[1:18:49] more be called Abram but thy name shall
[1:18:52] be Abraham a man for a father of many
[1:18:56] nations have a mazy and I will make the
[1:19:00] exceeding fruitful and I will make
[1:19:03] nations of thee and Kings shall come out
[1:19:06] of thee and I will establish my covenant
[1:19:09] between me and thee and thy seed after
[1:19:12] thee and their generations for an
[1:19:14] everlasting covenant to be a God unto
[1:19:17] thee and to thy seed after thee I thank
[1:19:22] God that he is our God my man and I
[1:19:25] would give unto thee and to thy seed
[1:19:28] after thee the land wherein thou art a
[1:19:31] stranger all the land of canaan for an
[1:19:34] everlasting possession and I will be
[1:19:36] their God amen so just using that kind
[1:19:40] of as a foundation here we want to use
[1:19:43] the subject the placing of Abraham and
[1:19:46] his seed the placing of Abraham and his
[1:19:50] seed and I just want to start with a
[1:19:52] quote out of the message adoption part
[1:19:55] for if we could just go there praise the
[1:19:57] Lord
[1:19:58] amen the Prophet makes a statement here
[1:20:01] too
[1:20:01] he says tell me my brother tell me my
[1:20:05] sister when was the time that the sons
[1:20:10] of God was ever to be manifested outside
[1:20:15] of this time
[1:20:16] now a man when were there ever time in
[1:20:21] the history manifests the time to
[1:20:25] deliver all nature that nature nature
[1:20:29] itself is groaning waiting for the time
[1:20:32] of the manifestation and I've preached
[1:20:35] the sermon before from that scripture in
[1:20:38] Romans 8 where where nature itself is
[1:20:41] groaning for the manifestation of sons
[1:20:43] of God but you know as I was doing a
[1:20:45] little research on that it's not just
[1:20:47] the word manifestation but its nature
[1:20:50] stuff is groaning waiting for the
[1:20:52] revelation of the sons of God and what
[1:20:56] that means is that it's wait for us to
[1:20:58] come into an understanding glory to God
[1:21:01] of who we are
[1:21:02] amen nature's actually waiting on you to
[1:21:05] come to your understanding right and I
[1:21:08] and when we look around with all the
[1:21:10] things that we got going on and a man
[1:21:13] everybody's afraid of the virus
[1:21:17] amen everybody's so afraid and you know
[1:21:20] for folk doing all kind of things that
[1:21:22] you know they don't want you to get near
[1:21:24] them they wanna want you to wear Mac's
[1:21:26] they want to wear a mask they
[1:21:28] everybody's living in fear hallelujah
[1:21:31] glory to God but but God has not given
[1:21:34] us the spirit of fear
[1:21:37] he made a thousand may fall at my side
[1:21:41] ten thousand over here but I have a
[1:21:44] promise and the promise says to me that
[1:21:47] it shall not come nigh my dwelling he
[1:21:52] ain't gonna touch me
[1:21:53] it ain't gonna touch my children eating
[1:21:56] untouched nobody it ain't gonna touch
[1:21:59] the church Amen we have a promise all we
[1:22:03] gotta do is set on the Word of God his
[1:22:07] word came feel
[1:22:09] [Applause]
[1:22:11] you know out there we had a little video
[1:22:13] there that we start where a man say he
[1:22:15] was going to challenge you know the
[1:22:17] coronavirus they say the Lord sent him
[1:22:20] the challenging and he was going to
[1:22:23] China to challenge it and and when he
[1:22:26] got a China ended up in the hospital
[1:22:30] amen
[1:22:31] this melon came a man we not dare to
[1:22:35] challenge the virus but if the virus
[1:22:38] challenges us we're not running trying
[1:22:44] to find the virus challenges we are
[1:22:49] standing on the word we're standing on
[1:22:51] the show foundation God's working say
[1:22:55] [Applause]
[1:23:00] man if you want the cure you need to be
[1:23:04] you need to have the blood of Jesus
[1:23:06] apply it was in the days of Moses and
[1:23:12] they had the blot applied and those that
[1:23:14] had the blood applied the Death Angel
[1:23:15] passing by so if you want look you come
[1:23:18] underneath the blood all right all right
[1:23:21] all right hey man we're not looking to
[1:23:24] try to create no news headlines here
[1:23:26] that we stopped Corona whatever it is
[1:23:29] not we not not praise the Lord Amen but
[1:23:32] it won't come now dwelling I say that
[1:23:34] much Amen all right let me finish
[1:23:37] reading this because he says nature
[1:23:39] itself is groaning waiting for the time
[1:23:42] of the manifestation why before the
[1:23:45] atonement was made before the Holy Ghost
[1:23:48] was ever poured out before all the Old
[1:23:52] Testament on down there couldn't have
[1:23:54] been manifestation he says they had to
[1:23:59] wait to this time now all things that's
[1:24:01] been brought coming shaping up to a
[1:24:03] headstone to the manifestation of the
[1:24:06] sons of God coming back and the Spirit
[1:24:09] of God coming into these men so
[1:24:12] perfectly until there
[1:24:14] ministry will be so close like Christ
[1:24:17] till Allah join him and his church
[1:24:20] together that's where we are Church
[1:24:22] that's what exactly Amen what we're
[1:24:25] looking for them the Holy Spirit coming
[1:24:26] into this group of men so perfectly
[1:24:29] until their ministry be so close like
[1:24:32] Christ
[1:24:32] it'll join him in his church together
[1:24:34] let me go on a little further here a
[1:24:36] madness message church order the Prophet
[1:24:40] makes a statement here a man that I just
[1:24:43] want to bring to you it says in his
[1:24:45] quote in Romans 5:1 he says we believe
[1:24:48] in justification by faith Romans 5:1 we
[1:24:53] believe that after a person being
[1:24:57] justified by faith he has peace with the
[1:25:00] Lord Jesus Christ that scripture it says
[1:25:03] but it's possible
[1:25:04] Amen that this same person could have
[1:25:08] habits such as drinking and smoking now
[1:25:13] they've been justified but they're still
[1:25:16] carrying habits bad habits glory to God
[1:25:21] glory glory glory amen the Holy Ghost is
[1:25:24] supposed to bring us beyond our habits
[1:25:27] the Holy Ghost supposed to break your
[1:25:30] habits amen that way when the Holy
[1:25:33] Spirit comes into your life you know you
[1:25:36] no longer live the same life you used to
[1:25:39] live a man now it's not your life but
[1:25:43] it's his life
[1:25:45] can you see Jesus smoking can you see
[1:25:49] Jesus drinking can you see Jesus doing
[1:25:52] some of the things that we do those
[1:25:54] habits must be broken
[1:25:57] listen since I is possible that this
[1:26:01] same person can have habits such as
[1:26:03] drink and smoke and doing things that it
[1:26:05] should not do filthy habits of the flesh
[1:26:08] then we believe that the blood of Jesus
[1:26:11] Christ sanctifies this person for the
[1:26:14] service of the Lord we believe in
[1:26:16] sanctification according to Hebrews 13
[1:26:19] 12 and 13 where Jesus also that he might
[1:26:22] sanctify the people with his own blood
[1:26:24] suffered without the gate and we believe
[1:26:27] that sanctification is talked in the New
[1:26:29] Testament and meant for the believers
[1:26:32] through the New Testament age which
[1:26:35] we're now living so we're supposed to
[1:26:37] live sanctified life hallelujah
[1:26:41] justified lives saved the fight lives
[1:26:44] and lies that I'm feeling the Holy Ghost
[1:26:46] see this is my brother Troy was kind of
[1:26:49] sharing you know in one of those
[1:26:51] Wednesday night sermons he was preaching
[1:26:53] you know people get a man a new spirit
[1:26:56] is ready did a new heart we get a new
[1:26:59] spirit and then the Baptist or Holy
[1:27:02] Spirit suppose are coming to miss that
[1:27:03] we get a new spirit and we stop right we
[1:27:08] get a new spirit and we stop we think we
[1:27:10] got it all hallelujah
[1:27:11] like my brother brother brother brother
[1:27:14] Danny I believe the one mentioned what
[1:27:16] age have we lived in that people can't
[1:27:18] explain when they received all they go
[1:27:22] you ought to know where the change took
[1:27:25] place right everybody I don't know where
[1:27:27] that change took place in you know so so
[1:27:30] what happens is that people got a new
[1:27:32] spirit but didn't go on to get the holy
[1:27:34] spirit look Amen that probably goes on
[1:27:38] and he makes the statement here it says
[1:27:41] we believe that sanctification is taught
[1:27:44] in the New Testament and meant for the
[1:27:46] believers through the New Testament age
[1:27:47] which we're now living we also believe
[1:27:50] that after the person has been
[1:27:51] sanctified now look at that I love that
[1:27:54] I love the statement after the person's
[1:27:57] been sanctified unclean habits has gold
[1:28:00] from the person sanctification by itself
[1:28:05] I'm taught my true significance it will
[1:28:09] take a bad habit from you you don't even
[1:28:11] have the Holy Ghost but sanctification
[1:28:14] will take your bad habit
[1:28:16] [Applause]
[1:28:19] hallelujah somebody Amen we want to make
[1:28:22] it real we want to clinch it in in and
[1:28:25] in the body of Christ right
[1:28:27] signification itself so take the bad
[1:28:29] habits away yeah save the case yourself
[1:28:32] to take the bath salts away yeah think
[1:28:35] that the case in itself just stopped you
[1:28:37] from hanging with certain people even
[1:28:41] without the Holy Ghost Saint vacation
[1:28:44] should be strong enough to do that see
[1:28:51] if saying the case stays down that a is
[1:28:52] something wrong somewhere but
[1:28:55] signification Amen unclean habits on
[1:28:58] gold from the person
[1:29:00] so if unclean habits are not going you
[1:29:03] can't claim that you've been sanctified
[1:29:04] a man Church Amen you can only claim
[1:29:10] signification when you see them habits
[1:29:12] cone unclean habits total unclean
[1:29:18] desires ago then I've been sanctified by
[1:29:21] the blood of Jesus
[1:29:23] Oh hallelujah see we're not just using
[1:29:27] words to use words this much produce a
[1:29:30] life that's it
[1:29:32] before we can see Amen the manifestation
[1:29:35] of Jesus in us we must produce a light
[1:29:40] justification says I just as if I'll
[1:29:43] never did it before
[1:29:44] but same dedication actually washes you
[1:29:46] from Amen the habit loose issue from the
[1:29:51] happiness well let's go on a little
[1:29:52] further he says he is a believer in the
[1:29:55] Lord Jesus Christ and his habits are
[1:29:58] cold we believe that and he is a
[1:30:00] candidate for the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:04] Spirit which comes as a feeling of the
[1:30:07] believer he says just as many times as
[1:30:10] I've talked like picking up a glass out
[1:30:12] in the chicken yard and you know I'm a
[1:30:16] go on I would just I'll just share I'll
[1:30:19] leave that quote there I won't read any
[1:30:21] more it's you know brother Branham says
[1:30:22] I'm picking up the glass in the chicken
[1:30:24] yard say now when you pick up that glass
[1:30:26] it's filters got filthy habits right
[1:30:30] it's filthy
[1:30:31] now just because you pick up the glass
[1:30:33] of dirty glass told me you can use it
[1:30:37] anybody come presents you a dirty glass
[1:30:39] lady you don't want to drink from that
[1:30:42] even in the restaurant when they give
[1:30:44] you a dirty glass you sit it back if
[1:30:49] you'll send it back what you think the
[1:30:52] Holy Ghost so do if you try to present
[1:30:55] to him your dirty glass you want God to
[1:30:58] drink from your dirty cup
[1:31:05] right insane but you picked up you
[1:31:08] notification it's actually picking the
[1:31:10] cup up that sucks which case you just
[1:31:13] pick the cup up but in your mind you got
[1:31:15] purpose for the cup just just a sample
[1:31:21] eat up some little I got to use the cup
[1:31:24] but before I can use the cup I gotta
[1:31:26] take it through a process every book God
[1:31:30] can you chew he's got to take you
[1:31:32] through a process to clean it and that's
[1:31:44] what the Holy Ghost is coming to do oh
[1:31:45] my god that's what he did a few weeks
[1:31:48] ago he come in clean and set us for
[1:32:01] service but when he picks it up and put
[1:32:05] something in it then he feels it now he
[1:32:08] can use it for service and I believe
[1:32:12] this morning gobbles to pick some of us
[1:32:14] up Phyllis so he can use us for his
[1:32:18] service hallelujah glory to God glory to
[1:32:23] God a man we don't want to just be a
[1:32:25] dirty cup and we also just don't want to
[1:32:27] be a clean cup never used a man we want
[1:32:31] to be used by God we must find our place
[1:32:34] in the body so we can be used by God see
[1:32:38] and this is this is it this is important
[1:32:40] to me you know it's not necessarily
[1:32:41] finding a place in church but finding a
[1:32:45] place in the body hallelujah you know I
[1:32:50] mean when we talk about placing then
[1:32:53] it's not it's not just it's not just
[1:32:56] manifestations in your life I can't
[1:32:59] preach it like that because you know a
[1:33:01] lot used to here you know different ones
[1:33:03] would say how when brother Branham
[1:33:05] received his adoption various things
[1:33:07] happen in
[1:33:08] ministry you know we like they what they
[1:33:10] were Thai what happened a man when the
[1:33:13] seven seals was open and things like
[1:33:14] that the Angels visit him they're tied
[1:33:16] at to his adoption well brother Brandon
[1:33:18] was preached of adoption before the
[1:33:20] seven seals a man brother branham had
[1:33:22] already experienced spoken words amen
[1:33:25] creation before the seals hallelujah
[1:33:28] hey man so we can't just tie two
[1:33:31] manifestations like that that would be a
[1:33:33] part of it but we're trying to find our
[1:33:35] place in Christ hallelujah
[1:33:40] all right let's go on a little further
[1:33:43] here a man a man a man I'm going to this
[1:33:47] message adoption Park for and you all
[1:33:49] just bear with me today I just love the
[1:33:51] Lord man it's a place of Abraham and his
[1:33:55] seat and his seat I want to try to make
[1:33:58] it simple so that you understand this is
[1:34:00] for everybody in here adopted in places
[1:34:03] for everybody
[1:34:04] you were pretty destinated unto the
[1:34:07] adoption of children notice not the
[1:34:10] description of Savior predestinated to
[1:34:12] be a church member you will
[1:34:14] predestinated unto the adoption of
[1:34:16] children Paul wrote that to everybody
[1:34:19] brother and sister Oh hallelujah all
[1:34:23] right now we know that adoption and
[1:34:26] placing will not be outside of the word
[1:34:28] right so when we talk about that we
[1:34:31] understand that that the Bible clearly
[1:34:34] makes it very clear that uh that it's
[1:34:38] all sisters are not called to the
[1:34:40] ministry the Bible makes that clear amen
[1:34:44] the Bible says I suffer not a woman to
[1:34:45] teach they usurp authority right that's
[1:34:47] what the Bible says now I know people
[1:34:50] don't read the Bible no more
[1:34:52] but we know that God been calling a
[1:34:54] woman to preach we also know according
[1:34:57] to Scripture and nowadays we got women
[1:35:00] bishops and all that but that's not what
[1:35:02] the Bible say but I said this is going
[1:35:04] to be a husband of one wife all right
[1:35:07] that's what the Bible say right we we
[1:35:10] got to stay with what God said in his
[1:35:12] word don't don't try to add to it or
[1:35:14] take away from it let's just say what he
[1:35:16] said now let's go a man we talked about
[1:35:20] adoption placing it's got to be within
[1:35:21] the word now but now watch this he says
[1:35:24] and this in this message of Thompson
[1:35:25] Park four it says now notice the coming
[1:35:30] of the Lord Jesus is close
[1:35:32] a man at hand until the spirit from way
[1:35:34] down in here just barely justification
[1:35:37] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[1:35:40] Spirit and now right into the time of
[1:35:43] the coming of the headstone it says the
[1:35:45] church has got to be so perfectly like
[1:35:48] Christ and to Christ in the church can
[1:35:50] unite together the same spirit and if
[1:35:53] the Spirit of Christ is in you I like
[1:35:56] this if the Spirit of Christ is in you
[1:36:02] it makes you live the life of Christ
[1:36:08] ah I'm grateful for that and if it's in
[1:36:13] you you can't even you can't even do
[1:36:16] wrong that the desire is gold for you to
[1:36:20] do wrong
[1:36:21] hallelujah there must be you know
[1:36:24] experiencing a conviction that when you
[1:36:26] start to do wrong a pulling in the wrong
[1:36:28] direction something on us
[1:36:32] and if it's stopping you and let you
[1:36:34] know that it's another life living there
[1:36:36] because your nature will pull for the
[1:36:40] wrong things on but when the nature of
[1:36:43] God comes inside of you it stops that
[1:36:47] are clean habits from performing in your
[1:36:50] life it makes you live the life of
[1:36:56] Christ act the life of Christ
[1:36:58] do the works of Christ he that believeth
[1:37:01] on me the works that I do shall he do
[1:37:02] also jesus said that now where we got a
[1:37:06] ministry coming that's just exactly like
[1:37:08] the life of Christ what does that
[1:37:10] ministry identify the coming of the Lord
[1:37:14] it says look at in the world a day and
[1:37:17] watch what Khruschev saying all these
[1:37:20] other great things and great worldwide
[1:37:22] conflicts right in hand at any time
[1:37:24] could go to powder at any second that's
[1:37:27] right and if that we know that that's
[1:37:30] close any sense of a person can read in
[1:37:33] a newspaper or listen to radio and we
[1:37:35] know that it's closed well remember
[1:37:38] Christ comes that for his church for it
[1:37:41] first church before that happens so how
[1:37:42] close is the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:45] maybe before this meeting is tonight
[1:37:48] we're at the end time certain the truth
[1:37:51] so church I'm looking for it's coming at
[1:37:54] any time a man and you know all the
[1:37:57] things that I hear just caused me to get
[1:37:59] a little most stirred up in my spirit
[1:38:01] little or not just even so come Lord
[1:38:03] Jesus is my prayer a man and no sense of
[1:38:06] us running and acted in fear
[1:38:10] that's what everybody else does but we
[1:38:12] should be just so calm and that's right
[1:38:14] so collected hallelujah yeah

[1:38:33] so everybody running out trying to get
[1:38:35] what they can now before they start
[1:38:36] rationing my question is after you get
[1:38:39] what you got and you run out what you're

[1:38:50] not going to buy a gun to protect myself
[1:38:53] I got something else graded in the guys
[1:38:56] I got something passed it in a bullet
[1:39:01] more powerful than a man than that than
[1:39:05] an atomic bomb I got the spoken word of
[1:39:08] times and in all the sins it's just
[1:39:12] pushing us into a place hallelujah where
[1:39:16] we can see the manifestation of what
[1:39:18] we've been talking about
[1:39:20] a man church what Christ speaking move
[1:39:26] forward and this is who this is what
[1:39:28] we've been taught for years now it's
[1:39:30] time for sin act in that manner as
[1:39:33] manifested sons and daughters God do you
[1:39:35] wear predestinated unto this just just
[1:39:40] sort of to you you you're very clear and
[1:39:43] take pressure to put you in your place
[1:39:47] it takes pressure right I mean we we
[1:39:51] didn't see certain things coming from
[1:39:53] Moses today was under pressure
[1:39:55] Joshua cannot speak to a son until he
[1:39:59] was under pressure
[1:40:01] glory to God Amen Jesus fed 5,000 when
[1:40:08] he was under 4,000 when he was under
[1:40:13] pressure he walked on water when he was
[1:40:18] under pressure so the pressure produces

[1:42:10] testing and certain trials to see how he
[1:42:13] respond to it Laurie become and the

[1:43:19] when you leave Church the Holy Ghost
[1:43:22] want to know how you acted how you
[1:43:24] conducted yourself the Holy Ghost the
[1:43:27] Holy Ghost say they using curse cursing
[1:43:29] and language that they should be using
[1:43:32] but they come into the house of God I'm
[1:43:34] still praising God out of the same mouth

[1:44:23] self-evaluation god I still got this in
[1:44:25] my life but I heard that as

[1:51:29] a play son then to the father's Kingdom
[1:51:32] it has full equal rights to it and
[1:51:33] otherwise if he wrote a check his name
[1:51:36] is just as good on the chick as his
[1:51:38] daddy's a man was then he's adopted a
[1:51:42] place God did the same thing to Jesus
[1:51:46] upon Mount Transfiguration what did he
[1:51:49] do he overshadowed him taking him up in
[1:51:52] a public place taking three witnesses
[1:51:55] Peter James and John brought two
[1:51:58] witnesses from heaven to show three is a
[1:52:00] witness and when he overshadowed him and
[1:52:03] his raiment his pretty robe before him
[1:52:06] the glorified condition shine like the
[1:52:09] Sun and its strength is that right and a
[1:52:11] voice came from heaven saying this is my
[1:52:13] beloved son hear ye him amen I please
[1:52:17] tell positionally that's my son what he
[1:52:20] says I'll back up this is where God has
[1:52:26] brought his people to what he says I'll
[1:52:30] back up when when when Joshua said son
[1:52:35] stand still you know Joshua can do that
[1:52:39] Josh we did not have the power to do
[1:52:42] that but because he spoke it and he was
[1:52:46] a place
[1:52:47] what'd he say God
[1:52:51] backed up and that's some things that
[1:52:55] you got to speak just under inspiration
[1:52:57] you can't bring that thing to pass but
[1:53:00] because you're a son of God and you
[1:53:03] found your place in Christ what you say
[1:53:07] God will back up believe that hallelujah
[1:53:18] amen
[1:53:19] because only says uh-uh-uh since the
[1:53:24] east kept my word
[1:53:25] he's fought through all these
[1:53:27] denominations and everything a man else
[1:53:30] and kept the faith
[1:53:31] he's pulled no punches he's been through
[1:53:33] he's always about my work when people
[1:53:36] look at him they see me this is my son
[1:53:40] here you him did he just promise that to
[1:53:44] him know through him come to see the
[1:53:48] vapor ahem buy the same thing fourth and
[1:53:52] fifth chapters now look it says go God
[1:53:55] took a bring him out and place the
[1:53:57] adoption upon him and change his name
[1:53:59] now when he said for photography met
[1:54:01] fourth or fifth verse we read that in
[1:54:03] Genesis 17 amen when he told Abraham
[1:54:07] we'll just read it here is real quick it
[1:54:10] says as for me behold my covenant is
[1:54:12] with thee and thou shalt be a father of
[1:54:15] many nations I meant in Genesis 17 for
[1:54:19] and asked for me but hold my covenant is
[1:54:23] with thee and thou shalt be a father of
[1:54:26] many nations what a promise this man has
[1:54:31] no son this man has no child but God
[1:54:36] gives him problem not only you don't
[1:54:38] have a son but I'm gonna make you father
[1:54:39] of many nations hallelujah glory glory
[1:54:43] glory even in this church right now many
[1:54:45] nations are represented
[1:54:47] and we're all the children of Abraham
[1:54:50] through Christ hallelujah and we can
[1:54:54] make claims on this promise that God has
[1:54:57] given us I mean look he says he said sup
[1:55:00] and that's me
[1:55:01] but hold my covenant is with thee and
[1:55:03] thou shalt be a father of many nations
[1:55:05] neither shalt thou name anymore because
[1:55:10] April but thy name shall be Abraham for
[1:55:15] father many nations have I made thee now
[1:55:19] let's finish this quote brother Branham
[1:55:22] was referring back to scripture now look
[1:55:23] at this
[1:55:24] it says God took Abraham out and place
[1:55:29] the adoption upon him and changed his
[1:55:32] name glory from April to Abraham Abraham
[1:55:36] comes from the word of Elohim God's own
[1:55:42] name he associated his name with God's
[1:55:46] name God is telling him how many knows
[1:55:49] that the great Jehovah L owe him the
[1:55:51] all-sufficient when the self-existent
[1:55:53] when l owe him he says and wanted to do
[1:55:56] he took the HTM off of his name a man
[1:56:01] action Peter H I am hallelujah amen
[1:56:04] offer his name and placed it on
[1:56:06] Abraham's name God took amen a portion
[1:56:11] of his thing the self-existing l owe him
[1:56:14] took a portion of his name and he gave
[1:56:17] it to Abraham when he did that he was
[1:56:19] placing Abraham
[1:56:24] man he was he was placing his son
[1:56:26] Abraham just by giving a part of his
[1:56:29] name I just stay with me let me finish
[1:56:32] this quote glory glory glory because he
[1:56:36] was April a PRA hmm God is the father of
[1:56:40] all and Abraham is the father of Nations
[1:56:43] glory Elohim father of Abraham father of
[1:56:48] Nations please see positionally glory
[1:56:51] that's AB his church receive the Holy
[1:56:55] Ghost out of the day went through the
[1:56:56] testings Amen see Pentecost missed that
[1:56:59] they organize themselves we couldn't get
[1:57:01] into father then when God does a certain
[1:57:03] thing say uh-huh
[1:57:04] stay away from it our church don't teach
[1:57:06] that go ahead but here's what he's done
[1:57:08] to Abraham to Abraham and his seed after
[1:57:11] him I just want to go through Abraham's
[1:57:13] life real quick just bear with me my
[1:57:17] lord my lord I wish that I wouldn't
[1:57:20] fight in all this to try to preach this
[1:57:22] today
[1:57:24] but the seeds are being planted and the
[1:57:28] people are coming to understand if
[1:57:31] Abraham was placed a man this same
[1:57:35] promise goes down to the sea now we
[1:57:38] might not have had a man our name change
[1:57:42] the way Abraham had his name changed but
[1:57:45] we did receive the father's name because
[1:57:48] all heaven it's named after the Lord
[1:57:52] Jesus glory to God amen so we got we got
[1:57:58] his name now over comers get the new
[1:58:02] name and we have been over comers in the
[1:58:04] south praise God we have withstood
[1:58:07] denominational Amen stuff for years we
[1:58:11] have been overcome in this no matter
[1:58:15] whatever else is teaching if it's not in
[1:58:18] the Word of God it's not in the Word of
[1:58:20] God and we've been standing over that's
[1:58:22] overcome us now lacy
[1:58:24] Oh hallelujah Genesis 12 Abraham was
[1:58:31] justified now I don't have time to read
[1:58:33] all this but I will tell you you can go
[1:58:35] back to the message Abraham's Grace
[1:58:37] Covenant you can listen to it but in
[1:58:39] Genesis 12 the prophets say that Abraham
[1:58:41] was justified now now just four cases
[1:58:44] being carved out being picked up right
[1:58:47] give you the cup in in the field of
[1:58:49] dirty cup in the field you being picked
[1:58:51] up Abraham was a dirty cup Abraham was
[1:58:58] serving idol gods
[1:58:59] that's how dirty he was he wasn't even
[1:59:02] serving the one true God but God knew
[1:59:05] that once Abraham came in contact with
[1:59:08] the one true God it would change
[1:59:10] everything about it
[1:59:12] so God picked it up when he didn't even
[1:59:14] deserve to be picked up can I tell you
[1:59:17] the truth he predestinated she will turn
[1:59:20] option and he picked you up when you did
[1:59:23] the survey he elected you to come to
[1:59:35] this by mistake about you didn't just
[1:59:39] meet somebody on the street some weight
[1:59:41] God knew please doctor to repeat that he
[1:59:46] knew your dirty condition no filthy
[1:59:49] habits and he picked you up anyway who
[2:00:01] will serve a god like that Genesis 12
[2:00:06] Abraham was justified he was called out
[2:00:10] by justification and believe God's words
[2:00:13] brother really is that right so was the
[2:00:16] Church of Martin Luther is that right
[2:00:17] now just that's it just as direct quote
[2:00:20] but I can't I don't have time to read
[2:00:22] the whole thing he says and I just I'm
[2:00:24] going back to this because you can be
[2:00:26] justified and still have bad habits amen
[2:00:31] Loreena God you can be justified and
[2:00:34] still have bad habits now now now
[2:00:36] abraham was justified
[2:00:38] glory to God here we were he was serving
[2:00:40] a false god and when God called Abraham
[2:00:43] out he did not call light but Abraham
[2:00:46] brought a lot with him a man a lot of
[2:00:48] trouble was going on with lot in the
[2:00:50] camp yeah
[2:00:51] god be with you he do with you
[2:00:54] man you can't be trying to bring people
[2:00:56] own let them come by itself we got deal
[2:00:59] with him rabbit God God is calling you
[2:01:02] Abraham hallelujah
[2:01:05] hey man they will come to it in there if
[2:01:08] they are predestinated fear of God they
[2:01:10] can't help but come to it I am I am
[2:01:14] getting to a place where all I do is
[2:01:16] just pray I gotta be fussing with nobody
[2:01:22] I ain't gonna be trying to make you do
[2:01:24] this and pray because I know the promise
[2:01:30] you promise them to me into my children
[2:01:32] those that are prophetess minister Lord
[2:01:35] our God shall call hallelujah
[2:01:37] hey man maybe maybe some of you mamas
[2:01:40] ought to just take acts 2 and so into
[2:01:43] some of your kids clothes so now just
[2:01:46] put it on the inside of the clothes they
[2:01:48] don't even know it's there and I'm not
[2:01:50] fussing with you you know what you're
[2:01:52] wearing you wearing a promise it's in
[2:01:59] your clothes God but don't fuss and
[2:02:05] fight with the devil that's your token
[2:02:09] just wave that before the devil this is
[2:02:11] the promise that God gave me I'm not
[2:02:13] fussing to fight about that
[2:02:14] amen listen it said so so you're gonna
[2:02:18] be justified and still have bad habits
[2:02:20] Abraham had it right oh my god we in
[2:02:26] Genesis 12 when he was justified also
[2:02:29] Genesis 12 were a lot went with him and
[2:02:31] and Abraham could not get blessed
[2:02:35] until he separated from life
[2:02:43] now a separation will also be a
[2:02:48] sanctification right and so some of us
[2:02:53] they may really can't get the blessings
[2:02:55] from God that we that we want until we
[2:02:57] actually separate from some things in
[2:03:00] our past now now look at this well you
[2:03:05] know all the times what we do is we pray
[2:03:07] God take this out of my life did you
[2:03:10] pray next God to bring it into your life
[2:03:12] I do too are you did you just kind of go
[2:03:16] get involved in that now that you in it
[2:03:20] you got to get out of it that means you
[2:03:24] may have to walk away from some things
[2:03:26] and it may cost you a lot it may cost
[2:03:32] you a lot but I guarantee if you put God
[2:03:36] first watch to see what he does for you
[2:03:40] Abraham did not get the blessing from
[2:03:43] God until life was gone from him you say
[2:03:47] that now look look around Abraham I see
[2:03:49] you know this is this is discount
[2:03:51] countless to saves on the shore the
[2:03:53] stars in the sky this is this is what
[2:03:55] you'll see gonna be like this is the
[2:03:57] blessing that I'm giving you a man he
[2:03:59] only got that out he's separated
[2:04:02] hallelujah
[2:04:04] now for the Brandon makes a statement
[2:04:06] that was Genesis 12 that he actually got
[2:04:08] his his justification this is what you
[2:04:10] know Abraham was not not any special
[2:04:12] person a man he was a man following Idol
[2:04:15] gods and all kind of things like that
[2:04:16] but God chose him because he saw
[2:04:18] something on the inside of him God chose
[2:04:20] you because he saw something on the
[2:04:21] inside of you now Genesis 15 brother
[2:04:24] Branham says Amen this is where
[2:04:28] sanctification encounter came in brother
[2:04:30] Branham brings us in Genesis 15 says he
[2:04:32] separated him when he completely obeyed
[2:04:35] and confirmed the covenant to him by
[2:04:37] blood he separated him when he
[2:04:40] completely obeyed and confirmed the
[2:04:42] covenant to him by blood
[2:04:43] now the separation actually took place
[2:04:45] in Genesis 13 but brother Branham said
[2:04:47] the sanctification of
[2:04:49] Abraham with Genesis 15 my god
[2:04:51] sanctification will deliver you from bad
[2:04:54] habits signification will deliver you
[2:04:57] from bad people sanctification to do
[2:05:03] that you want to know why because your
[2:05:05] nature is changing your desires are
[2:05:08] changing if they talking one thing you
[2:05:11] don't want to be talking that if they
[2:05:13] doing one thing you don't want to be
[2:05:14] doing that i'ma tell you this everybody
[2:05:17] that has really received a Baptist all
[2:05:19] the girls goes through this process
[2:05:22] shuts micaceous sanctification of
[2:05:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[2:05:27] Ghost is coming to make you live the
[2:05:30] life of Christ hallelujah now I'm
[2:05:35] looking at this because Genesis 17 is
[2:05:38] where he's placed as a sermon he
[2:05:41] receives the name of Elohim a portion of
[2:05:45] the name and that's his placing that
[2:05:47] brother Branham says he says not when he
[2:05:50] gets he goes from a man being Abram to
[2:05:53] Abraham he's actually receiving a part
[2:05:56] of God's name that's his place Oh glory
[2:06:00] to God I want I want to just I want to
[2:06:03] share something here because that's
[2:06:05] Genesis 17 but Genesis 16 he produced an
[2:06:11] ish male
[2:06:15] here this man that Ishmael created a
[2:06:20] problem not only for but Abraham's house
[2:06:24] but even Abraham see this smell now
[2:06:30] here's here's what I mean you know
[2:06:33] Ishmael was was was was produced because
[2:06:36] they compromise with the promise God
[2:06:41] told Sarah your wife gonna have us to
[2:06:43] have a son but she said why don't you
[2:06:45] take hey God my hand mate and why don't
[2:06:49] you have a son by her but that's that
[2:06:51] one what God had in his mind we can't
[2:06:53] make suggestions to help God God know
[2:06:57] exactly what he said
[2:06:58] Sarah thought what I don't care how old
[2:07:01] she is she's still gonna have a son they
[2:07:07] producing Ishmael Abraham fail for you
[2:07:09] notice this plan that Sarah presented to
[2:07:11] him and you know and God allowed it to
[2:07:13] happen to know I prefer a reason I if I
[2:07:16] could just just be bold enough to say
[2:07:17] that all things work together for good
[2:07:20] to them that love God to them who are
[2:07:23] the called according just some time it
[2:07:25] don't look good they don't look good a
[2:07:29] man
[2:07:30] don't feel good II but I'm still working
[2:07:33] together for good
[2:07:36] nothing happened in a child gods life
[2:07:38] that God actually why you're going
[2:07:47] through a Gaga people affecting your
[2:07:49] character hallelujah glory to God Church
[2:07:54] Ishmael was produced in Genesis 16
[2:07:59] hallelujah
[2:08:00] but Genesis 17 is where he received his
[2:08:03] place together son after this male he
[2:08:06] got a placing now that told me something
[2:08:10] predestination overrides every mistake
[2:08:16] [Applause]
[2:08:20] bless my heart destination will override
[2:08:25] every mistake in your life if God has
[2:08:31] predestinated you to the adoption
[2:08:32] children ain't nothing a devil can do to
[2:08:34] stop you from hitting it your mistakes
[2:08:37] can't stop you your failures can't stop
[2:08:40] you hallelujah
[2:08:41] I'm telling you what the prophets said
[2:08:43] that Abraham was was was placed in
[2:08:47] chapter 17 Genesis 17 that mean if you
[2:08:51] look back at his life before Genesis 17
[2:08:53] and all the things that he did God
[2:08:55] weren't even looking at all their
[2:08:56] mistakes I don't talk about the places
[2:09:00] of Abraham and his seed because the
[2:09:04] promise of Abraham flows down to us
[2:09:08] hallelujah just by us calling him
[2:09:10] Abraham we made him the father of many
[2:09:13] nations and Oh hallelujah church let me
[2:09:18] let me let me then I'll just read a
[2:09:19] little poem gift for you a man this
[2:09:22] gonna become an adoption part 3
[2:09:24] glory glory predestination overrides
[2:09:27] every mistake
[2:09:31] thank you Jesus
[2:09:34] he predestinated me up to the adoption
[2:09:37] of children a man he had this in this
[2:09:39] mind before I was even born
[2:09:41] look at this to statement out of
[2:09:43] adoption part 3 says watch this master
[2:09:46] teacher Paul the first thing it does is
[2:09:50] knock out all the ideas falling away
[2:09:53] knock out all that did ever being a
[2:09:56] Christian today and tomorrow I'm gone
[2:09:58] and the next day God condemned me and
[2:10:02] the next thing I'm back again up and

[2:22:26] we recognize and I said earlier that
[2:22:30] even though you know you you you you you
[2:22:35] you you come to spot a man where you
[2:22:38] have a placing it does not stop the
[2:22:40] trial from coming don't stop the trials
[2:22:43] from coming brother Brandon made a
[2:22:45] couple of statements now try to wine
[2:22:47] this up it says it was a number of years
[2:22:50] in Abraham's life that he moved from
[2:22:53] justification to sanctification love
[2:22:56] abuse time it has been trying to get to
[2:22:59] this process we don't heard it but we
[2:23:01] not living it it was a number of years
[2:23:04] that he went from justification to
[2:23:07] sanctification he says it was a lap of
[2:23:09] years from sanctification to the
[2:23:12] confirmation a man that the Holy Ghost
[2:23:15] had come he says but in the same chapter
[2:23:18] where he placed him after the Holy Ghost
[2:23:22] in the same chapter I'm sorry in the
[2:23:26] same chapter where he where he received
[2:23:28] a part of God's name he also got he got
[2:23:31] he got he got a there was a a
[2:23:33] confirmation that took place there in
[2:23:35] that chapter and that confirmation was
[2:23:38] something that Abraham's seed wore in
[2:23:40] the flesh which was a type of the Holy
[2:23:43] Ghost amen
[2:23:45] but you know once he got his placing
[2:23:49] hallelujah his name changed the Holy
[2:23:53] Ghost and let me just you know when he
[2:23:56] tells me let me just read this I never
[2:23:59] read this verse 1 in Genesis 17 when
[2:24:06] Abraham was ninety years old and nine
[2:24:09] the Lord appeared to Abram is stand up
[2:24:12] to him
[2:24:12] I am The Almighty God Almighty God walk
[2:24:16] before me and be that perfect now you
[2:24:19] know another part of this amen
[2:24:22] before I go further by being told that
[2:24:24] he's the Almighty God amen this is the
[2:24:28] name El Shaddai
[2:24:31] this this new attribute of God is
[2:24:35] introduced to Abraham and what brother
[2:24:38] Adam says this is where Abraham can get
[2:24:43] and what we need to do is is know him as
[2:24:47] El Shaddai the breasty God hallelujah
[2:24:52] amen find strength in the Old Testament
[2:24:55] find strength in the New Testament
[2:24:59] he's a breasted car that you can depend
[2:25:02] on whenever you're going through
[2:25:03] something stop depending on your own
[2:25:06] strength and depend on the breasted car
[2:25:13] hallelujah
[2:25:15] don't depend on Sarah's revelation the
[2:25:19] church is revelation depend on the
[2:25:22] breasted car when you get a little weak
[2:25:25] you can come up to the breasted card you
[2:25:29] can get strength for the journey glory
[2:25:32] to God hear hear
[2:25:35] Abraham gets a chance to know him as the
[2:25:38] breast of God gifts get strength from
[2:25:42] him a man has his name change and and
[2:25:46] but here the thing that I was telling
[2:25:48] said even you get to this point that
[2:25:51] don't stop the trials because I'm only
[2:25:53] in Genesis 17 hallelujah glory to God
[2:25:58] but you realize from Genesis 17 to
[2:26:02] Genesis 21 now in Genesis 17 Abraham is
[2:26:05] 90 and
[2:26:07] years old in Genesis 21 he's a hundred
[2:26:10] years old what happens at a hundred
[2:26:13] years old he receives his promised son
[2:26:18] glory to God but you know after he got
[2:26:21] that son he got a great trial great
[2:26:26] trial the same Sonny been waiting on for
[2:26:29] 25 years now God says bring that son up
[2:26:34] here to the mountain and offer him
[2:26:36] so what I'm telling us that the trials
[2:26:38] might get greater after your place in do
[2:26:43] you know after Jesus experiences placed
[2:26:45] in on Mount Transfiguration there was a
[2:26:47] Calvary waiting for him
[2:26:49] so the placing there's not only a man
[2:26:53] release a man this distance the
[2:26:55] supernatural power but the place and
[2:26:59] also breach of character and the
[2:27:01] subjection to the will of God oh it goes
[2:27:10] both ways
[2:27:12] Abraham was placed in Genesis 17 but in
[2:27:16] Genesis 24 he's asked to do something
[2:27:18] brother branham call it the final test
[2:27:22] can you handle it Church I said you
[2:27:25] can't I know you can you are
[2:27:28] predestinated unto all this you are
[2:27:31] predestinated oh my god you're placing
[2:27:35] or your adoption does not mean that you
[2:27:38] are immune from trials and failures now
[2:27:41] I want to put failures in there because
[2:27:44] even after is placing Abraham goes to a
[2:27:49] city that he had no business being
[2:27:55] I'm the yelling yelling I'm talking I
[2:27:57] left this place
[2:27:59] you only with me it after his place in
[2:28:03] he live
[2:28:07] please liar
[2:28:13] you told that man is not my wife this is
[2:28:18] my sister now he was telling part truth
[2:28:20] and some of the things that we do we
[2:28:22] tell part truth the reason you getting
[2:28:26] some of the benefits that you get the
[2:28:27] right now because you done total part
[2:28:30] truth you don't trust God to make a way
[2:28:39] for you gonna tell apart do you trust
[2:28:40] the government but you don't trust God
[2:28:45] hello somebody thinking that's a
[2:28:50] blessing that's what a lie
[2:28:53] come o somebody Abraham told that man
[2:29:00] that isn't my sister and it had to be
[2:29:04] God hallelujah could he get them that
[2:29:07] he'd done that before he got away with
[2:29:08] it and now even after his place in that
[2:29:11] nature see that bad name bad habits got
[2:29:15] to be sanctified them habits a goal from
[2:29:17] your life should be going from me Amen
[2:29:19] but here here he is here he is you know
[2:29:22] down there and anything they say this
[2:29:24] might this - my sister and God had to
[2:29:27] come down to the man in a dream King
[2:29:29] Abimelech had to speak to him in a dream
[2:29:32] and say don't touch that man's wife why
[2:29:35] and this man's having a conversation
[2:29:37] with God on a dream
[2:29:39] God did not you said wipe the man told
[2:29:42] me his sister if she even said that was
[2:29:45] her brother I know what they said but
[2:29:48] that's his wife and said you better not
[2:29:50] touch him if you're touching death it be
[2:29:52] all over this place say my lord you know
[2:29:55] what I say I want you to restore that
[2:29:56] man his wife and then athle restored
[2:30:00] I won't him the pray for you and I want
[2:30:07] you to I want you to this I want you to
[2:30:09] remember the spiritual because a bit
[2:30:12] let's say the lion God didn't call him
[2:30:15] like even though he was a lion God
[2:30:21] didn't call him like see you got to see
[2:30:24] yourself the way God sees you might be a
[2:30:30] deceiver but God don't call you to see
[2:30:33] trickster god no call you Playboy
[2:30:38] God don't call you see that's my prophet
[2:31:02] that was his place that's my prophet
[2:31:06] yeah I can tell you today God say that's
[2:31:08] my son that's my daughter
[2:31:12] yeah and I don't care what to label them
[2:31:15] wit they're still mine they might be
[2:31:19] mangled up mashed up all that accident
[2:31:23] life wrapped up but they still my
[2:31:26] children
[2:31:29] [Applause]
[2:31:33] you're police no adoption does not mean
[2:31:36] that you're immune from trials or
[2:31:39] failures abraham disobeyed by leaving
[2:31:42] the land and then he lied to Abimelech
[2:31:45] Abraham was given final tests of
[2:31:48] offering Isaac at Calvary which is a
[2:31:51] perfect type of Christ because Christ
[2:31:53] was offered on the same mountain that
[2:31:55] Isaac was offered on Jesus was adopted
[2:31:59] at Mount Transfiguration but he still
[2:32:01] had more trials to face he had to go to
[2:32:04] Calvary and church our adoption are a
[2:32:07] place that we protested it to we got a
[2:32:09] place at God and God wants us to walk in
[2:32:12] that but we got to come through
[2:32:13] justification we got to come through
[2:32:15] sanctification have it's gone in
[2:32:18] sanctification we got to be feeling the
[2:32:21] Holy Ghost so we can be put in service
[2:32:23] amen God has that for each and every one
[2:32:26] of us glory to God amen
[2:32:29] and let me tell you something the
[2:32:32] scripture said man's gift may grow for
[2:32:33] himself bring her for break man you
[2:32:36] ain't got to push yourself into nothing
[2:32:37] God gonna do it for you automatically
[2:32:39] and then it's the automatic thing God
[2:32:42] does this and he sets in the church
[2:32:44] these gifts for the edification of the
[2:32:46] church praise the Lord we found out last
[2:32:50] week - jewel
