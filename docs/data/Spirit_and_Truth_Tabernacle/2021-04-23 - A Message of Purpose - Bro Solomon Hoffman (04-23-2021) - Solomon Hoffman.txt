let's stand to our feet amen and uh let's welcome our precious brother solomon hoffman amen to the pulpit tonight uh as he comes amen will sing this song how great is our god amen say how great [Music] is i got oh sing with me how great is i gods hey and all we'll see how great how great he is say how great is i got yes sing with me how great [Music] how great how great is our god name above

we sing that one more time [Music] [Music] amen can you give him a lord and clap for praise hallelujah hallelujah amen he most certainly is uh greater than the greatest he's the higher than the highest amen there isn't no other powerful name there isn't no other name whereby men can be saved amen it's the most powerful name that god has given us and i think of what the prophet would say as we just looked to the lord in a word of prayer he would say as we stand praying in the name of jesus christ he said that it would be the same as jesus christ himself praying unto the father so let's just approach him now and ask him just to come and let's just take the limits off of god tonight i believe he's still ministering healings deliverances and victories and let's just ask him just to come and bless us now father we come to you lord in sincerity and lord just asking one more time tonight that you'd come upon the scene lord and father we pray that you just give us a word and do season dear god and lord truly there isn't no one that can touch us like you can lord there isn't no one that can speak to us like you can god and we're not here gathered together to see or to hear from a man lord but we're wanting to we're wanting to hear the king of kings and the lord of the lord speak a word of healing lord and speak a word of deliverance a word of encouragement god and we're asking that you come upon the scene one more time tonight lord and walk up the avenues and the aisles of our hearts and our lives lord and lord and just meet the needs of your believing children tonight god we're not here to be seen or to be heard lord but we want to see you tonight high and lifted up god we pray father that you would just anoint us now speaker and hearer like lord if there'd be any evil spirit here that would try to hinder the moving of your spirit or we condemn it in the name of jesus christ lord if there be any bad attitude or any evil thing we pray god that it would leave this building tonight lord and you'd have preeminence father or we ask that you just move the way you see fit tonight lord we'll be sure to give you the praise the glory and all the honor lord for you alone will be worthy of it we pray these things god humbly in the name of jesus christ amen and amen hallelujah amen if you have your bibles this evening we'll just go straight to the word in the book of first samuel the third chapter we'll begin reading in the first verse i'd like to say it sure is an honor and privilege to be here with you this evening and we certainly appreciate brother jack and the invitation to come and sure don't take it lightly to be speaking to another portion of the elect of christ and i know we say that a lot but i sure do mean it and sure counted the honor and privilege to be here and man we certainly enjoyed the fellowship with brother duff and just the spirit of god in his life and we certainly appreciate him in the church here we just say god bless you all and glad to have my wife here with me also sister gabrielle and we just said god bless you the book of first samuel the third chapter uh one verse of scripture here we'll read also in the book of proverbs and the 29th chapter first samuel 3 and 1 the bible says and the child samuel samuel ministered unto the lord before eli and the word of the lord was precious in those days there was no open vision we we know that brother branham would actually take a text out of that scripture quite often uh talking about how there wasn't an open vision there wasn't a direct word of the lord in that age amen there was no open vision also proverbs 29 the 18th verse proverbs 29 and 18 the bible says here where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he a man where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he we pray that god will bless the reading of his word as you may have your seats this evening if i would title the message tonight by the help of god i'd like to speak to you on the subject of a message of purpose a man a message of purpose looking here at that scripture in proverbs 29 and 18 uh we see uh the wisdom of solomon here where there is no vision the people perish now i really don't go into greek words very much but i just thought it was very powerful that meaning of perish there in the greek the word perish it means to let go to let loose to let alone to loosen oneself to show a lack of restraint to loose restraints on oneself and i i thought it was very powerful how that when there is no vision the people perish so in other words we could say well there is no vision we lose uh we lose restraint when there is no vision we loosen ourselves when there when there is no vision uh we're not about god's business when there is no vision uh we lose restraint of of what we're here to do is that right so in other words we could say without a vision uh it causes loose living without a vision we let go we uh without a vision we have no purpose we live loosely and we know here that a vision it's something that brings direction it's something that brings leadership it's something that brings guidance and we could say tonight that without a vision uh we could say that we're a ship without a cell amen without a vision we're a ship without a cell and we just go wherever the wind blows us and whatever comes it it pushes us over when we don't have a vision we don't have something we're fighting for we don't have something that we stand up for amen but i simply believe tonight that god has given a vision amen to the church of the living god amen and we're not here perishing we're not here loosening up amen we're not here becoming lukewarm we're not here becoming dry amen but i believe in all of my heart that the children of god in this age we're not here without a purpose we're not here without no leadership we're not here without any direction but i believe with all of my heart that we are being led by the same pillar of fire amen that led the children of israel out of egypt and you see when you're being led by the spirit of god it does not cause loose living it does not call taking off the restraints amen but it makes you dive into the word and show where you're living at hallelujah amen a vision of something to bring us direction and we notice if we're here without vision we're gonna it's gonna cause loose living if we're here without vision we've got no purpose we uh we've got no reason to do what we're doing and and we find you you look at people brother smiley uh when they lose a vision when they lose a purpose brother they become lukewarm they become dormant and the christian walk amen they don't hardly come to the house of god they don't hardly pray no more they don't hardly listen to the tapes no more they don't hardly do anything you say well the psalmist why is that it's because they have lost the vision they've lost a purpose amen they've lost the inspiration of god amen but i believe that the church of the living god does not have to be in that condition yes sir hallelujah thank you brother amen without a vision we're like a flower when the wind blows we just blow we just blow any direction now in the message doors and door 65 but the man would say here i like a man of vision i i like people that have something that they're fighting for amen not just lay around and say well whatever comes along it's gonna be all right he says no we ought to be up and at it amen and i think every christian ought to be that way amen find your purpose and go do it amen find your purpose and go do it amen can you rise up in faith and just take a prophet's word amen i like a man of vision i like somebody that has something they're fighting for not just lay around whatever comes to go it'll be all right he says oh we ought to be up at it i thank every christian ought to be that way and church let's just take the breaks off and preach for a moment amen i believe what we need to do amen is defy this lukewarm level to see in spirit and say god i'm not going to get likes in my christian life amen god i'm not going to lose the vision i'm not going to perish with the rest of the world hey remember we are a church amen that should have the vision of god and should be about the father's business amen that's what we ought to be hallelujah amen we've got something we're fighting for we've got something we're trying to achieve amen you see friends just a bit of a better foundation here amen when you find your purpose there isn't anything that's going to stop you amen when you find your purpose there isn't anything going to stop you you see church we have caught the vision we've caught the purpose under the message of our hour amen we see that we're not here just to barely get by amen we see we're not here just to be a lukewarm church are you with me amen we're not here to be a powerless church brother that's not our purpose amen that's not our purpose that's not the vision we're under that's not the purpose we're under i remember the vision we're under is that this church will be amen just like it was on acts the second chapter friends this church will not be a lukewarm church amen this church will not be a powerless church but brother this will be amen and acts 2 church amen with signs and wonders following amen that's what this church will be and i believe what we need is the same mighty angel of god amen to come into the building and energize our faith amen and put purpose back into the church and put purpose back into the lies hallelujah and put purpose back into the preachers amen i believe that god's wanting to do it tonight amen some of us have got lukewarm we've got cold we've got a little formal amen but i believe the king and kings and the lord of lords amen can take a handful of purpose and drop it back into a congregation amen somebody that's lost her zeal somebody that's lost a vision hallelujah amen i believe he can do it again yes sir i believe he can do it again he said my brother i i tried to do something for god i tried to do this and i went flat i tried to do this and somebody criticized me i tried to do this brother i tried to do something for god i tried to work for god one time and people said i was just trying to be somebody trying to be this hey man yeah brother you see the people that are saying that they're normally a critic and that right brother and they're just jealous of what you've done amen and normally critics brother critics critics normally ain't doing nothing but they'll be there and criticize you see some people god has placed in the church amen and he's given them a purpose of worship he's given them a purpose of praise and you say why would he do that because god knows he's got to get some children in the church that can create an atmosphere aiming to wear the pillow fire amen can come back into the building and i believe god's got some praisers here tonight amen we're here with a purpose we're here for a reason we're not here just to warm the pew amen but we've got a purpose tonight we've got a vision we've got a reason and being here amen and i defy every spirit out of hell that's trying to rob the purpose anyway maybe satan's trying to rob your purpose he's trying to rob your praise he's trying to rob your joy i remember can you receive purpose from the almighty tonight and say god i'm gonna take back my purpose and take back my seal and take back what the enemy stole oh god hallelujah i don't believe we just have to sit there and let the devil steal it i don't believe this loud of seeing spirit says just sit down just just just be relaxed don't worry about it friends this is not the time to throw in the towel preach somebody this is not the time to throw in the towel this is not the time to give up hey critics may rage amen the naysayers may come amen these that are speaking against the church but they're playing their part they've got a scripture to fulfill also but so do we the scoffers have a scripture to fulfill but so do we the scoffers are fulfilling their part but so are we hallelujah when you find your purpose there ain't enough devils to stop you hello when you find your purpose brother sister when you find your purpose there ain't enough devils in hell that can take that out of you i would to god that every person would leave this building with a purpose that we would leave this building with a leadership we would leave this building amen and we'd be about the father's business and we'd be about the word of god hallelujah i believe he can do it tonight he said brother i feel like i got no reason being here i feel like i got no reason being in church you've lost a vision you've lost a purpose hey my butt in one moment of time hallelujah god can send the fire of god just like he did on the day of pentecost he gave the disciples some purpose he gave him a reason and preacher he gave him a reason and being here church we're not here for no reason we're here with a purpose hallelujah some of y'all's here to say amen some of y'all's here to preach some of y'all's here to see some of y'all's here to be a housewife a saint and i whatever you are be the best that god has called you to be oh god don't let no devil stop you don't let no critics stop you don't let your neighbor stop you let's be what god called us to be hallelujah if god calls you to be a preacher be a preacher if god called you to be a dorm at me a doormat whatever he called you to be be what he called you yes sir yes sir [Applause] you just be what you are the great commission god wants you to be the way he made you keep that in mind y'all gonna preach me to death really soon [Applause] hallelujah you just be what you are god wants you the way he made you keep that in mind he wants you to be just what he's made you to be if it's a doormat be a doormat he said well i want to be the best doormat he ever had if i have to be a doormat or whatever it is in the house of god let me serve my service let me share my office the best that i can do brother i don't want to be a minister i believe brother jack could testify the same amen we don't want to be ministers that are here without a purpose i don't want to lose my focus of why i'm here we don't want to lose the focus of what we're here and what we're here to do and i believe there's so many people brother sister they get discouraged in their christian wall because they've lost a vision they've lost a purpose somebody came against them and they lost their purpose and their drive their ambition amen their determination amen but i tell you i believe god can restore it amen i believe god can restore the purpose he can restore the vision amen this message of the hour is a message of hallelujah now you see we even look at the ministry of our prophet brother branham or even really great men of god it seemed like there wasn't anything that would ever stop him he lost his baby lost his wife lost everything brother his world was turned upside down but he kept going he defied every law of man brother he had critics coming against his message what he was preaching what he was teaching you think you and i got some critics i tell you the prophet of our age has some critics nobody supported him at all at one point in his ministry you see making a stand on the word isn't popular making a stand on the word of god is not always a popular way but it is god's way amen and the prophet would also say when you stand with god amen god will stand with you when you stand with god y'all will stand with you by but just looking at this the ministry of willing branham amen everything that he would go through but yet he was still there you see what he had received he received a vision he received a purpose amen he received a message of purpose i mean just the same thing when he said i baptized down there on the ohio river he said well many of you were standing there 23 years ago right on the ohio river come right down to where i was at said it's john the baptist was sent before um the first coming of jesus christ your message will foreign the second coming of christ amen you see that was the message he had received and then that was the visitation he would receive and you see even the purpose of his life had been stabilized by the word that god had given unto him amen the purpose of his life had become stabilized by the word that god had given unto him and friends because of one man that would surrender his whole life to god amen there would be multi-thousands around the world hey man brother let's just face it tonight if he didn't go and do what he did we wouldn't be here i hope that's okay amen if he didn't go and do what he did i would have never been here brother jack wouldn't be here but you see what it was it was one man that god got in his hands and he had a vision he had a purpose that the message i'm packing will fall around the second coming of christ amen and he knew no matter what circumstance no matter what devil no matter what may come and what may go and the purpose of god will always be fulfilled amen the plan of god will always be fulfilled and because one man win and one man got the vision and one man caught the purpose but i tell you we're here now gathered together under the message of the hour amen and has brought rapture and faith back into the church of the living god it brought the god of the bible and pulled him out of the pages and put them back into the church yes sir you say what did it one man that called a vision now we have the revelation god did it through his ministry wasn't a man we're not lifting a man up we're lifting god up and i'm sure you all know but because one man had caught a vision one man that caught the inspiration he caught the purpose he knew hey no matter what comes no matter what goes i'm gonna fight with everything i've got i'm gonna press with everything of god it's because he caught the vision he caught the vision now we can look at all the great men of god brother they fought they fought and fought and fought seemingly and on unstoppable people seemingly unstoppable men of god but you see the reason they were unstoppable is because the leadership god had given them amen and god had a program and the program of god can never be stopped is that right but i want you to notice here just bearing in this area for a little bit even though the program of god cannot be stopped that does not mean satan won't be against it even though the plan of god even though the program of god cannot be stopped at all it's impossible to stop the plan of almighty god i mean the plan of the omnipotent god even though it can't be stopped that does not mean satan ain't going to try and that does not mean satan's not going to be battling that does not mean satan won't be fighting but it does mean it does mean as hard as he may fight it does mean as hard as he may punch as hard as he may blow there isn't any demon power that can stop the program of god and you may be fighting this evening you may be warned this evening hey remember take courage don't be weary and we'll do it if you're fighting that probably means that you've got something amen if this church wasn't fighting i'd be worried that brother jack wasn't fighting i'd be scared for you brother but because we're in a battle that means that god is on our side and satan would not be fighting us if he got us and the reason he's fighting is because he knows the program of god cannot be stopped he knows it can't be stopped but that ain't stopping him from trying that ain't stopping him from working but it's a good testimony to you ain't meant to know hey if he's fighting against me i must have something if you're not battling tonight you probably don't have nothing the devil's trying to steal hallelujah we've got a vision we've got a purpose among the book of revelation would show how the antichrist spirit will always try and come into the church make it lukewarm we all know the quote make it powerless try and defile it amen satan will always be working against the true church of the living god amen he'll always be trying to take away our purpose because when he takes away your purpose but you'll just sit there you'll just sit there and be a spectator in the service amen satan can rob us of our purpose and make us feel like we don't have any place in being here but he's got you whipped right there amen and he'll always be warring trying to make us feel like we don't have nothing isn't that right i'm the unchangeable god working an unexpected way amen who can stop god thank you buddy amen who can stop god you can't do it you can no more do it than you could easier stop the sun adam but you can't stop god his program will move on amen the program of god will move on let us quote here looking to the unseen amen when a man once catches that invisible the vision of the invisible god and knows that he's always present there is something that stabilizes that man's thinking notice here when the man catches a vision amen of the invisible god it stabilizes the man's thinking his actions and in the time of distress and trouble it'll make him look upward and above the things that are happening around them he says why amen because he's looking at the unseen amen we've called a vision of the unseen god and then we've got a direction of the unseen god while we've been given a purpose from the unseen god and it has stabilized who we are it stabilized our our actions and stabilized our purpose is that right hallelujah amen i think of this story here very powerful i know this is simple preaching tonight but it's what god's put on my heart and man looking to the unseen christopher columbus was given ships by the queen of spain it was in his heart he saw a vision that the world was round but he had hardly a way he could prove it he had nothing to do with it he had nothing to do with it but he was a man of vision amen christopher columbus had caught a vision he believed it and when the ship was given to him a bunch of prisoners cowards that was his church members a bunch of pullbacks amen a bunch of discouraged tried to discourage him say oh yeah just in a little while longer we're going to drop off the world a serpent will rise from the bottom of the sea i was going to pull this ship to the bottom and notice what they said they said now what do you say brave rover what are you going to now you said you said you had a vision you said you had a purpose in doing what we're doing and now it looks like we're at the end of the road amen you said you've got a purpose in doing what you're doing amen now we're at the end of the road what are you going to do he said you know what i say sell on amen sell on salon salon amen you see why he did what he did brother sister he caught a vision he had something he was fighting for he had something he grabbed onto and something that he believed and no matter the circumstance no matter what would come and no matter what goes amen i say to you tonight let's just sell on no matter the opposition let's sell on the night no matter the troubles no matter the oppression no matter the battles amen sail on spirit of truth tabernacle this is not the time to give in this is not the time to throw in the towel this is not the time to get relaxed and get loose i mean whether there's no vision you perish but you're not without a vision spirit and truth i mean we've got a purpose tonight we've got a reason i say to you tonight sell on so on and on and on don't give up brother child don't let go don't turn around amen don't drop the sword [Applause] hallelujah this is not the time to drop the sword this is not the time to lose the faith but if there was ever a time to fight this is the hour you say but satan's fighting but so are we [Music] hallelujah he said well satan's got some power but not power not more powerful than our god hallelujah he said but satan he says and he's that but brother amen the devil is not above the believer why do you think god would call us kings and priests world order there's nothing higher than a king levitical order nothing higher than a priest he said you're a king and you're a priest because there ain't nothing higher than you but god oh brother there ain't nothing higher than you but god there ain't no depression there ain't no sickness there ain't no covenant 19 whether there ain't no spirit out of hell i mean that's above the believer but jesus christ has conquered already hallelujah he's conquered death helen the grave glory to god amen to thank this evening amen this is what we are we're men of vision we're a church of vision we're a church of purpose brother let me tell you something christopher columbus had called a vision no matter what came in his life and no matter what would go he was going to prove what he was talking about but let me tell you i'm a man of vision also i've called a vision by the jack brother oh god i think of what the prophet would say about moses he said there was moses he looked out that same window that pharaoh looked out of pharaoh looked out that window amen what did he see with a smiley a bunch of mud daubers bunch of slaves bunch of nobodies but fair but moses oh brother moses would look out the same window you say what was he looking out of he was looking out of the eyes of god the eyes that said i'm gonna bring my people out with a strong hand you say what was he looking at he was looking out the same window but he had a different set of eyes because he knew what god was about to do he knew what the purpose of god would be and he looked out through that window and said them's the children of god that's the children of the most high that's the children that god amen is going to bring out of egypt with a strong hand and i as a minister of the gospel i'm looking through a different set of eyes tonight and i'm looking at the people that's going to go in the rapture amen in between 6 and nine you say what are you looking at i'm looking in a different field of view i'm not seeing the discouragement we're not seeing the problems we're not seeing the issues we're seeing the word of god we're seeing what god said about you hallelujah he said you're the sinless virtuous bride that's what he said i am and brother you may call me crazy you may call me what you want to but i just happen to believe everything god said about me hallelujah i believe every word he said [Applause] oh god [Applause] moses saw the children of god he saw the people that god would bring out of egypt with a mighty hand you see what he was doing he was looking through the eyes of faith now but let me tell you something i hope this means something to you i don't care what any man says about you i don't care what any critic says about you we have caught the vision of what the church of the living god will be we are a church with purpose you say what's the purpose the purpose is back to the word the purpose is go back to the word amen what the purpose is we've got a purpose in our heart brother sister amen everything god said we would be as what we're going to manifest and that's what we're going to be yes sir but we're not here just fighting the wind amen but the message of the hour has brought us a vision of purpose amen has brought us a vision of purposes brought us something amen that we're to strive for is that right amen uh the message of the eye would come and tell us what the church of the living god will be amen churches book he would say amen that the church of the living god will be a continuation of the book of acts now brother not might be not possibly be not it may be if you're good enough no but the church of the living god will be a continuation of the book of acts but you'll have the same power you'll have the same authority i mean brother you'll have to say your brother you'll have the same anointing of the spirit of god as i ride even the same holy ghost they have then i mean they walk by the gate called beautiful silver and gold have a number what i have i give it unto thee but that's the same experience we've got we've got the same word experience that's what we've received in this generation hallelujah oh brother amen the world is just fulfilling their part aiming the world is just fulfilling their part and my brother believe the sign they're fulfilling their part is that okay i don't believe the silence fulfilling their part i'm just gonna preach for a moment give the devil a black eye with the dove and somewhere there's been people that's left a message that means on the law of contrast somewhere there are some people that's gone into the deeper depths of the message mean somewhere there's a church that's lost a fire of god and grown cold that means somewhere amen god's got a church that has the fire of god and the show kind of glory amen inside the church of somewhere the preacher has left a message that means somewhere god's got a man in his hands that's went deeper in the depths of the message of somewhere amen there's been people growing cold on god that means somewhere god's got some people getting more on fire the holy ghost you say but brother we've been believing this thing for 20 years 30 years and i'm getting more excited all the time about the message of the hour brother i'm not going to call about it i believe it more today that i believe that then we believe it more today than we believed it when we started it you say how i've got a purpose we've got a purpose tonight we're not here without any reason god has given us a purpose brother and i believe it more now than i ever have to you the purpose of god will never be defeated oh hallelujah [Applause] brother the hours come let's just face the facts this is manifest in time brother they're manifesting what they are out in the world they're manifesting what they're made of but i've got news for the devil even though satan's children is manifested in what they are so our gods amen even though the children of darkness are manifesting what they're made of so are we church this is the hour of the manifestation of the word of god this is the hour of but the bride's revival the releasing of the word anointing is upon the church right now we're not waiting for it to come we're not looking for a purpose to come but it's right here it's right now we've received it tonight hallelujah we will be at john 14 12 church signs will be following the believers brother i don't know about you but somebody somewhere will fulfill what the message said somebody somewhere is going to fulfill everything god said this brother somebody somewhere will fulfill mark 16 in action we will fulfill john 14 12 but we will fulfill everything the word of god said we will oh god i feel like a million votes either we believe it or we don't believe it either we believe what god said or we don't believe it amen how many believers we got in the building oh we've got some on god's side brother we believe what he said we will be denied let's walk into it the devil ain't got enough to stop it the devil ain't got enough to stop us you say he's against us that means he don't have you we're people let's receive vision oh god i know it sounds crazy i know it sounds unbelievable but somebody's gonna do it this is the hour we're gonna fulfill our purpose there's gonna be a people i'm not saying there's gonna there is a people on the earth that they will speak the word of god and god will perform it but i tell you if god could get in a dry bone of a mule brother if god can get in a dried-out jaw of a mule and anoint something to kill a thousand philistines and then what could he do when he gives him the jawbone of the bride of jesus christ we'll speak what the spirit says we'll speak what the word of god says we'll speak what the message is saying amen somebody's gonna be it somebody's gonna fulfill it i say god why not me amen why not tonight why not to not be a special service amen that we receive back the joy we receive back the purpose maybe some of you tonight has lost your purpose maybe some of you the devil has stole your vision he stole your purpose he stole your joy he stole your reasoning preaching the gospel but he stole it from you and robbed it from you and you're all bent out and you're all discouraged and because the devil has robbed your purpose and what i would do tonight is say god i want to receive a handful of purpose amen back into my life and god amen give me the seal of the hour god give me give me back my zeal give me back my purpose and give me back my vision amen church we need it tonight and we need to receive it tonight we need the vision we need the purpose and this message is a message of purpose oh brother if he could get in a jawbone and bring purpose to a jawbone what could he do with his children what could he do with his children that would fully surrender into the hands of god and i say what we need is a surrenderance i'm going to say god use me in any way you can use me in the way you see fit amen give me back a purpose give me back a drive give me back a reason and be in here i believe he'll do it brother i tell you amen god's got a purpose for our life god's got a purpose for this church amen if it was up to you and me i'm going to strike a chord if it was up to you and me we were to give up a long time ago in fact many of you did many of you did give up i mean many of you said i'm done with it but on sunday morning brother there was an unseen pool aiming to grab you by your or your suit coat and junk you back into the house of god you said why did he do it i mean because the choosing of god has ever changed the purpose of god has never changed the program of god has never changed and brother you may give up on god you may lose your purpose but god has not given up on you and god has not lost his purpose on you and will never lose his purpose and will never lose his program you say but i give up but he didn't he said but i lost my vision but he didn't hallelujah he'll give it again brother what did you do when they spoke all e rather they spoke all manner of evil against you they spoke all manner of evil against you but they said all kinds of evil things you felt like well i might as well just get all discouraged and give up and stop trying and stop fighting and just throw in the tower no sir no sir we're a people that's received a greater vision than that but there ain't enough that can stop us there ain't enough critics there ain't enough naysayers there ain't enough power there ain't no principality amen in simple words the devil don't have enough oh brother i'm just getting out of where i want to be [Laughter] hallelujah amen he wouldn't by the way i'm in the message here the voice of god 63 he would actually take this text here amen and say no it's a very outstanding time we realize that we're speaking from the scriptures there was no open vision of the days of samuel he said now where's there's no vision the people perish we must have a vision amen visions comes to the prophets the word of the lord spoken to them he said that something like it is today i think the church the organization and the nominations they've been on the field for a long time they're beginning to get laxed and the work of the lord is being left undone the word of truth because the church itself has become dim sided and we need today the voice of god to speak among us and bring us back he said bring us back to why bring us back to a purpose amen bring us back to our vision i mean that's what he's saying there we've been on the field for a long time we're getting likes the work of the lord is being left undone amen the church itself is beginning dim side we need today the voice of god to speak among us and to bring it back church i say he's done it amen to thank that the voice of god has spoken in this generation it spoke purpose back into the church of the living god it has spoken life back into the church but it spoke the it spoke the the manifestation of the word hallelujah i think he'd send his voice in this generation amen to bring back the vision of the church of the living god now i think it's very powerful here he says the coming of the prophet is a sinus overlooked by the people every time they overlook it they never get it somehow lets those that eyes are open those who are elected to see it they do see it the coming of a prophet was a sign that god is ready to speak because if god ain't ready to speak the prophet would not be on the earth now remember that he would not be on earth unless god was ready to speak that's the way he speaks is through those channels the unchanging god never did do it any other way this is always god's way of making this voice known unto the people he sends his prophet amen he sends his prophet with a message of purpose back into the church amen give us something to fight for brother i tell you amen we're in uh we're in a generation that there's so many people that they've lost their meaning of life almost they've lost their purpose of life amen let's just take our halos off tonight we've been there i've been there you've been there we think god what am i even doing anybody ever been there okay got a couple i don't feel too bad we've all been there we felt like god i feel like i ain't got a reason in being here i don't have a purpose in being here no longer i feel like i'm not useful brother the message of the hour has come it said you evangelists that are out there with a god called gift they asked him a question said brother the man should evangelist continue in the field he said yes get out there if you got a god called gift preach with everything you've got amen preach with every ounce of strength in you and don't stop amen until there ain't no more breath out of your body and even when the breath is out of your body you can leave a legacy behind that'll still be preaching and then because you lived a life amen according to the word of god hallelujah the voice of god is spoken in this generation it's brought back purpose and trying to find a place to close it's it's brought back purpose it's brought back our reason and doing what we're doing faith this evicted 58. he says oh you can't purpose anything of god's promise in your heart without finding reality to it he said if your soul has been tormented by sins and doubts ups and downs frustrations he said and there's something down in you notice here and there's something down in you telling you that somewhere you can overcome it he said why you just flown around from church to church place to place he said just kneel down he's talking about finding purpose again he says you can't purpose to find anything from god without finding the reality to it there's something down in there telling you there's something more you can't overcome that he says why do you float around church to church he said just kneel down until you strike heaven as i said last night go beyond the sound barriers then you'll have a purpose in life you'll have a purpose belonging to the church you'll have a purpose in being baptized you'll have a purpose in what you're seeking for ain't that powerful there he says to get a purpose go beyond the sound barrier break past that barrier break into the shekinah glory break into the presence of god and you go beyond that sound barrier he says you'll have a purpose in life you'll have a purpose and belonging to the church amen coming to a close maybe something's got in your way tonight of you fulfilling your purpose and i believe that god can give purpose back you believe that i believe god can restore purpose i i know this i know this virus has done some damage to people spiritually and being out of church and things and growing cold on god i've seen it a lot i'll tell you in just one moment in the presence of god brother it can bring back the zeal of god i think of what brother branham would say he said one man and in the presence of god did more from moses in 70 years of schooling i'm persuaded what we need tonight is to be in the presence of god and receive a purpose and say god i want to know something i'm fighting for i want to have a purpose in doing what i'm doing i want to feel like i want to feel like i've got a true leadership and a true direction i believe he can give it tonight i mean maybe satan's robbed you of your zeal your prayer life your purpose but maybe he's robbed your victory or your shout used to being on fire of god full of purpose in your life and now you've grown cold i believe he can do it again musicians can come amen the prophet would say that jesus was willing to get rid of anything that would separate him from the fellowship between him and the father amen the earthly ministry of christ he was he was willing to get rid of anything that wasn't necessary in his life that would be hindering him and the fellowship with the father i i think that sometimes we let some little things get in the way i mean we let some little things get in the way between us and our walk with god and we've lost our purpose and something's got between you and god and i wonder tonight as we bow our heads if it should humble our spirits father maybe there's someone in here tonight god and they've lost their purpose or they've lost their zeal and serving you they've lost the joy that they once had god they used to be a happy christian excited to come to the house of god but we nearly have to beg them now god and maybe you're dealing with that hard and god i wonder if there'd be anyone in there that would say god that's me if you just like to stand to your feet this evening and say god i want you to rekindle my zeal god i want you to get my purpose back god i want you to give me back what i had and put the fire back on the altar put the zeal back on the altar if you like to raise your hand to him and say god i want it tonight amen hands up all over the building lord jesus your children tonight god their hands are lifted up lord lord i pray that you bring a handful of purpose here tonight god i pray that you bring a handful of purpose lord lord and drop it here in the place tonight god lord maybe someone's lost their joy in serving you and they want it back lord maybe someone's lost their their zeal and serving you or they've lost their zeal and preaching the gospel they've lost their zeal lord but they want to come back and receive purpose lord i pray you give it to him lord [Music] as we worship you deal with your children now lord we pray let's stand to
