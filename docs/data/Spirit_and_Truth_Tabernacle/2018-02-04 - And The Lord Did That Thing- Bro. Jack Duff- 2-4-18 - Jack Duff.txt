I see you gonna be a new man in a few weeks god bless you so good to have your man in the house of the Lord just a couple of things I just need to make mention of amen I wanted to thank you if those of you that have not had the opportunity and we have these little forms there on the on the table that you go out but a few weeks ago we had our business meeting and we are on a journey to church voted and we all own a journey three years we had voted for three years to pledge three thousand dollars a year towards our church building front so for the next three years ask people to commit to three thousand dollars a year and that will allow us to raise roughly three hundred thousand dollars and thirty-five people committed to three thousand dollars a year for the next three years that allowed us raised about three hundred thousand dollars for us to be able to get our own church we paying out a lot of money in rent a man but we want to be able to have our own and and we so we voted we talked about it voted and now if you have not been able to fill out one of these we're asking that amen those that are a part of the church if you would take a pledge form fill it out put your name on it sign a man that you you'll be a part of this a manna just drop it in a little it's like a little box there just drop it in a box but we just kind of just just want to know you know just what what what everybody's going to be able to just contribute to if you can't do two full $3,000 whatever it is but we want everybody to be a part of this blessing because God's getting ready to do something special amen I believe so we're asking that everyone do that and and I want to thank God for those that have completed their pledge and turned it back in we thank God for that we're I won't give the number yet as to what we were expecting until everybody had a chance to to do it so I'm announcing that again today if you haven't done it then blaz'd please do that and put it back in there as soon as possible the other thing that you'll see out there is we have these letters that are written here from the church something that the Lord just gave me to to write and we're asking that you take that different people in your life that God might have you to just give one to that want to be a part of this journey with us amen and pledging towards us trying to get our own place you know please please just you know whoever you feel led to give it to it and give it to them and you know we'll just you know we'll both certainly appreciate that so but we want to just begin our journey to amen to exit renting and starting to own amen nothing wrong with that right a man and I believe I believe this is a season for us to be able to do that so since we voted on it we're all in amen I'm asking everyone please give a form back amen just showing your commitment as to what you'll be doing praise the Lord couple other things I need to make mention of I was I had a little sermon in my heart that I was going to preach but I just kind of felt leading not to go in that direction but I was talking last week about coming off of Facebook a man for at least a week and my primary reason for saying that is it's order to contain right I was going to preach a sermon on containment and I won't give you the whole you know thing today but in order to sometimes contain viruses you have to disconnect people from the virus all right all right so sometimes sometimes you have spiritual viruses that are spreading and the only way that you can be safe from the virus is you have to disconnect right so and and and the purpose for disconnecting you is to contain the virus we don't want to see other people get sick all right spiritually sick so so so we that's why I actually just just kind of when it's you know especially some of this stuff is just nonsense y'all so it's best that you just kind of get away from some of it right and you know and and and you know there's different ways that we handle things but but that's why I brought that out last weekend and I do you know I have a sermon developed around that but I won't preach it day I'll just I'll save it hey man I'll save it I've just kind of felt that uh maybe me coming out and preaching it right now it might get real close to some things it might be misunderstood and I don't want the Word of God to be misunderstood amen I want you to catch what God is trying to say to you but a man if even if you feel led Amanda to fer to remain contained stake disconnected alright Amen if you feel led as soon as you see some nonsense you need to be running for your life don't try to ant don't try to answer questions Paul actually tell you to avoid foolish questions ain't man it's so some that means Paul did not answer every question it's not that he running from it this man revealed two thirds of the New Testament but he still didn't answer every question right I mean I got it I got a quote that i'ma share it with y'all i'ma let y'all read that I'll tell you about it right now but there was one time a brother walked up and gave brother branham a book he said when you get a chance just read this and brother branham took the book you say okay and he took the book and he laid it on top of his Bible and he said it in his office and and the Holy Spirit told him take that mess off my Bible now I'm I don't I think it was the word mess but it was something that serious take that mess or that junk something like that off my Bible and now here the prophet who the word come to and God telling him not to read some a prophet right so if a prophet would be warned don't read that then we got to be warned as well you know some things don't read you don't want certain things going into your spiritual wound because once you allow certain stuff into your spiritual womb it will give birth and many of us just don't realize sometimes we wrapped up in something don't even know what we into because somebody might leave and say a little something over here and you might have just a little agreement but they trying to pull you into something a little further than where you want to go I'm time I contain men all right I can't preach it today but I'm just dropping that off for the church that that's you know that I gave you a Leviticus because there were certain things when it got to leprosy only certain people could handle it only the priests were designated by God to handle leprosy but now we got everybody else trying to diagnose look look look you know you you don't have if you're not a doctor certain things you probably should be working on all right I mean it just that's just the way it is this we got a issue here doc but you find a doctor that means somebody drop in here and they they you know maybe they pressure go down or something like that and then they drop here you looking for somebody with a certain skill set when you go to the hospital you're not going to stop and talk to the person at the reception that's if you got some serious pain that person can't help you at all they can do is take your name and sometimes you get frustrated with them because look I'm in pain and I don't need you asking me all these questions find me somebody that can help me I get the questions answered later see we got people that's designated to handle certain issues all right but it's all about containment right that's what it's all about but I that's just a prelude to some of it you'll get more later on a man but I'm just kind of giving you just a general warning because the enemy is at work and I miss the devil the devil is busy a man but I think God want to just give us victory in every area so I just I just appreciate the Lord and and I told y'all on Friday night no not not Friday which we do appreciate the tape we heard on Friday night brother branham brought out a statement about people it's snowing they won't go to church but there's a basketball game you know getting ready to happen in that same city and the doors was packed you know I mean you couldn't stop people from going in they didn't go to church but they did go to the basketball game and they said your God is a piece of flat air that's two people God is they worship the ball all right I'm Ali that alone they worship the ball they'll put the bottle before God all right Halen but we want to put God in us in his proper place hey man so you know we we just we just we want to honor God amen he's the one that give us our life I held that strength and everything else so we want to honor him but but we appreciate that tape amen on on Friday night but Wednesday night I was talking about hurt people will hurt people hurt people will hurt people and and and if you're just if you if you're spiritual and you can listen to hurt people you'll see how their hurts are hurting other people and and and and that's not the solution just by you talking about it you need to Liveris you need God to bring some healing to your body your inner man needs to be healed because if your inner man was here you would be talking the way you're talking and acting the way you acted but your intimate your inner man is suffering and and hurt people actually hurt other people amen their actions doing so you know I want you to be careful Church be very very careful don't know feed on a lot of nonsense the stuff that ain't going nowhere ain't gonna change iiiiii remember the preacher used to say all the times he say let the dogs bark the caravan is moving on right so when you see dogs just barking at a car that's moving I ain't never seen the owner get out of the car and you know try to stop the dogs from barking they just keep driving because eventually they know that dog I realize I can't keep up with that car and that dog is running it just turn and go back home and that's all that's happened you got dogs barking but you just keep moving on praise the Lord I hope y'all can understand so let me move on this week we had a we had a little something come up I should say something come up but we were out and and took our students bowling and they probably not gonna tell everybody a man that I thought I beat him a man and sisters of mine have praise the Lord [Laughter] beat him in bowling and but but while we was there I was just noticing you know something there was a group of men that had kind of kind of come and they start bowling as well he's just observing them and observing them and in my spirit I picked up and just deserves it he's men or men that are coming from all over the US and they're coming here to Florida because they probably have some type of addiction and they they want to be free from that addiction and and I just begin to process and think about that and it just hit me is like you know what South Florida Palm Beach County is the capital for people that are trying to break addictions they come here to Palm Beach County and I say Lord what if we were able to get some type of outreach opportunity where we could go into one of these homes and just be able to preach the gospel to the people because what happens is that pretty much every 30 days you're getting a new group of people that's coming in and you get a chance to sew something in them they may not stay here but they may go back home transformed by the word of god that was spoke to his fear so I say I I start praying I'm gonna exit Church which I'll be in prayer with me that God would open up some door for us to get in and just Cantor just just just just begin to work with people God has done some things for people in this congregation you got testimony that people need to hear that God is real God can set you free God can deliver you right we got people here that need to share those testimony so you know y'all not be in prayer that God would just open up some doors even if you hear you know maybe something where we might be able to come in I'm thinking you know just like we do pinnacle Palms because you know clinical problems we've been praying about that as the Lord is this where you want us to stay or do you want us to do something else and if God opens up another door we're gonna walk in that but until that door opens we'll stay where we are right so you know but I just want y'all to just be in prayer because we're looking for opportunities that we can be of an impact to those that in our community I think we have people just bump we bump it into them every day and just let them go right by but we have the hope that they need we have the help that they need it lays with inside of us Church so we have to have a burden to get out there and share these things with others and I just want I want to take that and lay that in the lap of the church a man it goes beyond these four walls we got to get out there and help somebody a man we're not trying to just get members in the church we're trying to get people back to heaven some I'm gonna lost a weight here on earth but we're trying to just get them back to heaven let them know you come from God and you got to go back to God hallelujah so Church just please keep us in prayer we're looking for that and we know the devil fight us as we as we try to pursue it but nonetheless we're gonna do that and the other thing that happened this week we at the school we have this person that kind of comes in once a week and you know they do do some things and and this lady she my wife was telling she stopped her the lady was trying to get the address to the school and somehow she pulled up the address to the church and then it got the came to the website of the church and as she started when she went to the website of church just looking for the address she heard singing on the website and when she heard the singing on the website she came and asked my once you see now is this building here a part of what y'all do here is it the same but no it's not the same but it is you know our church you say I went to your website and I heard y'all sing as they oh my goodness I never heard singing like that and she say this thing and just really did something to me and I say my god I begin to think church and sometimes we don't realize we come up when we sing a little song and you know think that's something but you don't know how that is ministering to somebody in church as we get ready to go out here you know you can't went went when they went to battle they put the singers up front right you got you have a ministry you God gave you that gift for a reason and it's got to be used for his glory right but but we you know when we when we get ready to do the tip we gonna do things a little different we're not just gonna have a song service we might do we might have a little little praise team in the tent three or four singers man y'all get the anointing going in here because this is what we need in order to break these chains Church I'm just trying to lay it all out before men we're going to do war and everybody gotta be in a place so don't sit on your gift we came that you do that it's blessing people right so some kind of way we got it we got to pull together and we got to do what God has called us to do a man and God didn't call us just to come sit on these pews there are chairs that's not it we got to get out and we got to do something we got to make an impact in our community so church I'm telling my sick the singers y'all get ready a man everybody that can be used to do something there might be something else where I don't say I'm doing it you can pass out tracts you can smile at somebody you can give somebody a hug and tell them Jesus love them you can do something they need a guard with peeing on them you betta God with skin on we all have a responsibility in church this is the beginning of the year we just setting it right we're trying to set it right but this is where we're trying to go last year was raise the octave here's the octave God has given us the after we're raising it and we're going out we're gonna do something and I pray that everybody feeling bored I pray your be on board with this if you can't go I pray you you at least be praying for us and and I'm saying if you can't go and some of us it's a one there's one thing if we can't go and it's another thing when we just don't go right and if you can't go we understand but if you can't go we want to see you involved sometimes even people see them other cars and the tent they wonder who that is they don't know that y'all part of the church right they just see a whole bunch of cars there - 10 don't go to the Tennessee one cop praise the Lord everybody got to be involved in this but if we did go to attend and it was only one person come we gonna preach the gospel to that one yeah I'll know what happened at the white moody right he was only one in the 10th we gonna be faithful nah I ain't man I learned how to be faithful all by myself I learned how to worship all by myself I can do a lot of stuff by myself but I think it's better when we all work together a man a man a man all right I think that's all I need to announce and and I will turn my attention towards the word musicians thank y'all so much that we certainly appreciate you all just a real blessing real blessing I want you all to remember mr. Brown is there any other update on brother David okay that brother David Foxworth he's come here to the church and relatives to [Music] sister Linda sister Browne it's just a lure the cousins I believe and but brother David is really going through yesterday his heart stopped I believe four times and they had to revive him four times the last night I was I was at the hospital and you know just praying with him and praying for him and you know got a chance to see some of the other family members and you know and things of that nature but the doctors have not given him a favorable report it's really gonna take God a man at this time so it would please remember brother David Munar and his family in prayer and you know we just were just trusting God and I was telling the sister last night on the phone it's not I will but it's the will of the Father and we just you know we want God's will to be done you know so just you know we just just please they they they have to make a lot of decisions and it's not easy you know during the time like this so please remember the Fox Worth family in your prayers and man they could they could certainly use it at this time praise the Lord you all stand with me a man we will have a word of Prayer and then we'll turn to a couple scriptures and I'll let you be seated amen let's just bow his father we come before your presence we want to come on behalf of the Foxworth family God - yesterday was a pretty rough day there for brother David and all the things that he was going through with us with his body God the doctors have given us their report but we want to see what you have to say about it so God while there's breath in his body we're gonna ask that you touch him there's nothing too hard for you even though we hear this we still say there's nothing too hard for you so god we're just we're just trusting you that you would lead direct each person through this process through this time we just we look to you god that's all we can do is look to you so we pray that you would be involved touch his body touch the family give strength Lord to each and every one and may you be glorified we we thank you that you brought sister Laura out of the hospital doctors couldn't find anything they ran tests couldn't find anything that shows that your hand does that work and if you can do it for her you can do for him so father we just we just commit them down to your capable hands as we turn our attention to the Word of God we pray that the Holy Spirit would take control over the thought today and may you get all the glory may you get all the honor that you get all the praise from everything that would be spoken and everything that would be received it's in Jesus name we pray a man a man turn with me to two portions of Scripture I want to tell you what I started Exodus 7 and then I'll go to John 5 as well we're trying to kind of tie a couple of things together here and we'll see how the Lord takes it Exodus 7 just verse 1 and 2 then I want to go over to John 5 it says here nexus7 says and the Lord said unto Moses see I have made thee a god to Pharaoh and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet this is a powerful statement I have made the year God to another person he's a God to Pharaoh right I've made the Agard to Pharaoh now that that should not shock us too much right because if a a cat gives birth it should be another cat if a dog gives birth it should be another dog if a monkey gives birth it should be another monkey and if God gives birth it should be God so I have made the a god to Pharaoh and Aaron thy brother shall be that prophet thou shall speak all and that's the key thing that I want us to try to catch there thou shall speak all that I command thee and Aaron thy brother shall speak in the Pharaoh that he that he send the children Israel out of his land amen let's turn over here to John five and we will just read this I'll start at verse 14 and John five praise the Lord it says this after what Jesus found with him in the temple and said unto Him behold thou art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing come unto thee the man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus which had made him whole and therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the Sabbath day but jesus answered them my father worketh hitherto and I work therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the Sabbath but said also that God was his father making himself equal with God then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you could be seated praise the Lord I'll wait to give you my title if I could just have you read Amen a couple more scriptures with me we will take off from there turn with me the first Corinthians chapter 6 and while we're getting this do I have anybody in here that would be honest a man and say that the Lord has brought you from a mighty long way I want you to just kind of get in your mind a man before we get started I want you to get in your mind just just maybe some of the things the Lord has brought you from write some of that some of the things that God has done for you you know they used to have a thing you can't tell me let me tell me what the Lord has done for me you know and and and if God has brought you from somewhere God has done something for you delivered you from something or whatever you know you ought to get that in your mind and just just just just think on that and we're gonna read these scriptures and we'll we'll go from there first first Corinthians chapter 6 verse 9 says this know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators and some of us has been delivered from fornication nor idolaters praise the Lord Amen we talked about that they brother branham talked about that basketball that was idolatry right he says because that became that got before God God don't want nothing in front of him he's got to be first right nor idolaters nor adulterers God has delivered us from some of these things nor effeminate now if you don't understand what that word is that's homosexual ISM and if God has not delivered anybody here from that Amen I want you to understand that you can't avoid every homosexual you see because the Bible said that some of the effeminate we're gonna be delivered somebody that's effeminate will be the living no it's not acceptable Bible even tell us that you can't even make it to heaven like that y'all want me to read it again a verse 9 says know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind and there's a lot that's involved in that right abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves you can't steal and go to heaven nor covetous a man nor drunkards you can't drink and go all right nor revilers nor extortioners cheap people you can't do that and go none of that gonna inherit the kingdom of God right she'll inherit the kingdom of God and verse 11 says and such word that I like that word I used to be that way this this was my testimony but but when Christ came in I became a new creation right I'm a new creature in Christ right so so such were some of you but ye are washed amen but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God I see something you know read in that particular scripture if any of us were guilty of some of the things that I just read you can go back in your mind you can see where the Lord brought you from and you can look at your neighbor and say won't he do it won't he do it I want to do it tired of the day and the Lord did that thing the Lord did that thing God is a good God and he's doing some great things in our myths so let me just you know work my way into this the Lord did that thing here I want to read from a man I was gonna read another scripture but I'll bypass that right now I'll give it to you for homework you can go read Ephesians 2:1 through 10 you can see how God brought you from a mighty long way but I want to read a quote here from blind Bartimaeus and and we're circling you know bringing our way back over here to John 5 and just using that you know the Lord did that thing the Lord the Lord did that you know you couldn't deliver yourself you couldn't get yourself free from some of the stuff that you was involved in but God did it a man the Lord did that thing alright so so here here I wanna I want to just kind of take this blind Bartimaeus says this now Jesus that I might speak to you this way when he was on earth he did not claim to be a healer he claimed he only did as the father showed him to do is that right how many ever read that in the Bible you know st. John 5:19 that Jesus Christ himself never healed anybody no he said I do nothing till the father shows me first what to do he saw a vision of what to do and then he did what the father told him he said that in his words of course it's true isn't it st. John 5:19 when he said verily verily I stand to you the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that doeth the son likewise now he had to tell the truth because he was infallible he was the son of God and God amen and God Himself was in Christ reconciling the world to himself the body the man was Jesus son of God but the spirit in him was Jehovah itself tabernacle here in human flesh in order to take away sin he goes on says did you ever notice the great thing why God did that now God had to be made flesh because it wouldn't be right if somebody else was flesh and if God was a man of flesh who sent a different man to make two men having two guys it wouldn't be right see because God Himself can send somebody else and be just and then if he pronounced the penalty he had to take it himself in order to do it he had to make himself a body which was a creative son Jesus Christ Himself dwelled in this for the suffering made himself a little lower than the Angels to take the suffer for sin and for sickness now I wanted to just kind of bring that because even here the prophets terms that Jesus himself was not the one that would do the healing it was it was God that was doing it God was showing him where to go God would show him who to come in contact with God was doing all these things and as God did that then you know the supernatural would take place when we read in John 5 you know what happened Jesus felt led a man that to go down here to this this the sheep gate the Sheep market it was a pool there that the Pool of Bethesda you know that he went down to and and what the Bible tells us that there would be a lot of people just laying here at this gate or laying here at this pool and and they're just waiting for a particular something to happen and as they were sitting there that pool they wait for the troubling of the water and then they wait for the Aged of God the Bible say the angel come down at a certain season hallelujah you got to be able to catch God in his seasons amen we were talking about that on last week it seemed like this was a season for people that work that needed transportation God was blessing them in this season right and when you see God blessing other people that's when you got to jump in and try to get what you know God got for you if you having some car trouble you ought to be expecting God to do something for you amen because this is the season and think of it is when you when they recognize that the angel was coming in that season they never knew when the season could happen but when the angel came in that season they had to jump in and the first person to jump in was the first person and the only person to be made whole right you can be coming to the pool you can be getting ready a man that house to get there you have to already be there and be prepared ready to jump in if you wanted to get your healing I don't care what your condition was if you got into that pool when the aliens have moved your condition was going things hallelujah that's where the people's faith was that if I get in now things are gonna change but you know Jesus when he went down here there was a man that had been sitting at this pool for about 38 years now you know you look at this man and and Jesus you know walks up to him and and he's laying there on his cotton and Jesus acts and requests a say will that be made whole now this man really didn't answer to his questions he came back with a bunch of excuses as to why he couldn't be made whole God don't want to hear your excuses ain't many ask you a question you want to answer nothing but the reason I can't get holes because you know when I'm coming down somebody get in in front of me and it's been happening this way for 38 years where you gonna do some difference you know I told you before that when you give God excuses excuses only satisfy one person amen excuses only satisfy the person that's making them nobody else getting nothing out of that excuse right God Himself don't get no glory from your excuse so we got to get ready I excuses and we got to get busy for God I'm an action you know about what everybody else is doing I've asked you will you'd be made whole and you know when he said I'm sure I have no man when the waters trouble to put me into the pool but while I am coming another stepping down before me so I he's trying to say I need some help but I can't do some things on my own what he was was very comfortable in his condition now I'm gonna tell you when you read this scripture that the the leaders of that game was also comfortable him and comfortable with him in that condition Rick when the man got healed the very first thing they said is that why you doing this on the Sabbath day why you do I mean rather than say praise God for your healing they say why you allowed us to happen on the Sabbath day like he can pick today when God gonna heal him he can't pick the day by 20 the same take up your bed rise take up your bed and walk he did exactly that he was made whole from that very hour now what Jesus was trying to said now I didn't do that in my own I didn't do that on my own what happens that God showed me that the man was gonna be down there and all I did and see irregardless of the conversation that I'm having with the man that did not detour Jesus I want y'all to stay with me write that then detour Jesus the count even though this plan didn't even answer the right way even though I mean his response was not the right response God had it in his mind that that man was going to be made whole on that day Oh hallelujah amen you might have come to church with the wrong attitude but if God got his mind that this gonna be the day that you are delivered in this community if God having this mind that this is going to be the data to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and this is gonna be the thing even if you didn't want to be here [Music] you can't stop God no matter what he said jesus knew that God showed him that he would be there and they went at me start talking to him and before you knew it this man was up and he was made whole and in sad part is he didn't even know who made him hope when they begin to ask questions you know like who told you to take up your band walk like they didn't know who else is telling to do things on the Sabbath thing who else keep coming who else in y'all camp keep coming up with these type of things y'all know as Jesus but when they heard it was Jesus they begin to come against him but the key thing I want you to get there is that Jesus made it very clear that he wasn't the one doing it it was it was God it was God that was showing him as a son God was showing him what to do and what want you to understand that amen when God begins to move in his power with you it's not you doing it the Lord did that thing and you're gonna have to stop and give glory to God amen the Lord did that thing all he did was just use your elements but it was God that did that you pray for somebody in there heal God did that you can't take no glory the Lord did that thing recently we were here and we had a you know we had the the the the prayer prayer line that back in October and before the prayer line before that service happened we had gone there to Indiana and God at work to miracles right there in Indiana right before our very eyes and we we had had no idea that it had been worked right you know both sister Tanya sister burrs a man they were they were they were both being prayed for sister birds had some you know some pain in her legs and she was doing all kind of things throughout the weekend to try to just get herself situated and and that night after the service you know we we called up from a prayer line and the pastor called a prayer line he prayed and and the next morning sister burrows we can really get my pleasure saved my legs they hurt the more I had the best sleep that I could have last night for all the times I had that best sleep last night see that was the Lord that did that thing right the Lord did that thing right I mean and then sometime you got in there and just you know want to pray before she went to the doctor amen about the cancer that was developing there on the scout and and she said she said I just want prayer before I go to the doctor and she come home from the trip couple days after trip we are we home and everybody getting on situated and she goes into the mirror not even knowing when it happened but went to the mirror and start parting their hair and she kept parting and she kept parting and she kept parting she could not find where the growth was she thought maybe eyes was playing tricks on it you know how to devil do-right the devil say maybe you're going blind right this day then attack you so bad now you're going blind you can't even see it no more so she call her husband and say do you see it cuz I can't see it and I don't know what them happened but this thing is gone and I don't even know when it dropped off I [Music] have no idea when this thing left me but what I do know is cold and I'm here to give God some glory to tell everybody the Lord did that so we felt led after you know these testimony need to pray for the sick we want to pray for the sick and you know and I was telling church there now and I try to find somebody so you know when we talk about pray for the sick we talk about some serious cases we talk about cancer we talk about you know some really hard things you know you I mean you might have a toothache a headache and you know you can deal with that you know sometimes but but we talk about something that's that's life-threatening right and and so there was different ones that came here to the church to be praying for that night praise the Lord and and I remember you know sister charreah brought her brother and now he was going blind he came back to church a few weeks ago y'all saw him come to church and soon as that church was over he walked out to greet me to shake my hand and say pastor he said just once didn't want you to know that I'm receiving site back in one of my eyes I said God did one out he gonna do the other eye too right the Lord did that thing I was saying invite people to come and you know and I was meeting me and brother quince and it went down to one of my relatives house and we was putting up some shutters you know for him because he was he was a little sick and he wasn't able to do this so we went and we went and put up the shutters for him and right before the hurricane and and I and as I'm sitting there just talking I'm watching him walking and you know and he's kind of you know just struggling a little a little bit and and and it just you know I don't know why we why I'm I'm put it on me why am i so lines of opportunity right here the man walking right by me struggling the walk and we get rid of have a prayer line service and I ain't said nothing to invite them I just oh I pray that you know I pray you get better no it's a prayer line got just did some shadow testimony so you know it just hit me and then I'm gonna tell I can't even take credit because the Lord did that to God anoints you to testify at the right time sometimes we don't think about it right right here you know it just kind of hit me say Oh show-off showing the picture you know sister Tonya being here being here showing the before and after picture so I showed the picture I told my testimony I say you know what and we're gonna have a prayer line in our churches I'd love to invite you to come he said you know we're gonna be there we're gonna be there they came and after he left that man had not driven his car for months might even be over a year he had not driven but after that service he got in the car and drove his wife home he also had a situation where he had to have his stomach drain like every week because of some fluid building up in the stomach after that service it was he was going by five of six weeks before you have to have training again he praise the Lord let's get down to Hannah praise another thing that he was not able to eat he had no appetite but now his wife came by enough groceries to keeping the house for the same man I'm here to tell you this morning the Lord did that thing the Lord did that thing and if God did that he got more he wanted to hallelujah somebody glory to God amen you know and so this freaked out I run into another man that you know he tells me he says he said pastor I need to see you I say yes he said you know remember that that service that y'all had he's from Washington he just happened to be passing through that night it just happened he visit his family member that night what I'm telling you how the Lord works what what names supposed to be here just coming to visit a family little bit but I invited the family member to come to church and the family member brought with the concert alone the cousin had to drive him here got him here and you know there was great fun and the cousin told me this we can say now I had a cyst right here on my own you know he said my arm here and say I know I had that sis say cuz sometimes they get real hard then sometimes I get a little softer and say it wasn't cancerous or anything but I knew I had that he said I was sitting sitting in the service and I got prayed for and you know and uh and and and and before I knew it I realized the cyst was gone in the service in that service that prayer service that well answer the cyst dropped off the minute and since was its internal right so somehow some way the since disappeared and he came that he can't miss it that's I just want to tell us and then the Lord did that say won't he do it oh my god see Church we got we got to understand that God is moving God I mean the Bible tells that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever with testimonies like these we ought to go to the streets we honest we ought to share hope with people right we can't wait for them to come to us let's go to them hallelujah people looking for a God with skin on them so you got God God God did this and you know I want to just kind of drop into something here a man I'm I'm a reacts 3:16 here for in a second but another another little quote that I want to just give you a faith is the substance a man faith is the substance the Prophet says this the very God back there in the beginning that rolled the world the moon the Stars and made them from things which do not appear or made them out of things that do up here right he says out of things and where did he get the material to make it he spoke it into existence by his word he said let there be see if I could just break it down the chair you sitting on is because of the spoken word of God the car you driving is because of the spoken word of God this earth was was void it was empty it was nothing my god but but when God spoke it became something so everything the two halves because was a spoken word of God listen he says he says it says he's spoken into existence by us where they said let there be and it was so deity and this is what I want you to get a portion of that deity dwells in the heart of every born-again Christian amen so there's a portion of God dwelling on the inside of you and when when the situation is right and ready God will anoint you to speak listen say hallelujah then what did he say ask what you will and it'll be given to you there you are did you felling their Pentecost is still falling all right hallelujah I'll tell you we need we need to recognize these things I mean and when we see God do it give him all the glory God did that thing it wasn't us it was God that did it now let me just kind of drop into acts 3:16 really quick I want to read that aid man and this in the Bible says and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom ye see and know yea the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all now I want you I want you to catch that and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom you see and know yea the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all now you know when we when we look at this this was the story of a man a man that was sitting at the gate called beautiful right and as he was sitting at the gate called beautiful he was begging arms and just asking different people to just give him a little money here and give him a little money there to kind of take care of himself and maybe his family you know and I and this one day the disciples happened to be going through there and and the prophets say no doubt many times Jesus went right by this man and the reason Jesus did that he left the man there knowing that the disciples would deal with him in a future time hallelujah right so so here here this man is sitting there and and the disciples come by a Peter and John are on their way to the temple to pray and and went and when it when it when they get that acidity the man said look all of us to the man looked on him as if they were about to get something as if he was about to get something from them where Peter John say silver and gold have I none but such as I have I give unto thee what they had was that the healing virtue that was flowing from the Son of God was not flowing through them and they gave that to that man they gave the man his healing that he can do it until God showed them to do it I don't know how many times they might have went to church and went right by him but one day things change and they say oh my god one of these days you know it's gonna be a different service Church I'm letting you know that right now one date we come a man out of tradition but one day God gonna drop down and do something traditions don't change Oh hallelujah I believe that I believe that a man is maybe somebody not looking for the Holy Ghost of the Holy Ghost just baptized you right there on the spot that's that's what I'm talking about you you wonder what happened to them God God did that dang but here you know this man was sitting there and you know and they say look on us and he looked and said maybe I'm gonna get a little arm so now I'm sitting go we don't have but what we have we want to give to you so they rise up and walk in the name of Jesus the Bible say they they they picked him up and as they picked him up he begin to receive strength in his in his legs and and he began to leap and he begin the jump begin to worship and praise God they couldn't sit him down in church that day Oh hallelujah I wish we have a servant like that we can't sit folk down people just get wild in the presence of God running here and there and I man I just want to see God do some things but after you finish running in here you'll run out there and tell somebody that God did that same tells us that it was faith through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom you see and know yea the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of y'all and and what brother Branham says say it was the faith of Jesus Christ that man's faith did not make him whole but what happened was that the faith of the Lord Jesus dropped in that man at that time and made him believe the promise of God see i'ma tell you when he was made hold that one even his own faith they made him hold God did that thing God did that right it was it was the faith of the Lord that dropped in the man and they don't believe the Word of God we need God's faith to drop down on us and make us leave halleluyah halleluyah see something don't change one day glory to God let's look at let's let's look at a couple things I want to read a quote out of pergamene church age on that hallelujah here's where the Prophet explains it says in acts 3:16 when Peter was axed how the mighty miracle had taken place upon the crippled one at the gate too beautiful he explained it on this wise and his Jesus name through faith in his Jesus name hath made this man former crippled strong ye the faith which is by or from him Jesus hath given him the man this perfect soundness in the presence of you all see there it is Jesus name and Jesus faith brought about the miracle Peter did not claim it was his own human faith any more than he claimed that it was that it was his own name he said that Jesus's name used in the faith which is from Jesus perform that great work this faith is what the Lord was speaking about in Revelation 213 it was his faith it was not faith in him a man but it was his own faith that had given that he had given to the believers I'm in paragraph 179 - - just type that in 179 - - I've says Romans 12:3 according as God hath dealt to every man according to verse 1 the man our brethren the measure of faith Ephesians 2:8 by grace ye are saved through faith and that faith not of yourselves is the gift of God it is and it also says in change to one my brother and notice he took - notice he too is talking to brethren have not the faith earth not in our Lord Jesus Christ with respect to person see this is what we're looking for we need the faith of Jesus not just faith in Jesus but we want the faith of Jesus to drop down inside the church because we're getting some things done with the faith of Jesus the faith of Jesus cannot doubt his word no matter what it goes through the faith of Jesus will continue to believe it's the same faith that spoke let there be there's there's the part of deity that is dwelling in every believer with the Holy Ghost it's the faith of Jesus Christ it's the virtue of Jesus Christ it's the temperance of Jesus Christ it's the knowledge of Jesus Christ where is the love of Jesus Christ it's the public honest oh Jesus Christ it is all Jesus see your your faith and your temperature your loving your run-outs enter somebody do this show face this girl you ain't got no more faith in them we're not talking about your face we're talking about his faith we need some time pray lord I need your face not just more faith your thing I need your love I need your peace I need your your bullet counters I need I need you God hallelujah church see my brother notice he too is talking to brother and have not the faith of not in our Lord Jesus Christ with respective persons it says in this program an age where men were humanized in salvation having turned from the truth that salvation of the Lord having cast aside the doctrine of election open open wide the church door and the fellowship to any and all who subscribed to their tenants never mind the word in this age of rapid degradation there were still a few who have the measure of that faith of our Lord Jesus Christ not only used that faith in acts of power but we've stood those who dare to say that they were saved simply on the grounds of joining the church they knew that no man could truly believe unto eternal life and a righteousness of God apart from the measure of the faith of the Lord Jesus himself as today's church is filled with mental believers who endorsed the virgin birth the shed blood going to church and taking communion and are not reborn at all so you got a lot of with mental faith a lot of them say even so in that third a each was the same problem human faith wasn't enough then and it is not enough now so your faith thing is I mean don't don't get me wrong your faith is useful you got to mix even what I'm preaching you got to mix it with your faith but if you mix it with your faith next thing you know you take on God Smith hallelujah it takes the very faith of the Son of God to drop into a man's heart so that he can receive the Lord of glory into the temple not meet with hands God we want your faith not not just ours we want we want yours blessed be the name of the Lord the God the Lord did that thing a man let me just I want to slip a couple more quotes in here did I want to slip over into yeah let me go to statute of a perfect man then I'm gonna slip over here to Exodus we'll pick this up and bring it back around the Lord did that thing Oh glory to God Amen here in the statute for a man who says Jesus said is it not written you condemned me saying I am the son of God I'm a stomach guy isn't it written you are gosh don't your own law say that like Moses like Eliezer like those prophets who live so close to God till God just transferring himself right into them oh you had a transfer you didn't realize that that's what the Holy Ghost what God was transferring himself right into you glory to God listen God just transfer himself right into if you say you've got the Spirit of God it ought to be doing the same thing that they was doing in the book of Acts that's what we ought to see in the church glory to God amen amen I thank God for that the few mean the miracles that just happened but I think God got some Oh miracles that he want to happen and it's one thing to share a testimony what happened with the gods prophet but what's happening with God's people you know there's been a lot of criticism criticism around the message saying God ain't doing nothing I'm owed a lion not here God did some things here God has done some things and he's still doing it hey man we're gonna give God glory around here we know what the Lord has done we're not seeing God raises the dance right here in our mix we don't seen it praise the look don't tell me what God of God did that thing we were sitting at we were sitting in a church one night and and a man got offended by the Word of God and as he got offended by the word you know and see we have just been you know working with these things in Bible study so see the oh lord help me God sir Church God God has grounded us God has seasoned us so we understand how this should be working now right now mix it with faith we got we got to understand it now mix it with faith let's see God do what God want to do oh my I'm calling forth every gift that God has placed in the body if God has given you to get the tongues I'm calling it forth if God has given you the gift of interpretation I'm calling it for if God is giving you the gift of wisdom I'm calling it for God is giving you the gift of knowledge I am calling for I am tired of suppressing it I'm calling it boss if it was in the book of Acts it should be end up in the church today God did stop these things hallelujah Church listen listen let me tell you you know as I you know we were there in the church and the man the man he he resented the word and we had just heard the testimony about oh my brother brother way and brother Wade was in church brother Branham preaching and that's where I got to watch your heart when you come to church right but you know as he was preaching you said no he's brother Graham say brother you got it you got it you got a complex you got a complex and a mess ain't got no complex now by saying ain't got no complex just show that you did have my complex and because he said that at the wrong time the man dropped dead in the service everybody got a little you know a low of said and his wife was a nurse thing you know I don't know what to do and I told everybody calm down now just let me let me go be and pray pray for the man and got raisin back up and and and and so we're at service in this little this little fella somebody preachy you know he had a hairstyle that was not up God can I say it like that yeah there's some hairstyles that men can wear that a not of God oh I'm gonna say it I'm Norma get in trouble for this one but I might as well say their hairstyles that sisters can't wear that is not of God not not of God God did not do that thing I need the Holy Ghost who teaches these things but he got offended in church because the pastor said that the minister said something about about you know something that he did his hair something he said something he say oh he said that you know definitive state and we watched that boy sit right there in church and his eyes begin to roll back in his head and and and and he was dying and so some of the Saints saw it and they call me and got my attention you know we didn't we didn't interrupt the service brother stop preaching we got somebody to know we got people in the congregation that can handle that oh these starts our Father didn't that believe you laid your hands on the sick and they shall recover alright so they you know say Satan's a project project turn around I'm looking I went back there and I and I and I saw that shot a little boy and I mean he just see just fading he phaeton and and and I put my hand on him he's going cold in the church he's going cold that's it that's a sign death is setting in and I'm like I'm my mind and it's so we you know we just kind of set there and and we prayed and and then I begin the whisper in his ear and I called his name right and I just kept calling them say I call you back I call you back I call you back in the name of Jesus I called you back and I just kept calling his name you know and before you know it he started warming up and start you know he was getting a little bit better he's like okay all right I say I said well thank God we're so glad that you know the Lord restored him he said when I take him to the hospital and make sure everything all right with him they got him up to hospital doctors could not find anything that's how we knew it was a spirit that was a man that was on him when he disagreed with what the preacher was saying don't come in here don't come in and play with God you don't know who you're dealing with amen and that's not just me that's every belief in here you watch what you say about God's children the Bible say it is better that our millstone be tired of your neck and you drowned in the ocean then they say something evil about one of God's children and let me tell you some electrolytes what this message t let don't do that so watch yourself one day you walk into something like like an announcer sapphire something just going to church and live by their tires i'ma leave that alone y'all they lie about their tires God told to pay 10% oh yeah we sold the prop that was increased Lord they so property made money off it and then a lot about how much they made off of it yeah this is what we give him and Peter say what temp you to laughter the Holy Ghost the wife in the husband had done concocted this I can just imagine she probably say oh I'm a body he probably up day you're gonna be able to get I ain't been able to get that for you all this time but you're gonna get it now you know I'm gonna take care that and after you get that I'm gonna get this and I'm a boy week it's gonna be alright thank God thank God for the blessing of this land that we just sold blow rain we gonna celebrate went to church and wrote a time check and Peter say what temper the laughter the Holy Ghost why would you do something like that they say drop dead gent like that you know what didn't even pray for him brothers come get him take him dig the hole put them in there it was just like that problem is they didn't have cellphones they didn't have whatsapp they didn't have you know I mean you just name it they had no applications they didn't have seeing in they didn't have nothing no wife had no idea that her husband had come to church because women and man was separate at that time she had come to church not only come to church was already buried she never even went to the funeral of her own husband that happened in church y'all and I'm saying the Lord did that thing wife came to church when it's time for her to come and she come in oh yeah here go our portion of the times right here yeah why y'all get home go home and do something like that both your husband you and your husband came up with this plan and say you know sister the same brothers that just buried your husband are here to bury you she couldn't even thank my husband very know that didn't even get out that cuz they lied to the Holy Ghost be careful you don't know who you're dealing with you're dealing with God God's people it's the Lord that's doing that thing let me finish this quote I got to get over here to Exodus all right where am I says uh Jesus is not written is it not written it's not it written you condemned me saying that I'm the son of God isn't it written that you are God's don't your own laws say that like Moses like in largely like those prophets who lives so close to God so God just transfer himself right into them and they spoke not themselves but God take no thought what you should say because it's not you that speaks it's the father that dwelleth in you he's he do it to speak in his words it's not his own because his life is dead if you die you take the blood out of a man you embalm him trouble of it is a lot of them never get involved you take the blood out of the man he's gone then the only thing you can do is put it do is put another blood back in him he's going to live again you took his blood out now you've put the blood of G you took a spool out but and now you put the blood of Jesus Christ MC and that brings the faith of Jesus Christ the virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ the temperance of Jesus Christ the patience of jesus christ the godliness of jesus christ the brotherly kindness of jesus christ and the love of God which is Jesus Christ he's the head and controls you and your feet is the foundation faith a man controlled by the head see take there you are there is the perfect man of God when he possesses these virtues let me go on he says then God represent his church as a bride a woman God represents his church as a bride and the way he brings each individual to being his son to go in that bride he also brought them right through the ages a man till he brings this one complete church into this my feet moves why because my head said so now it can't move like my hand because it's my feet Luther can't do the things that we did neither can the Methodists because they were something else see the feet moves because the headset so and the head never says now feet you become hand here you become I see but each age God has placed these things into the church and pattern it by showing that each individual has these possesses these qualities and this being when it is completed is the Church of God going to rapture and this being and complete it is a servant of God in the Church of God that's going in the rapture glory see what I mean there you are there's the full thing our purpose for coming here is because we try to become more and more like Jesus we don't want to just be church members we want to be Christians Christians act like Christ let's flip over here to Exodus the Lord did that thing the Lord did it he's working in us he's called us from some some really rough places in life but God is the one that's raised us but raise us up and made us who we are today the Lord that did that thing you could do it in your own strength a man you didn't have the power to change yourself but God did it amen he's still working on me glory to God I'm picking up just here and actually start with X's 5 verse 1 & 2 and let me just we're gonna just read a couple scriptures here because this is a time where were the children of Israel about to leave Egypt that's why it's called exodus they're given had taken Exodus but when Moses is called on the backside of the desert and and and he goes back a man in to eat if he run from Egypt before but now he's going back into Egypt with a message from God and he's gonna tell Pharaoh let my people go and and as Moses is on his way back he meets his brother Aaron you know they're in the they're in the mountain and when Aaron meets them and he began to tell Aaron his testimony how he met God on the backside of desert air Aaron was just so excited they together went and told the elders of Israel and and when the elders of Israel heard how God had visited Moses they knew God had sent them a deliverer and they began to worship and to praise God because they said thank God he sent us a prophet I don't know why they stopped believing in the Prophet but there was a time where they did have complete faith that God had sent a prophet hallelujah now look at this in X's 5 just first one and two and after it Moses and Aaron went in and topher Oh thus saith the Lord God of Israel let my people go that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness and Pharaoh said who is the Lord that I should obey his voice to let let let Israel go I know not the Lord neither will I let Israel go you know as I look at that and I'm skipping over here to chapter 7 we're going to pick that up in a second but here you know Pharaoh is hearing this message coming from Moses and from Aaron and and his question is who is the Lord now now when he's asking that question to Moses God heard it and God was was very well equipped to be able to answer Pharaoh's question you want to know who I am I'm gonna show you who I am now that I'm gonna show you but I'm gonna show everybody in your kingdom Who I am I am that I am that's who sent Moses I'm gonna show Pharoah who I am you want to know who the Lord is you're gonna see who the Lord is and every time a plague dropped Pharaoh began to recognize who the Lord was it's he answered his question got answered but I'm gonna tell you it wasn't answered by Moses the Lord did that thing you want to ask him Moses the question you ask you is asking God the question God was there in Moses Oh hallelujah how can I say that well Exodus 7 this is what we read at the beginning look at this exercise I said the Lord said unto Moses see I have made thee a god to Pharaoh and Aaron thy brother shall be that prophet now I'm making you God Moses you you are God in this situation sometimes we don't know who we are you know the Prophet had a little situation at home he said this people coming from all over the place and and the kids got in a little they were just fighting and just running around the house and just doing a bunch of stuff saying his wife was just frantic and you know just need to do so much in the house and but people come in just in and out they're like the out just don't know what to do so they went into the kitchen they saw his wife washing the dishes and and the kids running around and doing all day and they just just driving up crazy so he went into the kitchen and he saw getting dishes and so he grabbed the apron and he put on the apron I'm talking to some brothers in here I'm talking right now and he grabbed the apron he put on the apron and when he put on the apron he started washing the dishes with his wife and when they start washing the dishes with her he noticed that the whole atmosphere in the house began to change it said his wife rather than being so frantic she start calming down he began to talk about a dress that he wanted to buy for and all this is like she's like no we can't give it another on let me let me let me let me you know after we finish this let's go downtown we're gonna get that dress like come on bill we no no no this just let me do this let me do this for you I got y'all never say before you know it you know the kids settle down he never even said a word till no yelling screaming just the kids settle down and he said I went went went when he did that y'all get y'all good I can get I got time to read a quote but you can it's in there he said he said I became God to the situation I took control my actions the way I handled myself I became God to that situation not only he said you know we stopped there him becoming God in this household now take it further you can become God on your child do you become God in school you can become God wherever God need you to be God the Lord said unto Moses see I have Maivia God not not not for you to be worshipped that's not what we're talking about that's not I mean this is a person that can take control over the situation I have Maivia got you ain't got to be running around and frantic like everybody else tell everybody to calm down relax we got this we got this he said he says and I have made thee a god to Pharaoh and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet thou shalt speak all that I command thee and this is a key part I shall speak all that I command thee and Aaron thy brother shall speak in the Pharaoh that he send the children Israel out of his land now when Moses went down there a man into Egypt everything that he did every plague that was what was was given in Egypt it wasn't because Moses came up with the idea oh I hope y'all get this it wasn't because Moses sat around and think of this you know what tomorrow I think I'm gonna turn that river into blood and you know he not gonna listen anyway this not Moses thinking he not gonna listen anywhere and so after I finished blood you know then I think I'm gonna call for some frogs and he gonna he's not gonna believe that so I think imma do this that was not Moses thoughts I want you to understand that those were God's thoughts and what he had to tell mostly Moses now I'm gonna sing you but I'm gonna get in you and I want you to come everything I tell you to tell a pharaoh I want you to do it I'm commanding you I want to say something that business I did that came out of nowhere it won yours God did that thing God God did that thing and and there's a lot of things that are happening amen and your life you don't have no idea that God is behind it sometimes God is positionally placing you into certain situations because he's trying to reach somebody he need you to be there to reach him so before a plague dropped God had to give Moses the thought so before a frog could come God had to tell Moses to call for the frogs right I mean you know before the lights could come God had to tell Moses to come for the lights a man before the cattle could be destroyed God had to tell Moses amen the car for the cattle be destroyed God had to tell Moses to do it all he could not do anything until God showed him the same way it was with Jesus couldn't do anything to God show them you can't do nothing to God show you and when God shows you gonna give him glory God did that thing Moses would make God the Pharaoh and Aaron was made a prophet he was commanded to speak all that God had commanded him now also Ephesians I mean exit 6-3 said that Moses had not known God a man as Jehovah had not known a man's Jehovah so when Moses called for frogs and lice and flies and locusts that was the spoken word coming out of Moses mouth hallelujah Moses knew him as Jehovah Moses not only called for but but even sometime the Egyptians and then that they're magicians would come out and they were trying to call for things to but but Moses had the power not only just to cover for it he had the power to loose it and he also had the power to find it so he knew when he's in feresten I'll take it away from him only Moses could take it away guess what you got that same power to bind and to loose Oh hallelujah Moses knew messenger over Moses demonstrated the power to bind and loose now this is the one that I want y'all against just just just stay with me on this Oh hallelujah hallelujah there was a man in Moton and Exodus 9 we don't start reading from verse 1 there exodus 9 Moses was calling for these different things to come and plague Egypt there was 10 plagues that struck Egypt but it was God and Moses doing all that God was doing this thing it wasn't Moses doing it I want to tell you another thing even when it comes to the prophet and we just look at different testimonies and different things that happen his ministry it was not brother Branham doing it it was God doing that thing I was I was just thinking back to my cell phone on the little boy that God gave him a vision of a little boy being healed got hit by a car was going to be healed and and years went by before that before that became a manifestation he happened to be in Miami Florida preaching and somebody said is this the boy brother Branson no that ain't the boy the scenery ain't right that ain't the boy that's not the boy we can pray for him but that's not the boy that I saw in my vision and there you happen to be in Finland and and and they're in the service and and at the end of the service here this boy got hit by a car and brother branham was walking away and everybody told him exactly what happened and he went up there to the situation to just overlook it's it's just awful the word of Prayer and he turn and start walking when he held he felt a hand touched him on the shoulder turn around and go back now that just lets you know as a man he had nothing to do with this he forgot about it himself so here the angel or I have to stop him and say turn around look at that situation again and when they look to start looking around at the seniors say look in your Bibles didn't we write this down thank God tell us the right to stop he say oh this is the scene this is this is the boy that's supposed to be raised from the day and when it when he caught that he was actually inside a vision oh my god one day you're gonna catch that you are actually inside the vision you're gonna realize it's not your doing it is God doing it God showed it God did it God get the glory for everything brother branham realization I say okay let's pray me pray for the boy and God raised that boy up but the other part that God didn't show him in the vision that there was another boy that was gonna be hit at the same time and when that boy got hit the mama the mama and daddy said that boy was prayed for and raised up pray for our boy then he'd get up brother BAM said God showed me that earlier and that's why he was prayed for but God never showed me nothing about you he said well no we pretty much we can't accept that we want you to pray fire boy and raise him up like he did that boy I can't do that God had already got God got proved that he was going to do it through a vision they say uh I'll pray and we'll see what the Lord saying and as he was praying the angel Lord came to him and told him about some candy that he needed to eat and he saw a flower a man and one flower they were drooping and then one flower stood up he said they knew that was the boy I was here but the other thought I was still grouping say it kind of came him up and didn't went back down and he said he said he said what the angel said now the other boys that other flower that's going back down saying now you have to eat this candy if you want that boy to be healed oh my say some things you might have to go through on behalf of somebody else Oh Church things you might have to go through on behalf of somebody else so you say now you have to eat the can fruit he had two pieces of candy one piece of canvas a man that was best can he ever had in his life then he ate it real quick he said not eat that other piece of candy and when he ate the other piece of candy say it was some of the worst tasting candy he said soon as he put in his mouth he wanted to spit it out and he just said no that other boy gonna live until you finish the candy he finished the candy and after he ate it he saw the flower come back up he called her mom at the hospital say dust at the Lord you're gonna leave but didn't tell her mama he had to do something bitter oh come on y'all you might have to do something that's very bitter to you but it'll bring life to somebody else Jesus went to a bit across but look at the life that we all received Exodus 9 let's bring it home this is the plague of the cattle and God was always separating you know he started separating certain things that were hit the Egyptians but with not hit those that were living in Goshen listen then the Lord said unto Moses go in unto Pharaoh tell him thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews let my people go that they may serve benign Pharaoh and got the same question who is the Lord he don't have some experience now with God so he know that God is real right now look at look at this it says for if thou refuse to let them go and we'll hold them still the hold the hand the Lord is upon thy cattle which is in the field upon the horses upon the asses upon the camels upon the oxen and upon the sheep there shall be a very Grievous moraine and the Lord shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the count of Egypt and there shall nothing die of all that is the that is the children of Israel children of Israel and the Lord appointed a set time saying tomorrow the Lord shall do this thing in the land and the Lord did that thing y'all thought I just came up with that did y'all and the Lord did that thing hallelujah won't he do it [Laughter] right there your Bible and the Lord did that thing on the morrow and all the cattle of Egypt died but of the cattle the children of Israel died not one and Pharaoh sent and behold there was not one of the cattle the Israelites dead and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened and he did not let the people go but every time is hard his heart got hardened it was God actually allowing that to happen because God has some old things that he wanted to do so sometimes you'd be going through some stuff and you don't know why you're going through that it's the Lord that did that thing it's the Lord that allowed that thing you just go through it joint and watch him just just unfold every attribute that was him that was in him before the foundation where he gonna express that to you but let God do what God does hallelujah hallelujah let me just finish off with reading a little quote here a man a man y'all got time for two quotes and I finish right here I'm like this is gonna be the pergamene church age paragraph 172 - to 172 - - says this note is the harmony of the Father and the Son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father John 5:19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never down stood there for nothing can harm her not even death but if the seat be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it wasn't Mary the bride has the mind of Christ but she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has us at the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is more planted and watered it comes to full harvest serving its purpose and then those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the Lord they keep still the reason they do this because the Lord is doing that thing right they know it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his works while in his earthly minister so now he works in and through the bride that's what he did with the disciples when he went there to the gate the the gate called beautiful he's left that situation for those disciples God has allowed some situations in this world for us common present-day disciples we got to take care of but it's not us doing it it's God in us doing it and we gave him the glory God did that thing she knows that for what for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time church we've been reading his quotes for years but we got to take him to the streets can I read one more for you the deity of Jesus Christ look at this I just you know I just I just I'm encouraged by the Word of God says this is the deity of him who is he some of them thinks him a little a little baby back there he's the one that stood on the invisible oh my platform reached out his hands and spoke said let there be light and there was light that was Jesus Christ but he was in the world and the world was made by him in the world recognized him not he was and he is the deity of God look what he did back there talk about the miraculous back there you talk about shouting when he performed there were miraculous things to make things which are now out of things which was not he spoke and it was so and that same power that same Christ hallelujah let the fundamentalist let them people who deny the power of God say it's wrong but that same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost that's right men and women it's time that we found out who you are the devil's try my hide you back tell you that you're some little trot down something you're not your sons and daughters of God the deity is not in heaven it's in you the deity is not in heaven it's in you I love this church let me keep going it says hallelujah I know you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize that Almighty God lives in you in mortal life my life I give Zoe the life of God is in the human being he stood back there he's the creator of all things he made life frogs and all that these Ducks see Moses didn't do that that was God that did that he made life frogs and all these ducks chickens animals create everything and nothing was made but was made by him who Christ the deity he brought down plagues and everything in the days of Egypt who Christ he stopped the mouths of lions he quits the violence of fire they escape the edge of the sword they raised the dead from the great who Christ oh my what what would it be who is it Christ of ET and brother sister that deed is in you a little while in the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age Christ in the manger no Christ in you hallelujah we're not worshiping Christ in the manger but Christ in you the Holy Ghost the hope of life the Creator God Himself dwelling in the human being it does not yet appear what we shall be but we'll see him as he is for we'll be made like him no room for him I want to skip down to paragraph 135 amen in the same message as we bring us as close Christ is dwelling inside his church its Christ it's the same God that we see in the Bible now that same God has manifested himself and people today we need to see that it's God doing these things I mean you know like I just shared with you too we thank God for how God heals sister birds and heal sister Tonya but right there in our service somebody walked in one name planning on being here and assist was gone that God can do that for them what can he do for the rest of us that's coming here sick every week come on we are that we ought to say no no no no no no no no and and I can take I mean God you are his bride he wants to do more for you than you even ever imagine look at this you cannot be saved only by accepting Christ by the Holy Spirit if he's in you he's the power of God live by it he's God in you the Bible said we think God is upon me o God Jesus said the Pharisees answered said you make yourself God said isn't it written in your law ye are gods that's what jesus answered and he goes on saying he made Moses they got to Pharaoh once and he made you a god to the people I want I want that to sink in he made Moses but God to Pharaoh once and he made you a god to the people see the only god they're gonna see is the god that's inside of you the only hands God got are your hands the only feet God has are your feet the only mouth that God has is your mouth church it's time to yield a god and allow him to get all the glory and all the honor out of these 16 elements he made Moses God to Pharaoh once and he made you a god to the people that's right and you this morning are written epistles of God your lives are of God and even carries that Holy Ghost look dear friends don't let it pass don't let this go by that's just a little mythical something will you do that I pray you receive it if he could tell Moses I'm making you a god to Pharaoh made him a god to that man made him that way as sons of God we've been made in His image and their situations all around us on a daily basis that God needs some God to take could take control or you know when he told Moses to take those children of Israel out there to the on the journey and take them back to take him to the promised land and they come up to the Red Sea Moses got the crime lord what shall I do and say brother branham's say when moses got the crown said God was going over to sit down and as he was on his way to sit down he heard Moses crying what shall I do and it says Moses Moses what's your crying father and told you everything just say whatever whatever coming your way you just speak to it don't don't don't cry to me don't do it at he say you just be you just handle it Moses and let me tell you God trying to tell some of y'all handle me even as even as SS test as parents when our kids could have a certain age we looked for them to be able to handle some things spiritually we got to grow up because God is looking for us to handle some things we got to be about the Father's business when moses got the crying and god sitting on our mother stopped crying you know you speak and moses spoke something that he didn't even he couldn't even think he just say the egyptians that you have seen the day you'll see him no more forever didn't know how that was gonna happen but he spoke it and then he let God take care of the rest time and when he spoke it God said and I take your rod and just stretch it out over the water I stretched it out a water party children Israel start crossing on the dry ground it's man they was just rejoicing thank God but but then they start realizing man Pharaoh's arm is coming round and as they were pharaoh say well oh you know he had a question who was the Lord he wanted to know who is the Lord when we come down there now and that in that the same little parting of the Red Sea he found out who the law it was because his army didn't make it through the Red Sea they got drowned can I tell y'all something God will drown your enemies you won't see them again he can drown it amen but I tell you what before you do that before he does they're gonna challenge your face and you got to rise up and be who God's call you be give God the praise cuz it's the Lord that did that thing hallelujah glory it's the Lord that did that thing whatever it is that God has brought you through it's the Lord that innit amen we can't take any glory nope no glory at all for ourselves is God that is doing it let's pray father we thank you for your word that comes to our heart today we realize it's nobody but you God the summarizer said when we were in trouble you came to our rescue when God just seemed like everything was against us you made a way where there was no way you opened up doors that we could see here and I missed we've seen healings take place we knows nothing that you got and Lord as we go out with face the enemy the same way Moses was anointed to speak to his enemy at that time Lord will be anointed to speak to our enemy today we're not to take thought as to what we're gonna say we're not to take thought of that but we know that you would anoint us at the proper time God you give us mouth and the Bible said you'll give us wisdom and Lord as you give us these things then we have what we need in order to overcome the enemy so Lord we we want to just give you the praise we realize that it's not us it's certainly not us God that has done any distinct but you have done all things and you've done it well so Lord we pray that this won't just be something that goes in when they're not the other but Lord let us realize that there are some situations that you're calling us into just as you call Moses into and you want us to be gawked to the circumstance Lord not crying not a complaining not wandering over to be God and to speak because it's through the spoken word that things change this whole earth was changed because you spoke out of your mouth let there be stuff we have something that with fighting something that was struggling it's your word god that's going to make a difference and your word will come forth out of our mouths we yield ourselves to you my prayer is that you will feel every every person with the Holy Ghost and God every fiber of our being will be filled with your spirit that we oh god might manifest living Jesus today lead us guide us direct us you know where you would have us to go for this
