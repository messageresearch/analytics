[49:30] of the seven golden candlesticks my is
[49:34] Christ in the church a man Christ indeed
[49:37] which is the life of the church amen
[49:40] no other life and without him it's just
[49:44] a religious Society if he ain't in here
[49:48] this morning if he ain't with us this
[49:50] morning it's just a meaningless
[49:52] gathering of people Amen I trust that
[49:56] he's here this morning verse 2 I know
[49:58] thy works and thy labour and thy
[50:02] patience and how thou candidates cannot
[50:05] bear them which are evil and thou
[50:09] tried them which say there are apostle's
[50:11] in or not and has found them liars oh
[50:13] how beautiful the savior parades in
[50:16] command convince his people
[50:18] hey man he said I know about worse and I
[50:22] labor he knows all about us this morning
[50:24] amen and it takes it to full account of
[50:27] their attitude a man don't ever be
[50:29] discouraged God's not ungracious a man
[50:33] verse 3 and has board has patience and
[50:37] for my name's sake has labored and has
[50:39] not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat
[50:43] against thee because thou hast left thy
[50:46] first love remember therefore from
[50:49] whence thou art fallen and repent and do
[50:52] the first works or else I will come unto
[50:54] thee quickly and remove thy candlestick
[50:56] out of his place except thou repent but
[51:00] this thou hast thou hatest the deeds of
[51:04] the Nicolaitans which are which I also
[51:06] hate he that have an ear let him hear
[51:08] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[51:10] to him that overcometh wha give ear the
[51:13] treeline or give to eat of the tree of
[51:15] life which is in the midst of the
[51:17] paradise of God may the Lord had his
[51:19] blessings to the reading of the world
[51:21] you may be seated like to maybe take for
[51:24] fuc thought for a few minutes left our
[51:27] first love left our first love and like
[51:31] I said here it was he addresses this to
[51:34] the Angel of the church which Paul was
[51:37] the endings of that church we all know
[51:39] amen and he said these things says he
[51:41] that holdeth is Christ talking because
[51:44] he held the seven stars in his right
[51:46] hand and he was walking to the midst and
[51:48] like I said no other life and amen it
[51:51] sets he is and without him this morning
[51:53] this this this this gathering this
[51:55] meeting would be it'd be just
[51:57] meaningless would just be gathered
[51:59] together by him here this morning and
[52:02] I'm trusted he's here this morning I
[52:04] mean we prayed we asked God to come amen
[52:08] and be with us we asked him to come and
[52:10] dwell amongst us this morning amen we
[52:13] pray for the service before it begin and
[52:16] everything and
[52:18] I think brother Quinton said they some
[52:20] of y'all gathered here this morning I'm
[52:22] a prayer-meeting I'm sure y'all pray for
[52:23] their service and that's what we work
[52:25] because we will ensure they won't Christ
[52:27] here with us this morning a man because
[52:30] if he ain't here then wish him go home
[52:32] amen amen we might as well send go home
[52:36] because it won't mean nothing then it
[52:39] begins to say I know about labor not
[52:41] work say man and and thy patience and
[52:44] how thou kill it's not their doom which
[52:46] are evil and that has tried them which
[52:49] said there are apostles it or not and
[52:52] has found enlarged he was commending
[52:54] them amen
[52:56] so you know I thought my it is good what
[52:58] other people say about you those we are
[53:01] every one of us here this morning of we
[53:03] be honest with one another we want
[53:05] people to say nice things about us I
[53:08] want somebody to say something nice
[53:10] about me and you want somebody to say
[53:13] something nice about you and then we
[53:17] always wear that we're human beings and
[53:19] and in just that way we we want people
[53:21] to like us we don't want to be disliked
[53:24] we want to we want to fit in we don't
[53:28] want to be a like a misfit or aren't
[53:32] outcast we want to fit in somewhere and
[53:35] it's nice like I said what what people
[53:38] say about you if you got friends and and
[53:41] that's good because even the Bible says
[53:43] he they have friends but sure self
[53:45] friendly hey man boo but let me ask you
[53:49] this question
[53:50] and then like I said it is good where
[53:52] the people say about you and it's good
[53:54] that you that you got friends and that
[53:56] you can show yourself friendly but what
[53:58] about the Lord committed you one that
[54:02] does he have to say about you this
[54:03] morning what's he have to say about me
[54:05] this morning closely there's no big guys
[54:08] and there's no little use a man there's
[54:11] no big it's like this

[54:15] years ago and you might have heard of it
[54:17] by the name of Jack Coe and they told
[54:21] him said Jack you better better be kind
[54:23] of calm down and be quiet enough not not
[54:26] get too excited goes up
[54:29] years in the congregation so he gets up
[54:33] there nice as I understand the mayor's
[54:35] in the congregation this morning he said
[54:38] let me tell you something mr. mayor said
[54:41] if you don't get right with God said
[54:43] you'll go to hell just like the trash
[54:44] man will pay man so that's the way it is
[54:48] God don't have no up he's not a respect
[54:51] a person's this morning
[54:53] just because I'm Who I am just because

[55:19] I want my life ride that I wanted my
[55:22] life right
[55:23] that's what I want a man and so it's
[55:29] good like I said but what about what's
[55:31] the Lord have to say about you hey what
[55:34] is he have to say get let him get you
[55:37] under his microscope say some of us were
[55:41] the only Christians by profession oh we
[55:46] can talk and talk but can we walk the
[55:49] walk
[55:49] I'm talking about myself this morning a
[55:52] minute I don't want to just be a
[55:54] Christian by profession that I'm a
[55:57] Christian but I want to be a Christian
[55:59] because God has come in my life and then
[56:02] birth leave our new pope not only inside
[56:06] the inside not by what I do about how I
[56:11] act but is because I come to church amen
[56:15] but I want to be a Christian because I'm
[56:17] bored again let me ask you a question
[56:22] there's a little statement that I sing
[56:24] one time it said if you were arrested
[56:27] for being a Christian would there be
[56:30] enough evidence to commit you
[56:35] I'm talking about myself in a head were
[56:39] there did enough evidence to convict you
[56:42] all all our help us this morning and
[56:45] then they said they commended these
[56:48] people he said in said I know your works
[56:50] I know your labor I know your patients
[56:52] and help out at Kenneth's not their gym
[56:55] which are evil and that has tried them
[56:58] which say they are apostles and that you
[57:00] bet they are not and you found them to
[57:02] be liars I take all that into full count
[57:05] and I ask no more it has born and has
[57:08] patience and for my name's sake
[57:11] that was labored ha he said it has not
[57:15] painted but you braver for my name's
[57:18] sake
[57:18] you had patience you borne the burden
[57:22] and you've had patience and and all this
[57:25] and he labored for my name's sake and
[57:27] you can't have it found it find it but
[57:29] listen to verse 4 nevertheless I have
[57:32] somewhat against you and that's that you
[57:36] left your first love a man let me read
[57:41] that much for how they amplified if I
[57:43] can it says they're like this but I have
[57:48] one charge against you I have one charge
[57:52] to make against you that you have left
[57:56] abandon their love that you had it first
[58:00] you have deserted me your first love I
[58:04] thought God help us this morning if we
[58:07] look around a man we've been here you
[58:11] know the message and and then from these
[58:13] messages then we can go back and look at
[58:15] what the Prophet preached some 150 years
[58:18] ago and then we can look at our lives
[58:20] and how long we been here I wonder how
[58:22] to spell my love for him is this morning
[58:24] what it was when we first started
[58:28] Jeremiah 2:13 says like this for my
[58:32] people have committed two evils they
[58:36] have forsaken me oh can you imagine
[58:40] forsaking him the very one that can take
[58:45] us in a rapture
[58:47] the very one that can give us a lot this
[58:49] morning the very world that can save
[58:51] ourselves this morning that the married
[58:54] one but if you're in trouble this
[58:56] morning he can set you free but he said
[59:01] they'd forsaken me the fountain of
[59:03] living waters they've forsaken me oh god
[59:06] help us this morning I wonder how close
[59:09] we are this morning to him than we used
[59:12] to be oh you remember when you first got
[59:15] say when you first came to the message
[59:17] how close are you now how much do you
[59:22] love him I'm talking about him ain't
[59:24] talking about the Prophet amen well I
[59:26] believe the Prophet I loved the Prophet
[59:28] amen
[59:29] but I'm talking about Christ this
[59:31] morning how much do you love him this
[59:33] morning how much do you love him this
[59:38] morning that they've forsaken me the
[59:40] fountain of living waters and then food
[59:43] for themselves cisterns broken cisterns
[59:45] which cannot hold water hey man they
[59:51] cannot hold water they percent they
[59:53] committed two evils
[59:54] first therefore secondly the fountains
[59:56] and living waters when they clean to
[59:59] themselves cisterns trying to trying to
[1:00:02] get something that a whole water without
[1:00:04] him the broken cisterns payment systems
[1:00:10] which cannot hold water I believe God
[1:00:15] has created me new this morning for an
[1:00:18] intimate relationship with himself a man
[1:00:21] he wants us to love him above everything
[1:00:23] he wants me to love him more than I love
[1:00:25] my wife he wants her to love me for him
[1:00:29] more than she loves me if I should quit
[1:00:33] this morning she would hire my desire
[1:00:36] would be for her to keep personal and I
[1:00:40] assisted quit
[1:00:41] probably her desire would be for me to
[1:00:44] keep pressing on and that's stealing
[1:00:45] what he wants I remember when the
[1:00:50] prophet of God he driving down the road
[1:00:53] one time he asked his wife sister
[1:00:54] meaning he said how much they said
[1:00:57] you love the most me or him she said
[1:01:00] bill as much as I love you as much as I
[1:01:03] care about you said I love him more than
[1:01:05] I love you all she's he said that's a
[1:01:07] better answer that since I was willing
[1:01:09] to hear Mary man
[1:01:12] oh he's created us the church this
[1:01:15] morning for that intimate relationship

[1:35:09] singing I would listen to all the
[1:35:10] testimonies would be in vain
[1:35:12] if you kept me out of my own personal
[1:35:15] experience of personal walk with God hey
[1:35:19] man oh Christ
[1:35:20] depends upon our nearness to him he must
[1:35:26] be our friend and we must stick close to
[1:35:29] him as he does hey man he must stick to
[1:35:33] him he must be closer than a brother or
[1:35:37] we never have our first love
[1:35:39] hey man you know why Pluto or whatever
[1:35:43] they come up with another planet but you
[1:35:45] know why it's the coldest how many knows
[1:35:48] why it would be the coldest planet
[1:35:50] furthest from the Sun why do we get so
[1:35:54] cold every now man because we're getting
[1:35:58] far away from the soe n hey man we ain't
[1:36:02] close to the Esso n should be and
[1:36:05] because we're close to there so in like
[1:36:07] we should be we become cold when you
[1:36:10] come down and the churches spent at
[1:36:13] Dennis quill o'clock midnight
[1:36:15] man and we try to get people to get in
[1:36:17] there and worship God but because we
[1:36:20] disclosed through the Esalen as we used
[1:36:22] to be we can't get nobody to say hey man
[1:36:25] we can't get nobody to raise our hands
[1:36:27] we can't get nobody to watch we lost our
[1:36:30] first love can I read you some things
[1:36:38] the Prophet said he said now I tell you
[1:36:44] jesus said you are the salt of the earth
[1:36:46] but the salt lost its savor it is his
[1:36:51] fourth good for nothing but to be trod
[1:36:53] under the feet of men and I say tonight
[1:36:56] brethren that the church when it's lost
[1:36:58] its love it's lost its Savior and now we
[1:37:01] become a laughing block no matter how
[1:37:04] many gifts we got how many miracles we
[1:37:06] can perform how many anything first
[1:37:09] Corinthians tells us that though I speak
[1:37:11] with tongues of men and of angels I can
[1:37:13] move mountains with faith I give all my
[1:37:15] goods to the poor but I haven't got love
[1:37:18] I am nothing you lost the song when you
[1:37:21] lose low when you lose the love and so
[1:37:23] does the same it is it in the context
[1:37:26] there's only one thing left for the
[1:37:28] world the church to do that's to be
[1:37:30] salty and God will make the world
[1:37:31] thirsty like you that's right they'll
[1:37:33] close to be like you if you'll just be
[1:37:35] salty but we've lost that
[1:37:45] you want to be like you let me go
[1:37:48] outside I wonder I preached the message
[1:37:50] years ago what would church be like if
[1:37:53] it was like you wouldn't start on time -
[1:37:59] some of us be late if it's left up to
[1:38:04] some of us we wouldn't raise your hands
[1:38:08] if it was to worship Him if it was left
[1:38:11] up to some of us cuz we don't raise our
[1:38:14] hands if it's Church was like here what
[1:38:19] would be like
[1:38:21] help us Lord Thomas or again he says he
[1:38:27] said I don't care if you're Methodist
[1:38:31] Baptist Pentecostal Presbyterian expert
[1:38:34] Aaron come let us rejoice together when
[1:38:36] that time come when the church burnings
[1:38:38] brotherly love amen when the church
[1:38:41] finds its holy decency when the church
[1:38:43] finds its place in Christ in a call to
[1:38:46] the other members of money come and
[1:38:48] rejoice with us God wants to church the
[1:38:50] love heal a man because he went over
[1:38:54] here in the first to loosen his lost her
[1:38:56] sock light the Methodist churches lost
[1:38:58] in their life the Baptist churches lost
[1:39:00] her life the Pentecostal church has lost
[1:39:02] her life every light seems to be going
[1:39:03] what about me and you what about me I
[1:39:07] get he says and then tomorrow night
[1:39:09] talking in the Philadelphia Church age
[1:39:11] and then tomorrow night when it goes out
[1:39:13] just at the end you'll notice the angel
[1:39:14] appears right the end time and just at
[1:39:16] the end times will rebuke the church for
[1:39:18] losing its first love and how it's got
[1:39:21] away from God like they did them to the
[1:39:22] their the ages and at that time the
[1:39:25] rapture comes to take the church home
[1:39:26] their church goes up just at that time
[1:39:28] of the message and we we are nearing
[1:39:30] that age now did you get that
[1:39:32] alright see just at the time the angel
[1:39:35] the Church of messenger the age comes in
[1:39:38] to rebuke you for losing their first
[1:39:39] love brain trying to bring them back
[1:39:43] same thing to mention toward us tonight
[1:39:45] Angela comes back to rebuild them each
[1:39:48] age like that for what they had done so
[1:39:50] that makes my lap over in each every of
[1:39:53] the church ages this lap over one
[1:39:55] another for like that like climbing up
[1:39:57] as a step it's
[1:39:59] laying in laps like that going on they
[1:40:01] said it comes to their abuse why because
[1:40:04] they lost her love and this and this of
[1:40:06] this again he says our Heavenly Father
[1:40:10] we can see Lord that the church has lost
[1:40:12] its first love we can see that the
[1:40:14] church is fooled all over the nation has
[1:40:17] dropped not only the nation but the
[1:40:19] world we realized that she spoke the
[1:40:21] other morning and said that the seaton
[1:40:23] time is over here but the only place the
[1:40:26] sow seeds is in the foreign fields this
[1:40:29] is AG leaning over the stubble and Oh
[1:40:32] God rooted in words was right and now
[1:40:34] tonight when we see those precious ones
[1:40:36] as made a start a fair showing in the
[1:40:38] flesh trying to move up they realize
[1:40:40] that their lives don't coat up with a
[1:40:42] word there's something wrong somewhere
[1:40:44] they got pleasure tempers and in
[1:40:46] differences no God are ugly things that
[1:40:49] makes them behave and not act like
[1:40:50] Christians they found themselves not
[1:40:52] satisfied that weren't about from one
[1:40:54] organization to another from one place
[1:40:57] to another brother that was in 1962
[1:41:01] what about it now we see the same thing
[1:41:02] happening people not satisfied going
[1:41:06] from here to there wondering is that

[1:41:17] seed it's it's over here he said they
[1:41:20] said they're just a gleam now help us
[1:41:23] again he says and now father that was
[1:41:27] you not Solomon that was you and Jesus
[1:41:29] where he said God was in Christ
[1:41:31] reconciling the world tencel he was the
[1:41:34] beginning of the creation his body was
[1:41:36] the Redeem creation and now for the ages
[1:41:39] the church lost its first love and then
[1:41:42] in the last days you promised to call no
[1:41:44] minority the little flock at the last
[1:41:46] days but our hearts are jumping and my
[1:41:49] heart's a pounding when I think of that
[1:41:51] and know that your words are true none
[1:41:53] of them can fail that these people today
[1:41:55] understand that let the centre seek you
[1:41:58] at this hour before the gates closed and
[1:42:00] there'll be no more time let the
[1:42:02] brightest she starts getting out of step
[1:42:04] from this and that base she come back
[1:42:05] into step as a vision showed it a few
[1:42:08] weeks ago y'all remember that vision
[1:42:11] - screaming get back in line get back
[1:42:13] and step god help me this morning to get
[1:42:16] back in stem help me to get back in step

[1:42:27] love was we look where did we lose our
[1:42:30] first love look at this what I mean you
[1:42:34] got to do dis mornin is to seek to have
[1:42:38] our first leverage door brothers and
[1:42:41] sisters young people today though we be
[1:42:43] a child of God
[1:42:44] and I believe we all are here this
[1:42:46] morning our children of God amen
[1:42:49] but if we've lost our first love trouble
[1:42:52] is in your hand I don't care who you are
[1:42:56] today
[1:42:56] what's your name maybe have we lost her
[1:42:59] first love trouble is near hand from the
[1:43:04] Lord loveth he Jason if the scripture
[1:43:06] says he'll take the rod of my love cools

[1:43:26] the brother Quentin told me said going
[1:43:29] down there and you know together to hell
[1:43:31] I don't know how many came this morning
[1:43:32] but I commend you all for that
[1:43:35] like man you don't find too many
[1:43:37] churches that have per meetings anymore
[1:43:39] they get together I wonder what the
[1:43:43] world would say to us because when you
[1:43:49] first came you remember we talked about
[1:43:51] when we first met God our first love was
[1:43:57] blazing burnin we did things that seem
[1:44:01] ridiculous to the world they could call
[1:44:05] prayer meeting that church would be
[1:44:06] there but I wonder what the world says
[1:44:09] now they look at us we weren't beside
[1:44:12] people and they say oh yeah y'all
[1:44:15] haven't / meet tonight yep we ain't
[1:44:18] going
[1:44:20] what they think what they say oh I
[1:44:26] thought y'all went to church this time
[1:44:28] in this time yeah they got Church but
[1:44:30] you know I don't believe it's important
[1:44:32] to go all the time so I'm just gonna
[1:44:34] hang on go wonder what they think what
[1:44:42] people look at when they see us
[1:44:47] whatever when the children of Israel
[1:44:49] when they had to turn their backs in
[1:44:51] battle you remember when Joshua chosen
[1:44:53] hey the Lord promised and he fell in his
[1:44:55] place and lo you promised and then I
[1:44:57] wonder what happened when we turn our
[1:44:59] backs in battle and we die amen and we
[1:45:02] die without the Lord I wonder what
[1:45:04] people would say he lacked Morrow and
[1:45:10] strength and he died he just drifted
[1:45:16] away because he lacked strength in that
[1:45:19] marrow see if we'd lost her first love
[1:45:23] was I ever a child of God at all
[1:45:27] something to ask yourselves Bible says
[1:45:31] they went out from us because they were
[1:45:32] not of us might not think that I
[1:45:37] repented and really are not fully
[1:45:41] repented all I say Lord if I need to
[1:45:45] repent this morning I want to repent I
[1:45:48] want a full repeal if I have to make
[1:45:50] things right I want to make things right
[1:45:52] Lord then we not paid that I really
[1:45:53] repented and I have not helped me Lord
[1:46:01] may not be said that I only thought that
[1:46:04] I had love for Christ or love to Christ
[1:46:07] and never had it at all I don't want
[1:46:12] that to be said about me hey man may not
[1:46:18] be true me that I am as a wandering star
[1:46:22] for whom is reserved blackness of
[1:46:25] Darkness forever may not think that I'm
[1:46:29] a child of God but I but
[1:46:31] thank it but may I know that I know I
[1:46:34] know but I really know this morning
