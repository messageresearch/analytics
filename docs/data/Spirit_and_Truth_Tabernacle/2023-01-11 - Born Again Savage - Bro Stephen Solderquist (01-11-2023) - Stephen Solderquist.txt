out of the way and let brother Stephen come in his own special way amen God bless you tonight [Applause] amen God bless you Saints it's so good to be here I uh wanted to uh go and see brother uh Chris and the Saints down there in beckway and uh I was trying to plan it out I thought well I gotta fly through Miami I'd like to see brother Jack in the church and we looked at different ways to making it work and it just wouldn't work out I thought well I guess another time but this morning we got to Miami and the FAA all their computers were shut down and God said no you're going to stay so I'm I'm here and happy to be here but uh it's it's always a pleasure to be here with you all I I really I really consider you all family and uh really appreciate you I I am sorry we stole sister Rebecca um because I know she's family here but we she's been a real blessing to us and Sister Sarah was just at the church visiting and uh she had a wonderful special I told Brother Jack it just blessed blessed our heart so you know I don't know what brother Jack does on Wednesday nights he says he goes through uh some scriptures and stuff and I want to read uh just a scripture here while we're standing and then we'll speak on it a little bit if you want to turn over to Psalms chapter 1 you know thinking back as a kid Psalms chapter 1 sticks in my heart every uh everybody has different experiences as a kid but I had a a Godly old cowboy out on a ranch in Western South Dakota read this to me as a kid and it always stuck with me so we want to read this together Psalms chapter 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper now the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveeth away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the Judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish let's just say a little word of prayer and then I'll have you be seated heavenly father it's a privilege to be here tonight and it's a privilege to be here because of the Saints and brother Jack but most of all Lord It's a privilege to be here because you're here you've promised to be here with us wherever two or three are gathered and wherever you are is where we want to be so we welcome you into our midst we thank you for all your blessings and we commit this service to you in Jesus name amen you can go ahead and be seated uh I want to tell another little story about South Dakota and the kind of the topic I want to talk about tonight is related to a an experience I had there so I want to kind of just it I'm going to give a title but I don't want this to be a big old sunday sermon this is more just a Home Folks discussion you know how sometimes something needs to be said as a family and you sit around the table and you have a good discussion so I'm not going to be doing a big text and a big bunch of stuff but just a discussion and but I did want to give it a title because this title came from a bumper sticker that I saw in South Dakota and the the bumper sticker and the title is Born Again Savage now I have to say the first time I saw this bumper sticker I was back visiting uh my family in South Dakota and I saw this car it was a beat up old I don't remember what it was a Volkswagen or something and it was weaving in and out in traffic and honking the horn and the lady was throwing her fist out the window and gestures we won't mention and I saw this and I thought well that's right and all I could see was the Savage part why the Savage and so so as I went on then a few years later I went back just this last year with my wife to South Dakota and we visited Custer South Dakota it's in the Black Hills and there was a shop in there a Native American shop owned by a Native American lady and I went in the shop and I was looking around and it was pretty and all this and all of a sudden I see this pile of bumper stickers and it says Born Again Savage and I look out and sure enough there's that car and I thought okay you know and and to be honest I was a little offended the first time I had seen that bumper sticker and and so I got to talking to this lady and I said you know tell me about this bumper sticker and she said well I'm a Native American she's like I believe in the god of the Son and the god of the wind and the god of whatever all gods she believed in and I thought well that's kind of like a little denominational there you know you're multiple gods but you know you go on the sun god instead of the Son of God but anyway she she explained that she was really annoyed that Christians got to be born again and she didn't get to be born again as a Native American so she claimed to be a born-again Savage well I I couldn't I couldn't really you know understand that quite and I couldn't really agree with her but the more I got to thinking about it I realized that it actually does describe us as Christians quite a bit because as Paul would say in Romans chapter 7 he says for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me in other words he wants to do what's right this Spirit within him that God placed in him wants to do what's right but how to perform that which is good I find not and then he says I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me so we find that all of us have a part our flesh that is like a Savage and we have something that God placed in us from before the foundation of the earth his seed and then that seed brings forth and Sprouts forth in life as we receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit and we start our Christian walk and that part is the born-again part amen so you know but the thing about it is is that Satan likes to get us focused on one side too heavily or the other side too heavily and he does that on the individual basis as well as on the church basis so we have in our area there in Jeffersonville many of you have been there we have a number of churches locally and there I've noticed that this the churches have a little bit of a different slant or focus and I'm not talking about tapes or preachers only but what I'm talking about is some Churches like to preach against sin sin sin sin sin and you hardly ever hear anything about Grace and then other churches want to preach Grace Grace Grace Grace Grace Grace and really don't bring the hammer against sin and so what what I thought about was the fact now in college I graduated I've got a Bachelor's degree I really don't use most of what I learned in college on a day-to-day basis but there's a couple things that stuck with me one thing that stuck with me was a term called cognitive dissonance it's a psychological term and basically what it means is people don't like to hold opposing views or opposing thoughts in their mind at the same time they like things to be black or white clear-cut yes or no right or wrong and it's hard for people to hold two opposite things at the same time and now it's interesting because God has chosen and ordained for us to have to face cognitive dissonance because he has said I'm going to place my seed of life in you in a fleshly body and you're not going to escape that flesh unless you're raptured or go by way of the grave so you'll always be dealing with the flesh now like I said these churches they like to lean one way or the other many times they'll they'll preach against sin and they won't preach Grace or they'll preach Grace and they'll kind of leave off sin now we want to find a balance by the word because we understand that God hates sin he can't stand sin but yet he loved us so much that he went and paid that price on Calvary and so we are living in Grace but we don't want to make that a disgrace right so the problem of our age is we have so much mixing right Revelations 3 you know Leia the ca he said unto the Church of the laodiceans right these things saith the amen the faithful and true Witness the beginning of creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm in neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth last time I was here uh and and had the opportunity there to preach if you remember I talked about a recipe for mixing I don't know if you remember but I talked about how uh in Egypt the children of Israel they they liked the garlics and leeks but they also like the the um uh The Grapes of the land and we we talked about how you mix up a big old pie of garlic and leeks and grapes and honey and it would make you sick to your stomach and that's what that's what the Lord is sick to his stomach when we come and we want to just mix a little bit of this we want to mix a little bit of that we want to you know get focused so much on Grace that we we end up just not caring how our lifestyle is and we creep into backsliding and things like that or if we tighten up so tight that we can't have any Grace for anybody we have that judgmental spirit you know one of the things that I love about brother Brandon is you hear the stories of how you know you think well he would never have a friend that's a Catholic well no he had plenty of friends that were a Catholic for any of friends that were Baptist in fact he rubbed elbows with Sinners sounds like somebody else we know that's Jesus right so we don't want to get too far into legalism we don't want to get too far the other direction we want by the word to be straight down the middle of the line Glory now in uh actually let's let's turn for just a second to Second Peter chapter one uh it's such a wonderful chapter there and we won't have time to to look at it all I know being a Wednesday night I don't want to take too much time here but in second Peter chapter one uh he's talking here about how God has equipped us with everything we need for the journey and so we want to read a little bit about that second Peter chapter one and let's go to verse two he says Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness anything that's been given to us pertaining to life and godliness comes from God and he has packed us with what we need many times we don't believe it we don't see it we we see our sins we don't see what God has put in us we don't see the potential but he sees it and he says you're my child I've equipped you with everything you have need of just relax and yield to me and let me grow you day by day you know how it is many times if a child has been privileged to grow up in a house that maybe their parents had a little extra money and and they have a little nicer a little bigger house well then that child goes and gets married and then they think many times that they have to get a big fancy house just like their parents and they forget that it took their parents sometimes 20 30 years to get this big house and these nice cars and the kid thinks I got to do this in five years so they set unrealistic goals and we do that for ourselves and we do that for others on the spiritual side you know it it takes somebody you know one one week to clean up certain sins but then other times it can take years to fully grow out of those sins now you know Paul said there's no temptation given but what's common to men and we think a lot of times Well my Temptation my sin is so dark or so special or what so different it's not those Temptations those sins have been common to men and women for years and years and years so we have to struggle against that lie and say no this is a common thing it's wrong and God's provided a way of escape the problem is we look at the rest of that scripture where it says that he'll help us in that time of Temptation and we read it as he's going to help us to over uh to eliminate that it says he's provided a way of Escape but not a way of escape to eliminate your Temptation it actually says that you be able to bear that temptation so if you think about it there are some things that when God gives you the Holy Ghost and gives you a Deliverance they're gone immediately but then there are some things that God in his Sovereign Grace chooses to allow you to bear for some period of time that he knows and he has it to be where it's something that you overcome but now this is a really good thing because God doesn't want his bride to just where he pushes him in one side of the pipe and pulls them out the other but he wants them to be Overcomers and you remember Samson brother Branham said Samson when he slew that lion and he came back later he said that honey was the sweetest thing and he said if you have a Temptation and you have a trial and you have sin and mistakes in your life and you overcome that thing he said it's The Sweetest Victory it's like Samson's honey and so we find God in his Divine wisdom chooses the trials and The Temptations and the sins that you will face and that you will have to overcome and every one of us in here has it the Bible says that we do wrong if we think we are without sin we do have sin now so do we just abound in sin oh it's no big deal no no God's calling us to grow in Grace every day get a little closer to him every day get a little more free from sin every day get a little farther down the road but what's the problem in our day and age nobody likes or is used to denying themselves anything but the word of God calls us to deny our flesh to deny ourself and to choose the word and to choose the washing of the water of the word to our lives but so few people are willing to do do that and it's not a complex formula it is just yielding to the spirit and as second Peter here says he's already packed Us full of everything that we have need of he says there once again in verse 3 according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue verse 4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust how do you escape it you do it by what he's already packed into you being partakers of the divine nature is what he says there in verse 4. amen and besides this giving all diligence now he goes into the stature of the perfect man and for message Believers we're very familiar with this right and it's it's and let me pause and say this I am very thankful that brother Branham came and restored the word and revealed the word and revealed all these Mysteries we have such insight into things but many times we want to talk about the Seven Seals and the Thunders and the this and that and we forget to go back to the basics and the prophet said that God is hiding himself in Simplicity when we forget the great commandment to do unto to love our Lord Our God and to do unto others and then we forget the basic principles of the Statue of a perfect man adding to your faith virtue into your virtue knowledge and your knowledge Temperance when we leave off those Basics we find ourselves more easily sliding into temptation and to sin and to backsliding now I want to call out here if you go back and you listen to that message um uh statue of a perfect man brother Branham is talking about uh the the levels and he's drawing it out on a whiteboard or a chalkboard and he he he then he references Matthew I think it is chapter 7 or chapter five that but the scripture where Jesus says be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect you know now that scripture if you look at it a certain way can be very challenging and that is if you think that you have to fulfill that scripture by yourself you're in trouble because none of us can be perfect in this flesh but brother Branham as he's going through these levels of the Statue of a perfect man he says you know add to your faith virtue and so forth and so forth and then when he gets up there to Godliness he pauses and he says now there's your Matthew 7 or Matthew 5 whatever he he's that scripture he's referring to and he's saying that when you get to that level of godliness when you've grown faith and virtue and you keep walking you keep growing you keep denying yourself you're climbing up the ladder higher and higher you get to that level of godliness it's not something you're putting on it's something that's growing and pushing out from you but other people see you and they see Matthew 7. they see Perfection they see brother Jack and they think my goodness he has no sin he has no temptation and he doesn't have much sin anymore but yet in the flesh he and I both are only a couple bad decisions from a world of hurt all of us have to stay under the blood covered by the Rock of Ages and yielding to him daily we all have to deny ourselves and take up our cross and follow Jesus so I'm not talking complex stuff here this is simple stuff but it's something that we have to live daily and that's the hard part because the devil's really good at coming up with new stuff new movies new sports new different things and and then you know I'm in my 40s now so I realized that he also has different seasons where the devil brings different things to you you know Sports were a big temptation to me back when I was in my you know teens and 20s I still like to play basketball but it's not a big Temptation it's not a big problem I I used to really struggle you know I I have a little empathy for the sisters because you know my parents I played at a Christian basketball or Christian School basketball team and we wore pants it was a good old Baptist school and we partnered with them and they they were like fundamental Baptists so we all wore pants it was a blessing but then you know there was this guy Joe Ward Jumping Joe Ward from the CBA and he was this great basketball player and he came to town and he had a basketball camp and I worked a paper out saved up the money and and went to this basketball camp and then I was the only guy wearing pants you know so the second day I was like yeah I got some shorts in my backpack guys put on the shorts but of course since I hardly ever wear shorts my legs were as wide as anything that I got embarrassed by that put it back on the path so the Lord knows how to work but you know I I have some empathy for the sisters because you stand out you you it's harder to hide your Christian walk than it is for us guys us guys all we have to do is just remain silent many times and they don't know whether we're a Christian or not so I told uh I told a uh a young brother that was kind of struggling with shorts the other day um actually this was a while back I told him I was like I don't recommend as a Christian young man you necessarily go down to the beach and so forth but I said if you're ever down at the beach I said go in with your pants and go swimming in the water and then come out and see how many people are staring at you and Snicker it and you'll get a you'll get a little bit of a Feeling Just a Little Bit of what our sisters go through and of course he didn't he wasn't Keen to go do that because guys aren't used to facing that criticism but I think it's good and healthy for a guy to realize what our sisters face and I appreciate what you all stand for and what you do and so I think sometimes for us Brothers It's actually harder to deny ourselves and to to walk forward in this Godly walk because it's easy for us to just kind of go under the radar and just kind of swim along with what we're doing and and not make any waves a lot of times we don't have to make as big of a stand but the Lord has a way of eventually bringing stuff out to make you make a stand you eventually have to get off the fence and make a stand so this this what Jesus says there about be therefore perfect is uh you know like I said it was challenging for me for a while till I really realized that it's not based on my performance it's based on what he did in his performance that day on Calvary so you know I thought about um getting one of those born-again Savage uh bumper stickers and if anybody knows brother Nathan he's pretty particular about his cars I was going to preach this at the church there and uh and tell him I put a bumper sticker on his car but you know just like tape it on not not fully put it on but I have I haven't done that yet but uh it's a reminder because you know we don't want to be a Savage and we want to be born again but the reality like I said with cognitive dissonance is God has elected that we are both in our heart in our spirit our brother Brandon would talk about the soul and who we truly are we are a son and a daughter of God and when the flesh gets in the way and we make a little mistake it's so easy for the devil to come and discourage us and start to work on us and say you know you're you're not a real Christian you're not filled with the Holy Ghost look at what you did look at what you did now there's a big difference between falling into sin and swimming in sin and many times people say oh I just made a little mistake but they're they're living a full lifestyle of sin and so we do need to check our hearts and check our lifestyles and check our lives and if we find that it's not just an occasional mistake then then we need to get back to the altar but when we know when we're following the Lord when we're denying ourselves when we make those mistakes our heart or the Holy Spirit checks us and it's our it's our pleasure to go back to the Lord in Repentance we we long to do that for we know that it brings us back into fellowship with God and it clears clears the deck so to speak so you know there's a whole lot of other things there in second Peter chapter one I I didn't even pay attention to when I started and how long I was going on but I want to talk a little bit more about this this uh this lady so you know how they say truth is Stranger Than Fiction so if if I was going to talk about the Flesh and the spirit and I was going to ask you what what's a story that brother Branham tells on the Flesh and the spirit what's like one of the famous stories that he tells probably everybody in here would recall and remember he talks about the two dogs right the black dog and the white dog and the Indian chief so I want to read that real quick just a little clip of that because it's pretty telling the way he describes this so from a message called God's provided way of healing brother bam says this he said you see there's two men living in you did you know that one time we had an Indian converted in the meeting and asked him how he was getting along now listen to what he says on this he said after he'd received the Holy Ghost now many times we think about that we think oh well I struggle before I receive the Holy Ghost but this is after he received the Holy Ghost this Indian chief then talks to brother random so he says um uh let's see where am I after he received the Holy Ghost said well he said there's been two dogs in me said one of them is an evil dog and one of them is a good dog and said they just fuss and fight all the time and he said why Chief said which one overcomes he Chief said well it depends on the one which the chief feeds the most well that's not giving any comparison to the devil and the Holy Spirit comparing it as dogs but look there is a good in you and there's evil in you and there's belief and unbelief and it depends on which one you feed the most that's all which one you feed the most it would behoove us friends to go back to the basics in our daily walk and think about how much time am I spending truly in the word and in prayer let me tell you we've started and I don't know maybe I need to get some advice from Brother Jack on this but we we just started reading the Bible in a year and uh of course you get into the the Book of Genesis there and my youngest daughter is six and I've got a seven year old and I'm getting questions that I don't necessarily want to talk to these young girls about so maybe your brother Jack can advise me on the best age to start the Bible in a year program for kids maybe I need to keep that to my wife and I and the older two but I'll say this it's been amazing to see how the kids have responded so quickly to having now we had devotions before but you're reading the Bible in a year you got to do two chapters in the morning and one chapter in the afternoon so you got to read a lot more and so they've been reading a lot more and they're responding well but what I was going to say on that on the topic of feeding is it's pretty hard to truly fall into temptation when you're reading multiple chapters of the word of God every day and you're praying not just bless my food oh Lord but when you're truly breaking through into prayer it makes Temptation so much weaker that it just it's like a covering that that that the Temptation and the sin just bounces off it just falls off and so we find this to be very very true both for because brother Branham said it because the word of God says it but also from experience I think all of us have experienced that that when we turn our Eyes Upon Jesus when we feed and do the right things that Temptation goes away but now this this lady that has this born-again Savage sticker this is the part I said that truth is Stranger Than Fiction so she's Indian and as you know Indians and Native American Indians have interesting names like Sitting Bull or different things and and so this lady her name is Kelly Two wolves tools like the two dogs you know and uh I didn't feel led to really I could tell in her spirit she was kind of just angry at be at Christians and just in general so I didn't feel it was the time to witness to her but I thought my goodness lady you're so close to the truth having a name like two wolves talking about being a born-again Savage wanting to be born again but just not wanting to necessarily be a Christian you're so close to the truth but yet you're being held back and so I I've I've not prayed for her a lot but occasionally she'll come on my heart and I'll pray for her and if I get when I get back to Custer South Dakota I'm going to try and go buy a bumper sticker for brother Nathan and talk to Kelly Two wolves so Paul would say this in Galatians 5. this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh you know last time I was here I think I also talked about Gideon I just love that story of Gideon and if you remember in that story of Gideon we we focus on the pictures that were broken and the Torches and all that stuff but after God told Gideon you're a mighty man of courage and Valor he spirit of God Came Upon Gideon but God also gave him something to do he had to go cut down the Grove and clean up his house and all these different things and and he was kind of ashamed remember he tried to saw down these trees at night which I never understood because how do you saw down a tree and keep it quiet but he he tried to you know kind of like the brothers running under the radar you know he just tried to clean up quietly but it got to be known right and he had to take a stand and as I said God makes us take a stand and he did he does this and it was after that he was still a little bit like hesitant like I don't know am I is this right God are you really with me and we know he puts out the fleeces before the Lord and all this stuff but remember when we talked about this before we said what really triggered him over to speak the same words as the Lord and go forth and actually have this battle was when God allowed him to go down with his servant to the camp of the enemy and hear what the enemy was saying about him yes and I would say to you tonight is that we hear the devil whispering in our ear when we make a mistake you're not a child of God you're a sinner you're a failure you're no good or if we're doing really good he takes the other side and says um I don't know I don't know about that brother Troy back there he doesn't do it like I do it and I'm pretty sure he's doing it wrong and he's got some funny ideas about this that or other Doctrine we get that Temptation and you know I'm just kidding about brother Troy just using him as an example but that happens and it could even happen to somebody in the church towards brother Troy because brother Troy is not perfect news flash she's not perfect but he's a great guy and he's a Son of God and he's my brother and the reality is once and if you're guilty of the least you're guilty of it all it's not that brother Troy's sins are worse than mine or mine are worse than brother Troy's and brother Jack's above us all it's not that it's that brother Jack has dedicated his life to the gospel and he's growing in Grace he's yielding he's dying daily he's leading by example and all of us are walking up that road but the devil's job is to discourage us and get us off the road either by thinking we're something when we're not or thinking we're nothing when we are something that is the call tonight is to just Live Your Life in Grace denying yourself and don't get pulled to one side or the other thinking you're something when you're not or thinking you're nothing when you know you are something by the grace of God because second Peter remember it says he's packed everything into you that you need for the journey and he loved you and me he knew before the foundation of the Earth every mistake I would make but yet he still died for me what a savior and it's not to belittle the Seven Seals or the seven Thunders or those things those are in the word and they're wonderful but the the greatest thing to me is this God in Simplicity and the fact that I can live a Christian Life and I can make mistakes and I can I can recognize by the grace of God the cognitive dissonance that I am both flesh and the spirit of God and it's okay to be in the flesh not living in sin not backsliding but it's okay to be in the flesh and in the spirit and let the spirit grow and take over and control the flesh it is possible some people will tell you I can it's not possible to overcome this that or the other uh there was a gentleman that many years ago his wife left him ran off with another man and when I got to know him he was a much older man he was in our church and he had never remarried like many do they run out and find a divorced woman and live in adultery and all these things but he never did that and I asked him I said how did you do that because so many men when they're divorced say I can't live without the attention of a woman I can't do this I can't do that how did you do it and he said you know what there was a time when Satan sent a woman after me and she was flirting with me and at first it caught my attention he said and as I started to speak to her and flirt with her the spirit of the Lord came to me not audibly but reminded me that I had a choice did I want to be a Christian like a true real Christian in the power of God or did I want to just live with a woman and he said I realized that no matter how nice it would be for the attention of this lady the thing that makes me the most happy and that I want more than anything is to be a son of God and from that moment he never spoke to that woman again and he never had a girlfriend and he lived a holy Godly life until he passed away and I thought what an example you know it reminded me what brother bam said about that pearl of great price do we are we convinced that he is enough and that he's the best for us I think we are but I think Satan discourages us when we make a mistake and it's easy to hear him say you're nothing you're just a sinner you're not good enough but go back and read second Peter 1 and be encouraged that the reality is when we go down to the enemy's camp and we're up at when we've grown and we've grown and we've grown and we've gotten to that level of godliness they look at us and they just don't know what to do that's a perfect man no he's not perfect but I can see why they would think he's a perfect man because God is demonstrated visibly through a sister or a brother that's yielded their life to him brother Jack I don't know how long I've gone I don't know what you want um but uh you know I I hesitate to sing because this is a singing Church and I don't know Sister Rebecca is not on the piano and all that stuff but um actually I might get in trouble for putting her on the spot but if sister Jennifer wants to come up here in just a second we'll pray and if she'll come up and help me sing a little song we just want to sing a little song for you um I don't know if The Pianist could come oh we don't okay well maybe we can sing it acapella I don't know if you know that song the goodness of God I will try and sing that um I'll definitely need Jennifer to help me with that one since uh since uh we don't have the piano but I just want to say I really appreciate you all um I'm sorry that I was a little bit late the Lord's been trying my patience there with uh the airport you know messing up and then accidents on the road and it's uh but it's it's a real pleasure to be with you tonight so let's go ahead and pray Heavenly Father Lord we just love you so much and and I know many times in my life I felt like I've had to be perfect on my own and I'm so glad that you sent a prophet to remind us that it's not based on our performance it's based upon what you did that day on Calvary and then Paul would come along in second Peter and remind us that you've packed all that we need for the journey into us we just have to yield and we have to trust and we know that without faith it's impossible to please you so Lord as much as we can we believe and we lift up our hearts to you and as I think it was the disciples said Lord help our unbelief anything that we have that's not like you Lord we know we're still in this flesh we know we're not perfect but Lord we all have a desire to be clean and to be holy and to be the right type of Bride so help us Lord and help us then to take what Christian development you've given us and not to Lord it over people with the wrong attitude but to use it in a Ministry Lord to be a light to this lost and Dying World be with us Lord I pray Lord that you be with the spirit truth Tabernacle Lord that you'd strengthen them and Lord I'm just still believing as I was talking to brother Jack the other day believe in Lord for that building that right building at the right time we know it's on its way we claim it by faith and we thank you for it pray this in Jesus name amen all right Jennifer if you [Applause] you got another mic or just the one just the one all right [Music] [Music] follow your mercy

life you have been so so good [Music] with every breath that I am able I will sing of the goodness of God praise the Lord [Applause] I praise the Lord you can be seated just for a moment there I told you the um the Lord would just drop something on purpose for us tonight that's what he told Ruth when she was in the field Boaz told the the Reapers make sure you put something there on purpose just for her and I believe the Lord sent brother Steve in the sway um you know just to bless us tonight and I really really enjoyed uh the sermon really really enjoy it so that's the first time you actually shared that one here or I mean uh you didn't share it at home yet uh no not at home I had an opportunity to reach up at Hagerstown okay all right well I tell you that was that was a that was a a nice one there brother we really really enjoyed it and and even uh how the Holy Spirit just picked up the thought on yielding yielding yielding um that was Sunday morning's uh sermon brother brother um Quentin was telling me he was out in um Phoenix Phoenix Arizona brother Aaron McGary uh preached on Sunday morning and and his uh title was something like what is the perfect will of God for your life this year so here the holy spirit is kind of working the same topic from coast to coast and uh just lets us know that we're right where God wants us to be and and I tell you I just thank God that's that's brother Steve was just um ministering I was also thinking um you know the Lord has blessed their church but I remember um and I think you all were there when the church was in the schoolhouse yeah so they watched that Journey the church just kind of moved from place to place and how God just opened up the doors and and brother Stevens just been encouraging me all along the way the other day he sent me a text and like brother I just believe uh y'all getting closer and closer to you know that that manifestation that I believe is going to happen anytime now so I say brother I receive it I receive it I receive it God is good God is good this was this was all right Born Again Savage and I even just think about the lady's name right uh Kelly Two wolves um just a name like that her parents have no idea that they gave her a name that would give her a particular character and and from that character a bumper sticker sticker would be developed and she'd become a part of a sermon here in Florida God is something else amen but we uh we thank God and I pray that truth would be brought to her that she'll understand that you don't have to be upset with Christians you can get the same Jesus he's free to all and uh and he can change your life you know so we thank God let me get the uh announcements and we will prepare to dismiss for tonight but um we just thank the Lord
