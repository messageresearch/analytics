Hebrews 6 amen Hebrews 6 we want to start at verse 11 Hebrews 6 beginning at verse 11 and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope unto the end that ye be not slowful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises for when God made promised to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by his himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verely swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all Strife weing God willing more abundantly to show the HS of promise the mutability of his cancer confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul but both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil whether the for hunner is for us entered even Jesus maiden high priest Forever After the order of MDC Lord that we read your blessed precious words and anyone that's

from under heaven and Moses built an altar and called the name of it Jehovah nii for he said because the Lord has sworn he's swearing amen right that the Lord will have war with amalec from generation

wine they're stimulated from the revelation of the word heyen see that inward man feeds on the word he don't want nothing else but the word it got to be the word cuz the word word conquers all the word defeats the enemy anytime any place anywhere even on his own ground if God could have gave us anything better than the word of God to defeat the enemy he would have so he gave us his word to defeat Satan and I want to tell you Saints we're in a war and the greatest about ever fought is in the mind remember but there are two phases there are two phases all right among Believers all right there's an intellectual phase what people think by way of knowledge how they know Jesus Christ the word but then there's another phase those that know him by a spiritual Revelation a spiritual understanding the Bible said in all that getting get wisdom wisdom is the principal thing that word principle means the fet man the F that's the best part of the calf amen that's what Jesus that's what the prodal son fed to his son that return that's what Abraham fed to mzc Hallelujah you know The Witcher indu even fed that desent sow the F the bestass go get the bestass God has given us the best Christ is the wisdom of God Christ is the power of God Christ is the center of God's worship Christ is the best amen Christ is the mystery of God reveal Christ is revealed in his own word and there's an invisible Union of the bride of Christ aren't you glad so it's Christ he's our Center am he's the center of our joy Christ Hallelujah God oh hallelujah oh that's why we here when a battle we're a battle God has called us to battle we see the types all down through time they won are you on the winner side I've decided to take sides with Jesus you know I want to tell you something your enemy sleeps with you it's not your spouse your enemy eats with you your enemy works with you your enemy goes shopping with you everywhere you go your enem is there Paul said when I would do good evil is always present with me I found that there's a law within my members the flesh worth against the soul the carner minded man receive nothing from God the caral minded man is imity against God Jesus said If any man come after me let him first deny himself take up his cross and let him fall after me daily yes sir you mean daily I have to take up my cross yes daily daily you must have take must take up your cross Paul said I Die daily and you can be renewed daily we need a refilling every day amen so we have to Die daily out our own thoughts out to reasoning out to our own imaginations cuz my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my ways your ways as high as the heaven is above the Earth so are my ways from your ways and your thoughts to my thoughts say the Lord but he says seek ye the Lord why he may be found call upon Him wise near sir the scripture tells us in Amos amen 811 amen seek the Lord why said that many shall run to seek the Lord right and shall not find him say there will be a famine in the land not for bread or water for hearing the word of the Lord many shall Wonder from SE to see wonder the Bible tells in Proverbs 21:16 a Wonder in mine dwells in the habitation of the Dead which is demons wow so God come to reveal the word to us this message of the hour so we don't have to wonder see Cain went to to the land of ND the land of wandering the Bible said in the book of Judah be wandering stars but we're morning Stars we're not wondering Stars I wonder if this right I wonder if that right I no God come to reveal to us what is Right amen and his word is true and every man's a liar amen hallelujah but you know God made a promise he swore he said I'm going to fight with amalec from generation to generation now I don't want we not going to go into all of that today but keep in mind amalec came from the seed of Esau wow and Esau was the conm minded believer right that's right right Esau hated the birthright and see amlc even though he come descended from Esau amlc hated Israel when Israel first came out of Egypt rejoicing praising the Lord there there goes the amalekites right there to attack them that's right they attacked the weak ones the Bible said those that were kind of worn out and weak those that were lagging behind see you can't get you can't lag behind you got to be steadfast unmovable always about into the work of the Lord that I labor is not in vain amen hallelujah cuz he's going to fight anyway cuz amalec he hated the amalekites hated Israel they fought Israel you study scripture all through time during the time of that's why God told told s sa Samuel tell Saul to utterly destroy the amalekites but he didn't and David later defeated but many of them got away and then even the time of hezeki there were more amalekites in the time of Esther there were more Amal amalekites but finally they were destroyed praise God in the Book of Esther Hallelujah and hmon came from the amalekites you see you see they hated Israel We Are Spiritual Israel those demons hate us right Hallelujah I said those demons hate us 200 million demons were loose in this end time not just in the political realm through Hitler and muscolini and stying but in the spiritual realm to come against the bride of Christ so the devil hates us Jesus said the world hates you he said remember it hated me first that's why he said love not the world need the things of the world all this in the world lust that I lust to the flesh the proud of life he that loves the world the love of the father is not in him Hallelujah and what happened when the Lord Jesus Christ when he when he went in the wilderness he was tempted yes by the devil right and the Bible said he was tempted in all points Hebrews 4 All Points lusted eye lust of the Flesh and the pride of life those are all points after that the government to come after you but it was tempted in all points yet without sin all right but praise the Lord you built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ and though every demon may come against you hell shall not Prevail against you Hallelujah you believe that because you're built right the prophet said I didn't come to build a system all right I didn't come to build an organization he said I come to build he said God sent me to build the individual yeah see it's Christ in you the hope of glory that's what it's all about so you have to recognize who you are recognize your day and his message recognize that you can do the Greater Works recognize that whatsoever I say now this when you you come to the faith amen all right praise the Lord amen come into the faith see we hes we're hes of Salvation amen you know I have some some quotes I want to read as we enter you know uh keep in mind from the time that beright was stolen Esau hated Esau hated now he didn't hate it the birthright he didn't want no one else to have it right I mean he didn't he didn't love the birthright what a me he just didn't want no one else to have it and see that's how the devil is at time excuse me the devil don't want the Holy Ghost he don't want nobody else to have it the devil don't want this message he hate it good God but he don't want no one else to have it you see but we love it amen it's the word of God it's the word of God revealed it's what's going to get us out of here it's what's changing Us From the Inside Out it come right from the Bible it's Amen it's revealed from Genesis the Revelation you know the devil hate that he hate Revelation yes he does hallelujah praise the Lord but we love it the Lord said in the book of Psalm the PSAL said I've set the lord always before me for he is at my right hand I shall not be moved Hallelujah so we as as Sons and Daughters of God God want us to know God want us to be conscious at all times that he's with us sir amen not just praying but when you you know you can say I pray to God now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep no that but you when you seek him that's a whole another level you're seeking his presence to seek his face means to seek his presence and you want to know that he's with you Hallelujah you know Elisha and hezeki and you know they knew that those angels were with them and we Moses knew that God was backing him up brother Moses brother Paul even brother Bram knew that the angel was backing them up what what about you and I the same pfy here with us right we all as the Son and Daughter of God we have a Halo we have a light we're not off the word amen what happened in the day of Pentecost there was a clothing tongue like as a fire set upon each of them where do you think it probably set probably upon their right shoulder amen hallelujah set upon each of them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost sints of God we we ought to look more in the Unseen Faith looks into the Unseen Abraham call those things that are not as though they were Hallelujah Abraham moved by faith amen and he received the promise and God told him uh Hallelujah that I'm going to bless your seed as well Hallelujah oh that's why we're glad this morning Hallelujah for what God has done now now as we continue on as as we encourage each other in the Lord the Bible said don't be surprised though don't marble cuz Satan also just like God have Angels second Corinthians 11:13 to15 Marva don't don't Marvel cuz Satan himself have Angels who transform themselves into angels of light see so what are you saying you have the power of God and you have the power of the devil and those are the two Powers that's fighting in the universe in every human being on the face of this Earth is influenced by one power of the of the other amen we in one power or the other now there was a type in the Old Testament Canaan was the land that was promised to to Abraham his seed after him rather to enter into Canaan that was the promise but our promise today Hallelujah is to live in the power of the Holy Ghost that's our promise today right amen and in Christ we can conquer all things you believe that in Christ we're Victorious Hallelujah in Christ we have Victory but remember you can't receive Victory or even character except by suffering all right cuz character is our Victory amen character is not a gift now the Bible tells us God gives every man different gifts everyone a Measure of Faith he gives a measure of Grace he gives the Holy Ghost he he give many gifts he give healings he give many things but character is not a gift character is a victory in other words you have to be an overcomer amen you going to be tested remember we we heard from our theophany in this end time our word body According to second second Corinthians 5 and 1 Paul said if this Earthly house be dissolved I have another one Eternal now keep in mind eternity is not millions of amounts of somewhere all right eternity is here in another dimension that moves much faster than this Dimension Amen brother Jack we know that's part of Einstein's theory 34 billion 5 96 million miles per second it's faster than that the prophet said that other dimension is billions times faster so Einstein saw something he kept splitting the atoms Einstein saw that there was a power out there that he just couldn't touch he kept splitting the atom he kept splitting and kept splitting and kept splitting Einstein saw no end scientists called it a superior I force scientists call it an an intelligent Force but we know it's God it's allmighty God it's the power of God it's eternity amen hallelujah and they say scientist the prophet say scientists are are seeing these lights and they're calling them spuck and he's but one day they going to pick you up see we all have a light all right brother that's right I don't say this to glorify myself but many strangers have have over the years have have told me or told some of my friends that were with me said you see that guy over there said there's a light over him and see every son and daughter of God you have a light you have a presence that's God's presence surrounding you do you believe that that's right that's the word of God the prophet said the P fire is not just with me he said the plii with the church heyen that's what happened on the day of Pentecost and another book of Acts is here amen you believe that this bride this end time Believers will write another book of Acts it's Christ in you to hope of glory I shall be with you and I will be with you and shall be in you oh saints of God I just want you to look more into the Unseen let us all look more into the Unseen the angels God are here Christ is here hallelujah he's here he's here in the form of the spirit he's here in the power of the spirit amen he's the invisible God Amen and that's why he made an invisible Union Christ in you there's an invisible Union that is taking place you who were dead in trespassing and sin has he quickened he's brought us to life and they sung the song see we have the devil's answer Christ is alive say don't cry why are we he's here he's risen he's alive amen praise the Living God that's why we should be rejoicing at all times cuz Christ is with us hallelujah Glory I'm so glad for what he's doing I'm so glad for what he promised to do amen and what he has done what he's doing now and what he promised to do the veil is the flesh the veil is what keeps us from seeing God face to face in this church that's right the veil is what keeps us from seeing the Angels at their positions this morning standing by the seats the veil is what keeps us from seeing him we're hid behind the veil and the veil is the flesh we are Sons and Daughters of God God we're in the presence of God see the voice of God the word of God brings God's presence on the scene remember in the in the garden the voice of God came walking in the cool of the day Adam Adam where are thou what they ran from his presence they ran from his presence even Cain went out from the presence hallelujah hallelujah his presence is fullness of joy hallelujah oh in his presence is fullness of joy oh Lord let us live in your presence let us walk in your presence that's why they they cried in the Old Testament I rather be in our house I rather dwell in the house of the Lord and D the tent of the wicked I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of the Lord cuz in the Old Testament they knew when they enter in the house of the Lord they were in his presence amen we know those churches out there many places is I God the glory of the Lord has departed he's knocking let him put him out but we here gathered together in Christ's name amen we're not in my name we're not in brother Jack's name we're gathered together in the name of Jesus Christ Heen and he promised if you gather anywhere in my name where two or three I'm in your midst we believe the word the full word he said every time you come to church or wherever you meet in his name I'm with you I'll be in your midst oh let us look more than that let us not take it light amen let us not let anything slip Christ is with us you mean Everywhere I Go Everywhere I Go he's with me Hallelujah Glory praise the Lord he's backing me up the Lord and his host remember Goliath he told David David said you come to me with the shear a sword and a sheld but I come to you I come to you in the name of of the god of Israel in The Lord of hosts I come to you in the name of Jehovah seah the Lord of hosts Amen in this day because I come the right way I didn't come in my own name but because this day because I came in God's name he said I'mma take your head off Hallelujah and as long as you're walking in his name as long as you're walking in the spirit and not in the flesh as long as you're walking in Christ you have Victory you believe that Hallelujah that's why we walking up I'm walking by faith and I'm add to my faith amen virtue and I add to my virtue knowledge and I and my knowledge tempers what I'm doing I'm walking in Christ amen the virtue of Christ the knowledge of Christ The Temperance of Christ the patience of Christ amen the godliness of Christ the brotherly kindness of Christ and as long as I walk in him he's with me I will never fail I'll never be defeated I will never lose a battle so we got to keep walking in Christ and he's the light we walk in the light the beautiful light heyen let's keep walking through all trials through all tests through all shortcomings I'm walking in Christ Hallelujah what he said I never leave you be not afraid I'm with you Hallelujah and remember everywhere Israel went knowing that God was with them what happened what happened the enemies Hearts fainted amen everywhere Israel went yes sir and you in Christ those demons have to leave everywhere Christ went those demons cried out we know who God you're the Holy One Of God don't torment us before our time don't cast us into the deep they knew they had to give obedience they had to give knowledge they had to give had to acknowledge that Christ was there they knew that he had power and authority they said don't cast into the deep they know where they going see see the demons know where they're going you don't have to be afraid I want to tell you why you don't have to be afraid see because the devil is afraid of you he's afraid of that blood and that word and as long as you fortified behind the word of God and you wash in the blood no demon in the h H can defeat you you believe that that's what the devil is afraid of that word and that blood growing up as a young boy I I saw demons but every time I saw demons and they came after me in that Dimension they're real the only thing I could do was plead the blood and every time not sometime not every now and then every time I ble pleaded the blood of Jesus Christ those demons left they disappeared I'm telling you it's the truth see God wants you to exercise your faith now you don't go out and start no fight with the devil but you take the challenge amen cuz the devil is going to challenge you on every hand see see see the amalekites Israel was rejoicing going about their own business but the amalekites attacked them so we we've taken too much off the devil I want to say that again we've taken too much off the devil it's time to rise and take the sword of God's word and drive it in the heart of the enemy it's time to claim your rightful position amen it's time to claim your inheritance amen I said it's time to claim your possession it's time to serve notice on Satan amen I'm claiming my family amen I'm claiming everything on everything that the devil has taken from me amen I claim it back right now in the name of Jesus Christ what this April 14th sir April 14th 2024 everything that God has given me all my promises everything that the devil has stolen from me this day I take it

give in don't give in to Satan it is written we have victory in the Name of Christ amen praise the Living God that's what God came to do in his end time that's why he sent a prophet with the message to introduce who Jesus Christ the Messiah to the world the Messiah on Earth Revelation 10:1 Christ came down in the power of the Holy Ghost revealing his word to you and I but you as an individual you as sons of God you as Daughters of God have to recognize your day and its message recognize who you are recognize you can do the Greater Works you know one of the curses among the bride one of the curses among the true believers they don't know who they are some don't read their Bible some don't even pray that's why God sent a prophet with the message to shake the people up to call the people out from all over the world every nationality under Heaven every nationality under Heaven my sheep know my voice he tell the number of the Stars you are stars of God he calleth You by name and the Myst of mystery of God came down from heaven it's the word of God to call call your name I want to tell you this morning you are registered in heaven you are Mount Zion your name is in the book

Christ you take it see eat it consume it Faith come by hearing and hearing by the word will partake us of his divine nature the Holy Ghost quicken in the word in our hearts makes us partakers of Christ's divine nature we partakers of the inheritance of Christ why because we are a praise God hallelujah we ass I tell the Saints back home the couples brother Jack I said the Bible said Abraham and Sarah were HS together where Abraham name was on the checkbook Saron was too that's right uhuh that's right I said some brothers said this my checkbook it's not it's not it wasn't Abraham and Sarah it was Abraham or Sarah you understand me you know if you put Abraham and on the checkbook is no good for the wife they have to be amen you have to have both but or you have just as much right woo you have just as much right as the Lord Jesus Christ I Hallelujah cuz he come in my name Jesus Christ say he come in my name Jesus Christ say you come in his name oh praise the Lord your your name is just as good on the checkbook we know the bank of Heaven is responsible amen amen and we know every check you write by faith is you know it's not going to bounce you just got to have enough Faith to write the chat yes sir you know you know the fundamentalist they had they had enough you know resources resources right in the bank but they didn't know how to write the check and the Pentecostal they didn't have no resources but they knew how to write a check you see but when you put them together woo that's the bride those the True Believers you put it together together without faith without works faith is dead but works is Faith expressed and faith and love works together faith and love are the two wirs that works together and everywhere there's Faith there's love Faith workers by love Faith In Love is husband and wife amen are you glad this morning oh we serve a living God these are God's secrets that he's given to you and I and remember the secret is this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary Hallelujah and she know what he wants done with the word she can tell the devil it is written she don't have to argue with the devil God does not argue neither does his children so you don't have to argue with the Devil even Michel didn't take a railing accusation against the devil now keep in mind Satan went to michah why did he go to Michael cuz Michael is the Archangel of all the Angels Michael in the Angelic realm is Christ and Satan knew that Michael had had the power of the Resurrection Satan knew that so he went to Michael disputing Moses body what y'all bear him he couldn't find where where's he at where's his body where is he M said the Lord rebuke thee no AA even when when Joshua the high priest was there in Zechariah 3 he was all the Bible say he had on filthy garments he was filthy see we were born in sin shaper in iniquity came to the world speaking lies had on filthy garments that's why God restored a full word back back the forward back to wash us hallelujah there's a washing as we hear the word the pure honor to the word what is it is washing us the washing of the Water by the word why cleaners us up cleaning us up why we must be in fine linen cleaning white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints the book of ecclesiastics said let your garment be Pure White let your garment be white amen hallelujah oh I'm glad for the Garment it's not a strange garment was the washing of the Water by the word hallelujah and see Joshua had on filthy garments but the Bible said and the Satan same went before God accusing accusing Joshua the high priest but what did the Lord said said he's filthy he knew it was filthy but he said do this here he told the servants go get some other apparel go get a robe get get everything that's needed and and and change Joshua wash him wash him up wash him up see a prophet washes the priest that's why God sent the prophet to wash even the ministry was just the lay members gone stray the leaders brother were astray too all went astray so God sent a prophet with the message to wash sir that we may be clothed I want to say this here the prophet say I have a my desire is to dress the bride hallelujah it's the with the word yes sir are you glad this morning I'm glad give Jesus Christ a hand of Praise amen hallu so the Lord rebuke Satan said the Lord rebuke thee and Joshua went forth came forth clean up Hallelujah and that's why I'm happy tonight today I gave him my old filthy garment and I'm Rover with pure white he's it's the washing of the Water by the word we're feasting on this Mana from Heaven praise the Lord I'm so thankful so the angels God encamp about those who reverence him we're in the presence of God all the time I never leave thee nor forsake Thee I will be with thee all the always to the end he's with us now he promised he'll never leave us nor forsake us remember even um Daniel when Daniel was praying for understanding seeing all I getting get understanding get wisdom get understanding the scripture said in the book of Dan in the last days they that know their God should do exploits you should be purified and made white you will be tried that's why the prophet could tell us the greatest battle or the greatest thing that ever happened to you is the test the trials and you got to be an overcomer are you an overcomer Caleb said we are more than able brother Paul said we are more than conquerors amen amen Hal Hallelujah so to stand that test through all trials that's why he allowing him what's he doing he's molding character he's molding character what the scripture said talked about a city he that can ruleth his Spirit he that ruleth his spirit in the Book of Proverbs 16:32 I believe is Moder than he that taketh the city what are you saying more than anything you must learn how to master human ability because God has created you to become master of every circumstance what are you saying we know that there's nothing too hard for the Lord is anything too hard for the Lord there's nothing too hard for the Lord he asked Abraham so we can look and see the promises of Abraham we see our promises Amen brother capus God bless you you and your wife God bless you all but we're so thankful for for being the Royal seed amen of Abraham amen and if I could get to a few more notes I want to see what time it is I don't want to Pro go too much longer at all I'm flip through real fast very fast I'm just thankful I'm flipping through I'm flipping through what what I want to is something I want to address one more thing amen lot of just scriptures I print out scriptures sints that way that way I uh I can uh don't have to turn and have you reading all day I just PR them out amen now the Bible said this remember Galatians 4 and you don't have to turn there for it is written that Abraham had two sons the one by the bond made the other by a free woman but he who was of the Bond woman was born after the flesh that's why we must be born again amen the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you see it's not enough to learn the message you can learn the message that's not good enough but you must receive the person Jesus Christ that's when it's real to you so woman was born out of the flesh but he of the free woman was by promise is a promise Jesus said in Luke 24 he promised he he said a promise of the father what's our promise we said it earlier our promise is the Holy Ghost all through the New Testament the Bible speaks of the promise the Bible said even through the through the Old Testament Saints in the in the uh Hall of Fame chapter Hebrews 11 all those through everything they went through all the trials and the cruel mockings and everything they went through yet in all of that some saw the s receive cruel markings all those things yet receive not the promise the promise emphasize the promise oh Hallelujah the promise the promise is unto you the promise yes sir the same promise that he promised Abraham he knew that we had a Roy seed with a faith seed the promise of the father is the Holy Ghost Hallelujah they receive not the promise because they without us could not be come to maturity with things or an allegory a type for these are the two covenants the one from the Mount Si which gen the bondage which is a AAR so the law puts us in Bonnet the law puts up us in jail the law is the word of God In seed form but the grace of God is when the word is quickened in our hearts by the Holy Ghost see the letter kill it and many take this message as law many use it as law many uses it as the letter but the latter without the spirit without the Revelation without the quickening power is a law and it produces legalism and legalism produces Rebellion this is not a message of law this is not a message of dos and don'ts this is not a book of rules this is the Christ revealed this is the revelation of Jesus Christ heyen The Mighty God unveiled before us aren't you glad so the letter kill it but the spirit giveth life and brother Paul goes on to say and the Lord is thy Spirit i't you glad the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is I want to hear where the spirit of the Lord Lord is where the spirit of the Lord is when there's a time to shout there's a time to shout where the spirit of the Lord is when there's a time to praise there's a time to praise where the spirit of the Lord is when it's time to Bubble dance there's a time to Bubble dance but where the spirit of the Lord is there's a time to reverence amen but right now we're worshiping sir under the Feast of Tabernacle cuz what is it it's Christ in you you're the Tabernacle I said you God's Tabernacle don't you know your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost amen you're the Tabernacle look what's happening in Israel and brother Jack I'm really closing but look what's happening in Israel October 7th what happened there was a major attack on Israel that's ishma children that's right those are arrows that's ishma children coming against Israel right remember they I hadn't finished reading the scripture but remember elect does not persecute elect remember those that were born after the flesh always persecuted those that born after the spirit that's how you tell the difference we don't have to do anything if someone persecuting you we know what spirit is following him now we don't condemn them brother Jack and send them to hell but we know right at that moment the devil is using them because you a Son of God you sons and is a God so when youve been persecuted by different ones who gossiping against you speaking evil against you there's another Spirit using them there's a spirit of Esau there's a spirit of Cain see it was Cain that persecuted Abel it was Lucifer that came against Michael see it was Judas that came against Jesus I ain't away from this flesh either you got to watch this flashh there's a war within our members it it brings reasoning you know those those kings in In the Flesh see tast here smell touch in the spirit imagination con conscious reasoning affection and memory if they're not subject to the word it's going to be your enemy but once your soul your your the word is in your heart and that Spirit quick and word is in you it brings your spirit imagination reasoning conscious emotions and memory it brings that subject to the word and be used for God's glory and then it brings C tast his May touch this flesh subject to the word amen and we can you can rule your spirit and bring this body subject you're greater and mighter than the

Hallelujah sir Hallelujah I'm so thankful just remember you have Victory I'm I'm not going to finish all this but just remember you have victory am so thank God for all the trials now you don't say bring them on don't say bring them on but I want to let you know they're coming they're coming the Bible said is U for his much I'm reading this for as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind let the mind that was in Christ be also in you you going to have battles he didn't say it was going to be easy all of us now you know if if you don't if you're not having trials raise your hand if you're not having any trials raise your hand if the devil is fighting you you having trials raise your hand you see it shows you Sons and Daughters of God but and some of us have some hard trials they said one guy I heard a story one guy was complaining about his cross went to the angel complaining complaining complaining about his cross he just couldn't bear it was too too much so that and and it was it was a uh you know pretty big cross so he went he went the angel said okay go in there in the room and trade it pick up another cross you know and you and you know use it so they said the guy went in the room he found a little small cross over in the corner he picked it up it was heavier than the one he had but you see no one can bear your cross your cross your trials is designed by almighty God for you and for you only God for the foundation of the world knew what and he's not going to put no more on you than you can bear the devil may make you think you can't bear it and it gets hard at times but you keep on looking to Christ cuz arm yourself in the same mind for he that has suffered In the Flesh has ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to lust of men but the will of God so it's the word of God God that's why we have to pray that's why we have to pray and see they were astonished Mark 1026 they were astonished out of out of measure saying among them themselves who then can be saved Jesus looking upon them said with men it is impossible but with God for With God all things are possible then Peter began to say unto him Lord we've left all and have followed thee Lord we've left everything we gave up so many things to follow you and I I've give we've all given up things I've given up careers and all and I don't regret it oh yeah I wish I had the money sure that I gave up but I don't regret giving up on those things to receive Christ Christ is the greatest of all amen what profit is a man to gain the whole war and lose his own soul or what will a give in exchange for his soul we have to make the right Investments and you everyone who chosen Christ you've made the right investment because this world is falling apart Israel is is is about to Israel is waiting they're they're waiting to build a temple you you know about the red heers you all know they already got the red heers over there they already uh even um October also when one of the leaders of Rome he was told by the head of Rome you know who that is to give those vessels those vessels that were kept from the destroying of the temple in the past 2,000 years ago Rome kept those vessels and lied about it all through the years and finally decided to give those vessels back to Israel they say they on they're for you and we don't want to hold up your blessings but it's too late now they already cursed Babylon is already cursed be because they not only came against Abraham but his seed All Through the Ages 68 million over 68 million Christians killed through the Dark Ages and Rome is still in power so all those things are happening those are signs that total eclipse many rejoicing many spent thousands of dollars traveled all over to see that total eclipse but we know there's a major sign there's a sign of Darkness Isaiah said Darkness upon the Earth and grow Darkness upon the people that's religious Darkness but I want you to put a little light for this message Hallelujah and this light Hallelujah are you glad for this light Shalom little bride amen there's no time to be

recognized his name was in the book amen so rejoice in your trials you see that's so hard rejoice in your tribulations Peter said we left off Jesus answered and said verely I said unto you there is no man that haveth left house or Brethren or sisters and now Jesus said he that do the will of God the same as my mother my sisters and brothers remember they try to exalt Mary in the Book of Luke blessed are the womb that bear the and the P give the suck he said no you're not going to exalt Mary you're not going to exalt the Virgin Mary but blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep

time houses and Brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands look here with with what you see so we're right in line as a Son of God as a daughter of God with persecutions and in the world

today HS The Heirs of Promise uh certainly appreciate brother belon and just uh the Lord using him I was um listening and he was kind of reading some of the scriptures there talking about the trials and it uh he just was all over last couple weeks of services but I was thinking about brother brother Quinton when he came a few Wednesday nights ago and he was just sharing how uh we going to go from one trial to the next trial to the next trial and it was for warning us that this is this is just part of the Christian Journey it's not anything that we run from but actually something that we run to and and I'm going to tell you something this may sound a little strange but when you are when you've been a Christian for a while uh the trials don't seem to weigh you down the way they used to weigh you down you realize it's just part of the the journey right and that that's just part of what God promised and and and and there's nothing that the devil can do and another thing he he mentioned today Chief demons we talked about that on Wednesday night demons are real and we don't we don't we you know he mentioned earlier how the way that he defeated the devil every time a demon came cuz they it's a real Spirit you have to plead the blood of Jesus I I plead the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ that's where your Victory is but uh he was talking about how how Chief demons and I just thought to myself if if the devil has assigned a chief demon to you you must be a threat yes sir you must be a rough a rough character for the devil If he if he got the chief demon you got you you must be troubled to the devil's Kingdom amen but if the chief demon can't take you down you can they can forget about it church we walking in Victory going from one Victory to the next Victory to the next amen and we thank God for the character building process along the way brother Belton We Appreciate You amen this morning God richly richly bless you amen I want to just uh give space for him to get to the back so he can greet some of the people uh we'll have to start breaking things down and amen and and um uh try not to get to a spot cuz they be they be trying to rush us out of here
