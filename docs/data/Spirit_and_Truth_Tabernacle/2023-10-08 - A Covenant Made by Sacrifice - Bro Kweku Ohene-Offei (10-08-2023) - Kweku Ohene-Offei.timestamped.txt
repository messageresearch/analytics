[46:40] methods for your your giving amen uh
[46:45] before we pray over the
[46:48] offering um I wanted to just read a a
[46:52] scripture uh let's see here
[46:56] Psalms
[46:58] 122 Psalms
[47:01] 122 we'll read this amen and you don't
[47:05] have to stand just remain seated
[47:08] amen um you all have been keeping up
[47:11] with some of the news and I'm I'm not
[47:13] one that really follows too much of the
[47:15] news but yesterday I was being bombarded
[47:18] with videos and and and little messages
[47:21] and everything about what's happening in
[47:23] Israel and uh you know there was there's
[47:25] a tremendous attack there uh Rockets
[47:28] being fired everywhere and Israel is
[47:30] under attack and uh many of the um uh I
[47:35] would say some of the Arab Nations uh
[47:38] and and and if I can just go back all
[47:40] the way to Genesis these are the
[47:43] children of
[47:44] ishmail uh coming against the promised
[47:47] son Isaac and uh and it's always been a
[47:51] war always been problems amen from the
[47:54] day that Isaac was born has been
[47:56] problems and uh they uh both claim
[48:00] Abraham as their father and which they
[48:03] which they can lay claims on that right
[48:06] but it goes deeper than a uh a a a
[48:10] natural uh blood lineage it's a
[48:14] spiritual blood lineage amen that
[48:16] matters most and and and if I could and
[48:19] when I say spiritual I'm talking about
[48:20] even deeper than just Israel being the
[48:23] children of God uh brother brother
[48:26] uh um uh Simba came in close prayer last
[48:29] week and he says you know Lord we know
[48:31] Israel is your natural uh people but we
[48:35] are the spiritual Israel so every
[48:38] promise that was given to Natural Israel
[48:41] also is given to us as spiritual Israel
[48:44] blessed be the name of the Lord and we
[48:46] realize we have that but still natural
[48:49] Israel is still something that God is
[48:51] very concerned with and uh and and and
[48:53] I'll just tell you with uh you know I
[48:55] know that uh Netanyahu has made a
[48:58] comment he says y'all going to pay
[48:59] greatly uh for what y'all just did and
[49:03] uh and I believe the man and the reason
[49:05] I believe him because it's not just
[49:07] Israel fighting but God fights for
[49:10] Israel let me tell you another thing God
[49:12] fights for you yes
[49:15] sir Hallelujah somebody amen so so uh
[49:20] the one thing about it and no matter
[49:22] what they say on the news often times
[49:24] the news reporters are not looking at
[49:29] prophecy and when we're looking at
[49:31] prophecy it brings a peace and a calm
[49:34] because we know that there are certain
[49:35] things that must be done in
[49:38] Israel it's got to happen in Israel
[49:42] right uh the scripture there in
[49:44] Revelation uh 11 I believe it is it
[49:46] talks about uh the witnesses that's got
[49:50] to come forth right so we know that that
[49:52] Moses and Elijah has to come back to
[49:54] Israel you can't wipe Israel
[49:58] out you can't wipe them out if if
[50:00] there's a prophecy that two prophets
[50:02] going come up and and and and really
[50:05] they going to be so mad at the prophets
[50:08] because of the word that they
[50:10] speak my God the bodies be laying in the
[50:13] streets for three days they they think
[50:15] they got them finally got rid of Moses
[50:17] and Elijah and after three days he they
[50:19] come back to life
[50:21] again God is in control come on somebody
[50:25] yes sir amen whatever you going through
[50:27] this morning I'm here to let you know
[50:29] God is in
[50:31] [Music]
[50:33] control
[50:35] Hallelujah so just uh we we we know that
[50:38] there's promises that are left there to
[50:40] be fulfilled amen so we have peace that
[50:43] God's going to take care of everything
[50:44] we want to pray for the families that
[50:46] are suffering lost you know at this time
[50:49] uh but Israel as a nation there's still
[50:51] some more prophecy left for them amen so
[50:55] somehow some way I I don't know how but
[50:57] God going to be their protection and and
[50:59] I heard that they trying to call in all
[51:01] the Arab Nations they want uh everybody
[51:03] to come I don't care how many of
[51:07] them join forces you can't fight
[51:13] God your army is too too too small to
[51:16] fight
[51:18] God and y'all and y'all will see some
[51:20] miraculous things happen because God
[51:22] God's word cannot
[51:24] fail I'm telling you amen praise the
[51:28] Lord you know even this war with Ukraine
[51:31] that there was some Miracles one person
[51:33] had a huge Bomb by from this to that
[51:36] drop in the back of the yard and did not
[51:38] go
[51:41] off didn't go off big old bomb they just
[51:44] took pictures of it and put it on social
[51:46] media that's the hand of
[51:48] [Music]
[51:50] God so we going to hear some we're going
[51:52] to hear some Miracles come out of this
[51:55] and and and whether the US get involved
[51:56] or not they don't need the US they got
[52:00] [Music]
[52:02] God they got
[52:04] God we got God
[52:07] too let's read here out of Psalm
[52:10] 122 it says this I was
[52:14] glad when they said unto me let us go
[52:18] into the house of the
[52:19] Lord says our our foot our feet shall
[52:23] stand within thy gate oh
[52:26] Jerusalem Jerusalem is build it as a
[52:29] city that is compact together whe
[52:32] whether the tribes go up the tribes of
[52:35] the Lord unto the testimony of Israel to
[52:37] give thanks unto the name of the Lord
[52:41] for there are set
[52:44] Thrones of
[52:45] judgment the Thrones of the House of
[52:48] David set Thrones amen and here we have
[52:53] been given instruction pray for the
[52:57] Peace of
[52:58] Jerusalem listen this look at look at
[53:00] this they shall
[53:02] prosper that love thee peace be within
[53:06] thy walls and prosperity within thy
[53:10] palaces for my brethren and Compass
[53:14] companion sake I will now say peace be
[53:19] within thee we speak that over Israel
[53:22] this morning peace be with in thee
[53:26] because of the house of the Lord Our God
[53:29] I will seek thy
[53:32] good let's pray amen for Israel and what
[53:37] they're going through at this moment we
[53:39] trust the Lord
[53:41] to make a way for them amen in this
[53:44] midst of War father we come according to
[53:48] the word of the
[53:49] lord we speak
[53:52] peace within the land of Israel we know
[53:56] Lord that they are under attack and
[53:57] there are some families that are
[53:59] suffering loss some have been captured
[54:01] taken away from their loved ones and God
[54:03] we pray for their Divine protection we
[54:06] pray that you would watch over them we
[54:08] pray that you would keep them and Lord
[54:10] the leaders of that land have to respond
[54:12] to the attack so we pray that you would
[54:15] guide them that you would direct them
[54:17] Lord and father we realize that uh
[54:20] there's still scripture that is left to
[54:21] be fulfilled there in that in that land
[54:24] so God we know that uh your word will
[54:27] come to pass we know that there's
[54:29] nothing that can stop it but Lord there
[54:31] are people that are impacted that
[54:32] affected by uh what is going on so we
[54:35] pray for the people Lord Jesus we ask
[54:37] that you would intervene that you would
[54:39] be their comfort and Lord as a nation
[54:42] they have been a people that have
[54:43] suffered for a number of years so so
[54:45] many just have come against them just
[54:47] because of who they are and they don't
[54:49] realize uh they're coming against God
[54:51] they're not just coming against Israel
[54:53] they're coming against God because those
[54:55] those are your chosen people so father
[54:57] we uh we we we pray as the scriptures
[55:00] tell told us to do we pray for peace in
[55:04] Israel God let this war come to an end
[55:07] let the people return back to their
[55:09] homes those that are in bondage let them
[55:11] be set free God and Father we ask that
[55:13] you would move by your spirit we know
[55:15] and we expect God that there will be
[55:17] some testimonies that will come out of
[55:18] this situation it's always happened
[55:21] throughout history it's always great
[55:23] testimonies when you begin to fight on
[55:25] behalf of your people and Lord we know
[55:27] that you're not just fighting on behalf
[55:29] of natural Israel but you fight on

[1:03:29] love you and we bless you in Jesus
[1:03:30] Christ name we pray amen God bless
[1:03:34] you if you want we can take our Bible
[1:03:38] and
[1:03:39] just get into the business of the Lord
[1:03:41] Jesus Christ
[1:03:42] amen and we want to read a scripture if
[1:03:45] you want to show me the slides we bring
[1:03:46] the
[1:03:47] slides we want to speak on a little
[1:03:50] topic called a covenant God bless you
[1:03:52] instrumentalist music musicians amen
[1:03:55] engineers and everyone the Lord bless
[1:03:57] you mightily in every hearts and Minds
[1:03:59] here the Lord bless you so we want to
[1:04:01] speak on the covenant made by sacrifice
[1:04:03] so let's do script one scripture reading
[1:04:07] let's go to the second slide Psalm
[1:04:11] 50:5 it says Psalm 50:51 little
[1:04:16] scripture and then we go from
[1:04:19] there he said Gather my sins together
[1:04:22] unto me those that have made a covenant
[1:04:25] with me by
[1:04:27] sacrifice and I'll repeat Psalm 50 verse
[1:04:32] Psalm
[1:04:33] 50:5 gather my Saints together unto me
[1:04:37] those that have made a covenant with me
[1:04:40] by sacrifice the Lord add blessing to
[1:04:43] the reading of his word you may take
[1:04:44] your seed amen so let's just break H the
[1:04:49] the title a little bit covenant made by
[1:04:52] sacrifice this is where I pick this I've
[1:04:54] read his Psalms and and and probably
[1:04:56] many years the Lord showed me it just
[1:05:00] inspired my heart but I never thought I
[1:05:01] was going to preach a sermon on it right
[1:05:03] and Rec recently when Jack asked me to
[1:05:06] preach it be to bubble on my heart
[1:05:08] Covenant by sacrifice and I look at this
[1:05:11] scripture and became to I mean open up
[1:05:15] more things more things to me yes sir
[1:05:17] that God called some people who have
[1:05:20] made a covenant with the Lord amen by
[1:05:24] their own sacrifice to gather the people
[1:05:26] of the Lord right so it's going to be
[1:05:28] about a little bit about the ministry
[1:05:31] and talk about Ministry is not only 5old
[1:05:33] Ministry it's not only the prophet the
[1:05:36] apostles the teachers the Masters and
[1:05:39] and the evangelists but every son and
[1:05:42] daughter of God who have been called is
[1:05:45] a minister of the Lord being a brother
[1:05:48] or a sister you are a minister unto the
[1:05:50] Lord Jesus Christ if you can find your
[1:05:53] ministry
[1:05:54] if you can be silenced for the Lord to
[1:05:56] reveal to you what your ministry is amen
[1:05:59] Ministry is not just about preaching the
[1:06:01] gospel being behind pulpit and I mean
[1:06:04] making slide and preaching there are
[1:06:06] more people who can do presentation in
[1:06:08] the world more motivational speakers in
[1:06:10] the world than those of us here but we
[1:06:13] are talking about the business of the
[1:06:14] almighty God that spells and defines
[1:06:18] Eternal Destiny of his sons and
[1:06:20] daughters amen so now Covenant is in
[1:06:23] basic language just an agreement that
[1:06:25] you make with somebody or a contract
[1:06:28] that you make among parties among two or
[1:06:30] three people or companies or parties to
[1:06:33] fulfill something and under this
[1:06:35] Covenant it comes with certain
[1:06:38] requirement that each party has to
[1:06:40] fulfilled or a certain party has to
[1:06:42] fulfill to the other party to bring to
[1:06:43] make the Covenant keep the Covenant
[1:06:46] going amen and what is a sacrifice I
[1:06:50] think we understand sacrifice sacrifice
[1:06:52] is just something that is your right
[1:06:55] giving it to somebody to accomplish
[1:06:58] something that is to sacrifice something
[1:07:01] for you that something that pertains to
[1:07:02] you you can listen I can sacrifice my
[1:07:05] for brother Mark it's mine but out of
[1:07:08] love or out for a purpose for a need I
[1:07:10] give it to my brother so now this
[1:07:13] covenant made by sacrifice is God's men
[1:07:16] and women sacrificing thems number one
[1:07:20] their hearts their mind their gift
[1:07:24] yeah Talent right substances family amen
[1:07:28] to fulfill the purpose of God Amen so he
[1:07:31] said Gather my sins unto me those that
[1:07:34] have made Covenant with me by sacrifice
[1:07:37] yeah now the five-fold ministry we're
[1:07:39] going to look at certain sacrifices the
[1:07:41] fivefold ministry what is the purpose of
[1:07:42] this sacrifice let's go to I think the
[1:07:44] next two slides let's go to
[1:07:47] the exactly now God made this his
[1:07:50] ministers a flame of fire and the
[1:07:52] purpose of this sacrifice is to perfect
[1:07:54] the body of Christ and when I read that
[1:07:57] I thought it was funny how can imperfect
[1:07:59] people perfect other imperfect people
[1:08:03] right brother how can this be preachers
[1:08:06] as imperfect as you can think
[1:08:08] of how can they they can't even perfect
[1:08:11] themselves how are they going to perfect
[1:08:14] other people right am because you can't
[1:08:17] give what you don't have you can't give
[1:08:18] it to somebody if I have this
[1:08:21] handkerchief I can give it to brother
[1:08:22] brother Troy but if I don't have and I
[1:08:25] promise but a try I'm going to give you
[1:08:26] a handkerchief I don't have nothing to
[1:08:28] give with so this ministering is not
[1:08:32] about the ministers right but it's not
[1:08:34] about them themselves it's not about
[1:08:36] their strength and their capabilities
[1:08:39] it's not about their own Perfection but
[1:08:41] it's about somebody's Perfection through
[1:08:43] them to perfect others amen and we can
[1:08:47] go through the Bible that the great men
[1:08:49] and women the Lord used they had flaws
[1:08:52] and mistakes and Wrongs as you can
[1:08:55] imagine amen yes sir it's not about
[1:08:58] their
[1:08:59] qualification they didn't qualify to
[1:09:01] begin with but somebody who is greater
[1:09:04] than them called them and he gave them
[1:09:06] his Perfection and his qualification to
[1:09:10] do the job
[1:09:12] amen Glory Hallelujah to the Lord let's
[1:09:15] look at our Father Abraham the father of
[1:09:17] Faith Glory he's a great father of Faith
[1:09:21] he did wonderful things but he had a lot
[1:09:23] of wrongs as you can imagine exactly
[1:09:26] right he agreed with his wife right to
[1:09:30] to because of fear of death yeah to
[1:09:32] sacrifice his wife yeah so that he could
[1:09:34] live right and his wife Sarah agreed
[1:09:36] with him 100% they made that Covenant
[1:09:39] that's right and it looks like they
[1:09:40] rehear hey Sarah let we going to this is
[1:09:42] life and death but then the Lord has
[1:09:44] changed him from being 90 and and 100 to
[1:09:47] 18 and 25 so they were young and
[1:09:50] handsome and when Abraham is walking by
[1:09:53] he could see that the people the young
[1:09:54] men are looking at Sarah right and
[1:09:56] Abraham realized that no Sarah if they
[1:09:58] got to know you and my wife they're
[1:09:59] going to kill me wow so you are my
[1:10:02] sister this what we going to be and of
[1:10:04] course you are my sister because they
[1:10:05] were half sisters the same father only
[1:10:08] different mothers so we going to keep
[1:10:10] that part and let's rehearse it so
[1:10:12] Abraham said you know what stop calling
[1:10:13] me
[1:10:14] sweetheart just calling me brother Abe
[1:10:17] and I call you Sister
[1:10:18] Sarah just to make sure because you're
[1:10:20] going to end up I mean calling me
[1:10:22] sweetheart honey and they're going to
[1:10:24] know that oh he's your wife so let's
[1:10:26] rehearse it so brother brother Abe
[1:10:29] Sister
[1:10:30] Sarah and let's say Sarah came up with
[1:10:32] an idea say you know what Abram I
[1:10:34] remember H when you were young you know
[1:10:37] uh I I'm even going to tell the people
[1:10:39] that we are here we are immigrants we
[1:10:41] are here to make some money to send it
[1:10:42] to our parents we've got elderly parents
[1:10:44] back in our country wow out of the Chan
[1:10:47] so I'm going to I'm going to say that oh
[1:10:49] we want to this this weekend paycheck
[1:10:51] we're going to put it together send it
[1:10:53] to Dad and Mom they are old so we're
[1:10:54] going to make everything look fine and
[1:10:57] everything looked fine but it wasn't
[1:10:59] fine but God is gracious Abraham wasn't
[1:11:03] perfect but the Perfection of God
[1:11:05] prevented the king ABC from committing a
[1:11:10] adultery with Mrs Abraham right because
[1:11:13] God always keep his
[1:11:15] Covenant Glory Hallelujah to the Lord
[1:11:19] that's right but they were still perfect
[1:11:21] people right Abraham was father of faith
[1:11:24] right and it was when the Lord was
[1:11:25] building a covenant of
[1:11:27] of unconditional Covenant Abraham was
[1:11:30] the first Foundation that's exactly
[1:11:32] right look at the look look at this
[1:11:33] building the Four Corners Abraham was
[1:11:34] fifth on one corner right and the Bible
[1:11:37] said that without faith no one can
[1:11:39] please the
[1:11:40] Lord amen but Abraham was not perfect
[1:11:43] that's right and let's look at his Sarah
[1:11:45] his wife Sarah Sarah sacrificed his her
[1:11:48] own husband for her maid just to try to
[1:11:52] help God to fulfill a scripture wow wow
[1:11:55] look at the fla that she had but God and
[1:12:00] that's what we are having now we having
[1:12:02] the sons of ishma and Sons of Isaac
[1:12:05] fighting up to this day right because of
[1:12:08] Sarah's
[1:12:11] imperfection but even through the
[1:12:12] imperfection of Sarah the Lord brought
[1:12:15] the promised son just the same that's
[1:12:17] right Isaac came to the SE just the same
[1:12:19] amen and even the greatest promised son
[1:12:22] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:24] in you and I is manifesting just the
[1:12:27] same let's look at Jacob Jacob's wives H
[1:12:32] Leah Rachel I don't remember the two two
[1:12:35] other other wives but the MS yeah now
[1:12:38] when Jacob serve his father-in-law got
[1:12:41] his wives and now they parted because
[1:12:43] they had this agreement the wife stole
[1:12:46] their father's Idols that's right
[1:12:49] brother these are women that we name our
[1:12:51] children
[1:12:52] after
[1:12:55] brother did he steal money did he steal
[1:12:58] gold but they s
[1:13:00] idols and hit them on the hores backs
[1:13:03] and and and and and what is the name
[1:13:04] Laban he realized his idols were not
[1:13:06] there so he sent his men to chase Jacob
[1:13:10] cuz there was Riff between him and Jacob
[1:13:12] strong tension and conflict and when
[1:13:14] they got to where they are say hey your
[1:13:16] D Idols you think you guys have park it
[1:13:18] with you and guess what they said they
[1:13:20] said they had it hidden somewhere they
[1:13:22] said you know we are going through our
[1:13:24] ministration and we cannot go off from
[1:13:26] get off from the the horses right so
[1:13:28] they stole idols and to lie on top of it
[1:13:32] that's right but we call them Holy Women
[1:13:34] of God great women of God they are
[1:13:38] awesome we even name our daughters after
[1:13:40] them so that they can have their
[1:13:42] character these are the people that
[1:13:44] steal idols and tell lie on top of it
[1:13:48] how perfect they
[1:13:52] were brother that that is how God
[1:13:56] allowed them to how low is stop so that
[1:13:58] the Perfection of God could manifest in
[1:14:00] their
[1:14:03] imperfection a child of God is a child
[1:14:05] of
[1:14:06] God no matter where you go you can go to
[1:14:08] the deepest of hell even hell you see
[1:14:11] heaven in your
[1:14:13] hell Glory Hallelujah to the Lord
[1:14:18] Samson
[1:14:19] Samson filled the Lord miserably
[1:14:23] he sold out his
[1:14:25] Covenant at being being a levite and
[1:14:27] what is the what is the Covenant help me
[1:14:29] out nazare thank you for the sake of his
[1:14:32] flesh for women for theila but even in
[1:14:35] the last minute when he was at the at
[1:14:38] the awful end the Lord remembered him
[1:14:40] when he prayed the lowest e is said Lord
[1:14:44] his eyes were
[1:14:45] plugged he was a joker he was made to
[1:14:48] crack jokes to entertain the Philistines
[1:14:52] that he was ordained to defeat and to
[1:14:54] kill but even in his lowest a he prayed
[1:14:57] to the Lord said Lord I don't want to
[1:14:58] leave but once more let kill his
[1:15:02] enemies his hair was gone the seven LS
[1:15:05] that was the Covenant was gone the seven
[1:15:07] Church seven Church Ages were gone The
[1:15:10] Messengers were no longer there you
[1:15:12] couldn't see the the seven Messengers
[1:15:14] from Paul to Braham but it doesn't mean
[1:15:17] God is dead right God was still alive
[1:15:20] and God moved into the igh day the E day
[1:15:23] where there were no locks there was
[1:15:25] nothing that you could see but it was
[1:15:27] just the plain intelligence of God
[1:15:29] coming into manifestation and the Lord
[1:15:31] did the the unthinkable the Bible said
[1:15:33] he killed more enemies than all the
[1:15:36] enemies that he killed in his
[1:15:38] lifetime even in your lowest end even if
[1:15:42] you can't pray with your lips if you can
[1:15:44] bubble something in your heart the
[1:15:46] father that livs in your heart still
[1:15:48] hears you amen when you think you feel
[1:15:52] the Lord you f yourself you fill the
[1:15:54] church you have committed the UN
[1:15:56] unforgivable sin yes sir you just cry
[1:15:58] onto the Lord you realize it's not fire
[1:16:01] away from you he rescue you amen Glory
[1:16:05] Hallelujah to the
[1:16:06] Lord I don't know if I'm going to be
[1:16:08] able to follow this let's go when I was
[1:16:11] when I was I was thinking I didn't I
[1:16:14] didn't want to do Powerpoints this time
[1:16:16] I I just wanted to go just the unction
[1:16:18] of the Lord and I struggled not to do
[1:16:20] PowerPoint but I ended up doing
[1:16:22] PowerPoints all right because sometime
[1:16:23] it helps to bring certain things out
[1:16:26] slows you down and then you have to
[1:16:28] prove what you
[1:16:30] say so that amen so you don't get people
[1:16:33] in confusion anyway so let's go to uh
[1:16:35] let's read one of the scripture God made
[1:16:37] his ministers a flame of fire Hebrews 1
[1:16:40] 7 and8 all right let's if you can bring
[1:16:42] my slides Hebrews 1:7 and8 and of the
[1:16:45] angels He said who make who maketh his
[1:16:48] Angel spirits and his ministers a flame
[1:16:50] of fire now this ministers with full of
[1:16:54] weaknesses the Lord made them a flame of
[1:16:56] fire a consuming fire he put something
[1:16:59] in them not their human flesh and the
[1:17:01] mistakes but something the Lord did
[1:17:03] before the foundation of the world and
[1:17:05] those gifts are not just skills that you
[1:17:08] learn is something God predestinated in
[1:17:11] you Glory
[1:17:21] Hallelujah those gifts are not something
[1:17:23] that is taught to you by your pastor by
[1:17:26] the ministers but something the Lord put
[1:17:28] in you before the foundation of the
[1:17:30] world am and because the Lord put that
[1:17:32] thing in you the Lord jealously guides
[1:17:35] and gu that gift he guides you and gu
[1:17:39] those gift until becomes manifestation
[1:17:41] so that it's for you to gather his
[1:17:43] people to bring Glory unto his name to
[1:17:46] make imperfect people perfect because he
[1:17:49] makes you perfect by his Perfection and
[1:17:52] through that he sends you to go out and
[1:17:54] made the people perfect and it comes
[1:17:56] with a lot of sacrifices but then verse
[1:17:58] 8 but unto the son he said thy Throne oh
[1:18:01] God is forever and ever a skor of
[1:18:03] righteousness is the skor of thy kingdom
[1:18:06] now the son is the one who put the
[1:18:08] flaming fire into his ministers to be
[1:18:11] able to burn and destroy the enemy just
[1:18:14] like Samson was ordained to destroy the
[1:18:16] enemies of God we are not supposed to
[1:18:19] kill people in the physical but we are
[1:18:21] supposed to kill the demon
[1:18:23] Satan who is living in the heart of
[1:18:25] people Amen to free the people from the
[1:18:28] things of the world let's go to the next
[1:18:32] slide now ministers is for Perfection of
[1:18:35] the Saints Ephesians 4:10 to13 he that
[1:18:38] descended is the same also that ascended
[1:18:40] up for far above all Heavens that he
[1:18:43] might fill all things 11 and he gave
[1:18:46] some Apostles some Prophet some
[1:18:48] evangelist some pastors and teachers for
[1:18:51] the perfecting of the Saints for the
[1:18:52] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:18:55] the body of Christ so we all come in the
[1:18:58] unity of faith of the faith of the
[1:19:00] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:19:02] perfect man onto the measure of the
[1:19:04] stature of the fullness of Christ so the
[1:19:06] ministry is to perfect the body of
[1:19:09] Christ whereas they themselves are not
[1:19:11] perfect that's right where they have
[1:19:13] their own problems that's right and I'm
[1:19:15] going to enumerate some of the things
[1:19:16] that ministers go through that you might
[1:19:18] not see if you not close to them the
[1:19:20] family may know people close to them may
[1:19:21] know but you might not see
[1:19:23] but the Lord has buil them and ordained
[1:19:25] them in a way that they can put their
[1:19:26] problem aside they could be sick but
[1:19:29] they could put their sickness aside and
[1:19:31] pray for you to be
[1:19:34] healed I had I had a minister friend
[1:19:37] that he said I had a certain disease and
[1:19:40] my daughter has the same thing when my
[1:19:42] daughter comes I pray for her instantly
[1:19:44] she's healed but for my own I'll pray
[1:19:47] and cry and fast and pray and cry and
[1:19:50] fast to the Lord will do it wow because
[1:19:53] the gift is for other people and it's
[1:19:56] God his gift for you wow but because of
[1:19:58] the training he allow you to go through
[1:20:00] certain things to bring the attribute
[1:20:02] out of you so he can allow the sickness
[1:20:05] to be on you for a Time whereas you can
[1:20:07] pray for people instantly they are
[1:20:08] getting healed right there are certain
[1:20:11] times that people ask me to pray for
[1:20:12] them I didn't even pray and they tell me
[1:20:15] thank you brother for your prayers it's
[1:20:17] already done so I was going to check the
[1:20:19] text message and pray and it's already
[1:20:21] the Lord has already done for them
[1:20:22] because of the gift in you your thought
[1:20:24] before even you prayed the thought of
[1:20:26] God in your heart the flame of fire
[1:20:30] that's the situation before you even
[1:20:31] prayed I had a testimony in Texas where
[1:20:34] a brother called me said brother I have
[1:20:35] a testimony for you I said sure my wife
[1:20:38] was sick and we didn't have insurance so
[1:20:40] we couldn't go to hospital it got
[1:20:42] serious and we're wondering what we
[1:20:44] could do because if you go to the H you
[1:20:46] go to you go to see the doctor and you
[1:20:48] don't have insurance they're going to
[1:20:49] write you and send you some bills you
[1:20:51] cannot imagine yeah so my wife said that
[1:20:54] after a couple of days she was she just
[1:20:55] couldn't feel fine but she had a dream
[1:20:58] and in a dream you were praying for her
[1:21:00] and I said said if brother was praying
[1:21:02] for you praise God the Lord has heal you
[1:21:04] already he said brother that was it the
[1:21:06] sickness was gone wow but I wasn't
[1:21:08] physically pray for me I didn't even
[1:21:10] know his wife was sick but I do pray for
[1:21:12] them when I go to the W to pray because
[1:21:15] the Lord has given you a life form to
[1:21:17] help the people of God your flesh could
[1:21:20] be sitting here but the gift in you
[1:21:22] could be somewhere doing something
[1:21:23] somewhere because a portion of
[1:21:25] omnipotent is in you my sister a portion
[1:21:28] is in you my brother so your flesh could
[1:21:30] be weak but the the flaming fire in you
[1:21:34] could be working in even another
[1:21:37] continent that is the Perfection the
[1:21:39] Lord has made you regardless of your
[1:21:41] imperfection In the Flesh and if you can
[1:21:43] look out to that flaming fire the
[1:21:45] Perfection of God your flesh will
[1:21:49] succumb to the Perfection of Jesus
[1:21:51] Christ Glory to the Lord Almighty amen
[1:21:55] amen the Lord is good let's go to uh the
[1:21:58] next
[1:21:59] slide 1 Kings
[1:22:02] 1911-13 and I'm going to I'm going to
[1:22:04] hear I'll stand up on this scripture for
[1:22:06] a while how to the to the extent that
[1:22:08] the men of God sacrific for the ministry
[1:22:12] this was
[1:22:13] Elijah he was being chased by Jezebel so
[1:22:16] Elijah had to run away this is a
[1:22:17] powerful prophet of God who spoke and
[1:22:21] dotin he could speak fire into existence
[1:22:25] but then there was a time that he was
[1:22:26] his life was in the line and he has to
[1:22:28] go to the cave to run away for his life
[1:22:30] and he got to extend that he said Lord
[1:22:32] I'm not even better than my fathers I'm
[1:22:34] not better than the prophet of old why
[1:22:36] don't you take my life I want to just
[1:22:37] come home but the Lord said no it's not
[1:22:40] time yet son there's more work for you
[1:22:41] to do so verse verse 7 he said and the
[1:22:44] angel of the Lord came again the second
[1:22:46] time and touch him and said arise and
[1:22:48] eat because the journey is too great for
[1:22:50] thee and he arose and did eat and drank
[1:22:52] and drink and went in the strength of
[1:22:54] that meat 40 days and 40 nights unto
[1:22:57] harb the Mount of God and he came
[1:22:59] thither unto a cave loded there and
[1:23:01] behold the word of the Lord came to him
[1:23:03] and he said unto him what doest thou
[1:23:06] here Elijah and he said I've have been
[1:23:07] very jealous for the Lord the Lord God
[1:23:09] of hosts for the children of Israel have
[1:23:11] forsaken th thy Covenant thrown down thy
[1:23:14] altars and slain thy prophets with the
[1:23:16] sword and I even I only am left and they
[1:23:19] seek my life to take it away 11 and he
[1:23:23] said go forth and stand upon the mount
[1:23:25] before the Lord and behold now this is
[1:23:27] the Lord coming to pass by and the Lord
[1:23:29] passed by and a greet and strong wind
[1:23:31] rent the mountains and break in pieces
[1:23:33] the racks before the Lord but the Lord
[1:23:36] was not in the wind and after the wind
[1:23:38] and earthquake but the Lord was not in
[1:23:40] the earthquake and after the earthquake
[1:23:42] a fire but the Lord was not in the fire
[1:23:45] and after the fire a still small
[1:23:49] voice and it was so when Elijah heard it
[1:23:52] he r wrapped his face in his mantle and
[1:23:54] went out and stood in the entring in of
[1:23:56] the cave and behold there came a voice
[1:23:59] unto him and said what thou what doest
[1:24:01] thou here now there were four element of
[1:24:04] the
[1:24:04] earth there were wind there were fire
[1:24:09] and there was
[1:24:10] earthquake but those elements do not
[1:24:13] bring
[1:24:14] Perfection your flesh your spirit your
[1:24:18] own soul doesn't bring Perfection What
[1:24:20] bring Perfection is the fourth element
[1:24:23] right the spoken word of
[1:24:25] God the voice of God is what make your
[1:24:28] purpose on this life
[1:24:30] [Music]
[1:24:32] defined you can have everything on this
[1:24:35] planet without Christ in you you have
[1:24:38] not even begun your
[1:24:40] life you might own businesses you might
[1:24:43] have multibillion dollar companies but
[1:24:46] with that Christ on the
[1:24:47] inside you don't even know why you are
[1:24:50] here so Elijah
[1:24:53] was made in such a way that he has to
[1:24:55] hear the voice of God before he could
[1:24:58] act right and God made his ministers and
[1:25:01] remember when I say ministers not only
[1:25:02] five-fold ministers all his sons and
[1:25:05] daughters that you have to hear the
[1:25:06] voice of God in your heart before you
[1:25:09] take any step or action you have to have
[1:25:12] the conviction of the Holy Ghost in your
[1:25:13] heart to be a to be able to execute What
[1:25:16] the Lord Has ordained you to execute
[1:25:19] amen so Elijah didn't depend on the for
[1:25:22] three elements the fire the mountain the
[1:25:25] shakings the earthquake but when the
[1:25:27] voice came the voice was the Capstone
[1:25:30] the voice was the ultimate the voice was
[1:25:32] the control tower and if you can pray
[1:25:34] and hear the words of God before we take
[1:25:36] actions you will not be
[1:25:38] defeated that's why we need to pray and
[1:25:41] consult the Lord consult the word before
[1:25:44] you take action so that when you take
[1:25:47] action You Know that heaven and earth is
[1:25:49] behind your
[1:25:50] action glory to the Lord
[1:25:59] glory to the Lord hallelujah
[1:26:01] yes let me give you my testimony here
[1:26:05] okay let's go to the next slide we had a
[1:26:07] ministers meeting in Cancun August 23rd
[1:26:11] 2023 I just had my graduation May the
[1:26:14] 12th of this year and I graduate from
[1:26:17] pharmacy school doctor of pharmacy
[1:26:19] program and uh right after graduation
[1:26:21] there was a email
[1:26:22] that there was a job looking for you
[1:26:24] don't even have to register you don't
[1:26:25] have to be a registered pharmacist there
[1:26:27] was a job in from one alomi looking for
[1:26:30] two intern two we call it Pharmacy
[1:26:33] graduate and I was the only one from
[1:26:36] from from Texas I'm a t Texan resident
[1:26:39] so there was a job in a Austin Texas and
[1:26:42] this a six-digit
[1:26:44] uh uh job yes sir and you don't have to
[1:26:48] you don't have to be registered you
[1:26:49] don't have to write your board exams
[1:26:51] just be ready to to go to Texas and I
[1:26:54] was going to preach in in Cancun Mexico
[1:26:57] now there were things of God that you
[1:27:00] don't you don't take decisions hly you
[1:27:03] don't take random decision because of
[1:27:05] manitary inment that's right but your
[1:27:08] decision is based on the still Small
[1:27:11] Voice so this email keep poing even my
[1:27:13] professors know that I'm the only one
[1:27:14] from Texas before graduation you had a
[1:27:16] meeting they do have meetings with the
[1:27:18] student to see what are the best
[1:27:20] Prospect and things for you because when
[1:27:22] get job it put the school in good shape
[1:27:25] so cuz they take thousands of dollars
[1:27:27] from you so they want to make sure that
[1:27:29] you got a job to pay your give it back
[1:27:32] Uncle Sam is waiting for
[1:27:34] you if I should give a testimony not a
[1:27:37] testimony but you know we are in a
[1:27:39] society where it's everything is driven
[1:27:41] by money I wasn't I'll come back to this
[1:27:43] but let me give say this in person I was
[1:27:46] in one of the hospital doing my rotation
[1:27:47] and and the doctors were communicating
[1:27:49] with the doctors and said even these
[1:27:51] days we don't go to where our our
[1:27:53] passion and our talents are because you
[1:27:56] got to pay your student loan he said
[1:27:58] most doctors are going to cardio cardio
[1:28:01] instead of going said I really love to
[1:28:02] be a family doctor another one said I
[1:28:04] want to be a pediatrician wow but it
[1:28:07] hasn't PID that much family doctor
[1:28:08] doesn't give you much money but if you
[1:28:10] go to heart diseases diabetes so they've
[1:28:14] already gone to school for 8 years he's
[1:28:16] done intern for four three years and
[1:28:19] he's going to do H what do you call a
[1:28:21] fellowship another 3 to 4 years and you
[1:28:24] expect him to come and take peanuts no
[1:28:26] he has to take money because after that
[1:28:29] cause your loan will be about th000
[1:28:31] sorry $1 million between 500 to 1
[1:28:33] million so now instead of doing what
[1:28:36] they they were is in their heart to do
[1:28:38] to be a family doctor you has to go and
[1:28:40] specialize in diabetes or in in heart
[1:28:42] diseases to be able to get some dead
[1:28:45] president and you know the dead
[1:28:46] president the dollar bill the Lincoln
[1:28:48] and the
[1:28:50] Washington so that's what the capital
[1:28:53] capitalist American that's to it you
[1:28:55] know that's a it's the money money
[1:28:57] industry Big farma Medicine everything
[1:29:01] even doctors are going on strike and
[1:29:03] healthcare workare because the people at
[1:29:05] the top are getting their money but the
[1:29:07] nurses and the doctors are they work
[1:29:08] them like horses but they don't get
[1:29:10] enough so they strike they're going on
[1:29:12] strike H for GM and business are workers
[1:29:16] are going on strike because of money you
[1:29:18] know cuz the societ is run on money but
[1:29:21] now it comes to God and God's Sons and
[1:29:24] Daughters of course we need the money to
[1:29:26] preach the gospel your clothes were
[1:29:28] bought by money right you have to go
[1:29:30] from here go to restaurant and pay money
[1:29:32] to to feed your family but you don't put
[1:29:35] money first
[1:29:37] right in the Pyramid of life we put
[1:29:40] Christ first amen amen family saken amen
[1:29:44] and then money and whatever job third at
[1:29:47] the base but in society we sweet things
[1:29:49] around manifest is not is gone God is
[1:29:53] not in the picture so Things Fall Apart
[1:29:56] Nothing is holding in our
[1:29:59] society but we the Sons and Daughters of
[1:30:01] God we don't take decision just because
[1:30:03] of mandatary
[1:30:05] incitement incitement but we take
[1:30:07] decision based on the word of God so
[1:30:08] this email keep popping up for Texas and
[1:30:11] they want two pharmacist not registered
[1:30:15] and I'm really really connected in Texas
[1:30:17] I've lived there longest in the US about
[1:30:19] 6 seven years I've Got Friends even my
[1:30:21] high school friends I've got a lot of
[1:30:23] Believers and this is just pack your bag
[1:30:26] and luggages and go and just start
[1:30:28] making money where's brother hos where
[1:30:30] is he he's not here I think he's taking
[1:30:32] the baby but used to tease me and sister
[1:30:33] Amanda when we were going to school he
[1:30:35] said but qu and my wife they are
[1:30:38] professional student that's what they
[1:30:42] do so M andu they just love to St that's
[1:30:45] what they do s about school you know so
[1:30:47] Pap that was the time for me to make
[1:30:49] money but in the things of the Lord you
[1:30:52] put God first you see listen to The
[1:30:54] Still Small Voice where God is leading
[1:30:57] you if the Lord is leading you praise
[1:30:59] God but you have to hear that anchor
[1:31:01] where the Lord is leading you you have
[1:31:04] that still Small Voice that resonate in
[1:31:05] your heart before you take action that's
[1:31:08] right there was a king called I think
[1:31:10] Hezekiah and King Ahab they were all
[1:31:12] together we going for a war and 400
[1:31:14] Prophet prophesied that King oh King
[1:31:17] Ahab go you're going to be victorious
[1:31:19] they even show the spirit of of the Lord
[1:31:21] came on them anointing came on them and
[1:31:24] they show how Hezekiah was going to win
[1:31:26] the victory but then something didn't
[1:31:29] resonate in the heart of Hezekiah how
[1:31:31] Ahab was going to win said is there no
[1:31:32] other Prophet is there no any other
[1:31:35] Prophet because he wanted to have that
[1:31:37] sh the Lord he wanted to hear that still
[1:31:39] Small Voice he wanted to be con
[1:31:42] convinced and when you get convinced you
[1:31:44] get concerned because if you are not
[1:31:46] convinced you become robotic right robot
[1:31:49] don't don't have to be convinced they
[1:31:50] have been programmed to pack this tool
[1:31:52] and put it here but we are not robot of
[1:31:55] men and women we are not robot to money
[1:31:58] but we are robot to Jesus Christ he's
[1:32:00] the one who has ordained our lives so we
[1:32:03] had this meeting and I'll probably pause
[1:32:05] here and give some more more testim not
[1:32:06] testimony surrounding this meeting let's
[1:32:08] go to the next one these are the
[1:32:09] meetings H we had the ministers about 40
[1:32:11] of them from different part of Mexico
[1:32:14] some came from drove from 40 40
[1:32:17] hours all way to come for this meeting
[1:32:20] some came with a youth
[1:32:22] the youth were playing drums they were
[1:32:24] they were singing singing group about 20
[1:32:26] 30 people and they are not well to do
[1:32:29] here but the purpose of God there's
[1:32:32] something in their heart the love of
[1:32:34] Christ in their heart and I realize the
[1:32:36] train they you different they just get
[1:32:38] them to get involved in the things of
[1:32:41] God I saw young sister teenagers playing
[1:32:43] drums in two of the cities and a young
[1:32:46] boy about let me see about 8 years old
[1:32:49] he's got this it's like a metal with a
[1:32:51] com metalic comb and they were playing
[1:32:53] my brother you you just see the
[1:32:55] anointing of the Lord and one brother
[1:32:57] said my daughters they are into music so
[1:32:59] they high school they have a program
[1:33:00] where they specialize in music they
[1:33:02] don't partake in other things of of of
[1:33:04] high school they just stay with things
[1:33:05] that they can use it in the house of the
[1:33:07] Lord and so if you you the young people
[1:33:09] can give your heart to the Lord God will
[1:33:11] use you you don't have to be 20 years
[1:33:13] old to begin your life with the
[1:33:15] Lord if you are not too young for the
[1:33:17] devil to use you you are not too young
[1:33:19] for God to use you say William Braham if
[1:33:23] you want to be baptized tell your pastor
[1:33:25] to baptize you if you see something a
[1:33:27] gift in you tell your parents tell your
[1:33:29] minister tell your pastor so that that
[1:33:32] gift could be used and harnessed to the
[1:33:34] glory of the Lord don't give your voice
[1:33:37] to singing rock and roll don't give your
[1:33:40] body to singing to dancing music that
[1:33:42] that that will bring SP of Hell on you
[1:33:45] but rather give your heart to the Lord
[1:33:47] Jesus Christ seek for the Holy Ghost
[1:33:49] baptism am know your purpose we need to
[1:33:52] teach the children the fear of the
[1:33:54] Lord that is the most important thing
[1:33:56] the children when they begin to learn
[1:33:58] the fear of the Lord they begin to learn
[1:34:00] cause and effect if you do this this is
[1:34:03] the result if you don't do this this is
[1:34:05] the result they make wise decision so we
[1:34:08] need to teach children how to fear the
[1:34:10] lord what the fear of the Lord It's the
[1:34:12] love of God not that God is going to
[1:34:13] kill you you have to run away but the
[1:34:15] fear of the Lord is you loving the Lord
[1:34:17] in your own little way that you purpose
[1:34:19] in your heart that God put me here on
[1:34:21] this purpose on this Earth for a purpose
[1:34:24] and I'm here to find out though I don't
[1:34:26] know my purpose on this Earth but I want
[1:34:28] to find out what God made me for you
[1:34:31] don't remember how when you were in your
[1:34:32] mother's womb you didn't remember when
[1:34:34] you were in your daddy's laings but
[1:34:36] somewhere you remember that you begin to
[1:34:38] grow you realize your environment you
[1:34:40] look at the atmosphere begin to get
[1:34:42] cognizance with your family but God has
[1:34:44] got Eternal purpose in for your life
[1:34:46] that you have to recognize from by
[1:34:49] Prayer by the word Yeah by through the
[1:34:52] ministry to know what God God has
[1:34:54] ordained your life for and when you know
[1:34:56] what God has put your life here on this
[1:34:58] for you already want the victory cuz
[1:35:01] nothing in this world will be able to
[1:35:02] take you away from that purpose but if
[1:35:04] you don't have
[1:35:06] nothing to live for the word will give
[1:35:09] you something to live
[1:35:12] for pop music rap music rock and roll
[1:35:18] lesbianism gays and different things and
[1:35:21] all the programs of the world technology
[1:35:24] will consume your life and at the when
[1:35:26] you are when when it's about for you
[1:35:28] time for you to live this world you look
[1:35:30] back and you see that your life was
[1:35:33] wasted your life was a
[1:35:35] trash because you didn't fulfill the
[1:35:37] purpose you were here for so while
[1:35:40] you've been blessed to be in a church to
[1:35:42] have parents who are who are Christians
[1:35:44] Holy Ghost fill men and women to have
[1:35:46] ministers that pre the word of God to
[1:35:48] you take advantage and make sure that
[1:35:51] you know what you are here for because
[1:35:53] when you are here in this atmosphere
[1:35:54] even if you are not a Christian the Holy
[1:35:56] Ghost will blow around you you can wear
[1:35:59] long skirt to the to the to the ground
[1:36:01] you can have decent hair cut as a young
[1:36:03] boy you can wear cover yourself but when

[1:36:11] where the battle begins when you are
[1:36:13] home even if you don't have the Holy
[1:36:14] Ghost the Holy Ghost of your parents
[1:36:16] covers you their Covenant and their
[1:36:19] token covers you right so it's easy for
[1:36:21] you to have that atmosphere but your

[1:43:33] you know they had each other's back even
[1:43:35] when they were telling
[1:43:37] lies so Abraham and Sarah really love
[1:43:40] each other regardless of the tri they
[1:43:41] went through and so Sarah died and and
[1:43:44] they were in a Strange Land the king
[1:43:45] said Abraham you've been blessed you

[1:43:59] Silvers and things like that I want
[1:44:01] something that will cost me I don't want
[1:44:03] to have a place for for bury my wife
[1:44:05] which doesn't cost me I'll pay for it

[1:44:13] other's back you know they plan to tell
[1:44:15] a lie to defend Abraham and when sah
[1:44:17] made the wrong choice give he made to
[1:44:19] Abraham Abraham supported
[1:44:22] Sarah they had their each other's back
[1:44:25] through thick and thin even in their

[1:45:05] him but deep within him he know that his
[1:45:07] son he started stealing coins when he
[1:45:10] was young he know that the sons did what
[1:45:13] he did by a mother's heart no way he's
[1:45:18] the best
[1:45:19] son

[1:46:33] still went for
[1:46:35] BBA he filed wul but the Lord still had
[1:46:39] his back he said David is a man after my
[1:46:41] own heart
[1:46:43] how the Lord's choice is not based on
[1:46:47] condition his love is unconditional love
[1:46:52] no matter how far you stoop he still
[1:46:54] calls you my
[1:46:57] daughter nothing can't break the
[1:46:59] Covenant of
[1:47:00] God you break your Covenant and fail him
[1:47:03] but he will never break his
[1:47:07] Covenant because he knew you before the

[1:48:49] Hallelujah
[1:48:52] yeah it's difficult to follow the
[1:48:54] PowerPoint
[1:48:56] let's let's try just the same let's go
[1:48:58] to the next slide I just want to just
[1:49:01] throw this PowerPoint behind and just
[1:49:03] move but let's look at Abraham and I'm
[1:49:06] just giving you a foot for thought was
[1:49:07] he a
[1:49:08] triplet let's find out from the Bible
[1:49:11] let's read Genesis chapter 11 verse
[1:49:14] let's say verse 20 to 20 27 and let's
[1:49:18] see verse 20 said and Ru lived two 2 and
[1:49:21] 30 years and begat serug and Ru lived
[1:49:26] after he begat Ser 27 years and begat
[1:49:29] sons and daughters so the first born
[1:49:31] they tell the age that they were let's
[1:49:33] say brother Troy live 27 years and had
[1:49:36] his first born and then because they
[1:49:38] didn't mention all the names of the
[1:49:39] children the rest of them he live 200
[1:49:42] years and then he begat many sons and
[1:49:44] daughters so now they started naming the
[1:49:47] generation of Abraham and then they got
[1:49:49] to said say Ser suuk live 30 years and
[1:49:52] begat nah and ser live after he begat N
[1:49:56] 200 years and beg sons and daughters and
[1:49:58] the 24 and N be live 9 and 20 years
[1:50:02] which is 29 years and beg Tera Tera is
[1:50:05] Abraham's father right and N lived after
[1:50:07] he beg Tera and 119 years and beg Sons
[1:50:10] and Daughters 26 I want you to take a
[1:50:13] notice of this and Tera lived 70 years
[1:50:17] and beat Abraham nah and Har
[1:50:21] and I'll show you about why this
[1:50:23] scripture open my eyes to why Abraham
[1:50:26] was so connected to lot even though lot
[1:50:29] not didn't disappoint him took his
[1:50:32] blessings and Abraham suffered but
[1:50:35] there's something about in the heart of
[1:50:37] Abraham concerning Lord CU Lord was his
[1:50:39] brother who passed
[1:50:41] away triplet they were
[1:50:44] triplet n lived H sorry Tara lived 70
[1:50:48] years and the the firstborn there were
[1:50:50] three of them Abraham Abraham PR the
[1:50:53] Lord changed his name to Abraham he was
[1:50:55] called Abraham and the Lord added ham
[1:50:58] which is God's Own Name to him Abraham
[1:51:01] nah and
[1:51:02] Haram born when the father was the same
[1:51:05] year there were not three women no only
[1:51:08] one woman Abraham was a triplet
[1:51:13] sir and
[1:51:14] now and
[1:51:17] now these are the generations of Terror
[1:51:23] and
[1:51:23] Abraham now this are the Gen of Tera
[1:51:26] Tera begat Abraham n and haran and Haram
[1:51:29] be called lot if you read further wow
[1:51:31] Haram passed away and that was his
[1:51:34] brother's son so Abraham took him
[1:51:37] remember he took his father they
[1:51:38] traveled and his father passed and then
[1:51:42] Abraham Sarah and then lot and we know
[1:51:45] the ri raft that were between Lord's
[1:51:46] servant and Abraham's
[1:51:48] servant and Abraham because of love he
[1:51:51] said you are my son you are my nephew
[1:51:53] his father his brother had died one of
[1:51:55] the triplet died so Abraham took him as
[1:51:57] as a son and said whatever you want you
[1:52:00] choose first yeah and he looked with his
[1:52:02] eyes and saw where there were Wells and
[1:52:05] rivers and and and and grass for his c c
[1:52:09] cattles and and sheep and things like
[1:52:10] that and Abraham had to suffer
[1:52:12] consequences for the love for the
[1:52:15] Covenant Abraham forsook his
[1:52:18] Blessing and now lot was in trouble he
[1:52:21] live in Sodom and Gomorrah where he live
[1:52:23] happened to be Sodom and
[1:52:25] gomorra full of lesbianism gay and
[1:52:28] whatever whatever view just like we have
[1:52:30] in in in this modern world and then
[1:52:33] there was a time that Lord was in
[1:52:34] trouble he was kidnapped ab and Abraham
[1:52:38] if it were you and I what are you going
[1:52:40] to do you're going to well he's going
[1:52:42] pay for a price for what he did to me
[1:52:45] you're going to take a cup of tea and
[1:52:46] drink and call your wife you remember
[1:52:49] Lord what he did toah look at what is
[1:52:51] happened to me I've heard he's been
[1:52:52] kidnapped let him pay the price of what
[1:52:55] he did to me but not Abraham the
[1:52:58] bloodline this is his brother who passed
[1:53:01] away son and Abraham could not I mean
[1:53:05] see his nephew being killed so Abraham
[1:53:09] who wasn't a soldier he took weapons
[1:53:12] that he had took his servant armed
[1:53:14] himself and they were kidna they kidna
[1:53:16] lot I think seven other kings or so
[1:53:19] Abraham went and fought and killed those
[1:53:22] enemies and rescued lot and and the
[1:53:24] kings of Sodom and Gomorrah and brought
[1:53:26] them back and the Bible said that
[1:53:30] madc who was Christ Jesus before he
[1:53:32] became flesh Saed Abraham with wine and
[1:53:36] and and he serve Abraham with wine is
[1:53:38] that right yes for what he did there are
[1:53:42] certain choices that not everything that
[1:53:44] you do God is going to anoint you amen
[1:53:46] God is going to put in your heart so
[1:53:48] strongly yeah yeah but you going to make
[1:53:51] a
[1:53:52] sacrifice for the Lord am a sacrifice of
[1:53:56] your character to the Lord as a Young
[1:53:58] Brother as a young sister coming up all
[1:54:01] the school friends are doing what they
[1:54:02] do some of them break their virginity
[1:54:05] when they are 12 years old and they are
[1:54:06] proud of it their parents are proud of
[1:54:08] it certain parents allow their children
[1:54:10] at the age of 12 to go and live with
[1:54:11] their
[1:54:12] boyfriend that is how the society is you
[1:54:16] have you can have a choice to do that if
[1:54:18] you want to choose to
[1:54:20] but you can make a choice for the Lord
[1:54:22] Jesus Christ that you are a vessel
[1:54:24] created for the image of God you under
[1:54:27] God's covenant and you don't allow
[1:54:29] nobody to touch you until the Lord
[1:54:31] himself give you gives you your husband
[1:54:32] or your wife am you can make that choice
[1:54:36] for the Lord amen just like
[1:54:39] Abraham it cost him money to bury his
[1:54:43] wife let's look at
[1:54:45] Moses
[1:54:47] Moses was next to being a the Pharaoh
[1:54:50] that's we have a proverb in my country
[1:54:52] that when they they selling power you
[1:54:54] can sell your even your mom and by the
[1:54:57] power and when you get the power you can
[1:54:59] redeem your mother Park and then get all
[1:55:01] the power so Abraham could have made a
[1:55:04] choice he was next in line to become a
[1:55:06] pharaoh so it was easy for abrah to
[1:55:08] become a pharaoh pardon sorry thank you
[1:55:11] Moses becoming a pharaoh and pardon all
[1:55:13] Israel they didn't they didn't even need
[1:55:16] pardon he could free them that's the
[1:55:18] right way to use right from the bondage
[1:55:20] of being slaves and burden without being
[1:55:23] paid and then sign a decree you know
[1:55:27] sign a document a
[1:55:29] law so that this are free they've work
[1:55:32] all years he could have make Aeron his
[1:55:34] older brother his secretary of state you
[1:55:37] could have made Joshua and calb senators
[1:55:40] and governors and promote Israel because
[1:55:43] he's the Pharaoh Pharaoh is the supreme
[1:55:46] leader of of of of Egypt what he says
[1:55:49] nobody can debate his word right brother
[1:55:52] if he says that's it it's like that says
[1:55:55] the Lord that says Pharaoh wow that was
[1:55:58] easy way to abrah sorry Moses could have
[1:56:01] gone but Abraham was in the higher
[1:56:04] oracles the
[1:56:06] temples the pyramid they had pyramids in
[1:56:09] those time and looking at this people
[1:56:11] that building const building houses and
[1:56:14] being whipped and something in him yeah
[1:56:17] said I want to connect with this people
[1:56:19] yeah instead of becoming a pharaoh yeah
[1:56:22] Moses was a doctor he was a lawyer they
[1:56:24] didn't specialize they didn't break into
[1:56:26] part you learn all become Paul was a
[1:56:28] lawyer doctor he knew the medicine in
[1:56:30] Egypt but Moses sacrificed being a
[1:56:34] pharaoh to become one of them that God
[1:56:37] there still Small Voice could use
[1:56:43] him you're going to make some sacrifices
[1:56:46] if you want to hear that small voice if
[1:56:48] you want the Lord to walk closely with
[1:56:50] you you're going to sacrifice a chunk of
[1:56:52] your life your time your world to serve
[1:56:56] the
[1:56:58] Lord glory to the

[2:00:40] that's amen and that is what the Lord
[2:00:42] does the wisdom amen hallelujah glory to
[2:00:46] our Lord am and in the Lord training is
[2:00:48] is his ministers he took them through
[2:00:51] some military training just like in the
[2:00:53] military when you become a soldier no
[2:00:56] matter your job skill they call it
[2:00:58] military occupation skills no matter
[2:01:00] whatever you do you can be an it if you
[2:01:02] go to basic training you're going to be

[2:01:25] practice you got to take a gun and fight
[2:01:28] and they train you in a way that you you

[2:01:38] civilian and being a soldier they train
[2:01:41] you to be bipolar on quotes how to
[2:01:44] switch from being a civilian and to be

[2:01:51] rescue people you have to be ragged you
[2:01:54] have to be a thick skin to be able to do

[2:05:22] Daughters of
[2:05:23] God God is also trained before you
[2:05:25] become a minister God put you through
[2:05:27] certain ragged training like the eagle
[2:05:30] just to make you put you bring you to
[2:05:32] where he want you to be the status that
[2:05:34] you can work and then he can release you
[2:05:36] brother Jack go pre the gospel even when
[2:05:38] you don't want to preach brother TR
[2:05:40] brother Mark go pre the gospel so he
[2:05:43] take he turn you through thick and thin
[2:05:45] things that you don't even understand
[2:05:46] why am I going through this right from
[2:05:47] your childhood
[2:05:49] God is molding you to be a
[2:05:51] leader in the house of God a mother who
[2:05:54] is a leader in the house taking care of
[2:05:56] the children and he take you through
[2:05:58] certain training he give you the right
[2:06:00] parents or even not parents and you go
[2:06:03] through different things in life to M
[2:06:05] you to the exact character the Lord want
[2:06:07] you just like he did Sarah H sorry
[2:06:11] Esther Esther lost both parents when she
[2:06:14] was just a child so that she could learn
[2:06:17] not to depend on parents
[2:06:19] she learned and mod how to pray because
[2:06:21] she was going to be a queen first lady
[2:06:23] that's the easy part first ladies get
[2:06:25] all the fans and all the celebrities
[2:06:28] that's not a part but she was going to
[2:06:30] be a savior to Israel am and being a
[2:06:34] savior she wasn't going to fight with
[2:06:35] weapons but she's going to go on her
[2:06:37] knees and pray am to God Of Heaven am
[2:06:41] that things that were not normal you
[2:06:43] can't go to the king without being asked
[2:06:44] to go to the King right it can cost your
[2:06:47] life but through through prayer and and
[2:06:50] the word of the Lord and the Holy Ghost
[2:06:52] H Esther could go before the king when
[2:06:55] she was not being she's not being called
[2:06:56] to appear before the king so the Lord
[2:06:59] take you through different scenarios you
[2:07:01] might not understand your life you might
[2:07:03] not understand why you've been given a
[2:07:05] boss who suppresses you you might not
[2:07:08] understand why you've given parent that
[2:07:09] are very strict God is molding you for a
[2:07:12] purpose amen I had a brother friend
[2:07:15] who's a minister he's actually a pastor
[2:07:17] when he was in college he said bro my
[2:07:19] mom buys everything for
[2:07:21] me even my underwears he said my mom
[2:07:24] doesn't let me go shopping he said my
[2:07:27] sister can do their own sh but not me
[2:07:29] wow because the mother a Pentecostal
[2:07:32] mother saw a gift in his son a Methodist
[2:07:35] and he didn't want him to anything to to
[2:07:37] mess himself with women and things like
[2:07:38] that so the mom was protected of him
[2:07:40] when he was even in college when he was
[2:07:42] a
[2:07:43] preacher until the right time that the
[2:07:45] Lord allow him so there are certain
[2:07:47] things you you won't understand why your
[2:07:49] parents treat you the way they treat you
[2:07:51] if youve got Godly Parents because they
[2:07:53] see something in you you don't see
[2:07:55] that's right you just a young young kid
[2:07:57] right a child right all you know is
[2:07:59] being a child but the Lord the parents
[2:08:02] have seen something in you that's right
[2:08:04] that they know God is going to use this
[2:08:05] my daughter and we need to keep our eyes
[2:08:07] on her they don't allow you to mingle
[2:08:09] with certain friends they don't allow
[2:08:11] you to go out in certain times they keep
[2:08:13] you in the house most of the time do CH
[2:08:16] wash and do certain things because
[2:08:18] you're going to be a mother you're going
[2:08:20] to be a Minister's Wife you're going to
[2:08:22] be a warrior in the house of the Lord

[2:08:27] pray to bring Jehovah God into
[2:08:29] existence oh my Glory

[2:11:51] then continue and to buy pizza for my
[2:11:54] brother you never know what people
[2:11:56] sacrifice for the gospel I remember
[2:11:58] before the trip I preach here on August
[2:12:00] the 20th Sunday normally when I preach I
[2:12:03] don't give too much sleep to my eyes so
[2:12:05] I preach and the next day morning I was
[2:12:07] going to travel so I went back home and
[2:12:09] just did some sleeping slept good for a
[2:12:11] couple hours when I woke up everything
[2:12:15] things were turning like very good
[2:12:16] things were spinning around me hm what's
[2:12:18] going on here I just prayed and normally
[2:12:22] what it happens if you drop your blood
[2:12:23] pressure so certain medication we give
[2:12:25] it to elderly people we tell them not to
[2:12:27] rise up slowly from your bed sit down on
[2:12:29] your bed take your time and Rise slowly
[2:12:31] because if you rise quickly your
[2:12:33] pressure will drop and you can faint so
[2:12:35] I was thinking did I drop my blood
[2:12:37] pressure I don't take medication so
[2:12:38] what's going on here so I just drove to
[2:12:41] Bellington just to make sure everything
[2:12:42] is good everything was good the next
[2:12:44] morning when I woke up my stomach oh my
[2:12:47] goodness

[2:13:04] when they around maybe 10:00 I'll let
[2:13:06] the pastor know that today I couldn't
[2:13:08] make it cuz it looks like I'm breaking
[2:13:10] my immune system my body is reacting
[2:13:12] pushing back on me I changed my ticket
[2:13:15] from Monday to Tuesday next day
[2:13:17] everything went through when I finished

[2:13:28] 21st third time I said hm what's going
[2:13:31] on here I went to pray I said Lord if
[2:13:33] you want me to go I'm feeling horrible I
[2:13:36] can't be on a go on flight in this
[2:13:38] situation cuz my whole body is like

[2:13:45] the flight and go God bless you brother
[2:13:46] Quinton he gave me a ride
[2:13:49] and I went preach everything I didn't
[2:13:51] have any problem with the stomach but
[2:13:54] then very good things were spinning and
[2:13:56] I remember one one of the trip to we
[2:13:58] preach in canc we fin the meetings went
[2:13:59] to another city called chetumal chetumal
[2:14:03] we preach I preach in the morning Sunday
[2:14:06] and I was having runny
[2:14:08] nose so bad so one one the pastor from
[2:14:11] Colombia he got a he bring me a toilet
[2:14:15] papers tissue papers to clean my know
[2:14:18] and preaching in the right in the Pulpit
[2:14:22] preach for I don't know 45 minutes and
[2:14:25] give 15 testimonies and pray for the
[2:14:29] sick a brother with postrate cancer pray
[2:14:31] for him a sister death in one year pray

[2:14:36] major situation pray for about 10 people
[2:14:39] whil me myself my nose was runny nose
[2:14:43] they bring tissue paper to me clean up
[2:14:45] and then keep preaching keep going and
[2:14:48] the pastor asked me to he want
[2:14:49] testimonies so I had 15 testimonies line
[2:14:51] up what the Lord did in my little
[2:14:53] Ministry for for the church Preach and
[2:14:56] then Sing sang One song and finished so
[2:14:59] the night we're going to preach in
[2:15:01] another country called bis they call it
[2:15:03] bisi bis was a country that was a small
[2:15:05] country close to Mexico colonized by the
[2:15:07] British so they speak English they speak
[2:15:09] Creo I think Asian language they speak
[2:15:12] Spanish of course and they speak another
[2:15:14] language from Africa mixed with other
[2:15:16] languages so one brother who speak
[2:15:18] English was going to go with them so the
[2:15:19] pastor from K said brother brotheru I
[2:15:22] think you are not feeling well so he
[2:15:25] wasn't going to go because his wife and
[2:15:26] the children didn't have passport so he
[2:15:28] had to stay behind they had another
[2:15:29] translator for for the pastor from
[2:15:31] Brussels so I said brother you pray for
[2:15:33] me he prayed and the brother the brother
[2:15:35] from brazel want me to be with him so I
[2:15:37] said he's not going to feel comfortable
[2:15:38] going to another country you know
[2:15:40] without you without me so you just pray
[2:15:42] for me he prayed and went to bise
[2:15:44] crossed the border to another country so
[2:15:46] the pastor tells me he preach in his
[2:15:48] church and then cross the border 1 hour
[2:15:50] to go and preach in another country
[2:15:52] every Sunday and comes back and he's got
[2:15:55] another mission in in in the city Co
[2:15:58] toor City close to Cancun so we went to
[2:16:01] B preach and there it doesn't matter how
[2:16:05] if you preach even if it's midnight you
[2:16:06] still have to eat so they invited us to
[2:16:09] a home eat Fellowship for like an hour
[2:16:13] before they let us lose to come back to
[2:16:14] Mexico and cross the border about 2:
[2:16:17] a.m. in the night cross the border back
[2:16:19] to chetumal and then the mission was
[2:16:22] more or less completed and went to rest
[2:16:26] when I came back to me the long so short
[2:16:28] I came
[2:16:29] back I be to have this uh
[2:16:33] vericle and I pray Lord I just when I
[2:16:36] sleep and I wake up on the right side
[2:16:38] things were spinning everything spinning
[2:16:41] so I was in the house most of the time
[2:16:44] and I prayed to the Lord this is so
[2:16:46] uncomfortable I can't function don't the
[2:16:47] only thing is I could drive without
[2:16:49] having that experience and I went to buy
[2:16:51] certain medication it even made it worse
[2:16:54] so I said Lord i' I'm Healed I don't
[2:16:57] even care about the symptoms amen I
[2:17:00] pronounce my healing so I just went on
[2:17:03] and one day I woke up and I fell in my
[2:17:05] spirit I'm healed amen and that was it
[2:17:16] amen
[2:17:19] there was choices that you make for the
[2:17:22] gospel that has got Eternal rewards and
[2:17:25] I want to go quickly let's come to the
[2:17:27] slide the choice that but Abraham made
[2:17:30] yes in his ministry yes an eternal
[2:17:33] reward so I want to read something
[2:17:34] quickly let's come back to I just go
[2:17:37] through let me see I'll just keep
[2:17:39] through them and you can read
[2:17:43] them right so now this was brother
[2:17:46] Braham one brother is called brother
[2:17:50] Victor Leo Leo French Victor Leo went to
[2:17:54] a Israel Jerusalem right and then he
[2:17:57] went to happened to be in the tomb where
[2:17:59] Jesus was laid he took one of the stones
[2:18:01] or something like that he made a rck and
[2:18:04] he made a klings as a gift soor for B
[2:18:07] Braham and there was a red stripe like
[2:18:09] the cross in it and he just when he was
[2:18:13] there baham came on his mind and said
[2:18:14] why is it so hard for Abraham certain
[2:18:16] Ministry is hard for for the people
[2:18:18] because of the nature of the ministry
[2:18:20] because you are delivering Gathering
[2:18:21] people the devil is not going to give
[2:18:23] them to that okay take take this because
[2:18:25] he's using the Sons and Daughters of God
[2:18:27] for his purpose so you have it's a fight
[2:18:31] and the enemy will fight you so that you
[2:18:33] won't be able to deliver the people he
[2:18:34] want to rule the people so this brother
[2:18:37] made this cing for brother Braham and
[2:18:39] there was a a prophecy on brother Braham
[2:18:41] this is what I want to read okay married
[2:18:43] and divorce 65 paragraph 48 then Danny
[2:18:46] what he does for har he makes little
[2:18:47] Stones he walk out of to where the cross
[2:18:50] had been put where they said the cross
[2:18:53] set in the Rock no one was there so he
[2:18:55] broke off a little piece of rack and put
[2:18:57] it in his pocket for a souvenir come
[2:18:59] home and made a pair of celings out of
[2:19:01] it and strangely when he made them they
[2:19:03] look to be blasting and right through
[2:19:04] each of them in continuity runs straight
[2:19:07] narrow path right through both of them
[2:19:10] now that might be just someone else
[2:19:12] might not notice it but to me it's
[2:19:14] complimentary to the things that I
[2:19:15] believe I believe that everything has a
[2:19:17] meaning right and I believe most of you
[2:19:19] the same thing sometime I'll be there
[2:19:20] and I I look at the clock is 111 yeah 11
[2:19:24] is number of stand as a true disciple of
[2:19:27] God certain little things God vindicate
[2:19:29] to you a daughter of God that you are
[2:19:32] his daughter he's in your life you don't
[2:19:34] have to be afraid so let let's let's go
[2:19:37] to the next
[2:19:40] slide so there was a prophecy okay let's
[2:19:43] go let's go I skip some of them go to
[2:19:45] the next
[2:19:46] slide
[2:19:49] okay I'll read this one he said look at
[2:19:51] the brother was giv a comment said God
[2:19:53] bless you Abraham he said I hope this
[2:19:55] doesn't sound sacr relgious but to my
[2:19:57] way of see that message could be 23rd
[2:20:00] chapter of Revelation and when he said
[2:20:02] that he started speaking in tongues and
[2:20:04] I was say that Abraham's message all of
[2:20:07] them is 23rd chapter there should be
[2:20:10] 23rd chapter of Revelation it's part of
[2:20:12] the word of God but it was only written
[2:20:14] in symbols and revealed at the right
[2:20:17] time
[2:20:18] so the brother spoke in Tong when he
[2:20:22] hadn't okay let's go forward okay a boy
[2:20:25] who had never ever heard of such thing a
[2:20:27] bapti by denomination he turned white
[2:20:29] and he look at me he didn't know what to
[2:20:31] do let me see how many was there at that
[2:20:34] time there were three Witnesses I'm just
[2:20:36] skipping the 133 and and and there was a
[2:20:39] great French woman sitting down there
[2:20:41] she said she raised up and said why said
[2:20:44] why that don't need any interpretation
[2:20:46] that was purely French the boy said I
[2:20:48] don't know one word of French and she
[2:20:50] wrote down what he said let's go to next
[2:20:55] one let's go to the next slide
[2:21:05] please right I standing in the Gap you
[2:21:09] know and then there was a man sitting on
[2:21:10] the corner he said that's correct I've
[2:21:12] got wrot it down said in French way back
[2:21:15] a blond okay let me skip them he said he
[2:21:17] was The Interpreter for the UN for
[2:21:19] French and this man was over here was
[2:21:22] Victor Leo of the an anv church out
[2:21:25] there and he wrote it down and I've got
[2:21:27] a interpretation of it next slide please
[2:21:30] is said listen to this if I can read I
[2:21:32] so the man was testifying I Victor Leu
[2:21:35] I'm a full blooded Frenchman born again
[2:21:38] Christian F of the Holy Ghost my address
[2:21:40] is 809 North King Road Los Angeles 46 I
[2:21:43] attended B bethl Temple Pastor an Vic
[2:21:47] Pastor a true translation that I
[2:21:49] Proclaim of Prophecy said over Abraham
[2:21:52] given by Danny Henry in French Fe
[2:21:55] February the 11 1961 at the four gospel
[2:21:57] businessman's breakfast a true
[2:21:59] translation of the prophecy let's go
[2:22:02] further now it's going to say what it
[2:22:04] said now here is what it said because th
[2:22:08] because thou H has chosen the Narrow
[2:22:09] Path this was God speaking FR sorry
[2:22:12] speaking through Victor Leu concerning B
[2:22:16] Braham so now this is what he said
[2:22:18] because thou has chosen the Narrow Path
[2:22:20] the harder way thou has chosen in your
[2:22:23] thou has walked in your own choosing now
[2:22:26] I can see that Moses had to make his
[2:22:29] choice to see thou has picked the
[2:22:32] precise and correct way correct decision
[2:22:35] and it is my
[2:22:37] way underlined my way the Holy Spirit
[2:22:41] speaking back because of this momentous
[2:22:43] decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits
[2:22:46] you
[2:22:47] await thee what a glorious decision now
[2:22:51] listen what a glorious decision thou
[2:22:53] Hast made this in itself is that which
[2:22:57] will make and come to pass the
[2:22:59] tremendous Victor in the love
[2:23:03] divine so baham made a choice God didn't
[2:23:06] choose for him he made a choice to serve
[2:23:10] the Lord in that capacity am he was
[2:23:13] given a bill of I think he was given a
[2:23:15] an envelope of th $1 million
[2:23:18] he needed
[2:23:19] money but the men of God and women of
[2:23:22] God if things that don't resonate here
[2:23:25] the them what them right it doesn't
[2:23:29] click it doesn't Flash the red
[2:23:32] light
[2:23:33] no he didn't accept it they wanted to
[2:23:37] buy him a jet plane to fly in
[2:23:41] it he said no cuz the people that I deal
[2:23:44] with they are po people with cancer
[2:23:46] breast canc cancer tumor on their faces
[2:23:49] if I come so in so way up here I won't
[2:23:52] be able to connect with them so I have
[2:23:54] to be in a certain way to resonate with
[2:23:56] them that's why the Lord Jesus CHR the
[2:23:58] king of glory came all the way down to
[2:24:00] become a human being to resonate with
[2:24:03] you and
[2:24:04] I so brah was a very one of the I'll
[2:24:07] look at two examples in my life the Lord
[2:24:09] Jesus Christ himself and William Braham
[2:24:12] I look at their sincerity sometime you
[2:24:14] don't have to see a person even they
[2:24:16] writing what they said you can go into
[2:24:18] their life form and see their
[2:24:20] nature never spoke evil about or Robert
[2:24:23] and Billy Graham there was a time
[2:24:25] somebody was say Abraham you are so easy
[2:24:27] to reach out to H we can invite you even
[2:24:29] if for Home Services but brother Ora and
[2:24:31] brother Billy bil Billy Billy Graham and
[2:24:34] Ora Robert you have to have certain
[2:24:36] numbers certain amount of money certain
[2:24:37] offering certain maybe 5,000 people to
[2:24:40] be able to invite them I said no brother
[2:24:42] you don't understand but AA has got a
[2:24:44] worldwide program it's got television
[2:24:47] is God employees to pay for he has to
[2:24:49] pay for these people so if if you at
[2:24:52] home 50 people he's going to
[2:24:54] lose he runs University and TV program
[2:24:58] radio program with he had a small office
[2:25:01] and a
[2:25:02] taiter and that's it so with him is more
[2:25:06] on the supernatural
[2:25:08] side that is that's why brother oral and
[2:25:11] brother Billy Graham cannot attend to 50
[2:25:13] people but for me the Lord made me that
[2:25:15] way that even if you invite me for Home
[2:25:18] Service two people 10 people he'll be
[2:25:20] able to come and pray for you come and
[2:25:22] have fellowship with you and God made
[2:25:25] you who you are I'm not saying money is
[2:25:26] bad no we need
[2:25:28] money God will bless you what are you
[2:25:30] doing for for for your business because
[2:25:32] we need money to run the gospel and I
[2:25:34] can tell you my
[2:25:36] testimony I have to deep into my pocket
[2:25:38] buy my ticket go preach I don't go
[2:25:40] preach to people that that was brother
[2:25:42] take this one for Ticket No I preach and
[2:25:44] even sometime have to the dollars that
[2:25:45] is left give it to to some of the
[2:25:47] Brethren to help them in certain things
[2:25:49] that they do and that's what the Lord
[2:25:51] has called you for amen amen and
[2:25:55] somebody to the Lord has called him for

[2:27:23] make certain decisions especially the
[2:27:25] young people you are the Most Blessed
[2:27:28] Most Blessed because you are in the in
[2:27:30] the time that you can make the right
[2:27:31] decision now you don't have to go
[2:27:33] through certain mistakes amen right in
[2:27:36] one of my the trip one of the Cities I
[2:27:37] met a sister and the sister Fellowship
[2:27:40] has singing and the way she conducted
[2:27:42] herself was
[2:27:44] different and so after the service the
[2:27:46] pastor gave a testimony about this
[2:27:47] sister she sink and you could see the
[2:27:50] anointing is way different and how she
[2:27:52] conduct herself seven Ministries and the
[2:27:55] Pastor said this sister was a lesbian
[2:27:59] for a very long time she was I think
[2:28:02] about 52 up to 55 but most of her time
[2:28:05] she was a lesbian she's coming from
[2:28:07] Catholic origin she didn't have anything
[2:28:10] but one day I preached I had I think
[2:28:12] evangelism in town and she heard the
[2:28:15] message and the voice she gave her her
[2:28:18] to the
[2:28:19] Lord and you could see the the love for
[2:28:23] God that she has and the service she
[2:28:26] even bought a h what the name some
[2:28:29] fruits for me and the pastor from
[2:28:31] Brussels that I have some here the way
[2:28:34] she serve because her sins that were
[2:28:36] many has been forgiven and so her love
[2:28:39] for the Lord it just like Mary
[2:28:43] Magdalene who nobody people wrote her
[2:28:45] off but when he met Jesus he forgive all
[2:28:48] of his sins am and when Jesus was was
[2:28:50] crucified she was the one that took
[2:28:53] ointment cuz she didn't want the the
[2:28:55] body of his Lord to get in her mind she
[2:28:57] thought it was going to rat and they had
[2:28:59] medicine and Bing fluid but because of
[2:29:02] what the Lord has done for her the
[2:29:04] service of Mary Magdalene was way
[2:29:05] different What the Lord Has Done For You
[2:29:07] what has the Lord done for you and what
[2:29:09] can we render we cannot pay him
[2:29:12] back but the simple thing to give your
[2:29:14] heart to the Lord Amen to dress in a way
[2:29:18] that will portray the glory of the Lord
[2:29:20] amen God is not asking you to die
[2:29:23] physically but let the old man die and
[2:29:26] let Christ live in your heart so that
[2:29:29] you will show his glory and he will
[2:29:31] bless you shall we pray Our Father we

[2:32:22] leaving to go somewhere uh if we would
[2:32:26] really really uh take that person in
[2:32:29] prayer you just don't realize how the

[2:32:35] do something for the Lord is it's not
[2:32:37] always just um uh fun and games but uh
[2:32:40] there are things that you go through in
[2:32:42] your body and um and you know it's one
[2:32:45] thing being being sick here in the US
[2:32:48] it's a whole another thing being sick in
[2:32:51] a third world country and uh you can't
[2:32:53] get to hospitals you know I remember
[2:32:56] just even being in in in um uh Alaska I
[2:32:59] I thought that was the us but when I got
[2:33:02] up there it's Villages and uh when I got

[2:33:08] no Walmart no McDonald's no no Burger
[2:33:11] King no KFC nothing no hospital nothing
[2:33:17] you know I mean and if you want to go to
[2:33:18] the hospital you had to catch a flight
[2:33:21] when when the plane was available catch
[2:33:23] a flight an hour to get to the hospital
[2:33:25] by that time you could be gone and they
[2:33:28] offered me fresh well I said no no no no

[2:33:45] forgot they brushing my teeth and I um
[2:33:50] got a little that water to wash my mouth
[2:33:52] out in the
[2:33:56] sink if y'all don't know nothing about

[2:34:01] things happen right and you stuck here
[2:34:04] and like you got to preach and people
[2:34:06] expecting you to preach and your body
[2:34:07] doing something different we need your
[2:34:10] prayers we need your prayers this is
[2:34:13] this this was just a wonderful sermon I
[2:34:15] believe uh all of us were fed here today
[2:34:18] amen by the word of God and and this was
[2:34:21] just I mean I I I I thank God every
[2:34:24] situation was spoke to here today even
[2:34:27] even down to you know him not taking
[2:34:30] that job I think we just heard on the
[2:34:32] tape on Friday night that everything
[2:34:34] that is presented to you is not of God
[2:34:37] even though you might succeed in it
[2:34:39] don't mean success don't mean it's of
[2:34:42] God it don't mean it's of God the Rich
[2:34:44] Young Ruler succeeded but it was not of
[2:34:46] God right so you got to be very very
[2:34:48] care is this really a decision that's
[2:34:50] going to bring glory and honor to God
[2:34:54] cuz my life is in his hands amen amen if
[2:34:58] it don't bring honor to God just let it
[2:35:00] go we used to have a song that we used
[2:35:01] to sing years ago only what you do
[2:35:04] Christ
[2:35:06] amen for Christ will last only what you
[2:35:10] do for him will be counted in the end on
[2:35:16] only what you do for
[2:35:19] Christ will last let's
[2:35:23] pray father we thank you for your word
[2:35:25] that has come to our hearts here today
[2:35:28] Lord we've been touched and amen just uh
[2:35:32] our hearts have been spoken to I believe
[2:35:34] every every heart in here we can draw
[2:35:37] closer to you through the word that
[2:35:38] we've heard Lord I I know your servant
[2:35:42] um God he he just spoke what was in his
[2:35:45] heart heart and in doing so he
[2:35:48] ministered to many needs here
[2:35:50] today uh God not just those that are
[2:35:53] here but many even that are listening
[2:35:55] online I I think of conversations that
[2:35:58] I've had this this past week Lord and
[2:36:00] how this brother just walked right into
[2:36:03] those conversations God I know that it's
[2:36:05] you amen speaking to us so we ask that
[2:36:08] you would just bless amen our brother re
[2:36:11] re renew him and God may we leave here
[2:36:14] meditating and thinking on the things we
[2:36:16] have heard Lord uh it's not by accident
[2:36:19] it's not by chance that that this would
[2:36:21] come forth to us so Lord help us to hear
[2:36:23] your voice and be sensitive to the voice
[2:36:25] of God Amen to the spirit of God that
[2:36:28] would speak to us and let us find
[2:36:29] ourselves uh in alignment and in
[2:36:32] obedience with the word of God we want
[2:36:34] you to get the glory we want you to get
[2:36:35] the honor we want you to get the praise
[2:36:37] out of everything we do and we realize
[2:36:39] sometimes we have to make some
[2:36:40] tremendous
[2:36:41] sacrifices but oh God in the midst of
[2:36:44] that we we'll never forsake forsake
[2:36:46] houses we never forsake uh families we
[2:36:48] never forsake uh jobs we never forsake
[2:36:51] any of these things and not be rewarded
[2:36:52] by you later so Lord help us to realize
[2:36:54] you're in control sometimes you put
[2:36:56] these things before us to see what
[2:36:58] decision we'll make you just want to see

[2:37:02] children of Israel you wanted to see
