[11:51] Absolutely no one like our God.
[11:56] You know, even he's so holy that the
[11:59] angels have to cover their faces.
[12:02] When prophets come into his presence,
[12:04] they fall down like dead men. Can you
[12:08] imagine how holy and righteous our God
[12:10] is? You can't bring into his presence,
[12:14] you'll die immediately. But aren't you
[12:17] so grateful for the blood of the Lord
[12:18] Jesus Christ.
[12:20] Amen. That we can approach our God this
[12:23] morning and worship him and call him
[12:24] holy because that's who he is.
[12:28] Ah, I'm so grateful for what our Lord
[12:29] has done. I I'm I'm reminded of when the
[12:33] prophet was in there criticizing the old
[12:35] lady at the table and God called him
[12:38] said, "Come over here.
[12:42] I want you to look at this. He showed
[12:44] him his sins going up towards God, but
[12:48] there was a a red cloud covering the
[12:51] earth blocking his sins. And Jesus
[12:54] Christ standing there and those sins
[12:56] coming hitting him. He's shaking. And
[12:59] he's feeling the pain of our sins that
[13:01] was supposed to hit God. And God would
[13:02] have destroyed brother Brandham
[13:04] immediately.
[13:06] He had a different perspective.
[13:11] You are the very righteousness of God.
[13:17] You are his holiness.
[13:20] Sometimes you have to change the way
[13:21] that you view yourself.
[13:25] You got to see how God sees you. You are
[13:27] washed in the blood. There's no sin on
[13:29] you.
[13:31] Sometimes sinners come into your
[13:32] presence and they don't realize and
[13:34] they're just sitting there cursing and
[13:36] all of this. God could strike him down,
[13:40] but you're there.
[13:43] You are the blood of Jesus Christ in his
[13:45] hour.
[13:48] God richly bless you. I don't know why
[13:51] that came on my heart, but Praise the
[13:54] Lord. View yourself like God views you.
[13:58] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's sing this
[14:01] little song together. I sort of
[14:05] I don't know. Praise the Lord. Let's
[14:07] move on. I don't know what you come to
[14:10] do.

[32:13] need of is in you, Father. We're so
[32:16] grateful for your grace and mercy. We
[32:17] pray, Father God, that you'll continue
[32:19] to bless Brother Jack and and and the
[32:22] the family and brother Quinton over in
[32:24] Ghana and the services there, Lord.

[32:28] Father, we pray when you're done there
[32:29] with them, Lord, you'll bring them
[32:31] safely back to us, Lord, granting
[32:32] traveling mercies to them. Oh, blessing
[32:35] them as they went forth and as they come
[32:37] back in, Lord Jesus. We pray for our
[32:39] brothers and sisters, Brother Simba and
[32:40] Sister Ruth and the family that flew out
[32:43] to Texas. Lord, bring them back safely.
[32:45] Lord, all of our brothers and sisters
[32:47] who are traveling, Lord, be with them,
[32:48] Lord. Brother Tim, Lord God, and and and
[32:51] Sister Rahab, Lord, we pray for them.
[32:53] Thank you for bringing them, Lord, to to
[32:55] come and fellowship with them with us

[32:59] blessing upon them for their efforts and
[33:01] their travels. Lord, be with them, Lord,
[33:04] oh Father, and to have your way in this
[33:05] service. Father, as we bring forth our
[33:07] giving to you, Lord, we pray, Almighty
[33:09] God, we do it according to your word.
[33:11] And from our hearts, Lord, as you have
[33:14] given to us freely, we give back to you.
[33:16] Thank you so much for blessing each of
[33:18] us, Lord Jesus, that we can give unto
[33:20] you. We have done our portion and you
[33:23] have promises associated, Lord, with
[33:25] this our giving. So, Father, give to
[33:28] your people 100fold for will bless
[33:29] everything they put their hands to. May
[33:31] it prosper, Lord. We pray in the blessed
[33:33] name of Jesus Christ. We also ask,
[33:35] Father, that you would touch Brother
[33:37] Jerry, Lord, as he prepares his heart to
[33:39] bring the message this morning. Help him
[33:41] to get himself out of the way, Lord.
[33:43] Speak through him and to him, Lord
[33:45] Jesus. We need a word from you this
[33:47] morning. You have a willing servant,
[33:49] Lord. We'll be careful to hear
[33:51] everything you would say to us and
[33:53] believe. We love you, Father. Commit all
[33:55] things to your care in Jesus Christ's
[33:57] name. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[34:00] Brother Maris, will you come? Amen. Give
[34:02] us a special this morning.
[34:16] God bless you saints.

[34:20] the house of the Lord today. Amen. Amen.
[34:29] more that I surrender,
[34:34] the lighter
[34:36] my Lord.

[35:55] to understand
[35:58] the road I'm traveling down.

[36:05] or wondering.
[36:08] I'm standing on solid ground
[36:13] and I'm headed to my future home. The

[37:49] See
[37:51] the problems I had one yesterday
[37:56] are misstepping stones to a higher
[38:00] place. The problems that seem so awome
[38:04] to me are now my banners of victory
[38:10] and I know I'm headed to my future home.
[38:15] The voice I hear is yours alone. Every
[38:21] day I live.
[38:23] Lord, I love you more.

[38:37] my Lord.

[40:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's so much truth to
[40:12] that song.
[40:14] Ah, just surrender. He wants to use you.
[40:18] Amen. Will you stand to your feet?
[40:21] Praise the Lord. Let's sing Amazing
[40:22] Grace as brother Jerry comes out this
[40:25] morning.

[43:10] Lord.
[43:12] He is worthy of all of your praise.
[43:15] Amen. You know, uh just thinking back
[43:18] there, the fact that you have come this
[43:21] far, it it just shows how good God has
[43:24] been to you.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; And I just believe that every one of you
[43:28] here are here because you're standing on
[43:30] victorious grounds.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is worthy to be praised,
[43:35] saints. He is worthy to be praised.
[43:39] And and I just know that uh you know
[43:41] they like to say in uh you know save the
[43:43] best for last, but you know I just
[43:46] believe that God uh he deserves our best
[43:49] this morning. Amen. Because of how good
[43:52] he's been to us because of his grace,
[43:54] because of his mercy, because of his
[43:57] faithfulness. Amen. The things that we
[44:00] didn't understand, God showed up. The
[44:02] doors that were closed, God opened them
[44:04] up. Amen. that is the God that you serve
[44:07] this morning. I greet you all in the
[44:10] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[44:12] Uh it is certainly a privilege for me to
[44:15] be before you this morning. Um you know
[44:18] uh just thinking about uh just on my way
[44:20] here just how how grateful I am for
[44:22] Spirit and Truth Tabernacle. Um and I I
[44:25] say this with all my heart for my
[44:27] family. We appreciate Spirit of Truth.
[44:30] Praise God. From the greatest to the
[44:32] least.
[44:35] Amen.
[44:36] And we all know who the greatest is.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; It's the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise
[44:42] God. And I just happen to be the least
[44:45] this morning. So I thank you and I just
[44:47] solicit your prayer and I trust that God
[44:50] will uh is have his way this morning. So
[44:52] let us just bow in a word of prayer.
[44:56] Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you God
[44:59] for your grace, Lord. Lord, the song
[45:02] says, "Amazing grace." And Lord, it is
[45:05] because truly your grace is amazing. Oh,
[45:08] Father, there's so many things that
[45:10] could be, oh Lord, that can get old, but
[45:13] God, that is one that can never get old,
[45:15] Father. Because even on the other side,
[45:17] we'll still be singing Amazing Grace.
[45:20] And Lord, I thank you, God, that you
[45:22] have once again showed up in the midst
[45:24] of your people, Lord. You have kept your
[45:26] word, Father, as you have promised,
[45:28] Lord, whenever two or three are
[45:30] gathered, you would be there, Lord. And
[45:33] Father, I know, God, that you have
[45:35] something in store for us this morning.
[45:37] And I just pray that you would have your
[45:38] way, Lord. Father God, you say when
[45:41] omnipotence meet omnipotence, something
[45:43] is bound to happen. So, Father, I pray
[45:46] that you'll not be limited, Lord, in our
[45:49] gathering, God. Oh, Father, I pray you
[45:51] would have your preeminence, Lord. And
[45:53] God, may you speak to every vessel,
[45:55] Lord. May, oh Father, the Spirit bring
[45:58] everything to subjection to your word,
[46:00] Lord. And Father, I pray, Lord, to from
[46:03] from the inside of the sanctuary to the
[46:06] stream, Lord. May every word be, oh God,
[46:09] sent to its designated place, Father,
[46:12] that it would bring forth fruit. Oh
[46:13] Lord. Oh, Father, we thank you, God. We
[46:16] thank you. And Lord, we just commit this
[46:18] part of the service into your hands. In
[46:20] the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[46:24] God bless you. So this morning without
[46:27] any delay, we will uh turn our Bibles to
[46:31] uh a few places. Uh we want to start at
[46:34] the third John chapter 1 and we'll read
[46:37] a few verses there. Verse two to verse
[46:41] four. Praise the Lord. And just say amen
[46:44] when you're there.
[46:48] And God richly bless you uh to the to
[46:51] our guest this morning. Uh brother
[46:53] Timothy, I believe it is. We we
[46:55] certainly thank you for your for your
[46:57] presence with us. I really appreciate
[46:59] that special. It was a real blessing.
[47:08] Amen.
[47:11] Third John
[47:13] chapter 1 verse two.
[47:27] All right. So it reads,
[47:31] "Beloved, I wish above all things that
[47:35] thou mayest prosper and be in health
[47:38] even as thy soul prosperth.
[47:42] For I rejoiced greatly when the brethren
[47:45] came and testified of the truth that is
[47:48] in thee, even as thou walkest in the
[47:51] truth. I have no greater joy than to
[47:54] hear my children walk in truth. Amen.
[47:59] And we want to read another place here.
[48:00] Psalms chapter 8 verse 3-6.
[48:04] Praise God. Give you some time to turn
[48:06] to that.
[48:15] Praise the Lord. And it reads, "When I
[48:18] consider the heavens, the work of thy
[48:22] fingers, the moon and the stars, which
[48:26] thou hast ordained?
[48:28] What is man that thou art mindful of
[48:31] him? And the son of man that thou
[48:33] visitest him? For thou hast made him a
[48:36] little lower than the angels, and thou
[48:38] hast crowned him with glory and honor.
[48:41] Thou madeest him to have dominion over
[48:44] the works of thy hands. Thou hast put
[48:47] all things under his feet. Praise the
[48:51] Lord. May the Lord add a blessing to his
[48:53] reading. You all may have your seats.
[48:55] Praise the Lord. So, we want to get into
[48:58] a subject this morning. Uh and as a
[49:01] title uh we want to talk about a
[49:04] paradigm shift. Praise the Lord. A
[49:07] paradigm shift. And our inspiration this
[49:10] morning is purge for the blessings.
[49:14] Praise the Lord. Purge for the
[49:16] blessings. And I just like what we read
[49:18] so far this morning in third John
[49:21] chapter chapter 1. Uh because I just
[49:24] believe the same John that was caught on
[49:26] the aisle of Patmas uh saw and caught a
[49:28] revelation of God's greatest and highest
[49:31] desire for man. Praise the Lord. And
[49:34] John would say that uh that we ought to
[49:38] um live in such a way where healing and
[49:43] uh prosperity in our healing in our
[49:45] bodies is something that we ought to
[49:47] have. Amen. And I just like how he says
[49:50] that I wish that in all things you
[49:52] prosper in health as your soul prospers.
[49:55] U and when you're when when it says when
[49:58] your soul prospers um you know he he he
[50:00] he brings it back home to say that um
[50:03] that how he was glad and rejoiced when
[50:06] the brethren were in truth. And you see
[50:09] when we're in truth saints there's
[50:12] there's something in us that prospers.
[50:14] Amen. And there's something that just um
[50:16] that just uh happens to uh uh uh uh
[50:20] reflect the word because the word never
[50:22] lost its position. The word never lost
[50:24] its power. Amen. So as a man that
[50:28] believes this word, we realize that God
[50:31] is reconciling us back to himself and to
[50:34] reflect that perfect image of Jesus
[50:36] Christ. Amen. Uh so God's desire for
[50:40] your life isn't just for you to survive,
[50:42] but it's for you to exceed. It's for you
[50:45] to prosper in all things. Praise the
[50:47] Lord. And and I just believe God has
[50:50] dealt with us especially this year uh to
[50:53] experience a life of transformation from
[50:56] the inside man to the outside man.
[51:00] Praise the Lord. Now the prophet says
[51:02] this here. We want to read this in the
[51:05] message
[51:07] total deliverance.
[51:09] Praise God. And I know our projector is
[51:12] not working this morning. Uh but I trust
[51:15] we can all catch what the prophet is
[51:17] saying. The prophet says, "The church
[51:19] has been in the minority. It always will
[51:23] be in numbers until Jesus comes. But
[51:26] it's living under its Godgiven
[51:29] privileges."
[51:31] He says, "If we only knew this is the
[51:34] church of the living God," not the
[51:37] Brandham tabernacle and if I might say
[51:39] not spirit and truth tabernacle. Uh but
[51:41] he says that is just part of it. There's
[51:44] other such tabernacles through the
[51:46] country. But he says if we only knew
[51:49] that this church is the church of the
[51:51] living God. And saints as the church of
[51:55] the living God, God has given you
[51:57] promises. Praise the Lord. God has given
[52:00] you dominion. God has given you his
[52:03] word. And if I can go further, God has
[52:05] given you himself. Praise God.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; A and the scripture says that what is
[52:11] man that thou art mindful of him. Praise
[52:14] the Lord. He's mindful of you not just
[52:18] today, but he was mindful of you
[52:19] throughout the year. He's going to be
[52:21] mindful of you tomorrow. Praise the
[52:23] Lord.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Because you are part of his image.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, God has given us his
[52:33] full intentions. I believe that he he
[52:36] wants us to have dominion over the
[52:38] things of the earth. Praise the Lord.
[52:40] And I think it's important that we
[52:42] understand that it takes a certain
[52:43] approach to God, a certain approach to
[52:46] the word of God and a certain approach
[52:48] to ourselves as we receive the word of
[52:51] God. Praise the Lord. Ultimately, we
[52:54] want to adopt and that is a position
[52:56] that God has ordained for us to operate
[52:59] in. Amen. A position of authority.
[53:01] Praise the Lord. David says here in that
[53:04] same Psalms chapter 8, he says, "Thou
[53:06] has put all things under his feet."
[53:09] Which means it doesn't matter what you
[53:11] might be going through this morning.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; If all things are under his feet, all
[53:16] things are under your feet. Amen. Praise
[53:19] the Lord. That means sickness is under
[53:21] your feet. Amen. Affliction is under
[53:23] your feet. Diseases is under your feet.
[53:27] Oh my. Everything is under your feet.
[53:30] Praise the Lord.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; And what's under your feet should never
[53:33] be above your head.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Which means you ought to walk knowing
[53:36] that you have something on the inside
[53:39] that reflects on the outside. Praise the
[53:42] Lord. It doesn't matter where you go. It
[53:44] doesn't matter the season. It doesn't
[53:46] matter the condition. It is under your
[53:48] feet.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And that is our expectation
[53:52] this morning that we approach this
[53:56] knowing that God has certain things he
[53:58] wants to manifest in our lives. Praise
[54:00] the Lord.
[54:03] Now, as we continue here, we're living
[54:06] in this grand age of Leodysia.
[54:10] Praise the Lord. And you know, the world
[54:13] has a way of of of their number system.
[54:16] They like to count down. Amen. said they
[54:19] they often times count from 10 to 9 to 8
[54:23] all the way down to one. Uh but God by
[54:26] revelation showed the show show through
[54:28] the prophet that through the ages God's
[54:31] number system is a little different
[54:33] because we don't count down, we count
[54:35] up. Amen.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; And we go from the church of Ephesus all
[54:39] the way to the Leodysian church age
[54:42] which is the seventh church age. Praise
[54:44] the Lord. And you see at some point in
[54:47] time uh when you see the the different
[54:49] ages you you you you see the ending of
[54:53] something but you also see the beginning
[54:55] of something else. Amen. Which means God
[54:59] doesn't deal with with with so much what
[55:02] comes to an end. God is always part of
[55:04] both the end and the beginning. Amen.
[55:07] So, at some point in time when the as
[55:10] the world's number system goes, they get
[55:12] down to one. Um, and and there's just
[55:15] nowhere else to go. But God continues.
[55:18] He goes from the number seven. Amen. And
[55:21] some point there's an overlap. Praise
[55:23] the Lord. And maybe according to the
[55:25] world's number system, maybe they're at
[55:27] number two. Amen. And we're at the we're
[55:29] in the seventh church age. But you see
[55:32] the the the the Leodysian church age has
[55:35] certain atmospheres about it. It has
[55:37] certain conditions and elements that are
[55:39] contained within this age. And I just
[55:42] believe that in this season of our
[55:44] lives, it's important that we we go
[55:47] above this age of Leodysia. We we not we
[55:50] don't we don't we don't we don't stay
[55:52] bound to the elements of this age, but
[55:54] we allow oursel to go a step higher.
[55:56] Praise the Lord. Uh uh when when you
[55:59] talk about Leodysia and I can tell you
[56:01] some of the some of its characteristics.
[56:03] Praise the Lord. Sickness is a
[56:05] characteristics of Leodysia. Praise the
[56:08] Lord. Bondage is a is a condition of
[56:11] Leodysia. Praise the Lord. Uh uh defeat
[56:14] is a characteristic of Leodysia. But you
[56:18] have been called out of a church. Amen.
[56:21] And as the called out of a church, you
[56:23] have been called to go higher than the
[56:26] Leodysian luage. You have been called to
[56:28] go to the bride age. Amen. And when
[56:30] you're in the bride age, you have to
[56:32] forget about Leo and problems. Amen. You
[56:36] have to leave those problems behind. It
[56:38] because an eagle when it eagle gets
[56:40] higher, it leaves certain conditions
[56:42] behind. Praise the Lord. When an eagle
[56:45] is is is maybe battling certain things
[56:47] that is earthbound, the higher it goes,
[56:50] it cannot the things that it goes up
[56:52] with cannot be contained because it's
[56:55] going to a higher place. Praise the
[56:56] Lord. So I think it's time that we lay
[56:59] the less seeing conditions to the side.
[57:02] Praise God.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; And start worrying about bride things.
[57:06] Amen. And if I can say this, you can't
[57:09] live with bride promises while thinking
[57:11] lessian thoughts. Amen. What belongs to
[57:15] Le Oysia has no authority where the
[57:18] bride is. Amen.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; John says this in Revelation 4. He says,
[57:25] "After I looked and behold, a door was
[57:28] open in heaven, and the first voice
[57:30] which I heard was as it were of a
[57:32] trumpet talking to me, which said, Come
[57:35] up hither, and I will show you these
[57:38] things which must be hereafter." Praise
[57:40] the Lord. And I believe that was a call
[57:43] to the bride to come up. Amen. Because
[57:46] your identity won't determine your
[57:48] expectations. Amen. And we thank God
[57:51] this morning that we have an identity.
[57:53] Praise the Lord.
[57:56] Now the prophet says this in the message
[57:58] I know paragraph 7 preached in 1960
[58:03] 0417.
[58:04] He says, I was just talking to someone
[58:06] last night that our last meeting in
[58:09] Oklahoma. I try to uh trying now I'll
[58:12] announce this to lay aside until God
[58:15] would call me to do it. My old ministry
[58:18] of discernment because I think beginning
[58:20] the new ministry is coming in the other
[58:23] night. No one knowing nothing about it.
[58:26] I tested on a child coming across the
[58:28] platform had been born blind. A baby was
[58:31] totally born blind about 16 uh year old
[58:35] boy and just immediately he let out a
[58:37] scream. Brother Brandham, I can see. And
[58:41] there and was Pat standing near, right
[58:44] by the boy when his eyes came open for
[58:46] the first time in all of his life. And
[58:49] so I trust that you are here with great
[58:53] anticipations with myself. I'm looking
[58:56] for something God to do for us and bring
[58:58] us up to another level than what we've
[59:01] been before. Amen. And I just love this
[59:04] testimony that the prophet shares
[59:06] because I believe in this season I can
[59:08] resonate with that. I am anticipating
[59:11] for God to take me to another level than
[59:14] I've been before. Amen. And I believe
[59:16] God has another level that he wants to
[59:18] take his church up to than they've been
[59:21] before. Praise the Lord. You see,
[59:23] brother Brandham faced a transition in
[59:25] his ministry where God wasn't putting
[59:28] away something, but God wanted to
[59:30] introduce something that was more
[59:32] substantial in his ministry. Praise the
[59:34] Lord. And in in this situation and
[59:36] moment where brother Brandham has in the
[59:38] midst of this, the boy is in the midst
[59:40] of his presence, God uh God allowed life
[59:43] to enter into that boy's body. Praise
[59:45] God. And that blind spirit had nowhere
[59:48] else to go. Amen. It had to leave. So
[59:51] this morning we want to talk about what
[59:54] is a paradigm shift. So we'll break that
[59:56] down just a little bit as God would
[59:59] lead. So a paradigm shift
[1:00:02] is a fundamental change in the way
[1:00:05] people think. Amen. A fundamental change
[1:00:09] in the way people think, understand or
[1:00:12] approach something.
[1:00:14] It goes on to say this is according to
[1:00:16] Oxford languages in so much that the old
[1:00:20] way no longer makes sense once the new
[1:00:22] one takes hold. Praise the Lord. Another
[1:00:26] uh a sample definition is it can also be
[1:00:29] regarded as to when the rules of the
[1:00:31] game change not just how well you play
[1:00:35] the game. Praise the Lord. And um we're
[1:00:37] going to read a few characteristics here
[1:00:41] uh of a paradigm shift. One
[1:00:43] characteristic is that it changes
[1:00:45] expectations
[1:00:47] not just methods. Praise the Lord.
[1:00:51] And um another one says uh second
[1:00:53] characteristic is it makes the old way
[1:00:57] often feel outdated or wrong. The third
[1:01:01] characteristic it often feels
[1:01:03] uncomfortable at first. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:06] And I really like this one. It red it
[1:01:08] redefineses what is considered normal,
[1:01:12] possible or correct. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:15] And I just think that reminds me of a
[1:01:17] sermon the prophet preached called a
[1:01:19] paradox. Amen. Something that is
[1:01:22] incredible yet true. Praise the Lord.
[1:01:24] Something that opposes common sense, but
[1:01:27] yet it is true. Praise God. And I just
[1:01:30] believe um when you consider what it is
[1:01:33] to to be in a paradigm shift um it it
[1:01:37] it's a call to change your expectations
[1:01:40] based on where you know you're going.
[1:01:42] Praise the Lord. Amen. And I'm just
[1:01:44] reminded of a a story in the Bible that
[1:01:47] we often read of of of a of a of a
[1:01:50] certain prophet that God would call and
[1:01:53] he was um he was in this particular
[1:01:56] place. Uh but God commanded him to go to
[1:01:59] Zerapath to a certain widow woman. Amen.
[1:02:01] And uh this woman was arranging widow
[1:02:05] woman was arranging her death. Amen. She
[1:02:08] she had nothing much left but what what
[1:02:12] she had left she was making preparations
[1:02:14] for her death. Amen. But the prophet of
[1:02:17] God Elijah right he experienced what we
[1:02:20] can say is a paradigm shift. Amen. He
[1:02:23] went from being fed by the ravens by the
[1:02:25] brook sherith to God commanding him to
[1:02:27] be sustained. Amen. And God said, we'll
[1:02:30] pick this up in first Kings 17
[1:02:34] and we'll just start here uh in verse
[1:02:37] 12,
[1:02:39] sorry, verse 10. It says, "So he arose
[1:02:42] and went to Zerapath. And when he came
[1:02:44] to the gate of the city, behold, a widow
[1:02:47] woman was there gathering of sticks. And
[1:02:50] he called to her and said, "Fetch me, I
[1:02:52] pray thee, a little water in a vessel
[1:02:54] that I may drink." And as she was going
[1:02:57] to fetch it, he called to her and said,
[1:02:59] "Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of
[1:03:01] bread in thine hand." And she said, "As
[1:03:04] the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a
[1:03:06] cake, but a handful of meal in a barrel,
[1:03:09] and a little oil in a cruise, and
[1:03:11] behold, I am gathering two sticks, that
[1:03:14] I may go and dress it for me and my son,
[1:03:16] that we may eat it and die." Amen. So
[1:03:20] this woman was preparing for a different
[1:03:23] expectation. But with the prophet of God
[1:03:26] being there, she was challenged to do
[1:03:28] something that may have been
[1:03:29] uncomfortable. Amen. But she had to act
[1:03:32] in a way of obedience to the prophet's
[1:03:35] word. Praise the Lord. And the prophet
[1:03:37] says, "Fear not. Go and do as thou hast
[1:03:41] said, but make me thereof a little cake
[1:03:43] first, and bring it unto me, and then
[1:03:46] after make thee and for thy son, Amen.
[1:03:50] And and and I could maybe imagine what
[1:03:52] this widow woman's response was because
[1:03:55] even what Elijah commanded didn't make
[1:03:58] sense because there was only enough for
[1:04:00] the two for the widow and her son. Amen.
[1:04:04] But the Elijah says, "Go and do go ahead
[1:04:07] and and and fetch me a cake first. Bring
[1:04:10] it to me and then when you're done, make
[1:04:12] some for yourself." Praise the Lord. But
[1:04:15] see, in that time, God there was a shift
[1:04:17] happening. God was changing her
[1:04:19] expectation. There was a a a
[1:04:22] transformation happening on the inside.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The uh it goes on to
[1:04:27] say that in verse 14, for thus sayeth
[1:04:30] the Lord God of Israel, the barrel of
[1:04:33] meal shall not waste, neither shall the
[1:04:35] cruise of oil fail until the day that
[1:04:38] the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth.
[1:04:40] Amen. And I just love how God moves
[1:04:43] because Elijah went from being fed to
[1:04:46] being sustained. And I just believe
[1:04:48] that's God's desire for every one of his
[1:04:51] children. He wants you to be sustained.
[1:04:53] Amen. He don't want you to have enough.
[1:04:56] He wants you to have more than enough.
[1:04:58] Praise God.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; And the widow woman, she she was in the
[1:05:02] face of death. Amen. But she became the
[1:05:04] source of life. Amen. And it shows that
[1:05:07] death is the beginning of life. When
[1:05:10] we're willing to come to a place of
[1:05:12] death every day to ourselves, we can
[1:05:14] allow God to reign and be an extension
[1:05:17] of our his life in our lives.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:23] The prophet of God says
[1:05:25] this here in the message paradox.
[1:05:29] He was in the he was in the wilderness
[1:05:32] uh hunting with a with a with a brother.
[1:05:35] And as he was as he was hunting, the
[1:05:38] prophet of God saw sees a a snake. And
[1:05:42] he sees a snake a far off. And he he's
[1:05:45] pretty sure that if the snake bites um I
[1:05:49] believe it was a mamba, but he says if
[1:05:51] if if that mamba will strike that
[1:05:53] brother, uh it it would be immediate
[1:05:55] death. Amen. Uh, and the prophet of God
[1:05:58] goes on to he says that he's looking at
[1:06:00] this mamba and the mamba is looking at
[1:06:02] him and they're kind of having this
[1:06:03] staring contest and he the mamba is
[1:06:06] making his way to the prophet but he's
[1:06:08] hesitant. Amen. As he tries to come
[1:06:10] closer he back he he takes another few
[1:06:13] another steps back. He gets closer and
[1:06:15] he goes back. He just could not come
[1:06:17] towards the prophet. Amen. But he gets
[1:06:19] to this brother and we'll pick this up
[1:06:22] in paragraph 66.
[1:06:24] He says, "And just then the serpent
[1:06:26] turned to me, and when I said that, it
[1:06:29] looked at me again, and a voice came
[1:06:31] from above and said, you have been given
[1:06:33] power to bind him, the worst or any."
[1:06:38] And I said, "Well, God, what must I do?"
[1:06:41] And by this time, the the mamba had had
[1:06:44] stricken his brother and and it bitten
[1:06:46] him. Amen. And the prophet of God is
[1:06:49] asking God, what must he do in the midst
[1:06:51] of this situation? because it was sudden
[1:06:53] death to that brother. Paragraph 67, it
[1:06:56] says, he said, "There is one thing you
[1:06:59] must do. You must be more sincere." See,
[1:07:03] you must be more sincere. I said, "Well,
[1:07:05] God, forgive me for my uncincerity and
[1:07:08] let me have sincerity." And when I
[1:07:10] raised up my hands to him again, there
[1:07:13] was a great something came over me. Just
[1:07:16] lifted me up. Seemed like that my whole
[1:07:19] body was charged with something. And I
[1:07:21] looked at the serpent and there he
[1:07:24] started towards me and he couldn't do it
[1:07:26] yet. And I said, "Satan, in the name of
[1:07:28] the Lord Jesus Christ, I bind you." And
[1:07:31] the serpent, a blue smoke flew out of
[1:07:34] him and curled up and made the uh that
[1:07:36] that sign like a S, capital S, made
[1:07:39] backwards. It means bind this one or
[1:07:42] anything below him. And we'll jump to
[1:07:44] paragraph 70 um 71. It says, "And just
[1:07:49] then a voice came again and says, you
[1:07:52] can unbind him also." So I said, "Then
[1:07:55] Satan, that I might know I unbind you."
[1:07:58] And when it did, he started coming to
[1:08:00] life again wiggling. And I said, "I bind
[1:08:04] you back in the name of Jesus Christ."
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when it did, the smoke flew
[1:08:09] out of him again. Praise the Lord. And I
[1:08:12] just want to encourage you with this,
[1:08:14] saints, that the same devil you defeated
[1:08:16] this whole year, you can defeat again.
[1:08:19] The same devil you defeated last year,
[1:08:22] you can defeat again. Amen. You you you
[1:08:25] you don't need to wait till next year to
[1:08:27] defeat that devil that's been bothering
[1:08:29] you. Praise the Lord. Because you've
[1:08:31] been given authority to bind and to
[1:08:33] loose. Amen. That's the authority you
[1:08:36] have as the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I just like how God allowed
[1:08:41] the prophet to play this back and forth
[1:08:44] game with the serpent to show the power
[1:08:46] of God in the man.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:51] So some everyday examples
[1:08:54] of a paradigm shift
[1:08:57] based on my study here is over the years
[1:09:00] or generations
[1:09:02] things have moved from we've went from
[1:09:05] the cassette tapes we've went from DVDs
[1:09:08] we've went from maybe beepers and things
[1:09:10] of that nature to streaming that would
[1:09:13] be considered a everyday paradigm shift
[1:09:16] how now we consume media praise the Lord
[1:09:19] also how we communicate. Amen. We've
[1:09:22] gone from landlines to smartphones.
[1:09:24] Amen. That would be the everyday
[1:09:27] paradigm shift. And I think it's
[1:09:30] important that as we gather this thought
[1:09:32] that we we understand that anything that
[1:09:35] happens in the natural is a type of the
[1:09:37] spiritual.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And if the world around
[1:09:41] us has experienced such a shift in the
[1:09:44] way it does things, in the way it
[1:09:46] consumes information, then how much more
[1:09:48] the bride The prophet of God says,
[1:09:50] "We're not living in the age uh uh
[1:09:53] according to this world where they're
[1:09:55] they're they're uh they're riding
[1:09:56] vehicles or in the buggy, but it's the
[1:09:58] astronaut age." Amen. Which means
[1:10:01] there's things that this world is
[1:10:02] tapping into that they've never been tap
[1:10:05] they never tapped into before. Praise
[1:10:07] the Lord. But I believe the bride of
[1:10:09] Jesus Christ has tapped on resources
[1:10:12] this morning. Untapped resources. Praise
[1:10:14] God. where we can go from uh not not
[1:10:18] just uh not just uh uh uh being able to
[1:10:22] believe what man is saying or believe
[1:10:24] what a creed or dogma is saying, but
[1:10:27] that we can check ourselves and realize
[1:10:29] that we have a true connection with God.
[1:10:32] Praise the Lord. When we think about the
[1:10:34] transition from uh a DVD play or VCR to
[1:10:38] to streaming, it's all about connection.
[1:10:41] Amen. Amen. And and how much more is our
[1:10:44] connection with God in this hour? Praise
[1:10:46] the Lord. And what I like about
[1:10:48] streaming is if your connection is not
[1:10:50] right, you're going to have you're not
[1:10:52] going to be able to see what you're
[1:10:53] looking at the right way. You'll have
[1:10:55] blurry vision. Amen. You you you you
[1:10:58] might you might have a delay with what
[1:11:00] you're looking at. Praise the Lord. But
[1:11:02] when you have the right connection, you
[1:11:04] have high definition. Praise God. You
[1:11:06] have ultra 4K. Amen. And I just believe
[1:11:09] when we have the right connection with
[1:11:11] God, we can step into the vision. Praise
[1:11:13] the Lord. We can see tomorrow's news
[1:11:16] today. Amen. We don't have to wait for
[1:11:19] the millennium, but we can experience
[1:11:21] the earnest of our of our down payment
[1:11:24] in this side of eternity.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:30] We'll we'll go ahead and just touch base
[1:11:32] on a few believers in the Bible that
[1:11:36] went through this shift. And we want to
[1:11:39] touch base on a man that seemed like
[1:11:43] everything around him was was just
[1:11:45] unfair.
[1:11:46] But God was using his circumstance to
[1:11:50] bless him abundantly. Praise the Lord.
[1:11:52] He didn't just experience a paradigm
[1:11:55] shift, but he experienced a purging as
[1:11:57] well. Praise the Lord. And and this is
[1:12:00] none other than Job. So we'll turn here
[1:12:02] in Job 19.
[1:12:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:10] And just before that, we'll read this
[1:12:12] this quote from the prophet from the
[1:12:14] message. I know. The prophet of God
[1:12:16] says, "And then um Job wondered this.
[1:12:21] It's a strange thing that I'm here uh
[1:12:24] walking around a higher life than what
[1:12:27] the animal is and a higher life than the
[1:12:29] plant life. But yet we find that if a
[1:12:33] tree dies, it'll live again. If a flower
[1:12:36] dies, it'll live again. But he says,
[1:12:39] "Man layth down, he giveth up the ghost.
[1:12:42] And where is he? His sons come to mourn
[1:12:45] over him and to do honor and perceives
[1:12:47] it not." And he was wondering what was
[1:12:50] the matter that God would let life like
[1:12:53] that live again such as flowers and
[1:12:56] plants but a man could not live again.
[1:12:59] All this had him troubled. Praise the
[1:13:01] Lord. And no doubt Job was surrounded by
[1:13:05] doubt. He was surrounded by
[1:13:07] discouragement. Praise the Lord. Every
[1:13:09] side looked like it was challenging. Job
[1:13:12] lost everything in one season of his
[1:13:14] life. Praise the Lord. Uh but but Job
[1:13:17] was being purged for something. Amen. He
[1:13:20] Job was experiencing a a paradigm shift.
[1:13:23] Amen. Because at some point Job got to
[1:13:26] the ground and he he looked around him
[1:13:28] and when he didn't see life anywhere, he
[1:13:31] came to one conclusion. He says, "I know
[1:13:34] that my redeemer liveth." Praise the
[1:13:36] Lord. And I think sometimes no matter
[1:13:39] what life circumstances deals in our in
[1:13:41] our in our lives, Amen. And when we get
[1:13:44] to a place when we know, amen, it
[1:13:46] changes the situation. Praise God. It
[1:13:49] changes the outcome. It changes our joy.
[1:13:52] It changes our peace. It changes our
[1:13:55] mindset because we know. Amen. And when
[1:13:59] you know, you're not trying to believe
[1:14:00] it. You're not trying to understand it.
[1:14:03] It's something that's been settled.
[1:14:05] Amen. And Job had a settled revelation
[1:14:08] that regardless of what would happen to
[1:14:10] his body regardless of what would happen
[1:14:13] to uh to to to his family. He saw he saw
[1:14:18] um he saw resurrection day. Praise the
[1:14:20] Lord. He saw his future. Amen. If I
[1:14:23] could say it like that, his future could
[1:14:25] not contain his past. Praise God. His
[1:14:28] future could not contain his present
[1:14:30] state. Praise God. Because God had
[1:14:32] something better for him. Praise the
[1:14:34] Lord. Amen.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; So the prophet of uh so the so the
[1:14:40] scripture says in Job
[1:14:42] 19, actually we'll just turn to Job 41.
[1:14:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:03] I'm sorry. Job 42. Praise God.
[1:15:06] And it says here that
[1:15:12] in verse 9, we'll start there. It says,
[1:15:14] "So Elephaz, the the Timmonite and
[1:15:17] Bilad, the shoe the Shuhite and Zofar
[1:15:20] the Na na Namothite went and did
[1:15:23] according as the Lord commanded them. Uh
[1:15:26] the Lord also accepted Job. And the Lord
[1:15:29] turned the captivity of Job when he
[1:15:31] prayed for his friends. Also the Lord
[1:15:34] gave Job twice as much as he had before.
[1:15:38] There came unto him all his brethren and
[1:15:40] all his sisters, and all they that had
[1:15:43] been uh of his acquaintance before, and
[1:15:46] did eat bread with him in his house. And
[1:15:49] they bemoaned him, and comforted him all
[1:15:51] over the evil that the Lord had brought
[1:15:53] upon him. Every man also gave him a
[1:15:56] piece of money and everyone an earring
[1:15:58] of gold. So the Lord blessed the latter
[1:16:01] end of Job more than his beginning. For
[1:16:03] he had 14,000 sheep and 6,000 camels and
[1:16:07] thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand she
[1:16:10] assasses. He had also seven sons and
[1:16:12] three daughters. Praise the Lord. And
[1:16:15] here we can see that uh God allowed Job
[1:16:19] to experience a full and total
[1:16:22] restoration of all the things that he
[1:16:24] went through. Praise God. And it shows
[1:16:26] that our purging is part of God's plans
[1:16:29] in our lives. Amen. God uh did not allow
[1:16:32] Job to kn to lose not one thing. Praise
[1:16:35] the Lord. So I just thank God that I
[1:16:37] just thank God that he can allow us to
[1:16:39] go through certain things in our lives
[1:16:41] that no matter what it is, Amen. better
[1:16:44] is coming. Amen. Something better is on
[1:16:47] its way. Praise the Lord.
[1:16:52] The prophet of God says in the message,
[1:16:53] the approach to God, he says, "If you're
[1:16:56] really born again," get it now? If
[1:16:59] you're really born again, there's
[1:17:00] nothing can separate you from God.
[1:17:03] That's right. Neither starvation,
[1:17:05] perils, trials, suffering, death,
[1:17:08] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:17:10] God which is in Christ Jesus. You say,
[1:17:12] "Well, I started to be a Christian one
[1:17:14] time. Everything began going this way
[1:17:17] and that way, and I thought my my I was
[1:17:20] better off the other way." You never did
[1:17:22] come to God, brother. If you really come
[1:17:25] to God and got a taste of the heavenly
[1:17:28] gifts of God, partakers of his divine
[1:17:30] nature. Why? You could no more be a
[1:17:33] sinner again. Unbeliever, then a stalk
[1:17:36] of corn could become a cocker bird.
[1:17:39] That's right. It's your nature. You're
[1:17:41] made up. You've come to uh you've got to
[1:17:44] come the right approach. You have to
[1:17:46] come your own approach. You come God's
[1:17:48] provided approach one time and see what
[1:17:50] happens. Yes, Job was taking his
[1:17:53] children through uh and the only
[1:17:55] provided approach there was was the
[1:17:56] burnt offering and now here's a little
[1:17:58] thing I want you to notice. After all
[1:18:01] the turmoil and everything was over and
[1:18:03] then God had taken all of his sheep and
[1:18:05] his cattle and his horses. Then an end
[1:18:08] of his chastisement or purging, God
[1:18:11] doubled him. If he had 10,000 cattle,
[1:18:13] God gave him 20,000 cattle. See, it was,
[1:18:17] isn't that marvelous? God purged Joel
[1:18:19] for the purpose to bless him. Say,
[1:18:21] "Brother Brandham, I'm a Christian and I
[1:18:23] got sickness now. I wonder why it come."
[1:18:26] God may be purging you, give you some
[1:18:29] trials, make you draw a little closer to
[1:18:31] him, pray a while, then heal you, then
[1:18:35] you can have a testimony. Praise the
[1:18:37] Lord.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; And I just believe that God desires to
[1:18:41] heal you. If you're in that situation
[1:18:43] this morning where you are in the midst
[1:18:45] of a trial, God wants to give you what
[1:18:48] you're in need of more than you want it
[1:18:50] for yourself.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Uh uh uh uh God God is
[1:18:54] not trying to uh keep anything from you,
[1:18:57] but he wants you to be in the right
[1:18:59] mindset. He wants you to be in the right
[1:19:00] channel. He wants you to be aligned with
[1:19:03] his po with his word. Praise the Lord.
[1:19:05] Another man that experienced
[1:19:08] a paradigm shift in his life is Jacob.
[1:19:13] Praise the Lord. And and Jacob, as uh
[1:19:16] our brother said this morning, uh he was
[1:19:18] a representation of grace. Amen. Uh
[1:19:21] because Jacob, if it had not been for
[1:19:23] the grace of God, we can say where where
[1:19:25] would he be? Praise the Lord. Uh but God
[1:19:28] had to change his entire makeup. Amen.
[1:19:31] Uh but Job, Jacob had something on on on
[1:19:34] the inside of him that had a thirst and
[1:19:35] a desire. Amen. No matter how and where
[1:19:38] he was, he always found himself wanting
[1:19:41] what God had promised. Amen. And I just
[1:19:44] believe that when we can get ourselves
[1:19:47] in a place where we want and desire the
[1:19:49] promises of God in our lives, amen, and
[1:19:53] something will change. Amen. Something
[1:19:55] will happen. Something will be
[1:19:56] manifested.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, one time as uh
[1:20:01] Jacob is coming back from uh his uh his
[1:20:04] father-in-law and going back to his
[1:20:06] homeland, uh this is Genesis 32:24.
[1:20:09] The Bible says Jacob was left alone, and
[1:20:12] there wrestled a man with him until the
[1:20:15] breaking of the day. And when he saw
[1:20:17] that he prevailed not against him, he
[1:20:20] touched the hollow of his thigh, and the
[1:20:22] hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of
[1:20:24] joint. and he wrestled with him and he
[1:20:27] says, "Let me go for the day breakth."
[1:20:30] And I just could imagine that they've
[1:20:31] been wrestling this whole night.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; And and and at at some point it it's
[1:20:36] it's it's getting it's about to be
[1:20:38] sunrise. And and Jacob is like, I am not
[1:20:41] going to let you go until I experience a
[1:20:44] change. Amen. I will not leave this
[1:20:47] place until something takes place. Jo
[1:20:51] Jacob had a paradigm shift in his mind.
[1:20:54] But see, when you have the right mental
[1:20:55] attitude, the prophet of God says,
[1:20:57] "Every promise of God shall come to
[1:20:59] pass."
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; And it goes on to say that uh he says,
[1:21:04] "I will not let thee go except thou
[1:21:07] bless me." And he said unto him, "What
[1:21:10] is thy name?" And he said, "Jacob." And
[1:21:13] he says, "Thy name shall be called no
[1:21:15] more Jacob, but Israel. For as a prince
[1:21:19] has thou power with God and with man,
[1:21:22] and has prevailed. You see, Jacob had no
[1:21:25] idea what he was getting ready to step
[1:21:27] into. Praise the Lord. But when this
[1:21:29] happened, if I could say this, Jacob
[1:21:31] caught a wave. Praise the Lord. Um and
[1:21:33] and and brother Jack often mentions
[1:21:35] this. In Florida, we see a lot of waves
[1:21:38] in the oceans. Amen. And when you when a
[1:21:40] wave comes, you have to get on it before
[1:21:43] it leaves. Praise the Lord. because it
[1:21:45] might not come again or you might have
[1:21:47] to wait for a while. But Jacob caught a
[1:21:49] wave. Praise the Lord. And it wasn't
[1:21:51] like uh it wasn't like a wave that would
[1:21:53] not come again. It was a wave that would
[1:21:55] abide. Praise the Lord. It would a wave
[1:21:58] that can give power. A wave that can
[1:22:00] give strength. A wave that can bring
[1:22:02] change and transformation. Praise the
[1:22:04] Lord. If I can say uh their wave is not
[1:22:07] like our wave the Lord. Because we have
[1:22:09] a wave on the inside that changes from
[1:22:12] eternity to eternity. Amen. Praise the
[1:22:15] Lord. It's it's a wave that no matter
[1:22:17] what the situation is, it cannot be
[1:22:20] defeated. Amen. The gates of hell cannot
[1:22:23] prevail. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:26] And Jacob wrestled all night and he left
[1:22:30] with his blessing.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; And maybe you've been wrestling all
[1:22:33] year. Maybe you've been wrestling with a
[1:22:36] certain thing. Maybe it's been several
[1:22:38] years, Lord. Uh uh maybe it hasn't been
[1:22:41] just 2025. Maybe it's 2024. Maybe it
[1:22:44] goes back to 2020. Maybe it goes back to
[1:22:47] since co I don't know when uh uh uh your
[1:22:50] wave or or your your your wrestle
[1:22:52] started. But praise God, we are in the
[1:22:54] season of restoration. Amen. And I want
[1:22:57] to encourage you that God don't have to
[1:22:59] restore that you lost it. Amen. Because
[1:23:02] if God restores it, he can restore it
[1:23:04] all in one season. He can restore it all
[1:23:07] in one day. Praise the Lord. So I
[1:23:09] encourage you saints to jump on the wave
[1:23:12] of God. Praise the Lord. And expect and
[1:23:15] receive what he has for you.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:21] Another thing I want to mention about
[1:23:23] Jacob is he experienced grace in the
[1:23:26] midst of his purging. When you're being
[1:23:28] purged, sometimes it feels like it's the
[1:23:31] end or sometimes you wonder why you.
[1:23:34] Praise the Lord. But that's when grace
[1:23:36] steps in. Amen. Because God always wants
[1:23:41] you to draw a little closer to him.
[1:23:43] Amen. God wants to have a sweet
[1:23:45] fellowship with you. Amen. He the
[1:23:48] relationship with the Christian journey
[1:23:50] is all based on our connection and
[1:23:53] relationship with God. How well we can
[1:23:56] please God in all of our doings. Amen.
[1:24:00] The prophet of God says
[1:24:02] in message questions and answers he says
[1:24:05] what you are this is paragraph 78.
[1:24:09] He says what you are that I said in the
[1:24:11] beginning what you are somewhere else is
[1:24:14] what you reflect here. What you are what
[1:24:18] your celestial or terrestrial body is up
[1:24:20] yonder. What your celestial body is
[1:24:23] somewhere else is what you're reflecting
[1:24:25] back here in the spirit land. what you
[1:24:28] are, what you are here. If you're still
[1:24:30] uh verbal minded or so forth in the
[1:24:33] spirit land or you're vogalminded here,
[1:24:36] if you still have malice, envy, strife,
[1:24:38] you're in the spirit land with that. It
[1:24:41] reflects back here. But if your whole
[1:24:43] innermost being has become cleansed,
[1:24:46] purged, it shows that you've got a body
[1:24:49] out yonder waiting that's been cleansed
[1:24:51] and purged and it's reacting back in the
[1:24:54] flesh. Don't you see? There it is. If
[1:24:57] this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we
[1:25:00] have one already waiting. Praise the
[1:25:03] Lord. And it's why while we're on this
[1:25:05] earthly journey, praise God. The Bible
[1:25:07] says in Matthew 6 verse 9, "Lay up not
[1:25:10] for yourselves treasures upon the
[1:25:13] earth." Amen. Where moth and rust dove
[1:25:16] corrupt. says, "Where thieves break in
[1:25:18] and steal, but lay up for yourselves
[1:25:20] treasures in heaven, where neither moths
[1:25:23] nor rust corrupt, where thieves uh do
[1:25:26] not break through uh or steal." Praise
[1:25:28] the Lord. For where your treasure is,
[1:25:30] there will your heart be also. So, we
[1:25:32] have something out yonder that reflects
[1:25:35] perfection, that reflects a a finished
[1:25:38] work. Praise the Lord. So we can rejoice
[1:25:41] knowing that no matter what we're going
[1:25:43] through, we're a reflection of what is
[1:25:46] already with God. Amen.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:51] Another paradigm shift
[1:25:53] in the Bible,
[1:25:56] we'll find this in Matthew chapter 8
[1:25:58] verse 28.
[1:26:01] You see, sometimes
[1:26:03] when we're going through certain things,
[1:26:06] uh, we forget who we are. Amen.
[1:26:09] And sometimes we forget that the weakest
[1:26:13] of Christians, the uh the prophet says,
[1:26:15] amen, will will make the the kingdom of
[1:26:19] hell tremble. Praise the Lord. So when
[1:26:22] you have recognized who you are and what
[1:26:24] your dwelling is, you'll realize that
[1:26:27] the enemy, the devil, is not your trial.
[1:26:29] Amen. You'll understand that you are his
[1:26:32] trial. Praise the Lord. And when you are
[1:26:34] his trial, at your command, he's bound.
[1:26:38] Amen. He's obligated to obey whatever
[1:26:42] you say.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And I just like this
[1:26:45] here in verse 28, Matthew 8, it says,
[1:26:48] "And when he was come to the other side
[1:26:50] into the country of Gurgens, there met
[1:26:53] him two possessed with devils coming out
[1:26:57] of the tombs exceeding fears, so that no
[1:27:00] man might pass that way." I mean, this
[1:27:03] was a a a area I could say that was on
[1:27:06] lockdown by devils. Amen. No man went
[1:27:11] near that area because they understand
[1:27:13] these two men were possessed with
[1:27:16] devils.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Brother Brandham even
[1:27:18] shared a story one time about how this
[1:27:20] man being possessed with devil, how much
[1:27:22] power he had. Amen. But verse 29 said,
[1:27:26] "And behold, they cried out, saying,
[1:27:30] What have we to do with thee, Jesus,
[1:27:33] thou son of God, of thou come hither to
[1:27:36] torment us before the time?" Amen. When
[1:27:40] they saw Jesus, immediately they were
[1:27:42] frightened. Immediately they understand
[1:27:44] what this meant.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; They understand that, "Wait a minute.
[1:27:48] We're about to change atmospheres here."
[1:27:50] Amen. We're about to go from a place of
[1:27:53] dominion to a place of torment.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; And verse 32, it says, "And he said unto
[1:28:00] them, Jesus spoke one word. He said,
[1:28:04] "Go."
[1:28:05] And at his command, the scene had to
[1:28:08] change. The devils had to flee.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And I just wonder what
[1:28:13] can happen if you speak one word to the
[1:28:15] devil.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I just wonder what can
[1:28:18] happen if you speak one word to your
[1:28:20] situation. I wonder what can happen if
[1:28:22] you speak one word to your to your
[1:28:25] condition this morning to your to
[1:28:27] whatever it is you're going through. If
[1:28:29] Jesus spoke go praise the Lord. It means
[1:28:33] the devil has to obey.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And and it's not just
[1:28:38] your condition maybe physically. It
[1:28:40] could be your condition financially. If
[1:28:42] you got debt this morning, you can say
[1:28:45] go. Praise the Lord. If you got a family
[1:28:47] member that's not where they need to be,
[1:28:49] you can say go. Praise the Lord. God has
[1:28:52] given you that command.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Where the devils can be can have a trial
[1:29:00] because of who you are. Amen. They knew
[1:29:04] who they were in the presence of. Praise
[1:29:07] the Lord.
[1:29:10] We all need a paradigm shift because it
[1:29:13] takes having the right mental attitude
[1:29:15] towards the word of God.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet of God says
[1:29:21] here in the message at thy word.
[1:29:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:27] He says now he promised that he will do
[1:29:30] these things sending signs and wonders.
[1:29:32] And now God has made that known to the
[1:29:35] people. If you can get the vision of it
[1:29:37] and will believe it, it will be yours
[1:29:41] tonight, this morning. No doubt about
[1:29:43] it. If Christ himself was wearing my
[1:29:46] suit in my shoes, he was standing here
[1:29:50] and you had um you would go away from
[1:29:53] here just as sick as you are now. He
[1:29:56] cannot save you against your own will.
[1:29:58] He cannot heal you against your own
[1:30:00] will. You must believe that he is and a
[1:30:03] rewarder of those who diligently seek
[1:30:05] him. Amen. Just want to say healing is
[1:30:08] not the will of God changing because
[1:30:11] God's will is for you to be healed.
[1:30:13] God's will is for you to have salvation.
[1:30:16] Praise the Lord. But is your faith
[1:30:18] aligned with the word of God?
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Is your faith aligned with the perfect
[1:30:22] will of God?
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:26] In Deuteronomy chapter 2, we'll jump
[1:30:29] here for a moment.
[1:30:31] We'll read just a few verses here
[1:30:34] because I think sometimes as we face
[1:30:36] different things in our in our lives, go
[1:30:38] through certain seasons,
[1:30:40] um God always has a point where he
[1:30:45] allows us to experience a breakthrough.
[1:30:47] He always has a point where he allows us
[1:30:49] to find that way of escape. Praise the
[1:30:52] Lord. Uh you see, there's not many ways
[1:30:54] of escapes. There's only one way of
[1:30:56] escape. Amen. And we need to find
[1:30:58] exactly where it is. It says that then
[1:31:02] we turned and took our journey into the
[1:31:04] wilderness by the way of the Red Sea as
[1:31:07] the Lord spake unto me and we compassed
[1:31:10] Mount Seir many days. Amen.
[1:31:14] And it goes on to say verse two, and the
[1:31:16] Lord spake unto me, saying, Ye have
[1:31:19] compassed this mountain long enough.
[1:31:22] Turn you northward. Praise the Lord. And
[1:31:24] I just want to encourage you with that
[1:31:26] thought this morning that maybe you have
[1:31:29] come past a mountain for a very long
[1:31:32] time. Praise the Lord. But you don't
[1:31:34] have to take that mountain with you in
[1:31:35] 2026. Amen. You don't even have to take
[1:31:38] that mountain with you out that door.
[1:31:40] Praise the Lord. You can leave it right
[1:31:42] here. Amen. Whatever that mountain looks
[1:31:45] like, praise the Lord. It shall become
[1:31:48] low. Amen.
[1:31:50] The children of Israel's journey through
[1:31:52] the scriptures, we saw they had a lot of
[1:31:54] ups and downs, but it was never about a
[1:31:56] geographical location. Amen. It was
[1:31:59] always about them finding their
[1:32:01] identity, knowing who they was and the
[1:32:03] God that stood behind them. Praise the
[1:32:06] Lord. There is a God that stands behind
[1:32:08] you this morning.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:11] Now, we want to talk about what I would
[1:32:14] say is the paradigm shift. There's many
[1:32:16] paradigm shifts. There's many things
[1:32:18] that we experience in our lives that
[1:32:20] that that brings about a shift. Praise
[1:32:22] the Lord. But there's a greater shift
[1:32:25] that we're under expectation for. Praise
[1:32:27] the Lord. And we'll we'll we'll we
[1:32:29] we're'll turn into First Corinthians
[1:32:32] chapter 15. But that shift is none other
[1:32:34] than a body change. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:37] It's none other than the rapture. And I
[1:32:40] believe we're in that season, saints,
[1:32:42] where it's not about making
[1:32:43] preparations, but it's about being
[1:32:45] ready, being prepared, being in the
[1:32:47] right spirit, being in the right
[1:32:49] channel, being in a place where uh uh uh
[1:32:52] uh there's no more weights in our way,
[1:32:55] but every every unclean thing is put
[1:32:58] aside. Praise the Lord.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Behold, I show you a
[1:33:03] mystery." This is verse 51. says, "We
[1:33:07] shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
[1:33:09] changed in a moment, in the twinkling of
[1:33:12] an eye, at the last trump. For the trump
[1:33:15] shall sound, and the dead shall be
[1:33:17] raised incorruptible, and we shall be
[1:33:20] changed." And here's the paradigm shift.
[1:33:23] It says, "This corruptible must put on
[1:33:26] incorruption, and this mortal must put
[1:33:29] on immortality." Amen. So when this
[1:33:32] corruptible shall have put on
[1:33:34] incorruption and this mortal have put on
[1:33:36] immortality, then shall be brought to
[1:33:39] pass, saying that is written, death is
[1:33:41] swallowed up in victory. And saints, I
[1:33:44] if if if we can look at ourselves, amen,
[1:33:48] we will and shall be changed. Amen. We
[1:33:51] are this is the generation that shall
[1:33:53] see the rapture. Praise the Lord. And
[1:33:56] that that has already begun. Amen. We're
[1:33:58] we're we're not waiting for it. We're in
[1:34:00] the midst of it.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; And we we this caus us to shift our
[1:34:07] attention and mindset so that we're
[1:34:09] under expectation for what God has in
[1:34:12] store for us. Uh can you imagine waking
[1:34:14] up one day and and and seeing um one of
[1:34:17] them older saints that you have never
[1:34:19] seen before? Praise the Lord. Uh
[1:34:21] something in you will have to change.
[1:34:23] Praise the Lord. you you you'll have to
[1:34:25] find yourself uh looking back at the
[1:34:28] word but also realizing that something
[1:34:30] is in something is in action. God is
[1:34:33] manifesting his word. Praise the Lord.
[1:34:36] The Bible says in 1 John chapter 3 verse
[1:34:39] two says, "Beloved, now are we the sons
[1:34:42] of God, and it does not yet appear what
[1:34:44] we shall be, but we know that when he
[1:34:46] shall appear, we shall be like him, and
[1:34:49] we shall see him as he is." Praise the
[1:34:52] Lord.
[1:34:55] We'll turn to Philippians chapter 3
[1:34:59] verse 20 says for our conversation is in
[1:35:02] heaven from whence also we look for the
[1:35:05] savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall
[1:35:08] change our vile body that it may be
[1:35:11] fashioned like unto his glorious body
[1:35:13] according to the working whereby he is
[1:35:16] able even to subdue all things unto
[1:35:18] himself. Praise the Lord. So, we are uh
[1:35:22] uh we're getting closer, amen, to a body
[1:35:25] change. And and it starts with h our
[1:35:28] minds um being and taking on the mind of
[1:35:31] Christ in this hour. Amen. Being in the
[1:35:34] same channel, being in the same uh uh
[1:35:36] element of the word of God. Another one
[1:35:39] that in the scripture, Amen. uh that
[1:35:43] that when we talk about the rapture that
[1:35:46] experience this was the first occurrence
[1:35:48] of it in the word and uh the Bible picks
[1:35:51] this up in Genesis 5 speaking about
[1:35:54] Enoch. It says Enoch walked with God and
[1:35:57] he was not for God took him. Amen. And
[1:36:01] obviously we know um how Paul speaks
[1:36:04] about Enoch, how Enoch had this
[1:36:06] testimony of pleasing God. Praise the
[1:36:08] Lord. And I I just think that uh prophet
[1:36:11] of God says Enoch was a type of the
[1:36:14] bride. Praise the Lord. As being the
[1:36:16] seventh from Adam, Amen. And we're in
[1:36:19] the seventh church age. Praise the Lord.
[1:36:22] Uh and and we can expect there to be a
[1:36:24] change at any day, any time. Amen. For
[1:36:27] there to be a body change. Praise the
[1:36:29] Lord.
[1:36:34] I know we're pressed for time, so we'll
[1:36:37] talk a few things here. just on purging
[1:36:39] for a moment here. Now, the purpose of
[1:36:42] purging is to clear the believer from
[1:36:47] guilt. Amen. Uh when you're being
[1:36:49] purged, uh you're being dealt with to
[1:36:52] make you uh clear of whatever you may be
[1:36:55] feeling bad about. Amen. Uh maybe uh
[1:36:58] you've done something that you ought not
[1:37:00] have to have done. Praise God. Or maybe
[1:37:02] you experienced something you just
[1:37:04] didn't understand. But it's to clear you
[1:37:06] of guilt. is to also free you of
[1:37:09] defilement. Praise the Lord. And it's to
[1:37:12] ultimately make make you free of
[1:37:14] something that's unwanted. Praise the
[1:37:16] Lord. Another uh definition here of
[1:37:19] purging, it eliminates excess. Praise
[1:37:22] the Lord. So God, when when you're
[1:37:25] experiencing that season of purging in
[1:37:27] your life, it's not God punishing you
[1:37:30] for destruction. It's not God uh uh uh
[1:37:33] looking down on you, but it's God trying
[1:37:36] to build you up. Is God taking through
[1:37:38] the process of purification? Amen. In
[1:37:41] John chapter 15 verse two, it says,
[1:37:44] "Every branch in me that beareth not
[1:37:46] fruit, he taketh away, and every branch
[1:37:49] that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that
[1:37:52] it may bring forth more fruit." And I
[1:37:55] just love how the Bible says that every
[1:37:58] branch that God purges is uh is so that
[1:38:02] it can bring forth more fruit. Praise
[1:38:05] the Lord. That just tells me that as
[1:38:08] you're going through the season of
[1:38:09] purging, God does not purge what he
[1:38:12] doesn't plan to use. Amen. He purges
[1:38:15] what he wants to multiply. He purges
[1:38:18] what he wants to bless. Amen. He purges
[1:38:21] what he wants to use. Praise God. So if
[1:38:24] you're going through that season, amen,
[1:38:27] God is not done with you yet. Praise the
[1:38:29] Lord. The purging ultimately redirects
[1:38:32] our consciousness and it it positions us
[1:38:35] to a state of perfection in Christ
[1:38:37] Jesus. Hebrews chapter 10 verse one
[1:38:40] says,
[1:38:42] "For the law having a shadow of good
[1:38:43] things to come and not the very image of
[1:38:45] things can never with those sacrifices
[1:38:48] which they offered year by year
[1:38:50] continually make the comers there unto
[1:38:53] perfect. For then what they have not
[1:38:56] ceased to be offered because the
[1:38:58] worshippers once purged should have no
[1:39:00] more conscious of sin." Praise the Lord.
[1:39:03] And uh prophet of God says in the law
[1:39:06] having a shadow in paragraph 162 he says
[1:39:09] the worshipper once purged how does it
[1:39:12] do when life of when the life of the
[1:39:15] sacrifice comes back to the worshipper
[1:39:18] then it's meekness patience gentleness
[1:39:20] longsuffering goodness faith see what I
[1:39:23] mean now what did we uh Methodists do we
[1:39:26] wanted to shout and get it what did we
[1:39:28] Pentecost want to do we wanted to speak
[1:39:30] in tongues and get it but that's not it
[1:39:32] That's not the fruit of the spirit. The
[1:39:34] fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace,
[1:39:37] longsuffering, goodness, patience,
[1:39:38] meekness. There's not one visible
[1:39:41] evidence of it. Not one fleshly. It's
[1:39:44] all the supernatural realm. That's
[1:39:46] right. It's the hidden force that's in
[1:39:49] you. The life of Jesus Christ coming
[1:39:51] back on you, the worshipper. Amen. So,
[1:39:54] when we're being purged, we're also
[1:39:56] we're uh the purging is also taking away
[1:39:58] our nature and conscious of sin. Amen.
[1:40:02] where that old man is going down and and
[1:40:04] and no longer to be to to to have life
[1:40:07] again. Praise the Lord. So when we uh
[1:40:10] experience different things in life, we
[1:40:13] can look at the word. Praise God.
[1:40:15] Because the word is our reflection. The
[1:40:17] word is the mirror of our lives. It's
[1:40:19] how we can identify the spirit man and
[1:40:22] who we truly are. God did not
[1:40:24] predestinate your flesh. He
[1:40:25] predestinated your spirit. Praise the
[1:40:27] Lord. So when God quickens the word to
[1:40:30] you, it's your soul responding to where
[1:40:32] you come from.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:38] A purging
[1:40:41] can be a lot of things. Uh but as we go
[1:40:46] through different things, um we thank
[1:40:48] God for his purging. Because you know,
[1:40:51] Joseph was was purged. He was sold to uh
[1:40:56] to to prison by his brothers. Uh but in
[1:40:59] the midst of all of that, Joseph went
[1:41:01] through, he found himself in a position
[1:41:03] of dominion. He found himself in a
[1:41:06] position of authority. Praise the Lord.
[1:41:08] And it wasn't so much his choice, but
[1:41:11] God had a plan for him. And when his
[1:41:16] father died, his brothers came before
[1:41:18] him and said uh tried to plead before
[1:41:20] Joseph. Amen. and said, "Our father
[1:41:24] wanted you to wanted us to let you know
[1:41:26] to forgive us because of what we've
[1:41:29] done." But Joseph looked at his brothers
[1:41:31] and says, "No, you guys have it all
[1:41:33] wrong. What God uh what what you meant
[1:41:37] for evil or what you meant to harm me,
[1:41:39] God used it for good. God used it to
[1:41:43] preserve life. Praise the Lord." So Jo
[1:41:47] uh uh Joseph understood that the Persian
[1:41:50] was only God's plan to preserve life.
[1:41:53] Amen. And and I just believe God has
[1:41:57] always has a way of bringing everything
[1:41:59] back to its original state. Praise the
[1:42:01] Lord. And I just want to share a
[1:42:03] testimony.
[1:42:05] um my work uh yesterday I had a uh I
[1:42:09] opportunity I guess I can say I spent
[1:42:12] nearly uh just with the different
[1:42:14] patients that I was with I had the
[1:42:16] opportunity to spend the whole day uh in
[1:42:19] the in a Jewish synagogue and um not
[1:42:22] only did I spend the whole not not the
[1:42:24] whole day in a Jewish synagogue but I I
[1:42:26] spent the whole day with with Jewish
[1:42:28] with Jewish family and I got to see a
[1:42:31] lot of their Jewish customs and they
[1:42:33] were very welcome. welcome welcoming to
[1:42:35] invite me to partake and and and in and
[1:42:38] their different customs as well. And but
[1:42:41] what strike me was in the synagogue they
[1:42:44] actually touched base on this story of
[1:42:46] Joseph and his brothers and they were
[1:42:49] talking about how Joseph's brothers was
[1:42:51] asking for forgiveness and how Joseph
[1:42:54] was recognized by his brothers and vice
[1:42:57] versa. And then it strike me as I was
[1:42:59] sitting there that God would allow the
[1:43:02] Jews to experience a shift. Amen. That
[1:43:06] we as Gentiles might experience a shift.
[1:43:09] Praise the Lord. And I realized that
[1:43:11] they were blind in that moment, not even
[1:43:14] realizing that they were they were
[1:43:16] ministering about themselves. Amen. But
[1:43:19] failed to see it. And God would blind
[1:43:21] them because God saw you. Amen. God was
[1:43:25] intentional about you. Praise the Lord.
[1:43:27] God knew that in this hour, in this
[1:43:29] generation, he would have a people that
[1:43:31] he would call by his name that would
[1:43:34] bear the very name of Jesus Christ.
[1:43:37] Praise the Lord. You ought to give him
[1:43:38] praise for that, saints. Amen.
[1:43:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:49] Now, another thing I want to point out
[1:43:52] about the purging is the purging is
[1:43:55] God's process of removing what cannot go
[1:43:59] where you're going. Praise the Lord. So,
[1:44:01] God is taking you somewhere. Praise God.
[1:44:04] And in order for God to take you where
[1:44:05] you're going, there's certain things
[1:44:07] that cannot go where you're going, that
[1:44:09] needs to be purged, that needs to be
[1:44:11] left behind. Praise the Lord. And if I
[1:44:14] can say, sickness needs to be left
[1:44:15] behind. Amen. A a a depression needs to
[1:44:19] be left behind. Amen. Anxiety needs to
[1:44:22] be left behind. Amen. Poverty needs to
[1:44:24] be left behind. Praise the Lord. Because
[1:44:27] God is taking you somewhere for him to
[1:44:29] show you great and mighty things.
[1:44:31] In Philippians 4:8, it says, "Finally,
[1:44:34] brethren, whatsoever things are true,
[1:44:38] whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever
[1:44:41] things are just, whatsoever things are
[1:44:43] pure, whatsoever things are lovely,
[1:44:46] whosoever or whatsoever things are of
[1:44:48] good report, if there be any virtue and
[1:44:51] if there be any praise, think on these
[1:44:54] things." And as I come to a close,
[1:44:56] saints, I just encourage you to think on
[1:44:58] these things this morning. Praise the
[1:45:00] Lord. Understand the blessing and the
[1:45:03] purging. Amen. Understand that God is
[1:45:06] taking you through a change to uh give
[1:45:08] you more than what you've ever had
[1:45:10] before. Praise the Lord. The prophet of
[1:45:13] God says this in the message Hebrews
[1:45:15] chapter 6 verse 599.
[1:45:19] He says, "You'll make mistakes. You'll
[1:45:21] fall. You'lly do wrong. You'll go out
[1:45:24] sometime and do things. That don't mean
[1:45:26] that you're lost. That means you're
[1:45:29] going to get correction. Says, "My
[1:45:31] little boy, a lot of times, my children
[1:45:33] will do things." He says, "They know
[1:45:36] that's against your rules and they know
[1:45:38] what to expect when they do it. They're
[1:45:41] going to get a whipping for it.
[1:45:43] Sometimes a good one, but it's still
[1:45:45] your child. Certainly, it's impossible
[1:45:48] for that man to ever be born again and
[1:45:51] and that's once been born of eternal
[1:45:53] life. Um, God is not an Indian giver."
[1:45:57] Amen. He he had uh he he that heareth my
[1:46:01] words and believeth on him that sent me
[1:46:03] has everlasting life and shall never
[1:46:05] come to the judgment. And I just like to
[1:46:07] reiterate what the prophet just said.
[1:46:09] God is not an Indian giver. Amen. God
[1:46:11] cannot save you just to lose you. God
[1:46:14] cannot heal you just for you to not have
[1:46:16] healing within your possession. Amen.
[1:46:19] Whatever God does for you is supposed to
[1:46:21] stick with you. Praise God. Because you
[1:46:24] serve a God that changes not. Amen.
[1:46:26] The prophet of God goes on to say that
[1:46:30] uh um it's uh it's it's God's promise.
[1:46:34] Now, if you go on and say, "Oh, well
[1:46:35] then I can do it. I always do what I
[1:46:38] want to do." But if you're a Christian,
[1:46:40] you don't want to do the thing that's
[1:46:41] wrong because the very life in you, the
[1:46:44] very foundation. If you want to do
[1:46:46] wrong, it shows the wrong thing is in
[1:46:48] there. How can bitter and sweet water
[1:46:51] come from the same fountain? Amen. So it
[1:46:55] it's a moment to realize that God has
[1:46:58] something greater for uh in store for
[1:47:01] us. Amen. And and and and when we
[1:47:04] understand that God has given us all of
[1:47:07] his his authority, his word that we can
[1:47:10] enforce in our lives, praise God, um the
[1:47:13] purging is a moment for God to correct
[1:47:16] us. Amen. The prophet of God says a a
[1:47:19] illegitimate child cannot stand a purge.
[1:47:22] Amen. A bastard child cannot stand a
[1:47:24] Persian. But when you a true seed of
[1:47:26] God, you will stand the test. Amen. And
[1:47:29] if you don't pass the test, you're going
[1:47:31] to repeat that test until you overcome
[1:47:33] it.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 7:7 says, "The Lord did not
[1:47:40] set his love upon you, nor choose you
[1:47:43] because ye were more in number than any
[1:47:46] people. For ye were the fewest of all
[1:47:49] people. But because the Lord loved you,
[1:47:52] and because he would keep the oath which
[1:47:54] he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the
[1:47:57] Lord brought you out with a mighty hand,
[1:47:59] and redeemed you out of the house of
[1:48:01] bondman from the hand of Pharaoh, king
[1:48:03] of Egypt. Know therefore that the Lord
[1:48:06] thy God, he is God, the faithful God,
[1:48:09] which keepeth covenant and mercy, and
[1:48:11] with them and love them that keep his
[1:48:14] commandment to a thousand generation.
[1:48:17] Praise the Lord. And I love that because
[1:48:19] God did not choose us based on anything
[1:48:21] that we did. His choose his choosing in
[1:48:24] our lives was unconditional, which makes
[1:48:27] his love towards us unconditional.
[1:48:30] Right. Right. So we can approach God
[1:48:32] boldly knowing that everything that he
[1:48:34] has for us is ours and we can receive
[1:48:37] it. Praise the Lord. And um last thing I
[1:48:40] want to just touch base on. I remember I
[1:48:43] was having a conversation with a brother
[1:48:46] last uh believe it was last Sunday maybe
[1:48:48] or the Sunday before that and we were
[1:48:51] just talking about a few things and he
[1:48:52] brought this to me and uh I I had to
[1:48:55] really think about it and I forgot about
[1:48:57] it. And then as I was studying my uh my
[1:49:00] my my notes, it came back. I was like,
[1:49:03] "Wow, did that brother really say that?"
[1:49:05] But the brother said that he read
[1:49:07] something that uh if they took all the
[1:49:10] money in the world and distributed
[1:49:13] equally among the people, uh after a
[1:49:16] while, the money will go back to their
[1:49:18] original owners. Amen. And I just said,
[1:49:21] "Wow, that's that's pretty that's pretty
[1:49:23] astonished." Uh but it made me look at
[1:49:26] it from a spiritual perspective because
[1:49:28] see salvation was distributed in the
[1:49:31] world equally. Healing was distributed
[1:49:33] in the world equally. Amen. Peace was
[1:49:36] distributed in the world equally. Amen.
[1:49:39] But after a while it has to go back to
[1:49:42] its original owner. Amen. Which means
[1:49:45] God has a cycle. God has a system and
[1:49:48] that system is his word. Praise the
[1:49:50] Lord. And that means you are the owner
[1:49:52] of peace. You are the owner of riches.
[1:49:55] You are the owner of healing. You are
[1:49:57] the owner of salvation. Why? Because it
[1:50:00] belongs to you. Praise the Lord.
[1:50:02] Everything that God died for belongs to
[1:50:05] you. There might be some in the world
[1:50:07] that no longer has it because they've
[1:50:09] rejected it. But you've accepted it this
[1:50:11] morning. Amen. It belongs to you.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; And if it belongs to you, I encourage
[1:50:16] you to take it with you.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Take healing with you.
[1:50:20] Praise the Lord. Take riches with you.
[1:50:22] Amen. Take the mind of Christ with you
[1:50:25] because it belongs to you. God richly
[1:50:28] bless you.
[1:50:40] Oh heavenly father God, we thank you for
[1:50:43] your grace, Lord. Oh father, you are
[1:50:46] still the God that is rich in mercy. And
[1:50:49] oh God, how you would visit us, Lord, in
[1:50:53] this final service, Father, one more
[1:50:54] time to remind us, Lord, Father, of who
[1:50:58] we are in this hour. Oh God, to shift
[1:51:01] our mind to understand what you already
[1:51:04] given us, Lord. Lord, it says, I wish
[1:51:06] that you prosper and help as your soul
[1:51:09] prospers, Father. And God, we don't want
[1:51:12] to take your word, Lord, as as a snack.
[1:51:15] But Lord, we want to we want to swallow
[1:51:17] up your word, Father, as it's said in
[1:51:19] the word, God. We want to take all that
[1:51:21] belongs to us, Father. We don't want to
[1:51:23] live not one ounce below our privileges,
[1:51:26] Father. And God, we know and believe,
[1:51:28] Lord, that what you have for us in this
[1:51:31] hour is what will carry us through. No
[1:51:33] matter the season, Lord, no matter the
[1:51:35] year, Father, no matter the situation,
[1:51:37] Father, you are the God that can still
[1:51:40] do the unimaginable. Father, you are the
[1:51:43] God that can do the abundantly,
[1:51:45] exceedingly, above all that we can ask
[1:51:47] or think. And God, not only do we know
[1:51:49] it, Lord, but we are expecting it,
[1:51:51] Father. And God, we just believe in Lord
[1:51:54] and in and in in in this junction of the
[1:51:56] year, Father, as the world may be
[1:51:58] preparing for more sorrows, the world
[1:52:00] may be preparing for more of doubt, for
[1:52:03] more sickness, for more diseases. Oh
[1:52:05] Lord, we're preparing for more healing.
[1:52:07] We're preparing for more testimonies,
[1:52:09] Lord. We're preparing for more victory,
[1:52:12] Lord. We're preparing for more
[1:52:14] abundance, Lord. We're preparing for
[1:52:16] more preparation, uh for more
[1:52:18] restoration, Father God. Oh Lord, all
[1:52:20] these things God are our expectation
[1:52:23] this this hour Lord. And Father, we
[1:52:25] thank you, God, that you have fulfilled
[1:52:27] your word to us one more time. God,
[1:52:30] Lord, help us, Lord, to to really set
[1:52:33] our hearts, Father, on what you have set
[1:52:35] before us, Lord. That is the rapture,
[1:52:37] Father God, to know, Lord, that we'll
[1:52:40] leave this this this garbage can, Lord.
[1:52:42] We'll leave this whole stompyard,
[1:52:44] Father, and we'll go on to glory, oh
[1:52:46] Lord. Oh, Father, where this won't even
[1:52:49] be a thought in our minds, Father God,
[1:52:51] but we'll rejoice you, oh Lord. We'll
[1:52:53] we'll we'll praise you, Father. Oh, God,
[1:52:55] we thank you, Lord. We pray your
[1:52:57] blessings upon your people, Father. Oh,
[1:52:59] Lord, may their going out be just as
[1:53:01] good and even better than they're coming
[1:53:03] in, Lord. Oh, Father, I pray you'll keep
[1:53:05] each one, Father. And may you fulfill
[1:53:07] your word as you have promised. We thank
[1:53:10] you now in the name of Jesus Christ, we
[1:53:11] pray. Amen. Praise the Lord. God richly
[1:53:15] bless you saints. Amen.
[1:53:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:37] Praise the Lord. How many appreciated
[1:53:39] the message?
[1:53:41] My Lord.
[1:53:45] Amen. Brother Jerry says some mighty
[1:53:47] mighty good things. He said something in
[1:53:50] the beginning that you know I I I still
[1:53:53] been in a little writing mode. He said
[1:53:56] your identity will determine your
[1:53:59] expectation.
[1:54:01] And that was something that you know I I
[1:54:03] had been studying.
[1:54:06] Who you believe that you are that's what
[1:54:09] you're going to manifest. That's what
[1:54:11] you're going you're going to attract.
[1:54:14] Like the scripture says, "As a man
[1:54:16] thinkketh in his heart, so is he."
[1:54:19] So if you keep saying, "I am sick."
[1:54:23] You're going to be sick.
[1:54:26] You keep confessing that you're poor,
[1:54:29] you're going to remain poor.
[1:54:33] And I believe that was one reason the
[1:54:35] angel of the Lord told Brother, "If you
[1:54:37] can get the people to believe Nothing
[1:54:40] will stand before your prayer, not even
[1:54:46] what you think about and what you think
[1:54:49] about yourself,
[1:54:51] that's who you are.
[1:54:53] I believe that was one reason I went the
[1:54:55] direction that I went this morning
[1:54:57] because I've been I've been studying on
[1:54:58] those things and brother Jerry went
[1:55:00] right down that aisle.
[1:55:02] We got to change the way that we think
[1:55:04] and what we're thinking about.
[1:55:07] Because when we change what we're
[1:55:08] thinking, we're changing what we're
[1:55:11] confessing.
[1:55:13] Brother Brandham said, "If you're a
[1:55:14] Christian, you say that you are not a
[1:55:15] Christian, you won't be a Christian.
[1:55:18] You say that you are a drunk, you're
[1:55:20] going to be a drunk. It's going to come
[1:55:22] to pass because you're going to manifest
[1:55:24] what you speak because that's truly what
[1:55:26] you believe. You got to change what you
[1:55:30] say about yourself.
[1:55:32] Sometimes you got to talk to yourself
[1:55:33] and say, "Yeah, I'm a believer.
[1:55:36] I'm full of wisdom. I'm full of
[1:55:39] abundance. I'm a son of God. I'm a
[1:55:41] daughter of God. I'm powerful. That's
[1:55:44] who Jesus Christ made me. That's what
[1:55:47] I'm going I'm going to have dominion.
[1:55:48] I'm a king. I'm a priest." You got to
[1:55:51] confess it.
[1:55:54] Why should there come a paradigm shift
[1:55:55] in your life? Things begin to change.
[1:55:59] The atmosphere changes.
[1:56:02] You change
[1:56:04] all because what you said. Amen.
[1:56:19] The Lord bless you
[1:56:24] and keep you.
[1:56:28] Make his face shine upon you.
[1:56:33] Be gracious to you. The Lord turn his
[1:56:41] face towards you
[1:56:45] and give you peace. Come on, let's say
[1:56:50] that part again.
[1:56:53] The Lord bless you
[1:56:58] and keep you.
[1:57:02] Make his face shine upon you.
[1:57:06] Be gracious to you. The Lord turn his
[1:57:14] face towards you
[1:57:18] and give you peace.
[1:57:23] Come on, help me say. Say say amen.
[1:57:32] Amen.
[1:57:36] Amen.
[1:57:38] Amen.
[1:57:41] Say amen.
[1:57:48] Amen.
[1:57:52] Amen.
[1:57:57] May his favor be upon you and a thousand
[1:58:03] generations
[1:58:05] and your family and your children and
[1:58:09] your children and their children. May
[1:58:13] his presence go before you and behind
[1:58:18] you and beside you, all around you and
[1:58:23] within you. He is with you. He is with
[1:58:28] you in the morning,
[1:58:31] in the evening, in your coming, in your
[1:58:36] going, in your weeping and rejoicing.
[1:58:41] He is for you. He is for you. He is for
[1:58:46] you. He is for you. He is for you. He is
[1:58:51] for you. He is for you. He is for you.
[1:58:59] Amen. Amen.
[1:59:05] Say amen.
[1:59:10] HALLELUJAH. IT MEANS SO BE IT.

[1:59:59] AMEN.
[2:00:05] HALLELUJAH.
[2:00:06] Praise the Lord. Let's give our God a
[2:00:08] hand clap of praise.
[2:00:16] Hallelujah.
[2:00:18] Praise the Lord. The Lord is so good to
[2:00:20] us. So, we want to make preparations.
[2:00:22] So, we're going to sing this little song
[2:00:24] as a declaration this morning.
[2:00:35] Come on.
[2:00:40] Makes no
[2:00:43] what you're going through.
[2:00:45] You're going to make it.
[2:00:48] God's going to see you through.
[2:00:51] Hold your head up. Put a smile on your
[2:00:55] face. THIS IS ANOTHER TEST. IT WON'T

[2:03:54] Hallelujah. Let's give our God a hand
[2:03:56] clap of praise this morning.
[2:04:00] Amen. Amen.
[2:04:02] May you go out of here blessed beyond
[2:04:04] measure. Amen. Let's bow our hearts
[2:04:07] before the Lord. Almighty God, we thank
[2:04:10] you, Lord God, for the word that you
[2:04:12] spoke to us this morning. We're grateful
[2:04:15] for your servant getting himself out of
[2:04:16] the way, Lord God, that you can speak to
[2:04:19] him through through him to us, Lord
[2:04:21] Jesus. We're so grateful, Lord Jesus.
[2:04:25] And Father, we have come to the
[2:04:26] realization, Lord God, that we are
[2:04:29] blessed in highly favor, Lord. We are
[2:04:32] the head and not the tail, Lord. We are
[2:04:35] the lender and not the borrower. We are
[2:04:37] sons and daughters of the king, Lord.
[2:04:39] And as brother Brandham would tell the
[2:04:41] story of the African brother that came
[2:04:43] with the slaves, Lord, he was the only
[2:04:45] one with his head head up, Lord. They
[2:04:47] didn't have to beat him, Lord. He was
[2:04:49] right at it, Lord. And they wanted to
[2:04:51] know why he conducted himself like that.
[2:04:53] And it was because they found out he was
[2:04:56] the son of the king. Father, as we walk
[2:04:58] through the Lelay Oysian age, Lord,
[2:05:01] where the world is at, Lord Jesus, we
[2:05:04] know that we are sons and daughters of
[2:05:06] the king. May we conduct ourselves like
[2:05:08] that. May our speech, Lord, be that of
[2:05:10] royalty, Lord Jesus. Speaking the word
[2:05:13] of God, Lord, taking our dominion over
[2:05:15] Satan and all of his imps, Lord Jesus.
[2:05:18] Over sickness, Lord God. Oh Lord, over
[2:05:20] death, Lord, over over whatever stands
[2:05:23] before us, Lord, we is under our feet,
[2:05:25] Lord, because you are the victorious
[2:05:28] one. You are our great victor, Lord
[2:05:30] Jesus. And Father, as we leave this
[2:05:32] place, Lord, I pray, Lord God, that
[2:05:34] you'll be with your children, Lord. May
[2:05:36] they think on these things, Lord. And
[2:05:39] Father, may they speak your divine word.
[2:05:41] Go before them, Lord. Bless everything
[2:05:43] they put their hands to, Lord. Oh Lord,
[2:05:46] bless them in their health, Lord. Bless
[2:05:48] them in their family life, Lord God.
[2:05:50] Bless them in their spiritual walk with
[2:05:52] you, Lord. Bless them in their finances,
[2:05:54] Lord Jesus. Oh, Father God, may they
[2:05:58] tap into the untapped resources, Lord
[2:06:01] God, and pull out of you the things that
[2:06:03] they have need of, Lord. Father, be with
[2:06:05] your children, Lord. Be with Brother
[2:06:07] Timothy and Sister Rahab as they go back
[2:06:09] home or traveling if they're on
[2:06:11] vacation. Bless them abundantly. May
[2:06:13] they have a wonderful time and give them
[2:06:15] rest to their bodies. Lord, be with our
[2:06:17] pastor and all those that's traveling
[2:06:19] back with them, all our brothers and
[2:06:21] sisters that are traveling back. Lord,
[2:06:23] may your grace be with each one. And as
[2:06:25] we prepare to leave this place, but not
[2:06:28] your presence, be with your children. Go
[2:06:30] before each one. May we all go to our
[2:06:32] respective homes safely, Lord, and come
[2:06:35] back at the appointed time, Lord. We
[2:06:37] love you. We praise you. We thank you.
[2:06:40] It's in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[2:06:42] Amen. Amen. You all may have your seats.
[2:06:45] Sister, God bless you. It's good to have
[2:06:47] you in the house of the Lord uh this
[2:06:50] morning.
[2:06:52] I didn't get a chance to get your name,
[2:06:53] but it's good to have you in the house
[2:06:55] of the Lord this morning. God bless you.
