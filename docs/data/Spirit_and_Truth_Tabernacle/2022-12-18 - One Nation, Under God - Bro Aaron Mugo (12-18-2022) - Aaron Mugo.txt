well as our church website john423.org and some of the upcoming events we have sisters [Music] upcoming Christmas service on next next Sunday and the uh uh unfortunate things that we want to be able to be here but the fortunate thing is that will be going to a man of 2015 2045 Vista Parkway which is right down uh the street so keep that in mind we'll be there next Sunday at 10 30. we won't have prayer service there is uh about mounting in prayer but we will be there for 10 30 service so keep that alive so good to see you God bless you [Music] our giving is multiple ways we have for those inside the sanctuary we have a box in the back that you can just drop here uh giving in and of those that are online you can use cash app for sale or PayPal we prefer cash after sale PayPal takes fees we don't like giving up to God to PayPal we want to give it directly to God so cash happens they'll cash423.org and I want to mail something in the address is there at the bottom of the screen I also want to just say today's our final day when we're giving our gift cards this Thursday at the food pantry as I mentioned to you all last week we were as a church we look for opportunities [Music] um have Outreach and we had one sister card when she was here she had me a start coming over there in Ministry where she was living near Pinnacle palms and the Lord called her home and and we were still going for a number of years came to kind of shut things down so we began to pray and ask God where is the next door [Music] to force Ministry to those in our community and the Lord opened up the door for us to have this pantry and so I have to say this there's multiple ways that this this Pantry serves uh one I'll tell you the system I always had my heart go to some of the parks where all these people should take food from school the right person to take off an awesome job amen for a little over a year and a half or something like that uh how long oh almost two years two years has been gone uh one of the other things that that I when we first got the picture that we would do we had these little cars with little inspirational messages that we stick in in the boxes all that was coming from sister alone that was that's ugly the street she had the heart to want to witness the people and she designed this little card so I'm gonna go ahead and place an order I'm gonna place an order for some more cars I'm a leader for next year amen because we wanna we wanna just keep that going but it's just a way for us to kind of get uh uh many different facets Ministry in one place and we want to be very effective there we also talked about doing our Christmas gift cards where we just buy gift cards [Music] may God bless them may God bless them so uh praise the Lord amen we won't have no uh I know what's in that car so [Music] um they the one that needed it amen so we ask that if you if you want to just contribute to that today is the last day that we'll take to get cars that's in the back there you just put your gift cards in the back and we will just share as the Lord us and I personally I think I want to do something I think we got three uh custodians that have kept this place open all throughout the year for us a couple weeks ago they got really upset with us we had a very very long service and I mean it just went that way and then after uh so the last few weeks when we get out they'd be waiting on us like we're gonna close the gate so y'all please please uh just you know don't if you see them trying to get a new car y'all just get the out cards and just try to you know what I'm saying go ahead and cut your conversations amen we want to be respectful I believe in God we ain't gonna have to worry about that much longer worried about that but Brandon said that the people would come and they would uh they'd just love each other so much they didn't want to leave I love having a church like that I love that so uh so but but while we're here let's be subject to those that are you know uh people that are always here they don't have it open for us we really appreciate them I got a prayer request here I want to make mentions this is the capers uh December 28th is having a heart procedure and that ask and pray for God's guidance and protection God's been good I think many times the doctors as to how God just allows her to keep bouncing back and we just we just appreciate God so we want to pray for us as the Capers amen before she has that procedure [Music] lay hands [Music] praise the Lord every head bound Aries [Music] and may she be made [Music] but we even believe that foreign [Music] just a little bit amen God bless you so good to have brother Mike with us amen God is good God is good amen that would be fighting him but he may he's making it by the grace of God amen he's making it by the grace of God amen amen amen praise the Lord good morning God bless you all it's just a pleasure to be here with you this morning always been one to come been here two or three times but we haven't been able to make it over this way and I was thinking about sister Capers and you know the hard metals that we all been through brother cables sister Bernice I tell you uh I want to hear everybody else sing this morning let me sit back but if if you got a gift you want to give to be in operation for Jesus Christ and we'll do the best we can uh you could already tell the boys I say have we gone so it's all right amen but I asked that you keep sister Candace in prayer we put her back in the hospital last night uh she had some surgery done on last Friday and they they're thinking that she may have a blood clot but their main concern is it's a breathing she's breathing so fast that it's like she's supposed to be running and she's not running so that's my buddy amen should take care of a lot of things for me you know and keep me going so I'm just asking that you're a prayer but see we know God is amen we know already what he can do all right amen so all we got to do is believe and we'll believe we'll get exactly what we ask for that sincerity is good uh every all of us I don't want to talk too long but all of us know that the prophet was sincere right right but in that Vision he gave about the little snake striking at his friend's foot brother Brandon said the Holy Spirit told him say if you would be more sincere right right amen so I mean you gotta everything every fiber in you you got to believe God for it ain't it y'all pray for me this morning the sun says God is [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign

[Music] [Applause] [Music] I promise [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] Jesus Christ each it's been a long time since I was here right it feels like a long time you can turn to Genesis 47 while I talk it's Genesis chapter 47. um I I usually try not to say too many things before I preach but I need to say at least two things first off is um I bring greetings from my church and brother Nathan and everybody over there says hello and everything's going well over there it's good to see that the spirit's still with us over here too we're all part of the same body that's right um and the second thing is uh recently I'm sure a lot of you know my mother passed away and uh we went to the funeral in Kenya and it was a difficult time but it was great to see how the children of God pulled together and support of us and not only with prayers and you know thoughts but also some people contributed money to help us to travel and run back and forth I just wanted to say thank you because it meant a lot to me and also my wife and my family anybody who was texting us their their prayers and everything I was showing my siblings and their minds were blown away they didn't know how many people I knew over here I didn't know how many people love me like that so it was great to see that um but yeah those are the two things um can not only this church but just Believers all over the place in different countries were helping us so I just wanted to say thank you all right so we're going to Genesis 47 verse 13. um we're going to read up to verse 17 then you can sit down um so actually to preface this it's actually right after the children of Israel that is Jacob's other Sons followed Joseph into Egypt so the Pharaoh had just settled them into the land of Egypt he gave him the best land that he had and he told them to watch over their livestock so um while this is going on with the Israelites there's something going on with the Egyptians which is what we're going to look at here that's verse 13. and there was no bread in all the land but the famine was very sore so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the corn which they bought and Joseph brought the money into the fair's house and when money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan all the Egyptians came unto Joseph and said give a spread for why should we die in thy presence for the money faileth and Joseph said give your cattle and I will give you for your cattle if money fail and they brought their cattle into Joseph and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses and for the flocks and for the cattle of the herds and for the asses and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year all right you may be seated thank you foreign in this scripture you see the Egyptians were actually put in a very tight position and they they were already housing the people of the people of God's promise you know the ones that God had called and called out and given them a promise that he would give them some land and they're housing these people and they're not on their land and and while they're housing them uh the Egyptians themselves are starting to starve and they come to this desperate situation and they start trying to feed their kids they're trying to feed themselves and while they're trying to do this they realize that they're the the money that they actually hold in their hands that they held at Value before it actually becomes no more value and they come to Joseph and to Pharaoh because they're the rulers and they say hey we will give you everything we have just to have food so they're willing they're at a position where they're lacking something in their lives and they're willing to give up something that is their own property just to get that thing and they they already determined what the value of that thing was by offering that up in the first place so they were really desperate in this situation so uh Joseph he's just doing his best to please the Pharaoh and he says all right give me the cattle I take it and you know uh and then you will have food I'll give you some of the food that we stored up if you go on it doesn't stop there it goes to Genesis 47 still the same chapter verse 18. when the year when the year was ended they came unto him the second year and said unto him we will not hide it from my Lord how that our money is spent so this is one year later my Lord also half our herds of cattle keep in mind the children of Israel are now hurting the cattle because their job was to watch the livestock so the children of Israel now have all the cattle of all the Egyptians and they just got there and they're watching them you can understand how they became slaves later my Lord also hath our herds of cattle there is not all left in the sight of my Lord but our bodies and our lands wherefore shall we die before Thine Eyes both we in our land buy us in our land for bread and we in our land will be servants unto pharaoh and give a seed that we may live and not die that the land be made desolate and Joseph bought all the land Affairs Egypt for Pharaoh for the Egyptians sold every man his field because the famine prevailed over them so the land became Pharaoh see if you read in those verses you might miss the fact that they not only did they give up the land that was theirs they gave up their own bodies over time they actually gave everything they had even their right to just be alive see after a while Joseph actually starts telling the Egyptians hey you're gonna go live over there and you're gonna go live over there and they didn't have a choice because they'd sold their bodies for some food giving up their rights that they were supposed to have as Egyptians you would think as Egyptians that they're going to demand more rights from their Pharaoh but they are not instead they're letting the the Israelites live above them even though um they're the ones who were born Egyptians that's not actually where I was headed but you can see how they became slaves wow you see how Generations later you're just looking out there and you see wow these people are eating from the pharaoh's table for free watching our livestock and they're free they can come and go as they like but we're over here starving and giving up everything that we have just for our own rights that we have a right to wow if you go into Genesis 47 27. and Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt in the country of Goshen and they had possessions therein and grew and multiplied exceedingly so God is still blessing his children because he gave him that promise they are actually in the land of the Gentiles and God is continuing to bless them in that place he's actually taking something from the Gentiles to give to them because he gave them a promise that that's theirs see we're living in a time of all sorts of crises is going on it could be economical it could be spiritual it could be just a lack of morality but God will make sure you have an abundance in your life if you just cling to that promise that he gave you so right there it doesn't matter what situation you're in he's going to take care of you amen amen so right now uh that back then you can see how the children of Israel being treated as a nation and uh God gave them a promise as a nation but we are actually individuals and God deals with us deals with us that way so um brother Branham actually said that nowadays God is dealing with you in your spirit as an individual so he'll take one from one house one from one family take home and it doesn't matter who you were born to he's going to pick you out and he'll deal with you as an individual so uh Israel actually whenever uh Jesus came in the New Testament he was trying to speak of them on these things and they had no concept of that because they weren't looking at the world with spiritual eyes see the law that they were given by Moses was a physical law that they had to do with their hands and the promises they were given were as a nation so they could look around and they're looking for the promises from God with their eyes they're looking for a spiritual they're looking for sorry um economic wealth they're looking for things in their hands that God is blessing them with that they can hold and tangibly see with their eyes but they completely forgot that there's a spiritual thing inside of you that God can bless God can bless your spirit he can bless your soul he can give you so many different fruits of the spirit and things like that but they didn't understand that they didn't have that concept so when Jesus comes he's actually speaking to them in Matthew 21 verse 43 it says therefore I say unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof so the kingdom of God was actually taken from the Israelites and given to someone else so if we continue in Peter uh first Peter 2 9 this is after Jesus is already resurrected so Peter has this Revelation and he's speaking to us as as the as the Gentiles now and he's saying he understands that Jesus was talking about a turning point where the the kingdom of God was handing was getting handed over from the Israelites to us so he says but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and the part I want to underline here is a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light so a holy nation here it's not it's not something you can see keep in mind it's the we are Gentiles so we should look for things that we can't see and see what Jesus is talking about to see what the word's talking about I want to hear what he's speaking to me about as an individual so if he's calling me a holy nation it's not like in the concept of the a lot of people in the Middle East like Pakistan and India and you know Israel itself they still think of them as a nation and they think of their religion as a religion for the whole nation so they start waging what they call a holy war against each other you might have heard something or a religious War it's saying hey the Muslims need to live over there and the Jews are going to live over here or the Hindus are going to live over there and they're going to be in their country we're going to be over here that's not what God is talking about right here he's saying it's a holy nation in this holy nation like I said it's that Holiness that comes from Christ and it's inside of you that's the holy nation he's talking about so all those fruits of the spirit are his holiness inside of you his Holiness inside of us as his children right we we just have to take on his Holiness and allow it to affect our lives not only that but it also needs to affect those people around us see there are people like me who are immigrants does anybody here descended from them right now independence I mean everybody is right come on hands higher come on please I only see two okay well you see I I'm pretty sure there are more of us but all of us were not born in America and came from Americans the only people who were are technically I think Native Americans so everybody should have raised their hand right there whether you wanted to or not and you have to realize that your people that you're descended from came from another place out there this is not where you're supposed to be from and I'm not just saying that because we're all black I mean it's obvious I mean most of us are um but you know it's if you have to honestly see it on your face you look at you look a certain way anybody can tell like hey going back to the beginning of time you're not from here and the Bible tells us that we're all children of Abraham right you got to realize spiritually speaking you are from somewhere else so whenever people look at you different because you look different or act different it's not because oh I'm just from another country where my my descendants is not from another country they're going to look at you weird because we're Christians amen we come from our Heavenly fathers somewhere else we're born to look like we're from somewhere else see I was raised in a certain way whenever I was actually whenever my first memories are from being here in the United States my parents are Kenyan so um looking like I am you think I get along with black Americans but I don't know you know I'm probably one of the whitest black Americans I know I guess and I'm not just saying it for a joke it's a fact and growing up that's one of the first things I remember we're just weird and then we'd bring friends home and then they meet our appearances like why do they talk like that they're they're African I'm sorry and then after a while when I'm seven years old eight we go to the Kenya and we start living there and I start growing up and then it's like whoa you guys you are in Kenyan you sound weird because I sounded like this and I didn't know how to fake a Kenyan accent and I couldn't speak Swahili I didn't know any of those things and they're still looking at me like oh you're weird not just me my siblings too all of us were like that we couldn't get along with everybody anybody so we look different and then eventually I get older and I'm 19 years old I'm like wow I'm gonna go back to America everybody's gonna sound like me and I come over here and I had an interesting little weird Kenyan accent you guys never met me in those years but it was awkward and I was 19 years old and I still felt weird because the people I talked to they don't understand where I came from had grown up in Kenya and whenever I was here I I my parents were Kenyan right and I didn't understand the same things they understood and then here now that I've been here long enough I go back to Kenya and asked Becca I wasn't on point last week the last couple weeks I didn't understand everything I would go back home and complain to her like oh my goodness these Kenyans are weird because that's just not what I'm like and I don't know why I'm like this I know that I have somebody I can lean to because because those people who I met they were telling me hey you're not you're not black American enough or you're not American enough or when I go over there you're not Kenyan enough and then I come back over here I'm too American for them over there and it's back and forth and it's never enough for people but if you realize you go to the word and you actually come to God you're enough for him no matter where you're from you don't it doesn't matter what your history is it doesn't matter what sins you committed in the past or what your what your family did in the past you are from somewhere and you realize your heavenly kingdom is where you're from right now you can claim that right now you have representation because Christ's spirit is inside of you you recognize that that is your new history you open the Bible and you see what Moses and did what Moses did and what Elijah did that's your history those are your people right there anybody who accepts the word of God is your people I'm surrounded by my brothers and sisters they might not understand all my National History but they understand that there's a seed inside of me that's inside of them too and we're related whether we look like it or not it doesn't matter what people tell me finally the word of God tells me that I'm enough exactly how I've come to him I'm enough exactly the way I am not only that but he's gonna make me better he's gonna make me more like him amen amen now brother Branham actually felt the same thing and I had some quotes along those lines um 1964 the unveiling of God says now notice how many American citizens is here raise up your hands I tried that a minute ago it didn't work all right you are an American citizen then you are identified with this nation whatever this nation is you must be is that right you are all of her glory and you are all of her shame you're identified with her you are an American so you take on America when I was I was with George Washington when he crossed the Delaware I'm identified with him that's right I was with Abraham Lincoln at the Gettysburg Address I was standing there I was with the soldiers in Guam you boys when you hosted the flag I was there I'm an American I'm identified with it now to be an American whatever her shame is in the red in the Revolutionary I bear it because I'm an American right there he's talking about Americans having shame in their history see a lot of us were born here you know and you can't help the fact that this is where you're born you can't help the fact that that is your history now he's talking about Americans having shame because America does have a shameful history there are a lot of things back there that they should not have done and things that they should have done they started well as a Godly country and then they changed a whole bunch of things in a different way so he's talking about there being shame in there but if you realize if you actually if you're really centered in the word and you recognize that's your new history then his shame is my shame you got to realize the reproach for his name comes on me and the shame that the shame that Americans go through is a different kind of Shame entirely they just did something wrong in their history God never did anything wrong but if I stand for his word well enough eventually reproach will come on me that's that chain that's gonna hit you and as a Christian I'm identified with him amen I was with Noah when he went in the ark I was with Moses when he came out of Egypt I was with Elijah and Mark Caldwell glory to God I was with him when he did that I was truly with him I identified myself in his death there on Calvary when I died to the things of the world you see that that death he's talking about Christ does it so I do it it's in Christ's spirit so it's in my spirit I have to die out to what my history is I have to die out to what my nationality is what my race or whatever Creed is that I was raised under I have to die out to that and then I take on his Spirit praise God I was identified with him I was identified with him on Easter morning when he rose from the dead I was identified with him on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came down like a rushing Mighty Wind I was identified with him all that he was I am all that I am he was like amen being dead in him we are identified with him what he is I am amen what this nation is I am I'm proud to be that I'm ready to Bear her shame I'm ready to Bear her approach to be American that's right and I'm double that to Jesus Christ amen can we all say the same thing this morning whatever he has for me and whatever people do to me for serving him I'm just gonna take it that's okay because I'm in the King's Highway right there all that he ever was I am I like to be identified with him also what was the Holy Ghost given for 1959 but you got the nature of the place you're from see he's not denying that we have a nature of where we're from Americans act a certain way you know Europeans act a certain way you know it doesn't even have to go that far Floridians act a certain way from other people people from Georgia act a different way people in different cities act a different way from somebody else in the city next door and you can't change that people from different families act a different way sometimes you look at a family like I don't know how you guys function you know and it it's just like that and you can't change that that's their nature and their kids are going to have the same thing I think there's this story uh brother Branham told about talking about a German boy and German parents it's in there you can't get it out God can see he can he can sand off those rough edges right there and he can take care of those things and replace it with things that that are his attributes he can give you his attributes that's what I'm trying to say a Roman comes over here he scratches his head and a German comes over here American goes over there why you got the spirits of them countries you're from and that's what makes it so much different to the world you're from above you are born you're a citizen of another kingdom you believe it that's what the Holy Ghost is is to make you a citizen of another kingdom then if you are a citizen of the kingdom of God how does it make you act like God does in his kingdom see it's God's kingdom he's acting in a certain way because it's his kingdom you ever hear something that should give you a pep in your step yeah it's my kingdom all that's around me it's my father's and it's coming to me so that should give me a little pep in my step not to be proud but to realize where you're standing and where you're walking you're going to inherit everything around you God's Gonna burn away this whole world system and he's gonna leave what is his and you're going to be able to inherit that that's all yours whatever you see around you now what does God do in his kingdom it's Holiness righteousness purity of thought purity of mind power and love going to the Lost Healing The Sick performing Miracles doing great things then to the world you look crazy and they say them guys are off their head but you're a citizen of the Kingdom uh Israel in the church 1953 he says God don't respect me because I'm American he doesn't respect a German because he's German or a Poland because he's from Poland he doesn't respect the African because he's from Africa God's not interested in Africa neither is he interested in Germany nor neither is he interested in the United States God's interested in one Kingdom and that's the kingdom and that's a kingdom of God and man from All Nations come into it and they're born into it through the Seed of Abraham which was Jesus Christ in their heirs according to the promise every nation under the heaven is dominated by Satan you got to realize not only every nation but any culture that you're from dominated by Satan it didn't come from God so it has to come from somewhere any family that you're from and family attributes that's dominated by Satan see there are good things that come from our cultures there are excellent things good values great things that are taught from most cultures you'll find good qualities but if they don't line up with God's word are they good where'd they come from that means they came from down there every nation under the heaven is dominated by Satan that includes any political system dominated by Satan some people seem to think that whoever they vote for is gonna save them from something that they made up in their mind you got to realize anything that's on this Earth that can harm you God will take you through there is nobody you can vote for that will save you there's nobody that gets in the office that God doesn't put there in the first place I'm not saying don't vote I mean by all means I don't but I don't think it's that Christians shouldn't vote I'm just saying what's the point but every nation under the heaven is dominated by Satan like what is there that I'm gonna do with my little vote I'm just gonna pray that's how I cast my vote you know uh even if you see that the word that the land you're in is dominated by Satan you know uh the Hebrews um I think it was probably Daniel I can't remember which no Jeremiah I remember it was Jeremiah Jeremiah he prophesied about Israel being taken captive by Babylon a long time before it happened and his prophecies were very people call him the weeping prophet because here we've got these prophecies and they'd go against what anybody who had to hear he'd talk about the Doom of Israel and how they become captives and nobody wanted to hear that but one thing he said was whenever your captors take you to Babylon because he knew it was going to happen he said when they take you pray for your rulers we're talking about Nebuchadnezzar he came in and crushed Israel he crushed them he killed all of their princes in front of their families killed their families in front of them completely burned down took down sections of Israel and when they got taken captive he says pray for him I believe we should pray for our leaders I pray for I pray I mean I don't do it often enough but I believe we should I believe we should pray for our leaders because even though we're here in Babylon right now God would like to bless us where we are not only that but he can bless your nation and bless you by proxy if you just pray for your leadership I still don't vote though I don't care 1959 what was the Holy Ghost given for you're an alien and you're a stranger you do strange things different what you used to do you don't act like you used to the people the Holy Ghost when it comes upon you and you become filled with the Holy Ghost you ignore the things of the world you ignore the things that would beset you you ignore it then you become an odd looking odd acting creature the ugly ducking duckling to them the little Eagle that was hatched under the Hen's Nest that I preached and when the eagle Stars its nest you're a funny looking creature to them if God is the God of War oh this is a Havana if God is a god of one God he's God of all all his creation yes sir and so she looked you know race and tribe and color had nothing to do with it God made them all God of one man made all nations out of Adam there we find out that the color of the skin in their tradition and church membership had nothing to do with it it's an honest heart he's looking for so actually I want to turn the corner right here I think we belong to a nation and actually worldwide it's an interesting thing that everybody's talking about um what their rights are that's a big political issue you know and they just want to fight over who I want a transgender rights or gay rights or you know second amendment rights or First Amendment rights Free Speech right to carry weapons everybody wants to talk about that in the news and you know it only takes you looking in the word to realize where that's coming from first of all it's their father the devil yes um it's a spirit of the age but second I actually noticed in the uh churches book uh chapter nine when he's talking about laodicea uh it's describing the city first it says notice the name I'm pretty sure you guys have gone over this a few times because brother Jack's a great teacher I think you've gone over that church age book a few times it says notice the name laodicea the people's rights or Justice of the peoples was there ever an age like the 20th century Church age or 21st now that we're here that has seen all nations rising up and demanding equality socially and financially this is the age of the Communists where all men are supposedly equal though it is only so in theory this is the age of political parties who call themselves Christian democrats Christian socialists Christian Commonwealth Federation Etc according to our liberal theologians Jesus was a socialist and and the early church under the guidance of the spirit practiced socialism and thus we ought to do so today when the Ancients called laodicea the Metropolis it was looking forward to the One World Government that we are now setting up and as we think of that City being the location of a great church Council we see foreshadow The ecumenical move taking place today wherein very soon we will see all the so-called Christians come together indeed the church and state religion and politics are coming together the tares are being bound the wheat will soon be ready for the Garner so I started looking at that and I was actually thinking um they uh every country has a list of Rights of its citizens and according to the modern idea of what a country is and how it should work uh the Egyptians back there were actually giving up their rights that they should just have they should have had rights to their land right to their own property they should have had the right not to starve because any leader nowadays should be keeping their feet people from dying from starvation you know you would think even the right to their lives and I just started thinking you know every nation has rights like that and I've already talked to you about how we're a spiritual nation of Christians but I started looking in the word and trying to find the rights of Christians and how that works uh the first one I had was right to pray for the sick and this is interesting because at first growing up I used to think you know you go to church and at the end of the service somebody walks up here and gets prayed for they lay hands on her you know everybody makes a sad face and pray for her and then they go or him and I was just like wait a second you know when I actually started thinking about this I was like I didn't you don't have to walk up here first off and it doesn't have to be a minister to lay hands on that although that is part of ministry it doesn't have to be a minister to do that see us as Christians sitting in the Pew even before I got ordained to preach I could have prayed for anybody not only that but I didn't have to touch them I could have just prayed for my house I could have prayed lying down God never said you couldn't pray lying down sometimes I'm in bed and I pray sometimes I'm driving and I pray you know you don't have to close your eyes you know just talk to him that's what he wants that's what he did this for you know so the first one right to pray for the sick make sure to take your rights first one uh the trial 1964 it says every person that believes has a right to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover next one healing what sicknesses Divine healings in reach of every person and every person that is a Christian has a right to pray for the sick Divine Healing it doesn't have to be some great thing that somebody has that gift for you to pray for them I think probably the majority of healings that happen in church is just because people were praying for them it wasn't because some Divine healer came and prayed it's like oh I have the gift of praying for this thing otherwise you don't get don't get healed I don't believe that I really don't believe that the authority of the word 1953 and not only the pastor but every member of the church has a right to pray for the sick the gift of healing works in the church the entire church not only in the pastor all right much as your pastor may have the gift of healing and you may want to go to him to have your him lay your hands on lay his hands on you and do all that stuff it's okay it's okay if you call somebody up because they have the gift because God put that gift in the church in the first place but it's not only on that person each one of you at the future home each one of you has the right to heal the sick lay your hands upon the sick every one of you has the right to baptize that's another one right in there you just slid it in there right to be healed that's the next one as I was with Moses every called child of God every Minister that's ordained of God has a right for a healing campaign if he wants it go on brother I don't blame you I was looking and seeing little little groups here in there that say well there's too many of them no there's not every one of them is having success in some way you see that actually he he does talk about I think his brother Tommy Osborne who did not have a gift of healing and he came to brother Brandon he was like asking what he should do for his ministry and eventually Tommy Osborne what he does is he just sets the atmosphere in the congregation where he's preaching and then he goes over the scriptures and by the end of that people just started getting healed amen he didn't operate the way brother Branham did he recognized he didn't have that gift of healing but he did have the gift of ministering he could preach and apparently he could teach because they learned that their healing was there in the word next slide and every person can be healed glory to God for it that's right everyone it's a good thing another one Psalm 103 2-3 bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases see there's nothing that's not captured up in there all your all your injuries he will also heal there's nothing that'll hurt nothing that'll get you that the devil can throw at you that's a right right there to your healing amen Faith 1953 you've seen the old hymn God has promised it it's ours every man and woman here has a right right now to claim your healing amen I don't know who who brother Mike lesson sister Candace I think also she needs healing right now he could be listening to this right now we have the right we exercise the right right now to pray for her everybody who was in your seat praying for her exercised their rights it didn't take the person over here behind the mic brother Jack it didn't take him and she has the right to receive it if she'll just understand and believe it she has that right to receive that there are other people who are asking for things right now all right God will give you what he promised you it's not even that hard to comprehend it's super easy right to receive the Holy Ghost now I know a lot of people who don't have it they just sit there quietly but this is for you not only is it for you it's for it's for those people praying for others to receive the Holy Ghost is praying for your family who's out there lost in the world because you know I think it's uh Paul whenever he was talking to a Roman soldier he said something about uh if you believe you and your house will be saved you see that's promised right there it says you and your house there are a lot of us right now who are praying for people who are out in the world who are in your house parents praying for children children God forbid praying for parents it's like God help them God go after them and I said uh last time I preached this I said um I don't know who was talking and they said that prayer not might not be answered while you're alive as some parents are just praying for their kids and it's like oh no I'm gonna pass and who's gonna pray for them now it's like sometimes God will answer your prayer after you pass sometimes it'll take your passing to turn things around for them you know a lot of things change in my family when my mom passed because I'm a preacher and she was the most spiritual person in our house she got me beat ten times over she prayed for us so much her kids by name a year to the date before she passed my grandma passed she used to pray for all of her grandchildren by name she wasn't even a message believer she was a Seventh-Day Adventist and she prayed for each one of them that's that's something to live up to right there I don't even know how to follow that act but they believed in the promise right there all right right to receive the Holy Ghost so uh Believe In Style this 1951 for every believer that'll break behind the curtain Yonder and enter into this priesthood has a right to eat of the original Mana that fell on the day of Pentecost a real old-fashioned Holy Ghost blessing Hallelujah all right also I am the resurrection and the life 1952. then today if God's still calling every man or woman that comes to the Fountain blood uh fountain filled with blood from drawn from Emmanuel's veins and becomes a priest or a child a born-again a born child of God in the kingdom of God has a right to the original baptism of the Holy Ghost not a mouthful but a whole soul full of the same power that fell on the day of Pentecost so I'm just going through these rights because a lot of people don't know their rights like I don't I don't know all the rights in the Bill of Rights I don't I only know the first two because everybody fights about them and when I went to Kenya actually I I grew up in the Kenyan school system and I went to Kenya and I was actually reading them uh a list of their rights Kenyan rights from the Kenyan Constitution because I had to look that up over there and they didn't even know that they didn't know their own rights as Kenyans and I realized that a lot of people come into Christianity and they don't recognize that they have rights you know being a child of God should give you rights disprofessing his name gives you rights doing that some things come after you get the Holy Ghost some things come after you get baptized just profess his name and start walking on the journey you know speak to the Rock 1953 brother every man or woman that comes into this Divine Holy Ghost priesthood has a right to get a genuine heart full of the original baptism of the Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost the same signs the same power the same demonstration same feeling same action not something that looks like it the original that's right Church eight book uh actually back in Ephesus what the church had at Pentecost is her inalienable right originally she had the pure word of God she had the power of the spirit manifested in diver signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost so the church being an alien inalienable to those rights you gotta you gotta realize inalienable actually I had a definition of that it says unable to be taken away from or given away by the processor so you have it and whether you know it or not it's sticking with you and it's never going anywhere whether you know it or not and I love the example they have there freedom of religion the most inalienable right of all human rights the most inalienable beautiful the next one it's a right to choose a spouse the choosing of a bride 1965 there's another choice that we have in life that's a life's companion a young man or a young woman stepping out on life has been given a right to make a choice the young man chooses the young woman has a right to accept or reject it but it's still a choice on both sides both man and woman they have a right to Choice see I understand that you read that and you might think oh it's just people doing arranged marriages that's what but there's people who do that now in church who they may not say that it's arranged that's all right but they may narrow down the options significantly for who their child dates and that's not something you should do be on a certain point your child is 25 30 years old and you're like oh you can't date them what is that about and not only that but young people you should recognize you have a choice I'm not saying liberate yourself from your parents because your parents advice is a good thing but you have a choice it doesn't mean that you go out looking with the eyes of your parents on who they would date that's how people marry their parents basically you know you just find somebody who's exactly like your dad or exactly like your mom and you just go marry them because you looked with eyes of your parents look with eyes of you you know God Gave You spiritual eyes you should think and look exercise your right that's something you got to do exercise your right your parents aren't going to live with them in fact they're going to pass eventually and you're gonna be right there living with them you exercise your right poorly so that works for no matter what country you're from Brother Jack it doesn't matter right to approach the father that's to pray uh this is the right to pray right here Hebrews chapter 4 6 14-16 seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with a feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come bold me boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need you can boldly come to the throne of grace why are toss people tossed about in 1956 when Jesus died at Calvary he ripped the veil from top to bottom to give not only high priest but to everyone that comes approaching God has a right to the holiest of holies wait I probably skipped some a word there or something she has a right the lady there dying has a right they I could have cut out those last two sentences but I left them in there because it doesn't matter how bad your situation is you could be lying there dying and you have a right a right to pray the devil can't take that away from you he could lock you in prison and keep you from moving he could keep you in a solitary confinement spiritually or physically speaking keep you from talking to people trying to stop you from praying solitary confinement doesn't keep you from praying talk to God you could be mute and you can still talk to God he can hear your thoughts right to communion the communion 1957 we have an open communion for all for we believe that every believer has a right to the table of the Lord and to Fellowship around the good things of God with every believer regardless of creed color or whatever he may be or she that all have been made to drink of the self-same blessing Christ right to Salvation Jehovah Jireh 1955 he can't every Mortal being has a right and has a right to accept their salvation until they die and go beyond the blood they don't have to stand in judgment they're already judged the day you eat thereof that day you die but as long as you're here you got a right to the tree of life if you'll accept it amen I think foreign just a moment oh yeah this is on the same lines in John chapter 11. uh Caiaphas is uh is actually prophesying about Jesus because the spirit of God since he was a high priest that year he was prophesying because God was using him to speak to the people and uh it says in verse 49 and one of them named caiaph is being the high priest that same year said unto them ye know nothing at all nor consider that is it exp that it is expedient of for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perished not you realize that's what gave you that right was Christ dying for us in the first place another one uh in slide 115 actually right to all Redemptive blessings the principles of Divine Healing now when then he put on Calvary those great things in every and here it is I hope you see it look every Christian believer has a right to any of those Redemptive blessings that Christ Jesus died for amen amen there you go but it's out of practice people's afraid to take God at his word do not be afraid God's under obligation to make it so see the only person you can fault for not exercising your rights is actually yourself because he gave you a book full of them and he he told you in his word through his Prophet repeatedly most of what I'm reading right here is just quotes like it's not just in the scripture it's actually quotes he's told you in multiple ways and he's telling you right now he's telling me if we don't exercise these rights hey exactly it's our own fault we're making life harder on ourselves not recognizing where we're from so actually I was looking at this and I was recognizing okay we're all Americans here and uh most of us are and um if you're in America you get you you you might have heard some American history and like I said they started as a Christian Nation and um they had a tyrant who was ruling them and I don't remember what his name like King George yeah King George III thank you and um he was ruling them and he was taxing them and they didn't even have a representation he was taking a lot from them they had no rights compared to actually actual English citizens in England but at that point everybody was part of England at least in the colonies here so they recognized that they're in a bad position and they recognize that there's a tyrant that's trying to oppress them and what they do is they write a declaration of independence and I went and read the Declaration of Independence and I started to notice that there's a lot of similarity there for what we do to get rid of Satan that's tricks amen so I started trying to paraphrase a few things and actually the musicians can come back while I read this you can all stand um the Declaration of Independence the Christian version amen it says we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator were certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness I haven't changed anything yet that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the government yet to consent for God to govern you for him to change your life that whenever any form of government I still haven't paraphrased anything uh this is all verbatim as far as I know that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and to Institute new government here is totally paraphrased I'm going to say what the devil has done because they said what King George did back to them that caused them to write a declaration of independence they knew the second they made that declaration it was going to be War it wasn't War before it was war right when they made that declaration this is not going to be easy but you got to make it for yourself whether you've accepted it or not you need to take that step recognize the war is coming he has deceived the children of God into believing Jesus Christ is not the same today as yesterday he has imposed diseases and afflictions on the people and caused them to doubt their healing he has tempted us with many Temptations He has used his power to block stop or challenge any move of God Among Us he has increased his armies and minions against us he has failed to date to show any remorse for any of the stated actions nor expressed any desire to change I think that one was verbatim that wasn't me in every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for deliverance in the most humble terms that's a mistake right there are repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury injury you see the problem with some people is they try to debate with the devil you know they see where they're born and they see that the world's messed up and their lives are messed up and they try to reason with it and try to use that world system to change their own lives but see we already talked about it the the devil Satan dominates the entire uh all nations are dominated by the devil you know and they're his systems in the first place so instead of bargaining with them back here our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury why are you trying to bargain with him he's not going to help you he's not going to let you go he won't even give you an inch a prince whose character is thus marked by Every Act which may Define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people that those two slides were verbatim wow that wasn't me wow but it did put me in mind of the scripture John 12 31 now is the Judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out and I make that declaration today this morning he's gonna be cast out if you want him to be if you want to exercise your rights let's cast him out yeah back to the Declaration we therefore the assembled brothers and sisters in Fellowship appealing to the Supreme judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions due in the name and by the authority of the blood Jesus the blood of Jesus Christ solemnly publish and declare that our bodies and souls and Spirits ought to be free in independent states that they are absolved from all allegiance to Satan that all connections between us in the adversary are totally dissolved and that is free and independent Christians they have full power to baptize pray for the sick approach the father obtain healing commune with the Brethren choose a spouse receive the Holy Ghost and to do all other acts and things which children of God might rightfully do and for the support of this declaration with a firm Reliance on the protection of Divine Providence we mutually pledge to Jesus Christ Our lives our fortunes and our secret honor all right you can start playing um foreign [Music] attention started because there were the Emancipation Proclamation I think was given Abraham Lincoln and emancipated all the slaves but a lot of the slaves did not know and I think it was like two years later in Galveston Texas he had to send a Union Army to afford to go and declare to those leaves thank you I don't know everybody knows a period in church before they have their personal uh experience with Christ [Music] but I don't and I'm just sitting here it's for all of us so the next question is like do you recognize it and are you going to apply it right now so they're ahead of you but it doesn't matter God doesn't count years of service he doesn't care about that he doesn't care about your age he wants you the way you are so what are you doing [Music] it's for you hello [Music] showed us something about living it's worth every effort to come to serve us alone not only that but please good things it's just exceptions we can't continue Jesus Christ [Music] foreign [Music] breaks away I found out [Music] I am free free this world is awesome in the blood of Jesus [Music] show me all right sound real good one more time good night foreign [Music] [Music] I just didn't know some of us that were here in different situations that may be in our life uh you have a right to be free you don't have to stay in that condition no matter what you know that was a tricked you and trapped you into you don't have to stay there as a son and daughter of God celebrates amen and I pray to exercise your rights and then like like brother Aaron said when you uh when you declare uh your your Independence is gonna be wrong get ready for the war and you can look back and just map your history when the U.S declared the independence amen [Music] amen and you won't lose either I can take it that much right now blessed be the name of the Lord amen today just got a prayer request mention of my brother I know I've known I understand [Music] amenities [Music] he loses his mother [Music] for God this is the time in life where they'll look down and only see one set of footprints in the stands but hold me they realize that this time that you were carrying them [Music] for times I pray that you'll be their strength that somehow you'll turn their water into dancing even how we heard today that sometimes I love what is lost and it brings the family together Lord I just pray that you would just get Glory and Honor out of this Lord that you give strength to both he and his
