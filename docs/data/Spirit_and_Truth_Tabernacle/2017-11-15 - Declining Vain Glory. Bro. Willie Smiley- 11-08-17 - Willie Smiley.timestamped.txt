[29:38] good to be back in the house of the Lord
[29:42] again and I had a wonderful you know I
[29:46] was just saying I think that these
[29:49] services was kind of ordained of God God
[29:53] knows exactly we're gonna look at second
[29:55] Corinthians chapter 12 God knows exactly
[29:59] what each and every one of us needs and
[30:03] he gives us what we need right it at the
[30:06] right time you know you say he's an aunt
[30:08] I'm God and you know had such a
[30:12] wonderful time on Sunday morning it just
[30:15] kind of spilled over into our little
[30:18] communion service there at home and it's
[30:23] just starting to spill over again you
[30:25] know y'all do you know anything about
[30:26] your cup running over
[30:29] y'all don't know that about that maybe
[30:32] y'all tired and sleepy and all of that
[30:34] and I worked out then I drove our home
[30:38] and an hour and a half here and I just I
[30:41] just feel like my cup just running over
[30:43] it it's just and I if it if it it if
[30:46] it'll just run off on somebody else and
[30:49] then they cup I'll get the running ball
[30:51] tell you what we have revival we'll have
[30:55] a revival in here we I think summer
[30:57] break out we'd go out that dose people
[30:59] in Holland all Lord help us help us help
[31:03] us Jesus I don't know what I would do
[31:06] right now cuz I fool I tell you I don't
[31:10] know whether I want to talk a crowd
[31:11] preach or what I might do all of the
[31:14] above before it's all over with but I
[31:17] was just saying how much I really needed
[31:22] it and man I just cried like a baby when
[31:24] I went the church I left here I was
[31:27] still excited and I'm excited now but I
[31:31] just remember brother Jack in prayer
[31:33] trust that you make it home safely quite
[31:38] sure y'all missing him by now man we
[31:43] want to start the first verse maybe not
[31:47] so much of a familiar scripture to most
[31:49] of us we probably have read the
[31:52] scriptures before but maybe we have
[31:55] preached on it tonight we want to start
[31:58] at the first verse it says it is it is
[32:01] not expedient for me doubtless to glory
[32:04] I will come to visions and revelations
[32:07] of the Lord since I knew a man in Christ
[32:10] above fourteen years ago whether in the
[32:13] body I cannot tell or whether out of the
[32:16] body I cannot tell God knoweth such a
[32:19] one caught up to the third heaven and I
[32:23] knew such a man whether in the body or
[32:25] out of the body I cannot tell God know
[32:28] of how that he was caught up into
[32:30] paradise and heard unspeakable words
[32:33] which is not lawful for a man to utter
[32:38] or such a one where like glory yet of
[32:43] myself I will not glory but in my
[32:46] infirmities for though I would desire to
[32:49] glory I shall not be a fool for I will
[32:54] say the truth but now I forbear lest any
[32:59] man should think of me above that which
[33:02] he see if me to be or that he heareth of
[33:07] me unless I should be exalted above
[33:09] measure through the abundance of the
[33:11] revelation that was given to me a thorn
[33:14] in the flesh the messenger of Satan to
[33:16] bucket me lest I should be exalted above
[33:21] measure many Lord had a blessing to read
[33:26] I was worried you may be seated
[33:28] we want to use as a little title this
[33:30] morning the decline in vain glory I was
[33:35] attempting to preach on this on last
[33:38] Thursday night at home and so we all
[33:42] just pray for us as we just try to make
[33:46] sense out of the scripture and trust
[33:48] that we can give us something that I'm
[33:50] helpless in the hour that we're living
[33:52] in I want to start out just looking at
[33:56] the Apostle Paul in a couple of the
[34:03] chapters and a lot of the writers in the
[34:06] book of second Corinthians it's because
[34:09] of the many issues that Paul had with
[34:14] with the church that he established and
[34:20] you know you you would think now I guess
[34:23] that's just in the way that I think
[34:25] about things but you you would you would
[34:28] think that with a ministry like Paul had
[34:32] and and and the depth of understanding
[34:35] and things of that nature that you know
[34:39] people would just really gravitate
[34:41] towards them and really be anchored and
[34:47] and just come to church on five
[34:50] you know just the thought of Paul you
[34:54] know but but it's not like that
[34:56] I think people sometimes they we get a
[35:00] misconception as it relates to church it
[35:06] should be that way but it's not because
[35:09] we have an enemy that we're fighting the
[35:13] devil don't want you I'm just gonna say
[35:16] you know the devil don't want y'all to
[35:18] be a nice wonderful group of people he
[35:21] he do not want us to be on fire tonight
[35:26] he's gonna try everything he possibly
[35:29] can to keep us from being on fire
[35:33] Paul was was was the the and I'd like to
[35:37] look at this because it gives us
[35:41] something to look at and the man I've
[35:44] been thinking about this I couldn't
[35:45] sleep last night thinking about this
[35:47] thing I was studying it a little bit I
[35:50] was telling a guy on the job the day I
[35:52] said man I started studying some more
[35:54] last night on it that thing with the bed
[35:57] with me I couldn't sleep I was just dead
[35:59] and thought after thought was just kind
[36:02] of coming to me as I was trying to sleep
[36:05] but I you know and I was telling this to
[36:07] the church last week I was saying you
[36:09] know as Christians you know we we need a
[36:15] mirror or we need some somebody that's
[36:20] living something that we could point at
[36:23] and said that's the life of price that's
[36:26] that's the manifestation of God in a
[36:29] vessel we've heard sermons you know and
[36:34] we hear sermons we've heard sermons
[36:36] we've heard great preachers preach and
[36:39] things of that nature but then you know
[36:42] you look at you look at their life and
[36:46] you say that's not the life of Christ
[36:50] and that's not what I supposed to be
[36:53] mirroring uh you know the Prophet he
[36:56] talks about he talks about I think in
[36:59] their 90 ones in the end time he talks
[37:01] about you know
[37:03] and this is why you can't get caught up
[37:05] in in gifts and favorite preachers and
[37:09] and and all of that it's it's got to be
[37:12] something that's beyond just preaching a
[37:15] sermon singing a song
[37:18] I appreciate that song since birth I had
[37:20] I wanted to have a mother-in-law saying
[37:23] and it's but it's got to be something
[37:27] that's beyond that something that you
[37:30] know as as because as human beings as as
[37:33] as Christians we got to have something
[37:37] that's alive something that's living
[37:39] something that that we could look at
[37:42] write something like you know d-did the
[37:46] guy that was drinking for Christmas took
[37:49] a sip hit and took a sip down got me
[37:51] sippin but took a sip here and took the
[37:54] sit down and he had his son with him he
[37:58] had his son with him and and you know it
[38:01] was snowy and everything you know in his
[38:03] way you know he was walking anybody in
[38:05] here then got in a drunk and so it was
[38:08] wondering he was happy to look back and
[38:11] saw his little man just kind of you know
[38:15] what you doing you say daddy
[38:18] right cuz he wants the mirror his daddy
[38:20] right
[38:21] so he was following in his footsteps so
[38:24] but it's got to be the right kind of
[38:26] footstep like the property was talking
[38:29] about the gifted man right - gifted man
[38:33] he couldn't understand he said what what
[38:35] are those guys you know they would speak
[38:38] to town one would interpret to tell you
[38:39] were like wow that's that's beyond me
[38:42] but my gift he was able to you know
[38:45] shake my hand and then shake though they
[38:48] say man this one he will man if there
[38:51] was ever Christian he said that won't
[38:54] work but then he's a madman he said Oh
[38:56] Lord if there was ever devil so he was
[39:01] he had a wife and was running around
[39:03] with another woman what was gifted
[39:07] see was gifted but see when we when we
[39:12] when I look and you know I'm thinking
[39:16] about adoption right
[39:19] adoption is based upon our behavior
[39:24] right now I'm I do things a little bit
[39:28] different so y'all had to you know y'all
[39:30] had to just follow the way I think right
[39:34] but I'm in them I'm in the message right
[39:37] I believe adoption is based upon
[39:41] behavior character and and you know God
[39:47] used how many believe that the Apostle
[39:50] Paul was positionally placed by God
[39:52] right then he had because of the word to
[39:58] be a scriptural example a scriptural
[40:03] example to the generations right as as a
[40:08] minister if if you want to understand
[40:11] ministry you could go back to the church
[40:13] any book is in there the Prophet listen
[40:16] follow the life of pop-pop pause and a
[40:21] perfect it see it was just enough for
[40:24] Paul up under that lion anointing to to
[40:29] write and to teach but it was he had to
[40:34] live a life right he had to live a life
[40:39] that that when when we read about the
[40:42] life of Paul we said there we could see
[40:45] the Spirit of God flowing freely right
[40:49] come on cuz because that's that's
[40:52] adoption well we're in the adoption
[40:56] series he talks about that when we get
[40:59] to such a place where God said there's
[41:02] my spirit flowing freely y'all still
[41:06] following right i living a living
[41:10] example not just something y'all see
[41:12] while I'm working with you this way not
[41:15] not just not just great revelations and
[41:21] experiences right now to kind of
[41:27] continue to move forward right one of
[41:31] the things that we find in studying this
[41:34] this particular passage of Scripture is
[41:37] that Paul was toxic right by so-called
[41:45] believers so-called believers just
[41:50] immature right somewhat immature a lot
[41:55] the Corinthians Church we know we're
[41:57] immature right
[41:59] brotherbrother say Paul couldn't teach
[42:01] the same things that he preached to the
[42:03] Ephesians church right they had they had
[42:09] issues but you know what I believe that
[42:11] God allowed these things to happen right
[42:16] for an example because the Bible said
[42:20] things was wrote for our example right
[42:23] but to turn it's it's to a remark made
[42:28] in order to anger wound or provoke
[42:32] someone right and see what had to be on
[42:39] display and I was thinking this term
[42:41] claim to me real simple restraint
[42:45] restraint is is a measure of or
[42:50] condition that keeps someone or
[42:53] something under control or within limits
[42:56] of self control see because listen
[43:00] Church we got to think about it when
[43:05] something is saying yes there's a
[43:07] automatic reaction to the action right
[43:12] if if you've been littered being
[43:17] belittled right put down and and just
[43:20] say you know you're in a crowd and
[43:23] somebody's trying to make this person
[43:27] bigger than you right
[43:31] uh that's an automatic reaction right
[43:39] there will be an automatic reaction
[43:42] right if you alive if there's anything
[43:46] in you what what would you try to do you
[43:53] would try to show that this person is
[43:58] not bigger or better right you'll try to
[44:04] express all of who you are right but but
[44:13] you know how I like the bigger man the
[44:19] bigger man with all of the things that
[44:22] was which was taking place because the
[44:26] bigger man watch this
[44:28] brother brother says he makes you feel
[44:30] like you're the bigger man right a real
[44:36] big man but but he talk he talks about
[44:39] you know how you know preachers get
[44:41] sometimes you know change of suits and
[44:46] things of that nature they want to arm
[44:48] here
[44:50] yeah right it's kind of its kind of the
[44:53] spirit of this age too
[44:54] where where people people in this age
[44:57] they want to argue quotes and in argue
[45:02] their position
[45:03] but listen the gospel never came the
[45:07] opening of the seals none of this came
[45:09] just to give us something to argue about
[45:12] but something for us to show us how to
[45:15] live and obtain rapture insane traction
[45:19] great the tick of change but people
[45:22] people want to argue like that ain't my
[45:26] thought but you know it's there people
[45:28] want to argue and things of that nature
[45:30] right but but that's not the gospel
[45:33] that's not what the gospel is all about
[45:35] it's not about us you know sitting
[45:38] around fussing in this and
[45:39] and separating and dividing often -
[45:42] that's why we got so many churches that
[45:44] like we got the day and I ain't even
[45:47] time I like their Pentecost I'm talking
[45:49] about right around to reveal a word
[45:51] right
[45:52] somebody get upset and they go start
[45:56] something with leave that alone
[46:00] Lord Jesus help me right but watch watch
[46:09] Paul the Apostle Paul showing restraint
[46:15] showing character but but he's proving
[46:19] that it's the life of Christ right
[46:24] because listen you don't show restraint
[46:26] on your own
[46:28] come on somebody cross in front of you
[46:31] why are you driving little loud he you'd
[46:37] be ready to come on glue God had to
[46:41] catch it don't say that Oh y'all with me
[46:46] y'all with me out wit me y'all with me
[46:48] right but Paul he starts out he's he he
[46:54] says it's not expedient for me lest to
[46:57] the glory but this word glory means to
[47:00] boast right and all the things that that
[47:04] I study to get an understanding of the
[47:10] scripture cuz I don't know about y'all
[47:11] let's just like to read the Bible and
[47:13] not get an understanding of what's
[47:15] actually taking place right and
[47:18] sometimes you have to read other things
[47:20] because sometimes you can't find things
[47:22] in the message brother Branham never
[47:24] preached every single scripture but I
[47:30] think he he he brother Jack no I max I
[47:34] thought them about it but he did give us
[47:37] a foundation that that we if I'm reading
[47:44] something listen Lulu I can't agree with
[47:47] that right right somebody told me well
[47:52] it was said several times that you know
[47:55] you don't need to use the the message as
[47:59] a studying guy that's right now you
[48:05] can't tell me that I've been preaching
[48:07] too long
[48:08] I take I base everything you know who
[48:13] it's studying right I don't do away with
[48:16] my Bible right i brother branham say
[48:21] something to me that don't make sense or
[48:23] that's off you know I'll stick with the
[48:26] Bible - my revelation catches up to his
[48:28] revelation right but I filter things
[48:32] through the message people say the only
[48:34] you you don't it's like you gotta have a
[48:38] balance we know that the Bible is the
[48:41] absolute but the message helped me to
[48:45] understand so so you know people say
[48:49] well you don't need brother branham you
[48:51] don't disagree with it you say well why
[48:54] you say that brothers around because
[48:58] just say for instance this scripture
[49:01] that we read without me approaching it
[49:04] you'll read it and you won't have no
[49:07] unreal full understanding you you might
[49:10] get to the point where he took my grace
[49:12] sufficient because that's the part of
[49:14] the scripture that that we've heard
[49:17] right but so you you need something to
[49:22] help to explain what we got and that's
[49:26] to me what the message is all about it
[49:29] helps to explain to me what I got the
[49:32] Bible is the book of redemption right
[49:35] this is the book of redemption but I had
[49:39] no understanding trust I study the
[49:41] message right that's that's very
[49:45] realistic did the job come on it helped
[49:50] open up my understanding to what our
[49:53] hand so people say well you don't need
[49:56] it you know you you should study your
[49:59] brother branham just study your Bible
[50:02] what do you see okay that's
[50:06] let's father you can study your Bible
[50:09] you can read your Bible but you gonna
[50:11] need help you gonna you gonna need you
[50:15] you're gonna need to go somewhere
[50:17] because you're gonna run into things in
[50:20] this Bible that you're not gonna
[50:22] understand that you're gonna need
[50:24] somebody to interpret that I was free
[50:28] that's the truth
[50:30] but you said well why do you say that
[50:32] because you get so many things floating
[50:34] around floating around floating around
[50:38] well well you know all you need is the
[50:41] Bible listen I don't I don't disagree
[50:46] with that statement but I believe is
[50:48] most of that statement you need
[50:49] something to help you understand this
[50:51] book because there's there's plenty of
[50:55] things the songs of Solomon right I mean
[50:58] just a lot with it will it just not
[51:02] you're just reading you're just reading
[51:06] and you don't have a clue you said how
[51:10] can you say that because this year I'm
[51:15] taking my table times that okay if I
[51:17] don't get to everything I want to get to
[51:19] I just hope I drop enough points and
[51:22] brother Jack could pick it up when I'm
[51:24] gone okay but did this year I believe I
[51:29] and I've been preaching 20-some years
[51:32] but I believe in this year I've grown by
[51:37] going back and taking word for word
[51:40] letter for letter a chapter four chapter
[51:43] and and and making sense out of the
[51:46] whole thing right amen but you don't
[51:52] need you don't need the message maybe
[51:55] you don't need it maybe you don't need
[51:59] it but I still need it right it's like
[52:04] because it's all information and and the
[52:09] Bible said prove all things hold faster
[52:11] that was good right so I like that last
[52:16] part hold fast to that which is good
[52:19] so all it is good you trying to tell me
[52:23] to turn loose all the good to satisfy
[52:27] people I can't do it okay if it is that
[52:31] right is that the scripture y'all still
[52:33] with me you're holding fat how many
[52:36] believe that that's good a lot a lot of
[52:39] good in the message there's a lot
[52:41] there's a lot of death let me take
[52:44] something that's still things man in the
[52:47] messaging people did another thing if
[52:50] you don't study you can't even begin to
[52:54] tell me nothing about brother but how do
[52:56] you tell me where brother brother missed
[52:58] it in you don't study you don't study or
[53:02] you might have heard at one time or you
[53:04] write a ring at one time I remember
[53:06] brother Robledo said this years ago he
[53:08] said you got to hit some colonies ten
[53:10] times six times ten times I really get
[53:13] it every time I go back to a message
[53:16] book man I get something different fresh
[53:20] new no inspiration food in season right
[53:28] so so don't let don't let don't ever let
[53:31] nobody come to you with that you don't
[53:33] you don't need a messages all you need
[53:35] is your Bible brother branham never came
[53:39] to take the Bible from us he can't his
[53:43] Minister came to point us back to the
[53:46] thing right Oh glory to God Lord if I
[53:50] start on man I'm not going to get right
[53:55] I don't know that's just that's just
[53:57] kind of came I got about 35 minutes I'm
[54:00] gonna be out of here 9 o'clock but see
[54:03] y'all been such a good audience it's
[54:05] just get tough man last Wednesday man I
[54:12] can barely leave here okay but what she
[54:19] says is it's not expedient for me
[54:22] doubtless to boast right and think about
[54:28] something
[54:30] how could you see one thing about God
[54:34] God is not going to share any of his
[54:36] glory right and then you've got to think
[54:40] about something right how could a man or
[54:45] woman
[54:46] boasting something right within
[54:50] themselves that God did come on y'all
[54:55] miss dad huh how could we get lifted up
[55:01] right if we could do it we couldn't set
[55:05] ourselves free right we went in the pawn
[55:08] shop we needed him to go to cavalry we
[55:14] needed in debt pain we needed a goal
[55:16] right amen
[55:19] we we win it win it when it comes down
[55:22] to Revelation it takes God to reveal it
[55:26] takes not the same it's a god to deliver
[55:29] and take God to set people free huh it's
[55:34] like got to hear how many anybody need
[55:36] some healing tonight met with us in the
[55:39] body you know in the spirit if you need
[55:42] healing see I cannot see brother Jack
[55:48] can no minister can no matter how we
[55:52] come to the pulpit dressed up it was
[55:55] already done for you you just got to
[55:59] accept it didn't hop how can I boast in
[56:03] something that man somebody done for me
[56:07] right with with him when it comes down
[56:12] to the life of Christ
[56:17] right it's sis listen Church it's
[56:21] something living itself out through me
[56:28] only thing I can do I could boast in
[56:31] that something we can all do that we
[56:37] could boast in that something
[56:40] that's within us that that holds the
[56:45] rain when we talk taunted right but to
[56:52] boast within ourselves right in in human
[56:58] human ability see the kind and vain
[57:03] glory right vain glory is in honor at
[57:09] pride in oneself or one achievement
[57:14] accepted vanity
[57:16] none of that speaks to the character of
[57:19] God right none none of it so you see why
[57:25] vain glory has to be the kind right
[57:29] because it you can't attribute any of
[57:32] that look that as far as that term is
[57:35] concerned back to God because it does
[57:38] not speak to the nature and the
[57:41] character of God right and see Paul Paul
[57:46] is is example we look the part
[57:49] I know we looked at Jesus but Jesus is
[57:52] veiled can I get a witness
[57:55] Jesus Israel right we we still looking
[57:59] up and looking around right come on
[58:02] y'all stay with man God for 30 minutes I
[58:06] gonna preach are y'all ready for the be
[58:08] happy I know y'all get tired I'm gonna
[58:10] tattoo but y'all stay with me see that's
[58:13] not looked up and look around look at
[58:15] the Jesus listen in individual right
[58:20] amen watch watch Paul up under up under
[58:25] all the scrutiny and everything yet he
[58:30] something in him right with with all of
[58:36] these all of these experiences right
[58:41] Paul Paul when when Paul gets into the
[58:45] second and the third verses it because
[58:50] he wants to be careful
[58:52] right he speaks in the third person yeah
[58:55] I'm gonna heard that time the third
[58:58] person huh he speaks in the third person
[59:04] realizing these experiences he
[59:08] experienced himself great experiences I
[59:15] mean so much
[59:17] and the see things and hear things you
[59:21] know that unspeakable things that I like
[59:26] to show you just to really show you how
[59:29] different the the nature and character
[59:33] of God is versus the column nature in
[59:37] the fleshly nature of man because we
[59:41] wanted to me you know if we get up in
[59:43] those places we want everybody to know
[59:47] get the church
[59:49] I got a testimony well I have a dream I
[59:57] have it you might just eat too much that
[1:00:00] might not have been God but his power
[1:00:05] experiences things that is like man I
[1:00:09] ain't even you know what I haven't even
[1:00:13] said anything about people they they
[1:00:17] scrutinizing Paul's ministry and his
[1:00:20] Apostleship his authority and all
[1:00:22] anything trying to make for trying to
[1:00:25] make these so-called super apostles
[1:00:29] greater than God's anointed God called
[1:00:33] position in place the message of the age
[1:00:36] and you know like because I don't want
[1:00:41] to boast I don't want to make it like
[1:00:43] I'm this you know this great man I tell
[1:00:50] you what people like sometimes when you
[1:00:53] see that they eat you say what you
[1:00:55] saying that I'm in the scripture but it
[1:00:58] when you see these things a lot of times
[1:01:00] it it shows you it's no flat
[1:01:04] then the character of God right Amen
[1:01:09] because you know we want to point
[1:01:13] everything that God is there right
[1:01:16] Oh glory to his wonderful name see we we
[1:01:23] we want to profit what are the statement
[1:01:26] I wrote down cuz cuz we don't we don't
[1:01:30] want to boast within ourselves right
[1:01:32] because it's no profit this and and what
[1:01:37] we do as a Christians we want to profit
[1:01:41] we want to benefit right we want to be
[1:01:44] successful but we know those things come
[1:01:47] from Christ right amen
[1:01:51] see we want to be profitable for the
[1:01:55] kingdom of God right see
[1:01:59] listen church me preaching is not about
[1:02:03] me
[1:02:04] shining huh
[1:02:09] really it's not about me shining this
[1:02:11] it's not about me me me showing
[1:02:14] knowledge and things of that nature
[1:02:16] right my preaching is pointing us to to
[1:02:22] Christ showing us our airing wait come
[1:02:27] on
[1:02:28] making making sure we on the right track
[1:02:32] making sure we're not being deceived
[1:02:35] right because of y'all went back and
[1:02:37] read Satan's intent is to destroy the
[1:02:42] work of God see so it mean coming up
[1:02:47] o'clock I don't like to preach it's
[1:02:50] never was something that I wanted to do
[1:02:51] I just do it because I ain't got no
[1:02:53] choice right there's other things I
[1:02:55] could do for my health and for sure
[1:02:58] wouldn't be preaching but we do it not
[1:03:02] to be SH Mart but to benefit the kingdom
[1:03:08] of God by doing it right
[1:03:12] benefit the children of God right
[1:03:17] I doing it but outside of that way I
[1:03:20] wouldn't do it
[1:03:21] all right any man that's that's you know
[1:03:26] you in preaching and profiting right you
[1:03:33] want to see people grow you want to see
[1:03:36] people mature you want to see the young
[1:03:38] people grow the young people mature
[1:03:41] right amen
[1:03:43] but but like like I you know I was I was
[1:03:46] selling my church a little while ago but
[1:03:48] the young people just gotta make them a
[1:03:50] commitment I think I said this last week
[1:03:52] you just got to make a commitment right
[1:03:55] because if you don't if if you don't
[1:03:59] ever make a commitment then I can't help
[1:04:02] you write this it's a choice you you
[1:04:08] gotta make a choice right just like I
[1:04:12] had to make the choice every individual
[1:04:15] you've gotta make a choice see we will
[1:04:19] work what's happening what's happening
[1:04:20] with all the young people you know you
[1:04:23] know they're you know all these
[1:04:24] questions and did it people try to make
[1:04:27] it look like well it's the preachers
[1:04:29] fault how does our Father we come guys
[1:04:35] for provided way you be let you put you
[1:04:38] you try to do the best you can you it's
[1:04:42] it's an individual thing right free more
[1:04:49] Ages right and and see God gives you
[1:04:54] that choice thank God God haven't taken
[1:04:56] my choice from me if I wanna run around
[1:05:04] at the fool I can God didn't take that
[1:05:06] from me huh if I want to drink smoke
[1:05:10] cigarettes run around go to the club and
[1:05:18] your free moral agency
[1:05:21] Yukie if that's your choice you go do it
[1:05:25] but you gonna pay for it because the
[1:05:26] wage the wages of sin
[1:05:28] still there to be separated from God but
[1:05:32] you know we can we could all of us to
[1:05:36] the brothers our jobs you've been a
[1:05:38] Christian you could choose them go out
[1:05:40] then get you a but if you want to but
[1:05:44] you go paper I can use my mother-in-law
[1:05:46] she won't get mad at me
[1:05:48] folk get mad at me when I get the
[1:05:50] preaching sometime you know once it when
[1:05:57] she probably like but it's a choice it's
[1:06:03] a decision
[1:06:05] see y'all chose to be here you know what
[1:06:09] I didn't fight with nobody to be here
[1:06:11] tonight huh
[1:06:12] y'all came oh and y'all came here free
[1:06:17] will it was your choice you chose the
[1:06:21] hidden message tonight there was no
[1:06:23] choice come on you there was your choice
[1:06:26] and see if we could get that in the
[1:06:29] hearts and minds of of not just young
[1:06:31] people everybody if you've got to make a
[1:06:34] decision it's got to be your choice let
[1:06:35] me move on my time is moving all right
[1:06:40] but but watch Paul preaching in the
[1:06:44] third person to show them experiences
[1:06:48] but Paul Paul was not trying to read a
[1:06:53] little high on that right amen it wasn't
[1:06:58] something because it says I for Blair
[1:07:01] that someone should form an improper
[1:07:05] estimate of me not that's where we want
[1:07:07] to go right how does people see you when
[1:07:15] people see us how do people see us Paul
[1:07:20] you know if in piles and piles ministry
[1:07:23] in Paul's life Paul was concerned about
[1:07:26] how people saw him right that's death as
[1:07:32] a Christian right we have got to have
[1:07:37] that concern we gotta be a wit when
[1:07:40] people
[1:07:41] me how do they see me let's say that
[1:07:46] again
[1:07:47] to say that again when people see me how
[1:07:51] do they see me right well you know how
[1:07:58] do some people say you'd be like what
[1:08:04] you what you make you scratching hands
[1:08:09] like see you we could see what so-called
[1:08:15] Christianity has has come to this is why
[1:08:21] I'm grateful for the message God sent in
[1:08:26] a prophet because I had no clue what a
[1:08:31] true believer was supposed to look like
[1:08:34] in this day and see Paul was the
[1:08:39] standard in his day that still got the
[1:08:41] best standard in his day
[1:08:43] where's that where's a day see y'all
[1:08:47] live I'll help you out so y'all look
[1:08:50] around you you just you cuz God has
[1:08:55] always got a witness God always got some
[1:08:58] body on the earth that he could point to
[1:09:00] see ya that when the world see see see
[1:09:05] you they see you in a whole different
[1:09:08] light right you know look out people
[1:09:13] testify of the life that they see on
[1:09:16] your job in the community see amen
[1:09:22] Paul was concerned about that right let
[1:09:28] me read the description in jump it to a
[1:09:30] few things and then we get up out of
[1:09:31] here my key verses is right here he says
[1:09:35] for though I would desire to boast I
[1:09:39] should not be a fool for I will say the
[1:09:46] truth it like to say you know if I talk
[1:09:49] about the things it'll be writing this
[1:09:51] and then the other but that's not what
[1:09:53] it's all
[1:09:53] about but now I forbear lest any man
[1:09:57] should think of me above that which he
[1:10:00] seeth me to be or that he heareth of me
[1:10:05] right well listen it is the verse six
[1:10:09] now y'all have to stay with me
[1:10:10] but for the next 15 minutes y'all
[1:10:13] alright watch this he says lest any man
[1:10:18] think of me the idea that it's this
[1:10:22] little commentary so but I think it's
[1:10:26] fitting see the idea in this part of the
[1:10:30] verse I take to be this I desire and
[1:10:35] expect to be estimated by my public life
[1:10:40] right amen I expect to be judged of men
[1:10:46] by my deeds by what they see in me this
[1:10:53] is the believer this is the life right
[1:10:57] God's Spirit right flowing free but by
[1:11:02] my general reputation in respect to what
[1:11:05] I have done in establishing the
[1:11:09] Christian Church right I'm I'm willing
[1:11:14] that my character I like that
[1:11:16] right like we say adoption is based upon
[1:11:19] character the Christian walk is based
[1:11:23] upon character I'm willing that my
[1:11:25] character and reputation that the
[1:11:29] estimate in which I shall be held by
[1:11:32] mankind shall rest on character not all
[1:11:37] of these super experiences
[1:11:41] right when I was I knew a man that was
[1:11:44] caught up not that right look you know
[1:11:50] like like you get these guys sounding
[1:11:53] like wrestlers I'm probably torn sold on
[1:11:57] the beat they're three days and five
[1:12:00] nights and come bring the chicken hill
[1:12:02] and I'm gonna be there be back and then
[1:12:12] he he properly
[1:12:17] he properly and then he goes somewhere
[1:12:21] and commit some kind of act you see Paul
[1:12:27] was not resting on all these
[1:12:29] supernatural experiences being elevated
[1:12:32] and things of that but we respect that
[1:12:34] right but he wanted mankind to rest upon
[1:12:39] the character that he displayed right
[1:12:44] see we cannot do away with Christian
[1:12:47] character well we you know we shouted
[1:12:50] I've seen so many people over the last
[1:12:52] 27 years almost better year something
[1:12:55] like everything else look III don't want
[1:12:59] to say this to be funny look at all the
[1:13:02] people when we first got sane we went to
[1:13:05] meet as we shot it when we cry we boohoo
[1:13:09] we shot we we did all of those different
[1:13:13] things right where's half those people
[1:13:19] those people right look since we've come
[1:13:24] out look at the other groups of people
[1:13:29] we didn't shot it with we have been in
[1:13:31] meetings with we then kuben Dobbin with
[1:13:34] huh where's those people okay
[1:13:40] see so it can't be that right something
[1:13:46] has got to come inside of the individual
[1:13:49] that testifies of something that's
[1:13:53] eternal something that's alive right
[1:13:57] I saw the ladies dead it's dead right
[1:14:03] something came inside of me that speaks
[1:14:06] of rest that speaks of victory come on
[1:14:09] y'all pretty now let's pick some joy did
[1:14:15] this speaks of a train changing my mind
[1:14:20] changing my walk you know I remember
[1:14:23] when I first got saved and you know
[1:14:25] trying them you know I was straight out
[1:14:28] of Jersey in you know still had a lot of
[1:14:32] hood and all of them was all of them was
[1:14:34] you know saved and everything and back
[1:14:37] then I guess because I got burned up a
[1:14:39] lot of sales you know I was moving slow
[1:14:42] and they thought that was cool
[1:14:44] Bob know that you know had all the
[1:14:47] swagger and they've all played at the
[1:14:50] bus riding a bus mighty cool and
[1:14:53] everything that I talked enough all
[1:14:55] right man no you don't want that you
[1:14:58] don't wanna lust after that that's death
[1:14:59] man I want to pick up the feet I want to
[1:15:04] pick up my boys I wouldn't I want some
[1:15:06] happiness enjoy that kind of swagger
[1:15:10] that's why I almost took me out right
[1:15:15] groaning but this joy I have the world
[1:15:23] didn't give it to me saying yes joy
[1:15:31] right but but let me let me keep going
[1:15:36] inside did I wish that my character
[1:15:39] among people shall be determined by my
[1:15:44] secret feelings or by my secret
[1:15:47] extra-ordinary communication from heaven
[1:15:50] which I may have
[1:15:52] you see we try we try to make those
[1:15:56] things supersede the life of Christ but
[1:16:01] watch this if we really watch something
[1:16:06] here now if we're really in those places
[1:16:10] right genuinely the life of Christ and
[1:16:13] God moving us in it should translate huh
[1:16:18] to public deeds if we're so deeply
[1:16:23] deeply revelaed it and boy I've been
[1:16:26] lifted up and man I saw the pillar fire
[1:16:29] and I this and that then if that's
[1:16:31] Ginuwine it should translate into public
[1:16:35] deeds and this is what paul is talking
[1:16:37] about because he was concerned how
[1:16:39] people how you know what people estimate
[1:16:44] of his of his life right that was that's
[1:16:48] important see what what should that
[1:16:51] should be important for the church how
[1:16:54] people perceive us right about what we
[1:16:57] do right doing the property
[1:17:02] yeah at home you know why I was in this
[1:17:05] because if we genuinely there it'll
[1:17:08] translate it'll move itself over right
[1:17:12] as we grow and mature in God right Oh
[1:17:16] glory to God
[1:17:18] lord help us he says which can let me
[1:17:25] back up is that I do not wish that my
[1:17:27] character among people shall be
[1:17:29] determined by my secret feelings Obama
[1:17:31] secret extraordinary communication from
[1:17:33] heaven which I may have which cannot be
[1:17:36] subjected to the observation of my
[1:17:40] fellow men I am willing to be estimated
[1:17:43] by my public life
[1:17:46] however valuable such extraordinary
[1:17:50] memory stations may be to me as an
[1:17:53] individual however much they may comfort
[1:17:58] me I do not wish to make that the basis
[1:18:02] of my public reputation
[1:18:04] right that's the half of that so you can
[1:18:08] see why
[1:18:09] Paul Paul being caught up right and
[1:18:13] realize okay no matter what that was all
[1:18:15] about
[1:18:16] that for the most part it was for me
[1:18:19] right but what I do out here that's what
[1:18:24] that's for me but that's also for the
[1:18:26] people right hey man that's what the
[1:18:30] people see well you know we come in the
[1:18:34] church and man Sunday we shouted awhile
[1:18:36] right but that was good in the building
[1:18:42] right come on
[1:18:44] that was that was good in the building
[1:18:47] see all of these things they're good in
[1:18:48] the building but what about our public
[1:18:51] life what about our public life see get
[1:18:59] the book of Acts right and we just a
[1:19:02] continuation of the book of Acts they
[1:19:05] they live such a a christ-like life that
[1:19:09] they would call Christians the people of
[1:19:12] that day they saw they saw Christ living
[1:19:14] in flesh right
[1:19:17] it hasn't changed right if if it's been
[1:19:23] the word see been grafted back in huh
[1:19:27] it's supposed to produce the same kind
[1:19:30] of church that because the Athleta me go
[1:19:33] to the same church right if the act if
[1:19:37] the our church was was a certain way
[1:19:39] didn't it then the restoration brings us
[1:19:43] back to an original right
[1:19:46] oh come on somebody did look I heard God
[1:19:52] then then look at the Alpha Church right
[1:19:56] they had everything in common they had a
[1:20:00] oneness they have a harmony amongst oh
[1:20:03] lord help us see but people get
[1:20:08] gratification and sometimes even
[1:20:10] ministers while I preach the deep when
[1:20:12] the right you know it's ironic we
[1:20:17] people will preach a sermon and then we
[1:20:20] can't stand outside and shake the people
[1:20:23] hand that we just preached to we have
[1:20:25] got so elevated we're we're so so deep
[1:20:30] and was so elevated now that you know we
[1:20:34] we got to be whisked off a lot of that
[1:20:37] stuff is called a counter impersonation
[1:20:40] I remember wheels out of meeting some
[1:20:44] years and years ago a long long time ago
[1:20:46] being brother Jack and everything he was
[1:20:49] a little offended he was he was a little
[1:20:53] hurt you know some brothers and priests
[1:20:56] him and he was trying to shake her
[1:20:58] brother hand and not get in the car get
[1:21:00] in the car but it's all about you know
[1:21:05] and I was like man don't worry about it
[1:21:07] brother
[1:21:08] nobody see if people thought what what's
[1:21:14] what's my reputation how does the public
[1:21:18] perceive me and as a minister of the
[1:21:20] gospel I don't want I don't want the you
[1:21:24] know people around in the public let's
[1:21:26] say so into himself man he can't shake
[1:21:31] nobody oh my god see I'm one way in the
[1:21:36] pulpit now when it comes down to the
[1:21:40] anointing the preaching of the gospel I
[1:21:42] won't see nobody I got family up in here
[1:21:45] but I don't see them right now that's
[1:21:46] why I take my glasses off it's all hard
[1:21:51] to baby see that clear
[1:21:53] oh when it comes to the gospel I don't
[1:21:56] know nobody I don't know my wife I don't
[1:21:59] know my children they be hot with me all
[1:22:01] the time they be hot with me all the
[1:22:04] time man
[1:22:08] my children see this is where sting
[1:22:11] could show up out of coming out there is
[1:22:13] it would a long time even my wife I have
[1:22:17] to slow it down for them a little bit I
[1:22:19] have to I have to be cautious are they
[1:22:21] feeling some time but it
[1:22:22] listen I'm only trying to give you truth
[1:22:25] right I love you it is what it did when
[1:22:30] he come down to the word of God I ain't
[1:22:32] gonna I know sugarcoat it for nobody
[1:22:34] now I set the brows know them and trying
[1:22:36] tired and then sat up under me for a
[1:22:38] little while not Shanda see because
[1:22:42] sister Brown look I was hard on them
[1:22:46] because they were family huh
[1:22:50] I'm gonna part thing while family but
[1:22:53] brother Jack Oh take it easy so mama's
[1:22:55] boy now you got the wrong man
[1:22:58] Jack Jack a lot like me
[1:23:00] that's why we work good together could
[1:23:04] you you you cannot help anybody be
[1:23:06] impartial huh you sir favoritism that
[1:23:11] the favorite family huh the fan family
[1:23:18] this is a fanfare now you can give on
[1:23:22] the fan all you want but when it come
[1:23:24] down to their word you got the line up
[1:23:26] just like anybody else see and and
[1:23:31] that's the only way you're gonna get
[1:23:33] Marty what people in rapturing condition
[1:23:36] you can't be posture you can't preach a
[1:23:40] passion gospel see pardon Paul didn't
[1:23:44] see any partiality what Paul was trying
[1:23:46] to get the Corinthian church that come
[1:23:49] back the dark because they were worried
[1:23:50] and then what Connell and they was they
[1:23:52] was missing the point
[1:23:53] and so he had to show restraint he had
[1:23:57] to show the character God sometimes even
[1:24:00] as Minister you got to show some
[1:24:01] restraint you know I've learned
[1:24:04] something over the years for my time
[1:24:07] going I've learned something over the
[1:24:09] years is that you can't beat it into
[1:24:12] people you you just got laid out there
[1:24:16] and give them space give God room to
[1:24:20] work let okay the God get alert you with
[1:24:24] a message you put it out there and then
[1:24:27] you just gotta let God like you know
[1:24:29] sometimes I hear brothers why brush my
[1:24:31] top bastard um
[1:24:33] well I tried blanch some days is over
[1:24:36] cuz it don't work I'm not saying there
[1:24:40] are times where you just do have to come
[1:24:41] out and say what needs to be said there
[1:24:44] are times but that there's times I've
[1:24:46] learned
[1:24:47] listen I'm perfect I'll be like God
[1:24:49] spare me please work with me Lord Jesus
[1:24:51] don't kill me cuz I'm a work in progress
[1:24:55] come on the world is perfect
[1:25:00] I write you we preach it a perfect
[1:25:05] gospel book but we're all coming to the
[1:25:08] unity of the faith and so you gotta be
[1:25:11] you gotta be patient you gotta be
[1:25:13] patient with your children parents right
[1:25:16] I'm telling you man I'm that girl I
[1:25:19] tolerate stuff that I never thought in a
[1:25:21] million years I will go for right but

[1:25:27] to me why we getting Timmy well but I'll
[1:25:29] be like Lord help me be restraint

[1:27:34] a test for you I've tested your maturity
[1:27:40] cuz the time we get I'm telling you
[1:27:43] sometime we smoked some righteous that
[1:27:45] we realize and just for a minute God
[1:27:49] might allow them to have their season to
[1:27:55] see our reaction to the action to see if
[1:28:01] we gonna be all dignified and fail to
[1:28:03] realize that we were sinners
[1:28:05] Oh Cory that we messed up that we did
[1:28:10] all kinds of stuff and you know and but
