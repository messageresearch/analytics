need to do is walk through the door amen amen amen amen uh i want to read from just two verses i mentioned that uh i want to give my easter sermon on today since i won't be here next week so y'all just bear with me i want to read from matthew 27 amen and then also a little bit from matthew 28 um we'll we'll read here this morning uh matthew 27 and starting at verse 62 and i trust the lord to just help us uh in in the thought today um here in matthew 27 verse 62 it says now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and pharisees came together unto pilate saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days i will rise again that is what they remembered yeah and um so command therefore that the sepulcher be made sure until the third day lester's disciples come by night so they already got in a mind what's gonna happen that the disciples gonna do this amen the disciples gonna come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he is risen we don't want the disciples to do that he is risen from the dead so the last error shall be worse than the first uh pilate said unto them you have a watch go your way make it as sure as you can as you can so they went and made the sepulcher sure sealing the stone and setting a watch you can imagine these guys can't even go to sleep they up on 24-hour shifts trying to make it as sure as they can let's turn over to matthew 28 let's pick up verse 11. is now when they were going behold some of the watch the same ones that was assigned to watch some of the watch came into the city and showed them to the chief priests all the things that were done and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers saying say ye so they're going to pay you to tell a lie saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept ain't that something now these guys had a they had an easy job they went out there to try to make it sure they then they come back and told the stories of what happened well they didn't want the people to believe what happened so we're going to pay you to lie tell them the disciples stole them away came by night and stole them away while we slept and if this come to the governor's ears we will persuade him and secure you look at these fellas so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is commonly reported among the jews until this day the lord of the blessing to the reading of his word let's pray father we thank you for the ability to read the word but we know it takes the holy spirit to come and quicken what has been read so lord we yield ourselves up to your spirit that you would just take control over the notes the thoughts amen um lord the reactions father that you would just take control over this portion of service me we be edified may you be glorified and magnified an exalted father here in our midst thank you for uh what you are doing we see you father we just see your mighty hand at work here in this season of spirit and truth 2.0 we're so grateful for what we see uh god we ask that god as we just uh uh just take our thoughts and center in on on the word of god today lord may we leave inspired and courage and strengthened by the word that has been given from heaven to us we take every spirit that's against the spirit of god underneath the control of the holy ghost even now and we just trust lord that you would get all the glory we pray a special blessing upon brother smiley as he's in the pulpit this morning thank you for him and sister smiley going there to be brother fred we asked that you would touch brother fred in his body lord that you bring healing to him and and i'm reminded of a man how uh the prophet prayed for a man that had a stroke in god the prayer that the prophet prayed is that you would reverse whatever the stroke amen brought upon him do the same for our precious brother fred reverse whatever a man the effects of the stroke was and father may he be returned to me to be made whole it's in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ that we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated amen uh we want to use for our title today their rock is not like our rock amen their rock is not like our rock blessed be the name of the lord i i was uh years ago talking on the phone with a brother lincoln a man um um he lives up in north carolina brother from zimbabwe uh and um uh you know he was telling me one time he had preached this sermon um their rock is not like our rock and i say wow he didn't tell me none of the notes are nothing he just told me to tie it i said brother i got to hold on to that title and uh you know so i just put it in my little notebook and just been waiting just waiting and and uh and as i start preparing for it i got a whole bunch of notes and i said lord i can't preach all that i got to figure out what we can bring in and what we uh have to leave out and maybe we'll come back and hit it from another angle at a later date but uh but i'm still in this title from brother lincoln so if he hears the tape he can know that brother i stole the title amen and i think if i make a confession like that it's okay you know if i and now the other thing that we're going to find out a little bit later on in one brother lincoln title all right glory to god but uh but but here i just want to start that job and we're going to go here to job 19 and we're going to read a little few verses but job is the very first person that got a glimpse of easter amen and uh when job got a glimpse of easter uh job was actually going through the most difficult time in his life uh job had lost his animals job had lost his servants job had lost his children job was even losing his health amen and there were many things that job was going through but it was during this tremendous time in his life that he got a glimpse of easter amen and i want to encourage us this morning that you might be going through some difficult things amen even at uh during this season but uh i pray that god will give you a glimpse of easter amen that that that that that that that you'll get a strength amen by what you see but here in job 19 verse 17 it says my breath is strange to my wife though i entreat it for uh the children's sake of my own body yay young children despise me i arose and they spake against me he's going through some very very trying circumstances all my inward friends abhorred me amen and they whom i loved are turned against me my god hallelujah my blood my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh and i am escaped with the skin of my teeth he says have pity upon me have pity upon me oh ye my friends for the hand of god have touched me so so even while job is going through this amen rather than have friends there to encourage him amen job's friends come to actually accuse him glory to god but this is why you got to learn how to be able to encourage yourself amen you know you might not have nobody there to pat you on the back so you have to pat yourself on the back sometimes and just keep pressing on he says he says have pity upon me hath pity upon me oh ye my friends for the hand of god have touched me why do you persecute me as god and are not satisfied with my flesh he says this oh that my words were not written oh that they were printed in a book glory to god he says that they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock forever amen it says for i know this is him getting a glimpse of a man of easter he says for i know in the midst of everything he was going through he says for i know not i hope but i know that my redeemer liveth hallelujah and that he shall stand at that at the latter day upon the earth and i love job's confession and though after my skin worm destroys this body amen he says yet in my flesh shall i see god amen is getting a glimpse of the of east he says whom i shall see for myself and my eyes shall behold him and not another though my reigns be consumed within me job got a glimpse of easter job got a glimpse of a resurrection that in the midst of everything he was going through god was going to somehow bring him up from this hallelujah you got to be able to get a glimpse of easter there was a situation that happened amen and i'm going to be pulling from uh this quote out of i know my redeemer liberty and i'm going to be starting i think it might be the second quote i mean the second number on there that's where i'm going to start from here in a second there was a situation where brother branham told us about this chaplain that was serving during i think it was world war one and um and while he was serving during the war uh you know he said that you know in the tents they had all the the wounded soldiers that were in there and and many of them you know they're falling on the battlefield and many just going through so much just land on cops and says this one morning on it happened to be easter morning and and uh and there was a nurse that came in to where these guys were laying and uh and the nurse uh reached and just gave a rose to each man just gave a rose to each man and as as the men just got a hold of one rose uh it caused them to just go into tears and just begin to cry because they knew that the roads that they had received amen was a rose that was coming from a land they were fighting for a man when they when they were looking around and and going through uh this particular battle and they looked around the battlefield and they saw how desperate the situation was the rose reminded them that you know things are better back home and if we can just get through this and get back home it's gonna be all right right so so so the chaplain he would just be kind of be moved to tears himself and and then um you know he said this and we're gonna go right here to this quote glory to god it said uh preacher friend it says i stood there and and wept glory to god it says i was i was weeping soul til i said one of the boys was going in the motorcycle out to the front lines out about past alsace lorraine and he said he was going out there to do some kind of reconnaissance and i said to him sergeant can i ride with him he said certainly chaplain jump right in says you're you're taking your own pretty much you're taking your own life in your hands when you're right out here amen to the front lines with me he said he says that's all right i just like to ride with you glory to god and it says uh certainly jumped right in said we rode till we got to that bleach desert where not even a speck of grass or nothing was it says while he was planting down his material so so so you know this was a time where they used all the the uh the gases and all that in the war and they just wiped out everything wiping out trees white white i mean uh men's uh uh some of the stuff when those men came when the soldiers came in contact with it it just it damaged many of the men uh in the world it's this gas that they were using it says and while he was planting down his material that he was ascend a message back or whatever he wants to do he says i walked around there a little bit and i thought oh is him this some easter he says out in this land where the bombs has knocked all the buildings to the ground where the trees are run down with machine gun bullets there's not even a speck of grass left he said oh god this is a picture of this world some of these days when sinners took her toll this will be the picture glory to god it says my mind and my eyes was attracted to a certain rock i like this it says and i went over there and i thought lord what do you want me to stand by this rock for it says i just raised the rock up and when i did i i i i says a little easterly had his head sticking up glory amen it had been protected all through the storm amen all through the poison gases had never bothered it for it was hit in the rock and i'm going to tell you that the protection you'll find it in the rock glory to god your your covering you'll find it in the rock your encouragement amen you'll find it in the rock my god amen when this man was just kind of drawn to the rock he saw that there was life still there it was but it was underneath the rock hallelujah the rock was covering it the rock was actually keeping it the rock was not uh the rock was not impacted by the gases the rock was not impacted by the bullets amen the rock is your shield oh glory amen the rock is everything you need [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah all you got to do is get to the rock this one this is why david made the statement it says when my heart is overwhelmed he said he is a special place that he could go glory to god he says lead me to the rock the rock that is higher than i i want to tell you this morning there's a rock you can get on there's a rock you can get under there's a rock you can you can you can be by hollywood that rock will offer you everything you need glory hey praise god amen maybe people don't don't know why you want to go to the rock because denrock is not like iran [Music] hey my rock is real my rock is a person glory to god this ain't any kind of rock hallelujah glory glory glory glory amen he says he says uh uh it had been protected all through the stone all through the poison gases had never bothered it for it was hid in the rock i know my redeemer liveth oh god regardless of what the world says hide me in the rock of the ages lord and when the storms have passed let me raise my head to life again because he lives we live also what can the believers say that's been on the sands who's witnessed these things i know my redeemer liveth glory glory glory glory glory job could have a confidence like that because job was in the rock job was in the rock protected by the rock glory to god amen let's go on a little further here uh when we talk about easter talk about the resurrection you know the reason that we even go to church on sunday is because we are honoring amen the day of the resurrection he rose on the day after the sabbath amen which was sunday so every time we come into church on sunday we're honoring the resurrection and what the resurrection did it was proof that uh that a man can live after he dies the resurrection is proof that a man can live after he dies glory to god but in order to have a man that assurance you got to be in the rock glory to god amen you got you you're going to have to have covering from the rock all right all right this this this quote here and letting off the pressure brother branham makes a statement he says then there came another great warrior once it says jesus of nazareth jehovah made flesh dwelling among us it says he came down and told us told us that in my father's house there are many mansions and though you have a land you can raise your homes and raise your children and raise your uh raise your crops but there's a land where man doesn't die glory where you don't have to get old and die and he was the joshua for us and he came to his cadets barnea the judgment seat which kadesh was the judgment seat and there cadence barnea for him was calvary where he bore all of our sins says and then he crossed over what we call jordan death and come back on easter morning bringing the evidence to us that a man can live after death and man then he brought back a group of grapes too and he told them to wait up there uh to the day of pentecost they all got a bit a bite of it and got the evidence man can live again and we are living again amen we have raised from the things of death unto new life and we sat together in heavenly places already in christ jesus already in eternity i like that i'm already in eternity i already made it amen i'm already an overcomer glory it's already happened it ain't nothing i'm waiting for it's already done glory to god already in eternity because we become part of his life eternal life and eternal life is god's life god but we but because we're sons and daughters of god everything had a beginning has an end so it's those things that had no beginning has no end that's that was only god so we become part of his life easter east is what separates christianity from any other religion easter is where jesus proved who he was and who he said he was easter is the proof of that let's look at three scriptures matthew 17 verse 20 through 22-23 amen matthew 17 verse 22-23 my god my god my god amen uh uh yeah it says and they i mean while they abode in galilee jesus said unto them the son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men and they shall kill him and the third day he shall be raised again and they were exceeding sorry now now notice the disciples he's speaking to in this verse but i read to you earlier how the religious leaders came to pilate said now we heard that the deceiver said that in three days he was going to rise again but what we need to do is make this this tomb as sure as you can amen because we what what it wasn't that they were going to try to do everything they could to stop the prophecy let me tell you something ain't one thing you can do that will ever stop god's prophecy mamas and daddies some of our wayward children are trying to do everything they can to stop the prophecy but god told us amen that if we were baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ he said the promise was unto us he said he would fill us with the holy ghost he said the promise was unto us unto our children those that are far off as many as the lord our god shall call and let me tell you something your child can't do nothing not one thing can they do i don't care what sin they get themselves trapped into that's the greater the sin the greater the testimony [Applause] you just gonna become more of a testimony of his grace i don't care how far you go not one thing you can do you can try to make it as short you can glory to god but god is supernatural and it'll go beyond anything man can try to do you can't find a supernatural god with natural means i'm gonna do this and i'm gonna do that and i ain't never you ain't gonna tell my god what you're not gonna ever do look mom and daddy you ain't even gotta argue with them just read the scripture read the scripture the promise is unto me and to my children say let's just read it let's just read it the promise is unto me and to my children are you my child [Applause] did i give birth to you [Applause] glory to god if i gave birth to you then this is my promise and whether you want it to happen or not it ain't even up to you no more it's up to me and what i believe in god's word and i'm claiming you praise god i will not let you go [Music] [Applause] you trying to make it sure and i'm gonna make it sure i'm standing on a rock and they'll rocket not like my rock [Applause] glory to god my rock is my revelation and that's where i'm placing my stand on christ the solid rock i stand all of the grounds are sinking sand glory glory glory hallelujah [Applause] praise god hallelujah no matter what it is church that you're going through some of y'all might be standing on the rock for your healing stand on the rock stand on that rock stand on that rocker revelation when the doctor says nothing more he can do your rock is not like my rock talk i got a promise he's the lord my god that healeth all my diseases glory glory glory hey man amen amen my so here uh jesus telling disciples they shall kill him and on the third day he shall raise again he shall be raised again and they were exceeding sorry verse john john chapter 2 and verse 19 these are things that jesus spoke out of his own mouth what leader of any faith to speak words like this and actually keep them this is what makes christianity different from any other religion and easter east itself amen is the very proof that christianity is right hallelujah here in john 2 19 it says jesus answered a sinner to them destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up glory to god john 10 verse 17 and 18. my john 10 says uh therefore doth my father love me because i laid down my life that i might take it again i lay down my life that i might take it again this is why he could tell uh pilate you don't have no power with me pilots say you know i got the power to do this look man i i know this is your title and you they don't voted you into this position but you need to understand you have no power over me and i need you to understand some church if jesus is living on the inside of you you can stand before the government with the same type of conviction no you have no power over me god allowed me to walk into this situation for his glory but you have no power over me i leave my life down and you know what i'm going to be the one to pick it up again it says no man taketh it from me my but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again this commandment have i received of my father see jesus amen was the one that backed his own words up glory to god he backed up his own words and this is this is why this is what what what makes the difference amen in christianity hey who wouldn't want to serve a god like this oh our god is now you know back in in in uh old testament they serve gods of rocks and gods of stones i mean of wood they served all these different gods but they don't they rock was not like our rock their rock was not like our rock hearing this message amen it's a little prayer that brother branham uh gives and let me just uh hold on one second let me see something yes i think yes we can just go in here just for a little bit oh glory glory glory here it is a little prayer in this in this message to contest their rock is not like our rock it says uh make us fit servants forgive our past bless our future he says guide us o lord god with our mighty hand jehovah bless these ministers here bless all the laity all the visitors be thou with us lord we are your servants and we give ourselves holy to you now he says for 1963 but i'mma say for 2022. we give ourselves holy to you for 2022 that the power of your spirit might have more preeminences in our life and in our being help us god forgive us and help us we pray raise up mighty men raise up mighty warriors of the faith open this year lord that hidden manna that rock beneath the rock amen that we might see the program of god cap off the pyramids of our life lord put the capstone amen christ jesus upon each and every one of us may his great magnificent holy blessings be upon us all may the fire of the holy ghost come upon us may the power of the resurrection be manifested god how we thank you tonight we are yours we give ourselves fully to you lord and i just love amen just how he's consecrating himself in the in the congregation and and he acts in this in this prayer god opened to us the rock that's beneath the rock now we know amen when you study the message we know that uh brother branham you know had the experience of uh you know going out west and the seven angels visiting him and and before he went amen there was a a a uh some dreams that was shared and one of the dreams talked about how brother branham took a crowbar and opened up this pyramid rock and it said light had never shined on that before revelation that revelation that never come before and it was the opening of the seals amen so when it when he when he took the crowbar and he opened it amen in the dream it showed that we were about to get something that we've never seen before and that was the rock the revelation amen that was beneath everything that's what we were getting uh brother eugene braun had made a statement he says this that opened us the rock beneath the rock this is hidden manna this rock beneath the rock is hidden manner glory to god when you go to other churches there's many of them you can go to they got public manner this bible here is public manner everybody can eat from this glory to god but when you look through a prophetic lens now you got hidden manna you got the rock beneath the rock can i go a little further jesus was a rock inside of a rock and one day the tomb opened and we saw the rock inside the rock come out hallelujah glory glory glory glory let's look at a couple more scriptures deuteronomy 32 hallelujah deuteronomy 32 hey man i just got to see if i'm i'm where i need to be lord jesus when i start putting this sermon together i just had it going a certain direction i just want to make sure i got it right lord just help us here oh there's uh there's much to say i'll just let it flow deuteronomy 32 deuteronomy 32. look at this now uh moses is is is preparing to leave amen the children of israel and um he's rehearsing some things with them and it says in verse 1 it says give ear o ye heavens and i will speak and hear o earth the words of my mouth this is my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distill as the dew as a small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon the grass and i love the way moses put it says because i will publish the name of the lord ascribe ye greatness unto our god and what moses said i'm gonna write out a praise report i need to let people know what god has done for me and even though moses is not going into the promised land he's still got a praise glory to god any he said he says i will he says uh i will publish the name of the lord ascribe ye greatness unto our god look at this he is the rock his words i mean his work is perfect for all his ways of judgment a god of truth and without iniquity just and right is he amen now moses identifies god as the rock glory hallelujah hallelujah amen at verse 18 we're going to skip down to that he keeps kind of referring to the rock here uh uh in um in this and let me go to verse 17 says they sacrificed unto devils talking about the people that was in this land that they get ready to go into they sacrifice unto devils it says not to god to gods whom they knew not to new gods that came newly up whom your fathers feared not it says of the rock that begot thee thou are unmindful glory to god a man and has and has forgotten uh god that formed these so he's warning the children of israel that sometimes you forget where you come from glory glory you were born underneath the rock amen you were protected by the rock amen amen he was i mean he was your healing while you were going through the wilderness and and and uh and you were bitten by snakes and you turned to look at that pole it's the rock that gave you that commandment it's the rock that kept his word god is the rock amen glory to god glory to god hallelujah god himself is the rock and if they say don't forget where you came from glory to god and it say of the rock they they that begot thee thou art unmindful so don't forget about the rock glory hallelujah all right now look at this go on to verse 30 amen in the same chapter i'm just kind of skipping amen but here here it is in 30 my my my my mind how should one chase a thousand glory amen and two put ten thousand to flight how's that gonna happen except that rock had sold them amen and the lord had shut them up now i need you to just understand something and that that that their rock hat sold them it means to be given over to death the word soul means to be given over to death and our rock sold us our rock was given over to death amen he laid his life down so he could pick it up again oh i'm talking i'm telling you this morning their rock it's not like our rock glory to god glory now look at the next verse 31 says for their rock is not as our rock i told you brother brother lincoln didn't get this of himself amen it came from the scripture for their rock is not amen as our rock even our enemies themselves being judges i love this i love this amen this this rock in this uh portion of scripture it's uh i was just looking at it in this this little book that i got called keys to the bible amen uh sister michelle gave that to me years ago a lady i met by the name of uh uh miss dolly amen and her husband was a minister and uh he had this little book and just i mean just keys to the bible just little things you can go get a definition of and and every once in a while i'd go back to that book and just pull something out it's one of the first things i got starting out in ministry so i appreciate it but i got a little definition on that when we look at rock in the bible it has multiple definitions one of them is a man a vast mass of stone a rock is a vast mass of stone and and they use the famous rock of horeb amen just bear with me because i want to talk about that a little bit later amen they they use that the the famous rock of horeb amen this is where moses was told to uh to to to to smite the rock it was a rock of horup it was the rock of horp that's what he smoked and that's where the water came out so it's a vast mass of stone another definition especially in the scriptures that we just read out of deuteronomy 32 where it says their rock is not like our rock amen and that in that portion of scripture it means god as the author and source of all blessings so when i say that they're rock it's not like they're that like my rock i'm saying god is my source i'm saying god is my shepherd god is my help god is my salvation god is my provider god is my protector god is my king god is my hope god is my redeemer god is my way out of no way god is my burden bearer god is my heavy load sheriff god is my peace god is my keeper god is my healer god is my strength glory to god amen god god is everything i need and more god is my all when i say that a rock is not like my rock i'm saying god is the source of all my blessings and i don't forget where i got my blessings from and when i need a new blessing i just go to the rock glory to god i think david also tried to take an opportunity to explain this to us so let's look at what he says in second samuel 22 hallelujah glory glory glory second samuel 22. uh let's look at this amen david is explaining uh what god is hey and and david was a man that went through some really really tough circumstances david um david was running from saul man trying to kill him uh uh over and over again he's trying to kill this kill saul is trying to kill him not only that we have uh you know he's uh he's in in battle with with some of the the uh he's in war even with the philistines he has to fight other nations i mean he's always constantly in battle always in trouble my god my god but david just began to think about the rock and he began to write some things here amen second samuel 22 says in david speaking to the lord the words of this song and the day that the lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of the hand of saul now the song could not come to david until after he had gone through the situation you get inspiration by the things you go through glory glory glory you get strength out of things that you go through hey look at david now it says he wrote this song amen the words of the lord david speaking to the lord the words of the son and the day that the lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of the hand of saul and he said the lord is my rock now you got to get this now because david you know as i was reading this i thought about david hiding in a cave and now one time he get in the cave he's hiding from saul and saul comes into the very cave that david is in my god amen here david is protected i mean now if david were to sneeze [Applause] if david would have just did anything to give his position and saul would have known that he was actually in the rock with david but but what happens that david sits there quiet doesn't say anything and before you know it amen the rock began to work on saul and the rock i'm talking about the lord jesus he calls saul to go into a deep sleep amen and while david is there somebody said david now look god has brought saul right into your hands so you can slam right now david said no no no no no no no don't touch god's anointing don't do anything with that just just let it be just let it be said what we'll do is maybe just take a little piece of his garment or something but but but just just let it be and david comes out of the cave runs to the other side and calls back and says saul what about this and what about that david saul says that your voice statement yeah it's my voice i was right there with you could have took your life but god god said not so david was finding protection in the rock i mean it was something greater than the cave that was his protection because in the same cave that he went in saul came into he needed a greater rock than the rock that he was in glory to god he had that he had to have a greater rock than that and god proved that he was david's rock that he was his protection i i know i know sometimes you want to depend on the doctor and there's nothing wrong with that we appreciate the doctors glory to god but sometimes you need something greater than what the doctor is saying and i want to let you know you can go to the rock there's a rock that's higher than that lead me to the rock man i want to go to the rock glory to god i get to talking about the rock i want to go to the rock my my mind he says this and he says the lord is my rock and he just didn't stop he couldn't couldn't stop himself and my fortress glory to god he had to put another car on it and my deliverer glory the god of my rock in him will i trust he is my shield glory to god and the horn of my salvation you know and i just i just love that see a horn amen is what is used to protect an animal right so so there are certain animals a man like a ram a ram has horns and when it's time for the for the for the rams to fight they fight with the horns hey man they just they back up and getting them heads going and as fast as they just go going ram against each other but his horn is his protection you know even in the scripture amen uh the lamb over in the book of revelation five had seven horns and the seven horns that was on the lamb was the lamb's protection and those seven horns represented the seven church ages oh i'm here to tell you something this morning you know the reason that people can't pull you out this message you want to know the re i mean they done talked about certain things and sometimes you even agree with some of the stuff they say but you keep coming to church it's a reason that you do that you were placed on the body of the lamb as a horn and you have been brought to this age to be the horns protection now the horn that the lamb is protecting you but you also protecting the lamb my god glory to god amen you are the you are the lamb's protection by being the horn amen you stand against anybody that would come against the word of god you stay with the word because you are ordained to be the lamb's protection [Applause] amen glory glory glory amen the god of my rock in him will i trust he is my shield and the horn of my salvation my high tower look at all these descriptions that that david has my high power glory to god amen he says uh and my refuge glory to god my savior glory to god glory to god amen thou saveth me from violence i will call on the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from my enemies amen when the waves of death compass me the floods of ungodly men made me afraid the sorrows of hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me in my distress i went to the rock i called upon the lord and cried to my god and he did hear my voice out of his temple and my cry did enter into his ears look at this then the earth shook and trembled the foundations of heaven moved and shook because he was wroth god had to come protect me god had to pull me out of that situation and i'm here to declare to everybody god is my rock this is what david is trying to get us to see god god is god is the author and source of all my blessings i'm not gonna forget that their rock is not like our rock thank you jesus and the book of exodus i was telling you earlier the in this definition says it's a vast massive stone as the famous rock of of horup and i want to just take time just to read a man something because i got time uh to read it let's let's turn to exodus chapter 17. glory thank you jesus my my my my now i didn't get what what's the brother's name brother lewis man you you love the word i can see you it's good to have you here praise the lord amen two or three days ago it wasn't by accident brother louis amen you know the opportunity was funny because i had a job that paid me more than the job i entered currently but i got way more from this job than i could have gotten god as god is moving we'll talk after service amen exodus 17 amen verse 3 look at this and the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against moses and said wherefore is this that thou has thou has brought us up out of egypt to kill us in our children and our cattle with thirst and moses cried unto the lord saying what shall i do unto this people they be almost ready to stone me and the lord said unto moses go on before the people and take with thee of the elders of israel and thy rocks he says taken thy hand and go behold i will stand before thee there upon the rock and horeb and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel and he called the name of the place masa and maribel because of the tiding of the children of israel and and because they tempted the lord saying is the lord among us or not the question is is god among us or not and here moses takes his rod the same rod that brought him out of egypt night takes that rod and he smites the rock and water comes out the rock and they want to know whether god was with them or not now i want to read something to you all you know i said i said lord you know i uh you know i read the quote a little earlier where i said i said lord open to us to rock beneath the rock and there was something that i just found out about this story that i don't think i ever heard before amen this is a little rock beneath the rock look at this in the message ever-present water from the rock i want you to catch something that the prophet said it says now we find out that this calvary that they had the waters of life gushed forth for the people it says the waters of life gushed forth for the people now watch this now some people have upon their hearts and mind that all israel drank and then they packed up the camels and tied their hitches on their horses watch this and so forth now they were drinking from the rock glory to god and he said some people have in their mind some people having a mind that what israel did was just just uh uh have their horses and the animals drink from the rock he said some people had upon their hearts and minds that all israel drank and then they packed up the camels and tied their hitches on their horses and so forth and took their kids and journeyed on into somewhere else my god and left the rock there my it says sprinkling that is wrong he said that is wrong they didn't just have their animals in their their children go and drink water from the rock he say the rock followed them the rock followed them so they were asking the question is god with us or not the rock follows you wherever you go i need you to know you are never without the rock [Music] no matter what you going through sometimes you may feel like it sometimes it may seem like it but you are never without the rock the rock followed them they didn't just go and drink from the rock and just get a little water for the day but the rock followed them and kept providing water oh the rock is my provider the rock is my protector the rock is my healer the rock is my deliverer theorock is not like my rock my rock is the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] oh my let me just kind of finish reading this particular quote the rock followed them what a rock that's why i want to go to the rock [Applause] it says that rock followed them and that water followed them my god my god my god it's just i'm so sorry i i didn't give you this one did i give you this one ever present water from the rock and you can the date is going to be 61-07 23 m i want y'all to be able to see that special ones online i'm sorry i missed that y'all forgive me uh and and i and it might be paragraph 103 or you can just you can just type in the rock that rock followed them just put that in it'll come right up that rock followed them amen amen this is the one i wanted and i messed it up but the rock is still with me there it is there it is that rock followed them and that water followed them and he says now in first corinthians the 10th chapter i believe in the 11th verse you can find it that that rock followed israel wherever they went from that day henceforth that rock went with them and the waters followed them this is how the enemies could know that man there's something special about this group they got a rock following them and they can go to the rock at any time and get water anytime you can stop your complaining go to the rock he says what a beautiful type a beautiful hold and an anchor for the believer today that knows that the rock that was once smitten the water that once poured forth from calvary goes with us wherever we are oh my it's not it's not go back to a certain place and say well we did have water day before yesterday over there we got water today right here you know you don't you know i don't have to i don't have to amen i mean the the children of israel were in a place where they didn't have to actually go to a rock the rock went with them once they went to for the first time that rock began to follow them providing water all the time a rock a rock everybody would have to know this is not a normal rock their rock is not like our rock we got water today right here because that rock was christ and christ is the same yesterday today and forever see that rock followed israel they never followed the rock but the rock followed them amen israel went on their journey journey they had but one thing to do that's keep that keep the straight course right straight on into the promised land and the rock and the water followed them the rock following them first corinthians tells you so the 10th chapter all right the rock was christ let's look at first corinthians 10. verse 1 through 4. oh glory man the rock is not like our rock this is some rock here the bible says moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all pass through the sea and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and it all drank the same spiritual drink paul says for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ god opened to us the the the rock beneath the rock and i want to tell you let me just bring it to a close on easter on easter god did just that he opened the seal that was placed on the rock they tried to make it as sure as they could see we don't want them you know and they had already conjured up in their mind the story that they wanted the people to know now we heard this deceiver say if you got that that much concern about the deceiver why would you be at the grave trying to ensure the grave can you imagine all the all the soldiers that are there amen and the guys that on 24-hour duty that they can't move that now look look nobody and i i know they had instructions you better not go to sleep you better not go to sleep you better keep your eyes because this is what they say and we don't want the disciples to come in here and steal the body these same disciples that were running from the soldiers why would these disciples get some courage to come and steal the body no it was a lie that they just wanted to tell they were afraid of the uh of the truth actually being manifested they were afraid of these things happening so they tried to make it as sure as they could i remember my brother my brother troy i thank god for him but he used to he was determined so he he just could not just come into a church a message church he know he just when he wasn't living right say i just can't come to church no i can't do that i say well you know what he said look there's an anointing that is inside the building and so he said if i get into the presence of that anointing i know i won't be able to hold on to the things that i'm holding on to so there was many times that he would dodge church run from church but i'ma tell you when when god got something in you you can't do nothing to get it out of you when god has placed it there before you even born god put it there and no matter how far you run eventually gonna run right into the rock [Applause] many of us can i mean i'm sure many have their own testimonies here how i came in contact with the rock and i found it was just better to yield to the rock the rock is bigger than me [Applause] glory hallelujah but here these fellas say we gonna make this thing as sure as we can say look look look look we want to hire some people to have them on guard we don't want them disciples to come and take his body and then they go around telling everybody he rose again make this thing as sure as you can pilots say okay y'all y'all ain't good enough y'all done y'all don't y'all don't kill the innocent man and i don't wash my hands before you i'm not guilty of this man's death say but y'all you know what y'all go do what you want to do they took out these soldiers took out whatever they could made it as sure as they could three days watching now let's pick up in the scripture what happened i can tell you but i'd like to read it matthew 28 because i skipped some verses i read to you at the beginning matthew 27 verse 62 through 66 and then i skipped to matthew 28 verse 11. and verse 11 says now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and showed them to the chief priests all the things that were done well when they were going well what was done what happened in matthew 28 verse 1 through 10. let's go back and pick it up they tried to make it as sure as they could in the end of the sabbath as he began to dawn toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulcher and behold there was a great earthquake glory to god this is this is i just love god i love god you know earthquake is a grand interruption and let me tell you something when when a person is going through an earthquake all they can do is run for cover oh church all they can do is run for cover and i'm here to tell you that some of our loved ones about to experience a personal earthquake [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i mean when an earthquake happens it happens suddenly you can't plan for an earthquake you can't ensure your property amen for safety hey man you don't care about nothing in your house all you care about is you you yourself getting through the earthquake if the earth open up and swallow up this and swallow look as long as i'm alive i'll be all right god gotta open up and swallow up some relationships god gonna swallow up some friendships god don't swallow up some things that need to be taken out of your life you couldn't get rid of them yourself so he will send an earthquake a spiritual earthquake to take that thing from you [Applause] and i remember a few years ago there was a they had a little uh it was just a a like a sinkhole that opened up here in in florida and this in a way the cinco was in in a house in one room in the house man in his bed and and the earth just opened up from underneath him and all his brother heard is his noise and his brother ran to the room and stopped at the door let me tell you something when you see something like that you don't jump down there in it i'm sorry so when you see a spiritual earthquake hit somebody you can't jump in there you got to run for your own life hey god is doing that for a reason man i don't care what the devil does he can never make this thing as short as he can god will send a supernatural presence an angel to come down and open up the earth the very tomb that they're watching the very tomb that they got a guard around god sends an earthquake no they didn't go to sleep they the earth began to open up things began to happen the angels rolled the stone away and the rock that was beneath the rock the rock that was behind the rock came walking out of there praise god this is why christianity is the only religion that is right [Music] our rock is not locked in rock [Applause] i thought about even over at stonehenge they got all these big rocks and and on went to solstice and and also the spring solstice they they they go and have these little services and everything at the rock their rock is not like our rock and as i was just researching i i had you have to be careful when you start looking into things like that conspiracy behind it all right i just saw the name that the group of people that go are called druids and pagans you think i want to go to stonehenge if druids and pagans are there but i i can tell you this ain't nothing that stonehenge their rock is not like our rock our rock is alive it's a living rock and it provides water every day it sustains you every day it keeps you every day [Applause] my here the bible says in verse two and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and set upon it now what the soldiers gonna do with that religious leaders can't do nothing with that my god his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow and for fear of him the keepers glory to god did shake and became as dead men now they didn't go to sleep this is a story that they were telling and they telling their own testimony but the religious leaders don't even want to hear the soldiers testimony and then they want to pay them don't tell nobody that story now don't tell them what happened to you but look look when god has done something for you can't help but tell what god has done [Applause] say you can't tell it let me tell it what the lord has done for me so so here somebody's paying them not to share their testimony at least not in public don't tell these people what just happened to you we're going to give you money so they took the money and i can i i have a feeling that they still could not get away from telling their testimony now they look they told us they gave us this money i don't spend the money now you know but look i'ma tell you what really happened i was there man it was a rock beneath the rock came out the rock [Applause] and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became his dead man and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for i know that you seek jesus which was crucified oh my my my he is not here for he has risen as he says glory to god as he said he spoke it and he brought it to pass as he said come see the place where the lord lay and i've been there to see the place where the lord lay i'm here to tell you he is not there and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him amen lo i have told you and they departed quickly from the sepulcher with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples word and as they went to tell his disciples behold jesus the rock jesus met them sing all hell and they came and held them by the feet and worshiped him then said jesus unto them be not afraid go tell my brethren that they are going to galilee and there shall they see me i'm so glad he rose again i'm so glad that the rock could not hold the rock and i'm so glad that our rock is not like their rocks you know i i'll close with this this little statement here um i was just i'm going to the message god's chosen place of worship just bear with me just for a little bit yeah i'll read this and i'll close revelation 1 18 says i'm he that liveth and was dead and behold i'm alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death hearing this quote the prophet says now god told them when they before they established the temple and whatever they did i would choose a place of my worship and i put my my name in it and that's the only place that god could ever meet anybody was by his own choosing he chose his place and where he chose his place he put his name the second verse here tells us that he would put his name in the place god's chosen place of worship says he would put his name in the place that he had chosen for people to worship him in now the thing of it is we want to find where that place is says with 900 and something different ideas and actually today he said this in 1965 but today there's i think over 35 or 40 000 different beliefs you got to find truth because everybody ain't telling the truth some of them got part truth but you want the whole truth and nothing but the truth it says with 900 something different ideas being that that being that we're back bypass all heathen religion and just speaking of christian religion which i i have a feeling a feeling for the heathens or i would certainly or certainly wouldn't be going out there over there and talk to them but they're wrong the heathens they're wrong it says christianity is the only origin that religion that's true is christianity and i'm saying that not exactly because i am a christian because i believe that to be the truth it's the only religion that's right it says i've been to the grave where the white horses change every four hours where mohammed a great priest and leader uh right right after christ was supposedly to be a prophet and i don't doubt but what he was right after the maccabee brothers but when when he died he claimed that he would rise again and would conquer the whole world now about every four hours they change guards and they keep a white horse at his at his grave they have for two thousand years expecting him to rise again and conquer the world but you see now let me just uh just pause this just for a second you know um a couple of things i actually mean i i said you know what i want to go read about this um mohammed and the white horse changing the grave and and um i couldn't find specifically what that was saying but i did find amen some people that used to believe the message they posted something saying brother branham lied about this he said he went there to muhammad's grave and he never went there and and in this place where muhammad's grave is it's a big building there is no grace and you know they write about all that they said brother branham lied he did not go there and they say somebody in the message rise up and tell us you know uh if this is true or not because this is a lie and i'm telling you all this because when you read stuff like this you got to watch it you cannot approach god amen with your natural mind with a thought process like that amen it's going to be hard for you to believe the bible how can you talk about what happened in the garden of eden and the man that wrote about it was not there the man that wrote the book of genesis his name was moses moses was not even in uh he was nowhere near the garden of eden how does moses know that god gave eve a promise that hus uh he gonna put imagery between her seed and the serpent see how does moses know that he wasn't there to hear it here's the thing moses god had to catch up in a vision and show him all of the beginning and moses wrote that and that's how we got and i happen to believe what moses wrote and if i got faith enough to believe what moses wrote then i can believe what a prophet might have said he might not have gone there physically but a prophet has the ability to go into the spiritual realm see things that others can't see and come back and show it to us he did it when he went to that brother's house before he prayed for the baby he said does your house look like this your house looks like that does the house do you have this in the house do you have a chair over here do you have chair rail i mean the brother said when have you come to my house brother branham he said i just left and if you approach it from a natural perspective you'll miss that in the spiritual hallelujah so don't don't be questioning little things like that if this is what he said then praise the lord amen i don't belie i i don't believe uh muhammad gonna rise again i don't believe nothing about no buddha but i know christ rose again and that's all i'm that's all i'm focusing on so let's go a little further amen all right and it says and you got buddha you go you go to buddha buddha lived many hundred years about 2300 years ago the god of japan so he was a philosopher something like confucius and so forth but all these founders and so forth all of them died with their philosophy and is buried and in the grave but christianity which is established by jesus christ there is a empty tomb he was the only man that ever stood on earth and lived and said i have power to lay my life down and raise it up again and he did it and he lives today and we know he lives because he is with us and proves himself by physical signs and wonders that he promised that he would do to show it and so much as a pillow fire that led the children of israel through the wilderness it's with us today even having his picture taken performing the signs and wonders that he promised it would do in this day seeing all the words that he promised being made manifest this day therefore the rest of the healing world is out is christianity now we know about the the pill of fire above the prophet's head in houston amen the only supernatural being ever recorded on camera that they have in um the in washington dc at the library of congress we realized that but but you know the pillar fire is not just in the library of congress on a piece of paper where brother quentin was recording on his camera when we were in the old church a few years ago and he picked up on his camera a little light just moving throughout the congregation so when this quote says that the pillar of fire is here performing signs and wonders as he promised it would do in this day saying all the the words that he promised may manifest this day we can say amen to that because we've seen it on camera even in our midst oh the rock the rock will never run dry the rock gonna follow us wherever we go the rock was with us at 39 51 and the rock is still with us at 3777 and when we go to the next place guess what the rock gonna be right there who wouldn't serve a rock like this their rock is not like our rock god richly bless you church happy easter to you let's pray

[Music] thank you lord jesus [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you know as our pastor was preaching my mind went back to a sermon that was preached on easter once the lie that proved risen the lie that proved the resurrection and i never realized that back in those days the romans had a law if you fell asleep while you were doing your job it was a death sentence so when they ask those soldiers go live they are telling them i'm going to give you money to lie before the governor but if this comes to the governor's ears we'll lie to him and cover for you so that if you testify that you went to sleep you're a dead man but we'll secure you that money wasn't worth their lives they were crazy to take that money and i also thought you know brother mccues back in arizona he was the one his mother had the issue when you see that picture with brother brown and brother joseph had their hands up and they were standing on a rock brother branham told brother mccues that's the same rock that followed the children of israel so that rock was way over in arizona at the time the prophet got the message go back and preach the seals it's a living rock still bringing forth living amen our god is a sovereign god he does what he wants to do amen let's bow our hearts almighty god your word is so precious to us lord father we're grateful lord how you use brother jack this morning lord to come and preach such a profound message lord it just it stirs our hearts lord god to see the living god father how you have moved in the children of israel lord we never want to harden our hearts or ask the question of god amongst us father you proved it today lord god by coming in our midst and speaking to us lord it's your voice lord that we heard so father god we just want to honor you and praise you
