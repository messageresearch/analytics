harsh words or whatever but he really needs prayer amen and it came to us i guess tuesday right before the brothers prayer meeting and we heard about it it just struck my heart that you know when it comes to believers things happen to us it's not for ourselves it's for other people it really is you know god may give brother daniel something to preach to the people that are strengthened because of the situation that has arisen i tell you what you know my heart bleeds for nehemiah he's not standing with us but there was something that happened to brother willie that made him being a minister a spectacle to the world and all of us could watch brother willie stay with the word and he has a promise you hold that token over your family amen he has a promise he can stand on and we're believing with him and i believe we're going to see his entire family sitting beside him serving alone [Music] [Applause] that happened to him because he had a strength that none of us had at a time and god knew that and he's still standing he's still preaching he's still believing and we thank the lord for you brother willie we believing with you brother amen so stand on the promises of god amen and we want to keep brother daniel in prayer this morning and we want to pray for the saints that couldn't make it here and those that are traveling amen and we have a little praise report we'd like to give

jay called me and he told me that he was away and he wanted me to preach so i said yeah i will comply so by god's grace we are here amen i hope you're all doing good amen i had her brother say that they should have called him brother shout [Music] well i don't know what i would have been then [Music] because all through my life i've been trying to whisper so if it made me what i am by trying to whisper i wonder what i would have been if the name had not been that [Music] but now i know someone like me is my grandson so he's shouting [Music] uh god bless you whilst you're standing shall we just ten our bibles to the book of fresa 23 so that we can go straight into the reading of the word amen praise the lord amen you've got it on the projector yeah perfect that's it first summer chapter 23 i'm going to start reading from verse 25 here so also and these men went to seek him and they told david wherefore he came down into a rock and aboard in the wilderness of mount and when so had that he pursued after david in the wilderness of mount and saul went on this side of the mountain and david and his man on that side of the mountain and david made haste to get away for fear of soul for saul and his man compassed david and his men round about to take them but there came a messenger unto saul saying hesty and come for the philistines have invented the land wherefore saul returned from pursuing after david and wind against the philistines therefore they called that place selahamalekhov we may be seared i want to take a title from that very last part of verse 28 and they called the place selah malekov and the title i want to speak on is selahamalekhov amen now many times you know us as preachers we're always preaching all the time and the biggest barrel that we have is when you go to a different place what do you actually preach of all the sermons that you have been preaching how he wants to come and preach with grandfather of all the sermons that you've been preaching then you you wonder where am i gonna start from it becomes such a battle but this time around i did not have to battle because when brother jack came to uk over ista what a blessing we had and the saints that came together with him we appreciate every one of them for that but when brother jack came he he was preaching the last service and he preached on a message that he titled our rock is not like they are wrong and we've just been fellowshipping around more like the same thought so when he preached on that at that very time i say to myself when i go to his church i'm going to preach on exactly the same thing so we're just resetting back to easter amen and that's why i'm bringing this subject select amen but let me start by reading what david says in psalms chapter 103 in psalms 103 verse 2 the bible says bless the lord all my soul and forget not all his benefits what a powerful scripture that is bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits in other words worship god save god please god but in all that don't forget his benefits there are benefits in serving god do me a favor and look to somebody next to you and tell them do you know their benefits in serving god their benefits in serving god bless the lord o my soul and forget not his benefits let me say when we serve god amen we come under a heaven full comprehensive coverage we have a policy we have an insurance that covers us fully the prophet of god many a time you know he would be found in this businessman meetings and they would ask him are you a businessman and the prophet always used to say yes i'm in a i'm a businessman i said what business are you in he says i'm in the assurance business we can talk a policy right now if you need one so there is a policy amen and that policy is a blessed assurance hallelujah jesus is mine and one guy say to brother branham and he says oh no but that one won't take you to the grave and brother branham said i'm not worried about going in i'm worried about going out [Music] so we have a policy church and that policy not only does it take us when we go through the river jordan but it takes us out hallelujah it's a blessed assurance jesus when he becomes yours you have this blessed assurance praise god in the highest amen but let me also say that this policy though brother branham speaks about it is taking you out of the grave but it don't start working there it starts working now hallelujah it covers us during this life why do i say that because it has a protection coverage hallelujah amen the scripture says touch not mine anointed in other words i have a protection over them touch not my anointed do my prophets no harm these angels encamp round about them that fear him it is a protection this coverage also has health coverage in it by his stripes we are healed amen with the other ones they might fail amen to honor it but with this one the bank of heaven it always honors any claim to them that come believing by his tribes we are healed and let me also say it is a family coverage when you take the policy it just doesn't cover you it covers you and your household can you say amen can you say amen moses was about to leave egypt and when he was about to leave egypt he said he was asked who is gonna go and moses said we are going with our young we are going with our old not even just that we are also going with our cat oh we are going with our flock not a roof shall remain it covers everything that we have it has a family coverage you have your assets covered it has everything that we need covered under that policy can you say amen somebody then i find a rehab a man in jericho when the spies came she was told yes you have a coverage and this cover will cover your entire family she asked can i bring my mama up say go bring your mama can i bring my papa say go bring your papa can i bring my uncle oh that will come under the token you can bring them if they are protected oh let me say to somebody here you have a policy that covers not only you but your loved ones apply the token and when you apply the token they will come under that token the devil have to let them go i don't care who it is but the devil will have to let them go and the good thing about this policy is you don't need money to buy it come by of me without money and without price so we have the most comprehensive coverage amen and let me say this cover it covers you even when you are not aware you see when you have a policy you have to be aware of the contents of your policy that when a claimable event happens you should be able to go and claim against your policy now if you don't go to claim they are not going to come and tell you we have covered you we are giving you this they don't work that way you got to know the benefits of your claim and when a claimable event happens then you're supposed to go and make a claim so even with hours as well at times you've got to go and make a claim but let me also say it covers us even amen when we are unawares that's how faithful our god is that he does not need to explain every single detail to you when he has not even explained what he's about to do you just find that there are benefits that are accruing when you are sleeping you find there are benefits that are accruing why because we have a 24 7 coverage the angels of god they came around about them they are not there part-time but they are there on a full-time basis hallelujah that when you are even unaware it is covering you all the same so god does not need to explain everything to us at times we just see benefits they just drop in and you just wake up to say thank you lord i thank you lord now let me get to my semen first samuel we started with the scripture says and david made haste to get away for fear of soul for so and these men compassed david and his men round about to take them but they came a messenger unto souls saying hast thee and come for the philistines have invented the land wherefore saul returned from pursuing after david and went against the philistines therefore they called the place and our title is coming from this verse 28. now many times when you read the bible you find some of these words that are written in their original form so even when the translations happened they were kept in their original form amen now many times when you come across some of these words at times you are given the reason why that word is there but at times we are not told now take for instance when you go into the bible you'll find that isaac dug well and when i said duck the world they called it essec and the reason of it was because they strove with him and then he dug another one and he called it real both and he says the reason of it is the lord has made room for us so we are given the meaning of that word moses had a son and he called his name geshong he says for i've been a stranger in a strange land we find joseph as well joseph amen he had two sons and one he named him manasseh and the other one he named him ephraim and the reason why he called this one manasseh he says the lord had made me to forget my toys and my father's house and then he named the other one ephraim he says for god it caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction so we are told the meanings of these words but then there are times a man where the meaning is not given in the scripture but when you go to the direct translation of the word we will know what the meaning is like jehovah jiren the lord will provide himself a sacrifice jehovah shalom the lord our peace jehovah said kennel the lord our righteousness jehovah sharma the lord is present and i like that one jehovah sharma the lord is present and i believe he's here this afternoon i believe he's here in this church amen so we we get to understand some of these meanings just by the direct translation but then at times there is no direct translation that even comes and you go to dig it up and you find there is nothing to it and in that case that is when now bible scholars they've got to go and dig deep into the word to try and find out but why what was the meaning that was behind this word and such is the word like selahamaleko selahamalekhot is one such word where if you go into the bible you cannot find the direct meaning of it and like i say this is where you go now to looking at the bible scholars you go to look at the history of the places you go to investigate and to find out but what was the real meaning of it now when bible scholars started looking at this they came up with two uh possible meanings for this malek and they say the first one is it's a rock of escape and then the other one is a rock of divisions now the reason why they call or say that it is likely to be a rock of divisions is they try and say it was depicting souls divided mind at this time because at this time amen so is told the philistines have come to invent the land and then so he has to leave that place and then go to fight the philistines and they say that he was in a battle of whether to pursue after david or to pursue after the philistines but unfortunately though they say that but i don't find that to be supported by scriptural events because when you look into the bible if you read here verse number 27 it says there came a messenger unto soul saying haste thee and come for the philistines have invaded the land wherefore saul returned from pursuing after david and went against the philistines i don't read what he's battling in his mind there is an instruction that is given oh a message that has been sent and the message says the philistines have invaded the land and no sooner than he hears that he just makes a decision and he goes straight and he leaves you know fighting david and he goes to defend the land so this rock of division it does not jail with the scriptures are you with me so i don't agree with those bible scholars there but the one that i agree with is the rock of escapes because that is what is supported by scriptural events now let's look into those events this setting of the scripture we know this was at the time when david was a fugitive he was now in the wilderness pursuit of saul and he was running away from from from saul who wanted to kill him then he had this 600 man that came to you know team up with him and when he was there in the wilderness with this 600 man the bible says that these were vain fellas but somehow praise god he managed to tend those vain fellows to become mighty gentle warriors and i wonder how he did it but i believe it was because he was preaching to them that you are not what the devil says you are you are what god says you are you are not what this world is trying to make you to be you are a daughter of god you are a son of god oh let me speak to somebody here and tell you that satan always tries to pull you down but you gotta look yourself in the mirror of the word and say i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god they were called vain fellas they had been made vain because of circumstances of life but when david started to talk to them he says inside of you i see great man i see mighty men of vela i see men that can slay giants and before you knew it they were slain giants from being vain fellas they became mighty gentle warriors transformed by the word and i like that the word transforms us makes us into the image of jesus christ amen now david at that time he's running away from from saul and as he's running away from so you would almost think that this man would not be mindful of the work of god but no not david at a time when he was a fugitive he hears that the philistines have gone to invade this place that was called kela and then david says let me go and rescue keila but before he goes he asks god and he says god should i go and rescue kayla and the philistines had got into kela and they had gone there and they were invading the threshing floors they were taking all the harvest they were taking everything that the children of israel had harvested and you know many a time sayings we read this in the bible that these philistines they would wait until harvest time they get the children of god to do all the laboring all the planting all the harvesting when everything is ready then they come and they just snatch everything what a devil he has never changed his pattern he always waits until you've got somewhere that's when he wants to come in and take what god has given you but at that time amen the prophet of god gives us an example of this man that was called shamga shamga you know the prophet dramatizes this and he says the philistines would come trump trump trump and then they go to take what they had but one day shanghai got angry and he says i've heard enough of this i'm tired of what the devil is doing he picked up an oak's god and he said i might not be a soldier i might not be a trained somebody but i have a big god and he picked up that ox god and he said i'm going after these philistines and he slew them oh god give us some shamgas here yes at times you got to get to a place where you say to satan enough is enough i've seen you around my house for far too long i've seen you around my children for far too long enough is enough we are drawing the line things have got to change oh praise the lord there's got to come a year when you say this year things have got to turn around enough is enough i cannot carry on in this direction i cannot carry on in this side i've got to care to the other side or somebody say amen you gotta get some righteous indignation at a certain point in your life and say no man i'm a daughter of god i'm a son of god i'm a man that is on a mission i'm born for a purpose i'm not just a nobody i'm a son of the living god i came from god and i go back to god my god is on my side and if god be for us then who can be against us amen amen you gotta get angry at some point so david heard that these philistines had come again and they were now inhaler now this david was not part of that city but he knew that these are my brothers and he says if they are my brothers i'm my brother's keeper i'm gonna go and fight and rescue my brothers now keala was was was a gated city it was a city that was under bars so it was a city that was walled so it was a very dangerous undertaking for david to go to that place so david spoke to his man and he says i'm feeling this inspiration can i go can we go and rescue our brothers and the brother says hey david that is a ward city we cannot go into that place they were afraid but david at that time he went and he consulted the lord and the lord told him you can go and you will rescue it oh i like it amen that when god says god it does not matter what is against you it does not matter what the odds are if god is with you then god will fight your battle so god took david into kahela and david went and he rescued the city out of the hands of the philistines god give us some davis that can say yes it is not my battle but it is my brother's battle it is not my battle but it is my sister's battle but as long as my sister is not free of that demon i'll be doing the fasting and i'll be doing the praying that was the spirit that david had he went and he rescued that place and then he said he settled in there then when he was in there then so had that david was inhaler and when saw head that david was there then saul said aha he has gone into a ward city now it's easy for me to go and capture him because he will not run away we'll just compass the place and then we'll take him so that's when now david at that time praised god something had happened prior what had happened there was in a beater we had escaped the sword when doug was slaying the sons of the priests and then he came to kennel where david was and he came with an effort so david then amen he called for that effort look at the wisdom of god that before david is entrepreneur he allows the nebula to come in there with an effort that he can inquire god going ahead of the plan of the wicked devil and our god is still doing the same thing he goes ahead of satan that before amen you get to the place where you are cornered of satan god has already made a way of escape oh let me tell you saints our god is not a reactive god our god is a proactive god before things happen he has already sorted things out so no matter where you are taken to i want you to know that god has already made a way of escape [Music] glory to god so he he goes there amen and inquires of the lord and god says aha this is what is about to take place david is asking god is so gonna come into this place and god says he's coming and he says who the people of the city give me up to saul and he was told yes they will surrender you so david when he heard that then together with his men he escaped and he came out of the place and he went so so by the time he tries to come there david is already escaped but then at the very same time then he goes into this wilderness when he goes into this wilderness that was when he went a man into the wilderness of zeath then the zephites they sold him out and they went and they told saul and they said we have found david he's abiding by here then david hears that saw is coming again and when saw is now coming then david he moves from the wilderness of zeath if you look at the map of israel as if it's just on top here and then just below is the wilderness of my own and in that wilderness of man that's when david then runs into and when he gets into there that's now where we find ourselves in the book of faith samuel chapter 23 which is the scripture that we read he is now escaped a man from the wilderness of sith and is now in this wilderness of mount but they are all in the inheritance of judah so these places are close by one to another now when he's in this wilderness of mount then he here soul is coming along and then so he comes and he starts to encompass roundabout give me that scripture now first summer chapter 23 now in verse number 25 the bible says so also and this man went to seek him and they told david then now verse 26 and so went on this side of the mountain and david and his men on that side of the mountain and david made haste to get away for fear of soul for saul and his men compass david and his men round about to take them now i want you to watch god does not play with words whenever there is a word that is laid in the scripture it is because there is a reason for it the scripture says that david was compass round about now when you are compass round about it means you are surrounded it means he's everywhere and here the scripture says david he made haste for fear of soul so he made haste to get away but what he doesn't realize is though that he wants to get away but he's actually surrounded he doesn't realize that he's actually surrounded he doesn't realize that souls people are all over around him but hallelujah though david does not realize what is going on but there is a god that is in heaven that can see all things and god recognizes that this david is a man that is under a policy he's got a full comprehensive coverage and that coverage it covers him even when he's unawares so though he was unaware but the policy that david was under it had to kick in at that time so god looks from glory and god says aha i see they have surrounded him he's making haste but in whatever direction he goes he shall be found and they will capture him and the light of israel is going to be destroyed so god says ah i anointed this man i cannot cause him to perish at this place i'm gonna protect him so god from glory he orchestrates amen a strategy that is coming from heaven when david is unawares about it you see church there are times when the policy kicks in when we are not aware i find that with the children of israel when baelam and balaka wanted to kiss israel israel was sleeping amen and god was fighting their barrels have you ever read that scripture when bailout amen and balaam were doing whatever they were doing that whole conversation it was between balaam balak and god and israel was never mentioned in it they were not even aware that there were people that were trying to curse and god stopped the curse before it even got to them oh let me tell you this afternoon there are things that are happening behind you and god is cancelling see things and situations before you even know about it oh that's what our policy does amen when you are even know that where but god amen he sends the protection when we get over you in the church when we get before the presence of the lord we shall be surprised when we shall see the battles that god fought for us we shall wish we had praised him amen even more than we praise him now so david is surrounded amen and there is no way of escape for david and he doesn't realize that i'm completely cornered then heaven sees it that there is no way of escape amen and in the seventh dimension god starts to orchestrate a plan that will come onto these three dimensions so god says what do i do he says let me move things around god causes the philistines to go and invade hallelujah israel and then god causes a messenger to run with a message to where soul is and he runs to where so he's and he says unto so that the philistines have invaded the land so so at that time he's left with no alternative he's got to make a decision and the decision is i gotta go and defend the land so he leaves following david he calls all his men up that it surrounded david round about and he says to the people retreat because there is a more aging business and they retreat hallelujah and they go out amen now i'm on verse 27 hallelujah and they came in messenger unto saul saying his thee and come for the philistines have invaded the land wherefore saul returned from pursuing after david and went against the philistines therefore they called that place celekos the rock of our escape so david was now completely surrounded but then god he comes up with a way for him to escape completely contrary to the imaginations of saul completely unawares to what david was seeing but god comes as the escape route out of the place that david had found himself hallelujah so hammer liquor the rock of our escapes he became the escape route for david on that day oh i want somebody right here right now that might be trapped i want you to know that though you are trapped but there is a second there is a man a rock of escape when satan thinks that i've got you now cornered and there is no way out for you but i got some good news for you the reseller record the rock of our escape that you don't need to know what is happening behind the scenes jesus christ our god in glory he makes a way when satan thinks that it is done then god brings that policy and he says this one is insured angels rushed to sister so and so there is a problem in a home rush to the house of brothers so and so there is a problem make a way of escape the rock of our escape when it looks like it is impossible god comes your way and he says i'm here to rescue you let me say to you this afternoon that amen there is a rock of escape no matter what satan is still trying to do or is it still morning whatever it is amen there is the rock of escape and let there be a salah in this congregation this afternoon i don't know what the devil has tripped you on but my message to you is let there be a salah record you might be surrounded by every enemy from every side but i'm speaking the word and i'm saying let there be a shall be a rock of escape oh praise be to god hallelujah don't give up on god irrespective of your situation god is still going away when satan says it is finished god says not when i have not signed god comes with a rescue plan and he says there is salah malek the rock of our escape how does he become the rock of our escape because he's in a class all by himself dextronomy chapter 32 it then says how should one chase a thousand and two ten thousand except their rockets sold them and the lord had shut them up for their rock is not like our rock even our own enemies themselves being the judges our rock church is not like their rock so i don't care what is happening around you but your rock is not like their rock even your enemy being the judge our rock is a special rock oh come on saint our rock is a special rock our rock has feet because my bible says it followed them through the wilderness can you say amen can you say amen and our rock has ears because moses was told speak to the rock oh praise the lord and when you speak to the rock our rock has him out because it can answer hallelujah hallelujah he was to speak to the rock and it will bring forth his waters but watch the scripture it will bring forth yes in other words it's not an eat this rock is a hilly this rock is a person this rock is jesus our rock is not like their rock even our own enemies being the churches or come on church of the living god you have a solid rock that is breaking you you have a solid rock that is on your back amen covering you in every direction hallelujah praise the lord amen when they thought that they were about to die of water but selah malecode came the rock of escape in the form of the rock that followed them in the wilderness let me say no matter how well you are trapped and how the devil amen thinks he has now got you fixed i'm telling you it's not over it is not over or if i can sound it loud and clear when satan comes and says it's over it is not over it's not over until god says it's over hey take courage don't give up on god because he won't give up on you yes he's able he will pick you up from where you are can you say amen somebody hallelujah never allow yourself to be overwhelmed i don't care what the situation is like but never allow yourself to be overwhelmed because you are not of your own you are a child of god you walk with god you don't save god for not there is a god that is in heaven and i got some good news for you the way of escape is here this afternoon whatever satan is trying to do i'm here to announce salah malek you shall escape you are coming out of that situation whatever it is praise god in the eyes amen and amen when there is nothing that us as human beings can do but i'm so glad that i got a god that says when you are not able let me take it up when you have given up let me take it up let me hold it for you my daughter let me hold it for you my son now at mine you are called by my name hallelujah we read of a few examples of how god came to become a rock of escape how many love the bible let me just look at some scriptures here genesis chapter 20. the bible says and abraham janet from thence towards the south of towards the south country and dwelt between kardashian shaw and abraham said of sarah his wife she's my sister and abimelech king of gera sent and took sarah we know this story this is when abraham goes to this place and the king of gera he detects abraham because abraham it says that this sarah is my sister now abraham he's completely cornered he's got no way of getting out of this situation you know church there are times when you are beating all systems out and there's just no way for you to come out of a situation that's exactly what we find here abraham got into that position where he's completely cornered and there's no way for him to come out and i can imagine abraham is told we have come to take your wife because the king wants to marry your sister and the soldiers are just so happy to announce to abraham you are such a privileged man you're gonna be the king's brother-in-law and meanwhile abraham is burning says yes she's my half-sister but but but the wife is already gone but abraham is a man of god i believe then he went down on his knees and he started to pray he called on the name of his god and let's imagine that this was in the morning and abraham as he's praying is us christians you know when we are praying we want an answer to come running and right there abraham says you know what i know my god before 12 o'clock my wife is back here 12 o'clock comes no wife and he ups the gear and he says you know what let me pray until the evening time for in the evening time it shall be light i'm a message believer wait until seven o'clock seven is the number of god's completion he's quoting scriptures seven o'clock comes wife no wife ten o'clock no wife eleven o'clock no wife 12 midnight he gives up now when he has now given up beating all systems out oh glory to god and at that time when he's now beating all systems out salah malek steps in right there in the palace somehow amen just about the time when abraham was saying at seven o'clock something is gonna happen the king suddenly started to feel dizzy and he fell asleep and somewhere along there then the king had a dream and in that dream then god spoke to him and he says return this man's wife oh glory to god let me tell you church it does not matter that you don't see the answer right now but behind the scenes there is a god that is in action there are things that are happening there is god that is moving things into their places [Music] abraham was not aware that god was sending a dream unto this king you are not aware that god is dealing with your situation in a realm where you don't understand oh just trust jesus hallelujah it is like what the prophet of god says about when shadrach meshach and abednego when they were thrown into the fairy fairness what they could see was the fire what they could see amen was the temptation and the trial that was in front of them but the prophet says let's turn the camera a little bit and let's look into heaven in heaven there was a jostling about hallelujah angels coming up saying let me go and i'll flag that water and god says ah just stay put another one comes says let me go and rescue them god says no this is a man's size job i'll go down myself or turn the camera and look what god is doing in a realm that you know nothing about there is something that is taking place sailor hamalek god is fixing a way of escape for you so abraham then you know he just wakes up because i believe they couldn't take sarah in the evening so they have to wait for the morning then abraham he wakes up he's now ots but then he sees a motorcade coming along and they come and they say hey so what's happening and they dropped sarah and they drove away then you know they are abraham as sarah so what took place sarah and sarah says i don't know the men just came you know when i arrived yesterday i was put in this nice little room and i was there all night so what happened until this morning these men just came and they said we have been given instruction to take you back to your husband and abraham says ah he knows i'm your husband how did he know i don't know celeko he goes to speak where you don't even know that he's speaking and he returned the man's wife a way of escape and not only it that happened but at the same time as well god according to verse number three but god came to abi like in a dream night and said to him behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou has taken for she is a man's wife but then watch verse number 17 so abraham prayed unto god and god healed abimelech and his wife and his maidsevens and their bear children for the lord had first closed up all the wombs of the house of abimelech so just the moment that they took sarah god moved and he shut up the wombs of all the women in that land of all the cattle in the land of all the flocks in the land that's what god does our god fights amen when we are not even aware that he is fighting let me take another example here in the book of second kings chapter 18 now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah the senate king of assyria come up against all the fence cities of judah and took them and rob shaka said unto them speaking now to hezekiah thus says the great king of assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trust us i've just read verse 13 and verse 19. you know the story this was in the days of hezekiah then in the days of hezekiah this king he comes to invert the king of syria he comes against hezekiah and he comes and he surrounds them and then when he comes now he starts to threaten them and he says which god has been able to deliver them let's look at verse 33 if any of the gods of the nations delivered it all his land out of the hand of the king of assyria where are the gods of hamath and of apart where are the gods of sephiroth hannah and eva have they delivered the have have they delivered samaria out of my hand who are they among all the gods of the countries that have delivered their country out of my hand and the lord should that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of my hand this man comes with a cv and he starts to court his cv and he says look at my cv where are the gods of ivor where are the gods of sephiroth where are the gods of henna where are the gods of ivor who has been able to save me to to save their land out of my hand and look at this church he says if they delivered samaria out of my hand at this time he had actually invaded samaria and samaria was besieged so hezekiah was the king of judah but at that time samaria had actually been taken so it's not even about the god of israel that's what he's trying to say which god has delivered but hezekiah he knew something better when the devil comes quoting his cv you gotta know where you stand with your god hallelujah this man was walking right he was not like the kings of israel the kings of israel the reason why that got away they got to is because they weren't walking right with god but when it came to hezekiah he was a man that was serving god when you know where you stand with your god don't be threatened by the cv of satan you say satan you want to give me your cv let me also read my the cv of my father then you pick your bible and he says let's start at genesis i'm gonna start right on genesis chapter one let's read together satan and by the time you get to genesis chapter 3 then you say satan look here i know who you are you are that serpent and by the time amen you come to the scripture of the seed of the woman that will bruise the head of the serpent you have defeated satan right there you can say i closed god's cv if you want some more come tomorrow he will flee from that moment onwards he will not even come because he knows you know where you stand you'll have a revelation of separate seeds and you can defeat satan any time oh glory to god i don't care how the devil comes to you no matter what he comes saying you know that you are a son of god so he came quoting all this and he says this is what i have done and this is what has happened and everything else but at that time you see hezekiah he made a mistake he was told now let's negotiate and when they started negotiating he said so what is it that you want and he says okay pay me 300 talents of gold and 300 talents of silva hezekiah went into the house of god he started ripping off the door handles he started ripping off everything that was god and he put it together and he paid this man and after he paid this man he thought there was going to be peace let me tell you saints never get into the trap of negotiating with satan he is not being to negotiate with you stand your ground and you say if i perish let me perish but i'm not negotiating with satan you see because when you negotiate with satan then satan will turn around and he will demand more and that's exactly what he did second kings chapter and isaiah said unto them thus shall he say to your master this was in hezekiah a man had now sent a message unto isaiah and he says you know we are in trouble here this day is a day of trouble the time to bring forth has come but there is no strength to bring forth then they send a message unto isaiah and isaiah sent a message back and isaiah said be not afraid of the words which thou has had by with which the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumor and shall return to his own land and i'll cause him to fall by the sword in his own land so rab shekhar returned and found the king of assyria warring against libna and for he had heard that he was departed from larkish exactly what happened with david god does exactly the same thing when hezekiah cries unto the lord then god comes amen and he causes a war to break out in another corner so that the king of assyria he leaves this place to go and defend his own grounds selah maleka and at that time amen then hezekiah is free but as i say church no matter what has happened never negotiate with the devil because then hezekiah he had negotiated with satan senator representing so he came back so in now in second kings chapter 19 verse 14 and hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers and read it and hezekiah went up into the house of the lord and spread it before the lord and hezekiah prayed before the lord and said o god of israel which dwelleth between the cherubim thou art the god even thou alone of all the kingdom of the earth thou has made heaven and earth lord bow down thine ear and hear open lord thine eyes and see and hear the words of sennacherib which had sent him to reproach the living god of a truth lord the kings of assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands and they have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods oh i like this man threatened but knew his position knew the god that he had served knew which god he was on his side he says they are talking about all this is showing me his cv but i know one thing those were not gods those were works of man's hands but thou alone are god now therefore o lord our god i beseech thee save thou ass out of his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord god even thou only then isaiah the son of ammo sent to hezekiah saying thus says the lord god of israel that which thou has prayed to me against sin of carib king of assyria i have heard oh i like a church when it comes to a place when you are praying and you are crying before god and then god turns around and he says that which you have prayed i have heard what a consolation that is that which you have been crying about i have heard oh let me speak to somebody here you see god speaks in a very simple way the prophet of god says the closest place to heaven on earth is behind the pulpit how does god speak to us through the preaching of the word when you come to church praise the lord it is god that is going to be speaking to you when i come to church i don't come to hear a preacher i come to listen to what god is saying through the preacher even if i'm the preacher but i'm also waiting to hear what god is gonna say about my situation oh church i came to a place sometime in my life where i said you know what i got to be the first person to believe the message i preach i'm not here to preach to others i'm here to be preached to you as well so whilst the word is going forth i'm also feasting on exactly the same word so if there is gonna be a benefit oh glory to god that will come to the church let it not be the congregation only but let it also be me that starts by benefiting because i believe the preacher so when you come to church come expecting to hear what god is saying about your situation now i have what god is saying about your situation and i've lined it up and read that which thou hast prayed to god amen the lord has heard oh let me speak to somebody that prayer that you have been praying about god is heard or get ready amen tomorrow to receive an answer get ready amen this very coming week to receive an answer that which you have been praying about the lord has heard oh come on florida come on spirit and truth that which you have been praying about the lord has heard i don't know who i'm speaking to here i don't know who is ready to receive i don't know who says yes lord i've been waiting for my answer i've been waiting lord patiently waiting but here comes the answer by the prophecy of the word that which you have prayed about the lord has heard therefore increase your expectation or praise the lord wait for that phone call or praise the lord wait for that letter or praise the lord wait for that thing that you have been crying about can you say amen somebody can you say amen somebody our rock is not like their rock our rock has ears our rock ears and when he hears he speaks back speak to that rock hallelujah glory to god verse 21 this is the word that the lord has spoken concerning him the virgin the daughter of zion had despised me and loved thee to scorn the daughter of jerusalem it's shaken ahead at thee oh i love this church of the living god there's got to come an hour when it's the bride of jesus christ you got to shake your head you got to say no no more satan enough is enough i can't have this anymore when you shake your head you are refusing it's a sign to say no the daughter of zion the bride of jesus christ is now shaking her head she's saying no more blood pressure no more sugar diabetes no more sickness no more trouble in my family i'm shaking my head i don't know who it is this afternoon that can say i'm looking at my problem in the face and i'm shaking my head i'm saying no more this guy who come and change and after this service after this service oh who receives it after this service i'm gonna say to satan it's over it's over yes you can snap into your liberty right now whilst the world is going forth while peter yes peck the holy ghost he fell upon the people who is thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom has thou exulted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high even against the holy one of israel but i know they are bored and i going out and i coming in and i rage against me because thy rage against me and thy trauma is come up into mine ears therefore i'll put my hook in thy nose and my breather in my lips and i'll turn thee back by the way by which thou comest god says god tell this devil i'm gonna put my hook oh glory in his nose and i'm gonna drag him until i chuck him out because he don't belong in your body he don't belong in your arm he don't belong in the church of the living god therefore thus says the lord concerning the king of assyria he shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with a shield nor cast a bank against it by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall not come into the city says the lord for i will defend this city to save it for my own sake and for my servant david sack oh let me say to somebody this afternoon the lord would defend this city the lord will defend this tabernacle the lord will defend that body of yours the lord will defend that family of yours that devil is not going to come and take you over no i refuse i refuse in jesus christ's name you are a daughter of god hallelujah god says i will defend the city and i will save it verse 35 and it came to pass that night that the angel of the lord went out and smote the camp of the assyrians in a hundred four score and five thousand and when they arose in the morning behold they were all dead corpses israel did not need to fight seller hammer lakoth he went in the middle of the night and he was the way of escape he smote them amen and my bible says here in a hundred fosco and five thousand my glory to god and when they woke up in the morning it was old dead corpses nothing alive no sword lifted no barrel thoughts or tomorrow when you wake up or who receives it tomorrow when you wake up get ready to see some dead corpses everywhere your situations are destroyed or you know what sayings i've never preached like this and nobody comes with a testimony you will be the first ones if there's no one that comes with the testimony but let me tell you somebody is going to come up with the testimony to say you know what when i wake up i'll find dead corpses i'll find my battles already been won or glory to god so senator king of assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt in nineveh and it came to pass as he was worshiping in the house of nescor his god that adramalek and shereza his sons smote him with a sword and that was the end of the king of assyria don't play with the children of god [Applause] all church of the living god there are so many examples that we find in the world but as we are fixing to come to a clause but let me come to david again here celekov is what david called the name of that place i believe it was david that code is because he had the revelation of what had happened but i want you to watch by interpretation it is not the rock of our escape as in singular but it is the rock of our escapes as in plural why is it the rock of our escapes hallelujah when david said selah maleco verse 28 here it was in the rock of escape which was a single escape but it was the rock of escapes david at this time he had experienced many escapes twice he escaped the javelin he had also escaped the plot of soul when he said i want a 104 skins for my diary here he's kept the plot of saul when he wanted to use his daughter to slay david so david had experienced many a time how the escape of god had come so he knew i am where i am not because i am smart not because i am able but with him i can run through a troop with him i've lived over a wall it is through jesus that i've been able to do what i do so he says seller hammer record the rock of escapes and what does that tell me church what it tells me is that god is not a god of a single escape he's a god of many escapes and what he tells me is that he is the same yesterday today and forever and let me say if god ever gives you an escape the same god if you are found in another trap he will give you another escape because he's the rock of escapes he's not a rock of one escape he's a rock of escapes if you have any testimony in your life no matter what the devil puts you in you can look back into your testimony and you say the god of yesterday he's still the same god even today oh he has a testimony here something that happened some years back something that you can look back to and you can say it was in that year of 2000 god came to my rescue it was in that year of 2010 god came to my rescue i'm saying the same god is here present and he's here to rescue you the rock of your escapes and let me say church whenever you have a testimony be in the habit of recording your testimony of keeping evidences of your testimonies hallelujah jacob when he was coming from his home running from esau going to lab and his father-in-law he came to a certain place that was called battle and he had an experience at that place and it better after hearing experience the bible says he erected a stone there hallelujah he placed it right there as a memorial and you find when jacob is now coming back to his land amen he stays in another place but eventually then god speaks to him and he says return to bethel where i first met you there was a sign that he left at that place let me say when god does something for you take a testimony if it means taking a picture take a picture if it means writing something write it if it means filing it file it why should you do it because you know there are times when the devil will begin to rage and he will begin to tell you that god has forsaken you but when the devil comes like that open your notebook and you start with him the year that you repented oh praise be to god and say it was in this year's satan 20 years ago i met the lord two years later he gave me the baptism of the holy ghost and i recorded the day five years later he came to my rescue ten years later this is what happened in my life another year this is what happened in my life and brother before you finish naming your testimonies satan is already on the door he's already left your house before you step into a depression read your testimonies tell the old man devil i know who i am i know where i came from i know where i'm going i'm not an accident and i'm not an incident i'm a servant of god oh who am i speaking to here that can say yes i i know who i am i have some testimonies in my life you know every believer is going to have some testimonies somewhere where you can point back to and you can say god came to my rescue on such and such a day hallelujah so david had experienced these escapes then david he now comes in psalms chapter 124 and this is where i'm going to finish off it praise the lord and david writes and he says if it had not been for the lord who was on our side now may israel say and i want you to read your names into the scripture if it had not been for the lord who was on our side let spirit and truth tabernacle say we are here by the grace of the lord if it had not been for the lord who was on our side if it had not been for the lord who was on our side when men rose up against us then they had swallowed us up quick when their wrath was kindled against us blessed be the lord who have not given us as they pray to their teeth our soul is escaped as a bed out of the snare of the fowler the snare is broken and we are escaped our help is in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth oh let me speak to somebody here and say if it had not been for the lord who was on your side oh shout somebody if it had not been for the lord who was with me all along how would i have made it here but i got some good news the snare is broken the snare is broken whatever the snare of the devil is i got bad news for satan the snare is broken it's a bird you can escape out of the prison of satan if you're in the bondage of blood pressure the snail is broken up if you're in the bondage of sickness the snail is broken out if you're in the bondage of whatever situation oh stand to your feet and shout my snare is broken i'm accepting my liberty i'm accepting my freedom the snail is broken oh come on child of god snap out of that situation the snare is broken hey like a bird out of a prisoner you can snap into freedom the snare is broken don't be like johnny claw when johnny crow when the snare was broken but because he was fixed in that place for too long he could not recognize that the snare is broken other birds used to come by and they will say come on johnny crawl let us go it's time for winter and johnny crow would say i'm bound you are no longer bound the snare is broken hey come on bride of jesus christ who feels some freedom who says yes i feel i'm free i feel i can jump i feel i can shout i feel i can praise god the snare is broken i'm free by the grace of god i'm liberated by the grace of jesus

escape is here seller i'm a recorder oh glory to god yes this battle is not yours this barrel is the lord's stand still and see the salvation of the lord his deliverance is here praise god in the eyes but i want you to watch something here he says our soul is escaped as a bed out of a snare of a foul the snare is broken we are escaped look david the way he speaks he is talking about a physical escape but yet he says what has escaped is his soul our soul is escaped but yet the escape was physical so how does it become a soul escape what day if it is telling us here is that there is a source of power there is a rock of so-so and what is so-so the prophet says he says that spiritually and he saves us physically and when he saves you spiritually it has got to translate to physically you can be saved spiritually and remain in bondage physically our soul is escaped and if the sow is escaped then they must be physical escape as well god bless you this afternoon god bless you this afternoon whatever it is i want to say to you selah malekov the rock of our escape is here god rescues you against the devil's wishes and the devil's desires as we bow our heads i wonder who it is here that
