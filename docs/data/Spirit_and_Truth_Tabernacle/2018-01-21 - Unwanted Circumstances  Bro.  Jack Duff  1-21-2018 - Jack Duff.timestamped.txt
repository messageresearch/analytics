[1:09:43] visitors that I heard their names and so
[1:09:46] glad to have them here and in fellowship
[1:09:48] as well on this morning and man
[1:09:51] yesterday I got a call from someone that
[1:09:57] was asking about when service was
[1:09:59] starting and when they called me they
[1:10:04] were speaking to me and Creole and
[1:10:06] didn't understand that I don't know that
[1:10:10] many words and in Creole and I wasn't
[1:10:14] sure if they they made it here not I
[1:10:16] don't know if they were or you know
[1:10:18] callin wrong Church what I just told him
[1:10:20] what time service started and I just
[1:10:22] left it in God's hands if you know if it
[1:10:25] was the wrong Church God knew why he did
[1:10:28] that so you know we praise the Lord for
[1:10:31] for that a man and a man we just we just
[1:10:36] appreciate the Lord Jesus I'm gonna I'm
[1:10:39] gonna turn a man to actually turn with
[1:10:42] me to James chapter 1 a man James
[1:10:46] chapter 1 and we'll we'll just read a
[1:10:51] scripture from there
[1:10:59] praise the Lord James chapter 1 and I
[1:11:02] think the song a couple songs the song
[1:11:06] that we opened the service with a man
[1:11:08] why should I feel discouraged his eyes
[1:11:11] on the sparrow that that was I think
[1:11:13] time right into the sermon then you have
[1:11:16] God alone you know no matter what I'm
[1:11:18] going through he's still God and and if
[1:11:22] if you're a Christian a man
[1:11:26] Ginuwine Christian you got something you
[1:11:28] going through everybody in here got
[1:11:31] something that going through you know
[1:11:33] because like brother Branham told Billy
[1:11:36] policy because if he was just
[1:11:38] complaining about the devil always after
[1:11:39] me saying that's a good thing so I say
[1:11:41] why is that a good thing that the devil
[1:11:43] always after sake because if he always
[1:11:44] after you that mean he don't got you
[1:11:47] he's still chasing you alright so keep
[1:11:50] that devil on the run run until they get
[1:11:52] tight alright Amen thank you but let's
[1:11:56] read here too much on my monitor just
[1:12:00] turn it down just a little bit and let's
[1:12:04] let's go here to verse 2 says my brother
[1:12:07] encounted oh joy when you fall into
[1:12:12] divers temptations that's many a man you
[1:12:16] go you go from one trial to the next
[1:12:19] trial to the next trial and what you
[1:12:21] supposed to do when that happened is
[1:12:23] actually put a smile on your face you
[1:12:26] supposed to count it all joy my car
[1:12:30] stopped working oh praise God
[1:12:32] hey when you when you and when you get
[1:12:36] when you get a revelation you're gonna
[1:12:37] start thanking God you're gonna catch a
[1:12:39] vision of your new car then you're just
[1:12:43] gonna be smiling and the devil gonna be
[1:12:46] looking that's like why are they
[1:12:48] shopping shopping because the Bible says
[1:12:52] count it all joy
[1:12:58] my brother him count it all joy when you
[1:13:01] fall into divers temptations knowing
[1:13:05] this that the trial of your faith
[1:13:07] worketh patience but let patience this
[1:13:12] is the this is key statements let
[1:13:14] patience have a perfect work that ye may
[1:13:18] be perfect and entire wanting nothing if
[1:13:23] any of you lack wisdom let him ask of
[1:13:26] God that giveth to all men liberally and
[1:13:28] upbraideth not and it shall be given him
[1:13:31] but let him ask in faith nothing
[1:13:36] wavering so don't ask today and start
[1:13:40] doubting tomorrow right nothing wavering
[1:13:43] no matter what you hear just don't waver
[1:13:46] in your faith so he that waiteth is like
[1:13:49] a wave of the sea driven with the wind
[1:13:53] and stalks
[1:13:55] you got a such a anchor down right for
[1:13:58] let not that man think that he shall
[1:14:01] receive anything of the Lord so when
[1:14:03] you're wavering you'll never get
[1:14:04] anything from God never right says a
[1:14:07] double minded man is unstable in all his
[1:14:10] ways a man so you want to keep the faith
[1:14:13] no matter what it is that you're you're
[1:14:16] going through I am I'm gonna I'm let's
[1:14:20] have a word of Prayer and I'm gonna read
[1:14:21] another scripture a man after that just
[1:14:23] kind of set a background for where we
[1:14:26] will what we'll deal with on today but
[1:14:30] let's just have this word of Prayer
[1:14:31] father we we are grateful for the
[1:14:34] anointing that is in the house today and
[1:14:38] God when anointing is like this coming
[1:14:41] to the house is unlimited what you could
[1:14:43] do in the midst of your people
[1:14:45] so God as we enter into a man just
[1:14:48] thought for today the less the ears that
[1:14:52] were here bless the mouth that would
[1:14:53] speak got hot I saw behind the Carlstedt
[1:14:57] none of us would be seen but may Christ
[1:14:58] be on display today and Jesus name we
[1:15:02] pray amen amen god bless you can be
[1:15:05] seated
[1:15:05] amen
[1:15:10] amen and if we could just turn over to
[1:15:13] Genesis 30:1 I want to use that for
[1:15:17] context and and and our title for today
[1:15:21] is unwanted circumstances amen
[1:15:26] unwanted circumstances and if we all
[1:15:31] were to be honest we all have those
[1:15:35] things in our life
[1:15:37] things that happen that Amen we just
[1:15:41] don't want right a man and I know the
[1:15:44] Bible tells us to count it all joy but a
[1:15:47] man sometimes it's difficult when you
[1:15:50] have a circumstance that's just not
[1:15:52] comfortable right it you know it
[1:15:55] presents a challenge right it's not just
[1:16:00] going along with a man the flow but it
[1:16:03] feels like I'm swimming upstream right
[1:16:06] rather than just kind of going with the
[1:16:08] current and and all of us Amen at
[1:16:10] different times in our life we get these
[1:16:13] unwanted circumstances y'all just hold
[1:16:17] your finger on Genesis 30:1 I'm coming
[1:16:19] to that a man and a little bit we will
[1:16:22] use the story of Jacob as a background
[1:16:25] for this but unwanted circumstances a
[1:16:29] man let's look at this a quote out of
[1:16:31] the sermon Elijah and the mill offering
[1:16:35] Elijah and the meal offering a man glory
[1:16:40] to God is that right
[1:16:42] okay you know it says this in Germany
[1:16:49] they got they got a picture they call it
[1:16:53] the cloud picture it's a competitor this
[1:17:00] great picture of the crucifixion at
[1:17:03] Forest Lawn in Los Angeles the great
[1:17:06] picture it so it's as wide as this
[1:17:08] building is a cross they had to build a
[1:17:11] building around the picture many of you
[1:17:13] have seen it but this in Germany is
[1:17:15] called the cloud Dane I believe is
[1:17:19] called and when you when you get off
[1:17:21] from a piece
[1:17:22] and look at it oh it looks hideous
[1:17:26] looks like angry clouds are mixing
[1:17:28] around one another like that as the
[1:17:31] light reflects on it and look look like
[1:17:33] the clouds are moving as the way the
[1:17:36] pictures made to reflect the lights
[1:17:37] makes it look like the cloud and angry
[1:17:40] storm coming to tear up everything and
[1:17:42] then you're told by the guy won't close
[1:17:46] up a man and just keep watching it right
[1:17:49] because from a distance when you're
[1:17:51] looking at it it looks like it's just a
[1:17:53] bunch of angry clouds right but as as as
[1:17:57] the guy tells you walk closer and just
[1:17:59] just keep watching it it says when you
[1:18:01] get real close to it it isn't clouds
[1:18:04] it's angel's wings beating together
[1:18:08] rejoicing it's a blessing in disguise
[1:18:11] meant and I want to tell you this
[1:18:15] morning you have an unwonted
[1:18:17] circumstance in your life but that
[1:18:20] unwanted circumstance no matter what it
[1:18:22] is if it's financial trouble if it's
[1:18:24] advanced sickness in your body if it's
[1:18:27] something going on in your family it's a
[1:18:29] man it's an unwanted circumstance but
[1:18:32] it's also a blessing in disguise man
[1:18:36] it's all in the way that you look at it
[1:18:39] hallelujah glory to God
[1:18:41] see so he goes on the city says maybe
[1:18:44] your sickness tonight maybe your
[1:18:46] sacrifice to come out here was just a
[1:18:49] blessing in disguise meant the angels of
[1:18:52] God are here present to join their wings
[1:18:54] together and rejoice because it's
[1:18:57] written in the scripture that the angels
[1:18:59] of heaven rejoiced when one sinner
[1:19:00] repents thinking that but thus saith the
[1:19:02] Lord Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:19:04] today and forever his grace cannot be
[1:19:07] exhausted and he's willing to give you
[1:19:09] anything your heart's desire amen so you
[1:19:12] know as I was looking at this you know
[1:19:14] we all have it you know different things
[1:19:16] that happen but I have I have noticed in
[1:19:19] my own just in my own life that you know
[1:19:22] when we have unwanted circumstances
[1:19:25] often times God is using that in order
[1:19:28] to birth something else hallelujah to
[1:19:32] the lamb of God
[1:19:32] and then God is used and it just to
[1:19:35] burst something else and and you know I
[1:19:37] was I was just kind of reflecting on a
[1:19:39] couple of things that happened one was
[1:19:41] this week you know one of the one of the
[1:19:44] one of the brothers had an unwanted
[1:19:45] circumstance he was on his way home and
[1:19:48] as he was on the way home his tire just
[1:19:50] just went flat on him just like that
[1:19:53] just going and and and I don't know what
[1:19:55] happened he had called me but I didn't
[1:19:57] get the message
[1:19:58] a man in the in time you know and then
[1:20:01] when I finally called him back he said
[1:20:02] I'm already home I'm already home passed
[1:20:04] I said well what happens he I called me
[1:20:06] at Obon and they came and got me off the
[1:20:08] side of the road now and I'm home I say
[1:20:10] well praise the Lord for that you know
[1:20:12] rather than sit out there and just kind
[1:20:13] of complain right he said I took I took
[1:20:16] matters in my own hands I got me uber
[1:20:18] and I'm already home I'm good and then
[1:20:20] you know then you know what what I
[1:20:21] realized is that on the next day within
[1:20:23] 24 hours the same brother that had a man
[1:20:26] a flat tire where the devil thought he
[1:20:28] would have discouraged him that he had
[1:20:30] one flat tire but on the next day he was
[1:20:32] blessed with four newer tires seat seat
[1:20:36] seat seat it was a it was it looked like
[1:20:39] that I wanted circumstance but it
[1:20:41] happened to be a blessing in disguise
[1:20:43] meant color everything that happens God
[1:20:46] is using that to bring glory to himself
[1:20:50] so stop giving the devil credit start
[1:20:53] giving the devil abraham any glory and
[1:20:56] honor God and shoes in that for his
[1:20:59] glory hallelujah so you gave me one flat
[1:21:03] tire but I got full newer tires that's
[1:21:08] where you got it you got it you got to
[1:21:09] talk back to that devil right I was
[1:21:12] reminded you know of something here you
[1:21:15] know that the sisters prayer meeting and
[1:21:17] the brothers prayer meetings that and
[1:21:20] then we had we had prayer that sweet
[1:21:21] lord knows we had some prayer this week

[1:21:30] and you know we didn't we didn't know
[1:21:32] who all was just going to show up but
[1:21:34] you know I out of nowhere you know
[1:21:38] brother Kenny walked in and he came in
[1:21:40] with company and when he came in with
[1:21:43] company he had a son
[1:21:45] with them and he say he said my
[1:21:48] son-in-law called me and said he wanted
[1:21:50] to go to church and I told him about the
[1:21:53] prayer meeting but I can't tell them
[1:21:54] where the prayer meeting was besides
[1:21:56] just tell them we had prayer me and said
[1:21:58] I'd get back with you in a couple days
[1:21:59] to let you know you know about it so
[1:22:01] rather than brother Ken and get with him
[1:22:03] the son-in-law actually taxed him and
[1:22:06] said hey you said something by prayer

[1:22:19] minutes to go get him went all the way
[1:22:20] down and got him and brought him to

[1:22:24] street he turned on having someone say

[1:23:08] one of his son wants a circumstance that
[1:23:10] his job ended on that day but had he
[1:23:14] been working he would not have been able
[1:23:15] to make it to prayer it was an unwonted
[1:23:19] circumstance but it was a blessing in
[1:23:22] disguise Mitch lord I thank God for that
[1:23:27] you know the whole whole premises of the
[1:23:31] prayer amen the whole premises of the
[1:23:33] prayer was was birthed out of an
[1:23:35] unwarranted circumstance
[1:23:38] it was birthed out of unwanted
[1:23:40] circumstance and you know I mean we as
[1:23:42] some of us might not realize that but it
[1:23:45] was it was something that I wanted that

[1:24:24] a blessing that's something I want you
[1:24:26] to remember I wanted circumstances will
[1:24:29] give birth to a blessing Wednesdays
[1:24:34] y'all gonna bring y'all pins and y'all
[1:24:36] paper and y'all gonna catch what the
[1:24:38] Lord saying y'all I wanted circumstances
[1:24:42] will give birth to a blessing that's why
[1:24:46] James can say counted all Joey all right
[1:24:48] stay with me stay with me Old Glory God
[1:24:52] uses unwelcome unwanted circumstances to
[1:24:54] draw us closer to him right it's an
[1:24:57] opportunity for an attribute of God to
[1:25:00] be expressed and then the relationship
[1:25:03] becomes more meaningful when when new
[1:25:07] attributes are expressed from God
[1:25:09] hallelujah you began to know him on a
[1:25:11] deeper level when those attributes
[1:25:13] expressed sickness amen produces the
[1:25:17] attribute of healing sin produces the
[1:25:22] attribute of redemption and mercy right
[1:25:25] and see what mercy is it's pitying and
[1:25:28] compassion towards the distressed I know
[1:25:31] I was distressed and I needed some pity
[1:25:33] I needed some compassion but my skin
[1:25:36] produced the attribute of redemption and
[1:25:39] mercy
[1:25:39] listen backsliding will produce the
[1:25:42] attribute of restoration come on
[1:25:45] somebody bondage will produce the
[1:25:48] attribute of deliverance a broken
[1:25:51] relationship will produce the attribute
[1:25:54] of reconciliation
[1:25:55] that produced the attribute of the
[1:25:59] mighty Conqueror and let me tell you
[1:26:03] something else when divine love is
[1:26:04] projected and comes to us in it produces
[1:26:09] the attribute of sovereign grace
[1:26:11] hallelujah and grace is what we call
[1:26:14] God's favor I don't know if any of y'all
[1:26:17] ever experienced that but grace when you
[1:26:21] say I'm walking underneath the grace of
[1:26:23] God you just told somebody I'm
[1:26:25] experiencing God's favor when there was
[1:26:34] chosen to produce the Christ child and
[1:26:36] then the angel said Mary you are highly
[1:26:39] favored hallelujah no matter what you're
[1:26:44] going through I don't care how big and
[1:26:45] how bad that trial is you are still
[1:26:47] highly favored in God's eyes and the
[1:26:50] trial did not come to break you but the
[1:26:52] trial came to actually build you up Oh
[1:26:55] glory to God count it all joy Church
[1:26:58] count it all joy let's look at this look
[1:27:00] at something here that's the sermon
[1:27:03] resurrection of Lazarus
[1:27:04] stay with me here today he says Lazarus
[1:27:08] took sick theologians believe he died
[1:27:11] with him urges of the lungs that I don't
[1:27:14] know the Bible don't say nothing some of
[1:27:17] the writers said it was alright he got
[1:27:19] sick and sometimes God tries your faith
[1:27:23] do you believe that every son that
[1:27:25] cometh to God must be tried think it not
[1:27:29] strange the fact that fiery trials come
[1:27:32] because it's not it's only done to
[1:27:34] perfect your faith draw you closer
[1:27:37] they're worth more than go to you your
[1:27:40] trials are worth more than go to you
[1:27:43] alright that of them when these things
[1:27:45] begin to take place Mary Martha sent and
[1:27:47] said have Jesus come back and pray for
[1:27:50] him and Jesus just ignore their call he
[1:27:53] went to another city far away well well
[1:27:55] then they sent again he still ignored
[1:27:57] their call sometime when you pray you
[1:27:59] feel the same way Mary and Martha that
[1:28:01] God just ignoring your prayers but in
[1:28:04] the midst of in the midst of you
[1:28:06] going through something like that you
[1:28:07] got to realize God is using that to
[1:28:08] actually strengthen you right he's not
[1:28:11] trying to come and defeat you but he's
[1:28:13] trying to strengthen you and see and
[1:28:15] often times when you're going through
[1:28:16] these are the times where we're we're
[1:28:18] spoken word this kind of comes out of
[1:28:21] your mouth you begin to say things by
[1:28:22] faith hallelujah you begin to speak
[1:28:26] things by faith and and the problem is
[1:28:28] is that when you when you release it out
[1:28:30] of your mouth that's the seat that's
[1:28:32] being planted and when you plant that
[1:28:35] seed don't dig it up with your doubt
[1:28:37] right just because it didn't happen
[1:28:40] overnight don't dig it up with your
[1:28:41] doubt you keep holding on to what you
[1:28:44] said out of your mouth and watch that
[1:28:46] thing come to pass no devil can stop it
[1:28:51] no devil can stop it especially when God
[1:28:54] spoke it however use somebody already
[1:28:59] got unwanted circumstances will produce
[1:29:02] a blessing in your life let me give you
[1:29:05] a couple of people that have some
[1:29:07] unwanted circumstances there was a
[1:29:10] father and mother that had a child come
[1:29:14] up and one at all his his inheritance
[1:29:16] before his parents died he wanted his
[1:29:19] inheritance and he wanted to leave and
[1:29:20] he was going to go out into the world
[1:29:22] and just become his own man not to those
[1:29:25] parents just wasn't unwarranted
[1:29:26] circumstance but when that boy got out
[1:29:29] there and a man and the Bible said that
[1:29:31] he was involved in riotous living he was
[1:29:33] doing things that his parents would not
[1:29:35] be pleased to know that he was doing it
[1:29:38] brought shame on the family name to know
[1:29:40] that that boy was out there doing stuff
[1:29:42] like that right but but but but what God
[1:29:45] did is letting the board get to a spot
[1:29:47] where all he could do is look up he got
[1:29:50] so low that all he can do is looked up
[1:29:52] he found himself living a man not not
[1:29:55] only not only living a pretty much
[1:29:57] paycheck-to-paycheck I was doing that
[1:30:00] but he got to a spot where you know the
[1:30:02] job was so low and in certain jobs I
[1:30:04] mean as a as a as a Jew as an Israelite
[1:30:08] he was not supposed to take that job but
[1:30:10] he got into a situation so low he had to
[1:30:12] take the top where he feeding pigs and
[1:30:14] as he give up that feeding pigs he
[1:30:16] looking at what the pigs eat and they
[1:30:18] say I'm sorry
[1:30:19] hoping that what they eat is better than
[1:30:21] what I'm eating he started eating the
[1:30:23] same thing the pigs were eating God let
[1:30:26] the man get so low it was an unwanted
[1:30:29] circumstance in his life but God was
[1:30:32] choosing that thing to become a blessing
[1:30:36] when he realized how low he was he said
[1:30:39] even the service in my daddy's house
[1:30:41] they live better the way I'm gonna let
[1:30:45] me get up from here go back to my
[1:30:47] daddy's house
[1:30:48] God will use unwanted circumstances to
[1:30:52] drive people back God will use those
[1:31:01] circumstances to drive them right back
[1:31:03] into expresses here comes this boy you
[1:31:07] know daddy and Mama praying for him and
[1:31:08] looking for me one day they see him
[1:31:10] walking up and mine when it comes back
[1:31:13] that I want to circumstance introduce
[1:31:16] the blessing and the boys like when they
[1:31:17] get back to dad and said daddy I'm not
[1:31:19] even worthy to be called your son
[1:31:20] I don't did this and I did that I don't
[1:31:23] embarrass you or embarrass the family
[1:31:24] just let me be a servant assigned to a
[1:31:26] house and an indenter said no no no no
[1:31:29] no no I don't care I don't care what
[1:31:31] you've done you can never be a servant
[1:31:33] because she was born a son and if you
[1:31:37] were born a son you gonna die a son a
[1:31:39] man that is your status that is your
[1:31:42] position you always be sudden his I want
[1:31:48] a circumstance produced a blessing they
[1:31:50] kill the fatted calf they gave him a
[1:31:53] ring of gold they put him on a rope and
[1:31:55] they reestablish it position as son and
[1:31:59] not servant this was reconciliation and
[1:32:02] restoration the unwarranted circumstance
[1:32:05] produced that in and reconciliation and
[1:32:08] restoration what about David he has some
[1:32:12] unwanted circumstances in his life he
[1:32:14] was disrespected by his father and
[1:32:16] disrespected by his brethren he got
[1:32:19] hired for a job that he did not apply
[1:32:21] for he was recommended for the job and
[1:32:24] you know sometimes you can some of you
[1:32:26] go through I want to circumstance on the
[1:32:29] job you know God gave you that job you
[1:32:32] know God gave
[1:32:33] to you I heard you give the testimony in
[1:32:35] touch about when God gave you that job
[1:32:40] and if God gave it to you years ago when
[1:32:44] to be taken away you just gone through
[1:32:47] unwanted circumstances it don't change
[1:32:50] the testimony God gave you it's your job
[1:32:53] and don't you let no devil drive you
[1:32:57] away from what God bless you live don't
[1:33:04] let the devil take it from your guy can
[1:33:06] I tell ya it's just an unwonted
[1:33:10] circumstance see what David got on this
[1:33:17] job he didn't he don't apply for this
[1:33:18] somebody recommended him and and they
[1:33:22] recommend him because of the anointing
[1:33:24] that was in his life so you got certain
[1:33:26] things inside of you that's why they
[1:33:28] want you in the place that they got you
[1:33:30] because of what you have inside of you
[1:33:31] but when you get there you can't expect
[1:33:34] that the devil ain't gonna try you
[1:33:39] it comes sitting with a trial here he
[1:33:42] hired to play for Saul but Saul got
[1:33:44] other plans and it's all done kill this
[1:33:46] man and while they got that javelin in
[1:33:48] his hand David just playing away just
[1:33:50] and probably knowing that service like
[1:33:52] that he just playing like I don't know
[1:33:53] what well just a Norton Oliver and
[1:33:55] chaplain saw so take that gentleman
[1:33:57] through it and why he playing he dodged
[1:33:59] and javis now you know modern-day Davis
[1:34:06] modern-day Davis would take the javelin
[1:34:09] out the wall who you throwing this at
[1:34:15] you create some unwanted circumstances
[1:34:20] but David David what he did after he saw
[1:34:23] that you know the jab and everything he
[1:34:25] I mean god blessed him with the job that
[1:34:27] they had but he had to go through but
[1:34:28] understand why he was going through god
[1:34:31] was perfecting his character David was
[1:34:36] called to be King David slept him you
[1:34:40] know in the king's house but but one
[1:34:42] night you know he had to tell his wife I
[1:34:45] better get out of here because your
[1:34:46] daddy comes rather
[1:34:46] he already done through javelins at me
[1:34:48] hit I did this not nineteen I concocted
[1:34:50] a plan to get why the man sleeping I
[1:34:52] want to go get him so they had the trick
[1:34:55] Solomon and make it look like David was
[1:34:57] in the bed sleeping he done jumped out a
[1:34:59] window went running somewhere it cause
[1:35:01] David a sleeping case David was the pre
[1:35:04] anointed king while he was sleeping in
[1:35:06] case should have been on the throne but
[1:35:07] he was in caves twenty something years
[1:35:10] in case sleeping in the fields there
[1:35:13] were that cut it got so bad as the pre
[1:35:15] anointed king one time he kidney or
[1:35:17] asleep among his people
[1:35:18] Ezra he had to go to the that the
[1:35:20] Phyllis time awed me and take residence
[1:35:25] unwanted circumstances but to understand
[1:35:29] one day when Saul died David actually
[1:35:32] became king of Israel and when it became
[1:35:35] king of Israel amen to say he was the
[1:35:38] greatest king outside of the Lord Jesus
[1:35:40] Christ he was the greatest king they
[1:35:41] have a rule in Israel but had David not
[1:35:44] gone through those unwarranted
[1:35:46] circumstances had he not go through
[1:35:48] those trials that he would have never
[1:35:50] learned how to be a great king see he
[1:35:54] understood he watched all in the weights
[1:35:56] all head of them set me say I'm not
[1:35:57] gonna be like that so maybe you can
[1:36:00] watch your boss maybe we can watch that
[1:36:04] co-worker amen and you can look at
[1:36:07] saying I don't want to be that type of
[1:36:09] co-worker and one day when God promote
[1:36:11] me I am NOT going to be that kind of
[1:36:15] boss but you have to go through some
[1:36:18] unwanted circumstances so your character
[1:36:23] can be developed
[1:36:26] stay with me here today
[1:36:28] Jesus was rejected of his own lied upon
[1:36:33] by false witnesses Jesus even prayed to
[1:36:37] God that the bitter cup would pass but
[1:36:39] but God still allowed him to go right
[1:36:41] through this unwarranted circumstance he
[1:36:44] was crucified under capital punishment a
[1:36:47] man he died probably the worst death
[1:36:50] that any man could die when he was
[1:36:52] nailed to a cross his hands and his feet
[1:36:54] but what the Bible tells us is that a
[1:36:59] in Hebrews 5:8 say though he were a son
[1:37:01] yet learned he obedience by the things
[1:37:05] which he suffered so sometimes God is
[1:37:10] actually drawing you to a closer
[1:37:12] relationship in him by the things that
[1:37:14] you suffer hallelujah but but even after
[1:37:18] Jesus withdrew this Amen that the great
[1:37:20] thing that happened he was raised on the
[1:37:22] third day in power were to sit on the
[1:37:25] right hand of the Father he went through
[1:37:27] a lot but yeah he got exalted to a high
[1:37:30] place my god brother Branham say he was
[1:37:34] so hot I'd have to look down on earth he
[1:37:38] was exhausted so high he got to look
[1:37:39] down on earth but when he came to earth
[1:37:41] he was so low that he had to borrow they
[1:37:44] met a woman to be bearing it I mean I
[1:37:46] want to be birth then had to bear a bar
[1:37:49] a tomb to be bearing in but he was
[1:37:52] exhausted so high a man that he had to
[1:37:55] look down on the earth
[1:37:56] glory to God glory to God he learned
[1:37:58] obedience through the things he suffered
[1:38:01] can I go with one more here Joseph has
[1:38:05] some unwanted circumstances is that
[1:38:08] right Joseph has some unwanted
[1:38:10] circumstances that occurred in his life
[1:38:12] he was hated by his brother him because
[1:38:14] he was spiritual he was placed in a
[1:38:16] pinch a man then sold by his brother he
[1:38:20] became a servant or slave in Potiphar's
[1:38:23] court a man but Potiphar happened to be
[1:38:26] captain of Pharaoh's guards and we're
[1:38:28] gonna read something about this a little
[1:38:29] bit he was lied on while he was asleep
[1:38:32] he was thrown into prison but then he
[1:38:35] was raised into power
[1:38:36] can we read just a little bit about
[1:38:38] Joseph Amen and Genesis 39 stay with me
[1:38:42] here today sometimes we have some
[1:38:45] unwanted circumstances but God is still
[1:38:48] in control a man he's God a man in the
[1:38:52] good times and the bad times he's always
[1:38:54] gone let's look at something here in
[1:38:57] Genesis 39 just a couple scriptures a
[1:38:59] man will read verse 1 and 2 and then
[1:39:02] we'll skip to verse 20 through 23
[1:39:04] james's 39 look at this says and Joseph
[1:39:06] was brought down to Egypt and Potiphar
[1:39:09] and officer of Pharaoh captain
[1:39:12] the guard and Egyptian bought him of the
[1:39:16] hands of the Ishmaelites which had
[1:39:18] brought him down wither and verse two
[1:39:21] says the Lord was with Joseph and he was
[1:39:25] a prosperous man and he was in the house
[1:39:27] of his master the Egyptian now let's
[1:39:30] also skip over here to verse 20 in the
[1:39:34] same chapter now in between verse 2 and
[1:39:37] verse 20 what happened is he's in part
[1:39:39] of his house Potiphar's wife lies on him
[1:39:42] and says that he came in and tried to do
[1:39:44] something that he never did and he ended
[1:39:46] up having to go to prison and then
[1:39:48] because of this live that this woman
[1:39:50] told on him now he found him eight men
[1:39:52] first as a slave he sold into slavery
[1:39:55] he's in part of his house and the Bible
[1:39:57] say the Lord was with him now we see him
[1:40:01] he's headed to prison and the Bible's
[1:40:03] going to tell us that the Lord is with
[1:40:06] him I don't know what you go through but
[1:40:08] I'm telling you right now the Lord is
[1:40:11] with you my client working brother Jack
[1:40:17] the Lord is with you
[1:40:19] they give me trouble on a job the Lord
[1:40:22] is still with you look at it verse 20
[1:40:28] look at this and Joseph's master took
[1:40:29] him in and put him in prison a place
[1:40:32] where the Kings prisoners were bound and
[1:40:34] he was there in the prison but the Lord
[1:40:36] was with Joseph it doesn't seem right
[1:40:40] that God is with me and I'm going
[1:40:41] through all this stuff that I'm going
[1:40:42] through it don't it just don't make any
[1:40:44] sense but the Bible says but the Lord
[1:40:48] was with Joseph and showed him mercy and
[1:40:51] gave him favor in the sight of the
[1:40:53] keeper of the prison and the cube of the
[1:40:57] prison committed to Joseph and all the
[1:40:59] prisoners that were in the prison and
[1:41:01] whatsoever they did there he was the the
[1:41:04] doer of it
[1:41:06] the keep of the prison look not to
[1:41:08] anything that was under his head because
[1:41:11] the Lord was with him and that which is
[1:41:13] that which he did the Lord made it to
[1:41:15] prosper oh I gotta tell you something
[1:41:20] you are a Sea
[1:41:23] you a seat a man your predestinated seat
[1:41:27] right and I need you to understand that
[1:41:29] when when people take you through all
[1:41:32] kind of nonsense and they try to bury
[1:41:35] you when they try to bury you remember
[1:41:40] your seat and if you bury a seed what
[1:41:43] its gonna do it's gonna grow so no
[1:41:47] matter what you go through you supposed
[1:41:49] to grow and get stronger you suppose a
[1:41:52] kid better not bitter but bad seeds go
[1:42:00] when their planet they grow and that's
[1:42:04] what you're going through a process of
[1:42:06] growth how could this be that the Lord
[1:42:09] was with them the man is soul a man as a
[1:42:12] slave in the Potiphar's house the man is
[1:42:15] in prison and it says the Lord is with
[1:42:17] them I want you all to think about this
[1:42:19] how can the Bible say that the Lord is
[1:42:22] with with Joseph in slavery and also in
[1:42:24] prison and I'm a jest i'ma just i'ma
[1:42:27] beat it to the beat you to the punch the
[1:42:29] reason God can say this cuz da can
[1:42:31] already see that in Oh God God can
[1:42:37] already see that in and in and here's
[1:42:39] here's another good thing is that if God
[1:42:41] can see the end then all things are
[1:42:44] working together for good and your
[1:42:47] purpose for being in part of a house is
[1:42:50] because it's intentional your purpose
[1:42:53] for being at whatever job you wear is
[1:42:55] because it's intentional your purpose
[1:42:58] are going to prison is because it's
[1:43:00] intentional not know exactly what he's
[1:43:04] doing
[1:43:05] come on somebody it's an unwonted
[1:43:10] circumstance but God is behind
[1:43:13] it's my blessing in disguise why why
[1:43:22] would the Bible say that he got sold to
[1:43:26] Potiphar officer in pharaoh's court why
[1:43:32] now you know all the people down there
[1:43:34] buying slaves think about all the people
[1:43:38] that's buying slaves but God had it
[1:43:40] where he allowed social to be sold to
[1:43:43] Potiphar now officer in Pharaoh's court
[1:43:48] and I hate it no no no no no I'm a block
[1:43:51] you from barn Joseph and I'm a block you
[1:43:54] from Brian Joseph and I'm a block you
[1:43:56] know I know you might be raising the

[1:54:57] that there is there's a blessing in
[1:54:59] disguise meant when you're going through
[1:55:01] God is moving in the atmosphere mean in

[1:55:15] everybody go get a car I say that line I

[1:55:25] testified about a new car you know why
[1:55:27] she a new car cuz the devil get hook up
[1:55:30] you know it's just a bag in the car

[1:55:39] running so we tryna we gonna kill
[1:55:46] covetousness too
[1:55:48] [Applause]
[1:55:52] so don't look at what God
[1:55:56] yeah that's what I'm reading a blessed
[1:55:59] night all right but when you're going
[1:56:01] through a trial and some of y'all going
[1:56:04] through some serious trials look for
[1:56:05] your blessing a man don't give the devil
[1:56:08] no credit at all he's a liar and
[1:56:11] everything he speak is a lie all right
[1:56:14] where am I
[1:56:15] I wanted to tell you all about Joseph
[1:56:18] Joseph had unwanted circumstances that
[1:56:22] put him in and-and-and-and in slavery
[1:56:25] and then put them in the Pharaohs prison
[1:56:29] and those all that was designed by God
[1:56:36] the reason that Baba could say the Lord
[1:56:38] was with Joseph it's because God knew he
[1:56:41] had to put Joseph in a certain place and
[1:56:43] order for him to build relationships
[1:56:46] with certain people had he been in any
[1:56:50] other prison he would have never met the
[1:56:52] butler he would have never met the Baker
[1:56:54] he would have never met these people and
[1:56:56] and the reason I say he built
[1:56:58] relationships because when you go back
[1:57:00] and read the scripture you'll see that
[1:57:02] Joseph's Kingdom saying ah man why y'all
[1:57:04] so sad today
[1:57:05] how can he recognize their attitudes huh
[1:57:10] because he knew man we always joke and
[1:57:13] we always giggle you're always doing
[1:57:14] this ribbet but why y'all so sad today
[1:57:16] both of y'all sand right I mean he has a
[1:57:20] relationship with these men that said
[1:57:23] naw I got y'all some be this way I mean
[1:57:25] and notice this even though Joseph is in
[1:57:27] prison he's still choking even though
[1:57:32] Joseph has gone through he still got a
[1:57:33] good attitude
[1:57:37] he don't like his condition so when he
[1:57:41] tells the man their dreams they give
[1:57:42] them an interpretation of the dreams one
[1:57:43] is real good one it's really bad but it
[1:57:46] still give the interpretation even
[1:57:47] saying that when you when it when it
[1:57:49] when it when it when he bring you back
[1:57:50] into your position don't forget about me
[1:57:53] that mean he don't like his unwanted
[1:57:55] circumstance none of us like I don't
[1:57:57] want a circumstance I say don't forget
[1:57:59] if I'm just just touch
[1:58:00] make sure you let him know that I'm down
[1:58:02] here I'm down here unjustly but I'm tell
[1:58:05] you if you wait on God now see
[1:58:08] had he been released at that time oh
[1:58:11] come on
[1:58:13] he had that God had to make it look like
[1:58:17] he was forgotten
[1:58:19] I hope y'all whip me this morning God
[1:58:23] had to make Joseph think that he was
[1:58:25] forgotten because God had a better
[1:58:27] position I don't want you to just be
[1:58:30] free from prison I got something up my
[1:58:35] sleeve here and if you just let me work
[1:58:38] this thing out you might become boss you
[1:58:49] might get promotion to boss second in
[1:58:53] charge if you let me work this thing
[1:58:55] guys Joseph Joseph sit there and he say
[1:59:02] he said man they they forgot about me
[1:59:04] they forgot about me two years later two
[1:59:07] whole years later here he is and and he
[1:59:11] don't he don't even forgot about
[1:59:12] everything too but here come on order
[1:59:15] rushing into the prison rushing in
[1:59:19] hey you need to clean yourself up you
[1:59:21] got to go before February for what what
[1:59:24] what's going on what's out doings are
[1:59:26] you going before Pharaoh right now say
[1:59:28] okay all right God then showed him no
[1:59:29] dream God didn't give no vision and he
[1:59:34] just maybe just took its first shape in
[1:59:36] years and he come running up to Pharaohs
[1:59:39] and I just yeah yeah I know I preached
[1:59:41] this recently but it's just in my spirit
[1:59:44] all over but he he he come running up to
[1:59:49] Pharaoh and like well what is it what is
[1:59:50] it well you know I had this dream and I
[1:59:53] was asking all these people around me
[1:59:55] and nobody I was able to interpret the
[1:59:57] dream and in the butler the butler your
[2:00:00] friend the butler yeah I thought he
[2:00:03] forgot about me yeah but your friend
[2:00:05] said that he remembered you was in
[2:00:07] prison and and we sent the gift to say
[2:00:10] because they say you know you
[2:00:11] interpreted his dream and the bay
[2:00:12] dream and it was it was spot-on so if
[2:00:15] you could do that for them can't you do
[2:00:17] the same for me but in the midst of
[2:00:18] these thing now I'm gonna give glory to
[2:00:20] God it's not me interpreting dreams but
[2:00:21] it's God in me that does these things
[2:00:23] y'all need to stop right there you think
[2:00:26] you don't got somewhere because of you
[2:00:28] it ain't you is God in you sometimes you
[2:00:35] got to stop and give God the praise I
[2:00:38] didn't either and watch I didn't watch
[2:00:40] the whatever this football game was the
[2:00:45] national championship but I was told
[2:00:47] that the second-string quarterback from
[2:00:51] Alabama I mean got into the game and
[2:00:54] brought the team back and they won the
[2:00:56] game and at the end of the game I heard
[2:00:57] the boy was on national television and
[2:01:00] he said my mama told me not to do this
[2:01:01] and my daddy told me not to do this but
[2:01:06] I want to give God some glory praise the
[2:01:14] Lord for young man gonna do something
[2:01:15] like own national television
[2:01:18] you can't cut that it's running live but
[2:01:28] sometimes we need to stop and just
[2:01:29] acknowledge God God is the one did this
[2:01:33] here here here Joe Joe cigar got you
[2:01:36] know if it's you got to give it to me if
[2:01:37] it's a God say okay you start sharing
[2:01:40] that dream and they shared the share
[2:01:42] something else is okay both of these
[2:01:44] dreams are the same thing and Joseph
[2:01:46] forgetting interpreting and at the end
[2:01:49] of his interpreting you say now what you
[2:01:50] need to do is get yourself a wise man
[2:01:52] that will help prepare Egypt in this
[2:01:54] time of Plenty because the time of
[2:01:58] famine is coming but you need a wise man
[2:01:59] to kind of oversee some things and make
[2:02:01] sure that they can prepare for the
[2:02:03] famine so he's turned around on his way
[2:02:05] back to prison
[2:02:15] [Applause]
[2:02:19] and I could just see Pharaoh say uh
[2:02:22] fellas fellas fellas y'all couldn't get
[2:02:26] the interpretation but this man just
[2:02:30] came in and in just a few minutes time
[2:02:32] told us exactly what was gonna happen
[2:02:35] is there a wiser man in the kingdom
[2:02:39] then he if there is for y'all shown to
[2:02:45] me because I'm not gonna let this man go
[2:02:49] back to prison when I know he can be a
[2:02:53] help to me it's just a nobody while to
[2:03:01] stop where you add Joseph stop stop stop
[2:03:03] you the man and see had he had had had
[2:03:07] he come out two years earlier he would
[2:03:10] have been ahead of the dreams he would
[2:03:17] have been ahead of some stuff had he
[2:03:19] come out two years earlier so God had to
[2:03:22] make it look like he was forgotten it
[2:03:24] was an unwarranted shock out - but it
[2:03:28] was a blessing in disguise me no no no
[2:03:34] no no no no this is the man Pharisee and
[2:03:38] in my kingdom and this is what I like he
[2:03:40] he wouldn't just no I mean he went he
[2:03:42] went from being prison I mean slave
[2:03:48] prisoner vice-president
[2:03:59] slave
[2:04:01] well actually we can go back even
[2:04:03] further than that hate it put in a pit
[2:04:12] sold into slavery by brothers and so you
[2:04:17] got a yo-yo I'm stuck in this story I
[2:04:19] got so much more to say but I I'm stuck
[2:04:22] in here but but but but but but when you
[2:04:25] got to when you read the script you got
[2:04:27] to be able to read between the lines
[2:04:28] because when he finally gets back to his
[2:04:30] brothers when they found when he
[2:04:32] realized that they don't change Judah
[2:04:34] Judah none change you do the same one
[2:04:37] that came with the plan to sell him now
[2:04:38] I said no no no I
[2:04:39] we can't leave Benjamin here because if
[2:04:42] Benjamin don't go back my daddy gonna
[2:04:45] die and and and I can't I'm sorry I I
[2:04:48] have to be the one to take his place
[2:04:51] when Joseph see that and Sababa distill
[2:04:54] out shop and and before they before they
[2:04:56] tell him that they say they said you
[2:04:58] know our system caught up with us and
[2:05:00] you know and when we saw our brothers
[2:05:01] face see I mean and see when they they
[2:05:04] don't take that in the previous chapters
[2:05:06] but but when they saw them they can just
[2:05:08] see his face and the anguish like I
[2:05:10] can't believe y'all would do me this way
[2:05:12] my own blood I could y'all do this to me
[2:05:15] oh my god but then when I saw his face
[2:05:19] you know that that looks stayed with
