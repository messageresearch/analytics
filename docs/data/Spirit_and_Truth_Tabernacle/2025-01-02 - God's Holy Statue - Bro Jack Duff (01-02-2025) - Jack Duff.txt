Amen in worship amen the uh musicians and just finding their finding their way through they such a blessing to us the specials that went forth Amen on today God bless you all uh we just we just appreciate the Lord Jesus amen and I I just needed to take just a little time uh to mention a couple things did we put the announcement on our corporate fast is that okay um just want to make mention that is um something that's coming at the end of this month the last Sunday this month we'll be starting uh our our 21-day corporate fast we do it as a church together and uh and everybody does something different whatever the Lord leads them to do uh we don't put any pressure on that but we just ask everybody to join in some way some uh fast till 3:00 in the day some 6:00 in the day some do the Daniel Fast um which means they still eat uh but they just eat differently uh so fast technology social media now back in in the Bible days that wouldn't have really been considered a fast but today it truly is a fast when you can fast uh social media right so there's all all types of ways that we enter into this amen and we just want to encourage everyone that that'll be coming uh on the last Sunday of this month amen we'll be we'll be uh going 21 days I I changed it we used to do it 21 days before Easter but uh I changed that because I didn't want us to be considered [Music] Catholic I know the Catholics do that with the um lent and that's not what we're trying to do uh you know I just I think fasting is actually a part of the Christian experience amen the Bible speaks of it brother Brandon did it and uh and I believe it's something that we should all incorporate uh in our own personal lives amen so uh we'll be doing that as a church uh corporately and we get that from when Esther told the um the children of Israel uh y'all go in a three-day fast for me because I got to go before the king and and I have not been invited into his presence so uh she say if I perish I I'll perish but I'm going to go see the king but y'all fast before I go right and then you know uh so that's where the corporate part comes in the entire nation began to fast on behalf of Esther uh believing that God would open up a door and he did uh for Esther if he can open up the door for Esther anybody need any doors open Amen in this season I'm one that believes he can open doors for us amen let's be sincere about how we approach the Lord amen uh I uh also yes yesterday I was um I was in asked to preach a eulogy at a at a a homegoo service my mother-in-law's Uncle uh passed and you know I'm I I I I didn't I was trying to figure out how did they get to me so many preachers in the family and and I could not figure out how I was the one to get the invitation uh to minister and uh and you know when you're going to uh environments like that I I can't bring the sermons that I bring here it would be way too heavy you can't choke people right uh so I have to always in my mind try to get back down praise the lord I can't go in with get back and step hello y'all y'all can eat that but they can't it's a little too rich so I have to always in my mind try to figure out okay how can I get this down to a level where we can still minister to the hearts of the people and I was searching amen that the scripture says in the Book of Ecclesiastes the preacher searches for acceptable words and uh and I was searching for some acceptable words and uh and I was just waiting on the Lord and I asked the brothers on Tuesday night to pray for me cuz I was just waiting on the Lord and and um you know so um uh Thursday night we happened to go to the the fair and uh you know we were there first the young people went at last Sunday with the young people and I really enjoyed myself they hurt my feet with them young people walking with them all over the place but but nonetheless we made it through and uh and I went back on Thursday night and you know as we were just kind of there uh you know at the fair uh Brother Joseph uh walked up to to me and he says um brother Jack I got a question for you and uh I said yeah what's that he says um it says I was reading my Bible doing my own Bible study and I was reading and I ran across this scripture in Matthew 18 and uh my dad asked me you know what did I what did I think this meant and I really I just couldn't get anything out of it but uh I figured I would ask you and I say well he say it's talking about the lost sheep I say uh Lord let's read it together I pulled it out on my phone real quick and I and it talked about how the shepherd would leave the 99 and go and find the one lost sheep and I said oh Joe this is the value of one soul to God that he would leave 99 and go after that one and he didn't even know he had struck the cords and right there I got a sermon from brother Joe thank you brother Joe thank you my brother brother that that that that that that that that helped us we walk right through that and talked about how it was a shepherd's responsibility to find his lost sheep and and you know just a lot of little things we brought and I said now if he's a hirling he will just leave the Sheep if the Wolf come he'll leave the sheep and he'll run for his life but a Shepherd a true Shepherd will lay his life down for the sheep and I say I'm so glad that I'm Not underneath a hirling I said I'm underneath the covering of a Good Shepherd I said how you know you underneath the covering of a Good Shepherd brother Jack because David said the Lord [Applause] thank you brother Joe we we had a little church we had a little church yeah we thank God for all things I appreciate y'all so much appreciate you devil been fighting me so y'all just bear with me um I do want to read our scripture I do everybody we we thank God for everybody being here today brother Paul sister Rebecca so good to see y'all uh your your annual trip to Florida and he he asked for a little break today so we letting them be on

come on now I ain't surprised to see him he's supposed to be here every week amen all right let's let's read the scripture amen and uh we'll we'll get right into the thought for today um a couple passages that have been um a common theme for us we'll go to them quickly uh Joel 1 Joel 2 and then uh I want to pick up in Mark 2 as well um Joel 1:4 simply says that which the Palmer worm uh hath left hath the Locust eaten and that which the Locust ha left hath the cankerworm eaten that which the Kink worth left hath the caterpillar eaten verse uh chapter 2 verse 23 yes uh but be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the uh he have given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain the latter rain in the first month the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust ha eaten the canker worm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you uh also I want to just slip over here to Mark chapter 2 amen um let see I think I want verse 18 yeah um says and The Disciples of John and uh of the Pharisees used to fast and they come and say unto him why do the Disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast but thy disciples fast not and Jesus said to them can the children of the Bride chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then shall they fast in these days verse 21 says no man also sth a piece of new cloth on an old garment the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old and the rent is made worse the tear is made worse the rent is made worse and no man putteth new wine into Old bottles else the new wine does burst the bottles and the wine is SPO is is spilled uh and the bottles will be marred but new wine must be put into new bottles amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let us pray father we are grateful for uh the privilege to read the scripture but it takes the Holy Ghost to make the scripture live uh in the day in which we are living so God we pray that you take control of every thought as presented take control of every thought that is received May the spirit of God be pleased father with the word that goes forth and God not only bless the saints that are present but those that are uh watching online uh look upon there's some saints know brother Simba not feeling well in his body the kids not feeling well pray that you would touch them Father and bring complete and total healing uh to them and just uh uh uh believe that you'll touch all the other things that might not be feeling well in this hour God it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated um as you all are aware we are in a a journey through um get back in step we are changing the title amen this morning uh but we're still in the same uh Channel if I can put it that way the title this morning is God's holy statue man God's holy uh statue and um I want to uh focus a little bit amen our attention on the Holy Ghost because in Joel it was speaking about the Holy Ghost amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we want to make a few comments on that um this morning and just trust the Lord will just just direct us let me start with a quote out of uh what was the Holy Ghost given for uh brother brandom makes a statement here it says one more scripture it says if you want to write it down John 12:24 he says let me quote it to you right quick Jesus said if a corn of wheat falls into the ground except it die it cannot bring forth another life amen except it die it cannot bring forth another life he says now look one closing remark now it says remember that it is absolutely uh now to you people he says it's absolutely essential and necessary and compelling and compulsory that you receive the Holy Ghost now for if you don't you can't come in the resurrection now uh I I wanted to just just take a little time and look at that he uses so many adjectives in order to try to get to our attention uh how important it is for us to receive the holy ghost look let me just try to make this plain it's not good enough for you just to come to church that's right it's not good enough for you to say that you believe the message hello somebody amen those things are good but it's not good enough what what you must go on to receive is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's something that changes you from the inside Hallelujah when when you don't have strength on the inside to say no to sin the Holy Ghost comes to give you strength to be able to say no to sin the Holy Ghost you to live a different type of life than you were living before Hallelujah somebody so so brother Bram uses these amen adjectives he says essential amen he says compelling he says compulsory what is this word essential it means absolutely necessary extremely important you know eating food is extremely important right it's abs absolutely necessary if you want to if you want to live but receiving the Holy Ghost spiritually is more important than you eating your food he says this compelling that means evoking interest attention or admiration in a powerfully irresistible way amen it's compelling that we receive the Holy Ghost he also said compulsory which means it's required by law I like that statement it it's required by law and and I just I just love the way uh I love the way the prophet just uses this type of language the composure mean required by law a rule is obligatory you obligated to receive it now now here the other thing that we uh that we find that the prophet tells that if you repent amen according to Acts chapter 2 if you repent and you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah brother Brandon say God is obligated to fill you with the Holy Ghost if you come according to his word hallelujah you can hold God to his promise this morning if you know that you've already repented and you know that you were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now you can expect God to fill you with his Spirit it it's it's necessary absolutely NE necessary that we talk about the Holy Ghost it's it's important for this this generation amen we must receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost here in the message hidden life with Christ and I want to just mention sis I got my quotes all over I changed I changed my order back there so if you you might have to turn to the back to find some of this but uh but it'll be there uh hidden life with Christ brother Brandon makes a statement here amen uh in this sermon it says that's what the church needs today is a hidden consecrated life says you can't be diddle dabbling along with the world Hallelujah you can't be diddle dabbling you know I I was I was one of the uh after the sermon yesterday you know one of the one of the uh sons of the deceased came to me and says you know I really appreciate that sermon I want to get these scriptures that you was you know you was uh referring to and I you know I gave him all the scriptures and he says um he says you know I want to uh he says I want to live right I want to get closer to God I said okay all right that's good now you hear people say that you know all the time but you need to kind of find out what they really mean just let them but the way you find out just let them keep talking yes sir so so he kept talking he say he say he say yeah I want to live right I I was in I was I was incarcerated for about a year and a half and I don't want to go back I want to live for God I don't want to go back to where I came from it says it says I want to stop drinking I want to stop smoking I want to stop I want to live right right I said is that right that's good he says I want to wait on God to send me a wife too huh you want to do that well we got we got some vitamins here that will help you do that right amen if you want to live right we can help you live right praise God but but see this this this this this uh this life that we're talking about you you can't diddle dabble with the world it says impersonating and acting like them and and and and and hit with Christ cuz you're trying to Fashion After the world you're trying to live like the next Church you're trying to belong to a better organization wear better clothes do do so and so that's not uh that's not uh complied with Christianity he says uh uh that's not comply with Christianity says Christianity is a sacrificed life that's right a hidden life with God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost amen he says that's what the real

follow him and a thirst my god oh I I missed something there it says um it says oh how you love to give up things of the world when the Holy Spirit comes in how it cleanses you and washes you and puts a desire in you you realize the reason you still got that desire to do sinful things is because something has not come in to cling you oh my yesterday before we went to the uh the homegoing you know I

brother brandom tell how it cleanses you and washes you and puts a desire in you to follow him in a thirst and a Hunger for More of it just bathing yourself he brings realities was just looking at a a sermon here and I'm going to read a quote from it shortly from uh the impersonation of Christianity and uh Hallelujah I think it's the one where it says so I set in amazement that's the one you want to pull up sis but before you do that I just want to set this quote up you know uh brother brandom was uh uh in this sermon impersonation Christianity he was talking about how he uh he was in the in the wilderness and he was tracking a grizzly bear he was trying to he saw a grizzly bear he said he didn't want to shoot it he simply wanted to just just just observe it and just sit there and and enjoy one of the God's natural creatures and uh he said he would just tracking and just just just running you know uh trying to get this bear but while he was tracking the bear uh he was riding a horse he said his horse was about 3 years old so he had not really been broken in and uh he say every time he turned around that horse was trying to do something in order to kick brother brother brandom off the horse cuz he just didn't want him riding and uh he said they would they go around one corner that that horse will raise up and try to kick him off and he's stuck in the wilderness here and this horse just bucking every every everywhere he can and he says uh uh he says while fighting with the horse he actually lost sense of direction he didn't know where he was in the wildness he didn't know what know what North what south east or west was he was completely lost because he was fighting with this horse it says but by God's grace he he caught his direction again and he realized he had to turn and go in a different way and I hope somebody will come to that Rec uh that that reality amen and recognize that you need to turn and go in a different way today man the direction that you're heading is not the right direction but you need to turn and go in a different way and I believe God gives you opportunity to turn and go in a different direction today Hallelujah the spirit of God is here to help you do that he says uh he he says he he realized he had to turn and go in a different way and and while he's you know uh getting ready to moveing in that direction said a storm was there in the area and and a storm had passed and now the sun was setting and the moon was shining and he says it looked like buttermilk Skies like big lumps of clouds just just going over and he says he just looking there and he just he just just worshiping just looking at nature and it says he felt led to stop riding the horse and just tie him up so he can get off the horse and just go to praising God hallelujah amen sometimes I'm going tell you when when the Holy Ghost get good to you amen you can be riding down the street in your [Applause] car and something just come over you and you have to put the car in park and and and we done done it before get out the con and let out a big thank you Jesus and then my feet get a little happy and you know what I be looking crazy but I don't care how I look I had to get out my thank you Jesus now no no no no now now now I mean I'm not embarrassed to look like that if God God God do that but what about these guys that's out there flipping signs trying to get people to come in and do business be dancing all kind of crazy look I mean and they don't mind being a Fool For The Devil I I'd rather be a fool for Christ amen he said he said he felt led to stop riding that horse and tied them up and begin to look up towards the sky and start worshiping God and said the place that he was in it seemed to be spooky because he heard some strange and strange noises some mournful noises in this area he said it look real spooky but yet in this place he's worshiping God he says he looked around and noticed that he was in what we call a burnover and brother Adam says it's where the the fires went through years before and burn amen burned all the bark off the trees and and they didn't stand it says but when that sun or moon rather come out from behind the clouds and all those bleach white uh poles standing up trees it looked like tombstones while he D he made a statement he said Lord I I always knew that you lived in the forest and he said why was I attracted to stop at this place amen for this place looks terrible why am I attracted to stop here amen and just worship you what's going on here so we want to pick up amen this quote because God begins to show him why he was there in that place it says so as I sat in amazement looking I thought well what caused this well why are these trees like this what caused this this this this this uh this burnover it says he says what what caused this what what what what uh what stripped the life it says uh what the Lutheran left the methodists eaten where the Methodist left the Baptist eaten where the Baptist left the nazarin eaten where the nazarin left the Pentecostal eaten and brother we haven't got nothing but just a church name I thought isn't that something no wonder there's so much impersonation of Christianity and and you got to understand many of these churches that's all they're doing is imperson impersonating Christians brother random said you got demons impersonating Christians demons and and often times we looking at this demon and we thinking they got something if they ain't got The Life of Christ ain't got nothing amen it said he says uh uh uh no wonder there's so much impersonation of Christianity nothing but a mock it says I won't go over uh to that building no I wouldn't Co cooperate with with such a thing a lack of life that's all not a lack of church it's a lack of life it say so I said in my heart to God I said why do you still send me send the wind then why do you still send the wind through amen and this burnover it says then my my mind went on down uh in the scriptures too dark to read my little Testament in my pocket but I said why would you send me uh send the wind and and my mind went on down the scripture said I will restore sayth the Lord all that the caterpillar has eaten all that the Locust has eaten I will restore it says and then to my amazement he says looking out in the bottom of the corners of the trees and their different seeds down on the ground not quite so high not so big but there was some undergrowth I like that there was some undergrowth coming up new trees coming up and when the wind blew they just frolicked and shook Glory Glory Glory Glory and jumped and quivered and when I said if that isn't an oldfashioned Revival I never seen one Glory Glory Hallelujah says th the children of God just rejoicing and frolicking in the blessings of God as it pours down well something come to me said they're green they're young and green I'd rather be young and green and be flexible yes sir and have some life than to be old and stiff and when you get old and stff you also go to another stage dead you better stay young and green and flexible able to move when the spirit want you to move Hallelujah glory to God be ready to give God an amen sometime ready to lift your hands in the presence of the Lord welcoming his spirit [Applause] he says have some life than be old stiff and dead and have nothing so even a little wild fire instead of no fire at all brother that's what I'm looking for amen just a little wildf fire is better than no fire at all Lord send the fire Lord's in the fire praise God praise God all right you know brother brandom is is is is there in this situation he sees the undergrowth and I believe we're living in a generation where we're seeing the undergrowth but you see the undergrowth has to have an experience with God just like the generation before them right hallelujah amen often times the kids are going off of Mama and Daddy's experiences but that ain't going to that ain't going to last but when they have their own experience let me tell you something that comes with their own experience their own convictions oh that is very important to have sister young young sister you're not just wearing your skirt because Mama making you wear one you're not wearing your dress because Mama making you wear one you're wearing it because you got your own personal convictions that this is the way of young lady supposed to dress Hallelujah young man you ain't running out to the basketball court with a short song because you have your own conviction that this is the way brothers are supposed to dress Holiness is still right oh my we need we need a generation of young people that have their own convictions and you only get that when you get your personal experience with the Holy Ghost all right all right all right all right all right brother Brandon makes a statement here in this message the restoration of the R Tree let me just uh line that up praise God he's and and I I'm sorry I put on the side there uh pulling splinters uh that's what you want to search out their p uh pulling splinters okay now woo listen to this people as brother said this morning pulling splinters it says well you know there is 19 different Nails in the nation today that different organizations are holding and could claim its original nail was in his hands now he only had two in his hands but there's 19 Nails floating around and people said these are the original nails that was in his hands let me tell y'all just be very plain we not looking for the nails that was in his hands but we're looking for that life that was in that body hallu the spirit that was there that's what we want not the nails and the hands now I'm going to go a little further with this it it'll help us a little bit amen my God it says uh there there's 19 different Nails in the nation today that that different organizations are holding and con claim its original nail was in his hands what what of it if it was I would want nothing to do with it certainly God never left anything for relics and tokens hallelujah amen this is important and I you just bear with me God never here's a prophet speaking God never left relics left anything for relics and tokens he sent the Holy Ghost I'm I'mma go a little further we we just not looking for a belt buckle sir a suitcase hello church amen some of the other things that they have God never left these relics like that don't mean you got nothing because you got a belt buckle and it's not even an original belt buckle it's a replica of a belt buckle and you think you're a message believer because you got a belt buckle what makes you a message Believers when you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you can follow the word for your day Hallelujah my God Amen I'm going say this hanging the prophet's picture in your church does not make you a message church that's right right brother right it's the word that you preach that makes you a message Church come on and if you can't tell a message Church by what they preaching versus what relics they have then you missing everything you don't know the message all right I hope that don't hurt nobody feelings we done got away from the word we want relics Hey listen let me tell you something y'all better know the Bible that's right you know in the in the days of Moses that they uh uh uh in order to have healing they would all this uh unbelief in the wilderness God told him say look take this this serpent that's on the pole everybody that looks to that pole in faith will be healed but they made that pole a God and later on in scripture they had to break the pole and take it from the people now where was the healing then if you ain't got no pole to look to [Applause] oh I'mma get it out it might take me a little long to get there but I'mma get it out with your PO when your poll is gone when your poll is gone what do you have then is your healing gone because shall pole go for me my healing is still here because my healing was not inside of a pole my healing was in Christ and I got my eyes on Christ in this message I got my eyes on [Applause] Christ even with the pillar of fire above the prophet's head my eyes is not on the prophet my eyes is on Christ all right hallu brother not relics we talking by the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll make you live right it'll make you walk right it'll make you think right it'll make you talk [Applause] right brother there a real Holy Ghost a real Holy Ghost changes you from the inside glory to [Applause] God let's read what the prophet said God never left anything for relics and tokens he sent the Holy Ghost and see I'm we have to say it like this we got a lot of defeated Christians in the message sir because they looking at the wrong thing I'm I'm I know what I'm talking about you get people looking at the wrong thing they can't get strength from that that's the truth because I give you a belt buckle that don't mean that brother brother you ain't got nothing tell them that you ain't got nothing you got a replica a replica and I mean that's all it is and and what you going to do with that look you better take what's on these books it what's on these tapes and you ready to put that inside of your [Applause] [Music] heart no we we we talk about lives being changed and just coming to the message ain't going to change you you you need the life that was in the message and that's the life of Christ which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right Hallelujah God never left anything for relics and tokens he sent the Holy Ghost something alive cannot be destroyed look at that what would a what would a nail do me any good it says what with the original cross he hung gone what would it do me any good not a bit so now now y'all look at me and you and you say now how can brother Jack say that and you get offended at me but the prophet just said it that's what he said amen he might not have been coughing like I was coughing but he said it not a bit not to know the nail know the cross but to know him is life see it says now so we're we're holding on nails we're holding on relics and we're holding on places and today people walk up and down in the city of Jerusalem and all up and down in different places and holding to relics in things now he said in Jerusalem what if I what if I put another city that started with [Music] J sir amen I'm going have to have you read between the lines and and and and and and what what I've come to realize that things that I preach for spirit and Truth Tabernacle people feel like they have a need to share our videos with other folk and and and and what happens they they they find people that's kind of leaning in a certain direction and what I'm trying now I'm not leaning here and I'm not leaning here I'mma tell you where I'm at this is where I'm at hallah so sometime they take the videos and try to give it to the person that might be leaning this way I ain't leaning over there but I am right here in the middle trying to keep my church in alignment with the word praise [Applause] God so I hope you can read between the lines because there's a spirit that's in the land and if you can't identify the spirit you you you're going to be you're going to be confused and mixed up amen it it's the same Spirit brother brandom is dealing with something here no no not relics that's not that's not what make us Believers relics don't do that brother when I got a hold of this message or should I say when this message got a hold of me sir it was no relics that got me brother the very first thing I read was the life of the the the the the life of of brother Brandon his uh his life story and I read that life story say uh something brother ain't no ain't no Dove or nothing come in my room when I was born and what happened and this all these Supernatural things happen in this man life I said wait a minute so God is God is God is moving here and then I start listening to what he said oh my God my God and it took me something I'm coming from a Baptist background I'm used to the preacher the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want he makeing me like down brother that's how we could grew up in church preacher had to sing that message and did you go listen to brother brandom and ain't no singing you had to be attracted to the word not the emotions but the word and if there was a word seed inside of you you can help us say Amen to it that's Hallelujah and I'm telling you once I got attracted I've been stuck like glue amen like my mama say I knew this was it let me keep reading here let me keep reading it says uh uh uh uh uh walk in the city of Jerusalem and all up and down in the different places and holding to relics and things that ain't got nothing to do with it not a thing the thing is condemned rotten and gone on we want something that's living watch what he says now I went to a church in Rome now y'all listen to these statements cuz I went to the same church in Rome I went to a church in Rome they were uh they all these priests that die they plant them in a garden down beneath there and let the meat fall off the the bones and then they take the bones and make light fixtures now y'all sitting here saying what because they doing that in the Catholic church I told you no relics cuz that same spirit will come right into the message if we don't watch it now not not bones but other things praise the Lord all right it says he says um they they uh let the meat fall bones and then they take the bones out and make light fixtures and put their skulls around and people come in there and rub them skulls amen asz people go to Jeffersonville and they do some some things when they get there that are not of God Amen Hallelujah I'm just being honest with you look look you going to need the Holy Ghost that's the most important thing that you need amen amen amen and mean sometimes you go overseas and and and some my saints that might might have never gone to Jeff Jeffersonville before people look at you uh you live right here in the states and never been to Jeffersonville and they think something wrong with you no no we realize there's more to it than just going to Jeffersonville used to be a time that you can go to jonville and not even be able to go to [Music] church was a church available for you for you to go to and actually have a service amen hallelujah things have changed now we thank God for the changes yes sir amen amen but but but we we we can see beyond it's not relics now yes I and like I told you I went to the prophet's grave I went there and when I got there the Holy Spirit told me something that I'll never forget he says don't you don't you put my profit too low and he saying don't you lift them up too high either I'm telling what the Holy Ghost told me don't you put my profit too low and don't you lift them up too high either amen amen you know brother brandom one time I'm coming back to my quote he brother uh Perry green said that brother brandham told me says uh if you ever saying anything wrong about me I'll call you one day brother Perry green was in the pool pit and he was preaching and and he's sharing all these testimonies about brother brandom and then all of a sudden a telephone rung and uh somebody said brother brother brother Perry brother brother brandom on the phone brother brandom on the phone he's like well the brother I'm talking about he's on the phone right now let me go to the phone said brother brother brandom I'm I'm on the I'm in the pull pit right now talking you know he says yeah I told you I call [Music] you okay all right let me keep reading take the bones out make like fixtures and put their skulls around and people come in there rub them skulls and to get blessings until the skulls are white and wore out you going to St Peter's Cathedral that's that's in Rome it says the foot of Peter I was there they done rubbed it so much the man ain't got no more foot it says the foot of Peter they claim their statue has been kissed off nine or 10 different times they have to mold another foot on it such that's what the prophet called it nonsense and we ain't going to be caught up in the midst of nonsense such nonsense superstitions that's all it is Creeds of man-made Doctrine God sent the Holy Spirit life of God to be in you not in a statue you are the guy that God wants to live in not a statue but in you people call Holy statues there ain't no holy statues you are God's holy statue yes sir you are God's holy statue they should see Christ in you the hope of glory yes sir brother the Bible says so that's right a body has thou prepared for me and I I just want I just I I just wish that we can get some people that would want to just prepare their bodies that God could dwell inside your body God can take control of your thinking from the top of your head amen he can dwell all the way through the souls of your feet that God can direct you wherever he wants you to go that you'll go hallelujah oh my my my my my my I was thinking on the scripture uh how um uh when when Isaiah uh had an experience with God and and God had to had to cleanse the prophet Isaiah he he realized man I'm undone I need a cleansing I need I need I need the fire from the altar of God to come and touch my lips and cleanse me Isaiah got his cleansing and here's the here's the beautiful thing about after Isaiah got his cleansing and and and we have many today that that are afraid of this but but when you go back and look in the scripture you see what happened to Isaiah the question was asked after he got his cleansing the question asks who who will go for us now people not registering to go anymore people want to sit in the background but the question was who will go for us God needed a man God need needed a woman God needed somebody that would be willing to go for him who will go for us after Isaiah got his cleansing he can respond with honesty in his heart Lord send me send me Jesus I will go Joel two verse 24 said and the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil now we looked at this to start the year off cuz this is considered the year of overflow amen because we're overflowing the theme from last year into this year so this is a year of over flow but I want us to be very very careful with the scripture that we read there's a lot there amen the fats shall overflow with wine and with oil let's go back and just look at that wine and oil again brother brandom gives us that in the third seal Hallelujah he says this and this is at the very end of the quote sis when you get that paragraph up it's like the last uh sentence in it uh in the third seal he says now oil typifies Spirit right glory to God and wine symbolizes stimulation of Revelation so the fats are going to overflow with wine and with oil they're going to overflow with the spirit and also overflow with stimulation of Revelation watch this now and it says uh it says boy I like to run all over the place it's a wonder I didn't wake up the neighborhood when the Lord showed me that stimulation of Revelation so brother brandom experienced it himself before he actually came to preach it not only did God reveal it to him but he showed him what it felt like and when he when he got a feeling he took off running thought he was going to wake up the neighborhood you talking about a fool for Christ praise the Lord look at this he says uh stimulation revelation see oil and wine in the Bible is associated together always I got the concordance and looked and there's a string of them like that where wine and oil goes together all the time see says when the truth of a promised word of God has been truly revealed to his Saints that's filled with oil amen filled with the spirit they all get stimulated it says wine is a stimulation Glory it says I feel it right now stimulated with joy shouts and when it does it has the same effect upon them that wine does upon a natural man because when the Revelation has been given of a truth of God and the True Believer filled with oil and the Revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that it makes him behaves him behave itself unnormal see that's why brother Jerry come running all all the way from the back all the way to the front make him behave your unnormal brother I come here to get something from God and when you get what what you looking for from God it'll make you act crazy let me tell you something you ain't even worship God until you've been called crazy for worshiping him Paul said I worship God in a way that's called hey Hallelujah makes them behave himself unnormal that's right Glory maybe that's what's the matter with them now that's right it makes them behave thems unseemingly a little Wildfire is better than no fire at all Joel 2:24 told us the floors shall be full of wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil who are these [Music] fats a fat is a vessel that actually contains new wine and [Music] oil we need fats that can actually contain the wine and the oil come on somebody Hallelujah now in Mark 2 verse 22 it told us that no man putteth new wine into Old bottles or can we call them old fats else the new wine doth burst the bottles and the wine is spilled and the bottles will be Mar but new wine must be put into new bottles yes sir yes sir now now now now now brother Paul you know called it it's it's the skins that they Ed animal skin back in those days and what would happen I'm going to I'm going on to impersonation of Christianity the second quote there uh what what happened is that they would take this uh this wine they put it in an old animal skin but what would keep the wine is actually the fat that was in the skin because that was a oily substance and it allowed amen the skin because of the fat to be flexible but if the fat dried out in the skin then when you put new wine in that it would burst the bottle because it had no fat hallelujah amen but you need something that that'll keep it oiled on the inside because what's what's containing what what is holding on the inside will not cause it to break on the outside if we got a little FS come on church but you but we need some facts we need some people feeling and yielding their body to Christ Hallelujah yielding their their person to Christ that he can fill it with oil and wine that other other people can be edified by what's coming out of you hey the facts and you are these facts you're going to be filled with oil and wine it's a prophecy from Joel [Applause] when you coming here to church you're coming here for a feeling that's that's why we gather here for a feeling get and and like like I read at the beginning of the year the woman the woman was in debt yes sir and she needed some vessels amen that she can fill up with uh with with with with with wine I mean with oil she filled them up with oil and she sold the oil Hallelujah once she so said now you and your your son I know you've been in debt but you and your sons now that y'all sold all this y'all live off the rest God had given her an overflow hey God want to give somebody else an overflow a spiritual overflow but first God needs some vessels God needs some vessels do you want to be a vessel here am I send me anybody got that type of Desire do you want to be a vessel used by God a facts filled with oil and filled with [Applause] wine if you don't want to be that I got good news there's a prophecy over your life and even if you don't desire to be a [Music] fat you will be because Joel said y the fat will overflow with wine and with oil Hallelujah hallu you are the vessel you are the living statue that's carrying God oh we're not looking at relics amen I'm looking at Living living statue of a perfect man this is what I'm looking atallah all right all right all right all right let me read this from the impersonation of Christianity and this is I love the title I love the title cuz we're not here trying to impersonate Christians they had a son Lord I want to be a Christian in my heart I I I really really want to be a Christian and you know back back in those days they didn't they didn't really have many verses that's right but just a simple tune Lord I want to be a Christian in my heart in my heart in my heart that's all they said Lord I want be a Christian in my heart I'm not not in my flesh amen not in my mind but God down here I want to be a Christian and I want to be filled with wine I want to be filled with oil I want to be fill with you Jesus am I can't even think of it this feel me they see is you Lord glorify your name f my life till all they see is you Lord glorify cuz all I want come on Church mean it is for you for you to be glorify yes you to be lifted High all I want Hallelujah is for you to be you to be glorify oh you to be lifted High we can sing that at the end and I want y'all to sing with all your heart God I want you to be glorified inside of me I want to be filled with wine I want to be filled with oil brother brandom tells us here in the message impersonation of Christianity he says I often wondered why that statement was made why you can't put new wine in old bottle he says I come to find out that look where we got a glass jug a bottle why couldn't I put new wine in those things they put old wine in it but I found out that back in the days when Jesus was speaking of the bottles wasn't made of glass they didn't have the glass blowers in those days and they was made out of an animal skin and the animal skin had been tanged and and what was and was sewed up or tied up and they put the wine the water the liquids in a skin bottle so you're the skin today amen a skin bottle and then after that bottle becomes so old until no wine in it or anything it dried out Hallelujah we need a fresh experience with God the animal oil of the skin left it and and see that's the fat the animal oil the animal oil of the skin left it and then it got hard and stiff help us Lord Jesus I don't want to be hard and stiff be so mean I don't want to be that way Jesus always trying to give somebody you know you cross me I'm going to give you a piece of my mind if you keep giving out pieces of your [Music] mind event you won't have no mind that's right brother it says uh they made out of an animal skin animal skin I'm sorry an animal oil of the skin left it and then it got hard and stiff and I see what Jesus meant then if you put new wine unfermented wine into a bottle like that and that new wine had life in it it went to working and fermenting it would burst the bottle and that's the way you take the baptism of the Holy Ghost and put it in an old dry formal cide it'll blow up as sure as the world you just can't have it like that he says you try to take the baptism of the Holy Ghost with an old experience of some long drwn out Church experience it'll blow up as sure as the world but new wine said Jesus goes in new bottles the new bottles has steal the animal oil in the skins that means you got some fat Hallelujah glory to God and it's flexible it says that's the way God's Church must be for re for Revival amen if we want a Revival we have to remain flexible you're going to need some fat in order to be a fat you're going to need some [Music] fat a little bit of oil to keep everything amen loose on the inside hello somebody you ought to know where you at now you know if you need some oil this morning am you're getting a little rigid you're getting a little stiff you going to need some [Music] oil all right look now it says uh you know and and and see Church oil will help us put up with what we're going through on our jobs we we can we can kind of work with the boss a little bit more when we got oil when we're flexible hello sometime you listening to the people on your job rather than listening to the Holy Spirit causes you to get a little stiff amen you can't sometimes you can't get around them water cooler conversations amen you have to avoid some of that type of stuff if you want to stay flexible amen Church glory to God people lead you to do all kind of crazy things you standing at some line and don't even know how you got there glory to God lost your job because you got caught up with the wrong thing hello somebody but stay flexible amen that way you can hear the spirit of God speak to you say no no no stay away from this wait a minute this ain't me there's a spirit behind this yes glory to God look you going have to have know how to navigate in these days all right let me go on Amen somebody say well you just ain't uh what they call you uh you don't you don't go out with nobody you uh nonsocial you antisocial you what else they use what's some other Lang introvert yeah ab ab no and you be feeling you're not a team player Oh Lord look at that and they get you all wrapped up in all this because you don't want to go where they they don't no when I was working they would they have happy hour and that was a time for everybody to get together and just kind of hang out Jack why don't you come with us to happy hour I have [Music] lines and I'm not going over that line happy [Applause] hour well we ain't doing nothing we is that right I ain't doing nothing either I won't be there Holy Ghost don't let me go to happy hour amen Church you got to have some lines you got to have your own personal convictions and look young people you going to have that if you don't get convictions now you won't have them later on in life look when you get into business since people be having you make business decisions that against the word of God you got to have some conviction to say no all right all right all right all right so you might as well develop that no muscle right now it'll be strong when you get older you won't be compromising for money amen let me try to finish this quote I'mma finish this and I'm going to cut off I promise brother amen amen look he says um you know you could you uh you can't put the new wine which represents the word new wine which represents the word put the new wine in the old bottle and you'll read the word and it says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the old bottle would go poof or I say something like now we not looking for relics poof but but but but but a but but a new bottle say amen amen amen it says poof it says uh blow up I don't believe it it says the baptism of the Holy Ghost is just as real today as it ever was poof I don't believe it and what do you do you spoil both bottle and wine you're casting pearls before wine it says your message is gone to pieces and no one receives it and it just blows up till uh till that's all there there is to it but you get new bottles and put some new Holy Ghost wine into it and the word says it's working alive in our hearts and it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday then and forever the the wine says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the new bottle says amen such as I said Jesus Christ was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities with his stripes we were healed just the same yesterday to day and forever see see that I said when your when your when your pole has been broken where you going to now that's right I'm going to the source of the pole I'm going to Christ say he said he said he said says uh uh uh the new bottle said amen it spreads out with new life both of them is kept and preserved so uh uh so you can't put new wine into Old bottles says on the day of Pentecost God had 120 brand new Pentecostal bottles setting with their their necks up and when the Holy Spirit fell from heaven it filled those bottles and they bounced all right Glory Glory Glory Glory I don't even know okay I know they [Music] bounced I don't lost my spot here but that's okay okay bounce they bounced all over the place preaching the gospel to the Known World declaring that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today and forever no is it am oh how I thank God for that amen I thank God for that church we need to be fats and the scripture told us Dar in Joel to that the fats would be would be filled with oil and wine one last quote United uh under one head and and it said the fats will be filled with oil why and I'm going tell you this what I'm looking for now brother brandom in this next quote is's going to tell us you're going to be filled with something you have to choose what you're going to be filled with what I want to be filled with is oil and wine he in this message United under one head musicians y'all can come amen he says that's the way it is with the Born Again experience of God man says there is no such a thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost it shows he hasn't got it he trust his Creeds We Trust what God said he says now what happens you can't stand neutral you got to be filled with something to survive he says notice you might be filled with one thing over another you say brother brandom I'm kind of on the of on the fence no you're not the Bible plainly says that all that was not sealed with the Holy Ghost received the mark of the beast so this is why it's compulsory it's uh compelling it's essential that you fill with the Holy Ghost because otherwise you'll be filled with the mark of the Beast it says holy it says uh um brother brandom I'm kind on fense no you're not the Bible plainly says that all that was not sealed with the Holy Ghost received the mark of the beast all that didn't have the Seal of God in their forehead had the mark of the beast you got one you've got one of it now I like to test it just a little bit and see where we're standing oh the mark of the beast remember is a religious Mark Sir certainly it is and you might be fill with religion you can have all kinds of religion that doesn't save you at all you can just be a religious fanatic if you want to be touch not taste not handle not smell not that don't have one thing to do with the Holy Ghost you might be filled with a bunch of malice you might
