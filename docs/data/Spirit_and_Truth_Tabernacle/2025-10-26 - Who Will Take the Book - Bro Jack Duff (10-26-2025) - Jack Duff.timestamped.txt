[26:05] our heads.
[26:08] Almighty God, Father, we come to you our
[26:11] great God and King because of who you
[26:14] are, Lord, and everything that you mean
[26:16] to us. Father, we can humbly bow our
[26:19] hearts and our heads before you, Lord,
[26:20] knowing that you are worthy, Lord. Great
[26:23] you are. Father, we pray for our
[26:26] brothers and sisters, Lord, that cannot
[26:28] make it to service this morning. You
[26:29] know the needs that they have, Lord. You
[26:31] know what they're going through. And if
[26:33] they're in church somewhere else, bless
[26:35] them where they are, Lord Jesus. and may
[26:37] the Holy Ghost fall. And Father, we have
[26:39] many saints that'll be traveling to
[26:41] Australia, Lord God. Father, you promise
[26:44] to be with them, even in them, no, no
[26:46] matter where they go, Father God. So, we
[26:48] trust, Father, that you'll give them
[26:50] traveling mercies, but we want to ask
[26:52] for it, Lord. That you'll keep them safe
[26:54] and out of harm's way, Lord. May they
[26:56] have no issues, no rough turbulence,
[26:59] Lord Jesus. Nothing to block them from
[27:02] meeting their next plane, Lord Jesus.
[27:04] May everything run smooth for them,
[27:06] Lord. And when the services take place,
[27:09] may you show up, Lord Jesus, and do what
[27:11] you do. You are the supernatural God,
[27:14] Father. And we just ask that you move
[27:15] mightily amongst your people. We're so
[27:18] grateful for your love and for your
[27:19] presence this morning, Lord. We ask that
[27:21] you would move in our midst, Lord. That
[27:23] you would bless our pastor, Lord, as he
[27:25] prepares to bring the message this
[27:27] morning, Lord. May you speak to him and
[27:29] through him to us, Lord Jesus, that we
[27:32] all may hear and believe, Father, that
[27:34] you may transform our lives. Father, we
[27:37] pray over our giving, Lord Jesus.
[27:39] Father, your people, Lord, have given
[27:41] according to your word. You said to
[27:43] bring into your storehouse. You will
[27:44] open the windows of heaven pour out a
[27:46] blessing. There wouldn't be room enough
[27:47] to receive it. Father, you said that you
[27:50] would rebuke the devourer for our sake.
[27:52] You said, "Give and it shall be given to
[27:54] you. Good measure, pressed down, shaken
[27:56] together, running over men given to your
[27:58] bosom." Father, that's your word and we
[28:01] believe it, Father. Father, we're we're
[28:03] tired of living below our God-given
[28:06] privileges, Lord. Father, we're not
[28:08] supposed to live, Lord, as poppers here
[28:10] upon the earth, Lord. That's not what
[28:12] we're called to do. You told us, Lord,
[28:14] the poor would be with us always. You
[28:16] never said that we would be poor. So,
[28:18] Father, we refuse to receive these
[28:20] things that Satan would try to put on
[28:22] your believing children. Father, there
[28:24] should not be a person in here that
[28:26] lacks anything because you are the giver
[28:29] of all things. You will withhold no good
[28:31] thing from your children, Lord. So, we
[28:33] believe, Father, you'll meet every need
[28:35] that your people have both spiritually,
[28:37] physically, financially, domestically,
[28:40] materially. Everything you can bless
[28:42] your people with, Lord, we ask that you
[28:43] would shower them with it. Oh, Father,
[28:46] for great are your windows, Lord. how
[28:48] you flooded the earth with blessing with
[28:49] with the rain. Flower your pe shower
[28:52] your people with blessings. Father is
[28:54] our sincere prayer. Anoint our pastor,
[28:56] Lord God. We love you, Father. We praise
[28:58] you and thank you for your amazing
[29:00] grace. It's in Jesus Christ's name we
[29:02] pray. Amen. Amen.
[29:08] Your faithfulness
[29:12] remains.
[29:17] I believe
[29:21] that I will see
[29:26] the goodness
[29:28] of
[29:30] the Lord
[29:34] and I'm confident
[29:39] as seasons

[41:28] able to go represent and uh just just
[41:32] show brother Anderson and his family and
[41:33] church that we're concerned, we care.
[41:37] Amen. And we're uh praying for you as
[41:39] you go through this season. Amen. And so
[41:42] remember them in your prayers as well.
[41:45] Praise the Lord. Um so I was um
[41:50] at last week I was preaching a sermon on
[41:53] uh u miracles happen in the boat and at
[41:56] the very first quote start off saying uh
[41:59] brother Brandham saying I got all these
[42:01] different thoughts you know that I want
[42:03] to present so I have to you got to
[42:05] settle on one and I had a a bunch of
[42:08] different thoughts last week and I still
[42:09] got some. And um uh but there was
[42:13] something the Lord just kind of brought
[42:14] back to me in prayer. It was a sermon
[42:16] that I preached some years ago and I
[42:18] wanted to uh return to that sermon. Some
[42:21] of you have never heard it before. So
[42:23] it's going to be brand new to you. Uh
[42:25] but others, amen, have heard it, but you
[42:27] might have forgot it. So it'll still be
[42:30] fresh to you as well. And and uh but I
[42:32] want to go back. And when I got there on
[42:34] Friday night at uh I didn't even know
[42:36] they were having service at brother
[42:38] Anderson church, but I happened to go
[42:40] and the brother was preaching and my
[42:41] god, he walked right into some of the
[42:42] notes I had. So I said, "Well, that's my
[42:45] confirmation." And uh we'll go forward
[42:47] with that. So I want to ask you turn
[42:50] with me to the book of Joshua.
[42:53] Amen. Chapter 15.
[42:56] Praise the Lord. And um we want to uh
[43:02] catch verse 13 uh here out of chapter
[43:06] 15. Praise the Lord.
[43:10] Our title, amen, is um who will take the
[43:17] book?
[43:18] Amen. Who will take the book? Uh verse
[43:23] 13 says, "And unto Caleb,
[43:27] the son of Jeffa,
[43:30] he gave a part among the children of
[43:32] Judah,
[43:35] according to the commandment of the Lord
[43:37] to Joshua, even the city of Arba, the
[43:41] father of Anch, which city is a Hebron."
[43:44] Now, uh um as we go deeper into this,
[43:48] you know,
[43:50] everything has significance in
[43:53] scripture.
[43:55] And um now what we're what we're dealing
[43:58] with here is Joshua dividing the land.
[44:00] And uh he's getting um uh Caleb is
[44:04] actually getting a part of the land that
[44:07] belongs to the tribe of Judah. All
[44:10] right. Caleb is getting a part of the
[44:12] land that belongs to the tribe of Judah.
[44:16] And we know that, you know, Christ uh
[44:19] came from that that tribe of Judah. He
[44:21] is the lion of the tribe of Judah.
[44:24] Right? So uh let's just kind of follow
[44:27] this in and verse 14 says and and Caleb
[44:30] drove
[44:32] then the three sons of Anoche and Ahimam
[44:37] tal the children of Anoch
[44:40] uh and these were these were giants. Now
[44:42] the children of Anoch were giants. These
[44:44] were the ones they were afraid of. They
[44:45] came back with a bad report. giants in
[44:48] the land and Caleb. Caleb, you know, we
[44:51] more than able, bro. We need some
[44:53] Calebs.
[44:55] Not looking at circumstances and
[44:56] situations. We more than able to drive
[44:59] these devils out.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. My God. And verse 15 says, he went
[45:04] up then to the inhabitants of Deir,
[45:08] and the name of Deir before
[45:11] was Kjath Sephir.
[45:14] And Caleb said, "He that smiteth Kurjath
[45:17] Cifir, and taketh it, to him will I give
[45:22] Axa, my daughter, to wife."
[45:26] And Ameiel,
[45:29] the son of Kenaz,
[45:31] the brother of Caleb, took it, and he
[45:36] gave him Axa, his daughter, to wife. And
[45:40] it came to pass as she came unto him
[45:42] that she moved him to ask of her father
[45:47] a field.
[45:49] Amen. Just ask daddy.
[45:52] Amen. Ask of her. Ask of her father a
[45:55] field. And she lighted off her ass. Now
[45:58] notice now you you can't ask daddy for a
[46:01] field if daddy ain't got no field.
[46:06] You can only ask people for something
[46:08] that you know they already got.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm telling you, your daddy got
[46:14] it.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; You just simply need to ask him for it.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Ask and it shall be
[46:23] &gt;&gt; given. Yeah. Ask and it shall be given.
[46:26] Seek and ye shall find. Knock
[46:29] &gt;&gt; and the door will be open.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Daddy got it.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Uh it says um um and and she lighted off
[46:39] her ass. And Caleb said unto her, "What
[46:42] wouldest thou?"
[46:45] Who answered, "Give me a blessing,
[46:49] for thou hast given me a south land. Uh
[46:53] give me also springs of water." And he
[46:56] gave her the upper springs
[46:59] and the nether springs.
[47:01] This is the inheritance of the tribe of
[47:05] the children of Judah according to their
[47:07] families.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray over the word. Father,
[47:12] we thank you for the ability to read the
[47:14] word. But we trust that the Holy Spirit
[47:16] would now take control over what has
[47:19] been read. And may you, God, just begin
[47:22] to minister to our hearts through this.
[47:24] May it be fresh revelation, God, to our
[47:27] hearts. And God, we ask that you would
[47:29] inspire us through your word, encourage
[47:31] us, correct us, whatever we have need
[47:33] of, Lord, do it uh today. And we trust,
[47:36] Lord Jesus, that you would just take we
[47:39] take control over every spirit that's
[47:41] against your spirit even right now. Take
[47:43] control of our thoughts, those that are
[47:45] being presented, those that are being
[47:46] received. God, get glory out of this
[47:48] portion of the service. In Jesus' name
[47:51] we pray. Amen. Amen. You can be seated
[47:54] in the presence of the Lord. who will
[47:56] take the book. Amen. Praise the Lord. I
[48:01] I I I I
[48:03] uh was just in prayer and and the Lord
[48:05] just kind of triggered this back into my
[48:08] spirit. I've preached this um a little
[48:10] bit ago, but the Lord brought it back to
[48:12] me and I said, "Well, I'll just uh touch
[48:15] that again." And uh the other thing is
[48:18] um I know I got a couple services that
[48:20] I'm scheduled to preach when I get to
[48:22] Australia, but even when I get back from
[48:24] Australia, um my schedule kind of picked
[48:27] up here at the end of the year, I got a
[48:30] um I'll be ministering for brother Tim
[48:32] Puit. Amen. Uh there in Louisiana at his
[48:36] church for their harvest um festival. So
[48:40] that'll be coming up in a few weeks in
[48:41] November. and then um uh have to take a
[48:45] trip to Ghana uh over Christmas time. So
[48:48] uh I got a few things and you know and
[48:50] you're always looking for Lord what do
[48:52] you want me to say because uh you know
[48:55] there's a lot to say. I mean there's a
[48:58] lot to say but it's trying to figure out
[48:59] what to say at that specific time. Amen.
[49:03] So um you know so we're just just
[49:05] trusting the Lord to help us and maybe
[49:07] this sermon will uh go to one of those
[49:09] places but we'll we'll see. Amen. Um so
[49:14] you know I I one of the things I wanted
[49:17] to start off by saying here is that uh
[49:20] the very purpose of God creating
[49:24] uh man is so that he could have
[49:26] fellowship. And um the the when he
[49:29] created Adam, he made a statement that
[49:32] it wasn't good for Adam to be alone.
[49:36] Praise the Lord. God himself didn't even
[49:39] want to be alone. But it was not good
[49:42] for the man to be alone. And and and
[49:45] what we see is that there is always amen
[49:49] here even the reward for who is going to
[49:52] take this city of Kerjath Cifa the
[49:55] reward the greatest reward that could be
[49:58] given that Caleb could think about I'm
[50:00] going to give my daughter. Amen. as your
[50:03] wife,
[50:04] &gt;&gt; right? And and and and and you know, and
[50:06] and it's something about this guy,
[50:08] Arthur, is like he saw that as a great
[50:10] prize.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; What? And he was willing to he was
[50:13] willing to go fight. Didn't matter what
[50:15] giants was in the way, this man was
[50:17] willing to go fight.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And uh you know, and so I
[50:22] just I I think you know what we're going
[50:24] to find, I'm going to read a couple
[50:25] quotes here, but um you know, it's
[50:28] always been God's uh objective for Amen.
[50:31] for for a man to have a wife. Amen.
[50:33] Especially, you know, if he was a single
[50:35] man, it was it was God's objective for
[50:36] him to have a wife because, you know, it
[50:39] was not good for him to be dwelling
[50:41] alone.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's that's God's
[50:45] thoughts
[50:46] &gt;&gt; very from the very beginning. That is
[50:49] God's thoughts that he would have a
[50:50] wife. And notice now, it wasn't just
[50:53] that Adam would have a wife. He was
[50:55] speaking about himself
[50:56] &gt;&gt; because he was going to also have a
[50:58] wife. And I'm telling you, his wife hath
[51:01] made herself ready. She's been dressed
[51:05] by the word of God.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, so it's always been in
[51:09] God's mind that there would be a union,
[51:11] you know. So, let's look at let's look
[51:13] at this. Amen. In um a a a sermon here.
[51:18] Uh God's only provided
[51:21] place of worship. Let me just see
[51:23] something. I got to make sure. Wait a
[51:26] minute. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I I'll
[51:28] come to that. uh God's God's only
[51:30] provided place of worship. Uh the
[51:32] prophet says um the pyramid being those
[51:35] foundations up into the king's chamber.
[51:39] He says, "And just before you hit the
[51:41] seventh wall, it says there is a little
[51:44] introduction plank there where a
[51:47] messenger comes out to bring you to the
[51:49] king." And and and I like this. This
[51:51] brother read this quote on Friday night
[51:52] and and it was connecting to another
[51:54] quote that I wanted to read out of feast
[51:56] of the trumpets but but I got I took his
[51:58] and I wanted to bring it. Uh he says um
[52:01] um there there's a little introduction
[52:03] plank there where a messenger comes out
[52:05] to bring you to the king. The messenger
[52:08] John the Baptist that introduced to the
[52:11] king. Amen. But the headstone was
[52:13] rejected and they don't know the stone
[52:15] of scone or whatever it is. They don't
[52:18] know where uh where it's at because it's
[52:21] a rejected stone. But that's the stone
[52:23] that caps the whole thing that makes it
[52:26] the pyramid through the complete seven
[52:28] church ages. Add grace. Add this. Uh he
[52:32] says add this. There's seven ads. The
[52:34] last one is Christ which is charity.
[52:37] Says add this to your charity. Add grace
[52:39] to your grace and add something else and
[52:41] something else till it gets up to Christ
[52:43] is the headstone and I am the door. So,
[52:45] brother Random's kind of sharing this
[52:47] about this the pyramid and how they
[52:49] designed it.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; And uh and in designing it, there was
[52:53] seven steps to get you to the top.
[52:55] Hallelujah. And when you got to the the
[52:57] top, he said there was a a messenger
[53:00] that was there at the top to introduce
[53:03] you. Amen. Uh uh to to to I mean to
[53:06] introduce you to the king, to Christ,
[53:08] right? And uh so so when we look at this
[53:11] message that we have, we have come
[53:13] through seven steps. We come from
[53:16] Ephesus all the way to Leia.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; And when you get to the seventh step,
[53:21] there has to be a messenger,
[53:25] a prophet. Praise God. At the seventh
[53:28] step, and when the prophet is there, his
[53:31] job is to introduce you to the king.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. It was it was uh uh in
[53:37] Abraham's day, he had a he had a a a
[53:40] messenger. Praise God. the Eleaza. He
[53:44] was the messenger that went to find
[53:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He went to find
[53:49] something very important for Isaac. He
[53:52] went to find a bride.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let us go on a little
[54:02] further here.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; The feast of the trumpets. Brother
[54:05] Brandon makes a statement here. Go into
[54:08] the prophet's chamber
[54:11] and watch them seven steps. Now, where
[54:13] is it at? In the prophet's chamber.
[54:15] Watch them seven steps. Where did the
[54:18] guard meet the challenge to bring the
[54:20] comer into the presence of the king? At
[54:23] the top of the steps was in the seventh
[54:25] step. There shows that we've got to come
[54:28] again with the same spirit that was on
[54:31] John. He introduced the Messiah. He was
[54:34] greater than all the prophets. He
[54:36] introduced it and we've got to come to a
[54:38] place again to something that's going to
[54:40] introduce the Messiah. Now, that's a
[54:43] very important quote,
[54:45] &gt;&gt; you know, because uh uh I think the
[54:47] scripture even said that, you know,
[54:49] there was none like John. No, no
[54:51] ministry like his, you know, and and
[54:53] brother Brandham had to break it down.
[54:54] He says he says until that time,
[54:58] &gt;&gt; right? There was none like John until
[54:59] that time. And the reason because
[55:01] because John's ministry was to introduce
[55:05] Messiah.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That was Messiah at his
[55:09] first coming. But there was coming
[55:11] another ministry, another Elijah that
[55:13] would come to introduce Messiah. And he
[55:16] introduces Messiah on the seventh step
[55:19] in the Leodysian churches. He introduces
[55:22] Messiah.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. We know
[55:26] what we're standing on here, church. All
[55:28] right. He says, um, "And how will the
[55:31] Messiah, the people that's believeing,
[55:34] uh, believe in him know it unless
[55:36] they're constantly in the word to know
[55:38] that he is?" Daniel said, "The wise
[55:41] shall know, but the the the foolish and
[55:43] the unwise wouldn't know. They shall
[55:45] know their God." Now, it says, "Now, how
[55:47] shall now he shall appear in the last
[55:50] days is to bring the people back to the
[55:52] word so that the bride will know her
[55:55] husband.
[55:57] He's to bring the people back to the
[55:59] word so that the bride will the bride
[56:02] will know her husband and who is her
[56:06] husband. He says know her mate the
[56:09] revealed word.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah to the lamb of God. Your your
[56:14] husband your mate is the revealed word
[56:18] of God.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you're going to know
[56:21] him. You're going to know exactly how he
[56:23] thinks. You're going to know exactly how
[56:25] he feels by listening and reading the
[56:28] revealed word for your day.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. He says
[56:33] this. He says that's why this has to
[56:36] happen. It wasn't in the reformers.
[56:37] Wasn't in Luther Wesley and the
[56:39] Pentecostals and them. Scripture says it
[56:41] wasn't, but it will come. That is his
[56:44] promise for this age. We're living in
[56:46] the age that is coming will be in. She
[56:48] must be identified in him. Any woman
[56:51] must be identified with her husband for
[56:53] the 2011. And how is the woman
[56:55] identified with her husband? She takes
[56:57] on his name. Her name changes to his
[57:00] name. So she's identified with him when
[57:03] she takes on his name. And we have taken
[57:05] on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; All right. It says any woman must be
[57:10] identified with her husband for the
[57:11] 2011. And Christ's bride has to be
[57:15] identified with him for the 2011. And he
[57:17] is the word, not the denomination, the
[57:20] word. We are to be children of the
[57:22] light. And the light is the word which
[57:24] is made light for this age. How do we
[57:27] know light except it come from the word?
[57:30] All right. The word made flesh is the
[57:32] light of the age when you see it. Amen.
[57:35] And the Bible said so. All right. I'm
[57:37] just laying my foundation here. Praise
[57:40] God. Hallelujah. Amen. And I I I'm I'm
[57:44] glad that we have been introduced to the
[57:47] king.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; We've been introduced, amen, to uh the
[57:52] word, right? And he had and he and this
[57:55] word has complete rulership in our
[57:57] lives. Complete control. We do things
[58:01] because we see it in the word. The way I
[58:04] dress is because the word tell me to
[58:06] dress that way. Amen. The way I conduct
[58:08] myself is because the word tells me to
[58:10] conduct myself that way. Hallelujah.
[58:14] Amen. We we've been introduced to
[58:16] something. We thank God for it. Now, I
[58:18] I'm I'm um you know, certainly uh uh uh
[58:22] uh uh um you know, just kind of driving
[58:24] this point home of you know, God wanting
[58:26] a br a bride. And the same thing, he
[58:29] wants men to have that. He want He wants
[58:32] men to have that too, you know. So, and
[58:34] and when you when you get one, don't
[58:36] mess it up.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Don't mess it up. When God give you one,
[58:41] don't mess it up. do everything you can
[58:42] to keep it because you know brother
[58:44] brother Brandham say the greatest thing
[58:46] outside of salvation.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that?
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Some of us think the greatest thing
[58:51] outside of salvation is our car,
[58:54] &gt;&gt; our house,
[58:56] &gt;&gt; our career. No. The greatest thing
[59:00] outside of salvation that God could give
[59:02] a man is to give him a wife.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Brother, that's something. That's a
[59:09] powerful statement. Yes, sir.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so I tell you, it's it's
[59:13] important when we get this this, you
[59:15] know, this thing, you know, we see that
[59:16] even God himself wanted to have a bride.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Even God wanted to have a bride. I'm
[59:21] getting ready to read you something
[59:22] here. Even God wanted to have a bride.
[59:26] It's It's not normal for a man not to
[59:27] want to be married.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Can I say that again? It's not normal
[59:32] for a man not to want to be married.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Even God himself wanted to have a bride.
[59:37] That attribute that was in God should be
[59:39] in every man. Yes, sir.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. All right. Look at
[59:45] this. Now look at what brother Random
[59:46] says in spoken words original seed.
[59:49] It says, "Now Jehovah had a bride.
[59:53] Jehovah had a bride once. Adam had a
[59:56] bride.
[59:58] Jesus had a bride." Right? Uh he says um
[1:00:03] Jehovah had a bride. You know that he
[1:00:06] had to put her away. She become a
[1:00:09] Right? So he put her away and look at
[1:00:12] now watch this because this ties into
[1:00:14] Wednesday night. Watch it now. It says
[1:00:16] that's exactly what he said. She become
[1:00:18] a a prostitute. What caused her
[1:00:21] to do that? I wish we had time to read
[1:00:23] it. I may get to I may get to some of it
[1:00:26] after a while. It was in the time of
[1:00:28] Samuel. When did his bride become a
[1:00:30] It was in God's bride became a
[1:00:33] and he had to put her away. He
[1:00:35] said because it was during the time of
[1:00:37] Samuel. said when Israel had a king,
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; that's when he had to put her away.
[1:00:43] That's when she walked out on him.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; But he always wanted a bride.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; But his bride walked out on him.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; My God. Even when God gave uh Eve to
[1:00:55] Adam, she walked out on him.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. My my my
[1:01:03] my. We thank God that, you know, Adam
[1:01:05] had something on the inside that he stay
[1:01:07] with her because God could have killed
[1:01:08] her
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; in the condition that she was in. And
[1:01:11] unless Adam did what he did, uh God
[1:01:14] would have killed God would have killed
[1:01:16] Eve and maybe got another rib out of
[1:01:18] him.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Look at this
[1:01:23] now. It says um I wish we had time to
[1:01:26] read it. I I may get to some of it after
[1:01:28] a while. It was in the time of Samuel
[1:01:30] when when Israel had a king of God and
[1:01:33] she was a virgin. She was going to
[1:01:35] produce something. Uh and what happened?
[1:01:38] She began to look around and see other
[1:01:41] nations and kings. So she wanted to be
[1:01:43] like the rest of them. You backwash
[1:01:45] Pentecost. That's exactly what you done.
[1:01:47] And brother Brandham said, I mean now
[1:01:49] they wanted a a a man to be a leader.
[1:01:53] They wanted this uh this ruler to be
[1:01:56] embodied in a human being. Now, that
[1:01:58] desire was actually the right desire. It
[1:02:02] was perfectly in line with what God
[1:02:04] already had in his mind. He was going to
[1:02:07] humanize the leadership.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't going to be in a in a
[1:02:11] Saul. It was going to be in Jesus.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; He was going to they was going to they
[1:02:17] was going to get a they was going to get
[1:02:19] God as a spirit embodied in a man to be
[1:02:22] their king. He was going to come down
[1:02:24] and dwell in their midst. But they got
[1:02:27] ahead of God just like Eve got ahead of
[1:02:30] it.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Truth.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. All right. Let's
[1:02:34] keep on going. It says the old this old
[1:02:38] preacher sitting here nearly 100 years
[1:02:41] old today when Pentecost broke through
[1:02:44] back there. You couldn't tell them
[1:02:46] nothing about no organization. They
[1:02:47] wouldn't listen to that. They call that
[1:02:49] they call the thing of the devil. And
[1:02:52] them men were right. But what did you
[1:02:54] do? You had to act like the rest of the
[1:02:57] churches. You had to organize it. Then
[1:03:00] as uh as he said, you draw fences
[1:03:03] between you. Amen. Went to teaching
[1:03:06] mustn't teach this. Glory to God.
[1:03:07] Hallelujah. This way. And jump up and
[1:03:09] down and speak in tongues and put him in
[1:03:12] as a member. Uh he's got her. He's not
[1:03:15] baptized right. Neither with the water
[1:03:18] nor with the spirit. He's wrong and his
[1:03:21] fruits proved it. Now, what he's saying
[1:03:23] is that, praise the Lord, you know, in
[1:03:26] Pentecost, they just put anybody up
[1:03:29] and and and and and that's the same
[1:03:31] thing, you know, here, you got to have a
[1:03:33] life. You can't be you can't be doing
[1:03:36] one thing out there and then coming up
[1:03:38] here ministering.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; If you don't have no life, you have to
[1:03:42] sit down.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; It it must be a life, right? We're not
[1:03:46] just giving out uh uh uh positions just
[1:03:49] to have people in positions. No, you got
[1:03:52] to have a life,
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; right? And and and brother man saying
[1:03:55] back way back way back in this day, they
[1:03:57] just kind of put anybody in there. They
[1:03:59] baptiz the people and and there's no I
[1:04:01] mean there's really no true repentance.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. Y'all forgive me for
[1:04:06] for saying these things. I mean, you
[1:04:09] know, I I the first time president, you
[1:04:12] know, our president became president, I
[1:04:14] think 45 or 46, I don't know what it
[1:04:16] was, they tried to tell us that he was a
[1:04:18] Christian.
[1:04:21] because he went to church and held the
[1:04:23] Bible up
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; and and and
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; he a Christian.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; I mean, come on. Come on. Come on. We We
[1:04:34] We We We We minimizing what Christianity
[1:04:36] is really all about.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; You You can't sell that to me and tell
[1:04:40] me that this man's a Christian. And let
[1:04:42] me tell you, there's a lot of other
[1:04:44] people out there. They trying to tell
[1:04:45] you Christians. No. Christians don't act
[1:04:47] like that.
[1:04:49] Amen.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. I mean, we got
[1:04:52] we got to uphold the standards of
[1:04:54] Christianity. Oh, Lord, let me let me go
[1:04:56] a little further.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Let me go.
[1:05:00] And they they try to get you to justify
[1:05:02] sinful lifestyles
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; and and try to tie it into a race of
[1:05:07] people
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; because they were actually held back.
[1:05:09] And now these people in this go ungodly
[1:05:12] lifestyle, they've been held. Don't you
[1:05:14] try to equate that. That's right.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; No, we were born this way, God. Yeah, we
[1:05:20] really were born this way.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; No, you made a choice to be that way.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; And God ain't pleased with it.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Amen, church. But but
[1:05:34] don't don't get caught up in all this
[1:05:36] nonsense. We We got to be Christians.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; We got to follow the scripture. We not
[1:05:41] following nothing else but the
[1:05:43] scripture.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us go a little further,
[1:05:46] please.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Let us go just a little further.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Now, watch. I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm
[1:05:53] going I'm I'm bringing this. We're going
[1:05:55] to we're going to get to who will take
[1:05:56] the book in a second. I got I got to
[1:05:58] make a turn. Let me just finish reading
[1:05:59] this. He says this.
[1:06:01] He says, "You had to organize." Then he
[1:06:03] said, "You draw fences between you went
[1:06:05] to teach and lesson teach that." Glory
[1:06:07] to God. Hallelujah. This way. And jump
[1:06:09] up and down and speak with tongues and
[1:06:10] put a man put him in as a member. He's
[1:06:13] got her. I'm sorry. put put him in a
[1:06:15] member. He's got her. He's not baptized,
[1:06:17] right? Neither with the water nor with
[1:06:20] the spirit. The man ain't baptized in no
[1:06:22] way at all. He says he's he's wrong and
[1:06:24] his fruits prove it. He's got the wrong
[1:06:27] kind of seed grow uh grow uh to grow on.
[1:06:30] Bless God, brother. We'll lay hands on
[1:06:32] you here and make you an elder. He just
[1:06:34] got to church yesterday. How he going to
[1:06:36] be an elder? Elder is a seasons a
[1:06:38] seasoned person.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. just like and
[1:06:42] then look, you get people that get saved
[1:06:45] and want to go preaching immediately.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Why don't you sit down and listen to
[1:06:49] something
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; before you go to preaching? Just sit
[1:06:52] down and listen. Praise God. We don't we
[1:06:55] don't do things like that. I mean, I had
[1:06:57] so so many people just kind of come and
[1:06:59] and and how can we get connected with
[1:07:01] your ministry? We want to come and do
[1:07:02] this. I uh you don't even know anything
[1:07:05] about my ministry.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Well, yeah, we want we got this. We got
[1:07:08] this plan. We got that. said, "Well, uh,
[1:07:10] my brother, you know what the scripture
[1:07:12] actually say? The Bible say this. It
[1:07:14] says, "Know them
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; that labor among you."
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; I said, "So, let us get to know you."
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, good God almighty.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; He He had a He had a He wanted to He had
[1:07:28] a rap ministry. He wanted to come and
[1:07:30] rap. I said, "Brother God, deliver me
[1:07:33] from that."
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; God took that away from me. And I ain't
[1:07:39] going to try to dress it up and make it
[1:07:40] Christian.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; That beat is still a really bad beat.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; And it make your body do things it's not
[1:07:48] supposed to do.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; We dance different in the church.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Let me go a little look this type of
[1:07:59] dance. I mean, if the if the if the
[1:08:01] music make you want to get on the ground
[1:08:03] and spin and and all kind of stuff, you
[1:08:05] know something wrong with that.
[1:08:08] Come on, church. All right. Now, all
[1:08:10] right. Let me just keep going. Amen. It
[1:08:14] says um uh lay hands on on you here and
[1:08:16] make you an elder. It says we're going
[1:08:18] to build this organization here till
[1:08:20] it's going to be so uh to be bigger than
[1:08:23] the assemblies. That's just the way it's
[1:08:26] went. Read read the Pentecostal history
[1:08:28] and see if it wasn't if that isn't so of
[1:08:30] any other church. Baptist wants to outdo
[1:08:33] the Methodist. Methodist wants to outdo
[1:08:34] the Lutheran. Lutheran want to outdo the
[1:08:36] Catholic. everyone uh to outdo outdo.
[1:08:40] That's the spirit of the organization.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; We not trying to outdo nobody.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; We just trying to follow the word of the
[1:08:48] Lord. I need to make a shift here. We're
[1:08:51] talking about who will take the book.
[1:08:54] Let us turn amen to um
[1:08:59] uh my Lord. Let us turn over here to um
[1:09:05] Revelation 5.
[1:09:07] Revelation 5. Let us read amen uh from
[1:09:12] this and we'll we kind of catch
[1:09:15] something.
[1:09:17] Thank you Jesus.
[1:09:22] Now
[1:09:24] Revelation 5 uh God's prophets said this
[1:09:28] is the most sublime scripture in the
[1:09:31] Bible when we look at what what is
[1:09:34] happening here. And um
[1:09:39] says, "And I saw in the right hand of
[1:09:41] him that sat on the throne a book
[1:09:44] written within and on the backside it
[1:09:48] was sealed with seven seals." Now the
[1:09:50] first thing that we need to understand
[1:09:52] is that this is uh God is the one that
[1:09:56] sits on the throne and the Bible
[1:09:58] actually tells us that God is a spirit
[1:10:02] and it says that they that worship him
[1:10:04] must worship him in spirit and truth.
[1:10:06] This is what the Bible says. So based on
[1:10:09] what the Bible says, we know when the
[1:10:11] scripture says I saw in the right hand,
[1:10:14] this is not God having a right hand like
[1:10:16] you and I. That's not what the Bible's
[1:10:19] saying here. But what we're seeing is
[1:10:21] that this is a place of authority.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is a position of
[1:10:27] authority. So I saw in the right hand of
[1:10:31] him that sat on the throne. He's the one
[1:10:33] that's in control. Amen. A book written
[1:10:36] within and on the backside sealed with
[1:10:40] seven seals. right now. Um, we happen to
[1:10:45] be living in a day
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; where the seals have been torn off of
[1:10:50] that book
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; and now we can see what's on the inside
[1:10:54] of the book. Back here it was a mystery.
[1:10:57] But we live in a day, hallelujah, where
[1:11:00] God promised that these mysteries would
[1:11:03] be revealed. According to Revelation 10,
[1:11:06] God promised that the mysteries will be
[1:11:08] revealed. When the seventh angel,
[1:11:10] Hallelujah, the one on the seventh
[1:11:12] plank, on the seventh step, when he
[1:11:15] begins to introduce you to the king, you
[1:11:18] will begin to see these things.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Let's go on a little
[1:11:23] further. It says, "And I saw
[1:11:27] a strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[1:11:29] voice, who is worthy
[1:11:33] to open the book and to loose the seals
[1:11:37] thereof?" And and and look at this now.
[1:11:40] John as John is in this vision uh on the
[1:11:43] aisle of Patmas and he sees all this and
[1:11:45] he says and no man in heaven he heard
[1:11:48] the angel cry who's worthy to take this
[1:11:50] book and say no man in heaven nor in
[1:11:53] earth my God neither under the earth was
[1:11:58] able to open the book neither to look
[1:12:01] there. Do we get that? Amen. When when
[1:12:05] John looked, he said, "No, man." I I can
[1:12:08] imagine him look at Noah and say,
[1:12:10] "Noah's not worthy." He looked at
[1:12:13] Jeremiah and say, "Jeremiah's not
[1:12:15] worthy." Looked at Isaiah and said that
[1:12:18] Isaiah was not worthy. Looked at Adam,
[1:12:21] Adam is not worth. Not one man able to
[1:12:24] take this book. Praise God. I mean, he
[1:12:27] maybe maybe he looked at some of the
[1:12:29] other disciples. Peter is not worthy. My
[1:12:33] Paul is not worthy. I mean Matthew is
[1:12:36] not worthy. Mark is not worth. Nobody
[1:12:39] worthy.
[1:12:41] This was a very sad situation. Can I
[1:12:43] bring it even a little for forward?
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. He looked at you.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; You were not worthy.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was not worthy. No man
[1:12:53] worthy to take this book.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Look at it now.
[1:12:59] It says John, this John speaking, "And I
[1:13:03] wept much because no man
[1:13:07] was found worthy to open and to read the
[1:13:09] book, neither to look their own." It
[1:13:12] goes a little further says, "And and one
[1:13:15] of the others said unto me, weep not.
[1:13:18] Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[1:13:22] the root, amen, of David, had prevailed
[1:13:26] to open the book and and to lose the
[1:13:29] seven sisters of And I like this. Amen.
[1:13:31] I yesterday at the at the at the at the
[1:13:33] homegoing service, Brother Lonnie um uh
[1:13:37] Jackson was speaking and uh and he made
[1:13:39] a statement. He says, you know, um he
[1:13:42] was talking about how um uh Brother
[1:13:44] Brandon was having a conversation with
[1:13:46] his with his his sister. their mother
[1:13:47] had just passed and her sister was very
[1:13:50] discouraged by mama mama dime and um and
[1:13:53] and brother Brandham says you know said
[1:13:56] Dolores I want you to go out and look
[1:13:57] out the window. He says when you look
[1:14:00] out the window said I want you to look
[1:14:01] to the left and and and I want you to
[1:14:03] look at and tell me what you see. She
[1:14:05] say I see a big tree big old big oak
[1:14:07] tree. Says okay. He say um you know what
[1:14:10] does the tree look like right now? You
[1:14:12] say, she say, "I see uh I see leaves
[1:14:14] that are green and and brown and and
[1:14:17] red." She he said, "Now, there's other
[1:14:19] times in the springtime where that that
[1:14:21] le that tree is just all green." And he
[1:14:24] actually said, "Now, which season is the
[1:14:27] tree the most pretties."
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; She said he she said, "Well, it's during
[1:14:32] this season of fall time when you got
[1:14:33] all these different colors in the
[1:14:35] leaves. It's not only green, but it's
[1:14:36] it's it's red and it's brown and it's
[1:14:38] green. We get all these color." She
[1:14:40] said, "This is when it's the most
[1:14:41] pretty." He's saying, "Right, this is a
[1:14:43] time where the life is actually going
[1:14:45] out of the tree, but yet it's the most
[1:14:47] prettiest when the life is going out."
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; And he said he said he and he say said a
[1:14:53] lot those those leaves are going to fall
[1:14:55] off. He says, "But the life that was in
[1:14:57] the leaves, it goes right back down the
[1:15:00] the bark of that tree and it gets into
[1:15:03] the the root of the tree."
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And it stays there until
[1:15:07] the winter time is over. And then it
[1:15:10] comes back up in the springtime and
[1:15:12] those leaves will live again.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; He says, "But notice now, Amen. The le
[1:15:18] the the the life goes down into the
[1:15:20] root." And he says, "Now notice, but by
[1:15:23] going into the root, the life is in the
[1:15:25] root of David, which is the Lord Jesus
[1:15:29] Christ, the life is in the root. That's
[1:15:31] why you will spring again."
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:39] Glory to God.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here it is. The Bible, the Bible
[1:15:43] says, Amen. the line of the tribe of
[1:15:46] Judah, the root of David had prevailed
[1:15:48] to open the book and to loose the seven
[1:15:50] seals of Christ is loosening these
[1:15:52] seals. He says, "And I beheld." And lo,
[1:15:56] in the midst of the throne, and of the
[1:15:59] four uh beasts, and in the midst of the
[1:16:02] the uh elders stood a lamb. Now he says,
[1:16:06] he says the lion of the tribe of Judah.
[1:16:10] But when John turns, Amen. he sees a
[1:16:13] lamb. Hallelujah. Because this lion and
[1:16:16] this lamb is the same person. Amen. The
[1:16:19] lion of the tribe of Judas Christ. And
[1:16:21] this lamb, this bleeding bloody lamb, he
[1:16:24] was the lamb of God that took away all
[1:16:26] of our sins.
[1:16:28] Look at this. Look at this.
[1:16:30] It says, "And I beheld, and lo, in the
[1:16:32] midst of the throne, and of the four
[1:16:34] beasts, and in the midst of the uh of
[1:16:36] the elders stood a lamb as it had been
[1:16:38] slain, having seven horns and seven
[1:16:40] eyes." Those are seers, those are
[1:16:43] prophets, the eyes of of a prophet to be
[1:16:45] able to see and give direction for amen.
[1:16:48] for for that age.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Look, he says uh uh the scripture says
[1:16:54] uh uh uh now and I beheld and lo in the
[1:16:58] midst of the throne and the four uh four
[1:17:00] beasts. In the midst of the elders stood
[1:17:02] a lamb as it had been slain, having
[1:17:03] seven horns and seven eyes, which are
[1:17:05] the seven spirits of God sent forth into
[1:17:08] all the earth. And he came and took the
[1:17:12] book out of the right hand of him that
[1:17:14] sat upon the throne. Now, now these
[1:17:16] seven spirits of God that was sent
[1:17:18] through the earth and this ex this
[1:17:20] happened according to Revelation 2 and
[1:17:22] three there were seven messengers, seven
[1:17:24] angels that the scripture scripture
[1:17:26] describes that came at different times
[1:17:28] in history. Paul was the first one to
[1:17:31] come.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; My God. But the last one to come in our
[1:17:35] day happened to be William, Mary, and
[1:17:37] Brandon.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; But God God specifically would send
[1:17:40] different ones at different times in
[1:17:42] order to keep the people lined up with
[1:17:44] the word. is not to worship that man. We
[1:17:47] don't worship Paul sir.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; We don't worship brother Brandham. But
[1:17:50] we will follow them as they follow
[1:17:52] Christ.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; watch this now. Amen. It goes on. It
[1:17:59] says uh and and and he came and took the
[1:18:02] book. This is Christ took the book out
[1:18:04] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[1:18:07] the throne.
[1:18:09] And when he had taken the book,
[1:18:12] the four beasts and four and 20 elders
[1:18:16] fell down before the lamb having every
[1:18:19] one of them harps and golden vows full
[1:18:24] of odors which are the prayers of the
[1:18:26] saints. It says, "And they sung a new
[1:18:29] song, saying, thou art worthy to take
[1:18:33] the book." And the open seal, that mean
[1:18:36] the song was inspired right there. When
[1:18:38] they saw this thing happen, they got
[1:18:39] inspired to start singing a new song.
[1:18:41] I'm telling you, when you when you when
[1:18:43] when when when when this thing begins to
[1:18:45] open up to you.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; It will inspire you and cause you to
[1:18:49] sing some new songs.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. They sung a new song,
[1:18:54] saying, "Thou art worthy to take the
[1:18:56] book and to open the seals thereof. For
[1:18:58] thou was slain, and and hast redeemed us
[1:19:02] to God by thy blood out of every kindred
[1:19:05] and tongue and people and nation, and
[1:19:08] hast made us unto our God, kings and
[1:19:10] priests, and we shall reign on the
[1:19:12] earth."
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Verse 11 says, "And I beheld
[1:19:17] and I heard the voice of many angels
[1:19:19] round about the throne and the beasts
[1:19:22] and and uh and the elders and the number
[1:19:25] of them was 10,000 times 10,000 and
[1:19:28] thousands of thousands."
[1:19:31] A lot of folk here
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; and John heard it. Verse 12, saying with
[1:19:35] a loud voice, "Worthy is the lamb."
[1:19:39] Amen. that was slain to receive power
[1:19:42] and riches and wisdom and strength and
[1:19:44] honor and glory and blessing. Now John
[1:19:47] is hearing all this.
[1:19:49] John is hearing everybody worship when
[1:19:52] they they saw the lamb or the lion of
[1:19:54] the tribe of Judah which is the lamb of
[1:19:55] God take that book out of amen out of
[1:19:59] the the the one who had ownership of the
[1:20:01] book. It was God himself that owned this
[1:20:04] book. This book is a book of redemption.
[1:20:07] Hallelujah. Not just any kind of book,
[1:20:08] but this is a book of redemption. This
[1:20:11] is the those that will be redeemed on
[1:20:13] the earth. Those that will come to truth
[1:20:15] on the earth. God already knew before
[1:20:18] the foundation of the world that you all
[1:20:20] would come to truth.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, "You will know
[1:20:24] the truth
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; and the truth will make you free." God
[1:20:29] already had your name written inside of
[1:20:32] a book. Uh-huh.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; It was in the blood section of the book
[1:20:36] of life. He knew that you would come to
[1:20:39] truth.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; He knew that once you heard it, you
[1:20:42] would not reject it.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus went and died for these people
[1:20:48] that he knew was inside that section of
[1:20:50] the book of life.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Look at this. This is a book of
[1:20:53] redemption. And and John knew if
[1:20:57] nobody's worthy to take that book, all
[1:20:59] creation was lost. So when he saw
[1:21:02] Christ, amen, step forth the lamb. They
[1:21:05] said the the elders said, "Behold the
[1:21:06] lion of the tribe of Judah." He said,
[1:21:08] "But he saw he turned and he saw a
[1:21:09] lamb." He knew it was Christ that came
[1:21:12] and that was worthy to take that book
[1:21:14] out of the hand of him that owned it.
[1:21:18] He brought redemption to his church.
[1:21:20] Now, now John heard all these people
[1:21:21] worshiping. said he said the verse uh
[1:21:24] verse verse 11 he says uh and I beheld
[1:21:28] and I heard the voice of many angels
[1:21:30] round about the throne the beasts the
[1:21:34] elders and the number of them was 10,000
[1:21:37] times 10,000 and thousands of thou I
[1:21:39] mean John this is a lot of folk
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; yes sir
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; I hear angels worshiping
[1:21:46] I I hear the beasts I hear the elders I
[1:21:49] mean look look and let me tell you
[1:21:50] something when when Uh when you get a
[1:21:53] real revelation, it ought to cause you
[1:21:55] to worship, too.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; I mean, and and and in this scene,
[1:22:00] nobody was just standing around,
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; brother. People were involved in
[1:22:05] worship.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; When they realized what had happened
[1:22:08] because all everything would have been
[1:22:10] lost had not this lamb stepped forth.
[1:22:13] But when they saw him step forth, they
[1:22:14] said, "My God." I mean, it invoked
[1:22:16] praise and worship.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:20] Let us go forward here. Verse 12 again.
[1:22:24] Say with a loud voice, worthy is the
[1:22:25] lamb that was slain to receive power and
[1:22:27] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:22:30] and glory and blessing.
[1:22:34] Glory to God. I tell you the truth, this
[1:22:38] just blesses my heart.
[1:22:41] This blessed my heart. Let me just stop
[1:22:43] at verse 12 just for a second.
[1:22:47] Uh, I want to catch a quote
[1:22:51] out of uh um the breach between the
[1:22:54] seven church agents and seven seals. And
[1:22:57] I think I might have put he is not an
[1:22:59] animal.
[1:23:01] Just just bring that up really really
[1:23:03] quick.
[1:23:09] It says notice he is not an animal.
[1:23:12] So this lion of the tribe of Judah Judah
[1:23:15] as well as this when John looked he saw
[1:23:17] a lamb. This is not an animal. This is
[1:23:19] this is Christ, right? He's not an
[1:23:22] animal. He he took the book out of the
[1:23:25] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:23:26] throne. Who was it? The owner, the
[1:23:30] original owner that had the book of
[1:23:32] redemption
[1:23:34] in his right hand. And no angel. See,
[1:23:37] angel couldn't die for you. A angel a a
[1:23:42] angel is a ministering spirit that comes
[1:23:44] and gives you, you know, different
[1:23:45] messages and things like that. But the
[1:23:46] angel can die. God had to take on flesh.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. In order to die for your sins. Can
[1:23:52] I go a little I mean I I I always like
[1:23:55] to try to share this. It wasn't God just
[1:23:57] sending his son.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; That's that's that we only got part of
[1:24:01] the picture.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; When God so loved the world that he gave
[1:24:04] his only begotten son. You realize how
[1:24:06] God had to have a son,
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; right? I mean, he had to overshadow Mary
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; and and and and we know how children are
[1:24:13] born. It's through the husband and the
[1:24:15] wife coming together and you know and
[1:24:16] and you know and and through that act a
[1:24:19] child can be born. But but this wasn't
[1:24:21] God coming together through a sexual
[1:24:23] act. God, Amen. was was the life that
[1:24:26] was created inside of Mary. All he did
[1:24:29] was bar her womb so he could be begott a
[1:24:32] son.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; But it was God making himself a body.
[1:24:38] Can I put it that way? God made himself
[1:24:41] his own body and he borrowed Mary's womb
[1:24:45] to make that body.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; My God, he borrowed a grave to be buried
[1:24:49] in because he wouldn't need it for long.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; And and I think I read a quote last week
[1:24:57] that when God borrow something from he
[1:24:59] borrowed a boat from Peter
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; the preacher. When God borrow something,
[1:25:03] he always pay you back.
[1:25:08] He borrowed this womb from Mary, but it
[1:25:11] was God creating a body that he could
[1:25:13] dwell in. He can go from spirit form to
[1:25:16] a body form. So, it's not just God
[1:25:17] sending his son. It's God becoming the
[1:25:20] son.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Just think about it. Think about it. If
[1:25:23] you got children
[1:25:25] and you set up a rule, say now so and
[1:25:28] so, um, anybody go across this line is
[1:25:32] going to die. And here I come along and
[1:25:34] you love me so much and I cross the line
[1:25:37] and you done made this rule that anybody
[1:25:39] cross the line and die. Well, brother
[1:25:41] Jack got to die. But you say, "Well, I
[1:25:44] love Brother Jack too much." Um, come
[1:25:47] here, Junior. I want you to die in the
[1:25:50] place of Brother Jack. Now, if I was
[1:25:51] Junior,
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; I I heard you make that rule.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; You the one say if anybody cross that
[1:25:57] line, they got to die. Since I heard you
[1:26:00] say, I stayed on this side of the line.
[1:26:03] I didn't want to die.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; And now you're going to make me die for
[1:26:06] Jack.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Who is Jack?
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Me die for him. No. No. No. No. No. If
[1:26:15] you want to be just,
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; you don't make me die for his sin. If
[1:26:21] you made that rule and you feel so sorry
[1:26:23] for Jack,
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; the the best way to settle this
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; is you need to die for Jack.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Not don't send me to die for Jack. You
[1:26:35] need to die for Jack. And that's exactly
[1:26:38] what happened. God became flesh so that
[1:26:41] he could die
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; for every sin that we ever ever
[1:26:48] committed. God became flesh so that he
[1:26:50] could die. It wasn't just God sending
[1:26:52] the son. It's God becoming the son.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Look at this.
[1:27:02] The owner, the original owner that had
[1:27:04] the book of redemption in his right hand
[1:27:06] and no angel, no angelic being, nothing
[1:27:09] else could take take the place. And this
[1:27:11] bloody lamb walked out and took the book
[1:27:14] out of his hand. Now, he wasn't an
[1:27:16] animal.
[1:27:18] It wasn't an animal. This was all
[1:27:20] symbolic. When you're reading the book
[1:27:21] of Revelation, you got to see all the
[1:27:22] symbols. But this was Christ. The Bible
[1:27:25] says that he was he was slain before the
[1:27:27] foundation of the world.
[1:27:31] Look at this.
[1:27:33] It says in and this bloody lamb walked
[1:27:35] out and and took the book out of his
[1:27:38] hand. What was it, brother? This is the
[1:27:40] most sublime thing in the scripture. A
[1:27:43] act that not an angel, not nothing could
[1:27:46] do it. And the lamb come and took it
[1:27:48] from the right hand of him that sat upon
[1:27:50] the throne. What is it now? It belongs
[1:27:54] to the lamb. Amen.
[1:27:57] Now,
[1:28:02] yeah, let me just pause. I I'll come
[1:28:04] back to verse 13 in a second, but let me
[1:28:08] go back now because we we read there in
[1:28:12] uh the book of Joshua chapter 15 and the
[1:28:16] the the
[1:28:33] I think I need to just bring it up
[1:28:34] because I want you to catch all of this.
[1:28:37] I'll refer to it. I I I know where I'm
[1:28:40] going, but you don't know where I'm
[1:28:41] going.
[1:28:45] Let's go back to Joshua 15. This is our
[1:28:48] our our scripture. Now, I told you at
[1:28:50] the beginning, notice this is the land
[1:28:53] of Judah. Uh verse 13, this is the the
[1:28:55] the tribe of Judah that is receiving
[1:28:58] their inheritance.
[1:29:00] This whole story happens with the tribe
[1:29:02] of Judah. And I just read for you that
[1:29:04] it was the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:29:08] that was able and the only one able to
[1:29:12] take the book out of the original owner.
[1:29:15] So look at this story how these
[1:29:16] intertwine what happens in Revelation
[1:29:19] connected here to the book of Joshua.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; My God. And here they were in dividing
[1:29:25] the land. Uh Judah is getting their
[1:29:27] their their inheritance. uh Caleb I mean
[1:29:30] Joshua was divided and given an
[1:29:31] inheritance and then it says in verse
[1:29:33] verse 13 and unto Caleb the son of Jeffa
[1:29:36] he gave a part
[1:29:39] among the children of Judah according to
[1:29:42] the commandment of the Lord to Joshua
[1:29:44] even the city of Arba
[1:29:47] the father of Anoch which city uh which
[1:29:49] city is he now that's a that was a very
[1:29:53] important city uh I know that uh uh
[1:29:56] Abraham was buried there uh Sarah was
[1:29:59] buried there. Uh uh Joseph's bones was
[1:30:02] there at Hebron. And this was important
[1:30:04] because during the resurrection when
[1:30:06] Jesus first rose again, the saints rose
[1:30:08] from the grave. Those that were buried
[1:30:10] in this area, they are the ones that
[1:30:11] rose from the grave. It was important to
[1:30:13] be buried at Hebron,
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; right? They didn't they didn't know
[1:30:16] that. But uh but it it it it really it
[1:30:19] was very significant in God's economy,
[1:30:22] right? Verse verse 14. And Caleb drove
[1:30:25] Vince
[1:30:27] uh the the sons of Anoch, Shish, Shishi,
[1:30:30] and uh Aiman and Tam um uh Town, the
[1:30:34] children of Anoch. And he went up then
[1:30:39] to the inhabitants of Deir.
[1:30:42] Praise God. Uh and the name of Deir
[1:30:46] before was Kurj Sephir.
[1:30:51] Now why would the scripture say the name
[1:30:54] before was Kurjaf Sephir? Because names
[1:30:58] have a meaning
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; and you know the name Kjaf Cifir
[1:31:04] actually means city of the book.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; So when he says who will take Kjaf
[1:31:12] Sephir he's actually asking who will
[1:31:16] take the book.
[1:31:21] Let's go a little further.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; It says, "And Caleb said, he that
[1:31:29] smiteth Kerjaf Sephir and taketh it to
[1:31:33] him will I give Axa my daughter to
[1:31:36] wife." So now if you take the book then
[1:31:41] the reward is that you get his daughter
[1:31:44] as a wife
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; and and not not just not just not just
[1:31:49] his daughter but my daughter Axa.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; I don't know how many other kids Caleb
[1:31:54] had but my daughter Axa your name is
[1:31:57] important.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Because her name actually meant adorned.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; The bride has made herself ready. She's
[1:32:06] adorned. Right. It meant adorn and also
[1:32:08] meant the bring the the bursting of the
[1:32:11] veil.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Let us read a little quote right here
[1:32:14] for you. Uh so I can just kind of tie
[1:32:17] these together. This out of the breach
[1:32:19] and um let's see here.
[1:32:23] Um I don't know if if I got the seals
[1:32:26] was broke or in the last church age to
[1:32:29] reveal the truth. Something like that
[1:32:30] you might find. Okay, that's where I'm
[1:32:32] going. Now look at this because John saw
[1:32:35] in Revelation five the lamb or the lion
[1:32:39] of the tribe of Jud. He turned and saw a
[1:32:41] lamb and the lamb took the book and he
[1:32:43] tore off the seals. But in tearing off
[1:32:45] the seals, what is he getting? He's
[1:32:47] getting the bride. Hallelujah.
[1:32:50] Hallelujah. He knew your name was in
[1:32:52] that book,
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; that book of redemption. And by
[1:32:56] revealing his word to you, he's actually
[1:32:58] calling his bride to him. Look at what
[1:33:00] the prophet says here in the breach
[1:33:02] between the seven church agents and the
[1:33:04] seven seals. He says the seals was
[1:33:07] broke. He says why in the last church
[1:33:09] age to reveal these truths why the lamb
[1:33:12] broke the seals and revealed them to his
[1:33:15] church in order to collect his subjects
[1:33:18] for his kingdom, his bride. By revealing
[1:33:21] the seals, he's collecting his subjects.
[1:33:23] Look at that. Not just the seals, but
[1:33:25] every every mystery that God had tied up
[1:33:27] in him. All those mysteries have now
[1:33:29] been made known to the church and we can
[1:33:31] fellowship around the full word of God
[1:33:33] from Genesis to Revelation. We don't
[1:33:35] have to be afraid to preach it because
[1:33:36] it has been revealed. Yes, sir.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; A lot of churches nowadays, they won't
[1:33:40] even touch the book of Revelation and
[1:33:42] they ain't got nothing to say but just
[1:33:44] he'll wipe my tears from my eyes. That's
[1:33:46] all it is. It's so much more in here.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; But now we have understanding of these
[1:33:51] things because God sent us a prophet.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the prophet's job to
[1:33:56] reveal the word of God to the people.
[1:33:58] And not only God sent you a prophet, he
[1:34:00] sent you a prophet with a seventh grade
[1:34:01] education.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; To make it real easy for you,
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; he says, "Look, the lamb broke the seals
[1:34:08] and revealed them to his church in order
[1:34:10] to collect his subjects for his kingdom,
[1:34:12] his bride. See, oh my, he wants to bring
[1:34:15] his subjects to him." Now, what is it?
[1:34:18] Out of the dust of the earth, out of the
[1:34:20] bottom of the sea, out of the pits, out
[1:34:22] of everywhere in every place, out of the
[1:34:24] regions of the dark, out of the par out
[1:34:26] of paradise, wherever they may be, he
[1:34:30] will call. They'll answer. Amen. He will
[1:34:32] call and they will answer. How does he
[1:34:35] call? He calls through his word.
[1:34:40] You see, many of us are sitting here in
[1:34:43] this church today because we were
[1:34:45] wherever we were. We might have went to
[1:34:47] a service. I remember brother Smiley's
[1:34:48] testimony. He was just working in the
[1:34:50] church and he listening to them brothers
[1:34:52] talk. All they was doing fellowship. And
[1:34:54] these weren't even the preachers in the
[1:34:55] church. These were just brothers in the
[1:34:57] church talking. Sometimes people can be
[1:34:59] around our sisters and they'd be like,
[1:35:02] "You must be a preacher." No, I'm not.
[1:35:06] But I just got a revelation of the word,
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; right? And and because we have an
[1:35:11] understanding of the word, we sound so
[1:35:13] different from everybody. It's because
[1:35:15] we're feasting off of an open book.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; What we heard this word and when we
[1:35:22] heard the word, it struck something on
[1:35:24] the inside and we saying that ain't
[1:35:26] nothing but the truth.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; When I heard about what happened in the
[1:35:30] Garden of Eden,
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; they first told me it was an apple. She
[1:35:35] ate an apple. She ate an apple and
[1:35:38] something to me mean like
[1:35:42] that don't I mean I'm a lad and that
[1:35:45] didn't make sense. She ate an apple. We
[1:35:48] got in all this trouble.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; People start dying and from eating an
[1:35:52] apple.
[1:35:54] No, this don't sound right. This don't
[1:35:57] sound right. But then I heard that no,
[1:35:59] it wasn't apple. It was adultery that
[1:36:02] happened in the Garden of Eden. because
[1:36:04] that's how she had a child. You don't
[1:36:06] eat apples and have children.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; You know that. You don't eat apricots
[1:36:10] and have children. It's through a sexual
[1:36:12] act that you have children.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; So, it had to if if it's a sexual act
[1:36:16] today, it had to be a sexual act back
[1:36:19] then.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when I was adultery, I
[1:36:22] mean, and and and so then we had to
[1:36:24] understand, well, who was this serpent?
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Because the way we think of a serpent is
[1:36:28] just something on the ground like this.
[1:36:31] But before he got to the ground, he
[1:36:33] stood on two feet.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was cursed in the in the
[1:36:38] book of Genesis and he lost his ability
[1:36:40] to stand on them two feet. That's when
[1:36:42] he went down on the ground.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; But before that, he stood on two feet
[1:36:45] and he was half man, half animal
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; without a soul.
[1:36:52] Right?
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; And Satan was able to use that
[1:36:56] animal to commit a sexual act with Eve
[1:37:00] that she introduced to Adam.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Adam was not deceived. Eve was
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; But you know that was all for a purpose.
[1:37:10] God don't do nothing without no purpose.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Even when he created Eve from Adam, she
[1:37:16] was the only thing that was not a part
[1:37:18] of the original creation. She was made
[1:37:20] from something that was already created.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; God knew that she would have a weakness.
[1:37:25] But in that weakness, he'd be able to
[1:37:27] express every attribute that he ever had
[1:37:30] locked up in him.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; This is how we get know him as a savior.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; This is how we know him as a redeemer.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, you you know what? You will learn
[1:37:40] things about God
[1:37:42] in your weaknesses.
[1:37:48] I say you're going to learn things about
[1:37:50] God
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; in your weaknesses.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Not when you strong, it's when you get
[1:37:58] weak. That's when you begin to
[1:38:00] understand who he is.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Your relationship goes so much deeper
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; in your weaknesses.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:13] I gota I gota I gotta make some turns
[1:38:15] here. Let me keep reading.
[1:38:21] Uh see
[1:38:24] he come to get his subjects. He revealed
[1:38:26] his secrets and they saw it.
[1:38:30] And time is no more at that time. Time
[1:38:32] has run out. It is finished. Now that's
[1:38:33] Revelation 10 that's being quoted right
[1:38:35] there. You know, because when um uh when
[1:38:39] the seventh angel reveals all the
[1:38:41] mysteries,
[1:38:42] time should be no more. And we're living
[1:38:44] in that time period right now on earth.
[1:38:47] We're living in a time God has sent one
[1:38:49] of his seven spirits, one of his
[1:38:51] messengers into the earth. He's already
[1:38:53] come, given his message, and he's gone.
[1:38:55] Just like Paul came, and he's gone. But
[1:38:58] we're still abiding by the things that
[1:39:00] Paul spoke.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; And we're abiding by the things that
[1:39:03] God's prophet spoke. But notice the
[1:39:05] things that God's prophet spoke are the
[1:39:07] same things Paul spoke
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; because if he said anything different he
[1:39:11] has to be a curse.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; All right. Let us let us let us keep
[1:39:18] moving. He says he leaves the throne to
[1:39:21] be an intercessor as a slain lamb to be
[1:39:24] a lion king to bring the world to
[1:39:26] judgment who has rejected his message.
[1:39:28] He's not a mediator. Remember the Old
[1:39:30] Testament teacher. Now, as we hurry,
[1:39:32] when the blood went off the mercy seat,
[1:39:34] what was it? Judgment seat. And when the
[1:39:36] lamb uh when the lamb slain walked
[1:39:39] forward from eternity out of the
[1:39:40] father's throne and took his and took
[1:39:42] his rights, it was a judgment seat. Then
[1:39:44] he become not a lamb, but a lion
[1:39:49] king. And he calls for his queen to come
[1:39:52] and stand by his side. Know ye not that
[1:39:54] the saints shall judge the earth.
[1:40:00] Now,
[1:40:02] um, when we go back here to Joshua,
[1:40:07] uh, Caleb says there in, uh, what verse
[1:40:11] did I stop at? Uh, verse 16. Caleb said,
[1:40:14] "He that smiteth Kath Sephir,
[1:40:16] and taketh it, to him will I give Axa,
[1:40:20] my daughter to wife." Now, Axa, her name
[1:40:22] meant bursting of the veil. Her name
[1:40:25] also meant adorn. And the name Kjaf Sea
[1:40:29] meant city of the book. So who's gonna
[1:40:32] take the book or the city of the book?
[1:40:36] Who's going to take this city? Notice
[1:40:38] who steps up.
[1:40:41] Verse
[1:40:43] um 17. And
[1:40:47] the son of Kenaz
[1:40:50] the brother of Caleb took it
[1:40:53] and he gave him axe his daughter to
[1:40:55] wife. Everything in the scripture has
[1:40:58] significance. Who?
[1:41:01] Aiel,
[1:41:03] the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb.
[1:41:06] This means it's his nephew,
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; which simply means this is a kinsman
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; redeemer.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; It took a kinsman redeemer to bring us
[1:41:20] back to our place. So here in the
[1:41:22] scripture we see often the L is
[1:41:25] represented as the kinsman redeemer.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my my. Even when they was
[1:41:32] being born and given these names, they
[1:41:34] had no idea what their names would mean
[1:41:37] for people all the way down 4,000 years
[1:41:40] later. Yes, sir.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; 3,000 whatever it is.
[1:41:47] God is perfect, y'all.
[1:41:52] When Christ took the book and he
[1:41:54] revealed the seals, he was also getting
[1:41:58] his bride.
[1:42:00] When
[1:42:02] Anneil took Kerjaf Sephir, he was also
[1:42:06] getting
[1:42:07] his bride.
[1:42:10] Let's go on a little further.
[1:42:23] Oh my. Let me see here. I got something.
[1:42:34] I think I Oh, yes. Yes. I need to I need
[1:42:37] to read this because
[1:42:40] as as ail
[1:42:42] again um getting the bride
[1:42:46] the seals being open to us in this day
[1:42:49] it was a book that was closed the seals
[1:42:51] were seals had it locked up but in
[1:42:54] Revelation 10 let me read that
[1:42:56] revelation 10 and 7 let me read that
[1:42:58] real quick um this is where we know that
[1:43:00] we're living in a time where we we no
[1:43:03] longer have a closed book we have an
[1:43:05] open book because The Bible says it in
[1:43:08] Revelation 10:7,
[1:43:10] "But in the days of the voice of the
[1:43:12] seventh angel, when he shall begin the
[1:43:15] sound, the mystery of God should be
[1:43:17] finished as he hath declared to his
[1:43:19] servants the prophets." Brother Brandon
[1:43:22] before he preached the seven seals uh
[1:43:25] back in 1963
[1:43:28] uh supernaturally God visited him with
[1:43:30] seven angels. those angels formed a
[1:43:32] cloud in the sky and uh it was seven
[1:43:35] angels and you know even I think it was
[1:43:38] Life magazine that recorded you know
[1:43:40] this these angelic beings that were
[1:43:41] there and and um the way that the cloud
[1:43:45] came down in Life magazine the picture
[1:43:46] they had uh they couldn't tell what it
[1:43:49] was
[1:43:51] but a prophet and notice the prophet
[1:43:53] never went to the magazine the prophet
[1:43:56] went to the church
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; because this was not for the the Thank
[1:44:00] you sis
[1:44:01] uh the the prophet, you know, it it came
[1:44:03] down there on the left side that way and
[1:44:05] they and they just had no idea what was
[1:44:07] going on. So, Brother Brandham went to
[1:44:09] the church and say, "Now, turn the
[1:44:10] picture to the right."
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Only the church, only the bride will
[1:44:15] have this understand. Turn the picture
[1:44:16] to the right. And when it turned to the
[1:44:17] right, what they saw was the silhouette
[1:44:19] of Christ
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; with his white wigged hair. According to
[1:44:23] Revelation 1, he's supposed to have a
[1:44:25] white white wig.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. God took this picture
[1:44:31] in 1963 in the skies
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; after this happened. He was commissioned
[1:44:37] by these angels go back to the east and
[1:44:40] begin to preach the seven seals. So now
[1:44:43] we have the revelation of the seven
[1:44:45] seals. What the white horse rider was,
[1:44:48] what the red horse rider was, what the
[1:44:51] black horse rider was, what the pale
[1:44:53] horse rider. And people don't and people
[1:44:54] don't even realize today pale like gray
[1:44:57] like no no no no. A prophet helped us
[1:44:59] see is the white horse, the red horse,
[1:45:03] the black horse, all combined making
[1:45:06] pale.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; He helped us see these things. Now we
[1:45:11] have clarity. I can preach to you out of
[1:45:14] Revelation 6.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; And be certain about what I'm saying.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; My God. Not just Revelation 6. Anything
[1:45:21] in the book, I can preach to you.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; But these are the things we know that
[1:45:25] we're standing on truth.
[1:45:28] Look at this. Let me go a little
[1:45:29] further. Let me go a little further. Um
[1:45:32] here in this in this in the breach
[1:45:34] between the seven church ages and seven
[1:45:35] seals. This is a sermon he preaches
[1:45:38] right before he preaches the seven
[1:45:39] seals. And um I think it's a book a
[1:45:41] mysterious book. Book a mysterious book.
[1:45:44] Put that in. It says now it is a myster.
[1:45:47] It's a book a mysterious book. It's a
[1:45:48] book of redemption. We'll get into that
[1:45:50] in a little while. And now we know that
[1:45:52] this book of redemption will not be
[1:45:54] thoroughly understood. It's probed at
[1:45:55] through six church ages.
[1:45:57] But at the end
[1:46:00] on that seventh plank,
[1:46:02] at the end when the seventh angel begins
[1:46:04] to sound his mystery, he winds up all
[1:46:07] those loose ends and these fellas that
[1:46:09] these fellas probed at. And the
[1:46:11] mysteries, look at this, look at this.
[1:46:12] The mysteries comes down from God
[1:46:16] as the word of God and reveals the
[1:46:20] entire revelation of God. Then the
[1:46:22] Godhead and everything else is settled.
[1:46:25] All the mystery, serpent seed and
[1:46:27] whatever more is to be revealed.
[1:46:31] I I love that. There's another little
[1:46:34] thing that I I I want to just mention to
[1:46:36] you here. Um I'm I'm going to questions
[1:46:39] and answers and then I'm I'm I'm I'm
[1:46:41] winding down.
[1:46:44] You know
[1:46:46] these mysteries coming down from God.
[1:46:51] Lord,
[1:46:55] these mysteries coming down from God.
[1:46:56] They're coming down as the word of God.
[1:46:59] And by coming as the word of God is it's
[1:47:01] drawing us closer to Christ. Now, I
[1:47:04] stopped at Revelation
[1:47:06] um 8.
[1:47:09] I stopped No, Revelation 5. Uh I stopped
[1:47:12] at verse 13. I'm going to go back and
[1:47:14] I'm I'mma read that and then I'm going
[1:47:15] to come to this quote and um questions
[1:47:18] and answers on the seals. Now I I I said
[1:47:21] before that John heard the voice of many
[1:47:25] man. He I mean he
[1:47:27] he heard angels.
[1:47:31] Verse 11 it says I beh I beheld
[1:47:34] Revelation 5:11. And I beheld and I
[1:47:35] heard the voice of many angels round
[1:47:37] about the throne. And this was after the
[1:47:39] lamb took the book. Right? It says uh I
[1:47:41] heard uh the voice of many angels round
[1:47:44] about the throne and the beast and the
[1:47:45] elders and the number of them was 10,000
[1:47:48] times 10,000 and thousand thousand
[1:47:50] saying with a loud voice worthy is the
[1:47:51] lamb that was slain to receive power and
[1:47:53] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:47:55] and glory and blessing. And now look at
[1:47:57] this. Something changed.
[1:48:01] All these people that he hear now every
[1:48:05] creature
[1:48:06] which is in heaven and on earth and
[1:48:10] under the earth and such as are in the
[1:48:14] sea. In in the sea
[1:48:21] he says and all that are in them. What
[1:48:28] heard? I
[1:48:31] mean, wait a minute. He all these people
[1:48:32] would have been drowning join John out.
[1:48:35] How now the whole thing changed where
[1:48:37] they can hear John worshiping.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Look at this. Heard I saying blessing
[1:48:45] and honor and glory and power be unto
[1:48:50] him that siteth upon the throne and unto
[1:48:53] the Lamb forever. and and ever. And the
[1:48:56] four beasts said, "Amen." And the four
[1:48:58] and 20 elders fell down and and
[1:49:01] worshiped him that liveth forever and
[1:49:02] ever. Now, now here John is hearing all
[1:49:04] them worship, but then all of a sudden
[1:49:06] John say they heard me worship.
[1:49:10] How is it that we all everybody can hear
[1:49:12] everybody else worshiping?
[1:49:15] How is it that we can hear these things?
[1:49:17] It's because I realize you got the same
[1:49:19] revelation that I got.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; God is giving you the same understanding
[1:49:24] I got. him. We join together in worship.
[1:49:27] I I I think I think even David said,
[1:49:29] "Oh, magnify the Lord with me and let us
[1:49:33] exalt his name together."
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Now, what was it that caused John to go
[1:49:38] into this condition?
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham tells us it's because
[1:49:44] John
[1:49:45] saw his name
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; in the book.
[1:49:51] That's it.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just read this quote of how
[1:49:54] you see your name in the book.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; That's why I got to set this up.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; The question is now, Brother Brandham,
[1:50:05] is it true that every Jew born since
[1:50:07] Christ came will be saved? And who are
[1:50:09] 144,000? Are they predestined ones to be
[1:50:12] sealed with the Holy Ghost? And what is
[1:50:14] their mission? They got all kind of
[1:50:15] questions.
[1:50:17] He said there's about three questions in
[1:50:18] one there. says first one is um uh is it
[1:50:22] true that every Jew born since Christ
[1:50:24] that came into the world is to be saved?
[1:50:26] No. Nothing will be saved. Only those
[1:50:28] names
[1:50:30] who were put on the lamb's book of life
[1:50:33] before the foundation of the world, Jew
[1:50:36] or Gentile. So see this book had those
[1:50:39] names in it and those are the only ones
[1:50:42] that he came to die for. No, let me just
[1:50:44] be honest with you. For God so loved
[1:50:46] that he God God so loved the world that
[1:50:49] he gave his only begotten son. Which
[1:50:51] world did he love?
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; You know, all of us are sitting here,
[1:50:56] but we all live in different worlds.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; And what kind of causes our worlds to
[1:51:00] unite is when we come underneath
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; this roof and we worship together, but
[1:51:04] we all got different worlds. Look, the
[1:51:06] the man the the bum on the street is
[1:51:07] living in a different world than what
[1:51:08] you're living in.
[1:51:11] Uh there are some people in other
[1:51:13] nations, they call them third world
[1:51:15] nations. They live in different
[1:51:17] conditions to what you live in.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I mean, you boy, you
[1:51:21] let you you let you be done paid your
[1:51:23] bill and FPL done turned off your
[1:51:25] lights. You got rights.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; You going to go and get somebody on the
[1:51:29] phone and and you going to show them
[1:51:30] your receipt. I did this. You don't you
[1:51:32] don't you you won't take no for an
[1:51:34] answer.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; But you go to Zimbabwe.
[1:51:37] Hallelujah. And half half the day you
[1:51:40] might have lights and the other half day
[1:51:42] no lights. They notify you when your
[1:51:44] lights going to be on even if you paid
[1:51:47] your bill.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; But that's the way they live. And and
[1:51:51] you better not go over there and
[1:51:52] complain. I mean we got over there water
[1:51:54] going to run at this time. Well, what
[1:51:56] about I want to take a shower now. No,
[1:51:58] you don't take a shower at that time.
[1:52:00] You better put some uh water in a bucket
[1:52:01] at that time. But the water going to be
[1:52:03] run at the house at this time. And it's
[1:52:06] very common for the people to live like
[1:52:07] that.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; I went to Ghana one time and and I knew,
[1:52:11] you know, things are different. I went
[1:52:13] there and Lord, let me I'm winding down.
[1:52:15] But when um I got there and I saw a big
[1:52:18] old five gallon bucket in in in in the
[1:52:20] in the uh my room, me and my wife said,
[1:52:23] "Well,
[1:52:26] we're only going to be here for a few
[1:52:27] days, dear. Just we know what to do with
[1:52:29] the bucket. That's how you flush the
[1:52:31] toilet. And that's how you take a take a
[1:52:33] a wash up with this bucket. And we just
[1:52:36] going through and going through and and
[1:52:38] we ain't say nothing. Three or four days
[1:52:39] go by. Pastor say, "How how everything
[1:52:42] going?" I say, "Everything going?" Said,
[1:52:43] "We just need that bucket refilled in
[1:52:45] our room." He said, "Bucket?"
[1:52:48] I said, "Yeah." He said, "Oh, they
[1:52:51] forgot to turn the water on in your
[1:52:52] room." I said, "I didn't know they were
[1:52:54] supposed to turn the water on in. I just
[1:52:55] thought this the way it was."
[1:52:59] Sometimes it be that way, you see. And
[1:53:02] and but we all living in different
[1:53:03] worlds. And I can tell you the world
[1:53:05] that Jesus died for was the ones that he
[1:53:07] knew were in that book.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't even give my life for people
[1:53:12] that I know weren't going to receive it.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. You wouldn't do it
[1:53:18] either. God is a lot smarter than us.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; He didn't just give his life for people
[1:53:22] that weren't going to receive it. He The
[1:53:24] world that he talk about is the ones
[1:53:25] that was in that book.
[1:53:28] Amen.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Let me let me let me I got to I got to
[1:53:31] finish this. Um it says this, nothing
[1:53:35] will be received. Only those names who
[1:53:37] were put in the lamb's book of life
[1:53:38] before the foundation world, Jew or
[1:53:40] Gentile. See, that's all the book holds
[1:53:42] that mystery. And the book is only
[1:53:44] unfolding it now. It says not each one's
[1:53:48] name. So it it don't have
[1:53:52] Jackie Edwin Duff
[1:53:54] or whatever your full name is, your
[1:53:57] government name. It don't have that in
[1:54:00] the book.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Let's go on a little further.
[1:54:04] Not each one's name, but what the
[1:54:07] mystery of the book is while it's
[1:54:09] calling those names. So you find you
[1:54:12] understand that now. See, he says the
[1:54:14] book doesn't say now Lee Vale is to be
[1:54:17] saved in the time of this church age or
[1:54:19] or Neville or whatever. No, it don't say
[1:54:22] that. It just shows the mystery,
[1:54:26] unfolds the mystery of what the thing
[1:54:28] is. But we ourselves by faith believe
[1:54:30] it. And when we by faith believe it, we
[1:54:33] hear and we see our name in the book.
[1:54:38] Yes, sir.
[1:54:39] It's because you can identify with the
[1:54:42] mystery of that book. You see your name
[1:54:45] in the book
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; and that's how your name is called.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; It's called by revelation.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Let me go back to
[1:54:56] um Joshua. Finish up just this last
[1:54:58] little verse here. Joshua 15. And then I
[1:55:02] got one more quote and I'll be done.
[1:55:07] Now
[1:55:10] verse 17 says, "And Athen
[1:55:14] the son of Kenaz
[1:55:16] the brother of Caleb took it and he gave
[1:55:19] him Oxa his daughter to wife." And
[1:55:24] remember Oxa actually means adorned.
[1:55:27] And um
[1:55:30] let me catch this.
[1:55:34] and she was a type of the bride.
[1:55:37] Uh but here we see uh Oxa being a type
[1:55:41] of the bride.
[1:55:43] Verse 18, and it came to pass
[1:55:49] as she came unto him that she moved him
[1:55:54] to ask of her father a field. And now
[1:55:58] she know what that what her daddy got.
[1:55:59] Aan, now I know you got I know I I know
[1:56:02] I'm the reward, but
[1:56:05] it's more to this.
[1:56:08] Ask my daddy.
[1:56:11] Ask my daddy. Not just I mean cuz he's
[1:56:13] telling you what he going to give you.
[1:56:14] But now you need to ask him for
[1:56:16] something cuz you done went out there
[1:56:17] and you done defeated you know these
[1:56:19] giants. So you need to ask that right
[1:56:21] now he is in a giving mood.
[1:56:28] Yes sir.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Oxa understood that you got to know your
[1:56:31] seasons
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; here. It says in Caleb as she as she
[1:56:37] came to him she said that she moved him
[1:56:38] to ask her father a field and she
[1:56:41] lighted off her ass and Caleb said to
[1:56:42] her what is thou now and she was moving
[1:56:45] quick. She ain't want this time to get
[1:56:48] by too fast. Don't wait till tomorrow.
[1:56:49] You better move now and get this. It's
[1:56:52] like the angel trouble in the water now.
[1:56:54] Jump in now.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Right. Look at this. Now watch what
[1:56:57] happened. It says, "What what wouldest
[1:57:00] thou who answered, give me a blessing,
[1:57:06] for thou has given me a south land, and
[1:57:08] daddy, I'm grateful for that, but give
[1:57:11] me also springs of water." And I like
[1:57:14] this. And he gave her the upper springs
[1:57:18] and the nether springs.
[1:57:21] You see
[1:57:25] the upper springs
[1:57:27] represent the blessings that come from
[1:57:28] above. He sent down these revelations to
[1:57:31] us. And brother Brandham say if
[1:57:33] revelations beyond you look up and ask
[1:57:36] God for it. So revelation comes down
[1:57:38] from God to the people of God. These are
[1:57:40] blessings that are coming from the upper
[1:57:42] springs. When the Holy Spirit is falling
[1:57:43] all over the church, these are blessings
[1:57:45] coming from the upper springs. We thank
[1:57:47] God for blessings from the upper
[1:57:49] springs. Yes, sir.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; You can't live without blessings from
[1:57:52] the upper springs.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; But you can live a million miles beneath
[1:57:57] your privileges if you don't ask for
[1:57:59] these blessings in the Nether Springs.
[1:58:03] And the blessings in the Nether Springs
[1:58:04] are the blessings that we receive while
[1:58:06] we live here on earth.
[1:58:11] We ask for revelation of all God's
[1:58:13] mysteries because the church lives off
[1:58:14] revelation. It's with true revelation in
[1:58:16] our lives that the gates of hell cannot
[1:58:18] prevail against us, but we will prevail
[1:58:20] over them. But also, we want these
[1:58:22] blessings. Amen. My God, from these
[1:58:25] nether springs. Let me let me let me let
[1:58:28] me read this. This is coming out of
[1:58:34] here ye him.
[1:58:36] And musicians, y'all can prepare
[1:58:38] yourselves to come on back. I'mma read
[1:58:40] this and I will depart.
[1:58:44] Brother Random says this,
[1:58:48] "Don't never be afraid."
[1:58:51] Now, now why he use the word afraid? You
[1:58:54] know what? Some of us even doubt
[1:58:57] what we asking God for.
[1:59:01] Like he can't do it.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Do he have it or not? If daddy got it,
[1:59:06] ask him.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; I I I I I I remember one time I told
[1:59:10] him, "I need $10,000, Lord. I need it.
[1:59:16] I need $10,000
[1:59:22] and I needed it.
[1:59:27] And I didn't know where I was going
[1:59:29] where the money was coming from. I had
[1:59:30] no idea where I need $10,000. And
[1:59:33] somebody happened to call me and say,
[1:59:34] you know, uh you got some money sitting
[1:59:36] right here and you didn't even know you
[1:59:38] had money over there. I'm like I said,
[1:59:40] how much is it? Uh, you got money on
[1:59:42] this policy, on this policy, on this
[1:59:43] polic. I said, "How much do I have?"
[1:59:45] They add it all up. It was just about
[1:59:46] $10,000. I think a little over. I didn't
[1:59:50] even know I had it. God got money for
[1:59:52] you.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. I'm I'm I'm stepping into some
[1:59:55] things. But look, I I I I know a brother
[1:59:59] recently. I was listening to some
[2:00:02] videos. The brother said he told the
[2:00:03] Lord, "I need cash."
[2:00:07] That mean he had his bills paid. All
[2:00:10] that. That's good. But Lord, I need just
[2:00:12] some cash. I need a little extra money
[2:00:15] just to kind of sit on.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Anybody need a little of that?
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Ju just to kind of sit on. Father, I And
[2:00:23] he he he prayed a very specific say,
[2:00:25] "Lord, I need cash." When I heard him
[2:00:28] say that he told the Lord he need cash
[2:00:30] and God provided the cash for him. You
[2:00:33] know what I said?
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:00:41] I'm not ashamed, Lord. I need cash.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; I thank you for meeting my needs, but I
[2:00:48] need cash. I need some extra cash that I
[2:00:52] can have in my account. I'm not talking
[2:00:54] about tens and 20s and 30s. I'm talking
[2:00:57] about thousands.
[2:01:00] Thousands. I need cash.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:05] I say you provided 10,000 for me before,
[2:01:07] you can give me 50,000 now.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; I need cash.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And you got to know when to
[2:01:16] ask.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; I mean, hey, ask a new you and ask her
[2:01:22] ask her ask
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; ask.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; It's in her name. That's right.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Ask.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Y'all better ask God.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Ask it shall be given. God, I need cash.
[2:01:42] I don't know how you're going to get it
[2:01:43] to me, but I need cash.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I I need business. I need
[2:01:49] this. I need that. God, I need it.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. That's it, sis.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Man, I'mma tell you, um, sometime I I
[2:02:00] get to asking and I I be asking too
[2:02:02] little. That's right.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; I I be asking to it's just just enough
[2:02:06] to get by here. No, no, no, no. Like
[2:02:08] brother Jean said, I don't just need
[2:02:10] enough gas money to get the church.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; I need to get back home. I need to go to
[2:02:14] work next week. You already thought all
[2:02:16] that out. Lord, I need all that met.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. All right. It's
[2:02:24] telling me that I got to uh shut down.
[2:02:29] Okay. This last quote. He says, "Don't
[2:02:32] never be afraid to ask big things." God
[2:02:34] wants you to ask big things. He don't
[2:02:38] want you to be little, petty, and
[2:02:40] juvenile. He wants you ask big things
[2:02:44] that your joys
[2:02:46] may be full. $50,000 will make my joys
[2:02:49] full, God.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Not that my bank account will be full,
[2:02:52] too. Amen.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine a little fish about
[2:03:00] that big way out yonder in the Atlantic
[2:03:01] Ocean say, "I better drink just a little
[2:03:04] bit of this water. I might run out."
[2:03:06] That's nonsense.
[2:03:08] Could you imagine a little mouse about
[2:03:10] that big down there in the great garden
[2:03:12] of Eden saying, "I just better eat two
[2:03:14] grains a day cuz I might run out before
[2:03:16] summertime again." That's nonsense.
[2:03:20] If they had 1000,000
[2:03:23] rats that size, they'd never eat it up.
[2:03:27] And they had billions times billions of
[2:03:29] tons of them fish, they'd never drink
[2:03:31] the water up. How many times we could
[2:03:33] multiply?
[2:03:35] You could never I'm talking about the
[2:03:37] needs that you have right now and the
[2:03:39] needs you're going to have next year and
[2:03:42] the needs you're going to have the year
[2:03:43] after that. You could never
[2:03:46] exhaust God
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; in his powers and his mercies to his
[2:03:51] children. He is inexhaustible.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; He's the inexhaustible fountain of life.
[2:03:57] Just drink and drink
[2:04:01] and drink
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; and drink. I drunk last year, but I'm
[2:04:06] back again.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; And I might be back next year.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; The reason I'm coming cuz I know you got
[2:04:12] it. Amen.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; You better get off your animal real
[2:04:17] quick.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Ask daddy cuz look man, this man is
[2:04:20] taking taking her away. Go into his own
[2:04:22] house. He's married. He's taking his
[2:04:24] wife away. And she's like, "No, no, no,
[2:04:26] no. Before I go.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; I mean, I know you excited, but I want
[2:04:30] some blessings.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; I want some blessing.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; I want me a blessing." And and and and
[2:04:37] now and you say, "You gave me some soft
[2:04:40] land, but I need some springs.
[2:04:42] Now, she didn't even request what
[2:04:44] springs, but Caleb gave her.

[2:05:33] It's Christ that took the book. and he
[2:05:36] represented the whole thing in the story
[2:05:38] of Aanil and Axa and Caleb. God is
[2:05:44] amazing.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Father, we thank you for
[2:05:49] your word.
[2:05:51] Thank you for your truth that has been
[2:05:53] given to us.
[2:05:57] How grateful we are, Lord.
[2:06:00] And Lord, we come with our faith
[2:06:02] elevated to ask you, Father, for
[2:06:07] we ask you for the impossible, things
[2:06:08] that may look impossible, may seem
[2:06:10] impossible, but with our God, there is
[2:06:13] nothing too hard. We ask you for healing
[2:06:15] in our bodies.
[2:06:17] We ask you for deliverance in our
[2:06:19] families. We ask you, Lord, for every
[2:06:22] need that we have financially being met
[2:06:24] and that you would do the exceeding, the
[2:06:25] abundant above all we can ask or think.
[2:06:29] We ask you for cash,
[2:06:31] Lord. We ask you because we know you got
[2:06:33] it. And Father, we just trust, Lord
[2:06:36] Jesus, that uh Lord, these words won't
[2:06:39] just be something that goes in one ear
[2:06:40] and out the other, but Lord, it'll
[2:06:41] become a manifestation in our lives.
[2:06:45] Thank you, Lord, that you could reveal
[2:06:46] your truth. And as these mysteries are
[2:06:49] coming down,
[2:06:51] you're calling your bride. Thank you,
[2:06:54] Lord, that you would call us, that you
[2:06:56] would have enough confidence in us that
[2:06:58] you'd know that we'd respond to your
[2:07:00] truth, you would speak,
[2:07:03] and we would say, "Amen."
[2:07:06] May we stand like John who Lord, when he
[2:07:10] saw his name, God had caused him to join
[2:07:13] in the worship and the adoration uh to
[2:07:15] the lamb who who who was slain and took
[2:07:18] the book. And he's worthy to be praised.
[2:07:22] and we recognize Lord who we are.
[2:07:25] I trust oh God that Lord as we prepare
[2:07:28] just to leave uh on this journey Lord to
[2:07:31] uh Australia we've been given this
[2:07:34] opportunity Lord to preach the gospel
[2:07:35] and you told us in your word go into all
[2:07:38] the world
[2:07:40] and to preach the gospel. You said these
[2:07:42] signs shall follow them that believe.
[2:07:44] Lord may you go before and may you bless
[2:07:46] Lord the journey all the saints that are
[2:07:48] be going. We bind the hands of the enemy
[2:07:51] that would try to come against us in any
[2:07:52] way and hinder our trip Lord. Whether
[2:07:54] it's through a sickness, whether it's
[2:07:56] through an accident, whether it's
[2:07:57] through uh something with the planes, we
[2:08:00] bind the devil right now in the name of
[2:08:02] Jesus. And we ask Lord that you would
[2:08:04] make our trip prosperous. And while we
[2:08:07] are away, may you watch over Spirit and
[2:08:09] Truth Tabernacle. Lord, bless the
[2:08:12] saints, Lord, the ministers that'll be
[2:08:13] coming forth uh during this time while
[2:08:15] we're away. Lord, bless each one,
[2:08:17] Father, in their uh respective places.
[2:08:19] Give them, Father, the words to speak to
[2:08:21] your people. Anoint them aresh, oh God,
[2:08:23] is our prayer. And Lord, we're just
[2:08:25] careful to give you all the honor and
[2:08:27] all the glory and all the praise because
[2:08:28] you deserve it. It's in Jesus name
[2:08:33] we pray. Amen.

[2:08:59] I call.
[2:09:05] I have
[2:09:07] a maker.
[2:09:14] He formed
[2:09:17] my heart.
[2:09:23] Before
[2:09:25] even time began,
[2:09:30] my life was in
[2:09:34] his hands. Come on, will you stand with
[2:09:37] me?
[2:09:40] He knows
[2:09:42] my name.
[2:09:46] Oh,
[2:09:49] he knows
[2:09:51] my every
[2:09:53] thought.
[2:09:55] And he sees He sees
[2:09:59] each tear
[2:10:01] that falls
[2:10:04] and he hears me when
[2:10:08] I call.
[2:10:10] I'll say it again. Say, "He knows.
[2:10:14] He knows
[2:10:16] my name."
[2:10:20] Yes, he does. He knows
[2:10:25] my every
[2:10:27] thought.
[2:10:29] And he sees
[2:10:33] each tear
[2:10:36] that's false
[2:10:38] and he hears me well.
[2:10:42] I call. Come on, one more time. Say, he
[2:10:46] knows.
[2:10:53] And he knows
[2:10:58] my every thought.

[2:11:31] I call.
[2:11:37] Praise the Lord.
[2:11:42] Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads.
[2:11:45] Heavenly Father,
[2:11:48] we bow before you, our God and our King.
[2:11:50] Lord, we're grateful for the word that
[2:11:52] you have delivered to us, Lord.
[2:11:55] Father, we're so grateful that our ears
[2:11:57] can hear these things and our hearts can
[2:11:59] believe it.
[2:12:00] Father, thank you, Lord, for blessing
[2:12:02] our pastor and giving us this message,
[2:12:04] Lord. As he was preaching, I was
[2:12:07] thinking on the things that you've
[2:12:08] preached before, Lord,
[2:12:11] revealing to us that this is a time of
[2:12:13] restoration, Lord, and that we are
[2:12:15] supposed to be living in overflow.
[2:12:18] But you gave us a word, Lord Jesus. Not
[2:12:20] a word just to me or not a word just to
[2:12:22] Brother Jack, but to Spirit and Truth
[2:12:24] Tabernacle.
[2:12:26] Open your mouths wide and I'll fill it.
[2:12:30] Father, sometimes we don't ask, Lord,
[2:12:32] because we we believe that you you won't
[2:12:36] supply it, Father. That's not the
[2:12:39] attitude of believers. when we know that
[2:12:42] you have what we have need of, Lord
[2:12:44] Jesus. Father, we ought to believe you
[2:12:47] for big things. Father, you're not just
[2:12:49] a God that just gives. You give more
[2:12:51] than enough, Lord Jesus.
[2:12:54] Father, you took two fish and five
[2:12:56] loaves and fed thousands. Lord, that was
[2:12:59] more than enough, Lord. They had
[2:13:01] leftovers, Father. That's what we need,
[2:13:03] Lord. We need overflow, Lord.
[2:13:07] Father, we're not just asking that you
[2:13:09] give to us, Lord. that we may put money
[2:13:12] in our bank account. Lord, we want to be
[2:13:14] a conduit, Lord, where money comes in
[2:13:16] and goes out to others and money comes
[2:13:18] in and goes out to others, Lord. We have
[2:13:21] brothers and sisters, Lord, that may not
[2:13:23] have the faith, Lord, to ask. May not
[2:13:26] have the faith that'll believe you,
[2:13:27] Lord, for the things that they have need
[2:13:29] of, Lord, but you can answer through us,
[2:13:31] Lord. Father, we want to be be blessed
[2:13:34] so that we can be a blessing.
[2:13:37] Father, I'm not just asking for
[2:13:39] thousands. make me a millionaire, Lord.
[2:13:43] Father, when the saints come from other
[2:13:44] countries, Lord, their needs should be
[2:13:46] met, Lord. We should have the ability to
[2:13:49] provide for them, Lord. Father, we have
[2:13:52] a building down the street, Lord, that
[2:13:54] we're looking at, Lord Jesus. We want
[2:13:56] that building, Lord, without debt. We
[2:13:59] don't want to owe a thing on it, Lord
[2:14:00] Jesus. We want it completely taken care
[2:14:03] of. Father, we're asking you because we
[2:14:05] know that you can give it.
[2:14:10] So, Father, we believe we receive what
[2:14:12] we ask for. Bless these people, Lord.
[2:14:15] Give us the wisdom to know how to manage
[2:14:19] what you give us, Lord.
[2:14:21] Father, that we can retain it, Lord, and
[2:14:23] not that our blessings may come to an
[2:14:25] end. Bless your people in a special way
[2:14:28] with wisdom and knowledge, Lord. Money
[2:14:31] management skills, Lord, that we may do
[2:14:33] the right thing with what you give us.
[2:14:35] You have molded us throughout the years,
[2:14:37] Lord. You have worked it on our
[2:14:39] character that we can handle the
[2:14:41] blessings. Now use us, Father, is our
[2:14:44] prayer. Father, again, be with the
[2:14:46] saints as they travel to and from
[2:14:48] Australia. Lord, bless their time there.
[2:14:50] Bless the saints here that remain, Lord,
[2:14:52] as we stay at our post of duty, Lord.
[2:14:55] Father, we want to be faithful in all
[2:14:57] things. Bless us as we leave this place,
[2:15:00] Lord Jesus. And may we walk into the
[2:15:02] prosperity that you have prepared for
[2:15:04] us. This we ask in the name of Jesus
[2:15:06] Christ, our Lord and Savior. Amen. Amen.
[2:15:10] God bless you saints. You may have your
[2:15:12] seats and our brothers will come at this
[2:15:14] time to dismiss you. Amen.
[2:15:21] Heat. Heat.
[2:15:48] Heat. Heat.
