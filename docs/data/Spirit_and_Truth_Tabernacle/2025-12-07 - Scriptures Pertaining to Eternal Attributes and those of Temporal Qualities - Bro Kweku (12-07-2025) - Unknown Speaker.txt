Wednesday night after service, we were all outside uh communing a little bit, having fellowship with one another. I was talking with brother Maris and brother Jerry and we was just talking about trials and trials come. We were talking about you need to count it all joy when the trials come according to the scripture. And sometimes you just got to get quiet and be still and see what the Lord is doing because all things are working out for your good. So after we finish fellowshipping, we get ready to jump in the car and the starter went up. So the brothers came and gathered around the car. We were trying to jump it off and we realized you're hearing the clicking and everything that it is the starter. So as the brother was brothers were moving, we were all moving. Something kept telling me just pray and I just kept moving. He told me three times just pray. So I just stepped over to the side and I prayed a little prayer and instead of going and just cranking up the car, I started talking to brother Jad. And um while talking with brother Jack for a long time, I just I wanted to talk to him because I had certain decisions that I wanted to make. And uh I had already made up in my mind when we started studying on Wednesday in the book of Samuel that, you know, when Hannah was down praying, Eli, which was a priest, he was the actual shepherd, he didn't know what was going on. and he came up and uh he said, "You've been drinking all that. You know how it all goes." And then he said, "God gives you your petition." So, I just wanted to hear that. That's all I wanted to hear. I was just talking with brother Jack and he didn't even know that's what he said. He actually gave me the position that I was that I was looking for. So, after that, uh we got ready to go. The majority of the saints had already left. So I go and get in her dad's car with Naomi and Naomi said, "Solomon, go back and crank it up. Do it one more time." I said, "All right." So she pulled over. I jumped in the car and I crank it and it crank up. But before she told me that, she said, "Brother Jack just preached this. Why is it not we operating our faith? So when I crunk it up, Brother Jack and Sister Erica was in the store and brother Jack got out. He said, "Did that car just crack?" I said, "Yes, it did." So we got to praise the Lord a little bit. Then Naomi came up and she gave a little testimony. And brother Jack said right before we left, he said, "You know why that happened? Because of what you did on Sunday." So the first thing came to my mind, well the devil didn't like that. We going to do it again this Sunday. So we going to there's a flow down here. It was anointed last week. We broke the ice, stepped on the devil neck. We going to step on again. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's sing this little song together. Messiah is the King of Kings.

Oh, I went to a wedding on Sunday night. Thank you. That's what it was. And um and I think we got home late. It must have been close to 11:00, 10 something. And um and Paul and Xandy were still there. And I'm like, usually they'd be gone with the kids and they got to go to work and all this, you know, all this other stuff. So, but they were still there and I was pretty shocked. But they were inside the house watching an old video and they told me Alexandria just would not do anything else until that video got to running. And it was an old concert that we did at um at Rapture Faith and um and you saw Sister Dixon on the video. Uh you know, and and the girls were just pointing at everybody on the video and and everything. And I said, "Yep." And Sister Boyd was there on that video. You remember Brother Stew? You remember Brother Stew? He was on that video. Yeah. It was a neighbor of you all. And uh so we went way back and and they was telling me how Xandy just say I mean they was trying to get this thing connected cuz it's a old VCR trying to connect to a new television and they was having all kind of problems and Xandy wouldn't let Paul sit down until she got that thing working. She wanted to see that video. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. It's something about familiar places. Glory. But but when we saw Sister Dixon on the video, it just reminded us so much of where we come from and how good God has been to us. Uh they have a song they say, "Down through the years.

Uh but the other thing we know is that when we leave, we can't have less. We can't go backward. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I feel like But I better stop this right now. But but we're reading in the book of Ezekiel in our daily Bible reading, they talking about Amen. them them cherubam and and them wheels and the direction of the wheel.

Well, y'all going to have to make me do this out of memory, but I do got some things to announce. Uh, one of the things that's not on announcements that I need to make mention of is that on on Wednesday night, uh, we have a uh a guest minister passing through. He's on his way to Trinidad uh to preach for Brother Oitt and his church there. and he asked if he could just stop through and see us on his way. And that's brother Andrew Glover uh will be with us on Wednesday night. So, uh we will look forward to to that. Amen. On Wednesday, we have some birthdays uh coming up and on tomorrow, Sister Nelly will be celebrating a birthday. We wish her a happy birthday. Praise God. Sister Dixon is celebrating her birthday on Wednesday the 10th. God bless you, Sister Dixon. Amen. Uh my God, my God, my God. Uh that's a blessing. that the the the devil done tried for so long &gt;&gt; to try to take out Sister Dixon, &gt;&gt; but that devil is still a liar. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Glory. Glory. My Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I'm just so happy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Um so don't forget Wednesday night 7:30 the service and then our streaming continues through um Facebook sat tabernacle and then also uh our church website john423.org. Uh on Tuesday night, our brother's virtual prayer meeting will be happening on Tuesday. So want to keep that in mind. And then Friday, December 19th, uh there will be a youth service here at the church. So uh keep that in mind as well. As I mentioned to you all, um um yeah, I'll mention this and Christmas blessings. This is where we um usually give out gift cards to um uh to bless others during this Christmas season. And we we usually do that at the pantry. We have a place that God has opened up for us to be able to do outreach. So, we just we're we're compounding all of our efforts there uh just to make it easier on everyone. Uh but we uh we want to give gift cards to some of the families that we serve there at the pantry. Uh we have a box in the back. It's a polka dot box that you'll see. Uh if you buy a gift card, just put it in there. If you want to just put a little card, uh put it in a little card, write a little note just to, you know, to wish someone a merry Christmas. I'm sure to be a blessing to these families. I believe um we have to have that. Is it next Sunday? By Wednesday the Okay, by Wednesday the 17th. They have to be in by Wednesday the 17th. So uh keep that in mind and uh but um uh the plan is to give as many cards as we can just to be a blessing to to others during this uh Christmas season. Amen. Also just want to make mention we have our upcoming um uh watch night service and uh we have we're working on something should be finalized by tomorrow and we'll let you know where we'll be going because the the church has asked if they could use their space on that night and um which it belongs to them. They were asking us if we could just be out by 9:30. I said that's what time we get started. So, I I guess we going to have to find somewhere else. And um you know, and I and and and God always makes things a little uncomfortable. I was reading something on yesterday about, you know, nine ways to know the will of God. And one of the ways to know whether God is opening a door for you, they said, is when things begin to get uncomfortable, that's how you know God is stretching you to somewhere else that you need to go. I said, "Well, I I'll receive that." Cuz I got here this morning and I looked and saw a sign. And on the sign, it said there was another church renting from here on Sundays. And I don't know what other time they rent. But I say, "My God, my God, my God, it's getting a little crowded." And I'm sure it's a blessing to them, but for us, it's a little tight. And uh we're just going to have to just put our faith on the line and keep praying and fast and believing God to open up a door uh supernaturally for us. And like I said, we ain't going backward now. Whatever God getting ready to open up, it's got to be more and got to be better. Amen. So So please keep that in mind. We'll give you the address. We'll start announcing that hopefully by Wednesday to let you know. But it will be a uh we got a site in West Palm Beach that we'll be looking at going to do our watch night service. Amen. There. So y'all start preparing, give testimonies, things that God has done for you. We've been in the season of I will restore, say the Lord. And y'all look around. Is it is it restoration around here? Come on now. Y'all y'all know God has God has manifested his word in our midst. God has done what he said he was going to do and there's still more work to be done. &gt;&gt; So, we're we're we're under expectation, but I want you all to just be prepared to kind of share testimonies on that night. And uh and we're going to we're just going to worship the Lord as we come into the uh the new year. So, we have our giving uh it's through Zel, PayPal, or Cash App if you want to use the online giving methods. Preferred method is Zel because they don't take fees.

So we want to see certain scriptures every scripture in the Bible before we were born that scripture was ordained in heaven for our work on this earth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And some of the scriptures are of eternal qualities. In other words they pertain to eternal things of God. Right? &gt;&gt; They are eternal, everlasting, forever and ever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It will carry on to the other side. &gt;&gt; And there are scriptures that are only temporal &gt;&gt; or they pretend to be temporal things of life. &gt;&gt; The flesh and things we see around us, they are not eternal. And those scriptures will fulfill in temporal dimension &gt;&gt; and they'll be done away with. just have us even in the dimension. There are dimensions that are eternal &gt;&gt; that that were there before the foundation of the world &gt;&gt; and they are here and they will be there when we leave this earth &gt;&gt; and there are some of the dimension that are temporal they were put here to create a contrast &gt;&gt; because without a contrast we can't manifest certain attribute eternal attribute of life &gt;&gt; so those dimension will happen and when they have done with their job their duties they'll be annihilated consumed and done away with That's right. &gt;&gt; And some of those dimension work in our lives even as we are here. &gt;&gt; Sickness will work in your life &gt;&gt; but it's not it's not it's not eternal. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Old age works in your life. It's not eternal. &gt;&gt; Baby in diapers works in our life but it's not eternal. &gt;&gt; Weaknesses in the flesh are temporal but they are not eternal. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost will do away with those temporal things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's uh maybe start with one. I've got a lot of scriptures and what I'm think I'm going to do is I'll go through the slide first. First one I was just praying a lot. I wish I don't have to preach with slice. I just want to go under anointing but some of the teachings pertain to some of the preaching pertain to teaching. So when you have scriptures and quotes, it helps even other brothers, ministers to also study further and the Lord reveals more thing to us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we need the scriptures and the quotations of the prophet. &gt;&gt; So let's start with a go to the first slide and see we can lay a background with Ephesians 1:4 and Revelation 13:8. It's just a simple scripture. Ephesians 14 Ephesians chapter 1 vers4. If you can be on our feet as we read as many as can as we read the word of our Lord Jesus Christ. Ephesians 1 uh chapter 1 vers4. according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. So the choosing was done when before the foundation of the world. So that is eternal attribute before you were born before Adam dropped here. The choosing was not done based on your sins. &gt;&gt; The choosing was not done based on your strength. It wasn't done based on your your your capability to serve the Lord. But it was chosen before even your flesh &gt;&gt; was put the elements of your flesh were put on earth &gt;&gt; that you should be holy and without blame blame in love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How can you think about a human being be holy &gt;&gt; and that's aation of God. So if God want us to be holy, he has to make a way for it. &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ was the lamp of God before the foundation of the world to cleanse us from our unholiness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation 13:8 and all that dwell dwelleth on earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamp or in other words we can call it the lamb's book of life &gt;&gt; slain from before the foundation of the world &gt;&gt; so they are human beings that are they could be your neighbors friends co-workers bosses whoever they may be their names were not the truth is that their names were not written in the land book of life &gt;&gt; from before the foundation of the world and you can't help them. You can't push the word of the Lord in their head. It will just come up to the other head, the other ears because there's no anchor to receive the word. &gt;&gt; But they serve a purpose on this in this life. &gt;&gt; They are human beings. &gt;&gt; They've got flesh and blood like you. They've got human spirit. They've got a soul, but they don't have the recept to receive the word of the Lord &gt;&gt; because they were not made so. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to the name of the Lord. We may take our seat. My brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; how worthy can you can you how can you think about it? One sister said, "Brother, it blows my mind away when I think about predestination that I was ordained before the foundation of the world." &gt;&gt; How can you perceive that you were born in sin, raised in iniquity, but God chose you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He chose brother Jackdav before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; He chose sister Erica before the foundation of the world to be where you are to be in this position. Amen. Before brother Jack was born, the Lord ordained him to be a minister, pastor of God. &gt;&gt; Before Sister Erica was born, the Lord ordained her to be a wife of a minister, the first lady of God. &gt;&gt; Before Sister Bur was born, she was ordained to be a mother of her pastor. &gt;&gt; It wasn't her choosing. It's not your choosing. God ordained those things before you were even dropped on this earth. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. And my brother, when those scriptures embibbe in your heart, &gt;&gt; it takes away all the weaknesses of the mind, &gt;&gt; all the doubts and the unbelief &gt;&gt; and then you can start as a son and a daughter of God &gt;&gt; that you are Elohim in the incarnate form &gt;&gt; to manifest your word and in your day. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So let's go through the next scripture the next the next uh slide. I want to quickly go through the slides first &gt;&gt; that is the dimensions the eternal dimensions versus the temporate realms. All right. &gt;&gt; The first dimension is the universal space of occupancy. &gt;&gt; All the universe, not only on this earth, beyond the earth, we've got other planets. &gt;&gt; We've got Jupiter, Mercury, and beyond that, we've got universe, spiritual universe, &gt;&gt; where angels are, &gt;&gt; where the saints are. &gt;&gt; As we are here, there are saints here. &gt;&gt; But there's another world right here &gt;&gt; which this eyes is not able to detect and see. &gt;&gt; But the saints of God are here. &gt;&gt; I think two days, was it yesterday? I send a message a song. I'm not a singer Jack, but I try to make a noise, joyful noise unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; So there's a minister friend of mine who loves I sing for him and I recorded for him. He studies, he's trying to study uh my native language, Akan tree in Ghana. So I sent him songs and we kind of practiced a little bit. So I sang a song in English, in Spanish and then in Akan and I sent it to him. And so he sent me said, "Brother, you don't know what happened to me." I said, "What?" He said, "I was involved in an accident on November 22nd." I said, "Really? You didn't tell me? I didn't know." He said, "I was coming from work and driving back home, I think in the midnight, and there was a black car, no light, no nothing to see that there was a car on the road." So, I ran into this vehicle. He said, "When I run, I was expecting uh the the airbag to deploy. It didn't deploy, but I saw somebody wrap around me." &gt;&gt; Wow. when the collision, it wasn't a head-on collision. It was the front side of the vehicle, the right side or so. And then there was a big crash and the guy had broken bones. There was a female, a woman driving and I don't know the husband or whoever, he said they had broken bones, but surprisingly there was nothing. Only had some pains. They took us to the hospital and I came back home. &gt;&gt; But I saw somebody wrap around me &gt;&gt; when they brace. Who do you think was wrap around you? Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the ray you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might not see him in this in this eyes with this eyes, &gt;&gt; but he is in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In fact, he was in you before you were even born again. &gt;&gt; What is the new birth? The new birth helps you to know that Christ is in you. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. Sometime in preaching, we preach it as if God comes to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham said, I'll go to my quotes. I think I've gone ahead of myself. He said, whatever you need on this earth, God put it in you. &gt;&gt; And he said, if the mango seed or apple seed before this little apple seed, orange, whatever seed, &gt;&gt; everything, brother, preach with me. All the fruits. He said the fruits that you're going to take from the apple tree, &gt;&gt; your children will take from the apple tree, &gt;&gt; your grandchildren will take from the apple tree. &gt;&gt; All of them in the little seed. &gt;&gt; Brother Troy, how can how can it be? &gt;&gt; You take this little seed, &gt;&gt; you can dissect it. The doctors, the anatomist can dissect it. They're not going to find no fruits, &gt;&gt; no trees, no flowers. &gt;&gt; But yes, it's hidden right there. Where is he at? Is the intelligence of the almighty. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the new birth was right in you. &gt;&gt; Only we didn't know it was there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise be to the Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't mean to tell you this test. Let let me share with you. I was born and raised in Ghana and I went to a school. It's in Cape Co. It's a boarding school and somewhere young as 9 years old. Your parent drop you there because it was an early school. So parents want their children to pass through school through that school and the school was very rigid. It was a Methodist institution established in 1876. The laws the regulations is boy school. So it's very rigid. The school is it's like a college very big compound with lands and and and a stadium. But then the entrance of the school there are a couple of uh stones white stones. If you cross that stones it means you are in town. And so if you don't have permission from from a teacher and you cross you when you are caught you are in town. One of the rule was that a bridge of a a breach of common sense a breach of school rule. In other words, if you see a trash and you don't pick it is a breach to your common sense. &gt;&gt; So one day what one day I was in school. We went to school. I was dropping school and I was like I don't want to go to cafeteria. I don't want to start eating cafeteria food. I want food from town. So the boys, we have this operation. Listen, if I don't want to go to town, I can pay you um we call it pay you, what's the word? I'll pay you a risk allowance for you to go to town and buy me food. So let's I can give you $50, buy me food. Let's say $10, you use the $30 to buy yours. So I was like, you know what? I'll give you I'll give you a risk allowance so that if you go to town said, no, no, I'm not going. If you want to go, go buy your own food. I said, no. cuz something told me, a voice told me that when you go to town, you're going to get in trouble. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; So, I just I'm not going. But I wanted food from town. &gt;&gt; So, I was trying with all my friends, hey, they were going to town. I'll pay you this money. I'll give you the risk allowance because we call it risk allowance. When you caught, you're going to be suspended. They're going to send you back to your parents. &gt;&gt; So, that person is taking a risk to go to town without permission. So, he has to get his risk allowance to do that. &gt;&gt; So, none of my friends were like, "No, you got to go with me. if you want to go, we go together. So fin said, what I let's go and I went and right at the at the entrance of the school, the principal was hiding somewhere playing playing we call it ch it's like a it's like chess playing chess with some people. So when we cross there, you you you follow me, let's go back to school. &gt;&gt; And I remember that the voice told me that when you go, you're going to get in trouble. But I defied that voice and that is the same voice &gt;&gt; after I had a new birth &gt;&gt; all over my life in my ministry in England in in Mexico. The same voice has been speaking with me. It's not a different voice. &gt;&gt; And I didn't know anything about new birth. I was I was in Pentecost. New birth is speaking in tongues. &gt;&gt; I didn't know that was a voice. I know there was an internal voice telling me do not go. You're going to get in trouble. &gt;&gt; So the song goes like he was there all the time. He was there all the time. The theophony was there all the time. &gt;&gt; Even when we were born in sinship iniquity, &gt;&gt; you are eternal son of God. &gt;&gt; You are eternal daughter of God. &gt;&gt; You can never be lost. Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when we can't help oursel, he helps us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in the with the dimension, let's come back to the dimension right quick. Uh the first dimension is space. It's eternal. Second dimension is matter or the earth. It's also eternal. But the third dimension which is time, time is temporary. Time came into manifestation &gt;&gt; to create a contrast. &gt;&gt; And anything that has got to do with time will fade away. It could be forever and ever. It could be aons and millions of years. It will still come to an end. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the fourth dimension is records, science, communication, internet, tech, TV. Abraham said that TV was TV was in Garden of Eden when Adam was there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's only now science is trying to discover TV waves. &gt;&gt; But it was right there in the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; Adam was watching TV, not with this screen. Amen. Because he had the ether wave from the other dimension. &gt;&gt; Adam could look at the zodiac. There was no clouds. When Adam was on earth, &gt;&gt; he could read Christ through the sun. He could read the wife of Christ through the moon. He could see his destiny through the sky. &gt;&gt; That was the Bible Adam had. And all the record are in the dimension. Now that the the tech billion or trillioners are trying to make money out of it. But it's always internet is not it's like I think what do you call it sometime people are like Americans to Americans people don't exist until Americans go there &gt;&gt; people have lived their life years &gt;&gt; they are there but then those nations don't exist when American colonizers enter there then you are discovered no you are just discovering it they were there before you got there amen So way beforeh what do you call it all these tech billionaires got to know about this technology the tech was already there &gt;&gt; because it was the spoken word of God and they are in the dimensions amen &gt;&gt; and they are eternal that's why said that whatever you do on earth if you don't repent your record will be right there waiting for you &gt;&gt; amen glory hallelujah the fourth dimension the fifth dimension is hell and that is temporal hell death unbelief and the realms of the lost where the demons the lost souls are where demons and perversion and diseases wars politics all this political kingdom they are temporal &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; and so whatever politics makes you to do is going to be temporal &gt;&gt; you can't take it with you &gt;&gt; I saw a spirit that was born the spirit has already been there since garden of Eden h sorry since the book of Genesis but then it was legalized in the United States some few years ago when I came to the United States homosexualism wasn't legal. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But then just in the time of some president and the vice president, the vice president make a proclamation &gt;&gt; and the the president has to back him. &gt;&gt; And so I saw some popular basketball players or baseball players were one of the first people to become to come up as they were gays &gt;&gt; and lesbians. &gt;&gt; But now that spirit is a spirit of perversion. &gt;&gt; God made you either a man or a woman. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He didn't make you anything in between. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you carry that spirit on you and when you leave this earth that spirit cannot go to the presence of God &gt;&gt; and your time is end on earth. &gt;&gt; So you can't go to the sixth dimension which where God is and the seventh dimension &gt;&gt; and you can't come back to the earth. &gt;&gt; You can't come back in time. &gt;&gt; So you are been you're going to be in a place of torment where demons will torment you. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you've seen somebody who's been tormented by demons. &gt;&gt; Sometime it's worse than dying. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's worse than depression. &gt;&gt; It's even worse than suicide. &gt;&gt; Because they torment you, torture. You are not dead, &gt;&gt; but the demon spit are touching your brain. &gt;&gt; They're touching your mind, your emotion. &gt;&gt; And I happen to see a lady in Mexico. Thank God her grandfather was was a man of God. I believe that was the only thing that saved her life. &gt;&gt; She went into prostitution. A young a young lady thinking she was beautiful and demons tormented her. She was on a bed dying. Not just that, but the torment. &gt;&gt; When we went to pray for her, you could see that she's in a I mean, how he was more than depression. She was in a serious torment in her mind, in her emotions. &gt;&gt; But thank God, somebody was standing the gap for her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So those demons, they are there. &gt;&gt; But if you are in another dimension, they can't even come near you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to the Lord. And the sixth dimension, that is where you live. If you have got a new birth in your life, if you are a son of God, a daughter of God. So the sixth dimension is heaven, theophony, angels, saints, regions of the bless where the saints live. Not just when they die, but when you are here, you a saint. Are you a saint? &gt;&gt; Are you in the sixth dimension? &gt;&gt; Is the sixth dimension in you? &gt;&gt; Is heaven in you? &gt;&gt; Or you want to die before you go to heaven? &gt;&gt; No. I want heaven in my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you want heaven in your life? Amen. Because if you don't have heaven in you, this life will not be pleasant for you. &gt;&gt; Because the torment you're going to go through, &gt;&gt; you don't have no peace. &gt;&gt; People have got billions, millions, &gt;&gt; but they don't have peace in their heart. &gt;&gt; People have got all the cars, houses, mansions, &gt;&gt; but they afraid of death. &gt;&gt; Cuz when they think about death, they don't have no hope beyond this life &gt;&gt; because they don't have representation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing there to receive the word of the Lord. But God has blessed you before the foundation of the world to be able to receive &gt;&gt; the theophony. Amen. &gt;&gt; In fact, the theophony was in you before you drop here on earth. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. And the seventh dimension is where everything began. That is Elohim, Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word man, the logos, &gt;&gt; the remma, &gt;&gt; that is where the almighty when we in him. When you say we're in God, sometime our mind is like having a thinking in your mind. No, it's not the same with God. with me. I have a thought tomorrow maybe I'll go to Miami. That is a human thought. &gt;&gt; But the thought of God if you read the church is not the same. &gt;&gt; God's thought is real. &gt;&gt; Bar Solomon Johnson was a son of God &gt;&gt; in real form. &gt;&gt; Not in physical not in the time form but he was a physical being &gt;&gt; with different material not earthly material of calcium, potassium and X-rays. No, &gt;&gt; you have another material which is a celestia. Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were not as as old as you were maybe in your 40s, 50s. You were as young as about 18 years old. &gt;&gt; You existed in that dimension. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a song that we sing. Uh let me see what's the song. Uh I forgot the song, but the song doesn't it was composed by I think Pentecostal. So they don't have the revelation. There's a song that said a place we've never been before. No, that's a place you your life began. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when I when when I hear song, I look at the revelation the song. If it doesn't tally with the revelation of Christ in me, I don't take it or I will change it to my revelation. Amen. Because I was there all along. Amen. Quu was in a man of God, not as a thought of a human but in a real form. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was existing as an 18 year to 25 year old young man. Amen. And when you drop this earth, what is the difference between before you existed and when? The only thing is you didn't have an earthly experience. &gt;&gt; Brother didn't know what redemption was &gt;&gt; when it was like 18 years. &gt;&gt; Hello my brother. How are you? How old are you? 12. Okay. You are much younger. You are not there yet brother. &gt;&gt; How old are you? &gt;&gt; Josiah. How old are you? &gt;&gt; Perfect. That's that's right there. Right there. Brother Josiah. So that's the right like the age that brother Jack was. Amen. But he didn't understand what redemption. What is Lord? What is redemption? Say you find out &gt;&gt; what is hungry. &gt;&gt; You find out &gt;&gt; what is death. &gt;&gt; You You find out &gt;&gt; what is crying. &gt;&gt; You find out &gt;&gt; what is gay hair. &gt;&gt; You find out. &gt;&gt; What is pains in the ribs? You find out &gt;&gt; what is arthritis. You find out &gt;&gt; what is graveyard. you find out &gt;&gt; because it doesn't exist in that dimension &gt;&gt; so now God or mine &gt;&gt; permit me God has to take the theophony &gt;&gt; Jagdav the theophony &gt;&gt; who can be here in United States &gt;&gt; and if you want to go to Mexico or North Carolina Louisiana to preach he doesn't have to buy ticket sister Erica you don't have to go online and set cheap ticket no sister Sarah I don't have to do that for your parents. &gt;&gt; Now, he need to go to preach in Louisiana. Okay. By thought, he's in Louisiana. &gt;&gt; He need to play guitar. You don't have to go to guitar company. H your flute instrument. Sister car. Just by thought. It come from the earth and you play your instrument. When you finish, you bring it back to the earth. &gt;&gt; And that power is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. That attribute is in you. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. How is Dixon? God bless Dixon. I am so happy to see you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's been my prayer and I was surprised the Lord you answer prayer. &gt;&gt; I mean in real time. Amen. So now God has to put brother Jagdafani, brother Josiah Theopani into the earth to experience tears to experience gray hair to experience pain to experience sicknesses to experience everything that we go through in human form. So he was ordained putting his father as a seed. &gt;&gt; Whilst his father was a young man, he was carrying brother Jack like just like the mango seed &gt;&gt; and then through the bedding grounds, brother Jack Daf was born in earth. &gt;&gt; I'll go back to some some some quotes. He said when you were baby, sorry, when a mother is pregnant, &gt;&gt; before the the baby is born, the mother could be as cruel and as wicked as you can be. &gt;&gt; She could be a woman who beat the husband who beat all the people in the neighborhood. There are really some women who beat their husband. If you fall in the hands of those women who want to you, they are stronger than men. If you don't bring the paycheck, you are in trouble. You have to work and bring on the paycheck. You have to account for how much you you use on gasoline. You have to account on how how much you use for breakfast and lunch. If you go over it, you are in trouble. So, but yes, those that woman when he's about to give birth to a baby, she's so sweet and tender. &gt;&gt; What? Where is that sweetness coming from? &gt;&gt; It's coming from the angel. &gt;&gt; The baby when the baby's in the womb, the baby doesn't have any life. The life is all from the mother. &gt;&gt; It's just like muscles. &gt;&gt; I mean, feeding off from the mother. But then the life of the baby comes around the mother just before she's born. And then when the the the the baby is born, then the angel or the messenger or the human spirit enters into the baby and they begin to cry and then there's life &gt;&gt; and you go through the process they see. Oh my I'm getting ahead of myself. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; The Lord is good. &gt;&gt; We go there. Let's let's finish the dimension for the sake of time because it's already 11. So let's go to H. So the dimension is the the Elohim. Let's go to uh the A dimension. The A dimension is what we give back to God. Abraham said there's seven major dimension. Then he said there's a dimension is the Pentecostal. He said we have to give credit to the Pentecostals for that worship and praise and Pentecostal songs which bring the presence of God down. So the A dimension is what we give back to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our praise and worship that we give back to the Lord. Ram call it a dimension. And now we have the lake of fire which is a brimstone and burning sulfur. Not a physical sulfur, not a physical lake. The lake of fire is what is the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; What can consume demons? The pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; What can consume the old nature? &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; So that consumes and anhalate any temporal dimension out of existence. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there's nothing the natural fire. Take a take a natural fire. take a paper and and strike a match into the paper. It's going to burn. But then you see the cab on the ashes, but the pillar of fire doesn't burn and leave ashes. &gt;&gt; When he consumes the old person, he consumes the old person. &gt;&gt; When he consumes you, he consumes you. Amen. &gt;&gt; That you don't the old man doesn't exist no more. Then he place himself and you become a brand new cross his path. You take a knife and slay your ears. &gt;&gt; God. But God &gt;&gt; who ordained him before the foundation of the world changed Peter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the vision was shown to Peter three times because the Lord could not do that. He's done it already in his flesh. So he needed your flesh, Peter's flesh to manifest himself. And when Peter Peter agreed now, he went to preach and Cornelos received the word. He was one time going on on on to the temple and his people said, "Oh, we hear Peter is passing through jog road. Let's park my sick mom, my grandmother, my grandfather who hasn't working. I mean, walk for about maybe in about 20 years. Let's take him along the side because there were so much crowd you couldn't get Peter to pray for you. But let's just park him on the street stretches just in case his shadow will fall upon him &gt;&gt; and his shadow was healing people. Do you think was Peter's shadow? No, it was the pillar of fire in him. &gt;&gt; It was a man Christ in him that was healing the people. He was only using Peter. Amen. &gt;&gt; So whatever you do is to the glory of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a story, let me bring this story. There was a story of a donkey. You remember the donkey that rode Jesus on h before he was crucified. And this donkey, the women were were putting their clothes and velvet and different expensive clothes for the for the donkey to ride on. And after the resurrection, the women would even say hello to the donkey. So this donkey was so upset and so sad. So one friend, one donkey friend was walking around and said, "My buddy, what why you so sad? What's what's going on with you?" Said, "Look, look at this woman. Look at Sister Tina." Two days ago, I was carrying Jesus majestically and Sister Tina put her clothes here and I saw Satina. She didn't even say good morning to me. Sister didn't say good morning to me. And his friend said, "So, so what's your problem?" Said, "But they don't even care about me. They don't remember me no more." He said, "Friend, it wasn't about you. &gt;&gt; It was about Jesus." Amen. &gt;&gt; They put their clothes for because we carrying Jesus. Come on. Let's go get some grass and chew. Forget about get get behind yourself. Get beside yourself. &gt;&gt; So don't look at yourself as so important about the Christ in you. &gt;&gt; It's not your human flesh, but it's your Christ that makes the difference. &gt;&gt; And so that's why we need to pack more Christ into us. The more Christ you pack into us, the more difference you can make in life. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Don't I don't think this is a one day sermon. But let's see. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever more. They all time element. So, let's go to the next one. I created a a term called theomorphy. Theo means God or Elohim. Morphe and morphed himself in the flesh. That that's not in a message book that I don't think is in any dictionary. That's my own term that I use. God theomorph himself in us. &gt;&gt; Wow. God putting himself in us so that to make you my sister Christ amen on earth. So that is a mix of the eternal and the temporal qualities personal of Christ in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the new birth. If you read 2 Corinthians 5:1-4 said for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle which is what temporal &gt;&gt; were dissolved we have a building of God. Not that we're going to have, but we do have a building of God and a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens. So your theophony was not even created because Elohim couldn't be created. &gt;&gt; Your theophony was eternal. &gt;&gt; It didn't have any beginning. &gt;&gt; It only begin on earth by manifesting in your flesh. &gt;&gt; But it does not have be it doesn't have any beginning. Neither would it end. So for in this uh in this flesh in other words in the temporal flesh we grown earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from above. That's the new birth. If so be that let's let's keep okay. If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. For we that are in this tabernacle do grown being burdened not for that we will be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life. That's eternal life will swallow the mortal life in you. Amen. Let's go to the next one. I think I'll show this one for display because of time sake. So you can read it later when you get back home. Let's go to the next slide. Just want to go through the slide. Eternal attributes of Elohim, Christ and Jesus the temper. Hebrews 145 7 and 8. Uh number four he said being he's talking about Christ. He said being made so much better than the angels. So now he's better than angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than thee. For unto which of the angels said he at any time, thou art my son, this day have I beg be begotten thee. And again I will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son. And of the angel said, who maketh his angel spirit and his ministers a flaming fire? But unto the son he said, thy throne, oh God, is forever and ever a skept of righteousness is the skept of thy kingdom. So now Christ is higher than the angels. Then just the next uh chapter Hebrews chapter 2:9 said, "But then we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that by by the grace that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man." Now this person look take look at the equation. This one was higher than the angels, the almighty God as we read in Hebrews 1. But Hebrews 2, he now unfolding another attribute of a human being. So he's been made lower &gt;&gt; till he become so human &gt;&gt; till like on the cross. Even before the cross, he asked, he prayed to the father. The pill of fire. What is the father? Not the father in the clouds. There was no father in the clouds. &gt;&gt; But he was praying to the father in him. &gt;&gt; Your father is in you. The holy ghost is in you. &gt;&gt; He said if you your world take this suffering from me. And he was so weak to angels. Theophan is Moses Elijah came to what? Minister to him, strengthen him. What is ministering? To strengthen him. &gt;&gt; Said Lord go to Calvary for us. If you don't go for us, the whole creation is gone. &gt;&gt; So the Lord has now come out from his flesh and then be the Christ &gt;&gt; and go and die for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ was 100% human being. Jesus the Jesus part was 100% human being and the Christ part was 100% almighty God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the next slide. &gt;&gt; I love the scripture. &gt;&gt; John 15 verse 17-19. The the 19 is my scripture. And I'll tell you why. 17 said, "But Jesus answered them, my father worketh, he that too and I work." 18 Therefore the Jews sought sought them all to kill him because he not only had broken the Sabbath. You committed one sin and broken the Sabbath, but said also that God was was his father, making himself equal with God. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; For the Sabbath, we can let it slide by. But for you, &gt;&gt; we know your mother, we don't even know your father &gt;&gt; and you call yourself the almighty God. No, no, no, no, no. You are destroying the law of Moses &gt;&gt; for that. Abraham preaching a message, things that are to be. I was listening to it a couple of night ago. He said the Jews, they loved Jehovah. They loved their God. I'm just paraphrasing it. &gt;&gt; But then for Jehovah, who was the almighty God, came to Moses on the mountain, for him to come in the flesh, Emmanuel &gt;&gt; and said that I am that I am. &gt;&gt; So that was a little bit too much for them. &gt;&gt; They couldn't take it &gt;&gt; and they kill him. &gt;&gt; And up to now they in blindness. I used to watch some shows that organized by a young a young lady h she bring Muslims, Christians, Jewish and they kind of have everybody talk about their faith and things and I saw one of them h the order of them talk about their faith came coming from Abraham coming from uh Jewish even the Muslim lady was saying that their religion come from Jews of course Christian and the Jewish they read the New Testament but Jesus never claimed to be God and the Christian lady yes he was God he said I am that I am he received worship and after that the Jewish lady was said I know one thing we love about you Christian is uh the way you know your scripture but our Jewish religion we don't we don't it doesn't teach us about heaven &gt;&gt; we our life is on this earth we don't focus on heaven &gt;&gt; we are god here &gt;&gt; but heaven is not what we focus on it doesn't teach us that &gt;&gt; and Muslims said that even Muhammad wasn't sure whether we go to heaven and most Christians said that then what is the religion what religion do you have that you are not even sure of eternal life &gt;&gt; right So that to show you my brother, my sister, &gt;&gt; you've got a weapon. You've got a blessing. &gt;&gt; Regardless of what you go through, you have been so blessed. &gt;&gt; It's not a you don't you not I don't see myself as a religious person, but I see myself as a Christ person. &gt;&gt; Because religion is a man-made covering. &gt;&gt; You can cover yourself as a sheep, but you can be a wolf in the in in the covering. &gt;&gt; So I don't want that covering. I don't want to be called a Christian. I want the Christ in me to display himself &gt;&gt; if Christ is on the inside. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can call yourself all Christian you want. If Christ on on the inside is hypocrisy &gt;&gt; you can't display nothing. You are rather going to display something negative. Amen. But when Christ on the inside when you make a mistake the Christ on the inside will correct you and bring you back to in line. &gt;&gt; Glory. It doesn't mean Christian don't make mistakes. It doesn't mean if you are Christ you don't make mistake because we are on different order. &gt;&gt; Christ Jesus didn't make mistake because he was on an order to save. But we are redeemed to be little saviors. But yes, we make mistake in this earth. &gt;&gt; When you have the Holy Ghost, you can never sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But you can make a mistake. &gt;&gt; And you make your mistake is accounted for in the atonement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God doesn't even see that mistake that you make. &gt;&gt; Praise be to. You might see the mistake, but the pill of fire doesn't see the mistake. &gt;&gt; Because he's got an atonement that has made propreation for your sin. Propiation for your sin. Where was that? Yeah. The next verse is what I love. Verse 19 said, "Then said, then answered Jesus and said, and said unto them, very verily I say unto you, the son can do nothing of himself, but whatsoever he seeth the father doeth, likewise doeth the son. This also doeth the son likewise." &gt;&gt; So, it's one of the scriptures that has blessed me in my ministry personally. And you know, when you look at your life, you can see some of the Bible characters that pertains to you. I look my life I can see my father the Lord Jesus Christ and how he led his life he wasn't rushing for nothing when the situation he know there's something in him so he goes on the inside for the father to speak and when the father speaks then he speaks likewise &gt;&gt; and that will help you to calm your emotions &gt;&gt; calm your mind calm this guy down &gt;&gt; because when there's a situation this guy is going to go on rampage &gt;&gt; doesn't know what to do &gt;&gt; and you can take the wrong action But if you can calm yourself, recollect yourself like Jesus &gt;&gt; that I've got something on the inside. The problem is beyond my resources. I don't know how this going to be, whether it's sickness, whatever it is, but there somebody on the inside. And there's a purpose for this reason is for the glory of the Lord to be made known. &gt;&gt; And then when you come on the inside, the man on the inside take preminence. And what you the flesh cannot do, cannot overcome, cannot surmount, the inner man will summon that problem for you. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And that was a scripture the Lord Jesus Christ used and brother used so much that in my ministry in my life, it helps me. It guides me that if I see the will of the Lord in something, I'm not worried about it. &gt;&gt; I can go headlong into that situation. But if I don't see the Lord of the will of the Lord in my life, I'll stay far away as I can. &gt;&gt; Because I don't I can go just trying to adventure into something I'm not sure of. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you one testimony. I went to Mexico. That was around 20 20 2014 2015 somewhere. And uh through a brother that the Lord raised from death, I got connected to the family. They sent me to another uh pastor in the city, Mterrey, one of the biggest industrial city. All the US companies are there. They make car. they don't have to pay taxes on it. So they all over there. So anyway, so this brothers, we were going to preach in a church. One brother who used to live in Canada, his older brother's church and the older brother doesn't speak, he didn't speak English. So the his brother, younger brother, he's called Hil, he was going to translate. So I was with his brother that the Lord raised from the dead and his two brothers. And I always like to when I travel, I like to have my passport with me. I have to have my laptop, my Bible, my wallet and things like that. So I say, "Okay, you guys sit in the front. I want to keep my my my staff at the back seat. I said, "No, brother, go to the front. We keep your stuff in the trunk and then we sit at the back." Okay. So, I was in the front and we arrived pay the driver in peso and then uh the driver left and said, "Okay, where where's the my bag?" said, "Oh, my brother, we left in the in the car." First I was thinking they were kidnapped a cab driver. I said brother Montter most of the cars are not registered and it's like Miami how you going to see all the cars are green car green cab who am I going to see there's no way he said brother it's also like a trophy for them you came from you're American when you're American tourist come so they want to rob you so if you left your passport laptop closed in the car that's a trophy so brother you might as well forget about it I don't the Bible I was going to preach from was gone My laptop gone, clothes gone, my passport to return back to the US gone. The only thing I had was my wallet and my cell phone. So we went enter into the church. And this Spanish brothers and sisters were praising the Lord. The anointing was so strong. And I had two option. One option is to be sad and think about how to come to us and maybe cancel the preaching. Brother, I can't preach. My passport is gone and you know I'm sad. You have to pre preach to me. I had that option. I'm broken. I don't know how I'm going to go back to US. Maybe I'm going to be a Mexican. I don't know. So, so or I need to probably look for the the nearest US consulate and go and I mean send some petition to get a I don't know some means to go back. So, that was one option. And then opt the next option was we are together again. &gt;&gt; Just praising the Lord. We are together again in one accord. Something good is about to happen. Something good is in stock. We are together again just praising the Lord. So I had those two option &gt;&gt; and I chose the latter. I say you know what I'm here to preach. &gt;&gt; I can get a Spanish Bible. They can read a quotation for me. I don't even care. I'm here to praise and I just jump into the praises dancing and rejoicing with the brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; And I prayed a prayer in my heart. I said, "Lord, let it be like Walans. The driver even if he's a good person would even know that my staff at the trunk unless maybe get another passenger who has staff. So even if he's a good person, there's no way like unless Lord you do something." So I I said brother Lord as you did for brother Walans in Abraham's time when his car was stolen and Abraham and the breed and return let the brother let his driver know even if he doesn't know let him go to the trunk and see them bring it touch his side to bring it to me and so I prayed and I was just rejoicing and dancing with the anointing was so great and having a good time I didn't even care about it and the pastor came the brother went to tell his brother Quu's clothes passport uh Bible it's all gone so the pastor came and it's called Brother Fredo, he came and he took a chair that Armano is here, brother is here to preach for us. But then everything in beside his wallet is is was left in the car. Brother Israel left in the car. So he prayed the same prayer that he pray he didn't speak English but he prayed in Spanish that Lord as you let you did for you did for brother watch and you let all his clothes beside the gas that he lost a little bit let everything return to brother. And as I was in the prayer I saw a vision of green taxi, &gt;&gt; right? I was there my eyes were closed and just green tassic came to my eyes and I saw somebody tapping my I think my my left shoulder I open my eyes and it was a dickin he said mano the cab driver is here and he spoke his said he said he doesn't want to give it to us he want to give the ch they call black people chocolateito or degito negro so they want I was close but I wasn't I I didn't mean to say Come on. Praise the Lord. Is it un unless I see the negto I'm not going to give it to you guy because he doesn't trust Mexico. You can't trust anybody. If I give it to you the negto will not get his stuff. So I want to see the black guy and give his stuff to him. So I went outside and I said my brother I don't know how how to thank you said he was even apologized that he was so sorry because he drove far away before he realized so he was speeding cutting uh vehicles on the way because he was thinking maybe I'll be going somewhere to preach so he wanted to reach get me before I I go to another place &gt;&gt; who did that &gt;&gt; JESUS WHO T THIS MEXICAN DRIVER'S HEART when my staff was a trophy for him. He didn't steal it. You left in a car. It's my trophy. It's a It's a blessing from the Lord. If he was a Catholic, you go to mass and thank God for it. Thank thank God for it. But God touches her to bring it. And I said, "My brother, &gt;&gt; if I don't see you here, I'll see you on the other side." I gave him all the money that I had. &gt;&gt; And I said, "If you want come and listen to the word of the Lord." And he said, "I have an appointment." I said, "Okay, don't worry. I'll see you at the other side. For what you've done for me, I give you eternal life. You've got the power to give life &gt;&gt; because you are Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; The power of life &gt;&gt; and the power of death &gt;&gt; is in your tongue. &gt;&gt; And your tongue is the tongue of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And you've got a choice to give whatever you want. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe you and I will choose to give life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even those who don't who don't deserve it, we give them life. &gt;&gt; You believe for them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Regardless of their condition, &gt;&gt; you believe and put them in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; You intercede on their behalf. &gt;&gt; And you will see them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless. &gt;&gt; I wasn't envisaging to see sister Dixon here. And here she is. Sister Dixon. &gt;&gt; I was praying for her, believing for her. I didn't know the Lord was going to bring. I was thinking like I wish like by Christmas she's here &gt;&gt; and here she is. She's sitting right there. &gt;&gt; Verse. Let's go to the next verse. I think I'll wrap up quickly with time. Matthew 22:23. You can read a scripture. But this was people came to ask Jesus about seven brothers that married uh sorry. Yeah. Seven brothers that married sister. The oldest married a lady. There was no issue. There was no children in the in the in the in the in the marriage he died to the seven. So they came to ask Jesus Lord when on the other side or in heaven in glory whose wife is going to be because all the seven brothers married to this sing this lady. So is it going to be the first, the second, the seventh? Who? The Lord said that, "Oh, you of little knowledge." I'm just paraphrasing it. &gt;&gt; Don't you know that in the resurrection we never give marriage, &gt;&gt; not given in marriage because it's a marriage is timely affair. &gt;&gt; It's second and third dimensional. &gt;&gt; It's a sixth dimensional attribute, but it manifest only in this time. &gt;&gt; So you don't go marry on the other side. No, &gt;&gt; you don't go have children on the other side in the natural. Right? &gt;&gt; Cuz all the hormones in the body when you move to the tufani doesn't have hormones. &gt;&gt; It doesn't operate by estrogen and and progesterone and testosterone. &gt;&gt; Those hormones are not there. &gt;&gt; There's another element that is a pillar of fire. The Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and that pillar of fire doesn't have those instinct to raise children. So we raise our children here. But on that side we don't raise children. &gt;&gt; Praise be to the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said Jesus said that I am the God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob. God is not God of the dead but of the living. &gt;&gt; So on the other side there's nothing like death. &gt;&gt; Death is an earthly h temporal attribute &gt;&gt; and it doesn't have a place on the other side. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go quickly to the next slide. Oh my. That's the quotes. Okay. When their eyes were open, they knew him. That is 64. Okay, I think you can read these quotes later on. Let's go to the next quotes. This code is talking about drinking. So, you have whatever you need, you drink it, right? Let's go to the next quotes because for the sake of time, let's see. Let's go to the next quotes. Okay, let me read these quotes. He said uh you are planted in Christ. Uh let me see. Said we will see Jesus 64. You are planted in Christ. What am I reading? Okay. You are planted in Christ the in inexhaustible fountain of life. So paragraph three. So there I think Christ is the inexhaustible fountain of life. And when we are planted in him, all we need to do is to drink from the fountain of life and push out everything that we have need of in this journey. All the things that we have need of is in him and we are planted in him and draw from him. He's the in inexhaustible fountain of life. Amen. Let me go back and read one of the quotes. Let's go back to let me see the next the next one on top. Perfect. Uh let's see. Jovajyra he said you you you people in Tennessee I don't know if anybody come from Tennessee are known for your apples pineapples orchard and peach orchards and around Georgia and different places you your fine fruit down there in the south I want to ask you something did you know that when you see the little peach musicians please come up here when you when you see the little peach right where was I okay when you see the little peach okay let me paraphrase you you take off your children would take off of your grandchildren would take off do you know that every bushel of peaches is in there when just just little little bitty tiny thing &gt;&gt; right isn't isn't it there where does come from if it's not there where does it come from where's them peaches come from who puts them on the tree how did they ever get there you just set a little slip out and then you water it and drink from the earth it drinks from the earth and it's got to drink more than its portion that's the lesson the cue I want us to take. We need to drink more revelation. &gt;&gt; You're going to drink something that like I've never seen this before, but is the word of the Lord. Drink it. &gt;&gt; It's going to give you strength. It drinks. It drinks and drinks till it just can't drink no more. Then he pushes out limbs. Then it drinks some more and pushes out leaves. Then it drinks some more and pushes out blossoms. Then it drinks some more and pushes out peaches. Then it drinks some more and pushes out more peaches. It keeps drinking and pushing out. You see what I mean? 15. And now that's the way with the Christianity. When a man or a woman or a child of a child is born of the spirit of God, then every then every everything you need of is in this world and the world to come is given to you. When you born a baby, everything you ever need, your wife, your husband, your grandchildren, your money, your millions of dollars. If you want billions, &gt;&gt; cuz this millions even don't worth nothing. &gt;&gt; So you might as well ask for billions and trillions. Because &gt;&gt; because the dollar 20 years ago is not the same. The value is different. &gt;&gt; So don't think if you ask millions you're asking too much. &gt;&gt; Ask more. &gt;&gt; Bank of heaven doesn't go bankrupt. &gt;&gt; And so then everything you need of is in this is is in you when you receive the Holy Spirit and you are planted in Christ. And to my estim to my estimation of Christ, he is the inexhustable fountain of life. And you drink and push out for everything that you have need of is in him. The only thing you have to do is to get thirsty and go drinking, go to drinking and it will produce just exactly what the seed is. It's a promise. God promised to it. God is obligated and you do it. And the last slide, the last slide is what is I like to whatever I preach. I want in a practical experience. How do we apply this? When you can differentiate between the temporal things and the eternal dimension, it helps your own Christian life. It gives you the inner peace and calm and deep satisfaction in your heart in your personal walk with God because you know that there's a being on the inside that whatever happens to you, he's in control. It helps you to understand your personal scriptures. I have my scriptures. When I see the scriptures, yes, it's Esther, but that's that's Mu. Yes, I see John, but that's me. &gt;&gt; I see Matthew, but it's for me. &gt;&gt; I see Revelation, but it's for me. and you walk that scripture because it's your scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so you understand your life then avoid misplacement. But say especially we the preachers said avoid misplacement, displacement and misallocation of scriptures. Cuz if you don't know the scriptures going to you're going to feel like oh Lord why don't you take this my flesh to the other side. It can never go there. You got to drop it here. &gt;&gt; So you can't you can't h you can't major on on the minor. &gt;&gt; This flesh is minor. You can't major on it. It also help you to overcome obstacles. win the victories that we need in life through Christ the third pool cuz certain things are not going to come easy. You're going to have blocks, concrete, not physical concrete, obstacles in your way that you need to push through to the other side and what is in you has to come out. The third pool is already in you. The third pool is not in heaven, it's in you because heaven is in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; We also need spiritual growth, maturity, sensitivity, sensitiv sensitivity of the spirit and operations of gifts and talents in our lives, families, ministries, businesses. And it helps you to help others in their calling. Ministers, mothers, fathers and many other areas of light and also spiritual blessing. There are certain things that we read in the messages, Bible, we don't understand. But when God gives you that discernment, you can differentiate between the new birth, godhead, coming of the Lord, millennium, theophony, rapture, heaven, new heaven and new earth, new Jerusalem. It's just one thing is Christ. God bless you. Let's be on our feet. &gt;&gt; Let's share a word of prayer. Our Lord and father, we thank you for this day where you've brought us. Father, we give all the glory for to your name. have your permanence. Bless each and every one of us. Father, continue to deal with our hearts, our minds. Bless our brothers and sisters all around those who couldn't make it. Father, Lord, have your control and give us a wonderful week in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. Praise the Lord. How many appreciate the word of God on today you know um just and I know we we were brother Quaker was just kind of concerned about time and all of that but I I can't wait for us to not have to worry about that. That was a real good thought. And um you know just just you know as as he was going through he was talking about the story of Esther and how um if you ever found yourself in a similar situation that you could stand on a scripture like that and expect God to move in your life uh the way that he moved her. But when you look at something that happened with Esther like that that would have been more of a temporal situation right? But uh but the way he was bringing out, you know, how we got these eternal scriptures, when you see something that talk about this happened before the foundation of the world, you were in him before the foundation of the world. That ought to just kind of give you a peace that there ain't one thing the devil can do to get you uprooted out of Christ. Brother, brother Tro was sharing it on last week and how, you know, he was he he found himself out there, but uh but he said the the shepherd had to come and break the bones because he was an eternal thought of God. And and I'm I'm so glad that God told us, here's another eternal scripture. All that the father has given me will come. And man, look, we might as well start rejoicing now. We We ain't got to wait for something to happen. We got eternal thoughts that are centered around these things. Praise God. I tell you, I'm I'm I I'm I'm glad I came to church today. I I I feel like I went to church, that I went to the house of God. HALLELUJAH. AND I AND I love how he brought that that testimony in of um the the gentleman that I mean all of his stuff gone. Y'all y'all if y'all never been overseas and uh and you passport is something that you just do not you never let that out of your sight. Keep a passport on you and I put it in a front pocket, back pocket. Somebody might rip it right out of there, but keep it in a front pocket. But you never let no passport get away from you. Computer, passport, everything that the that was important to this brother is gone. It reminded me of what we've been talking about on Wednesday nights and how God will restore these things to you. Just just like just like Saul was just trying to go back and get the donkeys, God gave him them donkeys back, &gt;&gt; right? Plus also anointed him to be king, right? But but a as and God brought his passport, his computer, all that just touched the man's heart to bring it. And as soon as brother Quu said it, in my mind, immediately I said, I don't know what that man's condition is. I don't know what his his his spiritual status is, but I do know this much. That man will be on the other side because of what he did for a son of God. &gt;&gt; And brother Quu say, "Brother, I I I give you life." Now, you got to understand, we have that type of authority &gt;&gt; because Jesus said Jesus told us, right? He he he he says um uh whosoever sins you remit they are remitted and whosoever sins you retain they are retained. So therefore we have this authority we have this this power on the inside that we can give life to others. We sometimes we just don't recognize who we are. And and you did y'all catch all that? We we we had to come here and have this this this this earthly experience. &gt;&gt; What is pain? You'll find out. &gt;&gt; What is death? You'll find out. &gt;&gt; What? WHAT IS IT TO HAVE THIS ONE talking about you and saying this about? You'll find out. And then then turn around when you go through stuff like that, then you got to respond like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Then you'll find out what it means to be like Jesus. &gt;&gt; You'll never know those things until you go through something. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying go to something. No, go through something. &gt;&gt; I I'm blessed, church. I'm blessed. I'm I'm blessed. I'm blessed, man. I'mma tell y'all and y I told y'all I asked you earlier, do we see restoration around us? It's all around us. But you know, one of the other promises that was there in Joel, it said you going to eat &gt;&gt; in plenty. &gt;&gt; And then it didn't just stop there. &gt;&gt; It say you going to be Are y'all satisfied? &gt;&gt; My God.
