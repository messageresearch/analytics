[45:52] uh but by the grace of god we made it
[45:55] back
[45:55] uh from indiana with no issue even
[45:58] though we were exposed
[46:00] to someone that had the virus they're
[46:02] doing a lot better there
[46:04] a man there's roughly i want to say
[46:08] 14 15 people that end up contracting the
[46:11] virus there but you know we only kind of
[46:13] came in contact with one
[46:15] and uh by god's grace he kept us and he
[46:18] watched over us
[46:19] and and uh and and i don't i don't want
[46:22] to
[46:22] brag or anything like that i just want
[46:24] to give thanks to the lord
[46:26] for just keeping us and everything and i
[46:29] want to encourage us
[46:30] as a church i'm gonna tell y'all one
[46:32] thing that i see that happened here that
[46:34] i don't see in a lot of the places y'all
[46:36] actually wear your masks
[46:39] in church a lot of other people don't do
[46:42] it
[46:42] and uh and when and a lot of the
[46:44] testimonies that are here
[46:46] sweeping through is that and i mean
[46:48] people got all kind of theories about
[46:50] the mass
[46:51] look i i'm not here to dispute with all
[46:53] these theories
[46:54] here's what i know coronavirus is here
[46:57] people dying people getting sick
[47:00] that's what i know right and uh and and
[47:03] so i'm not here to
[47:05] debate with all the theories and all
[47:06] that but i will encourage y'all keep
[47:08] doing what you're doing
[47:10] uh by god's grace we haven't had one
[47:13] incident to report and uh and i'm
[47:15] grateful for that
[47:17] i'm grateful so i was talking to
[47:20] somebody just yesterday so you know
[47:22] really when you think about it you know
[47:23] when you're going through something like
[47:24] this whether it's man-made or
[47:26] a pandemic or pandemic whatever it is uh
[47:30] you know uh as we're going through this
[47:32] we need wisdom because
[47:33] um only god can keep us at a time like
[47:36] this and
[47:36] and what i what i'm what i'm grateful
[47:38] for is that god has been keeping us
[47:40] and um you know and i want to encourage
[47:42] y'all keep doing what you're doing
[47:44] you know let's let's not give the devil
[47:45] no room for nothing
[47:47] around here so uh just keep doing what
[47:49] you're doing you know and
[47:50] and i do want to encourage as we're
[47:52] coming in and out of the church please
[47:54] make sure you have your mass as you're
[47:55] standing outside talking to people use
[47:57] your mask

[47:59] nothing wrong with it as i was saying
[48:01] yesterday
[48:01] this guy he was telling me say you know
[48:03] this is a very small thing
[48:05] they're asking us to do wear masks
[48:08] that's that's it it ain't really like
[48:11] it's all that
[48:12] right i think we make more of it than it

[53:52] just
[53:54] praise the lord just stepping in and
[53:57] stepping
[53:58] up and uh i mean i was there at
[54:01] just just streaming the services and
[54:03] just looking at them and i'm like wow
[54:05] you know this is this is really
[54:06] something and i and i'm gonna tell y'all
[54:08] just a little thought that i had y'all
[54:10] probably gonna rebuke me for this
[54:12] thought but i'm gonna just tell it to
[54:13] you anyway
[54:14] amen um i was just looking amen
[54:18] at how ministry has been conducted uh
[54:20] brother solomon i'd certainly appreciate
[54:22] you too brother as well your
[54:24] faithfulness
[54:25] uh every sunday every sunday
[54:29] and and you know you get a chance
[54:31] sometimes to look at other
[54:32] other churches and when you do look at
[54:35] other services
[54:36] uh sometimes you it's good to do that
[54:39] because sometimes we take for granted
[54:40] what we have here
[54:42] right and uh so brother solomon i want
[54:44] to say thank you for your faithfulness
[54:45] and just just coming
[54:46] sunday after sunday just giving of
[54:48] yourself and and uh you know but as i
[54:50] was just sitting there looking at the
[54:51] services
[54:52] just a thought crossed my my mind and i
[54:55] said lord
[54:56] if you were to call me home uh you have
[55:00] given me a glimpse
[55:02] of what spirit and truth would be if i
[55:04] wasn't around
[55:06] and uh and and for me that um
[55:09] says that we have accomplished that
[55:11] replication thing that we were talking
[55:13] about
[55:14] years ago uh the church should not be
[55:16] built on
[55:17] brother jack but the church should be
[55:20] built on the lord jesus christ
[55:22] and and i just i just i just saw a
[55:25] glimpse of that i was just
[55:26] at home and streaming i'm like wow you
[55:29] know the church is functioning and
[55:30] functioning well
[55:32] and i say lord i thank you for that i
[55:34] really do i thank you for that so
[55:36] uh uh thank you church everybody just
[55:39] doing their part
[55:40] you know it just it just means so much
[55:42] every special
[55:43] means something right uh the song a song
[55:46] leader
[55:47] means something the musicians mean
[55:49] something every ministry
[55:51] even you sitting and saying amen to the
[55:53] word means something
[55:55] right so uh i just i just appreciate you
[55:58] all
[55:58] and because spirit and truth is not me
[56:01] but spirit and truth is all of us
[56:03] together amen and i thank god i thank
[56:06] god i
[56:07] i i i'm happy to be worshiping
[56:11] in spirit and in truth amen amen
[56:14] praise the lord so god bless you uh so
[56:17] good to see
[56:18] a man uh everybody in the house of the
[56:20] lord on today
[56:22] um um early sister janice is that right
[56:26] okay we can't call you visit anymore
[56:29] amen
[56:30] it's so good to have you amen in the
[56:32] house lord again
[56:33] [Applause]
[56:36] amen and um uh
[56:39] sister niece amen good to see one of the
[56:42] daughters of the house amen
[56:44] in the house amen and speaking of that i
[56:48] i heard from uh ariel
[56:51] ariel told me to tell the church that he
[56:54] sent his greetings
[56:56] and i say well praise the lord god bless
[56:58] you so
[56:59] uh he's a wonderful brother and and we
[57:02] just thank god for him he just let me
[57:04] know he made it back home safely had a
[57:06] a long schedule after he left here and
[57:08] went to a number of places but he said i
[57:10] made it back safely and just wanted to
[57:11] send my greetings back to the church so
[57:14] uh we certainly thank god for them amen
[57:16] so
[57:17] i will um just try to take us
[57:21] a thought here today and we are
[57:25] um going back and picking up our
[57:28] series uh we have been
[57:31] we started the year off with step into
[57:34] the vision
[57:35] and um and i i was just saying the the
[57:38] greatest vision
[57:40] that we could all enter into is this
[57:43] vision that god
[57:44] gave the prophet and actually was more
[57:47] the vision was a direct
[57:48] word from an angel
[57:52] that he told the prophet pick up your
[57:53] pen and write and he said
[57:55] these things that i'm guarantee this is
[57:57] for the church
[57:58] right this is for the bride for the
[58:00] church and so brother branham picked up
[58:02] his pen and he began to write these
[58:04] things and he penned it
[58:06] and uh and i just been taking pretty
[58:08] much paragraph by paragraph and just
[58:10] trying to bring that uh bring us into a
[58:12] place where we can see where we are
[58:14] and uh and i trust that the lord will
[58:16] just kind of help us uh
[58:18] on today amen uh with this
[58:21] uh i'm gonna read a a a a scripture
[58:24] a soul and and um i just pray the lord
[58:28] to help us
[58:28] amen with uh with our journey here today
[58:31] i um
[58:33] i feel that i wanna share something here
[58:35] before i get started in this thought
[58:38] amen and you all bear with me as i just
[58:41] take a little extra time this morning i
[58:44] haven't been with you for a few weeks so
[58:46] just just just give me a little grace
[58:49] amen um earlier this year we had a
[58:54] brother
[58:54] come to visit us a man from
[58:57] south america his his name was
[59:00] um brother carlos
[59:04] uh he and his wife were here and i think
[59:06] they had a little boy
[59:07] and brother carlos would come up and
[59:08] sing sometimes for us
[59:10] and he's sitting in the back he couldn't
[59:12] unders i mean really speak too much
[59:14] english so brother josue would have to
[59:16] interpret for him
[59:17] um you know and and um
[59:21] so you know they were doing that and but
[59:23] brother carlos really just enjoyed
[59:25] you know the fellowship here while he
[59:26] was here went back home to south america
[59:30] and uh was there for a few months and
[59:32] then the lord gave him a dream
[59:34] and um and he called brother kwaku and
[59:37] he said brother i had this dream about
[59:38] the church and i didn't i didn't know
[59:40] what
[59:41] what what to say he said i was i was it
[59:44] says i was
[59:45] kind of like at the church and it says
[59:47] um
[59:48] i was given a guitar uh but as i was
[59:52] giving the guitar to play
[59:54] the song that they were singing it says
[59:55] i could not catch the rhythm
[59:58] of the song that they were singing i
[1:00:00] couldn't catch the rhythm
[1:00:02] and um and it says it says i didn't
[1:00:05] understand but i i tried but i just
[1:00:07] could not catch the rhythm and it says
[1:00:10] and
[1:00:10] and after uh i i you know i sat down and
[1:00:14] you know with uh with
[1:00:15] you know from from with the guitar set
[1:00:17] down he says uh
[1:00:19] the pastor's mother went to the piano
[1:00:23] and she began to play he says brother i
[1:00:26] don't know
[1:00:27] what this mean but this is dream that i
[1:00:29] had it at the church so
[1:00:31] we said okay well we'll just take it and
[1:00:34] we'll just pray over it
[1:00:35] and just leave it before the lord
[1:00:38] and um we were watching
[1:00:42] and uh god just began to do some things
[1:00:45] and and i told this to a particular
[1:00:49] family it's nothing that i mean i'm
[1:00:51] i i share it with but i shared this with
[1:00:53] a couple brothers
[1:00:54] and watch god had sent a family a man
[1:00:57] here to the church
[1:00:58] and uh right during the midst of this
[1:01:00] pandemic and god sent
[1:01:02] a a a family here to the church
[1:01:05] um and they were hispanic family a man
[1:01:08] and and as they came and we were just
[1:01:11] really fellowshipping and
[1:01:12] and uh and everything and and um
[1:01:16] and and and it just so happened that
[1:01:18] every service that the family come
[1:01:20] i was never preaching i was never
[1:01:23] preaching
[1:01:24] and they were coming for months and i
[1:01:26] wouldn't we had these alternate services
[1:01:28] and i always preached the alternate
[1:01:29] service
[1:01:30] and the very sunday that they came and i
[1:01:33] preached lord gave me
[1:01:34] a a sermon that just it
[1:01:38] sometime imma just tell all everybody
[1:01:40] sometimes you're going to get a sermon
[1:01:41] here
[1:01:42] that's going to cause you to put you
[1:01:45] bring your toes in
[1:01:47] you understand
[1:01:50] that that's what you know truth is going
[1:01:52] for right when when when you
[1:01:54] when you when when god is coming um
[1:01:59] if i could just use the word actually
[1:02:01] correcting you
[1:02:02] because the bible tells us that who the
[1:02:04] lord loves
[1:02:06] he actually corrects that's what the
[1:02:08] bible tells us right
[1:02:09] so you know i had to bring this sermon
[1:02:11] it was really
[1:02:13] really rough that day really hard you
[1:02:15] know i had to talk about some things
[1:02:16] that
[1:02:17] most churches don't talk about right but
[1:02:20] but i used the bible i wasn't just
[1:02:22] saying it just of my own accord but i
[1:02:24] used the bible to bring this forward and
[1:02:26] and i had a wonderful fellowship with
[1:02:28] the family afterward and i told them
[1:02:29] about this dream and
[1:02:31] and what the dream says that brother
[1:02:33] brother carlos
[1:02:35] representing hispanic uh
[1:02:38] community right brother carlos is in the
[1:02:40] dream and he says i couldn't catch the
[1:02:42] rhythm
[1:02:43] and i say what it is is that they
[1:02:45] couldn't catch the rhythm of the word
[1:02:47] you understand
[1:02:48] couldn't catch the rhythm of the word
[1:02:50] and say but
[1:02:51] sister birds don't play piano
[1:02:56] so about why sister birds in the dream
[1:03:00] if she don't play piano well
[1:03:04] if you notice after um
[1:03:07] after you know some things settled down
[1:03:09] then
[1:03:10] sister blanca came through sister burst
[1:03:15] with sister tabitha
[1:03:18] spiritual things are happening right
[1:03:21] spiritual things are happening and but
[1:03:24] and
[1:03:25] i'm i'm just telling you all this
[1:03:26] because just the birds
[1:03:29] just kind of shared me just a wonderful
[1:03:31] wonderful fellowship that she's had with
[1:03:33] sister blanc and sister tabitha and also
[1:03:35] um sister shanika
[1:03:39] who who who you all have not seen yet
[1:03:43] shanika does watch online and they've
[1:03:47] all worked together they were praying
[1:03:48] together they would you know just doing
[1:03:49] a lot of things together and since birds
[1:03:51] had a chance just to share her
[1:03:52] personal testimony as to how she came to
[1:03:55] this word
[1:03:56] and uh so sister shanika uh who
[1:03:59] who you all haven't seen sister shanika
[1:04:01] and sister blank and sister birds were
[1:04:03] all praying together and
[1:04:04] just sharing the word together and
[1:04:05] sister blanca say i'm go visit she's
[1:04:07] been coming ever since so she's not a
[1:04:08] visitor no more
[1:04:10] amen uh her and tabitha not visitors
[1:04:13] anymore
[1:04:13] you know uh but uh uh they're just part
[1:04:16] of the family
[1:04:17] amen just like sister janice just part
[1:04:19] of the family that's the way we
[1:04:20] we look at it amen
[1:04:24] but you haven't seen sister shanika yet
[1:04:28] but sister shanika is a piano player
[1:04:36] so let's pray right let's pray and um
[1:04:40] let's just uh even even you know the
[1:04:42] family that
[1:04:43] i don't just because they didn't catch
[1:04:46] the rhythm
[1:04:47] they tried and i'm gonna keep praying
[1:04:50] till they come back
[1:04:53] right but it's all spiritual
[1:04:56] oh everything that god don't do stuff
[1:04:58] just just to be doing stuff
[1:05:01] there's there's things happening here
[1:05:03] right and god would give a man in
[1:05:05] i believe honduras is where he's from a
[1:05:07] given man in honduras a dream about our
[1:05:10] church
[1:05:11] i know it's the hand of the lord i want
[1:05:13] to handle the lord so
[1:05:14] regardless of what i hear what i see i
[1:05:17] say the devil's a liar and god is at
[1:05:19] work
[1:05:19] amen god is at work so you know as i you
[1:05:22] know i i
[1:05:23] uh um as we go into things you know
[1:05:26] uh god has given us a man a message that
[1:05:29] we're preaching
[1:05:30] and um you know god sent us a prophet
[1:05:32] and we we pull from
[1:05:34] that prophet we pull inspiration amen
[1:05:36] and and not just inspiration but even
[1:05:38] how is he actually presenting scripture
[1:05:40] to us so that we can understand what the
[1:05:41] scriptures say because you can you can
[1:05:43] you can pick up your bible and and every
[1:05:46] there's so many
[1:05:47] different uh manufacturers of bibles
[1:05:50] and each manufacturer has their own set
[1:05:53] of theologians that they
[1:05:55] are behind and the theologians have
[1:05:57] different thoughts on the scriptures so
[1:05:58] sometimes you can pick up
[1:06:00] uh this bible even though it's a kjv and
[1:06:02] you pick up another vibe
[1:06:03] it's kjv they got different references
[1:06:06] it's because the different theologians
[1:06:07] got different thoughts on the different
[1:06:08] scriptures
[1:06:09] and and sometimes it's very hard to
[1:06:11] follow when you're trying to follow
[1:06:13] theologians
[1:06:14] but i tell you what if you can just ever
[1:06:16] hear a prophet
[1:06:18] you get clarity on scripture and that's
[1:06:21] just where we are we're just
[1:06:22] we're listening to a prophet and we're
[1:06:24] getting clarity from there
[1:06:26] so so i don't want you to be a man
[1:06:28] alarmed we're not
[1:06:29] some strange group of people uh we're
[1:06:32] just we're christians we love the lord
[1:06:34] we believe the bible from genesis to
[1:06:36] revelation
[1:06:38] amen we're not we're not we're not one
[1:06:39] of those churches that that don't even
[1:06:40] preach
[1:06:41] the old testament anymore because they
[1:06:43] say that's old testament
[1:06:45] well thou should not kill is in old
[1:06:47] testament i
[1:06:48] i still believe that thou should not
[1:06:50] commit adultery is in the old testament
[1:06:53] i still believe that
[1:06:54] amen so if god wrote it he wasn't just
[1:06:57] writing it for one time he was writing
[1:06:58] it for all times
[1:07:00] and every generation can actually get
[1:07:02] something out of the word so
[1:07:03] i mean if you if you start taking things
[1:07:06] out of the word of god then you just get
[1:07:08] a real messed up picture
[1:07:10] right so we want to keep it all together
[1:07:12] just believe it from genesis
[1:07:14] to revelation and like one person said
[1:07:16] from cover
[1:07:18] to cover amen stand with me as we read
[1:07:21] the word of the lord on today
[1:07:24] amen i want to read from the book of
[1:07:27] judges chapter 16
[1:07:29] and i also want to read from matthew
[1:07:31] chapter 24.
[1:07:33] praise the lord judges chapter 16
[1:07:37] amen in matthew chapter
[1:07:40] 24 amen amen amen
[1:07:44] uh judges chapter 16 uh very familiar
[1:07:48] passage
[1:07:49] uh that you you have many of you have
[1:07:51] read but i pray that we would make it
[1:07:56] applicable to today amen
[1:07:59] it applies both naturally and
[1:08:02] spiritually
[1:08:03] judges chapter 16 verse 15 says
[1:08:06] and she said unto him how can thou say i
[1:08:09] love thee when thine heart is not with
[1:08:12] me
[1:08:13] thou has mocked me these three times and
[1:08:16] has
[1:08:16] not told me wherein thy great strength
[1:08:19] lieth
[1:08:20] and those of you that are bible readers
[1:08:22] you know this is a story of samson
[1:08:24] and delilah that we're reading we're
[1:08:26] just kind of picking up the the ending
[1:08:28] part of the story
[1:08:30] since it came to pass when she pressed
[1:08:32] him daily
[1:08:33] with her words and urged him so that his
[1:08:36] soul was vexed
[1:08:37] unto death she just kept talking kept
[1:08:41] talking
[1:08:41] and i mean he just couldn't do nothing
[1:08:43] first of all he's some he wasn't
[1:08:44] supposed to be with her
[1:08:46] when he put himself in a in a bad
[1:08:49] position
[1:08:50] amen and and some of us uh and let me
[1:08:52] just
[1:08:53] put it this way brothers and sisters
[1:08:55] everybody got a delilah in their life
[1:08:57] and you need to put yourself in a
[1:08:59] position where delilah
[1:09:01] ain't getting ready to destroy you
[1:09:04] praise the lord amen amen some
[1:09:07] conversations you need to stop having
[1:09:10] all right amen some people you need to
[1:09:14] just stop hanging with
[1:09:15] all right glory to god uh verse 17
[1:09:19] that he told her all his heart
[1:09:22] and said unto her there have not come a
[1:09:24] raise upon my head
[1:09:26] so i have been i have been
[1:09:30] a nazarite unto god from my mother's
[1:09:33] womb now
[1:09:34] all of his guards are dropped all right
[1:09:36] i i i was a christian
[1:09:38] i was i used to be nine i ain't that no
[1:09:42] more
[1:09:43] because you kept hanging around the
[1:09:44] wrong places
[1:09:46] man he told her all all his harp
[1:09:50] and said in her there have not come a
[1:09:52] raise upon my head for i have been an
[1:09:54] azerite unto god from my mother's womb
[1:09:56] if i be shaven then my strength will go
[1:10:00] from me
[1:10:00] and i shall become weak and be like any
[1:10:03] other man
[1:10:04] that gave up the secret and when delilah
[1:10:08] saw
[1:10:08] that he had told her all his heart she
[1:10:12] sent and called for the lords of the
[1:10:13] philistines saying
[1:10:15] come up this once for he have showed me
[1:10:18] all his heart
[1:10:18] then the lords of the philistines came
[1:10:20] up under her philistines
[1:10:22] uh uh came under her and brought money
[1:10:26] in their hand
[1:10:28] my god wow he thought it was all about
[1:10:30] love this lady was getting paid
[1:10:34] and you think it's all about love hey
[1:10:36] man
[1:10:37] somebody getting ready to reap some
[1:10:39] benefits
[1:10:41] and she made him sleep upon her knees
[1:10:46] and she called for a man
[1:10:49] and she calls him to shave off the seven
[1:10:51] locks of his head and she began to
[1:10:53] afflict him that i think that's
[1:10:55] something she if she afflicted him
[1:10:57] right she began to afflict him and his
[1:10:59] strength went from him
[1:11:01] and she said the philistines be upon
[1:11:03] thee samson and he awoke out of his
[1:11:05] sleep
[1:11:06] and said i will go out as at other times
[1:11:08] before
[1:11:09] and shake myself
[1:11:12] and he wished not that the lord was
[1:11:16] departed from him
[1:11:18] hallelujah but the philistines took him
[1:11:21] and put out his eyes
[1:11:23] and bound him with fetters of brass and
[1:11:26] he did ground in the prison house
[1:11:29] how be it the hair of his head began to
[1:11:31] grow again
[1:11:32] after he was shaving
[1:11:36] all right let's uh turn to matthew 24.
[1:11:44] brother troy actually was reading from
[1:11:46] matthew 24 on last week and
[1:11:49] and i was enjoying how he was saying
[1:11:53] as jesus was giving them these three
[1:11:56] um they were they asked him three
[1:11:58] questions he was given the answers and
[1:12:00] matthew 24 just kind of goes through
[1:12:02] what those answers are um
[1:12:06] the disciples went to him privately
[1:12:09] and began to ask questions to get a
[1:12:12] better understanding as to what he was
[1:12:13] saying
[1:12:14] and and i think that's key um don't just
[1:12:17] go to the internet
[1:12:19] to try to get answers but but but but
[1:12:22] but
[1:12:23] go to god's representative right i mean
[1:12:26] if anybody have questions on anything we
[1:12:28] preach uh
[1:12:29] please you know i'm i'm available i i
[1:12:32] mean
[1:12:33] if you want to sit down and have dinner
[1:12:34] i'll pay for it you can ask as many
[1:12:37] questions as you want
[1:12:38] i want to help people right so uh but we
[1:12:42] just just privately it's just how you
[1:12:44] get answers to things
[1:12:46] you know so if there's anything that's
[1:12:48] preached from this pulpit that you don't
[1:12:49] understand
[1:12:50] please know that we are available i'm
[1:12:52] not i i'm not one of them pastors that
[1:12:55] you know i leave here and can't be
[1:12:56] touched amen
[1:12:59] praise the lord some churches you can't
[1:13:02] talk to the pastor you got to get an
[1:13:05] appointment and all kind of stuff
[1:13:06] and amen and then they have another
[1:13:08] pastor that don't even preach to you
[1:13:10] they make him talk to you
[1:13:12] praise the lord all right but uh
[1:13:15] that's that's not this kind of church
[1:13:17] amen
[1:13:18] everybody here got access to me
[1:13:21] amen everybody got access to me amen
[1:13:24] and sometimes i might not be able to
[1:13:26] take the call right then but i don't
[1:13:27] think there's not one person i ain't got
[1:13:29] back to
[1:13:31] amen praise the lord and if i have to
[1:13:34] drive to you
[1:13:36] i'll drive to you amen
[1:13:41] all right
[1:13:46] he came back yo
[1:13:52] matthew 24 24 is where i want to read
[1:13:56] for there shall arise jesus is telling
[1:14:00] us to be careful here
[1:14:01] so there shall arise false christ that
[1:14:04] means false
[1:14:05] anointed people false people
[1:14:09] amen but notice the christ capital
[1:14:12] christ
[1:14:12] oh lord happen this is what i want you
[1:14:15] to understand is that they are anointed
[1:14:17] by the genuine
[1:14:19] holy ghost
[1:14:23] you know rain falls on both the just
[1:14:26] and the unjust so i don't want you to
[1:14:29] get confused when you see rain falling
[1:14:31] unadjusted unjust and
[1:14:32] what about them they got this they got
[1:14:34] no no no no no we we're going to get to
[1:14:36] all that
[1:14:37] amen but i want to understand according
[1:14:39] to scripture
[1:14:40] that the anointing amen is supposed to
[1:14:43] be on false christs
[1:14:44] false anointed ones right for there
[1:14:46] shall arise false christs
[1:14:48] and false prophets now wait let's stop
[1:14:50] there because people will always kind of
[1:14:52] let me let me just read
[1:14:54] uh for that show uh additional rhymes
[1:14:56] false christ and false prophets and
[1:14:57] shall show great signs and wonders
[1:14:59] and so much that if it were possible
[1:15:04] they shall receive the very lake let's
[1:15:05] pray let's pray
[1:15:07] father i just thank you for your word i
[1:15:10] thank you for what you've spoken to us i
[1:15:12] trust that the holy spirit will help us
[1:15:14] to
[1:15:14] understand what it is that the spirit is
[1:15:16] speaking
[1:15:18] god that we could apply for right now
[1:15:20] that we wouldn't miss
[1:15:21] oh god what you're saying i pray that
[1:15:24] every ear
[1:15:26] that is hearing the word of god that god
[1:15:28] they would draw closer to you through
[1:15:30] revelation and understanding he told us
[1:15:33] and all i get and get understanding so
[1:15:35] lord speak to us
[1:15:36] amen this morning so in jesus name we
[1:15:38] ask it
[1:15:40] amen amen praise the lord
[1:15:44] the scripture
[1:15:47] we'll just read it again there matthew
[1:15:49] 24 24.
[1:15:52] the scripture has been something that i
[1:15:54] have
[1:15:55] a man rested on it's a scripture that
[1:16:00] uh that brings me comfort it's a
[1:16:03] scripture that um that i can
[1:16:06] tie myself to and realize that
[1:16:09] ain't nothing gonna happen to me
[1:16:12] praise the lord amen and and and i wanna
[1:16:16] i wanna give this to
[1:16:17] you know those that are watching us
[1:16:19] online those that are new to the
[1:16:20] ministry
[1:16:21] amen this is a scripture i want you to
[1:16:23] tie yourself down to
[1:16:25] i mean absolutely tie yourself i mean
[1:16:27] there's things that
[1:16:28] that you'll hear at this church that you
[1:16:31] want here at other places
[1:16:32] amen and and that's fine that's fine you
[1:16:35] know there's a reason for all of that
[1:16:36] and
[1:16:37] and i wasn't born into this i come from
[1:16:39] a baptist background and also a little
[1:16:40] pentecostal background
[1:16:42] i had all of that in my background amen
[1:16:44] but uh but then one day god brought me
[1:16:46] to the truth
[1:16:47] god brought me to the word and and i
[1:16:49] began to understand some things you know
[1:16:51] it wasn't just about a
[1:16:52] a preacher grabbing his ear and making a
[1:16:54] shout because he could sing a little bit
[1:16:56] amen it wasn't about somebody just
[1:16:57] running around the church and just you
[1:16:59] know uh speaking in tongues and
[1:17:01] and and one living right come on
[1:17:03] somebody we know that's the truth
[1:17:05] i mean you're speaking in tongues but
[1:17:06] you ain't living right amen so
[1:17:08] something wrong with this and it was a
[1:17:10] genuine holy ghost that was on the
[1:17:12] people but
[1:17:12] you know we got we got to come to a spot
[1:17:14] where i want i want i want i want the
[1:17:16] spirit
[1:17:17] but i also want truth too i want them
[1:17:18] both amen so
[1:17:20] you know when we look at this scripture
[1:17:22] amen verse 24 matthew 24 24 this is
[1:17:25] something i want you to tie yourself to
[1:17:27] for there shall arise false christ
[1:17:30] that means false anointed ones will
[1:17:33] be on the scene amen right before jesus
[1:17:37] comes the second time
[1:17:38] hallelujah false christ will arise and
[1:17:41] notice what else he says
[1:17:43] and false prophets
[1:17:47] hallelujah i need for you to understand
[1:17:50] that yes there will be false prophets
[1:17:52] but in order to have something false or
[1:17:54] to have something
[1:17:56] fake then you must have at least one
[1:17:58] thing that's
[1:17:59] real praise god if you go
[1:18:02] amen make some fake dollars you got to
[1:18:05] make the fake dollar
[1:18:06] from a real dollar glory to god so amen
[1:18:09] often times what the devil wants to do
[1:18:11] is point out
[1:18:12] false false false but what i'm looking
[1:18:14] for is where's the real thing
[1:18:17] oh hallelujah and i'm here to tell you
[1:18:19] coke ain't it
[1:18:21] coke ain't the real thing but jesus
[1:18:24] christ
[1:18:25] is the real thing hallelujah and
[1:18:28] and the way that you got to know him is
[1:18:30] through his word
[1:18:32] all right look at this amen the bible
[1:18:34] tells us for there shall arise false
[1:18:36] christs and false prophets
[1:18:37] and shall show great signs and wonders
[1:18:40] there's going to be tremendous
[1:18:41] manifestations in their life
[1:18:43] but i love this part this is what i've
[1:18:45] rest my my soul on this is what i got
[1:18:48] confidence in
[1:18:49] amen it says in so much that if it were
[1:18:52] possible they shall deceive
[1:18:55] the very elect and what i found out a
[1:18:58] man that assets i
[1:19:00] am elect that's my testimony i don't
[1:19:03] know about yours
[1:19:04] since i am elect
[1:19:08] i cannot be deceived and and you have to
[1:19:11] have the same confidence in the word of
[1:19:13] god for yourself you ought to say
[1:19:15] since i am elect i cannot be deceived
[1:19:22] y'all want to say that with me say it
[1:19:24] like that
[1:19:25] since i am elect i cannot be deceived
[1:19:31] so the title of the sermon is impossible
[1:19:34] deception
[1:19:38] impossible deception
[1:19:43] let me just start with this amen out of
[1:19:45] the revelation of jesus christ this
[1:19:47] little thought here coming out of the
[1:19:48] church age book
[1:19:50] um god's prophet makes a statement says
[1:19:53] now remember
[1:19:54] this christ in the true church is a
[1:19:58] continuation
[1:20:00] hallelujah glory to god
[1:20:03] amen christ in the true church is
[1:20:06] a continuation of the book of
[1:20:09] acts but the book of revelation shows
[1:20:13] how that and how that the antichrist
[1:20:16] spirit oh my would come
[1:20:20] into the church amen
[1:20:23] and defile it making it lukewarm
[1:20:28] formal and powerless oh
[1:20:31] my my my my see brother troy started
[1:20:34] working with that he read the scripture
[1:20:35] out of revelation 12 how the devil had
[1:20:37] come
[1:20:38] down out of heaven now he had a purpose
[1:20:40] and i'm going to try to read to you
[1:20:42] amen what his purpose was but he come
[1:20:44] down out of heaven
[1:20:46] and i want to tell you what began as
[1:20:48] angel
[1:20:49] warfare
[1:20:52] has now come into the earth and you are
[1:20:55] part of the war
[1:20:57] this is why the brother was saying wars
[1:20:59] and rumors of what we all looking at
[1:21:01] amen this nation and that nation
[1:21:03] but as he said you are a holy nation and
[1:21:06] the devil's coming after you
[1:21:09] oh hallelujah yo you yeah and you got to
[1:21:12] reload your weapon with what with the
[1:21:14] word of god
[1:21:16] you must understand your position with
[1:21:18] the word of god
[1:21:20] hallelujah brother i know where i stand
[1:21:23] ain't no sense no devil coming to me
[1:21:25] and and i i i i'm standing on i can't be
[1:21:27] deceived
[1:21:30] impossible for me to be deceived amen i
[1:21:32] know this says something i never heard
[1:21:34] before but i can't be deceived
[1:21:36] praise the lord amen if there was
[1:21:39] anything deceptive about this message i
[1:21:42] believe god would take me out of it
[1:21:44] if it was deceptive because i'm elect
[1:21:48] and i can't be deceived
[1:21:51] hallelujah but i'm not i wouldn't leave
[1:21:53] based on feelings and emotions and i'm
[1:21:56] gonna tell you
[1:21:56] why i believe the message the way i
[1:21:58] believe it because i can see things
[1:22:01] in scripture all right let me go on
[1:22:04] let me go on glory glory glory
[1:22:08] it says the book of revelation shows how
[1:22:10] that the antichrist spirit
[1:22:12] would come into the church and defile it
[1:22:14] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[1:22:16] it exposes satan revealing his works
[1:22:19] attempted destruction of god's people
[1:22:23] and the discrediting of god's word
[1:22:26] so the way the devil tries to destroy is
[1:22:28] by trying to discredit the word of god
[1:22:31] hallelujah when you see somebody coming
[1:22:35] against something god
[1:22:36] wrote i didn't put that there
[1:22:40] god put that there when jesus himself
[1:22:43] said
[1:22:43] that elias has come he said they said i
[1:22:46] sent you
[1:22:47] elias has come amen and they've done to
[1:22:50] him whatever they they were supposed to
[1:22:51] do he said but i
[1:22:52] also say eli shall come and restore all
[1:22:55] things
[1:22:57] jesus spoke of this ministry coming
[1:23:00] jesus himself so now we got to find out
[1:23:02] what it what is this what does this mean
[1:23:04] it's prophecy from jesus himself
[1:23:08] don't let the word of god be discredited
[1:23:10] he says right down to the time he's cast
[1:23:12] into the lake of fire he fights that
[1:23:14] he cannot stand it he knows that if the
[1:23:18] people get the true
[1:23:21] revelation of
[1:23:25] the true church hallelujah
[1:23:28] and what she is because see there's a
[1:23:30] true church and there's a false church
[1:23:32] but you got to get a revelation of the
[1:23:34] true church amen
[1:23:35] and what she is what she stands
[1:23:39] for amen for for
[1:23:42] and that she can do the greater works
[1:23:45] amen she will be an
[1:23:48] invincible army can't be defeated army
[1:23:51] amen
[1:23:52] if they get a true revelation of the and
[1:23:54] this is this is important right here
[1:23:55] if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:23:57] spirits
[1:23:59] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:24:02] two spirits within the framework of the
[1:24:04] christian church and by god's spirit
[1:24:07] discern and withstand now that's the key
[1:24:10] that's that's that's critical not only
[1:24:13] do you have to get a revelation that is
[1:24:14] two spirits at work
[1:24:16] there's a spirit trying to pull you into
[1:24:18] false and there's a spirit also trying
[1:24:20] to pull you into truth
[1:24:22] hallelujah amen and you gotta be able to
[1:24:25] discern between these spirits
[1:24:27] and the only way you can discern between
[1:24:29] the spirits is you have to keep them on
[1:24:31] the word
[1:24:33] i'ma tell you something a dream ain't
[1:24:35] gonna get it
[1:24:37] come on hey man a good feeling ain't
[1:24:39] gonna get it
[1:24:40] but you're gonna have to keep you the
[1:24:42] only way you can discern them spirits is
[1:24:44] by
[1:24:44] taking them back to the word of god do
[1:24:47] you realize
[1:24:48] jesus defeated the devil with it
[1:24:51] it's written and the way you're going to
[1:24:53] defeat a devil
[1:24:55] is with it is written
[1:24:58] let me go on by god's spirit discerning
[1:25:01] withstanding antichrist spirit satan
[1:25:02] will be powerless before her
[1:25:04] he will be as definitely thwarted today
[1:25:06] as when christ will send us every effort
[1:25:08] to gain power over him
[1:25:09] in the desert yes satan hates revelation
[1:25:12] but we love it
[1:25:13] with true revelation in our lives the
[1:25:15] gates of hell cannot prevail against us
[1:25:17] but we will prevail over them
[1:25:20] now i i i'm putting this here because uh
[1:25:24] you know scripture just kind of tells us
[1:25:26] that it was impossible
[1:25:27] that the very let could be deceived
[1:25:30] impossible
[1:25:30] so we're living in an age where where
[1:25:33] folk
[1:25:34] are being deceived we're living in an
[1:25:36] age
[1:25:37] of deception now i want to just just try
[1:25:40] to give you
[1:25:41] a definition here of the word deception
[1:25:44] uh deception is an act or statement
[1:25:49] which misleads
[1:25:52] deception is an act or statement
[1:25:55] which misleads not only that deception
[1:25:59] is something that hides the truth
[1:26:06] let me just deception
[1:26:09] actually hides the truth
[1:26:13] but here i'm giving you scripture i'm
[1:26:15] not trying to
[1:26:16] hide nothing i'm trying to show
[1:26:19] something
[1:26:20] amen deception comes when somebody's
[1:26:22] trying to hide the truth we're not
[1:26:24] trying to hide anything from anybody
[1:26:26] oh hallelujah so i can tell you the
[1:26:29] spirit of deception is not at work here
[1:26:32] praise god amen amen if you're trying to
[1:26:36] discern deception here you're discerning
[1:26:38] the wrong thing we're trying to
[1:26:39] share truth not high truth
[1:26:44] look at this deceptions are act a
[1:26:46] statement which misleads
[1:26:48] deception tries to hide the truth uh
[1:26:51] uh uh just another thing i'm gonna just
[1:26:53] give you a definition
[1:26:54] deception promotes a belief or concept
[1:26:57] or an idea that is not true
[1:27:00] my god and the reason that they promote
[1:27:02] a belief a concept or idea that's not
[1:27:04] true
[1:27:05] because they're doing it for personal
[1:27:07] gain
[1:27:10] oh hallelujah all right let's keep on
[1:27:12] going i want you to understand something
[1:27:14] when he said
[1:27:15] uh discern the two spirits within the
[1:27:17] church and by god's spirit
[1:27:18] um you know you're gonna have to you
[1:27:20] gotta be able to discern it
[1:27:22] catch what what the devil's doing and
[1:27:23] and what god's doing discern those two
[1:27:25] spirits that's at work
[1:27:26] and i want you to understand something
[1:27:27] about the antichrist spirit
[1:27:30] amen brother brandon made a step and
[1:27:31] says the antichrist spirit is not
[1:27:33] the communistic spirit he says the
[1:27:36] antichrist spirit is a religious spirit
[1:27:40] religious so when we talk about
[1:27:43] discernment you
[1:27:44] have to catch it from a religious angle
[1:27:46] don't look don't look at the political
[1:27:48] angles
[1:27:48] religious religious religious religious
[1:27:51] the antichrist spirit
[1:27:52] is not the communistic spirit the
[1:27:54] antichrist spirit is a religious
[1:27:56] spirit now um as i just kind of looked
[1:27:59] at this
[1:28:00] oh my give me uh let me let me go to
[1:28:02] spoken words original seed i want to
[1:28:04] just kind of set this up before i go
[1:28:05] deeper in this
[1:28:08] this is where the angel of the lord is
[1:28:10] telling the prophet pick up his pen and
[1:28:12] write and he wrote these things out
[1:28:14] and uh and he just kind of drops dropped
[1:28:15] some things in here so i'm just kind of
[1:28:17] picking up what the
[1:28:18] what the angel was saying to us it's
[1:28:20] something that we just we're going to
[1:28:21] try to feast on here today
[1:28:22] here in this message spoken words
[1:28:24] original says spoke spoken words
[1:28:25] originally says remember moses
[1:28:28] born for the work had to wait on god for
[1:28:31] the extra gift for the job
[1:28:33] he had to go back and wait for the time
[1:28:35] appointed by god and we preached that a
[1:28:37] few weeks ago
[1:28:38] waiting for the appointed time he says a
[1:28:40] certain pharaoh had to be on the throne
[1:28:42] and the people had to be warning the
[1:28:43] bread of life before god could send him
[1:28:46] back
[1:28:47] amen oh can i let me just inject
[1:28:50] something there
[1:28:51] you know the reason that many of us are
[1:28:53] in the place that we're in today days
[1:28:55] because we got to a point in our
[1:28:56] spiritual walk where we wanted more
[1:29:01] we got to import in our spiritual where
[1:29:03] we were frustrated with what we had
[1:29:05] and the reason that you want it more
[1:29:09] it's because there was actually more
[1:29:11] [Music]
[1:29:13] come on somebody hey man you you can't
[1:29:16] long for nothing that's not
[1:29:18] dead right if if a man there was a
[1:29:21] a a a a a statement that was made amen
[1:29:24] if a man is is longing for water if a
[1:29:28] man is
[1:29:28] thirsting for water hallelujah it's a
[1:29:31] couple of things that happen
[1:29:33] either he don't have water before and he
[1:29:36] know what water can do for him
[1:29:38] amen or if he hasn't had it there's
[1:29:40] something in his body it caused him to
[1:29:42] crave for
[1:29:43] and and and if there's a deep calling
[1:29:45] out to a deep
[1:29:47] praise god there must be a deep
[1:29:50] somewhere to respond can i tell you
[1:29:52] something
[1:29:52] you don't come here by accident you
[1:29:55] don't come here by chance
[1:29:57] you come by predestination
[1:30:00] god don't make no mistakes hallelujah
[1:30:03] it's because you want it more so
[1:30:06] god has more for you and you can never
[1:30:09] exhaust god
[1:30:13] hallelujah i'm still desiring more
[1:30:17] then been holding on to this for a
[1:30:19] number of years but i'm still desiring
[1:30:20] more
[1:30:21] and there's more for me to have glory to
[1:30:24] god glory to god
[1:30:26] amen the people had to be wanting the
[1:30:28] bread of life before god could send them
[1:30:29] back
[1:30:30] it says now now with thousands of sign
[1:30:33] workers in this last day
[1:30:36] has created a generation of sign seekers
[1:30:40] that know and this is the problem they
[1:30:42] sign seekers
[1:30:43] but they know that knows no more nothing
[1:30:47] about a true move of god
[1:30:49] and his word in the last days as i said
[1:30:52] give them blood and oil
[1:30:53] and fleshly demonstrations on the
[1:30:55] platform they'll support it
[1:30:57] whether it's god's word or not
[1:31:01] listen hallelujah whether it's
[1:31:03] scriptural or not
[1:31:04] jesus have warned us of such things at
[1:31:09] the end time
[1:31:10] in matthew 24 two spirits very close to
[1:31:13] like
[1:31:14] deceived the very elect
[1:31:20] if possible but i'm telling it's
[1:31:23] impossible deception
[1:31:26] because i'm very lucky i can't be
[1:31:27] deceived i'm telling i rested when i
[1:31:29] when i just read that in the bible
[1:31:31] matthew 24 24
[1:31:33] is something that i could just drop all
[1:31:35] my weight on
[1:31:36] god i ain't concerned god i know you
[1:31:38] love me
[1:31:39] i know you will not allow me to be
[1:31:41] intentionally deceived i know you won't
[1:31:43] do that
[1:31:44] amen because you you said that very let
[1:31:46] will not be deceived but as i look at
[1:31:48] all that scripture
[1:31:49] everybody the foster foster father well
[1:31:51] i i get it yes jesus said it's going to
[1:31:53] be false but in order for it to be
[1:31:55] false there has to be at least one truth
[1:31:58] now now point me where true true true
[1:32:02] and most of them can't point to the true
[1:32:04] true truth but they can talk about false
[1:32:05] false false
[1:32:06] but where's true true true hallelujah
[1:32:11] i said like this if this ain't that
[1:32:14] i'ma keep this until that come
[1:32:18] on y'all need to bring some pens and
[1:32:22] papers and just write things down if
[1:32:24] this
[1:32:24] ain't that i'ma keep this
[1:32:27] until that come glory to god
[1:32:32] i'm going on how can you tell them
[1:32:36] how can you how can you tell these two
[1:32:37] spirits apart how can you tell
[1:32:39] give them the word test
[1:32:43] and that's important to me that's that
[1:32:45] that that that says
[1:32:46] not your emotions test don't give it
[1:32:50] your feelings tests
[1:32:51] don't give it your dream or your vision
[1:32:53] test give it the word
[1:32:55] test hallelujah give them
[1:32:59] the word test glory how can you know it
[1:33:03] speak in the word see what they say
[1:33:06] about it just give them scriptures see
[1:33:08] what they say about it
[1:33:09] if they don't believe the word they have
[1:33:11] no
[1:33:12] seed germ in them
[1:33:16] oh i'm these are heavy quotes but it's
[1:33:18] got to be said if they can't believe the
[1:33:20] word
[1:33:21] they ain't gonna believe nothing amen
[1:33:23] hallelujah
[1:33:24] amen says uh they have no sea germ in
[1:33:26] them they are
[1:33:27] up the evil one and and deceive you
[1:33:31] if they can't receive the word they're
[1:33:32] of the evil one and deceive you
[1:33:34] as the first bride was deceived and the
[1:33:38] second bride
[1:33:39] was deceived there are deceivers of the
[1:33:41] third bride
[1:33:43] oh lord jesus i want to talk about that
[1:33:46] today
[1:33:47] the first bride was deceived amen the
[1:33:50] second bribe
[1:33:52] was deceived they are deceivers of the
[1:33:55] third bride and how do they deceive them
[1:33:57] by high breeding the word or trying to
[1:34:01] trying to hide breed a word god never
[1:34:03] placed signs ahead of his word
[1:34:06] god never placed signs ahead of his word
[1:34:09] they were added for
[1:34:10] proof of the words amen but the word
[1:34:14] is first
[1:34:18] oh hallelujah church i feel so good this
[1:34:21] morning
[1:34:22] the word has got to be first see
[1:34:25] the reason that we i i believe this
[1:34:27] prophet that god's saying is because
[1:34:28] i saw in the bible where god promised
[1:34:31] that he was going to do this
[1:34:32] amen the reason that i can believe john
[1:34:35] the baptist is who he is is because i
[1:34:37] saw in the bible
[1:34:38] where god promised it i'ma say something
[1:34:42] here
[1:34:44] show me one scripture where god promised
[1:34:46] to send paul
[1:34:51] but i believe paul
[1:34:54] but there's not one scripture in the old
[1:34:56] testament where god promised to send
[1:34:59] paul the man that wrote two-thirds
[1:35:01] of the new testament but yet i believe
[1:35:04] it god vindicated his ministry and i
[1:35:06] believe
[1:35:06] he didn't even walk with jesus
[1:35:09] he wasn't even one of the disciples of
[1:35:11] jesus but yet god used his ministry and
[1:35:14] if we got faith
[1:35:15] oh hallelujah if we got faith in
[1:35:19] somebody that god didn't even promise to
[1:35:20] sin
[1:35:27] we got faith in somebody that god didn't
[1:35:29] even promise to sin
[1:35:31] why can't we have faith in who god
[1:35:33] promised to sin
[1:35:34] according to scripture
[1:35:40] all right
[1:35:44] that god never plays signs ahead of his
[1:35:46] word right because you know it's not
[1:35:48] about the signs and wonders but god uses
[1:35:50] that to track the attention of the
[1:35:51] people
[1:35:52] right but once he has your attention
[1:35:54] then he wants to share with you his word
[1:35:56] amen praise the lord glory to god uh
[1:36:00] a a young man who and a young lady he
[1:36:02] might buy a few gifts in here but
[1:36:04] at some point time he wanted to sit down
[1:36:06] and listen to what he's trying to say
[1:36:08] amen what if he can't buy a gift
[1:36:12] you're still going to love him what what
[1:36:15] if the man lose his job
[1:36:17] hmm you're still going to love him i
[1:36:20] mean not now he can't
[1:36:21] he can't work no more and and he can't
[1:36:23] get you the things that he used to get
[1:36:25] to where
[1:36:25] what what happens to the relationship
[1:36:27] then see because
[1:36:28] if a young lady is only caught up on the
[1:36:31] gifts come on
[1:36:32] and when i talk about young lady i'm
[1:36:33] talking about the church
[1:36:36] if the church is only caught up on the
[1:36:39] gifts what about when there is no gift
[1:36:42] do you still love jesus when there is no
[1:36:46] gift in place
[1:36:48] see see the gift is just just extra
[1:36:51] hallelujah
[1:36:52] but but you got i mean a young man want
[1:36:54] to make sure that he's in a relationship
[1:36:56] and the lord jesus wants to make sure
[1:36:59] he's in a relationship
[1:37:00] with a bride with a church that'll love
[1:37:02] him in spite of gifts
[1:37:04] i came to this conclusion a long time
[1:37:06] ago if god don't do one more thing for
[1:37:08] me
[1:37:09] he's done enough for me to praise him
[1:37:11] for the rest of my days
[1:37:15] can you love him when there is no gift
[1:37:19] nothing i mean i don't see nothing i
[1:37:21] don't see this see because
[1:37:22] sometimes that's all people looking for
[1:37:24] us gifts gives gifts now don't get me
[1:37:26] wrong
[1:37:26] every gift that was promised in the
[1:37:28] bible i believe should be in the church
[1:37:30] but i don't believe everybody gonna have

[1:38:37] if i can't if i don't do things that way
[1:38:39] i know god is much smarter than i am
[1:38:46] look at this god never played signs
[1:38:48] ahead of his word
[1:38:50] they were added for proof of the word
[1:38:52] but the word is first
[1:38:54] to prove it elijah said to the woman now
[1:38:56] this is before she got her miracle
[1:38:58] he said he said to the woman bake me a
[1:39:00] cake first
[1:39:01] then watch the miracle happen
[1:39:04] i love that statement bake me because
[1:39:06] you know this lady was in a situation
[1:39:08] let me finish reading this this
[1:39:10] says come to the word first and then
[1:39:11] watch the miracle the seed word itself
[1:39:13] is what the holy spirit energizes now
[1:39:16] you know this this lady was looking for
[1:39:17] a miracle
[1:39:18] she needed it real bad she needed it
[1:39:22] real bad i mean they were in a famine
[1:39:23] time
[1:39:24] and um and here god sends the prophet to
[1:39:27] this lady's house
[1:39:29] and when he gets there uh to the hou god
[1:39:31] in order to say i have ordained for her
[1:39:33] to sustain you through this famine
[1:39:36] can i tell you something there's certain
[1:39:37] places that you must go
[1:39:40] oh i'm gonna say that again in certain
[1:39:44] places that you
[1:39:45] must go if you want to be sustained
[1:39:50] the prophet couldn't just go anywhere he
[1:39:53] could
[1:39:53] go to somebody else's house that you
[1:39:55] know you know they said they said go to
[1:39:56] the house where there's a lot of kids
[1:39:58] because
[1:39:58] typically there's a lot of food in a
[1:40:00] place like that that's not where god
[1:40:02] told that prophet to go
[1:40:03] he said there's a woman amen there's a
[1:40:06] woman there
[1:40:07] i mean uh no no husband at home she got
[1:40:10] one son a husband maybe passed away
[1:40:11] stuff she got one son
[1:40:12] i want you going to that widow woman's
[1:40:15] house i have ordained that the widow
[1:40:17] woman
[1:40:18] will sustain you and i want you to
[1:40:21] understand something the widow woman had
[1:40:23] nothing to sustain him with
[1:40:29] but i'm ordained for the widowed woman
[1:40:31] to sustain you
[1:40:32] and when he gets there and starts having
[1:40:34] a conversation with the widow woman he
[1:40:35] said go give me some water
[1:40:37] well you know what that's about the only
[1:40:39] thing we got around here i can get you
[1:40:40] some of that
[1:40:42] we got some water so here he goes some
[1:40:44] water for you you know i'm gonna go get
[1:40:45] that
[1:40:46] and she's on her way to go get water and
[1:40:49] he's saying also
[1:40:51] now you pushing your luck right here i
[1:40:53] mean you realize it's a famine in the
[1:40:55] land
[1:40:56] right and and and they say also if you
[1:40:58] don't mind
[1:40:59] bake me a cake first she say uh now uh
[1:41:04] i i ain't got but this much more meal
[1:41:07] and this much more of this and
[1:41:08] you know i ain't got that many agree to
[1:41:10] say and what my plan was is that i was
[1:41:12] gonna bake this
[1:41:14] for my son because he's about to die
[1:41:16] inside the house
[1:41:17] he's about to die so i'm gonna give it
[1:41:18] to him first and both of us gonna die
[1:41:20] together this was that was my plan he
[1:41:22] said he said he said he said yeah yeah
[1:41:24] i got your plan but but before you give
[1:41:26] it to your son just give me one first
[1:41:32] and then he said some famous words
[1:41:35] that every believer like hearing if
[1:41:38] you're a believer you huh
[1:41:39] you love these words right here
[1:41:42] they say they say beg me one first and
[1:41:45] thus
[1:41:46] saith the lord that
[1:41:49] changes things even god himself knew
[1:41:52] that once that lady
[1:41:53] heard those key words she would be able
[1:41:57] to sustain that prophet
[1:42:00] you bake me a cake first and i guarantee
[1:42:02] you thus saith the lord your crews will
[1:42:04] not go empty in your barrel won't run
[1:42:06] dry
[1:42:07] thus saith the lord
[1:42:14] and when she went back i i could imagine
[1:42:18] her
[1:42:19] you know some of us the way we would go
[1:42:20] back we'd go look inside
[1:42:22] and see what's in there and while you're
[1:42:25] looking like that you won't see nothing
[1:42:27] but if you just take your cup
[1:42:32] not even looking at it just
[1:42:35] put it in i guarantee when you pull it
[1:42:37] up you're gonna have something in there
[1:42:40] and that lady was sustained through that
[1:42:43] famine because she obeyed
[1:42:45] the word she saw miracles because she
[1:42:48] obeyed
[1:42:49] the word if you want to see a miracle
[1:42:52] amen you must obey the word of god
[1:42:58] jesus made a statement because they had
[1:43:01] a problem with his ministry they had a
[1:43:03] problem with his teachings they had a
[1:43:04] problem with all kind of stuff in john

[1:43:10] just give you 539
[1:43:11] um but you can and john in the book of
[1:43:14] john he just had all kind of problems
[1:43:15] with the
[1:43:16] the pharisees and sadducees and but john
[1:43:18] 5 39 jesus gave them
[1:43:20] a statement he says y'all got problems

[1:43:36] john 5 39 and this is what i want to
[1:43:38] tell you anytime there's a question that
[1:43:39] comes up with amen

[1:43:54] you search the scriptures then you'll
[1:43:55] get an answer
[1:43:56] god himself speak of certain things
[1:43:58] happening and we're watching those
[1:44:00] things unfold
[1:44:01] hallelujah glory to god let me uh let me
[1:44:04] just kind of uh
[1:44:05] give you another quick definition see in
[1:44:07] matthew 24 24 it says
[1:44:09] if it were possible they shall deceive
[1:44:11] the very lack now uh i looked i just
[1:44:13] kind of clicked on that to get the greek
[1:44:14] lexicon
[1:44:15] uh definition of that and what what what
[1:44:17] uh deceive
[1:44:19] is is to to air to
[1:44:22] go astray to seduce
[1:44:25] to wander a man to be out of the way
[1:44:30] praise the lord amen to be led astray
[1:44:33] led aside
[1:44:34] from the right way uh to roam about
[1:44:37] um they also say what deceived me is to
[1:44:40] be led away from
[1:44:41] the truth to lead into error to deceive
[1:44:44] to be led into error
[1:44:46] uh to be led aside from the path of
[1:44:48] virtue to go astray
[1:44:50] amen it's to sin it's to sever fall away
[1:44:54] from the truth
[1:44:55] of heretic uh uh heretics uh to be led
[1:44:58] away into the era and sin these are some
[1:45:01] of the definitions of
[1:45:02] of what uh deceive is and and i'm and
[1:45:05] i'm
[1:45:05] and what i'm telling you is that it's
[1:45:07] it's an impossible deception because
[1:45:09] i i guarantee there's a group of people
[1:45:12] and i believe i'm preaching to them this
[1:45:14] morning
[1:45:14] that they will not be led away into sin
[1:45:17] they will not be led away into error no
[1:45:20] matter what the devil presents to him
[1:45:22] this group of people
[1:45:23] is ordained of god never to be led away
[1:45:28] and i want to i want to i want to give
[1:45:30] you good news if you are ordained of god
[1:45:33] to never be led or astray or let away
[1:45:35] from the word of god
[1:45:36] then there's nothing the devil can do to
[1:45:38] that can upset you
[1:45:41] nothing it's because i'm ordained for
[1:45:45] this
[1:45:46] i'm called to this i was made for this
[1:45:49] i was born for this can't be led astray
[1:45:54] impossible deception that's something
[1:45:58] now i thought about
[1:46:02] just deception and scripture and and
[1:46:04] there's a number
[1:46:05] you know just a number of different
[1:46:06] incidents because this this deception is
[1:46:09] something that
[1:46:09] started way in heaven right satan
[1:46:12] started this this whole trick of
[1:46:13] deceiving and
[1:46:14] he deceived two-thirds of the angels you
[1:46:17] know
[1:46:18] and and that devil that devil that that
[1:46:20] was fruit that devil's rude
[1:46:22] i want to uh just kind of bring
[1:46:25] amen something in if i can
[1:46:28] uh very let's look at isaiah 14.
[1:46:32] this thing started way in heaven the
[1:46:34] deception
[1:46:36] amen that the devil is using glory
[1:46:40] and what you got to see is that he he
[1:46:42] brought what
[1:46:43] what was in heaven he actually brought
[1:46:45] it down to the earth
[1:46:47] and and the spears that we're fighting
[1:46:49] the battle that we're
[1:46:50] that that's raging even right now the
[1:46:52] wars and rumors of wars that brother
[1:46:54] troy was talking about just bring it
[1:46:55] from a different angle
[1:46:56] yes there'll be naturals but catch the
[1:46:58] spiritual wars
[1:47:00] right you know we got to catch these
[1:47:02] things but but but we got to see that
[1:47:03] the devil is he has an objective amen
[1:47:06] when he's deceiving a person
[1:47:08] is trying to amen have their own
[1:47:10] personal gain
[1:47:12] glory to god the devil had a personal
[1:47:14] gain by deceiving the angels
[1:47:16] amen and having and let me tell you if
[1:47:18] he can get you deceived he has a
[1:47:20] personal gain
[1:47:22] he can bring another person to hell do
[1:47:24] you know hell wasn't even created
[1:47:26] for f f f f f f for god's people
[1:47:30] the hell was created for the devil and
[1:47:32] his angels
[1:47:33] but the bible say hell hath enlarges
[1:47:35] mouth because so many people are being
[1:47:37] deceived
[1:47:38] they'll end up going to hell hallelujah
[1:47:41] the devil will deceive you and tell you
[1:47:43] that this this lifestyle that you live
[1:47:45] in
[1:47:46] unholy unrighteous lifestyle is better
[1:47:49] than living for god
[1:47:50] that's deception hallelujah i mean the
[1:47:53] devil gets you in the spot and then try
[1:47:54] to cut your life off real quick
[1:47:57] why are you sinning he trying to cut you
[1:47:59] off hallelujah but god said i come to
[1:48:01] give you life and life more abundantly
[1:48:03] amen but look at this now the devil's
[1:48:05] always deceiving watch this
[1:48:07] isaiah 14 how art thou verse 12
[1:48:10] how art thou fallen from heaven o
[1:48:12] lucifer
[1:48:14] son of the morning how art thou cut down
[1:48:17] to the ground
[1:48:18] which this weekend the nations
[1:48:21] hallelujah i'm at verse 13.
[1:48:22] he says for thou hast said in thine
[1:48:26] heart
[1:48:26] i will ascend into
[1:48:30] heaven i will exalt my throne
[1:48:33] above the stars of god i will sit also
[1:48:37] upon the mount of the congregation oh
[1:48:40] hallelujah amen
[1:48:43] the devil hallelujah it wants some
[1:48:46] worship
[1:48:47] amen it's not just the devil fighting
[1:48:50] you when you leave
[1:48:51] church it's the devil fighting you
[1:48:53] actually in the church
[1:48:56] the devil come through a preacher
[1:48:59] come on somebody the devil will use a
[1:49:02] minister
[1:49:03] a so-called minister you want to know
[1:49:05] who the first preacher to ever preach
[1:49:07] the word of god it was the devil himself
[1:49:09] when he preached the eve he began to
[1:49:12] interpret and explain
[1:49:14] scripture to eve and he fell for the
[1:49:17] deception
[1:49:18] hallelujah created all the problems that
[1:49:21] we got today
[1:49:22] this is the reason we attend funerals
[1:49:24] because of what happened in the garden
[1:49:25] of eden
[1:49:26] he fell for deception
[1:49:30] look at this so thou has said in our
[1:49:33] heart says i will ascend into heaven i
[1:49:35] will exalt my throne above the stars of
[1:49:36] god i will sit also
[1:49:38] upon the mount of the congregation in
[1:49:40] the size of the north
[1:49:41] i will ascend above the heights of the
[1:49:43] clouds i will be like the most high
[1:49:45] now now there's a couple things that we
[1:49:47] need to look at
[1:49:48] especially in that scripture now satan
[1:49:50] we we know that he tried to get
[1:49:52] be um he wanted to be like god
[1:49:56] he wanted to be like god and and uh but
[1:50:00] this scripture says that he would exalt
[1:50:01] himself uh
[1:50:02] exalt my throne above the stars of god
[1:50:08] i'm exalt my throne above the stars
[1:50:12] of god you know who the stars of god are
[1:50:16] i
[1:50:16] i got some good news for you
[1:50:19] do you realize you are one of god's
[1:50:21] stars
[1:50:23] satan wanted to exalt himself above you
[1:50:26] and you know why
[1:50:27] you know why he won't exalt himself
[1:50:29] above you because based on your
[1:50:31] understanding
[1:50:32] the devil has one place and that's
[1:50:35] underneath your
[1:50:39] and the devil's tired of being
[1:50:41] underneath your feet so he trying to
[1:50:42] exalt himself
[1:50:43] above you now i'ma tell you if you
[1:50:45] talking with the devil if you're having
[1:50:46] conversation with the devil that means
[1:50:48] you got to get down to his level
[1:50:51] and his levels underneath my feet
[1:50:59] you got to get to a point where you're
[1:51:00] not even having conversations with him
[1:51:01] anymore
[1:51:04] it's a waste of time now now
[1:51:07] i want to i want to read a quote here
[1:51:09] just real quick out of the message god's
[1:51:10] power to transform i want to i want you
[1:51:12] to get
[1:51:13] get this really quick because the
[1:51:14] prophet helps us to see this
[1:51:16] amen when we're reading that scripture
[1:51:18] out of isaiah 14 we can
[1:51:20] we can we can apply this it says satan's
[1:51:22] purpose satan's purpose from
[1:51:24] eden was to make his own self
[1:51:27] in eden satan's purpose from
[1:51:30] eden was to make himself amen make make
[1:51:34] his own self in eden
[1:51:35] and exalt himself above
[1:51:39] the stars of god so he said exalt
[1:51:42] himself above
[1:51:43] so the stars of god would worship him
[1:51:47] sons would worship him
[1:51:51] and he has absolutely carried it out now
[1:51:55] and when he's done this and brought it
[1:51:57] into the church
[1:51:59] which i won't go if you listen to them
[1:52:02] tapes know about it
[1:52:03] that's exactly the hour we're living in
[1:52:06] and if satan's that
[1:52:07] that that's that's done it through
[1:52:08] educational programs this is how
[1:52:10] this is how satan got into the church i
[1:52:12] want y'all to catch what the prophet is
[1:52:14] sharing with us
[1:52:14] the devil got into the church through
[1:52:16] educational programs
[1:52:18] through educational programs better fit
[1:52:22] better this better that and not knowing
[1:52:26] all the time they're walking straight
[1:52:28] right straight into death blind leading
[1:52:30] the blind
[1:52:31] blinded leaders of the nations blinded
[1:52:34] leaders of science
[1:52:35] blind leaders of the church blind
[1:52:38] leading the blind that jesus said left
[1:52:40] them alone they will both fall
[1:52:41] in the ditch satan wanted to be
[1:52:45] worshipped
[1:52:46] satan won and and i was just reading a
[1:52:48] little something here and i won't i
[1:52:49] won't read it i'll just kind of share
[1:52:51] with you
[1:52:51] when god created uh adam and eve and
[1:52:54] before sin
[1:52:55] came into the earth um there
[1:52:58] uh god bringing the animals up to to
[1:53:00] adam and having him name all the animals
[1:53:02] and
[1:53:03] and all of this and you know just just
[1:53:04] allowing him to exercise his dominion in
[1:53:07] the garden and
[1:53:08] you know and and i mean in the cool of
[1:53:10] the evening uh
[1:53:11] after god took that rib out of adam and
[1:53:13] made made eve and in the coolest evening
[1:53:15] he would come down and
[1:53:16] have fellowship with with adam how was
[1:53:18] your day today
[1:53:19] how did this go and how did that go and
[1:53:21] they just have just real good
[1:53:22] fellowship he says uh you know and and
[1:53:26] as
[1:53:26] as uh as as these things were going on
[1:53:28] there in the
[1:53:29] uh let me just uh just something i want
[1:53:32] to catch here real quick
[1:53:34] uh i mean questions and answers law

[1:53:39] wanna i gotta
[1:53:40] i gotta inject this i don't wanna skip
[1:53:42] over it questions and answers law having
[1:53:44] a shadow
[1:53:44] he says there stood adam and eve a
[1:53:47] beautiful woman
[1:53:48] oh my can see there adam with them dark
[1:53:51] shaggy
[1:53:52] locks hanging around his head now when
[1:53:54] the prophet is saying i can see this
[1:53:56] i actually believe through a prophetic
[1:53:59] lens
[1:54:00] he's actually seeing this now don't say
[1:54:02] that's
[1:54:03] that's that's that's unheard of how
[1:54:05] could moses
[1:54:07] write the first five books of the bible
[1:54:10] and not be there how could moses do that
[1:54:15] how can moses tell us what happened in
[1:54:17] the garden of eden
[1:54:18] and moses was not there
[1:54:21] but we believe him it's because moses
[1:54:24] was looking through a prophetic lens
[1:54:27] hallelujah so when brother branham is
[1:54:29] saying say i can see this i actually
[1:54:31] believe he's looking at it through a
[1:54:33] prophetic lens this is what he's seeing
[1:54:35] and telling us what he's seeing
[1:54:37] hallelujah that's what a prophet can do
[1:54:39] it says death stood adam and eve
[1:54:41] uh eve a beautiful one oh my i can see
[1:54:44] there
[1:54:44] adam with them dark shaggy locks around
[1:54:46] his head
[1:54:47] those bright flashy eyes look over to
[1:54:50] his little sweetheart
[1:54:51] eve and such a perfect built woman
[1:54:54] and her hair looked up and and her eyes
[1:54:57] as blue as the sky
[1:54:59] adam loved her oh how he
[1:55:02] loved her but when sin into the end
[1:55:05] their little home was broken up
[1:55:07] because an old lustful beast
[1:55:11] my the devil had got into an animal
[1:55:14] called the serpent not a reptile
[1:55:17] this gun this is going to get a little
[1:55:19] amen uh
[1:55:21] we're going to go a little deep in this
[1:55:22] because i'm going to just be like i'm
[1:55:24] going to just be honest
[1:55:24] if church can't get what happened in the
[1:55:26] garden eden right
[1:55:28] how are they going to get the rest of
[1:55:29] the bible right
[1:55:31] remember the bible doesn't say that the
[1:55:33] devil was a snake
[1:55:37] he wasn't a snake in the beginning
[1:55:40] oh i'ma break it down the snake wasn't
[1:55:43] like he is now in the beginning
[1:55:45] the curse put him where he's at the
[1:55:47] bible said not a reptile he was a beast
[1:55:49] and the most son of all beasts
[1:55:50] of the field he looked more like a man
[1:55:52] than anything you have ever
[1:55:54] had walked upright there was there was
[1:55:57] there's where the devil got it god got
[1:55:59] in him
[1:56:00] and come to eve this beautiful made
[1:56:02] woman
[1:56:03] she did what was wrong now he says this
[1:56:06] take your idea of it i got mine i'm
[1:56:09] gonna come back to that
[1:56:10] take your idea of it i got mine i'm
[1:56:13] gonna try to explain to you what his
[1:56:14] idea was let me just finish reading all
[1:56:17] right now
[1:56:18] then she brought forth the first son
[1:56:19] cain the nature after the daddy a
[1:56:22] murderer hate and so forth
[1:56:23] noticed them uh when taken place what
[1:56:26] taking place after that
[1:56:27] then when god came down to talk
[1:56:29] fellowship had been broken could you
[1:56:30] imagine
[1:56:31] adam oh and eve setting out in the
[1:56:35] garden of eden
[1:56:36] under them them great them great palm
[1:56:38] trees god would come down and say my
[1:56:40] children yes father it's all well
[1:56:42] all is well have you enjoyed the
[1:56:44] blessings of your father this day
[1:56:45] yes father we enjoyed it here come leo
[1:56:48] the lion
[1:56:49] up leo meows like a kitten adam pats him
[1:56:53] on the head
[1:56:53] he kneels himself down here comes
[1:56:56] cheetah the tiger and all them comes up
[1:56:59] lays down meows around and god's great
[1:57:01] voice roaring through the top of them
[1:57:03] trees
[1:57:03] my creation have you enjoyed what your
[1:57:05] father has given you this day
[1:57:07] yes father every day no death no sorrow
[1:57:10] there it is
[1:57:11] that's the way god said oh isn't this
[1:57:13] wonderful
[1:57:14] now i want to just catch this because uh
[1:57:17] there's a
[1:57:17] statement that is made here that i just
[1:57:19] think is just a little
[1:57:21] uh the tongue just kind of got ahead of
[1:57:24] itself
[1:57:25] he says and then michael looked over and
[1:57:28] said i could do that too he wouldn't
[1:57:30] talk about michael
[1:57:31] that's where the devil came in when he
[1:57:34] looked at how
[1:57:35] adam was naming all the animals then he
[1:57:37] looked
[1:57:38] at how all the fellowship was going
[1:57:40] inside the garden of eden
[1:57:42] no sin no sorrow no headache justice
[1:57:46] this this place of peace love and true
[1:57:49] happiness
[1:57:50] amen it all exists in the garden but
[1:57:52] when it's when satan just kind of looked
[1:57:54] he said
[1:57:54] i can do that too look at this now
[1:57:58] he says oh brother don't you get
[1:57:59] yourself contrary to god's word
[1:58:01] that's what's the matter with these
[1:58:02] churches today i can make an
[1:58:03] organization too
[1:58:04] as good as they are oh get away from it
[1:58:06] stay with god's word yes sir let god
[1:58:08] uh god was the one speaking so here's
[1:58:10] satan just desired to see the same thing
[1:58:13] and amen he won the same thing god had
[1:58:15] he want the same type of fellowship he
[1:58:17] wanted the same type of worship he
[1:58:18] wanted
[1:58:19] all these things now and i i was just
[1:58:21] kind of thinking about this
[1:58:22] satan won in worship he wanted worse
[1:58:25] that's why the scriptures say he was
[1:58:26] sitting in the
[1:58:27] size of the north going into the you
[1:58:29] know the congregation he went to sit on
[1:58:30] another side
[1:58:32] of the church to try to i want some of
[1:58:33] this hallelujah somebody
[1:58:36] amen he he said i i i see what these th
[1:58:39] these these the
[1:58:40] the stars are doing it and i want
[1:58:42] something i would like for them to
[1:58:43] worship me and i'ma tell you he's
[1:58:44] accomplished that
[1:58:46] there are people going to church every
[1:58:47] week worshiping the devil and don't even
[1:58:49] realize it
[1:58:50] hallelujah because if they're not
[1:58:52] worshiping according to truth they're
[1:58:54] worshiping satan they don't realize it
[1:58:56] some of the teachers that are going
[1:58:57] forth out of the pulpits satan
[1:58:59] has inspired some of those teachings
[1:59:02] deception is going on inside the church
[1:59:03] and people don't realize it but but as
[1:59:05] he was there
[1:59:06] you know just desiring these things amen
[1:59:08] uh uh
[1:59:09] sitting in the it says i was sitting in
[1:59:11] in the mount of the congregation devil
[1:59:13] in the church the devil in the church
[1:59:16] hallelujah the way you're going to be
[1:59:17] able to discern these spirits is by
[1:59:19] giving them the word
[1:59:20] tests hallelujah now i want you to just
[1:59:23] kind of see something
[1:59:24] i want you to see this satan saying i
[1:59:27] want to be like god
[1:59:28] i like some of that worship now when
[1:59:31] when god created the angels the angels
[1:59:33] actually brought worship so
[1:59:34] in god's mind even just won't
[1:59:38] worship that's not all god was looking
[1:59:40] for
[1:59:41] because he created the angels and they
[1:59:43] brought him worship
[1:59:45] the devil was missing it all alone god
[1:59:47] didn't just
[1:59:48] want worship oh y'all don't get it
[1:59:54] that's part of it but what god wanted
[1:59:57] was fellowship
[2:00:01] do you know the reason why adam got
[2:00:03] abroad
[2:00:04] adam was a son of god hallelujah and
[2:00:08] and god himself was lonely even though
[2:00:11] he had
[2:00:12] all this worship god himself was
[2:00:14] experiencing
[2:00:15] loneliness so that's why he even made
[2:00:18] adam
[2:00:19] now i got a son somebody i can just kind
[2:00:22] of share some of my thoughts with
[2:00:24] share some of my ideas with but when he
[2:00:27] looked he'd say
[2:00:28] now i made a male this and a female dad
[2:00:30] and
[2:00:31] male this and a female that but when he
[2:00:33] made adam he made adam both male
[2:00:35] and female hallelujah
[2:00:39] and that loneliness that was in god he
[2:00:41] can look down and see that loneliness is
[2:00:44] now inside of
[2:00:45] adam hallelujah so he says adam i see
[2:00:48] the loneliness in you
[2:00:49] every time you name an animal they're
[2:00:51] coming in pairs and you're looking at
[2:00:53] yourself and wondering
[2:00:54] where is my mate
[2:00:58] because adam was expressing what was in
[2:01:00] god
[2:01:01] god didn't want just worship god said
[2:01:03] where is
[2:01:04] my mate hallelujah
[2:01:08] i'm telling you the maid of god is here
[2:01:10] this morning
[2:01:12] you are the maid of god do you want to
[2:01:14] walk you want to know one thing that's
[2:01:16] greater than the blood
[2:01:20] i say do you want to know one thing
[2:01:22] that's greater than the blood
[2:01:24] the purchase of the blood
[2:01:27] you are why he came to calvary you are
[2:01:30] why he died
[2:01:31] you are why he rules again you are why
[2:01:40] where is my wife
[2:01:43] oh jesus
[2:01:46] adam adam see see i i it was i don't
[2:01:49] have time to get it all
[2:01:50] it was three bribes and i'm gonna try to
[2:01:53] get into the maybe i
[2:01:54] get in there a little bit later adam had
[2:01:56] a bride
[2:01:57] god had a bride jesus had a brat
[2:02:01] see what was in adam he don't realize he
[2:02:03] was just expressing
[2:02:05] these attributes that was in god when
[2:02:07] god said now you know i see i see you
[2:02:09] alone you're wondering adam what
[2:02:11] what's going on here it's two cheetahs
[2:02:14] two monkeys two cows two elephants
[2:02:18] two tigers two lions two dogs two cats
[2:02:21] two two two two two two
[2:02:23] but i'm standing here by myself
[2:02:26] and god knew what was in adam so god put
[2:02:28] adam to sleep
[2:02:31] took and put them to sleep and said now
[2:02:32] i made you male and female
[2:02:34] now do you realize at the time that god
[2:02:37] made adam
[2:02:38] uh uh now and she wasn't eve yet
[2:02:45] because eve means mother of all living
[2:02:48] i can't even get to my message y'all
[2:02:50] don't pull me
[2:02:52] right eve means mother of all living and
[2:02:54] and hallelujah let me just slow down
[2:02:56] before i get off
[2:02:57] but but but here here here here eve was
[2:03:00] in adam
[2:03:02] hallelujah and do you know while she was
[2:03:04] in adam she was co-equal
[2:03:08] she was co-equal when she was in adam
[2:03:11] it's only
[2:03:11] when sin came oh lord help us jesus
[2:03:16] it's only when sin came and sin came
[2:03:19] through
[2:03:19] eve she introduced this to adam
[2:03:24] hallelujah adam willfully fell for this
[2:03:27] because he loved us so much he willfully
[2:03:29] went into this act with eve
[2:03:31] hallelujah let's just stop and just deal
[2:03:33] with these things
[2:03:35] now i i i read the quote and brother
[2:03:37] branham said
[2:03:38] i got my idea on it you have your idea
[2:03:40] and i got my idea
[2:03:42] and i'm gonna tell you my idea is the
[2:03:43] same idea as the prophets
[2:03:46] my idea what really happened to garden
[2:03:49] of eden
[2:03:50] what happened this forbidden fruit
[2:03:55] forbidden fruit that's what churches say
[2:03:58] they ate a forbidden fruit okay what was
[2:04:00] the forbidden fruit
[2:04:03] nobody got an answer and the other thing
[2:04:05] i have
[2:04:06] why did she get pregnant after eating
[2:04:08] the fruit
[2:04:14] people need to answer the questions
[2:04:15] let's go back to the bible and answer
[2:04:17] the question
[2:04:18] why did eve get pregnant after eating
[2:04:20] this this fruit now they said in my
[2:04:22] church years ago they tell me
[2:04:24] apple then they went to apricot they
[2:04:25] went to all kinds of things
[2:04:27] my question is is if they if they ate an
[2:04:29] apple
[2:04:30] back then and got pregnant why can't
[2:04:32] people eat apples a day
[2:04:34] and get pregnant well
[2:04:37] the apple didn't get cursed
[2:04:44] i ain't read that in the bible the apple
[2:04:46] didn't get cursed
[2:04:48] the tree wasn't cursed there was three
[2:04:51] people got in trouble
[2:04:53] adam by the sweat of your brow you're
[2:04:56] gonna work now
[2:04:57] eve gonna bring four children to heart
[2:04:59] labor
[2:05:01] and and and and eve blamed it they had a
[2:05:04] blame game going
[2:05:05] eve made a statement should say i was
[2:05:07] deceived beguiled
[2:05:09] by the serpent what happened what
[2:05:11] happened
[2:05:13] the way she got beguiled is that the
[2:05:14] devil that got kicked out of heaven
[2:05:17] we read it it was ready last week he
[2:05:19] came down out of heaven
[2:05:20] went into the garden of eden got into
[2:05:23] the serpent well what did the serpent
[2:05:24] look
[2:05:24] like before he was cursed because the
[2:05:28] bible say he went on his belly
[2:05:30] the curse put him on his belly
[2:05:33] he did something before the curse i'm
[2:05:36] here to tell you this is why god sent a
[2:05:38] prophet a prophet can take us back to
[2:05:40] genesis like
[2:05:41] like moses
[2:05:46] and the prophet tells us that the the
[2:05:48] the the the
[2:05:49] serpent actually took on stood on two
[2:05:52] feet just like a man
[2:05:54] he could talk just like a man because he
[2:05:57] was talking to eve
[2:06:00] and he could have relations with a
[2:06:02] serpent and produce another serpent
[2:06:04] or have relations with a human and
[2:06:06] produce
[2:06:07] not a human but produce something and
[2:06:10] that something that was produced
[2:06:12] was king and this is why the bible says
[2:06:15] when you read your bible i say
[2:06:17] i say see i'm not trying to hide nothing
[2:06:19] i'm giving you scripture
[2:06:21] right when you read your bible you will
[2:06:23] first notice in all the genealogies in
[2:06:25] scripture
[2:06:26] cain's name is never mentioned with adam
[2:06:29] read the bible
[2:06:31] but also in the book of first john i
[2:06:33] believe chapter 3 verse 12 it says
[2:06:35] king was of that wicked one
[2:06:38] adam was not wicked adam was god's son
[2:06:43] made in his image what happened she
[2:06:45] believed a lie
[2:06:47] satan sold her on this thing you go you
[2:06:49] know if you're taking this fruit you're
[2:06:50] going to be like god she was already
[2:06:52] like god
[2:06:53] she was made in his image
[2:06:57] so he just kind of twisted the word on
[2:07:00] and deception said it and deception
[2:07:02] created all these problems
[2:07:03] i told you it was it was three brats
[2:07:06] adam had a bride his bride was lost
[2:07:09] through deception
[2:07:11] jehovah had a bribe it was the nation of
[2:07:14] israel
[2:07:14] he actually told him in the scripture i
[2:07:16] am married to you
[2:07:18] i'm married to israel and you know what
[2:07:20] when god is married to you ain't nothing
[2:07:21] you can do to get away from him
[2:07:23] now you might go into some situations
[2:07:25] like israel did
[2:07:26] they they went into all kind of stuff
[2:07:28] but they could not be lost they had to
[2:07:30] come back because he was married to him
[2:07:32] hallelujah some of y'all down went
[2:07:35] through some stuff
[2:07:36] and the reason you keep coming back
[2:07:38] because god is married to
[2:07:40] you you know
[2:07:44] you know what happened you know what
[2:07:46] happened with israel they got all messed
[2:07:48] up
[2:07:49] they and this is what happened to the
[2:07:50] church i want to just kind of talk and i
[2:07:52] i won't have time to read all the quotes
[2:07:55] but uh what happened to israel is that
[2:07:58] when they start desiring a
[2:08:00] king to be like the other nations
[2:08:03] that's when they start being deceived
[2:08:07] because other nations were serving false
[2:08:08] gods you know what used to happen in
[2:08:10] israel they were led by a prophet
[2:08:13] when israel was led by prophets nothing
[2:08:15] went wrong samuel was leading them
[2:08:18] giving them the mind of god tell them
[2:08:20] exactly what to do but when they say we
[2:08:21] want to be like other nations we want to
[2:08:24] have a king
[2:08:24] just like they have a king when they got
[2:08:26] to that that's when they were being
[2:08:28] deceived
[2:08:29] and they got pulled off into things that
[2:08:30] they never thought that they would ever
[2:08:32] be
[2:08:32] because the kings hallelujah led them
[2:08:36] into idolatry their leaders
[2:08:39] led them into idolatry can i tell you
[2:08:41] same thing that happened in church
[2:08:42] preachers have led the people into
[2:08:45] idolatry
[2:08:46] when you got father son and holy ghost
[2:08:48] as three different gods
[2:08:49] you're an idol worshiper
[2:08:54] because the lord our god is one amen
[2:08:57] that's what moses taught all right
[2:09:00] church and then paul picked it up and
[2:09:02] said it's one lord
[2:09:04] one faith
[2:09:10] one baptism so so tell me how we got
[2:09:12] these two different baptisms
[2:09:15] can i just talk to y'all today how how
[2:09:17] we get baptized in the name of the
[2:09:18] father son and the holy ghost and
[2:09:20] baptize the name of the lord jesus
[2:09:21] christ
[2:09:22] i went to church and the guy was
[2:09:23] baptizing he said i baptize you
[2:09:26] in the name of the father the son of the
[2:09:28] holy ghost and in the name of the lord
[2:09:29] jesus christ i say well what in the
[2:09:30] world just happened here
[2:09:36] and they be celebrating all the number
[2:09:38] of baptisms that they have we got this
[2:09:40] many baptized that many
[2:09:41] and they're baptizing them wrong
[2:09:45] i'm just talking can i just keep talking
[2:09:48] i mean they so so they bash on them
[2:09:50] so how do we get these things
[2:09:53] fixed because we got something you got
[2:09:56] jesus said
[2:09:58] baptized in the name of the father name
[2:10:01] of the son the name of the holy ghost
[2:10:02] say jesus said that so so we're going to
[2:10:05] follow what
[2:10:06] jesus said and then peter and i know
[2:10:08] peter wasn't
[2:10:09] the brightest i know that
[2:10:13] peter couldn't even sign his own name
[2:10:14] but ten days after peter received those
[2:10:17] instructions
[2:10:18] had a mighty experience on the day of
[2:10:19] pentecost peter tells us that
[2:10:21] somebody said man brother what should we
[2:10:22] do to be saved peter say
[2:10:24] repent be baptized in the name of the
[2:10:27] lord jesus christ for the missionary
[2:10:29] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[2:10:31] the holy ghost he say the promise is
[2:10:32] unto you your children those that are
[2:10:34] false as men as the lord god shall call
[2:10:36] how did peter get it wrong in 10 days
[2:10:40] i know he wasn't that bright i'm i'm
[2:10:43] asking two questions
[2:10:44] how did peter get it wrong and why did
[2:10:48] god allowed to be put in the bible
[2:10:54] because i asked somebody that said peter
[2:10:55] had it wrong i said no maybe peter had
[2:10:57] it right
[2:10:59] and maybe we got it wrong because i'ma
[2:11:02] tell you what peter understood peter
[2:11:04] when he said baptizing peter was damned
[2:11:06] jesus said baptize them in the name of
[2:11:08] the father
[2:11:09] in the name of the son and in the name
[2:11:12] of the holy ghost
[2:11:14] peter knew that father that's a title
[2:11:17] son that's a title holy ghost
[2:11:20] that's just what it is and it's also you
[2:11:22] know human beings would
[2:11:24] be a title for us too he says but he
[2:11:26] said he said because i'm a father i'm a
[2:11:27] son
[2:11:28] i'm i'm a brother i'm a pastor i got all
[2:11:29] these titles he said but what's the name
[2:11:31] of the father
[2:11:33] what's the name of the son what's the
[2:11:35] name of the holy ghost and peter could
[2:11:36] deduce things
[2:11:38] you know and i i don't have time to read
[2:11:40] all this but
[2:11:41] it's in the bible do you know the jews
[2:11:44] the reason they crucified jesus because
[2:11:46] he said
[2:11:47] he was the son of god and by saying
[2:11:50] according to the jews
[2:11:52] by saying you are the son of god that
[2:11:54] makes you
[2:11:55] god the jews believe that it's in it's
[2:12:00] in the book of john
[2:12:01] the jews believe if you say you the son
[2:12:03] of god that actually makes you god
[2:12:05] so that's why they came against jesus so
[2:12:07] peter had the revelation
[2:12:09] when peter when you say uh uh peter who
[2:12:11] does who do men say i am
[2:12:12] some say you're elias some say you john
[2:12:14] the baptist i mean some say uh jeremiah
[2:12:16] some one of the prophets
[2:12:18] say uh i heard that now not peter who do
[2:12:20] you
[2:12:22] who you say i am peter
[2:12:26] thou are the christ the son
[2:12:30] of the living god now by peter actually
[2:12:32] using the words thou art the christ
[2:12:35] the son he was actually identifying
[2:12:37] jesus
[2:12:38] as god
[2:12:41] because the jews believed that if you
[2:12:44] identify as the son of god you're
[2:12:46] calling yourself
[2:12:47] god peter knew that jesus was
[2:12:50] god not two different gods
[2:12:54] god the father became the son
[2:12:57] and while he was on earth he said you
[2:12:59] know what i'm not gonna leave you
[2:13:01] without a confidence i'm going to give
[2:13:03] you something to dwell on the inside it
[2:13:05] cause you to be able to live the way i'm
[2:13:06] living
[2:13:07] and that's what the spirit of god comes
[2:13:08] to do inside of us it's the same
[2:13:10] god all the way through the bible
[2:13:14] he took on the flesh of jesus
[2:13:17] peter said i got that the reason i say
[2:13:20] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[2:13:21] christ because jesus
[2:13:23] is the father jesus is
[2:13:26] the son jesus is the holy ghost
[2:13:30] and we didn't know god's name until we
[2:13:32] knew jesus
[2:13:39] adam had a wife that got deceived
[2:13:44] and i only got to see if she end up
[2:13:45] pregnant before adam
[2:13:48] came to her this is what happened in the
[2:13:51] garden
[2:13:51] she was pregnant by by the serpent and
[2:13:54] the devil
[2:13:55] anointed the serpent to do what he did
[2:13:57] the devil even
[2:13:58] studied all the animals he knew what
[2:14:00] this animal could do
[2:14:02] and he used it and you said god the
[2:14:03] devil don't use animals is that right
[2:14:06] is that right why in scripture
[2:14:10] when jesus come along and them devils
[2:14:12] had that man in a graveyard
[2:14:14] the devils pray oh lord i'm all i'm back
[2:14:17] at it again
[2:14:17] i'm back at it the devil's praying and
[2:14:19] said jesus please don't send us to the
[2:14:21] abyss
[2:14:22] but let us go into the swine
[2:14:25] and do you know what jesus did gave them
[2:14:27] permission i want you to know that if a
[2:14:29] devil
[2:14:30] can ask for a prayer request
[2:14:34] and get it granted what you think about
[2:14:37] a son or daughter of god
[2:14:42] you we ought to stop having in mind
[2:14:43] battles that god ain't gonna hear our
[2:14:45] prayer
[2:14:45] if the devil had his prayer answered
[2:14:49] i know i'm gonna get mines
[2:14:54] so the devil does take over animals the
[2:14:56] devil does
[2:14:57] now i want to go further i i'm trying to
[2:14:59] get to this point
[2:15:00] god adam had a bright god had abroad
[2:15:03] god's bride was israel they got trapped
[2:15:06] in
[2:15:06] an organizationalism let's put it that
[2:15:08] way that was their problem
[2:15:10] and jesus had a bride that came out at
[2:15:12] the day of pentecost but you know what
[2:15:14] they also got trapped in
[2:15:16] denominationalism
[2:15:18] hallelujah oh my
[2:15:21] you know the denominationalism came in
[2:15:23] because the church was standing very
[2:15:24] pure
[2:15:25] but when catholic teaching start
[2:15:27] entering in this is where the church got
[2:15:29] all messed up
[2:15:30] amen that that council i can't even
[2:15:32] think of it right now
[2:15:34] nice seeing that uh that brought in a
[2:15:36] lot of confusion to the church this is
[2:15:38] where
[2:15:39] this different baptism came in baptizing
[2:15:41] the name of the father son the holy
[2:15:42] ghost a lot of the uh
[2:15:43] i mean the three gods the trinity the
[2:15:45] word trinity is not even
[2:15:47] in the bible but yet they use it anyway
[2:15:50] in church they worship in the devil and
[2:15:51] don't even realize it
[2:15:52] the devil brought what we call a uh
[2:15:56] uh a a a religion from a bottomless pit
[2:16:03] teachings from a bottomless pit
[2:16:06] revelation talks about
[2:16:07] and the reason that it's a bottomless
[2:16:09] pit is because it has no foundation
[2:16:11] in scripture they teach it
[2:16:15] hallelujah jesus had a bride
[2:16:18] now i got to read these quotes now i'm
[2:16:20] i'm here where i want to be jesus had a
[2:16:22] bride she got
[2:16:23] messed up at the day of i mean after the
[2:16:25] day of pentecost when they started
[2:16:26] allowing through the church ages when
[2:16:28] they started allowing all these false
[2:16:30] teachings
[2:16:30] to come in now let me just read
[2:16:31] something to you glory to god
[2:16:34] this is coming out of the message of a
[2:16:37] super sign
[2:16:40] i just got to read just a couple things
[2:16:41] to you and then i want to i want to hit
[2:16:43] something
[2:16:45] coming out of superson says why did she
[2:16:48] realize she was naked
[2:16:50] absolutely why did life come by that
[2:16:52] that perverted life god that the great
[2:16:54] contractor had all the bodies laid out
[2:16:56] here on the earth
[2:16:58] calcium pot pods petroleum he was going
[2:17:00] to create it and make it
[2:17:02] but she bypassed the way of god yes sir
[2:17:05] what did adam do when he come to his
[2:17:08] wife
[2:17:08] when he come to her he found her
[2:17:11] pregnant
[2:17:13] just exactly of an evil her own
[2:17:15] exception
[2:17:16] conception had received foul seed
[2:17:20] this is eve jehovah before he could
[2:17:23] marry
[2:17:23] his wife did the same thing and jesus
[2:17:27] before he could get to his bride
[2:17:29] hallelujah you could see number four
[2:17:30] eve got to adam before adam could
[2:17:33] actually
[2:17:34] you know because god gave him a
[2:17:35] commandment to reproduce multiply
[2:17:38] replenish the earth but before adam
[2:17:39] could do that he was already
[2:17:42] deceived he was already a man defiled
[2:17:46] he was already pregnant hallelujah

[2:18:18] will be
[2:18:18] brought that would be bought by his word

[2:20:45] in the church today taking his wife back
[2:20:49] he says see the threefold mystery now
[2:20:51] god manifested in christ
[2:20:53] christ manifested in the church
[2:20:55] altogether to bring back the original
[2:20:58] adam and eve again this is the whole
[2:20:59] purpose of you coming to church god
[2:21:01] trying to bring you back to the original
[2:21:03] adam and eve again he says man and woman
[2:21:06] which are one made out of the same blood
[2:21:08] and same spirit and everything else

[2:21:14] christ
[2:21:14] by the spirit my god i love these words
[2:21:18] he says the life is in the blood
[2:21:21] that's the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:21:23] that baptizes us into his body
[2:21:26] that recognize only his body his flesh
[2:21:28] his word he says
[2:21:29] denomination won't never touch
[2:21:33] that it's a revelation she knows it so
[2:21:36] did eve know it but she failed this is
[2:21:38] something i want you to bank your solo
[2:21:41] but this one knows it and won't
[2:21:44] fall we know something that the rest of
[2:21:48] them didn't know
[2:21:49] we're looking at an open book and and
[2:21:52] since we won't fall
[2:21:53] this is impossible deception listen
[2:21:56] says she is ordained hallelujah
[2:22:01] whoa she is ordained to not
[2:22:04] fall can i can i uh can i tell you when
[2:22:08] god
[2:22:09] made eve i told you this early and i
[2:22:11] finished it
[2:22:12] god wanted more than just worship god
[2:22:14] wanted fellowship
[2:22:16] and do you know when god made eve he
[2:22:18] actually knew he
[2:22:22] knew that eve would do what she did
[2:22:26] god knew it and i'ma tell you not only
[2:22:28] god
[2:22:29] knew it god allowed it you know why
[2:22:32] because eve was the only
[2:22:33] only thing made that was made from
[2:22:35] something else
[2:22:37] she was not a part of the original
[2:22:39] creation her spirit was
[2:22:41] but her body was made from something
[2:22:43] else
[2:22:44] hallelujah right so god already knew
[2:22:46] that this thing was going to happen and
[2:22:48] and what that did this is where satan
[2:22:49] was blinded
[2:22:50] he thought god just wanted worship but
[2:22:52] what he found out is that god wanted a
[2:22:53] lot more than worship
[2:22:55] god wanted redemption god wanted
[2:22:58] restoration
[2:23:00] god wanted healing god wanted
[2:23:02] deliverance
[2:23:04] god god every attribute that you can
[2:23:06] imagine god wanted and the only way
[2:23:08] those attributes could be released
[2:23:10] in god is that he allowed the loudest
[2:23:12] thing to happen
[2:23:13] hallelujah to the lamb of god
[2:23:22] let me finish this she's ordained
[2:23:23] hallelujah who she's ordained not to
[2:23:25] fall she won't
[2:23:26] she won't fail she's predestinated to it
[2:23:28] blessed is the man who god will not
[2:23:30] impute sin you ministers know what i'm
[2:23:31] speaking of when there's a couple dozen
[2:23:33] of you sitting here
[2:23:35] blessed is the man whom god will not
[2:23:36] abuse sin that's what david said
[2:23:38] now now uh when god has made up his mind
[2:23:41] to use you
[2:23:44] god ain't looking for nobody else when
[2:23:46] god has decided that you're going to be
[2:23:48] the one he's not looking for anybody
[2:23:50] else to to try to fill your place i
[2:23:52] don't care what to do to try to get out
[2:23:54] of it
[2:23:54] amen when god chose israel no matter
[2:23:56] what israel did he kept bringing israel
[2:23:58] back
[2:24:00] can't restore them they're going bondage
[2:24:01] for so many years they i mean you look
[2:24:03] at the book of judges they they in
[2:24:04] bondage but they come out
[2:24:06] in bondage come out in bondage come on
[2:24:08] and that's many of our stories we end
[2:24:10] bondage but we come out
[2:24:11] god has his eye on you and there's no
[2:24:13] nobody can do anything about that i
[2:24:15] love that
[2:24:19] there was a man there in scripture we
[2:24:20] read about him at the beginning
[2:24:23] god had a purpose for samson
[2:24:26] samson's uh purpose was to destroy
[2:24:28] philistines
[2:24:30] god raised this man was born on the
[2:24:32] earth just to kill philistines
[2:24:34] to help his people remain free from the
[2:24:37] bondage that the philistines would
[2:24:39] always try to put on
[2:24:40] i mean oftentimes uh samson would they
[2:24:42] would
[2:24:43] at one time in his life he went down and
[2:24:45] uh they said we're coming to get him
[2:24:46] and and uh you know we tired of this guy
[2:24:48] samson and samson you know
[2:24:50] kind of uh uh uh maybe going into you
[2:24:53] know whatever they want him doing
[2:24:54] and then an anointed would come on
[2:24:56] samson my god he picked up a jawbone of
[2:24:58] of a mule
[2:25:00] picked up a jawbone and beat down a
[2:25:02] thousand men with a jawbone the jawbone
[2:25:04] should have broke the very first man
[2:25:06] that he hit
[2:25:08] but god anointed samson to to destroy
[2:25:10] them philosophy
[2:25:11] even when samson was down in the house
[2:25:13] of a harlot shouldn't have been there
[2:25:15] come on so must go places that we're not
[2:25:17] supposed to go amen but here sampson was
[2:25:19] down in the house of a harlot and
[2:25:21] and and when it gets down there the
[2:25:23] philistines coming around said we're
[2:25:24] going to get this guy now
[2:25:26] but even in his sin the anointing was
[2:25:29] still with him
[2:25:31] when he come out from that house and saw
[2:25:33] them philistines they had a gate there
[2:25:35] and sampson picked up the gates and took
[2:25:36] them to the top of the hill y'all can't
[2:25:38] get me
[2:25:39] i mean this man was anointed to destroy
[2:25:42] philistines
[2:25:42] many of these philistines saw maybe
[2:25:44] their fathers or their brothers or their
[2:25:46] other other their their sons they saw
[2:25:49] relatives die because of this man
[2:25:50] sampson
[2:25:51] so finally they come up with a plan
[2:25:53] samson has a weakness
[2:25:57] he loves philistine women
[2:26:01] let me tell you something the devil know
[2:26:02] your weakness
[2:26:04] some of us and amen brothers may have a
[2:26:07] problem with philistine women but
[2:26:08] sisters may have a problem with
[2:26:09] philistine men
[2:26:12] praise the lord everybody got a a
[2:26:14] delilah in their life
[2:26:16] and god want to see you free from your
[2:26:18] delilah praise the lord
[2:26:20] amen but here here samson's in this
[2:26:22] situation
[2:26:23] and um and and and it gets to the spot
[2:26:26] where
[2:26:27] you know now now before samson had
[2:26:29] delilah samson had another
[2:26:31] wife amongst the philistines that he
[2:26:33] should not have had but he kept going
[2:26:35] down until he situated
[2:26:37] it was problem after problem after
[2:26:38] problem but he tried to see his way
[2:26:40] through
[2:26:41] his parents even told him go back down

[2:28:10] message deceived church by the world you
[2:28:12] can go
[2:28:12] and listen to that he says when samson
[2:28:14] broke free the first time
[2:28:16] that was luther in the days of luther
[2:28:20] the church broke free from catholicism
[2:28:23] that's where the protestant reformation
[2:28:24] came in
[2:28:25] luther broke free hallelujah
[2:28:29] he says but you know what samson kept
[2:28:31] laying down even the church kept laying
[2:28:32] down in the lap of the devil
[2:28:35] praise god hallelujah kept laying down
[2:28:38] and then she said just say samson you
[2:28:39] you just you you didn't you deceived me
[2:28:42] you did i deceived you you deceived me
[2:28:45] just deception all over the place say
[2:28:46] steps you you didn't tell me where the
[2:28:48] strength was say
[2:28:49] i tell you what if you just give me some
[2:28:51] get some new ropes and you tie me the
[2:28:54] ropes that were never occupied
[2:28:55] then i'll be just like any other man and
[2:28:57] she tied him up with these
[2:28:58] new ropes yeah that samson the
[2:29:01] philistines be upon you
[2:29:02] say say you woke up broke up broke free
[2:29:05] he said that was wesley
[2:29:06] the methodist church that broke free
[2:29:12] methodist starts shouting and speaking
[2:29:14] in tongues and nowadays you can't see
[2:29:16] method is shouting and speaking in
[2:29:18] tongues but back in those days the
[2:29:20] method is actually shattered and spoken
[2:29:21] talks
[2:29:22] hallelujah they broke free but you know
[2:29:24] what they stepped they kept
[2:29:26] laying in the lap of delilah
[2:29:31] got bound again this time
[2:29:37] delilah says samson did it to me two
[2:29:39] times i i'm tired of this you know you
[2:29:41] got to stop making me look like this
[2:29:44] tell me what your strength is samson
[2:29:47] this time tells the third time he says
[2:29:49] if you weave the seven locks in my head
[2:29:53] with a web
[2:29:55] then i'd be just like any other man and
[2:29:57] now he was getting closer and closer
[2:30:00] to where his strength was hallelujah and
[2:30:03] this time when he says this
[2:30:04] just weave the seven locks in my head
[2:30:07] say i mean delilah
[2:30:08] weave them seven locks and she yelled
[2:30:10] out again samson
[2:30:12] the philistines be upon you
[2:30:16] samson woke up like he did the first two
[2:30:18] times broke free from these philistines
[2:30:20] and they said now
[2:30:21] brother branham say this was where
[2:30:23] pentecost came in
[2:30:25] because pentecost looked so close
[2:30:28] to the truth and and and samson got so
[2:30:32] close to the truth the way his strength
[2:30:34] was
[2:30:37] they broke free three times
[2:30:40] for the fourth time he couldn't break
[2:30:42] free
[2:30:44] and when pentecost went into
[2:30:46] organization
[2:30:47] they have not broken free
[2:30:51] i'm walking through the history of the
[2:30:53] church in the story of samson
[2:30:56] hallelujah glory to god
[2:30:59] they didn't break free this time samson
[2:31:01] finally told her
[2:31:02] if you just cut my hair i'm a nazarite
[2:31:06] i've been a nazirite
[2:31:07] all my days and if you just cut my hair
[2:31:09] i'm going to be just like any other man
[2:31:11] and this time she she called the man in
[2:31:14] and told the philistines he done gave me
[2:31:15] all his heart now
[2:31:16] we're gonna cut his hair and we're gonna
[2:31:18] let y'all go take him away
[2:31:19] sam saying the philistines be playing he
[2:31:21] woke up like he was gonna do it just
[2:31:22] like the last three times
[2:31:24] this time he didn't realize the
[2:31:25] anointing was already gone i want to
[2:31:28] tell you something brother branham said
[2:31:29] it like this
[2:31:31] god will use you until you go flirting
[2:31:33] with the world
[2:31:35] but when you stop flirting then god can
[2:31:37] use you again
[2:31:42] this time when he woke up there was no
[2:31:44] breaking free
[2:31:45] and this time it got worse because they
[2:31:47] took out his eyes
[2:31:49] they they they made sport of them they
[2:31:51] they they had him
[2:31:52] in bondage glory to god
[2:31:56] the church looked like it was defeated
[2:31:58] when it went back into organization
[2:32:00] in the days of pentecost hallelujah
[2:32:03] if i i don't have time to go into all
[2:32:05] this history but i'm
[2:32:06] i'm just trying to summarize and give
[2:32:09] you a little but the church
[2:32:10] i mean through luther they broke free
[2:32:12] through wesley they broke free through
[2:32:14] pentecost those great moves of god that
[2:32:17] god used
[2:32:17] but it wasn't the they wasn't the the
[2:32:20] final move
[2:32:24] samson why he was bound and i can say
[2:32:27] why we were
[2:32:28] i was in pentecost i was in baptist
[2:32:31] some of y'all have come from methodist
[2:32:33] some of you all have come from catholic
[2:32:36] hallelujah oh my god it said we come
[2:32:38] from these different
[2:32:39] different you know the delilah would
[2:32:41] have represented the catholic church
[2:32:44] oh yeah delilah would have represented
[2:32:48] the catholic church that was binding
[2:32:49] them an organization
[2:32:52] that's what delilah represented and so
[2:32:54] luther broke free but went right back
[2:32:56] into it
[2:32:57] wesley broke free but went right back
[2:32:59] into the pentecostals also broke free
[2:33:02] but they're right back into it the
[2:33:03] pentecost is where the callers just like
[2:33:05] the catholics
[2:33:11] see we we we see these stories in
[2:33:13] scripture but it has a much deeper
[2:33:15] meaning
[2:33:16] but i want to tell you something the
[2:33:18] script we read it
[2:33:20] while samson was bound it was making
[2:33:21] sport the scripture said there was
[2:33:24] something that happened while he was
[2:33:25] bound
[2:33:26] and while the church has been bound the
[2:33:29] devil making sport like they ain't got
[2:33:31] the power no more that
[2:33:33] i mean god ain't doing what he used to
[2:33:35] do no more in the church
[2:33:36] the church i mean just been made fun of
[2:33:38] by the devil there was one thing
[2:33:40] happening to samson while he was in
[2:33:43] bondage
[2:33:46] his hair
[2:33:49] began to grow back
[2:33:53] and them devils didn't know what that
[2:33:54] meant that his hair was going back his
[2:33:56] glory was coming back
[2:33:59] come on somebody hey man that that hair
[2:34:01] represented his glory his glory was
[2:34:03] coming back
[2:34:04] his strength was coming back without
[2:34:05] them realizing it
[2:34:08] i might not have my eyes or cc some
[2:34:10] people can't see scripture the way they
[2:34:11] need to see scripture
[2:34:13] they don't have eyes to see they don't
[2:34:15] have ears to hear
[2:34:17] but when god anoints them and gives them
[2:34:19] the ears to hear the eyes see i pray
[2:34:20] that they'll go free
[2:34:23] finally sampson's hair start growing
[2:34:25] back now samson knew that that anointing
[2:34:27] was coming
[2:34:29] the back of god has come back to the
[2:34:31] church the word of god has been restored
[2:34:33] back to the church god
[2:34:34] promised that he would do these things
[2:34:35] before the coming of the great and
[2:34:36] dreadful day of the lord
[2:34:38] as as the power began to come back
[2:34:42] samson reached over and it's about three
[2:34:44] or four thousand
[2:34:45] philistines gathered a man at this this
[2:34:48] event where they're making sports
[2:34:49] look at him he used to do this to us and
[2:34:51] now look at what we're doing to him
[2:34:53] look at where he's at and say all of a
[2:34:54] sudden samson uh he could feel the
[2:34:56] strength come back he knew them
[2:34:58] all he did just reach back and say that
[2:35:00] the seven locks are back
[2:35:02] grow back hallelujah and sam
[2:35:06] samson say little lad i now i've seen

[2:39:15] father
[2:39:18] what a consolation we can have in
[2:39:21] reading the scripture
[2:39:25] it'd be false christ false anointed ones
[2:39:28] false prophets that would rise but we
[2:39:29] know that there would be at least
[2:39:31] one truth because there couldn't be a
[2:39:33] false unless there was
[2:39:35] a truth father my prayers
[2:39:40] uh that you would help us oh god to
[2:39:44] to be who you've called us to be
[2:39:48] to help us lord to be able to see things
[2:39:50] from the scriptures perspective
[2:39:54] we look through the story of samson and
[2:39:56] just see how the church lord throughout
[2:39:58] the
[2:39:59] uh the history christ brought how they
[2:40:01] were just
[2:40:02] so messed up the gods you promised that
[2:40:05] they would be one without spot or
[2:40:07] wrinkle you promised
[2:40:08] lord that uh god that you would have a
[2:40:11] bride that was ordained not to fall one
[2:40:13] that has
[2:40:14] learned the lessons from the previous uh
[2:40:16] people that have walked to earth lord i
[2:40:18] believe i'm preaching to that group of
[2:40:20] people
[2:40:21] here today i pray lord that the word
[2:40:24] that has been spoken would
[2:40:26] sink into the depths of our soul that we
[2:40:28] would understand what we're called to
[2:40:30] this not by accident it's not by chance
[2:40:33] lord but we're that little group that's
[2:40:35] representing the shock of hair that's
[2:40:36] grown back in samson
[2:40:39] that would destroy more philistines lord
[2:40:41] as a and are going
[2:40:44] oh god that's uh we know that there's a
[2:40:46] rapture weight in this church and we'll
[2:40:48] destroy more philistines that are going
[2:40:50] that's what's that that's going to be
[2:40:51] the proof that we were that we were
[2:40:53] following the truth the rapture is only
[2:40:55] for the bride
[2:40:57] father i pray that the people would just
[2:40:59] stay focused in this hour
[2:41:02] the angel of the lord when he told the
[2:41:04] angel pick up your pen and write
[2:41:06] he gave us warning that many would just
[2:41:09] be looking for signs wonders and
[2:41:11] miracles lord but they'd be
[2:41:13] disobeying the word and and god we don't
[2:41:16] want to
[2:41:16] put the word second we want to put the
[2:41:18] word of god first
[2:41:20] help us lord to follow with everything
[2:41:23] we have
