[36:45] things that he's dealing with in his
[36:47] body and he was kind of you know feeling
[36:51] the shortest of breath so he checked me
[36:52] to the hospital just you know wanted to
[36:54] be sure that he didn't contract this
[36:57] virus and and I was calling them
[37:00] throughout the week and you said no they
[37:03] ran tests but then gave me the results
[37:04] yet you know say well just it's good
[37:07] that you were there and I haven't having
[37:09] to be home he say yeah thank God for my
[37:10] free apartment one-bedroom apartment
[37:13] here at the hospital let's say well
[37:14] praise the Lord for this that's the way
[37:16] to look at it you know and so we talked
[37:19] again on yesterday they say a pastor
[37:20] Jack they came and did some more tests
[37:22] they didn't give me results from the
[37:23] original tests but they came in to some
[37:26] more tests they did some you know a swab
[37:28] in both nostrils
[37:30] I said well brother we're just gonna
[37:32] believe God there's gonna come back
[37:34] negative and he sent me in Texas say
[37:36] yeah the attacks they say the tests came
[37:38] back negative such a brother Jeff you

[38:04] I'm waiting on the MRI and say that the
[38:07] Lord willing I get to go home today or

[38:12] the hospital and they said God is good
[38:17] pastor Jack he's been good to me and my
[38:20] in the time of need so we just thank the
[38:23] Lord for watching over my brother and
[38:25] then touching him you can be seated just
[38:28] for a moment just want to just make a
[38:30] couple of announcements as you can see
[38:34] just doing a few things a little
[38:36] different and for those of you that want
[38:40] to give we're gonna use the box there on
[38:43] the table
[38:43] amen you can use that on your way out a
[38:46] man as well as as we're doing service
[38:48] like this just until further notice if
[38:53] you want to give on your way and you can
[38:56] do that too just put it in the box and
[38:58] and you know we'll handle things
[39:00] accordingly if you get want to give
[39:02] online our church website is Spirit of
[39:05] Truth Tabernacle org you can click on
[39:08] the home menu and then donations
[39:11] underneath that and there's instructions
[39:13] on how to give if you have our church
[39:16] app you can also give from our church
[39:18] app there's a little button there so we
[39:22] just want to invite you to do that now I
[39:28] got so much to be thankful for that is
[39:33] it's hard not to give them priest and
[39:36] man it's hard not to give them praise
[39:38] and one of the things that I'm grateful
[39:41] for is you know our church before this
[39:48] virus hit and you know we were just
[39:52] believing God for some things and and I
[39:55] used to I don't know I think I told
[39:57] y'all before how we used to be about
[39:58] three weeks late always getting out our
[40:01] rent you know to the two landlord but
[40:04] you know we were always made it every
[40:06] month but it was just three weeks late
[40:07] but pretty much at the beginning of this
[40:10] year we've been hitting my rent the
[40:13] first of the month
[40:19] and even in the midst of this God still
[40:25] allowed us to be able to pay our rent
[40:26] the verse of the money raised long now
[40:30] what that told me is that God not only
[40:33] making a way for the church but that
[40:36] even God making away for his people to
[40:40] make in the midst of all this that we've
[40:43] gone through so III just like I said
[40:46] this too much - too much that he's doing
[40:52] that I just can't you know stop praising
[40:54] them and I didn't want to mention you
[40:57] know we had started and I'm not I'm all
[40:59] just mentioning this I'm not gonna be
[41:01] pulling but before the virus epidemic
[41:04] and all this we've made an announcement
[41:07] that we wanted to get up get a new
[41:10] keyboard for the church amen and keep
[41:12] working on cost us a pretty good amount
[41:14] of money it's gonna be about twenty five
[41:15] hundred dollars now I'm saying this
[41:17] because I already see us coming back
[41:20] together worship in the way we're used
[41:23] to worship I already see that I'm
[41:25] getting ready for that right this this
[41:28] this right here is temporary what we're
[41:30] doing right now temporary and so I'm an
[41:32] expectation for the UH you know for all
[41:37] for all of us people to come back
[41:38] together and I'm not letting this
[41:40] expectation for that I'm expectation for
[41:42] a new church and the school that I still
[41:44] got that on my prayer list
[41:45] I'm believing God ain't man and so we
[41:49] are we put that out and just asking
[41:51] everyone that if you want to donate
[41:52] towards it we actually will and one of
[41:56] the precious sisters got just made some
[41:58] envelopes for us and and I was very
[42:00] grateful and I just put these out you'll
[42:02] see them on the table these are
[42:03] envelopes and it's just for any special
[42:05] projects a lot cheaper to use these
[42:09] envelopes for those things and use the
[42:12] the tithe envelopes a tithe and offering
[42:14] envelope so this is a you know if you
[42:17] see that out there on the table just to
[42:18] project
[42:19] that's what it's for just trying to
[42:21] explain that to everyone so that's for
[42:23] like the piano and there's some you know
[42:26] there's some other things gonna be birth
[42:27] out of this experience we're already
[42:29] looking at having to upgrade our sound
[42:31] equipment on but video equipment some
[42:33] things that we want to do there and so I
[42:36] just believe God got everything under
[42:38] control if you want to donate to those
[42:40] projects God give us some extra you can
[42:43] give a little extra a man a man I know
[42:45] he tried to save everything we can't
[42:46] because we don't know when we're gonna
[42:47] run out of toilet paper
[42:51] freezes look that's just a joke but God
[42:54] is good in any way amen but if you
[42:57] desire Amen we want to just give that to
[42:59] you also I wanted to just give a update
[43:06] on our Building Fund and and then just
[43:09] one other thing

[46:55] so we uh if anybody else if there's
[46:57] different needs I am getting texts and

[47:28] and we'll do all we can to try to help
[47:30] with that so God is good and God is good
[47:35] as you can see this is our second
[47:39] service today we had a service early and
[47:41] brother quick who actually spoke for us
[47:42] and did a wonderful job we were very
[47:45] very very happy with that and he was
[47:50] actually prepared to speak again to the
[47:55] twelve o'clock service and I'd say well
[47:59] not you know it's up to you if you want
[48:01] if you want to do it I do have a message
[48:03] prepared you say know if you got
[48:05] something prepared you go ahead and
[48:06] speak that way everybody get a different
[48:09] voice because they already got the first
[48:11] service recorded so now to get something
[48:13] you know different
[48:13] and I say well we'll figure this out as
[48:16] we go along you know cuz I could do the
[48:21] the megachurch model and what the
[48:24] megachurch model is is preached the same
[48:26] sermon in each service
[48:28] right but there's one big difference
[48:34] a man in the megachurch model and what
[48:37] we have going on here
[48:40] the service is never the same
[48:44] I mean even from the what I mean brother
[48:48] Solomon brought us some song this
[48:49] morning and man I was just enjoying that
[48:51] and worshiping he was Jesus is a mighty
[48:55] God coronavirus bow before him he is a
[48:57] mighty God man we was worshiping then
[49:00] brother Troy come out here and my god
[49:03] just totally different you know it got
[49:05] this thing about the blood he could have
[49:07] just kept going from one Bluffs on to
[49:10] the next blood side and sound of like
[49:12] the house was packed man we were
[49:15] worsening feeling the presence of Lord I
[49:18] said you can't feel this a man on
[49:23] periscope it's a difference when we come
[49:27] into the house of God that's why I think
[49:30] David when he spoke these words he said
[49:32] I was glad when they said unto me let's
[49:38] go into the house of the Lord not see
[49:42] that hole I got to go into the house of
[49:45] the Lord I can't wait for them a lift or
[49:48] restrictions
[49:49] [Applause]
[49:51] 6560 they can go into the house let
[49:54] alone and you talk about some six year
[49:57] olds and seven year olds have it's
[50:10] something about when Saints get together
[50:12] things begin to happen
[50:14] tell them brothers see when I say that
[50:16] this is why we got to have a church you
[50:17] feel that man it's a totally different
[50:21] totally different feeling when we come
[50:22] here together amen so we just thank God
[50:25] and and we're very grateful for
[50:27] everybody just you know just Biden by
[50:31] the protocols and things that we put in
[50:32] place we're doing the best we can to
[50:36] give Caesar what is Caesar's and also
[50:41] give God what is God's we must have a
[50:44] balance in that Jesus spoke both things
[50:47] and we must as believers have a balance
[50:50] so you know we want to you know it's
[50:53] sometimes we do things is to bring
[50:55] protection to those around us you know
[50:58] and and everybody's faith is at
[51:00] different levels that's okay I'm not I'm
[51:02] not gonna put this person down because
[51:04] they faith not in the same level as my
[51:06] faith right if somebody want to come in
[51:08] here with a mass that's fine
[51:10] at least they hear right Amen someone
[51:14] say but but we have protocols we have
[51:16] you know that the seating you know that
[51:18] we're doing trying to six six six six
[51:20] six six feet separation so we're doing
[51:24] that washing our hands you know anything
[51:27] else that we need to do we want to do
[51:29] and I think there's nothing wrong with
[51:31] those things that's to me to me it is
[51:34] not a lack of faith because you do that
[51:38] it is not actually it's sanitary they
[51:44] man right it's sanitary so I mean and
[51:49] you know this praise the Lord I think
[51:56] man you know there's probably a good
[52:00] time good time for people you're doing
[52:04] this is I'm it's to me I'm I'm I'm
[52:09] surprised they have to actually announce
[52:11] for people to wash their hands
[52:14] you know some people go certain places
[52:16] if you get what I'm saying and they
[52:19] don't wash their hands so I'm glad they
[52:22] keeping it before wash your hands it's
[52:25] sanitary hey man praise the Lord glory
[52:28] to God amen so so we want to do those
[52:31] things and we just appreciate everybody
[52:34] working with us in that and and we'll
[52:37] continue to just kind of function like
[52:38] this as we go along
[52:40] next week is Easter I do want to say
[52:43] thank God for the governor that has
[52:46] taken a stand to allow churches he
[52:49] deemed Church as essential and and see
[52:53] the way I look at that is if go on the
[52:55] Walmart or Publix a man in the grocery
[52:58] store is he central people got to get
[52:59] food natural food Church also is where
[53:03] we get food spiritual food right and and
[53:08] it's essential
[53:09] so I thank God I know he's gonna take a
[53:11] lot of backlash for his decision but we
[53:14] pray that God would give him strength he
[53:16] also understanding he has a newborn he
[53:19] has a newborn baby that uh you know and
[53:22] and he's in public eye and everything
[53:24] too so a lot and not only him but
[53:28] there's so many on the front line we
[53:29] even have people in our church that are
[53:30] on the front line we want to remember
[53:32] them in prayer remember uh since the
[53:35] tinier assist Elise you know different
[53:38] ones that even in our area I remember
[53:40] another assistant brother James Church
[53:42] she works at the hospital there we were
[53:44] there she was there when we were there
[53:46] visiting sister vernest family so we
[53:49] have saints that are in these in these
[53:51] frontline positions we want to remember
[53:53] them in prayer we got a request from
[53:54] sister real on this morning to pray over
[53:57] a friend of hers that was in New York
[53:59] nests on the front line she contracted
[54:01] the virus
[54:01] she worked in
[54:03] the virus is spread in her house or
[54:05] children have it her mom has it and so
[54:07] we want to remember them and prayer that
[54:09] God would just deliver them and we want
[54:12] to remember our own and prayer that God
[54:13] would keep them in this time so we just
[54:17] take the look for all things and I think
[54:20] that's all I need to share for right now
[54:22] oh if with Easter coming up we we need
[54:26] if you know somebody that might get in
[54:29] touch with I want to go to church and or
[54:31] you've invited somebody to come to
[54:32] church we just need you just please keep
[54:34] us informed
[54:35] try not to surprise us like Sunday
[54:37] morning if you know ahead of time please
[54:39] let us know because we are trying to
[54:40] plan things appropriately so we stay
[54:43] within the guidelines that have been
[54:45] given to us one of the main things that
[54:46] the president I mean the governor said
[54:48] is that following CDC's guidelines for
[54:51] separation that that's what he's saying
[54:53] all right that was a Keith Keith
[54:55] statement for following CDC's guidelines
[54:57] for separation so we don't want to pile
[55:00] 200 people in here we don't want to do
[55:03] that hey man not now there is a time we
[55:06] gonna be able to do that but now we
[55:07] don't want to do that and that's not
[55:09] because we're free
[55:11] that's because CDC recommended it a man
[55:15] and the governor is trying to find a
[55:17] balance or a mix here and we're trying
[55:20] to work with them amen
[55:22] all right so if that's the situation we
[55:25] want to we just if you know somebody
[55:28] that might be coming please let us know
[55:30] well in advance so we can just kind of
[55:32] get people shifted around accordingly
[55:34] and let them know as they come that we
[55:36] are following some guidelines and so
[55:38] don't get upset with us when we do
[55:40] certain things what we found out from
[55:41] the Prophet is that if a person get
[55:43] upset when the deacon Aksum do certain
[55:46] things for the brand i'm saying that
[55:48] that person that gets upset got the
[55:50] wrong spirit I just read that a couple
[55:54] weeks ago
[55:54] amen and and and in in Bible study
[55:58] praise the Lord
[55:59] so we don't want to have the wrong
[56:01] spirit a man all right oh I took some
[56:07] air at the room with that cool
[56:10] but let's pray we're gonna pray and then
[56:14] actually I tell you what let me read a
[56:16] couple scriptures were prayed for some
[56:19] of these frontline people pray for this
[56:21] lady in New York and just pray over the
[56:24] Word of God here today let's let's read
[56:28] from revelation 3 verse 8 through 10 and
[56:35] then also we read from James 1 and 12
[56:40] also I wanted to say praise Luria's
[56:43] system - no was baptized last week in
[56:47] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[56:50] we thank God for taking that step and
[56:54] her in her in her life and you know

[57:14] God doing something in her heart and we
[57:17] have been praying and asking God for a
[57:19] revival to start in the youth and and I
[57:23] believe God is doing some things so I
[57:25] certainly appreciate what I see the Lord
[57:27] doing amen and her revelation 3 verse 8
[57:32] says I know thy works the whole I have
[57:36] set before thee an open door and no man
[57:39] can shut it but thou hast a little
[57:42] strength and has kept my word and has
[57:45] not denied my name
[57:47] the whole I will make them of the
[57:51] synagogue of Satan which say they are
[57:52] Jews and are not but do lie the whole I
[57:56] will make them to come and worship
[57:57] before thy feet and to know that I have
[58:00] loved thee because thou has kept the
[58:03] word of my patience I also will keep
[58:06] thee from the hour of temptation which
[58:10] shall come upon all the world ain't that
[58:14] something it is scriptures say this our
[58:17] temptation is going to
[58:19] upon all of the world right to try them
[58:24] that dwell upon the earth amen

[58:31] James chapter 1

[58:48] and I just want to read verse 12 here
[58:51] James chapter 1 blessed is the man that
[58:55] endureth temptation for when he is tried
[58:59] he shall receive the crown of life which
[59:04] the LORD hath promised to them that love
[59:07] him a man praise God the Lord had a
[59:11] blessing to the reading of his word

[1:00:37] protection over each one we don't we

[1:01:31] magnified in this place it's in Jesus
[1:01:33] name we pray amen amen god bless you can
[1:01:36] receive
[1:01:57] praise the Lord
[1:02:07] amen so I want to just take for our
[1:02:12] subject I will keep you thank you so
[1:02:16] much I will keep you from the hour of
[1:02:18] temptation Amen I will keep you from the
[1:02:22] hour of temptation just let's start out
[1:02:28] here with a quote from the original
[1:02:32] church age amen brother Branham preached
[1:02:34] this in 1960 and the Philadelphian
[1:02:38] Church age is is what I want to refer to
[1:02:41] a man it says now this great temptation
[1:02:50] the hour of temptation shall come to try
[1:02:54] the whole world goes into the
[1:02:59] tribulation a man praise the Lord this
[1:03:02] hour of temptation has come to try the
[1:03:06] whole world a man goes into tribulation
[1:03:11] just in a few minutes we'll see it goes
[1:03:14] on into the tribulation and the
[1:03:16] tribulation did not come in the days of
[1:03:19] Wesley so what age are we in what's this
[1:03:24] Dorset before it's between the Wesley
[1:03:28] where the church is headed right now and
[1:03:30] already in to the land of C&H but this
[1:03:34] little place right in here within the
[1:03:37] last 35 40 years has been an open door
[1:03:41] setting right before the people to come
[1:03:43] in and God will take the remnant and
[1:03:46] seal it off amen I like that
[1:03:50] agar gonna take the rim and steal it off
[1:03:52] we would preach in a couple weeks ago
[1:03:53] about no killing until a sealing right
[1:03:58] no killing into the ceiling and it was
[1:04:01] for those that were silent crying for
[1:04:03] the abominations in the city the ink
[1:04:05] corn rod I was taking his rye and and he
[1:04:08] was sealing those in before before the
[1:04:12] the other riders would come and destroy
[1:04:14] he was syllables brother branham said
[1:04:16] that happened on the day of Pentecost
[1:04:17] right before Titus came in and destroyed
[1:04:20] the the Roman I mean he was a Roman
[1:04:22] generally come in and destroyed
[1:04:24] Jerusalem but before he destroyed there
[1:04:26] was a sealing took place at Pentecost
[1:04:28] glory to God but the promise of
[1:04:30] Pentecost was not only for that time
[1:04:32] that promise is something that extends
[1:04:35] even all the way down to today amen
[1:04:37] Joel said I'll pour out my spirit upon
[1:04:40] all flesh hallelujah in the last days
[1:04:44] I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[1:04:46] and and and this so this is something
[1:04:48] that we should be looking for I see all
[1:04:51] of hell breaking loose but I'm looking
[1:04:54] for all of heaven amen glory to God I'm
[1:04:58] I'm the expectation for all of heaven so
[1:05:01] now the Prophet goes on it says this
[1:05:02] says upsetting right before the people
[1:05:06] to come in and God will take the remnant
[1:05:08] and seal it off and they'll go into a
[1:05:12] lukewarm and he'll spurt them out of his
[1:05:15] mouth the work will be the work will be
[1:05:17] cut short up goes the church and here
[1:05:22] comes the Antichrist moving in for
[1:05:24] destruction oh my I want to make sure
[1:05:28] the church is settled on some of these
[1:05:30] things because you know as we see things
[1:05:32] kind of shaping up even right now we
[1:05:36] know that the purpose I should say the
[1:05:40] Accord in description according to
[1:05:42] prophecy we know what role the Catholic
[1:05:45] Church plays a man we know a man that
[1:05:48] are they haven't they have a lot to
[1:05:49] fulfill according to the book of
[1:05:51] Revelation and also here with like I
[1:05:53] mentioned before with everything kind of
[1:05:56] striking Italy a man I mean they had
[1:05:59] more deaths in Italy than anywhere else
[1:06:01] in the world it was a perfect center
[1:06:03] right for the Antichrist to take a ride
[1:06:06] hallelujah but before we see these
[1:06:09] things according to this quote the
[1:06:11] Prophet said up ghost's the church a man
[1:06:16] goes to church so even I'm not looking
[1:06:20] for them to crown the Pope and make him
[1:06:22] something greater than what he is amen I
[1:06:24] not looking for a man all these churches
[1:06:27] to kind of come back together which
[1:06:28] they've already done and submit
[1:06:30] themselves to the Catholic Church
[1:06:31] leadership I'm not looking for crap to
[1:06:34] prosper according to the scripture once
[1:06:37] the Pope gets involved in economy
[1:06:39] hallelujah I'm not looking for that but
[1:06:41] what I am looking for us goes to church
[1:06:44] glory to God you can be in your house
[1:06:48] treatment but uh goes to church
[1:06:51] hallelujah we want to be ready for the
[1:06:53] time is at hand
[1:06:55] he says up goes to church and here comes
[1:06:58] the Antichrist moving in for destruction
[1:07:00] just perfect fits with the whole Bible
[1:07:04] right on around now it goes on and makes
[1:07:09] a couple statements I just want to keep
[1:07:12] reading here says all right now and
[1:07:13] here's the appearing of the sleeping
[1:07:16] virgin also here proves that the last of
[1:07:20] the church changes moves to the first
[1:07:22] part of Pentecost look at that here
[1:07:25] proves that the last of the church
[1:07:27] changes moves to the first part of
[1:07:31] Pentecost so we ought to be looking for
[1:07:33] Pentecostal blessings in our myths amen
[1:07:35] the last of the church ages
[1:07:37] moves to the first to the first part of
[1:07:39] Pentecost for they go on into the great
[1:07:42] tribulation which shall come which did
[1:07:46] not come in the Wesley age insanity 11th
[1:07:49] verse all right a crown of life the
[1:07:51] eleventh verse said behold I come
[1:07:53] quickly what quickly after this now see
[1:07:56] behold I thought I hope fast to that
[1:07:59] which thou hast keep on to it that no
[1:08:03] man take away thy crown glory to God
[1:08:06] that no man take away thy crown now he's
[1:08:11] actually he's uh referring to revelation
[1:08:13] 3 verse 11 behold I come quickly hold
[1:08:16] that fast which thou hast that no man
[1:08:18] take away thy crown now look at what it
[1:08:21] says what is a crown what is a crown
[1:08:24] it's a crown means that you have a
[1:08:27] domain Oh glory to God Amen a crown
[1:08:31] means that you have a domain do you know
[1:08:34] God gave the earth to us this
[1:08:36] man's domain amen crown means that we
[1:08:40] have a domain he said he says and we are
[1:08:43] sons of God it says you're your king in
[1:08:45] your crown and we are sons of God when
[1:08:48] we're crowned with eternal life and our
[1:08:50] domain is the earth make you priests and
[1:08:53] kings unto God is the right seed there
[1:08:56] you are
[1:08:57] don't let no man take away your crown do
[1:09:01] you realize that the word Coronas
[1:09:04] means crown hallelujah amen and and
[1:09:09] through prayer we're gonna have to fight
[1:09:11] this coronavirus that's why I was up
[1:09:14] this morning while I was praying and the
[1:09:16] Lord just kind of dropped that that
[1:09:17] scripted down in my spirit you know
[1:09:19] because people my tax you well why do
[1:09:21] you go to church why do you do this why
[1:09:23] did you that say well and I'm glad that
[1:09:24] the governor made it essential because
[1:09:27] when I look at the scripture the Bible
[1:09:30] say if my people now look the doctors
[1:09:34] don't have an answer the test kits
[1:09:36] really don't work it's a lot of stuff
[1:09:38] that's wrong with this nobody has an
[1:09:40] answer but the bible does have the
[1:09:43] answer and they say if my people which
[1:09:46] are called by my name shall humble
[1:09:49] themselves and pray seek my face turn
[1:09:53] from their wicked ways then will I hear
[1:09:56] from heaven not only that God said he
[1:09:58] would heal the land God said that if
[1:10:02] we're looking for cute let's get got
[1:10:04] involved and rather than come against
[1:10:07] the church supporting the church with
[1:10:09] your prayers stand toe-to-toe with me
[1:10:12] stand side-by-side with the church with
[1:10:15] your prayers

[1:10:24] glory to God glory to God amen look at
[1:10:28] this now I want to just read a little
[1:10:32] bit here from the message the contest

[1:11:07] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[1:11:11] his might put on the whole armor of God
[1:11:15] and I see they want us to put on all
[1:11:16] these other little things but I want to
[1:11:18] encourage you as a church put on the
[1:11:21] whole armor of God amen that you may be
[1:11:24] able to stand against the wiles of the
[1:11:28] devil these are tricks from the enemy
[1:11:30] any disease it's coming from the devil
[1:11:33] right amen you might be able to stand
[1:11:35] against the wiles of the devil for we
[1:11:37] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[1:11:40] against principalities against powers
[1:11:43] against the rules of darkness of this of
[1:11:46] this world against spiritual wickedness
[1:11:49] in high places even when the whole world
[1:11:51] is on lockdown you have political leads
[1:11:54] are still trying to push different
[1:11:56] agendas they trying to take advantage of
[1:11:59] the people in a time like this we bind
[1:12:01] that spirit in the name of Jesus amen
[1:12:03] we're not gonna be taking advantage of
[1:12:06] glory to God since I went for takin to
[1:12:10] you the whole arm of God that you may be
[1:12:12] able to withstand in the evil day and

[1:12:22] and having on the breastplate of
[1:12:25] righteousness and your feet shod with
[1:12:27] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[1:12:29] above all taking the shield of faith
[1:12:32] wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
[1:12:35] the fiery darts of the wicked and take
[1:12:39] the helmet of salvation and the sword of
[1:12:42] the Spirit which is the word of God
[1:12:46] praying always with all prayer and
[1:12:48] supplication in the spirit and watching
[1:12:51] thereunto with all perseverance and
[1:12:53] supplication for all states and for me
[1:12:56] that
[1:12:57] which may be given to me that I may open
[1:12:59] my mouth boldly to make known the
[1:13:02] mystery of the gospel for which I am a
[1:13:07] ambassador in bonds that therein I may
[1:13:11] speak boldly as I ought to speak praise
[1:13:14] the Lord so brother Branham in this
[1:13:16] quote is written he's read the scripture
[1:13:18] now he's making a mint a few comments
[1:13:20] let's look at this in the message the
[1:13:21] contest it says if I should speak the
[1:13:24] context that I wrote down that I was
[1:13:27] going to start on this afternoon we'd be
[1:13:29] here at 5 o'clock in the morning someone
[1:13:32] says that'll be alright and says but I
[1:13:34] but I want to just read a word thank you
[1:13:36] from from Ephesians 2:6 chapter 12
[1:13:39] verses and just for a few moments topic
[1:13:41] for courage for we wrestle not against
[1:13:43] flesh and blood but against
[1:13:45] principalities against powers against
[1:13:48] rulers of darkness of this world against
[1:13:50] spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:13:52] spiritual spiritual wickedness in high
[1:13:54] places
[1:13:55] I'd like to draw from that a little ten
[1:13:58] of 15-minute context
[1:14:00] it says rather I want to call it the
[1:14:02] contest he said a contest is a test of
[1:14:07] strength and where we have a test strip
[1:14:10] we used to have the Indian used to put a
[1:14:12] fire and they would put so many men on
[1:14:15] this end of the rope and so many men on
[1:14:17] this end the tug of war the contest of
[1:14:20] strength would pull the losing party
[1:14:22] across the fire and now we know there's
[1:14:25] many things and we can base this upon
[1:14:28] for a few minutes of contest but I want
[1:14:30] to speak for these minutes
[1:14:32] amen quickly upon the greatest contest
[1:14:35] there is that's between the church and
[1:14:37] sing that that great strength of satan
[1:14:41] and we can not and we want to speak of
[1:14:43] the great strength of God in his church
[1:14:45] I was making a comment earlier I said
[1:14:47] you know the Bible actually tells us we
[1:14:49] had to cancel our plans which probably
[1:14:51] going to
[1:14:53] Londyn amen on this week but had to
[1:14:56] cancel all of our plans because it is
[1:14:58] now the script rax it tells us to go
[1:15:00] into all the world and to preach the
[1:15:01] gospel in order for us to be able to
[1:15:04] fulfill that scripture coronavirus has
[1:15:07] to let up off the entire world
[1:15:09] hallelujah amen we can't be limited as
[1:15:12] to where we can go where we can't go God
[1:15:15] gave us a commandment and in order for
[1:15:19] that commandment to be fulfilled he has
[1:15:21] to bring a peace into the entire world I
[1:15:24] believe God's gonna do that I believe
[1:15:27] God's gonna do that Hollywood and he's
[1:15:29] not doing it
[1:15:30] Amen for any other reason just to see
[1:15:32] his word actually for feel amen glory to
[1:15:34] God look at this he goes on and says
[1:15:36] I'll cuz we're the contest churches I
[1:15:38] said it's Satan trying to test his power
[1:15:41] and I can I can guarantee you a man the
[1:15:43] power Satan is not more powerful than
[1:15:46] the powerful power of God he's not
[1:15:48] stronger than God he came with stangard
[1:15:50] amen
[1:15:51] glory to God he says we want to speak on
[1:15:53] the great strength of God in his church
[1:15:54] now this great contest has been going on
[1:15:58] for many years
[1:15:59] it started in heaven and Satan was
[1:16:01] kicked out into the earth and then
[1:16:03] become an enemy to God's people and
[1:16:06] since then he's used all of his strength
[1:16:09] and his strategy to try to pull God's
[1:16:12] people across the fires or into his
[1:16:14] fights this has been the devil's amen
[1:16:17] objective since and we know that who has
[1:16:21] the most power God does and God when he
[1:16:24] gained his people the best thing that he
[1:16:27] can that he could to combat Satan with
[1:16:30] was his words the best thing we can use
[1:16:34] to combat the devil is with us where
[1:16:36] every time you feel a symptom you know
[1:16:40] they say when you get a little scratchy
[1:16:41] voice write anything you know you sneeze
[1:16:46] and now you know your brain actually
[1:16:48] tells you to sneeze your brain it's a
[1:16:52] normal function of the brain - you know
[1:16:54] you got to speak let it loose knees now
[1:16:57] unfortunately we've got a hat sneezes we
[1:17:00] got we you know we got to be careful
[1:17:02] soon I mean I was on a little video card
[1:17:05] some guys yesterday and at the end of
[1:17:07] the car like off gas a jack all this way
[1:17:13] love my friend
[1:17:14] I mean basic body functions amen
[1:17:18] I'm gonna still be able to do and not be
[1:17:20] classified sick no I'm not sick my
[1:17:26] body's responding to the dust that's in
[1:17:28] the atmosphere praise God I will not
[1:17:32] claim that sickness disease man Church
[1:17:51] glory to God he says my where we know
[1:18:00] who has the most power God does and God
[1:18:03] when He gave His people the best thing
[1:18:05] that he could to combat Satan with was
[1:18:07] with his word so use the word of God to
[1:18:09] fight every symptom was this worth now
[1:18:11] because the word of god because the word
[1:18:14] is god and who's stronger than god so
[1:18:17] the word is God and the word becomes our
[1:18:19] strength
[1:18:20] I like these words amen the word is God
[1:18:24] who's stronger than God so the word is
[1:18:27] God and the word becomes our strength
[1:18:30] God in the church becomes its strength
[1:18:33] to pull Satan into his own fires that he
[1:18:37] is made we're not coming into the fight
[1:18:39] a man will put a devil into his own fire
[1:18:42] that he's mean and the tug goes on now
[1:18:45] jesus said in mark 16 in my name they
[1:18:48] shall cast out devils and that's what
[1:18:50] exactly what we're expecting to do now
[1:18:52] let me read another little statement
[1:18:53] here from the message is this the sign
[1:18:56] of the answer amen we are talking about
[1:19:00] God keeping you in the hour of
[1:19:03] temptation amen
[1:19:05] he promised it I believe he will no
[1:19:09] weapon formed against you gonna prosper
[1:19:10] every tongue that rises against you will
[1:19:12] be condemned a man
[1:19:15] I'm trusting God all the way through
[1:19:17] here this message is this a sign of the
[1:19:19] answer now he makes this statement glory
[1:19:25] to God I love it that message that I
[1:19:29] just read from the contest was preached
[1:19:31] after is this the sign of answer he
[1:19:34] preached these two sermons right at the
[1:19:35] end of 1962 going into 63 and he comes
[1:19:40] in with the contest and then I'm sorry
[1:19:43] yeah a contest was preached after then
[1:19:45] right before he preached that he
[1:19:46] preaches is this the sign of the
[1:19:47] answering and there were some visions
[1:19:50] and dreams that he brought forth and
[1:19:53] that is this assignment in and then 1963
[1:19:56] became a year where God manifested
[1:19:58] something so tremendous with the seven
[1:20:00] angels coming from eternity meeting
[1:20:03] brother Branham in Arizona and taking a
[1:20:05] picture you know with the Prophet there
[1:20:07] while he was out there I mean they they
[1:20:09] took the picture in the sky and the prop
[1:20:10] was out there and God gave him
[1:20:11] instruction and go back into
[1:20:13] Jeffersonville and preach on the seven
[1:20:15] seals which were in the book of
[1:20:16] Revelation and he brought us that a man
[1:20:18] he brought us that so very significant
[1:20:21] moments in his ministry and and where
[1:20:24] we're feeding on these things here in
[1:20:26] 1962 is this a sign of the unserved he
[1:20:30] makes this statement says we all know
[1:20:33] that we're living in a glorious time for
[1:20:35] the church hallelujah don't look like it
[1:20:37] but we are we're living in a glorious
[1:20:41] time for the church but a horrible time
[1:20:43] for the unbeliever and we're living and
[1:20:46] one of the most dangerous times of all
[1:20:48] all that ever was since the world began
[1:20:51] no prophet nor apostille never in no
[1:20:55] time ever lived in such a time as we
[1:20:58] live now can you imagine that who we
[1:21:01] gonna depend on who we go to to get
[1:21:03] instruction a man and and pull from they
[1:21:05] experience we go to God a man we go to
[1:21:08] God because nobody's ever lived in a
[1:21:10] time like this before
[1:21:12] nobody's ever faced things like this
[1:21:13] before hallelujah amen but with God all
[1:21:16] things are possible he says look at that
[1:21:18] it says this is the end glory to God
[1:21:21] it's written in the skies it's written
[1:21:24] over the face of the earth it's written
[1:21:26] in every newspaper this
[1:21:28] is the end if you can if you can read
[1:21:31] the handwriting the Prophet the prophets
[1:21:35] lived in a time when the handwriting was
[1:21:37] on the wall for a nation glory to God
[1:21:41] they live in a time a man when the hand
[1:21:44] right was on the wall for just one
[1:21:46] nation a nation but we're living when
[1:21:50] the handwriting is on the wall for a
[1:21:53] time all nations earth everything time
[1:21:58] is at the end so we must search the
[1:22:01] scriptures the final hour that we're
[1:22:04] living I was I was blessed when I read
[1:22:07] that you know because there's never been
[1:22:09] a time where the whole world like this
[1:22:11] has been shut down a man you know that
[1:22:13] they're fair States they've had our
[1:22:14] different flus and everything that's
[1:22:17] kind of hit in different places and but
[1:22:20] but the way that the whole world has
[1:22:21] been on a lockdown nobody's ever faced
[1:22:24] nothing like this I was talking to
[1:22:25] brother Guinta just the other day and
[1:22:27] say you know we have limits as to how
[1:22:28] many PT stay here in the UK we have a
[1:22:31] limit only two people can meet together
[1:22:33] to - now you know what we what we need
[1:22:36] to do is thank God that it's not that
[1:22:38] bad for us right but I say only two can
[1:22:41] meet together now now that just makes it
[1:22:42] really really difficult for anybody to
[1:22:44] get anything done but the whole world is
[1:22:47] on a lockdown we've never had it like
[1:22:50] this before we're facing things but you
[1:22:53] know with this kind of pressure my
[1:22:54] expectation I'm deadly lord if if this
[1:22:57] is if this is the time for you to come
[1:22:59] get your prize and I want to be ready to
[1:23:01] go hey man I don't want to be playing no
[1:23:03] games I want to make sure that my my
[1:23:05] lamp is trimmed I got some extra oil
[1:23:07] right I want to be ready if this is the
[1:23:10] and if this is the bridegroom call I
[1:23:12] want to be ready to go glory to God
[1:23:15] hallelujah now we're living in a very
[1:23:18] dangerous time but when we get to these
[1:23:20] moments like this and you know I've just
[1:23:22] kind of went back and just thinking on
[1:23:24] my mind in my mind just just different
[1:23:28] different ones that went through in
[1:23:30] Scripture and how God kept them in the
[1:23:33] hour of temptation hallelujah glory to
[1:23:37] God if God kept them I want to tell you
[1:23:40] that that
[1:23:41] God is going to keep you glory to God
[1:23:44] when the Hebrew boys were facing their
[1:23:48] hour of temptation now I want you to try
[1:23:51] to understand that when the Hebrew boys
[1:23:53] was going through a temptation it was
[1:23:56] the government that was actually
[1:23:58] bringing the pressure on to these boys
[1:24:00] amen
[1:24:01] it was it was it was a Nebuchadnezzar
[1:24:04] who's the King representing the
[1:24:06] government he said now if you're not
[1:24:08] willing to bow down amen when we play
[1:24:10] the music when we do this when we do
[1:24:12] that everybody else has bow down we just
[1:24:15] want y'all to do what everybody else is
[1:24:17] doing and you know and they said when we
[1:24:19] do that we don't play the music we got
[1:24:20] to give you a chance bow down and just
[1:24:22] you know everything gonna be alright
[1:24:24] when those boys refuse to bow down glory
[1:24:27] to God those boys say look if I'm caught

[1:24:34] written in the record books is that we
[1:24:36] said I got is able to deliver us that's
[1:24:39] what we believe but if he chooses not to
[1:24:41] deliver we still won't bow to your image

[1:24:49] in that hour Amen God did a mighty thing
[1:24:54] for the Hebrew boys God kept them in
[1:24:57] their hour of temptation that our
[1:25:00] weather had pressured about God kept
[1:25:03] them not only did he keep them but he
[1:25:05] met them in the hour of their temptation
[1:25:08] glory God when they when they put the
[1:25:10] stuff to fire seven times hotter glory
[1:25:14] hallelujah they put the fire seven times
[1:25:17] hotter but yet the evil says you can

[1:25:35] I'm a step in God himself left his
[1:25:38] throne in glory he did not send an angel
[1:25:41] but God came himself and I'm gonna tell
[1:25:45] you I've never seen my god defeated if
[1:25:47] God is fighting for me I will not be
[1:25:51] defeated I will keep you in the hour of
[1:25:57] temptation hallelujah Daniel also as a
[1:26:02] decree that came from the leader of that
[1:26:05] day Darius I believe it was and Daniel
[1:26:08] was fighting against the government
[1:26:09] glory to God here Daniel a man was was
[1:26:14] told that if he prayed to any other gods
[1:26:16] a man outside the one that they was
[1:26:19] establishing he was gonna have to go
[1:26:21] into this line Stan well they are sought
[1:26:23] to eat it written and Daniel say you
[1:26:25] know what I made a commitment that I'm
[1:26:28] gonna keep praying to my god it even in
[1:26:30] the midst of this eating I'm still gonna
[1:26:32] keep praying and Daniel went down on his
[1:26:34] knees and you know where Daniel was when
[1:26:37] he was praying day was in his house they
[1:26:40] wouldn't even have Church
[1:26:41] Daniel was out of his own house now you
[1:26:45] know they don't cook your rights away
[1:26:46] when they're coming into your house come
[1:26:50] on when they come in actually into your
[1:26:52] house and telling you you can't pray in
[1:26:55] your own house hallelujah but they said
[1:26:59] I don't care what they say I keep
[1:27:00] praying to my god and when they come and
[1:27:02] they they calm down you're praying and
[1:27:04] then here they bring them before Darius
[1:27:06] Adair so I shouldn't ever sign an order

[1:27:23] hallelujah and we need God in there oh
[1:27:26] I'm so glad to know that God came
[1:27:29] himself in the middle of the limitation
[1:27:59] home I believe that sirs
[1:28:02] I believe that a man I believe that John
[1:28:05] was in our temptation glory to God when
[1:28:08] they sent him to they banished him amen
[1:28:11] but before they banished him they put
[1:28:13] John and oil and trying to board a Holy
[1:28:16] Ghost side of him for 24 hours they
[1:28:18] realized that the oil was doing nothing
[1:28:20] the boiler was doing nothing a man -
[1:28:22] John and they had to just take him out
[1:28:24] and just banished him to the Isle they
[1:28:25] sent him over there and Demi wrote the
[1:28:27] entire book of Revelation you thought it
[1:28:29] was a Amen you thought you were actually
[1:28:31] doing something negative to John but you
[1:28:33] actually blessed not only child but
[1:28:35] everybody else they would come and read
[1:28:37] the book of Revelation it's a blessing
[1:28:39] just to read it hallelujah and churches
[1:28:42] today afraid to preach from it but it's
[1:28:45] a blessing just to read it
[1:28:46] glory to God God kept John in his hour
[1:28:50] of temptation
[1:28:52] Peter was escorted to jail glory to God
[1:28:55] because of him preaching the gospel of
[1:28:57] Christ and when Peter was escorted out
[1:29:00] of drede jail by an angel amen it showed
[1:29:04] that God was keeping even Peter in his
[1:29:07] hour of temptation God gonna keep us in
[1:29:10] our hour of temptation amen
[1:29:13] these examples that I gave you either
[1:29:15] political or a religious attack against
[1:29:19] the believers
[1:29:19] it's either political or religious
[1:29:22] attack against the believers I was just
[1:29:24] saying a man it seemed like the only
[1:29:27] stories that make it to the news is when
[1:29:32] church gathers
[1:29:33] they never say no about somebody passing
[1:29:36] out of Walmart that one little sis was
[1:29:39] in Walmart a few weeks ago lady passed
[1:29:41] out right down the flow you know what
[1:29:43] people did he got our gaap from around
[1:29:46] huh that's what most of them did got
[1:29:48] right from around right they didn't know
[1:29:50] they just we don't know what we don't
[1:29:52] know what to do with this I mean you
[1:29:53] know and and and and you're gonna have a
[1:29:55] lot of that people just don't know what
[1:29:57] to do now nobody reported it nobody said
[1:30:00] nothing what happened to that lady what
[1:30:02] she tested was it why did she pass out
[1:30:04] like that right nobody said nothin
[1:30:06] hallelujah but you let something break
[1:30:08] out here in this church here to be on
[1:30:10] the news as soon as you know it
[1:30:13] hallelujah
[1:30:14] and some of the things I was listening
[1:30:16] to you know and III think there has to
[1:30:18] be a balance here I don't think we
[1:30:20] should have 500 people gathering I don't
[1:30:23] think we should have 200 people gather
[1:30:24] now I think we should keep our numbers
[1:30:26] limited right amen
[1:30:27] I think we should do the social distance
[1:30:29] I I agree with all of that glory to God
[1:30:31] but but you know I mean here you you got
[1:30:35] you got some people that's just kind of
[1:30:36] going over and beyond what they really
[1:30:39] allowing you to do now I think I think
[1:30:40] that part is wrong I think we got to
[1:30:42] find a balance see and we can work
[1:30:43] together glory to God right but uh but
[1:30:46] you know but what I find is that the
[1:30:48] things that are highlighted is the
[1:30:49] things that happen in the church amen
[1:30:52] that's that's what people want to
[1:30:53] promote that that that is a there's an
[1:30:55] attack that's coming Church is not like
[1:30:58] going to a baseball game Church is not
[1:31:01] like going a man to a hockey game Church
[1:31:04] is not like going to some concert I mean
[1:31:07] churches is where we come in contact
[1:31:09] with God amen and we get the spiritual
[1:31:12] food that we need glory to God we get
[1:31:15] the encouragement that we need things
[1:31:17] that we might not have been thinking
[1:31:18] about but we can hear promised in the
[1:31:20] Word of God and it gets on mind self
[1:31:22] I remember the brother that uh that one
[1:31:25] dose stopped working on Sundays and he
[1:31:27] didn't know how to get off and the
[1:31:29] pastor saying that actually boss do we
[1:31:32] like people that work for him that don't
[1:31:33] steal so the active movie like people
[1:31:37] that that that's gonna be faithful to
[1:31:38] come to work on time and actually action
[1:31:41] boss what kind of man would he like
[1:31:42] working for him say well you know he's
[1:31:44] he's because he said
[1:31:45] cameraman you are you ain't stealing
[1:31:47] from him you ain't doing an issue in
[1:31:48] doing that you cheatin so you're doing
[1:31:50] everything right if he liked that he'd
[1:31:52] say the only way to keep you like that
[1:31:53] he better let you go to church
[1:31:55] hallelujah because it's something
[1:31:58] instant as you hear the word of God it
[1:32:00] is forming you and shaping you are
[1:32:02] making you into the person that you're
[1:32:04] supposed to be glory to God this is a
[1:32:07] hour of trial a man this is an hour we
[1:32:10] the greatest our trial that we will face
[1:32:13] or have faces but I but I believe God is
[1:32:16] going to keep us in the hour of
[1:32:19] temptation now look at this I want to
[1:32:22] read a couple other things here this is
[1:32:25] coming out of the six fold purpose of
[1:32:28] Gabe's visit visit to Daniel brother
[1:32:31] Branham makes a statement glory glory
[1:32:34] glory says now we're going to read a
[1:32:37] portion of the scripture I want you to
[1:32:40] listen you that don't have your Bible
[1:32:43] you don't have your Bible get Genesis
[1:32:45] first let's start in the 44th chapter
[1:32:47] beginning with the 27th verse is Joseph
[1:32:50] and Joseph was a perfect type of Christ
[1:32:52] we know that how many knows that hated
[1:32:55] of his brothers why because he was
[1:32:57] spiritual he was he saw visions
[1:32:59] interpret dreams he was a spiritual man
[1:33:01] among his brethren and they hated him
[1:33:04] and his father loved him so was Jesus
[1:33:06] hated of the denominational churches but
[1:33:08] loved of his father God why did they
[1:33:12] hate him because he was spiritual glory
[1:33:15] to God now i'ma tell you they gonna hate
[1:33:16] us too and it's not yes it is because we
[1:33:19] spiritual the reason that we are
[1:33:21] spirituals because we got spiritual
[1:33:23] insight glory to God we're not shook by
[1:33:27] nothing that's going on I mean when I
[1:33:29] see the economy falling apart I know a
[1:33:31] prophet said it's gonna go to a gold
[1:33:33] standard a prophet already told me that
[1:33:35] right they they don't want to touch your
[1:33:38] cash hey man they don't want to touch
[1:33:41] your cash you might have the virus they
[1:33:44] don't want to touch the cash and if you
[1:33:45] ain't got it in plastic that you got you
[1:33:48] got a problem on your hand
[1:33:49] you already got but-but-but-but here
[1:33:51] here profit I already told it's gonna go
[1:33:53] to the gold standard so you just
[1:33:55] watching things shaping up and Rome
[1:33:57] already has to go so you're just
[1:33:59] watching
[1:33:59] everything's shaping up Oh My lordy got
[1:34:02] I know I know it's a lot dying in Italy
[1:34:04] but everybody ain't gonna die I can tell
[1:34:10] you that right now I don't care how
[1:34:11] great the numbers rise everybody ain't
[1:34:14] dying there hallelujah amen there's some
[1:34:18] prophecy left for that part a man saw
[1:34:20] somebody coming forth from Italy all
[1:34:23] right hey man glory to God hallelujah
[1:34:26] amen so so you know don't don't get
[1:34:28] caught up on artists what we wanted to
[1:34:30] cut up is what did that prophet say we
[1:34:31] want to know what did he say to us amen
[1:34:34] now watch this he says Joseph was a
[1:34:36] perfect type of Christ we know that how
[1:34:39] many knows that hate of his brothers
[1:34:40] because he was spiritual he saw visions
[1:34:42] interpret dreams he was a spiritual man
[1:34:44] among his brethren and they hated him
[1:34:46] his father loved him so was Jesus hated
[1:34:48] up the denominational churches but loved
[1:34:50] at his father God why did they hate him
[1:34:53] because he was spiritual not look at
[1:34:55] this it says they talked they said he
[1:34:58] was a fortune-teller a devil you
[1:35:00] remember what Joseph's brother said to
[1:35:02] him here comes that dream see same thing
[1:35:05] and they sold Joseph for almost the same
[1:35:08] price that Judas sold Jesus for thirty
[1:35:11] pieces of silver
[1:35:13] this throwed him into a ditch went and
[1:35:16] told their father that something that
[1:35:18] killed him he was dead but he was taken
[1:35:21] up from the ditch Christ was thrown into
[1:35:23] a ditch and was taken up and from there
[1:35:26] he went to the highest place there was
[1:35:28] on earth a man Joseph went to the right
[1:35:30] hand of Pharaoh and Jesus went to the
[1:35:33] right hand of God in his temptation
[1:35:37] before his exaltation Jesus before he
[1:35:43] was exalted went through temptations now
[1:35:48] and what I'm trying to get you all to
[1:35:50] see is that before we are exalted before
[1:35:54] we actually go up we're gonna have to go
[1:35:57] through a temptation
[1:36:01] now I'm gonna just take my time and read
[1:36:04] this because I want to make sure we
[1:36:06] understand what we yeah
[1:36:08] glory to God this is a scripture it's
[1:36:11] being fulfilled and I want you all to
[1:36:13] remember when Jesus Christ was going to
[1:36:16] the cross there was more scriptures
[1:36:19] fulfilled in the last few hours of his
[1:36:21] life amen then then what was fulfilled
[1:36:24] in all the days that he was living so so
[1:36:26] here as we're getting ready to approach
[1:36:28] the rapture there might be more things
[1:36:30] fulfilled in a very short amount of time
[1:36:32] hallelujah stay spiritual church
[1:36:35] whatever you do stay spirits in the
[1:36:37] south in his temptation before his
[1:36:41] exaltation Jesus before he was exalted
[1:36:45] went through temptation Oh glory amen
[1:36:51] now temptation just so that we
[1:36:53] understand Amen when the devil is
[1:36:56] bringing temptation into our life what
[1:37:00] his purpose is is to actually get us off
[1:37:04] of what God got us here for are off of
[1:37:07] God's divine purpose and he wants to
[1:37:10] shift us into some other purpose amen
[1:37:13] that's what a temptation will do in try
[1:37:16] to shift you from a man God's direction
[1:37:18] in your life to move you over to
[1:37:20] something else
[1:37:21] Oh hallelujah now you hope you all bear
[1:37:24] with me as a as a as it like I mentioned
[1:37:29] last week when I'm preaching I have to
[1:37:32] preach ahead of where we are I just
[1:37:34] can't stop at where we are
[1:37:37] amen I'm preaching ahead of where we are
[1:37:40] you know when brother Branham gave us
[1:37:42] these quotes these things weren't
[1:37:44] happening being he was preaching ahead
[1:37:47] of his day and now we're looking at
[1:37:50] something we're dealing with it now and
[1:37:52] the reason that we can have a an
[1:37:53] assurance and a peace in the in the
[1:37:56] midst of the storms because we know how
[1:37:57] to stay on work at glory to God look
[1:38:00] when the pressure come down I'm supposed
[1:38:02] to be going up amen that's that spot all
[1:38:05] of this thing is doing is squeezing and
[1:38:06] pushing me up brother rod and say Amen
[1:38:08] when the squeeze comes down watch the
[1:38:12] third pool glory to God
[1:38:14] I'm on the expectation for some great
[1:38:15] things from God amen amen amen
[1:38:18] my brother quick who said this morning
[1:38:19] it really felt that much pressure yet we
[1:38:23] still going to the grocery store you
[1:38:25] still got money in the bank you're still
[1:38:28] going to work they said even if you
[1:38:29] ain't going to work they paying you to
[1:38:31] stay home right that's not pressure wait
[1:38:35] till all that buckles and they can't pay
[1:38:37] you no more and there is no more
[1:38:39] government assistance and then you can't
[1:38:41] spend your cash that's pressure
[1:38:44] hallelujah glory to God look at this now
[1:38:47] it's temptation before his exaltation
[1:38:49] now I'll stop I won't read any more of
[1:38:52] the of that quote but there was the
[1:38:57] biggest temptation that Jesus had was
[1:39:00] when it was time to go to Calvary there
[1:39:03] he had to surrender his will to the
[1:39:06] Father he had to pray a prayer that all
[1:39:08] of us should pray God nevertheless not
[1:39:11] my will but thy will be done right and
[1:39:14] and and I think that's a very important
[1:39:16] prayers believers we got to come to this
[1:39:17] spot Lord is not my will but we're gonna
[1:39:19] let your will be done even in the midst
[1:39:21] of this virus I still feel that the will
[1:39:24] of God is being done there's people
[1:39:26] being a reach that would have not been
[1:39:28] reached had this virus not coming
[1:39:31] there's people reading their Bibles that
[1:39:34] would have not read their Bibles had
[1:39:36] this virus not come amen we want to be
[1:39:39] so quick to deliver everybody let me ask
[1:39:43] the question why why you want to deliver
[1:39:47] everybody
[1:39:48] Amen so everybody can praise you
[1:39:51] everybody can exalt you that's not what
[1:39:55] Jesus did I mean sometimes you got to
[1:39:57] wait and just see what God is doing in
[1:39:59] the midst of this Amen hallelujah
[1:40:01] brother quick was troubles about I think
[1:40:04] a leader over in one of these South
[1:40:08] American Nations say to man begin to
[1:40:11] pray like a Pentecostal leader of a
[1:40:15] country praying like that man if we got
[1:40:18] all the other leaders to pray like that
[1:40:20] we'll see God heal the lane heal in turn
[1:40:24] I mean here
[1:40:25] planet oh mama look at this Jesus Jesus
[1:40:30] temptation a man that he had there was
[1:40:35] there at the garden that was that was
[1:40:36] this is his ultimate temptation Satan
[1:40:39] was trying to redirect him to do
[1:40:41] something else but he stayed with what
[1:40:42] God's will was God's plan was but I want
[1:40:44] to pick up amen also here and Luke 4
[1:40:47] let's just read this because this I'm
[1:40:49] also some temptation a man and remember
[1:40:52] what God give up gives us is his word in
[1:40:55] order to overcome whatever statement
[1:40:58] throw in our direction
[1:41:00] hallelujah don't let them take your
[1:41:02] crown don't let them take your crown
[1:41:04] thank you Jesus Luke for we see some
[1:41:07] other temptation happening here in this
[1:41:09] in this particular chapter verse 1 says
[1:41:12] in Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:15] returned from Jordan was led by the
[1:41:17] spirit into the wilderness being forty
[1:41:20] days tempted of the devil
[1:41:22] and in those days he did eat nothing and
[1:41:25] when they were ended he act with hunger
[1:41:28] and the devil said unto him if thou be
[1:41:30] the Son of God command this stone that
[1:41:32] it that it be made bread
[1:41:34] now here's what he's tempted to you know
[1:41:36] turn turning it the stone into into
[1:41:38] bread right it says in jesus answered
[1:41:41] him and saying it is written that man
[1:41:43] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:41:46] every word of God amen and the devil
[1:41:51] taketh him up into a high mountain
[1:41:53] showed them to him all the kingdoms of
[1:41:56] the world in a moment of time now I
[1:41:59] looked at this I was just thinking about
[1:42:02] this what type of leader because
[1:42:05] according to these scriptures
[1:42:07] Satan actually is in control of every
[1:42:09] government according to this scripture
[1:42:11] that I'm reading and my question is what
[1:42:14] type of leader would shut down every
[1:42:17] Kingdom and in the midst of shut down
[1:42:19] every Kingdom try to kill the people
[1:42:21] that he has rulership over what kind of
[1:42:24] leader would do something like that I'll
[1:42:26] tell you what kind of leader the devil
[1:42:29] if you if you if we if a man if we
[1:42:32] didn't know no better my god amen look
[1:42:35] look this look at what Jesus does here
[1:42:38] you know
[1:42:38] the way we're gonna defeat Satan and
[1:42:40] this hours through the Word of God amen
[1:42:42] your feelings and gonna get it your
[1:42:44] emotions ain't gonna get it we gonna
[1:42:46] need the Word of God look at this and
[1:42:47] the devil taking them up into a high
[1:42:50] mountain showed unto him all the kings
[1:42:51] of the world in a moment of time and the
[1:42:54] devil said to him all this power will I
[1:42:56] give thee and the glory of them for that
[1:43:00] for that is delivered unto me and to
[1:43:03] whomsoever I will give it so the devil
[1:43:06] say all this power now he had power he
[1:43:09] had he had the kingdoms he had all this
[1:43:11] and he was willing to give it of Jesus
[1:43:13] now he was trying to give it to him
[1:43:14] without a Calvary glory that God Jesus
[1:43:18] already knew he was gonna get this but
[1:43:19] it was coming after Calvary oh look
[1:43:23] every knee gonna bow every tongue
[1:43:25] confess that Jesus is Lord I mean even
[1:43:29] according to the Book of Daniel there is
[1:43:31] a stone cut out of the mountains that's
[1:43:34] coming and gonna smash all kingdoms amen
[1:43:38] y'all ain't seen nothin come to a halt
[1:43:41] you think Corona brought him to her
[1:43:43] weight to the Lord Jesus comes and takes
[1:43:46] his rightful place glory to God he's
[1:43:49] king of kings and Lord of lords
[1:43:51] look it says and if doubt therefore will
[1:43:54] worship me all shall be done the devil's
[1:43:57] whole purpose all along is to get
[1:44:00] worship that was his was his goal he he
[1:44:03] can't he couldn't stand to see God give
[1:44:05] it at the beginning and now he's trying
[1:44:07] to get where he tried to get worship
[1:44:08] from God himself
[1:44:11] can you imagine that the God that
[1:44:13] created worship here Satan trying to get
[1:44:16] worship from God himself didn't realize
[1:44:18] it was God inside this body hallelujah
[1:44:21] amen he said so it's out there for
[1:44:24] worship me all shall be done and jesus
[1:44:27] answered and said to him get thee behind
[1:44:29] me Satan oh I like that talk to that
[1:44:34] devil get thee behind me Satan for it is
[1:44:37] written thou shalt worship the Lord thy
[1:44:40] God and him only shalt thou serve
[1:44:45] amen kind of reminder what them Hebrew
[1:44:47] boys was doing amen what Dad
[1:44:49] was doing worshiping only his God says
[1:44:51] and he brought him to Jerusalem and set
[1:44:54] him on the pinnacle of the temple and
[1:44:57] said to him if thou be the Son of God
[1:44:59] cast thyself down from hips for it is
[1:45:02] written he shall give his angels charge
[1:45:03] over thee to keep thee not look at the
[1:45:05] devil use the word against Jesus you got
[1:45:09] to know where you stand in the word and
[1:45:10] in their hands they shall bear thee up
[1:45:13] lest at any time thou should that's not
[1:45:15] foot against a stone and jesus answered
[1:45:17] said to him
[1:45:18] it is said thou shalt not tempt the LORD
[1:45:22] thy God and when the devil had ended all
[1:45:25] of the temptation he departed from him
[1:45:28] for seasons I want to tell you this too
[1:45:31] is gonna come to pass and this
[1:45:33] temptation will end at some point in
[1:45:35] time but you know what devil don't have
[1:45:36] another plan to come against us with we
[1:45:39] got to be ready for that but I want to
[1:45:41] tell you in the midst of all this God
[1:45:43] has made you a promise
[1:45:45] I will keep you in the hour of
[1:45:48] temptation and I want to just just just
[1:45:50] break into that just for a little bit a
[1:45:52] man as to what that that hour of
[1:45:55] temptation is what is this that God is
[1:45:57] keeping us from he made he made me a
[1:46:01] promise he made you a promise
[1:46:04] I'm gonna keep you in the hour of
[1:46:06] temptation and this our temptation is
[1:46:08] gonna come upon the whole world not just
[1:46:10] not your city not your country the
[1:46:14] entire world is gonna be tempted to do
[1:46:16] something but he said I'm gonna keep you
[1:46:19] and the hour of your temptation look at
[1:46:23] this we want to go back now oh oh yeah
[1:46:31] let's go back to this is the
[1:46:32] Philadelphia Church age but this is
[1:46:34] coming from the church age book
[1:46:35] paragraph 312 - 3 now this would be a
[1:46:39] pretty long read but I think it would be
[1:46:41] very helpful for us amen brother Branham
[1:46:44] is referring to this the Philadelphia
[1:46:47] Church age is the age right before the
[1:46:49] last was the latest in church age but
[1:46:52] these scriptures that I read a man there
[1:46:54] in Revelation 3:10 revelation I read
[1:46:57] verse 8 through 10 these scriptures also
[1:46:59] going to adversity 11 these scriptures
[1:47:01] were referring to a later time
[1:47:03] it's even referring to the day in which
[1:47:04] we live so I wanted to read that because
[1:47:07] this is the hour of temptation that's
[1:47:09] going to come upon all the world and God
[1:47:10] promised to keep us from something amen
[1:47:13] look at this this verse says revelation
[1:47:15] 3:10 because I was kept the word of my
[1:47:17] patience I also will keep thee from the
[1:47:21] hour of temptation which shall come upon
[1:47:23] all the world to try them that dwell
[1:47:26] upon the earth what does he mean by the
[1:47:29] word of his patience Hebrews 6 verse 13
[1:47:33] through 15 for when God made promise to
[1:47:36] Abraham because he could swear by no
[1:47:38] greater he swear by himself saying
[1:47:40] surely blessing our blessed e
[1:47:43] multiplying I will multiply thee and so
[1:47:46] after yet patiently endured he obtained
[1:47:48] the promise you see the Spirit is
[1:47:51] speaking about the Word of God which is
[1:47:52] given to us to wait for the fulfillment
[1:47:56] of that word require patience even as it
[1:47:59] did in the case of Abraham he endured as
[1:48:02] seeing him who is invisible Amen even
[1:48:06] when I don't see it you work him even
[1:48:09] when I don't feel it you're working you
[1:48:11] never stop working right amen it says he
[1:48:14] was patient and then the word was what's
[1:48:18] the word finally was fulfilled
[1:48:20] some of y'all that are out of work be
[1:48:22] patient
[1:48:23] God made you a promise his promises will
[1:48:26] not fall to the ground a return for amen
[1:48:29] it will be fulfilled
[1:48:30] glory to God look at this he said this
[1:48:32] is the way God teaches its people
[1:48:34] patience why if he fulfilled his word
[1:48:37] and physical manifestations the very
[1:48:40] instant you pray you would never learn
[1:48:42] patience he says but what become even
[1:48:45] more impatient with life let me show you
[1:48:48] this truth even more even more fully set
[1:48:50] forth Hebrews 11 in step 11 17 look by
[1:48:53] faith Abraham when he was tried offered
[1:48:56] up Isaac and he that received the
[1:48:59] promise the Word of God offered up his
[1:49:01] begotten son there it is Abraham was
[1:49:04] tried after he received the word of
[1:49:07] promise laughter we get a
[1:49:08] from God we're gonna be tried on that
[1:49:10] promise as to whether we're gonna hold
[1:49:11] down to it oh we're gonna let go
[1:49:13] hallelujah amen after he received the
[1:49:16] world of promise
[1:49:17] most think that as soon as we pray in
[1:49:19] Jesus's name over the good promise of
[1:49:22] God that there could not be a trial
[1:49:24] hallelujah but here it says that Abraham
[1:49:27] was trying after he received the promise
[1:49:30] that is exactly correct according to the
[1:49:32] psalmist referring to Joseph in Psalm
[1:49:34] 105 19 until the time his work came the
[1:49:38] word of the Lord
[1:49:39] tried him God gives us exceeding great
[1:49:43] and precious promises he has promised to
[1:49:46] fulfill them he will but from the time
[1:49:48] we pray until the time we give the
[1:49:50] answer we must learn to receive patients
[1:49:52] into our souls for only a patience do we
[1:49:56] possess life let me go on he says may
[1:49:59] God help us to learn this lesson even as
[1:50:01] we know the people of the 6:8 learned
[1:50:03] patience we read the history we read the
[1:50:07] history of the lives of these great
[1:50:08] Christians what a contrast we see
[1:50:11] between their lives and ours for they
[1:50:13] were so patient and quiet and today
[1:50:15] we're all but overcoming over impatience
[1:50:17] and haste we want things to happen
[1:50:19] immediately but God don't do things it
[1:50:22] means we got it I was talking with
[1:50:23] somebody just the other day and they
[1:50:25] were saying you know they was going
[1:50:26] through some trials and you know with
[1:50:28] the family and and I say you know you
[1:50:30] you know he's like we know when we gonna
[1:50:32] see this when we're gonna see that I
[1:50:33] mean the scripture say all things work
[1:50:35] together for good but I don't see
[1:50:36] nothing good and this right now I said
[1:50:38] you ain't waited long enough
[1:50:39] you ain't waited long enough I said God
[1:50:41] don't lie if God say all things work
[1:50:44] together for good you know what all
[1:50:47] things will work together for good you
[1:50:49] just say live long enough and waited
[1:50:51] long enough in order to see it but there
[1:50:53] will come a day that you're gonna look
[1:50:55] back on this and you're gonna be
[1:50:57] thanking God for bringing you through it
[1:50:58] amen hallelujah we got to learn patience
[1:51:01] let's go on he goes on to say because
[1:51:03] you have taken my word and lived it and
[1:51:06] thereby become patient I will keep you
[1:51:09] from the hour of temptation which shall
[1:51:12] come upon the world to try them that
[1:51:14] dwell upon the earth now here again we
[1:51:16] see the overlapping of the two ages for
[1:51:19] this promise has to do with the end of
[1:51:21] the Gentile peer
[1:51:22] which culminates in the Great
[1:51:23] Tribulation now notice that scripture
[1:51:25] I'm reading this it's hit him in the
[1:51:29] Philadelphia Church age but brother
[1:51:31] Branham say this this scripture about I
[1:51:33] will keep you in the out of trivial of
[1:51:36] temptation that Scripture was not even
[1:51:39] full of Philadelphia Church age
[1:51:40] believers that scripture was for us
[1:51:42] that's living in Laodicea hallelujah and
[1:51:46] they say that scripture will culminate
[1:51:48] in the Great Tribulation I want to tell
[1:51:51] you we're not in the Great Tribulation
[1:51:52] we're not in the rapture we're not in
[1:51:56] the Millennium right now but we are
[1:51:59] looking for a raptor to come and say
[1:52:01] part of the raptures already happened
[1:52:03] right we know the shout boys in trouble
[1:52:04] part of it is already happen but we're
[1:52:06] looking for the fullness of it to
[1:52:07] complete glory to God and what I can
[1:52:10] tell you that as we are as we're here
[1:52:12] filling some of the pressures God has
[1:52:14] made us a promise and that promise is
[1:52:17] I'm gonna keep you in the hour of
[1:52:20] temptation Oh hallelujah you know what
[1:52:24] that says to me that I don't even have
[1:52:26] to try to keep myself I gotta try to do
[1:52:31] this on my own in my Austria God said to
[1:52:34] me I will keep you in the hour of
[1:52:38] temptation the temptation that's gonna
[1:52:40] come upon the whole world
[1:52:42] I'm gonna keep you oh oh I found shelter
[1:52:46] in his wings let's read this let's read
[1:52:48] what this is all about glory to God a
[1:52:51] man I think God has sent us a prophet in
[1:52:53] the south we don't have to be afraid of
[1:52:55] these things now we understand scripture
[1:52:57] through a prophetic glimpse look at this
[1:53:00] he says now here again we see the
[1:53:02] overlapping of two ages but this promise
[1:53:04] has to do with the end of the Gentile
[1:53:06] period Gentile period which culminates
[1:53:08] in the Great Tribulation now watch this
[1:53:09] I will keep thee from the hour of
[1:53:12] temptation which shall come upon all the
[1:53:15] world to try them that dwell upon the
[1:53:17] earth this verse is not a declaration
[1:53:19] that the true church will go into the in
[1:53:22] in in to and through the tribulation
[1:53:26] that that's not what it means
[1:53:27] this verse does not mean that the church
[1:53:29] is going to go into or through the
[1:53:31] tribulation a man we're not going there
[1:53:34] we're going up church we're going up
[1:53:36] since if it meant that it would have
[1:53:39] said it would have said that but it said
[1:53:42] I will keep thee from the hour of
[1:53:45] temptation this temptation is exactly
[1:53:48] like the temptation in eating
[1:53:51] hallelujah what happened in the eatin
[1:53:53] she was tempted to disobey the Word of
[1:53:56] God God gave her don't eat from that
[1:53:58] tree the day you eat thereof that day
[1:54:00] you die she was tempted to move away
[1:54:01] from that she took reasoning she took
[1:54:05] reasoning rather than the Word of God
[1:54:07] and she fell in the Garden of Eden I
[1:54:09] want to tell you Church don't take
[1:54:11] reasoning today don't choose reason stay
[1:54:14] with the Word of God God is going to
[1:54:15] keep you in the hour of temptation I
[1:54:18] want to share with you what the
[1:54:19] temptation is look at this the Prophet
[1:54:21] tells us it would be a very inviting
[1:54:23] proposition held up in direct opposition
[1:54:28] to God's command at work and yet from
[1:54:31] the standpoint of human reasoning it
[1:54:33] would be so very right so enlightening
[1:54:36] and life-giving as to fool the entire
[1:54:40] world through the world watch this since
[1:54:42] only the very leg will not be fooled the
[1:54:45] temptation will come as follows hear
[1:54:48] this the ecumenical move that has
[1:54:52] started on what seems such a beautiful
[1:54:53] and blessed principle fulfilling Christ
[1:54:55] prayer that we all might be one become
[1:54:58] so strong politically now remember I
[1:55:00] told you I told you that Hebrew boys was
[1:55:04] fighting a political move or a
[1:55:06] government to move Laurie the Hebrew
[1:55:09] boys had to stand against the
[1:55:11] governmental move the the the Daniel had
[1:55:14] to stand against a Enoch that was
[1:55:16] brought in place by the government Oh
[1:55:18] hallelujah when Jesus went to the went
[1:55:21] to the cross it was religious people
[1:55:23] that brought him to the cross oh my and
[1:55:27] you know what the religious people did
[1:55:28] they came into an agreement with the
[1:55:30] government oh we better watch some
[1:55:36] things I was you know they had a threat
[1:55:39] I thank God we were to meet because it
[1:55:42] was it was threatened in New York any
[1:55:44] church that was meeting they would be
[1:55:48] shut down and then actually not allowed
[1:55:51] to meet again even after the virus has
[1:55:54] lit up they would not be allowed to meet
[1:55:55] again I told a brother say now they
[1:55:58] gonna have a hard time executing that
[1:56:00] with a Catholic Church or a Jewish
[1:56:03] synagogue they have a hard time
[1:56:06] executing that
[1:56:08] hallelujah right so so so so for
[1:56:11] somebody like us they could easily do it
[1:56:13] to us but a Catholic Church or Jewish
[1:56:15] synagogue they're gonna have a very
[1:56:16] difficult time doing that now now these
[1:56:19] things what we got to see is that
[1:56:21] everybody's kind of being put on the
[1:56:23] same playing field no matter how big
[1:56:25] your church is how small your church is
[1:56:27] everybody's on the same playing field no
[1:56:29] matter how great your country is how
[1:56:32] poor your country is everybody's shut
[1:56:34] down everybody's on the same playing
[1:56:36] field now it's very easy for certain
[1:56:38] things that actually get activated when
[1:56:40] we're in a mode like this now watch this
[1:56:43] this is what a prophet has told us he's
[1:56:45] giving us the interpretation of this
[1:56:47] scripture look at this the temptation
[1:56:51] will come as follows the ecumenical move
[1:56:55] that has started and they already got
[1:56:57] that they already got a document that
[1:56:59] all of them styling all the different
[1:57:01] religions of the of the earth
[1:57:03] I mean came together just a few years
[1:57:05] ago within the last couple years and
[1:57:07] they signed that they're gonna be
[1:57:09] they're gonna work together
[1:57:11] oh the Catholic Church being at the head
[1:57:14] of it all look at what the prophecy but
[1:57:17] but I'm looking at this because he made
[1:57:19] a promise to me I'm gonna keep you in
[1:57:22] the hour this temptation watch watch
[1:57:25] this and this is something like the
[1:57:26] prophecy this was not that happen in
[1:57:28] John Wesley's Day this scripture was for
[1:57:31] this day but I'm not afraid because I'm
[1:57:35] gonna keep you that's what he told me
[1:57:37] look he says he says only event very
[1:57:42] like would not be fooled the temptation
[1:57:43] would come as follow the ecumenical move
[1:57:45] that has started on what seems such a
[1:57:49] beautiful and blessed principle
[1:57:51] fulfilling Christ's prayer that we all
[1:57:52] might be one become so strong
[1:57:54] politically that she bears pressure upon
[1:57:57] the government to cause all to join with
[1:58:01] her either directly or through adherence
[1:58:05] to principles and acted into law
[1:58:08] principles enacted into law that no
[1:58:12] people will be recognized as actual
[1:58:14] churches and less under direct or
[1:58:17] indirect domination of this council this
[1:58:25] is what's supposed to be coming now we
[1:58:27] can see it's all set up for this church
[1:58:29] hallelujah don't don't miss this don't
[1:58:31] miss it don't miss it don't miss it we
[1:58:34] go to church for a little bit more than
[1:58:36] a shower we go to church for a little
[1:58:39] bit more than a jump we better go to
[1:58:42] church they actually know where we stand
[1:58:44] because as these things are changing and
[1:58:47] and I mean things change fast you wake
[1:58:49] up the next morning and some none change
[1:58:53] hallelujah I think I was saying earlier
[1:58:56] how you know that rest of the pastor I
[1:58:58] don't agree when I'm having autumn
[1:58:59] people in church but they arrested the
[1:59:01] pastor but I'm like at what point in
[1:59:03] time do they they actually go against
[1:59:07] the amendments or the Constitution when
[1:59:11] are they going against that and all in
[1:59:13] the end they sent for Public Safety
[1:59:15] hallelujah amen but you just went
[1:59:18] against constitutional that means
[1:59:20] something don't have to change because
[1:59:21] the church can use the constitutional
[1:59:23] rights hallelujah some don't have to
[1:59:25] change things can be enacted overnight
[1:59:28] the whole world changes glory I want I
[1:59:32] want to just let us know that there will
[1:59:34] I can I expect that there will be some
[1:59:36] changes even after we get on the other
[1:59:38] side of this we can expect it reading
[1:59:40] expected but I'm also expecting God to
[1:59:43] do some great things I want I want to
[1:59:44] just keep reading because the Prophet
[1:59:46] gives us some some information that's
[1:59:48] very very important become so
[1:59:52] politically strong so strong politically
[1:59:55] that she bears pressure upon the
[1:59:56] government to cause all to join with her
[1:59:58] either directly or through adherence to
[2:00:01] principles enacted into law as death so
[2:00:04] that no people will be recognized as
[2:00:06] actual churches unless under direct or
[2:00:08] indirect domination of this council
[2:00:11] little groups will lose
[2:00:14] charters privileges etc until they lose
[2:00:18] all property in spiritual rights with
[2:00:20] the people for example right now unless
[2:00:23] the local Minister association approves
[2:00:25] in many if not most cities one cannot
[2:00:28] rent a building for religious services
[2:00:30] to become chaplains in the armed
[2:00:32] services hospitals etc it is now almost
[2:00:35] mandatory to be recognized as acceptable
[2:00:38] to the trinitarian a communal groups I
[2:00:41] know of a insurance company that will
[2:00:45] not allow me to buy insurance unless I
[2:00:49] actually agree with the Trinitarian
[2:00:51] teachings they wouldn't let me do you
[2:00:55] agree in that with the Father Son and
[2:00:57] Holy Ghost pretty much the three God
[2:00:59] teaching do you agree I said no we don't
[2:01:01] you know I have one brother cup so now I
[2:01:02] don't believe that you know and he took
[2:01:04] him right back to script gesture why he
[2:01:06] and believe it took him back to
[2:01:07] Colossians chapter one and said they say
[2:01:09] oh that's a really good thing that
[2:01:10] you're saying it's a but we believe it
[2:01:13] this way and if you don't believe it
[2:01:14] this way you won't have insurance here
[2:01:17] that's insurance but think about buying
[2:01:20] and selling think about that oh all the
[2:01:25] little mom-and-pop shops run out of
[2:01:27] business but the big ones are still in
[2:01:30] business where the big money's flowing
[2:01:32] hallelujah well you think the Catholic
[2:01:35] Church will want to get any donations
[2:01:36] from mom-and-pop or big ones all right
[2:01:41] who do you think the bigger church is
[2:01:43] gonna want to get they delicious from
[2:01:44] mom and pops or the big ones hallelujah
[2:01:48] glory to God let's watch this profit
[2:01:52] already told us these things he says as
[2:01:54] this pressure increases look at what he
[2:01:57] says and it will it would be harder to
[2:02:01] resist for to resist is to lose
[2:02:05] privilege and so many would be tempted
[2:02:09] to go along for they will feel it is
[2:02:12] better to serve God publicly in the
[2:02:14] framework of this organization then not
[2:02:18] to serve God in all publicly now look at
[2:02:22] what the prophecies but they air
[2:02:25] to believe the devil's lie is to serve
[2:02:29] state see that that same devil that was
[2:02:32] trying to get worship from Jesus
[2:02:34] Almighty God way back in Luke chapter 4
[2:02:38] that same devil is still at work today
[2:02:40] trying to get worship
[2:02:42] hallelujah look at this he says to
[2:02:45] believe the devil's lies are served
[2:02:47] Satan even though you may want to call
[2:02:48] him Jehovah to believe the devil's lie
[2:02:53] is to serve Satan even though you may
[2:02:56] want to call him Jehovah but the elect
[2:03:00] will not be deceived
[2:03:05] let me just read the rest of this
[2:03:07] because this is very important
[2:03:09] furthermore the elect will not only be
[2:03:12] camped but as this mu becomes the image
[2:03:17] erected to the Beast the Saints will be
[2:03:19] going in the rapture
[2:03:20] I say glory their God not only are we
[2:03:24] gonna be kept but church as they move
[2:03:27] this is moving a Manticore this verse
[2:03:30] revelation 13 this is moving and as that
[2:03:32] in as the move becomes the image erected
[2:03:36] to the Beast the Saints will be gone in
[2:03:41] the rapture they used to sing a song and
[2:03:45] he used to get excited about it we're
[2:03:47] going up we're going up we're going up
[2:03:50] in that first resurrection they'll be
[2:03:53] coming from the north
[2:03:54] they'll be coming from the south they're
[2:03:56] be coming from the east they'll be
[2:03:57] coming from the west but we're going up
[2:03:59] we're going up we're going up with the
[2:04:02] Lord Church that's that's that's what my
[2:04:05] heart is that I don't know how much more
[2:04:07] this pressure we gonna be under but as
[2:04:10] they begin to shift these things as laws
[2:04:12] begin to change there is a promise that
[2:04:14] there's a rapture awaiting us that's
[2:04:17] what I'm looking for
[2:04:18] it says the Saints will be going the
[2:04:20] rapture and this little delightful
[2:04:22] wholesome
[2:04:23] I mean winsome movement that started out
[2:04:25] in fellowship at Ephesus will become the
[2:04:27] monster of Satan that defiles and
[2:04:30] deceives the whole world for the church
[2:04:32] system of the Roman
[2:04:33] Catholic and Protestant and coming
[2:04:35] together will control the whole wealth
[2:04:38] of the world system and force the whole
[2:04:41] earth into its religious trap or will
[2:04:47] kill them by refusing them the privilege
[2:04:50] of buying and selling whereby they would
[2:04:52] they would make a living this would be
[2:04:54] accomplished simply Harless daughters
[2:04:57] are all but going back to her
[2:05:00] in the meantime Rome has acquired nearly
[2:05:03] all the supplies of coal the Prophet was
[2:05:05] telling us back in the 60s these things
[2:05:08] Rome has acquired nearly all the
[2:05:11] supplies of gold the Jews have the bonds
[2:05:14] and all the paper and I've just you know
[2:05:17] recently heard that and I don't know how
[2:05:19] true this is because you there's so much
[2:05:21] stuff is floating around there you don't
[2:05:22] know what's right and what's not but
[2:05:24] there was a statement that nobody in
[2:05:26] Israel has contracted the virus nobody
[2:05:33] and that's pretty amazing
[2:05:37] that's pretty amazing but I do know that
[2:05:39] Israel has a part to fulfill in prophecy
[2:05:42] and I know Rome has a part to fulfill in
[2:05:45] prophecy also know the United States has
[2:05:48] a part to fulfill in prophecy so I'm
[2:05:51] looking at all of these things and if a
[2:05:53] virus brings all this together then let
[2:05:57] the will it be done but I know this
[2:05:59] church is going up in a rapture
[2:06:01] look at this at the time the harlot will
[2:06:06] destroy the present-day money system by
[2:06:09] calling in all the paper and demanding
[2:06:12] gold with no gold the systems the system
[2:06:18] false the Jews will be trapped and
[2:06:21] coming to the Alliance and the harlot
[2:06:23] Church will take over the whole world
[2:06:27] but we have a promise that he's gonna
[2:06:31] keep us and the hour of temptation they
[2:06:37] kept the Hebrew boys you kept Daniel you
[2:06:41] kept Jesus because Jesus just kept
[2:06:43] giving the word when he was being
[2:06:44] tempted just kept giving to the devil to
[2:06:46] work he promised to keep us in the alwah
[2:06:49] temptation Church I don't want you to
[2:06:50] fear I want you to know exactly what's
[2:06:53] going on I know what you're getting what
[2:06:54] you can expect from a spiritual
[2:06:55] standpoint don't fear God got this and
[2:06:58] he made us a promise I promised that he
[2:07:01] wrote in the Philadelphia Church age
[2:07:03] that was gonna be for us in this land of
[2:07:05] C&H I'm gonna keep you
[2:07:07] I'm gonna keep you now you know talking
[2:07:11] to young man in the barber shop a few
[2:07:13] weeks ago and saying you know what am I
[2:07:15] gonna do if you know it get down to the
[2:07:17] pork where you know I gotta do something
[2:07:20] or to feed my kids my family what am I
[2:07:21] gonna do you know you know I'm gonna do
[2:07:25] whatever they ask me to do I want to
[2:07:26] feed my kids I said whatever you do
[2:07:28] don't don't don't take the mark don't
[2:07:30] don't do that don't reject the word in
[2:07:31] this out you stay with the word the same
[2:07:34] God that made a way for Daniel the same
[2:07:37] God that made a way for the Hebrew boys
[2:07:38] is the same God that's gonna make a way
[2:07:40] for us and and I all I can do in this
[2:07:42] house just encourage the church you know
[2:07:44] what I say things like this because I
[2:07:46] don't I really don't know when it's
[2:07:48] gonna be our last time coming again I
[2:07:51] really don't know but I want to make
[2:07:54] sure I say something to the church to
[2:07:56] have them ready because we this hour
[2:07:58] that we living in
[2:07:59] nobody's ever lived in it before nobody
[2:08:02] in script has ever been where we are
[2:08:04] right now but by faith God's gonna bring
[2:08:07] us through and we're gonna and all you
[2:08:09] got to do it just remind God always said
[2:08:10] God just said you're gonna keep me you
[2:08:13] say you're gonna keep me when I can't
[2:08:15] keep myself but I'm thinking about
[2:08:18] giving up and giving in and quitting and
[2:08:20] all that you say you're gonna keep me
[2:08:21] remind me of your word quicken to me
[2:08:24] amen and my understanding so I won't
[2:08:26] give up in this out I'll keep you in the
[2:08:30] hour of temptation
[2:08:34] let's pray father we are grateful for
[2:08:40] the word that we can lean upon we can
[2:08:44] trust we can hold to grateful that you
[2:08:50] provided a prophet to us O God that he
[2:08:58] broke the scripture down so we can
[2:09:00] clearly see what to expect in this hour
[2:09:04] Lord it won't take us by surprise that's
[2:09:06] that's why scripture even tells us that
[2:09:09] you know that the day of the Lord will
[2:09:11] be like a thief in the night but you say
[2:09:13] that day will not overtake you as a
[2:09:15] thief because we're not children of the
[2:09:18] night we're children of the day it has
[2:09:20] been revealed to us just as it was
[2:09:23] revealed to Abraham before Sodom was
[2:09:25] destroyed you went down and you begin to
[2:09:27] share secrets with Abraham you told him
[2:09:30] what was going to happen once he got a
[2:09:33] hold of those secrets he began to pray
[2:09:35] and to intercede for others God that's
[2:09:39] where we want to be on our knees in
[2:09:41] prayer and interceding for others the
[2:09:43] hours so late the time is so short God
[2:09:49] we want to be ready we really we that's
[2:09:52] that's that's all that matters now is
[2:09:54] being ready there's anything in our life
[2:09:57] Lord that was that's hindering us Lord
[2:10:01] we pray that you would deal with us
[2:10:02] until we get rid of that thing we
[2:10:04] confess it before your Lord knowing that
[2:10:06] you're faithful and just to forgive I
[2:10:09] pray Lord for those that even Lord
[2:10:12] online and watching maybe they've never
[2:10:14] even heard anything like this so God but
[2:10:17] I pray something would strike them Lord
[2:10:19] people moving from

[2:10:38] stay focused on the word
[2:10:39] that's what matters we don't want to
[2:10:42] miss it in this hour so lord I pray your
[2:10:45] blessings and over your people I pray
[2:10:49] God that you just continue to reveal
[2:10:51] yourself open up our understanding help
[2:10:54] us to see how close we are how real this
[2:10:58] dis is and God how the devil can use it

[2:14:00] remind you will be dismissing here and
[2:14:05] as we go out we're just asking that
[2:14:08] let's not congregate outside our one of
[2:14:14] the things that's been coming as
[2:14:15] churches is that they see large groups
[2:14:18] of people just congregating them and
[2:14:20] they're just concerned so we want to
[2:14:23] just try to avoid that and if you just
[2:14:25] need they really need to talk to
[2:14:26] somebody just please just call them on
[2:14:28] the telephone and and just talk with
[2:14:30] them but again we want to try to adhere
[2:14:33] to most of the things that have been
[2:14:35] requested of us
[2:14:36] we're trying to find a balance in a
[2:14:38] given Caesar what is Caesar's I want
[2:14:41] you're giving God what is God so help us
[2:14:43] to strike that balance and as the as the
[2:14:47] brothers will dismiss they'll just
[2:14:49] dismiss maybe just a few at a time as
[2:14:51] you as they go out and but the others
[2:14:54] just just remain you know patient and
[2:14:57] they'll get you out amen and in due time
