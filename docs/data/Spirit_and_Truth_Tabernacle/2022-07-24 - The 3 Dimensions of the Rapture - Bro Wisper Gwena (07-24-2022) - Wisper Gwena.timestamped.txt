[1:08:28] amen we just love it amen and we thank
[1:08:31] god for it the specials that have been
[1:08:33] sung
[1:08:34] we thank god for every one of them
[1:08:37] and
[1:08:38] what about mishawaka
[1:08:41] [Music]
[1:08:42] for the first time
[1:08:45] in florida
[1:08:47] amen that's how they did it in the days
[1:08:50] of brother branham
[1:08:52] when he went to that place in mishawaka
[1:08:54] amen
[1:08:55] he says they would just pick up some
[1:08:57] preachers and they would come and they
[1:08:59] would just preach from anywhere
[1:09:02] amen that was misha walk
[1:09:05] and remember that is the time when
[1:09:07] brother branham went and there was this
[1:09:09] old man
[1:09:10] that came and he was just called up and
[1:09:13] he was called up brother branham said
[1:09:15] you know i felt sorry for this man and i
[1:09:17] said how can they call such an old man
[1:09:20] and he came up there a man the prophet
[1:09:23] says he had a velvet caller with a
[1:09:25] cortender round and brother branham says
[1:09:27] he was just feeling sorry for him and
[1:09:30] when he took to the pulpit he says he
[1:09:32] took his scripture
[1:09:34] out of the book of job
[1:09:36] where were you
[1:09:38] when i laid the foundations of the world
[1:09:41] when the sons of god shouted for joy and
[1:09:44] brother branham says he never spoke
[1:09:46] anything about this world every other
[1:09:48] preacher was talking about what jesus
[1:09:51] had done but this old man he started
[1:09:54] from way back tens of thousands of years
[1:09:58] before the beginning of the world
[1:10:00] and he said he took him amen and he
[1:10:03] brought him down the horizontal rainbow
[1:10:06] and when he brought him down the
[1:10:07] horizontal rainbow then at a certain
[1:10:10] point he clicked his heels and he
[1:10:12] shouted whoopi
[1:10:14] and he says there is ain't not enough
[1:10:16] room for me to preach
[1:10:18] and he went and he sat down that was
[1:10:20] misawaka
[1:10:23] glory
[1:10:25] amen
[1:10:27] praise god in the eyes
[1:10:31] amen and what about this morning the
[1:10:34] testimony of our brother
[1:10:38] amen
[1:10:45] we know our brother
[1:10:47] we've been with him for many many years
[1:10:51] but after that experience something
[1:10:53] changed in his life
[1:10:55] and we are all a witness of it you can't
[1:10:57] be the same after something like that
[1:10:59] happens to you
[1:11:01] something has to change
[1:11:04] and i trust that you were blessed with
[1:11:06] the testimony
[1:11:09] but what it shows us saints
[1:11:13] what it shows the saints is that
[1:11:16] this gospel is a reality
[1:11:20] these things that we are taught are a
[1:11:23] reality
[1:11:25] there is a heaven to go to
[1:11:28] and there is a hell to run away from
[1:11:32] whatever you do
[1:11:33] don't miss that place
[1:11:36] and that is why we are here
[1:11:40] it is because that has been revealed to
[1:11:42] us
[1:11:43] and when something like that happens to
[1:11:45] somebody that you know
[1:11:47] you can indeed testify and say
[1:11:51] this has touched my heart
[1:11:54] because it means so much to me as well
[1:11:58] we appreciate that testimony
[1:12:01] now coming to the last service i was
[1:12:04] just wondering so what am i going to
[1:12:06] bring to the church amen normally many
[1:12:09] times when i come to preach i've
[1:12:11] preached quite a lot of last services on
[1:12:13] many meetings and most of the time it's
[1:12:16] it's really just evangelical
[1:12:18] and we just approach the gospel from
[1:12:21] that perspective
[1:12:23] but tonight
[1:12:25] god has laid it on my heart to look at
[1:12:27] it
[1:12:28] a little differently
[1:12:32] and
[1:12:32] this is really coming from
[1:12:35] the testimony of the morning
[1:12:38] and the lord has just laid it upon my
[1:12:40] heart that we can just approach the
[1:12:42] message from
[1:12:45] a different perspective maybe looking at
[1:12:47] something that complements what went in
[1:12:50] the morning
[1:12:51] so my sermon tonight amen god giving us
[1:12:54] grace i'll be looking at things that are
[1:12:57] to be
[1:12:58] i'll be looking at where we are going to
[1:13:01] be
[1:13:02] i'll be looking at the rapture of the
[1:13:04] bride
[1:13:06] amen that's what i want to speak about
[1:13:09] and i trust that that is going to be a
[1:13:11] blessing to somebody
[1:13:13] a little teaching type of a message amen
[1:13:17] but i'm not that much of a teacher
[1:13:20] i don't have teaching manners
[1:13:25] amen
[1:13:27] shall we stand to our feet
[1:13:33] praise god
[1:13:38] how many love the word
[1:13:41] are you tired
[1:13:44] wonderful
[1:13:47] in the book of acts chapter 1
[1:13:52] the bible says
[1:13:54] and when he had spoken
[1:13:56] these things
[1:13:58] while they beheld he was taken up
[1:14:01] and a cloud received him out of their
[1:14:04] sight
[1:14:05] and while they looked steadfastly toward
[1:14:07] heaven as he went up behold two men
[1:14:10] stood by them in white apparel
[1:14:13] which also said ye man of galilee why
[1:14:16] stand the gazing up into heaven
[1:14:19] the same jesus which is taken up from
[1:14:22] you into heaven shall so come in like
[1:14:25] manna as you have seen him go
[1:14:28] into heaven
[1:14:32] first thessalonians chapter 4
[1:14:36] verse 16 and 17
[1:14:39] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:14:42] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[1:14:44] the archangel and with the trump of god
[1:14:46] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:14:49] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:14:52] be caught up together with them in the
[1:14:53] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[1:14:56] so shall we ever be
[1:14:59] with the lord
[1:15:01] and then first corinthians chapter 15
[1:15:05] 51 and 52 behold i show you a mystery we
[1:15:09] shall not all sleep
[1:15:11] but we shall all be changed
[1:15:13] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:15:16] at the last trump for the trumpet shall
[1:15:18] sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:15:21] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:15:27] we may be seated
[1:15:32] as we bow our heads yet again father we
[1:15:34] thank you for the reading of your word
[1:15:38] we come yet again lord father to this
[1:15:41] scary part
[1:15:43] that no human being can handle
[1:15:46] how can we handle you because the word
[1:15:49] we learn is
[1:15:50] you it takes you and you alone
[1:15:54] therefore father lord god almighty we
[1:15:57] commit the ministration of the word back
[1:15:59] to you
[1:16:00] and we ask you father that you can have
[1:16:03] your own way
[1:16:05] lord we are only your children unable
[1:16:08] feeble lord but thou art strong thou are
[1:16:10] able and father lord god almighty we
[1:16:13] therefore come to you the able one and
[1:16:15] we say in the name of the lord jesus
[1:16:17] christ father please do what you do best
[1:16:20] which is to show us your ways
[1:16:22] father you said your ways are not our
[1:16:24] ways
[1:16:25] but lord we desire to leave our ways to
[1:16:28] come into your ways
[1:16:30] speak to our hearts tonight in jesus
[1:16:33] christ's name amen
[1:16:36] praise the lord
[1:16:38] for a title tonight
[1:16:40] i want to speak on
[1:16:42] the three dimensions of the rapture
[1:16:45] [Music]
[1:16:47] that's rather a very strange title
[1:16:51] and maybe let me also say maybe a
[1:16:53] confusing title
[1:16:56] but i trust that it will make sense by
[1:16:58] the time we come to the end of the
[1:17:00] service now let me say when i say three
[1:17:05] dimensions of the rapture i'm not
[1:17:07] talking about the dimensions in the
[1:17:09] realm of the dimensions as in the
[1:17:11] seventh dimensions that the prophet
[1:17:13] teaches us of
[1:17:14] i'm talking about the dimensions here as
[1:17:18] in realms as in stages but each being a
[1:17:21] different perspective a different
[1:17:23] dimension
[1:17:25] now what is the dimension a dimension is
[1:17:28] the way you see things it is the outlook
[1:17:31] at your given vantage point
[1:17:34] that's the definition of a dimension it
[1:17:36] is the way you look given the vantage
[1:17:39] point that you'll be in
[1:17:43] three dimensions
[1:17:45] is because we are in these three
[1:17:47] dimensions
[1:17:48] and we are limited to these three
[1:17:50] dimensions that's how we see things
[1:17:54] seventh dimension amen it is the highest
[1:17:57] and it sees everything the prophet says
[1:17:59] these are separated by speed
[1:18:03] but i'm not talking about that i'm just
[1:18:05] talking about the way that you look at
[1:18:08] things in different stages
[1:18:11] amen
[1:18:12] now let me also start by telling you how
[1:18:15] this inspiration came to me
[1:18:18] i have a good friend of mine a pastor
[1:18:21] friend his name is brother lincoln he's
[1:18:23] in charlotte
[1:18:25] and we we exchanged so much in terms of
[1:18:29] doctrine he's a man that just loves to
[1:18:32] study the word and he's always firing
[1:18:34] questions at me and you know asking what
[1:18:36] about this and what about that and over
[1:18:39] the years we have
[1:18:40] dealt with so many different aspects of
[1:18:43] the message
[1:18:45] so
[1:18:46] one day he sends me a question
[1:18:49] and this is how this message came about
[1:18:53] by god's grace i want to talk about
[1:18:56] the three dimensions of the rapture
[1:19:01] as i said it sounds a bit strange
[1:19:06] but i trust that you get where i'm
[1:19:08] coming from
[1:19:10] now
[1:19:10] let me just start by saying
[1:19:13] the rapture is the greatest expectation
[1:19:17] that the bride has in this hour
[1:19:20] how many agree with me
[1:19:24] it is the highlight of this age
[1:19:27] it is what sets this edge apart
[1:19:30] this is the only age in which there is
[1:19:33] going to be a rapture
[1:19:36] to think about it sayings that there is
[1:19:38] gonna be a people that shall exit this
[1:19:41] earth not by the way of death
[1:19:44] but in a moment in the twinkling of an
[1:19:46] eye we shall be
[1:19:48] changed oh what a promise that is
[1:19:52] and what an expectation that ought to
[1:19:54] give to the believers in this day and in
[1:19:56] this hour
[1:19:58] and the reason why i'm in the message it
[1:20:01] is because the message gives me the
[1:20:03] greatest preparation for that rapture
[1:20:06] coming
[1:20:07] i'm in the message because the rapture
[1:20:10] promise is in the message
[1:20:13] my prophet tells me oh
[1:20:16] that we need for the rapture it lies in
[1:20:18] them tips and in them books
[1:20:23] oh that we need to be prepared for the
[1:20:26] rapture a preparatory message stored up
[1:20:29] food with rupturing vitamins
[1:20:33] it lies in them tips and books
[1:20:37] allow me to just remove my jacket
[1:20:42] praise the lord
[1:20:48] amen
[1:20:50] hallelujah
[1:20:53] and let me say right here saints that
[1:20:55] when we talk about the rapture the
[1:20:57] rapture is not just for the living
[1:21:02] but the rapture is also for those that
[1:21:04] are asleep in christ
[1:21:08] is that right
[1:21:10] in fact those that are asleep amen they
[1:21:13] take priority
[1:21:16] somebody came to brother branham and he
[1:21:18] said you know i'm so worried about the
[1:21:20] rapture brother branham i want so much
[1:21:23] to be in the rapture but i don't know
[1:21:25] whether i'll be alive at the time of the
[1:21:27] rapture and brother branham being the
[1:21:29] sober prophet that he is he tend to this
[1:21:32] person and he says hey don't worry about
[1:21:34] whether you are alive or you are gone
[1:21:37] because the rapture is not just for the
[1:21:40] living
[1:21:42] even if you are gone the rapture is
[1:21:45] gonna be for you as well
[1:21:47] so i'm not talking about something that
[1:21:50] will be just for those that will be our
[1:21:52] life i'm talking about something for
[1:21:54] everyone that has been in christ
[1:22:00] praise god in the eyes
[1:22:04] now
[1:22:06] let me get to first thessalonians
[1:22:08] chapter four
[1:22:09] now many times when we speak of
[1:22:12] thessalonians chapter four our focus
[1:22:14] most of the time it is actually on verse
[1:22:16] number 16
[1:22:18] which is the scripture that talks about
[1:22:21] the rapture the rapture process in that
[1:22:23] scripture is described by the shout the
[1:22:26] voice of the archangel and the trump of
[1:22:28] god take me to the next one
[1:22:31] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:22:33] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[1:22:35] the archangel and with the trump of god
[1:22:38] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:22:44] so right there we find the rapture
[1:22:46] process
[1:22:48] and many times when we look at the
[1:22:49] scripture we are looking at it amen from
[1:22:52] the perspective of verse number 16
[1:23:00] and little
[1:23:01] do we ever put emphasis
[1:23:04] on verse number 17
[1:23:07] and the reason for your church is this
[1:23:10] vest number 16
[1:23:12] is very fundamental to the message
[1:23:15] why because the scripture in verse
[1:23:17] number 16 amen we find the seventh seal
[1:23:20] in there
[1:23:23] the seventh seal is the coming of the
[1:23:25] lord is that right
[1:23:28] and first thessalonians chapter 4 16 is
[1:23:31] the coming of the lord is that right now
[1:23:34] if the servant see you is the coming of
[1:23:35] the lord and first thessalonians 4 16 is
[1:23:38] the coming of the lord then it follows
[1:23:40] that we must be able to place the
[1:23:42] seventh seal into first thessalonians 4.
[1:23:47] oh place first thessalonians 4 into the
[1:23:50] seventh seal
[1:23:53] but i'm not talking about that tonight
[1:23:56] amen
[1:23:58] hallelujah
[1:24:00] but because of those things amen we
[1:24:03] always find a great attraction to speak
[1:24:06] on verse number 16 and hardly do we ever
[1:24:08] look at verse number 17
[1:24:12] and many of the times when we look amen
[1:24:14] we read the scriptures coming to verse
[1:24:16] 17 we just read it in passing
[1:24:19] but today by god's grace we want to
[1:24:22] focus on verse number 17
[1:24:26] the prophet comments about this
[1:24:28] scripture
[1:24:30] and the prophet in commenting about this
[1:24:32] scripture he says in the messenger of
[1:24:34] ajiri and then remember if we go before
[1:24:38] he comes we will be up and in his
[1:24:40] presence or raised before the others are
[1:24:43] changed the trumpet of the lord shall
[1:24:46] sound the dead in christ shall rise
[1:24:49] first then we which are alive and remain
[1:24:52] shall be changed in a moment in the
[1:24:55] twinkling of an eye and be caught up
[1:24:57] together with them to meet the lord in
[1:25:00] the air
[1:25:02] now the prophet in that statement he's
[1:25:04] mixing first thessalonians chapter 4 and
[1:25:06] he's also bringing in the element of
[1:25:08] first corinthians chapter 15 which is
[1:25:11] the other scripture that i read
[1:25:13] but it's all talking of the same thing
[1:25:16] but then watch the prophet then says
[1:25:18] look at the order of the resurrection
[1:25:23] in other words in there we see the order
[1:25:27] of the resurrection
[1:25:29] he goes on and he says so god knows that
[1:25:33] we long to see our loved ones and if we
[1:25:36] go there to meet him first we'll be
[1:25:38] looking around to see if mother or dead
[1:25:40] and the rest of them was there but see
[1:25:43] how the holy spirit in his wisdom we
[1:25:46] meet one another first
[1:25:49] [Applause]
[1:25:52] and then when we get there and sing
[1:25:55] amazing grace that's when they are going
[1:25:57] to be a time of worship
[1:26:00] you think i act funny now watch me up
[1:26:03] there
[1:26:04] it's going to be a wonderful time for me
[1:26:06] and all of us when we get there
[1:26:09] [Applause]
[1:26:11] but the prophet says look at the order
[1:26:14] of it
[1:26:16] see the holy spirit in his wisdom
[1:26:21] we meet one another first
[1:26:27] that's the order of the resurrection
[1:26:31] now that looks simple
[1:26:34] and that looks like we all understand it
[1:26:37] is that right
[1:26:39] but when you begin to look at that a
[1:26:41] little deeper
[1:26:43] then you begin to realize it's deeper
[1:26:45] than you thought
[1:26:48] and this is where this brother's
[1:26:50] question was and he asked me so what
[1:26:52] exactly then is the order of the rapture
[1:26:55] if we meet one another first
[1:27:00] now we know
[1:27:02] that there's gonna be that period of
[1:27:04] about 40 days
[1:27:06] in which the dead shall rise first
[1:27:09] amen and they will appear unto us but in
[1:27:12] this this is not the meeting of one
[1:27:14] another that the prophet is talking
[1:27:16] about
[1:27:18] why do i say that this is not the
[1:27:20] meaning of one another that the prophet
[1:27:22] is talking about because he says in this
[1:27:24] message i said well it says in ii
[1:27:28] thessalonians the fifth chapter and we
[1:27:30] know he actually means first
[1:27:31] thessalonians the fourth chapter
[1:27:35] and the prophet says in another place
[1:27:37] and make them type of mistakes so many
[1:27:40] times
[1:27:42] amen that's a direct court
[1:27:46] and if you're gonna hold the prophet to
[1:27:48] say that he said ii thessalonians
[1:27:51] chapter five when he met first
[1:27:52] thessalonians chapter four therefore i
[1:27:55] will take it to the second thessalonians
[1:27:57] chapter five it means you just don't
[1:27:59] understand
[1:28:00] [Applause]
[1:28:06] glory to god
[1:28:09] so he said
[1:28:11] it said we which are alive and remain
[1:28:14] unto the coming of the lord shall not
[1:28:16] prevent that means hinder those that are
[1:28:19] resting asleep for the trumpet of god
[1:28:22] shall sound and those who are asleep or
[1:28:24] resting shall wake up first to take on
[1:28:28] immortality
[1:28:30] then we wish our life at that day at
[1:28:33] that time after they have done raised up
[1:28:37] then we shall be changed in a moment a
[1:28:40] twinkling of an eye and meet with them
[1:28:44] now i want you to follow saints he says
[1:28:47] then we which are alive at that day that
[1:28:50] time after they have done raised up so
[1:28:53] those have risen up
[1:28:55] and then the next thing that happens
[1:28:57] then we shall be changed
[1:29:00] then we are also changed
[1:29:02] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:29:05] and we meet with them
[1:29:07] in other words that meeting it is coming
[1:29:10] after our body change
[1:29:15] then we go to meet the lord in the air
[1:29:17] be caught up together with them
[1:29:21] so this is not a meeting that is
[1:29:23] happening before the body change
[1:29:26] [Music]
[1:29:27] glory
[1:29:28] so the question is getting deeper so
[1:29:30] what then is the exact order of the
[1:29:33] rapture preacher man
[1:29:36] and by god's grace i want to look at
[1:29:38] that
[1:29:39] now god in his wisdom and in his grace
[1:29:42] he played this out for us and he gave us
[1:29:45] a clue of what this is all about
[1:29:48] we find that now in the book of acts
[1:29:51] 9 of chapter 1 starting from verse 9.
[1:29:54] the bible says and when he had spoken
[1:29:57] these things while they beheld he was
[1:29:59] taken up and the cloud received him out
[1:30:03] of their sight
[1:30:05] and while they looked steadfastly toward
[1:30:07] heaven as he went up behold two men
[1:30:09] stood by them in white apparel which
[1:30:12] also said he men of galilee wise and he
[1:30:15] gazing up into heaven the same jesus
[1:30:18] which is taken up from you into heaven
[1:30:21] shall so come in like manna
[1:30:24] as you have seen him go into heaven
[1:30:28] right here the bible gives us a clue on
[1:30:31] the order of his second coming
[1:30:35] and where is that clue preacher man he
[1:30:37] says he shall so come in like manna
[1:30:42] in other words what he has done here he
[1:30:45] shall repeat
[1:30:49] why jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:30:53] today and forever
[1:30:55] malachi 3 6 i am the lord and i change
[1:30:59] not
[1:31:01] so if god has done something he will be
[1:31:04] obligated to do it again
[1:31:08] and the prophet of god says god is
[1:31:11] infinite he cannot change
[1:31:14] man changes times changes kingdoms
[1:31:18] changes worlds changes churches changes
[1:31:21] but christ remains the same yesterday
[1:31:24] today and forever and can never change
[1:31:27] he's just like he was at the beginning
[1:31:32] so the unchanging god hallelujah working
[1:31:35] in an unchangeable way at the time
[1:31:38] hallelujah of his coming he's going to
[1:31:40] repeat what he has done amen and x tells
[1:31:44] us in like manner
[1:31:49] he shall return
[1:31:51] but i want to say looking at that like
[1:31:54] manner that like men are amen the way he
[1:31:58] went it did not start in acts chapter
[1:32:00] one
[1:32:02] it actually starts from matthew chapter
[1:32:05] 27
[1:32:07] because in matthew 27 we then read
[1:32:11] and behold the veil of the temple was
[1:32:13] random twain from the top to the bottom
[1:32:16] and the earth did quirk and the rocks
[1:32:19] ran and the graves were opened and many
[1:32:21] bodies of the saints which slept arose
[1:32:26] came out of the graves after his
[1:32:28] resurrection and went into the holy city
[1:32:30] and appeared unto many
[1:32:33] now this was the order of his first
[1:32:36] ascension
[1:32:38] what happened at that time
[1:32:40] amen the grace opened and the saints of
[1:32:43] old that slept they arose amen after
[1:32:47] that he had resurrected and they went
[1:32:50] into the city and they appeared unto
[1:32:52] many
[1:32:54] now in like manner
[1:32:56] he shall return
[1:32:59] so in like manna what shall happen it is
[1:33:02] coming the dirt shall rise first
[1:33:05] hallelujah
[1:33:07] and paul picks that up and he says in
[1:33:09] thessalonians the dirt shall rise first
[1:33:15] because it's got to be in like manner as
[1:33:17] it was in matthew chapter 27 that's
[1:33:20] exactly the same way that it will repeat
[1:33:23] again
[1:33:25] now for how long are these going to
[1:33:27] appear the bible tells me in the book of
[1:33:30] acts to whom also he showed himself
[1:33:33] alive after his passion by many
[1:33:35] infallible proofs being seen of them 40
[1:33:38] days
[1:33:40] and speaking of the things pertaining to
[1:33:42] the kingdom of god
[1:33:44] so we know at the time amen when christ
[1:33:47] resurrected he was showing himself to
[1:33:50] his disciples for a period of 40 days
[1:33:55] and in that period of 40 days something
[1:33:57] else was happening
[1:34:00] the likes of abraham and sarah were
[1:34:03] taking a stroll in the streets of
[1:34:05] jerusalem
[1:34:08] not only was it abraham and sarah but
[1:34:10] the prophets of ode the likes of ezekiel
[1:34:13] isaiah elijah jeremiah amen you name the
[1:34:18] saints of old they were also walking in
[1:34:20] the streets of jerusalem appearing and
[1:34:23] disappearing in the same period
[1:34:27] and the prophet dramatizes this and he
[1:34:30] says i can see abraham
[1:34:32] grabbed sarah by the arm and here they
[1:34:34] come right out in matthew 27 when he
[1:34:37] came out i can hear them make a little
[1:34:40] stop around jerusalem there and the
[1:34:42] first thing you know i can see caiaphas
[1:34:44] and them standing on the streets saying
[1:34:46] they tell me that guy rules
[1:34:49] say
[1:34:51] who is that guy going there
[1:34:54] that young fellow and that young girl
[1:34:57] not old no more that was abraham and
[1:35:01] sarah
[1:35:03] and they vanished
[1:35:06] they looked somebody's watching us they
[1:35:08] could vanish just like he went through
[1:35:11] the wall the same kind of body
[1:35:14] hallelujah right
[1:35:18] so abraham and sarah young now amen
[1:35:22] walking in the streets of jerusalem here
[1:35:24] requested lord can i just take a stroll
[1:35:28] through that city because i said i'm a
[1:35:31] pilgrim and i'm a stranger i'm looking
[1:35:33] for a city whose builder and maker is
[1:35:36] god and god granted father abraham the
[1:35:39] ability and the time to walk through the
[1:35:42] streets of jerusalem
[1:35:45] amen
[1:35:47] as the foretest of that real city
[1:35:50] that he was looking for
[1:35:52] and the prophet says he is all the
[1:35:55] prophets and them walking around
[1:35:57] looking around the city so it wasn't
[1:35:59] just for the abraham it was all the
[1:36:02] prophets
[1:36:05] they arose at the same time with the
[1:36:07] lord jesus christ and they appeared unto
[1:36:09] many for a period of about 40 days
[1:36:14] so the order of the resurrection is
[1:36:16] going to be the dead will rise first
[1:36:20] then they appear to us for a period of
[1:36:23] about 40 days is that right
[1:36:26] because in like manner
[1:36:30] he shall return
[1:36:33] amen
[1:36:34] so i believe according to the teaching
[1:36:37] of the prophet and according to the
[1:36:39] teaching of the bible that when that
[1:36:41] hour comes amen those saints that have
[1:36:44] gone on to be with the lord they will
[1:36:46] rise first
[1:36:49] and i believe the reason why god allows
[1:36:52] them to rise first is because god has
[1:36:55] ordained them to become the final
[1:36:57] preachers to bring the final message
[1:37:00] with a rapturing faith
[1:37:06] how do you mean it preacher man
[1:37:09] hallelujah
[1:37:10] they are not coming i believe to preach
[1:37:13] a ceremony as i'm preaching a seminar i
[1:37:15] believe like they are appearing it is a
[1:37:18] ceremony in his own right
[1:37:21] because to us who are taught to ask that
[1:37:24] no praise be to god brother when you see
[1:37:27] them appearing you can almost tell in 40
[1:37:30] days from now in less than 40 days i'm
[1:37:34] gonna get my own body change
[1:37:39] i don't need anyone to preach to me
[1:37:42] just seeing a saint that has gone on to
[1:37:45] be with the lord think about it saints
[1:37:47] we are sitting in church as we are
[1:37:49] sitting now and then on your side you
[1:37:52] look and you see say hey
[1:37:54] who is this
[1:37:56] and then you begin to realize actually
[1:37:58] it's brother so-and-so who went to be
[1:38:01] with the lord some 20 years ago
[1:38:04] and the moment you recognize it then it
[1:38:06] disappears through the wall
[1:38:10] brother think about it
[1:38:13] what that would do to your gastronomics
[1:38:16] your spiritual gastronomics it will blow
[1:38:19] out every fuse hallelujah inside of your
[1:38:22] fibers it will pump you with a true
[1:38:25] rupturing faith brother i say to the
[1:38:28] church one day that on that day when i
[1:38:31] see a sudden brother sitting in the
[1:38:33] church and i recognize him i said on
[1:38:36] that day if you want my car you can take
[1:38:38] it
[1:38:42] because i won't be going home with it
[1:38:45] and it's not that we'll be going into
[1:38:46] the rapture
[1:38:47] i will still be going home but i will
[1:38:50] not go home in my car because by that
[1:38:52] time i'll have such a faith that i walk
[1:38:56] home
[1:38:57] like the speed of a thought
[1:38:59] just like philip
[1:39:02] my faith will be boosted
[1:39:05] oh glory to god at that time all things
[1:39:10] will become possible
[1:39:15] not that they are not now
[1:39:18] all things are possible now but our
[1:39:21] faith has not climbed to that level but
[1:39:23] rather when that begins to happen
[1:39:31] glory to god in the highest
[1:39:34] amen
[1:39:36] what a faith boost that would be
[1:39:39] and god has allocated
[1:39:41] 40 days
[1:39:45] according to the like-manner pattern
[1:39:48] to give us the rupturing boosting faith
[1:39:52] and god achieves that
[1:39:54] in 40 days
[1:39:57] and god knows praise be to god that in
[1:40:00] 40 days i'm more than able
[1:40:03] to even convert that message believer
[1:40:06] that does not have faith
[1:40:10] 40 days is enough
[1:40:12] oh and i love this 40 days
[1:40:15] it is enough for god amen to give a
[1:40:18] person a rapturing faith that in 40 days
[1:40:21] amen witnessing that things can change
[1:40:27] oh i can tell you right now saints of
[1:40:29] the living god that 40 days is enough
[1:40:32] for you to see a visible change
[1:40:35] even in your own circumstances

[1:40:39] might be wondering what am i gonna get

[1:41:01] like today
[1:41:03] and she will not know about it
[1:41:05] but give you 40 days
[1:41:07] within 40 days

[1:41:12] will begin to change there will be some
[1:41:14] morning sicknesses here and there there
[1:41:16] will be this and that beginning to
[1:41:18] happen that begins to tell you that what
[1:41:21] happened without you not knowing it this

[1:42:00] ministration of the word that when the
[1:42:02] word is spoken the word hallelujah is
[1:42:06] god's thoughts for our day
[1:42:09] oh i believe saints of the living god
[1:42:12] that 40 days is enough for anything
[1:42:15] and god knows about it
[1:42:17] when he sent jonah to nineveh jonah was
[1:42:20] sent with the message yet 40 days
[1:42:23] why just 40 days god knew that in 40
[1:42:27] days he could convert a serious city
[1:42:30] that was destined to the peace of
[1:42:32] perdition hallelujah they could end up
[1:42:35] believing
[1:42:38] and jonah got there and he started
[1:42:40] preaching yet 40 days
[1:42:42] and within that period ninifa believed
[1:42:46] and when nineveh believed god spared
[1:42:48] nineveh let me tell you tonight if you
[1:42:51] believe god is gonna spare your life if
[1:42:54] you believe god is gonna grant to you

[1:43:03] there's gonna be hallelujah something
[1:43:06] takes place in your own home who says
[1:43:09] yes i believe

[1:43:13] or start counting tonight yet 40 days
[1:43:17] brother sister and a visible change a
[1:43:20] visible transformation or i don't know

[1:43:24] i don't know who he's saying you are
[1:43:26] talking to me i've been waiting for this
[1:43:28] thing for a little while i'm here to
[1:43:31] announce it is just about to happen
[1:43:36] glory to god

[1:43:43] praise god in the highest
[1:43:46] hallelujah hallelujah

[1:44:00] watch me
[1:44:01] hallelujah my manifestation will begin
[1:44:05] to show yes yes somebody believe a
[1:44:08] belief
[1:44:09] [Applause]
[1:44:15] let me come back to my subjects
[1:44:19] [Applause]
[1:44:23] these that rules
[1:44:26] in matthew 27
[1:44:29] they appeared unto many
[1:44:31] for 40 days
[1:44:33] but i want you to watch things
[1:44:35] they were not appearing
[1:44:37] to those whose bodies had been changed
[1:44:44] and in like manner
[1:44:46] he shall return
[1:44:49] so in other words in these 40 days we
[1:44:52] have not yet had a body change
[1:44:58] are you with me
[1:45:01] and the prophet of god says then we
[1:45:04] which are alive at that day at that time
[1:45:06] after they have done raised up see then
[1:45:09] we shall be changed in a moment in the
[1:45:11] twinkling of an eye and meet with them
[1:45:17] so they are raised first
[1:45:19] they appear for 40 days
[1:45:21] and then in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:45:23] an eye we shall be changed
[1:45:26] to go meet with them
[1:45:28] and then go up to meet the lord in the
[1:45:30] air be caught up together with them
[1:45:36] a different type of a meeting
[1:45:39] he says here but that won't hurt the
[1:45:41] rapture now see no they come first then
[1:45:45] them a privilege that's gone on they
[1:45:47] come first
[1:45:49] see see we which are alive and remain to
[1:45:53] the coming of the lord will not hinder
[1:45:55] or prevent those that are asleep the
[1:45:57] trumpet of god shall sound the dead in
[1:46:00] christ shall rise first
[1:46:03] then when our eyes behold our loved ones
[1:46:06] then we will be changed
[1:46:09] glory
[1:46:10] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:46:13] and with them shall be caught up
[1:46:15] together
[1:46:19] our eyes behold them
[1:46:21] and when our eyes behold them it gives
[1:46:24] us a rapturing faith and when it gives
[1:46:26] us a rapture in faith then we shall be
[1:46:29] changed
[1:46:31] and then after we are changed then we
[1:46:33] shall be caught up together with them
[1:46:38] the ones that goes first are privileged
[1:46:41] above those that are leaving
[1:46:44] so the body change happens first before
[1:46:46] we go to the meeting
[1:46:50] days they are appearing
[1:46:53] which gives us the faith to have the
[1:46:55] body change but after that when we have
[1:46:57] had a body change then there is a
[1:46:59] meeting
[1:47:02] are you following me saying
[1:47:05] he says
[1:47:07] we don't meet him first
[1:47:10] we meet one another first
[1:47:15] the order of the resurrection
[1:47:18] the bible said ephesians the fifth
[1:47:20] chapter we know he says he means
[1:47:22] first thessalonians 4.
[1:47:30] glory to god
[1:47:32] it said for we which are alive and
[1:47:35] remain unto the coming of the lord down
[1:47:37] here shall not prevent or hinder those
[1:47:39] which are asleep them precious ones that
[1:47:42] seal their blood sealed their testimony
[1:47:45] with their blood not prevent or hinder
[1:47:48] those that are asleep for the trumpet
[1:47:50] shall sound
[1:47:52] something will take place
[1:47:54] the gospel something will sound the
[1:47:57] announcing of his coming and the dead in
[1:47:59] christ shall rise first and we which are
[1:48:02] alive
[1:48:03] remains shall be changed
[1:48:05] then the prophet says standing in philly
[1:48:09] change come on you the gray hair go out
[1:48:12] the wrinkles fall away be changed in a
[1:48:15] moment in the twinkling of an eye oh
[1:48:18] church of the living god
[1:48:22] what an expectation this is
[1:48:25] that when you are sitting there when you
[1:48:27] are standing there then you start to
[1:48:29] feel a change come inside of you and the
[1:48:32] gray hairs disappearing the wrinkles
[1:48:34] disappearing you changing to a young man
[1:48:37] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:48:40] what an expectation that is
[1:48:44] oh church of the living god
[1:48:46] that ought to incentivize everybody to
[1:48:48] live a christian life to say whatever i
[1:48:51] do i can't miss that opportunity
[1:48:55] to be able to be a part of it to be able
[1:48:57] to witness a body change that is coming
[1:49:00] into my fibers
[1:49:06] but watch he carries on and he says and
[1:49:08] we shall meet our loved ones first
[1:49:13] today's mama
[1:49:14] there is papa there is my body oh
[1:49:17] hallelujah we are ready and then
[1:49:20] together with them that were dead says
[1:49:23] the scripture we will be caught up in
[1:49:25] the air to meet the lord the order of
[1:49:28] the coming
[1:49:32] look at the older sayings there is a
[1:49:34] change of body and after there is a
[1:49:36] change of body then we go to meet one
[1:49:39] another we meet one another first
[1:49:44] and we shall meet our loved ones first
[1:49:46] there is mama there is papa there is my
[1:49:49] body
[1:49:51] amen hallelujah glory to god in the
[1:49:54] highest
[1:49:56] and this is not happening in the air
[1:49:59] all right
[1:50:00] and the question then comes so where is
[1:50:02] it happening
[1:50:08] why is it happening
[1:50:10] in the message the ten virgins the
[1:50:12] prophet of god says oh to see that old
[1:50:15] daddy of mine oh my see them old loved
[1:50:18] ones that went down in the faith you
[1:50:20] wanted to meet them see the sweetness of
[1:50:23] god knowing if we met him first we would
[1:50:26] wonder was mama in it did mama finally
[1:50:29] make it we have preached so hard and we
[1:50:31] tried was she here so his uncle joe here
[1:50:35] is the brother here he saw and so lord
[1:50:38] we love you we love you but first we are
[1:50:40] going to meet one another no wondering
[1:50:43] about it when we are all there
[1:50:48] what the prophet of god is saying here
[1:50:50] is the sweetness of god he knows if we
[1:50:53] would go to meet him he will become the
[1:50:55] principal team of our focus he will
[1:50:58] become the principal theme of our
[1:51:00] worship we supposed to just focus on one
[1:51:04] and him and him alone we shouldn't be
[1:51:06] wondering at that time did mama make it
[1:51:09] did my daughter make it did my son make
[1:51:12] it so god gives us an opportunity that
[1:51:14] we can meet first before we go to meet
[1:51:17] him
[1:51:21] and do a roll call somewhere
[1:51:24] oh did mama make it oh did my body make
[1:51:27] it did my sister make it and when we
[1:51:30] have accounted for everyone glory to god
[1:51:33] in the highest when we have accounted
[1:51:35] for everyone
[1:51:37] then
[1:51:38] we go to meet him in the air
[1:51:41] whoa
[1:51:45] glory to god in the eyes
[1:51:47] so there's going to be a meeting
[1:51:50] hallelujah and in this meeting that is
[1:51:53] where we are going to take stock
[1:51:56] of one another
[1:51:58] stocktek
[1:52:02] glory to god in the eyes
[1:52:05] but watch how are we going to know one
[1:52:07] another in that meeting oh i just love
[1:52:09] this prophet
[1:52:13] how are we going to know who is who
[1:52:16] in this meeting
[1:52:17] the prophet of god says he that was lost
[1:52:20] will be first and he that was first will
[1:52:23] be lost
[1:52:28] that's accounts right
[1:52:30] first in first out
[1:52:33] how many have done accounts
[1:52:35] all right
[1:52:36] is that right
[1:52:38] correct
[1:52:39] praise the lord
[1:52:41] he that was last to be first and he that
[1:52:44] was first will be lost how can he be
[1:52:46] that way stoktec
[1:52:50] that's the order of the resurrection i
[1:52:52] won't know nobody in the generation
[1:52:55] before me or the generation after me i
[1:52:58] will know those in the generation of
[1:53:00] this
[1:53:02] and every generation will come
[1:53:04] successfully right as it went down they
[1:53:07] which were last will be first sure it
[1:53:10] has to be i will know my people the next
[1:53:13] fellow my dad will know his people his
[1:53:16] grandfather his people on down like that
[1:53:21] or do you get what the prophet is saying
[1:53:24] what the prophet is saying is when we
[1:53:26] get to that meeting we gotta have some
[1:53:29] introductions but we don't know who is
[1:53:31] who
[1:53:34] but i know the people in my generation
[1:53:37] because i saw them growing up i know
[1:53:39] what they were like when they were about
[1:53:42] 19 20 21 when they appear i'll know who
[1:53:45] they are
[1:53:47] but those that went before us they will
[1:53:49] know their generation and that
[1:53:51] generation that went before it will know
[1:53:53] its generation and it will carry on the
[1:53:55] prophet says wave after wave after wave
[1:53:59] after wave and the saints are rising
[1:54:02] from everywhere won't that be wonderful
[1:54:06] oh that makes the old people feel young
[1:54:08] again
[1:54:10] oh come on saints of the living god
[1:54:12] when you start to think about that that
[1:54:15] boosts your fibers hallelujah
[1:54:18] [Applause]
[1:54:22] will be some introductions this
[1:54:24] generation will know the next generation
[1:54:26] and that generation will know the next
[1:54:29] generation and that generation who know
[1:54:31] the next generation until finally we
[1:54:34] will be introduced this is brother paul
[1:54:39] because if you go to meet brother paul
[1:54:41] you will not know brother paul
[1:54:45] you will not know saint peter
[1:54:47] the pictures that we may be seeing on
[1:54:49] the internet that this is saying peter
[1:54:51] after all they are of old people he
[1:54:54] won't be that old he will be a young man
[1:54:57] about 2021 i need somebody that lived in
[1:55:01] his generation to be able to introduce
[1:55:03] me and that's what the prophet is saying
[1:55:05] here that this generation will know that
[1:55:08] generation and that generation will know
[1:55:11] their generation until finally this is
[1:55:14] irenaeus
[1:55:18] this is saint martin
[1:55:22] and you have a picture with him with the
[1:55:23] ring and you're looking for that ring on
[1:55:25] the picture that's not what you would be
[1:55:27] like
[1:55:28] this is saying marin this is columba
[1:55:31] that edge messenger this is john wesley
[1:55:35] oh glory to god
[1:55:38] oh glory to god give god some praise
[1:55:40] somebody
[1:55:42] and the prophet of god says that ought
[1:55:45] to make an old man hallelujah get
[1:55:48] shouting get to feel excited
[1:55:52] glory
[1:55:54] oh church of the living god when i think
[1:55:57] about that meeting i can almost say even
[1:56:00] so come lord jesus
[1:56:03] it makes us want to leave this earth to
[1:56:06] say let that rapture come
[1:56:08] let that day amen now come for the
[1:56:11] church to go for that meeting that will
[1:56:14] be in the air
[1:56:17] now
[1:56:18] the question that is their saints
[1:56:21] is
[1:56:22] but
[1:56:23] we are changed
[1:56:25] first
[1:56:27] and where are we going to meet
[1:56:30] when we are changed
[1:56:33] where exactly are we going to be
[1:56:37] are we going to be walking on this earth
[1:56:41] oh in what realm are we going to be
[1:56:44] and this is really what brought the
[1:56:45] brother lincoln
[1:56:47] and he wanted to find out so this
[1:56:49] meeting
[1:56:50] where is it going to be
[1:56:52] because when you read the quotations it
[1:56:54] is very clear that this is not the
[1:56:56] appearing of saints before our body
[1:56:58] change this is a meeting that is coming
[1:57:00] after our body change
[1:57:02] and where is this meeting going to be
[1:57:05] and when you go to reading the message
[1:57:07] the prophet the way he puts it the
[1:57:09] prophet of god says the bible said
[1:57:13] we shall meet one another first
[1:57:17] now if the prophet did not say the
[1:57:19] scripture said i would not have been
[1:57:22] bothered
[1:57:25] because i would say he's a prophet of
[1:57:27] god if he says we meet one another first
[1:57:30] that's enough for me
[1:57:32] i will take it as his at his word
[1:57:35] but that's not what the prophet said the
[1:57:37] prophet said
[1:57:38] the scripture says
[1:57:42] and i wondered where does the scripture
[1:57:45] say we shall meet one another first
[1:57:52] where do we find it in the bible
[1:57:55] and the prophet said first thessalonians
[1:57:58] chapter 4 says we shall meet one another
[1:58:01] first before we go to meet the lord
[1:58:10] and i kept on wondering
[1:58:13] and i say to myself but if the prophet
[1:58:15] says the scripture it has got to be in
[1:58:17] the scripture
[1:58:19] but i was looking for it in the
[1:58:20] scripture and i couldn't find where we
[1:58:23] meet one another first
[1:58:26] then one morning in the early hours of
[1:58:28] the morning
[1:58:30] i times just wake up to go and pray
[1:58:33] and i remember very well it was on a
[1:58:35] thursday in the early hours of the
[1:58:36] morning
[1:58:37] everyone is asleep and i like to go and
[1:58:39] pray at that time and i went down amen
[1:58:42] into my study and i was just gonna start
[1:58:45] to pray and then i thought let me just
[1:58:46] start by reading the scripture
[1:58:49] and when i went to my bible to start
[1:58:51] reading the scripture i was just going
[1:58:53] to pick another verse but immediately it
[1:58:55] went straight to first thessalonians
[1:58:58] i did not choose first thessalonians but
[1:59:00] i just found myself right on first
[1:59:02] thessalonians
[1:59:04] god reaching mercy
[1:59:06] he knew i'd been worried and bothered
[1:59:08] about this and he wanted to show me the
[1:59:10] revelation that was lying right in front
[1:59:12] of me
[1:59:14] so i said well let me start by reading
[1:59:17] this and then i'll go to something else
[1:59:19] that i want to go to before i pray
[1:59:22] and when i started to read first
[1:59:23] thessalonians chapter 4 there was my
[1:59:26] answer
[1:59:28] and i said lord i've read this scripture
[1:59:31] so many times and i've never seen it
[1:59:36] are you ready for a church
[1:59:39] we sure had a prophet
[1:59:42] and i never cease to get amazed at the
[1:59:45] depth of this prophet
[1:59:47] how did he conclude that we are going to
[1:59:50] have a meeting first
[1:59:52] with our loved ones before we go to meet
[1:59:55] the lord in the air how did he conclude
[1:59:58] it
[1:59:59] are you ready for a church
[2:00:01] and that brings me now to the three
[2:00:03] dimensions of the rapture
[2:00:06] or somebody says just tell me what it is
[2:00:08] preacher man i'm zooming in now onto
[2:00:11] first thessalonians 4 that verse number
[2:00:14] 17 that i said we don't take real look
[2:00:17] at we just passed through the verse
[2:00:20] are you ready for a church
[2:00:23] look at first thessalonians chapter 4
[2:00:25] chapter 4 it says and the dead in christ
[2:00:28] shall rise first then we which are alive
[2:00:32] and remain shall be caught up with them
[2:00:35] in
[2:00:36] the
[2:00:38] to meet the lord in thee
[2:00:44] and so shall we ever be with
[2:00:48] paul gives us three distinct places
[2:00:53] and the bible does not play with words
[2:00:57] so the first thing that happens we will
[2:00:59] be caught up together with them in the
[2:01:02] clouds so the first meeting it does not
[2:01:04] happen in the air
[2:01:09] the first meeting it happens in the
[2:01:12] clouds
[2:01:14] and then after the clouds then we go to
[2:01:17] meet the lord we're in the air
[2:01:20] and so shall we ever be with the lord
[2:01:24] now i give you to understand the clouds
[2:01:26] and the air are not the same place
[2:01:30] these are different dimensions if he
[2:01:33] wanted to say
[2:01:34] he would have said we will be caught up
[2:01:36] together with them in the air to meet
[2:01:39] the lord in the air but the bible does
[2:01:41] not read like that the bible said we
[2:01:44] will be caught up together with them
[2:01:46] we're in the clouds
[2:01:49] and then after the clouds into the air
[2:01:52] and then after the air into where the
[2:01:54] lord is
[2:01:56] [Applause]
[2:01:59] and those are the three dimensions of
[2:02:01] the rapture praise be to god in the
[2:02:04] highest so the first dimension of the
[2:02:06] rapture amen it is in the clouds
[2:02:11] we shall be caught up together with them
[2:02:13] in that realm of the cloud hallelujah
[2:02:16] and when we go there that is where the
[2:02:18] first meeting is going to be
[2:02:21] praise be to god
[2:02:23] now where is this level of this cloud in
[2:02:26] what dimension is this we shall be
[2:02:28] caught up together with them that are
[2:02:30] asleep who would have resurrected at
[2:02:32] that time in this church these are six
[2:02:36] dimension beings
[2:02:38] is that right
[2:02:39] because they are in the sixth dimension
[2:02:41] right now
[2:02:42] and i give you to understand that god is
[2:02:45] not going to demote them to come to the
[2:02:47] three dimensions
[2:02:50] glory to god
[2:02:52] hallelujah
[2:02:54] in another quotation the prophet of god
[2:02:56] says imagine you were once a pig
[2:02:59] and then god changes you to become a
[2:03:01] human being
[2:03:02] you would never want to go to become a
[2:03:04] pig again
[2:03:05] and the prophet is talking about when
[2:03:08] you have died and when you have gone
[2:03:09] beyond amen and then somebody says you
[2:03:13] want to come back
[2:03:16] you want to experience humanity again
[2:03:18] then the prophet of god says it's like
[2:03:20] comparing a pig life with human life
[2:03:24] now these have been living in the sixth
[2:03:26] dimension these they know what it is
[2:03:29] like in the sixth dimension there is no
[2:03:31] way that god is gonna demote them to
[2:03:34] come back to the three dimensions so
[2:03:36] what happens we are to be caught up
[2:03:40] to get to their level they can come down
[2:03:44] all glory
[2:03:46] i'm reminded of nehemiah nehemiah
[2:03:50] and gosham they sent unto him a message
[2:03:52] one time and they said come down so that
[2:03:55] we can deal with this and nehemiah send
[2:03:58] the word back and he says i'm doing a
[2:04:00] great work and i can't come down
[2:04:03] and i can hear the saints in the sixth
[2:04:06] dimension want to pull me back onto
[2:04:08] three i can't come down
[2:04:12] and god says i would rather raise them
[2:04:14] that are in the three dimensions and
[2:04:17] take them to the same level that these
[2:04:20] ayat so we shall be caught up together
[2:04:23] with them
[2:04:28] and where are we going to be caught up
[2:04:30] together with them in the clouds
[2:04:34] and watch sayings how scriptural paul
[2:04:36] poets
[2:04:39] and it brings me back to acts chapter
[2:04:41] one because in like manner things must
[2:04:44] repeat
[2:04:45] and in acts chapter 1 verse 9 and when
[2:04:48] he had spoken these things while they
[2:04:50] beheld he was taken up and the cloud
[2:04:53] received him
[2:04:56] what is the mystery of this cloud
[2:05:01] glory to god
[2:05:03] verse 11 which also said he men of
[2:05:06] galilee why standing gazing up into
[2:05:08] heaven the same jesus which is taken up
[2:05:11] from you into heaven shall so come in
[2:05:14] like manna
[2:05:17] it shall repeat
[2:05:19] a cloud received him what was this cloud
[2:05:22] that received him i give you to
[2:05:24] understand that this cloud was the cloud
[2:05:27] of witnesses it was the cloud of the old
[2:05:30] testament saints it was the cloud of
[2:05:33] them that had resurrected them that were
[2:05:36] walking because the bible does not tell
[2:05:38] us when they ascended
[2:05:45] can i bring some scripture to it hebrews
[2:05:48] chapter 11
[2:05:50] paul begins to tell us of another cloud
[2:05:52] and he says in hebrews 11 39 and these
[2:05:55] all having obtained a good report
[2:05:57] through faith receive not the promise
[2:06:00] god having provided
[2:06:02] some better thing for us that they
[2:06:04] without us should not be made perfect
[2:06:07] and then hebrews 12 1 we're foreseeing
[2:06:11] we are also compassed about we so great
[2:06:14] a cloud of witnesses
[2:06:18] what was that cloud of witnesses it was
[2:06:21] the cloud that paul had been talking
[2:06:23] about in the book of hebrews chapter 11
[2:06:26] and that cloud of witnesses he starts
[2:06:29] with it with abel the one we looked at
[2:06:32] yesterday he moved from abel he gets to
[2:06:35] enoch he moves from enoch he gets to
[2:06:37] know he moves from nowhere he gets to
[2:06:40] abraham he moves from abraham he gets to
[2:06:43] sarah he moves from sarah or praise be
[2:06:45] to god he gets to a joseph from a joseph
[2:06:49] he gets to a moses from a moses praise
[2:06:52] be to god then we get to the rap
[2:06:56] oh god read libraries 11 if you think
[2:06:58] i'm wrong
[2:06:59] [Applause]
[2:07:01] praise god in the highest and then after
[2:07:04] here's gone hallelujah then he comes on
[2:07:07] praise be to god and he says amen time
[2:07:10] fails us to speak of gideon to speak of
[2:07:13] baraka to speak of simon to speak of
[2:07:16] jephthah to speak of david to speak of
[2:07:19] somehow these are the cloud of witness
[2:07:22] [Applause]
[2:07:24] and that very same cloud of weakness it
[2:07:26] was representing hallelujah them that
[2:07:29] resurrected when christ rose in matthew
[2:07:32] chapter 27.
[2:07:34] in that very same cloud it is the same
[2:07:36] cloud that we now find in acts chapter
[2:07:39] number one and in acts chapter one amen
[2:07:42] and a cloud received him
[2:07:46] what was the cloud it was the cloud of
[2:07:49] weaknesses
[2:07:50] it was the old testament saints that
[2:07:53] we're now going together with him
[2:07:56] and the prophet of god gives us this
[2:07:58] same people in psalms chapter 24 when he
[2:08:01] begins to talk of psalms 24 he says when
[2:08:04] christ was now ascending the prophet
[2:08:07] says then the scripture says lift up
[2:08:10] your heads oh ye gates and be lifted up
[2:08:14] ye everlasting doors and the king of
[2:08:16] glory shall come in who is the king of
[2:08:19] glory the question comes from the
[2:08:21] insider and then from the outside of the
[2:08:24] gate the lord strong and mighty the lord
[2:08:27] mighty in battle lift up your head or
[2:08:30] your case even lift up the
[2:08:33] even lift them up the everlasting dose
[2:08:36] and the king of glory shall come in
[2:08:39] and the prophet of god says these were
[2:08:41] the saints of the old testament who went
[2:08:44] up with the lord as he was going back up
[2:08:47] after his ascension they are the ones
[2:08:49] that screamed or lift up e gates the
[2:08:53] everlasting case
[2:08:55] that cloud
[2:08:58] glory oh god
[2:09:00] that cloud that ascended with him it is
[2:09:02] the very same cloud hallelujah a man of
[2:09:06] the saints that are shouting these words
[2:09:10] [Applause]
[2:09:12] so we shall meet up together with them
[2:09:14] in the clouds
[2:09:17] seeing we are campers about with such a
[2:09:20] great cloud of weaknesses
[2:09:22] and i give you to understand that cloud
[2:09:24] did not stop with the old testament
[2:09:26] saints that one went with them but after
[2:09:29] that the dead in christ have been
[2:09:31] accumulating
[2:09:33] they without us cannot be made perfect
[2:09:37] where are they now they are a cloud of
[2:09:39] witnesses
[2:09:41] and they are the very same people that
[2:09:43] shall return onto earth in the 40 days
[2:09:47] to pick up their glorified bodies and
[2:09:50] then after the 40 days these are the
[2:09:52] ones we shall be caught up together with
[2:09:55] them in the clouds
[2:09:59] we shall be promoted glory
[2:10:02] to step into the cloud of witnesses to
[2:10:05] become a parent parcel of them and when
[2:10:08] we step into that praise be regarded
[2:10:11] that is where we are going to be asking
[2:10:13] his mama made it this papa made it is my
[2:10:16] body made it is my daughter made it you
[2:10:19] are checking everyone and if god gives
[2:10:22] you enough time to check whether
[2:10:24] everyone has made it
[2:10:27] how long a time is going to be i don't
[2:10:29] know
[2:10:31] but the prophet says we are going to be
[2:10:34] given a time to check if our loved ones
[2:10:36] have made it
[2:10:40] and after we are satisfied
[2:10:42] that they have made it after we have
[2:10:44] reconciled after everything is done then
[2:10:48] we go to the next stage the next
[2:10:50] dimension of the rapture which is a
[2:10:52] meeting in the air
[2:10:56] can i bring you to scripture
[2:10:58] oh i love the prophet
[2:11:01] one of these days we will stand out
[2:11:03] yonder we will stand out beyond the
[2:11:05] earth beyond the ring of the earth out
[2:11:08] yonder somewhere in space and we won't
[2:11:11] be in heaven yet we will be caught up to
[2:11:13] meet him in the air
[2:11:16] we won't be in heaven yet
[2:11:21] remember it was in the evening time and
[2:11:24] rebecca writing on the camel eliazer
[2:11:27] said there he comes now
[2:11:30] so we are given an example of this
[2:11:32] meeting in the air
[2:11:34] and the prophet says and rebecca jumped
[2:11:36] off the camel pulled the veil from her
[2:11:38] face she had never seen him didn't know
[2:11:41] that was her husband but she had never
[2:11:43] seen him she was going to meet him by
[2:11:45] faith i don't know what he looks like
[2:11:47] but oh when i see him out there when she
[2:11:50] seen him it was love at the first sight
[2:11:54] and he had never seen her so he seen her
[2:11:57] laugh at the first time and here they
[2:11:59] come to meet one another in the fields
[2:12:03] and he took her in to be into he
[2:12:06] in to be his father's kingdom over there
[2:12:10] and marry there
[2:12:12] so the meeting in the air is given a
[2:12:15] type amen in rebecca meeting isaac
[2:12:19] or gloria or god
[2:12:21] in the ten virgins the prophet says
[2:12:23] that's the way the church will be caught
[2:12:25] up in the air in the middle of the air
[2:12:28] and meet the lord on his road down oh
[2:12:30] what in a faith will be love at the
[2:12:33] first sight and when we stand there upon
[2:12:35] the rings of the earth and rising them
[2:12:39] and seeing them songs of redemption oh
[2:12:41] my how will sing and praise him for the
[2:12:44] redeeming grace that he has given us
[2:12:46] when angels will cover the size the
[2:12:49] circles of the earth with bowed heads
[2:12:52] not knowing what we are talking about
[2:12:54] them angels wasn't lost they won't know
[2:12:57] what it means to be saved we was the
[2:12:59] ones who was lost we were the one we
[2:13:02] will understand then what a horrible
[2:13:05] thing laid ahead of us and he redeemed
[2:13:08] us by his blood out of every crindle
[2:13:10] tongue and nation what a day of
[2:13:12] rejoicing that would be
[2:13:16] oh i'm looking forward to that day
[2:13:18] when angels cannot join in the song that
[2:13:21] we will begin to sing and where is that
[2:13:24] happening saints we will meet our lord
[2:13:27] fest thessalonians in the air
[2:13:32] and this is not yet in heaven the
[2:13:34] prophet says
[2:13:36] praise be to god hallelujah and then
[2:13:39] after that that is when now he will take
[2:13:42] us praise be to god to that marriage
[2:13:45] supper
[2:13:47] so it's a meeting that happens in the
[2:13:49] air where did isaac meet rebecca he met
[2:13:52] rebecca in the field
[2:13:57] it was not in his father's kingdom
[2:14:00] he took off from his father king's
[2:14:02] father's kingdom and he stepped into the
[2:14:04] field when he was in the field that's
[2:14:06] when rebecca looked and he says to
[2:14:09] eliasa who is that that is coming under
[2:14:12] and elias has said
[2:14:14] that is my seventh that is my master son
[2:14:18] and immediately she failed a face
[2:14:21] and the meeting happened in the field
[2:14:24] can you say amen
[2:14:26] it did not happen in the father's
[2:14:28] kingdom and eliasa was the one that then
[2:14:31] said behold your husband
[2:14:35] and i believe it is at that meeting in
[2:14:37] the air that is when malachi falls shall
[2:14:40] say to the bride behold your husband
[2:14:44] [Applause]
[2:14:47] o glory to god in the highest
[2:14:51] he will introduce us as the eleazar of
[2:14:54] our day and he will say behold your
[2:14:57] husband at the meeting in the air
[2:15:01] praise god in the highest amen so we
[2:15:05] have moved from the clouds and we get to
[2:15:07] the air and then after the meeting in
[2:15:09] the air then he takes us
[2:15:12] to the father's kingdom
[2:15:14] give the lord a hand of praise
[2:15:20] there is your dimensions
[2:15:22] of the rapture
[2:15:23] [Applause]
[2:15:25] there is the cloud dimension there is
[2:15:27] the air dimension and then there is the
[2:15:29] kingdom's father's place dimension those
[2:15:33] are your three dimensions church of the
[2:15:35] living god we are a blessed people
[2:15:39] let me say to you you might not have
[2:15:41] money in your pocket but you are blessed
[2:15:45] because those that have money they don't
[2:15:47] have this privilege
[2:15:49] you might not have the house that you
[2:15:50] want to have but you are blessed
[2:15:53] you might not own a mansion but you are
[2:15:55] blessed
[2:15:56] you might not the daughter you might not
[2:15:58] be the daughter of a donald trump but
[2:16:00] you are blessed
[2:16:02] you might not live in the white house
[2:16:04] but you are blessed
[2:16:05] you might not be the daughter of the
[2:16:07] queen of england but you are blessed
[2:16:10] oh count your blessings
[2:16:12] begin to name them one by one
[2:16:14] what god has in store for you it is far
[2:16:17] greater than you can ever imagine can
[2:16:20] you say amen
[2:16:21] brother sister to know that there is a
[2:16:24] rapture that is coming there is a
[2:16:26] meeting in the cloud that is destined
[2:16:28] for me and there is a meeting in the air
[2:16:31] that ought to make everyone walk with
[2:16:32] their chest out and say yes i'm a son of
[2:16:36] a king i'm a daughter of a king this
[2:16:39] world is not my arm i'm just a passing
[2:16:42] through i have a land that is up beyond
[2:16:44] that i have a place
[2:16:46] that god is destined for me
[2:16:49] so let me tell you church if this life
[2:16:51] has dealt you a thorough blow until you
[2:16:54] don't want any of it there is a better
[2:16:56] place that is waiting for you
[2:16:59] and that is what gives us great comfort
[2:17:01] until paul says wherefore comfort one
[2:17:04] another with these words
[2:17:07] there is another better place better
[2:17:10] than here where we are there is another
[2:17:12] better place a heaven that we can make
[2:17:15] too
[2:17:17] glory to god
[2:17:19] amen and amen
[2:17:21] so those are our dimensions of the
[2:17:23] rapture let me now summarize it
[2:17:26] and put it in diagram form
[2:17:28] so that it can stick with you
[2:17:31] and you can never forget it
[2:17:33] those are the three dimensions of the
[2:17:35] rapture
[2:17:36] there is the cloud dimension there is
[2:17:38] the air and then there is the seventh
[2:17:41] dimension heaven
[2:17:43] is that what paul calls them amen in
[2:17:45] first thessalonians chapter four
[2:17:47] here on earth we are still in these
[2:17:50] three dimensions that is the realm where
[2:17:52] you and i are dwelling
[2:17:54] and if we look into where we are where
[2:17:55] we are dwelling we have here all sorts
[2:17:58] of people
[2:18:00] we have the unsaved people
[2:18:02] those are going nowhere
[2:18:07] then we have the foolish virgin
[2:18:10] so near yet so far
[2:18:13] but we have the wise virgin
[2:18:15] praise be to god and the wise virgin
[2:18:18] she's the one that the rapture is coming
[2:18:20] for
[2:18:21] she's the one that is destined to be
[2:18:24] taken up hallelujah and then together
[2:18:26] with that we also then have them that
[2:18:30] are asleep in christ
[2:18:32] but at the time of the rapture what is
[2:18:34] going to happen first amen these will
[2:18:37] start to appear to us amen for a period
[2:18:41] of about 40 days
[2:18:43] but in their appearing we are still here
[2:18:46] in these three dimensions
[2:18:49] are you following me church are you
[2:18:52] following me church
[2:18:53] so they begin to appear and that is what
[2:18:56] gives us a rapturing faith the final
[2:18:58] rapturing faith the prophet of god says
[2:19:02] when we behold them when we see them
[2:19:04] hallelujah then it gives us the faith
[2:19:07] for the change of our bodies
[2:19:12] and then hallelujah the voice of the
[2:19:16] archangel amen it is what has sounded it
[2:19:19] is what has brought these amen and they
[2:19:22] begin to appear
[2:19:24] but after the voice of the archangel
[2:19:26] then comes the trump of god and when the
[2:19:28] trump of god comes then it calls us for
[2:19:31] a gathering a gathering way a gathering
[2:19:34] now into the clouds
[2:19:38] and it is in this cloud that is where we
[2:19:41] are going to ask his mama made it as
[2:19:44] papa made it his sister made it we are
[2:19:47] asking god gives us an opportunity in
[2:19:50] the clouds give god some glory
[2:19:53] [Music]
[2:19:55] we are not yet with the lord
[2:19:58] just the meeting in the clouds
[2:20:01] oh glory to god in the highest after the
[2:20:04] meeting in the cloud then what happens
[2:20:07] amen eliazza is already with us in the
[2:20:11] cloud then the king he steps from his
[2:20:14] dimension and he comes into the field he
[2:20:18] comes where ready hallelujah to meet his
[2:20:21] bride he knows she's just about to come
[2:20:25] so he steps down and he comes into the
[2:20:31] [Applause]
[2:20:35] and when he comes in there then the next
[2:20:38] thing that happens we are then caught up
[2:20:40] to go a little higher to go away to go
[2:20:44] meet the lord in the air
[2:20:47] oh give god some praise somebody
[2:20:53] hallelujah
[2:20:55] after we meet him in there then the
[2:20:57] final thing is we go to the last part
[2:21:00] then he takes us into the father's
[2:21:03] kingdom he lifts us up hallelujah from
[2:21:06] this dimension from this interaction of
[2:21:08] dimensions and he takes us now to go
[2:21:11] away to the seventh dimension where now

[2:49:09] sincere thanks for
[2:49:11] rapturing faith
[2:49:13] opening the doors to have
[2:49:15] this meeting
[2:49:18] amen
[2:49:20] and i believe
[2:49:22] it was
[2:49:24] worth every sacrifice amen that the
[2:49:26] saints made to
[2:49:28] to be here and i know we had many from
[2:49:30] the uk but there was a you know we
[2:49:33] didn't we didn't
[2:49:34] publish anything we didn't send out any
[2:49:37] announcements y'all know sometimes we
[2:49:38] have meetings and we have chairs all
[2:49:41] around and everything like that but we
[2:49:42] didn't want to do it that way this time
[2:49:44] it says just
[2:49:45] fellowship between two churches
[2:49:48] and um you know and we included a couple
[2:49:51] others one of them would be amen uh
[2:49:54] brother joe underwood in the church from
[2:49:56] ocala and i think you can understand why
[2:49:58] they would be here
[2:50:00] amen you know brother joe underwood is
[2:50:02] brother wesco's
[2:50:04] son-in-law
[2:50:05] amen
[2:50:06] so many of the saints from ocala
[2:50:09] amen came to be and we're so happy to
[2:50:11] have them
[2:50:12] amen here and and then um
[2:50:14] spirit and truth is represented as well
[2:50:17] and and i think you know why that is
[2:50:19] because i assisted a little bit with
[2:50:21] this
[2:50:22] praise the lord so i should be welcome
[2:50:25] to come
[2:50:29] we had some saints from indiana south
[2:50:32] carolina
[2:50:34] north carolina
[2:50:35] amen and i think there might be
[2:50:37] something else i'm missing here um
[2:50:40] what other state i'm missing i'm not
[2:50:42] sure
[2:50:43] but nonetheless we just thank god for
[2:50:45] everybody coming and just making these
[2:50:47] meetings
[2:50:48] uh what they what they have been and and
[2:50:50] as brother whisper said we want to do it
[2:50:52] again and brother wesko confirmed west
[2:50:54] palm beach so
[2:50:56] amen i'm gonna agree with him on that so
[2:50:59] hey man let it let it happen again here
[2:51:02] uh tonight i just felt that the word
[2:51:04] that the lord gave us
[2:51:07] was a very prophetic word
[2:51:10] and
[2:51:12] something to encourage us if you go back
[2:51:13] and listen to the sermon
[2:51:15] things that ought to be brother branham
[2:51:17] preaches a sermon there that just really
[2:51:18] encourages you when you when you're
[2:51:20] going through something if you've lost a
[2:51:21] loved one or something like that that's
[2:51:23] a sermon for you to go back to to listen
[2:51:25] to it just really really just gives you
[2:51:27] a different
[2:51:28] perspective but i was just very
[2:51:31] appreciative the other thing i felt
[2:51:32] tonight
[2:51:33] a man um
[2:51:35] and and and and being a minister i know
[2:51:38] sometimes it's very difficult to bring
[2:51:40] certain sermons
[2:51:41] certain places
[2:51:43] but i felt like brother gwen had a
[2:51:46] liberty here in south florida
[2:51:50] and and you all have created that type
[2:51:52] of environment
[2:51:54] a summer like that can't be preached
[2:51:55] everywhere but somehow god said it can
[2:51:57] be preached right here so we're grateful
[2:52:00] a man that we could we could hear such
[2:52:02] words and and one day amen you'll see
[2:52:05] how how much this really meant
[2:52:08] how much this really meant just just
[2:52:10] everything after the sermon just some of
[2:52:11] the songs that were being sang it was a
[2:52:14] special moment
[2:52:16] very special moment i'm glad we got it
[2:52:18] on video
[2:52:20] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:52:24] so
[2:52:26] um i know that brother mike say we will
[2:52:29] um let you be dismissed so i'm what i'm
[2:52:32] gonna do is i'm gonna say a dismissing
[2:52:33] prayer because some of y'all don't want
[2:52:34] to leave i know i understand i
[2:52:36] understand he said you got to go to work
[2:52:38] in the morning and all of that my god
[2:52:40] but when you in the world
[2:52:43] you ain't think like that
