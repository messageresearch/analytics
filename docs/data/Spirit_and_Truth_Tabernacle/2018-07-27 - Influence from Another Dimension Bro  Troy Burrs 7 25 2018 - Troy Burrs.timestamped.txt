[8:55] [Music]
[8:57] this even y'all pray for me it's a
[9:02] really been a blessing to me I've sort
[9:07] of been walking around with a little
[9:09] something in my Bible for the past
[9:12] almost six months and designed for the
[9:18] Lord to just give me something on it and
[9:21] when when Jack said I was going to be
[9:26] carrying the service I really didn't
[9:29] have anything and you know it's just
[9:31] amazing how the Lord just kind of just
[9:34] kind of just started freaking for things
[9:35] so I'll tell you what I'm excited about
[9:38] it and I hope I can deliver it amen so
[9:41] that you it'll be a real blessing to you
[9:44] amen let us grab our Bibles a man in
[9:48] turn to Ephesians six chapter Ephesians
[9:55] 2:6 chapter I hope it's not too slow and
[9:59] broken up but I know that there are some
[10:03] legate's in here a man that is that'll
[10:06] really help the bride of Jesus Christ
[10:10] amen
[10:11] we're gonna expose the devil this seen a
[10:15] man exposing you know when when this
[10:20] came to me I thought was I said I knew I
[10:25] said not a devil immediately when I when
[10:28] I when I came across this and it started
[10:30] breaking somehow saying how the devil
[10:31] gonna fight you on this but just the
[10:34] thought there's Kings ever really gonna
[10:35] fight you on this
[10:37] and it has been a real battle but we're
[10:40] gonna press the battle anyway Eggman
[10:44] Ephesians the sixth chapter we're gonna
[10:46] start at the eleventh verse and it reads
[10:49] put on the whole armour of God that you
[10:54] may be able to stand against the wiles
[10:57] of the devil and I'd like to just stop
[11:02] right there for a minute and just ask
[11:04] the question what are the wiles of the
[11:09] devil so for we it says for we wrestle
[11:13] not against flesh and blood now I didn't
[11:19] say we didn't wrestle so if it didn't
[11:22] say we didn't wrestle we wrestle not
[11:24] against flesh and blood we do wrestle
[11:27] but what we wrestle against is
[11:31] principalities against powers against
[11:34] the rulers of darkness of this world
[11:37] against spiritual wickedness in high
[11:39] places
[11:40] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[11:43] of God that ye may be with yet that ye
[11:45] may be able to stand amen and that you
[11:51] may be able to stand I lost my place
[11:57] y'all hold on hold on okay as you may be
[12:01] able to stand virtually just how many
[12:03] where you take unto the whole armor God
[12:05] will but youbut you may be able to
[12:07] withstand the evil day and having done
[12:10] all to stand stand therefore having your
[12:14] loins Girt about with truth and having
[12:17] on the breastplate of righteousness and
[12:20] your feet shod with the preparation of
[12:23] the gospel of peace above all taking the
[12:26] shield of faith wherewith ye shall be
[12:28] able to quench the fiery darts of the
[12:31] wicked and take the helmet of salvation
[12:32] as water to Spirit which is the word of
[12:35] God praying always with all prayer
[12:37] supplication in the spirit watching
[12:41] their fall with all presence and
[12:44] supplications for all saints and for me
[12:49] the utterance may give unto me that I
[12:52] may open my mouth boldly to make known
[12:55] the mystery of the gospel even the lure
[12:57] that our blessing to the reading of his
[12:58] word amen
[13:00] that our you may be seated I want to
[13:03] just give a little a little a little
[13:07] talk on if I had the title this
[13:13] influence from another dimension
[13:18] influence from another dimension
[13:23] we know that that the Prophet brought
[13:30] out how we live in a dimension of time
[13:38] matter in life we live in the region
[13:44] a man of time matter of life matter in
[13:47] life now you know we for some reason as
[13:51] human beings we get a superficial image
[13:57] of God a superficial image when when
[14:02] they talk about God is up in heaven and
[14:06] Satan is below inhale
[14:09] automatically we think about a
[14:12] horizontal dispensation we think about
[14:17] God being sitting way way way up high
[14:21] above the clouds and some magical
[14:24] kingdom from million million light-years
[14:27] away and we think about Satan being
[14:31] below some million miles below and
[14:36] beneath the earth but when it talks
[14:39] about being above and then below it's
[14:44] not necessarily talking about a
[14:47] geographical location it's talking about
[14:51] a dimension those spirits
[14:57] are just living in another dimension we
[15:01] are living in a dimension right now that
[15:06] we can't see all of the things that are
[15:10] going on in this room because we're
[15:12] living in a dimension of time now I have
[15:19] a chart that I will if y'all did you get
[15:22] the chart sister can you put that up on
[15:24] the projector a man we have this chart
[15:32] that that'll help and and I tell you
[15:36] what I'm not going to be able to finish
[15:37] this tonight but we'll get started on it
[15:40] and and and some other time we'll finish
[15:46] it up because it's there's there's just
[15:48] so much there's just so much here a man
[15:51] the Prophet says here he's thought it
[15:56] for Mars and come here flying at the
[15:59] speed of light light space or light
[16:02] speed it would take him a billions of
[16:05] years to get here he says I cannot
[16:08] believe that there is the house way out
[16:11] yonder see Jesus said I'd go prepare a
[16:16] place for you that where I am you may be
[16:19] also
[16:20] it's not a place some way way out yonder
[16:24] speaking he says God was speaking of a
[16:28] right present here now that that's the
[16:33] place where the mortal beings when we
[16:37] cease to be mortal here we step into
[16:42] immortality yonder into a place he says
[16:47] and I believe that's where Jesus is
[16:49] today the resurrected Lord Jesus not out
[16:53] yonder somewhere a million miles away
[16:56] but right here in their presence with us
[16:58] now in the fourth dimension people can
[17:04] prove that right through this room now
[17:06] is coming radioactive
[17:09] radio messages coming right through this
[17:13] building now it's coming television
[17:16] pictures but it's too fast
[17:18] for our eyes to see them now you go
[17:22] millions and millions of miles beyond
[17:25] that dimension and you'll get into a
[17:29] place that as real as television
[17:33] pictures is in this room this morning
[17:35] there is the Lord Jesus Christ to
[17:38] resurrect the son of God standing there
[17:41] and the reason that you can't see him is
[17:45] because your heart hasn't become tuned
[17:49] down to it and the reason you can't see
[17:54] the television where our bodies are not
[17:57] sent as instruments to pick up
[18:00] mechanical things but when our body
[18:03] becomes tuned with God becoming a part
[18:07] of him then our soul can pick up power
[18:12] of the Holy Ghost and indicate the
[18:15] presence of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[18:17] all of his power and omnipotence he has
[18:22] risen from the dead he lives among us
[18:25] today and he wants fellowship back with
[18:28] his people he's great
[18:30] majestic his glory is now spreading
[18:34] forth and he is designed fellowship
[18:38] again with his people amen now the
[18:42] motive beans is one of the things who
[18:45] lives in the mortal habitation
[18:47] immortalise lives in immortal
[18:49] habitations then the place that we go
[18:53] into until we return back to the place
[18:57] of brick and mortar and clay or precious
[19:00] stones and jewels
[19:01] it's not a it's I'm sorry it is a place
[19:06] of condition that we move out of this
[19:10] dimension that we live in another
[19:13] dimension and it's a house a tabernacle
[19:16] a dwelling place
[19:19] say destroy this temple and I'll raise
[19:21] it up again in three days and there and
[19:25] they all he was speaking of Solomon's
[19:29] Temple but he was speaking of his own
[19:32] body and he has gone to prepare a place
[19:36] for every believer that every moment we
[19:39] step out of these mortal regions we
[19:43] don't go out into some myth or some
[19:46] supernatural spirit but we go into a
[19:48] tabernacle a dwelling place that might
[19:52] be right here in this building this
[19:54] morning in this place amen so we realize
[19:59] that that that that our our spiritual I
[20:04] was spiritual antennas he says okay I'm
[20:08] thank you we see here on this chart you
[20:12] can't get the whole chart on I don't
[20:15] know if you can turn it sideways and not
[20:17] know okay we see here that we live here
[20:24] in and in the region of mortal beings
[20:28] here hey man let me see if this I can
[20:33] get now this don't work that do it
[20:37] am I ever
[20:45] amen
[20:51] thank you brother okay I see okay how do
[20:57] I get the corner okay thank you
[21:05] now we see here that we live here in
[21:09] this region of mortal beings but now we
[21:14] see here in this fourth dimension is the
[21:20] rim of science this fourth dimension is
[21:25] rim of science now here in this Trinity
[21:28] which is the region of mortal beings
[21:31] where we live we live in a light matter
[21:36] and time these areas are we contact this
[21:41] by our five senses see hearing touch
[21:48] okay our five sentence but now we have a
[21:52] sixth sense which is faith that can
[21:57] contact into this dimension up here the
[22:01] region of the bless amen
[22:04] now we see science here the fourth
[22:07] dimension reaches all the way up it goes
[22:10] into the region of the Laois into the
[22:14] demon spirits see and and down even into
[22:17] hell were to double himself the whales
[22:20] and you can see here where these open
[22:22] gates hey man that has been open that
[22:25] have contact from these regions all the
[22:29] way up into the region that we live in
[22:33] that is the reason you we see certain
[22:40] things in television and different
[22:43] things where people able to do movie
[22:49] roles or scary movie roles and all kind
[22:51] of filthy things and different things
[22:54] what are they doing
[22:55] you talk to some actors what they doing
[22:58] they have two action
[23:00] the channel themselves into this region
[23:04] to pick up inspiration from this region
[23:09] and bring it out into this region by
[23:12] science and television and radio and
[23:15] this is where we live to affect us in
[23:24] this flesh now they can't get our soul
[23:29] because the our soul is up just a little
[23:32] bit higher now we can actually tune into
[23:38] this area as well how do we tune into
[23:41] this area break it down a little bit if
[23:46] you see this little bit of thing over
[23:47] here says revelation by revelation see
[23:55] by revelation is how we get ourselves in
[23:59] tune with the spirit of the Holy Spirit
[24:04] which is right here in this dimension
[24:08] this is where our six cent you see here
[24:11] state the realm of immortal being this
[24:14] is faith this our faith context this let
[24:19] me read you some quotes it's a man a man
[24:31] I see okay you could either that brother
[24:39] you could don't worry now he says here
[24:42] he says here is a line like this they're
[24:48] all mortals on this side and on that
[24:55] side
[24:56] men are influenced by one side this side
[25:04] comes from God this side come from God
[25:13] you see this little line where is it
[25:16] right here
[25:17] it says this is the writing line between
[25:21] mortal and immortality okay now he says
[25:28] here that this side comes from the devil
[25:34] amen
[25:35] now let's just take a great
[25:38] conglomeration of blackness and gaiety
[25:41] and milk and sin and diverse knees of
[25:46] this world every once in a while you see
[25:50] a little white spot what is that he said
[25:54] that is a Christian like a light that
[25:59] though that those that are in the
[26:01] darkness are influenced from beneath let
[26:07] me read that again
[26:09] he says that's a Christian like a light
[26:15] now those that are in darkness are
[26:20] influenced from beneath those that are
[26:24] in light are influenced from above now
[26:30] now when you leave either one of these
[26:34] channels you go into the realm of the
[26:38] Spirit this is a
[26:40] model real the dimension that we live
[26:43] but that we live in now if you go this
[26:47] way listen close if you go this way the
[26:50] first dimension is the spirit of the day
[26:56] this way we live here if you go this way
[27:02] the first dimension is the spirit of the
[27:06] day okay say Peter spoke of it in prison
[27:11] that repented not repented though that
[27:14] repents it not by long-suffering in the
[27:17] days of Noah the wicked Unruh generated
[27:21] man when he dies his spirit goes into
[27:25] this realm the region of loss goes into
[27:30] that realm the next realm below these
[27:36] are demons the next room below is hell
[27:41] I'm giving you a parable so you can see
[27:45] it now what happens to that woman when
[27:52] she broke into the rim to the people
[27:56] absolutely are dead sin and trespasses
[27:58] and I was talking about I believe here
[28:02] the Witch of Endor let's see here
[28:10] absolutely dead in trespasses and that's
[28:13] all we know about the way okay no I'm
[28:17] sorry and that happened to the woman she
[28:20] broke into that RIM to see to the people
[28:25] that absolutely are dead in sin and
[28:28] trespasses and that's all they know
[28:31] about is the is the way the tree leans
[28:35] is the way the tree falls there she
[28:42] broke into that RIM talking to the
[28:46] spirits of the day now going this way
[28:50] the first thing the spirit
[28:52] of a man that God that died and rose
[28:55] again I'm talking about the other way
[28:57] not going this way okay going up we
[29:03] taught the first thing the spirit of a
[29:05] man that died and rose again Christ the
[29:08] Holy Spirit
[29:09] that's what influences the believer
[29:12] going upward the next is angelic beings
[29:18] the next is heaven itself the third
[29:23] heaven amen oh my I see something
[29:26] glorious when Jesus died yonder at
[29:29] Calvary a procreation for our sins he
[29:34] did not just just man but sinner not of
[29:42] his own but mine and yours sins sent him
[29:47] through the regions of the laws but can
[29:52] you get me a paper time brother Geoffrey
[29:56] thank you
[30:01] amen the sins are him and region and I
[30:08] can see him when he died young that
[30:10] caliber hanger between those two mile
[30:12] fighters crying my god
[30:14] why has God forsaken me and when he gave
[30:17] up the ghost he bowed his head his
[30:20] spirit rang and preached to the souls
[30:24] that were in prison that repented not in
[30:28] the long-suffering of the days of Noah
[30:31] down here
[30:34] thank you brother
[30:40] amen
[30:43] thanks we are talking about a real place
[30:48] what I'm trying to get you to see that
[30:51] this is not some mythical creation of a
[30:53] mythical imagination this is real when
[30:59] you are going through something a lot of
[31:02] times you can you can be going along
[31:06] it's a daily task and there is always
[31:08] the pole always of pull trying to get
[31:15] you to influence you from this region
[31:22] constantly if he can't do it through you
[31:26] he will do it through somebody close to
[31:29] you editor is always an influence from
[31:34] this region how because people Legion
[31:39] this land had was possessed by demons
[31:45] he lives out alone he believes there
[31:49] were two thousand demons we asked the
[31:52] question how does a man get possessed
[31:57] with two thousand demons prophets
[32:02] brought it up said you want to know how
[32:04] because he come to church any backslash
[32:09] they come back any backslash every time
[32:14] you do that you are adding demons and
[32:19] spirits to their person every time and
[32:25] then once you open that door and you
[32:30] yield yourself to that spirit it's not
[32:33] that the spirit becomes a stronghold
[32:38] becomes a stronghold
[32:40] you are then demon possessed demon
[32:48] possessed now we all possess my Sultan
[32:54] because here's the same way we possess
[32:56] from this region - and that's called a
[33:00] Holy Ghost in here in this flesh in this
[33:06] house a flesh that has to die it is an
[33:16] empty house that is going to be
[33:18] inhabited by one of the other if they
[33:22] found this house empty come Birds we
[33:27] gotta get the house you have to have
[33:30] that house full from this region to keep
[33:34] these boys I think he found an empty
[33:38] house you got a man Lord and a go yeah
[33:43] because what happened you are demon
[33:45] possessed
[33:46] hell no now when we I was talking to us
[33:54] about earlier today when we get to a
[33:57] point and we leave this world we cross
[34:02] this line the dividing line between
[34:07] mortal and immortality when our time
[34:11] here is done
[34:14] there is only one you can't take your
[34:19] belongings with you
[34:21] they stay here you can't take your car
[34:26] you can't take your house you can't take
[34:30] your lane you can't take your money
[34:33] the only thing goes with you is your
[34:37] character now whatever your character is
[34:45] influenced by whether your character's
[34:48] influence from available or your chapter
[34:53] is influenced from the load for the tale
[34:55] where you go it's a real place my
[35:01] brothers and sisters it's not some
[35:05] million million light years away it's
[35:09] right there you just change speeds as
[35:15] you rather get revelation as you give
[35:21] yourself to the Holy Spirit you you
[35:27] speed up now your body your motor body
[35:31] another speed up but you move into a
[35:34] dimension you are seated with him in
[35:37] heavenly places and what happened one
[35:40] day is your your spirit of speed up to a
[35:46] place in heavenly places so it is moving
[35:49] at the same speed and then in this room
[35:53] that your celestial body is moving and
[35:57] when you match speed for speed what
[36:00] happened you do like enough you still
[36:04] right over you can't as long as you're
[36:10] not moving at the same speed but once
[36:15] you get to a place where else fees match
[36:19] up that's perfectly you will be changed
[36:24] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[36:29] into another dimension
[36:33] not some rocket ship Superman just still
[36:43] a man we gonna do some reading amen give
[36:51] you some clarity from the Prophet he
[36:55] says here in demonology here is a
[37:00] channel right here
[37:02] I don't tell you this before people he
[37:05] says I got a lot of Secrets in my own
[37:08] life of course between God and I but
[37:12] lookie here
[37:12] there is a channel like this that where
[37:17] mortars live in in it is a
[37:22] conglomeration of gaiety blackness and
[37:27] sin even though we're here in this Lady
[37:36] of seeing age this is what it looks like
[37:40] see every once in a while you see a
[37:48] little white spot okay a little white
[37:53] spot that light is or a little white
[38:01] spot or a light jesus said you are the
[38:05] light that sets on a heel don't light a
[38:10] candle and put it on under a bushel
[38:12] that's Christians in this conglomeration
[38:16] of this dimension of mortals we well
[38:21] going this a weight downward to the next
[38:25] dimension is the souls of the unjust who
[38:29] died not knowing God the second is
[38:34] demons the third is and the third in the
[38:40] Trinity of hell
[38:42] could you see there's a Trinity light
[38:45] matter
[38:46] here and then there's also a Trinity of
[38:49] the underworld okay and let's see the
[38:55] second theme of the Trinity of Hell
[38:56] unjust souls demons inhale there is a
[38:59] Trinity of them that cut into the third
[39:03] that's also a Trinity of them was called
[39:08] into the third heaven first is a ghost -
[39:14] the Holy Ghost the second angels the
[39:19] third heaven itself
[39:22] now these mortals in this dimension here
[39:27] is influenced either from there or from
[39:33] here now what's happened a man to that
[39:37] woman she broke through here in the
[39:41] dimensions talking about the Witch of
[39:42] Endor when she called the spirit of
[39:44] Samuel now the Bible many people fuss
[39:49] about her saying it was an impersonation
[39:51] of Santa we won't go into all of that
[39:53] let's move on now notice now this is
[39:57] business real good notice this here now
[39:58] he said now notice into the germ but God
[40:04] a man thank you no part with me I got to
[40:14] stay dry here I'm sweating crazy hey man
[40:20] what after the germ of life now you're
[40:24] just a teeny tiny germ before it was a
[40:30] germ what's after the germ it's life and
[40:35] you're in the supernatural you're in the
[40:39] sixth dimension you're plumb out of
[40:43] human reasoning you're into spirit life
[40:47] every little germ has a life that life
[40:54] comes from somewhere the life of
[40:58] cancer comes from the devil okay come
[41:04] from up come from the devil now your
[41:13] life comes from God that's the
[41:18] difference and God being manifested in
[41:22] flesh with christ jesus the anointed i
[41:26] just bless me God wrapped himself in a
[41:33] blood sail in the womb of Mary bought
[41:38] forth his life he lived a man he died a
[41:44] man he gave a man to give his blood that
[41:50] through his blood and the shedding of
[41:54] his blood that every believer could wrap
[41:58] in that blood cell the blood cell of
[42:03] Almighty God which him which is a
[42:07] born-again spirit of a man is wrapped in
[42:12] the blood cell of the Son of God and God
[42:17] can no more deny you than he could deny
[42:20] himself by one spirit where we all
[42:24] baptized into one body becoming
[42:27] partakers of the same spirit in the
[42:30] blood cell and the church wrapped into
[42:33] the blood cell of the life of Jesus
[42:36] Christ then we are sons of God joint
[42:39] heirs Jesus Christ in the kingdom you
[42:44] say Oh mother abandoned the devil got me
[42:47] no the devil don't you went out to the
[42:51] devil the devil can't get you you are
[42:57] dead dead people don't argue dead people
[43:00] don't back by you're dead in him your
[43:05] life is here in God through Christ and
[43:09] you're sealed by
[43:11] holy ghost how can the devil get you he
[43:16] can't do it that's right you get it now
[43:23] inside at one time by the spirit not by
[43:26] the letter all joined into one body
[43:31] not by denominations nor are we all
[43:37] bought into one body but by the spirit
[43:39] we are all baptized the holy spirit into
[43:43] the body whether you immensities Baptist
[43:46] or Pentecost or whatever you are one
[43:49] spirit and and it has baptized you into
[43:53] the body of believers and he says here
[43:57] now in st. John 5:24 be sure to read it
[44:02] thank think of the handful - I'm sorry
[44:06] talking about a dozen of eggs I don't
[44:07] know way coming like there but I'll get
[44:09] to st. John 24 he says he personal
[44:12] pronoun the individual not a group or
[44:16] whatever he that heareth my word and
[44:20] believe in him that Sydney has present
[44:25] tense ever lasting life and shall not
[44:29] come into condemnation but has passed
[44:33] from death unto life has passed from
[44:40] death unto life amen
[44:50] a man let's see here the devil can whip
[44:54] you around the stumps on that's not the
[44:58] reason I know I got it he says uh how
[45:03] you felt when you got it somebody said I
[45:07] felt good and said that's the reason I
[45:10] know I got it now that's not the reason
[45:13] I know I got it the reason i know i
[45:17] because i met god's condition and the
[45:21] devil cannot on the word its thus
[45:24] saith the lord that's it
[45:27] the promise of god I've met every
[45:30] condition and no I have eternal life the
[45:38] believer does it because he met the
[45:41] conditions in the requirements now we
[45:47] see here God was up here now up here he
[45:55] says God is or what spirit so when he
[46:03] was up here he had to come down to here
[46:09] wrap himself in a John a blood cell
[46:17] place himself in the womb of Mary to
[46:23] become flesh man he stepped down from
[46:29] his throne down through the dimension of
[46:35] Angel down through the dimensions of the
[46:39] Blessed into this realm of moral why to
[46:46] become us who were bound to go here we
[46:52] let those that died in the Lord
[46:55] here I can read it I can read it a man
[47:01] those souls under the altar oh my let's
[47:08] see here bear with me this is good he
[47:13] says let's dramatize it I can see him
[47:16] come down into the first dimension of
[47:19] lost souls brother branham knocks on the
[47:23] pulpit knock at the door open up the
[47:26] door

[48:12] me the earth has testified of me
[48:15] Judas testified of me that's wrong the
[48:20] Roman soldier testified of me the father

[49:04] door

[49:30] was and then they screamed let us out he
[49:35] said why didn't you repent slam went the
[49:40] door down he went into the below four
[49:46] demons through the light of demonology

[50:11] legions a man and and went into the
[50:15] swine and choked themselves they sent
[50:19] they seen the presence of that holy one
[50:21] among them walking walking through there
[50:26] and he had like a bunch of roaches when
[50:29] that light is turned on and in
[50:32] summertime when they there knowing at
[50:36] the Apple Court put me in mind of some
[50:39] preachers that turn the gospel light on
[50:43] they scatter
[50:44] don't go there and hear him put me in
[50:47] the mind of an old bunch of roaches in
[50:50] the summertime in the darkness they can
[50:53] nimbly go but turn the light on
[50:57] that's right all right the next thing he
[51:01] did was come on down through the other
[51:04] Trinity on down into hell and I can just
[51:09] see him go yonder and Satan walks to the
[51:13] door and he finally got there
[51:17] got here did you yes I'm here
[51:20] the devil said you finally got here he
[51:23] said yes I'm here yes I'm here I thought
[51:26] I thought you when I had you when I
[51:30] killed Abel I thought I shot you when I
[51:35] got Abel I was sure that I had you when
[51:41] I threw those through Daniel and the
[51:44] Lions then when I beheaded John I
[51:47] thought I had you when thought I had you
[51:51] well when you were like on the cross I
[51:54] thought I had you but finally you've
[51:56] arrived Jesus said yes I've arrived and
[52:02] I've arrived for one purpose you have
[52:06] put fear and chills over the people long
[52:10] enough I come down to take over that's
[52:13] right oh he said I'm the Virgin born son
[52:17] of God oh I I got it right Adam sinned
[52:22] but my blood still wet on the cross paid
[52:27] that sin yes sir I come down to take
[52:31] over give me the look the keys to death
[52:35] and hail he doesn't give the keys to the
[52:39] kingdom to Peter Peter already had the
[52:42] keys now I want to stop right there and
[52:45] make a point Peter already had the keys
[52:48] and Peter was still influenced from
[52:52] below and he had acted in that same of a
[52:56] chapter there when he gave Peter the
[52:58] king he had to turn right around and
[53:00] rebuked Peter did be behind me Satan he
[53:04] called he said no no no cause he'll
[53:05] capito was influenced from that spirit
[53:09] below when he said no and suffered to be
[53:11] so Peter this has to happen why so that
[53:15] this can happen so that so that that I
[53:18] can be down on the cross my blood can be
[53:23] shared let it be so that the Scriptures
[53:26] be fulfilled Peter was still at that
[53:29] time
[53:29] even though he had the keys to the
[53:31] kingdom was being influenced even though
[53:34] was more than it might have been pure
[53:38] been good but it was off the word a man
[53:44] says I come down to take over it give me
[53:48] the keys of death and hail he said he
[53:51] doesn't already give the keys to Peter
[53:52] the church yes sir he said give me the
[53:56] keys of death and he'll you notice when
[53:59] he rose up he had hangings on
[54:02] he had them hanging on his side give me
[54:06] the keys of death and here reached over
[54:08] reached over and grabbed Satan by the
[54:12] neck and throw him down put his foot on
[54:16] him and reached over and grabbed him off
[54:19] of him
[54:20] you fooled people long enough
[54:23] get back in there where you belong hang
[54:26] them he hung them are on his neck he
[54:31] says I'm the boss now my blood has been
[54:35] shared up there on the cross for the
[54:38] remission of the sin for the sickness
[54:40] you can't keep them any longer there
[54:44] will people there will be people who
[54:48] will believe me
[54:50] you can't bind them with sickness you
[54:53] can't bind them with fear they will
[54:56] believe hallelujah the keys of death and
[54:59] hail
[55:00] here comes climbing up mommy's coming
[55:02] back up she's coming near daylight I can
[55:06] see the big Morning Star looking around
[55:10] and grave and already it's coming on the
[55:14] third day and first wait he's got
[55:18] someone somebody else over here in
[55:22] paradise so he don't forget nobody amen
[55:26] and what a fitting song we sung past
[55:29] minato gentle savior hear my humble cry
[55:31] over here in paradise lay some soul
[55:36] Abraham Isaac Jacob Sarah and
[55:40] those who have faithfully believes the
[55:42] promise of the prophets and they laid
[55:45] there waiting a man
[55:58] amen so let me get myself together here
[56:08] amen
[56:09] so here we see a man that he went down
[56:12] he came down from this dimension a man
[56:16] it's not a place it was just a
[56:18] transference of dimension when he put on
[56:21] that blood sir came down here died on
[56:23] the cross went down into hell took the
[56:26] keys and then came up here a man now the
[56:30] souls are waiting in this holding place
[56:33] and then we'll all go together amen
[56:36] the Prophet said where that wasn't one
[56:39] day these our bodies a resurrect and
[56:46] meet up with our celestial bodies and
[56:49] put on a glorified body and when this
[56:54] has all been redeemed and we'll all live
[56:58] here together amen amen
[57:02] so I just want to want to bring now
[57:06] there's a couple of more things that I
[57:07] want to read I don't want to get too
[57:09] ahead of myself I'm not going to be able
[57:13] to get to there's another section that I
[57:19] are that that I have and I probably
[57:22] eight be able to get to it another time
[57:26] to show that how I was talking about the
[57:30] wiles of the devil and show how the in
[57:34] in that realm of science in this fourth
[57:39] room in this realm of science how Satan
[57:43] today is really bombarding we see so
[57:48] much happening in this generation with
[57:51] our I can't even say with our young
[57:53] people but he is really severely
[57:57] attacking our young people he's
[58:01] attacking the bride of Jesus he's really
[58:05] doing a work on us in why because we
[58:08] have
[58:09] come this as a people we've come so
[58:13] comfortable and we've reached in into
[58:19] the tree of knowledge and good and evil
[58:23] and will constantly pull them out of
[58:25] this dimension and bringing it over into
[58:28] here and what we don't realize is we're
[58:32] desperate
[58:33] those are influences from here and
[58:36] that's how they're being introduced into
[58:38] this room you wonder why we see kids
[58:42] shooting up and schools and distant in
[58:45] the other let me give you it's another
[58:49] place here that I want to read where and
[58:52] I just have to paraphrase it my notes
[58:55] are all over the place but where the
[58:58] Prophet said he he as a prophet a
[59:04] prophet is a seer he said he lives most
[59:11] of the time in this dimension
[59:14] that's how he's able to see what he sees
[59:20] that's how he's able to he lives in this
[59:23] dimension he said in one place those he
[59:27] said those spirits come up from beneath
[59:30] and they speak one to another he said he
[59:35] was pre-emphasis if you can only if
[59:36] you're sick if you can only get out of
[59:40] this room up into this room this is
[59:45] where your healing takes place but when
[59:49] we come to church a lot of times let me
[59:52] let me back up as Lord honest it is we
[59:55] realized that there are voices through
[59:58] the radio waves here through science in
[1:00:01] this dimension he said they're passing
[1:00:05] through this building right now a lot of
[1:00:08] times we come to church and you ever
[1:00:10] just seem like you just can't focus in
[1:00:13] on the Word of God Wow
[1:00:14] because you're still here in your flesh
[1:00:17] he said you have to get to a point where
[1:00:21] you get
[1:00:22] out of your flesh and you elevate into
[1:00:25] this room and then you hear from heaven
[1:00:30] he said so many times we come and we sit
[1:00:34] with our arms full he says what's
[1:00:37] happening in your mind those voices you
[1:00:41] probably you probably hear them right
[1:00:43] now probably sitting there talking about
[1:00:45] oh yeah something things are always
[1:00:48] coming to your mind the mind is the
[1:00:50] battlefield did I leave that part oh man
[1:00:53] I forgot to get gas
[1:00:55] before I came to church oh I wonder what
[1:01:00] I'm gonna do at work tomorrow he could
[1:01:03] hit a Word of God going forth and all of
[1:01:05] these things these thoughts are running
[1:01:06] through your mind that's him trying to
[1:01:09] keep you grounded keep you grounded here
[1:01:14] that you don't get here to receive from
[1:01:18] God you have to press your way you have
[1:01:24] to press your way out of this realm of
[1:01:27] flesh into this room of how did he call
[1:01:34] it he said into this channel where you
[1:01:38] can hear from God where you can receive
[1:01:41] from God in the upper room and acts who
[1:01:44] they said they were all in one Accord
[1:01:46] they were all in one Accord they weren't
[1:01:50] all in this in one place in one Accord
[1:01:54] what happened they had all got into a
[1:01:57] channel they had all got into that
[1:02:01] channel and then came a sound from
[1:02:05] heaven as a mighty rushing wind and I
[1:02:09] believe the night that if we can come to
[1:02:11] church and we can all just get in that
[1:02:16] channel see he said here and I'm not
[1:02:21] mean I'm just talking I ain't gonna read
[1:02:23] it he said that that one person your
[1:02:27] neighbor sitting next to you might be
[1:02:29] struggling but if you can get into that
[1:02:32] room you
[1:02:34] we'll help your neighbor you would chase
[1:02:37] that demon away from your neighbor that
[1:02:40] your neighbor can get into that room and
[1:02:44] vice versa you come in here with all
[1:02:47] these mind battles dragging down the
[1:02:49] service it's just as easy for that
[1:02:51] spirit to get on your neighbor and drag
[1:02:54] them down to that's the truth that's the
[1:03:01] truth so when we come we talked about
[1:03:05] being positionally placed we all have a
[1:03:09] job to do
[1:03:11] the preacher back there before the Lord
[1:03:14] and and and just the studying and then
[1:03:17] trying to bring something to help the
[1:03:19] people village is what God that just
[1:03:21] happens wait but we all have to come and
[1:03:24] put our licks of fire together all in
[1:03:28] one place and in one Accord we'll see
[1:03:33] mighty things done and I miss if we can
[1:03:38] all get out of flesh and get into this
[1:03:43] realm I'm gonna be closing now I just
[1:03:48] want to give you a little teaser I'm not
[1:03:51] going to get all into it because it's
[1:03:55] quite lengthy
[1:04:07] okay
[1:04:10] this is an article from a child
[1:04:14] psychologist and this child psychologist
[1:04:19] D that if you you can actually google it
[1:04:23] it's called the undoing of the families
[1:04:27] and it is it is a wake up call you
[1:04:34] wonder what's going on in society
[1:04:40] technology has mailed itself together
[1:04:47] with psychology that you got two forces
[1:04:53] technology and psychology has come
[1:04:56] together to control the minds of the
[1:04:59] people to literally control the minds of
[1:05:03] your people of all of us it is called
[1:05:11] there is a school at Stanford University
[1:05:14] a clay Civ technology let's see who went
[1:05:20] to that school the co-founder of
