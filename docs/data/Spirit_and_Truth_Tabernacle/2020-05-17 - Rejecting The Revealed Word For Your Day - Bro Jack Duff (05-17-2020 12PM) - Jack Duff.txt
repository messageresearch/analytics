the service a little earlier and also appreciate being here I believe God has more in store for us hey man we're just looking forward to all of that I have just a couple things that I wanted to read and there's a couple cards that we just received on one card and one letter that someone sent here to church and and I was just blessed by so just wanted to share with with the church because it was it was for the church this says dear brother Jack's asterick and all the saints I was enjoying a recording of brother capers when I decided it was time to send a note of appreciation I'm always blessed at a time our congregations fellowship together as well as by your spirit of truth Instagram my prayer is that each and every one of you each should ever want to be a family and congregation are healthy and body and spirit under the care of our precious Lord Jesus know that the rest of the body of Christ is remembering you all in Christian love this is from brother Taylor and sister Suzanne to set a mint over on the west coast they're just thinking about the times that we fellowship together and they just felt impressed in a sphere just to write a little note of encouragement to the church in amen and I wrote him back just to let him know we also appreciate the time of fellowship and Colette got to get up out of here because we want to be able to enjoy one another's presents like that again so a man but we are we certainly thank God for them and there's also another little note that I got from a sister in Georgia says dear brother Jack even Saints was his greetings to you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ my name is Sarah Tucson and I have been listening online via youtube and periscope I have been so blessed by the stand that you all have taken and your middle-of-the-road preaching I've seen extremes in this message that can handle one's walk with Christ there is a sweet spirit that applies with you all it's the Holy Spirit as I pray the Lord continues to bless you all and give you the desires of your heart as you diligently seek Him I am a wife and mother that above all was Christ in my home my husband will then I have two teenage boys and are trying to give them spiritual guidance which ultimately starts with us I want to thank you all for the uplifting and edifying services I am enclosing a love offering to be used for the piano or keyboards that you all are are purchasing a man and mom but the sisters say the scripture here about Jeremiah 17 and we'll just read that Jeremiah 17 verse 7 and 8 and as something to encourage us to strengthen us and we just thank God again for someone thinking of us amen and watch the line and and I just felt impressed to write the letter and then to send a love offer and that's just something that we really really appreciate it from the Tucson family there in Georgia Jeremiah 17 verse 7 and 8 it says blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters and that spreadeth outer rooms by the river and shall not see when he cometh but her leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit and and I tell you I think that is just a very appropriate scripture especially for this season if I you know I can go down a list of what I call the blessings of covet 19 and you know just the way that I've seen the hand of the Lord even you know we were at a certain point in our giving for the piano we just needed just a little bit more to make sure what's purchased and we wouldn't you know pretty much everybody's through through the offers that were given we purchased a piano through the offers that were given not actually taken from our offering but the offers that were given and I was just a little bit away and I come to church and this was in the mail and over the next week a man so we're looking forward to that god is good just one of the blesses a man of coke at 19 but God got so many things that he's doing and and you know and even you know like the scripture say even if it's a drought we still bear fruit I hate that powerful even in the midst of the drought we're still bearing fruit your business is bearing fruit in the midst of a drought right some of us are on our jobs they had to let everybody else go but they kept us for a reason that's because in the midst of a drought we're supposed to bear fruit come on somebody this is this is nothing but the handle alone we certainly think a man just all that he has done and all that he is doing praising let's give the announcements amen at this time and and then we will go forward in the service just we I know we have a birthday coming on Friday sister samaya they may well be celebrating birthday so we wish her another year on this a man thank God also so I know that we have like the government has been releasing people to kind of get back to work and all of those things that were certainly happy that all that is happening and maybe many are wondering when I get back they say we're certainly working on a plan I didn't want to just kind of rush back into things so I want to just just handle things with wisdom we're gonna kind of keep doing what we've been doing but just start seeing some slow changes slow changes and I'll be communicating to you that one one one thing that I'm very happy about is that I know that there's been some saints that actually had to go to the hospital because they felt some symptoms but those that I've known have been tested have all the tests have come back negative amen and I know that whether devil might have tried to buy him somebody with this [Music] you know got reviewed them you know for their sake and and and I'm just believing that uh we're not gonna have any outbreaks and we're gonna just continue to do what we have been doing to prevent that I was talking to some of the mothers of the church this week and like I just want to make sure everything real good y'all come on back in here right because we know we want them all back in service but we want to make sure it's all safe so our love I'll be communicating with you just letting you know what some of our next steps are but we'll start making changes over the next couple of weeks but for now continue to do the virtual service on Wednesday and you can watch it by periscope or via Facebook also no services on Friday for right now we'll let you know when that starts again and Sunday service will continue with our 9 a.m. and 12 p.m. service amen the way we have been for right now as we get more information we'll let you know more information those of you that are joining us online amen you can just continue to do what you have been doing follow us there on periscope or on Facebook for either the services also we have in the church app that's going to be launched during this time the church the app that we have was was hosted by another

got from the Saints from different different places Lourdes encouraged the suit encouraging the ministry God we just appreciate that the words of encouragement that the love offering that's given father for what we were trying to do with the keyboard and God you have provided another need in this church in the midst of this time we're flourishing God where some are not able to flourish summer shutting down their doors are closed but God you've allowed us to flourish even now during KOCO at 19 and we're grateful father for your promises that have been given to us thank you for your saints that have been able to continue to give you've been able to give them work and Lord bless their businesses bless their jobs you've done so much they've been able to continue to give and Lord as they give the work of the Lord continues to go forward so Lord we pray to your blessings upon our giving and that you would continue to rebuke the Devourer for our sake as you said in your word and God we're under expectation and thank you in advance for the new church in the new school that you'll bless us with we're believing you for that so that we prayed it to it use this for the furthest or your kingdom and you get all the glory all the honor and all the priests from our giving today since Jesus name we pray amen amen amen thank you sister Rachel it meant I certainly appreciate the musicians the the sister Rachel and sister Rebecca have been switching on and off each week and just carrying a service and we thank God for them doing so god is good god is real good I do I didn't get the card but brother Jerry it told me how precious brother was going to be coming to visit god bless you good to have you with us amen on today praise the Lord Amen this this this morning family Amen that had come this morning and the whole family the first few weeks ago brother Diggs received just a husband and wife came and brother Leo and sister Tatyana a man and this dis this morn they brought their children the three kids to sons and a daughter I believe and and when they came the daughter had already been watching the services online she said she could feel the Spirit of God you know just just watch their life so she wanted to come this morning and she came and and she said I felt the presence of here again this morning and and one of the questions that our son had in his mind and he told his momma you know something that he had in his mind and right come right into the service and brother quake KU preached what he told his mama and I mean so the momma said I just felt that that was a confirmation I think we need to make this our church home so I thank God for that it's not many churches that are growing doing covet 19 they actually losing members but it is why I say that Scripture is very appropriate that the sister sent us right you know in a time of a drought here we're still yielding fruit god is good I have to get a sermon developed on the blessings of coke at 19 i'ma have to develop that you know but I just I just seek God and everything that that's happened I see God and and I know he's at work and you know he just seems just moving in a mighty way and and we just we just want to give him all the glory and all the honor and all the praise praise the Lord let us a man stand to our feet we will read a scripture a man and and I just accent you or just pray for us today I want to kind of go back into our thought on rejecting the revealed word and your day this is part two of that sermon there's a lot that can be said and I just want the Lord just to say what he won't see a man today so I want to read here from first Kings 19 and first Kings 19 and I'll just start reading verse eight and we'll go from there praise the Lord man the Bible says and he arose and did eat and drink and drink and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the Mount of God and it came did their unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of Lord came to him and he said unto Him what doest thou here Elijah a man what doest out here and he said I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts for the children of Israel half a sink in that covenant thrown down thine altars and slain that prophets with the sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it away so here is a prophet of God running from you know a situation that has just occurred and he's on the run now that just that just don't seem don't seem right for some reason prophet of God we're thus sayeth the Lord running think about that right think about that and and and and and I think one of the things that we need to get from this because the scripture tells that Elijah was a man of light passions right so there are times in our life where we don't stand up and we don't speak the word we don't drive out some Devils but it might be some other times we take off running hello somebody amen and the reason that you need to know that that that happens is because the only time you speak the word is when the anointing is on you man it's the anointing that destroys the youth you don't do nothing in yourself you are coward man we all coward scaredy-cats without the anointing with nothing praise the Lord Amen hallelujah we depend on that anointed so so it says it says that he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord and behold the Lord passed by and great and strong wind rent the mountains and break in pieces the rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake a fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice and it was so when Elijah I heard it they D rapped his face in his mantle went out stood in the entering of the cave and behold there came a voice of him saying what doest thou here Elijah and he said I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts behold because the children of Israel have forsaken my covenant thrown down mine altars and sling my prophets with a sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it away and and the Lord said unto him go return on my way to the wilderness of Damascus now I think that that's very important especially the quote that we read to set this up God called his prophet to the wilderness right and I was I didn't get that last time but God called his prophet to the wilderness oh my let's just watch some of some of these things here oh god help us a man a man you know unless he said and the Lord said unto Him go return on our way to the wielders of damascus and and when thou come and said no it has he able to be king of Assyria and jehu the son of nimshi showed allan order to be king of israel and elisha the son of shaphat of abel my whole shutdown ought to be profit in that and it shall come to pass him that escape of the sward of has he L shall Jehu slaying him that escape pyth from the sword of Jehu shall Elijah's late yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel all the knees which have not bowed unto Bale in every mouth which have not kissed him some people don't want to kiss the devil praise the Lord thank God you got folk that ain't got them type of desires that want to kiss the devil my god all right let's pray father we thank you for the word of the Lord that has been read as we go a little deeper in our thought today we pray the Holy Spirit with take control of this time of the service be glorified and magnified in our myths speak to every heart not just those that are sitting president but those that are joining online bless us Lord as we endeavor to take upon this stone in Jesus name we pray amen play man you can be seated in the presence of Lord a man again we're looking at rejecting the revealed word for your day in your day this is part two as we talked about this and this is this is important to me I'm not but the title is not rejecting the word right there there's a lot of people that you know they don't want nothing to do with God or something like that I was talking to a man yesterday how he was just saying he he told some folk one time he I don't want to talk about Jesus I don't want I don't don't even talk to me about that I'm I'm not even interested in that but as God began to do with his heart over time he became converted you know and and we thank God for testimonies of that nature but but we're talking about the reveal word in your day and and and I want to be very clear you know that everybody that comes to the earth everybody is born for a certain time of a certain season God brings us here and we're all just like like where the quake was tell us we're all eternal thoughts of God that were in God's mind we were just as real in his mind as we are sitting here right now today and you know and he was saying how you know we are we brothers you know and they say you know you get married to one wife you stay married to that one wife you say now back in Davis Day you could have had five hundred wives so back in Solomon's that you could have had a thousand wives as long as you could take care of them say but we're not living in that day on them anymore so if you had a spirit like that you should have been born back then praise the Lord so since I mean so if you got that spirit I pray that God will deliver you from it because he wants you to stay married to the one that you got and be faithful to the one that you got praise the Lord Amen faithful to your vow alrighty man but but you know in every day and every time every generation has had an opportunity to receive the word for their day from the days of Adam they had the opportunity to receive the reveal word for their day hallelujah Amen so you know when we started off and just kind of showing how the the first scene was actually unbelief or or rejecting the revealed Word of God the Word of God said don't eat from this tree that was it was not a mystery and man it wasn't something so deep and so mysterious that you know that they each can understand it it was very clear don't do this amen and if you want if you want to live eternal if you want to have life don't do this sister then they only had one commandment if I could put it that way one commandment the key and he couldn't keep it a man Eve can keep it not only not only could she she could she could keep it by where she put took of this fruit then she introduced Adam to to this act my god my god she introduced Adam to the action when Adam amen the Bible says that he will believe did it amen not deceived Eve was too steep but Adam was not to see Adam out of wibbly dinners because he knew that God was gonna destroy she was gonna die wishy for took that so look if you're gonna die I love you that much that I'm gonna die right alongside you hallelujah that's the way Adam works that's the it was really just an expression of God that was actually coming out of Adam at the time of the fall hallelujah because God knew himself that he would leave his throne in glory and coming down across my people that he knew had no chance of living oh thank you Jesus we thank God for this but when we look at this they had the opportunity they receive the revealed truth for their data revealed word for the day but they made a decision they made a choice where they walked away from that even King was given an opportunity to walk in the revealed truth for his day God came to Cain himself think about that there's many people that would love to hear the voice of God just one time in their life I mean often times you know we hear God's voice through other people we hear God's voice through other things maybe listening to the radio and somebody say something on the radio you just heard divorce that God it speaks to your situation coming to church a preacher preaches something and when the preacher says some it just speaks usage which you hear the voice of God but in this particular circumstance God came himself and talked to Cain gave him the revealed truth for that day offered me this type of sacrifice Cain rejected it now you know I made a comment the spirit to reject the reveal word pass from Eve to her son King hallelujah because Cain was not Adam sir but Cain was Eve son that's why the Bible records that Eve was the mother of all living but it did not say that Adam was the father of all living Cain came from a different experience it was experienced with the sir who did walk on two feet at that time but he's been cursed since that event and now he's on his belly hallelujah glory to God but here you know I was looking at this the spirit to reject the revealed Word pass from Eve to her son Cain and and we see it clearly amen and Cain rejected the word as God came to him and said look you know if you just give me the same sacrifice that your brother Abel has given me I will accept it but if the problem was it just was not in Cain to do it I want to tell you something there are some people that you're going to be working with and working with and working with and it just might end them to accept this truth oh all right all right all right all right you got to know who you're working with and sometime when you're working with a spirit a man I don't care how much you explain and I'm gonna tell you another thing about a spirit a spirit is not even impressed by the supernatural by spirit I'm a share with you I we read the scripture of Elijah being in a cave what do is out here Elijah the reason he lives is in this cave is because a few I mean a chapter before allowed to just call down fire from heaven destroyed amen mother mother I mean here God come down and consume the altar but then a lie to destroy them false prophets hallelujah now the people are greed that's a god that answers by fire we don't let him be God they agreed to it but here after this Brady bear yeah he had was there and he's so fire come down to consume the altar then he sorry logic take them down there and sling every one of them give this false teaching out of Amen from amongst the people he stopped these prophets by himself but he late half went home and he told his wife Jezebel what just happened and you know what happened Jezebel say you know what by this time tomorrow I'm my half he lied his head and so he went from being totally anointed and slaying foe hundred or something like that all these prophets are running from one woman think about that and didn't even try to stand up to it took off running ended up in a cave but but here's what we find out that mighty move of the Spirit the supernatural come down that people still did not change Oh hallelujah I want you to understand that it's got to be more than a supernatural that get people's attention today there's got to be something on the inside that can identify with God they had to come from God and got to be going back to God that's why I say look how when we look over church we're not just looking for any church I'm looking for people that came from God and only way back to God Oh hallelujah a man a man I don't want to just settle in any Church amen people that know who they are in Christ that's who I want to fellowship with amen so now you know let's look at a couple things here I want to just take a little time and and read a little bit I brought I brought out this point the spirit to reject the revealed Word past from Eve to her son Cain and we see it clearly in Cain rejecting the word but I want to bring in another script if I can because that spirit to reject the word people of every age gets an opportunity to receive the word now talk about a man Noah's day they had an opportunity to receive the reveal word right and Moses day applying the blood they had the opportunity to receive the reveal word in John the Baptist day they had the opportunity amen to receive the revealed word as was coming through John the Baptist in Paul's day they had the opportunity to receive to receive the reviewer an Iranian and Martin and Columbo Luther Wesley all the way down to this day people have the opportunity to receive the reveal word as is coming through the person that God selected to reveal it through now look at this look at this we want to kind of go back to the days of Jesus because they rejected the word and Jesus thing now I want to I want to read a quote here praise the Lord actually I want to read a scripture let's go to Matthew 27 Matthew 27 now this verse that the verses that I'm reading brother branham you know in the 70 weeks of Daniel he he refers to this this portion of Scripture as a most vital sin from the children of Israel this was a very vital sin that they committed here when they rejected the word glory to God this was very vital glory hallelujah my a man there's much that could be sent there because you would think that it was so vital that they wouldn't have an opportunity to come back around and accept truth but you know actually they're there their eyes were closed intentionally by God so that we could actually accept truth ain't man Laurie to God but I want to tell you that you know at the same way the gospel begin to move away from the the children of Israel and now it's come to the Gentiles well there's all gonna be another switch where it's gonna move from the Gentiles and then go right back to the Jews and they're gonna recognize who Christ is and I want to tell you that we're living in that time right now right now right now now look at this Matthew 27 let's start at verse of 15 praise the Lord this was a very vital move in Israel's history a man they were rejecting the reveal worked for their day now now the feast the governor was want to release unto the people a prisoner whom they would and they had then a notable prisoner called Barabbas therefore when they were gathered together Pilate said unto them whom will you that I release them to you Barabbas or Jesus which is called Christ a man and and now I was told this that you know Barabbas other name his full name was Jesus Barabbas right Jesus Barabbas and Jesus the Christ amen so when they select Jesus Barabbas they actually chose the wrong Jesus they took the wrong Jesus amen and I want to tell you that there's many in denominational churches today taking the wrong Jesus Oh glory to God a man you got to be able to see that he's the same yesterday today and forever don't take the Jesus of history take the Jesus that's living improving himself even right now hallelujah amen look at this he says verse 18 for he knew that for envy they had delivered him glory and it goes on says when he was sat down on the judgment seat his wife sent unto him saying have thou nothing to do with that just man for I had stuff of many things this day in a dream because of him now here God have to use the leaders why to give her dream and try to warn him and he's not even coming to these people he's coming to the Jews and they're rejecting him now look it goes so say by the chief priests amen and eldest butts weighted the multitude that they should ask Barabbas and destroy Jesus oh god I told you it comes from the church a man it comes from the pulpit the deception comes from the pulpit what says the governor answered and said unto them whether of the tween will you will you that I release them to you they said Barabbas Pilate said unto them what shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ they all say it to him let him be crucified now it goes on and the governor set of Why What evil hath he done but they cried out the more saying let him be crucified when Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but that River till tomorrow was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying I'm innocent of the blood of this just person see to it then answered all the people and said his blood be on us and on our children now brother Branham tells us that you know this was a prophecy that they kind of brought upon themselves and from that time when they made that Proclamation they meant all the way down to even today where the Jewish people I mean people come against them for no reason at all but it's because of their rejection of Christ that they rejected the revealed word for their day and it produced problems if I could put it this way a plague setting in a plague setting in a play death set in even from what happened with the Holocaust amen and all I ever play is let his blood be on us and upon our children but there's coming today where he will reveal himself to his people again glory to God now why why did the people get to a spot like this why what brought them to this place where you know they wanna they wanna kill or crucify the word but what is it what does this people you know even even to this day oh you know I recently I'm just reading a little article amen and the fellow was just talking about how certain things go on in message churches and and he took this big took some information - you know a news article in the news news people say y'all need to watch them people that follow William branham's teaching now - stuff that is right in the article we don't support that we don't agree with that if somebody commits in amen that sin need to be dealt with praise the Lord we don't we just don't promote seeing around here Amen but somebody got into a little something and it made maybe it was abuse or something like that and they say how the preacher was a promoting he said nah we don't promote that around here amen glory to God you know I found is that a lot of people that have turned from the messages because somewhere somehow they were hurt they were hurt by something amen and through that hurt they were not able to overcome it so they begin to turn and they say the message is wrong because of some hurt amen hey maybe your daddy treated your wrong that don't mean the message wrong maybe your mama treated you wrong that don't mean the message wrong hallelujah maybe even your pastor treated you wrong that don't mean the message is wrong how you got to be able to overcome those that even jesus said in this world we will have offenses glory to God but you know these people amen it wasn't it really was the people the people were blessed but they were under the influence of the leadership of that day the leadership have been hurt can I put it that way the leadership of that day what's hurt where did they get hurt where did they get hurt let's look at this Pharisees and Sadducees they got hurt let's look at a couple scriptures or y'all just bear with me here oh my let's go to John 8 and man John 8 hallelujah these people were hurt lower to God and through this hurt they just had this ministry to go against the reveal word for that day they they were hurt I mean man something rubbed them the wrong way glory to God and and and then I ain't gonna sit down and take it like that praise the Lord that this is what this is what's really underneath this now now watch this I mean if I went back to even Jezebel she was hurt how preachers were dead now don't forget she had already been killing the other prophets God's prophets now our hope bricks is dead she came take it I'm gonna get I'm gonna get Elijah but God had a calling larger into the wilderness Lord if I can just get around to that I pray God I helped me to get around oh my mind lord help me I mean let me go with look let's look at this hurt here for a second Johnny that let's look at verse 36 and it says this if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed I know that ye are Abraham's seat but you seem to kill me because my word has no place in you oh man look at this since I speak that which I have seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your father now let's watch this let's watch this real close amen it says they answered and said unto him Abraham is our Father jesus said unto them anywhere Abraham's children ye would do the works of Abraham O Lord Jesus god help us you would do the works of Abraham amen verse 40 but now you seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham he says you do the deeds of your father now see this this is with them because they can they can trace the genealogies they can trace the lineages they know that Abraham was their father but watch but Jesus speaks to these men I say out of hurt Oh glory to God out of hurt they begin to put persuade and dissuade the people to turn on Christ I never heard people begin to turn against the revealed word for then think it's out of hurt that we do this what God wants to heal everywhere hurt Oh God can God can heal it look at this look at this let's keep going since ye do the deeds of your father then said they to him we were not born of fornication now they tryna you know nothing another late night night night and now they talk about Jesus birth right I mean we weren't born like he was born we can trace our lineage and this story that you don't come up with you know that a virgin shall conceive we still waiting on that to be manifested they couldn't see that it was already manifested in the man Christ Jesus hallelujah they couldn't see that was medicine we be not born of fornication look at it look at it Amen we have one father even God it goes on and said jesus said in him if God were your father hallelujah see I believe the miracles that he performed gave him the ability to have a voice in the midst of this congregation hallelujah it was the supernatural that actually gave him a voice it's the supernatural today that would give us a voice to speak what we're speaking all right stay with me Church look at this he says yes Jesus amen if God were your father he will love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came out of myself but he sent me why do not understand my speech look at this even because you cannot hear my words ye are your father now you kept seven know you know get your father's a little different from my father now look at what it say in any night because I'm claiming that I'm coming from God you say you coming from a man you said oh but ye are of your father the devil I like that statement because the spirit to reject the revealed Word pass from Eve to us son King we saw it clearly in Kay rejecting word but now the spirit that was in King to reject the revealed Word of God was also found in the religious leaders during the days of Jesus so if it was found amongst the religious leaders in the days of Jesus where you think is gonna be found today hallelujah we on the trail of a devil praise God and this down we'll get started through hurt Oh search I hope you with me if you talk to people long enough you'll find out there was some hot damn a man we don't see these signs of seasoned and Pharisees man with long robes and for lack Theresa and they were respected amongst the people but now you've got somebody coming and calling back not only that telling you of your father the devil look at that you have your father - devil and the end and the lusts of your father ye will do and he was a he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it your lives your dad is a liar Oh - hurt somebody man I can prove my lineage and you tell me I come from the devil well watch your your actions prove who your daddy is because it was the religious leaders that came up apply tell that tell the governor you want Barabbas but crucify tell Jesus it showed it showed that they came from their father the devil how did they get there to hurt how people come to a spot of rejecting the word today her hallelujah and and that's that's the thing that's why I'm bringing out the children of Israel here in this and this was a vital thing that they did but the grace of God is going right back to them this is just like if I could put it this way like a play that's being played out but it's the grace of God has gone right back to them to get them so there are some people I believe today that's been hurt that God's still gonna go right back around and bring him right back in I say the mysterious hands of Jehovah well untie the knots and it'll settle people's spirit glory I'm gonna tell you some if that's what it's gonna take it's a supernatural not gonna settle them because I've heard people say I remember I remember you know some people said man ain't no supernatural things happening in the message none none none and then a they was leaving over that and then God gave us powerful demonstration of the supernatural when we saw the picture in sister Tonya's head of this growth a picture before and after here the picture in a hat showed the growth and then right after I mean after the prayer going to brother Nathan's Church up there and and a new Alvin E and we had Church and just prayed a simple prayer went came back home on an airplane get ready to go for a surgery all the twos that we come on Monday she going for surgery on a Tuesday and when she wake up it's not there don't even and took a picture before and after that was God's supernatural hand touching her before the doctor could touch her and we begin to share the testimony did it stop the people from going to do what they were doing they were complaining it was no supernatural their God did the supernatural and it still didn't turn around oh it's just like what happened with Elijah just like what happened in Elijah's day but I believe God is able to turn them back around I believe that it's gonna take more than that we don't have to have a identification of who we are in Christ now let me uh let me just read a little something here if I can oh my goodness hurt did this hurt hurt hurt that's a--that's a-- let's not read from this message the god of this evil age the god of this evil age let's read from there praise God oh thank you lord a man says now we see that the church refused to accept God's Word to rule over them and accept it Barabbas instead now if you want the scripture on that it's Matthew 27 15 to 23 what did this do what position did this do now think of it when the church world in its organized life of righteous holy men as they thought they were and we're in the eyes of the people they crucified Jesus and saying will not have this man rule over us it says will not have this word of God to rule over us and if I could just inject that will leave that quote there for a second there's many people the reason they actually leave the message because they don't want the word to rule over them they call themselves actually having freedom you can't get liberated from the gospel hallelujah amen amen the gospel it's the gospel itself that actually gives you freedom but to turn and walk away from the gospel and reject become of God that's not liberation that's bondage praise God it's only when you come to know Jesus that's your no freedom ye shall know that truth and the truth will make you free look at this glory since says I wouldn't I have this man rule rule of us and Jesus was the fullness of the Word of God first John 1 expresses it and they said we're blinded to what he wants I'm sorry and they said wouldn't I have this Word of God rule over us yet he was the word but their eyes were blinded to what he was for he was the direct answer to every prophecy that was to come to pass in him now we all believe that because we're looking back to see it happen but if the world would that is now this present evil age that would have been back there at that time they would do the same thing they're doing today because it's still the same word for this age being manifested so so really you know we can look at the history of Scripture we'll say man I would have been standing up for Jesus I would have been I bet I would have been on his side but you know your actions today actually demonstrate what you would have done even in that day if you rejected it for this day you were to reject it it back then you had been right with the crowd yeah crucified even even Pilate yelling now what has he done they couldn't a man that was not even said to Pilate his he came to his own they rejected him his own received him not I mean here to hear that the gospel was been brought to the Gentiles through a prophet in this day came to his own they rejected him hallelujah God called them off the scene let's look at this let's look at this it says he'll do it they can do nothing else they are children of disobedience give it a strong deliver delusion to believe a lie and be damned by now let's keep going notice when the church world would not accept Jesus the word manifested of that day because why they had it interpreted another way but they ought to have note that he was the word because everything that God said he would do he did it and he said to them search the Scriptures for this hour and if I do not meet the qualifications that was spoke for me to do then don't believe me they said we believe Moses he says if you would have believed Moses you would have believed me can I just borrow the words of Jesus and bring it right back to the day if you really believed Moses you would have believed brother Branham oh come on somebody if you really believe John the Baptist you want to believe brother Branham if you believe Daniel you want to believe brother pram if you believe I see you and Jeremiah and all the prophets of the Old Testament you want to believe God sitting you William Marion Branham hallelujah glory to God amen Church we were in a vision this is a year of vision and as I'm trying to bring out certain quotes so we can see where we stand you know glory to God don't don't reject the word in this thing you the word that God sent you let me just finish this quote the word that God sent you you can search it in scripture you can search the description I don't believe this message just because I found it in scripture hallelujah Malachi 4 speaks about a revelation 10 speaks about it st. 1:17 speaks about a revelation 3 speaks about it's all over the scripture amen look at this look at this he said if you if you wouldn't believe Moses you want to believe me for Moses spoke of me and still they didn't see it oh yeah and I can tell you Moses spoke of brother branham's ministry Moses say the Lord your God raised a prophet like unto me yes that applied to Jesus yes but scripture has compound dual meanings glory to God and you were to believe Moses you would have believed William Marion Brandon oh let me go on a little further it says the very God of heaven died on the cross I'm sorry sir and he said if you were to believe Moses you would have believed me for Moses spoke of me and they still didn't see the very God of heaven died on the cross and staying the same words the Prophet said he was saying and still they didn't see it see they were not of his kind this is important they were not of his kind they were not the word so so when we talk about of his kind we're not talking about a we're not talking about a particular race or ethnic background hallelujah we've gone beyond your ethnic background here at Spirit of Truth Tabernacle glory to God we passed that I mean other church is going to stop at your ethnicity remember we want to go we want to go past your ethnicity we want to see amen can you identify with this the operative that the brother was talking about this morning we're just be I mean if you got a theophany had to come from God and it must go back to God so we don't that's what we talk about it's not I mean your age is just the color of our skin it's just what God chose to avail he made his sign in but then God never do it who we are the reason that we can fellowship with one another and not have no isms amongst us it's because we know where we come from they were not of his kind they were not the word you have to have a word body a theophany there was not the word not the word and they and they yet they were very religious but they was not the word it would have recognized its place but at our if they were the word they would have recognized their place for the hour can I put it this way if you are the word today then you're gonna recognize your place for the hour in which you live glory to God man II was upset with Jesus they rejected them I got another scripture I want to just give you here John six this is another one where where they really just got upset this is another another thing by just I can't I can't read all this but I'll I love I'll just share this with you and this in this group in this scripture there's three three types of believers the make believer the unbeliever the true believer and and in this group Jesus makes a statement that just really just just mess the Pharisees and Sadducees up he made a statement in John 6 51 you know cuz they would talk about how they fathers ate bread in the wilderness and here Jesus was the one providing the Brent for them to eat in the wilderness and and he said our fathers ate bread and they did this and Jesus come along and he give him something that just hurt their feelings he says I am The Living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread oh good God Almighty if I can just just just bring it now you just can't go eating what the what does a nomination alert is of teaching you got to eat this bread come on somebody Oh hallelujah Jesus one worry about me feelings geez don't worry about what you trying to say Jesus you said we can't make it to heaven if we don't eat your bread yes that's what he was trying to say that's exactly you got it you got to eat this bread I am The Living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever amen in the bread that I will give is my flesh which I would give for the life of the world well Jesus spoke words like that now this was just this was a sermon that was never heard before people go to church of the man's you know I noticed man is uh he healing the sick the blind eyes are coming open I mean the death the death of hearing people be erased dad there's something powerful about this man's ministry and now he preaches a sermon that says eat him see the natural mind could not comprehend and because they couldn't comprehend they say this is hard say what I'm saying I say I told y'all this man was off look at he's a he's a cannibal he wants us to eat him something wrong with this fella yeah I tell you what y'all better leave this gal or they begin to persuade the people and they took off one who dis nah we ain't gotta listen to this we don't kill this man before he kill us another group that was actually ordained lord help us Jesus another group of 70 men that was ordained by Jesus can I put it this way the they were ordained in the message and left a message is that Alright cuz that's what happened they were ordained in the message and left the message not only ordained experiences supernatural but the supernatural couldn't keep so you got this you got defeat of his kind you got to beat words right so so so hey there's 70 left they said it so hard to say who can take it and Jesus just watched them walk out shook the hand as they walked outside god bless you thank you for coming the church didn't even call him to invite him to come back again can y'all imagine us I'm talking about Jesus and he said he said he said it didn't got back in church it was 12 people left in the church he just had hundreds got down the twelfth brother branham say his congregation was too big so God had to shake the congregation down got it down to twelve and when he got down to twelve looked at them and say will you also go now what a statement the church just got shut up and you come in and preach with you also go Oh Peter and I can just a moment maybe a half-hour Silas was in the church what we supposed to do - Peter just raised up he always got something to sing whether it's good or bad Peter gonna have something to say Peter roll-ups ain't going nowhere oh you got the words of eternal life and we stand right here now Peter come on the computer couldn't explain eat my flesh and drink my blood Peter can explain it I want to tell y'all something you ain't got to explain to people what you believe Peter couldn't explain it but Peter say I ain't going nowhere I'm standing right here only you got the words of eternal I'm saying look I don't try the Baptist I don't track the Pentecost I don't see what it produced this message has brought to me what I'm looking for I ain't I ain't looking for nothing else glory to God only you got the words we eternal life Jesus a well appreciate that Peter but you know what there still are Devils and I miss I chose y'all 12 and there's still a demo right here in our myths glory to God tonight he trying to figure out of 12 who the devil amen he didn't even reveal it thank God for that I want to just read another little quote here this is out of the harvest time Amen these are things that caused him to reject the word they was just hurt they feelings got hurt by the word they got hurt and and-and-and-and-and if the word is hurting your feelings you got to check yourself the word should hurt you the word should help you all right look at this the harvest time he says this and all these other things he had began to say except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man what do you think a doctor would have thought sitting in there what do you think any man would just common thinking you have to eat my flesh and drink my blood they said this man is a Empire not a minister stay away from that man he is a crazy stay away from him but it was a truth see it was the truth except you eat it you'll perish you you'll all die if you don't eat it that's the same thing today the bread and the wine is only a symbol so when Jesus was saying eat my flesh and drink my blood he was talking in a symbol form the the unconverted mind would have thought he was a vampire something but but but if you had a spiritual reality if you came from God you realize it was something spiritual that was being saying look at it that's the same thing the bread and the wine is only a symbol don't let that natural thing get you down you've got to eat Christ which is the word that you live by every word that proceedeth the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation so when you say eating my flesh and drink my blood he said and I'm the bread of life he was how he has something to sustain the people he said man shall not live by bread alone with you something that sustains but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God what you're supposed to eat is the revealed word in your day if you want to live you're gonna have to eat this revealed word I thank God for this I thank God for this now let's let's let's look at a another little something here this is out of the message divorce of the sign let me see let me see let me see let me see oh thank you Jesus no actually let's let's not go there let me let me go back to our pergamene church age and just kind of read a couple quotes from here this is where we've been getting our thought we have been in this journey of stepping to the vision and just used in different continents from the Angels message to us they told a prophet that picked up your pen and write brother Branham picked up his pen and wrote a message for us and I'm picking up this and just trying to bring it to the church so we can step into this vision that God got for us a man in this year glory God now look at i'ma start here at paragraph yeah that's good it says it says now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb because I promised land is coming in sight even as theirs did now Joshua means Jehovah savior and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church even as Paul came as the original leader Caleb represents those that stayed true with Joshua so that's us he's talking about us now you know weirder Caleb's that stand true with the Joshua that came in this day amen remember God has started Israel as a virgin with this word but they wanted something different so did the last day church notice how God did not move Israel I can tell you one of the things that some people want when they leave the message they want a title any man you never recognized me as this is that is that what it took to keep you the message let's just write this down sheet of paper what title you want well we'll hang it in your car a man will hang it at your house you are you are who you want to be will make you that baby what good is it if man make you that and God has not made you that that's all it is it's a title you ain't no actions to it I mean somebody claimed the beat an apostille you do you realize what an apostille is but they want that title right here Oh bishop apostille you know whatever the title that somebody and I pastas person that establishes churches and then leaves and goes establish another church they moved from city to city state to state country to country establishing churches doc that is a real apostille you ain't starting one church but you want us to call you a pasta not me your identity denominations Dickie that title if that's what you looking for there give it to you hallelujah but when I call you when I talk to you just know what I'm gonna call you brother alright alright let me keep on going I'm Amen brother and sister that's what you are glory to God no one is how God did not move Israel or let her go into the Promised Land until it was his on the point in time now the people might have put pressure on Joshua the leader and said the land is ours let's go and take it Joshua all through you must have lost your commission you don't have the power you used to have do you see here from God and know the will of God an act quickly something that's wrong with you but Joshua was a god-sent prophet and he knew the promises of God so he waited for them this is a problem with a lot of people they just man they they they they ready to move but no no no no no wait you got to wait you got to wait why are you waiting God is forming your character right since he waited for a clear-cut decision from God and when the time came to move God placed a full leadership in Joshua's hand because he had stayed with the word God can trust Joshua but not the others so it will repeat in this day the same problem the same precious take the example we see in Moses this mighty anointed prophet of God had a peculiar birth being born at the right time brother Branham also had a peculiar birth you had a peculiar birth right since being born a man at the right time for the deliverance of Abraham C from Egypt he never stayed in Egypt to argue Scripture with them no fuss at the priest he went to the wilderness until the people were ready to receive him God called Moses to the wilderness the waiting was not on Moses part a man but because the people of the because of the people who were not ready to receive him Moses thought the people to understand but they did not look at this then there's Elijah to whom the word of the Lord came and this is the angel writing this to us - angel telling this to us through a brother branham being the scribe he says then there's Elijah to whom the word of the Lord came when he got through preaching the truth and that group back there that is the forerunner of the American Jezebel would not receive the word God called him off the field and plague that generation for rejecting the prophet and the message that God had given God called him to the wilderness and he would not even he would not come out even for the king those who try to persuade him to do so dot but God spoke to his faithful prophet by vision out of height and he came and brought back the word to Israel now we want to stop there in this because here he got got cause Elijah to the wilderness I need to just show you a couple of things you know you don't move until God actually moves you you know you don't do anything unless God does it Elijah was a major profit the spirit of Elijah's actually being used five times in Scripture in the North Channel that was only larger comes five times it came in Elijah it came on he like show it came on John the Baptist and came on William Branham and it's coming back on Elijah again as a witness to Israel the two witnesses will be Moses and Elijah not Obama does not say Moses and Elijah but the reason and I can say that is because in the Bible it gives their ministries hallelujah when you read about them two witnesses look at the ministries you'll see that those Ministry of Moses and the Ministry of Elijah glory to God that's how we know who it is we got a guest no more look at the ministries is right there in the spiritual now this ministry was was was was was use of God but but this ministry cannot do anything until God told it to do it I want y'all to see some things here scriptures think that I don't even catch before he said God called him to the wilderness and he played that generation because they didn't receive it now what the big thing that happened first Kings 18 is where Elijah has this tremendous God that answers by fire let him be God but you know Elijah was going down there amongst a hab it wasn't really just to calm down fight he was actually going to bring rain back to the people amen because he told them earlier it will be in a rain here till I call forth God gave him a vision to go and comfort her here ain't had my after a mighty demonstration of fire coming down and consuming the altar and now he sees I like to go and they've telling servant go up now go up now go man went up seven times and say I don't see nothing he said but I do see the cloud the size of a man's head he said man you better get ready it's about to rain I don't care how change in your situation [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] get ready for great things said maybe I better get ready is getting rain rain and that's why Elijah was there now they had this mighty demonstration rain coming mighty demonstration of fire falling but their hearts in turn hearts turn turn supernatural all over the place but their hearts and turn and so so they reject it the reveal word for the day plank happened now what we pick up in the rest of the scripture glycan just-just-just I'm first we're at first Kings 19 I'm gonna come back to that maybe not let me just hit that just real quick right now no one is when we read first Kings 19 he launches in this cave running from Jezebel you saying Lord I'm the only one standing ain't nobody understanding all the way God had to encourage this I got 7,000 that ain't bow he said but he said you say when he told the God here we have this great wind shaking the mountain the Bible said God was not in the wind then we had this earthquake and everybody wanna watch the earthquakes but the Bible said God was not even in the earthquake hallelujah and then we had fired not wait that does caught my attention didn't he just have fire in the chapter before but the Bible said God was not in the fire sometimes God is trying to get you to move from with what you had in the past yes God moved like that before but he want to do something different now and if you're not if you're not careful you'll limit got to what he used to do and miss what he's doing right now he was not in the fire he was not in the earthquake he was not in the wind the Bible sales are still small voice and this is where people missing it look and when I father's message that's why I say it's gonna take more than a bear and a bridge and all that I'm not looking at all the things I'm looking at the word that was revealed hallelujah look at this they rejected the word and the profit is called into the wilderness now I read the verse there let's see here in first Kings 19 and let's just let's pick this up again verse 14 and 15 said I've been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts because the children of Israel have forsaken that covenant thrown down that altars and slain that prophets with us with a sward and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it away and the Lord said unto him go return on our way to the wilderness so God is calling a prophet so the wilderness off the scene to the witness of Damascus and when I'm coming so no it has yet to be king of Assyria and he gives them some instructions and in other verses but the the main thing I want you to see God is colors prophet into the wilderness and he's not moving until God actually releases him I want to see some things that happen first kings 20 Israel actually defeats the army of Syria and you know when they defeated Syria it was here the king of Syria was actually given right into Ahab's hands that they have let the man go so there was a prophet that rose up it wasn't Elijah was another prophet another prophet rises up and he says he walks up to him and says smite me man stay here the Prophet no not me I can oh god forbid that I would hit a prophet okay because you didn't hit me you don't get ate up by a lion so I think another fellow standing there watching everything that just happened the Prophet random dem say smite me that fella read well hit the prophet gave him a blanket probably women found the king and said you know look you let this man go and you did this you did that say now that man coming they're gonna take your life prophesy see a plague get ready to strike because when plague strike people start losing their lives right so here the plate so you're not because you let him go he's coming back and he's gonna take you out you gonna die because you let him go tow a have this now another thing that happened after this is the plot to kill nabe off and take his vineyard this was after they rejected the Prophet even they reject the revealed word that was coming through the Prophet here they had a great manifestation of the God the dance of the fire and God answers my fire and not it they rejected and look at what happens to them now they want to take me bounce pinyon and and Jezebel in her skin what kind of woman was that lied and signed letters in and our husband's name and told them you don't need to be crying about this we don't get the raised up some sort of some some vile men what we call minute Belial and had them lie on meatballs and they took the man's vineyard had him kill to take his vineyard lies were told and they took this man's vineyard and Wow while a habits rejoicing God tells the Prophet leave the wilderness and go to meet a half hallelujah let's pick this up I want to read this prophecy a man this is the first Kings 21 verse 19 I believe now start at 17 now god only speaks to his prophet when he speaks to him and sends him out when he wants him to go he calls him to the wilderness then sends him out and then he calls him right back man it takes some training it takes some training to be able to hear the voice guy because there's things that you know that can happen that you want to get involved in oh god I know that's right there's things that happened and I mean that sons of God just wanted to get involved in Kovach 19 I'm talking sons of God that wonders then itís a I spoke to it I did it God and God ain't moving like that hallelujah maybe you can speak to it for your family get that devil off your family but the judgment got the strike God got to get somebody's attention amen glory to God look at this first Kings 21 says and the word of the Lord Elijah the Tishbite saying arise go down the media have king of Israel which is in Samaria behold he is in the vineyard of naboth whether he has got whether he has gone down to possess it and thou shalt speak of them saying thus saith the Lord hast thou kill and also taking possession and thou shalt speak and AM stand thus saith the Lord in the place where dogs licked the blood of me both should a dog lick thy blood even the vine here's a prophecy that's given to this man because of what he just did with Nate ball he couldn't blame it and say that was my wife that did know you rejoice it and you're gonna suffer for what you allowed your wife to do God brought her prophecy again again that now God sends the proper right back off the scene back into the woods don't watch this the next chapter this plague is trying to strike it people gonna lose their lives hey help us to go to battle and and when he's when he wants to go to battle he acts Jehoshaphat to come joining and John so I say you've got any profits around and say yeah we got four hundred of them they all come at me prophesy and the problem is this every one of them tell the exact same prophecy and John's resting now and usually somebody gonna say something a little different but full hundred prophets say the exact same thing something wrong somewhere do you know who God's tip I mean when they said five they said four mcian the answer was there any other prophets he got micaiah can I tell y'all something Elijah was still living he was still living why did he go get he like he knew what was gonna be safe but mkhaya being a god-sent prophet picked up on the same prophecy that he larger gate that ain't have your blood gonna be licked by dogs that's why i mcai come and say look i know all these guys have said this and one guy said look do you just say the same thing we say he's saying i'll say nothing but what the Lord told me to say got down there yeah I'm say uh we want to go to this batter what you think Oh the Lord gonna bless you go on oh yeah say man I told you you want to tell me what God see oh you really want to hear what God gotta say all right it says I tell you what I saw in a vision is that there was some spirits that came before the throne of God a lying spirit say I will go down and get in the mouths of his prophets and make them all prophesy lie and they'll believe the lie and it'll cause your word to come to pass here here and he say he's saying what I see is Israel scan it with no Shepherd hey upset though he was no prophesy evil against me the other 400 said we should go I'm gonna go on out I'm gonna disguise myself in the bat I'm gonna do all this so imma do all that and lo and behold when they got that to the battle they was only looking for the king jehoshaphat was dressed as a king but he started yelling like somebody else he went he was yelling like no King he was yelling like he was a he was afraid and they say well he can't be the King doing all that so they some guy pulled a bull just out of nowhere shot a hat took him back and he died right in the spot where the prophet Elijah told me he's gonna die and the dogs were gonna lick his blood he went back fulfill that see a plague strikes when you reject the word why didn't he call Elijah why why why was it Micaiah there was another prophet in the land see that prophet couldn't even color God did not even send him to Ahab when it's time to go to battle hey Eli didn't come trying to stop it Elijah did not get in God's wait I told you it takes some character to understand to do how to do the will of God Hey I mean Elijah did not get in God's Way when it's time for the Word of God to be fulfilled I tell y'all something as a proud of Jesus Christ we gotta have to learn not to get in God's Way when it's time for his promises to be fulfilled I don't care how much power we got I don't care how much with Norton we got don't get in God's Way when it's time for His Word to be made manifest they saw all these great things but because they rejected the word death begin to settle in many other prophecies begin to be manifested and and and I feel like the same thing is happening today people rejecting the word and we're seeing all kind of stuff settled in but I just believe God is gonna bring us through all this - I believe it's gonna do that let's look at a couple quotes and we'll just bring this to a close a man on today hallelujah be careful about rejected and reveal word in your day your day I think I want to yeah I want to read from what here stare Elijah I'm gonna read paragraph East 17 and then I'm gonna skip down to paragraph 25 a man from what here's dare Elijah look at this it says so what happened it called them together in the God of heaven answer in a supernatural sign to Israel and he was still the God that could answer by fire and he did just what he always did answer prayer kept his word and after all of this still it wasn't sufficient and little Elijah he didn't know what to do so he run to the juniper-tree amen he says I'm glad that there's a juniper tree all God's people needs to go to that juniper tree it's a place where he was so discouraged he didn't know what to do so he ran out to himself and got under the juniper tree many of us feel like going there and today when we see the institution's filled with people of God people of God see the institution's filled with people of God nervous breakdowns tension oh it makes all of us want to run such a juniper tree juniper tree is where you can go and get some strength from God he'll supernaturally you know provide the strength so I told you supernatural came and the people still was not moved by the supernatural the same thing that they you had me to share in this testimony that says one people not be moved they got to have something on the inside greater than the supernatural a man that are called and identify with this word let's look at this in paragraph II - 25 same message he says I'm so glad that there is a juniper tree when we get all war and tore up we can go under that juniper tree and find spiritual vitamins to travel any kind of a trip there he layed woke up feeling a little better and he went 40 days and 40 nights I'd imagine if there's a doctor listening in wouldn't you like to know what kind of a vitamin he used that'll keep a man or corn cake and and keep a man on a corn cake and a glass of water for 40 days and 40 nights that's the power of our God then he finds the cave way back in the wilderness and the first thing you know God found him back in there and he called to him and there went a Russian wind through the through through that tour of the mountain The Rock's written fell down a larger just set and listened and there came a shaking an earthquake that shook the mountain but he lied to just set still and then come the fire fail lightning flash and Elijah said steal but then a still small voice spoke give me Elijah answer he wrapped his mantle over his face and walked out I just wondered that if we haven't listened to much to Russian mighty winds and fire and blood and everything else and have failed to hear that still small voice wonder if we've looked so much two gifts that we can't see the giver you know America is prone for noise that's the reason rock and roll is so popular and all those other lots of noises now we've had Russian mighty winds we've had great shake ins but where has God been and all of it Eli just said he was not in it what did we do with the Russian winds what have we done with all kinds of sensations where has it got us denominated so tight that one hat won't give fellowship one to another what have we done about whatever we done by is a church better off is it unified by Russian winds no sir it's only unified when them people will hear that still small voice of God that's where we're failing friends when God appears on own the signs with something and and proves himself to be God instead of going after the noise let's go after the one that made the noise we forget to give up it just reminds me of a story I heard a man of action that took place and there's a man very wealthy man and had some really really nice paintings that he made and you know after he passed away he was gonna sell all these paintings and and everything and and he had one real real ugly painting it's a painting of his son and this one nobody wanted so you know the auctioneer brought the son out first to picture the Sun and say who but give me any money for this so I ain't nobody give me nothing for that that ain't worth nothing we don't want that let's get on with the auction please leave that we're not so no no no we got an auctioneer so first who doesn't give me something for it you know and man we totally we don't want that you know just please get on with the auction just nobody wants that it's the ugly painting and that's not what we're here we want these other ones that's the that's the real business say well we're not gonna get on to that till somebody buys this one first so one guys I give I get $10 say $10 going once $10 going twice $10 going three times he said so to the man right here for $10 it said not a auction is closed option is closed we came here for this we came in from Sonora auction is closed what happened it says well I was in the will that whoever bought the son could have everything else hallelujah I hope we'll take Christ I hope we'll take the Son of God because everything else comes in that package hallelujah every gift every power every anointing comes in that package if we'll just take Christ to live in Christ the Living Word the revealed word for our day and so I want to encourage you look into the scripture find out where you stand when you living that you're not living back in the days of Moses you're not living back in the days of Noah you're not living even back in the days of the first coming of Lord Jesus but you are living the days where you can expect his second coming what scriptures are associated with that second coming what things are gonna what things that he's as you promised to do find out where that is being manifested then you'll know how to walk you won't go from church to church you'll find the people that have come from God and they're going back to God don't reject the reveal word for your day let's pray father we hear people that realize this is a very important owl in which we live things are happening so fast around us prophecies are being fulfilled and just trying to go back their inscriptions show how they reject it elijah after a tremendous manifestation and god here after rejecting plague struck death set in a ham lost his life Jezebel lost her life different people Lord just even even they have son he lost his life playing sitting on his feet God and I just I just realize how important it is and just trying to see these types of Scripture god I don't want us to miss it in this hour we get so wrapped up the seating just
