[59:38] always put the emphasis on him
[59:41] so just pray for us this morning we want
[59:47] to read from two passages of Scripture
[59:50] Isaiah chapter 7 and then also John
[59:54] chapter 1
[1:00:09] praise the Lord
[1:00:11] here in Isaiah 7 and verse 10 it says
[1:00:17] moreover the Lord speak again unto a
[1:00:20] half sing Asti a sign of the Lord like
[1:00:23] God ask it either in depth or in the
[1:00:26] height above but it has an eye but he
[1:00:30] has said I will not ask neither will I
[1:00:33] tempt the Lord and he said here you now
[1:00:38] o house of David is it a small thing for
[1:00:40] you to weary men but will you weary my
[1:00:44] God also therefore the Lord himself
[1:00:47] shall give you a sign since you won't
[1:00:49] ask for one imma give you one right the
[1:00:53] Lord himself shall give you a sign the
[1:00:56] whole a virgin shall conceive and bear a
[1:01:00] son and shall call his name Emmanuel a
[1:01:05] man let's stop turn over here to John
[1:01:09] chapter 1 thank the Lord for brother
[1:01:15] Jean you know last week I got a chance
[1:01:17] to hear its sermon and you know at
[1:01:21] church just really appreciate the Lord
[1:01:25] just using him just the way he gets into
[1:01:29] the story and just makes it live for
[1:01:32] everybody he's got a very very unique
[1:01:35] gift and man we thank God for that John
[1:01:39] one here just a few verses a man I'll go
[1:01:44] 1 through 5 and then I'll do verse 14
[1:01:47] says in the beginning was the word and
[1:01:50] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:01:53] God the same was in the beginning with
[1:01:57] God all things were made by him and
[1:02:00] without him was not anything made that
[1:02:02] was made
[1:02:03] and him was life and the life was the
[1:02:06] light of men and the light shine a--the
[1:02:11] and darkness and the darkness
[1:02:13] comprehended it not alright and skip to
[1:02:16] verse 14
[1:02:18] it says this lecture let me go to verse
[1:02:24] 10 says he he was in the world the world
[1:02:27] was made by him and the world knew him
[1:02:30] not
[1:02:31] I noticed he was in the world the world
[1:02:34] was made by him Amen if the world was
[1:02:39] made by him because we know in the back
[1:02:42] of the Bible say the beginning God
[1:02:43] created the heavens and the earth
[1:02:45] if the Bible say that and then we read
[1:02:48] over here John 1 that the world was me
[1:02:50] by him they then Jesus and God must be
[1:02:55] the same person that this would the
[1:02:59] Bible see a man so he says he was in the
[1:03:03] world and the world was made by him and
[1:03:06] the world knew him not a man what the
[1:03:11] world still don't know him the day you
[1:03:14] know they think this thing about Santa
[1:03:16] Claus a man Santa's a myth Jesus is real
[1:03:23] listen he came into his own and his own
[1:03:27] received or not but as many as received
[1:03:28] him to them gave he power to become the
[1:03:33] sons of God even to them that believe on
[1:03:36] his name which were born not of blood
[1:03:38] nor of the will of the flesh nor of the
[1:03:43] will of man but of God and the Word was
[1:03:47] made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[1:03:51] beheld his glory the glory as of the
[1:03:54] only begotten of the Father full of
[1:03:57] grace and truth
[1:03:58] the lord had a blessing to the reading
[1:04:00] of his word let's just pray father we
[1:04:01] thank you for the privilege and to read
[1:04:05] Scripture but God we we pray that the
[1:04:08] Holy Ghost would help us to understand
[1:04:10] what it is that we're reading make it
[1:04:13] clear God give us revelation of your
[1:04:15] word today we take every spirit that's
[1:04:18] against your spirit underneath the
[1:04:20] control of the Holy Spirit even right
[1:04:22] now in Jesus name we pray amen amen you
[1:04:26] can be seated we want to use for our
[1:04:29] topic today and the word was made flesh
[1:04:33] a man the word was made flesh just I'll
[1:04:38] start off by reading a little bit here
[1:04:40] and then we'll just see how the Lord
[1:04:42] will just take us I want to read from
[1:04:45] this sermon servers we would see Jesus
[1:04:47] and just a title alone a man I should
[1:04:50] draw attention because we we're living
[1:04:53] in a season where people don't have
[1:04:55] their eyes on Christ any more when it
[1:04:57] comes to Christmas a man and and and
[1:05:00] just you know so that we're clear about
[1:05:02] this I I want for one I do not believe
[1:05:06] Jesus was born on December 25th a man I
[1:05:10] don't believe that actually it the
[1:05:13] scripture does not support that in any
[1:05:16] way it's it came from pagan teachings
[1:05:19] that has actually infiltrated
[1:05:22] Christianity and and we you know we've
[1:05:25] we've we've we've adopted it you know
[1:05:27] even though I don't believe it you know
[1:05:29] I'm not depriving people their gifts and
[1:05:32] all of that you know and it certainly
[1:05:35] you know look forward to getting gifts
[1:05:36] and all that but we like to keep the
[1:05:38] truth make the truth the truth it's got
[1:05:41] nothing to do with Santa Claus and has
[1:05:43] got nothing to do with Jesus been born
[1:05:44] but I am glad that most of the world is
[1:05:47] force at least once per year to have to
[1:05:54] acknowledge Jesus well I'm glad about
[1:05:58] that
[1:05:59] sec when you as a Christian for us we
[1:06:02] acknowledge him every day so Christmas
[1:06:04] is not a man you know when we only time
[1:06:07] we celebrate his birth right we
[1:06:09] celebrated all the time as Christians
[1:06:11] every day is Christmas to me hallelujah
[1:06:16] for God so loved the world that He gave
[1:06:20] His only begotten Son
[1:06:22] whosoever would believe in him would
[1:06:24] have eternal life
[1:06:25] right so I celebrated all the time I
[1:06:28] don't have to wait to December 25th
[1:06:30] glory to God I open my present every day
[1:06:36] I open it every day and I enjoy his
[1:06:40] presence all right
[1:06:44] hallelujah somebody right but you know
[1:06:47] we thank the Lord you know for for the
[1:06:50] world haven't acknowledged it but even
[1:06:52] in our world today they come to a spot
[1:06:55] where they've int they put Santa Claus
[1:06:58] in Jesus place and they've done a lot of
[1:06:59] other things
[1:07:00] amen but we as Christians we want to put
[1:07:03] the focus where it belongs it's on our
[1:07:05] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and
[1:07:06] hopefully today we can we can really
[1:07:08] share what this is really all about the
[1:07:11] Word was made flesh that's what we're
[1:07:13] celebrating the Word was made flesh now
[1:07:16] I want to read here out of store as we
[1:07:18] would see Jesus says now it not not if
[1:07:21] you not if you go to the cradles say
[1:07:23] little baby was born here long years ago
[1:07:26] nonsense
[1:07:28] says all kinds of Creed's and fables
[1:07:31] told about it we know Jesus no at all
[1:07:34] all that thing would perish and get all
[1:07:38] mixed up but there's one thing is it
[1:07:42] mixed up that's the Holy Spirit and I
[1:07:45] like to say there's one thing that isn't
[1:07:47] mixed up and that is the Holy Spirit I
[1:07:49] meant paragraph 31 1 and sirs we would
[1:07:52] see Jesus and he said said one thing
[1:07:55] isn't mixed up so a lot of other stuff
[1:07:56] that's been mixed up but one thing that
[1:07:58] isn't mixed up that's the Holy Spirit
[1:08:00] and it goes on says says oh one of them
[1:08:03] say he was born right there right here
[1:08:06] we got a church built over it other one
[1:08:10] said he was born over here you know how
[1:08:13] many nails they got can prove it
[1:08:15] original nails that was in the cross 19
[1:08:18] each fella holding a nail night that is
[1:08:21] visa
[1:08:22] there's 19 people claiming that they got
[1:08:25] a nail at the cross that it was only for
[1:08:29] my understanding three nails in the
[1:08:31] cross but 19 people claiming they got a
[1:08:34] nail that's true that there's a problem
[1:08:36] somewhere now and let me just finish
[1:08:39] reading this i'ma break into a little
[1:08:40] something here says you know how many
[1:08:42] nails that God can prove it original
[1:08:44] nails that was in the cross now they say
[1:08:46] they can prove it 19
[1:08:47] each fella holding the nail
[1:08:49] this we got it hallelujah we got it they
[1:08:51] just got some dead bones and say we got
[1:08:56] it we got it this is the place he was
[1:08:58] born and others say this is the place he
[1:09:01] was born in they say this is the place
[1:09:03] she was born what difference does it
[1:09:05] make
[1:09:05] here here's where he was born in the
[1:09:09] heart glory to God hallelujah I like
[1:09:13] that church so we thought we not
[1:09:15] relaxing you know going to Amen Israel
[1:09:18] just to try to find the place where he
[1:09:19] was born
[1:09:20] let me I got a break into this just just
[1:09:22] give me a second you know I was I was
[1:09:24] there you know and we went to the place
[1:09:28] they call it the Church of the Nativity
[1:09:29] and when you walk into this places you
[1:09:33] know a Bethlehem and and and and and
[1:09:38] when you when we were kind of
[1:09:39] approaching this place is a you know you
[1:09:41] had to be a little bit more aware of
[1:09:42] where you were there was a lot of
[1:09:43] activity that was going on around here
[1:09:45] and when you walk in this Church of the
[1:09:47] Nativity there is actually like three
[1:09:50] congregations meeting in the same search
[1:09:53] and and each congregation is claiming a
[1:09:57] certain area as to where the way the
[1:10:01] birth actually took place and as we were
[1:10:03] you know what what you got is the Greek
[1:10:05] Orthodox they claim a certain part of it
[1:10:07] the Catholics claim a certain part of it
[1:10:10] and then I call them they called
[1:10:11] themselves the armenian apostolic right
[1:10:13] so all of these all of these groups are
[1:10:16] in one church having three different
[1:10:19] services surrounding the place where
[1:10:21] Jesus was born
[1:10:22] and then as I was going through the
[1:10:24] church we got in and man there's a line
[1:10:27] that was wrapped I mean so long I'm like
[1:10:29] wow I say if we gotta stand in that line
[1:10:31] to see where Jesus was born I don't
[1:10:35] think I'm gonna be able to make it I
[1:10:36] mean and you just took the line of
[1:10:39] people for I was just just waiting just
[1:10:42] to get a glimpse of where Jesus was born
[1:10:44] and they didn't realize Jesus was
[1:10:47] actually born then the man that was
[1:10:49] walking right by them he was born in my
[1:10:54] heart I was carrying Jesus
[1:10:59] they miss him Dean and they still
[1:11:02] missing him now
[1:11:04] hallelujah right but you know if I hear
[1:11:07] here you know we we lick it and I say
[1:11:09] man I said nah I'm not to come a long
[1:11:12] way but I came standing that line just
[1:11:14] to kind of see where Jesus was born
[1:11:16] right and that's tough so you know the
[1:11:17] brothers say well the good thing about
[1:11:19] is that you know these people you know
[1:11:21] they're very committed to their faith
[1:11:23] and they come here from all over the
[1:11:24] world just to counter see this little
[1:11:26] spots it but if we go down on the other
[1:11:28] side over here the line gonna be a lot
[1:11:29] shorter right because they claim that
[1:11:32] you know this is also the spot when he
[1:11:34] was born and this one claim that this
[1:11:35] was the spot he was born where when you
[1:11:37] go to the other side they take you down
[1:11:39] these stairs and up you know some of the
[1:11:41] spot him and when we get in there you
[1:11:42] walk back into the area and saying I
[1:11:45] looked through the peephole in the door
[1:11:47] and we looked through the peephole and
[1:11:48] go that's the place that Jesus was born
[1:11:50] so I'm walking back there what everybody
[1:11:53] looking at can't look through the people
[1:11:55] sit man out see you know I don't want to
[1:12:03] criticize it but you know I don't really
[1:12:05] see much because we realized that that's
[1:12:07] not really where he was born
[1:12:08] when he was born is in your heart glory
[1:12:12] to God amen everybody want to go back to
[1:12:14] a manger right but where he wants to go
[1:12:17] is in your hearts that's where he wants
[1:12:20] to be born in your heart not and then
[1:12:22] you know the manger you know that was
[1:12:25] just part of the story
[1:12:26] amen but the ultimate place that he
[1:12:28] wanted to take a person he was in the
[1:12:33] alternate place where he want to be born
[1:12:35] is inside of you and he wants your flesh
[1:12:39] to become the words oh my the word will
[1:12:43] become flesh all right all right stay
[1:12:47] with me here he goes on to say this it
[1:12:50] says well what's the matter he got lost
[1:12:53] again people's lost him that's right but
[1:12:56] he's been lost again in the big crowds
[1:12:59] the crowds have creeds you remember one
[1:13:02] time he got lost to his parents he's
[1:13:04] lost again and I want you to just get
[1:13:07] that it says he's lost again he got lost
[1:13:11] go to
[1:13:11] on these streets like like it's been the
[1:13:13] last few days look at the matte crowds
[1:13:15] pushing and shoving and drinking and
[1:13:17] cursing and damli and you know and and
[1:13:20] it you know what what the Prophet is
[1:13:21] saying here the traffic get worse people
[1:13:25] get they got less patients on the road I
[1:13:31] was I was on the highway this week and I
[1:13:33] was just trying to just get into a lane
[1:13:35] and then I saw I saw a little opening
[1:13:38] so I say nobody gonna let me you can put
[1:13:41] your blink on all you want to ain't
[1:13:43] nobody just gonna lift you into the
[1:13:45] landing people mind that then I lost in
[1:13:48] mind a lot of times I said I just wanted
[1:13:51] to get on 95 can I just get in that Lane

[1:17:26] they lost him in Easter bunny rabbit or
[1:17:28] a new hat
[1:17:29] not the resurrection not the birth of
[1:17:31] Christ they lost him in the crease when
[1:17:32] they made three gods out of him
[1:17:34] chop them into pieces and made an idol
[1:17:37] instead of knowing who he is I and my
[1:17:39] father are one you lost him
[1:17:43] I'm going on he's lost in the religious
[1:17:46] crowd how the religious crowd he's lost
[1:17:49] to his church in the Laodicean the last
[1:17:51] church age which we're living in that
[1:17:52] right now it's saying he was on the
[1:17:55] outside of the church knocking trying to
[1:17:57] get in the most pathetic sight in all
[1:18:00] the Bible is the condition of the church
[1:18:03] in the last days before Jesus comes
[1:18:06] before he comes just said not another
[1:18:08] church age ever put them out they didn't
[1:18:10] know any difference now when they really
[1:18:13] know the true power of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:15] they kicked him out of the place on the
[1:18:18] outside knocking at the door behold I
[1:18:20] stand at the door and knock
[1:18:21] now when you get a glimpse of that a man
[1:18:24] you go back and read that in Revelation
[1:18:26] 3 you get a glimpse of that you can see
[1:18:28] that where we live in that today is
[1:18:29] exactly where they were living at when
[1:18:32] there was no room in the end there was
[1:18:35] no room in the end nobody wanted I mean
[1:18:37] you know while I was there in Israel the
[1:18:41] that this is one gentleman I think he
[1:18:43] was a Muslim and he was trying to
[1:18:46] because the Muslims own Bethlehem and
[1:18:48] he's trying to say you know the Bible
[1:18:50] try to say that we did Jesus wrong by
[1:18:52] not having a room in the end he said but
[1:18:53] the Bible say something he quoted
[1:18:56] something and when he quoted I said and
[1:18:58] all of the Bible don't say that you know
[1:19:00] he's like he's like no there was no room
[1:19:02] in the end that night that they made it
[1:19:04] like what the violence a lot about that
[1:19:07] night that they thought it was no room
[1:19:08] in the end he was born in a manger right
[1:19:12] this is where he was born say that
[1:19:13] except not now now I don't know what
[1:19:16] Baba y'all reading but I Bible tell us
[1:19:18] that he was born and he was in a manger
[1:19:20] in a stable at hey he was born amongst
[1:19:22] animals now now now now now I think
[1:19:24] that's appropriate because our our
[1:19:28] Savior also has the title Lamb of God so
[1:19:33] as the Lamb of God he would have been
[1:19:35] born just like other lambs are born and
[1:19:37] the reason that we say he wasn't born a
[1:19:39] man at on December deep summer 25th the
[1:19:42] day that they trying to say the reason
[1:19:44] we said it because it's cold and and
[1:19:46] there would be no
[1:19:47] scheppers in they feel watching Fox at
[1:19:49] that time of year right here if he's the
[1:19:52] Lamb of God he would have been born at
[1:19:54] the same time other lambs are born which
[1:19:57] would have been the springtime
[1:19:59] hallelujah
[1:20:01] so this is what this is this is what
[1:20:03] it's all about and when we look at it
[1:20:05] you know when we really take a look at
[1:20:07] this it was the word being made flesh we
[1:20:11] look at this scripture a man that we're
[1:20:14] ant here in the beginning was the word
[1:20:18] lorry to God a man just stay with me
[1:20:23] here for a little bit I want to I want
[1:20:25] to line something up yes Lord yes Lord
[1:20:29] amen in the beginning was the word in
[1:20:32] the beginning was the word and the Word
[1:20:35] was with God and the Word was God
[1:20:37] now now if we were to go to a man a
[1:20:42] Greek Bible we would see that that's
[1:20:45] that's spoken up a little differently
[1:20:47] and it would say in the beginning was
[1:20:50] the logos and the logos was with God and
[1:20:55] the logos was God now this this one
[1:20:57] scripture has generated a lot of
[1:21:00] problems in Christianity a man has
[1:21:03] created a lot of a lot of issues and and
[1:21:07] unfortunately Christianity now people
[1:21:10] have three gods and don't realize they
[1:21:12] got three gods
[1:21:12] right they have the Father they have the
[1:21:15] son they have the Holy Ghost they got
[1:21:17] three different gods that they trying to
[1:21:19] give us but the but the Bible say that
[1:21:21] our God is one right and if he's one of
[1:21:25] them you can't give us a picture of
[1:21:27] three and then try to you know try to
[1:21:29] make it all work E
[1:21:30] if he was one at the beginning he gonna
[1:21:32] be one of the end and in the book of
[1:21:34] Revelation when John looked on the
[1:21:36] throne John say I saw one sitting on the
[1:21:39] throne that's always gonna be one from
[1:21:42] Genesis to Revelation it is one so
[1:21:45] somewhere in between we got lost some
[1:21:47] Jesus it's lost again
[1:21:50] so let's descend let's try to work with
[1:21:53] this right because the Bible say the
[1:21:54] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:21:56] with god and the word
[1:21:58] Oh God or in the beginning was the logos
[1:22:02] and the logos was with God and the logos
[1:22:05] was God when you skip down to verse 14
[1:22:07] it was safe and the word was made flesh
[1:22:09] for the logos was made flesh now I want
[1:22:12] to say it like that because I want to
[1:22:14] try to help us understand what happened
[1:22:16] it wasn't that there were three God's
[1:22:18] co-equal that's not what we're talking
[1:22:21] about the word Trinity is not even in
[1:22:23] the Bible but yet people believe in it
[1:22:26] but when we look at this all that happen
[1:22:29] is that the Bible tells us God was a
[1:22:31] spirit hallelujah see there was a
[1:22:35] purpose for him being born we you know
[1:22:37] people that people don't be people
[1:22:38] actually forgot why he was born why he
[1:22:43] became flesh the purpose is because we
[1:22:45] needed a kinsman redeemer after Adam
[1:22:48] sold us into sin we needed another
[1:22:51] second Adam to redeem us back to God
[1:22:54] again so those are purpose for him to
[1:22:58] come in flesh and it wasn't that God
[1:23:03] just sent His only Son God became the
[1:23:07] son I said 12 times that God became the
[1:23:12] son he became our Savior through the
[1:23:15] flesh of Jesus Christ oh my god see if
[1:23:23] there was if he had not done that the
[1:23:26] penalty would have never been paid it
[1:23:28] wasn't it wasn't just a you know a you
[1:23:31] know I mean it would just be totally
[1:23:33] unjust for God just a cinder son I mean
[1:23:37] I don't have any boys but if I had a boy
[1:23:39] if I only had one boy and I and I said a
[1:23:42] rule and say anybody crossed his line
[1:23:45] gonna die then you know maybe one of the
[1:23:49] brothers walked by and cross the line
[1:23:50] say old man I love you so much I feel so
[1:23:52] sorry for you I don't want you to die
[1:23:54] I've never expected that to happen to
[1:23:56] you so did I get my my son my one and
[1:23:58] only son say my son
[1:24:00] I made a law that whoever cross the line
[1:24:02] would have to die and this brother just
[1:24:05] crossed a line I feel so sorry for him I
[1:24:06] don't want him to die son I want you to
[1:24:08] take his place
[1:24:09] my son would probably look at me I
[1:24:12] you know even if I were of that Sun I
[1:24:14] would look at my daddy said that I
[1:24:17] didn't do nothing wrong
[1:24:19] your friend that you feel sorry for and
[1:24:21] actually think about it
[1:24:23] you want me to die for your friend that
[1:24:25] telling me that you love you're free and
[1:24:27] money you love me
[1:24:28] I mean God don't think that way right I
[1:24:34] mean in order for him to be just he
[1:24:36] wouldn't just have his thumb come and
[1:24:38] die for his friend no in order for him
[1:24:40] to be just he becomes the son and he
[1:24:43] died for the friend this is what
[1:24:46] happened so so when we say in the
[1:24:48] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:24:50] with God
[1:24:51] Oh hallelujah what happens that as a
[1:24:56] spirit that spirit gave forth a light
[1:25:00] that's what the logo sees it's a light
[1:25:02] right and and so so so when you go back
[1:25:05] and read Genesis hallelujah and you see
[1:25:09] where it says let there be light that
[1:25:13] first light was not sunlight as you in
[1:25:17] life that was f om light hallelujah it
[1:25:24] was s om like because the SU in light
[1:25:28] did not come until the fourth day when
[1:25:30] he made two great lights one the ruler
[1:25:32] there one the room life so the first
[1:25:34] light when he said let there be light
[1:25:36] would have been s OE light which is what
[1:25:39] John was trying to tell us in the
[1:25:41] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:25:43] with God and the Word was God and where
[1:25:48] people get stuck is this with God with
[1:25:51] God with God and I always go back to you
[1:25:53] can't miss words God if it was with God
[1:25:58] and was God do we have two different
[1:25:59] gods no no no no no this is what we call
[1:26:03] God's plan of redemption in order to
[1:26:07] redeem us because he knew we'd be lost
[1:26:09] I'm talked about before Adam's sin I
[1:26:12] hope you get it before sin entered into
[1:26:17] the world God already had a plan in
[1:26:20] motion
[1:26:21] okay you know it can I just tell you
[1:26:24] like this before you real
[1:26:25] she was a sinner Christ had already died
[1:26:32] for your sin Christ had already made a
[1:26:37] way for you to be redeemed Christ had
[1:26:40] already made a way it meant for you to
[1:26:42] come back into fellowship with God I've
[1:26:45] talked about before you made the mistake
[1:26:47] that you made God had already had a plan
[1:26:51] in place and that plan started way back
[1:26:53] in the beginning where says in the
[1:26:55] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:26:57] with God and the Word was God
[1:27:02] all that happens that God was going from
[1:27:05] spirit form to a light and not now how
[1:27:08] do we know that that's not that that was
[1:27:10] God how we know how do we know these
[1:27:12] things how do we know that was God how
[1:27:13] do we know that light because Jesus is
[1:27:17] God how we know that how do we know that
[1:27:18] well Paul was on the road to Damascus
[1:27:23] and he saw a great light Paul began to
[1:27:28] talk to the light Paul was talking to a
[1:27:35] light and as he's talking to the light
[1:27:38] he asked them I mean they say they say
[1:27:41] Paul it's hard for you to kick against
[1:27:43] the print you know you know you don't do
[1:27:45] this party he just kind of habit comes
[1:27:47] in say say say who are down Lord that
[1:27:50] was Paul's question and the light spoke
[1:27:54] back to Paul I am Jesus that's the same
[1:28:03] light that was there in the beginning
[1:28:08] not only was the light with God but the
[1:28:10] light was caught and that light was made
[1:28:14] flesh and dwelt among us he couldn't die
[1:28:18] as a spirit and he couldn't die as a
[1:28:21] light but that light had to take on a
[1:28:25] body and they don't realize on December
[1:28:28] 25th they are honoring a day where that
[1:28:33] word or that light became
[1:28:40] Sammy and got nothing to do with that
[1:28:41] Santa Claus nowhere near that pigs Oh
[1:28:46] God
[1:28:48] read with me here I just want to read
[1:28:50] something super side
[1:29:00] and I'm gonna go to paragraph 76 in this
[1:29:03] when we when we when we look at super
[1:29:08] Sun the scripture that the Prophet would
[1:29:14] preach from it all was always Isaiah 7
[1:29:17] it says the Lord himself shall give you
[1:29:21] the whole a virgin shall conceive and
[1:29:24] bear a son and shall call his name
[1:29:26] Emmanuel you know it was important that
[1:29:28] he was he was born virgin birth now Adam
[1:29:34] did not have the same type of birth that
[1:29:36] we have Adam was just created Eve was
[1:29:41] made from Adam right God formed her from
[1:29:45] front from that rib that he took out
[1:29:47] Adam sighs so much can be said that
[1:29:49] y'all know he took the rear by the side
[1:29:51] he also took the finished spirit hello
[1:29:54] somebody he took that out of Adam the
[1:30:00] dog him I'm gonna say that again God
[1:30:03] took the feminist spirit out of Adam so
[1:30:09] if we see the feminine spirit in another
[1:30:12] ham we know something they right cuz God
[1:30:18] took it out and he gave it to Eve hello
[1:30:26] so Eve had a feminine spirit and Adam
[1:30:30] had a masculine spirit so even today has
[1:30:33] a masculine spirit and Adam has a
[1:30:37] feminine spirit we got a problem
[1:30:45] but see because of sin he had to come
[1:30:50] and die we needed to save you we needed
[1:30:53] to save you because of sin and and and
[1:30:56] and um this this great celebratory day
[1:31:00] this is what we want to draw attention
[1:31:02] to it was it was God becoming flesh in
[1:31:05] order to come and die I said we don't
[1:31:08] just celebrate in his birth but we also
[1:31:11] celebrate his death and we don't stop
[1:31:14] there because there's been many great
[1:31:15] religious leaders that have come and
[1:31:17] died but what separates Christianity
[1:31:20] from everybody else is that our leader
[1:31:24] rose again so let's look at this oh my
[1:31:33] even even a scripture Isaiah 7:14
[1:31:36] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[1:31:38] you a son behold a virgin shall conceive
[1:31:40] and bear a son and shall call his name
[1:31:42] Emmanuel that that call his name
[1:31:44] Emmanuel meant God with us that was the
[1:31:48] whole purpose God God wanted to be with
[1:31:51] us a man and not only just with us see
[1:31:55] God at one time it was God above us then
[1:31:57] with God with us but today it is God in
[1:32:00] us that's why I say that the words being
[1:32:04] made flesh all over again is it me been
[1:32:06] made flesh in you I want you to just
[1:32:08] bear with me here I want to just just
[1:32:11] draw draw a couple things in man as we
[1:32:13] go on this is out of super sign and
[1:32:16] paragraph 76 says watch God and his ways
[1:32:21] of work when it created to heaven earth
[1:32:24] when he created the heavens and earth he
[1:32:27] called the angels together and he said
[1:32:29] let us every place in the scripture
[1:32:32] where he did anything mostly not me but
[1:32:35] my father but when it comes to the plan
[1:32:37] of redemption he come alone nobody was
[1:32:39] with him he was the only one that could
[1:32:43] come and angel couldn't do it let me
[1:32:46] just add this Santa Claus couldn't do it
[1:32:48] the elves couldn't do it rudolph the
[1:32:52] red-nosed reindeer
[1:32:54] didn't do it an angel couldn't do it
[1:32:58] another man called it see that's why I
[1:33:01] just said notice that another man called
[1:33:02] his son
[1:33:03] it couldn't do it so that's why I
[1:33:07] wondered just another man called the son
[1:33:08] it was God himself in the Sun another
[1:33:11] man call this son can do it one calls
[1:33:13] something else a holy virgin or a holy
[1:33:16] mother or some saint couldn't do it God
[1:33:19] had to come he says now give you a sign
[1:33:22] a virgin shall conceive and a baby will
[1:33:24] be born and he will be Immanuel God with
[1:33:27] us a super Sun God and his people got
[1:33:30] witness people got become his people God
[1:33:33] and man became one a sign a stumbling
[1:33:36] block to the world but a blessed hope
[1:33:38] for for the believer a sign that would
[1:33:41] be evil spoken of now go back to the
[1:33:44] front of that quote I need to go back to
[1:33:47] write to the beginning of that quote
[1:33:50] notice this watch God and His ways of
[1:33:55] work when he created the heavens and
[1:33:59] earth he called the angels together do
[1:34:04] you like that that's why I had to stop I
[1:34:09] don't think everybody caught it that's
[1:34:13] why I just I'm a slow down 3-1 listen
[1:34:19] watch go and his ways of work when he
[1:34:24] created the heavens and earth he called
[1:34:28] the angels together and he said let us
[1:34:41] because people got it look confusing you
[1:34:43] know they look at well if Jesus was the
[1:34:46] logos and he was like than what he did
[1:34:48] it was God in Jesus at the beginning
[1:34:51] that said let us know the logos was God
[1:34:57] the logos was God so so when you said
[1:35:01] well who was that when God said let us
[1:35:04] we just found the answer God call the
[1:35:08] angels together and he says let us make
[1:35:13] man in our image
[1:35:16] that means angels then would have to be
[1:35:19] in the image of man
[1:35:25] you mean no wings some of them do
[1:35:31] terrible ooh Seraphim have wings but
[1:35:33] there are some others men oh I can't
[1:35:38] give it away if you want
[1:35:43] I just gave you a UH this is a key that
[1:35:46] will unlock some ghosts when God said
[1:35:48] let us make man it was him talking with
[1:35:52] angels because angels were already in
[1:35:55] the image of men all right okay
[1:36:04] Genesis 32 and 24 now I'm skipping one
[1:36:10] scripture here but when Abraham in
[1:36:13] Genesis 17 saw three angels they were
[1:36:18] men that had come down it was God and
[1:36:20] two other angels before those angels
[1:36:23] went down into Sodom Gomorrah hello them
[1:36:27] fellows in Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:36:31] they were lusting after men not-not-not
[1:36:36] fellows with wings on them men men so
[1:36:44] those angels look like men not only that
[1:36:49] they talk like men they could sit and
[1:36:52] eat like men God all right listen
[1:36:58] approve it by the scripture Genesis 32
[1:37:01] 24 let me just get this in my Bible I'm
[1:37:04] telling y'all to get any our Bible but
[1:37:07] let me let me get this 32:24 says in
[1:37:12] Jacob was left alone and there wrestled
[1:37:16] a man with him until the breaking of the
[1:37:22] day now some of us say you know and it's
[1:37:25] you know you go to different Bibles and
[1:37:27] you know we got all of these different
[1:37:28] study tools that we used we used so many
[1:37:31] different static tools to try to
[1:37:32] understand the Word of God
[1:37:34] I realized that but if you just used the
[1:37:37] profit it would just really help out it
[1:37:39] would really help out just use God's
[1:37:40] profit
[1:37:41] that's the study tool use the table the
[1:37:44] table but there's people that would say
[1:37:48] well when it said that he rests with a
[1:37:51] man then that was Jesus there's others
[1:37:54] ever said well that was an angel and
[1:37:55] they they people just divided on all
[1:37:57] kind of stuff well let's let the Bible
[1:38:00] prove it turn with me to hosea chapter
[1:38:02] 12 verse 4 because when I'm proven to
[1:38:07] you now is that man I mean angels can
[1:38:10] look like men because they said let us
[1:38:13] make man in our image so angels can look
[1:38:16] like men Hosea 12 for glory to God it's
[1:38:22] talking about the story of Jacob here
[1:38:24] says yeah he had power over the angel
[1:38:28] glory to God when I just ran in Genesis
[1:38:32] 32 24 says Jacob was left alone and
[1:38:34] there he wrestled a man but here in
[1:38:37] hosea 12 48 he had power over the angel
[1:38:40] and he and prevailed he wept and made
[1:38:43] supplication unto him he found him in
[1:38:46] Bethel and there he spake with us so
[1:38:47] here we got clear proof that Jacob was
[1:38:50] wrestling with a man who was an angel
[1:38:57] let's give people a little bit more that
[1:38:59] might not be enough
[1:39:00] Daniel 92118 92119 92120 will come talk
[1:39:18] to him that angel had a name his name
[1:39:21] was Gabriel and in Daniel 9 21 it says
[1:39:26] this yeh while I was speaking in prayer
[1:39:30] even the man Gabriel even the man
[1:39:39] Gabriel whom I had seen in the vision at
[1:39:41] the beginning being caused to fly
[1:39:43] swiftly touch me about the time of the
[1:39:46] evening
[1:39:47] so here we got Gabriel being a man very
[1:39:51] easy for when God to say let us make man
[1:39:54] in our own image for angels to be man
[1:39:59] hallelujah I got another one judges 13
[1:40:04] you know the Bible say in the mouth of
[1:40:06] two or three witnesses let every word be
[1:40:09] established so judges 13 here's another
[1:40:13] one
[1:40:13] Oh glory glory glory glory glory glory
[1:40:18] all right judge is 13
[1:40:21] amen and I'm gonna you know hearing it
[1:40:23] in this particular passage we could we
[1:40:25] could read the whole thing yeah let's
[1:40:27] just read this I think y'all that y'all
[1:40:28] enjoy verse 1 this is the birth of
[1:40:31] Samson
[1:40:32] okay look and the children of Israel did
[1:40:34] evil again in the sight of Lord and the
[1:40:36] Lord delivered them into the hand of the
[1:40:38] Philistines 40 years and there was a
[1:40:41] certain man of Zorah of the family of
[1:40:43] Danites whose name was Manoah and his
[1:40:45] wife was barren and bare 9 and the angel
[1:40:48] of the Lord appeared unto the woman and
[1:40:51] said unto her behold now thou art barren
[1:40:54] and embarrassed not but thou shall
[1:40:57] conceive and bear son so she's getting a
[1:40:59] visitation from an angel now look at
[1:41:01] this now therefore beware I pray thee
[1:41:03] and drink not wine nor strong drink and
[1:41:06] eat not any unclean thing drink not wine
[1:41:12] nor strong drink did I read that drink
[1:41:19] not wine nor strong drink something I
[1:41:24] can say that was with Sampson that's for
[1:41:26] you to Alleluia I know Jesus turned
[1:41:30] water into wine but you can't find where
[1:41:32] he drunk it a man the Nazarites didn't
[1:41:36] drink wine that's why all right listen
[1:41:38] there's now therefore beware I pray thee
[1:41:41] and drink not wine nor strong drink and
[1:41:43] eat not any unclean thing for lo thou
[1:41:46] shalt conceive and bear some and no
[1:41:48] razor shall come on with it now you know
[1:41:49] can I just just you know back back here
[1:41:53] you know they're telling this woman's
[1:41:55] gonna be pregnant don't drink wine don't
[1:41:57] drink wine
[1:41:58] now that was just something small back
[1:42:01] in that time I mean you know from my
[1:42:02] understanding they really didn't have
[1:42:04] too many other things a drink you got
[1:42:05] coke and sprite and then kool-aid and
[1:42:08] you know sweet tea and all kind of stuff
[1:42:11] that you drink nowadays but back then
[1:42:13] was either water sometime the water some
[1:42:15] contaminate they could not drink
[1:42:17] anything else so they had wine they
[1:42:19] fermented from grapes right so you know
[1:42:21] back in that time so here that the angel
[1:42:24] telling her not to drink wine but you
[1:42:25] know if we would just stay with that
[1:42:27] principle we wouldn't have some of the
[1:42:28] problems that we got today oh Lord
[1:42:31] so my kids were not suffer if we were to
[1:42:35] stay with these principles our kids went
[1:42:36] suffer because it's tough that enters
[1:42:38] the mother's body while the child is
[1:42:41] pregnant
[1:42:41] that creates some of the problems for
[1:42:43] the children a man I'll just read listen
[1:42:46] to a story the other day you know that
[1:42:49] this this this woman she's pregnant and
[1:42:51] just addicted to drugs absolutely
[1:42:54] addicted just could not let them go
[1:42:56] and want somebody to adopt a child and
[1:42:59] you know this police officer decided to
[1:43:01] take the child and adopt it but when
[1:43:03] they got the child man that child is
[1:43:05] having all kind of withdrawal symptoms
[1:43:06] from the drugs and and like and they
[1:43:08] were the household they didn't do drugs
[1:43:10] like what are we gonna do this child
[1:43:12] that child would have never had that
[1:43:14] happened to it and the mama not been
[1:43:16] doing what the mom was doing if we just
[1:43:20] take with basic principles we wouldn't
[1:43:22] have some of the problems that we got
[1:43:23] today drink not wine nostro drink no
[1:43:29] certainly not smoking cigarettes
[1:43:31] certainly not you know doing drugs none
[1:43:34] of that should be happening
[1:43:35] I'm not talk about when you're pregnant
[1:43:36] even when you're not pregnant oh I know
[1:43:44] you turn 21 that don't mean nothing I
[1:43:48] don't mean nothing the Bible still say
[1:43:51] don't do it even though the law may
[1:43:54] allow you to do it the Bible say don't
[1:43:56] do it hallelujah well that devil got
[1:44:02] loose and be be that they need something
[1:44:04] I can get me a drink that devil you're
[1:44:06] in and make a less out of you and one

[1:46:10] the truth that night that you called me
[1:46:12] out God was dealing with me but she
[1:46:14] rejected it for the last time and her
[1:46:17] heart became hard never to hear the
[1:46:20] gospel again
[1:46:22] listen for though thou shalt conceive
[1:46:26] and bear a son and no razor should come
[1:46:28] on his head but the child should be a
[1:46:30] Nazarite unto God from the womb and he
[1:46:31] shall begin to deliver Israel out of the
[1:46:33] hand of the Philistines then the woman
[1:46:36] came and told her husband saying a man
[1:46:38] of God then noticed this there's the age
[1:46:41] of the Lord but she's saying a man of
[1:46:43] God
[1:46:44] all right the woman came and told her
[1:46:46] husband said a man of God came unto me
[1:46:48] and his counsels was like the
[1:46:50] countenance of an angel of God very
[1:46:52] terrible but I asked him not when she
[1:46:54] was neither told me his name but he said
[1:46:58] unto me behold thou shalt conceive and
[1:46:59] bear son and and and now drink no wine
[1:47:02] nor strong drink neither eat any unclean
[1:47:04] thing for the child shall be a Nazarite
[1:47:07] to God from the womb to the day of his
[1:47:09] death and I know some of y'all might say
[1:47:11] well you're dealing with the drink of
[1:47:12] what about unclean things don't eat that
[1:47:14] either and there's a lot of stuff that
[1:47:17] you shouldn't be they can actually prove
[1:47:19] you some of the stuff that you do eat
[1:47:20] it's what causes some of the diseases in
[1:47:21] your body
[1:47:22] a man prays alone lower to God I don't
[1:47:27] think when we get to the other side
[1:47:28] we'll be killing animals to eat them it
[1:47:33] won't be that way
[1:47:34] amen so if you want to go on a diet like
[1:47:37] that that's fine I'm not no but I eat
[1:47:40] meat because God eat meat
[1:47:48] yeah yeah y'all never read that that's
[1:47:52] destiny when he when he step with
[1:47:54] Abraham that was God eating meat that's
[1:47:57] why I eat meat God eat me fish he ate
[1:48:02] meat prays alone ain't no but if you
[1:48:05] want to do something that's fine
[1:48:06] glory to God all right we can bring we
[1:48:09] can if you want to have that
[1:48:10] conversation we can a man but just
[1:48:12] understand that everything I pray for is
[1:48:14] bless the Bible say dad's all right come
[1:48:25] on y'all I'm going on I'm talk about the
[1:48:27] word with me flesh and it says but he
[1:48:30] said it behold thou shalt conceive and
[1:48:32] bear a son and and and now drink no wine
[1:48:35] or strong drink neither eat any unclean
[1:48:37] thing for the child should be a Nazarite
[1:48:38] to God from the womb to the day of his
[1:48:40] death then monoi entreated the Lord and
[1:48:43] said oh my lord
[1:48:44] let the man of God which thou didst sin
[1:48:47] come again unto us and teach us what we
[1:48:49] shall do unto the child unto the child
[1:48:53] that shall be born and God hearkened to
[1:48:54] the voice of manure and the angel of God
[1:48:57] came again unto the woman and she said
[1:48:59] in the field but minora husband was not
[1:49:02] with her and the woman made haste I ran
[1:49:04] and showed her husband and said unto him
[1:49:06] behold the man I'm just tryin to prove
[1:49:10] to you that an angel can be a minyan so
[1:49:13] when God says let us make man and he's
[1:49:16] talking to their angels that angels work
[1:49:19] man hallelujah listen listen I'm at
[1:49:27] verse 10 says and the woman made haste
[1:49:30] and ran and showed her husband and said
[1:49:31] in him behold the man hath appeared unto
[1:49:34] me that came unto me the other day and
[1:49:36] my know arose and went after his wife
[1:49:38] and came to the man and said to him
[1:49:41] aren't thou the man that speaketh unto
[1:49:44] the woman and he said I am and my noah
[1:49:46] said now let thy words come to pass how
[1:49:48] shall we order the child and how shall
[1:49:50] we do unto him and the angel Lord look
[1:49:53] at what he said the angel the Lord said
[1:49:55] in the know of all that I said and
[1:49:57] the woman let her be where I just want
[1:49:59] to stop there I I wanted to try to get
[1:50:02] us to understand see when we're bringing
[1:50:03] the word was made flesh there's when you
[1:50:06] start going back into some of this
[1:50:08] especially those that believe in three
[1:50:09] gods they say they don't believe in
[1:50:11] three guys but when they got to gods
[1:50:13] standing at the beginning you believe in
[1:50:14] three gods right I'm trying to get it
[1:50:16] it's only one God as a spirit brother
[1:50:19] branham said he gave birth to himself he
[1:50:21] became a light because as a spirit
[1:50:23] people can identify him but as a light
[1:50:25] they could identify his presence but he
[1:50:27] see he went on beyond that and when
[1:50:30] hallelujah when he finally took on flesh
[1:50:34] that was God going from that light form
[1:50:37] into a body form the word itself became
[1:50:41] flesh and there was the purpose for that
[1:50:43] because we needed to be redeemed and God
[1:50:46] then just sent his son God became the
[1:50:49] sign so he could redeem us that's what
[1:50:53] Christmas is really all about
[1:50:56] can I just I'm just I'm gonna cut this
[1:51:01] off a man I get I got I got more but
[1:51:03] imma cut it off I just love him I like
[1:51:06] to talk about him at Christmastime I
[1:51:08] like to talk about him there's give me a
[1:51:12] few more minutes he and I'll leave
[1:51:15] glory to God but there's another
[1:51:19] statement that I want you to understand
[1:51:20] that you know this word was constantly
[1:51:25] anytime God made a promise God was
[1:51:28] setting it up because that word that
[1:51:29] promise was gonna be made flesh now when
[1:51:33] he told Abraham that he was going to
[1:51:34] have a promise son and when Isaac was
[1:51:36] born the word was made flesh hallelujah
[1:51:40] there was a time where they they got
[1:51:42] away from God again they needed a new
[1:51:44] king to come on the scene and they
[1:51:45] prophesied about Josiah being born and
[1:51:48] when Josiah was born guess what the word
[1:51:51] itself was being made flesh amen the
[1:51:55] same thing it was with with our Lord and
[1:51:57] Savior Jesus Christ you know there was
[1:52:00] certain promises that were there all the
[1:52:02] way back from the book of genesis 3:15 I
[1:52:05] will put enmity between thee and the
[1:52:07] woman between thy seed and her seed
[1:52:10] so bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise
[1:52:11] his heel way back then God was speaking
[1:52:14] of the virgin birth because a woman does
[1:52:15] not carry a see if the woman carries the
[1:52:17] egg hallelujah so way back in the book
[1:52:21] of Genesis after the first sin God was
[1:52:24] had already made away and we had the
[1:52:26] wait years before that was manifested
[1:52:29] but Christmas is when that word or that
[1:52:32] promise was made flesh oh my God my God
[1:52:38] my God there are so many other
[1:52:40] scriptures that were you know that were
[1:52:43] written concerning our Lord and Savior
[1:52:45] coming in the prophecies all throughout
[1:52:47] the Old Testament but uh you know one of
[1:52:50] the other scriptures that I that I love
[1:52:51] to read is Isaiah 9:6 that was
[1:52:57] prophesied about that word becoming
[1:52:59] flesh and there not just when it became
[1:53:02] flesh and dwelt among us there was gonna
[1:53:05] be some other attributes displeased
[1:53:08] hallelujah some other attributes
[1:53:11] displayed Amen that that was locked in
[1:53:13] God that he just could not display Amen
[1:53:16] and and one of them was when he was when
[1:53:18] it said to be called Emmanuel that was
[1:53:20] come out with us now he got some other
[1:53:23] things that he want to display what it
[1:53:25] says in Isaiah 9:6 says for unto us a
[1:53:28] child is born unto us a son is given and
[1:53:34] the government shall be upon his
[1:53:37] shoulder and his name shall be called
[1:53:41] wonderful counsellor the mighty God the
[1:53:45] everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[1:53:49] you know there was a time brother
[1:53:51] branham's preaching the message service
[1:53:52] we would see Jesus made a statement says
[1:53:54] wish I had time I like to take a text on
[1:53:56] each one of them counseling the Prince
[1:53:59] of Peace mighty God everlasting father
[1:54:00] and wonderful and I done did that before
[1:54:03] I can't do it all today but I do want to
[1:54:05] tell you he is wonderful honey
[1:54:09] Amen this Jesus that was born he is
[1:54:13] certainly wonderful what brother Jack
[1:54:15] how you know well and I was just
[1:54:17] listening to a little sermon and brother
[1:54:19] man say when he stood up and say
[1:54:20] I am the way the truth and the life that
[1:54:23] was wonderful he said when he said I am
[1:54:26] the light of the world that was
[1:54:28] wonderful
[1:54:29] when he says I am the first and the last
[1:54:31] the beginning and the end
[1:54:33] I'm Alpha Omega everything in between
[1:54:35] say that was wonderful when he turned
[1:54:39] water into wine wonderful when he fed
[1:54:42] 5000 that was wonderful
[1:54:45] we fed 4000 that also was wonderful when
[1:54:49] he changed my life wonderful when it
[1:54:55] saved me from seeing wonderful when he
[1:54:58] filled me with the Holy Ghost
[1:55:00] wonderful oh yes he is wonderful
[1:55:05] it's a he's a counselor you'd go back in
[1:55:09] the scripture and you look at a couple
[1:55:10] of things and in one in particular
[1:55:12] Simon's house when he went to Simon's
[1:55:14] house Simon and they wouldn't wash his
[1:55:16] feet you know you supposed to make all
[1:55:19] your guests feel comfortable see they
[1:55:21] didn't have no room for him in the end
[1:55:23] they'd have no room for him in Simon's
[1:55:25] house and the church and got no room for
[1:55:27] him in the day but we need with the
[1:55:30] Simon's house and they just let him come
[1:55:32] on in with the dirty feet and he just
[1:55:34] sitting there and with them dirty feet
[1:55:36] and got his legs behind him and that
[1:55:38] lady that that that should she was not
[1:55:40] invited to that party she had a she had
[1:55:42] a rough life spout a didn't want her Kai
[1:55:44] at the party but she said I can't let
[1:55:47] him sit there with them dirty feet I got
[1:55:49] to do something about it and she went
[1:55:51] home and got her the little money she
[1:55:53] had been saving from some ill-fame
[1:55:55] living and she got I'm running together
[1:55:57] went down to the shopping and when the
[1:55:59] shop owner sitting out what what is it
[1:56:01] that she won't
[1:56:01] what is he say say get on out of here
[1:56:04] you know you we don't even stirred your
[1:56:05] kind but she open her little box and
[1:56:07] when he saw the money inside the box I
[1:56:10] said what can I do for you hallelujah
[1:56:13] people change when they see you money
[1:56:16] come on somebody but by a saying say
[1:56:19] what can we do pray say I just want the
[1:56:21] best
[1:56:21] pointment that you got and she got that
[1:56:23] perfume she bought it and she went down
[1:56:25] there to Jesus and MC and she snuck into
[1:56:28] the party but by the time she snuck in
[1:56:31] she ended up right at the place where
[1:56:34] his feet
[1:56:34] was right in front of her and she broke
[1:56:37] down in tears and she began to wipe his
[1:56:40] feet with her tears and with her styling
[1:56:45] just say now if he knew what kind of
[1:56:47] woman that was that was washing history
[1:56:51] if he really was a prophet then they
[1:56:54] begin to give some counsel who you think
[1:56:57] would be more appreciative you know a
[1:57:00] person that was forgiven little a person
[1:57:03] that was forgiven much which one you
[1:57:05] think would be more appreciated instead
[1:57:07] he say the one that that's forgiven much
[1:57:08] I think that'll be the one that the most
[1:57:10] preacher say well stance on so this
[1:57:12] woman had mini stance but her sins which
[1:57:15] were many are forgiven that's wonderful
[1:57:20] that's a wonderful counselor that's a
[1:57:27] wonderful counselor told her go and sin
[1:57:30] no more
[1:57:31] hallelujah it's gonna mighty God you
[1:57:35] know we was passing through the city as
[1:57:37] we were driving through Israel and I
[1:57:40] said that's the city of nain I say name
[1:57:42] I know Natan because Jesus happened to
[1:57:46] be passing through the city of nain one
[1:57:47] day and there was a mama she was already
[1:57:50] a she had already lost her husband and
[1:57:53] here she is walking through the city
[1:57:55] with na burying her boy her only son
[1:57:58] she's better and she just walked behind
[1:58:00] the casket crying but you know life and
[1:58:02] death when they meet something got to
[1:58:05] happen and from what from what I don't
[1:58:08] read in the scripture every time life in
[1:58:10] Jesus is life any time life crosses the
[1:58:13] path of death death always loses so when
[1:58:19] it crossed the path of this widow of
[1:58:21] nain he only did was just woke up and
[1:58:24] just touch the pyre the Bible said well
[1:58:27] lift up and begin to talk to his mama
[1:58:30] because lengthen
[1:58:31] the carpet that to me was a mighty God
[1:58:35] he had control over death
[1:58:38] [Music]
[1:58:42] that's a mighty God and I just loved
[1:58:48] this because the Bible could he was the
[1:58:50] everlasting father and my question is
[1:58:53] how can a son be an everlasting for her
[1:59:00] somebody said where he had to have
[1:59:02] children yeah he do have some children
[1:59:04] I'm one of him but that's not what
[1:59:07] Isaiah was talking about he called the
[1:59:10] son the everlasting father and if this
[1:59:13] son this baby this word being made flesh
[1:59:17] if this baby that's being born is the
[1:59:19] everlasting father what Isaiah is trying
[1:59:21] to tell us that Jesus was God well jesus
[1:59:27] said that himself he said it in John 10
[1:59:30] verse 30 says I and my father are one
[1:59:35] he also said in john 14:9 he says when
[1:59:41] you see me you know I mean they have to
[1:59:47] say would you just show us show us show
[1:59:50] us the father show us we want to see him
[1:59:53] we I mean we were grateful for you but
[1:59:56] we want to see the father yeah this time
[1:59:59] sitting out now I've been I've been so
[2:00:01] long with you just don't know me when
[2:00:04] you're looking at me you looking at the
[2:00:08] father Jesus and God were the same
[2:00:13] Jehovah of the Old Testament it's Jesus
[2:00:16] of the new he's the Prince of Peace and
[2:00:20] I'm so glad that he proved that when he
[2:00:22] walked on water and he come up with him
[2:00:25] disciples were a little freak the Bible
[2:00:27] say they were they were scared when you
[2:00:29] know hey they saw Jesus walking on water
[2:00:30] and he spoke to me so he says he says be
[2:00:34] of good cheer it is I be not afraid
[2:00:37] he spoke peace to this situation and
[2:00:40] they was peaceful
[2:00:41] it went from being fearful to peaceful
[2:00:45] it was so peaceful that Peter himself
[2:00:48] got out the boat and he start walking on
[2:00:53] the water
[2:00:54] he was experiencing the Prince of Peace
[2:00:58] unfortunate to his eyes off on them and
[2:01:00] they began to sink a little bit but even
[2:01:03] in sinking he could call his name and
[2:01:06] when he come up out that water
[2:01:08] I think Peter could see he's wonderful
[2:01:10] he's wonderful why does it say the
[2:01:16] government should be a punished order
[2:01:21] what this was it was signifying it was a
[2:01:25] an Eastern wedding traditions when the
[2:01:29] bride was surrendering herself to the
[2:01:32] groom the bride would take her veil and
[2:01:35] lay it on the shoulder of the groom and
[2:01:37] when she would lay her shoulder I mean
[2:01:40] lay that veil on the shoulder of the
[2:01:41] groom it transferred Authority it showed
[2:01:44] that she was under his Dominion Oh Lord
[2:01:47] I know people don't like hearing that
[2:01:49] anymore
[2:01:49] we got people nowadays when they get
[2:01:51] married they don't even want to take the
[2:01:53] husband's name actually the husband it's
[2:01:59] taking the wife name I've seen that
[2:02:02] happen the husband take the wife name
[2:02:05] that is so completely against the
[2:02:08] principles of God's Word Christians
[2:02:11] doing that
[2:02:13] Christian's going to I'm going to take
[2:02:15] my wife's name her family name is better
[2:02:17] than my family name or either you know
[2:02:24] it's just it's just really messed up but
[2:02:25] what suppose happened it was it was it
[2:02:27] was signifying that she was under the
[2:02:29] authority of her husband hallelujah Amen
[2:02:33] my thought is that if you can't take his
[2:02:35] name then you shouldn't marry him you
[2:02:38] ain't got respect enough to be able to
[2:02:40] take his name don't marry him praise the
[2:02:42] Lord
[2:02:42] listen it says so so where was the
[2:02:46] transfer of rights to the husband that
[2:02:48] he was now the head and not only that it
[2:02:51] was that he was the one that was going
[2:02:53] to bear the responsibility and the
[2:02:55] care he alone was gonna bear that so
[2:02:59] when Jesus when the Bible says that that
[2:03:02] the government shall be upon his
[2:03:04] shoulder it means that Jesus alone is
[2:03:06] the one that bears a responsibility and
[2:03:08] care for us that's why the government is
[2:03:12] on his shoulder Church he was wonderful
[2:03:15] he was a counselor a mighty God
[2:03:18] everlasting father Prince of Peace he
[2:03:21] was everything and and and more and I'm
[2:03:24] so glad that he is my Savior let me
[2:03:29] finish this off today the deity of Jesus
[2:03:32] Christ I want you to understand
[2:03:33] something we're not no I mean I went
[2:03:36] looking for this little spot that they
[2:03:39] say Jesus was born that's all very
[2:03:41] little I couldn't even take a picture of
[2:03:42] it you know it was that small I couldn't
[2:03:44] take a picture but I couldn't even get
[2:03:46] my camera through that little hole to
[2:03:47] try to take a picture of the show that's
[2:03:49] that's where Jesus born no when I look
[2:03:51] at you I can see what Jesus was born
[2:03:56] because in you the word has become flesh
[2:04:00] all over again the word has become flesh
[2:04:03] Oh glory glory glory glory last week we
[2:04:07] heard a powerful testimony sister uh
[2:04:11] sister Hannah you know she was she had
[2:04:14] some some cloth she needed to make
[2:04:17] something she was short a few yards I
[2:04:19] think about three yards and I mean a lot
[2:04:20] of material there's like Lord I need to
[2:04:23] get this thing done and I don't have the
[2:04:24] materia and she just praying and and and
[2:04:26] just not not sure which way to go and

[2:04:32] of go back and work with that coffin and
[2:04:33] I don't know if she had the spoke to it
[2:04:35] or whatever she did somehow that cloth
[2:04:38] multiplied the cloth multiplied in that
[2:04:44] sisters hands that's the same God that
[2:04:47] multiplied fish and Lowe's showing that
[2:04:51] he was the same yesterday today and
[2:04:52] forever
[2:04:53] what is that the word being made flesh
[2:04:54] and huh and if God can do that for
[2:04:57] sister Hannah
[2:04:57] whatever you need God can do the same
[2:05:01] thing for you listen listen but the word
[2:05:04] is made flesh in you no longer is he in

[2:05:28] power of God say it's wrong but that
[2:05:30] same power that spoke the world into

[2:05:34] the Holy Ghost

[2:08:04] for the real story but God we realized
[2:08:07] our God our Creator came and human flesh
[2:08:14] and it's very purpose for doing that was
[2:08:17] to come as a redeemer to die for our
[2:08:21] sins we were a lost people we were a
[2:08:24] hopeless people we were a helpless
