[44:49] that's there's certain things that
[44:51] happen in church and it become viral you
[44:55] know there there there there I know that
[44:58] there was one chair that I saw and I uh
[45:00] when I was here setting up on on um
[45:03] Friday me and brother Quinton uh one of
[45:06] them was a little uh wobbly so I tried
[45:09] to move it out of here so it didn't end
[45:12] up and I want to just tell uh the other
[45:15] brothers uh when you're setting up
[45:16] notice all the little details don't just
[45:20] throw a chair down right but think I
[45:23] could sit in this chair and you know I
[45:25] don't want no mistakes so just notice
[45:27] every little detail uh we want everybody
[45:30] to be safe you know here and and one day
[45:32] we we'll have our our chance the ones
[45:35] that we bought right but we we uh we
[45:39] looking we looking forward to that uh I
[45:42] um I want to say thank the Lord for
[45:44] bringing us all back safely uh from our
[45:48] journey and as you can see the change of
[45:51] weather over there was very um cold it
[45:55] was rainy
[45:57] uh it was uh it was a lot different from
[45:59] being in Florida and uh so many the the
[46:02] the Saints uh are fighting with
[46:05] everything they got to to stay well and
[46:09] uh we thank the Lord for them pressing
[46:10] their way out the church and and I don't
[46:12] want you to fear uh I know brother
[46:15] Quinton he's not here today and he he he
[46:16] went and got tested and and um they they
[46:20] say you got covid and they said no you
[46:21] don't have covid you got three viruses
[46:24] and like what in the world is this three
[46:27] viruses so I say brother this ain't
[46:29] nothing but the devil and uh we just
[46:32] going to keep claiming the victory over
[46:35] every cough over every
[46:39] sneeze over every pain uh every every
[46:42] time you cough just say by Stripes I'm
[46:45] heal amen just keep confessing that word
[46:48] until your body come in line with your
[46:50] confession amen praise the Lord uh so
[46:54] just keep all the saints in prayer and
[46:56] uh we but but anytime you go and you
[46:59] know and and and we had wonderful
[47:02] Services were very very very uh good
[47:06] services and um anytime you do damage to
[47:10] the devil's Kingdom you have to expect
[47:13] that he going to try to do some damage
[47:14] to you and and everybody that went on
[47:17] that trip you are a Target you need to
[47:21] understand that you are a target for the
[47:23] devil and and and uh uh so so you know
[47:26] we realize
[47:27] uh this is part of the battle but we
[47:29] claim
[47:31] victory amen we claim victory um there
[47:35] was a um prayer request that came in to
[47:38] me um actually a couple things that came
[47:41] in while we were away I got a a a email
[47:45] uh from sister Melissa and she was
[47:48] saying that her daughter sister Lily uh
[47:51] wanted to be baptized and we want to
[47:54] make uh a time for that uh uh I I don't
[47:58] have the exact text I mean the email in

[48:04] I can get back into uh Church uh be a
[48:07] little bit more faithful and she used
[48:09] the term I can get back in

[48:27] believe the Lord's going to help us to
[48:29] see uh more of that you know in the
[48:30] weeks to come uh and uh so we want to

[1:00:45] certainly
[1:00:46] appreciate the word of the Lord coming
[1:00:49] from him and there's a particular quote
[1:00:51] that he was referring to about you know
[1:00:54] that little hickey that happened
[1:00:56] and I when I heard brother Troy come
[1:00:58] back and bring it you know uh uh he was
[1:01:00] reading and I don't know if they C it to
[1:01:02] put it on the screen but man that's a
[1:01:04] powerful quote that is a very powerful
[1:01:06] quote to just kind of think about it but
[1:01:08] the grace of God is what has uh bring us
[1:01:11] back to this perfect State there's a
[1:01:13] there's a uh like he said the theme of
[1:01:15] the scriptures restoration that when we
[1:01:18] catch that just very it seemed like it's
[1:01:20] uh simple but it's it's powerful the

[1:01:31] certain place in him we're living
[1:01:35] millions of miles beneath our privileges

[1:02:53] that which the uh pal warmath left hath
[1:02:56] the Locust eaten and that which the
[1:02:58] Locust hath left hath the korm eaten
[1:03:00] that which the cankerworm ha left hath
[1:03:03] the caterpillar eaten uh going on to
[1:03:06] Joel 2 uh here and just uh catching
[1:03:11] verse
[1:03:12] 23 uh be glad then ye children of Zion
[1:03:15] and rejoice in the Lord your God for
[1:03:16] Heath given
[1:03:18] you uh the former rain model and he will
[1:03:20] cause to come down for you the rain the
[1:03:22] former rain and the latter rain in the
[1:03:24] first month and the floors shall be full
[1:03:27] of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with
[1:03:29] wine and oil and I just love this and I
[1:03:32] will restore to you the years that the
[1:03:35] Locust have eaten the cankerworm and the
[1:03:37] caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great
[1:03:39] Army which I sent among you and uh ye
[1:03:42] shall eat and plenty and be satisfied

[1:03:49] people should never be ashamed and ye
[1:03:52] shall know that I am in the midst of
[1:03:55] Israel and that I am the Lord your God
[1:03:57] and none else and my people should never
[1:03:59] be ashamed let's just quickly
[1:04:02] pray father we are grateful for the uh
[1:04:05] privilege to be able to read the word
[1:04:08] but we know um it takes the Holy Ghost
[1:04:11] to make the word live for us even uh
[1:04:15] today so God help us to hear what the
[1:04:18] spirit is trying to speak for this
[1:04:20] moment we take control over every Spirit
[1:04:23] that's against the spirit of God and we
[1:04:25] ask that the that you would have
[1:04:26] preeminence Amen in this portion of the
[1:04:29] service as you've done in uh the the the
[1:04:32] prior uh part of the service so God just
[1:04:34] get all the glory and all the honor uh
[1:04:36] hide us behind the cross that we might
[1:04:38] not be seen but may Christ be on full
[1:04:39] display in Jesus name we pray amen you
[1:04:43] can be seated you can be seated um as
[1:04:46] you can see on my opening slide uh we
[1:04:49] are still in this theme of get back in
[1:04:52] step and um as I just mentioned here um
[1:04:57] I I believe you know as I was looking at
[1:05:00] this um I I I saw that one quote where
[1:05:03] brother brandom said uh the bride got
[1:05:06] back in Step may she get back in step
[1:05:08] and uh and see she got out of Step just
[1:05:10] like they did in the wildness you know
[1:05:12] journey and as I as I was looking at
[1:05:14] that that's where this whole thing just
[1:05:17] began to come uh to me but the deeper I
[1:05:20] go into it the more I see how this is
[1:05:25] not just a spiritual condition of the
[1:05:28] church uh but it moves down into a uh a
[1:05:32] personal spiritual condition Hallelujah
[1:05:36] sometimes we have a general uh spir
[1:05:39] spiritual condition of what God has done
[1:05:40] through the church ages but uh but as I
[1:05:43] look at this more and more it starts
[1:05:45] getting down into a personal spiritual
[1:05:48] condition Now understand generally the
[1:05:51] bride cannot get back and step uh unless
[1:05:55] uh uh the bride begins to apply some
[1:05:58] things personally in her life and and
[1:06:01] here here's what here's what I'm going
[1:06:02] to do this morning I'm going to call all
[1:06:05] of y'all bride all
[1:06:09] right all right amen and order to call
[1:06:12] All of You bride then there there are
[1:06:14] certain things that we have to um we
[1:06:17] have to um just begin to deal with amen
[1:06:21] so I forgot to set my timer and let me
[1:06:24] do that right now so that I don't run
[1:06:26] over time here today but uh we going we
[1:06:29] going to take our time and get through
[1:06:30] this so I I I read uh these scriptures
[1:06:33] in
[1:06:34] Joel however uh for this morning uh I
[1:06:39] kind of have two little thoughts that
[1:06:40] I'm kind of putting together in this one
[1:06:42] sermon and I trust it'll be a blessing
[1:06:44] for you let let us go forward because we
[1:06:47] stopped at verse 27 but I think for
[1:06:50] today it would be very appropriate for
[1:06:52] us to read verse 28 through3 2 amen and
[1:06:57] it says and it shall come to pass
[1:07:00] afterward Hallelujah that I will pour
[1:07:04] out my spirit upon All Flesh and your
[1:07:09] sons and your daughters shall prophesy
[1:07:13] amen your old men shall dream dream
[1:07:17] dreams and your young men shall see
[1:07:19] Visions now uh here when we look at this
[1:07:21] scripture this is a a prophecy that
[1:07:24] happened on the day at Pentecost but
[1:07:26] nonetheless it's a prophecy that we
[1:07:28] still expect to happen today now as we
[1:07:30] go through this series uh really in my
[1:07:33] heart I want to tell you I want to get
[1:07:34] back to that part of where uh uh the
[1:07:38] restoration included the gifts of the
[1:07:41] Spirit so there's going to be a real
[1:07:44] Focus I want to bring into to that you
[1:07:46] know at at some point in time but before
[1:07:49] I can get to the gifts of the Spirit
[1:07:51] amen we got to talk about the brotherly
[1:07:53] kindness hello sir somebody we got to
[1:07:56] talk about the unity we got to talk
[1:07:59] about all those things before we can get
[1:08:00] to the gifts of the Spirit otherwise we
[1:08:03] got our cart way before the horse right
[1:08:06] and and and so so we got we got to put
[1:08:07] all these things in line because the
[1:08:09] restoration brings back it brings back
[1:08:11] the brotherly kindness it brings back
[1:08:14] the the unity the Divine Fellowship in
[1:08:16] the church oh I know what I'm talking
[1:08:18] about amen it brings back that
[1:08:21] restoration brings all that back plus it
[1:08:23] brings the gifts of the Spirit and then
[1:08:25] on top of that it brings the fullness of
[1:08:27] the word right so we getting all this
[1:08:30] amen but but we just can't we can't jump
[1:08:32] all the way to the gifts of the Spirit
[1:08:33] without talking about amen Unity without
[1:08:36] talking about brotherly kindness and
[1:08:38] things of that nature Hallelujah so
[1:08:41] y'all ready for the journey all right
[1:08:43] let's go on now and it shall come to
[1:08:46] pass cuz this is part of restoration now
[1:08:49] after word that I will I'm looking for
[1:08:52] it pour out my spirit upon all flesh and
[1:08:56] your sons and your daughters shall
[1:08:57] prophesy your old men shall dream dreams
[1:09:00] your young men shall see visions and
[1:09:02] also upon the service of upon the
[1:09:03] handmaids in those days will I pour out
[1:09:05] my spirit and I will show wonders in the
[1:09:10] heavens and in the earth blood and fire
[1:09:13] and pillars of smoke the sun shall be
[1:09:16] turned into darkness and the moon into
[1:09:21] blood and this is supposed to happen
[1:09:23] before the great and terrible day of the
[1:09:25] Lord come and it shall come to pass that
[1:09:29] whosoever shall call amen hallelujah on
[1:09:33] the name of the Lord shall be delivered
[1:09:36] for in Mount Zion and I like that
[1:09:38] promise I like that promise it it didn't
[1:09:40] say that uh uh you come and tell God I
[1:09:43] got this problem I got that problem I
[1:09:45] need deliverance from this I need
[1:09:47] deliver I I'm really really bound it
[1:09:49] don't care how deep in sin you are if
[1:09:52] you just call on the name of the Lord
[1:09:56] you shall be delivered for in Mount Zion
[1:09:59] and in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as
[1:10:03] the Lord have said and in the remnant
[1:10:04] whom the Lord shall call now um I I I'm
[1:10:09] looking at verse uh verse 30 and 31 in
[1:10:14] in Joel 2 there was talking about the
[1:10:17] wonders in the heavens and in the earth
[1:10:19] blood and fire pillars of smoke so y'all
[1:10:22] already with
[1:10:23] me that's why it say it's very
[1:10:25] appropriate for us to read this
[1:10:26] scripture for
[1:10:29] today Hallelujah the sun shall be turned
[1:10:32] in the darkness amen and the moon into
[1:10:35] blood before the great and terrible day
[1:10:38] of the Lord now so before uh the second
[1:10:42] coming of the Lord there are supposed to
[1:10:44] be things that happen that when we see
[1:10:47] them happen it should cause us to want
[1:10:50] to draw a little closer to God right ah
[1:10:53] help me Jesus amen so so here the
[1:10:55] scripture tells us that these things are
[1:10:57] going to be happening we will watch them
[1:10:59] happen but I don't want us to be so
[1:11:02] unspiritual that we miss what God is
[1:11:05] trying to do in this hour all right so
[1:11:07] we're going to talk a little bit about
[1:11:08] some natural things that are happening
[1:11:10] but let's look at some scriptures here
[1:11:12] and look at some quotes so here uh this
[1:11:14] verse 30 and verse 31 connects amen with
[1:11:18] the scripture over in Matthew 24 praise
[1:11:21] God Amen and Jesus speaks of these
[1:11:24] things amen before his second coming in
[1:11:27] verse 29 it says immediately after the
[1:11:29] tribulation of those days shall the sun
[1:11:33] be darken amen and the moon shall not
[1:11:36] give her light and the Stars shall fall
[1:11:39] from Heaven and the powers of the heaven
[1:11:41] shall be shaken and then shall appear
[1:11:45] the sign of the son of man in heaven and
[1:11:47] then shall all the tribes of the earth
[1:11:49] mourn and they shall see the son of man
[1:11:51] coming in the Clouds Of Heaven which
[1:11:53] with power and great Glory now um I'm
[1:11:57] going to go ahead of myself and just say
[1:11:59] this what we're looking at in verse 29
[1:12:01] are things that are supposed to happen
[1:12:03] before the Great Tribulation amen uh uh
[1:12:07] uh right now we're all you know we're we
[1:12:08] we we're enduring a many tribulation
[1:12:10] ourselves just a different tests and
[1:12:12] trials that we go through it's just a
[1:12:14] many tribulation but there's a Great
[1:12:16] Tribulation that's promised after the
[1:12:17] bride is taken home but before Israel is
[1:12:20] dealt with again the Bible tells us in
[1:12:23] verse 29 immediately after the
[1:12:24] tribulation those days shall the sun be
[1:12:26] darkened and the moon shall not give a
[1:12:27] light and the Stars shall fall from
[1:12:29] Heaven and the pows of the heaven shall
[1:12:31] be shaken and then shall appear the sign
[1:12:34] of the son of man in heaven and then
[1:12:36] shall all the tribes of the earth mourn
[1:12:37] and they shall see the son of man coming
[1:12:40] in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and
[1:12:42] great glory and he shall send his angels
[1:12:46] I like that just just the mere fact that
[1:12:48] it says Angels uh we already know this
[1:12:51] is Moses and Elijah amen and he shall
[1:12:54] send his Ang angels with the great sound
[1:12:56] of a trumpet and they shall gather
[1:12:58] together his elect from the Four Winds
[1:13:01] from one end of Heaven to the other now
[1:13:03] learn a parable of the Fig Tree when his
[1:13:05] branch is yet tender and put forth
[1:13:08] leaves ye know that some is nigh so
[1:13:10] likewise when ye when ye shall see these
[1:13:13] things know that it is near even at the
[1:13:16] doors so when we see these signs in the
[1:13:19] heavens we see these uh uh uh things
[1:13:22] happening with the with the moon and
[1:13:23] with the sun we see these signs there
[1:13:25] there's things these are these are H uh
[1:13:27] indicators that the second cominging of
[1:13:29] Lord is upon us
[1:13:32] hallelujah amen we got to be ready for
[1:13:35] this uh for this coming of the Lord
[1:13:37] there there are some things that we're
[1:13:38] going to have to kind of get cleaned
[1:13:41] out glory to God Amen we got to go back
[1:13:44] and bring the brotherly kindness back
[1:13:45] into the church we got to go back and
[1:13:48] get the unity and bring it back into the
[1:13:49] church and then we can see the gifts
[1:13:52] operate hallelujah we're not Pentecostal
[1:13:55] here this is the bride of Christ amen in
[1:13:58] Pentecost you can live any kind of life
[1:14:00] you wanted to and still manifest in the
[1:14:02] gifts but not here in the message we
[1:14:05] can't do it like that amen we want to be
[1:14:07] like Christ in everything we do amen so
[1:14:10] now let's look at this with signs in the
[1:14:14] heavens glory to God uh brother Brandon
[1:14:17] makes a statement here in a in a in a
[1:14:20] question that's ask them in questions
[1:14:22] and answers on Genesis and they're
[1:14:24] asking specific about Matthew
[1:14:27] 24:29 and it says uh Matthew 24:29
[1:14:31] speaks of the sun being dark and the
[1:14:33] moon shall not give her light and the
[1:14:35] Stars shall fall from heaven will this
[1:14:38] happen before or after the Rapture they
[1:14:40] want to know this or just before Jesus
[1:14:43] comes to Reign on earth now brother man
[1:14:45] say to my humble belief now uh I don't
[1:14:48] know I think he's speaking of Matthew 24
[1:14:51] there now Jesus speaking of the stars
[1:14:54] and things Fallen I believe that is just
[1:14:58] before the tribulation period sets on
[1:15:01] the earth so before the Great
[1:15:04] Tribulation that is just before the
[1:15:06] Great Tribulation oh my I I don't have
[1:15:09] time to go into it but I can tell y'all
[1:15:12] the next great event that we are looking
[1:15:14] for according to scripture is the
[1:15:16] rapture the completion of the Rapture as
[1:15:19] brother Troy said last week we already
[1:15:20] in the Rapture but the completion of it
[1:15:23] because it's a three-phase process a
[1:15:26] shout a voice and a trump glory to God
[1:15:29] but in the completion of that amen
[1:15:32] there's some things that need to happen
[1:15:34] before that completes and we're waiting
[1:15:35] for that great event one of these
[1:15:38] mornings it won't be long you'll look
[1:15:40] for me and I'll be gone in the moment in
[1:15:44] the twinkling of an eye I'll be changed
[1:15:47] I got to live daily ready I can't be
[1:15:51] getting ready I got to be ready
[1:15:54] Hallelujah it says I believe that is
[1:15:56] just before the tribulation period sets
[1:15:58] on earth now I have a real funny thought
[1:16:01] here that many of you are going to
[1:16:03] disagree with me on this I imagine some
[1:16:05] of the old Thom has heard teaching that
[1:16:07] we went through it see I don't believe
[1:16:09] the church would go through the
[1:16:10] tribulation period I believe the church
[1:16:12] will the only way I teach the New
[1:16:15] Testament is by Old Testament Shadow
[1:16:17] just like the Holy Ghost here for the
[1:16:18] Sabbath day and so forth everything is a
[1:16:20] shadow back there so what he said the
[1:16:22] church will go through the tribulation
[1:16:25] but the brides will catch a
[1:16:29] Rapture the church will go through a
[1:16:32] tribulation but the bride oh Lord help
[1:16:35] us there we we got to understand amen
[1:16:39] just scripture terms uh it's only the
[1:16:42] bride that makes herself ready it's only
[1:16:46] the bride that can get back in step and
[1:16:49] the way that the bride gets back in step
[1:16:51] is based on what she hears that's why
[1:16:54] it's important for us to feed the bride
[1:16:57] bride
[1:16:58] food Hallelujah because based on what
[1:17:00] she hears that allows her to get back in
[1:17:04] Step hallelujah amen it's it's not it's
[1:17:07] not the prophet screaming at you it's
[1:17:09] you having something on the inside of
[1:17:12] you screaming back to the word I got to
[1:17:14] line up with
[1:17:17] this you got something that cause you to
[1:17:19] get back in tune amen wait a minute I'm
[1:17:22] out of I'm out of tune right now I'm not
[1:17:24] where I'm supposed to be spiritually and
[1:17:27] and and many of us recognize these
[1:17:28] things I can I can say it from my own
[1:17:31] self there's things in my life that I
[1:17:32] don't like I need to get rid of this
[1:17:36] stuff Hallelujah I want to stay in Step
[1:17:39] because the Rapture is at hand We Don't
[1:17:42] Preach about the Rapture enough amen the
[1:17:44] Rapture is at hand church it's the next
[1:17:47] great event that we're waiting for the
[1:17:50] completion of this Rapture now brother
[1:17:53] brandom tells us that he believed this
[1:17:55] Matthew
[1:17:56] 24:29 amen is something that
[1:17:59] happens uh before the tribulation period
[1:18:02] set in these are signs in the
[1:18:07] sky
[1:18:08] Hallelujah glory to God and here we have
[1:18:12] one that's going to happen
[1:18:14] tomorrow glory to God it doesn't come
[1:18:17] through very
[1:18:18] clear but uh what we're expecting
[1:18:21] tomorrow amen is a a a solar eclipse and
[1:18:26] what they call a
[1:18:27] total total solar eclipse now these
[1:18:30] don't happen that often I'm going to
[1:18:33] read something here in the future the in
[1:18:35] in in in in in my next Slide the next
[1:18:37] the next one that's supposed to happen
[1:18:39] is going to be uh 20 20 I mean
[1:18:41] 2044 so 20 years from now these things
[1:18:44] don't happen that often so when they do
[1:18:46] happen we have to take notice of it cuz
[1:18:50] sometimes God's trying to speak to his
[1:18:52] people oh God help us here so I'm I mean
[1:18:56] we got to we put it right back in
[1:18:57] scripture and try to show hey this is
[1:18:59] what this is what was promised according
[1:19:01] to Joel according to Matthew 24 these
[1:19:03] are the things that were promised now
[1:19:04] we're seeing that happen right before
[1:19:06] our very eyes now what what happens in
[1:19:09] this total solar eclipse amen is uh you
[1:19:11] can see the sun here and the moon here
[1:19:14] and the Earth there and what happens is
[1:19:16] that the moon gets in between uh the the
[1:19:19] Sun and the Earth Hallelujah and when
[1:19:22] that happens glory to God Amen man when
[1:19:25] that happens you can't see it on this
[1:19:26] diagram but this part just goes dark
[1:19:31] right here on the earth and whoever's in
[1:19:32] that part of the earth they'll just see
[1:19:35] total darkness for about four or five
[1:19:37] minutes hallelujah hallelujah I I need
[1:19:40] you to understand something about about
[1:19:42] the Sun and the Moon the Moon is I'm
[1:19:44] going to read this in a second is 400
[1:19:47] times smaller than the
[1:19:49] sun 400 times smaller than the Sun so
[1:19:52] that means there's no way that the Moon
[1:19:54] can totally black out the sun only for a
[1:19:58] certain
[1:19:59] spot
[1:20:01] hallelujah amen the Sun going to
[1:20:03] constantly be shining amen only for a
[1:20:06] certain spot praise God and it only
[1:20:09] happens when this this this this this
[1:20:11] this this solar eclipse occurs now here
[1:20:14] let me um uh I I I want to just kind of
[1:20:17] mention something here you know I'm
[1:20:19] going to I was just trying to look at
[1:20:21] some of this like what's some of the
[1:20:22] significance of of this you know and um
[1:20:27] when you really go out there on the
[1:20:28] website out there searching the internet
[1:20:30] they have all kind of things you got to
[1:20:31] be so
[1:20:33] careful because there's so many new age
[1:20:36] teachings on these type of things what
[1:20:38] I'm going to do is not take you to New
[1:20:40] Age teaching I'm going to take you to a
[1:20:42] old age teaching I'm going to take you
[1:20:45] to what a prophet
[1:20:47] said but just notice this is something
[1:20:49] this is something that does not happen
[1:20:51] but it said the scripture tells us that
[1:20:53] there would be wonders in the the
[1:20:54] heavens and in the earth blood and fire
[1:20:56] pillows of smoke it also said uh that
[1:20:59] the sun would be the sun shall be
[1:21:01] darkened and the moons shall not give
[1:21:03] her light now let's look at this I went
[1:21:06] uh and just try to get some facts and
[1:21:08] some some some significance of the solar
[1:21:11] eclipse and it said um and and here I'm
[1:21:14] going to tell you another thing that I
[1:21:15] do I don't know nothing about none of
[1:21:19] this so in order me to learn I got to go
[1:21:22] to Children's websites
[1:21:25] hello I go to kids websites and I find
[1:21:29] out if if it can be taught to a child it
[1:21:31] can be taught to
[1:21:33] me praise the Lord so I went to a
[1:21:35] child's website like what are some of
[1:21:36] the significant things that they want
[1:21:38] kids to know about this it said at it
[1:21:40] very simplest when the moon gets in
[1:21:42] between the Earth and the Sun and the
[1:21:44] Moon
[1:21:45] appears to pass the pass over the Sun as
[1:21:49] seen from the earth then we get a solar
[1:21:51] eclipse now I I underline that that it
[1:21:54] appear cuz when it's in darkness it may
[1:21:56] feel like the sun is being blocked no
[1:21:59] the Moon is not large
[1:22:02] enough to block amen the light of the
[1:22:05] sun now now I'm going to go a little
[1:22:07] further the Moon represent the
[1:22:11] church the church is not large enough to
[1:22:14] block the light of the s o n and I don't
[1:22:18] care how far the church gets away from
[1:22:20] the word the church is not large enough
[1:22:23] to block the light of the s o
[1:22:28] n somebody going to see some light and
[1:22:31] somebody going to come out of that
[1:22:33] denomination somebody going to come out
[1:22:35] of that system I don't care how much
[1:22:38] they've been blinded and how long
[1:22:40] they've been blinded it cannot stop the
[1:22:43] penetration of light of the S so
[1:22:46] N I like that here the moon I got this
[1:22:51] next one the Moon is 400 times smaller
[1:22:52] than the Sun and and they they said
[1:22:54] where the way you have to look at it's
[1:22:56] like a basketball and a tennis ball if
[1:22:58] you put two of them in your hand it's no
[1:23:00] way that tennis ball can block all the
[1:23:03] shadow of the basketball praise the Lord
[1:23:06] this next one says as the moon blocks
[1:23:08] the Sun's light It cast The Shadow on
[1:23:12] part of the earth not the full Earth but
[1:23:15] on you got to be in a in a certain realm
[1:23:17] to be able to see this amen but it only
[1:23:20] blocks it castes Shadow on part of the
[1:23:22] earth praise God uh here the other one
[1:23:25] uh the the moon's uh the Moon Shadow
[1:23:28] creates a trail as the Earth is rotating
[1:23:32] and this Trail is called the path of
[1:23:34] totality amen so it's total darkness
[1:23:37] only for a certain section but not
[1:23:39] everybody oh my my my my my this is so
[1:23:43] important now I'm I'm going tell y'all
[1:23:45] something here I'm going read a quote
[1:23:46] here in a second but the quote that I
[1:23:48] read has been
[1:23:50] challenged when brother bradam said and
[1:23:52] if you go out to the websites you might
[1:23:54] find somebody challenging that quote and
[1:23:56] they say well you know and they said
[1:23:58] Brother Brad I'm trying to prove his
[1:23:59] Doctrine on the seven Church agents with
[1:24:01] this quote and they said uh they said uh
[1:24:04] if there was a a blackout it should have
[1:24:07] happened in Jerusalem now God don't when
[1:24:10] God said that his that when he promised
[1:24:12] this according to uh to Joel 2 and also
[1:24:15] he promised it according to to Matthew
[1:24:17] 24 it didn't say what city was going to
[1:24:19] happen
[1:24:20] in but that don't stop the word of God
[1:24:23] from being perform performed
[1:24:24] now where we living at we might not see
[1:24:27] much of this Darkness but there are some
[1:24:29] people in the US they in that they in
[1:24:31] that path amen they're in a path they're
[1:24:34] going to experience total darkness but
[1:24:36] others may not see it but does that mean
[1:24:38] the scripture not being
[1:24:40] fulfilled
[1:24:43] hallu just because you not seeing don't
[1:24:46] mean the scripture not being
[1:24:47] fulfilled right and what you want to do
[1:24:49] you want to catch up I mean they they
[1:24:51] trying to Chace they they they were
[1:24:53] chasing the PO we chasing a prophet and
[1:24:56] what a prophet is saying look at this
[1:24:58] let me keep going on now the Moon Shadow
[1:25:00] creates a trailer as the Earth rotates
[1:25:02] this Trail is called the path of
[1:25:04] totality the next one the path of
[1:25:06] totality will cross three countries
[1:25:09] Mexico Canada and the US all three
[1:25:12] countries be affected by the solar
[1:25:14] eclipse all of
[1:25:16] them another one um in that path the
[1:25:20] moon completely blocks the Sun's light
[1:25:22] for a few minutes it gets so dark that
[1:25:25] it looks like nighttime during a full
[1:25:28] moon
[1:25:30] wow and it happens for about four or
[1:25:32] five minutes say even nature get
[1:25:34] confused when it happens my God watch
[1:25:38] this now uh and the last one says after
[1:25:40] this this April spectacle the next total
[1:25:44] solar eclipse to cross the continuous uh
[1:25:47] contiguous us will not occur until
[1:25:52] 2044 now I say acrossing the us now it
[1:25:54] might be others Ur uh in other places
[1:25:57] but across in the US it's 2044 but yet
[1:26:00] and still we see in the word of God
[1:26:02] being made manifest right before our
[1:26:05] very eyes
[1:26:08] now let's go to like I told
[1:26:11] you
[1:26:14] uh when you if you go out there and you
[1:26:16] start reading all types of websites
[1:26:18] follow all kind of things you got to be
[1:26:20] careful because there's a lot of new age
[1:26:22] material coming your way
[1:26:24] and you start trying to tie tie into
[1:26:26] some of this new age stuff and you you
[1:26:28] way off base so for me when I see things
[1:26:32] like this I always go back to what a
[1:26:34] prophet said so I found it in the church
[1:26:36] A's book The Prophet dealt with this in
[1:26:40] 1964 glory to God now he made a
[1:26:43] statement there in 1964 that they're
[1:26:45] again they're challenging his statement
[1:26:47] but I I'm not watching a pope I'm
[1:26:49] watching a
[1:26:51] prophet watch this now Matthew 24
[1:26:54] mentioned signs in the heavens
[1:26:55] concerning this last day just before
[1:26:57] Jesus comes I wonder if you noticed such
[1:27:00] a sign recently fulfilled as to portray
[1:27:02] the very truth that we uh we have been
[1:27:04] discussing that truth is that Jesus has
[1:27:07] been steadily pushed aside until in the
[1:27:10] last age he is pushed outside the church
[1:27:13] amen recall that in the first age it was
[1:27:16] almost a full ored Church of Truth yet
[1:27:20] there was a little error called the
[1:27:22] Deeds of the nicians that kept that kept
[1:27:25] the circle from being full then in the
[1:27:28] next age more Darkness crept in until
[1:27:32] the ball of light glowed less and
[1:27:35] darkness covered more of the circle in
[1:27:38] the third age it was eclips till still
[1:27:41] more and in the fourth age which was the
[1:27:44] Dark Ages the light had all but gone now
[1:27:47] I'm reading a quote but I thought it'd
[1:27:48] be very appropriate if I gave you a
[1:27:51] picture of what the prophet is saying
[1:27:55] Hallelujah let's see here uh I might
[1:27:59] have okay I might have got
[1:28:02] myself that's good did you did you for
[1:28:04] it
[1:28:05] twice okay all right no problem so so
[1:28:07] here uh I want to just kind of get this
[1:28:10] so brother Brandon was just talking
[1:28:11] about how uh this light was just I mean
[1:28:15] it was almost like a full moon in the
[1:28:17] first age he's talking about the Ephesus
[1:28:20] age it's almost a full moon almost full
[1:28:23] light just a little sliver of darkness
[1:28:26] and then we get to the next Church age
[1:28:27] irius is the messenger there it goes to
[1:28:31] amen a little little Moon little bit
[1:28:33] more darkness and then the third age it
[1:28:37] goes less Moon and more darkness sett in
[1:28:41] to finally get to and this is in your
[1:28:44] history lesson the Dark
[1:28:47] Ages that's back in your school history
[1:28:50] lesson in the Dark Ages it's just almost
[1:28:53] complete darkness and a small sliver of
[1:28:56] light this is what happened in the Dark
[1:28:58] Ages however when Luther came my God in
[1:29:01] Revelation chapter 3 this is all part of
[1:29:04] the restoration church but and when
[1:29:06] Luther came he began to break away from
[1:29:09] the denominational teachings hallelujah
[1:29:12] amen because here if you was not
[1:29:14] Catholic you were dead the Catholics
[1:29:17] killed everybody that did not agree with
[1:29:19] them so when Luther came along he broke
[1:29:21] away from his Catholic teachers that's
[1:29:23] why I said a little bit of light when it
[1:29:26] leaves Luther's amen Sardis age then it
[1:29:29] goes to West you can see a little bit
[1:29:31] more light coming in justification came
[1:29:33] in in Luther's day Wesley brought in
[1:29:36] sanctification Hallelujah they got a
[1:29:38] little bit more like but then when it
[1:29:40] hit this last day brother brandom's day
[1:29:42] Hallelujah glory to God the reason amen
[1:29:46] that it's only a little light there I'm
[1:29:47] going to read the quote he says because
[1:29:49] the light start growing then all of a
[1:29:51] sudden it
[1:29:53] stopped
[1:29:54] it says it start growing the reason that
[1:29:57] the light start growing because the
[1:29:58] fullness of the word came back into the
[1:30:01] church everything they had at this age
[1:30:05] it came back at this age and there's
[1:30:08] only very few people with that let me
[1:30:11] tell you something it was only very few
[1:30:12] people at this age that had the truth
[1:30:15] only very few at that age that had the
[1:30:17] truth amen it's only very few that's
[1:30:19] walking in the the full truth part we
[1:30:22] have some that's walking in truth right
[1:30:25] every denominational church out there
[1:30:28] has part truth my question is to you do
[1:30:31] you want part truth or whole truth amen
[1:30:34] amen amen cuz see the Bible actually
[1:30:37] tells us when that which is perfect is
[1:30:39] come that which is in part is done away
[1:30:42] with so here the full truth came back
[1:30:46] but because people rejected the walk in
[1:30:48] that full truth that's why you see more
[1:30:50] more Darkness than light now let's go on
[1:30:52] and read a little bit more here in these
[1:30:55] in these
[1:30:56] quotes
[1:30:58] uh I think I had a I'm not sure I'm
[1:31:01] going Slide N I don't know if that's
[1:31:03] right uh okay right now think on this
[1:31:06] the church shines in the reflected Light
[1:31:08] of Christ he is the sun he is the son
[1:31:12] Christ is the sun all right the church
[1:31:16] is the moon so when you see these things
[1:31:18] happening in the natural uh just the sun
[1:31:21] is Christ the Moon is is the church and
[1:31:25] the church is blocking the
[1:31:28] view of the
[1:31:31] sun when you have a total eclipse it's
[1:31:35] the church blocking the view of the sun
[1:31:37] now what does revelation 3 tell us that
[1:31:39] Christ was on the outside of his own
[1:31:41] church knocking trying to get back in
[1:31:45] now now now the only way that that could
[1:31:46] happen is that the church somehow the
[1:31:49] church oh my God the church put Jesus
[1:31:53] out
[1:31:55] how did the church now they they go in
[1:31:57] there and they they they they worship
[1:31:58] and they praise God and and they have
[1:32:01] great music and they do all these things
[1:32:04] but how the bible say that they put
[1:32:06] Jesus out how did they put Jesus out
[1:32:10] when they
[1:32:11] rejected the
[1:32:17] word how do they reject the
[1:32:20] word if they got a woman
[1:32:22] preacher
[1:32:24] am if they got a woman preaching they
[1:32:26] rejected the word because the Bible say
[1:32:29] I suffer not a woman to do
[1:32:31] that right I mean I mean uh if they oh
[1:32:35] Lord have mercy God help me Jesus how
[1:32:37] they reject the
[1:32:39] word if they baptizing
[1:32:42] you in the name of father and of son and
[1:32:46] of Holy Ghost they have rejected the
[1:32:50] word because there's nobody in the Bible
[1:32:53] that's been baptized that way everybody
[1:32:55] in scripture was baptized according to
[1:32:57] the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:32:59] Christ if they reject that they
[1:33:01] rejecting the word this is why Jesus is
[1:33:03] on the outside of the church trying to
[1:33:05] try knock and trying to get back in
[1:33:06] brother random says one of the most
[1:33:08] pitiful sites you'll ever see Jesus
[1:33:10] knocking trying to get back into the
[1:33:12] church that he died
[1:33:15] for but that's a condition and and this
[1:33:18] sign in heaven tells us that these
[1:33:20] things are there oh God don't worry
[1:33:24] don't worry I'm going to turn the corner
[1:33:26] here in a little bit I'mma turn the
[1:33:28] corner I just I had to bring this
[1:33:29] because it's very appropriate for
[1:33:31] tomorrow very appropriate look he says
[1:33:34] this now think of this the church shines
[1:33:36] in the reflected light of the Christ he
[1:33:38] is a
[1:33:39] son the church is the moon thus this orb
[1:33:44] of light is the Moon it had decreased
[1:33:47] from almost a full moon in the first age
[1:33:49] to a s a sliver in the fourth age but in
[1:33:51] the fifth age it began to grow in the
[1:33:53] sixth it took a great step uh uh of
[1:33:55] growth forward and part of the seventh
[1:33:57] age it was still growing when suddenly
[1:33:59] it stopped short and Wan almost to
[1:34:03] nothingness so that instead of light it
[1:34:05] was the Blackness of
[1:34:08] apostasy it was the Blackness of
[1:34:12] apostasy just hold on to that thought
[1:34:15] for a little bit let me finish reading
[1:34:17] this quote but I want to I should have
[1:34:18] underlined that the Blackness of
[1:34:21] apostasy watch this now watch it it says
[1:34:25] uh and at the end of the age it had
[1:34:28] ceased to shine for Darkness had taken
[1:34:30] over Christ has was now outside the
[1:34:32] church here is the sign in the
[1:34:36] sky
[1:34:38] now when we
[1:34:41] uh hear him say the Blackness of
[1:34:45] apostasy I have a little something here
[1:34:48] that I wanted to just make mention of
[1:34:50] really really quick if I can find it
[1:34:53] yeah I uh uh apostasy is the
[1:34:56] abandonment or
[1:34:59] renunciation of a religious or political
[1:35:02] belief I'mma say that
[1:35:04] again uh he said it's going to WAN out
[1:35:07] into the Blackness of apostasy hey let
[1:35:11] me let me back up let me back
[1:35:13] up a
[1:35:16] prophet
[1:35:18] prophesied way back in the 60s that this
[1:35:22] was going to end up in the in the
[1:35:25] Blackness of apostasy and apostasy is an
[1:35:29] abandonment or
[1:35:31] renunciation of a religious or political
[1:35:34] belief now you tell me with believe the
[1:35:38] sign that don't believe the sign anymore
[1:35:42] have they ended up in an apostasy
[1:35:45] brother brandham saw that the church
[1:35:47] would end up in an apostasy the
[1:35:49] Blackness of
[1:35:51] apostasy oh my my my my but there is a
[1:35:56] promise I will
[1:35:59] restore sayeth the Lord so I don't care
[1:36:03] what I see God is bringing light back in
[1:36:05] amen like I say only the moon can only
[1:36:08] reflect and only block light in a
[1:36:10] certain area but the sun is still
[1:36:11] shining around all of that and it only
[1:36:14] lasts for a certain amount of time oh I
[1:36:16] thank God for
[1:36:19] that I'm ready to tell the devil your 5
[1:36:22] minutes is up
[1:36:24] [Applause]
[1:36:26] brother I said your five minutes is up
[1:36:29] Amen Let There be lights and there was
[1:36:33] light and there will be light nobody can
[1:36:38] stop that light from shining once it
[1:36:40] strike the seed it's got to bring
[1:36:45] [Applause]
[1:36:48] forth my God my God my God I'm I'm under
[1:36:52] expectation I'm going on the slide 11 I
[1:36:55] believe the last eclipse of the moon was
[1:36:57] a total eclipse it waned to total
[1:37:00] darkness in seven stages now again they
[1:37:02] tacking brother Brandon for all this but
[1:37:04] if you just they they say it's no seven
[1:37:06] stages to an eclipse I just did a a
[1:37:08] quick Google Google search and the first
[1:37:11] search I found it was at least five it
[1:37:14] was at least five just in the first
[1:37:15] search so don't believe everything you
[1:37:17] read sometime do your own research just
[1:37:20] don't carry don't just take believe the
[1:37:21] sign stuff do your own research
[1:37:24] amen the last eclipse of moon was a
[1:37:26] total eclipse it waned to total darkness
[1:37:28] in seven stages in the seven stages the
[1:37:30] total darkness came as the pope of Rome
[1:37:32] Paul the 6 went to Palestine to make a
[1:37:35] holy tour Jerusalem he was the first
[1:37:37] pope to ever go to Jerusalem now he
[1:37:40] wasn't welcome but he still went right
[1:37:43] it says he was the first he was the
[1:37:44] first
[1:37:46] um uh Pope uh to ever go to Jerusalem
[1:37:49] the pope is named Paul I 6
[1:37:55] now he takes the now they they they
[1:37:57] actually take names that's not that
[1:37:58] wasn't his original name he took the
[1:38:00] name Paul the six my God and Paul
[1:38:04] represent the first church age messenger
[1:38:06] but why would he say Paul the six six is
[1:38:10] the number of
[1:38:11] man Hallelujah the pope is and and you
[1:38:15] trying to trace a pope to find out if it
[1:38:19] was a eclipse where the pope
[1:38:22] was I'm telling you right now there's an
[1:38:24] eclip with Eclipse where the pope is
[1:38:26] they walking in complete
[1:38:30] darkness the pope is named Paul the six
[1:38:32] Paul was the first messenger and this
[1:38:34] man goes by that name notice it is the
[1:38:37] six or the number of man this is more
[1:38:41] than a
[1:38:42] coincidence and when he went to
[1:38:44] Jerusalem the moon of the church went
[1:38:46] into total darkness this is it this is
[1:38:49] the end this generation shall not pass
[1:38:52] away until all be fulfilled even so Lord
[1:38:54] Jesus come quickly now what they're what
[1:38:56] they're harping on is that it the the
[1:38:58] the eclipse did not happen on the very
[1:39:00] day that the pope was visiting I want to
[1:39:02] say it's roughly two weeks after but
[1:39:04] here's here's the thing that brother
[1:39:05] Brand's bringing why would this man Paul
[1:39:09] the six be the first one to go Jerusalem
[1:39:13] and the Very year that he chooses to go
[1:39:14] to Jerusalem there is a total eclipse in
[1:39:17] the same year within weeks of him going
[1:39:20] so we got our eyes on these spiritual
[1:39:22] things that areen happening and here you

[1:41:58] going to bring flesh upon you and this
[1:42:00] is the soft part of an animal body and I

[1:42:04] Flesh tenderhearted towards God because
[1:42:07] if we're tenderhearted towards God it
[1:42:10] would bring amen Divine Fellowship right

[1:42:33] bark of the tree is the natural covering
[1:42:36] to the tree God going to restore all of
[1:42:39] that and the last thing is I'm going to
[1:42:40] put breath in you and your breath is

[1:42:52] because as we talked
[1:42:55] about the
[1:42:57] tendons laying s you upon you this goes
[1:43:01] back to Ezekiel 36 and I read it for you

[1:43:10] there Ezekiel 36:24 says for I will take
[1:43:14] you from among the Heathen this is a
[1:43:17] promise and gather you out of all
[1:43:20] countries and will bring you into your
[1:43:22] own land

[1:44:07] this no notice this you in a
[1:44:10] situation where you don't want to even
[1:44:12] give up the way you feel you feel
[1:44:16] justified in the way that you feel about
[1:44:19] a certain situation but God don't like
[1:44:21] that spirit being there in you and since
[1:44:24] you won't give it up since you won't lay
[1:44:27] it down God say I
[1:44:32] [Music]
[1:44:34] will God say I'm going to take away your
[1:44:38] Stony heart glory to God I'mma I will
[1:44:41] take away the Stony heart out of your
[1:44:44] flesh and I will give you a heart of
[1:44:48] Flesh something going to
[1:44:51] change I I believe
[1:44:54] this hey something's got to
[1:44:56] change and this this is a promise from
[1:44:59] God I I mean we some some some you know
[1:45:01] like like the brother that um that that
[1:45:03] that challenged the prophet he um uh he
[1:45:06] said you ain't going to preach here I
[1:45:07] done knocked a lot of preachers down
[1:45:09] trying to preach over here in Portland
[1:45:10] and brother random say he said you
[1:45:12] challenge the spirit of God you're not
[1:45:13] challenging me he said you're going to
[1:45:14] fall over my
[1:45:16] feet that man said I'mma show you feet
[1:45:18] feet I'mma fall over follow that man
[1:45:20] spit in the prophet's face now I'm going
[1:45:23] tell you right there the test would have
[1:45:25] been hard to pass for me for me that
[1:45:29] would have been very hard spit in my
[1:45:32] face in front of all these people but
[1:45:34] I'm going tell you why brother Brandon
[1:45:36] didn't didn't swing at that man that man
[1:45:37] was about 6
[1:45:39] foot5 300 and something pounds he knew
[1:45:41] nothing he can do but take the
[1:45:47] spit spit falling from his
[1:45:51] face
[1:45:53] we talk about being Christians ain't
[1:45:56] we and he had to realize that he could
[1:45:59] not get in the flesh because this was
[1:46:02] not a flesh BL a flesh and blood battle
[1:46:04] this was a spiritual
[1:46:06] battle so he say you going to fall over
[1:46:08] my feet and God allowed that man to spit
[1:46:11] in his face like that to see how he'
[1:46:16] [Music]
[1:46:17] respond that was an intimidation uh move
[1:46:21] but he didn't fall for the intim
[1:46:22] imidation move he said I said you going
[1:46:25] to fall over my feet that man ran back
[1:46:29] went to swing at the prophet and when he
[1:46:31] was to swing right down over the
[1:46:34] prophet's
[1:46:37] feet police and all the preachers that
[1:46:40] was running away from the man they left
[1:46:42] brother brandom standing there by
[1:46:44] himself but see I'm going tell you if
[1:46:46] God is for
[1:46:50] you who can be against you
[1:46:53] that man laid there and then all the
[1:46:55] preachers and police running back say
[1:46:56] say what you want us to do say just get
[1:46:58] them off my feet that's right right say
[1:47:00] is he delivered no you're not
[1:47:03] delivered you going to pray for him no I
[1:47:06] ain't praying for
[1:47:08] him he worshiped the spirit that he got
[1:47:11] so since he worshiped that Spirit he go
[1:47:13] it's going to stay right there on him
[1:47:15] until he ready to get
[1:47:17] delivered but he know he just came in
[1:47:19] contact with the real thing here now he
[1:47:21] might go beat up another pre but he
[1:47:23] won't he won't be doing that here in
[1:47:24] these meetings and you know what as many
[1:47:27] times brother Brandon went back to
[1:47:28] Portland Oregon that man never showed up
[1:47:31] he knew he was dealing with this was no
[1:47:35] ordinary Ministry this was God sent this
[1:47:38] ministry all right Church Hallelujah but
[1:47:43] see that man worship His Spirit glory to
[1:47:45] God and some of us might worship the
[1:47:48] spirit that we
[1:47:49] [Music]
[1:47:51] got true but but here I even but but but
[1:47:55] but since I'm calling you bride right
[1:47:58] I'm here to tell you what's gonna happen
[1:47:59] to the bride what's going to happen to
[1:48:02] the bride God say I'm going to I'm going
[1:48:04] to
[1:48:06] take I don't care if you worship it or
[1:48:09] not I'm going to take away the Stony
[1:48:12] heart out of you amen out of your flesh
[1:48:14] and I will give you a heart of
[1:48:17] Flesh now now I got more to say here I'm
[1:48:21] I'm I'mma read my quotes so we
[1:48:23] understand clearly where we at but but
[1:48:26] after I take that from you there's still
[1:48:29] more to the
[1:48:32] process I will
[1:48:36] put this is the spirit of God this is a
[1:48:41] holy spirit this is a righteous spirit
[1:48:45] this is a Godly spirit I will put my
[1:48:49] spirit within you and cuse you to walk
[1:48:54] in my statutes and ye shall keep my
[1:48:57] judgments and do
[1:49:00] them and you shall drawn the land that I
[1:49:03] gave to your fathers and ye shall be my
[1:49:06] people and I will be your
[1:49:12] God I got to
[1:49:14] read I got to read these things because
[1:49:17] it it helps us see a little clearer
[1:49:19] brother Brandon is referring to Ezekiel
[1:49:22] 37 in this quote uh Ezekiel 36 in this
[1:49:27] quote says now Ezekiel was prophesying
[1:49:30] or for telling what would take place in
[1:49:33] an age to come so the scripture we just
[1:49:35] read was not even for ezekiel's day that
[1:49:39] scripture is actually for this day
[1:49:42] Ezekiel was prophesying or for telling
[1:49:43] what would take place in the age to come
[1:49:45] not in his age he says but a prophet is
[1:49:49] a sear and it is referred to in the
[1:49:52] Bible as the eagle who goes way high in
[1:49:54] the air and the higher you go the
[1:49:56] further you can see watch this now so
[1:49:58] the eagle soars up much higher than any
[1:50:00] other bird there's no bird can go with
[1:50:02] the eagle and there's no I like the
[1:50:04] eagle the Hulk hasn't got a chance in
[1:50:07] his sight and the Hulk cannot stand the
[1:50:09] altitude of where the eagle can SW he
[1:50:12] would die he doesn't he hasn't got the
[1:50:14] makeup that the eagle has look at this
[1:50:17] now I'm going forward I'm going forward
[1:50:19] and God
[1:50:20] liken the prophet to the eagle that
[1:50:23] would go in the makeup of a prophet amen
[1:50:26] he's a Seer that in the spirit climbs
[1:50:29] beyond the emotions of the
[1:50:36] church he climbs
[1:50:40] beyond the emotion of the church he sees
[1:50:44] beyond your emotions all your feelings
[1:50:46] and all that it ain't got nothing to do
[1:50:49] with what God trying to do and you may
[1:50:51] be right but you got to be willing to
[1:50:53] die to what you right
[1:50:55] about you a sheep you got to give up
[1:50:58] your wool you got to give up your rights
[1:51:01] the Holy Ghost will make you die to your
[1:51:03] own
[1:51:05] [Music]
[1:51:10] thoughts the sea in the spirit climbs
[1:51:13] beyond the emotion of the church he goes
[1:51:18] beyond the rhythm of the
[1:51:21] music
[1:51:23] glory to God we think we don't have
[1:51:25] church when everything just in line boy
[1:51:27] they played they did they sung they did
[1:51:29] this no no no God can see beyond that oh
[1:51:33] hallelujah amen we can have all that
[1:51:35] church and still people won't fellowship
[1:51:37] with one
[1:51:39] [Music]
[1:51:41] another I I I see Saints in the church
[1:51:43] going out of different doors so they
[1:51:45] ain't got to shake somebody's
[1:51:49] hand can I
[1:51:51] preach
[1:51:54] I mean avoiding each other I'mma go out
[1:51:57] of this dose so I I don't have to
[1:51:59] fellowship with this one and I'mma go
[1:52:01] out of this and I'mma leave early and
[1:52:02] I'mma leave late and I'm no no no no
[1:52:05] that God God see all of that happening

[1:53:07] anointing that goes with that and I'm
[1:53:09] going to tell you something else that
[1:53:11] anointing would go from one generation

[2:00:59] only the devil put that in you like that
[2:01:01] they don't even see what you see the
[2:01:04] devil make that thing a
[2:01:06] mountain and it ain't nothing but a
[2:01:08] little mo here
[2:01:12] that's amen but but we got we have we we
[2:01:15] have to do something different I'm I'm
[2:01:17] intentionally you that was a word a few
[2:01:19] years ago intentional now I I Lord I
[2:01:22] didn't do this but I I I need to do this
[2:01:25] uh anybody
[2:01:28] remember no I I I I'll do it I ain't G I
[2:01:30] ain't going to let y'all off that I I'll
[2:01:32] do it so let me go and just keep reading
[2:01:34] this he goes beyond the joy among the
[2:01:37] saints he goes beyond all that God
[2:01:40] brings him up into a rim alone alone
[2:01:43] then he opens his eyes and he lets him
[2:01:45] look around and see the things that is
[2:01:46] to come then he brings them back down
[2:01:49] among the members of the body to forell
[2:01:51] them of what is in the making so God
[2:01:54] took
[2:01:55] Ezekiel High far up and let him see
[2:01:59] around about 2600
[2:02:02] years so that new new heart new spirit
[2:02:06] and then I put my spirit in you Ezekiel
[2:02:08] was looking all the way down into this
[2:02:12] day it wern't even for his age God let a
[2:02:16] prophet way back then see us
[2:02:18] today I wonder I wonder if he if ezek
[2:02:22] e y'all going to let me preach I wonder
[2:02:25] if Ezekiel Saw us going out of different
[2:02:28] doors trying to avoid one
[2:02:32] another I wonder if Ezekiel Saw that
[2:02:36] going saw us walking down the Walmart
[2:02:39] aisle and we saw a sister in the church
[2:02:42] said I don't want to talk to
[2:02:47] her turn and go down another aisle and
[2:02:50] trying to run and then you end up
[2:02:52] getting down the same
[2:03:00] aisle I I wonder if Ezekiel Saw all of
[2:03:04] that Brothers a brother calling you and
[2:03:08] you know you're available you looking at
[2:03:11] your phone they they they they call
[2:03:14] ideas all over it I don't know who this
[2:03:17] is I can't
[2:03:19] see now all of a sudden you got problems
[2:03:21] with your
[2:03:23] eyes oh brother I'm so sorry I I I
[2:03:26] couldn't I couldn't even recognize who
[2:03:27] it was calling me they left you a
[2:03:30] message you knew the voice but refused
[2:03:33] to call them
[2:03:40] back just just all kind of
[2:03:43] nonsense right just just just and can I
[2:03:46] call it
[2:03:47] Petty baby
[2:03:50] childish amen little things like that
[2:03:53] and it hinders the
[2:03:54] church it hinders the spirit of God from
[2:03:57] moving in here and sometime we can come
[2:03:59] in we have a great service but we got to
[2:04:00] look beyond the Clapping now all that
[2:04:03] Clapping Your Hands and all that
[2:04:05] shouting and all that jumping and you
[2:04:07] still going to get up here and go out
[2:04:10] the other
[2:04:13] door I done called it out now so
[2:04:16] everybody going to be looking at you now
[2:04:17] they see you going out a different
[2:04:20] door
[2:04:26] or or run to the car early I got to get
[2:04:29] I I've been here I've done this before
[2:04:30] I've done this before I I mean I had a
[2:04:32] spirit of indifference on me and the
[2:04:35] spirit of indifference I would get to
[2:04:37] church at a certain time but I ain't
[2:04:39] want nobody to bother me so uh actually
[2:04:42] what I do is I always come late that way
[2:04:45] they went ask me to sing no special or
[2:04:47] nothing cuz I'm too late to sing a
[2:04:48] special and I get there in the church
[2:04:50] and I and I hear the word and by when
[2:04:53] when the when the pastor say I'm closing
[2:04:55] when they when they when they bowing
[2:04:57] their heads to close their eyes to
[2:05:03] pray gone in my car gone I didn't greet
[2:05:09] nobody not even the
[2:05:11] pastor but I was still going to church
[2:05:14] and the reason I was going to church cuz
[2:05:16] I could at least the devil couldn't tell
[2:05:18] me that you didn't you wer going to
[2:05:19] church no I did go to church now I did
[2:05:21] go to church but I went with a wrong
[2:05:23] [Music]
[2:05:26] Spirit but one day I went to
[2:05:29] church and when I went to church that
[2:05:31] day God had a sermon waiting for me now
[2:05:35] I don't even remember the sermon to this
[2:05:37] day but what I do remember is that the
[2:05:40] Holy Ghost Hallelujah came down
[2:05:43] Hallelujah at the end of the service and
[2:05:46] I could not tip out and I sat there and
[2:05:49] I lifted my hands one time too minut me
[2:05:52] and before you knew it I was broken down
[2:05:54] in tears and crying and snotting and
[2:05:57] everything else and some kind of way
[2:05:59] that Spirit came out of me it might have
[2:06:01] came out in a snot but it came
[2:06:07] out pastor's wife was the first person
[2:06:09] to come over and greet me just grinning
[2:06:11] and
[2:06:14] smiling I still remember her today just
[2:06:16] grinning and smiling and shaking my and
[2:06:18] all I could do is reach my hand out and
[2:06:20] shake and if I could have hug I would
[2:06:21] have hugged
[2:06:22] her I was free and I was so happy to be
[2:06:26] free so I know what it feels like to be
[2:06:29] bound and I also know what it feels like
[2:06:31] to be
[2:06:31] free and after that day I was on time to
[2:06:35] church right I wasn't leaving first I
[2:06:37] would stay around and fellowship with
[2:06:39] everybody after the service and there
[2:06:41] was many people in my life back then I
[2:06:42] really didn't want to fellowship
[2:06:45] with but I I made it my intention to
[2:06:48] fellowship and they used to tell me you

[2:07:57] do I got to read
[2:08:02] this hidden life with Christ brother
[2:08:04] Rand say now the Bible said that he
[2:08:06] would give us a new heart and he would
[2:08:08] give us a new spirit and many people
[2:08:12] even Pentecostal people and Full Gospel
[2:08:15] people can I put this and message
[2:08:19] people has been deceived beli D in that
[2:08:23] many times God said I'll give you a new
[2:08:25] spirit that wasn't his Spirit that's
[2:08:30] your
[2:08:32] spirit then I will it says then I will
[2:08:35] put my spirit in you I'll give you a new
[2:08:37] spirit then I will put my spirit in you
[2:08:39] many times you get the new spirit and
[2:08:43] think you got the holy
[2:08:47] spirit because you had a good feeling on
[2:08:49] your flesh and there was good music
[2:08:51] music and some good singing and all that
[2:08:54] now you really think you got something
[2:08:56] boy we had a great time in church but
[2:08:58] what happened on the
[2:08:59] inside many times you get the new spirit
[2:09:02] and think you got the Holy Spirit and
[2:09:04] trusting upon
[2:09:07] emotions and signs and things when your
[2:09:11] life doesn't divy up to that so if we
[2:09:15] had all this great time y'all know we
[2:09:17] get ready to have some powerful meetings
[2:09:20] y'all know all this getting ready to
[2:09:21] happened here but we got to be ready
[2:09:24] spiritually cleaned out ready for God to
[2:09:27] do something otherwise we G to miss out

[2:09:32] come here and get the blessing and leave
[2:09:33] with it all we are to just
[2:09:36] host I don't want to just be no
[2:09:39] host no I I want God to move and I want
[2:09:43] to be a part of it Lord whatever you

[2:10:01] brother R say that's just a little raw
[2:10:03] but remember it's the
[2:10:06] truth it goes
[2:10:10] on many
[2:10:13] people that spirit that new spirit God
[2:10:15] had to God had to give you a new
[2:10:20] spirit to get along with his Spirit oh
