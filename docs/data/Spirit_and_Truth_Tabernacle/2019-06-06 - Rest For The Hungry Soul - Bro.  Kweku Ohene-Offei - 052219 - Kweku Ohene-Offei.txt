Christ and we pray amen praise God hallelujah the Lord is good amen shall we take our Bible without taking too much of your time and then a we want to speak something about rest for the heart and we will type title it rest for the hungry heart rests for the hungry soul or just rest for the hungry rest for your hungry so amen so you want to read the book of Isaiah chapter 55 s one two three Isaiah 55 one two three praise God hallelujah if someone cannot be read for us someone else is ready you can read for us eyes are 55 one two three [Music] amen praise God hallelujah may the Lord bless into the reading of his wait shall we be seated amen rest for the hungry soul and I said come on to you why do you buy bread well doesn't satisfy why do we buy food that doesn't satisfy us come and eat free of charge without money you know you can't just pop into the restaurant and present your mouth and your stomach by hey I'm here to eat you need to have your money fast to pay for what you're gonna eat now about this restaurant you don't need any money to go to this restaurant you know need any ticket you don't need credit card but you need just to present yourself and you can eat as much as you want to eat amen and that is the word of the Lord and many a times we eat things that doesn't satisfy our soul sometimes we take we were born into the cosmos world and all we know we look at the world we think maybe education can satisfy you we think maybe job will satisfy you riches can satisfy you families can satisfy you but none of them can satisfy your soul amen nothing beside Jesus Christ can satisfy our hungry sauce amen so the Lord beckons us to come unto me my people why do you live up for things that doesn't satisfy why do you struggle with your strength you buy things we spend things we spend our time if we break our time that we're going to spend on this earth let's say God give 120 years like Moises so out of the 120 years we spend part of the time to sleep there's not no question about it maybe when you're a child you have to sleep like 10 hours 8 hours as you grew it reduced to maybe eight hours is normal sometimes you don't get eight hours six hours sometimes four hours some time whatever you can get you go to wake we work 15 hours 20 hours just name it twelve hours eight hours overnight daytime morning whatever they are part of this cosmos what we needed but Austin would not satisfy the basis can do for you is to buy put roof on top of you put dust in your mouth so what do you say does food is dust just calcium potassium just nutrients put some cotton on your on your skin and put some metals and some rap rubbers and plastic vehicle around you to move about Oh Jules but it's not going to do much to you that would just for the flesh that do not satisfied their heart they do not satisfy the hungry sue but there's another bread another bread of life not a bread that we eat not a bread we buy from the grocery but it's a bread from heaven that was ordained that was baked just for your teeth amen that was designed that was done by the bakery the way you like it amen just like human means we like the whole idea coffee in a setting where people idea bread in a certain way people I bread with Annie people I bread with different different different shapes and types and and forms the Lord has ordained a world to satisfy our hungry heart amen so as I said that why do you buy bread who doesn't satisfy you come on to me I'm the bread of Living Waters I'm a fountain of living waters come and buy without price and without money amen if God should put a price tag on the food on the bread of heaven no human being can buy it even if God would put a price tag on the oxygen that we breathe no human being can survive you know God hasn't put no price like tag but he said come and eat that used to be satisfied amen that is the bread of eternal life now what is rest in a human language we know rest as getting tired maybe from work from your Labor's from working from a certain kind of job then you need to sit down sleep stop stay away from the latest from your wake and relax and rest amen now in Genesis 1 God Genesis 2 sorry if what we read Sunday Genesis 2 chapter 1 even God needed a rest how can God be nice pretty the rest God was the great fountain of spirit but he wanted to find a rest in the 60 elements in the eighth his own creation amen so God created Adam so that he could have a rest the Bible said that God rested on the seventh day God is a spirit guided in take mortar and construction Mateusz to control the world know it just by his thought and by his weight the way the world came into an existence but then God couldn't get a rest until he created a man he created you and I amen you are Adam I am Adam we came from Adam so that is when God had a rest so when God created man and he incarnated or moving to a man God found the rest that his soul was longing for but then we know what happened Genesis chapter 3 the serpent came in to disrupt the rest of God brought therefore brought all the chaos we can see on the planet it came through Genesis chapter 3 that's when the serpent came in so the rest that God gave to man give to himself that race was taken away but I was gassed all part of God's program the law of contrast because God had more attributes than just rest in Adam he was a savior so if nothing false he cannot see if he could deceive so God has to let go the race if nothing falls down if this one is here is here this way it's supposed to be but then one is false I'm going to look for it pick it up and bring it back to we're supposed to be that is a race so God put his arrest in place not in trees not in shrubs not in material things but what he himself created human beings amen so you are the rest of God so Genesis three came in to destroy the rest of God but then God through his programs over the years was all trying to bring back the rest where man and God will become one amen if we read efficient chapter three sorry efficient chapter four thirty he said grieve not the Holy Spirit of God which seals you on to your redemption the Holy Spirit is your seal that is Christ in you is your cilantro redemption and until Christ comes into the human heart there's no red there's no redemption so gasps redemption is to have a nice place in you and I amen praise God hallelujah so God had to come into a man tourists now when man created when man was created after they fall in that Garden of Eden man lost not rest so man is now seeking God to come in and find race initially God was that the grid goddess himself is the rest the fountain of the Spirit but God didn't had a vessel to stay in and rest so gotta to create a flesh and wrist now the flesh is there but the flare doesn't have the wrist doesn't have Christ so god him Amin is now crying in his heart all that we do on earth people do around is because there's something in their heart that is calling for a risk but because human being doesn't give his or her had to God the devil put in the wrong not rest but on risk into the person's heart the devil put drinken s puts all kind of spirits think and I'll bring the race but it doesn't satisfy that their heart on to Jesus Christ comes in amen praise God hallelujah glory to God how can God rest let's read another scripture from Isaiah chapter 40 verse 1 and 2 as I have forty one and two I said chapter 14 verse 1 in to okay comfort comfort my people says the Lord says God speak he comfortably to Jerusalem Jerusalem means God city of peace Giroux means God Sally means Shalom peace and Kryon to her that her warfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardoned for she had to receive of the lost hand double for her sins amen so the Lord is calling yet comfort he comforting my people God is calling for a day of comfort for you and I amen because we are the people of God but we didn't have the comfort without the Holy Ghost a man doesn't have a rest we don't have the comfort so the Holy Ghost comes into the human heart to bring the comfort that we have been longing for over the years amen glory hallelujah let me give my example maybe for for somebody it will help somebody when I was a child I was a kid going to high school I got this guy here that was my biggest problem I wanted to study and invent and discover things I love books and God bless you which was my world so I steady and I remember one time a hot price my high school was like Lissa from about four hours drive I don't know that is done from here to a land oh so that's what I went to high school in the hospital was like a college we live in a school so I had good prices I was going for my price and switching price giving the way vice president and big man were coming so I was so happy sat on the bus and when I start on the bus something told me to go to the back back seat or the bus because I was going to sleep it was going to be a night night drive so I wanted to make sure I have my house of money with me so I wanted to make sure I mean I had a safe and a voice said go to the next go to the next I went to the back I didn't know what was going on on my way happy to go and see my friends was boy so I'm going to see my friends and we shout and yell and be happy with each other then there was this accident on the way one of the deadly assassin service in my life that was the video viewed that the little one bit so how do you call it little right they had a little one and came to crash my bus hit the bus with the top terrific speed and the engine was moving in the air two people died on the spot and the word change from because been a lot of child I thought really my New Testament was good enough Lenny my books that's what I wanted I love books but something put a question my band are you ready to go to heaven if you died well you ready I wasn't living in sin I wasn't drinking I wasn't smoking I was in running after woman but I wasn't ready to go to where my maker wanted me to be so he put their call let me know that their books and the knowledge would not give me rest I needed a rest and in the Holy Spirit I had been baptized in Father Son and Holy Ghost I had my baptismal certificate I was a happiest when I was baptized I think middle school so I thought that's all I got to do read my neutral I didn't understand the Old Testament so at least I could read the New Testament and get some understanding but God the Father the gridview funny was calling you my son books would not give you rest amen the rest is the wait until I encountered the Word of God the message sent from the father above and I was along in there was a cry my heart do I was go to bed cause a change I couldn't find a rest that I was longing for speaking in tongues didn't give raise and even it wasn't the tongues that you were forced to speak I was never able to speak in tongues because when I was in that whole change the rest which is not a true raises speak in tongues when you speak in tongues you've got Christ because on the upper who spoke in tongues and who speak in tongues and the life is billion miles away from what happened in the upper room but I was praying sincerely for a rest until one day in the church a voice said that look they were selling I don't go into details but I want to just use it for example that there were Salinger's line the time of Jesus they were selling the church was being used for money to make a long story short and I said I thought it's a church I'm supposed to be what do I go where do I get a rest and I was praying asking people do you know the truth because I know that was true someway I asked my friends before that I thought they were religious report you know the truth when the truth is until the Lord Himself gave me the truth through my brother I remember one time my brother and I we have an m1 in the bush wasn't morning morning devotion and he asked me were preparing for his wedding actually I was just a young boy and then my brother asked me to read Acts chapter 2 verse 38 and I've read the Bible like maybe more than thousand times the scriptures because I took it for a class in school stated New Testament I could tell you or the book of Acts I could rattle it the four gospel they call a synoptic gospel Matthew John Mark and Luke I could tell you all the stories and I said where was the scripture coming from repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so what the scripture day I've read it over and over and over and over and in a span of three years I've read this book of Acts our could encounter number of times what I probably thousand times well was this creature coming from but I had already been baptized and I said I want to be baptized as soon as possible he's up and I started to Jenny to my wrists I got baptized I thought I was okie oh thank god I've been baptized and then the posture begin to talk about Holy Ghost baptism oh I thought I was okay I've got my wrist but that wasn't the rest I need the baptism in water is just an outward sign a good question towards the Lord Lord I've accepted you just like a one a man making a vow to a woman you have just been engaged but the life of the man is not in your heart see the marriage was not a completionist Amen so hard - I began to breathe I'm about to summer pasta talk about I don't know here I was in the US but rupture the Holy Ghost baptism and the rapture was the order of the day you better get the Holy Ghost baptism or you get left behind and the Antichrist system you have to pay with your life so freeing I was free I don't I do it in its brain and fasten preen and fasten printer first time oh and one night I had a dream in the dream I saw the Lord he didn't stop one day on the under on the earth but in the sky and he beckoned me to come up and I could go go all the way I got hung up I come back to the earth and I go I come back about three or something times I came out of the dream as I don't have to only go see it cuz I couldn't get to where the Lord was and I begin to pray more and pray I began to pray and fast and pray and fast and I think I had that dream twice again and the last one I had I was caught in the arms of the Lord amen that is the rest for the heart and when you get a rest the Lord he gives you the rest he will let you know that he's in you amen things that you didn't understand that's what the Bible said only believe when you believe the understanding will come amen even understand everything the pastor preaches but you believe with all your heart is the man of God God has given to you believe what a minister's tell you believe what they can tell you the understanding of the word will come to you amen believe what daddy and mommy tells you they understand about come the revelation will come amen because they have been in the Jenny didn't know whether they know they have got experience with a lot amen so I got from there like Paul my life wasn't the same anymore amen that is a heavenly vision God has for you and I my mind about books and learning the Lord took it away the Lord turned my world upside I wanted to be the biggest neuroscientist I wanted to invent and discover but a lot ten things are around for me that my son that is not where I want you to go invention and discovery is not your world but in Christ preyus offering and the word is what I have for you amen that does give you your satisfaction that gives a satisfaction to the heart amen of course we have to work and get money to live and also don't quit your job no but that would not give you satisfaction I went to but satisfaction will come from when Christ is embedded in your heart when the voice the Holy goes to the preeminence in your heart that is when you have the satisfaction that is what you can walk fearlessly you can walk in darkness in daytime there's no fear in Christ amen you are not afraid of death because you have already died that is behind you amen you are not afraid of what are you gonna resurrect or not because you're already alive so how can you be alive when you have no even died well how can you be resurrect when you are not dead the resurrection is a supernatural direction is no resurrection from the ground but iteration from the world of cosmas and unbelief amen resurrection from tiredness and worry and stress and the world God put the Holy Ghost in you to resurrect you to bring you to an awakening to bring you back to the alive the original life God given to you amen praise God hallelujah the Lord is good let's read one more Scripture praise God hallelujah can we read Genesis 3 Genesis chapter 3 verse 1 so now this red truck really for a man praise God amen and that is what brought mankind onto death and on to distraction amen so God commanded give us give his command commandment of conditional love that do not eat this tree when you eat it you're gonna die of course man eat it and it brought death unto man and God knows a man cannot keep a promise it's not a nature of him and me to keep promises you're gonna break it so the only way for you to keep the promises he will keep it in you amen if you just buy a lot don't do this do this don't do this all mankind will fall but then when God comes to dwelling you pasta the life that I live is no longer i it's not the human being so who used to persecute Christians by Christ in me he brings his life inside out amen so the greatest event is the restoration is to resurrect by the Holy Ghost baptism by dying to yourself how do you doubt yourself you were born with a nature God a God makers three Rams three fold beans we've got a flesh we've got a spirit and we're gonna sue amen the flesh is just help you to contact the earth City smell feel and what else attack not just to contact your earthly home the spirit is to help you contact the spiritual home sweet reward memory affection reasoning imagination and conscience every human being has both caution animals do not have conscience because they don't have a su now the third room is what is the su the saw has got only one Inlet or one outlet that is Christ or sittin born-again or the old bath the old bath you just make you a caricature amen you can act a Christian you can act a child of God you can act to me a good person God is not even looking for good person is looking for Christ amen you can be as good as anybody anybody but without Christ on the inside that is not what God is looking for he's looking for unconditional love amen where you just say Lord let your will be done and you circumcise your heart and you dwell in you and you use you for the purpose that he brought your life on earth for amen giving rest for our soo how many are looking for rest how many want more of the rest of God how many want to become the supernatural being of Christ how many want to be like the day of Pentecost when the men and women came from the upper room and they were drunk with the Holy Ghost baptism they were not freed and shy of nobody but the Holy Ghost himself used them amen the lot begin to manifest himself the spoke in tongues and remove here in them they thought oh I know this woman I know this man what is wrong with them and when they went closer to them they found out what was wrong with them was Jesus Christ in them amen and God is looking for one person just one that would surrender his or her heart to the Lord and that one person is you and I amen God is not looking for million bright one person to marry that is you if you give your heart to the Lord Lord take over me amen take over my mind take over my worries take over my sickness to cover all my troubles and you have your own way in me you see the supernatural been walk-ins my step in your life amen all the things that you used to wonder about you so trouble about there'll be nothing the troubles of this world the worse of life will be behind you amen and he loves you your second is you set your loved ones free you prosper you you bless you intend it to be yours amen eternal life is living for others when Christ is in you you don't think too much about yourself but you think about who Lord who can you help who can you help me to help amen who can i impact who can I pray for and you ask God you aren't you walking step by step with God you I Libra what card you are gas business man and women God put his business proposal that's what you're gonna do and you execute it bring it to manifestation amen we're gonna find that you are more way higher so now when we read the people in the Bible we think yes they were great men and women of God but your covenant is way beyond the covenant of Hannah Mary named Miriam Elizabeth Ruth and esta Amen because what you have now they didn't have it when they were here amen more has been revealed to you the fullness of the word was not for for yet but for you God has given you the fullness of the world everything in the man of grass and the man of Christ has been emptied into your heart and if you can't take it and eat it belief means the leaf become their life eats it and let it become out your life be live believe it's different from the way the Bible took the human language to express spiritual language belief in human language means just one second this is read I believe or this is white I believe is your mind no but in the spiritual language believe is not okay this is white yes I believe is white with your mind believe means it's big leaf let it be your life take it and let it become your life leave and that's what God want is to believe his weight you might understand here but you receive it in your heart and Interbrand understand into your heart glory hallelujah what is resurrection resurrection means what dead and become a life risk from death the hakama is read when I'm not dead I'm not in a graveyard in the human mind resurrection means when somebody died we put him in the tombstone like Lazarus then the person comes to this natural life that is resurrection in the supernatural meaning in the Bible meaning no does no relation is relation is what when you are walking on your two feet you think you've got life but in a man of God you are dead in sin and unbelief and Christ Himself come and consume the man of sin the soul of darkness the old man the old husband the osoo the old nature the old character got consumed it and been a completely from you then he dwells here and manifest then you become a live person you become resurrected
