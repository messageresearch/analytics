feel a man that they're going all the way in the South a man no matter what comes up no matter what the world brings a man we got a made up mind we're going all the way a man we didn't start this journey to go half way we're gonna start the journey just to go to go to the river and stop a man we're going all the way over amen and to attain possess all of the Hittites in the Levites and all of the things that God has for say man amen let us grab our Bibles we're gonna go straight to the word won't be before you too long spoke to the pastor he sends his greetings sums your prayers he's gonna be preaching tonight and I believe he said tomorrow night it's going around a half hour week on this and then they'll be back on Friday so just keep them in your prayers a man as he's doing the work of the Lord up there in Ohio Michigan in that region of the area a man how many love the Lord a man we're gonna just continue reading here in the book of Hebrews the eleventh chapter they in the book of Hebrews the eleventh chapter Amen we gonna take up there from the 24th verse a man we see here the 24 verse by faith Moses when he come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer the afflictions with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater than riches and treasures of Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the wrath of the King for he endured as seeing him who is invisible a man I'm gonna read that again he forced Sir and we know Egypt there was a type of bondage of the world a man there was three Exodus going on there and at that time he was calling a church out of a people then he was calling a bride out of a church a man so we see that Egypt represented the world amen and once we were they were called out he sent the deliverer a man Moses there to bring the people out because he had heard the cries and also he was the Prophet Abraham was saying that the people his people would dwell in bondage for 400 years and then he would bring them out by a strong hand and it was time for that prophecy to be fulfilled amen so we see that he forsook Egypt fearing not fearing the wrath of the King not fearing the world or not fearing the world politics or not fearing what man might say he forsook Egypt a man not fearing the king and he endured as seeing him who was invisible a man and we know that a prophet is a seer so he was seeing him who was invisible a man let us pray most gracious Heavenly Father we thank you Lord God for Lord God this wonderful wonderful time Oh father God that you've allowed us to have to come Lord God and Lord once again Lord to uh feast Lord God on your word Lord God we know Lord that every time we come Lord God that you meet us here father and Lord of all things Lord God we ask your father to continue to unfold yourself to us reveal yourself to us Oh father God to increase our revelation Oh father God and as we increase our revelation on You Lord God it deepens our affection for you Lord God because we are understanding more and more about you Lord God Lord as we feast on your word and we come we draw closer to your father God Lord God I just meet the people's needs Oh Lord God we ask you those that may be tuning in through YouTube and things of that nature Lord God that may be searching Oh Lord God may something be said tonight Lord God that would ignite their faith Lord God Lord God to where they can believe that something is said to call them Oh father God to a higher place of praise Lord God that had called them to a higher place of worship Oh father God we ask you Father God we commit this service into your hands Lord bless those that are here Lord God and those that desire to be here Lord God and and incant Lord and those that are on the way Lord God we ask you to Lord God to just take full complete control of father God in Jesus precious name I pray amen man you may be seated a man I'm gonna a member the help of the Holy Spirit attempt to suggest um to bring forth and this little thought here and it's not really a title or anything we're just to treating it like a Bible study any managers continue in this uh this book Hill and speaking on Moses in the face and things that that that Moses had and how and then sort of just bring that into the day and basically to show how important how important faith is you know you know faces of Revelation and maybe we had a prophet in this hour that came in and and he and he told that he said it's a revelation you can't have faith in something Amen that you that you that you don't have any clue of a man if you if you've never driven a car before if you if you've never done it before your first time get behind the wheel it's a little bit difficult to have complete faith in that vehicle any man you have to you know push the will the gas pedal just a little bit gingerly a man you got the tester steering wheel a little bit you know what I mean you have you you you move cautiously but seeing the things of God it has to be faith come to a level and we're going to get over some of that we're gonna go over some of that some of those things amen glory to God let's turn to your Bibles there and Exodus the 23rd we'll start there and then we're just gonna break some things open here and amen hope it'll be a blessing to you a man Exodus the 23rd chapter and he has it third verse a man and behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee to the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions my name is in him a man he says my name is in him but if thou will indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy to thine enemies and an adversary to thine adversaries for my angels shall go before thee amen and we see here that God is speaking to his servant Moses and during that time you know the children of Israel had was went into Egypt playing man through the blessings of Joseph and they sort of just got in there and got to look complacent amen and they got in and then and and and in the scriptures say that there arose a pharaoh that knew not Joseph and began a man to you with the retired masters Amen now put the children in bondage now it was a la Mona just say that it was a subtle bondage they came in to Egypt as friends and they came in as well this is a good thing but slowly what happened is they got comfortable and and sort of the old example of the frog in the pot amen the water wasn't hot when the Frog got in but he gradually turned it up and so that's the same thing that happened there needs you they got complacent and they got comfortable but see it was still an Egyptian land and they were still strangers in so what happened was the Pharaoh he decided say wait a minute now I can I can these people commodities amen and just like the world see us today they see us as a they what they call it as human resource they manage this country a man was built on the backs of slave labor amen and that's why the country is probably wonder it is one of the richest countries because they had through that time and they came up a man through that time on free labor while everyone else was treating their people well and paying their people in and doing them right Amen this country came up on the backs of slaves delayed the railroads and roads and cotton fields and they made plenty of money selling all kind of things with free labor see so this is the same thing the same spirit was they back then that Pharaoh saw an opportunity say well we got these people down here and we can use them a man to make us wealthy it's the same thing that's going on today but see God heard the cry of his people know there was a man now by the name of Abraham who solved the the things that the children of Israel was going through and he would come in and he would pray say Lord deliver the people and today we see the same thing see that the thing that the people are going through these are God's children and God's people and we see that there that the backs of the taskmaster it is on them trying to Amen to make them a conforming to this world image it's the same thing that's going on the day my brothers and sisters amen so we see thank you brother now he says here it is my home believe that you know give us a call without repentance every time God wants to do something he has the right man on the scene at the right time there's a time he says that a brick mason anybody can leave blocks but it takes a Master Mason to turn the corner so anytime God is getting ready to to make a move or to do something he has to have a man there a man that has the ability a man to to to to to uh give it's not that he has any special ability he's just a chosen vessel amen and Moses just happened to be a chosen vessel from birth or the Prophet said that he had a peculiar birth amen and it had a lot to do with it his mother and his father they're praying amen and at the age of 40 God finally called Abraham to his call he called Abraham and he said I he realized that he started to feel something on the inside he began to look at those people and he and he felt something for him what was that that was the heart of God a man dealing with Moses a man he was the Prophet said that he looked through the same window that Pharaoh was looking through Pharaoh saw commodity jump moves I saw God's people okay he saw a commodity Moses all God's people amen and that's how we should be today we look at men and women that are trapped in the system of this world trapped in bondage of sorts of things trapped in a denominational system in a religious system trapped in in in in all kinds of things that this world is offering one day we should have a compassion for these people that say to say kids is something I can do for you because we were there at one time I know I was there at one time amen and we should have that sort of heart the same heart that God had for the people amen and when he's seen at the time the people was going he need this and he was born a peculiar child and then he became at the age of about 40 years old a man that God called him to his purpose a man but the people misunderstood Moses he said the people misunderstood Moses this is not an I get this close the hardest thing the hardest thing for God has ever had to deal with is to with people is to get one mortal to believe another but say that again the hardest thing that God ever had to deal with was to get one mortal to believe another that's the hardest thing ever has been done to get one mortar to believe well they believe Jesus was the son he said they believed that he was the son of God they believed in God but he said him being a man making himself equal with God they were like I came by that I came by that imagine at that time when went when Jesus was on the scene amen and this man here had the opportunity you standing right there in front of God manifested in flesh God manifested the fullness of the Godhead bodily standing there in front of you in a fleshly flaw and all you can come up with is you being a man thinking you equal with God now that same person he said those things and then there was another lady who who who had seen the things that he had done and her face was so ignited she said I know if I can just touch to him of his garment I'll be made whole she and he said beard under you according to your faith be it unto you according to your faith a man now he said being a poor peasant a man born in a manger with a background like he had from a family raised up one garment and he lived away he did not even a place to lay his head said foxes have dens and birds have nests but the Son of man has no place to lay his head how he could that man be the Son of God how could that be he claimed to be but he was he was the son of God now they believed it but it was too late for them their destination had been sealed away those who rejected him now they came to the belief but it was too late their destination had been sealed away amen now when the angel came to the servant if you get this he says now when the angel came to your servant here he said if you get the people to believe now that's a hard thing to do if you can ever get the people to believe how many believers are God all you have to do is believe Christ you believe the he goes now now now now that's not the question that he's trying to get to you tonight I'm glad you believe in Christ I'm glad you believe in the Holy Ghost that makes you a Christian amen that makes you a Christian but that is not what I'm trying to get you to you now I get to that when you make the altar call you must believe them first he's talking about believe in Christ believing the Holy Ghost if you're not in connection with them you'll never know this but as much as you believe in them you still got to believe that I'm telling you the truth of what I'm saying is the truth now this is the prophets object so see we can parallel the Prophet to Moses that was up there was a pillar of fire that attracted Moses on the mountain and told Moses to go back I have heard the cry of the people in need you go back and deliver the people go back with a message Moses say I'm not an eloquent speaker I can't deliver these people on my own how can I do this he said Moses what is that you have in your hand he said I had this is a stick he'd say throw down the stick he threw down a stick it turned into a serpent he said that'll be one sign and then he told him he said the others the voice of the other side he's gone he gave Moses two signs he said if they don't believe the first one that they'll believe the second a man he said just go and I'll be with you so it wasn't Moses delivering the people he was just a vessel that God was using it was compelling it was Christ all alone because Moses Moses by faith we seen that net in Hebrews say by faith he believed in seeing him who invisible Moses had a revelation of who he was talking to of who was leading him so the people had to believe Moses he said if you could get the people to believe you amen and the people had to understand that God was not going to come down and reveal in the pillar of fire to all him he was going to have one man in his hand one man in his hand and they had to believe that one man a man and that's the same thing today a man God sent a prophet like it unto Moses a man so he said he said the Christians if you have you can get you to believe now what I'm trying to get you to to get you to make the altar call you must believe then the Holy Ghost first you must believe in Christ first but much as you believe in them you still have to believe that I'm telling you the truth of what is the truth amen now when the people began to cry out God do this for us send us to deliver send us that he saved as thousands of people dying yearly of cancer yearly of all of these different things he said God heard the cries of the people and if he heard the cries of the people we were here just last night we meet here every other Tuesday the sisters meet here every other Tuesday for prayer me.we you don't think God hear the cries of the people he hears the cries of the people amen and if you have to believe and have faith that God hears the cries of people and he is willing he wants to answer the prayers amen but it's all it's up to our faith a man we're gonna get into her to see how that faith he says it's like a guitar it's like a string on an instrument sometime that face has to come up here and your faith may be down here but it has to be tuned up and he says whenever that faith gets up to that level there's no devil that can stay keep you in bondage I don't care what I don't care what it is amen now he says now God gave him two signs and he said you're going to perform this sign that we're casting a serpent down or a snake or the rod down and he said you if they won't believe that one didn't L believed the other one they'll believe the fray don't believe the first sign they'll believe the second one God delivered his people out of bondage back there from under the Egyptians so he can deliver the people under the bondage of sickness because he did that for a purpose now the signs what was the signs for the sign that he gave he did the same thing to the Prophet in this thing it was not the signs don't heal you it is to anoint your faith to believe that the same God a man that did it back then the same God is here today to do the same very exact same thing when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says that is the earnest of your salvation is that right in other words it is the downpayment and it'll make you feel like like if you don't if the down payment or make you feel a man like this what about when we received the full benefit it'll be glorious a man he said that we see the healing healing is just a down payment for the changing of your body amen if you don't have the faith a man for the healing how are you gonna have faith for a rapture how are you gonna have faith a man for body change amen uh he says well then you raise again and have an immortal body there's how many believe that the resurrection and you were raised and having em what about divine healing it's only the down payment you see that he said he was talking in but I'm saying today you'll see you'll see coming to this platform and we've seen already where he field cancer he's healed all sorts of things a man and it's gonna be other things a man that that happened right here you'll see blind eyes come open a man you'll see the Deaf beginning to here you'll see the dumb began to talk you'll see cancer being healed you'll see diabetes being cured you'll see blood pressure being taken care of you'll see tuberculosis being healed you'll see this in our midst and you have to have that faith to believe if it's any doubt and what makes that guy be that you don't believe the hour that you're living in that the what like what causes you're the daddy that you don't have the revelation of a who you are be who he is and his desire to bring these things to pass and you don't have a revelation of the Audi but that we're living in this is the time this is the time for the manifestations of the sons and daughters of God right now is the time you know if once you can you can get to that like that evidence in that black faith see the scripture said by faith that he did these things amen by faith it has to be according to our faith and what's going to elevate our faith the revelation of the gospel the unfolding of Jesus Christ into our heart the unfolding of the gospel the unveiling of the truth amen you can't even worship unless you're worshipping in truth there are so many there's so many out there in the world today that are worshiping worshiping sincerely worshiping and feeling and anointing but worshiping in error you cannot worship in error if even worshipping God or your worshipping a graven image or your worshipping a graven image there is no middle of the road it's either your worshipping God or your worshipping the devil by accident thinking you're worshiping God Cain and Abel both brought their fruits they both worship team brought his fruit basket God did not even accept it did not accept his worship Abel brought a bloody lamb that was slain with a sharp rod he told him if you will go back and worship like your brother I will accept your sacrifice and he couldn't do it he couldn't do it so you bring that up to the day there's so many worshiping worshiping in error and not worshiping who they think they're worshipping why because they had a problem or they have a problem accepting or believing what a man say there's been so many times I've been in this message and I've tried many at times to talk to people we need a lot of times see but you know what it's not even putting the profit picture up because they confuses people hello look ya'll worship in a man no we're not worshiping the man you see that pillar of fire over his head that's the same color fire Amen that not Palo Alto the same full of fire that Moses followed who was it God Almighty that's who we're worshiping we're just not worshipping in error we are right in line with the scripture right in line with the scripture that's how a man we can be called out of bondage why because we believe amen are the words of this prophet and we walked out of those denominational systems that were held us bound and he meant to tell us the days of miracles are past and told us that all of these isms and schisms and things that was just not in the Bible I'm able to believe that God invited that man amen according to Malachi 4 according to revelation 10 7 a man according to st. Luke 17 and 30 a man you'll see here we're at one point the prophet of God was talking he said I used to be ashamed to say these things but there arose even in him a boldness to say the things that had happened to him he said that uh that angel had came to me the same way the angel came to Moses and gave him two signs gave him a sign in his hand he said it was a vibration that was the only way that he could describe it that he was able to put his hands on the people and he could tell what their sickness was he can tell if they had or whatever was he said now it came up with some haptic learning because he said that he had a problem sometimes the finally sometime women's sicknesses and different things like that they meant the other one that he would be able to discern the thoughts and the intents of your heart he'll be able to look into your life and go back and see what's going on in your life and tell you who you are where you come from what you did tonight they made me say not those things don't heal you but what they do do is get your faith to a level that you know that you wouldn't a presence of Almighty God amen well to get you in the presence of Almighty God and let me tell you something my brother's sister that was to get your faith up for a healing but healing is a minor the healing is a minor a man we are Moses brought the children of Israel out of Egypt they came across the wilderness they made they seen all kind of signs and wonders they seemed the Red Sea open up they made that same stick amen that Moses hair was the stuff the stick of judgment he took that stick and he raised it over the Red Sea and God looked through the pillar of fire angry eyes and that see pull back so that the people to God to walk across on dry land the people walked across old dry land and he killed renew the easier tried to follow him and then they all tried that same wilderness journey they wit not all to the rock and he had water come out of a rock because the people had a need that same journey he took that same stick he made it put a sling on it because the people were sick for the hill and other people say look on this what was it it was a type of the cross it was a type of judgment your sins already on the cross it was a revelation amen of what was to come amen and some of those people still only wish only went to signification and it was only to any man that had enough faith to like my brother was talking about Sunday cross over that Jordan they had to fade that he brought us through this he brought us through the Red Sea he brought us through this wilderness he delivered from the hands of this enemy that we are more than able to go over and take the land to face the Hittites to face the lead life what are these examples of demonic spirits a men that try to control us and keep us from what the full manifestation of being the sons of God and then once you get the Holy Ghost he said you didn't say that you never stopped fighting hey man you're still gonna have to fight you're still gonna have to battle you're gonna have to battle sickness you're gonna have to about a financial issue you're gonna have to battle all sorts of thing but it's bringing you to perfection it's bringing you to a place that you're going to conquer you're gonna continue to conquer you're gonna continue to conquer and the Bible say that your border will expand he said it won't happen fast but you're gonna stay right there and you're gonna continue to conquer until you have already conquered everything he said you're more than a conqueror because he's already conquered it for you all you have to do is accept it all you have to do is accept it amen he says here at one time I was afraid to make this statement but here's what it is friends that I can't get you to those things those diseases are told it's perfect the secrets of their heart if they don't believe the first one I can't get them on the first one and then they'll come on the second one it goes right back and begin to dig up their lives and tell them now what that got to do he says now give me your undivided attention for a few minutes friends it he said that doesn't heal anybody that only brings a person's faith up when that person here he might come and tell me he's got faith but I know his words I know his word for it but when you're under that anointing as it is right now he can can't come and deceive that I know when he's got faith or not he might think he has faced faith there's the thing that the people think they have faith when they haven't got faith isn't that right but when there's when they weigh down here and saying they got faith he said it isn't up here it's like tuning a string on an instrument when it comes and comes and coincides with this up here the thing is ready any demon that got that person bound has got to turn loose when that type of faith comes when that type of faith comes amen we we have to my brothers and sisters get back to in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve didn't worry about nothing they didn't worry about anything because they had there was a certain faith there I think that was a certain kasi there was no sin they didn't know sin Sam brought unbelief that's what's in it was unbelief there was no faith there I'll give you an example deficient ELO's through the scientific mind and see that's just it the world through education they all they have because they don't do not believe in the supernatural they don't believe in a miracle working God they lean on education and science to science well as five loaves of bread and two fish so maybe you can feed seven people so well if you cut the fish in half that make for half and five loaves of bread so if you take the bread and cut it in half then that gonna divide the bread up and you can go a little further now if you take them and fire them have that made Gordon good I see science device to feed a multitude but God multiplies the God multiplies so that is the faith a man that we have to get back to we have to get see our thinking is is is scientific who it being and the scientific thinking that there has to be something here for something to happen and no but we have to get back to even thinking that God said it that settles it it's going to be he said these signs shall follow them that believe it's gonna be he said I'm healed a man that's what it is I like my brother brother brother brother and if I have to believe all the way to the grave all the way to the grave lies arrested in the grave three days and it still came out still came out I'm gonna continue to believe in half faith amen so we have to understand my brothers and sisters now he says the people has as far as it comes to healing it is your faith in God your pastor can't anoint you with all in your own church and have faith in God it'll bring the same result just because the Prophet is no longer here that same vilified that same vilifies here that same pill of fire amen the word Amen what did he come to do is the opening of the word he came to tie up all of those loose ends so that we can have a perfect faith because we couldn't have a perfect faith without a perfect word we couldn't have a perfect faith but we have now a perfect word a man that was opened up about by your profit a twentieth century profit a man we were talking about Moses and we saw the things that Moses did he brought like I said there were three Exodus he brought her people out of a church out of her people and then a bride out of a church a man and that's what's happening he's calling a caller people out of a Gentile bride amen a Gentile out of a church and then out of that church he called us out of lady of seal into the bride age what's that crossing over Jordan into this fair land a man were weakened how our faith has to match a man and that that where we are if we say we're in a varieties if we're say we're in the full manifestation a man of God let's like it unless hold to that let's let our faith rise amen because I believe my brothers and sisters that we're living at a time where now is the time to have that faith if you believe that that a rapture is round the corner if you believe that the rapture is at him our faith must match that belief our faith must match that belief no matter what we're going through no matter what the situation might be we have God as God has heard the cry of his people he's heard the cries the people that he has sent the deliverer the deliverer came and brought us into this marvelous light now let's continue to walk in the light of that word walking little in that light like Enoch did until we walk into that life and we walked right into the changing of his body we walked right into a garment change now is the time my brothers and sisters now is the time to have the full faith amen not just the faithful a financial blessing or the faithful or these are but a faith for a change about mortal bodies now I don't know if that sounds far-fetched but it's not but that's what it's gonna take by the open and a full revelation of this gospel that's where he promised the foolish that a manifestation an angel an angel came to Mary and said Mary you've been highly favored of the Lord and what he did was he planted a blood gene in the womb of Mary amen and and when one day and she she went through the tribe masters and and and through nine months of of caring a menace child a man that one day that was a manifestation there was a manifestation of a Christ right there standing before the bride you've been found highly favored and in your womb has been placed amen the Word of God a sea and that sea hey man has been watered it's been growing amen they have the faith amen to produce amen the full Christ again in this hour not saying that people think a minute that you're gonna walk the streets amen and you're gonna just be no that's not it but you have a faith you walk because you walk circumspectly you don't walk to the order of this world you don't walk to scientific thinking you walk to a supernatural God you want you to believe for this word that one day that soon your body is going to be changed from immortal to mortal to immortality and the healing is just a downpayment my brothers and sister to bring your faith to a level to believe nothing is impossible nothing is impossible nothing is impossible and that's where we're at my brothers and sisters amen you love the Lord amen let us stay in our feet a man nothing is impossible my brothers and sisters I believe that uh we're in a time amen in this gospel that that that our faith must be renewed musicians come if you will I'm faith must be ignited amen our our desires and things must be firmly placed on on the Lord amen because my brothers and sisters we're living we're living in I mean if this ain't the last day you please tell me what it is if this is not the last day and he promised he promised that there'll be a full manifestation amen of four manifestations of the sons of God amen so our hope to receive something let us pray most gracious God Lord we thank you Lord God for this little thought Lord God of study or father God on the Hebrews law of God and door just looking at the faith of Moses so father God and the things that your prophet brought out on on this wonderful soldier Lord God and how Lord God the things our Father
