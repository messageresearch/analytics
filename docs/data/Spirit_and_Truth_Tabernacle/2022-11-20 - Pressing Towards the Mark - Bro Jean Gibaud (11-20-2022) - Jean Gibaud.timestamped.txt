[25:25] [Music]
[25:27] um
[25:27] um I wanted to uh also just give thanks
[25:31] I know that many came and helped on on
[25:35] Thursday they had a a another turkey
[25:39] drive and a lot of turkeys were given
[25:42] out to different ones that uh you know
[25:44] maybe they have neither maybe they don't
[25:46] have any but they got blessed anyway
[25:48] with the turkey and uh it was just a
[25:50] wonderful wonderful opportunity and as
[25:53] we are you know finishing that going
[25:55] into our Christmas season just asking uh
[25:58] that uh we give gift cards for the
[26:00] Christmas Eve we and like I said we'll
[26:03] have some cards we're gonna have
[26:05] something there for you just some cars
[26:06] so you can fill out and just put your
[26:08] gift card in and just drop it in a
[26:09] little box we'll have that set up for
[26:11] you uh but we want to just be a blessing
[26:13] Amen to those in our community and just
[26:17] just spread the love of Christ and don't
[26:18] don't just
[26:20] sign the card God bless you make that
[26:22] the end of the of your signature but
[26:25] write a little note put a script to
[26:26] something just to encourage people amen
[26:30] that Jesus loves them amen you don't
[26:32] know who that card might go into the
[26:34] hands of so pray over it ask God to give
[26:37] you inspiration uh for what you're
[26:39] saying because you don't know what it
[26:40] might say to somebody so we want to do
[26:43] all or we can amen like I told you the
[26:46] turkeys were actually taken care of
[26:48] because somebody donated five thousand
[26:50] dollars to the to the pantry so we were
[26:51] able to take care of that but uh but we
[26:54] we still want to do our part amen here
[26:56] in the community so let's just let's
[26:57] just get prepared for that you can start
[26:59] bringing that and you know again we're I
[27:01] have cards for you to fill out other
[27:03] things one of the sisters that mentioned
[27:04] to us it'll be good that if the young
[27:07] people can be a part of that giving out
[27:10] when we're giving out those cards we'll
[27:12] let you know what day we want to do it
[27:14] but if our young people get involved in
[27:16] that that would be really really good uh
[27:18] sometimes our youth don't realize how
[27:20] blessed they are
[27:25] you know they don't realize how blessed
[27:27] they are and to you run into people that
[27:29] don't have what you have amen
[27:32] all right amen other kids that they
[27:35] ain't got what you got so so sometimes
[27:38] it's just good to you know get out of
[27:39] the community and just look around
[27:40] sometime even even I I encourage people
[27:43] travel go go to other countries uh
[27:45] you'll stop complaining
[27:48] amen We complain about the least of
[27:51] things and uh you know but people go
[27:54] through a lot more than what we go
[27:56] through here amen my God your lights off
[27:59] uh you couldn't last five minutes with
[28:01] them like so if you calling FPL you're
[28:04] these people go with that likes all the
[28:06] time
[28:06] right so so we just we just thank the
[28:09] Lord amen but if we can we try to get
[28:11] some of our youth involved we'll let you
[28:13] know the date and time that we want to
[28:14] try to do that so uh keep that in mind

[29:19] scripture and a man just a portion of a
[29:22] quote
[29:22] two scriptures as they are making their
[29:25] preparation a Luke 18 Luke 18 verse 15
[29:30] through 17. amen Luke 18 verse 15
[29:35] through 17 it says and they brought unto
[29:38] him also infants
[29:40] that he would touch them but when his
[29:43] disciples saw it they rebuked them but
[29:46] Jesus called them unto him and said
[29:49] suffered a little children to come unto
[29:51] me and forbid them not for such for of
[29:54] such is the kingdom of God verily I say
[29:57] unto you whosoever shall not receive the
[30:00] kingdom of God as a little child shall
[30:02] end no wise enter therein Amen brother
[30:08] Branham told us in the message of
[30:09] paradox it says now therefore we bring
[30:11] them and dedicate them any mothers any
[30:15] church any Crete any color anything else
[30:20] we dedicate all little children to the
[30:23] Lord Jesus Christ I know in the Catholic
[30:25] Church what they do is they sprinkle
[30:27] sprinkle kids I remember having a friend
[30:28] on my job and uh man he never went to
[30:32] church never never went to church I
[30:34] remember he had his first son
[30:37] you say Jack I'm going to church on
[30:38] Sunday you going to church never went to
[30:42] church I said okay he said yeah I'm
[30:43] going to church we're going to have the
[30:44] baby uh dedicated I'm like okay so it
[30:48] wasn't dedicated they wanted the baby
[30:50] would be sprinkled because in their in
[30:52] in the Catholic faith they say if a
[30:54] child is sprinkled then it guarantees
[30:56] them access to heaven and I said no that
[31:00] ain't true at all that child got to
[31:02] repent at some point in time they need
[31:05] to recognize that they're centers and
[31:06] they have to repent of their sins so
[31:09] um you know we we don't we don't
[31:10] sprinkle babies but we dedicate them to
[31:13] the Lord we pray over the parents that
[31:15] God would bless them uh to be able to
[31:18] raise the child the right way the first
[31:19] example of Christianity that the child
[31:21] can see is in their parents amen so
[31:25] praise the Lord another scripture I just
[31:28] want to read really quick over Jeremiah
[31:31] it's from the book of Jeremiah
[31:35] chapter 1 verse 4.
[31:38] then the word of the Lord came unto me
[31:40] saying
[31:42] before I formed thee in the belly I knew
[31:45] thee and before thou camest forth out of
[31:48] the womb
[31:50] sanctify thee and I ordained thee a
[31:54] prophet
[31:55] unto the Nations praise the Lord amen

[32:46] that you've brought to brother Jerry and
[32:49] sister Melissa

[32:54] back to you as you've given him to them

[32:59] Little Child
[33:01] God that you would keep of all of his
[33:03] days

[33:09] example of Christianity that he could
[33:11] ever follow and Lord we just trust o God
[33:14] that you would keep them Father from the
[33:15] things of this world and God we realize
[33:18] that there's so much that is against
[33:20] them but God if you are for him then who
[33:23] can be against him so we pray Lord for
[33:26] Jeremiah Shepherd Lord that you would

[33:35] the life amen a life of service and
[33:38] dedication to you God father we pray
[33:41] that you would just meet every need that
[33:43] these parents would have with God in
[33:45] raising him we thank you Lord for your

[44:21] softness by our hearts
[44:23] Heavenly Father we just come before your
[44:26] throne of grace father we're just so
[44:28] appreciative of what you've done for us
[44:30] the Lord and father we just ask that you
[44:32] just come and minister to us in a very
[44:33] special way you know the needs of your
[44:36] people dear Lord and as a mortal man I
[44:37] would fail the Lord to meet any of these
[44:39] needs but the God there's a there
[44:42] there's a redeemer the lord and there is
[44:44] a a savior someone that we could turn to
[44:46] and I prayed to God that you would just
[44:48] come in a very special Mighty way and
[44:51] minister to every knee this morning to
[44:53] God exceed every expectation the Lord
[44:55] have preeminism this morning's service
[44:57] take full control to God we commit all
[45:00] things into your hands and we'll be
[45:01] careful to give you the praise and glory
[45:03] that you alone are worthy of and the
[45:05] bride says amen amen God bless you
[45:09] Saints it's certainly good to be back in
[45:10] the house of the Lord that's all the
[45:12] singing amen if you have your Bibles
[45:15] turn with me the Philippians chapter 3.
[45:18] always appreciate the invitation to come
[45:20] uh uh come this way and have some
[45:23] fellowship and uh good to see brother
[45:25] Smiley didn't think I'd see him and so
[45:27] it's good to see him again and just
[45:29] appreciate him appreciate every one of
[45:30] you amen just appreciate what the Lord's
[45:33] doing in our lives amen you love him
[45:35] this morning
[45:38] appreciate Brothers jacked up it's just
[45:40] uh I always say this you know when um
[45:42] brother Brown says that the closest
[45:43] thing to happen here on Earth is the
[45:44] pulpit
[45:45] and when you stand behind The Minister's
[45:47] desk you know there's a great deal of
[45:49] responsibility that comes with that and
[45:52] um I know you didn't come to hear
[45:54] Brother Gene but you came to hear from
[45:55] God
[45:57] so if I could just step into that
[45:59] channel then I know you'll be blessed
[46:00] amen
[46:02] so Ephesians chapter I mean Philippians
[46:05] chapter 3 just a simple thought that I
[46:07] thought I'd just share with you
[46:09] we'll read that verse
[46:11] 10.
[46:12] through 14 but we'll draw our our focus
[46:15] and our attention from verse 13 and 14
[46:17] but we'll start at verse 10 so
[46:19] Philippians Philippians chapter 3
[46:22] verse 10.
[46:25] that I may know him and the power of his
[46:28] resurrection
[46:30] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[46:33] being made comfortable
[46:35] unto his death
[46:37] if by any means I might attain unto the
[46:40] resurrection of the Dead
[46:43] not as though I had already attained
[46:46] either were already perfect
[46:49] but I will but I follow after if that I
[46:52] may apprehend that for which also I am
[46:56] apprehended of Christ Jesus
[47:00] brethren
[47:02] I counted I count not myself to have
[47:05] apprehended
[47:07] but this one thing I do
[47:10] forgetting those things which are behind
[47:15] and reaching forth onto those things
[47:18] which are before
[47:20] that's Paramount
[47:22] forgetting those things which are behind
[47:26] and reaching forth unto those things
[47:29] which are before
[47:31] and then verse 14
[47:33] I press
[47:35] toward the mark for the prize of the
[47:38] High Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[47:42] may the Lord add his Blessing to the
[47:44] reading of the word he may be seated
[47:48] what a scripture
[47:51] and uh we're just gonna take our timer
[47:53] so just bear with me as we kind of build
[47:55] on the foundation
[47:57] but I like this scripture because it
[48:00] really resonates with me especially in
[48:03] the day in the hour that we're living in
[48:06] because uh there's so many things that
[48:09] are causing us uh to weigh us down to
[48:12] cause burden in our lives
[48:14] and um
[48:16] you know I thank God by his grace that
[48:18] the only reason that I'm here is because
[48:20] of his grace the only reason why you're
[48:22] here is because of his grace
[48:26] but it's God who strengthened me in
[48:28] Christ Jesus
[48:30] so the Bible talks about how Paul is
[48:33] trying to
[48:35] um ascertain or apprehend or achieve
[48:40] something that is pretty remarkable
[48:44] and in that he says Brethren I count not
[48:47] myself to have apprehended it
[48:50] but this one thing and he's trying to
[48:54] bring your attention and focus on one
[48:58] thing
[49:00] because so many times you know we could
[49:03] easily be distracted by so many things
[49:07] but if we could have a singular focus
[49:12] a singular attention on what you're
[49:15] trying to achieve it changes everything
[49:18] yeah
[49:18] we we were we were beginning to even
[49:21] learn this in school and business school
[49:23] where where they talk about you know the
[49:25] idea of multitasking you know some
[49:26] people's like you could multitask well
[49:28] that you know it may work for some but
[49:30] you it may not work for all and in most
[49:32] cases for the sum that it works quality
[49:34] is compromised
[49:36] because you're multitasking and I was
[49:39] telling my team I said you know I come
[49:40] to the conclusion I can't do this and do
[49:42] this and I got to do one thing I got to
[49:44] stay focused on that one thing and
[49:46] that's really important and so Paul is
[49:48] telling me this one thing I do not
[49:51] multiple things just one thing I do is
[49:54] forgetting those things which are behind
[49:57] because the devil has ways of reminding
[50:00] you of your past
[50:02] telling you that you have failures in
[50:05] your past telling you that you have
[50:07] shortcomings in your past telling you
[50:09] that you are nobody in your past and the
[50:12] only thing I could tell the devil that
[50:14] was my past but that is not my future
[50:17] that is not my present that is not my
[50:21] current circumstance
[50:23] so I forget the things that are behind
[50:27] me because the things that are behind me
[50:28] are covered by the blood
[50:30] if God can't see it then the devil can't
[50:33] bring it to my attention
[50:36] so I forget those things that are behind
[50:40] and I'm reaching forth and if you think
[50:43] about it it's as different an individual
[50:45] is running a race and they're racing and
[50:49] they're striving towards that Finishing
[50:51] Line are you still picking me up I feel
[50:53] like I lost them but I'm striving
[50:55] towards that Finishing Line and you're
[50:57] racing and you're racing and you see
[50:59] that the that the end is in sight and
[51:03] something might be pulling you back but
[51:05] because you're determined because you're
[51:09] committed you're willing to go that
[51:11] extra mile and so you reach out because
[51:13] you want to reach that Finishing Line
[51:17] and so Paul understood that concept
[51:20] and he says I press towards the mark
[51:25] now the very word press means move a
[51:31] cause to move
[51:32] into position of contact
[51:36] with something by exerting continuous
[51:40] physical Force
[51:45] so when you're pressing for something
[51:47] you got to constantly be in Relentless
[51:51] Pursuit
[51:53] amen amen amen
[51:55] because being a Christian is not
[51:58] anything that you means for you to be
[52:00] casual
[52:02] you gotta constantly be on the move
[52:05] you got to constantly be on the go
[52:10] we got to be constantly marching towards
[52:13] something
[52:14] I am not satisfied where I am now I'm
[52:17] constantly trying to be better
[52:20] I am constantly trying to live a more
[52:22] Christian Life I am constantly trying to
[52:25] reflect the image of Jesus Christ
[52:27] right so I pressed towards the mark
[52:31] Against All Odds when things are against
[52:33] you you're still pressing towards the
[52:35] battle
[52:37] and you will have circumstances that
[52:39] you're faced with
[52:40] situations that hold you back
[52:44] but there has to be a desire
[52:47] that looks at the reward and that the
[52:50] reward is far greater than the
[52:53] circumstances that you're dealing with
[52:57] you know
[52:59] the prize outweighs the circumstances
[53:05] and so even Jesus understood that he
[53:07] says the Gates of Hell will not Prevail
[53:10] against it so meaning that you will have
[53:13] some opposition
[53:15] and as a Christian and bear with me as
[53:19] I'm building this Foundation as a
[53:21] Christian
[53:22] you find yourself that you're always on
[53:25] the move for God
[53:29] and the reason being is because God is a
[53:32] god of movement
[53:34] right the Bible says in the beginning
[53:37] God created the Heaven and the Earth
[53:39] period
[53:41] and the Bible says this and I want to
[53:43] draw this analogy that the Earth was
[53:46] without form
[53:47] and void
[53:50] that was the condition that the Earth
[53:52] was in
[53:54] a type of you and I
[53:57] with a form
[53:59] with a void
[54:01] without God
[54:04] but the only thing about that scripture
[54:07] in verse 2 of Genesis the Bible says the
[54:10] spirit of God moved
[54:14] and the only the only way that you could
[54:17] bring something into movement it has to
[54:20] be alive
[54:22] that's the reason why the prophet says a
[54:23] church without any emotion is dead
[54:28] you cannot come into contact with God
[54:31] and be the same person
[54:33] you cannot tell me when God has brought
[54:35] you through victories that you're casual
[54:37] about it you give God the glory you
[54:41] cannot tell me when you overcome
[54:42] obstacles that you don't get excited God
[54:44] was in that movement
[54:47] yeah because my Bible tells me that God
[54:50] is a consuming fire and I don't know
[54:53] about you but when I get lit by fire I
[54:55] don't stand still I don't sit down I get
[54:58] up and I start moving because that tells
[55:00] me some things don't fire for God
[55:06] [Music]
[55:10] we're going to be tested along this way
[55:12] you're being tested along this way
[55:15] and if life is good for you you might
[55:18] want to take a check on which side of
[55:19] Glory you're walking on
[55:21] all right
[55:23] cause the devil doesn't like to leave us
[55:25] the Sons and Daughters of God Alone
[55:29] there's a constant Relentless Pursuit
[55:33] after God
[55:35] your Christian walk yesterday was for
[55:37] yesterday today's different
[55:42] gotta give God praise daily
[55:45] you got to know what you want out of
[55:47] this
[55:48] if you decided to come to church you got
[55:50] to know what you came here for not to
[55:52] see sister and so so not to her brother
[55:54] so and so not to get caught up in the
[55:57] latest rumors gossip but you came here
[55:59] for something personal something more
[56:01] deep something more more more meaningful
[56:05] yeah Glory
[56:09] there's a story in the Bible
[56:11] about a woman that had a blood issue
[56:15] the Bible says that she had this issue
[56:18] for 12 years
[56:22] 12 years
[56:24] and during those 12 years the Bible also
[56:26] says according to Mark 5 that she went
[56:29] and saw many positions
[56:31] she went to the experts and the experts
[56:34] couldn't help her
[56:36] she went to Dr so-and-so that was the
[56:39] best in town and Dr so-and-so couldn't
[56:41] help her
[56:42] in addition to that the Bible says that
[56:45] she made many expenses
[56:47] come on somebody y'all could relate to
[56:49] what the Bible is saying this is talking
[56:51] about some of you
[56:53] we've gone to doctors we've gone to
[56:55] experts and it's interesting because you
[56:57] go to the doctor and the doctor said I
[56:59] send you to the experts the expert says
[57:01] I send you to the specialist the
[57:02] specialist said well go back and see
[57:03] your doctor
[57:09] and you spend this and you spend that
[57:11] you gotta buy medications for this You
[57:13] Gotta Buy medications for that and none
[57:15] of that really helps you
[57:19] and she had endured this Affliction for
[57:22] 12 solid years
[57:25] and one day she decided to go to church
[57:29] because she heard of the name of Jesus
[57:32] There's Something About the Name of
[57:34] Jesus that carries weight Something
[57:36] About the Name of Jesus that says you
[57:38] know what all my prayers will be
[57:40] answered
[57:42] and so Jesus decides to go for a walk
[57:45] and the Bible says there was a throng of
[57:46] people
[57:48] a throng of people that's through
[57:51] themselves at Jesus
[57:54] can you just imagine a crowd of people
[57:56] that's probably three to four times the
[57:58] crowd that's what that's here this
[58:00] morning
[58:01] throwing themselves at Jesus
[58:04] and that lady decided to go and paid
[58:08] Jesus a visit
[58:10] but she didn't come to church because
[58:11] somebody drug her the church
[58:13] she didn't come to church because she
[58:15] felt obligated to fulfill a religious
[58:17] Duty
[58:18] but she had in her mind that if she
[58:22] could only touch the Helm of His Garment
[58:23] you see so she knew what she wanted to
[58:26] get out of the service
[58:29] I don't go to church just to go to
[58:31] church I want something out of the
[58:33] presence of God
[58:36] I want to get something out of it before
[58:39] she even went to Jesus she heard about
[58:41] him and she says I know what I need to
[58:44] do all I need is just to Touch the Hem
[58:47] of His Garment
[58:52] and throngs the people
[58:55] here she is she gets the scene of where
[58:58] the crowd has assembled
[59:00] think about that saint
[59:03] and normally when people look at that
[59:05] situation it says there's no way that I
[59:07] have access to Jesus
[59:10] there's no way that this promise belongs
[59:12] to me
[59:13] there's no way I could obtain this it's
[59:17] too difficult it's unreachable all right
[59:21] that's what the devil would like you to
[59:23] think
[59:24] that house I wanted is unreachable
[59:27] that job I wanted is unreachable that
[59:30] position I wanted is unreachable the
[59:32] church I want is one reachable
[59:35] come on Saints if we could credit God
[59:38] who created Heavens in the Earth the
[59:40] great universe that I'm sure God can
[59:43] take care of your little problems this
[59:45] morning
[59:46] [Music]
[59:46] [Applause]
[59:49] reaching Jesus seemed unreachable to her
[59:53] but she did not look at the
[59:55] circumstances she looked at the promise
[59:58] [Music]
[59:59] if Dr sorcer can heal me if Sergeant
[1:00:03] saucer can hear me and I had to spend
[1:00:05] all these countless monies then I'm
[1:00:07] gonna Place everything I can to try to
[1:00:10] reach Jesus
[1:00:14] she labored
[1:00:17] she pressed away
[1:00:20] the crowds was pushing her back life is
[1:00:23] like that sometime it pushes you back
[1:00:25] knocks you down on your feet let the
[1:00:27] devil know you could put me down on my
[1:00:29] feet but there's a God that could Raise
[1:00:31] Me Up
[1:00:32] amen
[1:00:35] she got up and she thought she wiped the
[1:00:37] dust off of her and she pressed on
[1:00:41] everybody was touching Jesus and it
[1:00:44] didn't even stop Jesus from walking
[1:00:46] he still kept on walking
[1:00:49] Jesus was hearing all kinds of voices
[1:00:51] and noise and loud noises
[1:00:53] Jesus can you heal me Jesus I need this
[1:00:56] Jesus I need that but that little lady
[1:00:58] all she was doing when she had that
[1:01:00] blood issue the only thing that went
[1:01:01] through her mind was that when I went to
[1:01:02] Dr so-and-so they told me this didn't
[1:01:04] work and I got 12 years I got this I've
[1:01:06] been battling this for 12 years she knew
[1:01:08] what she wanted to get out of the
[1:01:09] service
[1:01:11] this was not another service and she
[1:01:13] didn't want this opportunity to pass her
[1:01:16] by
[1:01:18] this was her moment
[1:01:20] as Jesus was passing by she didn't even
[1:01:22] know if she would have another
[1:01:23] opportunity like this
[1:01:28] pressed
[1:01:30] she pressed
[1:01:32] she was relentless impressing would not
[1:01:35] give up
[1:01:37] the crowds pushed her away
[1:01:40] and finally
[1:01:43] as Jesus going by
[1:01:46] she reached out her hands she pressed
[1:01:48] towards the mark
[1:01:50] because she realized that the blood
[1:01:52] issue that has been an Affliction in our
[1:01:54] life for 12 solid years
[1:01:57] and the doctors who had filled her time
[1:01:59] and time again the medicines that could
[1:02:02] not treat her condition
[1:02:04] and the Bible says that her situation
[1:02:07] was getting worse
[1:02:12] God puts you in circumstances where the
[1:02:14] situation feels like it's so burdensome
[1:02:16] it doesn't seem like it's getting any
[1:02:18] better it seems like it's getting worse
[1:02:21] every time you pray it seems like it's
[1:02:24] getting worse every time you try to find
[1:02:26] courage it seems like it's just falling
[1:02:28] apart every time you try to fight you
[1:02:30] seem like you're getting beat up and
[1:02:31] getting knocked down but once the
[1:02:33] situation gets to a point where you
[1:02:35] can't go anymore God comes on the scene
[1:02:43] and that young lady she reaches out
[1:02:46] she stretches her arms
[1:02:49] pressing through the crowd if she can
[1:02:52] only touch
[1:02:54] the Helm of His Garment
[1:02:57] just a brush of His Garment
[1:03:00] and as the crowd was passing by that's
[1:03:02] all she needed she wasn't looking for
[1:03:04] medication she wasn't looking for a big
[1:03:07] name preacher she just said if I could
[1:03:09] just Touch the Hem of His Garment I just
[1:03:11] need to touch him
[1:03:13] that little bit of touch as the glimmer
[1:03:16] of that garment just passed by and she
[1:03:19] touched it
[1:03:21] touching Jesus is all that matters
[1:03:24] very glorious amen
[1:03:27] she grabbed a hold of that garment
[1:03:30] can you just imagine the magnitude of
[1:03:33] what that means
[1:03:36] she touched the Hem of His Garment mixed
[1:03:38] all the people that was touching Jesus
[1:03:41] God was walking
[1:03:43] and he stopped
[1:03:45] she caused the Creator
[1:03:49] of Heaven and Earth
[1:03:51] she caught the attention of God Almighty
[1:03:55] to come
[1:03:57] stop dead in this track and as simple of
[1:04:00] a statement as this was a simple of a
[1:04:02] question that was he says who touched me
[1:04:07] shy could buy a heavy burden
[1:04:11] there's something about the touch of
[1:04:13] Jesus that cause she he can better stop
[1:04:18] he says who touched me can you just
[1:04:20] imagine everybody just stood back and
[1:04:22] looked
[1:04:24] confused because of all that time that
[1:04:27] everybody was touching him
[1:04:28] he never said a thing he never responded
[1:04:32] they were they were they were hollering
[1:04:34] they were screaming but let me tell you
[1:04:35] serving God is more than hollering
[1:04:38] serving God is more than screaming you
[1:04:40] could do backflip in church and go live
[1:04:42] like the world that don't mean nothing
[1:04:43] it's how you serve God now when you're
[1:04:46] in the presence of your brothers and
[1:04:47] sisters it's how you serve God when
[1:04:49] you're out there in the world
[1:04:53] that's what makes a difference not what
[1:04:56] I see you is what they see you as
[1:04:59] what is your testimony out there
[1:05:03] they were hollering and shouting and
[1:05:05] carrying on didn't even cause Jesus to
[1:05:08] move
[1:05:08] but because she had a desire she had an
[1:05:11] anointing and she touched the Helm of
[1:05:13] His Garment it caused Jesus to stop and
[1:05:15] says who touched me
[1:05:21] even his disciples thought he was off
[1:05:23] the off the kind of off his ways
[1:05:26] what do you mean who touched you
[1:05:32] that's right I don't mean disrespectful
[1:05:33] but there's a lot of people here that
[1:05:34] touch you
[1:05:38] a lot of people
[1:05:40] touched him
[1:05:43] a lot of people hollering come on Saints
[1:05:46] we might be in a school building we may
[1:05:48] not be in an auditorium but we're
[1:05:50] touching Jesus we're inviting him right
[1:05:52] now Lord if I could test touch the Helm
[1:05:54] of your garment I may not be in a
[1:05:57] stadium but I know your presence is here
[1:05:59] this morning
[1:06:02] my house may not look like a palace but
[1:06:05] God you're invited in my house
[1:06:10] touching Jesus is all that matters
[1:06:16] the crowds somewhat moved back a little
[1:06:18] bit
[1:06:21] and the disciples was confused because
[1:06:23] that very actions of Jesus could be
[1:06:25] confusing to people sometimes
[1:06:29] he and they say everybody touched you
[1:06:32] he's like but yeah this was a different
[1:06:35] touch
[1:06:36] he says virtue
[1:06:39] up
[1:06:41] virtue
[1:06:43] went out for me
[1:06:49] and as the crowd kind of dispersed a
[1:06:51] little bit
[1:06:53] the woman comes into view
[1:06:55] and Jesus says your faith
[1:06:59] has made you all
[1:07:02] her faith
[1:07:05] the power
[1:07:07] to press on
[1:07:09] to cause God
[1:07:11] come on the scene
[1:07:13] you know I was thinking about a story
[1:07:15] just kind of on the theme of like how
[1:07:17] you could cause God to move on the scene
[1:07:18] and many of you probably know this story
[1:07:20] this mother that has this young man who
[1:07:23] got caught up with the wrong things and
[1:07:25] and he caught a disease he was dying of
[1:07:29] this disease
[1:07:31] but let me tell you no matter how grown
[1:07:32] a man may be that's the mama's boy
[1:07:36] there's something about that that child
[1:07:40] that's still mama's boy
[1:07:42] and he was dying of some sort of disease
[1:07:45] that was incurable
[1:07:47] and she began to pray and holler
[1:07:51] she needed God to come on the scene
[1:07:54] and the prophet listened to the Saints
[1:07:56] he was on his way to a trip
[1:08:01] think about this for a moment
[1:08:03] and there were people that was on the
[1:08:05] flight y'all know the story there were
[1:08:06] people that was in the plane
[1:08:08] the thing that bothered that that
[1:08:10] boggles my mind is that there were
[1:08:12] people that were probably you know
[1:08:14] families that was trying to get to other
[1:08:15] relatives
[1:08:17] business people that was trying to get
[1:08:19] to business meetings
[1:08:21] people that was trying to get to certain
[1:08:23] destination
[1:08:24] but that didn't matter to God
[1:08:27] a prayer of a mother caused a play to be
[1:08:30] grounded so that when a prophet could
[1:08:33] leave his seat to come and answer the
[1:08:35] prayer of a mother
[1:08:37] let me tell you Saints this is not only
[1:08:40] the books of Acts this is the books of
[1:08:42] act and fulfillment
[1:08:44] that didn't belong to that mother that
[1:08:47] belongs to every voice that's here this
[1:08:49] morning
[1:08:53] it didn't matter if the businessman
[1:08:56] missed his business A Mother's Prayer
[1:08:59] was too important for God
[1:09:00] [Applause]
[1:09:02] it didn't matter if you were running
[1:09:04] late to me with their relatives The Cry
[1:09:06] of a mother granted that plane
[1:09:08] [Music]
[1:09:12] if you could just speak your voice right
[1:09:14] now and say God hear my voice hear my
[1:09:17] prayer God will stop all things
[1:09:23] just to come and meet your needs
[1:09:33] speak the word
[1:09:37] in the middle of the battle David cried
[1:09:40] our son be still
[1:09:44] you have that commanding power in your
[1:09:46] voice
[1:09:49] press towards the mark of the prize of
[1:09:52] the High Calling
[1:09:55] there's another story
[1:09:58] I love stories because I could relate to
[1:10:00] them
[1:10:03] brother grandma was in a prayer line
[1:10:05] he was conducting a prayer
[1:10:09] and in the distance

[1:11:30] devil roll over you I am called for this
[1:11:32] generation to rise and prove that God is

[1:12:51] underneath them
[1:12:52] over them sue them she was determined to
[1:12:57] reach that promise and there's nothing
[1:12:59] that the devil could do to stop that
[1:13:07] and God started working on the other
[1:13:09] side

[1:13:46] she knew why she came to church do you
[1:13:48] know why you're here this morning
[1:13:51] you came here for a reason
[1:13:53] he said Lord I came here for a reason I
[1:13:56] come here to the Lord because I made a
[1:13:57] promise I believe that you're able to
[1:14:00] keep that promise
[1:14:06] press towards the mark
[1:14:09] of the prize of the High Calling
[1:14:13] you know there's another story in the
[1:14:14] Bible
[1:14:17] the Bible talks about
[1:14:19] David
[1:14:22] he was in the cave
[1:14:23] of a dullum
[1:14:27] in the Philistines had taken the land
[1:14:31] but he was with his mighty men
[1:14:35] and three of the 30 which is 10 percent
[1:14:40] and the tenth being holy so God said in
[1:14:42] the state funds
[1:14:44] he totally man went up to David
[1:14:47] and David just
[1:14:49] was reflecting
[1:14:52] about definitely
[1:14:56] and know how the water tastes
[1:15:01] you know I like Pepsi
[1:15:02] [Music]
[1:15:04] I love parrie
[1:15:07] something about water
[1:15:08] [Applause]
[1:15:10] and I appreciate man for their efforts
[1:15:12] but they can't replace god-given water
[1:15:15] it just it just quenches
[1:15:18] the body whenever you like you know when
[1:15:20] you step like it's a hot day we live in
[1:15:22] Florida so we know what hot days look
[1:15:23] like it's over 100 degrees and you're
[1:15:26] out there laboring and working hard and
[1:15:27] you're burning up a sweat and you go
[1:15:28] inside and you drink some water
[1:15:30] your whole body goes into a jubilee
[1:15:35] you with me
[1:15:36] and that was David
[1:15:38] he says oh
[1:15:41] if I could drink from the Waters of
[1:15:43] Bethlehem
[1:15:44] he he didn't look at any particular
[1:15:46] person
[1:15:48] he just remarked if I could just drink
[1:15:54] let me say
[1:15:56] sometimes you may not know a scripture
[1:15:59] but because you're so connected to God
[1:16:01] you act a certain way
[1:16:04] I don't know about y'all maybe I'm just
[1:16:06] preaching to myself but there's been
[1:16:07] times I come to situations like I don't
[1:16:08] have a scripture for that but I just
[1:16:10] know that's just not christ-like
[1:16:14] sure every time
[1:16:15] my spirit Bears witness with his spirit
[1:16:17] that I am a child of God
[1:16:21] the Bible says shun every appearance
[1:16:24] it may not be evil but if it looks like
[1:16:27] it's evil come on don't get quiet on me
[1:16:29] Saints if it looks like it's part of the
[1:16:31] devil if it looks like it has nothing to
[1:16:33] do with God and it may not be but the
[1:16:36] fact that it looks like it I shun it
[1:16:39] amen
[1:16:44] son every appearance
[1:16:47] of evil
[1:16:53] and the men
[1:16:55] they heard that
[1:16:58] and they
[1:16:59] assemble themselves
[1:17:01] and they say you know what we're gonna
[1:17:02] go get King David some water
[1:17:06] my King has a desire and I'm here to
[1:17:09] fulfill it
[1:17:11] you're called for that
[1:17:14] that's why I love the Book of Esther
[1:17:16] where mother God was trying to say how
[1:17:18] do you not know that you won't call for
[1:17:21] such a day as this day
[1:17:25] you could have been born any time of
[1:17:26] History
[1:17:27] but this is the time that God has called
[1:17:31] you for how do you not know that you
[1:17:34] won't call for such a time as this
[1:17:41] they're geared up
[1:17:43] they got ready for battle
[1:17:46] because the king
[1:17:48] was thirsty
[1:17:49] [Music]
[1:17:51] God's desires is my command
[1:17:57] his desires are my command
[1:18:04] can't you move forward
[1:18:07] because they had to fight their way
[1:18:09] through a Garrison of Philistines
[1:18:13] and they fought their way through
[1:18:16] and the thing about it is that as they
[1:18:18] were fighting they had to support each
[1:18:21] other
[1:18:22] they had to have had each other's backs
[1:18:26] as they're moving
[1:18:28] fighting off the enemy one scythe
[1:18:30] they got each other's back looking
[1:18:33] constantly in prayer constantly Vigilant
[1:18:36] constantly watching I don't got money I
[1:18:38] could give you but I could pray for you
[1:18:39] I don't always have things I could give
[1:18:41] you but I could pray for you if I can
[1:18:43] then let me grab you financially if I
[1:18:45] could I could do this but I'm always
[1:18:46] gonna have your back I'm always going to
[1:18:48] watch over you
[1:18:50] they're watching each other and they'll
[1:18:52] find their way through
[1:18:54] an oppressing
[1:18:57] constantly pressing
[1:18:59] not letting up in the midst of all the
[1:19:01] chaos
[1:19:02] the swords are clashing the Sparks are
[1:19:05] flying
[1:19:06] and they finally get
[1:19:09] to their destination
[1:19:13] they scooped up a bucket of water
[1:19:20] and then they'd stop and thought
[1:19:22] and like I guess we gotta fight back now
[1:19:25] right
[1:19:30] they fought their way through
[1:19:35] and just when you think you've gotten
[1:19:36] there
[1:19:38] it's like I made it
[1:19:46] gotta go back
[1:19:49] but you know they weren't discouraged
[1:19:54] they weren't disappointed
[1:19:57] they were invigorated
[1:20:00] because that was a destination point
[1:20:03] the Bible says he that has begun a good
[1:20:05] work in me
[1:20:07] will finish it
[1:20:10] if my king wanted something to drink
[1:20:12] then God who saw me through it is
[1:20:15] obliged to take me back to my king
[1:20:22] God who's seen you this far
[1:20:25] you have endured this much
[1:20:28] let me tell you saint
[1:20:30] people don't always know the reason why
[1:20:32] you rejoice
[1:20:34] they don't know what gets you excited
[1:20:38] they don't know what motivates you
[1:20:41] I'll be seeing people at church they're
[1:20:43] so praising God you don't know the
[1:20:46] challenges they have that week
[1:20:48] [Music]
[1:20:49] you don't know the Devils they had to
[1:20:51] fight
[1:20:52] you don't know the circumstances they
[1:20:54] have to face
[1:20:55] even getting here this morning you don't
[1:20:58] know the trials
[1:20:59] the obstacles what the devil put in the
[1:21:02] way and when they break through the
[1:21:04] Garrison of the Philistines and the gig
[1:21:07] here in the morning leave them alone and
[1:21:09] let them praise God
[1:21:12] you don't know what it took
[1:21:15] just to be here this morning
[1:21:18] every blood every sweat every tear every
[1:21:21] Star every wound
[1:21:25] that's why when I see somebody praising
[1:21:27] God I don't know what they went through
[1:21:29] I don't know the challenges when you see
[1:21:33] tears flowing through the eyes you don't
[1:21:34] know what those tears are made of
[1:21:37] but God knows
[1:21:42] these men were so determined
[1:21:45] and this time what made it so unique
[1:21:48] because when they were battling
[1:21:51] their way through they were pressing
[1:21:53] their way through
[1:21:55] now I'm going to say this as delicately
[1:21:57] as possible but they could have fought
[1:21:59] with the degree of carelessness
[1:22:04] not giving any thought to how they're
[1:22:06] swinging their sword
[1:22:09] who they might hit
[1:22:11] [Music]
[1:22:12] they're just fighting
[1:22:14] and that's all right
[1:22:16] but this time they're carrying Precious
[1:22:19] Cargo
[1:22:20] [Music]
[1:22:22] they got to be mindful
[1:22:24] of how they fight
[1:22:26] they got to be thoughtful with how they
[1:22:29] say things how they treat people come on
[1:22:32] somebody
[1:22:33] because this time they're carrying
[1:22:36] something that's needed for the king
[1:22:39] we're on our way back home Saints we can
[1:22:42] act any kind of way we cannot talk any
[1:22:45] kind of way we are carrying something
[1:22:48] that is of value to God
[1:22:52] you can't treat anybody any kind of ways
[1:22:57] [Music]
[1:23:00] this time they're carrying that bucket
[1:23:02] of water
[1:23:03] and they're aligning to each other
[1:23:04] making sure that bucket is protected
[1:23:06] making sure that water sourced that life
[1:23:10] that life has to be guarded on the
[1:23:12] inside
[1:23:14] you gotta constantly be guarding that
[1:23:15] life
[1:23:16] brother man says in that in the in the
[1:23:18] church saying she says and then in that
[1:23:20] unguarded moment
[1:23:22] Satan planted a seed of complete
[1:23:26] ruination
[1:23:27] in that unguarded moment
[1:23:31] don't let
[1:23:32] your Christian walk be unguarded you
[1:23:35] gotta constantly be on guard
[1:23:37] constantly vigilant
[1:23:40] I was telling my home church I used to
[1:23:42] work for the bank
[1:23:45] I used to work for the bank
[1:23:47] and I worked in a vault
[1:23:49] and so the Vault I mean we weren't you
[1:23:53] wouldn't know because it's not like we
[1:23:54] advertise that hey the votes down here
[1:23:56] with the error pointing down so I was
[1:23:58] when I was in Charlotte North Carolina
[1:24:01] and um
[1:24:02] the amount of money that we process was
[1:24:04] in the billions of dollars a year
[1:24:07] and we would process about hundreds of
[1:24:09] millions of dollars not exaggerating
[1:24:11] hundreds of millions of dollars each day
[1:24:13] armor carriers will come by so my site
[1:24:16] was considered a tier two site it was
[1:24:18] one it was a large site so we had tons
[1:24:20] of money cash that we would deal with I
[1:24:23] mean just flows of cash hundreds hundred
[1:24:25] dollar bills fifty dollars five dollar
[1:24:26] bills everything I mean just coins and
[1:24:29] we had you know what we called um it's
[1:24:32] been a while but we had these bins that
[1:24:34] would hold massives amount of cash cash
[1:24:36] and we had five six of them just laying
[1:24:38] around and we had extreme uh protocols
[1:24:42] and so as part of my learning I went to
[1:24:44] visit another tier 2 site just to kind
[1:24:47] of gain some best practices now keep in
[1:24:49] mind
[1:24:50] when you're processing all that cash
[1:24:51] before I started working there if I came
[1:24:55] across five dollar bill
[1:24:57] I I did a backflip
[1:24:59] life was good because I came across if I
[1:25:02] found five dollar bills that I found
[1:25:04] five dollar bills yeah I can't tell me
[1:25:06] if you didn't find five dollar bills you
[1:25:07] wouldn't be excited
[1:25:08] [Music]
[1:25:10] we'd be so excited I'd be thinking well
[1:25:12] I could buy this I could buy I didn't
[1:25:14] have lunch money so you get so excited
[1:25:16] with just one five dollar bill and so
[1:25:18] but I'm I'm right here with just
[1:25:20] millions millions
[1:25:24] and so I went to go visit a site
[1:25:27] and I'm learning things and we have
[1:25:29] security protocols and measures
[1:25:31] and the site leader there was telling me
[1:25:34] Gene you know
[1:25:35] and it just it just it just it just
[1:25:38] it it it hit me home
[1:25:41] he said she says
[1:25:43] because of the amount of cash that we
[1:25:44] process
[1:25:45] we become so numb to it
[1:25:55] it's easy you become so numb to it
[1:26:01] you don't even think that you're
[1:26:03] processing millions of cash
[1:26:08] and here's the thing we have we have
[1:26:10] extreme
[1:26:11] security protocols like we had something
[1:26:13] called a a manhole where you let one
[1:26:16] person in the door and that door closed
[1:26:18] and then you validate who that person is
[1:26:20] and then you open the other door and you
[1:26:21] let that person in there's so many
[1:26:23] security measures
[1:26:26] and she says to me if someone ever goes
[1:26:29] through the pro the trouble of breaking
[1:26:32] into my sight they mean business
[1:26:36] because the way we see money is not the
[1:26:39] way they see money
[1:26:42] and I sat there and I
[1:26:44] and I started thinking all of the
[1:26:46] security measures that I might have been
[1:26:47] casual about
[1:26:50] that I let my guard down
[1:26:52] oh I know this person you never know
[1:26:55] when someone's gonna turn
[1:26:58] you don't know that person's background
[1:27:00] where all of a sudden they decide you
[1:27:02] know what that's a lot of money I'm
[1:27:04] touching
[1:27:07] bills I do this week
[1:27:10] you don't know the conversation that
[1:27:12] they're having in your absence
[1:27:15] that's how the devil's acting don't let
[1:27:18] your security measures go down don't let
[1:27:20] your guard go down the devil's
[1:27:22] constantly watching and waiting for an
[1:27:24] opportunity
[1:27:28] you gotta constantly be vigilant
[1:27:31] don't become casual kiss Christians
[1:27:34] and we weren't thinking much about it
[1:27:37] we're just leaving this so I know so and
[1:27:38] so I know so and so do you
[1:27:44] come on somebody
[1:27:47] I'm just saying we gotta exercise
[1:27:49] discernment and constantly on God
[1:27:53] we can't let those little critters in
[1:27:56] that's the reason why the Bible says I
[1:27:57] you have dominion over the fish of the
[1:28:00] sea the beasts of the the fields the
[1:28:02] Falls of the air and the creeping things
[1:28:05] of the Earth because there are things
[1:28:06] that we've let go in our lives that are
[1:28:08] creeping back into our homes
[1:28:13] because we have become unguarded
[1:28:18] we let the devil put all kinds of images
[1:28:20] in our eyes and we don't care about that
[1:28:22] anymore come on somebody we need to
[1:28:24] repress that Lord I don't want to be
[1:28:26] comfortable in this world I want to be
[1:28:28] transformed
[1:28:33] man I left I came back
[1:28:37] I I tighten up security matchers
[1:28:40] I'm like we're gonna start doing this
[1:28:42] we're going to start it with the law of
[1:28:44] gene laughs
[1:28:46] because I realized that I gotta get back
[1:28:48] to my wife
[1:28:50] my family is dependent on me to get back
[1:28:53] home
[1:28:54] and I can't just be casual about things
[1:28:57] at work
[1:28:59] because some because of devil out there
[1:29:01] he he means business
[1:29:06] because while I saw just nothing but
[1:29:08] paper and transaction
[1:29:10] and have forgotten the value of what I
[1:29:12] was dealing with
[1:29:13] [Music]
[1:29:15] to the person on the outside
[1:29:17] that is extremely valuable
[1:29:20] and they are willing to take anybody out
[1:29:23] that's in the way
[1:29:25] the devil's willing to take you out
[1:29:28] the moment you let your guard down
[1:29:30] that's why I said Lord fortify me by
[1:29:32] your Holy Spirit protect me by your word
[1:29:35] be a shield and buckle unto me and my
[1:29:37] family
[1:29:43] press towards the mark
[1:29:45] of the prize of the High Calling
[1:29:50] I rounded up by saying
[1:29:52] there's a story in the scripture
[1:29:57] in Exodus I love this scripture
[1:30:00] just to kind of set the stage for us
[1:30:04] it's in Exodus chapter um
[1:30:07] 14 will read there
[1:30:09] but just to set the stage
[1:30:12] the children of Israel
[1:30:16] um were
[1:30:18] um about to where had left had just left
[1:30:21] Egypt
[1:30:25] and pharaoh
[1:30:26] kinda
[1:30:28] reflecting about how things didn't go
[1:30:30] according to how he had desired it
[1:30:33] and he started to feel the pressure of
[1:30:36] the people
[1:30:38] pharaoh
[1:30:39] what do you expect us to do now
[1:30:41] you're the laughing stock
[1:30:43] of this entire community
[1:30:46] you've let the people go
[1:30:48] how are we supposed to build this and
[1:30:50] build that and build this
[1:30:52] Pharaoh was beginning to feel the
[1:30:54] pressures
[1:30:57] he got up in the morning and he looked
[1:30:59] at the Egyptian times
[1:31:01] feral a big loss by letting the people
[1:31:04] of Israel go
[1:31:07] front page
[1:31:09] he was so disappointed
[1:31:12] his pride started to get in the way
[1:31:15] how could you let them people go
[1:31:19] there were people marching around his
[1:31:20] palaces
[1:31:22] he started feeling the political
[1:31:24] pressures
[1:31:26] the infighting
[1:31:30] how
[1:31:32] and meanwhile the children of Israel
[1:31:34] they're rejoicing
[1:31:36] praising God
[1:31:38] that they have left bondage they're no
[1:31:41] longer under the hands of the Egyptian
[1:31:45] and they're looking forward in the
[1:31:46] praising God and say hallelujah they're
[1:31:48] having a jubilee life is good
[1:31:52] they've never been so happy Redemption
[1:31:55] what the prophet Moses said is true and
[1:31:57] meanwhile Pharaoh's fighting with people
[1:31:58] like didn't you just see what happened
[1:32:00] in the last play
[1:32:01] we've lost children
[1:32:06] their God is far greater than our God
[1:32:09] Raw
[1:32:11] and people like we don't care
[1:32:13] you're laughing stuck
[1:32:16] so
[1:32:18] Pharaoh's heart hardens
[1:32:22] now I want you to pay attention to this
[1:32:24] and I want you to follow very carefully
[1:32:25] with me
[1:32:26] this is at that time one of the most
[1:32:29] powerful Nation
[1:32:32] in the world
[1:32:34] unrivaled
[1:32:36] By Any Other Nation
[1:32:38] no one
[1:32:40] can meet the military might
[1:32:42] of the Egyptians
[1:32:44] they were powerful
[1:32:46] fighting machine
[1:32:49] an army
[1:32:51] to be reckoned with
[1:32:53] powerful
[1:32:56] and Pharaoh got a
[1:32:58] hundreds not thousands chariots
[1:33:03] one of the most powerful military
[1:33:06] machines at that time
[1:33:09] powerful
[1:33:12] to go after who
[1:33:14] a people
[1:33:15] that didn't have a military
[1:33:19] a people
[1:33:21] that hardly had any weapons
[1:33:24] of people that were on foot to a
[1:33:27] Promised Land
[1:33:30] and Pharaoh felt he needed to equip
[1:33:33] himself so much
[1:33:35] to go after people
[1:33:37] that was not equipped as well as he was
[1:33:41] right what's our lesson about this the
[1:33:43] devil's afraid of you Saints
[1:33:47] the devil will gather all of his
[1:33:49] military might because he knows not of
[1:33:51] you but the God who stands for you
[1:33:57] in order to confront you he has to bring
[1:34:00] his best
[1:34:03] to fight your best
[1:34:08] because the devil knows that without God
[1:34:10] you're not anything
[1:34:12] but with God you're everything
[1:34:15] so he may not be afraid of you but he's
[1:34:17] afraid of what represents you
[1:34:23] my little daughter
[1:34:25] you know I could draw a lot of analogies
[1:34:27] being a father now
[1:34:29] I got a 190 pound Rottweiler at home
[1:34:32] pretty big thing
[1:34:34] my little daughter just as small as she
[1:34:35] want to be
[1:34:37] goes up to my Rottweiler and looks at
[1:34:38] her looks at my dog and says sit down
[1:34:42] my dog looked at me just as confused as
[1:34:44] like wish this little human trying to
[1:34:45] tell me
[1:34:46] she's like sit down
[1:34:49] dog looks at her
[1:34:51] the dog looks at me
[1:34:54] and as she's getting ready to say one
[1:34:55] more time sit down I just say sit
[1:34:58] and the dog sat
[1:35:00] she was so rejoicing
[1:35:04] she was happy
[1:35:06] because she said sit down
[1:35:10] listen
[1:35:12] let me tell you Saints speak the words
[1:35:15] and let God speak on your behalf
[1:35:18] and God will let you take the credit for
[1:35:21] it
[1:35:23] my child speak you listen
[1:35:26] [Music]
[1:35:27] she may not have the might she may not
[1:35:29] have the strength she may not have to
[1:35:31] physique but I stand behind her
[1:35:35] she speak you're obligated to listen
[1:35:38] [Applause]
[1:35:40] so exercise your voice and speak to the
[1:35:43] devil devil you don't belong in my house
[1:35:47] devil get out of my house
[1:35:49] get your hands off of my children get
[1:35:52] your hands off of my marriage get your
[1:35:54] hands off my job
[1:35:56] [Applause]
[1:36:01] and let God speak on your behalf
[1:36:09] so they started to pursue
[1:36:13] the Egyptians started to pursue after
[1:36:15] the children of Israel
[1:36:17] and they were you know
[1:36:19] that's the thing man the devil just have
[1:36:21] ways of kind of breaking or interrupting
[1:36:23] your glory you're either praising God
[1:36:27] and literas like Hallelujah
[1:36:29] they saw a host of people
[1:36:35] all of a sudden that Joy
[1:36:37] started to decipitate a little bit
[1:36:40] sorry to drop down a little bit
[1:36:43] you know that's just like the devil
[1:36:45] when you leave him alone
[1:36:47] he's not happy he comes after you
[1:36:50] he comes after you
[1:36:53] the world is constantly Chasing After
[1:36:55] You because they want you back
[1:36:58] it's not happy that you left it
[1:37:02] and so as they're watching the Egyptian
[1:37:04] come from behind they're like we ain't
[1:37:06] worried about it we're just gonna keep
[1:37:08] going straight and as they got far
[1:37:10] farther to the destination that
[1:37:12] destination they come across a massive
[1:37:15] Red Sea
[1:37:18] that could kill anybody's Joy
[1:37:21] the enemy at your tail
[1:37:24] and then you have no further way to go
[1:37:27] what do you do
[1:37:30] they start to cry
[1:37:32] that's when we pick up the Bible says
[1:37:35] is not this the word that we did tell
[1:37:38] thee in Egypt saying verse Chapter 14
[1:37:40] verse 12. and he just said let us alone
[1:37:43] that we may serve the Egyptians for it
[1:37:45] had been better for us to serve the
[1:37:47] Egyptian then that we should die in the
[1:37:50] wilderness
[1:37:53] that's how the devil is
[1:37:56] you've seen the Miracles I mean they had
[1:37:58] just witnessed the Miracles that God had
[1:38:00] did for them while they were in Egypt
[1:38:03] and all of a sudden because of this
[1:38:05] circumstance
[1:38:07] the enemies at their back
[1:38:09] the Red Seas right there
[1:38:12] so they're stuck in the middle
[1:38:17] you know what the devil's attempt is
[1:38:18] sometimes
[1:38:19] is to stop you from pressing forward
[1:38:24] to stop you from moving
[1:38:28] to have you believe that there's no way
[1:38:31] out
[1:38:33] because by their definition and by their
[1:38:36] standards and by the way they were
[1:38:37] looking at situations they didn't see a
[1:38:40] way out
[1:38:42] that's many of us if not all of us
[1:38:44] we have come across certain situations
[1:38:46] in our lives like Lord how am I going to
[1:38:48] get out of this mess
[1:38:52] situations at the job I don't know how
[1:38:54] I'm gonna get out of it
[1:38:56] family situations I I don't know what
[1:38:58] I'm gonna do
[1:38:59] now oftentimes we say it doesn't seem
[1:39:01] like there's a way out
[1:39:03] that's what the devil wants you to think
[1:39:07] so Moses
[1:39:09] he goes to God and he begins to cry out
[1:39:11] onto God
[1:39:12] Moses done to the people fear ye not
[1:39:16] stand still and see the salvation of the
[1:39:20] Lord
[1:39:21] that was Moses message to the people
[1:39:23] stand still
[1:39:26] and see how God comes through for you
[1:39:33] and the Lord said unto Moses why cry
[1:39:37] unto me
[1:39:41] speak
[1:39:43] unto the children of Israel
[1:39:47] that they may go together
[1:39:51] forward
[1:39:58] that
[1:40:00] they may go forward
[1:40:07] God you see that Red Sea go forward
[1:40:12] God you see that the bills are due move
[1:40:14] forward
[1:40:16] God I just got laid off my job go
[1:40:19] forward
[1:40:21] I just had a falling out where my
[1:40:23] relative moved forward
[1:40:27] the note is through the car notice dude
[1:40:30] the mortgages to move forward
[1:40:35] God sees the same challenges that you
[1:40:37] see
[1:40:39] but what you don't see is that God has
[1:40:41] provided a way out
[1:40:45] he would not tell you to go someplace
[1:40:48] unless he hasn't gone there himself
[1:40:54] go forward
[1:41:01] lift up thyroid
[1:41:04] stretch out thy hand over the sea and
[1:41:07] divide it
[1:41:09] in the children of Israel shall go on
[1:41:10] dry ground through the midst of the sea
[1:41:14] and I will harden the hearts of the
[1:41:16] Egyptians and they will follow
[1:41:20] them
[1:41:21] and I will get the honor
[1:41:24] upon pharaoh
[1:41:26] God says go forward but as they're
[1:41:29] pressing forward I'm gonna magnify I'm
[1:41:31] gonna intensify the situation for them
[1:41:35] I'm gonna put the Pharaoh I'm gonna put
[1:41:37] pharah's Army right there on the heels
[1:41:41] God intensifies the situation
[1:41:44] come on
[1:41:47] God has confidence in you
[1:41:51] God believes in you more than you
[1:41:53] probably believe in your own self
[1:41:56] he has confidence in you
[1:42:00] that's the reason why
[1:42:02] when the Bible says in in in job where
[1:42:05] God looks at saying it's like you know
[1:42:07] Satan was going to and for he's like
[1:42:08] have you concerned my servant joke
[1:42:14] I didn't know
[1:42:16] you got a hedge of protection running by
[1:42:18] them
[1:42:19] you know
[1:42:22] but then he says if you remove the hedge
[1:42:25] of protection
[1:42:26] I'll get him to curse you to your face
[1:42:30] God believes in his servant God has
[1:42:33] confidence in you
[1:42:34] the devil the God says to the devil I
[1:42:37] will remove the heads of protection you
[1:42:39] could make him sick you could touch your
[1:42:41] surrounding but the only thing that I
[1:42:43] tell you don't touch that life
[1:42:49] he will never denounce me
[1:42:52] come on somebody
[1:42:54] it's easy while we're sitting amongst
[1:42:56] Believers to say praise be to God
[1:43:00] but when you're out there under the
[1:43:02] pressures of the world
[1:43:04] and we're living in that time now
[1:43:08] where would you believe is becoming
[1:43:10] magnified
[1:43:17] there are things that I just don't agree
[1:43:19] with
[1:43:22] and I know within my job I could only go
[1:43:24] but a certain level
[1:43:27] right
[1:43:28] because there's certain things I just
[1:43:30] don't agree with
[1:43:36] faith is going to be challenged
[1:43:39] and let me tell you things it's gonna
[1:43:40] get worse
[1:43:46] praise the Lord
[1:43:49] go forward
[1:43:54] and the Egyptians were as high Pursuit
[1:43:58] and as they were closing in
[1:44:02] the Bible says
[1:44:04] verse 19 the angel of God
[1:44:08] which went before the camp of Israel
[1:44:12] removed and went behind them
[1:44:16] and the pillar of cloud went before
[1:44:18] their face that went before their face
[1:44:21] and when it stood behind them
[1:44:26] and it came between the camp of the
[1:44:29] Egyptians
[1:44:31] and the camp of Israel
[1:44:34] and there was a cloud and darkness to
[1:44:36] them but it gave light by night to these
[1:44:39] so that one came not the other all the
[1:44:43] night
[1:44:45] so God was leading the charge
[1:44:50] and when he saw that the people
[1:44:53] started to waver
[1:44:55] he says look I know what promises lays
[1:44:59] ahead
[1:45:00] you move forward
[1:45:03] but I will go and stand behind you
[1:45:07] what does that mean God has your back
[1:45:12] God has your back
[1:45:14] you don't need to look at your past you
[1:45:16] move forward
[1:45:19] you don't need to give the devil credit
[1:45:20] to your past you move forward
[1:45:25] and God stood between the children of
[1:45:27] Israel and the Egyptians
[1:45:31] you could sleep at night
[1:45:34] knowing that God stand between you and
[1:45:36] your enemy
[1:45:39] and he told the truth the truth is real
[1:45:46] don't look behind you
[1:45:48] no matter how treacherous the journey
[1:45:50] might be
[1:45:52] how challenging
[1:45:54] the journey might be press forward
[1:45:59] it's a long story but we're just kind of
[1:46:01] shortening it
[1:46:02] they get to the Red Sea
[1:46:06] Moses extends his arms because they
[1:46:08] don't know what's going to happen but
[1:46:09] they got to move by faith
[1:46:11] you don't know how you're going to get
[1:46:12] through certain situations you got to
[1:46:14] move by faith you don't even know what
[1:46:16] tomorrow looks like you gotta approach
[1:46:18] tomorrow like Faith tell you why because
[1:46:19] tomorrow's going to come anyhow
[1:46:23] there's no stopping tomorrow there will
[1:46:24] be a tomorrow
[1:46:25] unless we're in glory
[1:46:27] that's even better
[1:46:29] but as long as there is tomorrow I'm
[1:46:31] approaching it with faith
[1:46:33] I'm not certain in a lot of things but
[1:46:36] the Bible says be certain of God
[1:46:38] I'm certain in my Creator I'm certain of
[1:46:41] my deliverer I don't know what Tuesday
[1:46:43] looks like but I look forward to Tuesday
[1:46:47] pressing towards the mark
[1:46:51] and as it got to the Red Sea
[1:46:54] Moses spread out his arms
[1:46:58] in a wall of water comes between them
[1:47:01] separates
[1:47:03] and I don't know
[1:47:05] either just dry ground appears
[1:47:08] two million people
[1:47:11] marches through
[1:47:14] this Red Sea
[1:47:18] they're walking through what wasn't
[1:47:20] there
[1:47:22] their problem is no longer a problem
[1:47:27] what they were worried about is no
[1:47:29] longer a worry
[1:47:31] anytime the devil could get you to stop
[1:47:33] worshiping God we come to church so
[1:47:36] bogged down with our problems rather
[1:47:37] than give God the glory we're thinking
[1:47:39] about what we're going to do when we get
[1:47:40] home how are we going to take care of
[1:47:42] this what this week looks like what kind
[1:47:44] of conversation I'm going to have with
[1:47:45] my boss the doctor's visit we're so
[1:47:48] bogged down that when the when the
[1:47:49] preacher starts to say something we like
[1:47:51] praise the Lord
[1:47:53] rather than giving God the glory right
[1:47:55] now
[1:47:57] thank God for what he's already done he
[1:47:59] may not have done it yet but just
[1:48:00] thinking Lord thank you for taking care
[1:48:02] of this problem Lord I don't know how
[1:48:04] I'm gonna get through this but thank you
[1:48:06] for making me get through it
[1:48:08] having confidence start rejoicing now
[1:48:10] even as you're waiting for the promise
[1:48:12] to materialize
[1:48:18] he'll never leave you know forsake you
[1:48:21] press forward
[1:48:25] and Moses stood in position
[1:48:30] until every elect
[1:48:33] every elect
[1:48:36] every elect
[1:48:38] every elect
[1:48:41] passes through
[1:48:43] Jesus is holding position
[1:48:46] he died on the cross
[1:48:49] that blood is still bleeding for you and
[1:48:51] I
[1:48:52] before my children was born that blood
[1:48:54] was bleeding for them he's waiting for
[1:48:57] every elect to make it through all that
[1:49:00] the father has given me will come to me
[1:49:05] boy
[1:49:07] you might be looking at your brother and
[1:49:09] your sisters to get your life together
[1:49:10] and God's looking directly at you and
[1:49:12] saying get your life together
[1:49:17] because he says he's not Gonna Leave You
[1:49:23] so if I'm enduring it could be because
[1:49:25] I'm waiting for someone to get their
[1:49:27] lives together
[1:49:28] if you're enduring it could be that
[1:49:29] you're waiting for somebody to get their
[1:49:30] life together oh God's waiting for you
[1:49:32] to get your life together God's waiting
[1:49:34] for me to get my life together
[1:49:38] foreign
[1:49:39] Moses stood there
[1:49:41] and God was there watching every elect
[1:49:44] every promise
[1:49:46] Young
[1:49:48] old
[1:49:49] you name it
[1:49:52] went through
[1:49:57] so I'm wrapping up
[1:50:01] your way
[1:50:02] is only for you
[1:50:06] the devil cannot go the same path that
[1:50:08] you win
[1:50:11] your way is only yours
[1:50:14] when you're sealed in
[1:50:17] the only way that the devil can get to
[1:50:20] you
[1:50:21] is if you decide to step outside of that
[1:50:24] seal
[1:50:26] and then you're in trouble
[1:50:28] or if the devil decides to go through
[1:50:31] the same process that you went
[1:50:33] repent be baptized filled with the Holy
[1:50:36] Ghost at that time the prophet said you
[1:50:38] could call him brother
[1:50:43] but your path is your path
[1:50:48] the Egyptians were so bold
[1:50:50] they're like if it's good for the
[1:50:52] children of Israel then it's good for us
[1:50:55] to
[1:50:55] sound of the fellas we're going right to
[1:50:57] them
[1:50:59] with all their technology
[1:51:01] all their advances all their
[1:51:04] accomplishments they started to pursue
[1:51:07] after the children of Israel
[1:51:09] by that time they were already on the
[1:51:11] other side
[1:51:14] and God told Moses Moses
[1:51:17] close up your hands
[1:51:20] can you just imagine
[1:51:22] a wall of water
[1:51:25] Moses closed his hands
[1:51:30] a wall of water comes
[1:51:36] that force of that water
[1:51:39] crushing the Egyptians in
[1:51:42] breaking down all of their chariots
[1:51:47] drowning all of those spirits
[1:51:50] destroying all of the devils
[1:51:54] when you cross through that blood
[1:51:57] and you look behind you you can see the
[1:52:00] Carnage that God has taken care of for
[1:52:02] you
[1:52:03] every devil that was in your Hot Pursuit
[1:52:05] God's taking care of that
[1:52:09] destroyed every demon
[1:52:12] drowned every spirit
[1:52:16] that was so mighty
[1:52:18] but before God there were nothing
[1:52:25] the children of Israel
[1:52:28] now we're looking towards the promise
[1:52:34] God had taken care of the past
[1:52:37] now I want you to follow this because I
[1:52:39] heard a brother say this and I thought
[1:52:40] it was meaningful to me
[1:52:44] if the children of Israel wanted to go
[1:52:46] back
[1:52:47] they could not
[1:52:49] [Music]
[1:52:51] this was only a one-way path
[1:52:58] then when you want to go back
[1:53:00] give up
[1:53:01] I want to quit sometimes I want to stop
[1:53:04] sometimes I just want to just throw in
[1:53:07] the towel I can't
[1:53:10] God has taken away that way back I can
[1:53:12] only go forward
[1:53:14] even if you wanted to go back you cannot
[1:53:18] God has called you to go forward and
[1:53:22] like Paul I can say I press towards the
[1:53:24] mark of the prize of the High Calling a
[1:53:27] Christ Jesus so I'll Stand to our feet
[1:53:33] hello
[1:53:37] God has paved the way for you
[1:53:41] and it's only yours
[1:53:44] there's no way back
[1:53:52] you know what saint
[1:53:54] I don't know about y'all but I'm tired
[1:53:55] of this world
[1:54:00] I'm longing for a city
[1:54:03] with maker and Builder Builders God
[1:54:08] there's a land beyond the river
[1:54:12] that is called
[1:54:13] the sweet
[1:54:18] you know one of the most troubling
[1:54:20] sounds I hear at night
[1:54:24] when I look I put my kids to sleep
[1:54:28] soundly asleep
[1:54:31] my wife's comfortable
[1:54:33] I kind of walk around the house
[1:54:36] and in that same distance
[1:54:39] I hear the sound of a siren
[1:54:42] that troubles
[1:54:44] well I'm so appreciative that God has
[1:54:46] kept my household at peace
[1:54:48] someone's home is being disturbed
[1:54:53] now it's on the home church back up the
[1:54:55] other son that said you know
[1:54:57] I long for the day where certain sounds
[1:54:59] just doesn't exist
[1:55:02] that I no longer hear the sound of a
[1:55:04] sign
[1:55:07] I no longer have to live by putting
[1:55:08] security alarms in my home
[1:55:11] along for that day
[1:55:14] along for the day
[1:55:16] where certain occupations don't exist
[1:55:18] anymore
[1:55:20] I don't need a surgeon
[1:55:23] I don't need a doctor
[1:55:26] I long for a Day Saints
[1:55:28] but certain products don't exist anymore
[1:55:31] I don't need medicine
[1:55:34] I don't need pills
[1:55:36] I don't need this injection
[1:55:39] I long for the day
[1:55:43] with certain unfortunate events happened
[1:55:47] along for that day
[1:55:49] I belonging for a land
[1:55:52] that is sweeter than fair
[1:55:55] there's a land beyond the river
[1:55:58] that is called the sweet forever
[1:56:02] for some of you it might be imaginary
[1:56:04] for me it's everything that I'm fighting
[1:56:07] for
[1:56:09] every wound that I have every scar that
[1:56:12] I bear is to ascertain that promise it's
[1:56:16] to apprehend
[1:56:19] apprehend that price
[1:56:24] if God doesn't come by the end of 2023 I
[1:56:27] look for him in 2024.
[1:56:29] because I'm going to press towards that
[1:56:31] Mark
[1:56:33] I've come too far
[1:56:36] I've endured too much
[1:56:39] I've sacrificed so much
[1:56:42] for me to believe that this is just
[1:56:44] nothing but a lie
[1:56:46] my soul rests upon that word of Truth
[1:56:51] your soul rests upon that
[1:56:55] my faith

[1:57:09] Heavenly Father

[1:57:14] opportunity that you've given unto us
[1:57:17] to break bread with the Saints and
[1:57:19] what's Palm Beach
[1:57:22] father I came down the Lord not knowing
[1:57:24] what really I should be preaching about
[1:57:26] but seeking your leadership
[1:57:29] and father with that I yielded myself
[1:57:31] over to you
[1:57:33] trusting that something was said that
[1:57:35] was of encouragement to your people
[1:57:38] something that they could grab a hold of
[1:57:41] and father as we see that we're living
[1:57:43] in the final hours that God

[1:57:54] right what is wrong to God bring to the

[1:57:59] that we need to sort out in our lives
[1:58:01] and help us continue to press towards
[1:58:04] the mark
[1:58:05] press towards the mark
[1:58:08] father for we believe that the reward
[1:58:11] far outweighs the sacrifice
