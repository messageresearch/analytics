when brother Jack preaches he preached last year the the you have the incredible and when the people began to believe that God began to show the incredible amen so if he's preaching the word of Almighty God to you he's preaching the Holy Ghost and you see the Holy Ghost coming falling in our midst just believe that word and take it is for you Amen God comes and proves his word but Satan will

endureth forever let them now that fear the Lord see that his mercy endureth forever call upon the Lord in distress the Lord answered me and sent me in a large place the Lord is on my side I will not fear what man can do unto me the Lord taketh my part with them that help me therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes all the nations can pass me about but in the name of the Lord will I destroy them my lord like she said that's right in the center of the

wish you a Happy New Year a man so good to be in 2020 closer to the coming of the Lord super closer today than we were yesterday amen we are certainly on the expectation for what the Lord has for us just real quickly just we're gonna get our Bibles and we're gonna prepare for the word of the Lord today it was a song that I was asked to sing and I'll do that at the end of the sermon amen this morning but I forgot to mention to the church I we have the the church app and on the church app last year took some time to build another Bible plan and within this Bible plan is one that we use a couple of years ago me and some other Saints and and and it allowed me just as we read I would make comments about you know just some of the things that I might have read about and this stuff just like a little devotional that you can just kind of look at and maybe just even you know come up with some of your own thoughts but something just kind of make you think about what you're reading and so I put that together and put it on the on our on our on our church app and we started a plan at the beginning of the year so those of you that would like to join us a man for one year bible reading plan right there in the church at the very first button there's a Bible reading plan and we're using the one called the one year bible there's multiple plans very plans there but you'll see the one that says one year Bible and that's the one that we're using for this year and I trust that you all would join us on the journey amen is you'd a little statement out there on my Instagram account and I think must have had about ten people from all over the world so you know what I want to join you on the journey reading through the Bible this year so very happy a man to have people join us on a journey and if you've never read your Bible through the year once this would be a good year a man to start so I know it's a few days and it might be a little bit behind but that's okay god I give you some time in your schedule you'll be able to catch up a man glory to God but we want to encourage everybody if you can just just get in the church after if you don't have anyone access to the app just send me a text is something I'll give you an instructions on how to get there amen so I want to read from two passages of Scripture and actually as we read for those that a man like to kind of try to figure out the scriptures and everything and what how to connect I'm not sure it's in the it's in the word summary and and I'm just letting the Lord just kind of take us this morning a man this first Sunday of 2020 a man thank God I was saw somebody put a little post out there we're gonna Habakkuk chapter 2 and man Habakkuk chapter 2 but I saw somebody put out a poster on mention it to you all when you're doing in a legal document make sure when you're dating the document that you put the full year on it don't just do like one five twenty because somebody could come behind you and put a 17 or 18 and a 19 or whatever and now you in trouble so just make sure you do one five twenty twenty right when you're doing legal documents and things like that so just it may be be careful this year all right here in the back of two and then we'll read also from John 11 and a little bit a man back to States I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what I shall answer when I am reproved and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon the tables that he may run that read assent for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it tarries wait for it glory to God because it will surely come it will not tarry a man verse 4 says behold his soul which is lifted up it's not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith a man let's turn over to John chapter 11 I saw Ruth back there so good to see Ruth in the house of the Lord on today in man praise the Lord a man John chapter 11 and I'll just start reading a man at verse 33 praise the Lord and though we got the Bible on our apps and I mean on our phones the Bible apps and things like that on a phone is so easy just to you know punch it in with your little your thumb a couple fingers but I do love to hear when the the page is turned can you add kind of like make like the pages of turning or something see if they can get something like that but I do love to hear the pages turn a man praise the Lord John 11 verse 33 it says when Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was trouble and said where have you laid him then said they then Lord come and see Jesus who had been a man they said then said the Jews behold how he loved him and come and some of them said could not this man which open the eyes of the blind have calls that even this man should not have died I mean could not this man do something about it pretty much Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it man and you know as I was reading this and the Jesus groaning in himself I wonder if Jesus is also seeing a stone upon a cave that he would be in but it would be removed one day hallelujah hey man listen says verse 39 says jesus said take away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto Him Lord by this time he stinketh for he has been dead for days jesus saith unto her said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou should have see the glory of God then they took away the stone from the place where the Dead was laid in Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I think thee that thou has heard me glory to God hey man brother branham say this was just a routine because Jesus already knew what was getting ready to happen so he just kind of went through a routine prayer hallelujah amen so he says father I thank thee that thou has hurt me and I knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by I said it Amen that they may believe that thou hath sent me alright and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with great clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin jesus said to him loose him and let him go then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did believed on him a man but some of them went their ways to the Pharisees and told them what things Jesus had done the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow in a brief word of Prayer God we thank you for the word that we have read here today we've know it's gonna take the Holy Spirit to make clarity and bring clarity on the things that we've read and we just pray that you take control of this thought that you want to present to your people thank you for the anointing that has been this place thank you for the specials that have gone forth thank you for the worship service thank you God a man for this first Sunday of the year and God as we enter and we pray that you would encourage us inspire some strengthen us for through your word correct us whatever we need done this morning may you do it father us in Jesus name we pray amen and amen god bless you you can be seated amen we want to just speak on the subject today catch the vision then step into the vision they man they man catch the vision then step into the vision a man just a quick quote here from the message countdown say man I want to read the Prophet makes this statement I said seven is God's perfect number and now he has given us the correct countdown and his countdown is not ten but seven a man says we've just been through it in the seven churches now we find out over in Revelations the first countdown was the first age the second countdown the second age and on the seventh countdown and here visible before us as the pictures drawn is referring to this chart of the church sages here amen it says as a picture is drawn that we have this countdown the first first number County was Ephesus the second number County was Smyrna smarter then Pergamos Thyatira fifth was Sardis sixth was Philadelphia and the seventh was Laodicea the last church each a man which is where we're living at right now a man we're living in the end of the end of the church age right he says says the myiasis and the seventh which was later see in the last church age then it's the zero time I like that then it's the zero time a man for the church to leave a man so this morning I'm trying to get to the church if we're at zero time we need to catch the vision and then step into the vision hallelujah church he may listen it says then it's the zero time 2020 zero time for the church to leave after the church ages have served their tongue hallelujah well why these years we are going into a rapture what what can we claim in there I pray the same prayer that child paid in the end of the Bible even so come Lord Jesus I don't know if we can handle much more of this so why not this year here let's catch the vision and then step into the vision a man he says he says then it's the thinnest the seal time for the church to leave after the church agents have served their term now we know that type of Thyatira age has come and gone and the fever's age has come and gone then the Philadelphia age that's come in gold and we are in the seven churches at the end of it the legacy in age and that is the countdown all glory to God I thank God for that and I'm on the expectation amen for this year we know we don't have much longer church and if there's ever time to get desperate that time is right now a man if there's every time to be on fire for God that time is right now hey man we don't have time - amen you know when there's astronauts astronauts we'll get ready to see that countdown and at ten and nine eight seven six five four three two one and out now that the Space Shuttle whatever it is it don't take off at one they have to hit zero right and when they hit zero then the thing lifts off now now when it's at the countdown you can't be putting your spacesuit on you understand a man you can't be somewhere trying to get prepared when they hit ten nine eight seven you have to already be prepared you got to be inside the shuttle locked and ready to go in churches there's ever time for the bride to be locked and ready to go that time is now amen if we have to throw some things for the world putting things off be locked and ready to go hey man glory to God so we might as well catch the vision and then step into it hallelujah all right let me uh let me just read a couple things here and then we want to go into this thought a man today and I wanted to maybe catch a statement here from the voice of God in his last days now brother Branham was referring to the scripture in first Samuel of the the chapter 3 verse 1 where it spoke the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli and the word of the Lord was precious in those days there was no open vision there was no open vision and it makes a statement in that and he says he says see what is a vision then just one second on that quote since what is a vision then it's the direct word of the Lord and the Lord's word was precious right so what's the vision so it when it was no open vision he says what is a vision it's a direct word of the Lord it's the direct word of the Lord that's the vision a man it says and that was precious the direct word of the Lord has gotta be precious this Bible has got to become precious to us amen this bought what God is writing in his word has got to become precious what God revealed through his prophet has got to become precious all come on church hey man we we got it we got we got we got to spend some time with the Lord this year all right put it up put it in your schedule I'm gonna spend time with the Lord this year hallelujah amen there's a lot of too many other things that have become precious to us new year has become precious a man Kurt Weill has become precious Walmart has become precious but the Bible Amen must become precious not in God's right in our sight it's got to become precious a man a vision is the direct water the Lord and the Lord work the Lord's word was precious the Lord's word was precious search is precious hey man we got anything we can do to make sure that we are we include God we need to do that this year all right hearing this message the voice of God in the last days says oh that would be enough text that we could speak here speak on here for a month he says and we could draw from we can draw much text from this glorious text he's talking about First Samuel chapter 3 verse 1 he says but this morning we just have about twenty minutes to get out in proper time I guess Sunday school is over over maybe it follows this I don't know but however I want I want to use the text of voice of God in the last days since it's a very outstanding time we realize that where we're speaking from in the scriptures that it said there was no open vision in the days of Samuel say therefore when there where there's no vision the Bible said the people perish we must have a vision and a vision comes to the prophets and it's the word of the Lord spoken to them I hope you stay with me this morning church glory to God amen the vision comes to the prophets and instable Lord spoken to them all right he goes over a little further he says and we find out that Eli was not a prophet he was a priest and he was getting old eyes were going Tim and he could not seem to get around was a great heavy man he had began to let the work of the Lord go undone hey man we don't want to be caught doing that in this hour so that's something like it is today I think the church the organization and denominations they've been on the field for a long time and they're beginning getting lakhs and the work of the Lord is being left undone hallelujah the word of truth because the church in itself has become dim-sighted the church in itself has become damned sight it's a mess so the church can see some things but not all things hallelujah amen we don't want to be that way and we're going to talk about this a little bit you know we want to have what's perceived as perfect vision what's perceived that's perfect vision let's go a little further hallelujah glory he said sup the church him to come dim-sighted and we need today the voice of God to speak among us bring us back and see Eli laid down his eyesight was failing he was a priest and they had no open vision from the Lord and that great need he goes on a little further now let me just just stay with me on this one says that God has promised to meet the need of the hour he always does that and we need the voice of God today to meet the need of the hour to meet the time that we're living in and after he has promised it we can rest assured that he will keep his promise that's the confidence that the believer has in his maker that he promised to meet the need and today one reason that the church is in the condition that it's in is because there are so many voices so many so many other voices to attract the church from the voice of God II till it's very doubtful that many would hear the voice of God though it spoke right in their myths they perhaps women wouldn't even understand it because it would be a foreign thing to them they've gotten themselves so much centered on the forces of the day and church I want us to be very very careful that that we don't get out get ourselves centered on all the other voices we want to be wrapped up and tied up in the voice of God what he's saying to us through his word through His Prophet that brought the revealed word we want to understand those things in this hour it's zero time it's zero time now I said what's perceived as perfect vision who was perceived as perfect vision amen and so you know when people have 20/20 vision amen it's perceived as perfect vision amen hallelujah and I want to say perceived because 20/20 vision is really not perfect vision a man 2020 vision is normal vision a man it's ordinary vision when you got 20/20 vision just simply means you don't need any extra help to see 20 feet in front of you hallelujah when they put the chart there amen all you're doing is looking at 20 feet in front of you amen in the average person amen the average person can see 20/20 hallelujah but when you're struggling sometime your vision you can't see 20 feet in front of you hallelujah amen it might take you might need a little extra something to help you see to win its winning glory to God somebody a man let me just really just a little bit here it's perceived as a man perfect vision glory to God watch this now I was just looking at a few things on the Internet it says visual acuity of 20/20 is considered perfect vision because no aids are required to see better right since what people can have better than 20/20 vision right they say many young people are able to see let a smaller than the general 20 20 20 20 shots even people who know that they see 20/20 or better but feel that other aspects of their vision are lacking have options for improvement I like this now because you can have 20/20 vision and still be lacking in some areas Oh glory to God now what are they talking about here what are we lacking in another another little website I was looking at says having 20/20 vision does not necessarily mean you have perfect vision right 20/20 vision only indicates the sharpness or clarity of vision at a distance other important vision skills include peripheral peripheral awareness so not just what you can see straight on you better be able to look at on this side to see how the devil might be getting you come on in 2020 that ball might be trying to catch you in a blind spot so you have vision as well somebody it's not watch night man look at this say say it only indicates 20/20 vision only indicates the sharpness or clarity of vision at a distance other important vision skills including peripheral awareness or SAR vision amen a coordination glory to God that's another thing here a man with with vision that's very important you got to have good hand and eye coordination glory to God say y'all also got to have depth perception I like that Amen if you don't have good hand-eye coordination if I picked up a manner picked up this bottle and I just threw it out at you you didn't have good hand-eye coordination your hand will not lift up to block what was coming towards your hands come on some honey a man it's gonna take a look at more than just 20/20 I know we're excited about being here but it's gonna take a little bit more than just winter 20 a man to be ready for zero time it's gonna take more glory to God coordination you won't be able to protect yourself the devil throw anything at you you won't be able to protect yourself you gotta have good perception it's when you're driving in the car when you get ready to leave the plaza today amen they don't have a light out there for you to turn left or right on but you gotta have good depth perception how far back is that calm before I turn out there in this traffic glory to God if your depth perception is earth accidents praise God and spiritually if your depth perception is amen because you're approaching you the wrong way you must have good perception what is the devil trying to get you involved in hallelujah the other thing they say you need focus and ability amen not just win it Twitter you need good focus and ability because there might be some object a little further out and you got to be able to see them as well and focus on what is really happening there before you the other thing they say you need good color vision amen all of these things go amen together when it's presenting perfect vision hallelujah hallelujah I told you 2020 the vision is average it's normal a minute it's what everybody else got hallelujah glory to God if I can put it in church world Amen everybody got a Bible they ran all up and got a Bible and they can read twin it's witty but I already able to see the promise for this thing see when you're looking at the promise for this day now you got some perception a man not now now you now you can see things you can see everything not just this one little part hallelujah not just the one little charter further you can see everything a man so so when I thought about this if 2020 vision is just ordinary I said to myself I don't want to be ordinary it's when it's money I want to be extraordinary amen I don't want to be usual amen I want God to do the unusual please you know I'm not trying to be the same as everybody else I actually want to be different please God I don't want to see the natural in 2020 I want to see the supernatural [Applause] [Music] I want to see Oh glory to God look at this you know there's a couple definitions when we talk about vision a man and I want to bring this the first definition is the faculty or state of being able to see that's all that's all vision is this a faculty or state is being able to see and I thought about this this quote here that goes along that I felt what going on with that out of behold I stand at the door and knock he managed that the fact I've stated being able to see hallelujah hey man this goes more spiritual than than natural you know and I'm not I'm not knocking anybody that gotta you can set a vision for your business and you know how many Lord bless you with so many clients to the Lord do this Lord do that I want it I want to share something with you and a brother share with me one time my ex brother he was running a business I said brother how many clients you got he said brother I don't count my clients I said you don't count your clients he said no I don't I don't count my clients and say why not brother say you know remember when when David went out and counted all of his army to see how many worries he had he said and then he got in trouble with God when he counted they say I just depend on God to meet my needs a man already got and this year God gonna meet your needs not only gonna meet a become due to exceed in the abundant above all you can ask a thing glory to God alright hallelujah you'll see at the end of the year when you pay your taxes you'll see how good God been to you praise the Lord Amen look at this Amen the whole die standard or not because his first definition of the word vision is the Faculty of state of being able to see now look the Prophet says and then he said who are you looking for who are you looking for Elijah said yes sir we're looking for him said come and I'll show you what he said and it was Elijah Elijah talking Elijah talking to them that's the bad black blindness he said come here I'll show you where's that come follow me and he lied to let the whole Syrian army looking at every tree looking at everybody looking at Elijah yet blind so they had 20/20 vision but they didn't have depth of perception or any of these other things they completely missing that but they they could see in promise them they were not using glasses to follow me life shot remember they were missing everything else don't be that way in this hour will you miss him what God is doing glory to God look it goes on a little further he says blessed be the name of the Lord God open your eyes blind and don't know it and he went right down among into a monster Israelites where they was laying for ambush and then he turned around to them and their eyes were open my is seeing that it was Elijah blind looking at everything 20/20 eyesight Chloe a many yet didn't realize that that was Elijah so even today people could have 20/20 I say but not be able to recognize God and we are the Elijah waiting for the double portion as brother quickly prayed this morning watching me expect that in 2020 if we got open and clear vision looking at everything 20/20 outside and yet didn't realize that was Elijah did not Jesus have two of his disciples blinded all day until he got on the inside and performed a miracle just like he did before his crucifix crucifixion and their eyes were open I'm praying that God will open our eyes so we can see him in this hour amen we want to see him amen the second definition says the ability to think about or plan so we have vision they make you have an ability to think about or plan the future with imagination or with wisdom a man you can plan your future with an imagination ain't that's some that's what that's what they put a man in the dictionary as their definition of vision so when you got vision you can plan your future on two things imagination or wisdom now let's put it this way we know why they'd use wisdom because the mistakes of our past should teach us not to do things a certain way hallelujah so we can apply the wisdom learn and make better decisions for our future and that actually gives us vision praise the Lord Amen but your imagination mind that powerful amen God could actually use that because the right mental attitude towards any divine promise oh it will bring it to pass just if you have the right attitude towards the promise you got to imagine yourself a man walking into that promise you got to see yourself overcoming come on search you got to see yourself of Victoire you get to see yourself as more than a conquerer somebody when you start expecting you start talking about it when you start talking about it you start they may confess in it will you confess you already testifying about it I'm not waiting to feel nothing I'm not waiting to see nothing but I'm imagining it right now I'm speaking by my my faith my imagination glory to God I got faith in what I'm imagining especially when it comes to the things of God now you know the ability to think about a plan the future with imagination or with wisdom and I just thought about this diverse proverbs 29:18 where there is no vision glory the people perish where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he a man where there is no vision so the ability to think about or plan amen the future with imagination or with wisdom we got to have not only for ourselves but you know even for this church we have a vision Lord of God you got you got a vision for your career you got a visit up a vision for your business you got a vision for your family every man should have a vision for his own family a man every mama want to see her children make it you got to have a vision for it no matter what you see in the natural you got to hold on to the vision that God gave you and your vision can be found right in the scripture when you read a promise from God you got a vision Oh God because the writer Lord is precious if you just read the Word of God you can get the vision and when you catch the vision step into it watch this you know we got a vision for this church and our vision is actually based out of Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11 through 15 a man that's where our vision for the church a man is inspired from and I won't read all of that but I'll just tell you the vision for the church is to bring the Saints to a perfect place in Christ Oh hallelujah Amen this year our vision for the church every other Church slant-eyed a vision what do we let out our vision spiritually spiritually is Sabrina Saints to a perfect place in Christ hallelujah amen the other part of the vision is to continue the ministry of Jesus Christ [Applause] it was an administrative area Branum but it was the ministry of Jesus Christ and in the broad to be like shine for this will continue the ministry of Jesus Christ the other part of the vision is to edify the body of Jesus Christ so we all come to the unity of the faith to the steps of a perfect man that is the vision for this church amen so they say the ability to think about a plan the future with imagination or with wisdom and I'm thinking about planning the future that we're gonna have a perfect church without spot or wrinkle people fall in line with the Word of God we don't have the rest of which about this we need a double portion of the Holy Ghost to bring conviction to our hearts glory to God we meet no Jesus we meet Moten's son say I need a limo no you need a lot more Jesus we need mo Jesus this last definition of vision says an experience of seeing someone or something in a dream or trance or as a supernatural apparition a man so to experience of seeing someone or something in a dream or trance that's having a vision right in a dream or in a trench now now look at what the Prophet says I want to bring up a little statement here that immediately says out of my new ministry already caught a man the experience of seeing someone or something in a dream or in a trench and if I'm gonna just get ahead of myself I'm gonna let you know God has already seeing you and he has a certain thing that he's expecting of you and now and when he saw you he told the Prophet pick up his pick up your pen and write this and what he wrote was something for the future and I want to declare 2020 no more let it be future but let it be a manifestation right now the rapture cannot continue to be a future event there must be a year that we step into and that will be the year it was just like when our Lord was born on this earth when he came the first time the prophecies that were spoken over virgin conceiving that were had to firm a person a virgin somewhere that the work is set alone oh my goodness the war had the food water went after the puppets mouth with succulent ears for generation after generation just cycling and whirling around until finally sit in the living room one morning a one-man whatever was a lady named Mary and the Lord came circling circling circling circling circling circling circling here's Mary and they weren't dropped into Mary's heart and it became a manifestation when she said a man - it and when we can come to a point that we can say many what God said about us it's gonna stop being future events and we're gonna hit zero time we are here the air declares that we're a double zero we're here [Applause] alright alright alright hallelujah this ain't just tweenty tweenty here we got more peripheral things that we're looking at caps it all to colors amen we get in the depth of it come on search we're going a little further than that oh mama you can go to any church and have you amen they can talk about your business being blessed this year hey man glory yet but but one day you're gonna leave that business here one day you're gonna leave the business thanks Lord God Dagon Cole asking if I'm still in business nobody's picking up the phone they just not pick it out and call mother no one is picking up the phone hey man the war in the Gulf Cartel be like on a train somewhere and we're not coming back look at this in my new ministry this definition of vision and experience of seeing someone or something in a dream or trance or as a supernatural apparition a man and a user example the idea came to him in a vision the idea came in a vision God can give you an idea in a vision a man you know every company that has been started started because somebody had a vision hallelujah somebody believed they could do that glory to God I was looking this year and seemed like the traffic has slowed down so much around the holiday season wasn't that much traffic out on the highway and I'm like because usually this time of year men's bumper-to-bumper everywhere you go all day long it's like that and I'm like it's only like a couple days before Christmas that I noticed there was a lot of traffic but my god down the street from my house I saw all these trucks lined up coming out of this one parking lot I said that way that's the traffic right there it was Amazon Amazon I said everybody down but the man had a vision I think so I don't know where it started thinking this garage is something man had a vision and look at what happened with this vision so I want to tell you if God gave you a vision don't give up on it cuz God can give you an idea intervention oh go over to God look at this now the Prophet says in my new ministry he says and as brother to police they said a while ago the only reason I believe that God lets this go on as much as it does now because of his promised because of its promise the works that I do the things that I do show you also now that's a promise from God the works that I do shall you do also and greater works than these shall you do that's what he said right it says such a name more than this show you do for I go to my father it is His divine promise a vision never heals anyone a vision only brings the reality of a supernatural being present so the vision don't bring healing but the vision does bring a man the reality of a supernatural being present that's what we want to see this year we want the vision to bring the supernatural I mean the reality of his supernatural presence amongst us it says and then in doing this it brings faith to the people so that's why I say I don't want to just be natural like everybody else see the supernatural I don't want to just be ordinary I want to be extraordinary that's what I'm claiming for this year I loo anytime Jesus did someone natural those weren't coming it was uncommon and as a bride we gotta look to be uncommon hallelujah amen all right now let's go into a little something here oh yes Lord thank you Jesus give me a couple more quotes and then I wonder just kind of go until the story this is how to show us the father it'll satisfy and that's what I'm looking for this year Lord show us the father a man show us his mighty works do all that you that you promise to doing are myths a man do it this year show us the father descent I says now this is a prayer line that the Prophet is dealing with he says now here's a lady strange to me I don't know her I've never seen her you're totally stranger to me praise be to God yes sister you were the one praying wasn't you the blood condition you got haven't sit there with our heart trouble your faith has saved you go home well if that was you being called out you just go home and accept it now now in order for you to go home and accept it what you'd have to do first it's catch the vision and then step into it do something with it hey man sister Brown told us we took the Lord Toa give me something to work with catch the vision and then step into it watch this now says what happened here it come before me right here in a vision seeing the woman praying the Holy Ghost standing over her or the age of the Lord I turn he went that way I looked and I seen her being examined it's gone from you her faith made her well hallelujah if thou canst believe all things are possible every person in here ought to be healed at this minute if you were sick I would have said amen to that right here every person in here ought to be healed at this minute amen glory to God a manis are not dead waters Church the word is still alive these testimonies are real and if competed back then he's the same yesterday today forever listen he says since our thoughts can't believe all things are possible every person in there ought to be healed at this minute you are as far as God's concern it's just your faith keeping you from being healed lord help me father says we can stop the prayer line right now and every one of you if you'd accepted upon those basis but you've got to believe you gotta have faith just believe have faith that's all I ask you to do now it goes on here says a little something as he says he can heal diabetes I said hey man I said hey man hey man he says he can heal diabetes you believe it yes I believe it sitting there praying about it aren't you so that's right brother you believe me to be his prophet yes I do amen he can heal high blood pressure too yes sister here with your hand was hearts over to God he's called out in your conditions you wanna receive your healing right now catch the vision [Applause] [Music] let me just let me let me Oh God let me just stay with this glory to God catch the vision and step into it lord help us Jesus we're gonna be trying to get here somewhere it says I high blood pressure - you believe that sister here with your hand up what's heart trouble to die or arthritis other ones oh my I wish you could if you can catch the vision this is the first that you really believed the first thing that identifies that you can but let you all a believer is that you're able to catch tradition do you realize I'm trying to get back to school let me let me just see if I can just put it there so I can remember where I was you realize when Jesus came to amen I believe was uh the Pool of Bethesda and you know this man had been sitting around the pool for thirty-eight years with a condition and as he was sitting there with it with the condition Jesus being led by a man his father cuz he said I do nothing unless the father show me so he's led to go down to this man he begins to have a conversation with them will thou be made whole the man say you know I would but you know as soon as the angel come in trouble or water I have nobody to help me to get in and and by the time I get up somebody already jumped in and front of me say I didn't come here to hear all your excuses about all your excuses I ask you will you be made whole and if the naked only catch the vision because Jesus was there to see him and when he caught the vision yeah I'll be male se but get up off your car and take it and go home without getting in the water the normal Amen process is for people to get into the water but in this situation [Applause] you came in 2020 compassion process in order to see him bypass the process you must catch the vision and when you catch submission to it and receive all that Karkat for you that man took up his got his put it on his shoulder and went on somewhere he's I was in my testimony glory glory glory hallelujah let me just read another little quote here before we go further Jesus help us this is out of the message of super sense so everybody could be normal natural with 20/20 but we need a little bit more than that hey man we want we want a little bit more vision than that hearing this message is super sense natural people are controlled by five senses but holy ghost' feel people have a sixth sense and only holy ghost feel people have this so with you being a holy ghost feel you should not be acting normal you shouldn't even think normal alright you should act natural you should act supernatural with with the sixth sense this year let's let's just set it out straight right with the sixth sense you need to act different than everybody else because you got something that they don't have look at what the prophets say here says now I would not say that because that we received a sixth sense that the five senses are no good no more yes they are those five senses were given to you by God and they are to be used says but when the five senses act contrary to the Word of God then they are lying glory now the sixth sense cannot lie it's a super sense and that's what I want to speak about this morning I spoke on a super silent tonight on a super sense he says and the super sense is a Holy Spirit the faith of God that dwells in you Oh hallelujah you're not looking forward to come it's already here we're trying to tap into this and if you let the five senses be yielded to the sixth sense it will guides you and bring all the other five senses under control of that super sense for so far above the natural sense as a spiritual man is above the natural it's as far as high as the heaven is above the natural man and his five senses look at this makes you believe things that you cannot see Twitter 20 vengeance is only looking at what's in front of me but the sixth sense goes beyond what's in front of me I'm not stopping that 20 feet 20/20 vision limits you to 20 feet you can only see 20 feet in front of you with 20/20 vision but I want to go beyond 20 feet my promise might be a thousand feet up 2,000 feet don't let Twitter swimmy limit you go beyond that in your face that's not normal Amen that's supernatural glory to God look at this now it says it makes you believe things that you cannot see it makes you act where you do not think the five senses would ever think about it the devil can't get into those five senses and lie to you but it cannot touch that super sense that's far beyond his reach that come from God is called faith and faith is that great thing we're going beyond 20/20 and we will get everything that God promised us even the things that we cannot see [Music] I might not be able to see with these signs but I can see with my face blow and I'm bringing that promise in view i'ma praise God for what he's keep what what he's doing and what he's getting ready to do Oh hallelujah Jesus now this just little thought came to me I want to circle back around I won't have time to read all of this but it's in the message wisdom versus faith I won't read it Amen but I was telling you all the testimony and I preached the sermon a few weeks a few few months ago a man about sin the word send the word and brother Branham was telling us in that that the man that has stole brother Evans car the man used to be a Christian and because he used to be a Christian they can pray a prayer and and when they prayed a prayer they sent the words after this man hallelujah amen and they just they just claims as lawyer you told us whatever we ask in your name that we could have it they they put that that promise inside the prayer and I want to tell you that when you're praying make sure you you got to read the Word of God so you know what God promised you and then you can put the promise of God in the prayer and just send it on off hallelujah God that's not my word that's what you say and since you said I'm expecting you to bring it to pass it's not up to me to bring it to pass it's up to you to bring in the past you made the promise and I was told that you a God that cannot lie [Music] Sheila in Jesus name is sitting on off they send the world after that man and and before you know the world with circling found that fellow with the calm and conviction sent on them he says you bet you're gonna get in trouble with this say the man actually had a tie on a suit on driving down the road looking like he'd going to church almost driving this man let us throw the car like that and another man used to be a Christian soul in the world called him the word could deal with his conscience and the word he'd stoned and told him turn the car back around because I'm just sitting the man on a certain Street to look for Scott it better be there man turn the car around and brother back he got out and went on about his business but because he had something that the world can attach to that's why he turned around he brought the car but then the same brother had another trial brother average have another trial he's selling cars this time and when he's selling cars Amen he somehow he let a man I don't know if you let the man test drive the car what but when you let the man get the keys to the counter man snuck away with that pan on the money that he over so brother branham said that they sent the word after this guy's say but this man had nothing for the word to latch on to he says so since the word could not hitch onto him and deal with his conscience he say the word just watched him the word just looked to see where he was the word knew his hair dress hallelujah amen and the word allowed some brothers to find out where he live with the kindest front yards now the brothers didn't go approach him but they went back and they told brother Evans glory to God stay with me here they would make say that brother that's that man that got your car he not a problem but the man that got your car he live in Bowling Green so he does say okay alright alright my brother Evans never got anything in him to go down to Bowling Green and go get his car hallelujah but amen but the word was watching over and told him exactly where the man was so now once he got amen amen once he got something he would go and get that car now let's read just a little bit I won't read it all but I read some of it oh Jesus because this means something see you gotta catch the vision first then step into it all right I'm gonna start at paragraphs 350 own wisdom verses faith hallelujah glory glory glory thank you Jesus a man a man a man actually a 348 just go up a little bit so that's first thing you know he says one of his boys was driving along down here on the road and there it was he's seen the man in the car got his number so I've seen him in the car got his number turned turned in to brother woods they called it found out where it was he was in Bowling Green God in heaven knows I've never heard one word about it no nothing about it it says last Sunday it was a week ago afternoon when we got through preaching here went up there changed my clothes got ready to go to Florida or down brother Welch for a meeting that following night and when I got in the car now look now when I got in the car on his way to Florida for a meeting when I got in the car I seen that man brother Brad let's say I've seen that man so vision has come it says that I seen that man I said brother Welch now not a new look of the man had the carnage in Bowling Green he said but I stress that I seen that man said for the Welsh further me he said sir brother works I couldn't tell him now glory he's got to make them move you got to give God something to work with God he gonna tell you everything to do but you gotta give him something to work with he's got to make the move his self see just like me to have to make her decision there see I said we're going through Bowling Green that's all he told her brother he told brother what we're going through ball at Bowling Green he said that's about 30 miles out of the way now his reasoning he's reasoning with the profit but the profit is not even now deal with his readers like he said we've gone through Bowling Green he not explaining why we going through Berlin Bowling Green he like saw the vision of the brother getting his money back but he can't tell him this man got something that he got to do himself you already guy he's got to first catch the vision and then step into it glory glory glory for your healing you got to catch it then step into it amen for anything that God has promised you got to catch it then step into it start acting like it shows already glory church a man you got to start acting like it's yours when you start that you start praying different winners yours they may you start looking different winners yours come on church you gotta catch the vision and then step into it watch this now watch this it says that's that's about 30 miles out of the way says window down the road I thought oh he'll get it oh you'll get it said see he'll get it see he's just got to get it not a prophet want to do everything he can to make sure he get it but like no I just oh he'll get it he just got to get it rather we gone through Bowling Green oh Jesus watch now says went on down so sevens and I have two wild and said you know brother branham he said I've been so thick-headed it's probably a good thing this was a 30-mile drive out the way cuz he would have missed it sometime it take a little time for us to catch what God's trying to do you say it says brother branham have I been so thick-headed glory to God you said bowling-green a while ago yeah he said you know that man that got my money run off with it said yes say he's in Bowling Green I've been thinking about a seat when he was thinking about it he was catching the vision oh the imagination right when you're thinking about it now you're catching what God is about to do now when it comes to you now he's thinking about it you gonna see where he steps into it watch this amen he says that man got my money run off with it yes said he's in mother green I've been thinking about it I got a thing here I'm gonna turn it over fine where he's at then I'm gonna turn I said said what would you do would you go down and get your money now see this is a key if I tell him then city's got see he's got something to do his self see he's got something to do I couldn't tell him if I did it would break the vision right there see so I had to let see just like saying this is why we now we go back to our scripture glory to God why did Jesus stand there and say to Mary Martha take you away the stone I'll take the Taylor quote down for me there please let's just let's follow this now we back to the scripture let me just when we look at John 11 now because you got these two sisters and these two sisters got two spirits on two different spirits they born from the same parents but yet their approach situations differently Martha heard that I mean they both sit for Jesus because their brother was dying and brother Branham said that Jesus had a vision and actually saw Lazarus died he saw him dead hallelujah so he waited four days before he did anything and they sent before why he was sick they said before they buried him Jesus come and do something about our brother Lazarus you'd love our family come to some Jesus delayed the process hallelujah Jesus shows up four days later and when it gets there Martha begins to say Oh God Lord if you hadn't been here I know my brother was not a doctor I know you went to die I mean he would you know I'm tell you it would have been over if you would have been here he'd see so he say you say it say Martha let me just get this real quick hallelujah Amen Johnny leaven here glory I want to make sure we got this real real good Oh before we got before I go yeah you say say Martha lord help us Jesus that was it says she he says that brother shall rise again right you take mother so your brother died rather you say mother said now know that he'll rise again in the resurrection at the last day now while Martha's having this conversation with the Lord Jesus Mary is still inside the house crying Mary is still working through a feelings Mary is still working through her emotions mary has not moved from her her company of mortars hallelujah it's time for some of y'all to move from your company of mourners because in the company of Mormons that mourners the supernatural is not going to happen but you have to come out from a midst of the company of mourners you feel bad you just
