[12:43] well we thank God Amen for them uh it is
[12:47] not often that we get somebody passing
[12:50] through like this so I am I'm I feel
[12:53] like we're blessed tonight and like I
[12:55] mentioned on Sunday
[12:56] um when Ruth was in the field of Boaz uh
[13:01] Boaz told the Reapers to drop some
[13:03] things on purpose uh just for her so I
[13:06] believe tonight the Lord Jesus will drop
[13:08] some things on purpose amen just for us
[13:12] so we're we're under expectation let's
[13:15] just have a quick word of prayer amen as
[13:16] our brother just prepares to come amen
[13:19] tonight father
[13:20] as we just begin to turn the service a
[13:24] man into the hands of your man's servant
[13:27] we pray o God that you would use them
[13:29] for your glory you know what this church
[13:32] stands in need of here tonight and it's
[13:35] not by accident it's not by chance that
[13:37] you allowed our brother to pass this way
[13:40] we're asked that you would use them Lord
[13:43] For Your Glory let the the words just
[13:46] come fresh from the Throne of God
[13:48] directly to the hearts of the people and
[13:51] father we ask that you would hide him
[13:53] behind the cross that he might not be
[13:54] seen but may Christ be on display
[13:57] tonight God is in Jesus name that we
[14:01] pray amen amen Amen brother and guinea
[14:05] amen let's just welcome him at this time
[14:08] praise the Lord amen
[14:13] thank you
[14:27] okay I'm in agree to All In The Name Of
[14:30] The Lord Jesus Christ I'm certainly
[14:32] happy to be here and see my friend
[14:35] brother check and all my friends who are
[14:38] here and a few of them visited Us in
[14:41] Zimbabwe I think it was the the last
[14:43] time we met sister Ellen and I was
[14:45] wasn't the wedding of brother Simba
[14:48] right
[14:49] yeah it's as if it's yesterday yeah
[14:53] I want to thank the Lord for giving us
[14:56] this opportunity to pass by this way
[14:58] we've been
[15:00] with you all my whole family back there
[15:02] we have been enjoying the cold land of
[15:06] America
[15:08] and I thank God for my friend brother
[15:11] Aaron he flew from South Carolina just
[15:14] to come and drive us and be with us is a
[15:16] very powerful Minister that yeah he's
[15:19] very gifted so now knowing that my time
[15:22] is very short let's go straight to uh
[15:26] the Book of Esther so I'll read from the
[15:30] first first verse he says now it came to
[15:32] pass in the days of Israel which reigned
[15:35] in India even to Ethiopia over 107 27
[15:39] provinces that in those days when the
[15:42] king sat on the throne of the Kingdom
[15:44] which is a shushan the palace let us
[15:46] pray our heavenly father will come the
[15:48] service into our hands may you come and
[15:50] Minister Lord further directly to our
[15:52] needs spiritually financially in all
[15:55] directions of life let your spirit Lord
[15:58] father cause a difference May Holy
[16:00] Spirit overshadow your people Lord
[16:02] father and descend their needs and their
[16:04] desires and make us have a closer walk
[16:06] with you about that Supernatural
[16:08] experience that assures us that give us
[16:11] strength to work in this journey Lord
[16:12] father I cook the substitutions in Jesus
[16:15] name amen night will not be seated my
[16:18] subject today is when God turns the
[16:21] purpose I will use the whole book of
[16:24] Esther just to demonstrate how the
[16:26] Unseen hand of God moves around in our
[16:29] lives to arrange pieces there's an
[16:31] unseen hand that moves in our lives and
[16:34] God can connect the pieces he can join
[16:37] the pieces in your life so we find that
[16:39] in this book of Esther it starts with a
[16:42] great feast so it opens with a lavish
[16:45] banquet
[16:46] um when this king is also Sexes who is
[16:51] the son of King Darius the Clinton the
[16:54] son of Cyrus we met the decree for the
[16:57] children of Israel to go back and this
[17:00] other son grandson or after him
[17:07] um
[17:09] who later let the other decree so the
[17:13] interesting thing about the Book of
[17:15] Esther is that Esther means a star
[17:18] this is not her name this is the given
[17:20] name and the Jewish name was which means
[17:24] my true tree a star means if she's a
[17:29] star star shine better in darkness so
[17:33] God was going to create some form of
[17:34] Darkness
[17:36] because names are powerful this the star
[17:39] will defy the darkness and the child of
[17:42] God will defy any evil background in
[17:45] their lives so unfortunate things are to
[17:48] start from the early age of Esther to
[17:51] create enough Darkness for her to shine
[18:04] so we find that Esther had actually
[18:08] influenced
[18:09] by helping in the Palace of the final
[18:13] decree by Arthur's axis
[18:17] so as a sister you can actually
[18:19] influence great things
[18:21] if you are in your right position
[18:23] actually the prophet says a sister a
[18:26] woman in the kitchen a wife can do more
[18:28] for the kingdom of God in a position
[18:31] than some preachers on the field that is
[18:34] the out the impact of being in your
[18:37] position in the great jigs of puzzle of
[18:39] God so we find that the Book of Esther
[18:42] does not even mention the name of God it
[18:45] is it shows that God was behind the
[18:47] scenes when God seems like he's absent
[18:51] when God seems like he's silent he's
[18:53] working things to a favor in the
[18:55] background
[18:56] now there's a question that did Esther
[18:59] and the king have children together we
[19:01] don't have the Bible answer for that one
[19:03] but now before we even take this sport
[19:06] cruise together through the Book of
[19:08] Esther and let's just look at this
[19:10] beautiful way of seeing the message
[19:13] through the Bible and starting from
[19:16] Genesis
[19:17] the first five letters I'm saying seeing
[19:21] the message in the chronology of the
[19:22] scriptures and where the Book of Esther
[19:25] is placed so the first five letters
[19:28] depend at which is like the gospels in
[19:31] the New Testament we want to see the
[19:33] message in the order of the scripture
[19:34] Joshua becomes like the book of Acts
[19:37] judges become The Messengers
[19:40] so then a route becomes the bride then
[19:45] the last charge being Samuel who is
[19:47] Daniel anointed Kings
[19:50] becomes the last messenger and so we
[19:53] then become Kings and Priests
[19:56] so the book of Kings become may God has
[19:59] made us Kings and Priests then the next
[20:02] book being Chronicles the Bible says
[20:04] books are open that is the Judgment time
[20:08] um but now at that time when the message
[20:11] goes is over with the Gentiles it goes
[20:14] to the Jews so Israel Maya is the gospel
[20:18] to the Jews
[20:20] so after that they call out Esther from
[20:24] the Jewish side then when asked when the
[20:26] Jews are called the next book is job
[20:29] which is tribulation we know that it's
[20:32] 42 chapters in the 42 months is three
[20:36] and a half years
[20:37] then after that it's the singing
[20:40] Hallelujah we are paid to the Millennium
[20:43] so looking at the Book of Esther it
[20:45] shows courage in Dark Times a Believer
[20:50] is never a loser Against All Odds a
[20:53] cushion overcomes it shows the quiet
[20:55] hand of God when things seems like they
[20:58] are not moving and things seem like they
[21:00] are out of control there is an unseen
[21:02] hand it shows that when Grace look at
[21:05] you nothing can stop your destiny it
[21:08] shows that poet is thousand times of
[21:12] answering your needs he specializes in
[21:14] things not impossible you must trust the
[21:17] invisible end of God so we will see us
[21:21] that defying a background there is a
[21:24] reason why things started dark it's
[21:25] called making a contrast so that you can
[21:29] shine better against that so that you
[21:31] can defile your background actually
[21:32] adversity in sports University to train
[21:36] you many people
[21:40] [Music]
[21:58] your life
[22:00] when the Book of Esther starts
[22:03] it starts as if it's the book of Haman
[22:06] that God tells the tables it may look
[22:09] like you have been defeated but we are
[22:11] perplexed but not in despair because all
[22:14] things we are more than Congress it
[22:17] shows us that is the master plan what is
[22:20] a master planner
[22:22] God is a master strategist God is a
[22:26] master scouter God is a Mastercraft man
[22:30] God is a master artist
[22:32] the development of the picture
[22:35] is going to develop nicely leave the
[22:37] picture to come out and you shall know
[22:40] as you are known in heaven our Lord is a
[22:43] master engineer our court is a master
[22:46] mathematician
[22:47] [Music]
[22:49] place just leave it to God so we find
[22:52] that in the third year that is very
[22:56] important of the rain he made the feast
[22:58] throughout these provinces there
[23:01] 480 days
[23:04] there you are showing everything and
[23:07] then later the in the Book of Esther you
[23:09] find the enemy of the truth
[23:12] you know this is a delayed man she said
[23:14] drama is called people and everything to
[23:17] bring an appetite which is an amalekites
[23:21] because amalekites had always been
[23:23] enemies of Jews so then we find that uh
[23:27] in this breakfast when it finished when
[23:30] those days were expired the king called
[23:32] the fist for seven days
[23:34] so he said there were only seven thh's
[23:36] now now in that first one he was
[23:39] displaying all these Splenda and riches
[23:41] it is said that no one saw the same
[23:43] thing twice God is so rich in Mercy that
[23:47] you can have experience After
[23:49] experiencing still not exhaust the
[23:51] goodness of God all these goodness is
[23:54] coming after you so in those seven days
[23:56] we expired so he causes seven
[23:59] chamberlains there is the numbers
[24:01] playing again so it says because when he
[24:05] was shown all his wishes it's not the
[24:07] biggest thing he has the biggest thing
[24:09] is the wife amen after a simple God in
[24:12] nature the greatest mystery is Christ in
[24:16] you
[24:16] the hope of glory so now he calls the
[24:20] wife which is vasty and then she refuses
[24:23] participates drama to bring Grace there
[24:26] is a reason why I even choose it to
[24:28] refuse him so that we come in so verse 2
[24:32] was also busy with their feast I usually
[24:35] say sister even if you went to vastly
[24:37] don't be a vast be submissive to your
[24:40] husband don't have parallel structures
[24:42] and programs so then we find that he
[24:46] calls the seven chamberlains that are
[24:48] written there and to bring vast but she
[24:51] refused then in sixth Council that
[24:53] because he refused they want he wanted
[24:56] to know the the king's anger was burning
[24:59] but now what was the problem of fasting
[25:02] it's a background you must Define your
[25:04] background because history says that she
[25:07] was a daughter of belt shaza
[25:09] and she was also a wife before in
[25:13] marriage you don't need much experience
[25:15] um so one of the case greatest
[25:19] one of the greatest kings in the world
[25:21] is a great feast and called the queen
[25:23] but you didn't come she refused you are
[25:26] so humiliated he says now Christ is
[25:28] calling us to Heavenly places we must
[25:31] not refuse his call so in verse 14 now
[25:35] we find that these are the seven
[25:38] chamberlains then he starts Consulting
[25:41] them indicates advice from the seventh
[25:44] one you see in the older then uh going
[25:47] backwards the seventh one is right then
[25:51] here in the seventh he's the one who
[25:54] advises the king Mommy can the seventh
[25:56] now that is very important because the
[26:01] king is Signet and to begin with namikan
[26:04] is the seventh and the seven letters and
[26:06] that that fits the message very well she
[26:10] is the King's Authority but when I read
[26:13] started in the Jewish statnam uh they
[26:18] say mom again is Daniel
[26:19] wow according to the Jewish they say
[26:23] it's not his proper name but his proper
[26:25] name is Daniel
[26:26] so you can research more about that it's
[26:28] not absolute but this is what Jews say
[26:30] so it was a prophet who was the servant
[26:34] who advised the king about the pride in
[26:38] the truthy of a pride so he was
[26:40] co-signator with God as the bride you
[26:43] are co-signatory
[26:45] ass with Christ because everybody owns
[26:49] it belongs to you only a child of God
[26:52] you are not an embarrassed of any but
[26:55] ambassador of Heaven
[27:06] it's an authority
[27:09] if you are a novice don't dispute with
[27:11] authorities don't find advice from
[27:13] YouTube and and from everywhere and try
[27:16] to to disprove and authoritative Signet
[27:18] because in other chapter 3 says in the
[27:21] 24th day of the of the seventh is it
[27:25] nine month yeah
[27:26] um
[27:30] that is when our Prophet was taken in
[27:33] the 24th day of the ninth month which is
[27:35] December to choose to us so now when the
[27:39] King was angry about first he spent four
[27:42] years without a queen
[27:44] they believed in letting the dust set
[27:47] before the next move he saw them because
[27:50] now it was now in the 10th month um it
[27:54] was in the seventh year now it was 44
[27:58] years without the queen but now why he
[28:00] had his four years without a queen is
[28:03] because he was busy fighting in Greece
[28:06] his daughter let me fight other battles
[28:08] the marriage is tough at this moment let
[28:10] me fight other battles then
[28:12] unfortunately also lost there when he
[28:16] was angry he was a man who could not
[28:18] have said this defeat so when he sent
[28:22] um when he was attacking prison
[28:25] and sent his army they wanted to make a
[28:27] bridge and when the bridge failed he
[28:30] actually killed all the engineers for
[28:31] failure
[28:32] and then when they told him that no it
[28:35] was the waters in the storm he said no
[28:37] even the waters must obey me so he was
[28:40] upset here to to send the soldiers to to
[28:45] beat the sea 300 times whip it why did
[28:50] you cause my things to fave
[28:52] so he branded the sea with red hot ions
[28:55] and soldiers shouted at the waters he
[28:58] did not believe any force of nature can
[29:01] cause him to fail that was the man
[29:03] determined to Victory so in chapter two
[29:06] of Esther now we find that
[29:08] um when his right was appeased
[29:12] he did not want to move when he was
[29:13] still angry but four years angry I don't
[29:16] think it's okay because the sun must not
[29:18] set in your anger
[29:19] so when he then remembered first then he
[29:22] says now what should be done and yet to
[29:24] be canceled you know no matter how great
[29:25] you are you need advice from others so
[29:29] then Joseph Joseph has the historian
[29:32] says 400 virgins came to the king it
[29:36] shows us that money are cold but if you
[29:38] are chosen yeah so when Esther came it
[29:42] was a chance to come she tried to hide
[29:44] you know the real people for the job as
[29:47] we say I'm the one I can see I can
[29:49] preach I can she tried to hide but when
[29:52] mercy locates you you cannot hide so
[29:56] when it was the first time in the palace
[29:58] she it was looking strange maybe it's
[30:00] your first time today here you don't
[30:03] know it's your place she didn't know
[30:04] it's her place but she was straight it
[30:07] was looking strange because it was a
[30:09] first time but now Queen Esther found
[30:13] favor in the eyes of those that saw him
[30:16] Divine favor is a great thing in our
[30:19] lives it's not of good that we have done
[30:21] but it's good who shows mercy so many
[30:24] are called but a few are chosen so
[30:30] extraordinary purpose
[30:32] you may look like a usual person seated
[30:35] in your usual place but something
[30:37] unusual is fixing to happen today
[30:39] because you have an unusual God who
[30:41] works in a mutual way is
[30:44] through usual people the good thing
[30:46] about Esther Like an Eagle she root
[30:49] above the storms and the Bible says in
[30:52] Psalm 75 verse 6 to 7 promotion does not
[30:55] come from the east to west it comes from
[30:58] the Lord so it's God will elevated here
[31:00] so the modern day Persia is where Iraq
[31:05] is where the the kingdom was stretching
[31:08] to this place where this
[31:11] Arab areas so people die but spirits
[31:15] remain
[31:16] that's why you find these days that's
[31:19] where they are the Hammonds of today
[31:21] that's why one time when Netanyahu was
[31:24] talking to Obama and there was a big
[31:28] debate about Iran he gave Obama a copy
[31:32] of the Book of Esther meaning the same
[31:35] God is alive now this is a pattern in
[31:38] the Bible that everyone who Rose against
[31:39] the Jews at a mysterious end and any
[31:42] weapon that rises against you shall not
[31:44] Prosper even this man from Iran they had
[31:48] a mysterious end and that's why in
[31:50] netanyahu's other speech he gave facts
[31:53] that who are the Hammers to scare me or
[31:55] terrify me we survived Pharaoh we
[31:57] survived the Greeks we survived the
[31:58] Romans we survived Inquisition in Spain
[32:01] the problems in Russia will survived
[32:03] Hitler we survived the chairman we
[32:05] survived through many dangerous Turtles
[32:08] and snares I've already come to this
[32:11] place that has let me save this far and
[32:14] Grace will lead me home the least is
[32:17] endless of what you have been saved from
[32:19] and look at all the enemies of Israel
[32:22] that they are now just ruins
[32:25] whatever Rises against you do just
[32:27] become ruins just become pieces so now
[32:31] we see that whatever happens God is away
[32:35] in the presence of tobians and palate
[32:38] God made the Jews repaint in topless
[32:41] times in the prayers of haters of Jews I
[32:44] was just seeing this video that when
[32:45] they were trying to burn the flag of
[32:47] Israel when they were trying to play
[32:49] around with the name of Israel God turns
[32:52] the case against them so God is the way
[32:56] one time the newspaper was saying God is
[32:58] diverting their Rockets mid-air you know
[33:01] in the pre in the kingdom of God their
[33:03] sickness is diverted air that cannot
[33:06] touch you worries and frustrations so
[33:09] what is amazing is that Harmony of the
[33:12] Jews is he he sought advice from
[33:15] astrologers to find how to find a a
[33:18] badly inspired date to kill the Jews why
[33:22] he threw his Purim Stones God moved them
[33:25] further by one year
[33:27] to allow the strategizing God to move
[33:29] elements meaning even the devil's
[33:32] weapons are not in His Hands what the
[33:35] devil was trying became an own goal it
[33:38] was the miscalculations of the devil
[33:40] when the devil touches you it's a
[33:42] miscalculation it becomes an own goal
[33:45] against the devil but why Hammond
[33:48] Hammond was in amalekit they always
[33:51] hated that war with Israel for 400 years
[33:53] and Moses said commanded Saul to destroy
[33:56] amalekites so some of our problems is
[34:00] things that we had a chance to destroy
[34:01] things that were the chance to confess
[34:04] or make right then we left them then
[34:07] they become those later so we find that
[34:10] if Esther's purine
[34:12] this day which was supposed to be the
[34:14] death of the Jews is now celebrated as
[34:18] the death of the enemies of the Jews
[34:20] this is how God turns temples around so
[34:24] the thing that was meant to destroy you
[34:26] can actually become the very thing that
[34:29] God is God uses you uses to develop you
[34:32] to what he wants you to be all our
[34:36] trials they become every burden becomes
[34:38] a blessing and God comes down I was
[34:41] eating in another story where they were
[34:43] actually Jews were born in the torture
[34:45] attempts the other one was born on the
[34:49] 29th of April I think in 1945 somewhere
[34:52] there then on the next day the Germans
[34:56] ran out of gas that's how the child
[34:59] survived on the next day they were
[35:01] rescued the dog will run out of gas
[35:04] trying to torment
[35:08] um I saw this image of a child who was
[35:10] born holding the IUD That was supposed
[35:13] to destroy them I don't know if you
[35:15] symmetically I didn't verify it may be
[35:17] not medically correct but I like the
[35:19] concept that what is meant to destroy
[35:22] you you pour it I say Against All Odds
[35:25] I can make it because there is some two
[35:29] things that God does about tables some
[35:31] of them he prepares them some of them
[35:33] attends them so God prepares a temple in
[35:37] the presence of your enemies and
[35:39] sometimes he turns tap us around look at
[35:42] this
[35:42] in the presence of pharaoh the extra
[35:45] pass happened
[35:47] in the presence of penina
[35:49] Hannah is a child and in the presence of
[35:53] of a Haman Mordecai was promoted in the
[35:58] process of the alligators in Nile River
[36:00] Moses basket sail through in the
[36:03] presence of a Potiphar's wife
[36:07] Joseph was elevated things changed
[36:09] overnight I believe things can change
[36:12] overnight in your life in the presence
[36:14] of overflating Japan
[36:16] God made the way for children of Israel
[36:18] he says to those who picked most he says
[36:21] where Saturn's it is but they have not
[36:24] denied my name in the presence of
[36:27] adversity you shall make it what does
[36:30] not remove problems sometimes just
[36:32] proves that it depends of 200 million
[36:34] Devils we go in the Rapture all the same
[36:37] in the prayers of all ancestral spirits
[36:40] and the international spirits who shall
[36:43] make it in the presence of the prince of
[36:47] Persia's answer came down in the
[36:50] presence of the Dragon in Revelation
[36:52] chapter 12 the male child was born so
[36:55] your testimony will be born Against All
[36:57] Odds Against All oppositions In The
[37:00] Presence of the Mamba on the highway the
[37:02] pride is overcoming and binding all the
[37:06] numbers so you shall put us through all
[37:09] your situations in the presence of
[37:11] adversity in the presence of obstacles
[37:14] in the prayers of challenges so on the
[37:17] in the presence of lions
[37:19] you see when they're in the Lion's Den
[37:22] delighting them was more than the lion
[37:24] outside when they operate in a clan of
[37:27] oil the oil in them was more than the
[37:29] old outside when they were putting the
[37:32] fire Defenders the fire in them was more
[37:34] than the fire outside but they were
[37:36] brought before Giants the child in them
[37:39] are spot and they giant outside so the
[37:42] Book of Esther is to show that there is
[37:44] an unseen hand that is leading in our
[37:47] lives that you should feel nothing
[37:49] brother the sport who's working behind
[37:52] the scenes the Book of Esther shows that
[37:54] God remembers you
[37:56] God cannot forget you I believe this day
[37:59] today if you want to pray for last day
[38:02] is still valid one thing God will
[38:04] remember he says
[38:09] about your husband about your wife about
[38:11] your children about your health God will
[38:14] remember all those prayers all right now
[38:17] it shows that even when you think our
[38:20] weight is falling apart God is working
[38:22] behind the scene top was 10 and
[38:25] certainly underdogs become champions
[38:28] Esther was not known at all became the
[38:31] champion when people stand those were
[38:34] oppressors become oppressed that's why
[38:37] the Bible says captivity to be
[38:39] captivated you can doubt your doubts and
[38:42] worry worries you can frustrate your
[38:44] frustrations so God can still turn your
[38:48] situation around today when tables are
[38:51] telling in your favor that is divine
[38:53] favor in your life God is making your
[38:56] life beautiful again our growth is a
[38:59] quote of restoration everything that
[39:01] people stole from your life can come
[39:03] back again whatever was born in
[39:05] spiritual let it come back again
[39:07] whatever I was told in financial Let It
[39:09] Come better thing recruit all days are
[39:12] coming back in your life like something
[39:15] you said once more Lord let's approve
[39:18] prayer times come back
[39:20] days come back in your life I was
[39:23] watching this testimony of our brothers
[39:24] when they were preaching there's a
[39:26] sister who's wearing blue there on the
[39:28] actually just believing that God can
[39:30] turn the tables without him not to say
[39:32] she rose out of the wheelchair and the
[39:35] camera was touching the miracle
[39:38] you know what
[39:40] interacted the service
[39:42] written answer and sometimes God can
[39:46] interrupt your prayer with an answer
[39:49] he says before they even pray
[39:55] please turn around your life when God
[39:58] steps in all things are changed
[40:05] that God doesn't love you the Book of
[40:07] Esther reminds you that there is an
[40:10] unseen hand that will collect pieces for
[40:13] your children
[40:14] academically everywhere any direction of
[40:17] your life the hand of God can reach
[40:19] there when God steps in the miracles
[40:22] happen this person that you see here
[40:26] um
[40:27] these these two were divorced for for 20
[40:30] years
[40:42] [Music]
[40:50] actually happening
[40:53] 20 years divorced
[40:56] it doesn't matter how long we have been
[40:58] in that situation these Services can
[41:01] turn around
[41:02] God Is Bigger Than
[41:04] God
[41:05] tells purpose if you give him his ten
[41:08] when purpose attend your testimony comes
[41:12] the beginning of your trust born it
[41:15] starts with an impossibility
[41:17] every test Point starts with I was
[41:21] is lost I was sick I was broke I was
[41:27] empty but not now
[41:30] the test one is coming there are not
[41:34] enough hammers to stop your testimony
[41:36] from family
[41:36] [Applause]
[41:39] who will be strategizing God because
[41:42] happened to be at the right place
[41:45] [Music]
[41:47] against the king and life yet to be
[41:51] unfair that he was not rewarded at that
[41:53] time because if he was rewarded at that
[41:56] time the program of God was not going to
[41:59] work later
[42:01] so you did something right and someone
[42:03] forgot you it happened to Joseph he says
[42:06] guys remember me but they didn't
[42:08] remember at the right time but the right
[42:11] time was not the right time
[42:26] so you find that God started moving
[42:28] pieces and the king and still when God
[42:32] moves in one area
[42:34] it's still possible to see things
[42:36] getting worse in another area have you
[42:38] seen that you pray for something a
[42:40] testimony happens when you find the
[42:42] other side it gets worse
[42:44] now chapter three things get worse after
[42:48] a little miracle things can still get
[42:50] worse in another side of life you can
[42:53] receive the only questions to your
[42:54] serial fans going down
[42:56] God knows about that it's a strategist
[42:59] so chapter 3
[43:02] Harmony is promoted
[43:05] yeah your enemy needs to be strong for
[43:07] your Testament to be strong
[43:09] if I was brought I was going to create a
[43:12] little table that I will storm quickly
[43:14] because I'm not so powerful in me so but
[43:16] good is so popular to to create quite
[43:19] eating creative but he met someone who
[43:22] is perfect with a timed Witness
[43:24] so that it can be a devil not a small
[43:27] one that you can show crush and people
[43:30] think are not God
[43:32] you need a devil that will crash and
[43:34] people say only God can do this so not
[43:37] power is promoted when you see a problem
[43:40] getting stronger it's about to fall
[43:42] then we find that when there's a Time on
[43:45] the it seems like the enemy is winning
[43:47] that's when God is arranging things
[43:49] because
[43:50] Hamman was not only against those Jews
[43:54] it was against the Messiah because the
[43:57] Messiah was going to come through those
[43:58] truths
[44:00] when anything Fighters the part of
[44:02] Christ is fighting Christ because you
[44:05] are misses Jesus so when the the plot of
[44:08] the wicked pathway for their teammates
[44:11] so one big chapter doesn't mean the
[44:13] story is over
[44:15] chapter 3 was a third chapter only one
[44:17] big chapter there is a synonym that can
[44:19] rewrite don't give up because of one
[44:22] chapter in life keep going on the story
[44:24] doesn't end here the dog will always
[44:27] fights the hardest when we are close to
[44:29] a breakthrough and when the devil will
[44:32] give up when he sees that you don't give
[44:34] up so one word from God will turn your
[44:38] situation around
[44:39] that's why it's important to come for
[44:41] services because you are energized
[44:44] yourself is you are given power to meet
[44:46] the challenge of the hour so our God is
[44:50] not dead is alive but in any situation
[44:51] in in any moment in time you must be
[44:54] able to say this is not how my story
[44:56] will end
[44:58] us expect ation no matter who had things
[45:05] sensitive all the time because this one
[45:08] thing I know he has never failed me yet
[45:11] God can turn around your situation today
[45:15] now in chapter in verse 7 the bible says
[45:20] in the 12th year of sexes
[45:22] now this is Esther's fifth anniversary
[45:26] now we think things we prepare time the
[45:28] fifth anniversary because most marriages
[45:30] are tested for five years then things
[45:32] are rose
[45:33] but now in the fifth year that's when
[45:35] Herman is now getting stronger still
[45:38] but Esther is a spiritual emergence
[45:41] your situation today is a spiritual
[45:43] emergency
[45:45] something must be done today you want to
[45:48] take the blood of Jesus and put a full
[45:50] stop to your situation and prove the
[45:53] blood of Jesus a no-flight zone of
[45:55] devils in your life
[45:57] stay positive even when it feels like
[46:00] your life is falling apart when it feels
[46:02] like God is not doing anything
[46:04] that's what he's doing is he specializes
[46:09] in things not impossible so Queen Esther
[46:12] was asked who knows people are in the
[46:15] Kingdom for such a time as this but look
[46:17] at this God uses instrumentality of man
[46:20] God could have done it all but he wanted
[46:22] Esther to do something but sometimes he
[46:26] puts situations that squeeze us to do
[46:28] something now if the greatest power of
[46:32] the bride of Christ will be during this
[46:34] quiz
[46:35] and in your life if you have a premature
[46:38] squeeze Financial or spiritually you
[46:40] pretty much want to use this Deadpool
[46:44] so this is not the book of Haman it's
[46:46] the Book of Esther you must tell the
[46:49] devil this is not true story Satan this
[46:52] is my story he probably cannot put my
[46:55] aim in my story he cannot touch anything
[46:58] that belongs to me God didn't bring you
[47:01] this far to leave to lose you and you
[47:04] must know that Lord didn't bring you
[47:06] this far God did you are not lucky to
[47:09] survive covet you're not likely to be
[47:11] alive today but God can just do it just
[47:14] like that
[47:16] it's just a small thing to God
[47:19] to deal with the matters that they've
[47:21] traveled you for 10 years
[47:22] so it is not too late not too hard for
[47:26] God it's a god of hitting around the
[47:29] Bible says mainly at the afflictions of
[47:31] the righteous but you know this word
[47:34] part is a game changer in the Bible you
[47:37] see that God
[47:40] many arrows pierce my soul but the Lord
[47:44] many are the afflictions of righteous
[47:46] but the Lord your situation is better
[47:49] but God is bigger than your situation
[47:52] Hallelujah yeah those are the times go
[47:55] for Desperate Measures
[47:56] it's not over God can flip the script
[48:03] [Music]
[48:05] child that you must face and even if you
[48:08] are standing between a rock and that
[48:10] place it's just a return strip God has
[48:12] already seen and there's free testing
[48:15] you nothing can stop your testing
[48:18] Esther felt like if I perish let me
[48:21] perish you need determination at that
[48:25] time she knew that even if she walks
[48:27] into danger the footsteps of the
[48:29] righteous are altered by God all you
[48:32] have to do is not to be statement be
[48:35] moving forward if you can't run walk if
[48:39] you can't walk Pro if you can't prone
[48:41] even wrong if you can't roll find a cat
[48:45] and then slide into your testimony
[48:49] Esther said if I perish let me perish
[48:52] but she knew something says I'm saying
[48:55] this but I'm not going to perish
[48:57] Esther was being taught to overcome your
[49:00] fears because fear not is written 365
[49:04] times in the Bible meaning every day you
[49:08] don't have anything to fear
[49:10] it is said that a child is born with
[49:12] only two fears
[49:14] fear of being dropped and fear of
[49:16] certain sounds
[49:17] all others were to learn them I don't
[49:19] know who taught us
[49:23] I only like fears that I was taught by
[49:25] Grace it was Grace that taught my eye to
[49:28] fear but embrace my fears relieved
[49:31] when we have nothing left but God we
[49:35] discover that God is enough God doesn't
[49:37] give you what we we can handle but God
[49:41] helps us to end what we are given
[49:43] so in that situation don't betray
[49:45] Heavens even the bank on you and sin
[49:48] that you are able to handle that system
[49:49] whatever you are passing through in your
[49:51] marriage God so that you are able to
[49:53] handle it there is nothing that is amiss
[49:56] brother whatever you are giving God so
[49:58] that you are able to handle it just be
[50:00] Satan of God when God shows up when God
[50:03] shows up the impossible become possible
[50:05] and you can turn a mess into a message a
[50:08] test into a testimony and trying to
[50:10] drive a victim into a victim don't be a
[50:13] victim of circumstances
[50:15] praise remove the death penalty was you
[50:17] are supposed to die so you see we are
[50:20] Mrs Jesus
[50:21] it means a lot to be Mrs Jesus if I
[50:25] introduce my wife she must be in the
[50:27] standard of who I am
[50:29] so we can't be Mrs Jesus I just say
[50:31] we're final voice we are the we are one
[50:33] in a million and being 100 million
[50:35] things are breaking down your life
[50:38] you will be coming not an ambassador of
[50:41] heaven but embarrasser of Heaven
[50:46] so God invites the bride to rule to sit
[50:50] at the throne with him so we we there
[50:53] are many people who came to be Mrs many
[50:56] churches but there's only one Mrs Jesus
[50:59] 400 virgins came and but there was one
[51:02] Esther Esther had the power to change
[51:05] the mind of the king
[51:08] that's how powerful you are as a child
[51:10] of God so you are the final voice you
[51:13] know take your perfect picture and you
[51:16] are born for such a time as this when
[51:18] God is for you it doesn't matter the
[51:22] odds that are against you you'll be
[51:23] victorious Against All Odds you only
[51:26] must know that God will do it again
[51:29] [Music]
[51:36] if he has answered you before he can
[51:38] answer you again if he has undertaken
[51:41] for you before you can undertake for you
[51:42] again our God is able remember though we
[51:46] are served and we are the servants or of
[51:48] God or soldiers or Sons and Daughters we
[51:51] are also the spouse of Christ
[51:54] they are not only just a soldier or or
[51:57] servant you are a Queen of Heaven Queen
[52:01] Esther the powers of a queen are great
[52:04] the Bible says you shall decree a thing
[52:07] and it shall be established for you and
[52:09] the light will shine in your path now we
[52:11] get to chapter five where now there is
[52:14] an open check
[52:15] there's a banquet now
[52:18] and the King invites Haman Esther is
[52:21] heavier prayer request now and God has
[52:24] given us an open check to ask everything
[52:27] that's why the king says ask to half of
[52:30] my kingdom God says ask not to half of
[52:34] my kingdom ask anything
[52:37] Hallelujah
[52:39] God can do anything anytime anywhere
[52:43] where no problem gets so heavy and you
[52:45] think there's no way through he's the
[52:46] lion that prevaileth he's the mighty
[52:49] conqueror Now esther did not just ask
[52:52] she was waiting for an atmosphere she
[52:54] just says I asked you to have a meeting
[52:57] I asked that we go for service
[53:00] but when the atmosphere was he was she
[53:02] was waiting for Spiritual signals then
[53:05] when those sickness came when the king
[53:07] could not sleep at night
[53:10] you know God was now moving elements
[53:13] she could the king could not sleep not
[53:15] because of Esther because of Esther's
[53:18] unspoken request
[53:20] your unspoken request will make God work
[53:23] on both ends
[53:25] when Esther is praying this side God is
[53:28] working on both ends when you are
[53:30] praying and saying now more than 30
[53:32] years I want a husband God will make
[53:34] that husband not sleep today
[53:42] the purpose
[53:45] there are times when things change
[53:47] overnight
[53:49] overnight
[53:51] Joseph moved from prison to the throne
[53:54] overnight Saturday Michigan moved from
[53:57] the fiery furnace to promotion overnight
[54:00] Daniel moved from the fairy from the
[54:02] Lion's Den to promotion
[54:04] things can change you know the powerful
[54:07] testimony is what has happened in our
[54:09] lives
[54:10] like this person who is preaching and
[54:12] this one could you tell is the same
[54:14] person this is me before things change
[54:17] overnight
[54:19] once I was lost this is me before Grace
[54:22] and this is me before Grace
[54:25] and also I used to to be a vendor I used
[54:28] to sell things but now I'm in the
[54:30] medical field with surgeries I've
[54:33] planted more than 36 churches
[54:35] when Grace takes The Underdogs then
[54:38] nobody God is a tendons of taking broken
[54:40] pieces to make masterpieces out of town
[54:45] what is working behind the scenes for
[54:48] his great plan so now Mordecai moves
[54:53] from being bound for colors to bring
[54:56] Bound for the throne
[54:58] multica was a security guard by the door
[55:01] little has changed to be a royal
[55:04] somebody
[55:05] but before you are royal you have to be
[55:07] loyal
[55:08] [Music]
[55:11] Esther became the messy City
[55:14] she was standing for only people like
[55:18] raps stood for all their people when you
[55:21] are convinced be concerned stand for or
[55:24] apply the token for all your people
[55:28] now we are in chapter six don't worry
[55:30] the Book of Esther is not long so we're
[55:32] about to cross so Haman and
[55:36] said
[55:38] with the man with
[55:40] the letter well now the devil can be
[55:44] used for your answer
[55:46] do you know that some of us were not
[55:48] going to see the message but the devil
[55:50] has used to make us sick and we heard
[55:52] that in the message
[55:54] when we went for a healing we said what
[55:56] is this that we are hearing when we were
[55:58] served so it was the devil's own goal
[56:01] sometimes God uses your enemy to put you
[56:04] in a prime position
[56:07] you see because your position is linked
[56:10] to your possession
[56:12] when you stand on the Promises of God
[56:14] one day is going to materialize Heavenly
[56:17] Earth can pass away but the promises
[56:18] will never pass away I would rather
[56:21] stand on the Promises of God than on the
[56:24] premises of God because the premises
[56:27] will pass away but the promises will
[56:29] never pass away
[56:31] so people may be asking why do bad
[56:35] things happen to good people wow why I'm
[56:37] believing the message I'm carrying the
[56:39] spoken word but things go bad
[56:41] it's because you are a light and you
[56:43] shine in darkness and God wants his
[56:46] grace to shine he says my strength is
[56:49] not perfect in weakness your
[56:51] breakthrough comes in the midst of his
[56:53] struggle and the things that Satan wants
[56:55] to use to destroy you God will use to
[56:57] develop us so you are not under threat
[57:00] you are the threat
[57:01] if you look at it
[57:03] Herman was not the threat Herman was
[57:06] under threat if you look at it the
[57:09] number on the highway is not the threat
[57:11] we are the threat so your attention to
[57:14] your dangers
[57:16] no
[57:18] what was meant to destroy you God will
[57:20] use it to elevate you so and sometimes
[57:23] Against All Odds and against all logic
[57:26] we still
[57:27] um believe you know I promises against
[57:30] hope he believed in hope so in the Book
[57:34] of Esther now let's get to chapter nine
[57:36] uh Esther
[57:39] um wrote with authority
[57:42] do you know what God reads what a prayer
[57:45] request that you wrote
[57:46] The God Who created your eyes can see
[57:48] right the God who created your ears came
[57:51] here you go to created your hands can't
[57:54] touch you the God who created your feet
[57:56] can walk to where you are
[57:58] so some of these prayer requests that
[58:00] you are just writing thinking one right
[58:01] no one reads one time there was a guy
[58:04] brought the letters to God sometimes you
[58:07] bring your X-ray your scan your your
[58:09] sermons God reads Esther wrote she was
[58:14] told Queen Esther right is it like at
[58:17] you
[58:18] now
[58:19] now and Esther to do a reverse order
[58:22] he says Esther came before The King and
[58:25] commanded that by the letters that the
[58:27] wicked devices which was devised against
[58:30] the Jew should return upon his own head
[58:32] so they told the devil this is a reverse
[58:36] order what I return to your personality
[58:38] go pick up on your head
[58:40] so
[58:42] um God's timing is always perfect it's
[58:44] when your enemies in your hands stress
[58:47] to Esther was told your enemies in your
[58:49] end actually in in Jeremiah I think 52
[58:53] or 25 or so it says Thy word is a better
[58:56] Acts we can destroy the Devil when God
[59:00] turns the tables
[59:02] there are two things that God does with
[59:03] temples he either tends them or prepares
[59:06] them when when you turn your worries
[59:09] into worship God will turn your battles
[59:12] into blessings you are not a warrior but
[59:16] you are alone here and if God can if God
[59:19] can turn night into day he can turn your
[59:23] patterns into blessings allow God to
[59:25] transform your obstacles into stepping
[59:27] stone there is a time when it becomes
[59:30] payback time
[59:34] nothing
[59:38] all what you've been praying for one day
[59:40] brother God will give you a good measure
[59:42] press down shaken together
[59:45] the Book of Esther became a doorway
[59:48] for Jews to return in the second return
[59:51] again for God to open a way they possess
[59:55] the Gate of the enemy the enemy must be
[59:57] your footstool the devil must not know
[59:59] what is happening financially in your
[1:00:00] life you must only know the size of your
[1:00:02] shoe it must only be under your feet
[1:00:06] so
[1:00:09] there is a time when we see that when
[1:00:12] the King was wrought them when Haman
[1:00:14] bowed for Mercy before Esther things
[1:00:18] that you fear shall bow before you every
[1:00:19] knee shall bow and every tongue shall
[1:00:21] confess now in this banquet we realized
[1:00:24] that sooner or later everyone sits at
[1:00:27] the banquet of consequences
[1:00:29] sooner or later
[1:00:31] we shall be at the banquet of the
[1:00:33] wedding that you prayed for sooner or
[1:00:35] later we shall have a banquet of your
[1:00:36] child passing the way you wanted them to
[1:00:38] pass
[1:00:39] our God is a strategist he knows how to
[1:00:42] move mountains he knows how to make what
[1:00:46] you are going through become a blessing
[1:00:48] no I want to close it because this
[1:00:50] laptop so that I can be able to close
[1:00:52] very fast now looking for at how God
[1:00:55] turns tables in the Book of Esther Our
[1:00:58] God knows you more than you know
[1:01:01] yourself
[1:01:01] he knows how to make it to time your
[1:01:04] blessing to be a greater Miracle the
[1:01:07] universe prayed for it
[1:01:08] God knows you he knows your name he
[1:01:12] knows what you are passing through he
[1:01:13] knows the number of your hair he knows
[1:01:15] your address he knows how much you can
[1:01:17] pay he knows you better than you know
[1:01:19] yourself he can walk in the midst of
[1:01:21] your life and say I know I know but then
[1:01:23] when he comes down and says Cornelius
[1:01:26] Cornelius your prayers you've come for a
[1:01:29] memorial I believe all your fastings all
[1:01:32] your prayers all your attending Services
[1:01:34] one day is going to pay you one day God
[1:01:38] will anoint you God bless you personally
[1:01:49] yeah
[1:01:51] [Applause]
[1:01:57] oh my God
[1:02:03] um
[1:02:04] [Laughter]
[1:02:09] all I can tell you is that I knew that
[1:02:12] the Lord was going to drop something on
[1:02:14] purpose for us
[1:02:16] tonight and
[1:02:18] um
[1:02:20] just when God turns the tables but uh
[1:02:23] what a a powerful thought and
[1:02:28] um you know personally things that God
[1:02:31] just spoke directly to me just
[1:02:33] encouraged me and and uh and I'm sure
[1:02:36] everybody here tonight
[1:02:38] um God had to speak to your situation
[1:02:41] they had to speak to your circumstance
[1:02:43] and I mean just so much encouragement
[1:02:46] laying in that in the story of Esther
[1:02:49] you can just like you said you won't
[1:02:51] even find the name God even in the Book
[1:02:54] of Esther but you can see all the works
[1:02:57] of God Amen in the midst of it all and
[1:03:01] whatever you're going through just know
[1:03:03] that God is in the midst of it he's
[1:03:04] working it all out amen for your good so

[1:03:11] God bless you
[1:03:15] know I'll tell you
[1:03:18] um one thing I I do realize that God
[1:03:21] makes us also different and the way that
[1:03:25] he
[1:03:26] um allows different ministers to put
[1:03:28] their thoughts together I don't think I
[1:03:30] ever saw
[1:03:32] I've seen I mean I do PowerPoint but
[1:03:35] that's PowerPoint at another level
[1:03:39] I'm telling that that's 3.0
[1:03:43] footage and I'm like what
[1:03:48] but but it just drives the point home
[1:03:50] wait
[1:03:53] and I just love it just just take his
[1:03:55] time just go right through it but every
[1:03:57] every slide got something to encourage
