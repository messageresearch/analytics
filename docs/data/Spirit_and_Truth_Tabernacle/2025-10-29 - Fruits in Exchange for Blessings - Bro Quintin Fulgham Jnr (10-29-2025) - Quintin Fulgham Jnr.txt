Lord, we realize, oh Lord God, that it's it's amazing grace, [music] oh Lord Jesus Christ. Oh Lord, it's your predestinative knowledge, oh Lord God. Your predestinative [music] uh uh love, oh Lord, that you had for us before the foundation of the world, Lord God, that we could come before you, oh Lord. [music] Oh God, to come and give you praise, oh Lord God, to know to know your mind, oh Lord, to know your [music] heart, oh Lord Jesus Christ, to know the deep things, oh Lord God, Lord, while the world, oh Lord Jesus Christ, is [music] is busy going to and fro, oh Lord God. Lord, this is your creation, oh Lord [music] God, all of these men were created in your image, oh Lord Jesus. But Lord God, you had something special for this group right here, oh Lord Jesus [music] Christ. Lord, that you would put it on our hearts, oh Lord God, to reveal yourself to us, oh Lord God. Lord, that you would be concerned for our trials, oh Lord God, our struggles, oh Lord God. Many [music] are sick and afflicted, oh Lord Jesus Christ. Many are are are dependent on a word from you, oh Lord Jesus [music] Christ. Many have been praying, oh Lord God. Many have been standing during the storm, oh Lord God. Many have been worshiping you, oh Lord God. Lord, you haven't spoke [music] a word, oh Lord Jesus Christ. But Lord, oh God, you created these people [music] with something on the inside. The prophet explained, oh the six sense, oh Lord God, [music] that oh it may it may not look like things are happening. It may not look like the situation is turning around from the physical senses, oh Lord God. Lord, we may not be able to [music] comprehend, oh Lord, the way out, oh Lord God, or the way through, oh Lord God. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; But God, you gave us this six sense down in our souls. Oh Lord God, [singing] that to say amen to the word regardless of what we can understand, oh Lord, regardless of what we can see, regardless of what we can experience or feel, oh Lord God, [music] we just want to say amen to your word, oh Lord God, for you are worthy, oh Lord Jesus Christ. [music] You left your throne on high, oh Lord God. You left your majesty to live among us, oh [music] Lord. you put this filthy skin on, oh Lord Jesus, to see our struggles, oh Lord, to feel [music] our struggles. To know what it's like, oh Lord, to get sick. To know what it's like to have financial issues, not have money, oh Lord God, to [music] know what it is to be stressed about c different things. Oh Lord God, to know what it is to face persecution, oh Lord God, Lord, you experienced all of these things, [music] oh Lord God, to be closer to us, oh Lord God. Lord, we thank you, oh Lord God. [music] Let us not take for granted the sacrifice you did, oh Lord God. And then you came back in the form of the Holy Spirit, oh Lord God. Not to dwell beside us, oh Lord God. Not to dwell [music] above us, oh Lord, but to dwell with inside of us, oh Lord Jesus Christ. So that when we would speak, it'd be just as good as if you would set it from heaven, oh Lord God. Lord, we [music] thank you, oh Lord God. Be with us in this message, oh Lord God. Touch the needs of the people, Lord. May you speak a word, oh Lord God. Amen. God bless you saints. I hope you guys have been having a wonderful week. You know, I've been going through a lot of different things recently, but um I'm learning that, you know, God's still God. You know, God is still good. You can still have joy. You know, you can still have peace. uh you can still have uh gentleness and meekness. You know, I can still go to work with a smile on my face and it just feels like everything is falling falling apart. Uh so it is a good thing to be a Christian. So we're going to start our uh reading from John chapter 15 uh verse 16 right before we uh before you get seated. And just one simple verse we're going to read here to kind of set the foundation. It says, "Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name, he may give it you." All right. So add a blessing to his word. You may take your seats. Uh so this is just a little a little message for this Wednesday. Um the Lord gave me a title uh called uh fruits in exchange for blessings, right? Uh and fruits are ve are something very very important to God. uh as we see in the uh in the Old Testament about we know we know the principles that the uh the Jewish had for uh the first fruits meaning that when you had a harvest you know these these people God's people used to be farmers and so they would go out and they would till the land and they would they would uh put down certain seeds and they would grow them and it was a lot of work that they had to do and when they got their harvest back uh you know God expected them to give him the fruit first Right? And in doing so, by giving God those first fruits, it ensured their blessings would be coming on the way. Right? So here we see God in John 15:16 establish this order uh by the word that his purpose is to make sure you bring forth fruit. &gt;&gt; Right? So God is uh a farmer himself and a gardener, right? and we are uh his seed and he wants to make sure that all of us are bearing fruit as well. Right? So first fruit then comes the blessing. So God has likened man uh like to a seed and God's purpose for a seed is two things. It's for it to grow and mature and then the second thing is after maturing it's to bear fruit and not just to bear fruit or any fruit but good fruit. Right? So, we're going to turn to Galatians uh 5 uh 22- 23 and just read a verse that we all are very very familiar with. And it reads, "But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. Against such there is no law." So these help to guide us as God seeds to know what his fruits are and what he expects to see out of us. Right? And we have to be careful though because you know trying to follow God can get a little tricky at times when you don't understand how he operates because this is all based on grace. We all sing amazing grace. It's all based on grace and fruits aren't something that you have to try to manufacture. Right? Jesus told Jesus told us in John that we didn't choose him, he chose us. Right? So that's the grace. And he not only did he chose us, he chose us to bear fruit, &gt;&gt; right? So it's his word. So the obligation then for a man is just to receive the Holy Spirit, right? Which is the seed of God, right? Because the fruits of the spirit of uh is is of course is the spirit and the seed comes from the man. And when you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit, these fruits just naturally come. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham explained it how, you know, you can't tell a crow to put peacock feathers on, right? He tries to put the peacock feathers be a peacock. It's like, no, you're not a peacock. You're trying to manufacture something that you're not. But the Bible, Jesus Christ made it imperative. He said, "Ye must be born again." &gt;&gt; Because he realized that our first birth was a wrong birth. Right? And so then by being rejuvenated and being reborn of God, you know, God is both male and female, mother and father, and has the ability to give birth to children himself. And when you are born of God, you take on the complete image of God. Right? So now you are born in his image. You are born in his likeness. And now he can talk to you. Right? So you have his you have his uh characteristics. You know, I I I have some characteristics of my mother. I have some characteristics of my father. You know, as I grow up older, a lot of times you may try to run from those characteristics, you know, because you want to be your own person. But you came from your mother and you came from your father. And sooner or later, you're going to see those attributes are going to be expressed. You may go off into the world and try to act like your act like the friends and act like try to act like so and so and act like this so- and so, but sooner or later the attributes that your mother and father deposit inside you are going to show, right? It's going and and you might try to hide behind it, but life has a way of expressing what is on the inside, which is a good thing. We want that as believers, right? Because when we get into a pinch and something really presses us down, we want to be able to have a God-sized reaction come up, right, to to guide us and lead us into these different situations. We don't want a coward reaction. So, we want to be born of the spirit because Jesus Christ, whenever a situation came his way, he mastered it completely, right? And it was an example to give for us how we should also master situations completely. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, so it's not through man's effort, right? Because a lot of times, you know, Christians get caught into this ism where it's called legalism. &gt;&gt; And it's a it's a it's a horrible, horrible spirit where it's trying it's basically a spirit that's trying to tell, you know, someone who is already a son of God how to be a son of God. Right? So it creates confusion, right? Because it's trying to tell you to do something that you already know how to do, right? But it's trying to tell you that you may be doing it incorrectly. So God doesn't want these legalistic ideas to be a part of you. Just be born again and you'll naturally just show these uh uh decisions, right? So go so God is the one that is that by his grace has ordained you to bear fruit. and all he's wanting to do is come into your life and to fulfill that promise which was his word to each and one of you personally right on a personal level. So we're going to turn to Matthew 7 and we're going to read uh verses 16 through 20 just to get a little bit more of this uh build this foundation of uh fruits. And this is also another Bible verse that, you know, were very very uh common with um seasoned saints. They're uh very very common. So it reads, "Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles? Even so, every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit." That's a really good example. like, you know, if I was if my dad, you know, my dad's very good at math, right? So, naturally, I'm going to have some math abilities inside of me, right? So, I can't if if my dad didn't have astronaut abilities, I can I can go out here and try to learn to be an astronaut all I want, right? But if those abilities weren't inside of me and deposited me, I can't show them, right? So, when you're born of God, you know, a lot of times, you know, people people get the mistake of trying not to sin. That's not the goal, right? That'll they'll they'll they'll So, and they'll make a bunch of isms saying, "Okay, well, okay, I can justify doing this thing, right? But I can't do this thing." And so, everyone is trying to now create their way of what they can and what they can do. But when you are born of the spirit of God, you won't have the desire to even want to sin, right? So, it's it's it's it's not someone trying to force you into some kind of mold. It's just something that is just naturally comes out of you, you know? Uh uh and that's the best way to live the Christian uh life because now you're happy, right? Now you have joy, you know? Can you imagine uh wanting to be saved but not have a relationship with Christ, &gt;&gt; right? So you go to heaven and it's like, okay, well, I'll stay over here. It's like, no, no, no. A Christian, they look more they look past just salvation. Like, I want to be like Jesus. wherever he is, that's where I want to be. And when you have those attributes inside of you, you'll see things from how God sees things. Right? So verse uh 19 says, "Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is heed down and cast into the fire." And uh the verse that we want to focus on is verse 20 where it says, "Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them." Right? And this is a uh uh this is a really really really good verse that we're going to try to unpack here. Uh because you know a lot of times you know people um when they're trying to live their way of what God thinks you know they'll they'll always there's a lot of phrases that a lot of people out there will kind of say and one of the phrases is only God can judge me. &gt;&gt; Right? That's one of the default phrases when people are living a life that they should not be living. Right? But they want to feel justified. They want to uh uh they want to have some kind of emotional appeal, right? So that you can kind of like feel sympathy or something like that. But in the beginning of chapter Matthew 7, you know, God said, "Judge not." So, but then he comes down in verse 12 and says, "By the fruit you shall know them." So there's a difference between judging and identification. Right? And a lot of times people get those things uh mixed up. So if I say a lemon tree is a lemon tree, I'm not judging the tree. I'm just telling you what it is, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; If I see a if I see a mango tree, if I see an orange tree, I say, "Hey, that's an orange tree. That's a mango tree." I'm not judging it. I have nothing against it. I'm just telling you the fruits that this thing is expressed. And so a lot of times people get offended in identification, but it's your identification. &gt;&gt; How can you be offended about something that you are? Right? &gt;&gt; You see, it doesn't make any sense, &gt;&gt; right? Get a new identification if you don't like the one you have, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, we we know that we have to be able to identify uh these fruits. And we also know that scripture has dual meanings uh to a lot of stuff. And you know, and I like that because fruits represent action, right? It's it doesn't represent words. Fruits are not something that is uh you talk about it or you say it or you say that you have it. Fruits are something that can be observed, right? They need no they need no one to come and uh uh it doesn't need you to say anything about it. Like you know I'm you know I have I'm a almost six feet tall, right? And I get the height from my mom's side. All my uncles are all tall. I don't have to go around saying I'm six feet tall. I'm six feet tall, right? Uh, Joe's got black hair. He doesn't have to go around confessing and professing that he has black hair. He has black hair. That's just what it is, right? And so that's what fruits are. Fruits are things that we can identify on a person without them even having to say anything, right? Which is very, very powerful because the enemy tries to trick people into thinking that they don't have what they have, &gt;&gt; right? And it's uh it's it's one of those things where you kind of have to use the word to fend them off, right? And so I like that because fruits are based on actions. And I like it because God uses that theme as a tool to uh as a tool, I guess, or a navigation system or uh an a mirror system uh to show you where you are personally at in your Christian journey. All right? Because God made the promise, you're going to bear good fruit, right? It's his promise. &gt;&gt; It's not your promise. That's the beautiful thing I love about salvation. It wasn't me looking for a father. I was always his father. I was always his son. I always belonged to God. And I'm just came on I just came on earth through uh uh through the wrong birth. And I'm just now realizing where I always was belonging, right? And I love that because it shows this just grace on God's mind that he would want to give birth and have relations with someone like me and that somebody like me who uh you know once used to be bored when I was in church when I was when I was when I was a kid growing up and I'd be falling asleep and just bored ready to go home and I because I didn't understand but as I grew spiritually I began to realize that hold on a second there's just something that's connecting with the word there's just something when I hear the word and I hear God's voice. It's just there's something connecting like, you know, there's there's certain things that I used to do in life that I just don't have any interest anymore. And there's certain things, you know, where it's kind of I get convictions when I see other people do it and I try to follow and I'm like, man, you know, they these guys can do it freely, but me, there's something blocking on the inside that I don't know what that thing is, right? And so, I love that because it's just unveiling, right? So grace is an unveiling thing of uh what and who you are as you have belonged to God. So now God knows everything right. So God knows everything. He knows the beginning from the end. He knows what stage you are in life. He knows what you need in order to progress in order to produce fruits, your maturity and the types of fruit that you need, the types of fruit that you lack. He knows all of these things. But the prophet told us that um God is a gentleman, right? So he's not an enforcer. He doesn't like to force himself on people. He's a gentleman. He's a gentle spirit. The fruit of the spirit is gentleness, right? It's not uh like a communistic where he's trying to force people to do. So he doesn't want to force you to change, right? He doesn't want to force you to bear these fruits, right? And and sometimes, you know, he may come and tell you these things that you want to do. But sometimes people don't listen to those things, right? So God has a um God has a mechanism, right? And what he does is he allows pressure to press you, right? He allow pressure from external uh forces and things to press you and compress you, right? And what that does is it makes you a witness to your own fruits and what you're bearing and what you're not bearing, right? So that it's not coming from his mouth, it's what you see, right? When you're going through a pressure and you act a certain way and you're supposed to be displaying a certain fruit, but you display another fruit, right, you in your own self know that you ain't displaying the fruit that you need to do. God doesn't have to tell you nothing. &gt;&gt; He turns you into your own witness &gt;&gt; and so you can't run from yourself, &gt;&gt; right? And I and I like that because he made the promise and God can't lie. You have to bear good fruit, right? God is not a liar, right? And so a lot of times the problem with the um with this fruit bearing process is that you know people think that they're at the stage of bearing fruit when they're actually still maturing, right? Uh and maturing of course is is is a uh is an important thing, right? And when you know where you're at in your life by revelation of God, right? or when you catch the revelation of what God says that you need to work on, then it puts you into a position where you can ask him. So now he's not forcing himself on you because you're coming to him, you're saying, "Hey, Lord, I need more love. Lord, I need more faith. Lord, you know, I need more gentleness. I need more meekness." You know, the way I handled this situation at work, you know, there's just something in me. I got in my car and I just said, I did not like the way I felt, but how I handled that. Lord, help me to be better. Lord, help me to give. Help me to have more patience. Help me to have more grace. And then you begin to ask the right questions, and God's like, "All right, that's my child. Now I can come down here and do some work." Right? All right. So, we can fulfill his word. Um um and or what it does, uh it can allow you to have a better understanding of why certain trials come your way. Because a lot of times you'll go through different things in life and you'll be asking, "Well, why is this happening to me?" And it's like just be patient, [snorts] you know, allow the pressure to to press you. Allow the situations to show you where you're at. And that's why it's important for a believer to read their Bible to assess where you're at. Right? The word always tell you uh what what you have, what fruit you have, what fruit you don't have. Right? And that's the thing I love about the Bible. And the prophet said that's something you should do all the time. Christians should always read the word so they know exactly where they're at. Right? So, um, we're going to read from the message the mighty conquerors preached in 57 just to kind of get a little bit of overview to see what kind of what the prophet said about this. Said some very profound things that we want to talk about. And while she's pulling it up, uh, it's a long, it was a long, um, long passage, so I kind of shortened it down. So, essentially, he's talking about the early church, right? the uh Paul's church and they're in the persecution uh uh persecution days where you know they've they had Pentecost filled with the Holy Ghost all the fruits are showing but now they're being persecuted by the Romans right and I'll just go ahead and start reading and it reads as I stood there my heart moved and I raised my hands up to God I said God be merciful the gladiator said thumbs down but I'm saying but I'm saying hands up raise them up oh God and triumph at the last day and what he was saying was that These early Christians, you know, the Romans would put them in a a coliseum and make them fight each other. And when they would become victorious, then this gladiator would come and would decide their fate. And if he put his thumbs down, then they killed that Christian. And if you put a thumbs up, then he let him live. So their lives were at the mercy of these Romans, right? And so, Brother Brandham continues to say, "You promised you would you would do it." that precious faith of the early church that was pure gold said the Bible tried in fire and how they would open the pits of that great arena setting like that only in the bleachers as we call it and the great massive place down there and they will burn them to the stake. They will open the trap doors and open the doors and traps of hungry lions and tigers and they would rush forth on a praying bunch of Christians and drag them from bone to bone. And the faith of those people stood firm. And I like that because God is expecting that kind of faith in the church in this age. &gt;&gt; But the problem is brother Brandham says we get a twofake and it's the end of the world, &gt;&gt; right? All of a sudden, faith is out the window, right? Some little inconvenience happens and we just throw faith out the door. And these people were were being ripped to shred by lions, right? And burned at the stake. And the Bible says that they stood firm on the word in the midst of all that that was going on, right? It makes me ashamed sometime when I think about how I act in some of my trials and I look back at that first church and these people stood in the face of persecution, right? They didn't have the luxuries that we have today and the amenities and things like that. So, um continue reading and it says, "And in the midst of all that, the church growed mightily all the time." And we here we want to focus on verse uh paragraph 20. And after Constantine come over and liberated them from under the Roman persecution and united the church and state together. And it's important for us because when you're going through a trial, right, you can't prematurely end it. &gt;&gt; You cannot prematurely end a trial. If God has a trial for you and has a it has an appointed start time and it has an appointed end time and if you prematurely stop it, it's only going to hurt you in the long run. Not only will it hurt you, but it'll hurt those that are around you because you're connected to a body. &gt;&gt; And God is depending on each piece to go through the path that it has to go. &gt;&gt; And if someone doesn't go through, we all suffer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, continuing on, it's that after constant come over and liberated them under the Roman persecution and united the church and state together. That's where we got Catholic to begin with. And when they did, the church lost more grounds in 10 years than it had gained all through the persecution. They thought they were being freed. But what it did was it pulled them further away from their identity. Brother Brandham says if there is anything that makes Christians lazy, it's when they're on a flowered bed of ease. Right? And a lot of times that's how Christians want we want things. We want things to be easy, right? We want the easy way out. We don't want to suffer. We don't want to have to go through things in order to see Christ shine in our life. We want him to shine with us with us not having to suffer. Right? And that's just not how God does things, right? So he says we don't have it persecution enough. We don't have it hard enough. Always at the chain is the strongest at his weakest length. And a man under pressure is what he is is is what is what he is when he's under pressure. His real true characteristics will show when he's under pressure. Get him all riled up, stirred up, and then you'll see the real man come out. If he's got temper, it'll show. If he's meek and gentle, it'll show itself. put him under pressure once and God puts all his children under test to see whether there's any flaws in them. Right? So God does it on purpose. &gt;&gt; Right? God does it on purpose. And when because a lot of times we say we have faith, God's like, "Okay, you got faith. &gt;&gt; All right. Send something along your way and you get a little inconvenience. Man, I just I'm just I just quit." And God's like, "I thought you said you had faith." &gt;&gt; Right? So, God does these things to help uh build our muscles, right? And you know, one of the problems that we have, especially in the message ranks, is we got so many message mystery quotas, right? People aren't born again, but they just repeat what the prophet said, which is nothing wrong with that if you have the right spirit behind it, &gt;&gt; right? Um, you know, we have people that know how to talk about the seals, right? That we have people that know how to talk about the seven thunders and the seven vows and the seven trumpets and the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the true baptism of the Holy Spirit and the the Godhead and all of these things, but mysteries don't help you to produce fruit, right? And so we have a lot of message intellectuals that can quote these things. But when it comes down to fruit, there's nothing there, &gt;&gt; right? So don't be deceived by trying to sound like a message believer. You can actually be a message believer producing fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? So mysteries don't help you to produce fruit. You can't be a good brother or sister in Christ just with mysteries. Right? And you can't raise a family with just the mysteries. &gt;&gt; And we've seen that so much in the message where, you know, you'll have fathers and they know who the prophet was and he had these healing campaigns and he had those kind of healing campaigns. But when a child is coming to the father looking for love, he doesn't have it to give. &gt;&gt; And it's like, what are we doing? We read so many message books. you've I mean you read I I remember one time uh when I first first got saved and a buddy of mine he's like man I could just read three messages every single day and I just felt so ashamed because I'm like man I need to be doing that I can't even it's a struggle for me to read one message right you know uh but but I'm kind of glad that you got to your experience has to come from Christ himself because when God calls you it's not another man calling you right and so you know you begin to meditate on these things and what's the point of understanding all the mysteries if you have no fruits to show. What's the point of going to church every single Sunday and Wednesday and fasting and communion and this meeting and you understand this talk and you know brother so and so from uh Tennessee and you know brother so and so from Arizona and you've been to uh Brandham Tabernacle and you have brother Brandham's favorite candy and you have all of these things but when it comes down to the actual life when the pressure comes right there are no fruits which means it's no image of Christ. &gt;&gt; So that means that you've missed the point somewhere, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We've missed the point somewhere, right? Um and and I and I can remember as a young uh a young believer, I had a buddy of mine told me that, hey, I'm glad you're excited that you're saved and stuff, but you know, here comes the test. And I didn't take heed to that thing because I was living on cloud nine. And it's like when you get married, you know, the honeymoon phase, you not I mean, you guys are just, you know, y'all ain't got a care in the world, right? But that's because y'all haven't applied pressure on each other. But then let time go. Let time go. Let time go. And then a little bit of pressure comes here and a little bit of pressure becomes there. And the way you looked at them is not how you looked at them when you first saw them when it was all just sitting on cloud nine. you start to notice certain habits, right? Uh and so that's why God gives you a helpmate to help you to see these things. And that's how God is with us with our relationship. So he'll allow because God's perfect. He doesn't need any work done. When he came down in flesh, he mastered life completely. So he has ability to come and get a bride and apply pressure to say, "Hold on a second, you need to work on this &gt;&gt; and hold a second, you need to work on that, and you need to work on these things." He has the right to do it because he lived the perfect life. &gt;&gt; Right? So when you get in a relationship with Christ, it's not all rainbows and sunshine, &gt;&gt; right? God expects a certain behavior from you. God expects you to conduct yourself a certain way. God expects for you to act a certain way in not just one situation, but in all situations. You know, sometimes you'll say, "Okay, yeah, well, I'll just forgive him today." And then tomorrow comes and you don't forgive him. But Peter said, "How how much should we forgive him?" And God says 70 times 70, just keep forgiving him. Right? That was the nature of the spirit that was in Christ. But Peter, though he was saved at that time, didn't have the Holy Ghost, wanted the easy way out, right? They wanted the easy way out. They want to be able to forgive one time and that's it. But no, you got to keep forgiving and keep forgiving and keep forgiving. And I didn't I didn't realize what forgiveness was until I got a little bit older. And when people do things to you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And you forgive them &gt;&gt; and then they keep doing it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And it's no longer on it's no longer about you know them and you cuz if you make it about you and them, you've lost the fight. &gt;&gt; Right. Now it's about you and God. And God's like, "How you going to act?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He done did it again. what is your decision? How do you feel about this thing? Right? And and and they said they was going to make it better, but they haven't changed. What are you going to do? Right? And God has seen these behaviors time after time with Israel. When Israel promised they would serve him, then they'd be back to idols, then they promised they would serve him, then they'd be back to idols. And every single time God was faithful, right? So God wants to see those fruits uh inside of us, right? So, you don't know what you got until God shows you what you got. The Christian life is by revelation, not intellectualism, not reading the message and reading the Bible. Oh, yeah. The Bible says I got to have love. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But let God show you what love is in your life. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So, going back to the fruits in Galatians chapter uh five, you don't have to turn to the uh the the Bible verse. There's a there's a human phenomena that we like to do. And as humans, we tend to like to rank things, right? We like to put things in a ranking, right? We like to have our favorites, right? And as Christians, believers, sometimes we can rank fruits, right? When we read the Bible and we see these things, we can try to rank the fruits and like these are my top two fruits. I like these fruits over here, right? Um and uh and we'll hyperfocus on certain fruits just to prove that we have the fruits, right? But you're not deceiving anybody because Jesus gave us the ver the Bible verse. He said, "By their fruits, you s you shall know them." So you can't deceive anybody, right? That has fruits. You'll deceive yourself, but you can't deceive anybody that has them. So when it comes to the uh fruits of the spirit, we tend to we tend to like to navigate towards love, joy, and peace, right? We tend to like these things that associate themselves with a flowery ease, right? A flowery bed of ease as the prophet has said, right? And we desire these things the most. So when someone offers you a plate of love or a plate of joy or a plate of peace, I mean, we're quick to gobble it up, right? It's you don't even have to ask a second time. You know, that's what we want. And [snorts] the problem in that thing is that, you know, we like it. We like these things based off our perception of what we want to enjoy of these fruits. But do you know that fruits were meant to be uh expressed in different ways? So we're going to turn to Revelation 10 and we're going to read verses uh 7. Revelations 10. We're going to read verses uh 7-10. says here, "But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets, and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel, which standeth upon the sea, and upon the earth." And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, "Take it and eat it, and it shall be it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth as sweet as honey." And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up, and in my mouth sweet as honey. This thing was the sweetest thing he ever he had ever eaten, right? And as soon as I eated it, my belly was bitter. So something that was a bittersweet uh um you know, experience. And we know that this represents the prophet said this represents the bride receiving the full revelation of God, right? The seed of God, right? And brother Brandham's message was given to us to point to Christ, right? To show us where he was. This is where God is. This is where God is. This is where God is. And when you have the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit points to how you should act, right? It'll lead you to all truths. This is how you should act in this situation. This is how you should act here. This is what you should say here. This is what you should say here if you're if you're if you're listening to it, you know, it's because it's the spirit that um bears the fruit. But the interesting part and the interesting part in that was when John ate the book, uh it was uh like we said, it was a sweet in his mouth, but it was bitter in his belly showing this duality, right? D uh duality. We're going to we're going to uh to better explain this concept, you know, we're going to go back to our example of when someone wants to show love, right? So they got their top fruits and they want to show love, right? They want to do it when it's easy, right? They want to do it when it's when there's a sweetness to it, right? You know, after church, everyone feels good. God bless you, brother. You know, you had a you felt good message, a message of of blessings and all that kind of stuff. You go out to eat and man, I love this brother, man. He's always We always fellowshipping and always talking and they want to love when it's easy, right? That's easy to love. That's that there's no there's no there's no there's no trouble going on. So, it's easy for you to say, "God bless you." Right, when they're doing what you want them to do or they or they're acting the way that you want them to act, right? &gt;&gt; Um, and you know, it's easy to have joy when you have a full bank account, right? Bank account is full, you know, no debts, you know, you you wake up every single morning, man. Yeah. put your savings away, you put your bill money away, and you just got a nice fat nice little sum there. You're like, man, everything is good. You know, you're not worried about what you going to eat. You're not worried about paying this bill or paying that bill. You're not worried about these things, right? So, it's easy to have joy. It's easy to say you have joy, right? You know, uh when you have a uh you got a full belly, you got food, it's easy to have to say that you got peace. like this is peaceful, man. I'm just, you know, I'm just paying my bills. I'm going to work. I'm coming home. I'm listening to worship music and everything is just good, right? It's easy uh to have these things, right? But as soon as the bank account takes a dip for the worse, you know, nobody wants to have joy anymore, right? Those gospel songs you was listening to, they ain't even playing no more. And it's like, what? you know, you was in the car going down the highway, driving 80 miles per hour, singing Maverick music, you know, but as soon as a little struggle comes, it's like just quiet. Coming home from work, just quiet in your car. And it's like, what happened? What happened? You know, you know, your joy was based off of something that it shouldn't have been based off of, &gt;&gt; right? You know, when your health when your health becomes chronic, you know, [snorts] you got all of these people on Instagram that have chronic health and they it's just it's just a woe is me video. It's just a woe is me post, you know? It's just oh, this is my life. This is how life is. And it's like it's like no more peace, right? When you're dealing with chronic stuff, it's like now you just threw the peace out the window, right? So, they want a peace that is sweet in the mouth. They want a love. People want to love that sweet in the mouth. People want enjoy that sweet in the mouth. But as soon it hits soon as things get bitter, they don't want to experience it anymore, right? And you can tell the maturity of a person in the way that they eat and what their diet is, right? That's why Paul taught us, you know, when you was a babe, I gave you milk, right? But when you become a man, I expect you to eat, you know, meat. I expect you to behave with man things. So, your diet is a a reflection of your maturity. And I remember cuz um growing up with my mother, she used to get this this cereal called Special K, right? And it had those little, you know, little flakes that ain't got no taste to them. And it had the strawberries. See, had the flakes in it. And what we would do, what I would do is I would go in there and I grab a handful, pull out all the strawberries, and then put the put the brown stuff right back inside and eat up the strawberries. So then when you when she wanted to go and get some some cereal and she poured it, it was nothing but the little brown flakes. And it's like, where'd they go? You know, but I just wanted the sweet part, right? I just wanted the sweet part, not knowing that, you know, a lot of nutrients was in the brown stuff. But I was a child. I didn't know any better. I just wanted to taste something sweet. And that's how people get with the fruits. You just want the sweet part of it, right? You just want to enjoy the sweet part of love. You just want the sweet part of joy. You just want to you want to be able to praise God when you know everything is going well, &gt;&gt; right? But that's not when fruits show the best, &gt;&gt; right? Um, but it's when things uh turn bitter, that's when uh uh uh we can really really you can really really uh enjoy God. And that's what I've come to learn is that you know in the struggle, you know, that's when God shines the brightest. You would have never known Christ was a light unless there was darkness, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You would have never known what it was like to enjoy being with a spouse if you were never lonely. You see what I'm saying? So, it's good to appreciate these moments where you don't got anything, right? Because it helps to propel you when you do get something, it helps you to enjoy that even greater. &gt;&gt; I was talking to my mother and we kind of had a discussion about, you know, going through different trials and tests. And, you know, whenever you get a cold and get a stuffy nose, I mean, your nose is just stuffed up. You're stuck in bed. You can't get up. And it's been happening for two days and then another two days and then a week has gone by and then two weeks have gone by and then finally one day something in your body just clicks, right? And that stuffiness goes away and you walk outside and you smell the fresh air. It's like, man, it ain't never smelt like that before. But that's because you were sick, right? And that was taken away from you and it allowed you to enjoy, right, the smell, right? Because a lot of times we'll take the little things for granted, right? But the storms when they come through, when the pressure comes through and when you're struggling, it helps you to once you overcome it, it helps you to appreciate the little things, the little details. God has things he wants to show you. But sometimes you're not in a position mentally enough to see it. So God's got to let you go through something, right? Sometimes the best revelation that you'll ever get is after the storm comes when Jesus was tempted on the mountain after he overcame the Bible said the angels came and ministered him right they gave him revelation right so it's always after the storm is when you get these um is when these things uh uh these fruits really feel really feel the best right so you know um now there are fruits that we don't want at All there are some fruits we don't want at all as well. Right. Right. Who wants to suffer long? Who wants longsuffering? Who here, you know, when when when we say who wants a blessing? Amen. Everybody wants a blessing. Everybody wants a double double. But when we say who wants longsuffering, who wants to suffer long? If God were to come behind the pulpit and say, "Hey guys, I need somebody to suffer long. Who wants to do it?" Right? No one wants to do that, right? Or who wants temperance? Temperance means self-control. You got to control yourself, right? Nobody wants that because people want to be able to react any old way they want to react, right? And and I'm telling you, you can be 10 years old, you can be 30 years old, you can be 70 years old, you're still a child of God, which means there's still some kind of immaturity on the inside of you, right? And God's got to deal with that thing, right? So a lot of times, you know, you know, kids want to grow up so fast. You know, you ain't escaping butt whipping because God still gives butt whoopings no matter how old you are. &gt;&gt; He doesn't stop it, right? I thought I was escaping my dad's belt only just to get a bigger belt. Because when God spanks you, you know, he don't he sometimes he don't hold back, right? When God spans you and throws some sickness on you, you be like, "Man, that belt was nice." Right? That lasted for five minutes, but you've been dealing with this thing for months, right? So, you're just a bigger kid, right? Um, so there are some fruits that we don't want to do, but we have to mature in order to want to accept these things, right? You know, it's like if you give a kid, you know, uh if you have a if you have a plate of broccoli and chicken and you have a plate of cake and cookies and you're like, "Hey, you guys can eat whichever one you want first. Them cookies will be gone in a second." Right. Right. But the problem is it leaves no room for the broccoli, right? And the broccoli has all the vitamins and minerals that you need, right? Those vitamins and minerals will give you the strength to enjoy the sweet things, right? But now you've done. So what they what uh science says is that sugar is empty calories. And what an empty calorie is is it makes you think you're full. So you have a lot of these denominational Christians get all the blessings in the world and think they full of the spirit. And it's a deception. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. It doesn't come that way. You have to go through the struggle. God's got to break you down to be a son of God and feel his spirit with you so that you're displaying every single fruit, right? Whether blessings are there or not there, God I'm still God's child. &gt;&gt; Amen. But don't don't get it twisted. God wants to bless you. &gt;&gt; That's the key thing is God wants to bless you. So we have to learn to enjoy the process of fruit bearing. It kind of reminds me of, you know, some of the women, you know, childbearing is not an easy thing to do. And, you know, you'll see mothers go through hours and hours of labor and pain and, you know, they deliver the child, two years later, they hold another baby, and they're ready to go through the process again. It's just one of those things where it's just uh it's it's a bittersweet thing where it's a lot of pain to go through, but because it produces such a beautiful thing, it makes it worth it all. And we're all fruit bearers in the spirit, right? And it takes a lot to bear fruit. It is not an easy process. But when you go through it, it's it's it's an enjoyment. It's and that's why some of the times I feel when I go through my trials, it always takes me back to Peter. He said that the trials are more precious than gold. Meaning that the trials you go through are more precious than what you're getting. Right? because you have this confidence inside of you that man, I stood, you know, when when when temptation came and when the enemy threw every single thing. I mean, he came from beneath and above and to the side, he threw that, he threw this, and I stood like God, right? It's more precious than what you could receive, right? And God wants us to uh uh understand these things. And so, like I said, God wants to bless you, though. We have to remember that God wants to bless you. And brother Jack um he talked about these things. So when God is asking you to go through a trial, what he's doing is temporarily borrowing your happiness. And brother Jack explained to us that happiness is a feeling you experience, you know, when something is happening. You know, God wants you to be happy, right? So you know how you feel when you're coming to a family dinner, right? and everyone's together and everybody's talking and you're enjoying dinner, enjoying the food, you're happy because this event is happening. God wants you to be happy, right? But when God needs to work on fruits inside, he's got to take that happiness away, right? He may take the happiness away and borrow it, but he doesn't take the joy. The joy has to stay there because it is who you are, right? And so God may temporarily borrow your health, right? God may borrow your kids. Sometimes, you know, we get upset when our kids go wayward or they backslide or certain family members, they backslide and it makes us feel alone. But God just wants to borrow them just to prove, right, that you know uh uh this person uh uh is a real Christian, right? God allowed the enemy to take Job's kids, right? But God came and gave him back to him after the test for Job, right? So God may uh temporarily borrow your financial security, right? But I like how brother Jack said whenever Jesus borrows something, he always pays it back, [snorts] &gt;&gt; right? He's not like some of these people out here, you know, these family members where, you know, they ask you for money and you don't never see him again, right? Jesus is not like that. Jesus likes to pay back. And the thing I like about Jesus is he doesn't just like to pay back in full. He likes to pay back with abundance. &gt;&gt; It's his nature, &gt;&gt; right? So, we know Jesus as the healer. And we know Jesus as the king and the provider. And we know Jesus as the comfort giver and the protector. But once you've gone through the storm, then you get to meet Jesus the investor and Jesus the banker, right? And Jesus the accountant, right? He knows how to balance the book and whatever he borrowed from you, he knows how to multiply it. He knows how to take his calculator out and just multiply that thing and just keep multiplying and multiplying, right? To give you back what you lost with interest. He interest he loves to give back overflow. And in fact, that is a law of God, right? It's a law of God that makes him who he is. Now, the law also works into the negative. And we want to see that just as a contrast. We're going to turn to uh Exodus 2 uh chapter 11. And I'll just go ahead and read read this quickly as time is winding down. And it says here, "And it came to pass in those days when Moses was grown that he went out unto his brother and looked on their burdens. And he spied on Egyptian. And he spotted an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren. And he looked this way and that way. When he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of Hebrew strove together. And he said to him that did wrong, wherefore smiteest thou thy fellow? And he said, Who made thee a prince and judge over us? That's a that's that's an interesting way to talk about God's anointed. You know, God God is trying to see you deliver. That's an interesting way to to to talk to them, right? um intendest thou to kill me as thou killedest the Egyptian? And Moses feared and said, "Surely this thing uh is known." And we're going to read in the message Respects preached in 61 and I believe it's uh paragraph uh 57 and I'll just start reading it. It says, "Then there um okay, I'll read for it. Then there is another man I like to speak of. There is a great mighty prophet by the name of Moses. The people Israel should have understood according to the scripture that God was going to deliver them and was going to bring them out of Egypt. But as soon as God got his man ready and sent him down into Egypt, they had no respects for him, they turned them out and said, "Will you slay us as you did the Egyptian?" Which caused them to stay in bondage an extra 40 years. They stayed in bondage because they refused to respect the deliverer that come to deliver them. That put them back in bondage again. Not because God wanted them to stay. The time was exactly right. But they stayed 40 years over because they refused to accept God's provided way of escape. And so I want to I want to caution us, you know, as God is going through these storms, let's not try to prematurely stop him, right? Let's not let's not try to to, you know, uh, accuse God and blame God and all of a sudden, you know, have these ill feelings against God because all it's going to do is just set you back, right? All it's going to do is cause you to suffer even more. No, let's stand as God's children. And the thing that I love about it is that when God put the test on Job, what God was saying is, "I have confidence in you." &gt;&gt; That's the best thing that you could ever hear. I mean, we live in a world where people are starving for for confidence. I mean, they're going everywhere they can to help build themselves up mentally and help to encourage themselves. But when you hear God's got confidence in you, right? Nothing's happened. No trial has started. The devil hasn't done nothing to you. No sickness has touched you. Right? Your bank account is good. I mean, nothing has come to you. But God's got confidence before even all that begins that nah, he's going to make it out of this. &gt;&gt; Right? That's what we want, right? Those are the moments where I begin to love God more because it's like, what? You got confidence in me, &gt;&gt; right? This all I'm going through, you know, mental people go through mental health issues and sickness and God's got you on the deathbed and it's like, no, I got confidence in that individual, right? Oh, it it ought to make us love God more, right? It ought to make us to trust him more, right? It ought to make us to have joy while we're going through what we're going through, right? I'm telling you, it just changes the mindset of a believer when we realize God's revelation of us, right? And so, um, and I'll go ahead and read Acts. I'll read Acts 19 just to get a little bit more. This is be the last scripture reader scripture reading. So, Acts 19, uh, I think it's, um, Acts 2 verse 19. Uh, wait, hold on one second. No, it's, uh, um, um, no, this is actually the wrong verse, but just to paraphrase, uh, Paul was just paraphrasing about what had happened with this individual, and what I wanted to show was just the compounding effect of God. Now, this individual said a statement that was less than a minute but ended up paying 40 years for that statement that he said, right? Can you imagine all the children of Israel that was ready to go? Could you imagine you being the person there and you're like, "Hold on a second. We about to, you know, deliverance is coming." And then some knucklehead comes out and tells a deliverer who you think you are trying to deliver us. If I was there, I'd be shut up. God, you ain't hear that. Just All right. Cause them to suffer 40 more years of slavery. Right, man? If you was if you was 20 years old, like, man, I'm about to go to the promised land in my youth. Now, you've got to wait till you're 40, right? I'd be upset. But it just goes to show the compounding effect of God. that little statement, &gt;&gt; that little statement that he made, God paid him back a lot more than what he thought it was. Right? So, I want to flip it back. If God cares about those little things when we give little good little things to God, he's got to pay us back more, too. Right? It's his nature. God wants to bless you more than you want to be blessed. And these little trials, and I like it because they are just little trials, &gt;&gt; right? These are just little little trials. We can't magnify these things. Uh to say there's something that they're not, right? That we would be telling a lie and we can't lie, right? So to pay back a little with a lot, the Bible uh God gives us this principle in this law how when you pay your tithes, God only asks for 10%. Right? That means if you had, you know, a hundred gold bricks, right? God just wants 10 back. God just wants you to pay 10 just a little bit, right? And he's not just going to keep it because the Bible says that, you know, when you do this thing, then I'm going to open up the windows of heaven. It don't take much to get a reaction out of God, right? And so, we have to embed this inside of us in that, you know, you might think that you're just, oh, I'm just coming to church just singing a little song. No, that little song is a lot to God, right? When you're going through your situation and you're sick and you're on your bed and you're tired and you're frustrated and your health is gone and you're and you say, "Man, all I got is a little bit of praise to God." That little bit means a lot to God, right? When you're stressed going through and you your finances, I mean, sometimes people struggle to I' I've been in situations where you struggle to find food to eat. Ramen noodles for five days in a row is not fun, right? Especially in this day and age when you have so many variety of foods and stuff and you on ramen noodles for the past month, it don't it's not it don't you don't feel happy, right? But when you can just say, you know what, you just say, you know, I'm I'm just going to bless God. All I got is, you know, bless the Lord. That little bless the Lord means a lot to God. &gt;&gt; When he hears you confess that, it means a lot to him, &gt;&gt; right? And he wants to open up the heavens to bless you. So in closing, we want to remember that it's fruits. It's the fruits first and then it's the blessing. Meaning that God doesn't want to God can bless you. I'll I'll put it this way because he loves you. God can bless you with no fruits. But then what happens is when you get the blessing is squandered, right? So, you know, when you haven't gone through financial discipline where you've where you know, you've gone through a season where you're stretching your penny, that's some good skills to learn, right? It's some good skills when you can turn $5 into two weeks of meals. I mean, that's that's I mean, hey, you get very, very creative, right? And it's good to have those skills because now when God gives you a million, now he can trust you that when he comes back, it'll be two million. It won't be less. It won't be debt. You know, God don't want to give you a million dollars and then come back and it's like you don't even have a dime to give back to him, right? No, no, no, no. Enjoy these moments, right? Enjoy these tough moments, right? They're teaching you things. They're helping you to understand, you know, because they're helping you to understand because one, you're God's child &gt;&gt; and God don't got broke children, &gt;&gt; right? God is a king, right? And and and I and I like it because it shows in the natural. If you had a son, you don't want your son just out here just living on any old way. No, no, no. You want him to have the best. And God is the same exact way with you. He wants you to have the best. He wants you to have the best health, right? He wants you to have the best finances, right? He wants you to have the best blessings. He wants you to be able to show up on work and everyone says, "Man, I want to be like this guy." &gt;&gt; All right. I remember one time when I was uh I had a buddy at my job. I wasn't serving God how I was, but I was all I was I was always uh confessing that and I remember he was a and he was a agnostic or something and he had made a comment to me. He was like, you know, if I had a son, I would want him to be just like you, right? And so that's the kind of thing that, you know, sons of gods can do. They can make unbelievers believe, &gt;&gt; right? And that's the kind of stuff that God wants to show. Oh, that's why we have these fruits because it makes things possible not just for you, but for everybody that you come in contact with. So remember that fruits ain't just for you, but it's for other people to enjoy as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? So God has to fulfill his word. He said that he would produce good fruit and it has to be good fruit. Right? And so you might have been dealing with things for a very very long time. That's why you need longsuffering, right? God has a reason for everything he's doing. And we have to remember that the Bible says he's Lord of the harvest. He knows exactly when the fruits are going to be ready. He knows exactly when the season's going to the season starts and when it ends. All he wants us to do is just lean on him and trust in him. God, richly bless you, church. [applause] &gt;&gt; And uh close it out in a word of prayer. Uh Lord Jesus Christ, we thank you oh Lord for your word, Lord. Lord, we know that it's only by revelation that we know who you are and we know who we are in you, Lord Jesus. And it's only by your grace and mercy, oh Lord God. Lord, we could read this Bible a million times. Lord, we could pray for hours upon hours, oh Lord God. Lord, we could try to do the best that we could do with sincerity, oh Lord God. But Lord, because of your grace for us, oh Lord God, you decide to unlock these things to us. Oh Lord God, you decide to show us our identity in you. Oh Lord God, that we are more than overcomers. Oh Lord God, that we were it's not us trying to get a blessing. Oh Lord God, we were always blessed. Oh Lord God, Lord, when you were in heaven, oh Lord, before the earth was created, oh Lord, before the concept of debt and money and all these things, Lord, you owned everything, oh Lord God. And Lord, we were in you, oh Lord Jesus Christ. We're not just trying to get a blessing. It's always belonged to us, oh Lord God. Help us, oh Lord, in this time period of space, oh Lord God, because we failed you as man, oh Lord God. But in this period of time, oh Lord God, we have the greatest thing we can do. We can choose to love you, oh Lord God. We can choose to show good fruit, oh Lord God, out of our own free will and thinking, oh Lord Jesus Christ, we can choose to go through the storm and still praise you, oh Lord God. When things are going wrong, we can still choose to have joy and worship you, oh Lord God. Perplexed on all side as uh as uh your prophet Paul talked about ups and downs, perplexions, famine, he said there is nothing that can separate us from your love, oh Lord Jesus Christ. So we thank you for the revelation. Be with the people, oh Lord God. Touch them and bless them. Help them in any way, oh Lord. All the needs that they have, oh Lord God. All the desires that they have, oh Lord God, all the all the prayers that they've been praying for years, oh Lord God. Lord, let them know that you still hear them. Oh Lord God, just a little bit of faith is all you're looking for us, oh Lord God. Grant it, oh Lord. Grant every request, oh Lord, in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. &gt;&gt; Uh let's give the Lord another hand clap of praise. [applause] Amen. How many are grateful for the word tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I uh I enjoy when um when brother Quinton uh preaches and I and I've told told him this before that I like how he he he lays out the word. He teaches in such a way that makes it easy for everyone to understand. And in his teachings are a lot of really good nuggets. Uh I liked when he uh when he said your diet is a reflection of your maturity. Amen. What you're eating shows us where you are. Amen. On the natural and that natural types the spiritual regardless as the prophet has told us. So when you look at what you're eating spiritually, it also reflects where you are in your spiritual maturity. Amen. And he says we shouldn't be eating empty calories. Amen. And we're thankful. We're thankful that God has allowed us to be um recipients of this revealed word because this this isn't skim milk. This isn't this isn't baby food, right? This is eagle food, right? And that's why the word says uh where where the carcass is, the eagles will gather, right? Because that's where that's where spiritually mature Christians are supposed to gather. Amen. And when we get born again, we don't we don't we don't get born again uh and become uh uh adults immediately, right? We go through a process of growing, right? But but but the word is supposed to keep uh allowing us to to feed on it so that we get to a point where we're now spiritually mature. If we remain at a place where we're still just taking skim milk and just only enjoying skimm milk, then something's wrong somewhere, right? Once you're born again, once we see a a child, when a child is born again, they they they may have milk, right? They may have uh pouches, then they get introduced to solids, right? And then they start eating certain things and as they grow, they start eating solid food, right? Real food, mature people food, right? Same thing for Christians. Once we get born again, we cannot still just rejoice on the things that people out in the world are rejoicing over, right? Those empty calories, they go to church, enjoy uh empty calories, leave the place happy, but go and live the same old life. &gt;&gt; We want to eat something that allows us to to to to really live a a a sanctified life, right? Sanctified, Holy Ghost fil life. &gt;&gt; So, we thank the Lord for for the message tonight. It's all about it's all about maturity is what he was talking about. Those fruits don't come unless that tree has matured, right? So, it's about maturity. We thank the Lord for tonight. Um, sister, if you could give me the uh the announcements. So, Oh, yes. Uh, it's Sister Shalom's birthday today. And [applause] we we we we know what we do when it's someone's birthday and we're in the house of the Lord. Amen. Happy birthday to you.
