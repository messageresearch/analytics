[6:16] also, Brother Joe Underwood reached out
[6:17] to me about a uh event that they're

[6:24] believe it's going to be like a um a
[6:27] outreach that they're doing there in
[6:29] their area. Just a a worship service
[6:31] that they're doing as an outreach. And
[6:33] uh they invited us to come. That's going
[6:35] to be August 23rd. I believe it starts
[6:38] at 6:30 uh there in uh Ocala, Florida.
[6:42] So uh I'll get the information. We'll
[6:44] put it on the on the slide there for
[6:45] you. But that's an upcoming event that
[6:48] will be happening. Also, our giving is
[6:52] multiple ways. Those that are online, we
[6:54] have Zel, we have PayPal, we have Cash
[6:56] App. Preferred method is Zel because
[6:57] they don't take fees. But if you have to
[7:00] use PayPal or Cash App, we understand.
[7:02] If you use Zel or PayPal, use giving
[7:04] atj423.org. And if you use cash app, uh,
[7:07] dollar sign spirit t. And our mailing
[7:10] address is the same there. PO Box
[7:12] 222462, West Palm Beach, Florida 33422.
[7:16] those that are in the sanctuary when
[7:17] you're going out or when you're coming
[7:20] in, there is a box on the table as
[7:22] you're leaving the sanctuary. Uh I don't
[7:25] know if it has our church name on it or
[7:27] not, but it's the wooden box that we
[7:29] always use. Uh it's there on the table.
[7:32] Make sure you use that wooden box for
[7:33] Spirit and Truth because if you put it
[7:35] in the box that's on the wall, then it
[7:37] will go to Eagle's Rest. But you want to
[7:40] make sure you use the wooden box on the
[7:41] table for uh the giving for Spirit and
[7:44] Truth tabernacle. All right, let's uh
[7:46] have a word of prayer. We want to
[7:48] remember these saints that are not
[7:49] feeling well. And if you have a request
[7:52] this morning, just signify it by the
[7:53] lifting of your hand. If it's unspoken,
[7:55] we'll remember you as well this morning.
[7:58] Let's pray. Father, we come in the name
[7:59] of Jesus. We thank you for um this
[8:04] privilege we have to come into the house
[8:06] of the Lord. We thank you for this
[8:07] opportunity we have to worship you,
[8:10] Lord, in this new location. You have
[8:13] provided a place for us, oh God, and
[8:15] we're grateful uh for your provision.
[8:18] Father, we ask that you would look upon
[8:20] the saints that are not feeling well. Um
[8:23] God, there there are many that are that
[8:25] that have reported that the enemy
[8:28] attacking their body. Precious wife,
[8:30] Sister Erica, Sister Lois, oh God, and
[8:34] uh many other saints. Oh God, sister
[8:36] capers, God, we just pray that you would
[8:38] just uh move by your spirit upon their
[8:41] bodies and that you would make them
[8:42] completely whole. And if there's anybody
[8:44] else that came to the meetings last week
[8:46] and maybe have gone back home and en
[8:48] enemies attacking them, we come against
[8:50] that devil right now in the name of
[8:52] Jesus. Uh we we proclaim victory because
[8:55] you gave that to us in the meetings, oh
[8:57] God. Father, we ask that you look upon
[8:59] the saints that have their hands lifted
[9:01] showing that they had an unspoken
[9:02] request. you know exactly what's
[9:04] underneath that hand and I ask that you
[9:05] move upon that knee, God, that you would
[9:08] just show yourself strong on their
[9:09] behalf. We're carefully give you the
[9:11] honor and the glory. Bless the offering,
[9:13] Lord, as we partake of it, Father. May
[9:15] you use this for the furtherance of your
[9:17] kingdom here on earth. It's in Jesus
[9:19] name we pray. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[9:23] Lord. Amen. So good to have um this
[9:28] morning, brother Steve uh with us uh
[9:32] from uh UK. Amen. And his precious wife
[9:35] and children. God bless you all. Amen.
[9:38] Good to have you with us. Praise God.
[9:42] Amen. He will uh be ministering for us
[9:45] uh on today. And just a few um
[9:48] housekeeping
[9:50] uh things. So, Sunday morning is really
[9:52] the only morning that we uh we have to
[9:55] have a have to be uh considerate of time
[9:58] because Eagles Rest will be coming in
[10:01] right after us to start their worship
[10:03] service. So, uh just want to ask that um
[10:07] as we when it's time for us to exit that
[10:09] we all exit uh speedily. Uh if there's
[10:12] someone that needs to use the restroom,
[10:14] we do have to clean the restroom before
[10:17] we let the other church in. Uh so if we
[10:20] if we have any that are trying to rush
[10:22] to the restroom, please do that swiftly
[10:24] so that we can clean it and make sure we
[10:26] turn it over really really nice and
[10:28] tidy. Um there's a lot of not not a lot
[10:31] of breakdown little things that we have
[10:33] to break down uh like our cameras we got
[10:36] to get out and all of that and and
[10:37] cable. So brothers if you can just pitch
[10:41] a hand wherever you can that would be
[10:42] helpful. And when we do go outside,
[10:46] um, we we we don't the one thing about
[10:48] this, we don't have to leave the
[10:50] property because in at the school we had
[10:52] to leave the property, get off the
[10:54] property. They were ready to lock up. We
[10:56] don't have to leave the property. We can
[10:57] fellowship on on the outside, but
[10:59] knowing that the other church is coming
[11:01] in, just maybe push our fellowship down
[11:03] the sidewalk a little bit so we give
[11:05] them access uh to the building. Praise
[11:08] the Lord. And I would also just request
[11:10] that when we're parking on uh on Sunday
[11:12] mornings, let's kind of leave some open
[11:16] spots so that church can have some
[11:18] openings when they come in. We don't
[11:20] have to leave them all open, but leave
[11:21] some open spots. Uh if you see my truck,
[11:24] I parked down a little further because
[11:26] we're just trying to give them some
[11:27] space that they can get in here uh for
[11:30] their service. Amen. We thank God for
[11:32] Eagles Rest. We thank them for opening
[11:34] these doors for us and um we we we we're
[11:37] happy to be in this season uh for Spirit
[11:40] and Truth, but we know God got something
[11:42] greater. And uh the one thing I was
[11:44] telling brother Troy is that I want us
[11:46] to remain a little bit uncomfortable
[11:49] because this is not our final resting
[11:52] place. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[11:57] Amen. Amen. So this morning we will uh
[12:01] prepare to welcome uh brother Steve to
[12:04] the pull pit this morning and I trust
[12:06] that uh and I know he'll be a blessing
[12:09] uh as he has been in the past. So let's
[12:11] stand to our feet. Amen. Let's prepare
[12:14] our hearts to receive the word of the
[12:17] Lord on this day
[12:21] [Music]
[12:23] like me.
[12:26] Oh,
[12:30] I
[12:34] was
[12:36] [Music]
[12:54] Let's
[12:56] say praise God. Praise God.
[13:00] Praise God.
[13:03] [Music]
[14:01] Amen.
[14:04] Praise God for sure.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. is my joy and honor to stand
[14:12] before the purchased blood of Jesus
[14:14] Christ.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; It's one thing I rever so much because
[14:20] when you are talking to the purchased
[14:22] blood of Jesus,
[14:25] you are actually touching the
[14:28] eye of the Lord.
[14:31] So I need to tread carefully
[14:34] &gt;&gt; lest I hit myself
[14:37] some kind of trouble.
[14:40] &gt;&gt; But all the same, I'm happy to be here
[14:42] this morning. I greet you all in the
[14:44] wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[14:48] who is the same yesterday, today, and
[14:50] forever.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; It's good to be associated with my
[14:54] friends.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:58] Praise be to God. What beautiful
[15:01] singing.
[15:03] Wow.
[15:04] Uh let me say I'm a man who wants to
[15:09] give flowers
[15:12] to somebody when he's still alive.
[15:16] I don't want to carry my flowers on a
[15:18] grave and say you are so much a good
[15:20] person.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; Let me say these few words. You have a
[15:25] Godgiven pastor.
[15:29] Hallelujah.
[15:31] The governments and the pew as well.
[15:36] I look at the way he does things. It
[15:39] really touches my heart. I'm not saying
[15:42] this because he's standing there.
[15:44] &gt;&gt; I will say this even when I'm in London.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; When you are given a good pastor, it
[15:53] means there is another shadow behind.
[15:57] Hallelujah.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; A man is called by his wife.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; We also want to thank sister Erica for
[16:07] standing shoulderto-shoulder
[16:09] with our precious pastor, brother Jack
[16:11] D.
[16:15] I'll tell you, you'll never get lost.
[16:18] Even per adventure, he becomes blind,
[16:20] which he's not going to be blind,
[16:22] &gt;&gt; but he'll still be leading you.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:26] We thank God for this.
[16:29] &gt;&gt; I'm happy to stand before you.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; As I have, as I have always said, I'm
[16:35] part and parcel of this church.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; I love you from the depth of my heart.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; Uh you are all my friends.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:45] &gt;&gt; And I was thinking two days ago when the
[16:48] pastor said, "Can you come and speak?"
[16:53] I said that's the right word to use.
[16:57] &gt;&gt; I'm not coming to preach.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; I'm coming to speak to the converted
[17:02] already.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; I'm coming to encourage them.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; I'm coming to say put your hand together
[17:08] with mine.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; Let's soldier on.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[17:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know these words,
[17:19] especially when I'm reading the Bible,
[17:22] when I come to a word, I analyze it
[17:26] seven times before I move on.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; God does not write has not written these
[17:31] words just for not.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; He has written them for us to understand
[17:38] &gt;&gt; and apply them upon our lives.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Before I'm taken over, let
[17:47] me just take a word of prayer.
[17:50] Precious Lord,
[17:53] thou art the Alpha and the Omega,
[17:56] the firstborn of every creation.
[18:00] Father, we thank you this morning
[18:03] for your grace and mercy that has
[18:06] brought us to this place once more.
[18:09] Lord, we have made us to claim it in the
[18:13] name of Jesus Christ.
[18:16] Father, you have not just given us this
[18:18] place as a temporary measure,
[18:23] but from the depths of my heart. Lord, I
[18:26] believe there's a purpose
[18:28] for the eagles
[18:31] to gather in this place to anoint it. Oh
[18:35] God,
[18:36] &gt;&gt; that the anointing can spread. Oh dear
[18:38] God, like you said in Psalms 133, how
[18:44] good and how pleasant it is for brethren
[18:46] to dwell together. It is like the oil
[18:49] that is put upon the head of Aaron that
[18:52] runs down through his face, through his
[18:54] beard, even unto his garments. Father,
[18:57] this garment of love, we are spreading
[18:59] it over, Lord God Almighty, to the
[19:02] inhabitants of this church and we claim
[19:05] them in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord,
[19:09] we know
[19:12] you have your own ways and we know Lord
[19:16] God Almighty, you act according to your
[19:18] own time. Let it be established in
[19:22] heaven
[19:23] &gt;&gt; even on this earth. Thus this day we
[19:26] have claimed this church. Oh dear God.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; Oh father we thank you
[19:32] Lord. I'm standing before your purchased
[19:34] blood.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; Heavenly father Lord God almighty. May
[19:38] you take me aside. Anoint these lips of
[19:42] clay until they can profess the oracles
[19:45] of heaven. May you speak to the hearts
[19:47] of your people. until they are
[19:50] convinced. Oh God, until they can say we
[19:54] want to go down and look for our own
[19:57] Goliath. My father, my savior, I thank
[20:00] you Lord God Almighty. Forgive me of all
[20:03] my mistakes, dear God. Father, may you
[20:06] anoint this little thought that I have
[20:08] this morning and may it be a blessing
[20:11] upon your people in Jesus name we pray
[20:13] and believe. Amen.
[20:18] God bless you.
[20:20] Let me just take off my jacket.
[20:40] I was actually thinking what am I going
[20:42] to share and speak to the church of the
[20:44] living God.
[20:46] I looked back at the meetings.
[20:49] I looked back on Friday.
[20:53] All these messages were coming to uplift
[20:57] &gt;&gt; and to give victory to the children of
[21:00] God.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[21:01] &gt;&gt; Then I said, Satan, I'm not going to
[21:04] spare you as well.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; I'm coming with a bomb.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; And this bomb is now the atomic bomb
[21:10] &gt;&gt; just to finish you off
[21:12] &gt;&gt; and set the church of God at liberty.
[21:17] My brother, my sister,
[21:19] &gt;&gt; the little thought that I have is
[21:21] something to equip you, something to to
[21:24] put your hands on, something to say and
[21:27] turn back and say, "On this Sunday, this
[21:30] message was preached. It has given me
[21:32] hope and encouragement to go into the
[21:35] enemy's camp and discomfort and defeat
[21:39] the devil."
[21:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; Today I've got a little sermon.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; Not that I'm restricted to time, but if
[21:57] I give it in too much measure, you might
[22:00] lose the the nuggets of it. I've just
[22:02] given a short and packaged message that
[22:06] whenever you are when you pull one the
[22:09] devil will be scared and you run away.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; Without wasting much of your time, let's
[22:14] get to my scripture readings for the
[22:16] day.
[22:19] 1 Samuel chapter 30
[22:24] verses 1-2
[22:29] and we are going to get to verse eight.
[22:32] I was jumping some verses for the
[22:33] purposes of time.
[22:38] Right.
[22:41] The Bible says,
[22:45] "And it came to pass
[22:48] when David and his men were come to
[22:50] Ziklak."
[22:51] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, I want you to
[22:54] take note of the names that God is going
[22:58] to use in these scriptures.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; Number one is Ziklag. I'm going to give
[23:03] a definition of what Ziglag is all
[23:05] about.
[23:08] And his men were come to Ziglac on the
[23:10] third day that the Amalachites
[23:13] had invaded the south and Ziglak and
[23:16] Smitt and Ziglak and burned it with fire
[23:21] &gt;&gt; and had taken the women captives.
[23:25] Hallelujah. That were within. If you
[23:28] want to provoke me, my brother, my
[23:30] sister, take my wife
[23:32] &gt;&gt; and you'll see how tall I am.
[23:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:37] and had taken the women captives that
[23:40] were with therein. They slew not any,
[23:44] either great or small, but carried them
[23:46] away and went on their way.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; My
[23:52] verse 80 says, "And David inquired at
[23:56] the Lord,
[23:58] saying, shall I pursue after this
[24:00] troop?" My brother, let me tell you one
[24:03] thing. Before you do anything in your
[24:06] life, whether it be small or big, you
[24:09] must go back to God and say, "Lord,
[24:12] shall I do this or not?"
[24:15] &gt;&gt; Although in your eyes you might be
[24:17] seeing it as a very good thing, but it
[24:19] is of
[24:22] importance to go back to God and say,
[24:24] "Lord, shall I do this or not?" This is
[24:27] what David did.
[24:29] He asked God, "Shall I pursue after this
[24:33] troop?" Despite in his heart, he knew
[24:36] his wife had been taken as well. But he
[24:39] had the audacity to go back to God and
[24:41] say, "Lord, shall I pursue?
[24:45] Shall I overtake them?" And he answered
[24:48] him,
[24:49] &gt;&gt; "Pursue,
[24:51] &gt;&gt; for thou shalt surely overtake them,
[24:55] &gt;&gt; and without fail
[24:57] &gt;&gt; recover all."
[25:02] &gt;&gt; Recover all.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; Not a little bit,
[25:07] &gt;&gt; but recover all.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; Verse 18, it says, "And David recovered
[25:12] all that the Amalachites had carried
[25:15] away. And David rescued his two wives.
[25:19] &gt;&gt; And there was nothing lacking to them.
[25:22] Neither small nor great, neither sons
[25:25] nor daughters, neither spoil nor
[25:28] anything that they had taken to them.
[25:31] David recovered all.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; My second scripture reading
[25:38] Joshua 1 verse 8-9.
[25:41] This book of the law shall not depart
[25:43] out of thy mouth,
[25:45] but thou shalt meditate therein day and
[25:48] night, that thou mayest observe to do
[25:51] according to all that is written
[25:52] therein. For then thou shalt make thy
[25:56] way prosperous, and then thou shalt have
[25:59] good success.
[26:01] Hallelujah.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; There is a common denominator in verse
[26:05] eight.
[26:06] In order for you to have good success,
[26:10] don't let this word depart out of thy
[26:12] mouth.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; You must meditate there day in day and
[26:17] night.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Wherever you are, my brother, my sister,
[26:20] you might be lacking in scriptures, but
[26:23] it is good to sing a psalm.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; Just to sing a psalm to your God to show
[26:28] your position with the words.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; Have not I commanded thee? It is a
[26:34] question mark.
[26:36] Maybe something had happened. God is
[26:39] coming back to Joshua and say, "Have not
[26:41] I commanded thee? Be strong and of good
[26:45] courage? Be not afraid?
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Neither be thou dismayed, for the Lord
[26:52] thy God is with thee, whether thousoever
[26:55] thou goest."
[26:57] &gt;&gt; Wherever you are going to go,
[27:00] &gt;&gt; God will be with you. For he has
[27:02] proclaimed in his word, I will be with
[27:05] you even unto the end of the world.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; Oh king,
[27:12] &gt;&gt; what is it that you are scared of?
[27:15] &gt;&gt; When our God has given us an assurance,
[27:17] I will be with you whether thou goest
[27:21] ever.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; We don't want to limit ourselves. The
[27:28] scriptures are there to be us
[27:30] &gt;&gt; to say wherever you are going to go,
[27:33] wherever you're going to put your foot,
[27:35] wherever you're going to put your hand,
[27:37] the Lord will be with you.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; Precious father, we have read your word.
[27:45] Lord, may you come down and anoint it.
[27:48] We give glory. We give honor unto thee.
[27:51] In the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus
[27:52] Christ, we pray and believe. Amen.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[27:59] My my my my my
[28:02] &gt;&gt; praise be to God.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Today my title is
[28:10] season recover.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; Season recover all.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; If you have lost a button, it's now time
[28:22] to say I want my button back. If you
[28:25] have lost a penny, it's now time to say,
[28:28] "I need my penny." If you have lost a
[28:31] job, you must say, "I need a job, but
[28:34] with a bit of a promotion on it." If you
[28:38] have lost a househ, you must now start
[28:40] to say, "I need my house." If you have
[28:43] lost your children, you must now start
[28:45] to say, "I need my children back." If
[28:48] you have lost a business, you must now
[28:50] start to say, "I need my business back."
[28:52] is sevenfold.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; It's time to claim to claim all my
[29:00] brother, my sister.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a season. What is a
[29:06] season? A season comes with a certain
[29:08] package. Hallelujah. Every season has
[29:12] got a package. Remember the man at the
[29:14] at the ba? Hallelujah. There it was a
[29:18] season and when the season came when
[29:21] people were supposed to jump into the
[29:23] water because he was a lame man for 38
[29:26] years others would quickly jump and take
[29:29] his place and he would say oh my lord
[29:32] why have you forsaken me? But when the
[29:36] owner of the season one day he visited
[29:39] that pool and when he visited that pool
[29:42] he looked at everybody with ailments and
[29:45] the man that was bad written and per
[29:48] adventure he stood besides him and he
[29:50] said let me just stand and ask this man
[29:53] hallelujah and he said what is your
[29:56] problem my brother he said for all the
[29:58] 30 years I've come to this pool with
[30:01] intention of jumping in but everybody
[30:03] Everybody takes time. Everybody takes
[30:07] the ability and time before I jump in.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister,
[30:14] &gt;&gt; if he knew whom he was talking to,
[30:17] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; He would have just said, "Lord,
[30:21] &gt;&gt; help me.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; My God."
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Because he the Lord Jesus Christ, he did
[30:26] not see much faith in that man.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; Then he said, "Stand up and take your
[30:31] bed and go home.
[30:33] Hallelujah.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; This man, my brother, recovered you all.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; He had plans.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; And when he stood up, he said, "The
[30:43] first thing that I'm going to do is to
[30:45] rebuild my house. The first thing that
[30:47] I'm going to do is to buy myself a car.
[30:50] The first thing that I'm going to do is
[30:52] to see that I recover everything that
[30:56] I've lost within the 38 years."
[30:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:02] My brother, it is your time.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; Don't take this message as a small
[31:07] thing.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; It is the capping message that the
[31:10] spirit and truth must adopt from this
[31:13] day.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, I'll be traveling to England. But
[31:17] remember this message that I'm preaching
[31:20] to you. It is a message that is known as
[31:23] season recover all.
[31:29] Let's just let's just uh take a look at
[31:33] what the word recovery means.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:39] Recovery
[31:41] is a dynamic process of change
[31:44] characterized by improvements.
[31:47] Hallelujah. In health,
[31:50] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; Social functioning my brother. as well
[31:54] as increases
[31:57] &gt;&gt; in wellbeing
[31:59] &gt;&gt; and purpose in life.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To find or regain possession
[32:06] of something lost or stolen
[32:09] &gt;&gt; who has stolen your things, it is none
[32:13] other than the devil.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; Maybe have lost it yourself, but you are
[32:18] saying, "Satan, I'm bringing it in your
[32:20] face. You are the one who made me to
[32:22] lose this. But I'm coming all the volume
[32:25] of the book upon the strength of the
[32:27] spoken word to recover everything. And
[32:31] by recovering, I I am improving my
[32:35] health.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; If you've got a healthy issue this
[32:41] afternoon,
[32:42] &gt;&gt; my brother, it is a now gone thing.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Social functioning. You got to end
[32:49] social function. People look at you up
[32:52] and down as if you are smelling. You are
[32:55] a child of God. You are a child of God.
[32:59] There has to be an improvement.
[33:01] Hallelujah. In your social functioning,
[33:04] even at workplaces, where you work, even
[33:08] at university, even at schools, my
[33:11] brother, my sister, you need to have an
[33:13] aura.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; An aura where people just like to be
[33:16] near you.
[33:18] Hallelujah.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It never should end there,
[33:22] my brother, my sister.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; There has to be an increase.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; In your wellbeing
[33:30] &gt;&gt; and purpose in life.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you were being looked down.
[33:36] Sometimes people were saying, "Ah, what
[33:38] can come out of this person is nothing."
[33:41] But when God comes into the recovery
[33:44] program and uplifts you and anoint you,
[33:48] then you can hear your boss say, "Let's
[33:51] hear from this sister. She has never
[33:53] spoken for a long time. Let's hear her
[33:56] input." And when you stand to give your
[33:59] input, my brother, that helps the
[34:01] company to develop. Everybody's going to
[34:04] clap hands to say, "Where were you all
[34:06] this time? We were looking for you. You
[34:10] should have spoken long back.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; You are going to find or to regain
[34:16] possession of something lost or stolen.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; I bring it to you my brother, my sister,
[34:24] &gt;&gt; this is the season.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; When the season comes for trees to lose
[34:30] their leaves,
[34:31] &gt;&gt; they drop the leaves.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; And one can look at a tree and say, "Oh
[34:35] my, I feel pity for this tree. My
[34:38] brother, my sister, that tree needs to
[34:41] lose those trees in order for it to gain
[34:44] new leaves that will produce possibly 10
[34:48] times more fruits.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my, I'm enjoying myself.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; I love this prophet, my brother, my
[34:59] sister.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; As I'm saying, my thought this morning
[35:03] is going to be centered on the above
[35:06] explanation.
[35:09] Why am I saying so my brother, my
[35:11] sister? Our prophet brother Brana
[35:14] teaches us that we were designed to be
[35:18] overcomers.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; We were designed to be overcomers.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; And don't look yourself down wherever
[35:26] you are.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't look down upon
[35:30] yourself wherever you are. Even if when
[35:33] you're going to an interview and you
[35:35] know that there are so many challenges,
[35:37] put your hand in your pocket and say,
[35:39] I've already got this job.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Put it to God's
[35:44] &gt;&gt; and you say to God, Lord, this is my
[35:47] intention and I'm being bagged it up
[35:50] with your word. I am going to get this
[35:52] job although I am actually having a
[35:56] competition with executive people.
[36:01] Yes sir.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Never look down upon yourself.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; You are competing with the chief
[36:10] executives
[36:11] &gt;&gt; and you are going there as a non entity.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; The moment you present yourself
[36:17] the moment they see your face. They are
[36:20] not physically seeing your face but they
[36:22] are seeing Jesus face.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[36:36] Brother, my prophet, brother Brana, he
[36:39] teaches us that the Bible is God in
[36:42] written form.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; How many knows that God?
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is God in written form. But
[36:48] we must be able to extract him out of
[36:52] the pages of the Bible and make him a
[36:55] living
[36:57] word again unto us. Amen.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; We just don't read the Bible as a fairy
[37:03] story.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; But we need to extract God out of him.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Remember, God does not lie. In Numbers
[37:11] 23:1 19, he said, "God is not a man that
[37:15] he should lie.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Neither a son of man that he should
[37:19] repent.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Have you heed and shall he not do it?
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Or have he spoken and shall he not make
[37:26] it good?"
[37:27] Amen.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; So whatever God has promised in his
[37:30] word, he is more than able to back it up
[37:32] this afternoon.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; I believe it is the dut of every
[37:39] Christian to consult God like I've said
[37:42] before on anything before you embark on
[37:44] it because his ways are perfect.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; We read in 2 Samuel 22 verse 31 that as
[37:51] for God his way is perfect. The word of
[37:55] the Lord is tried. He is a buckler to
[37:58] them that trust in him.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who is trusting on the Lord
[38:02] this morning?
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Who is trusting on the Lord this
[38:05] morning?
[38:06] &gt;&gt; My brother, I've got good news for you
[38:07] this morning. I am saying to you,
[38:11] when you trust on God,
[38:14] who is a buckler,
[38:16] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[38:17] &gt;&gt; to everything that you are going to do,
[38:20] you are home and dry.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Never mind about this cobalt. This code
[38:25] might be written
[38:27] sister so and so, brother so and so zero
[38:30] certain to disregard that.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; We are going into the final dying
[38:35] minutes of the game
[38:37] &gt;&gt; where we are going to introduce those
[38:39] substitutes which we call the super
[38:42] substitutes.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That super substitute is
[38:46] coming with the word of God. And when he
[38:48] gets onto the ball, they don't see how
[38:50] he's dribbling. only the way he sees it
[38:53] when he scores the ball.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about the devil.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; The devil has been instructed
[39:06] to do his duty faithfully.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; But let me bring it back to you. My
[39:12] brother, my sister, you are the main
[39:14] actor.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Where have you seen a main actor die in
[39:20] any film?
[39:22] No matter how hard surrounded he is but
[39:26] automatically he will find a way to
[39:28] wiggle out and at the end of the day the
[39:31] main actor will stand as a victor today
[39:34] you are the main actor and forever
[39:37] &gt;&gt; don't worry about what the devil is
[39:38] posting around you don't worry about
[39:41] what he's doing to your children it's on
[39:43] temporal basis my brother if that if the
[39:47] sister of that home kneels down brother
[39:49] Brham tells us matter. God honors and
[39:52] hears more from the prayer of a mother.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to provoke you mothers.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; When you see the devil try to creep into
[40:04] your children,
[40:06] &gt;&gt; it is time for you to say, "I have my
[40:08] prayer corner. I am going on my prayer
[40:10] corner."
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, to claim for my children. I'm going
[40:15] on the prayer corner to say, Satan, you
[40:17] are a liar. My brother, my sister, the
[40:20] devil is a liar.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; The devil is a liar.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; When you go on your prayer corner and
[40:27] you start to plead before God to say,
[40:29] "Lord, I dedicated this child in your
[40:33] name.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; This child was baptized in your name.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; This child received the baptism of the
[40:39] Holy Ghost in your name."
[40:41] &gt;&gt; What then is going in his life? My
[40:44] brother, the moment you say that
[40:46] &gt;&gt; and you go on your prayer corner and you
[40:50] cry before God, God is more than able to
[40:53] hear you than a minister who is on the
[40:56] desk preaching.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; It is good to be a Christian.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; It is good to be a Christian, my
[41:07] brother, my sister. Here we read in
[41:10] first Samuel. Hallelujah. We are looking
[41:15] at season recover all.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Seize and recover all.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm just going to dramatize
[41:23] a little bit and give you a bit of an
[41:25] example.
[41:27] Here we see. I want you to follow
[41:33] our first scripture reading
[41:36] &gt;&gt; concerning David.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Remember I said
[41:42] the name Zlag.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; God does not just put names for not.
[41:51] Here we see David. He was a servant of
[41:54] God.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; He was a man after God's own heart.
[41:59] coming back to the city which king Akish
[42:03] Akish was a Philistine
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Akish had granted David
[42:10] he had granted him refuge
[42:12] &gt;&gt; when he was fleeing from Saul
[42:16] &gt;&gt; look at it my brother my sister
[42:18] &gt;&gt; here is a Philistine
[42:20] &gt;&gt; giving David a city of refuge
[42:24] &gt;&gt; to hide away from Saul Wow. Wow. Wow.
[42:29] Wow. Come on, brother.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Let's see what Ziglag is all about.
[42:35] Symbolically, some interpretations.
[42:38] They view Ziklag as a symbol of God's
[42:41] faithfulness
[42:43] and the unfolding of his plans for
[42:46] David's kingdom.
[42:48] Even in a period of waiting and testing,
[42:56] &gt;&gt; David was in a period of waiting and
[42:59] testing to become the next king. Yes
[43:02] sir.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Remember it was two days. Hallelujah.
[43:08] After retaining from this victory
[43:11] of Ziglak that David received news of
[43:14] the death of Saul in a battle leading
[43:18] that led to his eventual rise to the
[43:21] throne.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Now I want to bring it back home.
[43:27] You are living in America.
[43:30] But to me, America is representing
[43:32] Ziglag.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Ziglag is a period of waiting and
[43:40] testing for you.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; It's a country for you. You are waiting
[43:46] to be tested and adopt your what?
[43:50] Hallelujah. to adopt all the things that
[43:54] we have lost as much as David did.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; David had been running away from Saul
[44:00] for so many years
[44:02] &gt;&gt; until a Philistine said, "I'll give you
[44:05] a city, a refuge city called Zlak.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Come and stay there and no one will
[44:12] touch you."
[44:13] &gt;&gt; But David was waiting.
[44:17] David was waiting to assume his kingship
[44:22] &gt;&gt; when Saul had died.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; When he was coming from the victory of
[44:28] Zlak, this is when he received news of
[44:32] the death of Saul
[44:34] &gt;&gt; and that's when he became king.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; America is representing Ziklak. God is
[44:46] waiting for your time to rise in power.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; All you need to do is go back to the
[44:51] enemy's camp.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; As much as David was doing,
[44:55] &gt;&gt; David was fighting Israel's enemies when
[44:59] he was in a foreign land given to him by
[45:03] a Philistine.
[45:05] [Music]
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; God w his wars in from Zackland. a city
[45:15] given to him by an an a king called
[45:19] Akish, a Philistine.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; They even persuaded him. And he wanted
[45:26] to go with Akish to fight the enemies of
[45:29] Akish.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Then certain individuals say, "No, no,
[45:32] no, no, no, no. Look here. This man is a
[45:34] Hebrew.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; He might turn against us.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Let him remain behind."
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and they all agreed and say
[45:43] you remain behind.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; So what I'm saying to you my brother
[45:46] this afternoon is all you need to do is
[45:49] to go back to the enemy's camp and
[45:51] fight. Get what the devil stole from
[45:54] you. Be on the offensive this morning.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Don't leave endstone unturned. You'll
[46:00] soon realize, hallelujah, your rise to
[46:03] power against the devil.
[46:08] Brother,
[46:09] &gt;&gt; this is not our homeland.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Ours is
[46:13] &gt;&gt; yonder.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; But what you need to do, my brother, my
[46:16] sister, is to show your power
[46:19] &gt;&gt; when God is with you.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; To show your power and have your own
[46:24] testimony.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Tell the devil is not going to be over
[46:28] until you win.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Adopt the stance that I had when I was a
[46:33] young boy. I never gave up on anybody
[46:36] who wanted to fight me.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; They were taking advantage of my heart.
[46:40] But when I fought, I fought like a bull.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; I was charging like a bull. If the fight
[46:45] never ended on that day, I would wake up
[46:47] the next morning and go to that person
[46:50] and knock on the door. And when he
[46:53] opened the door, I'll say, "Let's
[46:54] continue from where I last met."
[47:00] I will say let's continue from where we
[47:03] left from yesterday until I win. This is
[47:07] when I will declare it's over.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; I purposed in my life to say even if I
[47:14] lose my teeth, I will use my gum to
[47:17] bite.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; This is the same attitude that I want
[47:24] you to develop towards the devil. The
[47:26] devil is your enemy, my brother, my
[47:28] sister. You should say, Satan, I've had
[47:32] enough of you.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; I am coming to you in the name of Jesus.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Be like David of old.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; How many Davids do I have in here this
[47:43] afternoon?
[47:45] &gt;&gt; My brother, God is the one who ordains
[47:48] the food of the righteous. David one day
[47:51] he went to see what to give his brother
[47:54] some food but that was not the righteous
[47:57] intention.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; When he went there
[48:02] he came there and he said I've brought
[48:04] you some food but his eyes was not on
[48:06] the food. His eyes were on the enemy of
[48:09] the Israel.
[48:12] And he had a big man
[48:14] &gt;&gt; crawling like a lion
[48:17] &gt;&gt; despising the Jews
[48:19] &gt;&gt; and he looked at his brothers. These
[48:22] brothers were already trembling and he
[48:24] said who is that uncircumcised
[48:26] Philistine.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; And he said I feel righteous now.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; And he said God has guarded himself when
[48:35] I was heading the the sheep of my
[48:37] father. A bear come and he took one and
[48:41] I went after it. A lion came and took
[48:44] one and I went after it. And he said,
[48:46] "This testimonies,
[48:49] &gt;&gt; these testimonies will make a way for
[48:52] another testimony."
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; How many testimonies have you had in
[48:58] this church?
[48:59] &gt;&gt; How many testimonies have you had in
[49:01] this church? You take advantage of that
[49:04] testimony and say, "Lord, if you can do
[49:07] to that sister, you are more than able
[49:09] to do it on me as well."
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; When David went there, he started to
[49:17] devel some goose pimples and he was
[49:19] saying, "How can the Israelites keep
[49:23] quiet when this man is actually scolding
[49:26] the Jews?"
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[49:32] Brother,
[49:34] sometimes we are a mixed group.
[49:39] Sometimes we are a mixed group as much
[49:40] as Moses group was.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Let me just pass through some
[49:47] when we are a mixed group.
[49:49] I'm I'm directing this to the youths.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; You get involved with a lot of youths
[49:54] from other churches.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Other churches.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:59] At the churches,
[50:01] &gt;&gt; they have their own doctrine, their way
[50:04] of looking at the scripture, their way
[50:07] of believing the message.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Wake up, spirit and truth youth.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; You'll be invited.
[50:17] You are drinking lemonade.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Ah,
[50:23] &gt;&gt; why don't you top it up with a little
[50:25] bit of alcohol? The Bible said you can
[50:28] drink but don't get drunk.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Where have you seen beer
[50:33] &gt;&gt; not making you drunk?
[50:35] &gt;&gt; You are written epistles. Read of all
[50:38] men.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Written epistles. Read of all men. When
[50:45] you hear those news, turn your back and
[50:49] say the cross before me, the devil the
[50:52] world behind me.
[50:58] Hallelujah.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister,
[51:04] &gt;&gt; is not all who say Lord, Lord will enter
[51:07] the kingdom of heaven.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; There are some people,
[51:13] &gt;&gt; some wolves who are going to come in
[51:16] sheep skin.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They want to take you off
[51:20] the message.
[51:23] Be very careful, my brother, my sister.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; I'm directing this especially to the
[51:30] youth.
[51:33] No wonder why when Job
[51:37] saw his children going to party, he
[51:40] would go and kneel and pray,
[51:44] &gt;&gt; intercede
[51:46] for his children and say per adventure
[51:49] they sin against thee. Lord have mercy
[51:53] upon.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Parents,
[51:55] &gt;&gt; you have a duty
[51:57] &gt;&gt; to pray for your children.
[52:00] Despite that they have received the
[52:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost, they can get
[52:05] lost.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; When David saw Goliath, he said he's a
[52:14] good he's a good target, big as he is.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "I don't need a
[52:22] gun. I don't I just need five stones of
[52:27] faith."
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me tell you one thing.
[52:32] David picked up five stones.
[52:36] Maybe one of the stones that David
[52:38] picked had already been used by somebody
[52:42] and he tried to shoot a bed and he
[52:44] missed.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; But when it came into the hands of
[52:48] David,
[52:50] &gt;&gt; the anointed hand,
[52:53] &gt;&gt; it changed every situation.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:58] Hallelujah.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Let me bring it down to you.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; You are the anointed
[53:03] &gt;&gt; at the end times.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Whatever you touch
[53:09] &gt;&gt; becomes righteous.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Whatever you wish
[53:13] &gt;&gt; becomes righteous.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Whatever you claim
[53:17] &gt;&gt; becomes righteous.
[53:23] David took five stones
[53:25] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Lo, and behold, Goliath,
[53:29] here I come." But Saul said, "No, no,
[53:31] no, no, no, no. Come here. Let me give
[53:34] you a uniform."
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Maybe David was given the the Anglican
[53:40] uniform, the blue and white.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; He tried to walk, he couldn't walk. They
[53:45] said, "Okay, try the Methodist one, the
[53:47] red and black. He tried to walk, he
[53:50] couldn't. Then let's say, oh, let's
[53:52] bring the mother of all, the Roman
[53:54] Catholic God. Do you want a caller? They
[53:56] put the caller. David's head went down
[53:58] like this. He said, take off these
[54:00] things. They are draining my power.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Then he said, let me walk in the name of
[54:04] Jesus Christ.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Then he said to the Goliath, Goliath, do
[54:08] you see where I am?
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Then Goliath said, I see a little
[54:12] boy.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. My brother, you might
[54:16] have been despised in any situation, but
[54:19] the here comes your time of opportunity.
[54:23] Hallelujah. They might have despised you
[54:25] to say you are a Christian. You believe
[54:26] in brother Brham, he's a false man.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; He's a false he's a false prophet.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; All right.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; All right.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; My brother, the moment they start to
[54:36] scold my prophet,
[54:38] &gt;&gt; I feel pity for them
[54:41] &gt;&gt; because I remember the sister.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. who stood for the prophet
[54:47] &gt;&gt; that sister had cancer
[54:49] &gt;&gt; but he was debating with publicans and
[54:53] the publicans were saying that prophet
[54:55] is preaching he's preaching nonsense and
[54:57] this and that we don't believe then she
[54:58] said although I am sick that prophet is
[55:02] a god vindicated prophet
[55:04] &gt;&gt; rather bram had been told to tell that
[55:07] sister to organize a life because her
[55:09] life was going to end
[55:12] &gt;&gt; but an angel was sent and told to the
[55:14] sister that because you stood
[55:18] &gt;&gt; for my word, I am going to stand for
[55:21] you. The cancer is gone.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Whatever ailment you have this
[55:28] afternoon,
[55:30] &gt;&gt; be it diabetes, be it blood pressure, be
[55:34] it cancer, be it a headache, be it
[55:37] whatsoever, my brother, it is gone in
[55:40] the name of Jesus because you are
[55:43] standing for the word of God.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Remember I said my title is season
[55:54] recover.
[55:58] If you have lost a button, it's time for
[56:00] you to get your button.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; A penny, time for you to reclaim it.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever, my brother, my sister, I
[56:07] want you to declare this afternoon.
[56:11] Whatsoever you want in the name of
[56:14] Jesus.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Brother, when you declare it, put it in
[56:20] the Bible. your bless of any scripture
[56:24] you put it there and every time.
[56:29] Hallelujah.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Every time
[56:33] open your Bible,
[56:36] look at what you have declared.
[56:40] speak to your God
[56:43] &gt;&gt; to say, Lord,
[56:45] if that short man who came to preach to
[56:49] us is a liar, so let me not have my
[56:54] &gt;&gt; blessing. But if you are standing on the
[56:58] basis of the word, let me have my
[57:00] blessing
[57:02] &gt;&gt; right now. My brother,
[57:05] it can take one day. It can take two
[57:08] days. It can take a week. It can take a
[57:12] month. But God's word does not lie.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; I have seen it working.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; I have seen it working in my personal
[57:23] life.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; I have seen it working in other people's
[57:26] lives.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; When David saw the man
[57:33] He said, "Now Goliath,
[57:36] this is the end of your life."
[57:39] He took his ling and he said, "Lord, may
[57:43] you finish the job."
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; And it went tumbling. And Goliath was
[57:50] just
[57:54] a huge man. Then the stone came and was
[57:58] directed to his forehead and he fell
[58:00] down.
[58:04] Let me say
[58:08] every country has got its own
[58:11] territorial demons.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Her adventure.
[58:19] The territorial demon of this place
[58:23] is something else. I'll speak about my
[58:26] country. The territorial demon of my
[58:30] country back in England
[58:32] is of much of gay.
[58:37] Right now we are witnessing men
[58:40] with pink hair,
[58:43] short skirts. They are no longer scared.
[58:46] They walk in the streets panthering
[58:50] with a handbag. You look at him. That's
[58:54] the most disgusting
[58:59] That's the demon that has crept England
[59:02] &gt;&gt; because they have accepted it in our
[59:05] society.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; The politicians have accepted it
[59:09] &gt;&gt; because they want votes.
[59:12] Amen.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; But I say to you, my brother,
[59:21] even when that demon, if that demon is
[59:24] slaughtered the way Goliath was
[59:27] slaughtered, all the little demons will
[59:30] start to flee away.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; No wonder why the following morning,
[59:35] every little boy stood up and said, "I
[59:38] am going to look for my own Goliath."
[59:41] They were on the hunt of Goliath now
[59:44] because the main demon had been
[59:46] slaughtered.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; This can happen in this country my
[59:50] brother.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; If the main demon if you slaughter the
[59:54] main demon
[59:55] &gt;&gt; from cover to cover my brother, you can
[59:58] go out with your children and say we are
[1:00:00] looking for demons.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; We want to deal with them.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; People when you meet up people they say
[1:00:06] what are you looking for? You'll say I'm
[1:00:08] looking for demons. They'll say are you
[1:00:10] crazy? I said, "No, I'm looking for
[1:00:11] demons." Are you one of them? Because I
[1:00:13] can cast the demon out of you.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; You have the power.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; You have the authority
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; because you are a son and daughter of
[1:00:22] God. He that's in you is greater than he
[1:00:25] that is in the world.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:00:36] Let me not divert much from my my
[1:00:39] scriptures.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:45] I am saying remember the strategic
[1:00:48] importance of Ziklak.
[1:00:51] David used Ziklak as a base to launch
[1:00:54] raids and against Israel. You can still
[1:00:58] use America to launch raids. Hallelujah.
[1:01:02] which have bothered you. Hallelujah. To
[1:01:06] launch raise against your enemies.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. By so doing, you are
[1:01:11] strengthening your position
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; and your resources.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Remember, you can defeat the devil
[1:01:19] anytime,
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; any place,
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; anywhere. Be it in water, be it on the
[1:01:26] surface or airborne, you still can
[1:01:29] defeat him.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Now it is time for you, my brother, my
[1:01:34] sister,
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; to stop living under privilege.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; You must stop living under privilege.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; You must stop living under privilege.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; God, when God asks us to do something,
[1:01:53] he equip us.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; He equips us.
[1:01:57] Give me quotation 56081.
[1:02:01] The hour of God's delivery shot from a
[1:02:03] bone.
[1:02:05] Hallelujah.
[1:02:09] God sent the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:12] and put it in the hands of the church.
[1:02:16] The hour of God's deliverance to deliver
[1:02:18] from sickness.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Are we reading together? Yes.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; To deliver you from sickness,
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; from sin, from worry,
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; from trouble, from worldliness.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; You can just have a mind of just
[1:02:37] thinking about the world. I wish I could
[1:02:40] win the lottery.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; I wish I could win this.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; I wish that's a worldliness mind.
[1:02:48] God can grant you those things
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; without even going into those dirty
[1:02:53] things
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; if he's able to deliver you from
[1:02:57] sneakness
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; and from sin
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; and from worry.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; I find a lot of message believers always
[1:03:07] worrying.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; I am worried.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; I'm worried about my headache. Oh,
[1:03:12] you're now personalizing your headache.
[1:03:16] I
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; I'm worried about this. I'm worried. A
[1:03:18] wondering mind. Why should you get
[1:03:21] worried?
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; When you became a message believer, it
[1:03:25] meant that you're supposed to be at ease
[1:03:27] and relax.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; You have surrendered your life into the
[1:03:30] hands of what? God.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; And you say, "God, if you take my life
[1:03:34] or don't take my life, I don't care."
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; And also, I did not volunteer to become
[1:03:38] a Christian.
[1:03:41] It was through your love that you you
[1:03:43] projected towards me
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; and I accepted it.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; You filled me with the Holy Ghost.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; You are worried about trouble.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Ah,
[1:03:57] I left the kettle on at work. I don't
[1:04:00] know whether I find the whole place in
[1:04:01] in in in trles.
[1:04:05] God can command his angel to go and
[1:04:07] switch off that kettle during the night.
[1:04:10] Amen.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; But we have struck short of it
[1:04:16] despite God telling us and assuring us
[1:04:20] all these things through his prophet.
[1:04:22] But we have we have struck short of it.
[1:04:26] Why have we struck short of it? Give me
[1:04:28] another quotation. The next one. Why
[1:04:30] have we struck it short?
[1:04:33] Because the word has departed out of our
[1:04:36] mouths.
[1:04:38] Joshua tells us, "This book of the law
[1:04:40] shall not depart out of thy mouth."
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; The moment you come out of Israel,
[1:04:47] you'll never prosper.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Come back to the word
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; and God can start to prosper you.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; But thou shalt meditate there in day and
[1:04:58] night.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; We have put all our Bibles in the
[1:05:02] shelves and they've gathered dust.
[1:05:06] We have put all our message books in the
[1:05:08] shelf and they've gathered dust
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; and we expect God to
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; prosper you,
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; that thou mayest observe to do according
[1:05:21] to all that is written. Then for then
[1:05:24] shall for then thou shalt make thy way
[1:05:26] prosperous,
[1:05:28] and then thou shalt have good success.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Only if you come back to the word
[1:05:34] Hallelujah.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Meditate there in the word of God day
[1:05:38] and night.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's not run away from the
[1:05:42] Bible.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; The Bible teaches us that.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; There's no more time to live under
[1:05:51] privilege. If we apply the token,
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; if we apply the token, we can speak
[1:05:57] things into existence.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Speak things out of existence because we
[1:06:01] are a living Bible. Yes sir.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Next slide.
[1:06:09] A total deliverance.
[1:06:12] Hallelujah.
[1:06:14] Hallelujah.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; All Jesus works was complete.
[1:06:19] Everything was complete. Total
[1:06:22] delivered. I love this prophet.
[1:06:26] He totally delivered the leper from
[1:06:28] lepros. He totally delivered the woman
[1:06:30] with the blood issue.
[1:06:33] from your issue.
[1:06:35] What issue do you have this morning
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; that God cannot tackle?
[1:06:41] If he could actually deliver the woman
[1:06:44] of the blood issue, she had been
[1:06:46] suffering for almost 12 years.
[1:06:52] Blood is wherever she goes, all the
[1:06:54] flies were following her. Wherever she
[1:06:56] was, people were despising her. People
[1:06:59] were running away from her. But she was
[1:07:02] determined one day and she said enough
[1:07:04] is enough.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; She said if only I can hold the hem of a
[1:07:08] his garment.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; A determination.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Sometimes my brother
[1:07:18] you need to adopt an arrogant faith.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; An arrogant faith
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; to say when you're just about to do
[1:07:27] things the devil ask you why are you
[1:07:29] doing this? And you say, "So what?"
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; You need to speak back to the devil.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; God spoke back to the devils
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; when they pleaded with him to say,
[1:07:40] "Please don't cast us away. Maybe cast
[1:07:45] us into those pigs that are there. It's
[1:07:48] not yet our time.
[1:07:51] If God can speak to the devil,
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; you are a little god on this earth
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; because deity has come upon us.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Whatever you say, whatever you bind on
[1:08:04] this earth, it shall be bound in heaven.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Whatever you wish, it shall be done.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:14] He totally delivered the world from sin
[1:08:18] when he died in the day of the
[1:08:19] atonement. He totally delivered every
[1:08:21] sin. He delivered the church. So there's
[1:08:24] no need for us to live under privilege.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; There it is, my brother.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; People,
[1:08:31] there's no need for us to live in a
[1:08:33] defeated state
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; because he defeated the devil and took
[1:08:39] all the principalities and powers. Satan
[1:08:42] was pruned
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; from all the powers and subdued under
[1:08:47] his feet.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; No wonder Joshua
[1:08:53] when the walls of Jericho crumbled.
[1:08:56] There were five kings there and he took
[1:08:58] them and he hid them in a cave. He said,
[1:09:00] "I'll deal with them later."
[1:09:03] They did everything that they wanted to
[1:09:04] do. After that, then he said, "Now open
[1:09:07] the cave. Bring those five kings." And
[1:09:10] they were lined up. And Joshua took his
[1:09:12] foot
[1:09:14] and put on the neck.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "Go back to where you belong."
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; This is what you should do to the devil.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Put your foot on the neck.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Poverty,
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; you are gone.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Poverty,
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; you are gone.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Sickness,
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; you are gone.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Satan,
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; put your hands off my children. Amen.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; You are gone.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Because they have got no legal right to
[1:09:46] rule over you.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; We are Christians filled with the Holy
[1:09:50] Ghost.
[1:09:52] [Music]
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; It's not a small thing, my brother, my
[1:09:56] sister.
[1:09:58] To be filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is God.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; The word was God.
[1:10:09] The word was with God.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, when you adopt
[1:10:22] such faith, there's got to be a time
[1:10:24] when you've got to separate yourself.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; You must separate yourself between your
[1:10:30] feelings
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; and your faith.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Can I hear an amen? Amen.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Separate yourself between your feelings
[1:10:40] and your faith.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; And this is the time that we need to do
[1:10:45] that
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; because there are times when Satan puts
[1:10:49] the heat on us
[1:10:52] and we have to stop and check and ask
[1:10:54] God,
[1:10:56] Lord, do I really believe you?
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; You need to check yourself. Yes, sir.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Do I really believe in you, Lord?
[1:11:07] Because by then you are trying to say
[1:11:09] I'm ready to seal my testimony with my
[1:11:12] own life.
[1:11:14] You must defy the devil.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Defy the devil. My brother, my sister,
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; look at Mach Shadrach and Abednego.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; They said our God is able to deliver us
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; from this fairy furnace.
[1:11:32] The king wanted to burn
[1:11:34] that religion out of them. Imagine.
[1:11:38] And that's what the devil always tries
[1:11:41] to do to all of us all the time.
[1:11:44] Tries to b you up.
[1:11:47] Hallelujah.
[1:11:49] Something b you up on something make you
[1:11:52] seeker when you have been prayed for.
[1:11:54] Imagine
[1:11:55] you have been prayed for but you become
[1:11:58] more seeker.
[1:12:01] He tries to make you think you've lost
[1:12:03] your experience with God.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, he is a lie.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; When David said, "I've lost the joy of
[1:12:14] my salvation."
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; He had not lost his salvation.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; He had just lost the
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; the joy.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; You might lose your joy,
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; but you must quickly come back to God
[1:12:26] and say, "I have lost the joy of my
[1:12:28] salvation.
[1:12:31] Hallelujah.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:12:37] Shadrach,
[1:12:38] they turned their backs on the image and
[1:12:42] they said, "Our God is more than able
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; to fight for us."
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; This morning, my brother,
[1:12:50] if you mean it from the depth of your
[1:12:52] heart,
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; and say, "Satan, I know what you've been
[1:12:56] trying to do in my own life.
[1:12:59] in the life of my husband,
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; in the life of my children,
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; but I'm turning my back on you.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; You do whatsoever you want.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; But what's before me is the cross of
[1:13:11] Calvary.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; What's behind me is the worldly things.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; You have to be determined.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; You have to be determined, my brother.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; When they did that,
[1:13:25] these children were being led by a
[1:13:26] spear. Unless they want to come back,
[1:13:30] they will be
[1:13:32] pricricked.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; And the people say move.
[1:13:36] And when they were moving, Shadrech
[1:13:38] said, "Let me check on my brother." He
[1:13:41] said, "Abet,
[1:13:43] are you sure? Are you determined we are
[1:13:45] going?" Abed said, "I I'm prayed up, my
[1:13:47] brother, and I'm determined."
[1:13:50] Mach, are you ready? He said, "As long
[1:13:54] as I'm with you, my brothers, I'm
[1:13:56] determined." And they walked and they
[1:13:59] walked and they walked until they went
[1:14:03] into the very furnace. On that day, a
[1:14:07] wonder happened.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; The flames of the natural fire were
[1:14:11] turned into a shed where Mishek Shad and
[1:14:15] Aed Migo were relaxing
[1:14:18] under the shadow of the burning flames.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; This morning,
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; all your burdens
[1:14:27] All your burdens, my brother, my sister,
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; can be a shed
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; while you are putting your legs on top
[1:14:34] of your possessions.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; That's how God can do my brother, my
[1:14:40] sister.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; If Moses said, "Not even a wolf shall
[1:14:49] remain."
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Think deep, my brother, my sister. Moses
[1:14:55] is referring to an animal with a spirit
[1:14:59] without a soul.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; He is saying not even a wolf will remain
[1:15:05] behind.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; What about you, my brother, my sister?
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; You are a Holy Ghost filled son and
[1:15:12] daughter of God
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; with a living soul.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; How then can you not make it? Amen.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; How then can you not go into the enemy's
[1:15:23] camp
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; and get all what the stab has taken away
[1:15:27] from you?
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Not even a wolf shall remain.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; When do you want to go? Now
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Moses, you can leave a few men to look
[1:15:41] after. He said no way.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; We are taking our old.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; We are taking our young. Amen.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; We are taking everything that belongs to
[1:15:50] us
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; and we are going with it.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Is that your determination this
[1:15:59] afternoon?
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Parents, are is that your determination
[1:16:02] this afternoon?
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; You are going with your children.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; You are going with your old.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; You are going with your husbands.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; You are going with your wives.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:15] children.
[1:16:17] You might go out there and be
[1:16:20] mischievous,
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; but your parents have already
[1:16:26] your parents have already, let me
[1:16:28] emphasize,
[1:16:29] your parents have already prayed for
[1:16:32] you,
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Billy. Paul,
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; stand there.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Spread your arms.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; What does it represent? A cross.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Make your decision. You at Cadeshia
[1:16:45] Banner
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; take the road
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; that if you despise
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; but don't worry.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; I have already prayed for you.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; If you are going to get into heaven with
[1:17:00] one eye, so be it.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; If you're going to get to heaven with
[1:17:04] one leg, so be it.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; If you're going to get to heaven with
[1:17:08] one arm, so be it.
[1:17:13] Why?
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Because a son
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; always a son.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; We are going with everything.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Not even a wolf is remaining behind.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; What about you son and daughter of God,
[1:17:38] brother? In the millennium,
[1:17:41] they won't be making no one will be
[1:17:44] making babies.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; In the millennium,
[1:17:50] it's time to talk about the triumphs
[1:17:53] that you have done.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; You will be enjoying.
[1:17:59] So this time, it is the time for us to
[1:18:01] make our own testimonies.
[1:18:05] You are so much privileged
[1:18:08] because already you have got one
[1:18:09] testimony
[1:18:12] for you to accept this message is a
[1:18:14] testimony.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; But go out there
[1:18:20] and claim and recover everything that
[1:18:24] the devil has stolen from you.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Go out there and recover what the devil
[1:18:32] has stolen from you. Are we together my
[1:18:34] brother, my sister?
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Go out there.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; What are you recovering?
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; remember recover means it's a dynamic
[1:18:48] process
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; of change
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; characterized by improvements.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:58] improvements in your health.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; It's no longer time to say, "I've got a
[1:19:04] perennial headache. Oh, I don't have
[1:19:06] money." Oh, this and that. That language
[1:19:09] is gone. Now,
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; we are now walking into another
[1:19:12] language.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; I have everything.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Let the poor say, "I am rich."
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Let the sick say, "I am where."
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:25] The only time that you should say you
[1:19:27] don't have money is when you have got
[1:19:29] 3,000 in your pocket.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; That's when you must say, I you know, I
[1:19:34] don't have enough money. Then people
[1:19:36] say, how much do you have? I only got a
[1:19:39] bit of a change of $3,000
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; and you walk away.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; That person will come to you and say,
[1:19:49] "Ah,
[1:19:51] so how much do you want?"
[1:19:53] You tell them according to the Bible it
[1:19:56] says I must lend nations.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; You must lend the bank of America.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Because everything good belongs to you.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; You are a son and daughter of God.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; But how do you claim those things? My
[1:20:15] brother, my sister, is to go to the
[1:20:17] enemy's camp.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Be on the offensive and Satan and tell
[1:20:22] Satan, "Get this back from me.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; This one is my one. This one is my one.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; That's my health. That's my money.
[1:20:30] That's my business. Oh, that's
[1:20:32] everything. Claim everything.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, spirit and truth
[1:20:41] tabernacle.
[1:20:45] I want to leave you with a scripture.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; I don't even know whether it's on my
[1:20:52] slides.
[1:20:54] It's Isaiah 54:E1 17.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; When you want to think about me,
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; reach that that scripture.
[1:21:09] No weapon
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; that is formed against you
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; shall prosper
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; and every tongue
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; that shall rise against you
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; in judgment
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; thou shalt condemn.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; This is your inheritage
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; because you are a servant of God.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. and the righteousness
[1:21:37] is of me, sayeth the Lord.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; No weapon that is formed against thee.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; That statement is not saying a weapon is
[1:21:50] not going to be formed against you.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; A weapon will be formed against you.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But that weapon
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; shall not prosper
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; because it's coming
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; against a 2010 wall
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; which is filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? Truth and trouble.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; No weapon
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; that is formed against thee
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; shall prosper. Brother Jaf,
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; no weapon
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; that is formed against you shall prosper
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; and every time
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; every tongue
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; every time.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You must contain it.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Because you are a Holy Ghost fililled
[1:22:40] person.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; No weapon.
[1:22:50] No weapon,
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; no weapon
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; that is formed against the
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; shall prosper.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And every tongue
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; that speaks evil about you,
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; condemn me to the pits of hell,
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; condemn me to the pits of hell.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Tell the devil this afternoon,
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; I've gone to the enemy's camp
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; and I've took everything.
[1:23:18] My health has been restored.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; My money has been restored.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; My children have been restored.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; I I continuously speak about children.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; My brother,
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; what joy will it give me?
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; If when you go yonder,
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; I am found standing with my wife only.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; My wife only.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Where are the fruits of them?
[1:23:49] Do you think I'll be happy there?
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:11] The Lord allowed brother Steve
[1:24:15] to have an experience of going to the
[1:24:17] other side.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; And um when he went to the other side,
[1:24:23] he was able to look back and see his
[1:24:27] family
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; and he saw his children
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; on this side. And I believe he saw his
[1:24:32] son and and uh he had a choice whether
[1:24:35] to stay there in heaven
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; or to go back and raise his family.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; And uh he made the choice to come back
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; to raise his family.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; And um so I was just thinking there, you
[1:24:49] know, uh when he says, "What would what
[1:24:51] good would it do for me to be on the
[1:24:53] other side and make it and not see the
[1:24:55] fruits of my labor?"
[1:24:57] No, I actually came back
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; to make sure that they made it,
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; right? And and no matter what those
[1:25:05] children go through, if if God already
[1:25:07] showed him one time on that side, he saw
[1:25:09] his children, I believe he's going to
[1:25:11] show them to him again on the other
[1:25:12] side, they'll all be together.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; And I'm one that believes if God showed
[1:25:17] that to brother Steve, he has no respect
[1:25:19] of persons. He has the same feelings of
[1:25:22] regarding all of us. Even the prophet
[1:25:25] told us say what what what uh when mama
[1:25:27] would have dinner uh prepared and and
[1:25:29] she invite all the family said it just
[1:25:32] it was not the same unless all the
[1:25:34] children made it to the table.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm looking for every child
[1:25:39] to make it to the table. That heavenly
[1:25:41] table.
[1:25:43] Whatever God got to take them through,
[1:25:44] they going to make it.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; I heard the the preacher say if they
[1:25:48] have to come without one leg, they have
[1:25:49] to come without one arm, without one
[1:25:51] eye. It don't matter. Long as they make
[1:25:53] it, that's all that matters to me,
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; man. I thank God for the word season
[1:25:58] recover all.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Tell somebody, you going to
[1:26:05] recover all.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; You going to recover all.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; My God, you going to recover all.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. You going to recover
[1:26:18] all. All. All. All.
[1:26:20] [Music]
[1:26:22] My Lord, my Lord, my Lord, my Lord.
[1:26:27] I tell you, I thank God for this.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; You know, I I um I wanted to just uh
[1:26:42] just make a a quick comment. You can
[1:26:44] keep playing that softly. um think
[1:26:47] that's appropriate song, but brother
[1:26:49] brother Steve hit something for our
[1:26:52] young people and uh I was grateful uh to
[1:26:57] hear him say what he said uh because it
[1:27:01] lets me know uh that we got some other
[1:27:03] churches that believe the way we
[1:27:05] believe.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then, you know, I was um I was
[1:27:11] informed of something that happened here
[1:27:13] over our meetings. And um you know, one
[1:27:18] thing I will tell you is that every
[1:27:19] church is sovereign. And what uh pastors
[1:27:22] teach their churches, those pastors are
[1:27:24] responsible for what they teach their
[1:27:26] churches. But here at Spirit and Truth
[1:27:28] Tabernacle, I'm responsible for what I
[1:27:31] teach to you all. And um and and I am
[1:27:34] one that I do not believe that saints
[1:27:38] should drink for no occasions.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that. I don't believe
[1:27:43] that you could uh invite the prophet to
[1:27:46] your house and put a drink down in front
[1:27:49] of him and expect him to drink it.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; And then use a scripture to try to
[1:27:54] justify why you're drinking because the
[1:27:57] angel Lord told the prophet not to
[1:27:59] defile himself. Now, some would say,
[1:28:02] "Well, that was only for brother
[1:28:03] Brandham." I don't believe that, right?
[1:28:05] I believe if God, the same way I believe
[1:28:08] when brother Brandham had some pecans in
[1:28:10] his car. Amen. And uh and he told the
[1:28:14] man, "I didn't have any pecans in my
[1:28:15] car, got all the way to his destination,
[1:28:18] and when he uh unloaded the car in the
[1:28:21] trunk, he saw pecans at the bottom of
[1:28:22] all his luggage." What the prophet did
[1:28:25] was actually get back in the car, drive
[1:28:28] back to the border and actually gave the
[1:28:31] pecans to the man, reported the pecans.
[1:28:33] He didn't wait till the next day. He
[1:28:35] went right then. And I believe that that
[1:28:37] example of Christianity is something
[1:28:40] that we're supposed to follow.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I am one I I firmly believe
[1:28:47] Christians don't drink under no
[1:28:49] occasions.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Random even said it like this.
[1:28:53] He says, you know, um, in the scripture,
[1:28:56] we had different ones. They had what
[1:28:58] they call the Nazerite vow. And, uh,
[1:29:00] this was, um, Samson had a Nazerite vow.
[1:29:03] Uh, John the Baptist had a Nazerite vow.
[1:29:06] Uh, I believe Brother Brandham had that
[1:29:08] same Nazarite vow. And a Nazarite vow,
[1:29:10] you were not allowed to drink. Hello,
[1:29:13] somebody.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we also as believers carry
[1:29:16] that same Nazarite vow. It's a vow of
[1:29:19] separation from the things of the world.
[1:29:23] Hallelujah.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; I don't believe Christians should smoke.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; I don't believe Christians should drink.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; I don't believe Christians should lie.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; If we going to be Christians, be
[1:29:33] Christians.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; So, so, uh, that's what I say. So, so
[1:29:40] young people, if you ever find yourself
[1:29:42] in a situation where, uh, they pull out
[1:29:46] the drinks, you know that we don't
[1:29:48] believe that. Not at Spirit and Truth
[1:29:49] Tabernacle. And I'll tell you another
[1:29:52] thing. There was one time in the Bible,
[1:29:54] a prophet invited a group of believers
[1:29:58] to the house of the Lord. They were
[1:30:01] called the Recoites. And when they came
[1:30:03] to the house of the Lord, uh they said,
[1:30:05] "We're going to put drinks out in front
[1:30:07] of these guys." And when they put the
[1:30:09] drinks out in front of them say, "We're
[1:30:10] going to see if they're going to drink."
[1:30:11] You know, and and the record said, "No,
[1:30:13] no, no, no, no. We still standing with
[1:30:15] the words of our fathers." And our
[1:30:17] fathers promised God that they would not
[1:30:19] drink. and they were generations gone
[1:30:21] down the line and still standing with
[1:30:23] that promise.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. The prophet
[1:30:26] is not here anymore, but we're still
[1:30:28] standing underneath that same promise.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; God, we not we going to not we're not
[1:30:32] going to defile ourselves with anything.
[1:30:34] We're going to hold to this word. We got
[1:30:36] time, brothers. We got time. We're going
[1:30:38] to sing this faithful faithful faithful
[1:30:43] faithful faithful.
