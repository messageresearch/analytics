[32:29] Arizona I was there ministering in both

[32:39] Fellowship there with the church there
[32:41] amen Cedar Hills a church of the Cross
[32:44] brother the pastors brother Caleb Pettis
[32:48] amen I told him now over here in uh in
[32:51] South Florida we would say Perez amen
[32:54] but out there they say Paris amen so I'm
[32:57] learning how to you know use you know
[33:00] pronounce it the right way where I go
[33:01] you know but uh but we we had a
[33:04] wonderful time there that their theme
[33:06] for the meeting was the day I died and
[33:09] uh I said well okay now uh we can we can
[33:13] find something to work with that theme
[33:15] and you know we went back to the archive
[33:17] about 12 years ago when a man brought
[33:19] out the uh it's time for I to die amen
[33:24] and we just had a wonderful wonderful
[33:26] time of fellowship and and we made our
[33:28] way through Tucson just for a couple
[33:31] days of rest and I got into a hotel room
[33:33] and and I stayed in there pretty much
[33:36] for two days and only came out to eat
[33:39] breakfast and eat dinner and just locked
[33:42] in there and just spending time with the
[33:45] Lord and just so refreshing for me I
[33:48] needed I needed some time like that not
[33:50] not worried about work not worrying
[33:52] about nothing but just sitting there
[33:54] reading my Bible and reading other
[33:56] things and just you know just just
[33:58] locked in with God
[34:01] so I I was I was very very refreshed a
[34:05] man amen in that and I realized how
[34:08] important it is for me to probably do
[34:10] that amen a little bit more often maybe
[34:12] a couple times a year just taking Monday
[34:14] and twos and just steal away
[34:17] I used to sing that song Steal Away Home
[34:20] I ain't got long but stay here amen so
[34:25] we just appreciate that and we made our
[34:27] way up to Phoenix brother Aaron mcgarran
[34:29] you all remember him uh brother Aaron
[34:31] came here with brother Danny steaman and
[34:33] preached a few years ago and um and
[34:36] brother Aaron while he was preaching uh
[34:40] him being a lawyer
[34:42] at the end of his sermon uh he uh just
[34:46] he said I rest my case

[35:24] and singing something like that I say

[35:28] and uh we will never be the same and you
[35:31] know we we were just really just
[35:33] Reminiscing on some precious times and
[35:36] not now the Lord has called him to start
[35:37] a work there in Phoenix and
[35:40] um just some of the testimonies that
[35:42] they were sharing with me of just what
[35:43] God has done uh I was just I was just
[35:47] absolutely blown away I was refreshed
[35:49] again you know just hearing that our
[35:51] Lord is moving in a very special way
[35:54] um you know different saints that have
[35:55] come from different places to to make
[35:57] the church what it is and we had a
[35:59] wonderful time and brother uh I preached
[36:02] there on Wednesday night the Christmas
[36:04] sermon uh the attribute of Salvation and
[36:08] uh brother brother Aaron said when I
[36:10] read the scripture he said oh I know
[36:11] which way you're going he was leaning
[36:13] say but then as you start going through
[36:15] the message I say oh my goodness so I
[36:19] start leaning the other way
[36:21] I say well praise the Lord Brother he
[36:23] said he just really really enjoyed it
[36:25] and the church enjoyed amen just a
[36:27] little thought there on the attribute of
[36:29] Salvation and and on last on Friday
[36:32] night they had a couple's banquet well
[36:36] really just couples Fellowship I should
[36:38] say on the property that they have there
[36:41] um and I was just I was I was just a
[36:44] beautiful evening in Phoenix and I told
[36:46] them the only thing the reason I can't
[36:48] call it a perfect evening it's a good
[36:50] evening but the reason it's not a
[36:51] perfect evening it's because my wife is
[36:53] not here with me if my wife was here
[36:56] then it'd be a perfect evening but since
[36:58] I'm standing here alone it's not perfect
[37:00] amen but but nonetheless we enjoyed
[37:04] ourselves and uh and I had to speak
[37:06] there a man to uh to the couples just to
[37:09] kind of encourage them a little bit and
[37:11] uh just just some things that the Lord
[37:13] put in my heart
[37:15] um that I learned and then Lord showed
[37:18] me how some of these things I learned
[37:20] how they a lot even in the message so we
[37:22] was able to kind of bring that together
[37:24] and just just really have a wonderful
[37:26] time so brother Aaron sent his greetings
[37:29] to you all and I told him at some point
[37:30] in time we'll have to have them come
[37:32] back this way again amen so we thank the
[37:35] Lord let me give you today's
[37:37] announcements let me also say
[37:39] um two two things amen I don't see
[37:43] brother kwaku here but uh actually
[37:45] brother quick who was scheduled to

[38:19] hours behind out there but I was able to

[39:44] time where he was in uh take they had to
[39:46] put him in a coma for a couple days they
[39:49] couldn't figure out what was going on
[39:50] with him so they put him in a coma and
[39:52] then he had to go in dialysis for a
[39:54] couple days uh for about a month and um
[39:57] but then they released him from the
[39:59] dialysis and said everything as well and
[40:01] it back to normal routine so we thank
[40:04] the Lord for touching uh brother Anthony
[40:06] Baggs and they say this this is the
[40:09] third time God has had him very close to
[40:12] death like that but they keep bringing
[40:13] them back and they realize that there's
[40:15] a purpose for him coming amen back so we
[40:18] we just we we were happy to hear his
[40:20] voice on yesterday and just trust that
[40:22] the Lord will just continue to touch him
[40:23] he is determined to surprise us with a
[40:26] visit amen so I pray God Will Make A Way
[40:29] that he'll be able to get down here and
[40:31] just shock us amen glory to God so we
[40:35] thank the Lord our our corporate fast
[40:38] amen this is something we do as a church
[40:39] every year where we uh we just fast

[40:46] getting ready to approach the king she
[40:48] uh she said please everybody go on a
[40:50] three-day fast with me because I'm I'm
[40:52] I'm putting my life on the line here and

[40:56] corporately they fasted together and
[40:59] that's what we're doing it started today
[41:00] and like I say this is I don't like to
[41:03] dictate how you fast some might be able
[41:05] to fast at 12 o'clock some might be able
[41:07] to faster three o'clock some might be
[41:09] able to fast at six o'clock some might

[51:11] little balder
[51:13] except for you

[51:19] Florida
[51:19] where there's beautiful weather most of
[51:21] the time and we bring you greetings from
[51:24] many other places where we've been if
[51:26] you've got your Bible let's not waste
[51:29] any time turn to Luke chapter 8.
[51:31] in Luke chapter 8 is where Jesus went
[51:34] across the Sea of Galilee for one man
[51:37] right and you can read all about it now
[51:39] the Sea of Galilee is not a sea like you
[51:41] have out here it's a lake right eight by
[51:45] 13 miles
[51:47] no problem
[51:48] and um
[51:50] Jesus went across the lake
[51:53] delivered one man from many many spirits
[51:57] his name was Legion the spirits went
[52:00] into the pigs the pigs drowned in the
[52:02] sea that's right and life went on but in
[52:05] Luke chapter 8
[52:07] where we at here in verse 38
[52:12] now the man out of whom the Devils were
[52:15] Departed
[52:16] beside him that he might go with him he
[52:19] wanted to follow Jesus he wanted to
[52:20] stick with him right but Jesus sent him
[52:22] away and said hey go back to your house
[52:24] show what great things God has done unto
[52:27] you
[52:28] so the gospel is spread by people that
[52:30] know what they're talking about that
[52:31] I've had a personal experience we can't
[52:33] all sit in the boat with Jesus all right
[52:35] brother we've got to go yes sir amen and
[52:37] he went his way and published throughout
[52:39] the whole city how great things Jesus
[52:41] had done unto him and it came to pass
[52:44] that when Jesus was returned returned
[52:46] where back where he came from over there
[52:48] by Tiberius when he returned uh the
[52:52] people gladly received him for they were
[52:55] all waiting for him are you waiting for
[52:58] him today amen amen did you come just
[53:00] for the free air conditioning
[53:02] come look at the girls no come to hear
[53:06] from God okay turn over two pages to
[53:10] Luke chapter 12.
[53:13] that's the historical that we read about
[53:15] there now we're coming over here to
[53:17] their prophetic
[53:19] in 39 and 40 of chapter 12.
[53:24] we find it here real quick yes 39 and
[53:26] 40.
[53:28] and this know that if the good man of
[53:30] the house had known what hour the thief
[53:32] would come he would have watched and not
[53:35] have suffered this house to be broken
[53:37] through
[53:38] be ye therefore ready also for the son
[53:40] of man cometh in an hour that you think
[53:43] not
[53:44] so are we waiting for him or are we not
[53:47] all right you know what is our attitude
[53:49] this morning now turn over to the second
[53:51] Thessalonians
[53:53] yeah we're gonna we're Bible preachers
[53:55] we're not preaching out of the funny
[53:57] books this morning
[53:59] um
[54:00] second Thessalonians chapter 3
[54:03] and verse 1. finally Brethren prayed for
[54:07] us that the word of the Lord may have
[54:08] free course and be glorified even as it
[54:11] is with you
[54:13] and that you may be that and that we may
[54:16] be delivered from unreasonable and
[54:18] wicked man wow yeah clear back there at
[54:21] the beginning of the Gospel there was
[54:22] unreasonable people making foolish
[54:25] arguments
[54:26] and it's best just to draw a line okay
[54:28] you go that way I'll go this way wow the
[54:30] weekend for all men have not the faith
[54:33] yeah they're not all Christians and the
[54:36] Lord is faithful but the Lord is
[54:38] faithful who shall establish you and
[54:40] keep you from evil
[54:42] and we have confidence in the Lord
[54:43] touching you that you both do and will
[54:46] do the things which we command you verse
[54:49] 5 of seconds Thessalonians 3 and the
[54:52] Lord direct your hearts into the love of
[54:55] God and into the patient waiting for
[54:57] Christ
[54:58] the Holy Spirit brought you here today
[55:02] Empty Chairs don't even phase me right
[55:05] because they're either home watching TV
[55:07] or they're down at the flea market
[55:09] they're out on a boat you know but God
[55:12] sent you here yes you see so you made
[55:15] the right choice amen and are you
[55:17] expecting Jesus to say something
[55:20] that's what we come for amen he only
[55:23] comes to those that are waiting for him
[55:25] he doesn't force himself on anybody
[55:26] that's right the title today is waiting
[55:29] in love
[55:32] so pay attention we don't plan on
[55:35] repeating stuff
[55:37] let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you
[55:38] for your mercy today we thank you that
[55:41] you brought us all here to the right
[55:42] place the right time and I'm sure that
[55:45] there's something in all of this that'll
[55:47] be for each one bless each person here
[55:49] bless those that are out there on the
[55:51] internet Lord speak to them
[55:54] out there where they're listening where
[55:56] they're watching Lord we don't know
[55:58] where they are we know where these
[55:59] people are
[56:00] help us today we ask in Jesus name amen
[56:03] amen amen you may be seated
[56:07] So today we're going to preach from
[56:09] Brother randoms absolute but fair enough
[56:12] yeah mine's red and yours is probably
[56:14] black
[56:15] the holy scriptures okay amen
[56:20] now the fact is that if you do a little
[56:23] bit of research you'll find over 200
[56:24] times brother Ram says back to the word
[56:26] all right so it's not a suggestion it's
[56:29] not if you feel like it it's a command
[56:32] and so
[56:35] um I've also heard brother M say clearly
[56:38] that this Bible is our road map yes it's
[56:40] all here but it's got to be properly put
[56:43] in order we're not building an ark we're
[56:45] not you know going to traips Across the
[56:47] desert there is an exit right it takes
[56:50] the ministry of of Ephesians 4 11 and 12
[56:54] to put it in order that's right that's
[56:56] how the bride comes into Perfection so
[57:00] God sent brother Branham with the spirit
[57:02] of Elijah in a fulfillment of scriptures
[57:05] see God doesn't do things like we do if
[57:08] if uh if brother Jack's wife says you
[57:10] know I'd really like you to to paint
[57:11] this or fix this well I'll get around to
[57:14] it and you know and it never happens
[57:17] you know
[57:19] he doesn't say like you know you know
[57:21] what Adam said whenever Eve said you
[57:23] know honey that that tree's in the way
[57:24] oh yes dear let me move that for you
[57:26] that's right why didn't I think of that
[57:28] oh man but you see God has a way of
[57:30] doing things it all comes back to Holy
[57:32] Scripture amen because the promise in
[57:34] Malachi 4 says I'm going to send you
[57:36] Elijah he's going to turn your hearts
[57:38] back to the original
[57:40] so this might be important amen not when
[57:43] you feel like it right you know and and
[57:45] if you don't like the Old Testament okay
[57:46] let's go over to Matthew 17. Jesus said
[57:50] Elijah shall truly first come and
[57:53] restore all things now the disciples
[57:56] were good guys and they were the chosen
[57:58] of God but they were a little bit
[57:59] thick-headed sometimes
[58:00] oh that means John and he didn't say
[58:03] words okay y'all you'll catch it
[58:06] eventually right but uh the preacher
[58:08] says over in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 to
[58:10] everything there's a season and a time
[58:13] to every purpose under Heaven a time and
[58:17] a season for everything
[58:19] okay and that covers everything every
[58:23] detail of your individual lives
[58:25] this little boy on the front row is not
[58:27] worried about the things that you're
[58:28] worried about back there he doesn't
[58:30] worry about credit payments and if the
[58:32] car is going to start no no
[58:34] not his problem right
[58:36] let's read about lunch
[58:40] amen and I guarantee you we will be out
[58:43] before lunch
[58:44] I'm not a three-hour preacher
[58:48] I know you had some but we're not one of
[58:49] them
[58:52] so God knows all the details and it's
[58:55] all the things about your individual
[58:57] life today tomorrow through the
[59:00] resurrection and to the other side amen
[59:02] and he'll reveal to you what you need as
[59:04] you need it you see and so he knows
[59:07] exactly what the solution is to your
[59:09] problem
[59:10] it's not always a hundred thousand
[59:12] dollars no all right we go through
[59:15] trials God supplies and we move on all
[59:18] right so I'm only here to remind you we
[59:20] didn't bring any you know I don't have
[59:22] any magic nothing special we're just
[59:24] here to remind you amen and I'm not an
[59:27] Entertainer just a person to give a true
[59:29] witness amen of a mighty message
[59:32] and so we want you to you know look in
[59:34] the mirror now this mirror doesn't need
[59:36] cleaning
[59:38] your job is to put to put in the right
[59:39] position
[59:40] to see yourself
[59:43] why he provides the mirror but we got to
[59:45] get it in the right position
[59:48] I've been to Africa a few times and I
[59:50] was in a nice home one day and you know
[59:53] you're over here washing your face
[59:55] but the mirrors on this wall back here
[59:57] well that doesn't work too good right
[59:59] couldn't see the comb my hair or
[1:00:01] anything you know had to go over there
[1:00:02] but we have the mirror right here in
[1:00:05] front of us
[1:00:05] so
[1:00:07] um God is always interested also in
[1:00:10] Balance yes sir we got some nice cars
[1:00:14] out here but on every wheel there's a
[1:00:16] little bitty
[1:00:17] thing made out of lead
[1:00:19] it costs about 50 cents and without that
[1:00:21] you have a horrible ride right and so
[1:00:24] God has sent you here today to see about
[1:00:26] getting in balance and that's why that I
[1:00:29] carry this level with me
[1:00:30] and uh we'll see if there's anything to
[1:00:33] attach it to no no metal here well
[1:00:35] anyway you got the picture let's put it
[1:00:38] on something that'll stick
[1:00:41] anyway yes we must be in Balance okay
[1:00:45] now a long time ago I was married to
[1:00:49] Rebecca Branham and the Lord took her
[1:00:51] home at the end of November of 2006.
[1:00:55] so after the funeral and you know now we
[1:00:57] gotta regroup and go forward you can't
[1:01:00] stay because there's no standing still
[1:01:02] so I asked the Lord to keep me busy
[1:01:05] and keep me focused and keep me balanced
[1:01:07] amen and so there's a formula for
[1:01:10] balance yes we'll get to that later all
[1:01:13] right so pay attention
[1:01:15] so our Focus today is on waiting that's
[1:01:18] patience you know it's a bit of a
[1:01:20] foreign concept to a lot of people
[1:01:22] because we live in an instant world now
[1:01:25] you get out here on 95 and there's going
[1:01:27] to be somebody that's got a faster car
[1:01:29] than you and he's much more important
[1:01:32] those rules aren't for him all right he
[1:01:34] has to get there and he might find a
[1:01:37] tree on the way but if you just go in
[1:01:40] Balance you will get there you know
[1:01:43] and so people live in this instant world
[1:01:46] you put the pedal down it goes faster uh
[1:01:49] you know they they just are that way but
[1:01:51] as Believers that we are plugged into
[1:01:53] God's economy and with his perfect
[1:01:55] timing
[1:01:56] we are in fact waiting for the
[1:01:59] Redemption of these mortal bodies okay
[1:02:01] and we're waiting for the full salvation
[1:02:03] of our soul
[1:02:05] now we're saved by grace through faith
[1:02:08] in the atonement of Christ at Calvary
[1:02:10] that is still the gospel every day
[1:02:12] everybody
[1:02:14] it's not just the Baptist not just Billy
[1:02:16] Graham it's for you that's right and
[1:02:18] Carol what your name is or what but you
[1:02:20] must come the right direction and so
[1:02:23] we're saved by by grace through faith in
[1:02:26] the atonement of Christ but we're
[1:02:27] waiting for the completion or the
[1:02:29] closing
[1:02:31] we are Christians in progress right some
[1:02:34] are farther down the road some you know
[1:02:35] are beginning so we've got to have
[1:02:37] patience you see now David wrote over
[1:02:39] here in Psalm 62
[1:02:42] let's see 62 and verse 5 says here my
[1:02:46] soul wait thou only upon God yes for my
[1:02:50] expectation is from him he only is my
[1:02:52] rock and my salvation he is my defense I
[1:02:55] shall not be moved and God is my
[1:02:58] salvation and my glory the rock of my
[1:03:00] strength and my refuge is in God trust
[1:03:04] in him at all times you people pour out
[1:03:07] your heart before him God's their refuge
[1:03:10] for us
[1:03:12] all that you need is in the word of God
[1:03:14] Amen Okay so
[1:03:18] our only hope our own security is in God
[1:03:20] so in Romans 13 11 and knowing the time
[1:03:24] that now it's high time to wake out of
[1:03:27] sleep for now is our Salvation nearer
[1:03:30] than when we believe amen it's not
[1:03:33] completed that's at the end you know but
[1:03:36] it's nearer and while we wait we're not
[1:03:39] wondering or guessing but we're busy
[1:03:41] getting ready amen just like you had to
[1:03:43] get up at a certain time to get yourself
[1:03:46] prepared to look decent like this young
[1:03:48] man here with a nice tie and everything
[1:03:50] pretty Sharp
[1:03:52] I thank your mom and
[1:03:55] um so you have to get ready to be here
[1:03:57] on time and I congratulate you got
[1:04:00] people on time because some places you
[1:04:02] know they come dragging in 30 minutes
[1:04:04] late yes not good amen but um we're not
[1:04:07] wondering we're getting ready First
[1:04:08] Peter chapter one that the trial of your
[1:04:10] faith so your faith will be tried
[1:04:14] nobody's exempt right those are
[1:04:17] parentheses the trial of your faith
[1:04:19] being much more precious than of gold
[1:04:21] that perisheth all will be tried and
[1:04:22] fire yes so that's the parenthesis so
[1:04:24] the trial of your faith might be found
[1:04:26] unto praise and honor and Glory at the
[1:04:29] appearing of Jesus Christ whom having
[1:04:31] not seen nobody here has seen him we
[1:04:33] have the record whom have you not seen
[1:04:35] you love in whom though now you see him
[1:04:38] not yet believing you rejoice with joy
[1:04:40] unspeakable and full of Glory receiving
[1:04:43] the end of your faith even the salvation
[1:04:45] of your souls the closing is coming
[1:04:47] right we're just in the process you see
[1:04:50] in Romans chapter 8 one of my favorite
[1:04:52] chapters says we ourselves grown within
[1:04:54] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[1:04:57] wit the Redemption of our body for we
[1:04:59] are saved by hope
[1:05:01] but hope that is seen is not hope for
[1:05:03] what a man seeth why does he get hope
[1:05:05] for it but if we hope for that which we
[1:05:07] see not then we do with patients wait
[1:05:10] for it
[1:05:11] so we must be patient steady balanced
[1:05:16] moving forward
[1:05:17] so everything of value you've got to
[1:05:20] wait for it
[1:05:21] whether it's lunch whether it's finding
[1:05:23] a good coffee shop or whatever you got
[1:05:25] to wait for it as a child everything was
[1:05:28] weight
[1:05:29] my son a little bit later
[1:05:31] well we didn't know when that later was
[1:05:33] coming you said wait you know and
[1:05:36] waiting for a trip was always a
[1:05:37] challenge and then as young adults which
[1:05:40] I see a few here I used to be a young
[1:05:42] adult
[1:05:44] long time ago
[1:05:46] young adults have very little experience
[1:05:48] right okay right you were there one time
[1:05:51] yes sir yeah and so as a young adult we
[1:05:54] had lots of opinions
[1:05:57] and um we we wanted to offer advice to
[1:06:00] our mother
[1:06:03] that's good preaching big mistake
[1:06:06] she says you just wait till you have
[1:06:08] some children
[1:06:11] amen so now my dad you know he was a
[1:06:14] good Christian Baptist preacher and he
[1:06:17] said God always answers my prayers yeah
[1:06:20] it's either yes or no or wait a while
[1:06:23] all right all right so there's always an
[1:06:25] answer so
[1:06:28] um the Christian Life does not take us
[1:06:31] to perfection in this body all right now
[1:06:33] you can take all the vitamins eat all
[1:06:36] the broccoli you know stay away from
[1:06:38] chocolate stay away from all the good
[1:06:40] stuff
[1:06:41] but you got to be balanced you know so
[1:06:45] if you're never going to get to
[1:06:46] perfection in this flesh if that's what
[1:06:48] you're looking for you're the wrong
[1:06:49] church amen but we live daily amongst
[1:06:53] Sinners it's in our Dark World totally
[1:06:56] immersed in sin I mean just look at him
[1:06:58] you know you you go to the mall you see
[1:07:00] these people but we do not conform to
[1:07:02] their ways okay we don't conform to
[1:07:04] their desires we're not looking around
[1:07:06] getting nervous we're looking up okay
[1:07:09] Luke 21 28 and when these things begin
[1:07:12] to come to pass then look up
[1:07:16] lift up your head redemption's drawing
[1:07:18] nigh the world is falling apart the
[1:07:22] dollar is going to go to zero the only
[1:07:25] reason it works is because people have
[1:07:27] faith in it but when we lose faith
[1:07:30] when we lose faith in that dollar bill
[1:07:32] it's going to go to zero that's right
[1:07:34] the whole world's in chaos you see so
[1:07:37] it's really close that's why the
[1:07:39] believer with the Holy Spirit anointing
[1:07:40] in his soul can walk right through dark
[1:07:43] laodicea without damage without becoming
[1:07:46] casualty and without looking like
[1:07:48] laodicea all right
[1:07:50] hey we don't have to look like them we
[1:07:52] can look like Christians that's right
[1:07:54] amen whereas if the only has the genuine
[1:07:57] and only of God
[1:07:58] on the flesh
[1:08:01] or on his Spirit that's when the music's
[1:08:03] playing oh yeah we're in the spirit
[1:08:06] you know when the Music Stops you fall
[1:08:08] flat oh we got something to last forever
[1:08:10] you know but if that's the only Spirit
[1:08:12] you have on your flesh or on your spirit
[1:08:16] uh that person will fail miserably and
[1:08:20] end up in the hot place guaranteed amen
[1:08:23] okay so let's move ahead here
[1:08:27] um
[1:08:28] you must have the Holy Spirit of God on
[1:08:30] your soul
[1:08:31] sealed securely until the day of your
[1:08:34] Redemption so we can live here we can
[1:08:36] use the benefits the tools of laodicea
[1:08:38] and not only survive but we're destined
[1:08:41] to be more than conquerors that's right
[1:08:43] amen yes sir I'm just barely getting by
[1:08:45] you know we're Victorious laodicea
[1:08:48] Believers and when we cross over to the
[1:08:51] other side and some of you might go
[1:08:52] before I go I don't know only God knows
[1:08:55] see for every one of us there's a line
[1:08:57] in the road you will not go past that
[1:08:59] line
[1:09:01] so if you get there first they might be
[1:09:04] handing out t-shirts I don't know
[1:09:06] but it's not going to say Survivor all
[1:09:08] right
[1:09:12] okay who's in charge of that couldn't
[1:09:14] you hear back there
[1:09:15] no we got it you got it okay
[1:09:19] um but it's not going to say Survivor
[1:09:21] it's going to say Overcomer right right
[1:09:24] man that's right you know there's these
[1:09:26] these competition they call boxing which
[1:09:28] is really kind of a little game they put
[1:09:30] on but there's only one winner
[1:09:33] right the other guy he's flat too bad so
[1:09:36] so the winner he gets the big Buckle
[1:09:37] that's right he gets the check he's the
[1:09:39] Overcomer amen but when he gives a check
[1:09:41] to his wife she's more
[1:09:44] and we have the benefits
[1:09:47] now I got a friend out west and uh he's
[1:09:51] a preacher so you know you've got to be
[1:09:53] careful when you give the creature a
[1:09:54] microphone you know
[1:09:57] so he says he dreamed that he got to
[1:10:00] heaven and he's walking around now short
[1:10:03] people usually look for somebody just a
[1:10:05] little bit shorter to talk to they don't
[1:10:07] look around they're not looking for
[1:10:09] somebody taller yes and so he's walking
[1:10:12] around he found somebody a little bit
[1:10:13] shorter so he's talking to him and um
[1:10:16] and so the the shorter brother said oh
[1:10:18] uh where are you from well sir I'm from
[1:10:21] wow somebody actually made it from
[1:10:23] Leticia man tell me about it so being a
[1:10:26] preacher he had the microphone so he
[1:10:28] goes on and on and tell them all about
[1:10:30] you know laodicea and all the trials and
[1:10:32] everything so finally after because
[1:10:34] nobody has a watch up there so it
[1:10:35] doesn't matter so finally he said oh and
[1:10:38] sir and what was your name
[1:10:39] oh I'm just Moses
[1:10:42] so they will be surprised that we make
[1:10:45] it now we are living in dark laodicea
[1:10:48] and you might have heard me say this
[1:10:51] before but you see brother Ram traveled
[1:10:54] a lot and in 1959 he was traveling down
[1:10:57] here in the in the islands in Jamaica
[1:10:58] and so forth and there was a a uh some
[1:11:02] Americans with him and so one of them
[1:11:04] says that he had
[1:11:06] um a four-hour session with brother
[1:11:08] random one day and they talked about a
[1:11:11] lot of things and he asked brother and
[1:11:13] why do you say so much about 1959 about
[1:11:15] 1977.
[1:11:17] they're in 59 he's talking about 77
[1:11:20] which is 18 years out there who knows if
[1:11:23] we're even going to get there and so
[1:11:25] brother Ram says well because as I look
[1:11:27] through the stream of time so he's
[1:11:28] seeing numbers he said when I got to 77
[1:11:31] it was so dark I didn't see how anybody
[1:11:33] could live in that kind of Darkness
[1:11:36] well guess what we're 47 years the other
[1:11:40] side Now
[1:11:42] 46 whatever that's right and it's more
[1:11:45] darker it's more deceiving and because
[1:11:48] you see there's there's promises in the
[1:11:50] Bible and we always go to the positive
[1:11:52] promises but there's negative promises
[1:11:54] there's things that must come to pass on
[1:11:57] God's clock
[1:11:58] and one of them is Matthew 24 24.
[1:12:02] there's going to be something come along
[1:12:04] some Force through some people
[1:12:07] that is going to be so deceiving
[1:12:10] it's going to take even right up to the
[1:12:12] elect everybody else so that we're safe
[1:12:15] okay
[1:12:16] so but um
[1:12:19] all these promises must have a
[1:12:21] fulfillment right but the redeemed are
[1:12:23] waiting in love praise God you might
[1:12:26] never heard that phrase but it's in the
[1:12:27] message we'll get to it eventually so
[1:12:29] many people are waiting to hear the
[1:12:31] gospel for the first time they might be
[1:12:34] your neighbor they might be people at
[1:12:36] Walmart wherever you see so through
[1:12:39] radio through internet the gospel is
[1:12:41] reaching people that we can never go
[1:12:43] preach to you see the scriptures and the
[1:12:46] message it's all available in many
[1:12:48] languages on every cell phone
[1:12:50] but you got to know what numbers to push
[1:12:52] right to bring it up you see and so it's
[1:12:55] available all the time now in the
[1:12:57] ministry of Jesus Christ as you know if
[1:12:59] you've read your scriptures
[1:13:01] um he didn't deal with the nice people
[1:13:03] of society he dealt with people that we
[1:13:05] wouldn't even want coming in here they
[1:13:07] didn't dress right they didn't act right
[1:13:09] that's good but they had to Encounter
[1:13:11] With Jesus Christ and their life changed
[1:13:14] amen and so many hundreds of uh
[1:13:18] Dangerous Drug people in Mexico have
[1:13:22] heard the gospel hundreds and hundreds
[1:13:25] have been baptized so it's doing you
[1:13:27] know the gospel over the radio and
[1:13:29] through the uh memory sticks that we've
[1:13:31] distributed and so forth is doing much
[1:13:33] more to solve the problem than all the
[1:13:35] soldiers at the border and all the stuff
[1:13:37] that's going on Wow Wow and just this
[1:13:39] week they indicted another high official
[1:13:42] that was taking money under the table so
[1:13:46] things are happening you see and the
[1:13:48] book of Acts you know is not finished
[1:13:50] yet it's still in the writing here in
[1:13:52] the 21st century we're part of it you're
[1:13:55] a part of it so we're still translating
[1:13:57] still printing
[1:13:59] um because there's hungry people there's
[1:14:01] people out there just like you sitting
[1:14:03] in churches this morning some of them
[1:14:05] have never seen even seen a book for
[1:14:07] five years
[1:14:08] so we're printing in China Distributing
[1:14:10] throughout Latin America and
[1:14:13] they have the message in their language
[1:14:16] something I can underline turn back you
[1:14:18] know and if you don't have a church age
[1:14:19] book we got some out in the car
[1:14:22] there's no excuse me okay
[1:14:25] so many people in the scriptures had to
[1:14:28] wait we have the story in Luke 2 of old
[1:14:31] the old man called Simeon and he was
[1:14:34] getting old he wanted to die but God
[1:14:36] spoke to him he says son you're not
[1:14:38] going to die until your eyes have seen
[1:14:40] the consolation of Israel amen so he
[1:14:42] gave him some kind of sign we don't know
[1:14:44] what it was we don't know how long he
[1:14:46] waited but he was waiting because there
[1:14:49] was a an expectation in the air for the
[1:14:52] Messiah and um to to know what's going
[1:14:55] on and and some people like him there's
[1:14:58] only a few that recognize what God was
[1:15:01] doing in present tense you see and so he
[1:15:04] would um uh let's we don't know but
[1:15:07] let's assume that they had a certain day
[1:15:08] of the week that they dedicate the
[1:15:10] babies so the long line of women and
[1:15:13] their babies are out there and he'd go
[1:15:15] out and he'd look no no sign today go
[1:15:17] back to bed one day he goes out and he
[1:15:20] saw the sign that he was looking for
[1:15:21] amen we don't know what it is it's not
[1:15:23] important and so he goes out there and
[1:15:27] he stands right there beside Mary and
[1:15:29] Joseph
[1:15:30] and only Mary and Joseph and Simeon knew
[1:15:33] what was going on the rest of them it's
[1:15:35] just another day of dedicating babies
[1:15:37] and so he goes up to her and says may I
[1:15:40] hold the baby sure and that he said in
[1:15:43] prayer let thy servant now depart in
[1:15:45] peace my eyes have seen what do you see
[1:15:48] a baby a crying baby but that was God's
[1:15:51] solution
[1:15:53] and so
[1:15:55] um he was part of Israel at that time
[1:15:57] very few people recognized what God was
[1:16:00] doing
[1:16:01] Jesus didn't come with with a crown with
[1:16:04] gold robes no he looked like everybody
[1:16:06] else you know and so uh that was then
[1:16:09] now what about Israel today well they're
[1:16:11] doing fine thank you they're in their
[1:16:12] Homeland according to scripture and
[1:16:15] they're waiting for the Messiah and
[1:16:17] they're currently currently crying out
[1:16:19] for Redemption
[1:16:20] because God is in control he doesn't
[1:16:23] need us to go over there and slip in you
[1:16:26] know tracks They know the god of the
[1:16:28] Bible
[1:16:29] we got to do our part you know and so in
[1:16:32] Genesis 12 it says I will bless those
[1:16:34] that bless thee amen and I will curse
[1:16:36] those that curse them and so those who
[1:16:39] have been over there you've seen the
[1:16:40] blessings all the neighbors are crazy
[1:16:41] they want to bulldoze them into the sea
[1:16:43] right but they're standing that's right
[1:16:46] they're they're fine and like the
[1:16:48] brother said yes we do still take people
[1:16:50] over there amen I'm not in a wheelchair
[1:16:53] yet oh so we have a trip in June we have
[1:16:57] a trip in December so get your coins
[1:17:00] together now in our scripture in Luke
[1:17:03] chapter 8 also in mark five
[1:17:05] when when Jesus came back to the port
[1:17:09] they've been across the sea across the
[1:17:11] lake they came back and
[1:17:14] he uh he always drowns the crowd whoever
[1:17:17] he's had and so here comes the um the uh
[1:17:20] the boat and there's people down there
[1:17:21] well there's one little sister lived up
[1:17:23] on the hillside and she's up there in
[1:17:25] her rocking chair knitting and she sees
[1:17:27] that crown down there huh I wonder
[1:17:28] what's going on down there now she was
[1:17:31] sick
[1:17:31] okay she'd been sick for 12 years had a
[1:17:35] blood issue that wouldn't cure she went
[1:17:37] to every doctor she'd already mortgaged
[1:17:39] her Farm she sold the animals she was
[1:17:41] desperate and nothing worked oh my God
[1:17:44] and so she's at the end of her rope
[1:17:46] and so she said well I'll go down and
[1:17:48] see what's going on well she got down
[1:17:49] there close oh Jesus is coming by and so
[1:17:53] when she got you know a little closer
[1:17:55] God gave her a revelation that
[1:17:58] if you just reach over there and just
[1:18:00] just touch just touch His Garment
[1:18:03] do I have to have a three-hour interview
[1:18:04] don't need to be prayed for it just just
[1:18:06] touch his garments that's right that's
[1:18:08] right right and that's what she did
[1:18:09] there's all these people Milling around
[1:18:11] and she reached his own touched His
[1:18:13] Garment
[1:18:14] and the disciples were there and so uh
[1:18:17] Jesus said no wait a minute somebody
[1:18:19] touched me that's right I guess it was
[1:18:22] right beside him
[1:18:23] Big Mouth Peter
[1:18:25] he had a habit of speaking before he
[1:18:28] thought
[1:18:30] amen I know some people like that that's
[1:18:32] right he says Lord please all these
[1:18:35] people Peter
[1:18:36] zip it that's right this was different
[1:18:38] amen and so he looked around he
[1:18:40] discerned a house it was you and she was
[1:18:42] healed end of a problem that's right
[1:18:45] amen so you need to read about that in
[1:18:46] Luke chapter 8 Mark 5.
[1:18:49] um yeah so she she received her her
[1:18:52] healing now in Luke 19 we have some
[1:18:55] another guy that was waiting for Jesus
[1:18:57] now Jesus had been busy you know and the
[1:19:00] scripture says he went to Village to
[1:19:01] Village preaching and so he's coming
[1:19:03] through
[1:19:05] um coming through Jericho and somebody
[1:19:07] was there waiting for him right and all
[1:19:10] these people and the master said you
[1:19:11] know the Master's been tired been
[1:19:13] praying for sickness stand back a little
[1:19:15] bit but you see there's a man there he
[1:19:17] was short
[1:19:18] and so he had he not only was he short
[1:19:21] but he he had that name sort of a scene
[1:19:24] so he was always at the back of the line
[1:19:26] yes Zacchaeus
[1:19:29] and so his wife Rebecca they owned a
[1:19:33] restaurant and Jesus would stop there
[1:19:34] sometimes but Zacchaeus just couldn't
[1:19:36] get it together how can he be a prophet
[1:19:38] look at those sorry people he hangs
[1:19:40] around with and so
[1:19:42] um he heard he was coming so you've
[1:19:44] heard the story many times he gets up in
[1:19:46] the tree and where he can look down and
[1:19:47] get a good view and so with his you know
[1:19:50] great discernment he's going to tell
[1:19:51] whether it's a prophet or not
[1:19:54] and so Jesus coming along he stops right
[1:19:57] under the tree hi is Zacchaeus come on
[1:19:59] down I'm going to your house
[1:20:01] he'd been waiting amen now he got a
[1:20:03] result that he wasn't waiting for you
[1:20:05] know and um so then as he's leaving
[1:20:09] um uh what do we call a Jericho see all
[1:20:12] the all the towns had a wall around him
[1:20:14] he didn't have airplanes so if you're
[1:20:16] going to attack him you have to come
[1:20:16] through the gate so they had this wall
[1:20:18] around him and um so in the in the
[1:20:21] shadow of the wall there was a man
[1:20:23] waiting and his name was Bartimaeus
[1:20:26] and he um they didn't have German
[1:20:30] Shepherd dogs back then they had a lamb
[1:20:32] that they'd trained to take him to the
[1:20:34] wall and bring him back wow and so you
[1:20:37] know that was the Lamb's job and so he's
[1:20:39] in the shade of the wall and he can't
[1:20:41] see he's blind and he hears all this
[1:20:43] noise and so he's asking his um his
[1:20:46] buddy there what's all this noise about
[1:20:48] well it seems like there's a man coming
[1:20:51] by that they say is a prophet really
[1:20:54] yeah and his name is Jesus Jesus is here
[1:20:57] and you didn't tell me oh wow so he
[1:20:59] starts screaming out you know son of
[1:21:00] David have mercy on me it's another Mark
[1:21:02] chapter 10. and so Jesus couldn't hear
[1:21:05] him he's you know 100 yards away but he
[1:21:07] felt the cry amen and he came and healed
[1:21:11] him praise God so all these people were
[1:21:12] waiting for him now Jesus is leaving
[1:21:15] Jericho which is below sea level and
[1:21:18] he's coming up to Jerusalem okay A
[1:21:20] little path there's all these people
[1:21:22] with him the crowd is growing and um so
[1:21:26] the the the road it's about 24 miles and
[1:21:31] it climbs 3 600 feet it's all uphill
[1:21:34] because Jericho's below sea level and
[1:21:37] Jerusalem's up here and so they're going
[1:21:39] along and Jesus Takes a break and he
[1:21:43] sent his disciples over to the next
[1:21:45] village now all this is in your Bible
[1:21:47] okay and so he says now look over that
[1:21:50] other Village over there and you're
[1:21:51] going to find a um a donkey and that
[1:21:55] donkey's the mother donkey he's got a
[1:21:56] little white baby donkey with it and I
[1:21:59] need it now he's not making this up it
[1:22:02] wasn't because he was tired but it's
[1:22:04] because 500 years before
[1:22:06] a prophet said over in Zechariah 9 9
[1:22:08] Rejoice daughter of Jerusalem thy King
[1:22:11] cometh unto thee he is just having
[1:22:13] salvation lowly that means he's humble
[1:22:17] and he's writing what Cadillac no
[1:22:20] Big White Horse no
[1:22:23] no no
[1:22:24] shiny new truck no riding on a cold the
[1:22:27] fold of an ass a small insignificant
[1:22:30] donkey that's right so a prophet said it
[1:22:33] and then time passes amen 500 years if
[1:22:37] you look at your you know history book
[1:22:38] 500 years ago was Martin Luther
[1:22:41] or you know
[1:22:42] Columbus and so forth so a lot of things
[1:22:45] can happen well if a prophet said this
[1:22:47] then the first guy that had a white
[1:22:49] donkey this is the one praise God this
[1:22:52] is the one wow and then down the road
[1:22:54] another guy had well which one is it
[1:22:55] amen they all died but finally there's
[1:22:58] one fulfillment
[1:23:01] a lot of interpretations only one
[1:23:02] fulfillment so the crowd was on the way
[1:23:05] to the temple
[1:23:06] screaming from Psalms 118 25 and 26. now
[1:23:10] in English we say hosanna
[1:23:12] in Spanish we say hosanna but they're
[1:23:15] saying Hosanna which means blessed is he
[1:23:18] that cometh in the name of the Lord so
[1:23:20] they're quoting scripture they're going
[1:23:21] along you know and they're putting
[1:23:23] branches down for him to walk on you
[1:23:25] know the donkey and so forth now the
[1:23:27] Romans were there they were the they
[1:23:28] were the highway patrol they were the
[1:23:29] policemen and they're just watching be
[1:23:31] sure everything's not out of control but
[1:23:34] they had no Revelation but there was
[1:23:36] also people waiting called Pharisees now
[1:23:39] Pharisees knew their prophet's Bible
[1:23:41] precisely they knew how many of those he
[1:23:43] said and how many uh they they had all
[1:23:45] that figured out you see and they were
[1:23:48] waiting in arrogance not in love
[1:23:50] and they were waiting for an opportunity
[1:23:53] to make Jesus smaller that was their job
[1:23:56] the manifested word of the hour to show
[1:23:58] a bad attitude and in Luke 19 39 says
[1:24:02] they jumped out in front of the you know
[1:24:03] the parades coming so they jumped out in
[1:24:05] front of the parade and um
[1:24:08] and they said now Master you need to
[1:24:09] calm these people down you know and we
[1:24:13] know that you're not the one that the
[1:24:15] scripture talks about
[1:24:16] you're just a bunch of Fanatics you know
[1:24:18] and um and um so we know that you're not
[1:24:22] that person now they knew their prophets
[1:24:25] words perfectly okay they didn't have
[1:24:27] iPad they didn't have a tape recorder
[1:24:29] they read they memorized all these years
[1:24:33] now they've been 400 years without a
[1:24:35] prophet and so they had a lot of
[1:24:36] traditions down this is the way it's got
[1:24:38] to be right you know and um they figured
[1:24:42] out that he wasn't the one that fit the
[1:24:43] description they were legalists yes they
[1:24:46] were afraid that somebody was going to
[1:24:47] be happy in church can't have that no
[1:24:50] all right
[1:24:51] scared to death that prophet's words
[1:24:52] might actually Bloom out and manifest
[1:24:55] into something amen we don't argue hey
[1:24:57] Prophet said now there's a time when it
[1:24:59] blooms out
[1:25:02] down here where it's warm all the time
[1:25:04] you don't know when things are going to
[1:25:07] bloom or not but up in the North Country
[1:25:09] there's those rose bushes and if it
[1:25:11] wasn't for the Thorns you wouldn't know
[1:25:12] what it is but then there comes a day
[1:25:14] when the flower comes out the pear tree
[1:25:16] produces wow and so
[1:25:19] today we have any number of people and
[1:25:21] you probably know some of them they're
[1:25:23] ready to listen or they'll listen 24
[1:25:25] hours a day quote it word for word okay
[1:25:28] so far so good but scared to death that
[1:25:31] there might be a fulfillment of the
[1:25:33] prophetic word but it might actually
[1:25:35] Bloom out in something especially in a
[1:25:37] brother like Jack are you kidding me you
[1:25:40] know all right I don't know God is God
[1:25:43] glory he's going to manifest himself
[1:25:45] however he please
[1:25:47] right yeah and so
[1:25:50] um they
[1:25:51] are afraid that somebody's going to say
[1:25:53] this is that
[1:25:55] this is exactly what Mighty Prophet
[1:25:57] William Brown spoke of but see we're in
[1:25:59] a minority because we believe it doesn't
[1:26:02] matter who he uses what time of day God
[1:26:05] is God so Jesus was also waiting for his
[1:26:08] opportunity
[1:26:10] and he looked around he said now you see
[1:26:12] all these rocks boys I can tell these
[1:26:14] people to be quiet they'll be quiet but
[1:26:16] if I tell if I tell them to be quiet all
[1:26:18] these rocks are going to scream out
[1:26:21] brother Jack was over there picking up
[1:26:22] rocks
[1:26:24] hey you'd be surprised we had a guy over
[1:26:26] there once one of the trips and um
[1:26:29] we were in this Elijah's cave well it's
[1:26:31] a Catholic Church yes don't let that
[1:26:33] scare you thanks to the Catholics
[1:26:34] there's something to go look at because
[1:26:36] it was the Pentecostals like us that
[1:26:38] already took it all home
[1:26:39] so so it's Catholic okay they have
[1:26:43] candles so we get back on the bus and
[1:26:45] this guy's got black what are you doing
[1:26:46] well I was looking for a loose Rock
[1:26:49] and Elijah's cave yeah thousands of
[1:26:52] millions people have been through there
[1:26:53] and you're going to find a loose Rock
[1:26:56] I can write a book
[1:26:58] but anyway that's right um so there's
[1:27:01] some of the rocks are still there that's
[1:27:02] right you know and I don't want any Rock
[1:27:05] taking my place
[1:27:07] the friends we walk by faith not by
[1:27:09] sight
[1:27:11] but God does encourage us from time to
[1:27:13] time and he lets us see a little
[1:27:15] evidence he does answer our prayers yes
[1:27:18] no a little later
[1:27:21] and so
[1:27:23] um we um we know that God is in charge
[1:27:26] now our only desire
[1:27:28] is to please God with our thoughts our
[1:27:32] words our Deeds you see we're directed
[1:27:34] by his holy spirit brother Adam says you
[1:27:37] will have difficulty with this flesh
[1:27:38] until the day he calls you home now
[1:27:42] there's some smooth sailing and there's
[1:27:43] more Hills and Valleys but we are going
[1:27:45] someplace you see and
[1:27:48] um by by Grace every believer will
[1:27:51] overcome
[1:27:53] and so
[1:27:55] um it's a dark world but the scripture
[1:27:57] says they overcame him by the blood of
[1:27:59] the lamb and by the word of their
[1:28:01] testimony his blood and your life once
[1:28:05] you manifest your reactions to the
[1:28:07] testing you see God could put everything
[1:28:09] in order in our lives before lunchtime
[1:28:13] fill your bank account you know give you
[1:28:16] another another car you do a lot of
[1:28:18] things things you think are a problem
[1:28:20] yeah bring your waiver children back you
[1:28:23] can do all that
[1:28:24] but he lets it go on and on and on and
[1:28:28] he's watching for your reactions
[1:28:30] how do you react to the test
[1:28:35] so what are you reflecting here in dark
[1:28:38] laodicea
[1:28:39] what it depends what you're feeding on
[1:28:41] right if you're going to feed on the
[1:28:43] news you're going to go crazy if you're
[1:28:46] going to look at the stock market report
[1:28:47] you know it's not going to work right
[1:28:49] you know so you must be balanced in
[1:28:53] spirit and in truth like Jesus told the
[1:28:54] woman at the well God is seeking those
[1:28:56] that worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:28:59] it's going to be balanced you can have
[1:29:01] you can have all kinds of spirit oh man
[1:29:04] we tore the church down we wrecked the
[1:29:05] chairs we tore up the organ and then
[1:29:07] what
[1:29:09] had to buy more you know that's right or
[1:29:11] you can have all kinds of Truth oh man
[1:29:13] we got it down tight but no
[1:29:15] manifestation it's got to be balanced
[1:29:18] it's got to be balanced
[1:29:21] Okay so
[1:29:22] what um
[1:29:24] what about your children what do they
[1:29:26] see in you because children record
[1:29:28] everything remember those days when they
[1:29:31] were amen and they let it out at the
[1:29:33] strangest times
[1:29:35] amen yeah I like your grandma's house
[1:29:38] but uh what does your wife see in you
[1:29:40] she knows you best amen what does your
[1:29:42] unconverted neighbor see does he see a
[1:29:44] Christian or some kind of fanatic always
[1:29:47] quoting William Branham they don't care
[1:29:49] about William Branham they want to see
[1:29:50] the Life of Christ in you you know
[1:29:53] so uh just live your message
[1:29:57] and those that are anointed that you
[1:30:00] know they'll ask questions but you can't
[1:30:03] refer them all to brother Jack you've
[1:30:05] got to have answers you've got to go to
[1:30:07] your Bible and show them the five
[1:30:09] comings of Elijah and we're over here
[1:30:11] and the next one's coming get ready
[1:30:16] so II Peter 1 19 we have also more sure
[1:30:19] word of Prophecy under who you do well
[1:30:21] under which you do well to take heed as
[1:30:23] unto a light that shines in a dark place
[1:30:25] until the day star arise in your hearts
[1:30:28] so we got to stay balanced we got to
[1:30:31] stay steady and
[1:30:33] um we've got to stay in step with the
[1:30:35] beat and the rhythm of the pure Gospel
[1:30:37] of Jesus Christ okay
[1:30:39] but you must maintain the vertical I see
[1:30:43] like this thing here it's Pulpit now the
[1:30:45] vertical that is your prayer life that's
[1:30:48] the long part of the cross
[1:30:50] you do your part you stay in prayer God
[1:30:53] will take care of the horizontal
[1:30:57] okay let's see what the prophet says
[1:30:59] here in 1965. uh a man running from the
[1:31:02] presence of the Lord
[1:31:04] now this is February 17th of 1965.
[1:31:08] and it just so happens that brother
[1:31:10] Brown had promised the people I will
[1:31:13] come back I will preach on merge and
[1:31:15] divorce I'll let you know so he let him
[1:31:18] know that there's going to be four
[1:31:19] services in that week in the middle of
[1:31:22] February so that you know they're living
[1:31:25] in Tucson the kids are in school and
[1:31:29] um so he drove back by himself now when
[1:31:31] he when he when he traveled by himself
[1:31:33] he uh he was just wears his boots and
[1:31:36] some blue jeans and stuff and he
[1:31:38] wouldn't even stop at a hotel he'd go
[1:31:40] when he got tired he would take a power
[1:31:41] nap this stops in place 10 15 minutes
[1:31:45] ready to go keep going so he arrived
[1:31:48] back there in Jeffersonville early hours
[1:31:50] of Wednesday morning and the first
[1:31:52] service isn't until Thursday evening
[1:31:53] it'll be Thursday Friday Saturday and
[1:31:55] Sunday and so he's up there at the house
[1:31:58] by himself in Jeffersonville and um he
[1:32:01] uh he thought well I can't stay up here
[1:32:03] all the people around the church
[1:32:04] Wednesday night I'll go down there and
[1:32:06] maybe gather some inspiration well when
[1:32:08] they seen him come in brother Neville
[1:32:09] said hey bro Bill compare so he doesn't
[1:32:12] have anything he's not prepared church
[1:32:15] is tomorrow night
[1:32:16] so he goes up there and preaches this
[1:32:17] great message a man running from the
[1:32:19] presence of the Lord
[1:32:21] and he says I believe we have truth I'm
[1:32:23] satisfied of that I believe the wheat
[1:32:26] absolutely the shuck is pulling away
[1:32:28] from it great kernels of Truth here so
[1:32:32] we don't have to wonder whether this is
[1:32:34] true or not amen a Vindicated Prophet
[1:32:37] said it's true you might not understand
[1:32:39] all the things he says but the only
[1:32:42] thing you got to believe is an angel did
[1:32:44] meet him and sent him and you know he
[1:32:46] brought the truth so God says so has
[1:32:49] been Vindicated around the world and
[1:32:52] even after all these years brother
[1:32:54] Brown's been gone over 50 years it's
[1:32:56] still the truth it's still being
[1:32:58] Vindicated everywhere you see and so
[1:33:00] it's it's being it's out there in many
[1:33:02] languages so we should respect this
[1:33:05] ministry and not lean to our own
[1:33:07] understanding well I think it's like
[1:33:09] this I don't care what you think we got
[1:33:12] people preaching right now well we don't
[1:33:13] need William Brandon anymore we'll just
[1:33:15] go over here oh that's not right Spirit
[1:33:17] that's right
[1:33:19] amen no
[1:33:21] um people are trying to figure out the
[1:33:22] things they don't like or things not
[1:33:24] according to their you know Methodist
[1:33:25] understanding whatever right so may God
[1:33:28] have mercy on these people so we gotta
[1:33:30] we got to stay in Balance not go to
[1:33:33] extremes it just takes a little bit and
[1:33:36] got to stay balanced amen now brother
[1:33:40] random sister took the Catholics 2 000
[1:33:42] years to get to where they are today
[1:33:44] it says it took Pentecost 50 years to
[1:33:47] accomplish the same thing
[1:33:48] that's right so the amount of followers
[1:33:50] are Malachi 4 are in trouble amen we've
[1:33:54] been at over 50 years now you see and so
[1:33:58] um many tonight today are in worse
[1:34:01] condition than some of the Pentecost was
[1:34:03] with the Catholics because they're an
[1:34:05] idolatry you see it's it's not the fault
[1:34:09] of the messenger wow it's because of
[1:34:12] unbalanced teaching yes sir so if you
[1:34:14] start teaching you know
[1:34:16] for whatever reason just start going
[1:34:18] eventually your way out here amen and
[1:34:20] then there's no fellowship with anybody
[1:34:21] else you're the only ones going that's
[1:34:23] right that's crazy that's right so
[1:34:26] they're wandering away from the original
[1:34:28] speculating wow so imagine trying to
[1:34:31] build a house without a without a level
[1:34:33] amen if you have marbles going every
[1:34:35] which way you know it doesn't work
[1:34:37] that's right so
[1:34:40] um
[1:34:41] we um we think well what about these
[1:34:44] extremes I've been police I've seen
[1:34:47] extremes okay we got people today in
[1:34:50] some places in the planet that are
[1:34:52] burning candles to weigh Brandon's
[1:34:54] picture they're kneeling and praying now
[1:34:56] they've been exposed to unbalanced
[1:34:59] teachings
[1:35:00] but God is watching after his seed okay
[1:35:04] yeah they're doing this because they're
[1:35:06] not doing what Paul said and not saying
[1:35:09] what brother Branham said not paying
[1:35:11] attention to Galatians chapter 1.
[1:35:14] Paul had been on this missionary trip
[1:35:16] now
[1:35:18] maybe next time I come we'll get into
[1:35:19] the book of Acts but Paul traveled over
[1:35:22] ten thousand miles in 30 years
[1:35:25] he didn't have an SUV right no he walked
[1:35:28] okay wow and so he had been to a certain
[1:35:31] area and there's fruit people and you
[1:35:35] know baptized and so forth he comes back
[1:35:37] a few months later and these people were
[1:35:39] already you know out of balance they
[1:35:41] were going in another Direction yes he
[1:35:43] said what's wrong with you people
[1:35:45] where you're going is zero there's only
[1:35:47] one gospel amen he said Hey in fact he
[1:35:50] said if I come back next week or if
[1:35:53] Silas or Jack Duff or whoever comes back
[1:35:55] and preaches something different than
[1:35:58] what I've already given you by
[1:35:59] revelation
[1:36:01] going down amen and so we got people
[1:36:03] today everywhere
[1:36:05] saying things are in the Bible they're
[1:36:06] not no tape anywhere
[1:36:08] and we got problems but see that has to
[1:36:11] be God has a way of luring people let
[1:36:15] them go that way that's what they're
[1:36:16] called so Matthew uh Matthew 24 24 is
[1:36:20] real there's that is a real Spirit okay
[1:36:24] so God is not nervous everything is on
[1:36:27] schedule
[1:36:29] you know what time did you get in last
[1:36:31] night
[1:36:34] 12 12. yeah but you were depending on
[1:36:37] that plane getting there at the right
[1:36:38] time so God's program is all on schedule
[1:36:41] it's going to happen
[1:36:42] so let's go ahead here and see if we can
[1:36:45] get finished here so the solution is
[1:36:47] back to the sure word of Prophecy right
[1:36:49] here now you don't understand it we'll
[1:36:51] read it again
[1:36:52] you don't understand it ask the pastor
[1:36:54] God put five Ministries in the church to
[1:36:57] for the Perfection to bring the church
[1:36:59] to the Rapture okay so extreme is very
[1:37:03] dangerous
[1:37:04] and um we don't want to lean during
[1:37:06] understanding and let's see here
[1:37:11] there are there are forces at work today
[1:37:14] they were here when William Brown was
[1:37:15] here you see I'm going to be 78 years
[1:37:18] old in a few months so I remember back
[1:37:20] then there was people that were right
[1:37:23] there they look like red hot followers
[1:37:25] but they were they were already on the
[1:37:27] wrong track oh wow they could repeat the
[1:37:29] words but the spirit was wrong wow you
[1:37:32] see and so there's people today with
[1:37:35] that same anointing they can well they
[1:37:37] can quote it but there's a there's
[1:37:39] there's a spirit about it it ain't right
[1:37:41] amen see and they're they're separating
[1:37:44] out the deity of Jesus Christ and that
[1:37:46] causes confusion you see brother REM
[1:37:49] says over here on um great servant Moses
[1:37:51] as Moses went with that judgment stick
[1:37:54] before him that same stick tonight to
[1:37:57] the church is Jesus Christ if those
[1:37:59] Egyptians could have ever gotten that
[1:38:01] little little stick out of Moses hands
[1:38:04] he they would have had him whipped
[1:38:06] and when the devil can ever get the
[1:38:08] deity out of the name of Jesus Christ
[1:38:10] he's got the church whip amen and I know
[1:38:13] some of those people they only want
[1:38:14] Victory kids are going crazy because
[1:38:17] unbalanced teaching it's got to be right
[1:38:20] okay so there's forces that were there
[1:38:23] they're still here today
[1:38:26] and um it only causes confusion causes
[1:38:29] doubt it takes the people away from
[1:38:31] Jesus Christ
[1:38:32] now this this level has another purpose
[1:38:35] see one thing is you know but now if I
[1:38:38] see anybody trying to go to sleep
[1:38:42] laughs
[1:38:43] it usually works
[1:38:47] so
[1:38:48] in Isaiah chapter 40 it speaks about
[1:38:50] waiting
[1:38:52] they that wait and that's not everybody
[1:38:54] but those that wait upon the Lord
[1:38:56] they'll renew their strength Mount up
[1:38:58] with wings as Eagles run and not be
[1:39:00] weary and they shall walk and not faint
[1:39:03] so one of God's favorite methods of
[1:39:06] preparing us for something great is to
[1:39:09] send us into the Shadows to wait
[1:39:11] okay that doesn't mean you're doomed to
[1:39:13] to terminal Darkness right there's a
[1:39:16] British author that said waiting is a
[1:39:18] common instrument of providential
[1:39:20] discipline for those to whom exceptional
[1:39:22] work has been appointed who should have
[1:39:25] thought of that but it's true you see
[1:39:27] and like you quoted earlier Esther Now
[1:39:30] esther is a very special person back
[1:39:32] here in the Old Testament
[1:39:34] okay don't forget we got four steps to
[1:39:36] talk about balance
[1:39:39] so Esther was a just another Jewish girl
[1:39:41] in the crowd that got taken away to
[1:39:43] Babylon
[1:39:44] and um
[1:39:47] it's a great love story of God's
[1:39:49] providential care how he cares for his
[1:39:51] own and guess what in the Book of Esther
[1:39:53] God has not mentioned one that's right
[1:39:55] brother what you're doing there God is
[1:39:57] in control he doesn't depend on us you
[1:40:01] know and so by but God's choice she
[1:40:03] became Queen and was able to deliver the
[1:40:06] Jewish people from destruction God is
[1:40:09] always in control
[1:40:11] he doesn't have to consult with us you
[1:40:13] know so she was just another believer
[1:40:15] that waited and in chapter 4 16 uh her
[1:40:19] hour of decision came you know and there
[1:40:22] seems to be a blank spot for three days
[1:40:24] from uh verse 17 to chapter 5 verse one
[1:40:28] nothing's recorded in that part of the
[1:40:30] drama nothing's happening but it was
[1:40:33] during this time that she was fasting
[1:40:35] she was praying seeking the mind of
[1:40:38] Jehovah because she's getting ready to
[1:40:40] step off into who knows where you know
[1:40:42] and during this time she was probably
[1:40:45] reading the book of Isaiah which was
[1:40:47] written 300 years before her wow
[1:40:49] where it says fear thou not I am with
[1:40:52] thee be not as maid I am thy God I will
[1:40:56] strengthen the yea I will help Thee I
[1:40:58] will uphold thee with my right hand yes
[1:41:00] Lord
[1:41:01] behold all they that were incensed
[1:41:03] against thee shall be ashamed and
[1:41:06] confounded they shall be as nothing for
[1:41:08] the uh and they that strive with thee
[1:41:11] Shall Perish she found her
[1:41:13] identification in the Bible amen not you
[1:41:16] know TV the Bible so when the believer
[1:41:19] over here in our age is in tune with the
[1:41:23] spirit of God you're doing all that you
[1:41:24] know to do that believer can identify
[1:41:26] with the portion that applies and you
[1:41:29] will see how God will make the word come
[1:41:31] alive in your life
[1:41:33] might maybe something small
[1:41:35] I've seen many things happen you see and
[1:41:38] God can bring circumstances around that
[1:41:42] you haven't you couldn't imagine
[1:41:44] putting people in your life you know so
[1:41:46] you might be going through some blank
[1:41:48] days like she was where we've seen that
[1:41:51] nothing's happening
[1:41:52] but it's during those times that you
[1:41:54] need to find balance with prayer
[1:41:57] and reading God's word and you can't
[1:42:00] every one of you you everyone you can
[1:42:02] create an atmosphere depends on your
[1:42:05] attitude how you answer your mother how
[1:42:07] you react to things you create an
[1:42:09] atmosphere and it's time like that that
[1:42:12] you you could say well I'm not rushing
[1:42:14] into uncertain things I have no
[1:42:17] direction I can't find my way I'll just
[1:42:20] wait and see how God wrecks he has a way
[1:42:23] okay the God of this evil age August of
[1:42:27] 1965. now this day is very important
[1:42:30] because I was there I was there for some
[1:42:32] of those services in July of 1965. I was
[1:42:36] sitting that close when he's preaching
[1:42:37] 91s at the end time wow and of course I
[1:42:40] was young I was focused on the girl not
[1:42:42] on a message
[1:42:44] I was still still looking at the bait
[1:42:46] you know
[1:42:48] but um that was on a Sunday August 1st
[1:42:51] and I knew that we were going to be
[1:42:53] driving back to Tucson that week
[1:42:56] so that evening I asked brother M will
[1:42:58] there be time for you to baptize me
[1:43:00] correctly before we go back oh sure well
[1:43:03] he'd been waiting three years for that
[1:43:04] you know so he took me down on Monday
[1:43:06] morning and he baptized me correctly and
[1:43:09] turns out that was the last person he
[1:43:10] baptized wow well anyway on this message
[1:43:13] in the morning of uh August 1st says
[1:43:16] here she as the Bride is a part of the
[1:43:19] groom
[1:43:19] true to him in every Point waiting for
[1:43:22] the wedding
[1:43:24] and uniting not at the economical
[1:43:26] Council but in the sky at the wedding
[1:43:28] supper she has been given and has been
[1:43:30] revealed to her the seven sealed
[1:43:31] Mysteries of the Bible she sees the
[1:43:33] Folly of the deceiver okay we're talking
[1:43:35] about the bride she's Wide Awake she
[1:43:38] sees all this she sees the seven sealed
[1:43:39] Mysteries of the Bible she sees the
[1:43:41] Folly of the deceiver which is so close
[1:43:44] to the truth
[1:43:45] almost deceives the elect
[1:43:48] she sees it
[1:43:49] says see the two opposing spirits that
[1:43:51] work in this evil age can you see it
[1:43:54] each very religious Cain and able
[1:43:58] Spirits again coming to their head or
[1:44:00] their full manifestation safe
[1:44:02] still the same as they started out no
[1:44:05] change the Same Spirit just more mature
[1:44:08] it seems
[1:44:09] um
[1:44:10] says the one worshiped by Beauty and
[1:44:13] knowledge education science and ethics
[1:44:16] all sounds real good I mean look at this
[1:44:18] school you know it sounds good
[1:44:20] and the other one by faith of the
[1:44:24] revelation of the word of God
[1:44:26] whether she knows that she knows both of
[1:44:29] them are standing right in this building
[1:44:30] this morning oh wow
[1:44:32] see a prophet could he could discern
[1:44:34] that he knew that some of them people
[1:44:36] are just make Believers you know and so
[1:44:39] he says both of them in the standing in
[1:44:40] this building this morning
[1:44:41] the one is a prostitute the Bible says
[1:44:44] she's the mother of harlots they all
[1:44:46] come together and that kind of a woman
[1:44:48] is a woman that's untrue to her husband
[1:44:50] and claiming Christ as her husband and
[1:44:52] belonging to a denomination such
[1:44:54] nonsense saying we belong to Christ
[1:44:57] and this area is full of large churches
[1:45:00] we belong to Christ that's right there's
[1:45:02] people right here on the same grounds
[1:45:03] claiming the same thing I have no idea
[1:45:05] what the Bible says amen
[1:45:07] amen
[1:45:09] um but in obedience
[1:45:11] this little faith woman that lives by
[1:45:13] faith the bride a person here they're
[1:45:16] off somewhere else another church some
[1:45:18] other denomination wherever it is she
[1:45:21] believes the word of God Amen right now
[1:45:23] we happen to have a bunch of them
[1:45:24] together here but they're spread out
[1:45:25] everywhere they're everywhere she
[1:45:28] believes the word of God obedient
[1:45:31] see where we at here uh she's obedient
[1:45:34] waiting in love for the promise of the
[1:45:36] age to be confirmed amen now if you're
[1:45:39] waiting for something to be confirmed
[1:45:40] you have to know the something first all
[1:45:43] right you know you're thinking of some
[1:45:46] of you already thinking about KFC
[1:45:47] because you've been there and you know
[1:45:49] exactly what and if they left out one of
[1:45:52] those 11 ingredients you're going to
[1:45:53] know it so she's waiting for the promise
[1:45:56] of the age to be confirmed so you got to
[1:45:58] know what the promise of the age is
[1:46:00] we're not building an ark
[1:46:02] no we're not walking in the streets of
[1:46:04] gold just yet we're in laodicea you see
[1:46:07] says she is watching for it she is part
[1:46:10] of that word and she is watching for her
[1:46:12] life to manifest that word amen don't
[1:46:16] worry about everybody else see we know
[1:46:17] that in every group of people there's
[1:46:19] three kinds of believers don't worry
[1:46:21] about this one who are you
[1:46:24] man yeah that's one to concentrate on so
[1:46:27] uh that's where he mentions waiting in
[1:46:30] law okay so she's not looking for the
[1:46:33] flaws and others oh you should do this
[1:46:34] and you should do that in your hair you
[1:46:36] know no she's not like that no uh not
[1:46:39] looking for doctrinal differences yeah
[1:46:41] but those people over there
[1:46:43] you know it's our age of perfection
[1:46:45] we're headed up to this peak and we're
[1:46:48] all we're looking at the flaws and
[1:46:49] everybody else just take care of
[1:46:50] yourself
[1:46:51] she's part of that word watching for her
[1:46:54] life to manifest that word amen that's
[1:46:56] the secret you see so if anything is out
[1:46:59] of order just wait God will bring
[1:47:02] correction at the right time with the
[1:47:05] right spirit thank you
[1:47:07] so quote she is watching for her life to
[1:47:10] manifest that word not slamming and
[1:47:12] correcting everybody no waiting in love
[1:47:16] for the promise of the age to be
[1:47:19] confirmed watching for her life to
[1:47:21] manifest that word
[1:47:22] so
[1:47:24] may God help us
[1:47:26] I'm just reminding you what he said you
[1:47:28] know I've come up with a few sayings in
[1:47:30] my short lifetime illustrious preaching
[1:47:33] doesn't always translate into Victorious
[1:47:36] living wow wow how many brothers Jack
[1:47:39] knows people man they got a gift that's
[1:47:41] right mow everybody down
[1:47:44] that's right but turn them loose on the
[1:47:45] freeway let's see what kind of Life they
[1:47:46] live
[1:47:48] I'd rather walk you know so
[1:47:52] um William Branham lived what he
[1:47:54] preached
[1:47:55] I was not attracted by The Miracles wow
[1:47:58] I was attracted by the fact that a man
[1:48:00] lived the spirit of the scripture
[1:48:03] because the Bible is the ultimate that
[1:48:05] that's where it's all at and he lived it
[1:48:07] now he didn't waste any time he didn't
[1:48:10] uh he never took time to slam those that
[1:48:15] didn't believe it exactly his way I mean
[1:48:18] you have a woman coming in the prayer
[1:48:20] line
[1:48:21] she's obviously a woman preacher he
[1:48:23] prays for
[1:48:25] amen he doesn't kick her out he was a
[1:48:28] gentleman
[1:48:30] so I hope that you can see yourself in
[1:48:32] the mirror here somewhat today and that
[1:48:36] God gives you a peace that goes beyond
[1:48:37] the things you understand so we
[1:48:39] understand at a certain point
[1:48:41] I don't understand how those cars work I
[1:48:42] know you push the button and it goes but
[1:48:44] there's all kinds of intricate things
[1:48:46] yes I don't have to understand all that
[1:48:48] that's right so God's peace is beyond
[1:48:51] the things you understand
[1:48:54] his peace goes beyond the legalism and
[1:48:57] the religious fanaticism God promises
[1:49:00] that all things work together for good
[1:49:02] to for those that love God and are
[1:49:05] called according to his purpose you see
[1:49:08] so don't waste your time or your
[1:49:10] pastor's time trying to figure things
[1:49:11] out leave it alone
[1:49:15] relax wait in love for the manifestation
[1:49:18] of the promise in your life amen just
[1:49:22] just leave it alone yeah
[1:49:24] brother Brown says here
[1:49:28] [Music]
[1:49:28] um
[1:49:29] in uh 1955 the Devils Tremble When the
[1:49:32] weakest of saints goes to their knees
[1:49:34] what a power and a privilege has been
[1:49:36] given to the Church of the Living God
[1:49:37] when you fall to your knees in prayer
[1:49:39] even the devil's tremble amen it ought
[1:49:42] to be that when you when your feet land
[1:49:44] on the on the floor in the morning
[1:49:46] they're back
[1:49:49] amen so the devil knows when it's from
[1:49:52] the teeth out you know he knows when
[1:49:54] you're serious he's not deaf now brother
[1:49:56] Randall had to wait he didn't have all
[1:49:59] the answers at all times he was human
[1:50:01] you see and so when he was ready to
[1:50:04] preach Seven Seals
[1:50:06] everybody's waiting
[1:50:08] you know everything's ready he comes by
[1:50:10] Billy Paul's office he sent a bill if he
[1:50:13] ever prayed for Daddy right now I don't
[1:50:15] know what I'm going to say to these
[1:50:16] people
[1:50:18] he had to walk by faith
[1:50:21] now
[1:50:22] uh the new ministry so we got here that
[1:50:25] you might know that Sovereign Grace
[1:50:27] reigns with God did you know that those
[1:50:30] two boys sister had his boys that
[1:50:32] woman's children that were saved God
[1:50:34] knew that before the foundation of the
[1:50:35] world the same for each of you God knew
[1:50:38] that you'd be sitting here with those
[1:50:39] clothes on before the world was even
[1:50:42] formed exactly right amen
[1:50:45] um yeah their names are on the Lamb's
[1:50:47] Book alive the Bible says that it only
[1:50:48] had to come down to this minute see did
[1:50:51] you know that God knew that we'd be
[1:50:53] standing here 10 million years before
[1:50:55] the world was ever formed did you know
[1:50:57] that he uh he knew we'd be standing here
[1:51:00] this morning the infant is to see
[1:51:03] of God
[1:51:05] um
[1:51:06] knew every fly every Nat
[1:51:10] every mosquito every cockroach all those
[1:51:14] details
[1:51:16] you know he knew why Jack put on a white
[1:51:19] shirt today yes amen you know all these
[1:51:21] details he knew all that before the
[1:51:24] world was formed and um and so he says
[1:51:28] now so you say well if he knows all that
[1:51:30] why are you preaching
[1:51:32] that's part of God's program
[1:51:33] yeah preaching is his program when he
[1:51:37] looked upon the on the apostles and he
[1:51:40] looked upon the Harvest he said the
[1:51:41] Harvest is right and the labors are few
[1:51:43] pray to the Lord of the Harvest that he
[1:51:45] will send laborers into his Harvest
[1:51:47] he says here why would they have to pray
[1:51:49] to the Lord of the Harvest to send
[1:51:51] laborers into his Harvest if the lord of
[1:51:53] the Harvest was standing there knowing
[1:51:54] how it would be done
[1:51:57] good question he says God has so
[1:51:59] arranged it that his program cannot move
[1:52:02] without you and me
[1:52:04] and as long as we're as long as we're
[1:52:06] not doing what God leads us to do we're
[1:52:08] paralyzing his amen so because of your
[1:52:11] little excuses and you know sometimes
[1:52:14] too scared to step out my faith
[1:52:18] in other words you're you're wanting to
[1:52:21] do something for the missionary work but
[1:52:23] lowered that hundred dollars you know I
[1:52:24] got to take the family well this is the
[1:52:26] whole thing is a life of sacrifice if
[1:52:29] you'll step out by faith God will bless
[1:52:31] you so many ways you know and so as long
[1:52:35] as we're not doing what God leads us to
[1:52:36] do we're paralyzing his program but when
[1:52:39] the church moves under the anointing of
[1:52:41] the Holy Ghost then we're in God's will
[1:52:43] doing his program
[1:52:45] so just follow God's leading he will
[1:52:47] provide
[1:52:49] every time
[1:52:51] so let's see if we can wind this up here
[1:52:55] um you know many times we've rehearsed
[1:52:57] the scene of Abraham and Sarah living
[1:53:00] there under in that tent under the oak
[1:53:02] tree remember the whole story they moved
[1:53:05] they're under this big oak tree and
[1:53:06] they're there and the uh three uh people
[1:53:10] came by and you fixed them lunch and all
[1:53:12] that it's near Hebron which is south of
[1:53:15] Jerusalem
[1:53:17] and um and guess what the tree's still
[1:53:20] there
[1:53:21] most people have records of 5 000 years
[1:53:23] of that tree when I was there in
[1:53:27] uh 1984. there's still some green leaves
[1:53:31] on it
[1:53:32] so it's real but these people waited
[1:53:35] they waited in love not knowing it would
[1:53:37] be another 25 years
[1:53:39] when when God told them your time of
[1:53:42] life and so forth well they're expecting
[1:53:44] the child in nine months no long
[1:53:47] ER and that's why we got people flaking
[1:53:48] off today because well it's too long
[1:53:50] where's the promise of his coming you
[1:53:52] know and so they returned back young not
[1:53:55] just to have the child but because God
[1:53:57] said so see and so God can do anything
[1:54:01] so brother REM says he showed in Abraham
[1:54:03] and Sarah what he's going to do to you
[1:54:05] and your wife one of these days turn you
[1:54:07] back young again we are the seat of
[1:54:09] Abraham on our road to the promise
[1:54:13] I take uh well I say it humbly but my
[1:54:17] wife is waiting she's already turned
[1:54:19] young she's waiting for me now that
[1:54:21] might be words to some people but you
[1:54:24] see whenever uh whenever she was very
[1:54:27] aware ill maybe two weeks before she
[1:54:29] left I said look you're not just anybody
[1:54:32] you lived with the prophet of God for
[1:54:34] all those years you know what faith is
[1:54:36] you know what Miracles are and you know
[1:54:38] that God can put you back brand new next
[1:54:41] 20 minutes it can happen but if he
[1:54:43] chooses to take you well then you look
[1:54:46] for your dad and wait for me there amen
[1:54:48] Simple Solution amen
[1:54:50] well time goes on time passes you know
[1:54:55] so about two years ago
[1:54:57] a friend of mine that we work with a lot
[1:55:00] in the missionary work he called me
[1:55:02] early one morning of course he only
[1:55:03] speaks Spanish and uh he said he's
[1:55:06] crying man I have this dream well tell
[1:55:08] me about it well so in this dream he's
[1:55:10] in heaven and he's talking to William
[1:55:12] Branham
[1:55:13] I said wait a minute he doesn't
[1:55:15] speak Spanish you don't speak English
[1:55:16] yeah but we were talking so
[1:55:18] it's another language and
[1:55:22] um and he's so he had a lot of questions
[1:55:24] and they were talking and um so um
[1:55:28] he uh and you notice this young girl on
[1:55:30] brother brown right right beside him he
[1:55:32] looked at her I know that's Rebecca you
[1:55:35] know young and so she gives him a big
[1:55:38] smile she says you tell George I'm right
[1:55:40] where he told me to wait
[1:55:41] so it's real
[1:55:44] [Applause]
[1:55:48] so all we're trying to do is make Christ
[1:55:50] real to the people we're not trying to
[1:55:53] give you a shortcut or a pass because
[1:55:55] you're you know jacked Up's grandson or
[1:55:57] whatever no
[1:55:58] we're all going to go the same route you
[1:56:00] know and um so brother Brown says that
[1:56:04] some Greek Believers you know they had
[1:56:06] heard
[1:56:07] now they wanted to see Jesus we would
[1:56:10] like to see Jesus
[1:56:11] and so they'd already heard but they
[1:56:14] wanted to know more now God doesn't send
[1:56:16] entertainers he he sends preachers to
[1:56:19] preach his word amen amen well you know
[1:56:22] the whole story about the about the uh
[1:56:24] man that went out west to find the bride
[1:56:26] and so forth right
[1:56:28] look her troubles weren't from the next
[1:56:30] Village it was the same house all her
[1:56:32] troubles were right there so uh God
[1:56:36] knows what he's doing and so we waited
[1:56:38] his door with prayer we waited his foot
[1:56:41] with humility we waited his table with
[1:56:44] service and we wait at his window with
[1:56:46] expectancy now the four steps to get to
[1:56:51] Balanced Life
[1:56:53] every day from the youngest yeah you're
[1:56:56] right there on the second row
[1:56:59] every day you read one chapter of the
[1:57:02] Bible
[1:57:04] now you can do an order don't just jump
[1:57:06] around with it go through there
[1:57:08] one chapter of the Bible
[1:57:10] you read one page out of your church
[1:57:12] Facebook
[1:57:15] get serious
[1:57:17] okay read one chapter of the Bible read
[1:57:20] one page out of your church age book
[1:57:22] you listen to at least 20 minutes of
[1:57:24] God's Prophet it's on every phone on the
[1:57:26] planet and you pray
[1:57:28] four steps and with that I guarantee you
[1:57:31] your life will be more balanced you'll
[1:57:34] have a better attitude and the church
[1:57:37] will prosper
[1:57:39] okay
[1:57:40] may God bless you
[1:57:44] [Applause]
[1:58:02] I certainly thank God
[1:58:06] for our precious brother just passing
[1:58:09] our way
[1:58:10] and I remember the last time brother
[1:58:14] George came it gave us those four steps
[1:58:17] and and I remembered the the one page
[1:58:21] out of the church age book I remembered
[1:58:24] the prayer and I I believe um you know
[1:58:27] reading a chapter of the Bible but I am
[1:58:30] adding the um
[1:58:32] uh uh less than 20 minutes to God's
[1:58:36] profit every day right this is what
[1:58:39] brings you balance and everything so I I
[1:58:42] hope you all wrote that down if y'all
[1:58:43] didn't I'm in the process of writing
[1:58:46] this down I'm gonna have this and and
[1:58:48] we're gonna we're gonna use this uh
[1:58:51] this is what maintains balance brother
[1:58:54] George we appreciate you
[1:58:57] [Music]
[1:59:00] [Applause]
[1:59:04] um there was a very very there's many
[1:59:07] things that he said
[1:59:08] but
[1:59:10] one of the things that probably
[1:59:12] um
[1:59:14] Minister's ministers to me the most
[1:59:17] and uh I believe it's something that he
[1:59:20] probably got from being there with with
[1:59:22] brother Brown is the humility
[1:59:25] and which uh brother brother George
[1:59:28] brings the word of God
[1:59:32] all I felt today is that he was pointing
[1:59:35] us to Christ
[1:59:37] just just just point us directly to
[1:59:40] Jesus
[1:59:41] I mean this you know
[1:59:45] I don't even I don't even know how to
[1:59:46] say it but being the son-in-law of a
[1:59:48] prophet
[1:59:49] not and and I want to go a little
[1:59:52] further it's not you know this is a
[1:59:54] prophet that was
[1:59:56] uh promise according to scripture that
[2:00:00] would come to the Earth you go to the
[2:00:03] Book of Malachi chapter 4 and God said I
[2:00:06] will send you Elijah the prophet before
[2:00:09] the great and terrible day of the Lord
[2:00:10] God said that in his word and um uh so
[2:00:14] there had to be somebody that would come
[2:00:16] on Earth that would be the Fulfillment
[2:00:17] also according to Revelation 10 7 it
[2:00:20] says that when the seventh angel would
[2:00:23] begin to sound all the mysteries of God
[2:00:25] would be finished so so we see that
[2:00:27] somebody had to fulfill this and and you
[2:00:30] know I always tell people this I said
[2:00:32] you know if brother Branham brother
[2:00:34] William Miriam Branham was not the
[2:00:36] Fulfillment of that then just show me
[2:00:38] who it is that's all I mean I just
[2:00:42] believe it was his ministry that
[2:00:43] fulfilled it right and if he's not we
[2:00:46] let's agree to this that this is a
[2:00:48] promise in God's word and it must happen
[2:00:50] in this time right so God sent this
[2:00:53] Prophet called him off the scene in 1965
[2:00:56] life but uh so many great things like
[2:00:59] brother George said he's got a church
[2:01:01] age books in his car if you don't know
[2:01:03] anything everything we believe about
[2:01:05] this message was revealed in that church
[2:01:07] age book everything every doctrine that
[2:01:10] that people have come up with it is in
[2:01:12] that church age book and always try to
[2:01:14] tell people go back there go back to
[2:01:16] that church age book uh in order to
[2:01:18] prove what you're trying to say
[2:01:20] I just recently had a conversation deal
[2:01:22] with somebody we were dealing with the
[2:01:24] subject of the seven Thunders and what I
[2:01:27] realized uh is that this brother
[2:01:29] would actually uh put down the church
[2:01:33] age book
[2:01:34] and he would make a statement like this
[2:01:35] he says well uh I believe the church age
[2:01:38] book but you know it's not the voice of
[2:01:41] the Prophet speaking it I only want to
[2:01:44] hear the voice of the prophet and what
[2:01:46] he was trying to tell me is that he's
[2:01:48] discrediting the church age book
[2:01:51] right but brother Brandon watched over
[2:01:53] that book for a very specific purpose
[2:01:55] and it was a reason why God allowed the
[2:01:58] book to be completed in 1965 December
[2:02:01] 1965 and at the end of its completion
[2:02:04] God called him home
[2:02:06] everything we believe
[2:02:09] you will find it in churches but if
[2:02:11] you're trying to get an understanding on
[2:02:13] a revelation go back to what he said
[2:02:17] what he allowed to be written
[2:02:20] oh I can go many places with that I can
[2:02:24] go many places you know even your Bible
[2:02:26] you can't go you can't stand up and tell
[2:02:28] anybody I just want to hear the voice of
[2:02:30] Moses
[2:02:32] I want to hear the voice of Paul you
[2:02:36] know you came to you got to believe it
[2:02:37] by faith
[2:02:38] and same thing with that church Ace Book
[2:02:41] right but in there brother random told
[2:02:44] us that the uh the Thunders were the
[2:02:46] Mysteries contained to end the Seven
[2:02:49] Seals not just one but all Seven Seals
[2:02:53] he says they were the Mysteries
[2:02:54] contained in the Seven Seals and that
[2:02:57] was his Prophet I mean it was the
[2:02:58] prophet's duty to reveal that to the
[2:03:00] people
[2:03:01] oh church we got we got we got we gotta
[2:03:05] we got something precious in our hands
[2:03:07] and
[2:03:08] um and I thank God for it I'm so glad I
[2:03:10] can say I'm one of them amen amen
[2:03:14] [Music]
[2:03:15] um I'll say this too that I I want to
[2:03:17] remain humble um I mean uh I I do
[2:03:21] appreciate the fact that we've had many
[2:03:24] ministers to pass through our Pulpit I
[2:03:27] appreciate that and um you know I
[2:03:30] appreciate the ministers that we even
[2:03:32] have here in this church like I told you
[2:03:33] earlier brother Quaker was scheduled to
[2:03:35] preach today but he when I told them the
[2:03:37] change was like brother I'm local don't
[2:03:39] worry about that well it'll be another
[2:03:41] time for me I appreciate a heart like
[2:03:44] that I appreciate the spirit like that
[2:03:46] you know and I believe God got great
[2:03:48] blessings in store for our precious
[2:03:49] brother and it's not the first time that
[2:03:52] he's done it it I mean there's been
[2:03:53] other times somebody else passes through
[2:03:55] and he'll he'll he'll just give the
[2:03:57] pulpit over so I'm I'm grateful God
[2:03:59] bless you brother quick who amen we
