[44:36] wonderful wonderful thought and

[44:57] just the thought that he
[44:59] he brought he you know
[45:02] god is in every detail of our life
[45:04] [Music]
[45:05] every detail and uh brother zion was
[45:08] kind of sharing a portion of my
[45:09] testimony i didn't really want to go to
[45:11] school either i hated reading the only
[45:13] thing i want to read was the bible and
[45:15] and what the prophet said that's all i
[45:17] need to see right
[45:19] but i remember going to school and there
[45:21] was a
[45:23] a book that i read
[45:26] and uh and when i read this book um
[45:29] it it it changed me uh
[45:33] it actually uh moved me
[45:36] to uh to think about some things
[45:39] in in my christian journey and uh the
[45:43] title of the book was called
[45:44] who moved my cheese
[45:46] [Music]
[45:48] and um when i read i saw the title book
[45:51] i said now this this is this is
[45:52] this who wrote a book about moving
[45:55] cheese what is this
[45:56] nonsense why i got to read something
[45:58] like this right
[46:00] but as i start reading the book and they
[46:03] start bringing out the various
[46:04] characters inside the book and i can't
[46:06] remember i know it was two mice and two
[46:08] humans
[46:09] and uh and what happened there with the
[46:11] two mice and two humans
[46:13] is they were both going to a particular
[46:15] cheese station
[46:16] they were going and the mice begin to
[46:18] notice that you know we keep eating this
[46:20] cheese and she's represented something
[46:22] different for everybody to my to the
[46:23] mice it was their
[46:25] it was their their their substance for
[46:27] life is what they needed to eat in order
[46:29] to live
[46:30] but for the humans it was like their
[46:31] jobs it was their careers it was all
[46:33] these other things you know and
[46:35] and uh so they would show up at the same
[46:37] cheese station every day
[46:38] every day and uh and then the mice
[46:40] notice that as we keep eating on this
[46:41] cheese the cheese is starting to dwindle
[46:43] down
[46:44] praise the lord and the mice start
[46:46] having conversations like we're going to
[46:47] have to make a change here real quick to
[46:49] get some more cheese
[46:50] but the humans say no the cheese is
[46:51] going to come back when this go it's
[46:53] going it's going to be some oh come
[46:54] they said it might say uh-uh you gonna
[46:56] have to move to a new cheese station
[46:58] and uh and as the mice begin to just
[47:00] take a journey through the path of life
[47:02] and
[47:03] you know they they uh they they finally
[47:05] found some new cheese and they were just
[47:06] enjoying it and like
[47:07] i one of the humans still stuck back
[47:09] there that old cheese station
[47:11] and uh the mice were just sitting there
[47:13] enjoying and say oh i wish them humans
[47:14] would just wake up one day
[47:16] and realize there's more cheese out here
[47:18] [Music]
[47:20] there's more cheese out here hallelujah
[47:23] and then finally you know the the mice
[47:25] were sitting went to eat some cheese
[47:27] that day and
[47:27] they heard the dope busts open here come
[47:30] the humans
[47:31] and they wonder how the humans made it
[47:33] here so fast because one of the mice
[47:36] decided to leave some signs
[47:40] in the maze so they would find a way out
[47:43] a little faster than the mice did
[47:45] because the mice ran into a lot of dead
[47:46] ends but they found that
[47:48] let me leave you some signs so you'll go
[47:49] down some dead roads but you can get
[47:51] here faster to the cheese because
[47:52] there's more food out here
[47:55] and i'll tell you what when i read that
[47:59] i realize there's more food out there
[48:03] i had to go get some more cheese
[48:07] and god been feeding me ever since lord
[48:10] i thank you
[48:11] i thank you god amen
[48:14] but you know god uses every detail of
[48:17] our life to speak to us and his brother
[48:20] zion was saying last night he was you
[48:21] know just uh
[48:23] in that class of ethics he thought it
[48:24] was the wrong class
[48:26] and maybe some aspects of it could be
[48:28] wrong but when he got this part out of
[48:29] it about them three stages of the human
[48:32] uh development they say you go through
[48:34] the joyous
[48:35] ethical stage i'm sorry the joyous stage
[48:39] and then you and you go through this a
[48:40] joyous is more like you know every
[48:42] everything just make you happy whatever
[48:44] make you happy that's what you do
[48:46] i i my my grandson when he come to the
[48:48] house whatever he want to do he do
[48:51] if he want to go open up the piano just
[48:53] hit a few notes and
[48:54] and then walk to rebecca's room and hit
[48:56] a few notes on her piano that's what he
[48:58] do
[48:59] if he want to throw his cup on the floor
[49:01] and just spin it around
[49:02] that's what he do right because he's in
[49:05] that stage that we don't even try to
[49:07] correct him let him do what he do
[49:09] but he gonna get a little older and then
[49:11] he got the transition to the next stage
[49:13] and this is what they call the ethical
[49:15] stage where there's some rules on you
[49:17] can't throw that golf ball in the house
[49:19] [Music]
[49:22] you're gonna hurt something right you
[49:24] can't throw that golf ball in the house
[49:26] you got no no no there's a time and
[49:27] place for all of that but you can't do
[49:29] that
[49:30] here he gonna learn he gonna learn some
[49:32] you can't jump on the bed
[49:35] rules you understand how that work right
[49:37] i mean so he gonna learn that and if he
[49:39] don't learn it you know there's other
[49:41] consequences praise the lord but that's
[49:44] when we get to the ethical states but he
[49:46] say finally we get to this
[49:47] religious stage where it requires
[49:51] a leap of faith spirit lead me where my
[49:55] trust is without borders
[49:58] let me walk upon the water wherever you
[50:01] would call me
[50:02] take me deeper than my feet could ever
[50:05] wonder
[50:06] my faith would be made stronger in the
[50:09] presence
[50:11] of my savior i thank god for the word of
[50:15] god on last night

[55:47] lord
[55:48] amen zion if you'd come just have a song
[55:50] we'd
[55:51] like to sing i haven't really practiced
[55:54] it too much
[55:55] but
[55:59] you may be seated
[56:05] up some words here
[56:10] you know just reminded throughout this
[56:11] year and
[56:15] you know we have we've had covid and
[56:17] we've had
[56:18] ups and downs and disappointments um
[56:23] uh when zion was talking about trials
[56:25] and tests and how we do
[56:26] you know through the tests and it just
[56:28] spoke to me i've been um
[56:30] last three months been dealing with a
[56:32] bulging disc
[56:34] in the bottom of my neck and i if you've
[56:36] ever dealt with that that's
[56:38] well that's trial that's trial so three
[56:41] months of
[56:42] you know pain level two or greater you
[56:45] know and it just pretty much uh
[56:48] just pretty much never ends you know we
[56:51] gotta deal with that sometimes
[56:52] we go through trials and we go through
[56:54] pains and loved ones are taken away from
[56:56] us and
[56:58] and we recognize that it's hard and you
[57:00] know i think sometimes especially here
[57:02] in the u.s
[57:03] maybe god allows these things to just
[57:06] remind us
[57:07] this isn't home this isn't home
[57:12] don't get too happy here we're pilgrims
[57:15] and strangers seeking a city
[57:17] that is to come we're looking for jesus
[57:21] to come and take us to a home
[57:23] away from here you know he's coming in
[57:26] that buck board wagon and we should have
[57:28] the wedding garments on
[57:29] to get on and say yes take me to that
[57:32] mansion you prepared
[57:34] and so we're just reminded of that i
[57:37] think in particularly in 2020 that was
[57:39] to me just a reminder that this isn't
[57:42] our home
[57:44] and so this song is you may have heard
[57:47] it but it just seems like such a
[57:48] blessing to me
[57:49] it's called almost home
[58:06] so
[58:11] are you disappointed
[58:15] are you desperate for hell
[58:21] you know what it's like to be tired and
[58:24] only a shell of yourself
[58:29] when you start to believe
[58:34] you don't have what it takes
[58:37] [Music]
[58:40] cause it's all you can do just to move
[58:43] much less finish the race but don't
[58:52] forget
[58:54] what lies ahead
[59:00] almost home
[59:03] brother it won't be
[59:06] long soon all your burdens
[59:11] will be gone
[59:18] with all your strength
[59:21] sister run on your
[59:25] free hold up your head
[59:28] keep pressing
[59:34] [Applause]
[59:37] [Music]
[59:45] in the end
[59:46] [Music]
[59:49] simply because of jesus
[59:52] in us it's not if but when
[59:57] so take joy in the journey
[1:00:02] even when it feels long
[1:00:07] oh find strength in each step knowing
[1:00:10] heaven is
[1:00:11] cheering you
[1:00:16] we are almost home
[1:00:20] brother it won't be
[1:00:24] long soon all your burdens

[1:04:00] won't even try

[1:04:11] here i appreciate you
[1:04:12] all and
[1:04:15] amen love you so exodus chapter 3
[1:04:21] verses 1-10 moses kept the flock of
[1:04:24] jethro his father-in-law the priest of
[1:04:25] midian
[1:04:26] and he led the flock to the back side of
[1:04:28] the desert and came to the mountain of
[1:04:29] god even to horeb
[1:04:31] and the angel of the lord appeared unto
[1:04:33] him in a flame of fire out of the midst
[1:04:35] of a bush
[1:04:36] and he looked and behold the bush burned
[1:04:38] with fire and the bush was not consumed
[1:04:41] and moses said i will now turn aside and
[1:04:42] see this great sight why the bush is not
[1:04:44] burnt
[1:04:45] and when the lord saw that he turned
[1:04:47] aside to sea
[1:04:48] god called unto him out of the midst of
[1:04:50] the bush and said moses moses
[1:04:53] and he said here am i and he said draw
[1:04:55] not nigh hither
[1:04:56] put off thy shoes from off thy feet for
[1:04:58] the place where on thou standest is holy
[1:05:00] ground
[1:05:01] moreover he said i am the god of thy
[1:05:03] father the god of abraham the god of
[1:05:04] isaac and the god of jacob
[1:05:06] and moses hid his face for he was afraid
[1:05:08] to look upon god
[1:05:09] and the lord said i have surely seen the
[1:05:12] affliction of my people
[1:05:13] which are in egypt and have heard their
[1:05:15] cry by reason of their taskmasters
[1:05:17] for i know their sorrows and i am come
[1:05:19] down to deliver them out of the hand of
[1:05:21] the egyptians and to bring them up
[1:05:23] out of that land into a good land and a
[1:05:24] large a land flowing with milk and honey
[1:05:27] into the place of the canaanites
[1:05:28] hittites amorites perizzites hivites and
[1:05:31] jebusites
[1:05:32] now therefore behold the cry of the
[1:05:33] children of israel has come unto me
[1:05:36] and i have also seen the oppression
[1:05:37] where with the egyptians oppress them
[1:05:39] come now therefore and i will send thee
[1:05:41] unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring
[1:05:43] forth my people
[1:05:44] the children of israel out of egypt can
[1:05:47] we bow
[1:05:48] our head for worst prayer heavenly
[1:05:50] father
[1:05:53] lord i just pray that we would have a
[1:05:54] similar moment
[1:05:56] this morning in this service that moses
[1:05:59] had
[1:06:00] you said in your word that where two or
[1:06:02] three were gathered in your name you
[1:06:03] would be in their midst father
[1:06:06] father is that any different than how
[1:06:09] moses
[1:06:11] was there with you on this mountain
[1:06:14] lord i pray that you would open our eyes
[1:06:16] to see you in our midst
[1:06:18] lord that it would cause us to humble
[1:06:21] our hearts before you
[1:06:23] and that we would that you would speak
[1:06:25] to us in the same way lord and then it
[1:06:26] would change us in the same way that it
[1:06:28] changed moses
[1:06:30] lord that's what this is all about not
[1:06:31] about religion not about
[1:06:34] ethics but father it's about an
[1:06:35] experience with you
[1:06:37] it's about knowing the one that created
[1:06:40] us
[1:06:41] and you created us for a specific
[1:06:43] purpose father so that we could fulfill
[1:06:45] that purpose we
[1:06:46] must know you and what you have for us
[1:06:48] so father would you come in our midst
[1:06:49] now and
[1:06:50] anoint me to speak o god father that it
[1:06:54] wouldn't just be emotions
[1:06:56] though lord we want to have a good time
[1:06:57] and we want to feel good in service we
[1:07:00] want to shout we want to praise you we
[1:07:01] want to worship you father but
[1:07:03] lord may the living reality of almighty
[1:07:05] god the
[1:07:07] spirit working in conjunction with the
[1:07:09] word come and just be that pillar of
[1:07:11] fire and light
[1:07:12] and set ablaze in each of our hearts oh
[1:07:14] god
[1:07:15] that's what we're looking for lord we're
[1:07:17] looking for you
[1:07:20] the one we love the one we're looking
[1:07:22] forward to come and take us home
[1:07:24] so father would you come into our midst
[1:07:25] now and move on us we ask it in jesus
[1:07:28] name
[1:07:29] amen amen you may be seated
[1:07:35] so this morning i want to take a a a
[1:07:37] title of uh
[1:07:39] of meet god meet
[1:07:42] god just a simple thought really um
[1:07:47] i i had i had you know when you as an
[1:07:49] evangelist
[1:07:50] when you travel around a lot of times
[1:07:53] what you do is you take your
[1:07:55] you know your your your number one
[1:07:57] sermon you know the one that had the
[1:07:58] most punch and the one that had the most
[1:08:00] you know uh whatever it it might be you
[1:08:03] know that you think had the most
[1:08:04] response of the people and
[1:08:06] and that's probably the one that you
[1:08:07] preached 20 times during that year you
[1:08:09] know in 20
[1:08:10] different churches and you preach the
[1:08:11] same sermon some brothers don't
[1:08:13] don't really agree with that they want
[1:08:14] something fresh but you know i'm i'm the
[1:08:16] message teacher you know or
[1:08:18] a message teacher not the you know um
[1:08:21] you know so
[1:08:22] so and we we have we have great debates
[1:08:25] at their the church in new albany you
[1:08:27] know we we had a
[1:08:28] when some of the young ministers after
[1:08:30] they had been ordained we had a
[1:08:32] minister's meeting kind of to encourage
[1:08:33] the young brothers you know and
[1:08:35] and uh brother attila one of our our
[1:08:37] brothers from romania as a minister
[1:08:38] there and
[1:08:39] he began telling the brothers you know
[1:08:40] what he does to prepare for a sermon how
[1:08:42] he studies and things like that but
[1:08:44] that he doesn't really take too much for
[1:08:46] notes when he goes to the pulpit
[1:08:47] because he wants you know to just the
[1:08:49] anointing to come and just take his
[1:08:51] bible and preach out of the word of god
[1:08:53] and it's just like hey man and i sat
[1:08:54] there going
[1:08:55] man that don't look a thing like what i
[1:08:57] do i'm like
[1:08:59] what what you just said scares me
[1:09:03] i would never do that brother you know
[1:09:06] maybe i'm less spiritual or than you or
[1:09:08] something but brother i ain't doing that
[1:09:10] you know you know and and so we just
[1:09:13] began to tell the the young brothers
[1:09:14] it's like hey it
[1:09:16] however god works in your life whatever
[1:09:17] that gift is and we're all different and
[1:09:19] and
[1:09:20] and so many of us you know so me i have
[1:09:22] a fairly scripted sermon because it's
[1:09:24] something that i'm teaching and you just
[1:09:26] you know you've got to be pretty precise
[1:09:28] on things you know you can't just
[1:09:29] fly off the cuff and and you know or
[1:09:31] people going to get confused so you know
[1:09:34] you should have it fairly ordered and
[1:09:35] logical and
[1:09:36] and things like that and that's just
[1:09:37] kind of the way i am so so i thought
[1:09:39] well i'll just bring you know kind of my
[1:09:41] you know premier teaching of the year
[1:09:43] and that's probably just what we'll
[1:09:45] we'll do and we'll we'll talk about you
[1:09:47] know uh what is it rejection
[1:09:49] deception redemption see that's a great
[1:09:51] title right i mean who doesn't want to
[1:09:53] hear that sermon
[1:09:54] you all are like great now you've told
[1:09:56] us that but you're not going to preach
[1:09:57] that see
[1:09:58] and and well sorry
[1:10:01] but i think it was wednesday night maybe
[1:10:03] thursday night i think wednesday night i
[1:10:05] i had a dream and um
[1:10:09] i don't really even remember the dream
[1:10:10] too much but i remember it was a very
[1:10:13] disturbing dream
[1:10:14] i remember waking up i'd actually
[1:10:15] remember like i
[1:10:17] you know it's one of those ones where i
[1:10:18] kind of woke up and was like oh i hate
[1:10:20] this you know but you fall back to sleep
[1:10:21] and when you fall back to sleep you're
[1:10:22] still in the same dream
[1:10:24] and it's like all right i hate to wake
[1:10:25] myself up more
[1:10:27] uh but i'm waking myself up more because
[1:10:28] i ain't going back into this joker
[1:10:30] this is just dumb and so kind of got
[1:10:33] myself out of that and you know just
[1:10:34] started kind of praying it's like lord
[1:10:35] just
[1:10:36] you know calm my spirit you know be here
[1:10:38] with me and
[1:10:40] and then you know is this the thoughts
[1:10:42] you know in your in your head at 2 a.m
[1:10:44] or whatever time it is
[1:10:45] and then you're you're saying lord just
[1:10:47] just calm me and then of course you're
[1:10:49] you're you're you're thinking well who
[1:10:51] am i asking you know is
[1:10:53] is there really someone out there that's
[1:10:55] going to come and just you know somehow
[1:10:56] supernaturally calm me or am i just
[1:10:58] going to have to breathe and
[1:11:00] you know get my mind on something else
[1:11:01] you know is it true is this
[1:11:03] is this is there really a god out there
[1:11:04] that's going to come and actually
[1:11:06] spend time calming me down from a dumb
[1:11:09] dream that i had then of course you
[1:11:12] begin to think well yeah but the
[1:11:13] alternative is to think that we're all
[1:11:15] here randomly by chance and
[1:11:17] uh i can't do that come on and you begin
[1:11:20] to just
[1:11:21] remember god and you you know we we and
[1:11:24] i'm just being honest you know maybe you
[1:11:25] don't think things like that at 2am but
[1:11:27] i'm
[1:11:28] i'm guessing that every one of us
[1:11:29] probably at times
[1:11:31] you know it's like really you know when
[1:11:34] you're lying on your floor at 2 a.m
[1:11:37] and the pain levels somewhere around a
[1:11:39] six or a seven and you've got the
[1:11:40] heating pad on your back
[1:11:42] and you're saying jesus by your stripes
[1:11:45] i'm healed
[1:11:47] but that pain level ain't going anywhere
[1:11:50] you start saying lord why
[1:11:54] lord is the reason i still have pain
[1:11:57] because you're not real
[1:11:59] or or or is is it truly that you just
[1:12:02] want me to go through this trial or
[1:12:03] or what's it all about lord and your
[1:12:05] mind goes through all kinds of things
[1:12:07] you know
[1:12:09] amen amen i mean you know
[1:12:12] you know wait wait brother jack the
[1:12:14] preacher you had for us this morning is
[1:12:16] telling us
[1:12:17] that he doubts god at 2 a.m when he's in
[1:12:20] pain
[1:12:21] could we get another one
[1:12:25] but it's real right like these things
[1:12:27] happen you can't you know
[1:12:29] are these my thoughts are these the
[1:12:30] devil's thoughts like i i don't know
[1:12:33] but i know they come in my head yeah
[1:12:35] yeah
[1:12:37] and i know i throw them out right but
[1:12:39] that don't mean they're not there
[1:12:40] that doesn't mean that it's not hard
[1:12:42] sometimes
[1:12:44] and so so in these times that we're
[1:12:46] disturbed in these times that we're in
[1:12:48] pain and in these times when we're
[1:12:50] uncertain and the future looks unclear
[1:12:51] because
[1:12:52] moses is in a spot here where his future
[1:12:54] is very unclear
[1:12:55] his past has a lot of pain in it you
[1:12:57] know he he grows up and
[1:12:59] and being told that he's going to be
[1:13:02] something and then it doesn't work out
[1:13:03] and now
[1:13:04] he's there wandering in a desert and
[1:13:06] yeah he's married now and he's got kids
[1:13:08] but you know his wife has a temper
[1:13:11] and just sometimes you know it's just
[1:13:13] like man
[1:13:15] you know i miss the the baths of egypt
[1:13:18] or the whatever it might be you know
[1:13:20] like what have i done
[1:13:23] lord if i'm truly supposed to deliver
[1:13:26] where's my army
[1:13:29] wow how am i going to do this god
[1:13:33] i've already failed once you probably
[1:13:35] don't even want me
[1:13:36] you know what's it all about like are
[1:13:39] you
[1:13:40] real lord like is it is this even a
[1:13:42] reality like come on
[1:13:46] how's this gonna happen god
[1:13:51] and we get there sometimes and we get
[1:13:53] there sometimes and moses now he
[1:13:56] he comes and you know so so like i said
[1:13:59] you know here i have this disturbing
[1:14:00] dream and i begin to think these kinds
[1:14:02] of things and i'm reminding myself it's
[1:14:04] no you you've met god you know he's real
[1:14:06] you know he's true you've
[1:14:08] you've seen him work a little temporary
[1:14:12] pain
[1:14:12] doesn't doesn't somehow go through the
[1:14:14] cosmos and obliterate the existence of
[1:14:16] god
[1:14:17] it just means that absolutely god is
[1:14:20] true because
[1:14:21] because man fell in the garden of eden
[1:14:23] and now we're subject to the curse
[1:14:29] and you can have a you can have a disc
[1:14:31] bulging and rupture in your neck
[1:14:34] why because man fell in the garden of
[1:14:36] eden
[1:14:38] and so actually pain only just proves
[1:14:41] the existence of god even more
[1:14:43] [Applause]
[1:14:46] and so i began to think about this and i
[1:14:48] you know no i can't i can't talk
[1:14:50] i've got to just there's and i just felt
[1:14:52] that this there's
[1:14:53] it's here i've got to preach this sermon
[1:14:56] about meeting god here
[1:14:57] and i think some of the examples that
[1:14:59] i've i'll use today you've
[1:15:01] maybe some of you have seen i think i've
[1:15:02] probably used some of them over the
[1:15:04] years but
[1:15:05] but i just really feel that it's for for
[1:15:07] you all today amen
[1:15:08] that god just directed this and wants
[1:15:12] this
[1:15:12] so someone here this is for you it might
[1:15:15] just be one of you
[1:15:16] maybe it's all of you i don't know but i
[1:15:18] believe that god really wants this
[1:15:21] for us so so so here's moses now he's
[1:15:24] he's in the he's in the wilderness you
[1:15:26] know he's on the back side of the desert
[1:15:28] he's
[1:15:28] watching uh jethro's sheep and he's
[1:15:30] married now he's got a couple of
[1:15:32] children and
[1:15:33] and you know nothing has worked out
[1:15:35] right in his life and he's questioning
[1:15:37] you know where where god is and all of
[1:15:39] this and how is he supposed to be a
[1:15:40] deliverer and if there's
[1:15:41] if these prophecies are real where's the
[1:15:44] fruit man
[1:15:50] and then he sees a bush that isn't
[1:15:51] burning well that's strange and
[1:15:53] goodness that's odd like i guess i'm
[1:15:55] gonna go check that out you know and so
[1:15:57] he goes and he
[1:15:58] he looks at this burning bush and
[1:16:01] and and god begins to speak to him out
[1:16:04] of this burning bush
[1:16:06] now how do we know that this actually
[1:16:08] happened
[1:16:11] because moses told us
[1:16:15] amen amen yeah that's the only reason
[1:16:18] moses told us
[1:16:19] so you believe that just because on the
[1:16:20] report of one man just
[1:16:24] i don't know if that says anything to
[1:16:25] you all but you know when you think
[1:16:26] these things you just got to stop there
[1:16:28] for just a moment
[1:16:28] and you know you can extrapolate that
[1:16:30] there's things that we believe because
[1:16:32] brother branham told
[1:16:33] amen
[1:16:37] right so so we believe this happened
[1:16:39] because moses told us now
[1:16:40] now but but but but it's more than that
[1:16:42] isn't it because
[1:16:44] because actually history bears record
[1:16:46] that there was a people that came out of
[1:16:48] egypt and and there's historical and
[1:16:50] archaeological evidence that
[1:16:52] that talk about this there's histories
[1:16:54] that talk about these
[1:16:56] these things that have happened so so
[1:16:58] actually
[1:16:59] this you see what what happens is this
[1:17:02] moses comes in contact with god
[1:17:04] moses has an experience with god and
[1:17:06] moses meets god
[1:17:08] you see it's more now it's it's more
[1:17:10] than just the training of his mother
[1:17:12] but you know he's now taking that leap
[1:17:14] of faith that we talked about last night
[1:17:17] that now moses is coming into a place
[1:17:19] where he's recognizing there's more
[1:17:22] to the eye than just what you see here
[1:17:24] on the world
[1:17:25] but but that god is real and now he's
[1:17:27] coming he's
[1:17:28] met god
[1:17:32] and that one man meeting god
[1:17:35] changed the course of the history of the
[1:17:38] entire world
[1:17:40] because one man met god you see that's
[1:17:44] that's a big thing and and that's truly
[1:17:47] what god wants for all of us
[1:17:49] is for each one of us to meet him in the
[1:17:52] same way
[1:17:52] that moses met him now maybe you don't
[1:17:55] see a pillar of fire burning in a bush
[1:17:57] but you should have the same experience
[1:18:00] that moses had
[1:18:01] up there on mount sinai you see
[1:18:04] you know if someone were to come and ask
[1:18:06] you
[1:18:08] young man what's your name i'm sorry
[1:18:12] josiah josiah if someone were to ask you
[1:18:17] go take over russia
[1:18:23] think you could do it give you a stick
[1:18:27] big one nice tall hefty
[1:18:31] hit people with it it's not feeling it
[1:18:35] he's not feeling it
[1:18:36] come come on
[1:18:43] you ever think about how moses fell
[1:18:47] how god how am i gonna how am i gonna
[1:18:49] deliver all these people god
[1:18:52] like i said you know where's the army
[1:18:54] god like
[1:18:55] it's gonna take something no i'm gonna
[1:18:58] send you
[1:18:59] this stick and your brother
[1:19:10] you know somebody's feeling confident
[1:19:12] this morning it isn't me god
[1:19:16] i mean these are thoughts that i'm
[1:19:17] thinking i would have had you know like
[1:19:19] like lord great plan
[1:19:24] not feeling it
[1:19:28] but he does it right but
[1:19:31] now because he's met almighty god he's
[1:19:34] able to take a staff
[1:19:36] and he goes he doesn't doubt
[1:19:39] why because he's met god because the
[1:19:43] experience of that
[1:19:44] puts something behind him and something
[1:19:47] in him that gives him the confidence
[1:19:49] that even if he doesn't understand he
[1:19:51] puts the staff down and takes a step
[1:19:53] towards egypt
[1:19:54] [Music]
[1:19:57] and he continues to press on and
[1:19:59] absolutely goes and delivers the people
[1:20:02] why
[1:20:02] because he met god because it was
[1:20:06] there was a reality of it
[1:20:09] you see josiah doesn't want to go take
[1:20:12] over russia even if i give him a stick
[1:20:14] because you know like
[1:20:15] it's trevor asking him like who cares
[1:20:18] man
[1:20:19] like you want me to take over russia
[1:20:20] yeah and who are you
[1:20:23] and why should i listen to you
[1:20:27] but you know
[1:20:31] sometimes you know who's asking us makes
[1:20:34] a difference
[1:20:36] so brother brother josue if i asked you
[1:20:39] for a pizza
[1:20:40] would you buy me a pizza if
[1:20:46] if what's that
[1:20:51] can't handle that sun-dried tomatoes and
[1:20:54] roasted red peppers
[1:20:57] oh we got something all right fresh
[1:20:59] mozzarella
[1:21:00] all right i'll see i'll eat your
[1:21:02] vegetarian pizza
[1:21:03] i'm even good with a cauliflower crust
[1:21:07] [Music]
[1:21:10] my status can buy me a vegetarian pizza
[1:21:13] who i am and with regards to brother
[1:21:16] josue can get me
[1:21:17] a vegetarian pizza if i if i if i
[1:21:20] really came to you and say brother would
[1:21:22] you help me out i
[1:21:23] i need a tank of gas would you buy me a
[1:21:26] tank of gas
[1:21:27] i have a large car 26 gallon tank
[1:21:31] so my status with josue gets me
[1:21:34] a tank of gas and a vegetarian pizza
[1:21:37] would you go climb everest brother
[1:21:42] my status does not get a climb up mount
[1:21:44] everest
[1:21:46] who i am is not enough
[1:21:51] it's not enough
[1:21:55] but if god comes you see if someone with
[1:21:57] sufficient authority
[1:21:59] someone with a sufficient power were to
[1:22:02] come and ask
[1:22:03] come on suddenly that's different now
[1:22:05] like okay
[1:22:07] you know suddenly okay lord i'll go
[1:22:10] why because it's you because you're the
[1:22:13] one asking
[1:22:15] and and you see then so then if you
[1:22:17] really truly recognize who god is
[1:22:20] when you meet that's him
[1:22:24] you see sometimes you know you see well
[1:22:26] god's asking me to do this but
[1:22:28] i mean i don't know like dressing
[1:22:31] holiness and
[1:22:32] you know all of these things that that
[1:22:34] that
[1:22:35] that the message is asking me to do well
[1:22:38] is it the message
[1:22:39] asking you to do it or is it almighty
[1:22:41] god
[1:22:42] and so when you can recognize that it's
[1:22:44] almighty god
[1:22:46] and not just the message
[1:22:50] then suddenly it's like oh okay i'll
[1:22:52] take over egypt
[1:22:54] and i'll do it in a skirt fine
[1:22:57] [Music]
[1:23:01] no problem god that's what you want
[1:23:03] that's what you can
[1:23:04] like yes okay brother trevor asks you to
[1:23:08] do that and you're like yeah
[1:23:09] brother jack get us another one get
[1:23:11] another evangelist in here i don't like
[1:23:13] this one
[1:23:14] he's not enough but if the spirit of
[1:23:17] almighty god can come in this room today
[1:23:20] and witness the word of god to your
[1:23:22] heart
[1:23:23] that's different and if you can
[1:23:25] recognize that's him
[1:23:27] and what he's asking of you man that'll
[1:23:29] just change everything
[1:23:33] man so
[1:23:38] you know
[1:23:41] at some point you got to know the person
[1:23:44] that's asking you
[1:23:46] what they're asking okay that's great
[1:23:48] you can ask all you want for me to go
[1:23:50] take over russia but
[1:23:52] no but god comes oh that's different
[1:23:55] that's different so so it's not the
[1:23:58] request that changes
[1:24:00] it's not you that changes
[1:24:04] everything's the same the only
[1:24:07] difference
[1:24:08] is is when you've come and met him
[1:24:12] amen because the one you know the one
[1:24:14] asking moses
[1:24:16] to deliver the children of israel he
[1:24:18] hadn't changed
[1:24:21] the only thing that changed is moses
[1:24:24] met him at some point he became a
[1:24:28] reality to moses
[1:24:30] and when that happened moses changed the
[1:24:33] world
[1:24:36] amen amen amen
[1:24:39] now a personal experience with god
[1:24:41] brother madam says now
[1:24:42] watch faith take a hold right quick
[1:24:46] the old things are passed away
[1:24:49] but moses now has a new vision
[1:24:52] he has a revelation he has an experience
[1:24:56] he had met god he had talked
[1:24:59] to god before that he had not met god
[1:25:03] he'd only read and knowed what his
[1:25:05] mother had told him
[1:25:06] by hearing what his mother had said
[1:25:09] hearing what the pastor had said
[1:25:11] but now moses has a personal experience
[1:25:15] so moses comes out of that ethic stage
[1:25:17] and he comes into that leap of faith
[1:25:19] stage
[1:25:21] moses comes into a place where where
[1:25:23] what he had heard
[1:25:24] has now become real to him
[1:25:28] amen that's where we gotta be
[1:25:32] and you say well brother trevor what
[1:25:35] does that mean for me
[1:25:37] i don't know what that means for you but
[1:25:41] but whatever god is asking you to do
[1:25:43] even the things that you might be
[1:25:45] struggling with
[1:25:47] don't try to fix you
[1:25:50] meet god meet god
[1:25:55] you see meeting god makes just
[1:25:58] it makes you do crazy things it makes
[1:26:00] you do things you'd never
[1:26:01] you'd never you'd never think you know
[1:26:04] so let's let's talk about brother
[1:26:05] brother branham mentions a man
[1:26:08] by the name of john sherrod and many of
[1:26:11] you
[1:26:11] probably recognize this name and you
[1:26:14] probably recognize it in context with
[1:26:16] the tree
[1:26:16] that was at brother john sherrod's ranch
[1:26:18] that was an orange tree
[1:26:20] but it had grafted in angelos and it
[1:26:22] grafted in all these other citrus lemons
[1:26:24] and
[1:26:24] you know all of these other fruits
[1:26:25] grapefruits whatever it is you know
[1:26:27] citrus fruits
[1:26:28] grafted in but if the tree ever puts out
[1:26:30] another branch
[1:26:31] it's going to be oranges because that's
[1:26:32] the original right so we're all very
[1:26:34] familiar with that but
[1:26:35] but less familiar sometimes we are with
[1:26:38] the story
[1:26:39] of brother john sharon's upbringing
[1:26:40] brother john chair was a very poor man
[1:26:43] he brother brown says he busted concrete
[1:26:45] as a job
[1:26:46] for 25 cents an all hour
[1:26:50] there's not much i'm doing for 25 cents
[1:26:52] an hour
[1:26:54] busting concrete sure isn't it
[1:26:58] that sounds terrible brother john
[1:27:02] sherrod busting concrete for 25 cents an
[1:27:04] hour he doesn't talk well he's
[1:27:05] you know he doesn't think too much of
[1:27:07] himself he's not very educated and
[1:27:09] so he's busting concrete begins to save
[1:27:11] up money saves up fifteen hundred
[1:27:13] dollars
[1:27:14] him and his wife buy a house right
[1:27:18] i don't know how long it takes i could
[1:27:19] do the math at some point but 25 cents
[1:27:21] an hour
[1:27:22] 1500 like man that's a long time of
[1:27:25] busting concrete
[1:27:26] long time you know what that house is
[1:27:28] gonna mean to you after you've busted
[1:27:29] concrete at 25 cents an hour for fifteen
[1:27:31] hundred dollars
[1:27:32] man this house is a mansion
[1:27:36] this house is amazing paid for this in
[1:27:39] blood sweat and tears
[1:27:42] and then this preacher this was out in
[1:27:44] phoenix area
[1:27:46] and this preacher comes to town and god
[1:27:48] comes and
[1:27:49] tells brother john sherrod i want you to
[1:27:51] give your house take your silverware and
[1:27:53] your wife
[1:27:54] move out of the house give this house
[1:27:57] to this minister that's come into this
[1:28:00] area and is starting to work and
[1:28:01] i i want you to give him your house
[1:28:09] brother solomon you you recently moved
[1:28:11] down to west palm beach right
[1:28:12] did you not yet haven't haven't
[1:28:15] completed in the name of jesus amen
[1:28:17] okay all right all right well who here
[1:28:20] has
[1:28:20] the most recent house purchase so i'm
[1:28:23] gonna pick on you
[1:28:26] brother i feel the lord leading me
[1:28:31] [Music]
[1:28:32] to start a work down here in florida
[1:28:36] could i have your house
[1:28:44] possible possible not likely though
[1:28:48] not likely you're like i haven't been
[1:28:51] paid for the thing
[1:28:55] it's yet big ask isn't it that's crazy
[1:28:59] no one would do that no one would give
[1:29:02] their house
[1:29:04] because a minister comes into that area
[1:29:06] and they had a thought
[1:29:07] you know i should be nice to this
[1:29:10] minister and give him my house
[1:29:13] would anyone do that
[1:29:17] it's ridiculous and maybe that minister
[1:29:20] should try working for a little bit you
[1:29:22] know i mean there's all kinds of
[1:29:23] thoughts you can have in your hand
[1:29:27] i want my house are you kidding me no
[1:29:33] why then does john sharon give this
[1:29:36] minister his house
[1:29:39] and you know it might be one thing if it
[1:29:41] was just him in the house you know i
[1:29:42] mean i can go live under a bridge but i
[1:29:44] don't feel that god has ever called me
[1:29:45] to go live under a bridge with my wife
[1:29:47] and children
[1:29:48] i just i'm like there's scriptures that
[1:29:50] tell me i should provide for them and
[1:29:51] that's
[1:29:53] there's confliction here i don't know
[1:29:54] how to do this but if it's just me like
[1:29:56] that's another thing
[1:29:57] but to take my silverware and my wife
[1:29:59] and and go figure out where to live
[1:30:02] god what no
[1:30:05] john sherrod does this why why does john
[1:30:07] share it do this
[1:30:10] because he met god you don't do crazy
[1:30:13] things like i mean unless you're crazy
[1:30:15] but john chair was not crazy
[1:30:17] like no he did it because he had met god
[1:30:19] because he was sure of the one
[1:30:22] who was telling him to do this so john
[1:30:25] sherrod takes his wife and
[1:30:26] and and silverware as i said and he
[1:30:29] finds
[1:30:30] he finds this uh this woman that needs
[1:30:32] some
[1:30:34] yard work done on her property and she
[1:30:36] says well you can live in my garage so
[1:30:38] he gets some cardboard and different
[1:30:40] things and sets up house
[1:30:42] in this woman's garage and lives there
[1:30:43] for a while and finally
[1:30:45] this woman begins to appreciate him and
[1:30:47] oh and god comes to her
[1:30:49] and says i want you to give john chair
[1:30:51] at ten thousand dollars to start a
[1:30:52] business
[1:30:53] [Laughter]
[1:30:56] uh brother
[1:31:02] i've been i've been wanting to start a
[1:31:03] business
[1:31:08] you got to spare 10 g's that i could
[1:31:10] have
[1:31:14] who does that who gives someone else
[1:31:17] ten thousand dollars and this was back
[1:31:20] in 1950 something
[1:31:23] like what is that today that's like a
[1:31:25] hundred thousand dollars or something
[1:31:26] like that that's
[1:31:30] nobody just does that but this woman was
[1:31:32] convinced
[1:31:33] that it was god it was god telling her
[1:31:38] and so she does it
[1:31:41] at some point we begin to realize that
[1:31:43] we can look at some of these things
[1:31:45] in history we can look at some of these
[1:31:47] things that that have impacted
[1:31:50] the the the world like moses bleeding
[1:31:52] the children of israel out of egypt
[1:31:54] and have to recognize that god is real
[1:31:57] because if he wasn't
[1:31:59] these people would have never done such
[1:32:00] a thing
[1:32:02] amen they would have never done that
[1:32:07] john sharon wouldn't have given up his
[1:32:08] home right he wouldn't have
[1:32:10] he wouldn't have he wouldn't have gotten
[1:32:12] ten thousand dollars from this lady she
[1:32:14] gives him ten thousand dollars and
[1:32:15] he's like what i'm i'm uneducated what
[1:32:18] am i gonna do with ten thousand dollars
[1:32:19] and so
[1:32:20] what does he do he he he he he finally
[1:32:23] he's like okay
[1:32:24] and he buys a house no not for him and
[1:32:27] his wife to live in
[1:32:28] that would have i would have thought
[1:32:30] they would have done that but they
[1:32:31] didn't he buys a house he fixes it up
[1:32:33] and he and he flips it and then
[1:32:36] he starts flipping homes and and and you
[1:32:39] know i think eventually he bought him
[1:32:40] and his wife a house
[1:32:41] you know as a matter of fact then
[1:32:43] suddenly he's somehow he's
[1:32:44] he's got himself to a place where he has
[1:32:46] millions of dollars and he's got all
[1:32:47] these ranches
[1:32:48] that brother branham can come to why
[1:32:51] because god blessed him why did god
[1:32:54] bless him well he met god
[1:33:01] amen did god bless him because he gave
[1:33:04] up his home to this minister
[1:33:07] okay yeah because he met god
[1:33:12] god doesn't bargain god
[1:33:16] god's bigger than that god doesn't have
[1:33:18] like well okay if you uh
[1:33:20] if you uh give up your home uh john
[1:33:22] sherrod you know uh maybe ten years
[1:33:24] later i'll i'll have a million dollar
[1:33:25] ranch for you
[1:33:31] john sherrod should have never given up
[1:33:32] his home for that reason
[1:33:34] so that he could he pay his his
[1:33:36] christian dues so that he could get
[1:33:38] blessed later no
[1:33:39] he did it because he met god
[1:33:42] something way more important than a
[1:33:44] million dollar ranch later
[1:33:46] john cher had met god and that's the
[1:33:49] reason
[1:33:50] he did it not looking for the blessings
[1:33:52] later
[1:33:53] but doing it because the one who he
[1:33:56] loved
[1:33:57] the one who had created him the one who
[1:34:00] he was
[1:34:00] he was he was he knew his life was there
[1:34:03] and
[1:34:03] created to bring him glory asked it of
[1:34:06] him
[1:34:08] the reward later didn't matter
[1:34:13] only thing that mattered was because of
[1:34:16] him
[1:34:18] he asked
[1:34:24] go and if you're there
[1:34:28] you know i think i've told you the story
[1:34:29] about you know me pulling out of the
[1:34:31] driveway once you know and oh there's
[1:34:32] the mailbox and
[1:34:34] you know wonder if there's a check in
[1:34:36] the mailbox and on that check is my name
[1:34:38] and
[1:34:39] one million dollars and driving down the
[1:34:42] road
[1:34:42] going to work thinking about oh lord
[1:34:44] what i would do with that million
[1:34:45] dollars you know i pay off my house a
[1:34:47] full-time ministry then you know lord a
[1:34:49] million dollars would just go a long way
[1:34:50] to me serving you
[1:34:52] and this is what's going on in my head
[1:34:53] and then suddenly i realized what an
[1:34:55] idiot you are trevor why are you
[1:34:56] thinking you know like you're spending
[1:34:58] five
[1:34:58] ten minutes thinking about the most
[1:35:00] ridiculous thing ever
[1:35:03] if you're off in fantasyland for what
[1:35:07] what's better a million dollars of the
[1:35:10] provision of almighty god
[1:35:13] pretty simple question pretty simple to
[1:35:15] answer that
[1:35:16] we don't always think like that though
[1:35:18] right but when we come into his presence
[1:35:21] when we come and the the bush is burning
[1:35:24] suddenly things are different suddenly
[1:35:27] it's very easy to recognize i want what
[1:35:28] you want i don't care about a million
[1:35:30] dollars
[1:35:31] as long as you're there as long as
[1:35:32] you're asking everything's fine
[1:35:35] as long as i'm in your hands
[1:35:36] everything's fine because you
[1:35:40] because you are i am then all is well
[1:35:44] and he is i am
[1:35:48] and there's no qualifications there's no
[1:35:51] quantifications
[1:35:52] there's no he's i am for me but he might
[1:35:54] not be i am for you no he is i
[1:35:56] am and when we come and we get to a
[1:36:00] place where we recognize
[1:36:02] who we are in light of i am
[1:36:05] and we meet the i am
[1:36:08] not the i was not the i will be but the
[1:36:11] i
[1:36:11] am who is he now i am
[1:36:15] suddenly everything's different millions
[1:36:18] of dollars don't matter the house don't
[1:36:20] matter
[1:36:23] that's hard to say that's hard to really
[1:36:25] feel
[1:36:26] why because we don't know him enough
[1:36:31] so we're not as used to his presence as
[1:36:33] we ought to be
[1:36:35] that's what changes things that's what
[1:36:37] changed moses is what changed john share
[1:36:39] it that's what changed this woman
[1:36:40] as they got into the presence of god and
[1:36:43] recognized the i am was there
[1:36:45] yes sir and in in his presence
[1:36:49] egypt can be leveled in his presence
[1:36:53] you can give a house away in his
[1:36:55] presence you can give ten thousand
[1:36:56] dollars
[1:36:58] and it's okay why i am
[1:37:03] but how often do we think of him as i am
[1:37:05] as all-encompassing as
[1:37:06] as everything that that ever was and
[1:37:08] ever is and all that matters is him
[1:37:10] no so many times we get so me centric
[1:37:13] and we think about me
[1:37:14] and what i need and god i need you to
[1:37:16] heal me
[1:37:19] i need you to take my problems away god
[1:37:22] and if you don't i'll begin to doubt who
[1:37:24] you are and whether or not you're even
[1:37:25] real and
[1:37:26] where things are at lord this pain hurts
[1:37:30] am i thinking about him as the i am and
[1:37:32] that's in that scenario
[1:37:36] no i'm thinking about him as in the
[1:37:39] who you can do what you can do for me
[1:37:41] and yeah who you are for me
[1:37:45] should we think about him like that no
[1:37:48] no does he care about us yes
[1:37:51] will he take the pain away yes sometimes
[1:37:54] he'll just hold our hand through the
[1:37:56] trial
[1:37:57] sometimes he'll just take it away
[1:38:00] hey man but he's the i am
[1:38:03] he's wonderful he's everything so so we
[1:38:06] need to get ourselves then to a place
[1:38:10] where we meet god like moses
[1:38:13] where we meet god like john shared where
[1:38:15] it becomes a living reality to us
[1:38:18] that we're living in a place
[1:38:21] where it's not just religion anymore
[1:38:25] but we're dwelling in the i am we're
[1:38:28] dwelling in him so
[1:38:29] so how how can we know him then like
[1:38:32] okay we
[1:38:32] we talked about we need to meet him and
[1:38:34] you know but isn't that what we've done
[1:38:36] like in that with church and altar and
[1:38:38] you know baptism holy spirit like you

[1:45:55] that
[1:45:55] in joseph right why
[1:45:59] because i've met him you've met him
[1:46:05] [Music]
[1:46:10] crazy
[1:46:13] how about you you've seen his works
[1:46:16] you've read his word i've heard
[1:46:20] heard it preached over and over
[1:46:23] and over and over again
[1:46:27] rebecca how old are you 26
[1:46:32] 26 times 52 weeks a year
[1:46:36] uh that's a lot uh
[1:46:40] times well we got it right here this was
[1:46:42] just uh
[1:46:45] let's see here rebecca is uh
[1:46:49] 26 times 52 weeks a year
[1:46:54] times three services a week
[1:46:57] uh 4056 if the
[1:47:00] calculator is correct and i did it right
[1:47:02] 4056
[1:47:04] services that you've been in and now you
[1:47:06] could say give or take yeah but
[1:47:08] you know there's special meetings and
[1:47:09] things like that so you know maybe
[1:47:11] you weren't always in service three
[1:47:13] times a week but you were in service
[1:47:14] more than three times a week other times
[1:47:16] for 26 years
[1:47:19] some of you all have been in church that
[1:47:20] many times some of you have all heard
[1:47:23] over 4 000
[1:47:24] sermons in your life maybe you've even
[1:47:27] heard
[1:47:27] over 400 500 tapes maybe you've heard
[1:47:30] over a thousand tapes god bless you i
[1:47:32] hope you have
[1:47:34] but at some point
[1:47:37] you got to move from i've heard it
[1:47:41] i've seen it to the same experience that
[1:47:44] moses has
[1:47:46] to the same experience that moses has
[1:47:48] and you say brother trevor i don't know
[1:47:50] how well
[1:47:51] well how did they meet they got into the
[1:47:55] same place one day
[1:47:57] and ran across each other you say
[1:47:59] brother trevor but but but i can't just
[1:48:00] see god walking down the street like
[1:48:02] that
[1:48:03] but but does that mean he's not real
[1:48:08] he's real he's a person and you can meet
[1:48:12] him
[1:48:13] and your experience with him ought to be
[1:48:15] as real as
[1:48:16] as abby and joseph have met each other
[1:48:20] because moses had that kind of an
[1:48:22] experience we need only look at that
[1:48:24] experience and know
[1:48:25] that moses actually met god in a
[1:48:28] different way
[1:48:29] and at the at the burning bush there on
[1:48:31] mount sinai
[1:48:32] and and i can meet god in the same way
[1:48:36] and that happened because history and
[1:48:37] archaeology bears it out so if it
[1:48:38] happened for moses it can happen for me
[1:48:41] and many many other men and women
[1:48:43] throughout the bible have done amazing
[1:48:45] things why because
[1:48:46] they met god changed the situation amen
[1:48:53] you see this is the reality of it and
[1:48:55] what we must have
[1:48:56] first john 2 3 and 4 you see knowing god
[1:49:00] changes us it changes our reactions and
[1:49:02] how we live
[1:49:04] first john 2 3 and 4 says hereby we do
[1:49:07] know
[1:49:07] that we know him if we keep his
[1:49:10] commandments
[1:49:12] he that saith i know him and keepeth not
[1:49:14] his commandments is a liar and the truth
[1:49:16] is not in him so when we begin to keep
[1:49:17] his commandments
[1:49:18] not just from duty but because we know
[1:49:21] him
[1:49:22] yes sir why because keeping his
[1:49:24] commandments isn't grievous when we know
[1:49:26] who he is
[1:49:27] because to know him you understand his
[1:49:29] character and why he would even ask you
[1:49:31] to do those things anyway
[1:49:33] amen hey man so
[1:49:37] so you know think of it think of it as
[1:49:39] is as a husband and wife
[1:49:42] when they meet is that so difficult
[1:49:45] you know to remember to close the
[1:49:47] cabinet doors
[1:49:50] you know when your wife she looks at you
[1:49:52] and says hey could you please close the
[1:49:54] cabinet door sure
[1:49:56] absolutely is that a rule could be
[1:50:00] do you mind so much not if she'll keep
[1:50:03] smiling
[1:50:04] you know it's all good you just keep
[1:50:06] smiling i'll close
[1:50:07] the cabinet door everything that's great
[1:50:10] once you begin to know the person you
[1:50:13] begin to change yourself why because of
[1:50:15] love
[1:50:16] and when you begin to know god god who
[1:50:19] is
[1:50:20] love he begins to change you
[1:50:25] why because of love because you know him
[1:50:27] because you've experienced him and
[1:50:29] because
[1:50:29] because now there's something there
[1:50:31] that's like oh this one
[1:50:33] this one who is so great i long to serve
[1:50:37] him because i like
[1:50:38] to be near him and i like to please him
[1:50:40] i like him to just keep smiling so yes
[1:50:42] i'll close the cabinet door
[1:50:46] metaphorically speaking in my life you
[1:50:48] understand
[1:50:50] amen from that time brother branham says
[1:50:53] this didn't only change moses
[1:50:56] it changed israel it changed egypt
[1:50:59] it changed the world at that time
[1:51:01] because one man
[1:51:02] met god and took him at his word
[1:51:06] one man met god and took him at his word
[1:51:08] changes the entire world
[1:51:11] amen there's a man in history by the
[1:51:15] name of felix
[1:51:17] and he was uh he was in uh 303
[1:51:20] a.d and he was martyred and you could
[1:51:24] find the story in
[1:51:25] in fox's book of martyrs and
[1:51:28] felix was was um
[1:51:31] a roman priest the brother of another
[1:51:34] priest and he was ordered to sacrifice
[1:51:35] to the gods
[1:51:37] and so he was brought before the prefect
[1:51:39] to the temples of serapis
[1:51:40] mercury and diana but at the prayer of
[1:51:43] the saint
[1:51:44] the idols fell shattered to the ground
[1:51:47] he was then led to execution so here's
[1:51:50] this man he's
[1:51:51] he's being persecuted and told that if
[1:51:53] he doesn't sacrifice before these gods
[1:51:55] they're going to kill him and so what he
[1:51:57] does is he's brought in this temple and
[1:51:59] he begins to pray
[1:52:00] and before this saint of god these idols
[1:52:03] fall
[1:52:07] on the way to his execution an unknown
[1:52:10] person joined him
[1:52:11] professed himself a christian and also
[1:52:13] received the crown of martyrdom
[1:52:15] the christians gave him the name atticus
[1:52:18] the latin word for added
[1:52:19] and they were both beheaded you say well
[1:52:23] brother trevor what are you talking
[1:52:24] about well this man met god
[1:52:27] because he came into a place that was
[1:52:28] very stressful there was a lot of things
[1:52:30] going on
[1:52:31] there was a lot of pressure you can live
[1:52:33] or you can die it just depends on
[1:52:35] whether or not you're gonna
[1:52:36] be true to this whole jesus christ thing
[1:52:40] so you make your decision and this man
[1:52:42] knows god he's
[1:52:43] met god that there wasn't even a
[1:52:46] decision for him
[1:52:48] there was there didn't even have to be
[1:52:50] stress there for him because he knew god
[1:52:53] he knew the i am you want to kill me
[1:52:54] okay i mean you know
[1:52:56] i'd prefer to live but you know death
[1:52:58] where is thy sting grave where is thy
[1:53:01] victory
[1:53:03] my desire is to depart but maybe being
[1:53:05] here is more needful
[1:53:08] why because he met god and it changes
[1:53:12] how you think
[1:53:13] it changes everything about you and this
[1:53:16] man then just prays to god and the idols
[1:53:18] fall before him
[1:53:20] and it changes the course of another
[1:53:21] man's life and maybe
[1:53:23] god is asking you to get to know him in
[1:53:26] such a way that it changes the course of
[1:53:28] the people around you
[1:53:30] maybe even through times of great
[1:53:32] pressure
[1:53:34] how you react and how you respond saying
[1:53:36] brother trevor yeah i got to work on my
[1:53:38] reactions no you've got to meet god
[1:53:41] amen that'll work on your reactions just
[1:53:43] fine
[1:53:45] amen
[1:53:48] brother branham says and why christ
[1:53:49] speak moses born
[1:53:51] and then he was afterwards he was
[1:53:53] brought to a place where he was anointed
[1:53:56] and notice the seed laying there with an
[1:53:57] intellectual conception with all the
[1:53:59] faith
[1:54:00] that he was born to deliver the people
[1:54:02] yet it never come to life
[1:54:04] until that light from the burning bush
[1:54:07] flashed across it
[1:54:08] until he seen not something he read
[1:54:10] about but something he'd seen with his
[1:54:11] eyes
[1:54:12] something that spoke to him and he spoke
[1:54:14] back to hit
[1:54:16] my how that did bring things
[1:54:19] to life and that's what it's we've got
[1:54:20] to do we've we've got to have that
[1:54:22] coming to life
[1:54:24] experience in our life how does that how
[1:54:27] does that happen
[1:54:28] you've got to get into the presence of
[1:54:30] god you've got to see
[1:54:31] you've got to see him and brother trevor
[1:54:33] how do you see him like i said we can't
[1:54:34] go
[1:54:35] walk down the road and meet him i mean
[1:54:37] you know joseph and abby can easily come
[1:54:39] up to the front of the
[1:54:40] church and shake hands and get to meet
[1:54:41] but how do you how do you meet god and
[1:54:44] we can't physically do that but you can
[1:54:46] spiritually
[1:54:47] and it can be just as real as a physical
[1:54:50] meeting
[1:54:53] amen so first corinthians chapter 2
[1:54:58] verses 10 through 16 but god hath
[1:55:00] revealed them unto us by his spirit
[1:55:03] for the spirit searches all things yea
[1:55:05] the deep things of god
[1:55:07] what man knoweth the things of man save
[1:55:10] the spirit of man which is in him even
[1:55:13] so the things of god knoweth no man
[1:55:15] but the spirit of god so so we look at
[1:55:18] it like this like
[1:55:19] a man knows the things of a man
[1:55:23] so because you you're man mankind
[1:55:28] you know mankind things
[1:55:31] but it takes the spirit of god to know
[1:55:34] the things of god
[1:55:36] you know so we think about like a chimp
[1:55:39] like a chimp doesn't know like a chimp
[1:55:41] kind of seems like a man
[1:55:44] but it doesn't really know man things
[1:55:47] because it doesn't have the spirit of
[1:55:48] man now we're going to illustrate i've
[1:55:50] got a video for you today to illustrate
[1:55:53] this
[1:55:54] so sister tina if we could play this
[1:55:56] video
[1:55:57] of a chimp who doesn't really know the
[1:56:00] things of man
[1:56:16] [Music]
[1:56:20] that was the most edifying video you'll
[1:56:22] see all week
[1:56:29] that scripture right there this chimp
[1:56:32] doesn't know the things of man
[1:56:35] he doesn't understand music
[1:56:38] he can't play notes but he can sit there
[1:56:42] like a man and bang on a piano
[1:56:44] he's doing a man thing but yet he
[1:56:47] doesn't understand the things of man
[1:56:50] he doesn't understand music you could
[1:56:53] train him maybe even to play amazing
[1:56:55] grace
[1:56:55] i don't know like an exceptional chimp
[1:56:58] maybe you could train him to play that
[1:56:59] but only reason he could play that is
[1:57:01] because you could train him
[1:57:02] not because he understood the words not
[1:57:04] because he understood the music
[1:57:06] not because he knew the meaning behind
[1:57:08] it
[1:57:11] why he's a chimp doesn't understand the
[1:57:15] things of man
[1:57:16] so how are we gonna meet god when the
[1:57:19] spirit of man
[1:57:20] knows the things of man well you're
[1:57:21] gonna need the spirit of god in your
[1:57:23] life amen
[1:57:24] and we've been taught all our lives how
[1:57:26] do you give the spirit repent and be
[1:57:28] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:57:30] christ
[1:57:31] come to know him receive the holy spirit
[1:57:34] in your life
[1:57:36] but don't just stop there because this
[1:57:39] this isn't uh you know we we talk about
[1:57:41] this being a race but you know guess
[1:57:43] what the
[1:57:44] the prize is jesus christ the prize is
[1:57:47] not that i've checked off the three
[1:57:48] necessary boxes of
[1:57:50] christian life and now i just do
[1:57:51] christian things
[1:57:53] you're it's cheapening it for yourself
[1:57:56] the prize is him the prize is the i am
[1:57:59] amen that you could know him
[1:58:02] that's amazing that's the greatest thing
[1:58:05] ever if you truly know him to receive
[1:58:07] him
[1:58:07] man he is your reward i am your
[1:58:10] exceeding and great reward amen
[1:58:14] so we continue on the scripture for what
[1:58:16] man knoweth the things of man save the
[1:58:17] spirit of man which is in him
[1:58:19] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[1:58:21] but the spirit of god
[1:58:23] now we have received not the spirit of
[1:58:26] the world
[1:58:26] but the spirit which is of god that we
[1:58:30] might know the things that are freely
[1:58:33] given to us of god we have received the
[1:58:36] spirit
[1:58:37] that we might know
[1:58:41] john chapter 8 verses 42 to 43
[1:58:47] jesus said unto them if god were your
[1:58:49] father you would love me
[1:58:51] for i proceeded forth and came from god
[1:58:53] neither came i
[1:58:54] of myself but he sent me why do you not
[1:58:56] understand my speech because you cannot
[1:58:58] hear my word
[1:58:59] ye are of your father the devil and the
[1:59:01] lust of your father will you do
[1:59:06] why couldn't they hear him because they
[1:59:08] had the wrong birth
[1:59:10] i had the wrong birth a new birth brings
[1:59:13] us into the knowledge of who jesus is
[1:59:15] and
[1:59:15] and brings us to a place where we can
[1:59:16] know him where we can know him
[1:59:18] amen brother branham in the church age
[1:59:21] book speaking on the
[1:59:22] scriptures that we we just read there in
[1:59:24] first corinthians putting these verses
[1:59:25] together we see there's only one group
[1:59:27] of people
[1:59:27] and that a very special group of people
[1:59:29] who are able to hear what the spirit
[1:59:30] says in each age
[1:59:32] and what it is one special group that
[1:59:33] receives the revelation for each age
[1:59:35] that group is of god because the group
[1:59:38] that cannot hear
[1:59:39] is not of god as we just read in john
[1:59:43] the group that can and does hear what
[1:59:44] the spirit is saying and receives the
[1:59:46] revelation thereof
[1:59:47] is that group described in first
[1:59:49] corinthians 2
[1:59:51] 6 through 16. how do we know him
[1:59:55] the new birth receiving the holy spirit
[1:59:58] but those things and and and this isn't
[2:00:01] again this isn't a carrot on the stick
[2:00:02] it's like receive the holy spirit oh you
[2:00:03] all receive the holy spirit well
[2:00:05] let me give you a new challenge now meet
[2:00:06] god no what we're saying is
[2:00:09] is the idea is that you would meet god
[2:00:12] that you would come to know god there's
[2:00:14] a few steps that get you in line for you
[2:00:16] to be able to truly
[2:00:17] know him so the idea isn't go through
[2:00:21] the steps and you're good the idea is go
[2:00:23] through the steps that because you want
[2:00:24] him
[2:00:25] because you want to know him and now we
[2:00:27] can what i'm saying is
[2:00:29] that we can look at experiences
[2:00:30] throughout history we can look at moses
[2:00:32] and john sheridan
[2:00:33] different things and understand that
[2:00:35] that meeting god caused
[2:00:37] a just huge changes in people's lives
[2:00:43] that's what i want in my life
[2:00:46] i want to sit there through my trial of
[2:00:49] pain
[2:00:51] for three months and know that god
[2:00:55] truly does heal and have the confidence
[2:00:58] that
[2:00:58] man he could just heal me like that but
[2:01:02] even if i'm sitting there saying
[2:01:03] by his stripes i'm healed
[2:01:06] and saying it gritted through my teeth
[2:01:08] because it hurts so bad
[2:01:11] but it doesn't matter to me but it
[2:01:13] doesn't shake my faith
[2:01:15] because i'm sitting there and i know god
[2:01:17] and i know who he is
[2:01:20] and i can come before him in faith
[2:01:22] bringing my request to him
[2:01:25] but maybe he's asking me to go through
[2:01:27] that trial to see
[2:01:29] do you know me you think you know me
[2:01:33] but maybe you this trial will show you
[2:01:35] whether or not you really
[2:01:37] you really know me or not maybe this
[2:01:39] trial will show you
[2:01:42] where your faith might lack or this or
[2:01:44] that
[2:01:46] does the trials of life do they hinder
[2:01:49] you do they shake
[2:01:50] you do they
[2:01:54] you know there's there's there's
[2:01:58] i just hope to say this at a young
[2:01:59] people's conventions someday because
[2:02:01] i've seen it so often you know there's
[2:02:03] there's young sisters that you know they
[2:02:05] they believe the message
[2:02:06] as long as as long as god will send them
[2:02:09] a message young man to marry
[2:02:12] but after a few you know years and
[2:02:15] coming into mid-20s if that
[2:02:16] that hasn't happened hey hey the message
[2:02:19] got to go because i need to get married
[2:02:24] and the proof didn't happen until it was
[2:02:26] until it was too late
[2:02:29] why would why would you why would you
[2:02:32] sit there and
[2:02:33] serve god for so long and then oh okay
[2:02:37] it's come to the end of my robe i need
[2:02:39] to get married
[2:02:41] can't find the right message guys so i'm
[2:02:43] gone like
[2:02:45] you've just been wasting your life you
[2:02:48] haven't really even been
[2:02:50] in the message whatever that means
[2:02:54] that should mean that you know god that
[2:02:56] you serve god you you know him and you
[2:02:58] met him
[2:02:59] and and this is the word that he's
[2:03:00] brought to us today this is exactly how
[2:03:03] he wants us to live
[2:03:04] not that it's changed anything it's just
[2:03:06] that we got actually got the revelation
[2:03:08] of how it always has been
[2:03:11] that's what it should be and it should
[2:03:13] bring us to a place where we know him
[2:03:14] and we serve him and obey him because we
[2:03:16] know him
[2:03:18] not because i'm just doing what's right
[2:03:20] because this is how i was raised
[2:03:21] and as long as everything works out for
[2:03:23] me and the you know
[2:03:25] and i get to you know have the right
[2:03:27] marriage and the right children and the
[2:03:28] right this is if
[2:03:29] as long as all the things i want fall
[2:03:31] into place with this whole religion
[2:03:33] thing then yay
[2:03:35] that's you know like i'm just
[2:03:39] there's there's people that actually do
[2:03:40] this there's people that actually think
[2:03:42] this this people that actually live this
[2:03:43] experience
[2:03:44] and it blows my mind because you've
[2:03:47] totally missed the point
[2:03:49] because you never met god
[2:03:53] that's not what it's about it's not what
[2:03:56] it's about
[2:03:57] it's about jesus christ we don't need to
[2:04:00] has this been simple has this been just
[2:04:02] just a foundational thought yes
[2:04:04] yes it has you know i i don't have to go
[2:04:06] and and preach on the book of redemption
[2:04:08] which is what i kind of wanted to do but
[2:04:10] i don't have to preach on that because
[2:04:11] you know what because god's in all of it
[2:04:14] amen and and and and we can go we can go
[2:04:17] and and i love preaching message
[2:04:19] doctrines as much
[2:04:20] more than anybody but not to the expense
[2:04:24] to
[2:04:25] to to miss justification to miss
[2:04:27] sanctification
[2:04:28] to miss the baptism of holy ghost and a
[2:04:30] new birth like
[2:04:31] it's not like we've we've gotten past
[2:04:33] those things because we're in the
[2:04:34] message no
[2:04:37] we're in the i am he's all of that
[2:04:41] and all of that is true now brother
[2:04:43] branham didn't have to go repreaching
[2:04:44] all of that
[2:04:44] he had a platform of pentecost to kind
[2:04:46] of step onto and and bring some of the
[2:04:48] deeper things of god in the revelation
[2:04:50] that
[2:04:50] that we needed for this day the
[2:04:52] restoration we need we needed
[2:04:54] but it doesn't mean that all those
[2:04:55] things aren't right and look we need all
[2:04:57] of the word
[2:04:59] all of it's important because it brings
[2:05:01] us
[2:05:02] to him amen to jesus christ
[2:05:06] the one who died on the cross for your
[2:05:07] sins and mine
[2:05:09] but he rose again and he lives
[2:05:13] and if we can get in the spirit of god
[2:05:16] we can meet him
[2:05:18] just as moses met him on mount sinai
[2:05:21] and just as abby met joseph you can meet
[2:05:25] jesus christ
[2:05:27] and it can be that real and that
[2:05:29] powerful for you
[2:05:31] that's what god wanted to say to
[2:05:32] somebody here today
[2:05:37] musicians can come can we pray
[2:05:45] let's just have a word of prayer
[2:05:46] heavenly father
[2:05:49] lord you are the great i am you are
[2:05:51] wonderful and you are everything lord
[2:05:54] we long to be in the presence of god to
[2:05:56] know

[2:06:00] of us father that wants
[2:06:02] any of this to be all in vain in our
[2:06:04] lives

[2:08:33] impacted someone and
[2:08:36] helped draw on someone closer to you
[2:08:38] maybe
[2:08:39] open someone's eyes to see that they've
[2:08:41] maybe
[2:08:43] just become disillusioned a little bit
[2:08:45] or got their eyes on the wrong things
[2:08:47] maybe they're good things but just kind
[2:08:50] of forgetting that it's all about you
[2:08:51] lord
[2:08:52] i just pray that we're all refocused on
[2:08:54] you lord

[2:13:02] place my
[2:13:05] how we appreciate the word of the lord
[2:13:08] amen on today i think one of the things
[2:13:11] that really
[2:13:13] just really struck me as brother trevor
[2:13:15] was just using the different examples of
[2:13:17] asking different people to do different
[2:13:19] things and
[2:13:20] you know it gives brother sway there and
[2:13:23] it says
[2:13:23] would you clown climb mount everest with
[2:13:26] me it's like
[2:13:27] i'll do all these other things but when
[2:13:28] i get to mount average
[2:13:30] mount everest that might be a little bit
[2:13:31] too much but had it been god
[2:13:33] himself asking a question like that it
[2:13:35] would have meant something different
[2:13:37] and often times you know we come as
[2:13:39] ministers we preached the word of god
[2:13:41] and you know as i was sitting there
[2:13:42] listening to man so many people need to
[2:13:44] hear this
[2:13:45] because sometimes we think it's just the
[2:13:47] pastor asking
[2:13:48] it's just the preacher saying that but
[2:13:50] when god himself comes to you and
[2:13:52] and requests something out of his work
[2:13:54] for you then it has a different
[2:13:56] feel it has a you know a different
[2:13:59] result so
[2:14:00] you know you can only do things as god
[2:14:02] speaks to you and as god gives it to you
[2:14:04] so
[2:14:05] brother we appreciate that amen on today
[2:14:08] meet god meet god
[2:14:14] hallelujah and and you know
[2:14:18] i i sometimes just being pastor you're
[2:14:21] privy to
[2:14:22] you know different things and and even
[2:14:25] just the different people he used for
[2:14:27] the different examples
[2:14:28] everything was done because god needed
[2:14:30] to be done a certain way today
[2:14:32] just to encourage a few people in their
[2:14:35] walk with christ
[2:14:36] uh you know i love the way he did sister
[2:14:39] abby she could not
[2:14:40] be shaken no matter how much brother
[2:14:43] trevor said she couldn't be shaken
[2:14:45] because she knew she had met
[2:14:47] joseph and amen and you ought to you
[2:14:49] ought to have the same type of testimony
[2:14:51] not be
[2:14:52] shaken by what the devil bring to you
[2:14:54] because you know you've met jesus
[2:14:56] hallelujah and ain't nobody gonna take
[2:14:59] that from you so
[2:15:00] amen we appreciate the word of the lord
[2:15:02] let's have a word of prayer
[2:15:04] amen and we'll prepare a man um
[2:15:08] just to dismiss the service i do need to
[2:15:10] have a meeting

[2:15:14] uh so we'll just just just quickly have
