[40:43] Galatians the second chapter xx man you
[40:50] love the Lord man so you're really
[40:55] congratulations to the new grandparents
[40:58] I had to give my brother a hard time for
[41:01] you first got that boy
[41:04] I remember when when Sarah was born I
[41:10] think you're gonna try but God knows all
[41:29] things something special about all the
[41:32] grandchildren I'll tell you what man
[41:34] Andy yeah they look different than the
[41:37] chair and the sub special about those
[41:39] grandchildren oh man he rules for let us
[41:44] therefore fear lest a promise being left
[41:47] us of entering into his rest any of you
[41:52] should seem to come short of it for unto
[41:56] us was the gospel preached as well as
[41:59] unto them but the word preached did not
[42:04] profit them not being mixed with faith
[42:09] in them that heard it not being mixed
[42:16] with faith in them that heard it for we
[42:20] which have believed do enter into rest
[42:24] and he said as I have sworn in my wrath
[42:28] if they shall enter into my rest
[42:32] although the works were finished from
[42:36] the foundation of the world for he spake
[42:41] in a certain place of the seventh day on
[42:44] this wise and God did rest the seventh
[42:49] day from all his works and in this place
[42:52] again if they shall enter into my rest
[42:58] seeing therefore it remaineth that some
[43:01] must enter therein and they to whom if
[43:05] it whom it was first preached entered
[43:08] not in because of unbelief amen let us
[43:15] go
[43:15] to Galatians amen the second chapter xx
[43:30] the first
[43:34] Galatians ii chapter xx first breeze on
[43:40] this was I am crucified with Christ
[43:44] nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ
[43:52] liveth in me and the life which I now
[43:56] live in the flesh I live by faith in the
[44:01] Son of God who loved me and gave himself
[44:06] for me
[44:07] may the Lord had a blessing to the
[44:10] reading there was a word Lord God we ask
[44:13] you Father to just take these this
[44:16] thought Lord garden may you've just
[44:18] planted into the hearts of the believers
[44:20] Oh father God that it may manifest Lord
[44:23] God its intent Lord God Lord God may our
[44:27] faith be elevated Oh father God may we
[44:30] recognize who we are Lord God recognize
[44:33] the time in the hour that we're living
[44:35] in Oh Lord God and we ask you Lord God
[44:37] to just have your way come down in the
[44:39] mighty way look are we in right your
[44:41] presence in O Lord God just as Moses Oh
[44:43] father God approach that burning bush
[44:45] Lord God you say take off your shoes
[44:47] Moses for your standing on holy ground
[44:49] now Lord God we believe Oh father God
[44:54] that you're still here Lord God doing
[44:57] the same works ulis the same God Lord
[45:01] God the same Oh father God you said you
[45:04] never leave us nor forsake us Lord God
[45:07] you'll be with us to the air no Lord now
[45:09] Lord God speak have your way Lord God in
[45:11] Jesus precious name Amen amen amen if I
[45:18] had to title proof of the resurrection
[45:22] a man proof of the resurrection I'd like
[45:26] to start off by a hypothetical question
[45:28] and the question is how many this
[45:33] evening is looking forward to the
[45:37] rapture and I believe if I ask that
[45:39] question everybody would raise their
[45:42] hand that we're looking forward to that
[45:45] great
[45:46] that they went up that spoken of and on
[45:50] all that a religious Christendom
[45:54] since crisis all been talking about one
[45:57] day he's coming back again and he's
[46:00] gonna take his people away
[46:02] we're expecting a rapture we expected
[46:07] God to come and deliver us from this
[46:11] evil place but my brothers and sisters
[46:14] what I want us to look at is you know we
[46:19] look at the cross and what it represents
[46:23] amen they represent sin crucified all
[46:27] right it represents sickness healed amen
[46:31] but I want you to understand that we're
[46:33] we're close to that rapture everybody's
[46:36] just couldn't agree to that we have to
[46:37] be God we're looking at the signs of the
[46:40] times I said Lord it's got to be close
[46:43] yeah I can't see I can't see how things
[46:47] can get much worse where there's all
[46:50] kind of science Lord understanding that
[46:54] we know that we want me healing in the
[46:59] rapture we won't need a bondage to be
[47:05] broken in the rapture we all of these
[47:09] things amen we won't need them anymore
[47:14] all right so I want to ask you then if
[47:18] that be the case what are we waiting for
[47:23] what are we waiting for you have faith
[47:29] hope and charity
[47:32] Oh puts things a fall as well well well
[47:39] I understand that this is supposed to
[47:41] happen and anything that is supposed to
[47:44] happen but Lord will one day you're
[47:48] going to come and you're going to and
[47:50] you're going to medicine
[47:51] all of these gifts right but faith says
[47:54] not one day now is the time now is the
[48:00] time if there was ever a time now is the
[48:05] time I was just sharing that in the back
[48:08] of a brotherhood this is my God when we
[48:11] when we first coming up as young boy and
[48:16] coming into this message we believed it
[48:21] almost instantly almost instantly
[48:26] because I there was just something in
[48:29] there right that was never a real
[48:32] question that we this makes sense this
[48:36] just makes with grandparents Moses went
[48:47] through all of the things that he went
[48:49] through and he was 40 years old and just
[48:54] coming into his purpose Wow so all of
[48:59] that time God was preparing him for that
[49:03] and I believe that this evening that God
[49:06] is preparing for the time is this we're
[49:11] going to get into some things I attached
[49:13] you actually to pray for me
[49:16] amen I want to say faith is not an
[49:21] option faith is a requirement for the
[49:28] believer it is not something that you
[49:31] can say well I have faith if you look if
[49:37] you go out into the streets and take a
[49:39] pole and go around and ask just pick a
[49:43] random hundred people and say do you
[49:46] have faith I bet you every land
[49:49] ooh I don't even know nothing absolutely
[50:14] is a requirement no because you receive
[51:13] the gift of the Holy Ghost the same
[51:16] thing that it took for you to believe
[51:20] that you see the same faith it's going
[51:24] to take for you to believe know that you
[51:27] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:29] now we're gonna look into that
[51:31] amen faith means believing in what the
[51:37] Bible said see faith faith has to have a
[51:40] friend our foundation it has you can't
[51:44] just blindly believe he said faith is a
[51:47] revelation a revelation of the word not
[51:51] my god
[51:53] faith is a you can't just have faith
[52:00] cause you know you can't just have faith
[52:05] cause you say you got me faith has to be
[52:09] revealed and I hope somebody God
[52:19] revealed this 'man what faith is by the
[52:24] help of the Holy Ghost
[52:25] faith is knowing that God's Word is true
[52:30] and everlasting it is knowing and
[52:34] putting all confidence into his word and
[52:39] all confidence into our lives taking
[52:44] that faith in God and putting it into
[52:47] action not just saying I got see but the
[52:54] Bible says that the just shall live by
[52:57] faith and my brother says that faith is
[53:02] gonna be tested that faith is gonna be
[53:05] put to the test
[53:07] amen I don't want to get ahead of myself
[53:13] the scripture says in Hebrews 11 but
[53:16] without faith it is impossible to please
[53:20] God
[53:21] for he that cometh to God must believe
[53:23] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[53:27] those that diligently seek a man now in
[53:37] order to know that Jesus Christ is the
[53:41] son of God when his spirit bears record
[53:47] with your spirit in an experience of the
[53:51] new birth what is an experience I looked
[53:56] up the word experience it is an
[53:58] encounter or an event or in a current
[54:03] that has taken place an experience of
[54:10] the new birth
[54:12] not just saying it it is an experience
[54:20] are you with me your spirit bearing
[54:26] record with his spirit in the experience
[54:33] of the new verse when your spirit bears
[54:43] record with his spirit your sons and
[54:47] your daughters God then you are a
[54:50] witness of the resurrection
[54:57] the message is proof of the resurrection
[55:01] how do you know ask the question not too
[55:04] long ago how do you know that he's risen
[55:07] whatever it cost the to empty well one
[55:10] of the arguments then was they stoled
[55:13] about proof of a resurrection not until
[55:24] he came and proved the Tyrell did they
[55:34] believed that he was resurrected you're
[55:39] gonna know that he's a resurrected God
[55:43] you can believe it by reading it oh you
[55:47] can believe it because somebody told you
[55:50] but you have to have evidence for you if
[55:54] you don't have evidence for yourself you
[55:59] can't have faith there's nothing there
[56:02] that have based the faith oh you have to
[56:07] know not because of it because what a
[56:12] preacher - it has to be an individual
[56:21] bearing yes
[56:23] spear in an experience to where you know
[56:29] why because he did me thin you can have
[56:37] faith he says I said I spoke this last
[56:43] winter he says it's like tuning a string
[56:46] on a guitar if I tuned into the note of
[56:53] C and say I'm a little low and that
[56:58] spring is a certain pitch or a certain
[57:02] octave then all of a sudden what do I
[57:04] have to do I have to put that string and
[57:08] listen to it it sounds a little low so I
[57:11] have to turn the knob on that string and
[57:30] your DC is it gonna pop is it gonna
[57:34] break no because that string is designed
[57:41] [Music]
[57:41] [Applause]
[57:58] [Applause]
[58:03] perfect of the test stream the prophets
[58:11] saying when it coincides in a demon
[58:18] that's got that person bound has got to
[58:21] turn loose that type of faith see when
[58:27] your spirit bears record with his spear
[58:31] then your faith will deliver you God has
[58:37] already done the work
[58:41] he already sacrifices of your sins
[58:46] remaining faith only way to have faith
[58:56] is through the baptism of Holy that your
[59:04] spirit is gonna bear record with his
[59:07] spirit
[59:08] the only way that your string is gonna
[59:12] sound in the same pitch that your voice
[59:17] is gonna speak the same as his voice
[59:21] nevertheless not i but Christ that they
[59:26] can't tell Dad everything that you speak
[59:29] at all is it caught because the pitch is
[59:32] justice
[59:39] now the only thing that is to do is to
[59:44] stimulate faith of the people that they
[59:48] might see see that's what we're doing
[59:51] here we're trying to stimulate your
[59:56] faith so that you can see is it you he's
[1:00:01] already done the world
[1:00:03] amen we're gonna get into some things
[1:00:07] amen
[1:00:09] we're gonna get into something the
[1:00:14] promise is unto you and to your children
[1:00:19] and to them that are far off as many as
[1:00:24] the Lord that God shall call God has got
[1:00:30] to keep his promise he did it in the
[1:00:35] Bible age he will do it in this age
[1:00:38] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:00:42] and forever amen my mind just went to go
[1:00:52] to somewhere and I say wait i'ma hold
[1:00:54] off on that there's nothing that we can
[1:01:00] do to heal a person nothing any man can
[1:01:04] do that would heal another we've seen
[1:01:08] brother Branham on the platform I didn't
[1:01:14] do it you you pull that angel to you
[1:01:22] it's nothing
[1:01:24] the only thing a man can do is preach
[1:01:27] the word put you in a direction to
[1:01:33] elevate your faith to believe every
[1:01:38] person in the world is already seen
[1:01:43] every person in the world is already
[1:01:47] healed
[1:01:49] hello it's enough got quiet on me I can
[1:01:55] back then show you the quote it's an
[1:01:58] expectation paragraph let's see here 20
[1:02:03] right amen
[1:02:05] there's nothing okay every person in the
[1:02:09] world is already healed
[1:02:11] there's not one but that what's already
[1:02:15] healed there's not a sinner in the world
[1:02:17] but what already saved Jesus Christ when
[1:02:22] he died at Calvary he paid the price
[1:02:26] there that's right now the only thing we
[1:02:29] have to do is look there except all you
[1:02:34] have to do is accept it now you say well
[1:02:37] I got saved two years ago he says no sir
[1:02:40] you got saved
[1:02:42] 2,000 years nothing you got 1,900 but we
[1:02:45] done moved on 2,000 years ago you just
[1:02:48] accepted it two years ago the same
[1:02:53] question at Calvary there's two kinds of
[1:03:00] men two things that a man can't do a man
[1:03:05] can't forgive sins nor can i man heal
[1:03:11] it's not given to man to do that right
[1:03:15] Nick never was it was only in Jesus
[1:03:21] Christ and there a man by the preaching
[1:03:25] of the word can point you in that
[1:03:28] direction
[1:03:30] and you can accept your fountain your
[1:03:32] salvation or your healing and he was
[1:03:36] wounded for our transgressions and his
[1:03:40] spot his stripes we were healed
[1:03:43] past tense pastors the it's already done
[1:03:51] you just have to accept it the church
[1:03:56] say Amen
[1:03:57] now back let's make sure I'm not
[1:04:01] overlooking that cuz I'm gonna tell you
[1:04:03] what this some I got some good stuff

[1:04:22] where were and what's promised to us
[1:04:32] didn't there's no spirit but no demon
[1:04:35] and hail can stand before not a what he
[1:04:41] told a prophet if you can get the people
[1:04:44] to believe and your prayer is insisting

[1:10:35] to you
[1:10:37] [Music]
[1:10:51] [Applause]
[1:11:05] [Applause]
[1:11:08] he was talking to the bride glory to God
[1:11:13] not an Old Testament there was two types
[1:11:19] of ways that they have for a message one
[1:11:24] of them was a dreamer and the other one
[1:11:27] was by a prophet and then they had what
[1:11:32] was called the Urim therm
[1:11:34] okay when that dream of told that dream
[1:11:42] or that prophet that prophesy that your
[1:11:48] own family which was the breastplate of
[1:11:50] N had to light up if it didn't light up
[1:11:55] then it's not indicated it's not a
[1:11:59] vindicated word and don't believe it
[1:12:03] now the day we hover you infirmary it's
[1:12:06] God's Word God's Bible is the Urim third
[1:12:12] heaven and earth to pass away but not
[1:12:14] one word of this word shall shout you're
[1:12:19] not a man and this is the first and the
[1:12:23] foundation and the only foundation for
[1:12:26] Christian truth lays in God's Bible it
[1:12:29] has to come there now amen
[1:12:42] amen another question do you believe
[1:12:46] that you will raise and have an immortal
[1:12:51] body how many believe that this is the
[1:12:55] Prophet talking in the message Moses a
[1:12:57] man 50 0 1 1 0 29 the middle there
[1:13:06] somewhere
[1:13:08] how many believe that the resurrection
[1:13:12] that you will raise and have an immortal
[1:13:16] body now he says divine healing is the
[1:13:23] donal pavement or the earnest money of
[1:13:27] your immortal body he said see what I
[1:13:32] mean it is the evidence that you have an
[1:13:36] immortal body you'll see coming to the
[1:13:41] platform a little crippled twisted up
[1:13:43] children you see them stand here all
[1:13:46] misformed and out of shape you see it
[1:13:50] and you're with your own eyes see their
[1:13:54] hands and arms come straight and walk
[1:13:56] off the platform it's normal children
[1:13:59] you'll see people come here with all
[1:14:05] kinds of condition
[1:14:06] I'm prophesy here with all kinds of
[1:14:11] conditions and see them healed and leave
[1:14:15] the platform what is that that is the
[1:14:20] down payment that is the earnest you
[1:14:24] know that person you know that person
[1:14:27] someday if they stay under the blood of
[1:14:30] Christ will receive an immortal body
[1:14:34] cancer in black death don't
[1:14:38] it's the earnest of our salvation
[1:14:42] it's the earnest of our salvation divine
[1:14:46] healing
[1:14:52] divine healing is only the bait it is
[1:15:01] only the bait I love to go fishing and
[1:15:08] when I'm trying to catch a certain fish
[1:15:11] I use a certain kind of bait sometime it
[1:15:22] requires me to flawed genius get up
[1:15:25] early in the morning and I get my stuff
[1:15:30] together I get out there before daybreak
[1:15:35] you know the Prophet everybody has to
[1:15:38] have their place some some some some
[1:15:42] have a certain place in their home that
[1:15:46] they pray some have a closet some have a
[1:15:50] certain room some walk around believe
[1:15:54] the Prophet went to the mountain that's
[1:15:57] what he felt closer to God yeah I go to
[1:16:00] the water
[1:16:01] i hey there is nothing more tranquil to
[1:16:04] me then being on the water
[1:16:09] debris him abhi having my lines tight
[1:16:14] and ready watching further the don't
[1:16:20] that's what my wife called it we sitting
[1:16:22] like they're hunting Easter don't that's
[1:16:24] when the fish dump
[1:16:26] how do you know something's on the other
[1:16:29] line cuz I can feel him I can feel it
[1:16:34] pull it can you see him but I can feel
[1:16:38] him pull it so now the wisdom is when to
[1:16:47] set the hook divine healing is just the
[1:16:53] bait but it was all settled at Calvary
[1:16:58] it was all settled dead Calvary right
[1:17:01] there together now listen what the
[1:17:03] prophecy
[1:17:05] he says thing you never showed her fish
[1:17:07] to hook his show on the bait he grabs
[1:17:11] the bait and gets the hook he says about
[1:17:15] 98% and Jesus Christ
[1:17:18] meetings were all divine healings but he
[1:17:24] healed the sick to catch the psychology
[1:17:28] of the people to catch them to a place
[1:17:31] and then he preached the gospel to them
[1:17:36] what's the sense are you going to heal
[1:17:39] healed everything else but you still
[1:17:54] shrouded in unbelief the Prophet came
[1:17:58] and taught us that we smoked in adultery
[1:18:01] and all of these different types of
[1:18:03] things these are nice this is my
[1:18:08] unbelief it's just the opposite if you
[1:18:14] believe you say how do you know you're
[1:18:15] saved
[1:18:16] I believe I'm saying well if you don't
[1:18:18] believe you say then you that's it
[1:18:20] the sin is it's not to believe God will
[1:18:26] do what he say there's no way in
[1:18:31] unbelief that you're gonna take on them
[1:18:34] another body when Jesus went down to the
[1:18:43] multitude 2,000 people probably seeing
[1:18:45] multitude of 2,000 people why did he
[1:18:48] only heal one is what he only I do all
[1:18:52] of what the Father show but I remember
[1:18:55] same thing the Prophet I prefer to this
[1:18:57] day I'm waiting for that angel I'm
[1:19:02] waiting for the angel yeah oh wait a
[1:19:05] minute wait wait wait wait wait wait
[1:19:07] wait just over there
[1:19:09] your name is such-and-such you from such
[1:19:12] in such a place you got in like what are
[1:19:13] they
[1:19:18] that one any wins with only one happy
[1:19:24] woman with the issue of blood all of the
[1:19:28] people around them they just down Oh
[1:19:31] praising it and then touching them they
[1:19:34] just dead because of something that they
[1:19:36] heard they heard that he was the great
[1:19:39] man they heard on anything but this
[1:19:41] woman had see she knew that if I could
[1:19:46] just get to Jesus
[1:19:48] I'm she said this now listen I know I be
[1:19:54] made hope and she touched just to him of
[1:19:59] his garment your faith has made you
[1:20:01] whole no faith needed and your faith my
[1:20:06] brothers and sisters it's what's gonna
[1:20:09] have to do it he's already done it but
[1:20:15] he cannot do it over unbelief now
[1:20:27] he says you have two types of beliefs he
[1:20:35] say the Pentecost in the fool gospel I
[1:20:37] say and he said one it's fundamentally
[1:20:44] right but they don't have faith and the
[1:20:49] other one have faith but they also were
[1:20:53] he said it go one way to explain it is
[1:20:56] one guy money in the bank and don't know
[1:20:58] how to write a check and the other one
[1:21:01] can write a check but no money in the
[1:21:03] bank if you can ever get the two
[1:21:06] together he said we're being the
[1:21:08] millennium yeah now listen this is very
[1:21:13] important I want you to get this lordy
[1:21:16] God he says now if he hasn't got the
[1:21:23] Holy Spirit in there he's got nothing
[1:21:26] but just nor his mind to rest on it
[1:21:32] intellectual faith so he just can't
[1:21:36] comprehend the things of God he doesn't
[1:21:40] know them the natural mind can't
[1:21:43] understand the things of God
[1:21:45] they're foolish to you now the
[1:21:50] Pentecostal or the Full Gospel you are
[1:21:53] he says the one thing that I find the
[1:21:57] one of the greatest hindrances amongst
[1:22:01] us is that you're trying to place the
[1:22:04] things of God yet to comfort when you're
[1:22:13] right in the middle of it now
[1:22:17] now you say just wait a minute
[1:22:20] well that could be the millennium where
[1:22:27] we won't need any healings and things in
[1:22:30] the next age now you are the sons of God
[1:22:37] now we're seated together in heavenly
[1:22:40] places
[1:22:41] not we will be we are now this evening
[1:22:46] this afternoon right here now
[1:22:49] sons daughters of God seated together in
[1:22:52] heavenly places all things are possible
[1:22:55] when those little shackles of dark
[1:22:58] shadows get broken away the Holy Spirit
[1:23:01] can come right in and perform miracles I
[1:23:06] want to go back and read that again when
[1:23:09] those little shackles of dark shackles
[1:23:12] get broken away then the Holy Spirit can
[1:23:17] come right in and perform miracles Oh
[1:23:20] what he came there is nothing impossible
[1:23:24] just he says but just that little doubt
[1:23:29] sitting there nothing is impossible but
[1:23:34] just that little doubt sitting there
[1:23:37] it's what's gonna stop it okay he says
[1:23:42] here you have to have it based on faith
[1:23:46] that God's Word well then a man goes to
[1:23:50] school and he learns theology he reads
[1:23:54] it and say God said so yes I believe
[1:23:58] that he believes that in his mind see he
[1:24:03] says but you've got a sub conscious and
[1:24:07] the subconscious disagrees with this
[1:24:12] because when when he starts to do it
[1:24:16] he's no disco bless you he's a little
[1:24:20] bit scared that it won't happen if you a
[1:24:26] little bit scared that it won't happen
[1:24:31] then it won't not a lot of this kid
[1:24:37] little bit that it won't happen it won't

[1:34:55] your body well when that old snake
[1:34:59] grabbed a hold of Paul's hand there was

[1:35:10] got some more snakes
[1:35:13] nothing to it
[1:35:15] no fear it didn't scare him see when
[1:35:20] Peter come walking out on the water
[1:35:23] doing fine until he seen the waves of
[1:35:28] contrary and when he got scared he begin
[1:35:31] the scene Jesus picked him up why did
[1:35:35] you fear oh ye of little faith
[1:35:38] fear you're scared it won't happen don't
[1:35:43] have one bit of fear move focus God said

[1:35:53] is gonna help you lord have mercy
[1:35:55] he says and you can't do that until you

[1:36:04] casts out fear remember those three
[1:36:08] faith hope and charity amen
[1:36:13] he says if it want to contribute
[1:36:17] anything he says if I contribute
[1:36:20] anything to the success of my ministry
[1:36:22] amongst people is this I'll admit I have
[1:36:28] I have had to butcher up meetings
[1:36:31] because I just couldn't said it and in
[1:36:35] the routine like other ministers do he
[1:36:38] was talking about all of Robertson yeah
[1:36:42] Billy Graham and that other young fellow
[1:36:45] yeah TL Osborn hi they would come
[1:36:48] he said all Roberts got that Bulldog
[1:36:51] faith and he said TL are going to preach
[1:36:53] that thing called a educated see can you
[1:36:56] preach that thing so tightly can't help
[1:36:57] but believe but then they'll be healed
[1:37:01] Healing campaign he said many times I've
[1:37:04] had to promise he says back there
[1:37:07] because God will make me do it but he
[1:37:11] said if there's one thing it's because I
[1:37:15] have love for people and people know
[1:37:20] that you take a little baby three months
[1:37:23] old he don't know nothing he's got a
[1:37:27] mind and it isn't developing yet he
[1:37:30] don't know anything the doctor says he
[1:37:34] can see light he might see your hand but
[1:37:38] he can only follow it he's just kicking
[1:37:42] his little heels and screaming - the hot
[1:37:44] cup of his voice well he comes of some
[1:37:47] kind of woman comes along
[1:37:49] and pat him and say well dear and he
[1:37:51] just kicks right on and and he don't
[1:37:54] know who that woman is
[1:37:56] he knows don't know nobody but let that
[1:38:00] mother walk up just put her hands on
[1:38:04] that child that settles it now he don't
[1:38:09] know his mother but his little spirit
[1:38:12] knows there's something about that
[1:38:14] spirit that nothing else can inject that
[1:38:18] mother's love to him no matter how much
[1:38:22] that person loves it ain't that mother's
[1:38:25] love it ain't that mother's love so it's
[1:38:32] got to be a genuine it can't be our love
[1:38:36] have got to be the love of God listen
[1:38:39] and when the love and when the love of
[1:38:44] God and when we love God with all of our
[1:38:48] hearts and souls and minds and we love
[1:38:53] one another as ourselves our neighbors
[1:38:57] as ourselves the people can actually
[1:39:00] feel that you can't put it you can't put
[1:39:05] it on you can't make a belief cause
[1:39:09] they'll know it that's the only thing
[1:39:12] that catches out fear is perfect love
[1:39:15] perfect love and one bit of fear we'll
[1:39:24] what's the word I'm looking for
[1:39:26] contradict your faith so you have to
[1:39:32] love one and you can't it's got to come
[1:39:36] from a place of love is the heart that
[1:39:38] sinneth sin is unbelief already the
[1:39:45] abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:39:47] speaketh the word of God comes from the
[1:39:51] heart of God
[1:39:54] because it's the spoken word that come
[1:39:56] from his heart it is a love story to the
[1:40:01] bride
[1:40:02] and when we read the word it's us
[1:40:05] falling in love with him saying that he
[1:40:08] promised us with it's a love affair and
[1:40:11] if our husband says he'll do something
[1:40:14] we know he'll do it and there's no doubt
[1:40:18] I'm not scared sometimes it may work our
[1:40:26] patients sometimes my wife may be yeah
[1:40:31] she tried he said he was gonna be home
[1:40:33] but he done got her done in his mouth

[1:41:04] the angel appeared to him in the burning
[1:41:06] bush now the angel came down to bring
[1:41:09] the message to Moses and otherwise to be
[1:41:13] his guide now you can't guide yourself
[1:41:18] there's only two ways that that your way
[1:41:25] and God's Way and when your way you're
[1:41:29] out of God's way a man there's only two
[1:41:32] ways that's your way in God's Way and
[1:41:34] when you're in your way you're out of
[1:41:35] God's way and you have to forget your
[1:41:39] way and find God's Way and a man cannot
[1:41:42] lead himself he was called a sheep we're
[1:41:48] liking unto sheep amen now we see Moses

[1:47:15] he says here he said now in the calling
[1:47:19] of this time he says I was born very
[1:47:25] humble parents but from the very time I
[1:47:28] was born something happened he says not
[1:47:31] of my own good and it's not of my
[1:47:33] parents goodness but it was about a
[1:47:35] foreknowledge of God he said when I was
[1:47:37] a little boy just about 12 years old it
[1:47:40] made its first he said about seven years
[1:47:46] old it made its first visible appearance
[1:47:49] in a wind in a bush sound familiar
[1:47:54] and then later knowing nothing about
[1:47:59] religion the only thing I noticed
[1:48:01] somebody told me there was a God and
[1:48:04] that all I knew about it that's all I
[1:48:09] knew about it until I was a man and then
[1:48:13] after being converted and become a
[1:48:16] United with the Baptist Church and one
[1:48:19] day
[1:48:22] on May the 7th while coming in and I was
[1:48:28] a game warden in Indiana by the way on
[1:48:32] the street today since I met a man and
[1:48:38] maybe here in the auditorium mr. price
[1:48:42] from Indiana I used to say I used to say
[1:48:46] his state at his house when I was
[1:48:49] patrolling through there and he probably
[1:48:53] in the building now
[1:48:54] little did I ever know that I meet him
[1:48:58] on the streets in Houston but he and his
[1:49:01] wife are here they're vacationing to to
[1:49:05] Florida and came to the meeting
[1:49:08] something pulled my heart at that time
[1:49:12] but one day it made itself is visibly
[1:49:16] known it was a man about six foot tall
[1:49:20] weighing some 200 pounds when it come
[1:49:24] down when it come a few years before

[1:49:31] hung over where where I was where I was
[1:49:36] at it come down many times here in the
[1:49:39] form of a star where thousands of people
[1:49:42] stood and looked at it it made its
[1:49:45] visible appearance right in this
[1:49:47] auditorium and so forth and different
[1:49:50] things taking place this time he comes
[1:49:53] as a man he says and I was scared he
[1:50:01] walked towards me he said do not fear
[1:50:04] I'm sent from the presence of the Lord
[1:50:08] I sent from the presence of God said to
[1:50:10] tell you that you are peculiar worth and
[1:50:15] a peculiar life has been indicated that
[1:50:19] you're taking a gift of divine healing
[1:50:22] to the people of the world and said that
[1:50:26] if you get them to believe and be
[1:50:29] sincere when you pray there's nothing
[1:50:32] that will stand before your prayers well

[1:50:38] I'll be with you and said that that you
[1:50:43] might know it'll come to pass that

[1:50:49] left hand and you'll be able to tell and
[1:50:52] said you feel the results now he says I
[1:50:56] call it vibrations upon the hand you
[1:50:58] become familiar with it and you'll tell
[1:51:01] the people the disease that they got in
[1:51:04] their body and then you and then if
[1:51:08] you'll be now then I was in Texas the
[1:51:13] other time that was in operate that was
[1:51:17] in operation is that right and you was
[1:51:21] in my meetings before raise your hand if
[1:51:23] you was in operation if you've seen him
[1:51:26] in operation and and if this now you
[1:51:32] people raise your hands
[1:51:33] all the way in my means if you know that
[1:51:36] it seen it in operation not perfect
[1:51:38] because he said was not perfect because
[1:51:41] he was
[1:51:41] still learning how to use it but see the
[1:51:43] God gave him two things as well
[1:51:45] he gave Moses two and he gave this
[1:51:49] Prophet truth now remember I said the
[1:51:53] healing was just debate there was a
[1:51:57] voice Moses had to recognize and follow
[1:52:00] the voice that was coming out of this
[1:52:03] sign this prophet followed the angel
[1:52:08] amen
[1:52:09] now my brothers and sisters you are a
[1:52:16] holy nation a peculiar people a royal
[1:52:22] priesthood and an angel has come to you
[1:52:27] and told if you only believe nothing is
[1:52:35] impossible he said what scientific was
[1:52:39] given to sign Moses was given to sign
[1:52:42] he said go ye therefore until all the
[1:52:45] nations baptizing them in the name of
[1:52:47] the Father Son and the Holy Ghost and
[1:52:52] these signs shall follow them that
[1:52:56] believe these signs shall follow them
[1:53:02] that believe the sign his only debate
[1:53:13] amen is only debate the miracles the
[1:53:18] signs it is the voice so there was a
[1:53:22] voice with Moses a man and the children
[1:53:27] the children of Israel had to hear Moses
[1:53:31] his voice Moses had to hear the engine
[1:53:34] they had to hear Moses our prophet heard
[1:53:39] the angel we have to hear the prophet
[1:53:46] not a world have to hear us
[1:53:50] why because we've taken all of this food
[1:53:55] that was laid up and we in the kitchen
[1:53:59] cook we in the kitchen cook we in the
[1:54:05] kitchen cooking and there's a de voice
[1:54:08] of the sign the spirit in the bride not
[1:54:18] then now is the time we're living in the
[1:54:27] day we're living in the greatest hour
[1:54:30] but we're also living in the most
[1:54:33] treacherous out now is the time now is

[1:54:41] this first surface to elevate your face
[1:54:45] to elevate your faith that's your
[1:54:48] subconscious your subconscious can take
[1:54:51] a whole of this word and believe nothing

[1:55:01] turn when and listen when we come to

[1:56:32] the man heard them and when they shadow
[1:56:37] walked over it wasn't a shadow that
[1:56:39] healed man it was the main faithful word
[1:56:42] what they will preach cause he heard
[1:56:46] what they were pre if we we have to
[1:56:51] understand that we have to get the faith

[2:00:05] when I go to the doctor sometime I have
[2:00:15] to undress I just recently went to the

[2:01:39] but she's a professional this is her job
[2:01:43] she can handle this because this is what
[2:01:47] has to be done so that the healing can
[2:01:52] take place of whatever the sickness is

[2:02:07] covering the religious cover and come

[2:11:13] [Music]
[2:11:19] just keep playing softly I'm gonna
[2:11:24] appreciate the word of the Lord on
[2:11:25] tonight the resurrection man we thank
[2:11:31] the world for a precious brother so much
[2:11:34] was shared I don't want to try to recap
[2:11:38] it all but one thing that really struck
[2:11:40] me was a statement that they said if we
[2:11:42] just have a little if we were just a
[2:11:46] little bit scared that it won't happen
[2:11:49] then it won't just if there's just the
[2:11:53] low fear maybe you know Lord I believe I
[2:11:56] got faith and I know that you can do
[2:11:58] this that sometimes hope in turns any
[2:12:00] would say well you did it for this
[2:12:02] person so I know you'll do it for me but
[2:12:04] it's not really faith standing but God
[2:12:06] whether you did it for anybody or not
[2:12:08] it's mine
[2:12:09] because you promised to me promised it
[2:12:11] to me sometimes you know we in turn to
[2:12:15] hope sometimes we're in turn to faith
[2:12:16] but we want all fear just to be removed
[2:12:19] and perfect love casts out all fear we
[2:12:21] don't want to be afraid of anything
[2:12:23] never afraid of one of God's promises
[2:12:26] right if one thing God cannot do if
[2:12:30] there's at least one thing that he
[2:12:32] cannot do God can't feel today man he's
[2:12:35] never failed and he won't fail now so
[2:12:38] Church we want to believe with
[2:12:40] everything we have and any man like a
[2:12:42] brother traversed and God's got some
[2:12:45] great things in store a man and not just
[2:12:48] houses and cars and things like that
[2:12:50] that's that's good but we want to see
[2:12:52] the spiritual things of God so we need
[2:12:54] we need blessings in both the upper
[2:12:57] springs and the and the lower Springs we
[2:12:59] we want heavenly blessings as well as
[2:13:01] earthly blessings but we want all that
[2:13:04] hallelujah Church I'm under expectation
[2:13:08] it's just thinking you know to myself
[2:13:10] there's something that I wanted to do
[2:13:12] tonight as we were entering this this
[2:13:16] Good Friday and I received a little text
[2:13:19] and you know with a quote and I said you
[2:13:21] know I like this and and I felt that it
[2:13:24] would just be very appropriate for us
[2:13:25] tonight we're coming out of a time of
[2:13:28] fasting and we're coming into this
[2:13:31] weekend or services and and brother Anna
[2:13:35] asked a question he said how many would
[2:13:38] like to rededicate their lives to the
[2:13:40] service of the Lord on this Good Friday
[2:13:42] night anybody would like to rededicate
[2:13:44] their life and he was preaching one good
[2:13:50] Friday night and then he acts that
[2:13:52] question in church and and many lifted
[2:13:55] their hands like we've done here tonight
[2:13:56] and and and he prayed a prayer and I
[2:13:59] want to pray this over you so just just
[2:14:01] bow your heads
[2:14:02] amen and just listen to the words of his
[2:14:05] prayer and in your heart I want you to
[2:14:07] just think about rededicating yourself
[2:14:10] to the service of the Lord there's been
[2:14:13] any doubt or unbelief or anything X God
[2:14:16] to forgive you for those things and ask
[2:14:17] him to just reimagine it you could just
[2:14:20] only believe Amen that you can only
[2:14:23] believe it Manny he makes this the
[2:14:25] statement here and I just want to I want
[2:14:27] to read it
[2:14:29] amen he says
[2:14:33] Lord on this Good Friday night
[2:14:36] so it's father I pray that you bless
[2:14:39] these who lifted their hands and those
[2:14:42] who did not even have the courage to do
[2:14:44] it and while I'm praying it's just if
[2:14:45] your hands to heaven while I'm praying
[2:14:48] to slip your hands to heaven and keep
[2:14:49] your eyes closed
[2:14:50] it says we prayed that the
[2:14:51] all-sufficient one tonight will bless
[2:14:53] every one of them we're thinking of
[2:14:56] Calvary God our Savior laid in the shame
[2:14:59] taken down was given to the hands of a
[2:15:02] wealthy man who taking this body after
[2:15:03] begging Pilate took it over and wrapped
[2:15:06] it in some clean linen - laying in the
[2:15:08] grave oh god what a feeling must have
[2:15:11] been over those poor disciples seemed
[2:15:13] like they were defeated at that time the
[2:15:15] one they had trusted so much was now
[2:15:18] gone but not for long
[2:15:19] just a bleeding sacrifice that was all
[2:15:22] some day a few hours later he arose and
[2:15:25] then joy came help us tonight Lord as
[2:15:28] we're in this season may it be upon us
[2:15:31] that we'll see the suffering that it
[2:15:33] costs for our Redemption the sadness it
[2:15:36] costs for us to be happy and may our
[2:15:38] souls tonight Lord we consecrate
[2:15:41] ourselves to thee and our souls be
[2:15:43] afflicted to look yonder and see what oh
[2:15:46] god what a horrible death how cruel sin
[2:15:49] must be and I pray father that you'll
[2:15:51] bless us together now and help down me O
[2:15:54] God as just servants standing here with
[2:15:56] the very poor voice and you children
[2:15:58] waiting to hear something from the word
[2:15:59] help me Lord and break the word of life
[2:16:02] freely to every everyone as we
[2:16:04] rededicate our lives and our hearts the
[2:16:07] tears of our hearts dropped down deep in
[2:16:10] our bosom when we think of a sacrifice
[2:16:12] help us now but we ask it in Christ's
[2:16:16] name Amen amen amen
[2:16:22] aid man thank you Jesus hallelujah it's
[2:16:28] just finger sing a few more courses of

[2:22:53] tonight
[2:23:01] thank you Jesus how we appreciate your
[2:23:05] presence thank you for your anointing
[2:23:09] thank you for your word that has come
[2:23:11] forth to our hearts tonight Lord as we
[2:23:14] were encouraged to stay in the kitchen
[2:23:17] God and keep serving this wonderful food
[2:23:21] that has been given in this hour to us
[2:23:24] Oh God Lord don't let us get out of our
[2:23:27] place but the blessing is when we are in
[2:23:29] our place
[2:23:31] Israel was blessed as long as they were
[2:23:33] in the land when they got out of the
[2:23:35] land they lost their blessing so father
[2:23:37] we pray that we would just receive what
[2:23:39] we heard here tonight and God I have the
[2:23:41] scripture that was read we're crucified
[2:23:44] with Christ nevertheless we live yet not
[2:23:47] as that's us that's living but if it's
[2:23:50] Christ living on the inside and we thank
[2:23:52] you Father father Paul said the life
[2:23:55] that we now live it means that we live
[2:23:57] something different before but since you
[2:24:00] came into our hearts since you came into
[2:24:02] our lives we live a different life now
[2:24:04] and God we're grateful for the life that
[2:24:07] you have given us Lord our prayer this
[2:24:10] that we would Lord just stay close to
[2:24:12] you a man don't let us walk in doubt and
[2:24:15] fear and unbelief with your bright weird
[2:24:18] people or we should
[2:24:20] proper said we live in a million miles
[2:24:22] beneath our privileges so help us to
[2:24:25] elevate to rise to another level to rise
