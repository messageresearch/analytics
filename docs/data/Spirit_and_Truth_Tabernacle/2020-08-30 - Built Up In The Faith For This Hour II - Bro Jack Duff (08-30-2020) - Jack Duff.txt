hallelujah thank you jesus my god my god amen amen it's so good to be in the house of the lord so good to be in the house of the lord [Applause] amen let me uh i got a couple of prayer requests that i just want to make mention while we're still standing and man we want to just uh mention these and and pray over them um i got a call this morning from brother jiron there for the west coast church and he's saying he has a nephew by the name of steve there in trinidad steve is 20 years old and he's on life support and the doctors have no idea what the cause is they just don't know what the reason and why he's going through something like this and the families just kind of tore up and they just need a prayers and man for this 20 year old young man and all i can just imagine is you know me having a 20 year old like that and and so much life ahead of them and just not sure what's going on so we pray that god will give wisdom to the doctors and and that they would touch the body a man of steve there a man in um in trinidad we also have a request of prayer from sister vernon says i'm requesting prayer for my cousin alicia for surgery on her brain on tomorrow she has a tumor on the brain and doctor says she need to make a decision on her um [Music] or baby a man she's leaving in the hands of god so let's stand in faith with her amen so uh we want to just take elisha um before the lord as well i'm assuming is alicia pregnant and expecting okay all right so all right we'll just leave this we'll take this a man in god's hands he's he's a known time god man he's never too late and uh and it's just good to know that we can bring everything a man into his presence uh believe him for the absolute impossible and doctors say there's no hope we know that god still offers hope amen so we want to just take these requests amen to the lord let's just bow our heads and father we come in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ god we are uh praying for a couple requests that have been presented to us here this morning brother jairon has a little nephew 20 years old there and trinidad doctors are just not sure why he is in the condition he's saying they don't know what's caused it but we realize it is a devil a god that has attacked this young man's body and we come against the devil in the name of jesus we we realized god that the doctors may be at a at a lord just at a place where they just don't know what to do but father we know we can turn to you in times like this and know that you're able to intervene and you're able to make the difference so what god we come and we uh trust that you would touch steve we send the word of healing uh to trinidad god that you will raise them up from this condition may that be a complete turnaround and father uh life in this body we're going to continue to ask for life oh god so we just pray father to move by your your mighty hand upon steve even right now we also come uh on behalf of sister verna's cousin elisha lord she has a tumor that has developed and they need to do surgery on tomorrow doctors have uh told her to decide whether it's going to be her or whether the baby and lord what uh what a situation for a mother to be in that she has to decide on her life for the baby's life oh god we pray that you give them both life amen we uh we've heard the testimony we heard the testimony of your prophet his wife was suffering from a tumor and he prayed a prayer before the doctor's hands would touch amen her body amen that the tumor would be dissolved so we call the same jesus on the scene today before the doctor's hand would touch alicia's body praise god may she be spared may the baby be spared and if she does not know you in the parting of sin oh god may she come to know you in that manner father we commit these requests into your hands and father there are other requests here in this building today that a man will not put in but lord they know what's in the heart we ask that you would meet your people at the point of their need be glorified and magnified in all of our circumstances in jesus name we pray amen amen let's give the lord a hand of praise you may be seated amen in the presence of the lord um i wanted to welcome a man this is uh is it dandy pinkus is that right did i get that right all right god bless you so good to have you with us on today amen this is sister

will seat you in different places thank you for having the my pleasure attitude amen we really appreciate it god bless you uh so our outreach has started a man and we uh uh i think on two weeks ago we we went out and gave out about 24 boxes of food and then last week we went out and gave about 44 boxes of food and uh so the numbers are starting to climb uh every week and we're just very grateful for those that have been able to assist we'll be going back out on thursday and if you'd like to join us please let us know amen i'm sure uh you'll be blessed amen just to be able to be a help to some other family so if you'd like to be a part of our outreach opportunity where we are uh taking over a food pantry and we're blessing the neighborhood with food and just others that come through the neighborhood we're doing everything we can to make a difference and we start out with natural food but we're praying that god will open up the opportunity for us to also give some spiritual food that is that's why we're there so if you'd like to be a part of that please amen let us know uh let myself or sister tinas and satinus the sister there in the back that pulls everything up on the screen amen so if you'd like to help out just let us know and we'll get you plugged in amen god bless you let me give the uh giving um as as you can see we still have the ability for you to give online and uh we have cash app and we have paypal uh here in the church we won't necessarily be passing the baskets anymore but we do have a box on the table a wooden box that you can put your offering in if you desire to do so but if you want to use paypal just use the cash symbol uh i'm sorry the cash app you want to use cash up use cash symbol spirit and truth t and if you want to use paypal make sure you choose giving to a friend or family member and use the email address of giving at john423.org amen praise the lord so let us have a word of prayer over our giving and we will move forward from there father we thank you for the ability that you have given us to be able to give to the kingdom of god thank you for supplying our needs through this great time thank you for uh lord just being jehovah

in advance for our new church and a new school we thank you lord for the monies that have been given towards that and uh lord we know that those dollars will not just sit in the bank as it was prayed early this week lord my brother solomon was not money there just to sit in the bank but it's money to be used for a purpose and god we know that you're bringing us into that new land that you have for us so god and we just thank you in advance for it so bless your people as they give from their hearts return it back to each and every one a hundredfold it's in jesus name that we pray amen amen praise the lord god bless you thank you musicians i really appreciate you all god bless you god bless you amen so um i want to just read a a scripture we started down a little path on last week and i told you i'll come back in and um just hopefully finish it up amen on today um we were reading from matthew 17 uh verse 14 through 21. and i'll just ask that you stand with me as we read the word of the lord amen hallelujah see when the if you ever had to go to court uh and the judge walks into the courtroom they make a statement to everyone as he walks in they say all rise and we got a judge that's greater than any judge in our united states and this is the king of kings and lords of lords and as we read his word then we rise amen amen and honor respect to our judge and our king matthew 17 just starting at verse 14 it says and when they were come [Music] to the multitude there came to him a certain man kneeling down to him and saying lord have mercy uh oh my son for he is lunatic and so vexed for all times he falleth into the fire and often to the water so you can imagine his father uh having to be very concerned about where his son's gonna end up that day uh is he gonna be in fire is it gonna be on water you know what what is it you know what's going on here so you can imagine just what the father might be going through and the the father makes a statement here in verse 16 it says and i i brought him to thy disciples uh and they could not cure him then jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him hither to me jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour it says uh then came the disciples to jesus apart and said why could not we cast him out and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if you have faith as a grain of a mustard seed ye shall uh ye shall say unto this mountain remove hands to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you i love those those words from the lord jesus nothing shall be impossible unto you how be this kind uh go with not out but by prayer and fasting the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word god as we've read your word we invite you now to come and give us clarity on what you're trying to speak to us today raise and anoint our faith lord to walk into this place that you were trying to get the disciples to walk in we take every spirit that's against the spirit of god underneath the control of the holy spirit even right now be glorified and magnified in this place jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated amen in the presence of the lord uh we were talking on the subject last week built up in the faith for this hour amen built up in the faith for this hour and we want to continue our journey uh in this uh i was pulling this from uh a quote this is paragraph three out of spiritual food in due season uh god's prophet makes a statement to us at the very beginning of this sermon a man spiritual food in due season now i i mentioned to you that you know this would be a good message for you to go back and listen to when you just look at the titles sometimes of the message that brother branham would preach there is a message within the message right and and it's very important to just try to see what the holy spirit is actually trying to tell you and when he uses the title spiritual food and due season amen just by prophecy by by by by scripture amen by prophecy that's written in scripture there was going to come a day where we would be on the earth and there would be a famine in the land oh hallelujah amen this is greater than not having food at walmart right this is greater than not having food at out all days and amen this is greater than any of those things like that this famine would be a famine for actually hearing the word of god amen so so so so you know i have uh uh for some reason the lord has allowed me to kind of come in contact with people in the last few months where uh focus saying i met i met a lady last night and i we just went to pray for us see you know uh dealing with cancer we went to pray for and and and i was just talking to about church and everything and she said yes i was going to church amen but i have no desire to go back to that church and there's a lot of folk that are in that same condition i've heard multiple people say i don't want to go back to where i came from what it is is that they are experiencing amen a famine in the land spiritual famine is in the land hallelujah and if there's spiritual famine in the land glory then there's got to be a place where the people can go and be fair so their spiritual food and due season and i'm here to tell you like my auntie said it if you're willing to steal away from all the unbelief [Music] if you're willing to do something different you can eat spiritually blessed be the name of the lord come on church amen amen i i i i god don't make mistakes amen and sometimes it take a pandemic to get people where god wanted them to be all alone amen so i say praise the lord all right let's look at something here i'm pulling from this discernment spiritual food in due season he makes this statement says i know many of you are standing again tonight he says and outside met groups that said they couldn't get in and they're listening to their radio and in the different cars and and and we can just add to that people streaming on the internet right he says uh it says and now we're trying to make make just as quick as we can tonight on sunday night we give over to to pray for the sick have a prayer line as we can get one up here but we are dedicating the service tonight for the prayer for the sick now this is a statement that i want to bring out it says now i want you to get built up now this holy oracles of god in the faith the faith of this hour that is critical statement amen it's the faith of this hour that i i see see let me just just just pause on that just for a second and and and noah's day in order to get inside the ark you had to be a man anointed and and and underneath the inspiration of the faith for that hour hallelujah amen in moses day in order to put blood on the door you had to be anointed and under the inspiration of the faith for that hour if you wanted the death angel to pass your house you had to believe what moses was saying if you wanted to get into the ark of safety you had to believe the message that noah was preaching amen there's faith for the hour in which you live in and i'm telling you the hour with you if you can expect the rapture of the church so you don't need faith for this hour wrapped in faith it goes on to say this the faith is going to take more faith than ever was in any age amen for this has to be wrapped in faith glory to be taken up i'll stop right there this has to be rapturing faith to be taken up see so so you know this this this is going to take greater faith than any other day now now i don't want us to uh to to misinterpret and misunderstand that as far as a greater faith amen because as we were just reading in the scripture you know jesus was telling them you just gotta have faith the size of a grain of a mustard seed that means your faith has got to be pure oh can i go a little further your faith has got to be pure in a message that god has sent you hallelujah because the rapture and faith that you're looking for is actually laying inside the books and the tapes amen church right so so god has sent you a message to actually help you get prepared for a rapture this is why many churches won't even preach about a rapture they are so confused when it comes to talking about the rapture yet there's a promise in the scripture that we shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye and ain't no devil gonna stop that jesus hallelujah there is so much that is that is before us i uh i'm watching prophecies fulfilled quickly you know before 1933 in 1933 god's prophet had a vision before he was going to church and there were seven visions seven things that he saw happen he said before the coming of the lord say there were seven things 1933 and one of the things that he saw he said there would be a woman that would rise up in power and it says she might be a president or a vice president or she could be the catholic church hallelujah because we know the catholic church according to scripture got a lot of power amen amen revelation tells us all that right he said but he said he said but but it could be a woman that would rise up in power say now you got to watch some things you know uh if if the election and i don't want to get too too far off into politics but if the election don't take place we're going to have a woman in power and if the democratic party wins we're gonna have another woman in power so prophecy is actually about to be manifested and we don't even realize where we act hallelujah church so so i don't get too wrapped up in all of this into that get wrapped up in what god is saying in his word hallelujah i mean because as i see these things manifested i got one prayer i got one prayer and it's the very last prayer that was prayed in scripture even so come lord jesus all right all right all right we want to get you built up in the faith for this hour this hour all right let's go on here amen in this uh in this in this uh sermon glory to god i was i was bringing this out let me go to paragraph 60 uh in that same sermon i was bringing this out because i read to you on last week um and i'll read it again in a second but let's just go to paragraph six and spiritual food and due season he says now we see uh that modern trend of the people then on the days are past there's no such thing as miracles the the people are all emotionally worked up listen to that elijah the prophet cry out again now now when he say that people all emotionally work up now you worked up go back and think about what happened in the days of elijah amen when he when he came out then he challenged all the other prophets and he said need to challenge the whole nation of israel and say let the god that answered by fire be god it says i'll tell you what you're going to do we're going to set up two altars you're going to be build an altar to bell and i'm i'm gonna set up an altar to god he's saying i'm gonna let y'all go in the morning then i'll come in the evening time and while they were building up their altar that the bible said they began to cut themselves and and just do all kind of crazy things to try to get there god to answer why while elijah sat there and just pretty much laughed at them all and said now maybe your god is hard of hearing he says maybe your god is on vacation maybe your god didn't show up amen at the showdown you understand maybe your god didn't pay attention to the appointment that was on the calendar amen we said let the gods and answer about fire be god where is your god and they did all kind of emotional things to get the attention of their god lord that god never moved he said okay i'm tired of it enough is enough y'all push this stuff to the side now i mean now now let me build my altar you say now i'm gonna do i'm gonna dig a trench and he dig a trench he said put some water in there cause fire and water don't mix put water he what he said i'm gonna make this thing impossible put some water in the trees put some more water in the trench that ain't enough put more three times they put water in the trench cause three is the number perfection it said he said put it in a trench he said he said no no not just back up everybody one man standing against 800 of them i believe 400 prophets of baal and 400 of the grove he saved 800 people he's standing here standing against the government oh come on church standing against ahab and his wife jezebel amen stand against everybody stood there because he had thus saith the lord yeah it says god i did this at your words you you told me to come out here and do this now turn their hearts back to you god he said now i'm here let the god that answer by fire let them be god here come fire from heaven and consume the sacrifice that was on the altar now they agreed that the god that answered by fire would be would be god but did they stay with it no according to scripture they didn't stay with it hallelujah what are you agreeing to today amen hallelujah i'm here to tell you that that same god that that manifested himself for elijah is still manifesting himself today and if god has done anything for you you ought to be satisfied enough in that to serve him with everything you got hallelujah all right all right all right all right i'm reading this amen it says uh uh listen to that elijah the prophet cried out cry out against them and the theologians notice notice uh he was uh he spoke as if he was god himself that that's a statement that just blows me away he spoke as if he was god himself you got to watch these little statements that he'd be slipping in there on us he spoke as if he was god himself now where he's getting that from us is uh first uh first kings 17 1 when when when elijah said you know what it ain't gonna rain until i say so not not not oh that's powerful to me look king of ahab don't even have anybody fast don't even have anybody pray don't do nothing until you come see me all right i mean he spoke it he said he said it won't rain until i called for it and do you realize for three and a half years no rain and then then elijah shows up and he has this this mighty uh uh demonstration and and after the demonstration he said now you tell the servant said give thee up tell they have get up it's about to rain wait a minute now uh it's about to rain it it don't look like it's about to rain uh uh elijah said i said get me up it's about to rain say now he told the servicer now go up and look and see if it's about to rain he said i went up to the top of the mountain i don't see nothing i went up again i still don't see nothing he said and now you can imagine if you ever had to climb a mountain you know it ain't easy to go up and down that mountain but here this ain't florida this ain't flat land that he's running this man is running up and down a mountain all day long he'd say i don't see nothing he said go up seven times all right go up seven times and say on the seventh time the man goes up and he sees one change hallelujah amen and it was just a little change on the seventh time it wasn't anything big he looked up in god's big beautiful sky they say i see a cloud but the cloud is so small elijah the cloud is the size of a man's hand that's all i see is the cloud the size of a man said i'ma tell you something if you see something that small that's enough to start praising god about bless it be his holy name you ain't got to see nothing big see something small and begin to worship as you worship when it's small you'll make it big hallelujah so that's all i see is a cloud the size of a man they said get get get ready it's about the rain it's it's about it's about to be an outpouring and i believe that it's going to be an outpouring out poor ring glory y'all gonna get spiritually wet [Applause] spiritually wet yes brother you can tell when somebody's been in the ring and that's what we want we want to feel it spiritually we want to know people have been in the ring hallelujah they're soaked glory to god there's a change taking place on the inside oh hallelujah church amen amen but i tell you he said get up he said it's going to rain and and god god manifested based on elijah's words based on the lives of where he brought the reign and and this is why brother branham said it's as if he was taking god's place god is the one that controls the ring god's the one that does that god controls so much amen but you see that that same god that stepped into elijah manifested himself in in the flesh of jesus this is why he could get on a boat and when a storm was coming out of nowhere jesus was sleeping glory to god jesus was sleeping can i tell you what you should be doing when you're really going through great trials i'm talking about when your bills can't get paid i'm telling when the doctor gave you some bad news i want to tell you what to do when that happens go to sleep because your god got everything under control don't you wait up at night your worrying will not change the situation but your faith change anything nothing shall be impossible until you if you just use your faith glory to god somebody glory to god i'm talking about your faith the one that he gave you just use that faith let it be pure faith only speak what the word says call things that be not as though they were brother i see thousands in the past i see myself healed i see myself going to the doctor and the doctor pronouncing that something has changed i see myself you got to speak it over yourself before it happens i'm trying to build you up in the faith for this hour we're not a defeated group of people hey man we're not a defeated a defeated group of people not not not the pride so jesus the devil said i'm gonna take him out brought a storm jesus just sleeping in the middle of a storm sleeping so good that the disciples had to go wake him up shaking him and jesus but that wasn't the first that time the first time that happened there was another prophet in the bible that went to sleep in the middle of a storm his name was jonah all right and he was even out the will of god sleeping and you're gonna be worried in the will of god the devil is a liar brother i'll sleep [Applause] [Music] he was at the will of god sleeping they had to wake jonah now he was trying to i ain't going to tell him i ain't going to tell him everything uh well could you tell us what god do you serve uh jehovah well what why is this come upon us what's going on what did you do jonah we're trying to figure out what happened because this is not this is not ordinary well you know he told me to go to a particular city and i didn't go why why would you do something like that rebuked by unbelievers why would you do something like that says i i don't know i i i'm just you know i just do so they start praying next thing you notice that we can't figure out what to do he said i got an answer for you throw me overboard they say no man we can't do that we can't leave you in the sea like that you know he said no just throw me overboard your problems go away if i get off the ship especially when i'm out the will of god oh come on somebody y'all stay with me but some of y'all going through things because you're out the will of god amen but if i can just get y'all just get me off the ship everything gonna be all right it says uh we're gonna pray said now lord don't don't hold this against us this is what this man said we're gonna throw him off the ship but please don't hold up against us one two three and as soon as they dump jonah the storm stop some of y'all got some jonas y'all should be dumping hey man from jonah situations in your life you need to dump it your storm will stop come on somebody they dumped in the storm stop cease say they know what happened to the fellow can you imagine these men probably going to the city to sell some fish and they look up on the shore and the fella that they dumped come on church is not preaching the gospel and they trying to now them men probably couldn't wait to repent oh god say we know we just dumped this man into the ocean i don't even know how he got here to the shore to preach the gospel but jonah's testimonies god prepare the fish and say even even unbelief say no now well ain't got a throat large enough to swallow a man no no no you you misunderstood the scripture it was a prepared fish this was a unique fish can i say it this way this was a predestinated fish amen and this fish was was designed by god to do the job that he needed swallow jonah and then take him to the city that i told him to go to hallelujah if you want to go by boat you'll go by fish but you're going to go where god wants you to go all right church hallelujah amen let's uh jesus was there he rose up from the the after the disciples woke him he rose up and he went to the just front of the boat and just spoke he said peace be still i want to say that to coronavirus peace be still every sickness every disease peace be still [Music] every wave that the enemies toss in our direction we speak to it peace be still he spoke to the wind and the ways how anything contrary to god's will he we speak to it in the name of the lord jesus can i go a little further amen this this statement that i'm making here in spiritual food and due season just reading this amen um says uh listen to that elijah uh the prophet cried against him and their theologians noticed notice he spoke as if he was god himself elijah spoke as if he was god himself the dew will not fall from heaven until i call for it that's that's that's first kings 17 1 you'll find it there he says amen yes sir the prophet had been so long in the presence of god the prophets of the old testament or any time when they lived in the presence of god until they become the word their message is the word itself he says and remember he said thus saith the lord and when those men had those messages from god and they um he says and they become so wrapped up that their own thinking it might have been against their thinking they might have not they might not have been able to see it right but they they were speaking the word of god thus saith the lord there will not be any ring till i call for it oh what a statement he had been in the presence of god had been vindicated uh so perfect and remember that also follows amos 3 7 the lord god will do nothing until first he reveals it to his servants the prophets so there's not going to be any rainfall right so here this prophet is so wrapped up uh uh in the word of god and under the inspiration of god that he actually has taken the place of god to speak certain things on the earth this is a powerful thing to think about i mean here elijah's so wrapped up in and i don't want to just leave it at elijah amen i'll show you also this happened in the ministry of moses amen another prophet that gets so wrapped up in in the things of god i showed you last week that even happened in god's prophet brother branham there were certain things that he spoke while he was here on the earth he took the place of god to say things like that paul amen in scripture also took the place of god to say things in scriptures recorded that paul say i say this not the lord when he was talking about marriage of divorce paul say this this is what i'm saying and god recorded it [Music] i want you to think about that god allowed what he what he said to be recorded in scripture and he's clearly telling about it this ain't what the lord said this is what i'm saying oh there's a place god is calling us to now it's very easy for me to leave that prophets and and all that but i'm gonna i'm gonna bring it forward amen a little bit further today because i'm trying to build us and build us up in the faith of this hour let's look at moses just for a second amen before we go before we go further let's look at something exodus 14. praise the name of the lord exodus 14. now um this is a the the the story of the children of israel coming out of egypt um god had already told abraham that his children uh his seed would be in bondage for over 400 years down in this land and say but then he's going to come down and he's going to deliver them so god already has prophesied it there's a plan in place god has a man born by the name of moses was protected at his birth and so many miracles happened amen around him uh he knew it by by his mother's revelation he knew that he was supposed to be to deliver now he tried to deliver the people in his own strength but it didn't work out in his own strengths so so he ended up running a man to the to the wilderness for 40 years and while he was back there on the back side of the desert he met god in the form of a burning bush god spoke to him out of that burning bush sent moses with a commission and moses had all kind of excuses as to why he couldn't do what god was calling him to do and i want to tell you something god amen did not uh listen to any of those excuses god did not accept any of those excuses and i want to tell you if you have some excuses that you're giving god this morning god is not accepting any of your excuses blessed be the name of the lord amen i can't do it because of this i can't do it because of that i'm not this i'm not god is not accepting any of your excuses if you expected god to feel sorry for you he does it amen all right let's go on a little further moses finally gets the people to a spot where he's bringing them out of the land of egypt finally he see the manifestation of what god told him we see it coming to pass after he's gone going down and called for for frogs and and flies and and all kind of things these pin plagues that he set on the egyptians uh now now uh god has finally got the people out of egypt but they run into a great trial they run into uh the red sea hallelujah now this kind of i want to just kind of put it this way because um you know what if what if by us coming back together the devil set a trial into the church what is going to be our position is everybody going to say i see brother jack shouldn't have is that gonna be the first thing out of your mouth as a believer praise the lord i didn't get too many amens cause i know that's what folk gonna say i i i step out on faith i'm okay with that i believe god's gonna keep us he's tempted this fight he'll keep us on hey man glory to god if you get sick i'm praying for you i'm going to rebuke the devil last night we i don't even see sometimes it's hard to even tell testimonies because you don't know where people faith that you tell you you know as soon as if anybody die anybody anybody it don't matter who they are if you hear death first thing was it covet that's the first thing coming out of everybody's mouth was no it was just old age oh okay i i mean the prophet told that was told by the angel lord said not even cancer standing wait in the way your prayer if the if the angel would have said not even covet we would have said what do you mean covet we want to know none about nokovic right but cancer used to be the thing that everybody was afraid of but you know what we're seeing god here in this church heal people of cancer the thing that everybody when doctors give up when they say stage four that means it's over for you right god got to move on your behalf and we seeing god do it so why we gonna let our faith get weak now if there was ever at least one church that should be able to still thrive in the midst of a pandemic this church should be able to thrive based on what we've seen god already do and i'm here to take ain't nothing too hard for our god amen last night we went to pray for somebody and we got there we thought it was the wrong house nobody come out like we don't know it's every dark around here we don't know where we at then we uh say we called somebody said no you had the wrong house you need to go with this other place it was okay we're gonna go to the other place our our commission is to pray we're going to pray went to the other house we got there and knocked on the door that was all dark and knocked the door they turn on the light and say okay all right we going in the prey lady come to the door had a mask on i said okay they start talking to her and she uh she said i would advise that y'all don't come in this house why we're here to pray we got coveted in here and we didn't know that we found out we was at the wrong house again but you know what i realized i said well we didn't go inside you ain't got to be afraid we stayed outside and we were about 12 foot is that good but as as we as we realize it won a mistake that we showed up at these people's house and they tell us that they got code as sons of god we gather and we pray for those people outside the house expecting god to heal them from tokyo god don't make mistakes see sometimes we just be so wrapped up in fear that we can't even hear the voice of god no no no no no no no i said no no we there's not no mistake let's pray let's pray we pray said lord let it let it be that when they when they come out of this they'll remember it was three guys showed up at my house by mistake oh you thought it was by mistake it was by predestination now that not how many other houses had covet in that neighborhood but god say here i say see i'm not telling the brothers so you know back in the bible days they would have been walking by foot going from house to house god let us have a car so we can get in this car go back to the other house and pray for the other person amen we expecting god to do something amen let me rebut moses so moses was finally got the people out they run into a really big trial the red sea now look at what happens here and and now um this is in uh uh exodus 14 13. now um the big trial that they have is the red sea is in front of them pharaoh's army is behind them they have nowhere to go they're trapped god got to do something impossible for his people i'ma tell y'all something god loved to put us in situations where things seem impossible he liked to put us there because he get more glory in a situation like that and i i like what brother jose said are we uh are we called just to pray for people with no issues he said he said you know if you got this type of sickness go see brother kwaku but if you if you if you you know you you okay and you just need a little prayer come see me say no that's not what god called us to god called us to impossible situations amen hallelujah glory to god a doctor will face it you see the doctor the doctor's not running home they're going to work you got nurses on the front line where the church at where the church is amen are we on the front line or what praise the lord uh uh you you got it oh i'm sorry we'll be praying for you you got to be over there land hand take your bottle of oil come on somebody read james 5. anointed with oil pray for him and and move on amen all right let me try to preach this uh i'm in exodus 14. they they have this great this great problem but but look at what happened in the midst of this problem amen amen moses by inspiration steps up and says moses said unto the people now god didn't tell moses to say these things but what i want you to understand is that god was veiling himself in moses so since god was veiling himself in moses moses could speak as if he was god i hope that ain't too heavy for the church amen moses could speak as if he was god because god was filled in him look at this moses said unto the people fear ye not i want to tell that to the church this morning fear ye not stand still see the salvation of the lord which he will show you today and god didn't tell moses to say any of that now moses is out here on his own but see he realized he wasn't on his own and i realized we realized we're not on our own because greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world it said moses said unto the people feeling not stand still and see the salvation lord which he will show to you today for the egyptians whom ye have seen today oh what a word here ye shall see them again no more forever that fellow who faced that's chasing you right now you're gonna see his face no more forever god god told moses i'm god now god and telmo said moses just said it by inspiration now i'm gonna tell you how how how far he was under inspiration he just let it let it flow right out of his mouth and i'm gonna tell you when he said this god was in heaven like oh yes praise and i can't pray thank you moses you know god i mean god was just like yes that's my son down there speaking here come moses in the very next verse athlete unspoke all these powerful words and inspired the people they said verse i'm sorry uh the next says the lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your feasts uh hold your peace and the lord said unto moses wherefore cries that one to me now look at the change from verse 14 to verse 15. look at verse 14 again the lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace that means i ain't gonna fight this thing and then the next verse and the lord said unto moses what happened in between verse 14 and 15. you got to get in between the scenes because in the very next verse moses says the lord said the lord said to moses wherefore christ now unto me speaking to the children of israel that they go forward we're not going back are we going forward moses start crying moses started like uh lord what am i what am i gonna do and god's like what you gonna do you're the one just saying that the egyptians they seen today they ain't gonna see no more forever you just said that you make it happen moses moses didn't know what to do under the inspiration he was lost see see see now here's the thing god will actually anoint us to do some things and then he's going to feel like ain't nothing happened but when you say to the mountain be thou removed be thou cast into the sea if the mountain is moving one grain of sand at a time the mountain is still moving god don't want you to doubt after you release something out of your mouth god didn't doubt when he released out his mouth let there be you you want to know how how sure god god was there was that light was going to come god started working on something else when he said let there be light he knew light was coming even if it took a billion years he knew light was coming we got to have that kind of faith don't change your testimony after you don't spoke it moses say uh god said moses what you doing don't don't cry to me speak tell the people to keep going forward i'm like i don't he said moses take the rod that you got in your hand and do something with it stretch it out took the rod and stretched it out when he stretched right out he said he said now the sea just began to part and moses probably still don't know what this what this mean we gonna go i know to go forward come on everybody two million people walking forward while they walking here comes pharaoh's army hallelujah but god because he spoke through moses had to honor what moses said even moses didn't know what the end result was going to be but god knew god knew what the end result was gonna be just speak it moses i got this under control now watch this get everybody through the sea well yeah we got everybody through the scene now we're gonna do just turn around and watch your enemy watch watch watch watch what i do to your enemy and got them out in the middle of the sea see even people people people try to criticize say well they walked they walked at a time where the water wasn't even high they walked at a time where i mean it was so low it was easy for the people to walk amen through the sea that sounds good to the intellectual mind but a prophet turns it and says well if it's if they walk through at a time like that how is it that they drive that same little bitty water that they want because how did it drown the whole army see we're gonna give god the glory we're gonna give them the praise we know that he's making a way and he's only making a way for us he won making a way for pharaoh he was making a way for the children of israel hallelujah you watch your enemies drowning this season all right let me go on a little further it was in moses it was in it was in um it was in in elijah i showed you last week how even the prophet was used but i want to bring it home i want to want to talk talk about you amen let's let's just go back to something here my question was is it only for the prophets uh i want to go to this message um god perfecting his church god perfecting his church thank you lord i told you it's a sermon in the sermon god perfecting his church look at what the prophet says to us says see how the devil robs you see how the devil robs you say oh you can't do this all things are possible to them that believe no matter what it is you are a part of deity a son or daughter not a servant a son or a daughter says why brother it surpasses angels archangels and everything else it comes right into the presence of the potter himself and how are we brought through the blood amen then you come into deity you become a part you're welded in i'm talking about myself now see i you know i when i my i almost i guess my inspiration is i know who i am that's my inspiration on this built up and built you know built up in the faith of this hour but i want to i'm inspired to just tell you i know who i am look it says let let's think of god folding around him now we're going to enlarge it billions of times from this blood cell and there god in his blood cell folded himself up and wrapped himself in this blood cell and come to redeem man to life hallelujah there when that blood cell spread out spread out bl brought the body of christ jesus jehovah brings sons and daughters to himself in the blood cell to the blood of the lord jesus christ into himself and we become a part of god amen he says that's what makes satan mad you want to see the devil get furious upset now i'm going to tell y'all something right now let me just let me let me advise you there's gonna be trials after this sermon i just read it to you the devil is mad right so the first thing come out your mouth see brother no no say the devil is a liar the devil's mad and we're glad that's what makes satan man that's what shakes him when the church of jesus christ uh when the church of jesus christ only knew who they were brother or you say i know there's nothing impossible with god he said there is nothing impossible to you amen that changes the subject doesn't it and i had to read that quote to change the subject i put it on elijah i put it on moses i showed you how i was in brother branham now i'm changing the subject i'm putting it on you thank you i'm putting it on you glory to god i'm putting it on the bride of christ amen he says all they say there's nothing impossible god he said there's nothing impossible with you whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it amen amen i'm going a little further i got some more to read this is coming from the resurrection of lazarus i got to change the subject i got to put this in the church i'm going to tell you if you want these seeds to grow you got to take time to put them in amen watch this resurrection of lazarus it says now notice that's uh that's where you are that's what's the matter with you pentecostal people it's my lot of this afternoon to preach and and i have a right here at the platform i don't never want to know any person from the flesh when i'm standing here that's what's the matter with the pentecostal people they don't recognize who they are your sons amen and daughters of god you have in your hand uh look look then jesus it was one time quote in scripture ye are gods it says look deity i'm part of charles branham because i was born from the charles charlie branham my daddy i'm part of him i got a forehead like him my hair was like him i'm a small man like him i'm in the nature like him because he's my dad and if we become in spirit sons of god deity dwells in the man hallelujah then you talk about blind eyes being open they said nothing impossible to god god saying nothing impossible with you if you believe not with god but you deities in man not just hitting the prophet in us if we got the holy ghost this is laying inside of us the very god that stood back there on a mythical platform of eternities and rolled worlds off his hand and created things gives you the privilege to be his son and you're a part of him and god dwells in mankind and man himself is deity all right and the reason why it makes you deity is because god the spirit of god lives in you you can't be deity by yourself but when you have the spirit of god living in you it makes you a part of him all right can we go further it says there you are it might choke you but study over that a little while see uh god dwells in man and man becomes the son of god not him in himself but the holy spirit that's in him is god the creator lives in the creation oh my how i think of that then stand with an unwavering faith and ask what you will it'll be done there there he is god there he is now you know um i was just you know just meditating on this and i was thinking on the scripture of peter and john when they went to the temple i said is this just for prophets or is this for just normal people because you know peter was just normal just like us he was so normal he was so normal that he doubted all the time i mean the great things could happen and the man go right back into doubt right i mean uh uh uh uh but but but peter you know was the same guy that you know jesus come walking on water he's on the ship they was in the midst of a storm again they weren't sleeping they was crying like oh what we going to do and here comes jesus walking in the midst of a storm right towards the disciples i'm not while the water was calm god does his best work when things are in chaos [Applause] i mean that's a man that can turn on lights so when it's chaotic look for him to show up so here he come walking underwater in chaos walking out there to the disciples and they're like oh lord i'm not not this this is just too far it's hard for us to doubt them but we don't know whether to believe him or not so peter says if it be you i mean i i don't know too much about i ain't never seen this in all my days if it be you i got one one request bid me to come now i'ma tell you something just kind of struck me the reason peter could get out that boat because he recognized the voice he didn't need a paragraph he didn't need a sentence he knew the voice oh hallelujah and you're gonna need to know the voice of god hallelujah my sheep know my voice and a stranger they won't follow peter recognize that voice and say okay he said come boys i'm coming at the ship peter got himself out of that ship and and i'm i'm talking about a man born just like you sinful man peter began to walk on water and he was walking for a good while i'ma tell you when he start sinking come on y'all ain't with me today i'ma tell you the only time he starts sinking is when he allowed doubt to come in and if we don't allow doubt we won't sing i'm trying to build you up in the faith of this house this can't just be a bible story right now i ain't gonna tell you go out there and walk on water i'm not telling you to go do that i can't say that but i will say this that if you like like when we found ourselves at that house the other night we didn't know i said you know what the bible told us that if we drunk any deadly thing if we if we if we touch the scorpion and didn't realize it was death we did anything uh that we wanted one sure he said he'd be there with us so i'm i'ma trust god in his word i'm gonna tell y'all something i can't trust one doctor i can't trust one governor i can't trust a president or vice president i can't trust a senator i can't trust none of them but i can trust god i can trust god i i mean i and and if i find myself in a situation not that i'm going looking for situations cause some folk look for trouble i'm not looking for trouble but if i find myself in a situation i'm gonna wrap myself in a promise from god and expect that he's going to take care of him amen amen praise the lord hallelujah glory glory glory this oh god let me keep going so i want to go back to the scripture in matthew 17 we read now in order to understand matthew 17 we got to read just a little bit of matthew 10. we're going to read verse 1 and verse 7 and 8 and matthew 10. trying to build you up in the faith of the sound i i i was talk about peter and i didn't finish that thought but uh peter also had the ability to speak on god's behalf peter was going to church one day and there was a fella and and the prophet even said no doubt jesus left that man in that condition for a reason because he knew peter would handle it later on but peter and john on their way to church one day and they probably going to church all the time they see this man begging arms can i get a little something can i get a little something and peter just this day it just kind of hit him he was steadfast on the man like he's like uh not that i'm tired of you begging but it's like i perceive you you want something better than this so so so so peter said look on us man say okay put his cup out no no no no no no seven go have i none but such as i have i'm giving it to you rise up and walk in the name of the lord jesus christ see the man rose up and said and he had faith just to get up but he wouldn't have have enough faith to keep start walking so pete and him just held him up a little bit till it till till till all the bones began to get some strength and strength just began to float through his body they held him up say the man went from walking to leaping everybody knew that's something that happened to this fella it's the same man that was that was at the gate begging so that's the same but peter and john such as i have i give them to the they had it to give where did they get it from they got it from god they took the place here they stepped into the same place jesus had and they took care of this condition church there's some things we got to take care of as believers on this earth the only hands jesus got are your hands the only feet jesus got are your feet we got to get busy working for the lord amen if you say to the mountain be thou removed be thou cast in the sea don't doubt in your heart you can have what you say all right matthew 10 before we hit matthew 17 again matthew 10 tells us something verse 1 and when he had called unto him his 12 disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness in all manner of disease now jesus had given the disciples power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal our man of sickness and all man of disease now over in verse seven a man will will pick this up he says and and as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand this is what jesus tell them heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils freely you have received freely give now here the lord jesus gives them the power to do it however we pick up in in matthew 17 that they have this commission to go and heal the sick and cleanse the lepers and raise the dead and do all these great things but in matthew 17 they run into a man that has a son that has an epileptic problem amen it was epilepsy that he was dealing with amen this man has a problem with epilepsy and and this man brings his son to the disciples and and brother branham say just based on how the disciples accidentally acting they would say let me show you how to do it john no james let me show you how to do it peter no let me show you how to do it and it is a competition amen in the way that they trying to approach this hallelujah glory to god amen they're competing amen with one another as they're trying to bring healing to this this young man now they knew they had the power because jesus gave them the power but when when a man bring his son and he realized i can just imagine man y'all can't get the job done where is your master they say just take me to jesus when they got to jesus say look adam brought them to your disciples they couldn't do anything with them hallelujah he said but i was just wondering if you could do something jesus said bring him here brother branham say that boy had the worst fit he ever had that day hallelujah i'm going to tell you something the devil gave me to do some of the worst things he ever done but when he do that just know god came to do something greater hallelujah hallelujah god getting ready to do something great here here here here here here jesus said bringing me jesus prayed and and his prayer this man this young boy was loose from this lunatic spirit no longer falling in fires and in water and and he was healed right in that very same hour the boy was healed that devil had been cast out but the disciples asked the question now let's pick this up amen in verse 19. uh matthew 17 verse 19 the disciples asked the question after they realized they had failed after they realized they had failed the disciples asked the question then came the disciples of jesus apart and said why could not we cast him out and i love this jesus said in them because of your unbelief now jesus did not say because of your lack of power you understand jesus knew i gave you power and even brother adam said he said he say the cyberman acts now did you take the power back no when he gave the power he never took it back so so why couldn't they use that power oh my i'm gonna tell you the problem the prophet say they had the power the problem was they didn't have the faith to use the power can i tell y'all something church we got the power we got the power we used to sing that song all the time we got the power in the name of jesus we got the power now we need to exercise our faith in the power let's just read it jesus said to them because of your unbelief for every for verily i say unto you if you have faith as a grain of a mustard seed you should send to this mountain remove hints to young place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you i want to say that again i said nothing shall be impossible unto you that is what god said back to you because you always say god i know nothing impossible for you god no no god say to you this morning no no no no nothing shall be impossible unto you you got the power you just need faith to use the power let me read this from a greater than solomon is here god give us give us faith to use this build us up in this faith lord i got just a couple things that i want to read and we'll we'll close it here in greater greater than solomon is here since we found these 12 apostles about 10 days after god gave them power to heal the sick and to cast out devils to raise the dead oh if we would only look we find those men totally totally defeated on an epileptic case jesus came down from the mountain finds them out there with a boy with epilepsy and they could not cast the spirit out oh they maybe were shouting and praising the lord and kicking anointing with oil or whatever more but they could not cast them out and when jesus came to the scene the father child run up to jesus said lord i brought my boy to your disciples and they could not cure him and if thou can help us if thou can help us then when this boy was brought into the presence of the lord jesus he had the hardest fit he probably ever had and stretched out like he was dead and so much that many said he was dead but jesus said take him up it's gone from him and the boy was healed now watch you know and um let me just uh just read this now watch then the disciples came to jesus alone problem said why could we not cast them out ten days ago you gave us power have you taken it back again jesus never told them he had taken his power back neither did he tell them that they didn't have the power to do it he said it was because of your unbelief not lack of power lack of faith to use what power you got it's a lack of faith to use what power you got i'm gonna just put it this way you got power over coronavirus but what we got is a lack of faith to use the power that we got you got power over cancer but we got a lack of faith to use what we got you got power over diabetes you got power over high blood pressure you got power over any devil that's attacking your body just a lack of faith to use what you got and that's what's the matter tonight with the church and the people it's not a lack of power while you're born again children of god uh children of god has the power to move mountains you've got the power but you lack faith to operate what power god has given you i'll tell you what you know as i i process things like that i say lord help me i mean i was talking to somebody a little while ago and we were talking about and one fellow he was just telling me so you know he says people going to church say i'm just be honest you know when my church get ready to go back i'm not going say i'm not going say okay all right no problem all right no problem and uh so you know he just kept talking and i said you know i'm gonna just be honest i i had to process some things as i was going through all the news and everything i was hearing i had to ask myself a question when have i actually stopped operating in faith and started operating in fear that just my own question this is a i did my own self-evaluation when when when have i actually moved from from from faith to fear and i actually had no answer i had no answer for myself because i start as i start thinking about it it's a very fine line when we when we don't move from faith to fear and sometimes the line is so fine we don't know when we don't cross it hallelujah because we're governed by everything we hear around us rather than being governed by the word of god and what i say i want to be governed by what god's word says that's when i know i'm walking by faith even if i go down let me go down on the word praise the lord church right i said i said i don't wanna i don't wanna lord i know you have not given me the spirit of fear so i'm not gonna walk that way that's that's the devil if i'm walking in fear i know the devil has sent that god you've given me faith amen church i'm gonna tell you i gotta i i don't i i won't have time to read it you say if we don't have faith to heal these bodies how are we gonna have faith for rapture how are we gonna have faith for a rapture if you don't have faith but healing you can't have faith for a rapture this is serious business and we're closer to a rapture than we ever were this if we're not gonna put our faith on the line now i don't know when we're gonna do it amen at least i know y'all i know you i know you i got faith i got confidence in you that you ain't gonna come in here and get me sick praise the lord i got faith in you i got i got that kind of faith in you amen amen church we go we got we got to we we god is trying to build us up in a faith for this hour and this faith is a greater faith than any other day it's a greater faith i'm glad y'all walking in it i'm glad y'all walking let me read something here um this is coming from the sermon oneness amen actually uh hold on one second yes this comes from the message oneness this is a prayer that the prophet prayed and uh i want to i'm praying this over the church and now uh i'm gonna read this amen and and and and and i want you to certainly listen to it but i really want you to hear from uh with with your spirit not just not just through your intellect i want you to hear this with your spirit man as i read this it says our heavenly father laying here is a bunch of handkerchiefs gloves they may go out in the mail i don't know who laid them here maybe billy maybe the people here in the audience i just feel to do this now lord there's nothing in my hands nothing in me as a human being i couldn't rely on my own human understanding i don't understand why this is so but i'm following what you said they took from the body of paul handkerchiefs and aprons and evil spirits went out of the people it wasn't because he was a great man it was because that god was with him in word and power and he never consulted the apostles but found out when they met together that the same gospel the same form of baptism the same everything but they were doing was eye to eye the same now i'm asking lord for these precious people that's believing you that you will heal them them in the audience heal them lord may their faith just reach up and get a
