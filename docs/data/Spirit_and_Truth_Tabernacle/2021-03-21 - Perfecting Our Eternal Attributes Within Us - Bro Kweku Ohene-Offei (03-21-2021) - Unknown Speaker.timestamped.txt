[16:21] god bless you
[16:25] this morning i walked into church and i
[16:27] just was overwhelmed with
[16:29] um just this feeling of nausea so i
[16:32] claim my healing
[16:36] um if you know this song just sing with
[16:38] me okay
[16:41] so many times i've questioned
[16:45] certain circumstances
[16:49] and things i could not understand
[16:57] and many times in trials
[17:01] weakness blurs my vision
[17:04] and my frustration gets so
[17:07] out of hand
[17:09] [Music]
[17:12] it's then i am reminded
[17:16] i've never been forsaken
[17:19] i've never had to stand the test alone
[17:24] [Music]
[17:26] and when i look at all the victories
[17:30] the spirit rises up in me
[17:33] and it's through the fire my weakness is
[17:36] made strong
[17:38] [Music]
[17:41] he never promised that the cross would
[17:45] not get
[17:46] heavy that the hill would not be
[17:49] hard to climb
[17:53] [Music]
[17:55] and he never offered
[17:59] victory without fighting but he
[18:02] said help would always come
[18:05] in time
[18:07] [Music]
[18:09] so just remember when you're standing in
[18:14] the valley of decision
[18:17] and the adversary says given
[18:23] just hold on
[18:28] our lord will show up
[18:32] and he will take you through the fire
[18:38] [Music]
[18:40] again
[18:48] i know within myself that i
[18:52] would surely perish but if
[18:56] i trust the hand of god he will shield
[18:59] the flames again
[19:02] [Music]
[19:05] he never promised that the cross would
[19:09] not get
[19:10] heavy that the hill would not be
[19:14] hard to climb
[19:17] [Music]
[19:19] and he never offered
[19:23] victory without fighting but he
[19:26] said help would always come in time
[19:31] [Music]
[19:33] so just remember when you're standing
[19:37] in the valley of decision
[19:41] and the adversary says given
[19:47] just hold on
[19:51] our lord will show up
[19:54] [Music]
[19:55] and he will take you through the
[19:58] fire again
[20:03] just hold on
[20:08] our lord will show up
[20:11] and he will take you through the
[20:15] fire again

[21:52] the midst of you this morning
[21:57] before i go into the song i want to uh
[22:00] just share something with the church
[22:07] i received a very evil report this week
[22:09] from my doctor
[22:14] and it really stunned me
[22:19] and i sat there just trying to process
[22:21] the things that he was telling me
[22:26] and i thank god for being in the room
[22:29] i really do
[22:33] doctor you know he was telling me what
[22:35] he what i needed to know
[22:37] and he says you know i hate telling you
[22:39] these things but
[22:41] i'm a doctor and i have to i have to
[22:44] i have to let you know what's going on
[22:46] [Music]
[22:50] he uh he reached over and he grabbed
[22:53] my hand and he says
[22:58] he says are you a woman of god i said
[23:01] yes i am yes i am
[23:03] he said i knew that from the first time
[23:05] i saw you i knew that you were
[23:08] and i know you know who the healer is
[23:13] i said yes he's touched my body many
[23:16] times many times
[23:18] he says well i'm a man of god and i know
[23:20] him too
[23:25] he began to share testimonies of
[23:28] healings within his family
[23:30] of some really some dark situations
[23:34] that uh he witnessed the healing
[23:39] one was his dad his dad is a pastor
[23:42] and he said the doctor had given
[23:46] given his dad a month to live and he
[23:48] says here he is 15 years later
[23:50] he's still ministering the word of god
[23:57] and he's he was in no hurry to get me
[24:00] out of the office
[24:02] he just went through testimony after
[24:04] testimony and just
[24:05] he says you're going to be fine you're
[24:07] going to be fine
[24:09] he said i know you know the lord i guess
[24:11] i do yes i do
[24:14] then he started praying for me
[24:25] it wasn't no simple little prayer
[24:28] truly was the son of god that was
[24:29] praying for me
[24:33] and i sat there the tears just swelling
[24:35] up and spilling out
[24:36] because i was overwhelmed by
[24:40] his compassion more so than the
[24:44] what the diagnosis was just seeing a
[24:47] doctor
[24:47] so out of his professional role
[24:50] you know on my behalf
[24:53] [Music]
[24:56] and we talked on the look for him
[24:58] constantly encouraging me
[25:00] he says i'm gonna i'm gonna keep praying
[25:02] for you
[25:03] i'm gonna be following you i'm gonna be
[25:07] you're gonna be in my heart
[25:11] i say i know i know that
[25:15] and as i get i got up to leave he stood
[25:18] up
[25:19] and he walked around in front of me and
[25:20] he says i know this
[25:22] is totally out of protocol
[25:25] but can i hug you it was
[25:28] you know it was like he was ministering
[25:30] to his mother
[25:32] it was and it just moved me
[25:35] right on past what i was going through
[25:40] i told him i never forget it i'll never
[25:42] forget him
[25:43] and i never will and as i left that
[25:47] building i just cried all the way to my
[25:50] car and i got to my car and all
[25:53] i could do was worship the lord
[25:56] so all i could do was worship and sit
[25:59] there and worship the lord
[26:02] [Music]
[26:03] [Applause]
[26:08] because he showed me he showed me from
[26:11] the start that he's with me
[26:14] that was i told i said you
[26:18] are son of god just wearing the white
[26:20] coat
[26:23] but you're positioned right here where
[26:25] you are where you need to be most
[26:28] i'll never forget it i never will and
[26:30] this is the thing that
[26:32] when the enemy comes i go back to that
[26:35] moment that jesus christ
[26:37] appeared to bring a balance
[26:40] to my emotions i thank him so much
[26:45] i know he has me
[26:48] i know he has me i expect my healing
[26:54] i don't know how god is going to do it
[26:58] i love for him to touch my body and
[27:01] everything be gone
[27:03] that's my preference
[27:06] but if he chooses it another way
[27:09] i'm willing to go that way because i
[27:12] know
[27:12] he has me i know he does
[27:17] he has me
[27:21] [Music]

[57:20] substances
[57:22] and whatever we have we give it to the
[57:23] lord jesus christ
[57:25] amen because the purpose we are here
[57:28] is not a lot of visions and a lot of
[57:30] dreams that we have
[57:31] but the grand vision is his world the
[57:34] purpose he has called you to be
[57:36] what is called you to do that is the
[57:38] duty of man amen
[57:40] the bible said the whole duty of man is
[57:42] to save god
[57:43] and obey his commandment so whatever
[57:46] little
[57:47] dreams you have if that dream supersede
[57:49] the word of the lord
[57:50] then you have to trash it amen whatever
[57:54] vision you have if it doesn't doctor
[57:55] with the word of the lord then it's not
[57:57] from the lord throw it away
[57:59] but if you find what the lord has
[58:00] allotted you to do
[58:02] position you here on this earth to do
[58:05] then you carried out with all your might
[58:07] with all your strength
[58:08] amen so this one you want to just speak
[58:10] on a little subject
[58:12] entitled perfecting our eternal
[58:15] attributes within us
[58:17] perfecting our eternal attributes within
[58:20] us
[58:21] before we came here on earth the lord
[58:23] put it put certain attribute in us
[58:25] before adam before your
[58:27] great-great-great-grandparents
[58:28] over the generation the lord ordained
[58:30] you for this work
[58:32] and he put certain things in you to
[58:34] manifest and those attributes are
[58:36] eternal
[58:37] you can't take them away from you it's
[58:40] part of your nature
[58:41] and that is what we are trying to find
[58:44] out what the lord has ordained me
[58:45] quickly to do
[58:46] ordain you to do and when you find your
[58:48] purpose as brother solomon
[58:50] is found his purpose singing unto us
[58:52] leading their songs
[58:53] bringing a blessings unto us our sisters
[58:56] here
[58:56] and everyone has found their purpose but
[58:58] if you haven't found your purpose in
[59:00] life
[59:01] if your purpose is to think you are you
[59:03] are here to make a
[59:04] dead president you know that dead
[59:06] president right american
[59:08] american dollar it's got the image of
[59:10] that president
[59:11] if that is your vision that that is all
[59:13] you have you are here to do
[59:15] then you've missed the vision entirely
[59:17] you've missed the whole ballgame
[59:19] your vision is not for dead president
[59:22] and for mansions they are good the
[59:23] additions they are places and their
[59:24] bonuses the lord give it to you and i
[59:26] but that is not why we are here on this
[59:28] earth
[59:30] if the dead president leak out of your
[59:32] pocket you still said the lord jesus
[59:33] christ
[59:34] if your mansion is taken out from you
[59:35] you celeste a son of or a dead of god
[59:39] if you don't have electricity you are
[59:40] still the daughter of jesus christ
[59:42] if you are if you don't have food to eat
[59:44] you are still the lord of jesus christ
[59:46] just like a human being nothing changes
[59:48] you if you go under the ocean to swim
[59:50] you still a human you are not a fish you
[59:53] can swim with a fish but you're not a
[59:54] fish
[59:55] if you go to the woods and run with the
[59:57] wild animals the deer
[59:59] and whatever you don't become part of
[1:00:01] the animals you're still a human being
[1:00:03] so it doesn't matter where you find
[1:00:05] yourself you sell a son and a daughter
[1:00:06] of jesus christ
[1:00:08] amen and so you want to find out the
[1:00:10] attributes so we want to read certain
[1:00:11] scriptures
[1:00:13] we can take our scriptures if you don't
[1:00:14] mind let's stand up and
[1:00:18] look at certain scriptures before let's
[1:00:20] look at
[1:00:23] ephesians chapter one verse one to four
[1:00:27] ephesians 1 1-4
[1:00:31] we want to see paul when he found his
[1:00:33] purpose on earth
[1:00:35] before he became poor we know his life
[1:00:36] he was so he had a lot of knowledge here
[1:00:40] and he was very religious person he
[1:00:42] studied under
[1:00:43] pharisees under gamaliel one of the
[1:00:45] greatest tribes in in in his time
[1:00:48] but he realized that i was in his
[1:00:49] purpose he ended up even killing people
[1:00:51] persecuting people because he thought
[1:00:53] those people were not doing what he
[1:00:55] thinks they were supposed to do
[1:00:57] but then he found his purpose when he
[1:00:58] made a pill of fire
[1:01:00] personally for himself not what gamaliel
[1:01:03] taught him
[1:01:04] not was what somebody taught him but
[1:01:06] what
[1:01:07] the lord jesus christ revealed to him
[1:01:09] personally
[1:01:10] and so there's other scriptures that are
[1:01:12] god's eternal attributes
[1:01:14] certain scriptures pertain to before
[1:01:17] your time on this earth
[1:01:18] and certain scriptures pertain to your
[1:01:20] life on this earth
[1:01:22] so ephesians chapter 1 verse 4 is one of
[1:01:24] the scriptures
[1:01:25] that pertains to your life before you
[1:01:27] drop from your mother's womb
[1:01:29] so let's read one to four ephesians
[1:01:31] chapter one chapter one verse one to
[1:01:33] four
[1:01:33] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[1:01:35] will of god
[1:01:37] to the sins which are at ephesus and to
[1:01:39] the faithful in christ jesus
[1:01:41] grace be unto you and peace from the god
[1:01:44] our father
[1:01:45] and from the lord jesus christ blessed
[1:01:48] be the god and the father of our lord
[1:01:49] jesus christ
[1:01:51] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:01:53] blessings
[1:01:54] in heavenly places in christ verse 4
[1:01:57] according to us he has chosen us
[1:01:59] in him before the foundation of the
[1:02:01] world that we should be holy and without
[1:02:04] blame before him
[1:02:05] in love 5 5 also pertains to
[1:02:08] eternity having predicted us unto the
[1:02:11] adoption of children
[1:02:13] by jesus christ to himself according to
[1:02:15] the good
[1:02:16] pleasure of his will may the lord add
[1:02:18] blessing to the origin of his word shall
[1:02:20] we be seated
[1:02:22] now we realize that paul was talking
[1:02:24] about the scripture ephesians one for us
[1:02:26] he said according us is choosing us
[1:02:28] in him before the foundation of the
[1:02:30] world so he wasn't
[1:02:32] here when the lord chose him the truth
[1:02:34] was the lord
[1:02:35] not what he chose to do he chose to be
[1:02:37] under his parent took him to a
[1:02:39] gamaliel to go and study that was the
[1:02:41] end of the day they didn't have the
[1:02:43] school we have here
[1:02:44] they have they find a tutor and they
[1:02:46] place you under the tutor to steady
[1:02:48] and those time they had all their trade
[1:02:50] paul was a lawyer
[1:02:51] he was as a scribe he was a theologian
[1:02:54] he had all the dog treats you can think
[1:02:55] about he was a professor
[1:02:57] but he missed one-on-one experience with
[1:03:00] the lord jesus christ
[1:03:02] he believed in jehovah he believed the
[1:03:04] law of moses to the core
[1:03:06] he fought for it he lived it he breathed
[1:03:08] it he read it
[1:03:10] all the time in those time they didn't
[1:03:11] have to some of them didn't have to work
[1:03:13] the former way we work
[1:03:15] 8 hours putting in 8 hours and 12 hours
[1:03:17] a day no their work was doing farming
[1:03:19] and
[1:03:19] and gardening and what have you they
[1:03:22] didn't have what you they don't have a
[1:03:23] time table where you clock in and clock
[1:03:25] out no
[1:03:26] so they had more time for themselves so
[1:03:28] they spent time reading the scroll the
[1:03:30] scriptures of moses
[1:03:32] but yes so he missed the eternal portion
[1:03:36] the eternal part because he was here on
[1:03:38] earth having a one-on-one experience
[1:03:40] with the lord jesus christ
[1:03:42] but then there was a time when he had
[1:03:43] one-on-one experience when the pillow
[1:03:45] fired himself that he was fighting
[1:03:47] met him and said so so why do you
[1:03:51] persecute me
[1:03:52] he said who are there lord because he
[1:03:54] knew that was jehovah
[1:03:55] but he didn't know him as jesus christ
[1:03:58] so the lord said i am jesus
[1:04:00] whom you are persecuting how could this
[1:04:02] persecute jesus christ when jesus christ
[1:04:04] was dead
[1:04:05] and living in heaven heaven was in the
[1:04:08] heart of the believers
[1:04:09] so jesus christ was the believers at
[1:04:11] that time
[1:04:13] amen the believers were jesus christ at
[1:04:15] that time
[1:04:16] and if jesus christ is in you you are
[1:04:18] the jesus christ of this day
[1:04:19] amen god bless you
[1:04:22] so let's go let's get back to the topic
[1:04:25] perfecting our antenna attributes
[1:04:27] let's read another scripture from
[1:04:29] hebrews 11 1-8
[1:04:31] the book of hebrews chapter 11 and we
[1:04:33] want to build a foundation where the
[1:04:35] lord
[1:04:35] started a foundation of unconditional
[1:04:37] covenant
[1:04:39] hebrews chapter 11 verse 1 to 8 we'll be
[1:04:42] jumping some of the scriptures
[1:04:45] now faith is the substance of things
[1:04:47] hoped for
[1:04:48] the evidence of things not seen for by
[1:04:50] it the elders obtain a good report
[1:04:53] through feet we understand that the
[1:04:54] walls were framed by the word of
[1:04:56] god so that things which are seen were
[1:04:59] not made
[1:05:00] of things which do appear by faith able
[1:05:03] offered
[1:05:04] unto god a more excellent sacrifice than
[1:05:06] king
[1:05:07] by which he obtained witness that he was
[1:05:09] righteous god testifying of his gift
[1:05:12] and by its being dead and by it he been
[1:05:15] dead
[1:05:15] yet speaketh by faith enoch was
[1:05:18] translated that he should not see death
[1:05:20] and was not found because god translated
[1:05:23] him for before his translation he had a
[1:05:25] testimony that he pleased god
[1:05:27] five but without faith it is it is
[1:05:30] impossible to please him
[1:05:31] for he that committed to god must
[1:05:33] believe that he is
[1:05:35] and that is the reward of them that
[1:05:36] diligently
[1:05:38] seek after him amen so we will leave it
[1:05:40] there and the rest you can read when you
[1:05:42] get back home
[1:05:43] for the sake of time and i want us to
[1:05:45] read another scripture from hebrews
[1:05:47] 12 hebrews chapter 12
[1:05:51] verse one and two just two scriptures
[1:05:57] wherefore seeing we also are compass
[1:05:59] about with great
[1:06:00] cloud of witness and i want you to
[1:06:02] underline cloud of witness
[1:06:04] let us lay aside every week and the
[1:06:06] sandwich that so easily beset
[1:06:08] us and let us run with patient the risk
[1:06:11] that is set before us
[1:06:13] two looking unto jesus the author and
[1:06:15] finisher of our faith
[1:06:17] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:06:19] endure the cross
[1:06:20] despising the despising the shame and is
[1:06:22] set down at the right hand of the throne
[1:06:25] of god
[1:06:25] so what is a cloud of weakness how can a
[1:06:28] cloud
[1:06:29] we know the clouds in the sky how can
[1:06:31] they be a witness
[1:06:32] the class is a symbol of supernatural
[1:06:34] clouds
[1:06:35] so the cloud where paul was right now
[1:06:38] about is not a cloud in the sky
[1:06:40] but a cloud of witness is the
[1:06:41] theophanies your celestial body
[1:06:44] amen you and i that we are witnesses
[1:06:47] upon the earth
[1:06:48] you are a cloud of witness we are not a
[1:06:50] physical cloud
[1:06:51] floating in the atmosphere maybe you can
[1:06:53] see class when you look at the imagery
[1:06:55] no this cloud is a type of you and i
[1:06:58] amen this cloud is a type of the
[1:07:02] celestial being in you so paul is
[1:07:03] talking about
[1:07:04] singing knowing that we are compass we
[1:07:07] are surrounded
[1:07:08] by a cloud of witness by few funnies by
[1:07:11] celestia being the lord himself is here
[1:07:13] he's not in the sky somewhere no he
[1:07:15] doesn't live on jupiter
[1:07:17] the lord created all the celestial
[1:07:18] bodies but he chose the earth
[1:07:20] the third planet to be the place of his
[1:07:23] abode
[1:07:24] and that's why your flesh and my flesh
[1:07:26] is templing the lord jesus christ
[1:07:29] amen he didn't put human beings on pluto
[1:07:32] on mars on jupiter but he placed human
[1:07:35] beings on this little tiny earth here
[1:07:38] and he placed himself not on the whole
[1:07:40] earth
[1:07:41] his glory is seen on the whole earth but
[1:07:43] then his glory is seen more in you
[1:07:45] amen because you are the temple of the
[1:07:48] living god
[1:07:49] blessed be the name of the lord so let's
[1:07:51] go back to the attribute let's
[1:07:52] take our father abraham if he can give
[1:07:54] us the um
[1:07:56] the powerpoint that'll be great
[1:07:59] our father abraham thank you god bless
[1:08:02] you the lord
[1:08:03] we know the law started with a covenant
[1:08:05] called conditional covenant with our
[1:08:06] father adam
[1:08:07] that do this and i'll do this when i do
[1:08:10] this you do this
[1:08:11] so it's you do it you do something the
[1:08:14] lord does something
[1:08:15] and one of them was don't tie the tree
[1:08:17] in the midst of the garden
[1:08:18] and we know what happened the man film
[1:08:21] because man is not able to keep covenant
[1:08:23] and the lord kept on bringing laws and
[1:08:25] conditional covenant
[1:08:27] to the point that the lord decided that
[1:08:28] okay man has experienced
[1:08:30] enough of the law man cannot live by law
[1:08:32] so i'm going to flip it i'm going to
[1:08:33] give an
[1:08:34] unconditional covenant which is by grace
[1:08:36] what i have done regardless of what you
[1:08:38] do
[1:08:39] which is called love love doesn't base
[1:08:42] on
[1:08:42] do and i do you do and i do is
[1:08:45] law it's obligation but then when it
[1:08:48] comes to
[1:08:49] the love of christ you don't have
[1:08:51] anything to do with it
[1:08:52] you just accept it amen so the lord
[1:08:55] began to construct a house just like
[1:08:57] masons and con contractors and
[1:09:00] architects control the house bethlehem
[1:09:03] house is based on the four corners
[1:09:05] we use the square or rectangle so one
[1:09:07] corner here
[1:09:08] one there one here one here so the lord
[1:09:10] is also an architect the greatest
[1:09:12] architect thereof is the lord jesus
[1:09:14] christ himself so he wanted
[1:09:16] what we do here is just a pattern of
[1:09:18] what the lord
[1:09:19] does dimensionally we look at a pattern
[1:09:22] and bring an image of what the lord is
[1:09:24] trying to achieve in the celestial world
[1:09:27] so the first concrete or the first
[1:09:29] pillar he put on the earth
[1:09:31] when he started the unconditional
[1:09:33] covenant is a man called abram
[1:09:35] who later became abraham now abraham in
[1:09:39] him
[1:09:39] when the lord called him he wasn't a
[1:09:40] righteous man he was an idol worshiper
[1:09:43] just like his people that's what they
[1:09:45] knew they had idols
[1:09:47] just like people worship idols at this
[1:09:49] time we watched them in different
[1:09:50] manners people worship
[1:09:52] if you go to india they don't eat some
[1:09:54] not all part of india but some people
[1:09:56] don't eat
[1:09:57] um cow they don't eat meat
[1:10:00] because the cow is is an idol it's if
[1:10:03] you kill a cow it's like you kill a
[1:10:04] human being
[1:10:05] you'll be in trouble so certain part you
[1:10:07] can't eat a
[1:10:08] cow you can't eat certain animals that
[1:10:10] we eat here
[1:10:11] because it's idols that they worship
[1:10:14] some worship rivers
[1:10:15] and if you go to let's say certain
[1:10:16] countries and country most people don't
[1:10:18] worship idols in that form
[1:10:20] but yes we have greater idols like as a
[1:10:22] dead president
[1:10:24] people can kill somebody for the sake of
[1:10:26] that president
[1:10:27] i was watching a another news at youtube
[1:10:31] and a man burnt a house i think his
[1:10:34] mother-in-law's house and his wife no
[1:10:36] his mother
[1:10:37] lost vehicle and the house his wife or
[1:10:39] girlfriend was living in it
[1:10:41] because he didn't get his bonus 1400
[1:10:44] 1400
[1:10:46] 1400 right yeah a thousand four hundred
[1:10:48] four hundred dollars
[1:10:50] he said his mother's mother's
[1:10:52] mother-in-law how
[1:10:53] um vehicle ableist and he said his wife
[1:10:56] house ablaze
[1:10:57] because of fourteen hundred dollars
[1:10:59] because what
[1:11:00] dead president i does to him they are so
[1:11:04] dear to him that you touch
[1:11:05] his dead president you touch his
[1:11:10] bloodline
[1:11:13] and that was a price the mother-in-law
[1:11:15] and the wife paid for it
[1:11:17] for touching his 1400.
[1:11:24] so that is an idol so back to abraham
[1:11:27] he was another worshiper just like
[1:11:29] anybody that was born without christ
[1:11:31] but then the lord in him before the
[1:11:33] foundation award he was an embodiment of
[1:11:36] faith
[1:11:36] the lord called him to be a faithful
[1:11:38] servant of course abraham had mistakes
[1:11:41] you can go through the bible old
[1:11:42] testament read about abraham's life
[1:11:44] genesis
[1:11:45] he had a lot of bunch of problems a lot
[1:11:47] of flaws in his life
[1:11:48] but yesterday before the lord he was
[1:11:51] perfect
[1:11:53] because the covenant is not conditioner
[1:11:55] amen
[1:11:56] so to the extent that the lord called
[1:11:58] him father of faith
[1:12:00] that title was given to him when abraham
[1:12:02] didn't know that he was going to have a
[1:12:03] son or not
[1:12:05] how can a father of who doesn't have a
[1:12:07] child
[1:12:08] but the lord wanted you to use faith as
[1:12:10] we read that faith is the substance of
[1:12:12] sin
[1:12:12] of things not seen with the physical
[1:12:14] eyes but it's in the celestial eyes it's
[1:12:16] in your heart
[1:12:17] it's in the celestial world it's it's
[1:12:20] right here
[1:12:21] though you might not see it with your
[1:12:22] physical eyes it's just right here
[1:12:24] it's in the sixth dimension or the sixth
[1:12:26] realm where you might not see with this
[1:12:28] eyes
[1:12:29] but then the six frames is in you it's
[1:12:32] in your brothers and your sisters
[1:12:34] and you don't look at your brother or
[1:12:35] your sister the way he is you look at
[1:12:37] him the way the lord
[1:12:38] looks at him amen it doesn't matter so
[1:12:41] ibrahim was started
[1:12:42] the lord started with abraham as a
[1:12:44] father of faith
[1:12:46] and abraham had mistakes but he was
[1:12:48] faithful to the lord would despite his
[1:12:50] mistakes
[1:12:51] when the lord calls me abraham move from
[1:12:53] your people and go to
[1:12:54] where i'm going to send you when he
[1:12:56] didn't even know where the lord was
[1:12:57] going to send him
[1:12:59] imagine telling your parents your family
[1:13:00] that the lord has called me
[1:13:02] and i'm going to take my wife and going
[1:13:03] to live in this country where did the
[1:13:05] lord tell you i don't know
[1:13:08] do you think you are probably getting
[1:13:09] crazy you don't know where you are going
[1:13:11] you're taking your family
[1:13:12] what's wrong with you you're prosperous
[1:13:14] you've got land people here
[1:13:15] you've got businesses why are you taking
[1:13:18] your wife and go to a country that you
[1:13:19] don't even know where you are going
[1:13:21] but that is faith and the lord accounted
[1:13:23] to abraham
[1:13:24] as a blessing for being sincere for
[1:13:27] being faithful to the lord
[1:13:29] he went through he had his six ups and
[1:13:31] downs
[1:13:32] i mean he went through thick and thin
[1:13:34] but abraham received a promise
[1:13:36] now out of abraham came isaac isaac was
[1:13:39] christ just like abraham
[1:13:41] in part revealing the love of elohim
[1:13:44] amen
[1:13:44] all these things if you look at my
[1:13:46] diagram the four corners
[1:13:48] elohim or jesus christ or eternity or
[1:13:50] the fountain of life
[1:13:51] was the one that was powering all these
[1:13:54] attributes
[1:13:55] it's just like the mason if there's a
[1:13:57] house sometimes when you go and inspire
[1:13:58] the house you don't see the contractor
[1:14:00] but the contractor was the one or the
[1:14:02] masons were the one who put the pillars
[1:14:05] and the concrete and everything the
[1:14:07] foundation there you might not see them
[1:14:08] around you see the beautiful
[1:14:10] mall that was just erected in your area
[1:14:12] oh this small is so beautiful wow that's
[1:14:14] awesome you don't know who put it there
[1:14:16] but there was somebody who put those
[1:14:17] more there
[1:14:18] the lord jesus christ was the one who
[1:14:19] was bringing the attribute out of
[1:14:21] abraham
[1:14:22] so isaac was the beloved son as you know
[1:14:24] his story he was an
[1:14:26] embodiment of the love of christ so the
[1:14:28] lord made sure that the parents went
[1:14:30] through
[1:14:31] some challenges before isaac came about
[1:14:34] remember the lord gave the promise to
[1:14:35] abraham that you're going to have a son
[1:14:36] when he was abram
[1:14:38] and his wife sarah but then it took how
[1:14:40] many
[1:14:41] how long 25 years they went through
[1:14:43] difficult times
[1:14:44] for them to appreciate for them to see
[1:14:46] that it's the love of god
[1:14:48] amen what you have sometimes you don't
[1:14:50] appreciate it but when you lose it
[1:14:52] that's when you appreciate that oh wow
[1:14:54] this was dear to me
[1:14:56] i wish i would have handled if he's a
[1:14:58] person i should i would have handled a
[1:15:00] person differently
[1:15:01] i would have shown him or him or love
[1:15:03] amen
[1:15:04] so now that you see your brother you see
[1:15:06] your son your wife your children your
[1:15:08] husband
[1:15:08] give them the best as you give it unto
[1:15:10] the lord because maybe tomorrow they may
[1:15:12] not be around
[1:15:13] and you can't do nothing much it's
[1:15:15] already gone amen
[1:15:17] god bless you now so isaac was the
[1:15:20] second
[1:15:21] foundation which is love the love of
[1:15:23] jesus christ isaac portrayed jesus
[1:15:25] christ it doesn't mean isaac didn't
[1:15:26] express
[1:15:27] faith perfection and grace but the main
[1:15:30] attribute
[1:15:31] that the lord was trying to achieve with
[1:15:33] isaac's love
[1:15:34] life was the love of christ as he did
[1:15:37] faith
[1:15:37] with abraham so now isaac came
[1:15:40] israel or jacob jacob means
[1:15:44] a supplanter a deceiver and we know his
[1:15:46] life
[1:15:47] he was interested in the dead president
[1:15:50] he was deep in his brother for it
[1:15:52] his father-in-law and he would just do
[1:15:54] whatever to i mean
[1:15:56] he would he could do to get his dead
[1:15:57] president is that president was the gold
[1:15:59] and the
[1:16:00] sheep and the lamp and dustin those were
[1:16:02] there present at that time
[1:16:03] they didn't have the paper dollars we
[1:16:05] have then so jacob was really he was a
[1:16:07] jew
[1:16:08] and if you have really encountered a
[1:16:09] jewish person who are interested in
[1:16:11] dinero money he was a typical jew
[1:16:16] so he didn't play with dead president
[1:16:18] you know so and he had a lot of them
[1:16:20] but he realized that there was something
[1:16:21] missing in his life there was a missing
[1:16:23] link
[1:16:24] and this president and gold and diamond
[1:16:28] and wives he had a bunch of wives
[1:16:30] children
[1:16:31] they couldn't fulfill it there was
[1:16:32] something missing and he saw his life
[1:16:35] like no this is not who i want to be
[1:16:37] the great voice the great pillow fire
[1:16:39] was speaking to me son where are thou
[1:16:41] the lord was the one who gave him all
[1:16:42] the blessing but there was a missing
[1:16:44] link in his heart
[1:16:46] that was eternity and it came to himself
[1:16:49] that norm
[1:16:50] i need to do something so one time he
[1:16:51] met an angel angel of the world came to
[1:16:53] visit him
[1:16:55] and he said i know i'm wretched i'm not
[1:16:57] this is not
[1:16:58] who i want to be that eternal voice
[1:17:01] ephesians 1 the voice that chosen before
[1:17:04] the foundation the word was
[1:17:05] was talking to him he said lord he said
[1:17:07] if you don't change me
[1:17:08] change my nature i'm not going to let
[1:17:10] you go and then just say no i cannot be
[1:17:12] seen by people
[1:17:14] it's getting light it's coming out sun
[1:17:15] is rising leave me said no
[1:17:17] if you don't change me i don't want to
[1:17:18] be jacob no more i want to be changed
[1:17:21] i don't know who i want to be but i
[1:17:22] don't want to go on this way i want
[1:17:24] i want i don't want to be a deceiver i'm
[1:17:26] not satisfied with all the
[1:17:28] the lamps and the goats and lands and
[1:17:31] all this property that is not
[1:17:33] that doesn't satisfy my soul and then he
[1:17:35] wrestled an angel
[1:17:37] and then you said what is your name he
[1:17:38] said my name is jacob i'm a deceiver
[1:17:40] and said your name is going to be israel
[1:17:42] a prince
[1:17:43] who has obtained favor with the lord
[1:17:45] amen and he went limping
[1:17:47] but he had the holy ghost in him amen
[1:17:50] glory hallelujah to the lord
[1:17:52] in the old testament they had the holy
[1:17:54] ghost but not in the form that we had it
[1:17:56] because the lamp has not been sacrificed
[1:17:59] they had christ in them
[1:18:00] but not in the the way we call the new
[1:18:02] breath as in the new testament
[1:18:04] but nevertheless they had christ on the
[1:18:06] inside of them
[1:18:07] and that's why they were doing what they
[1:18:08] did the women and the ladies and the
[1:18:10] men in the old testament so now israel
[1:18:14] for full grace the grace of the lord
[1:18:16] turn his life around from being
[1:18:18] jacob the deceiver to being israel a
[1:18:20] prince who has got favor with the lord
[1:18:23] now let's come to the last corner of the
[1:18:25] building the last pillar
[1:18:27] joseph who was a type of perfection he
[1:18:30] epitome
[1:18:30] the perfection of jesus christ of elohim
[1:18:33] or jehovah
[1:18:34] now he was you know his trial he didn't
[1:18:36] become a perfect person in a day
[1:18:39] when he was born for going to be a
[1:18:41] perfect person
[1:18:42] the lord took his mother away before he
[1:18:43] even was conceived his mother was barren
[1:18:46] and the mother was even present the
[1:18:47] husband why is my sister-in-law getting
[1:18:49] children
[1:18:50] why are the seven getting children give
[1:18:51] me a child and jacob said i'm not in the
[1:18:54] place of the lord
[1:18:55] i cannot i can do as a husband but the
[1:18:57] lord has to give you the seed
[1:18:58] so the right time the lord gave him uh
[1:19:01] joseph
[1:19:02] and his brother benjamin and through i
[1:19:05] think when benjamin was being born
[1:19:06] his mother was taken away whatever
[1:19:08] happens in a believer's life
[1:19:11] in as a child of god the lord has an
[1:19:13] eternal purpose for it
[1:19:15] and if you don't see the eternal purpose
[1:19:16] you're going to dwindle into oblivion
[1:19:18] but when you find out that whatever
[1:19:20] happens to me elohim has a purpose
[1:19:23] i may not understand it now but in the
[1:19:25] course of time
[1:19:26] he's going to reveal it to me amen
[1:19:29] because the lord didn't want him to be a
[1:19:30] mummy's boy
[1:19:31] he wanted him to be a ragged person
[1:19:33] because he was going to raise him jesus
[1:19:35] christ was
[1:19:36] elohim was epitome trying to bring the
[1:19:38] attribute
[1:19:39] of perfection in his life which is the
[1:19:40] type of jesus christ so jacob went
[1:19:42] through his trials with his brothers and
[1:19:45] and potiphar's house he thought he's got
[1:19:47] a refuge no
[1:19:48] things didn't work he has to i mean be
[1:19:50] taken he was firstly accused
[1:19:52] and he went to jail somebody was going
[1:19:54] to be perfect he landed in jail
[1:19:56] to begin with a criminal record now you
[1:19:59] can probably get certain job you you
[1:20:00] went to jail nobody's going to hire you
[1:20:03] but then that was joseph that was god's
[1:20:05] perfection and man the lord chose to be
[1:20:07] a perfect person
[1:20:08] and so the lord ran him through myanmar
[1:20:11] through different trials and
[1:20:12] temptation and now he matched as a prime
[1:20:15] minister of
[1:20:16] egypt which was the superpower at that
[1:20:18] time amen
[1:20:19] so whatever the lord is doing in your
[1:20:21] life the lord has a purpose
[1:20:23] the lord took a parent of esther when
[1:20:26] she was just a little girl
[1:20:28] because the lord was going to bring a
[1:20:29] princess who was going to be a queen
[1:20:31] and he wanted to line her with her uncle
[1:20:34] or her cousin
[1:20:35] what's the name monica who was a prayer
[1:20:38] warrior
[1:20:38] to bring that eternal attribute out of
[1:20:41] esther
[1:20:41] she didn't know she was a queen she just
[1:20:43] knew that she was an immigrant
[1:20:45] the jewish in in in india that was the
[1:20:47] superpower
[1:20:48] at that time with his uncle they
[1:20:50] migrated but the lord
[1:20:52] had an attribute in him to be the
[1:20:54] present wife or the king or
[1:20:55] the wife of the queen at that time so
[1:20:58] whatever happens to you
[1:20:59] you might not understand the trials
[1:21:01] you're going through it might even be a
[1:21:03] sickness
[1:21:03] but the lord is trying to achieve
[1:21:05] something out of that glory hallelujah
[1:21:07] to the lord
[1:21:12] there's nothing out of cater with the
[1:21:14] lord he knows exactly what he's doing
[1:21:17] amen so the over keep he got his
[1:21:19] foundation and he begin to
[1:21:21] unveil himself through the prophet and
[1:21:22] women at that time
[1:21:24] until he came to a point that the
[1:21:25] masterpiece himself
[1:21:27] has to come down amen and want to read a
[1:21:30] little
[1:21:30] quote here before let's go to uh the
[1:21:33] message masterpiece
[1:21:35] which the prophet barbara preached our
[1:21:37] prophet preached in 1964
[1:21:39] july july 5th 1964.
[1:21:44] we want to go to paragraph 59 that was
[1:21:47] uh
[1:21:47] unconditional covenant five nine so he
[1:21:50] begin now
[1:21:51] he begin now taking men from man from
[1:21:54] his covenant of saying that
[1:21:55] if you will i will and he begin with a
[1:21:58] man called abraham
[1:21:59] and give him and give and give to
[1:22:01] abraham a covenant
[1:22:02] unconditionally every time he will start
[1:22:04] a masterpiece
[1:22:06] satan will get it because because the
[1:22:08] word
[1:22:11] because the word but when he started
[1:22:13] with abraham he said i have already done
[1:22:15] it
[1:22:15] now this is unconditional not what if
[1:22:18] you will i will but i've already done it
[1:22:21] now he the sculptor is determined to
[1:22:23] have this masterpiece
[1:22:25] then from abraham comes the patriarch
[1:22:27] and the patriarch
[1:22:28] really now now what's god's doing he's
[1:22:31] rebuilding this masterpiece
[1:22:33] that had fallen so in the patriarch the
[1:22:35] first
[1:22:36] we find was abraham amen let's go to so
[1:22:39] the lord already had a masterpiece with
[1:22:41] adam
[1:22:42] which fell and the lord is trying to
[1:22:43] reconstruct another masterpiece
[1:22:46] so paragraph 61.
[1:22:53] now watch every masterpiece is put on a
[1:22:55] foundation
[1:22:56] a sculptor angelo's monument of moses
[1:23:00] is on three or four foot piece of marble
[1:23:02] it's got a foundation so god in
[1:23:04] preparing this masterpiece
[1:23:06] he put it on the foundation of the
[1:23:07] patriarch and the patriarch foundation
[1:23:09] first was abraham then isaac then jacob
[1:23:13] then joseph the four corners and now
[1:23:15] abraham was foundation of faith
[1:23:17] let let's see it's hard for foundation
[1:23:19] the foundation of faith was abraham
[1:23:21] but the foundation of love was isaac the
[1:23:24] foundation of grace was jacob
[1:23:26] god's grace to jacob anyone knows that
[1:23:28] but in joseph was perfection
[1:23:30] there is where he could set a monument
[1:23:32] upon not
[1:23:33] on the first foundation the second
[1:23:36] foundation
[1:23:36] the third the third foundation but on
[1:23:39] the fourth
[1:23:40] foundation that is perfection let me
[1:23:43] read a paragraph
[1:23:44] 17. all the oh if you want to sorry
[1:23:47] you can bring it up for for us you can
[1:23:52] if you have either the powerpoint or the
[1:23:53] code from the
[1:23:55] message you can bring it up sorry
[1:24:00] thank you paragraph 70 that all the
[1:24:03] prophet had flaws
[1:24:04] all the ones was a portion but here at
[1:24:07] last
[1:24:07] coming up through finally comes the
[1:24:09] masterpiece the perfect one
[1:24:11] no fault in him at all so perfect
[1:24:14] reflected
[1:24:15] of the builder himself his own image was
[1:24:17] reflected in his work
[1:24:18] god and christ were one in so much until
[1:24:21] he put
[1:24:22] his own spirit into him then even the
[1:24:24] image
[1:24:25] and the brother became one god and his
[1:24:27] sculptor
[1:24:28] work his masterpiece moses
[1:24:31] uh was in the working of saint angelo
[1:24:34] was in my angelo
[1:24:36] rather was his copter a sculptor awake
[1:24:39] that was
[1:24:40] that was dead because it had been made
[1:24:42] out of a stone but here the master
[1:24:44] builder when he got his handiwork
[1:24:46] perfected
[1:24:47] he stepped into it amen mark angelo
[1:24:50] couldn't step into his masterpiece
[1:24:52] but then the lord stepped into
[1:24:54] masterpiece and what is the masterpiece
[1:24:56] is you and i amen turn the word
[1:24:59] masterpiece around
[1:25:00] it's coming from two as master and peace
[1:25:03] if you turn it around
[1:25:04] you've got a peace of the master that is
[1:25:07] where the word is coming from so
[1:25:09] it's not you are not eliminated from the
[1:25:11] lord you are very
[1:25:13] the lord jesus christ in manifestation
[1:25:15] libra solomon's
[1:25:17] son is not an alien from him is his own
[1:25:20] blood
[1:25:21] is is part of him it's a manifestation
[1:25:23] of him amen
[1:25:25] so you are christ in manifestation
[1:25:28] for this day and for this hour just as
[1:25:31] peter and paul and moses and hannah
[1:25:35] and rebecca and elizabeth were christ in
[1:25:37] manifestation
[1:25:38] you are the modern day peter and hannah
[1:25:41] and joseph and what have you
[1:25:42] jesus christ on earth amen you are not
[1:25:45] an alien because before the foundation
[1:25:47] of the world
[1:25:47] as we read from ephesians chapter 1 4 he
[1:25:50] put those attributes in you
[1:25:52] you you wrote your name in the lamb's
[1:25:54] book of life what is the lamb book of
[1:25:56] life
[1:25:57] it is himself so you were part of him
[1:25:59] that's why you can never be lost
[1:26:02] there's no way it's impossible that
[1:26:04] you'll be lost no
[1:26:05] it's not your name was in the lamb's
[1:26:07] work of life so
[1:26:08] getting lost is out of the way you can
[1:26:09] make all the mistakes you want of course
[1:26:11] the lord can make you you will make you
[1:26:12] pay for it
[1:26:13] on earth regardless of you being a son
[1:26:15] or daughter but there's nothing like
[1:26:17] you getting lost because you are part of
[1:26:20] eternity
[1:26:21] if you get lost then the lord is not
[1:26:22] complete it's like you take a
[1:26:25] person's hand off the person is not
[1:26:27] complete because it's got a missing lamp
[1:26:29] or a missing finger the body is so
[1:26:31] they're all together that if you chop
[1:26:33] just
[1:26:33] a little part of the finger away the
[1:26:35] sense of balance is going to change
[1:26:37] because the whole body the working
[1:26:39] coordination they are part of each other
[1:26:41] amen
[1:26:42] glory hallelujah now let's look at this
[1:26:45] masterpiece
[1:26:47] when it came on earth here as in the
[1:26:48] form of the man jesus christ
[1:26:50] and we want to look at the powerpoints
[1:26:52] and look at some images which we know we
[1:26:54] want to look at huffman's head of christ
[1:26:58] at 33.
[1:27:07] praise god hallelujah
[1:27:11] this is the just the image of hoffman
[1:27:13] was a
[1:27:14] german sculptor he had an inspiration
[1:27:16] and he drew the lord jesus christ
[1:27:19] when he was just about to be crucified
[1:27:21] he spent about 33 to 33 and a half years
[1:27:23] on earth
[1:27:24] so that was what uh huffman portrayed he
[1:27:26] was a human being
[1:27:28] he was he had headaches he was sick he
[1:27:31] was tired
[1:27:32] sometimes because he wanted to be part
[1:27:34] of the attribute that you and i go
[1:27:36] through
[1:27:37] that's why the bible said that jesus
[1:27:38] christ the high priest
[1:27:40] who can be felt by what can be touched
[1:27:44] by the feeling and underline the word
[1:27:46] feeling
[1:27:47] of your infirmities because he's been
[1:27:49] sick before if he's not being sick
[1:27:50] before you and
[1:27:51] he wouldn't understand what sickness is
[1:27:53] he's been poor before
[1:27:54] he's been cast out before he had sorrow
[1:27:57] before
[1:27:57] even john is it 10 30 he said and jesus
[1:28:00] wept
[1:28:01] the almighty god cried he shared tears
[1:28:05] when his best friend of his best friend
[1:28:06] last rose died
[1:28:08] he cried because he had emotions just
[1:28:11] like you and i
[1:28:12] amen so when i go through emotional
[1:28:14] stress mental stress
[1:28:16] spiritual stress bodily stress he can
[1:28:19] feel you
[1:28:20] because he lives in your flesh amen by
[1:28:22] the feeling of your weaknesses
[1:28:24] of your infirmities and then come to
[1:28:26] your deliverance
[1:28:27] and bring you higher amen glory
[1:28:30] hallelujah so that was the man jesus
[1:28:32] christ
[1:28:32] the image of the man jesus christ on
[1:28:34] earth there's another picture
[1:28:36] and our arrival is something you
[1:28:37] understand why is barack you're showing
[1:28:39] us pictures
[1:28:40] we have the huffman picture here right
[1:28:42] here now this is another picture that uh
[1:28:44] hofsman's i think nephew painted of
[1:28:46] jesus christ
[1:28:47] and the disciples and that's the eastern
[1:28:50] the way they dress they wear ropes
[1:28:52] uh like choices wear ropes i mean they
[1:28:54] wear they have the inner garment and the
[1:28:56] ultra garment
[1:28:57] so that was the man jesus christ who was
[1:28:58] preaching on uh working
[1:29:00] in nazareth and judea and all the
[1:29:03] samaria and preaching the word of the
[1:29:04] lord
[1:29:05] that was the almighty god the fullness
[1:29:06] of christ was in him
[1:29:09] from uh adam to abraham they were
[1:29:11] portraying christ
[1:29:12] in parts and in bits like abraham was
[1:29:15] portraying christ
[1:29:16] in the form of faith isaac love
[1:29:19] jacob grace joseph perfection this man
[1:29:22] was the embodiment of
[1:29:24] all of them because he was the one that
[1:29:26] was powering
[1:29:27] that was feeding the corners amen but he
[1:29:30] was the fullness himself faith
[1:29:31] grace mercy love deliverance redemption
[1:29:35] eternity earth healing just name it
[1:29:39] you can be talking all day long right
[1:29:41] all those attributes
[1:29:43] list in him so he stepped here and he
[1:29:45] said
[1:29:46] i and my father are one if you see me
[1:29:49] you'll see my father jehovah
[1:29:52] the the jehovah of old testament who was
[1:29:55] worshiped who could come in the pill of
[1:29:56] fire
[1:29:57] so people will cry i mean moses we can't
[1:30:00] we can't encounter this
[1:30:02] this is too much just go listen to him
[1:30:03] and bring us the word now jehovah put
[1:30:06] himself
[1:30:06] bottled himself in a lot of flesh called
[1:30:08] jesus christ of nazareth
[1:30:10] who borrowed a woman to be born in now
[1:30:12] this jesus christ
[1:30:14] because it's eternity eternity can take
[1:30:16] any form
[1:30:17] that it wants to take eternity can't
[1:30:20] take any form like a dive and appear
[1:30:22] here
[1:30:22] it and it can preach to you like i'm
[1:30:24] preaching to you eternity can listen to
[1:30:25] the word like you are listening
[1:30:27] eternity can can't take any form it can
[1:30:30] come like
[1:30:30] like a dove like a wind like like like a
[1:30:33] computer it can't take any form
[1:30:35] because celestia is not limited it can
[1:30:38] come like any form like a jet plane do
[1:30:40] you know why
[1:30:40] sometimes and nasa and those scientists
[1:30:43] they call it ufo on identified flying
[1:30:46] object
[1:30:48] why they can't identify it i used to i
[1:30:50] bought when i was in uk i used to buy a
[1:30:51] book of
[1:30:52] uf and read and all of them said they
[1:30:54] couldn't they could see like a flight
[1:30:56] they thought it's maybe russia
[1:30:58] trying to spy on britain or america they
[1:31:00] tried to chase it they just disappear
[1:31:03] because celestial bodies can appear and
[1:31:06] disappear
[1:31:07] it's not restricted to foreigners of
[1:31:08] this building amen and that's the
[1:31:10] attribute that is who you are
[1:31:12] don't be restricted to this flesh amen
[1:31:15] this flesh is not your restriction this
[1:31:17] flesh can be 100 years old
[1:31:19] 120 140 whatever you're gonna drop it
[1:31:22] back to the cosmos
[1:31:23] but there's another flesh another blood
[1:31:26] no blood is fleshy blood
[1:31:28] but the blood is the holy spirit which
[1:31:30] can pass through walls
[1:31:31] who doesn't need to buy jet flight to fl
[1:31:34] to move to another country
[1:31:35] who doesn't need a vehicle to go back
[1:31:37] home after service
[1:31:38] who can just by thought you are in your
[1:31:41] house
[1:31:41] by thought your food is cooked already
[1:31:44] but i thought
[1:31:45] everything is done and now that thought
[1:31:48] in you
[1:31:48] want to express himself that even when
[1:31:51] you're sick
[1:31:51] sometimes you just by thinking your
[1:31:53] positive thinking
[1:31:55] the energy in you sometimes you don't
[1:31:57] even have to pray
[1:31:58] just by your thought coming from you
[1:32:00] bring the healing to your body
[1:32:01] bring the healing to your brother your
[1:32:03] sister your children
[1:32:04] because that being is in you it's not
[1:32:06] restricted to the weakness of this flesh
[1:32:09] amen and that being want to express
[1:32:11] himself
[1:32:12] and you just have to what yield to him
[1:32:14] and the more you yield to him he that is
[1:32:16] in you
[1:32:16] will take care of everything that you
[1:32:18] need amen
[1:32:20] glory hallelujah blessed be the name of
[1:32:22] the lord amen
[1:32:27] so now 1963 this man jesus christ took
[1:32:32] on another form he said over the years i
[1:32:34] don't want to go into church churches
[1:32:35] but we all know
[1:32:36] that the lord sent um serving messengers
[1:32:39] from paul he
[1:32:40] started with a covenant of grace and
[1:32:42] unconditional when he came on earth
[1:32:44] he has finished with the law the law has
[1:32:46] come to an end so he began with grace
[1:32:49] and he started with paul and we know
[1:32:51] paul was like we know his history he was
[1:32:53] a murderer he said look
[1:32:54] i'm the i'm the least of the apostles
[1:32:56] i'm not even worthy
[1:32:58] to call myself an apostle i'm not
[1:33:00] qualified to be a minister to preach to
[1:33:01] you
[1:33:02] but the lord by his grace because i what
[1:33:04] i wasted the church of the living god
[1:33:06] when they were killing stephen i was the
[1:33:08] one who took
[1:33:10] the you know like those times they had
[1:33:11] the outer garment and inner garment just
[1:33:13] like your
[1:33:13] your suit let them take your your outer
[1:33:15] coat for you so that you can really go
[1:33:17] into action
[1:33:18] throw the stone whip stephen is that our
[1:33:20] hours he didn't physically beat stephen
[1:33:22] to death
[1:33:22] but he did what we call in court aiding
[1:33:25] and albertan
[1:33:26] if you aid it means to help
[1:33:30] somebody or you push somebody or you
[1:33:32] conduct and connect with somebody
[1:33:33] to commit a crime you didn't personally
[1:33:36] commit a crime
[1:33:37] but you are part you are a criminal
[1:33:39] because it's your thought
[1:33:40] it's your ambition that was manifested
[1:33:42] in a person
[1:33:43] so we call it hidden and albertans so he
[1:33:45] was a criminal but the law did something
[1:33:47] when stephen was dying
[1:33:49] when the theophany of stephen was coming
[1:33:50] out he saw some supernatural
[1:33:53] which is beyond his theology which was
[1:33:56] beyond what
[1:33:56] gamaliel taught him which was beyond
[1:33:58] what the pharisees taught him
[1:34:00] which was beyond the law of moses which
[1:34:02] was beyond even what he has believed in
[1:34:03] moses which was
[1:34:04] the word of the lord and that's where
[1:34:06] all of us need to be you need to be go
[1:34:08] beyond believing the bible
[1:34:09] it's great to believe the bible that's
[1:34:11] the foundation the fear of the lord is
[1:34:13] the beginning of wisdom
[1:34:14] it's good to believe that prophet the
[1:34:16] prophet the lord sent to us willie
[1:34:17] abraham
[1:34:18] it's great to receive the prophet
[1:34:20] whoever you see the prophet receive the
[1:34:21] lord
[1:34:22] but then if you don't have jesus christ
[1:34:23] on the inside that one-on-one experience
[1:34:26] with the lord jesus christ
[1:34:27] it doesn't do you much good you'll be a
[1:34:29] fully educated message believer
[1:34:32] you'll be a fully educated a christian
[1:34:34] who knows the bible from cover to cover
[1:34:36] but there's no revelation of jesus
[1:34:39] christ from your inside out
[1:34:40] amen you'll be a theologian you'll be a
[1:34:44] christian
[1:34:44] jesus wasn't a i was a christian he was
[1:34:46] christ
[1:34:47] and the lord wants us to be christ
[1:34:50] christianity as a religion
[1:34:52] is just a covering religion means what
[1:34:55] covering
[1:34:56] i'm a muslim i'm a jewish i'm a
[1:34:59] christian
[1:35:00] i'm a hindu whatever i mean
[1:35:03] whatever so many buddhists i mean just
[1:35:05] name it i don't believe in nothing
[1:35:07] who don't believe in nothing atheist and
[1:35:09] this that is just a covering
[1:35:11] to put in a certain bracket but we are
[1:35:13] not talking about that we are talking
[1:35:14] about elohim
[1:35:16] the creator of heaven and earth living
[1:35:18] in your turn living in your flesh
[1:35:20] and manifesting himself out that is what
[1:35:22] makes you a christ
[1:35:24] not christian as a religion not a
[1:35:26] message believer
[1:35:27] you can bring the message but the
[1:35:29] message might not be in you
[1:35:32] you can know the bible here
[1:35:33] intellectually but the word
[1:35:36] the pill of fire when i'm talking about
[1:35:38] the word i'm not talking about
[1:35:39] scripts i'm not talking about english
[1:35:41] word and spanish word and
[1:35:43] and language is no the word is not a
[1:35:46] language
[1:35:46] no the word is not english it's not king
[1:35:50] james version
[1:35:51] it's not half man's version the word is
[1:35:53] life and that life is jesus christ
[1:35:56] is the celestial body the great
[1:35:58] theophany elohim
[1:35:59] el ella elohim in you manifesting
[1:36:01] himself in you
[1:36:02] so that people can see you without even
[1:36:04] talking they could see that there's
[1:36:05] christ
[1:36:06] in brother solomon because that is
[1:36:08] christ in sister virginia because of
[1:36:10] jesus christ and sister lois
[1:36:12] the christ in you is what makes the
[1:36:14] difference amen
[1:36:15] it's not what you pack up here you can
[1:36:17] pack religion here you can be so
[1:36:18] educated and proud like soul of tassels
[1:36:21] but you don't have nothing of jesus
[1:36:22] christ in you and that's why we have to
[1:36:25] know do i have christ in me
[1:36:27] and if you don't have a christ in you
[1:36:28] then you can't fulfill the law of god
[1:36:31] then it becomes a struggle it becomes
[1:36:33] like someone is pushing you
[1:36:34] if i don't do this they'll say this
[1:36:36] about me if i don't go to
[1:36:38] church oh my god is going to know i'm
[1:36:39] i'm sent from church
[1:36:41] if i don't do this oh people are going
[1:36:43] to if i do this who are going to watch
[1:36:44] me if people are not watching me i could
[1:36:45] do it but
[1:36:46] i probably my sisters are watching me no
[1:36:48] there's someone in you
[1:36:50] who speak to you my daughter go here
[1:36:53] do this don't do this go and tell this
[1:36:56] person this
[1:36:56] do this for me and that when you're
[1:36:58] working working one-on-one with the lord
[1:37:01] christ on the inside of you that is when
[1:37:04] you are
[1:37:04] on the right course with your maker amen
[1:37:08] blessed be the lord so let's see this
[1:37:10] man jesus christ in 1963
[1:37:12] he picked another form he revealed
[1:37:14] himself let's go to um
[1:37:17] thank you my sister reveal there was a
[1:37:20] cloud
[1:37:21] supernatural cloud they used to call it
[1:37:23] the caption in the news um
[1:37:25] science magazine was called mystery
[1:37:27] clouds on arizona
[1:37:30] on the skies of in this case of arizona
[1:37:31] and they didn't know which what this
[1:37:33] cloud was
[1:37:34] so there was a prophet on the land
[1:37:35] called willie abraham and they brought a
[1:37:37] copy of this photograph he didn't take
[1:37:39] these pictures
[1:37:39] it was the scientists and people they
[1:37:42] captured it from
[1:37:43] u.s from mexico canada and certain
[1:37:46] places
[1:37:47] and so there was a cloud which was
[1:37:49] beyond
[1:37:50] where there was strange cloud or mystery
[1:37:52] cloud
[1:37:53] which was beyond where the natural cloud
[1:37:55] could form jet plane can go above the
[1:37:57] cloud
[1:37:58] but they can't go above setting police
[1:38:01] even
[1:38:01] astronauts which goes into outer space
[1:38:04] in the moon
[1:38:05] they can fly so high but this cloud was
[1:38:08] uh
[1:38:08] how 27 27 miles way above
[1:38:13] where the normal clouds are so they
[1:38:15] rather no they detected on their
[1:38:16] computers
[1:38:17] and they saw that no there's something
[1:38:18] strange so they captured it with
[1:38:20] pictures
[1:38:21] and different observatories and computer
[1:38:23] whatever at that time
[1:38:25] captured it but they couldn't find they
[1:38:27] saw it was something mysterious
[1:38:28] what is this and a carpet landed in
[1:38:30] brahms hands and he said turn it upside
[1:38:32] down
[1:38:33] when they turn it you could see the
[1:38:34] picture of jesus christ
[1:38:36] you could see his eyes right here you
[1:38:39] could see
[1:38:40] the pill of fire around him the pillow
[1:38:42] fires the angels
[1:38:43] is that all of you were there amen we
[1:38:46] were part of him how many were in christ
[1:38:47] let me ask you questions how many were
[1:38:48] in jesus christ
[1:38:49] before the foundation of the world all
[1:38:52] of us
[1:38:53] how many were jesus christ when was
[1:38:55] crucified on cavalry
[1:38:57] because the bible said that when blood
[1:38:59] and water came from me you and i came
[1:39:00] from him
[1:39:02] how many were in the cloud of arizona
[1:39:04] when he appeared
[1:39:05] in that mystery cloud sometimes it's
[1:39:08] easy for people to believe something
[1:39:09] that happened
[1:39:10] four thousand years ago oh yes i believe
[1:39:13] moses was the prophet of god
[1:39:15] i believe abraham was a son of god but
[1:39:17] this brother sullivan i don't know about
[1:39:19] brad solomon
[1:39:20] i don't know but brother but i smiley i
[1:39:23] don't know whether it's a son of god or
[1:39:24] not
[1:39:26] you could believe that abraham was a son
[1:39:28] of god
[1:39:29] abram that he didn't meet but you can't
[1:39:30] believe that smile is the son of god
[1:39:32] you can't believe the man is the
[1:39:34] daughter of god then there's some
[1:39:35] because man wants history it's already
[1:39:37] passed
[1:39:38] but then when the word is made flesh it
[1:39:41] takes only eagles
[1:39:42] to be able to to see to see and accept
[1:39:44] it but when is history and is done is
[1:39:47] religion and covering oh yes i believe
[1:39:49] the law i believe they love moses
[1:39:51] but it's gone and bygone in history but
[1:39:53] when the lord is made flesh
[1:39:55] that's when you can have life in it amen
[1:39:58] glory so this cloud the lord gave uh
[1:40:01] revelation and and certain things to his
[1:40:03] servant things that were hidden in the
[1:40:04] bible
[1:40:05] let's read uh i think revelation chapter
[1:40:08] one
[1:40:09] and let's see how scriptures fulfill in
[1:40:12] a very small way and people jump over it
[1:40:14] revelation one for the sake of time i'll
[1:40:16] jump to
[1:40:17] [Music]
[1:40:19] verse maybe let's start from the verse
[1:40:22] one
[1:40:26] but verse seven is where i really want
[1:40:27] to land on so verse one said the
[1:40:29] revelation of jesus christ which god
[1:40:30] gave unto him
[1:40:32] to show unto his servant things which
[1:40:33] might shortly come to pass and is sent
[1:40:35] and signified it by
[1:40:36] his angel onto his servant john
[1:40:40] verse two okay let's jump to verse verse
[1:40:43] six
[1:40:44] verse six sees and has if you go home
[1:40:47] you can read the rest of the verses
[1:40:49] and he has made us kings and priests
[1:40:51] unto god and his father
[1:40:54] to him be glory and dominion forever and
[1:40:56] ever so he has made you kings and what
[1:40:59] priests verse seven behold
[1:41:02] he cometh with clouds and every eye
[1:41:04] shall see him
[1:41:06] and they also which pierce him and all
[1:41:08] kindreds
[1:41:09] of the earth shall well because of him
[1:41:12] even so
[1:41:13] amen versus said i'm out i'm alpha and
[1:41:16] omega the beginning and the end
[1:41:18] says the lord which is which was and
[1:41:21] which is to come the almighty
[1:41:23] so now john was caught in a vision
[1:41:26] and he saw he the lord showed him a lot
[1:41:29] of things and he saw the lord
[1:41:30] commit with clouds 1963
[1:41:34] that prophecy became this day
[1:41:37] this scripture is fulfilled the lord
[1:41:39] came in a class of arizona
[1:41:41] not just a cloud supernatural himself
[1:41:43] and he allowed his photograph to be
[1:41:44] taken by computers
[1:41:46] to be detected so that you and i will
[1:41:49] see
[1:41:50] that the word that is sent to was prof
[1:41:52] to his prophet
[1:41:53] was he and amen it was vindication of
[1:41:56] what you are believing now what is in
[1:41:57] you now
[1:41:58] amen it's just like it's not different
[1:42:00] from when the lord appeared to
[1:42:01] a paul on his way to damascus to
[1:42:04] persecute the christians
[1:42:05] in those time they didn't have camera
[1:42:07] and it wasn't time for the lord to
[1:42:08] reveal
[1:42:09] himself in that manner to them yet so he
[1:42:11] allowed soul of
[1:42:12] soul of tassels to see him and he had a
[1:42:15] personal testimony
[1:42:16] and he preached to him and not only that
[1:42:18] he appeared to me in vision
[1:42:19] but this time because we are an
[1:42:21] intellectual age and it's also scripture
[1:42:23] has been fulfilled the lord allows his
[1:42:24] photograph
[1:42:25] to be taken in the supernatural form and
[1:42:28] if you look at the photograph
[1:42:29] we go back to the picture you could see
[1:42:31] the head
[1:42:32] and if you go back to the messages i'm
[1:42:34] not i'm just using this one as an
[1:42:36] application
[1:42:37] if the lord makes a way someday we speak
[1:42:38] on it but then you could see but ram
[1:42:40] talk about even the beard
[1:42:42] you could see his beard you could see
[1:42:44] his eyeballs you could see
[1:42:46] white awake and what was the white wig
[1:42:48] it's the supreme authority
[1:42:50] the whole universe there's no power
[1:42:52] there's no putin
[1:42:53] there's no uh joe biden there's no trump
[1:42:57] there's no president there's no queen of
[1:42:58] queen elizabeth the most powerful person
[1:43:01] is the lord jesus christ and he's also
[1:43:03] served as the most humble person
[1:43:05] on earth amen that's why the people that
[1:43:08] are jesus christ
[1:43:09] they are not proud they walk humbly but
[1:43:12] christ
[1:43:12] is on the inside of them amen jesus
[1:43:15] christ glory hallelujah amen god bless
[1:43:18] you
[1:43:18] amen glory hallelujah so they work
[1:43:22] humbly
[1:43:23] but they are jesus christ in flesh amen
[1:43:26] and you can see jesus christ in them
[1:43:28] they don't have to tell you you can
[1:43:29] receive in their smile
[1:43:31] we'll let you know that jesus christ is
[1:43:32] in this sister jesus christ
[1:43:34] is in this woman jesus christ and this
[1:43:36] brother jesus christ in this
[1:43:38] man because they are christ in
[1:43:40] manifestation
[1:43:41] amen oh glory hallelujah we are already
[1:43:44] sitting in heavenly places in christ
[1:43:46] jesus
[1:43:47] how many know the opposition if you know
[1:43:49] position
[1:43:50] you are in in you all the attributes in
[1:43:52] you in is in you out
[1:43:55] it's not outside in it's inside out
[1:43:58] [Music]
[1:43:59] just like the new breath the new breath
[1:44:01] doesn't come it's not like jesus christ
[1:44:02] scoop
[1:44:03] his scoop and come and jump and enter
[1:44:05] into seeing you before the foundation of
[1:44:06] the world
[1:44:07] but when your your mind gets to know
[1:44:09] that he's on the inside
[1:44:10] that gives you your new breath amen
[1:44:14] the rapture is in you the holy ghost is
[1:44:17] in you
[1:44:18] where is the rapture taking you to
[1:44:20] heaven who is in you
[1:44:22] jesus christ where did jesus christ
[1:44:24] leave heaven
[1:44:26] he was only using this flesh when he's
[1:44:28] down with it he break it down to the
[1:44:29] cosmos
[1:44:31] and then he manifests right here at the
[1:44:33] other side
[1:44:34] they are sent here there are people
[1:44:36] watching us here
[1:44:37] they are not of this dimension they
[1:44:39] don't have flesh and blood
[1:44:40] they are flesh and blood is the
[1:44:42] celestial flesh and blood
[1:44:44] which you call the theophany the
[1:44:45] celestial body
[1:44:47] these our loved ones are here they are
[1:44:49] not somewhere in a physical distance
[1:44:51] they are right here amen
[1:44:55] oh my i don't know how to even explain
[1:44:57] it i don't want to go away from my
[1:44:58] salmon
[1:44:59] glory hallelujah to the lord when
[1:45:02] brother brahms says mother-in-law sister
[1:45:04] amides
[1:45:04] mother died and his wife was sad
[1:45:08] of course losing your mother is not a
[1:45:09] joke it's like a part of your heart has
[1:45:11] been taken away from you
[1:45:12] when you've lost a loved one before and
[1:45:14] you missed then you laughed and she was
[1:45:16] crying say oh pull me down
[1:45:17] i wish you could see she wasn't me to
[1:45:19] see what he was singing
[1:45:20] he said her mother is right there
[1:45:22] looking at her own the body the flesh
[1:45:24] she used living in
[1:45:25] she was standing right there her
[1:45:27] theophany was standing right there
[1:45:29] looking at their body being laid in a
[1:45:30] casket she had an experience in their
[1:45:33] flesh body that you and i were
[1:45:35] but when you finish you draw that
[1:45:37] experience
[1:45:38] and the celestial body in you take it to
[1:45:40] the other side
[1:45:42] so all that we are going through you are
[1:45:44] packing the word packing experience
[1:45:46] testimonies miracles the word upon the
[1:45:49] word
[1:45:50] and the word upon their word and they
[1:45:52] see the water upon the word
[1:45:53] and manifestation of wonder
[1:45:54] manifestation that experience
[1:45:57] will not be negated when you finish your
[1:45:59] life here
[1:46:00] that experience is taking the celestial
[1:46:01] body in you you will tell this body just
[1:46:03] like
[1:46:04] your clothes you're wearing after you go
[1:46:05] from here you don't go to the kitchen
[1:46:07] with this clothes
[1:46:08] when you go home say okay you you did a
[1:46:10] good job at the church but i need to be
[1:46:11] at the kitchen
[1:46:12] i need to cook for my children for their
[1:46:13] sisters i need to get something to eat
[1:46:15] so you want you you you take it away
[1:46:16] from you you if it's dead you throw in
[1:46:18] the in
[1:46:19] in a what you call it um laundry bag
[1:46:22] it doesn't mean you are dead your
[1:46:24] clothes is footing the laundry back by
[1:46:26] you
[1:46:27] yourself it's working at the kitchen
[1:46:29] preparing food for your children
[1:46:31] maybe the brothers maybe you want to
[1:46:32] surprise your wife preparing food for
[1:46:33] your wife and your children
[1:46:35] or being at the restaurant so when we
[1:46:37] leave this earthly tabernacle
[1:46:38] we are not dead christians do not die
[1:46:43] they change dimensions they swap
[1:46:46] clothing they swap garment
[1:46:49] but they do not die death do not pertain
[1:46:53] to you so brother people are dead people
[1:46:55] are in the mug no
[1:46:56] if he's a christian he's not dead he
[1:46:58] just laid his garment down
[1:46:59] but he or she herself is working right
[1:47:02] there
[1:47:03] in a higher body amen a body that cannot
[1:47:06] cry
[1:47:07] anybody that cannot have arthritis a
[1:47:09] body that cannot have blood pressure
[1:47:11] a body that can offer a coronavirus a
[1:47:14] body that cannot be sick
[1:47:16] a body that cannot be hungry anybody
[1:47:18] that cannot
[1:47:19] own mortgage and rent a body that
[1:47:21] doesn't need american dollars
[1:47:23] a body that is celestia a body that
[1:47:25] walks in can walk through the walls
[1:47:27] and that is who you are amen glory
[1:47:34] hallelujah
[1:47:36] so glory hallelujah let's look at
[1:47:39] another another one of the pictures
[1:47:41] so please show me that one which is
[1:47:42] green that is even more clearer
[1:47:46] this is the lord captured
[1:47:49] and you were there 1963. it wasn't
[1:47:52] remember where we already said uh
[1:47:54] hebrews 12 cloud of witness
[1:47:56] the lord himself and all the sons and
[1:47:59] daughters of god
[1:48:00] even those who are not born i wasn't
[1:48:02] born in 1963
[1:48:04] some of some probably might be born
[1:48:05] already we're here on earth
[1:48:07] but some of us were on the other side
[1:48:09] but wherever the lord goes
[1:48:11] like a king entourage the subject go
[1:48:13] with him
[1:48:14] so we work with him on the other side
[1:48:16] before even we picked this our sistine
[1:48:18] element to live in it
[1:48:19] we were in the mystery cloud people saw
[1:48:21] us as club but there was a picture of a
[1:48:23] solomon
[1:48:24] but a troy sister sister my sisters and
[1:48:27] my brothers here
[1:48:28] and all the body of christ we were all
[1:48:30] there
[1:48:31] in that little cloud glory hallelujah
[1:48:35] we were in him before the foundation of
[1:48:37] the world where him on calvary
[1:48:39] where him on 63 clouds and we are still
[1:48:42] in him and he seen us
[1:48:44] amen is the same lord jesus christ we
[1:48:46] are eternal being
[1:48:48] so he wanted to you know you don't you
[1:48:50] can't remember it's just like
[1:48:52] prove to me do you remember when we were
[1:48:53] in the lord before the foundation of the
[1:48:54] world no
[1:48:55] this mind is finite right it's just a
[1:48:58] little little
[1:48:59] little little something here it can
[1:49:01] think so far
[1:49:03] our eyes can't see so far but there's an
[1:49:05] unseen eyes
[1:49:07] there's celestial being that remembers
[1:49:09] everything
[1:49:10] amen look at william let me for example
[1:49:13] but abram's daughter who died sharon
[1:49:15] rosharon
[1:49:16] at six months or two years less than two
[1:49:18] years when william brown went to the
[1:49:20] other side
[1:49:21] he was crying the lord wanted to comfort
[1:49:23] him he broke into the other side
[1:49:26] and was wearing his american heart he
[1:49:27] saw a young lady and
[1:49:29] just like his age group so he took took
[1:49:32] off his heart
[1:49:32] and greeted the lady said dad welcome

[1:49:42] are this is heaven
[1:49:44] he said i am your i'm your rosharan on
[1:49:47] earth
[1:49:48] and william ram was quickened rosharan
[1:49:50] you've gone to be a beautiful lady
[1:49:52] how he said this is heaven this is what
[1:49:55] you preach
[1:49:56] and mommies in the home would you say
[1:49:58] home perhaps a drunkard and they died
[1:50:00] drinking
[1:50:01] i don't have we have vagabonds you don't
[1:50:02] have a home say here you have a home
[1:50:04] and the the chair who wanted to you
[1:50:07] wanted to buy you couldn't buy it
[1:50:08] it was right there his dog was right
[1:50:11] there
[1:50:11] his uh donkey horse was right there old
[1:50:14] fries and old charlie were right there
[1:50:16] his loved ones were gathered with him
[1:50:18] over there if the lord gave willem ram
[1:50:21] his dogs and his dog and donkey
[1:50:24] horse how much more your loved ones your
[1:50:26] children
[1:50:27] your husband your brother your cousin
[1:50:30] your friends if animals were represented
[1:50:35] there
[1:50:35] they have to finally put it that way the
[1:50:37] lord gave them to you fun because there
[1:50:39] are some things that are dear to you
[1:50:41] how much more your children your
[1:50:43] grandchildren your friends
[1:50:44] you already there don't worry about what
[1:50:47] you see them now
[1:50:48] they have a see they have a
[1:50:49] representation and the representation is
[1:50:51] what the lord is looking up to
[1:50:53] amen glory hallelujah
[1:51:00] and yes another one the blue
[1:51:03] supernatural cloud formed by seven
[1:51:05] angels
[1:51:06] scientists gave them so many names but
[1:51:08] now i want to jump to
[1:51:10] i want i don't want to take too much
[1:51:11] time so i don't want to do too much
[1:51:13] reading
[1:51:14] we so now those were the clouds now this
[1:51:17] cloud
[1:51:18] remember i told you jesus of 63 as we
[1:51:20] showed with hoffman's head of
[1:51:22] christ 63 yes we believe that was christ
[1:51:25] came
[1:51:25] not a picture but jesus christ came on
[1:51:27] earth to do the redemption story
[1:51:29] but yes it doesn't benefit me and you
[1:51:32] if he doesn't he's not living on the
[1:51:34] inside of me
[1:51:36] no matter how you claim you're a
[1:51:37] christian yes i believe in christianity
[1:51:39] i don't believe in
[1:51:40] islam or uh i'm not an atheist i believe
[1:51:43] there's god
[1:51:44] let me send you to one scripture uh acts
[1:51:47] chapter 19 verse one to five
[1:51:50] so paul was preaching with his disciples
[1:51:53] and he
[1:51:53] came across another preacher apolos
[1:51:56] who was preaching jesus christ this time
[1:51:58] to mention the name jesus christ
[1:52:00] could land you in death or in jail or
[1:52:03] weapon
[1:52:04] it's not just a pain they whip you with
[1:52:06] animal skin
[1:52:08] which is dried rope
[1:52:11] and when they whip you use blood will be
[1:52:13] oozing out of your body
[1:52:14] that was the kind of weapon paul and co
[1:52:16] went through
[1:52:18] so to mention the name jesus christ not
[1:52:20] that i believe in jesus christ but
[1:52:21] mention jesus christ means you and your
[1:52:22] family you you are mentioned that name
[1:52:24] we heard your daughter talking about
[1:52:25] jesus christ do you believe in jesus
[1:52:26] christ you have to make a quick decision
[1:52:29] because you could face death and those
[1:52:30] times they don't care it's demons
[1:52:32] they could rape pregnant women and they
[1:52:35] would tell the husband to laugh
[1:52:36] if you don't laugh they do the same
[1:52:38] thing to you
[1:52:39] that was what they went through but the
[1:52:41] lord anointed them with a spirit of a
[1:52:42] lion a lion is a feastless animal
[1:52:45] a lion can go through anything it
[1:52:47] doesn't have nothing like a fear no it's
[1:52:49] not part of his life
[1:52:50] so the lord gave even the women the
[1:52:51] children that anointed
[1:52:53] that they went through death they just
[1:52:55] transitioned to the other side without
[1:52:57] being afraid of the name jesus christ so
[1:52:59] paul met this man
[1:53:00] gentleman and was preaching that jesus
[1:53:02] christ was the lord
[1:53:04] that the jewish people and the romans
[1:53:06] crucified so paul asked him that hey
[1:53:09] brought you up the holy ghost and he
[1:53:11] said holy ghost what is that i don't
[1:53:12] know what you're talking about
[1:53:14] and supporting that oh okay how are you
[1:53:16] baptized
[1:53:17] he said i was baptized with john baptism
[1:53:20] by emission
[1:53:21] from uh uh from from your sin baptism in
[1:53:24] water doesn't take your son
[1:53:26] but it's a good question and john
[1:53:28] baptized onto emotion
[1:53:29] so we did it i was baptized so okay
[1:53:32] remember john said that there's one
[1:53:33] greater than
[1:53:34] himself and he was the lord jesus christ
[1:53:37] the almighty god
[1:53:38] he will not just baptize you by
[1:53:40] mentioning water but he'll baptize you
[1:53:42] with what
[1:53:43] with fire and burning
[1:53:46] you can marry a woman have a fantastic
[1:53:48] wedding
[1:53:50] spend about 10 billion dollars on the
[1:53:52] wedding
[1:53:53] buy 25 100 carat gold
[1:53:57] at the cost of 25 million dollars for
[1:54:00] that wedding
[1:54:01] if after the wedding don't put your life
[1:54:02] in the woman that is not a marriage
[1:54:05] because the life has to be the woman to
[1:54:07] bring your image and the woman's image
[1:54:09] so if the lord the what baptism in the
[1:54:11] name of the lord jesus christ just a
[1:54:13] wedding
[1:54:14] you are accepted the lord jesus christ
[1:54:15] jesus christ you want him to be your
[1:54:17] lord and your husband
[1:54:18] so you're taking your name off and your
[1:54:21] nature of lord i don't want my nature i
[1:54:23] want you to be my lord
[1:54:24] i don't want to walk the world to
[1:54:26] control me i don't want satan to control
[1:54:27] me
[1:54:28] i want you to be my masterpiece but then
[1:54:31] when you are baptized when you have your
[1:54:32] wedding the pastor baptizes you
[1:54:34] in the a river or lake or whatever pool
[1:54:37] and he gives you a baptism certificate
[1:54:39] and the lord jesus christ doesn't put
[1:54:41] his life in you
[1:54:42] one-on-one you are not married to him
[1:54:47] you're only trying to bear his name call
[1:54:50] yourself a christian
[1:54:51] a believer but alive the gem life is not
[1:54:54] there
[1:54:55] and that is where i want us to land amen
[1:54:58] so let's go to um let me see
[1:55:04] let's read i think i'll skip some of my
[1:55:06] readings let's read um
[1:55:08] evidence of the um crisis the mystery of
[1:55:11] god revealed
[1:55:12] it's in one of my powerpoints but you
[1:55:14] can pull it it's paragraph two
[1:55:16] two three christ is the mystery of god
[1:55:21] revealed grace 2 3 3 say look
[1:55:24] christ in you makes him
[1:55:27] the center of life of the revelation c
[1:55:30] christ
[1:55:31] life in you makes him the center
[1:55:34] of the revelation christ in the bible
[1:55:38] makes the bible the complete revelation
[1:55:40] of jesus of christ
[1:55:42] christ in you makes you the complete
[1:55:45] revelation of the whole
[1:55:47] thing and i want you to take your time
[1:55:49] and absorb this
[1:55:51] and i'll go over again look
[1:55:55] when prophet said behold when you read
[1:55:57] the bible and the
[1:55:58] the lord when you read he said behold
[1:56:00] look it means
[1:56:01] something of utter utmost important
[1:56:03] importance
[1:56:04] so look christ in you makes him the
[1:56:07] center of life
[1:56:08] of the revelation so when christ is in
[1:56:11] you
[1:56:11] it makes him christ the almighty the
[1:56:14] center of life
[1:56:15] of his revelation when it's on the
[1:56:17] inside of you
[1:56:19] christ life in you which is christ
[1:56:21] himself in you makes him
[1:56:23] the center of the revelation christ in
[1:56:25] the bible
[1:56:26] when you bring the bible it makes the
[1:56:28] bible the complete revelation of christ
[1:56:30] in other words when we talk about the
[1:56:31] attribute the masterpieces
[1:56:33] uh the the building the lord was the
[1:56:36] attribute
[1:56:37] from abraham and all the prophets and
[1:56:39] all the women in the bible
[1:56:40] without christ it's just an empty bible
[1:56:43] so it's christ which makes the bible
[1:56:45] complete
[1:56:46] whether it's the old testament new
[1:56:47] testament or present day
[1:56:49] now he said
[1:56:52] christ in you makes you the complete
[1:56:55] revelation of the whole thing
[1:56:57] the bible christ and you the whole thing
[1:57:00] and see
[1:57:01] what is the new breath you say well but
[1:57:04] abraham what is the new birth it is the
[1:57:06] revelation of jesus christ
[1:57:08] personally to you and i want us to
[1:57:11] absorb that it is not being a church
[1:57:14] member
[1:57:15] it does not say that oh i belong to this
[1:57:16] church it is not to be a good person
[1:57:19] i don't drink i don't smoke i don't cast
[1:57:21] those are good as a human being nobody
[1:57:23] was
[1:57:23] born drinking and casting with cigarette
[1:57:25] on his mouth if a mother has a child and
[1:57:27] the child has got cigarette
[1:57:29] on their child's mouth maybe the mother
[1:57:30] would throw the child away
[1:57:32] and i mean i'll give it to the midwife
[1:57:34] and said i don't want to don't tell
[1:57:35] nobody that
[1:57:35] that was my child you can let somebody
[1:57:37] adopt this child i don't want to be
[1:57:38] named this child has got a cigarette on
[1:57:40] his mouth
[1:57:40] or marijuana on his mouth or crack
[1:57:42] cocaine crystal in his hands
[1:57:44] i don't want nothing to do with this
[1:57:45] child so nobody was born with with those
[1:57:48] stuff in our hands so if you don't do
[1:57:50] them
[1:57:50] glory hallelujah amen but those those
[1:57:53] things
[1:57:53] not doing them that do not make you a
[1:57:55] christian not drinking no smoking makes
[1:57:57] you a good
[1:57:58] social person so was a good social
[1:58:01] person
[1:58:02] uh the rich young ruler in the bible who
[1:58:04] came to jesus christ asking for he was
[1:58:06] kind of bargaining with the lord jesus
[1:58:08] christ
[1:58:09] and the lord saw him he said i mean he
[1:58:11] wanted to eternal life he came to the
[1:58:12] lord with a question
[1:58:13] and said you know the law he took him to
[1:58:15] the law he said with the law
[1:58:17] from abraham all the way from adam to
[1:58:19] moses
[1:58:20] i've obeyed all the law and the bible
[1:58:22] said jesus christ
[1:58:24] knew he was sincere and he loved him for
[1:58:25] that for keeping himself clean not
[1:58:28] drinking no smoking
[1:58:29] but that didn't give him eternal life
[1:58:31] eternal life is accepting the word for
[1:58:33] your day
[1:58:34] encountering the lord jesus christ
[1:58:35] one-on-one so he said go and sell all
[1:58:38] that you have
[1:58:39] not the physical riches but he had
[1:58:42] spiritual riches
[1:58:43] he was a holy man righteous man
[1:58:46] he was somebody with a noble character
[1:58:49] he had a testimony in society
[1:58:50] but i said that is still a bad garbage
[1:58:52] throw it away
[1:58:53] and come and accept that word but that
[1:58:55] was too heavy for him
[1:58:57] he couldn't accept it if you can accept
[1:58:59] the word that is being preached to you
[1:59:01] if you cannot say being born again that
[1:59:03] regardless of who you
[1:59:04] are the old life that came through your
[1:59:07] mother you came through your the laws of
[1:59:09] your dad and your mom
[1:59:10] womb that life will not take you today
[1:59:13] the other side
[1:59:14] you need another life a baptism a
[1:59:17] quickening condition
[1:59:18] a new breath the old person has to die
[1:59:22] in you baptism is death when you die
[1:59:24] then you get buried
[1:59:25] so that's why when you go to baptize
[1:59:27] it's a symbol of you being buried in the
[1:59:29] water another supernaturally
[1:59:31] not the first cow the humans product but
[1:59:33] the old person the whole being
[1:59:34] the old nature they also dies and christ
[1:59:37] comes in in you already in the seed form
[1:59:40] quicken your body
[1:59:41] but then god requires your will if you
[1:59:43] give your world to him
[1:59:44] he'll do that for you amen a man cannot
[1:59:47] just say that oh i love this woman you
[1:59:49] just you don't even wait for the one to
[1:59:50] say yes
[1:59:51] okay you grab the woman and go and have
[1:59:53] a wedding and live with her no
[1:59:55] it doesn't happen that way the one has a
[1:59:57] wall she can say yes or no
[1:59:59] you can go away i don't want you so
[2:00:01] christ is a gentleman he's a husband
[2:00:03] looking for a wife and he wants you to
[2:00:06] accept him or reject him
[2:00:07] amen you can't be in between you can be
[2:00:11] a holy you can be a sober drunk person
[2:00:14] you have to be drunk or sober you have
[2:00:16] to be christ
[2:00:17] or not a christ it's not being belonging
[2:00:20] to a tabernacle or i belong to this
[2:00:21] tabernacle
[2:00:22] that doesn't that is just a church amen
[2:00:26] but god is not looking for a church he's
[2:00:28] looking for you personally
[2:00:30] he's looking for me personally that's
[2:00:31] why he said that brother what is the new
[2:00:33] birth
[2:00:34] it is the revelation of jesus christ
[2:00:36] personally to you
[2:00:39] not you joined a church you shook a hand
[2:00:41] you done something different
[2:00:43] you said a creed you promised to live by
[2:00:45] a code of rules
[2:00:46] but christ the bible he's the word that
[2:00:49] was revealed to you
[2:00:50] and no matter what anybody sees what
[2:00:52] takes place is christ
[2:00:53] pastor priest whatever it might be it's
[2:00:56] christ in you
[2:00:58] that is the revelation of that that is
[2:00:59] the revelation that the church was built
[2:01:02] upon amen let me read another
[2:01:06] quotation from here separation from
[2:01:07] unbelief
[2:01:10] paragraph where's my paragraph
[2:01:14] okay start i start with if if you were
[2:01:17] lying down grasping
[2:01:18] gasping for your breath i don't have the
[2:01:21] coach here
[2:01:22] but uh maybe you can use my um
[2:01:25] my powerpoint if if you find a code find
[2:01:27] if you don't find it yeah let's do the
[2:01:29] powerpoint
[2:01:30] is that if you were lying down grasping
[2:01:32] or gasping for life
[2:01:33] death rattles in your throat 50 doctors
[2:01:36] standing around you
[2:01:37] he's going he's going out to god in the
[2:01:39] next five minutes he's living now
[2:01:41] and now in your heart you believe jesus
[2:01:43] christ had healed you
[2:01:45] that wouldn't bother you a bit just as
[2:01:47] sure as there's god in heaven
[2:01:49] you come out of it yes sir cause god's
[2:01:51] duty he's god to keep
[2:01:53] his word and you will never know what
[2:01:55] christ
[2:01:56] or what the word is until first the holy
[2:01:59] spirit has personally
[2:02:01] revealed it to you in your heart then
[2:02:03] you know that
[2:02:05] jesus is the lord when your heart says
[2:02:07] so
[2:02:08] not when your knowledge says so when
[2:02:10] your heart
[2:02:11] says so then that's when you know it
[2:02:13] amen
[2:02:15] when your heart can see something in you
[2:02:17] when the word is being preached
[2:02:18] your your heart accepted your what your
[2:02:21] your heart says amen
[2:02:23] not your mind or if i don't say am in
[2:02:24] the preacher the preacher man will think
[2:02:26] i don't believe the word
[2:02:27] that is intellectual amen for me i don't
[2:02:30] care whether you say i mean or not i
[2:02:32] mean i don't preach based on amen
[2:02:34] preaching what is the man on the inside
[2:02:35] preaches out amen
[2:02:37] but then when the evil is coming from
[2:02:39] the christ on the inside
[2:02:41] and that is when it makes a difference
[2:02:43] when you do things from the inside out
[2:02:46] not from here this guy here the devil
[2:02:48] can deceive you
[2:02:49] that's what mankind we came into what we
[2:02:50] were in but when the man on the inside
[2:02:53] the lord jesus christ himself takes over
[2:02:55] your heart
[2:02:56] you give it to him all your heart all
[2:02:59] your mind
[2:03:00] your body your soul that whatever you
[2:03:03] you
[2:03:03] are and you have it's not for you it's
[2:03:06] for the man jesus christ
[2:03:08] to reveal his character to express the
[2:03:11] eternal attribute in you
[2:03:12] then the lord takes over your life and
[2:03:15] everything become different
[2:03:16] amen and i'm going to tell you a little
[2:03:19] listen for
[2:03:19] for us parents uh as we see the society
[2:03:23] is this out just something
[2:03:24] a story not a story something a word of
[2:03:26] wisdom the lord put upon my heart to
[2:03:28] share with you
[2:03:29] there's a saying one let me read that
[2:03:31] quote quotation and then
[2:03:33] i think that might be my last quotation
[2:03:35] and then i'll go ahead and tell
[2:03:37] the word of wisdom let's read a
[2:03:40] quotation from a nigerian writer called
[2:03:41] chinuachibi
[2:03:42] and that's on the ninth into um okay
[2:03:45] here we go
[2:03:46] is that any any kid the bird says that
[2:03:49] since that since men have learned to
[2:03:52] shoot without mason
[2:03:53] he has learned to fly without preaching
[2:03:55] and he wrote in a book called things for
[2:03:57] things fall apart now we're going to use
[2:04:00] this one the lord gave me a wisdom for
[2:04:02] children amen many many our parents have
[2:04:05] got children
[2:04:07] now the world that we are living in the
[2:04:09] world is full of wisdom
[2:04:11] knowledge technology devices
[2:04:14] destruction hell we know when the seas
[2:04:17] were open
[2:04:18] the bible the prophet told us that how
[2:04:19] many demons if you read the book of
[2:04:21] revelation
[2:04:22] demons from who were bound yeah they
[2:04:24] were bound now that was they were not in
[2:04:25] operation
[2:04:26] demons and officers capable to put them
[2:04:28] in jail but the lord put them in a
[2:04:30] position where they don't operate
[2:04:31] on men and women but now when the
[2:04:34] services were revealed
[2:04:35] when the lord fullness of christ was
[2:04:36] revealed the same time
[2:04:39] hell is like a in a bucket the lead was
[2:04:42] open
[2:04:42] and those demons jump on the earth so
[2:04:45] now they can
[2:04:45] operate on human beings operate on
[2:04:47] everybody president whatever
[2:04:50] from the pope whoever they can operate
[2:04:52] on any person
[2:04:53] so that's why we see the word going
[2:04:55] there well let me go back to the
[2:04:56] prophet's time
[2:04:57] prophet time was talking about
[2:04:58] homosexualism and so forth
[2:05:01] but they said even in government they
[2:05:03] were doing it it's not even parents i
[2:05:05] have letters here parents are crying
[2:05:06] their children are becoming
[2:05:08] gays and lesbians but he never talked
[2:05:10] about
[2:05:11] he will even talk about school they
[2:05:13] teach them children how to have sex
[2:05:15] and to be productive but they never talk
[2:05:17] about school
[2:05:18] children being taught to be gays and
[2:05:20] lesbians
[2:05:22] now they have books in england they have
[2:05:24] books
[2:05:25] which sometimes they try to get before
[2:05:26] they cover they get children to go for a
[2:05:29] trip
[2:05:29] and during those those trips they teach
[2:05:31] the children
[2:05:32] how to accept that you can have your
[2:05:34] mother and father being
[2:05:36] a brother john cena mrs johnson the same
[2:05:39] person
[2:05:40] a man and a man can be your father and
[2:05:42] your mother
[2:05:43] or a woman a woman can be your mother
[2:05:45] and a mother mother and father
[2:05:47] which is pervasion of nature so that's
[2:05:50] where we have come to
[2:05:52] and as the writer said that the best
[2:05:54] land at hunters
[2:05:55] learn how to shoot without missing their
[2:05:57] target what did the best do
[2:05:59] they learn to fly without perching on
[2:06:01] trees for the hunter to shoot them
[2:06:04] amen the lord has given us wisdom to
[2:06:06] combat
[2:06:07] the antichrist pray don't look at
[2:06:09] antichrist as
[2:06:11] pope john paul i mean or whatever pope
[2:06:13] francis antichrist
[2:06:14] is a spirit any person that is not born
[2:06:17] again is antichrist if i should put in
[2:06:18] his plain weights
[2:06:19] if christ is not the inside turns out
[2:06:22] you might do good things
[2:06:24] but have you seen the lizard the lizard
[2:06:27] the physicist of eliza is
[2:06:28] black and white he's got a white
[2:06:31] feces and the black comes out so if you
[2:06:34] don't if you don't have the new breath
[2:06:36] your works will be good and bad it's
[2:06:38] true of knowledge of good and bad
[2:06:40] it doesn't mean you do all bad things or
[2:06:42] you do all good things
[2:06:44] but good and bad isn't it but when the
[2:06:46] holy ghost takes over your life
[2:06:48] you move from the tree of knowledge of
[2:06:50] good and evil
[2:06:52] to tree of life you are not operating on
[2:06:55] knowledge
[2:06:55] that oh this is good i shouldn't go and
[2:06:57] fight because if i fight
[2:06:59] no it's not good the church will hear
[2:07:01] i'm fighting
[2:07:02] but i'll cook with a fighter no no no no
[2:07:04] it's not on the inside of me to do that
[2:07:07] but when i didn't have the holy ghost i
[2:07:09] had i'm left-handed
[2:07:11] and sometimes i could get mad i have to
[2:07:12] pocket put my mind in my in my pocket
[2:07:14] and hold it frame
[2:07:16] praying that i wouldn't use this left
[2:07:17] hand
[2:07:20] and i used it a couple times so when the
[2:07:23] holy ghost is not there
[2:07:25] you don't have the control tower to
[2:07:26] control you you can't even control your
[2:07:28] own self
[2:07:29] you can't control your flesh but when
[2:07:31] the holy ghost comes
[2:07:33] and the lord tried me when i had the
[2:07:34] holy ghost oh my goodness i was tried
[2:07:36] and said where's my i still have my left
[2:07:37] hand
[2:07:38] but i couldn't use it it's like peter
[2:07:40] peter was able to slay someone say yes
[2:07:43] but when he was born again when they
[2:07:44] were crucified and said oh you know this
[2:07:46] this is not the pita you guys knew you
[2:07:47] knew me
[2:07:48] you couldn't arrest me your ears would
[2:07:51] be gone already
[2:07:52] but the holy ghost on the inside said
[2:07:53] look don't worry i'm not afraid to die
[2:07:55] just tell me upside down
[2:07:56] i don't want to die the way my cries i'm
[2:07:58] not worthy of him you crucify him
[2:08:00] upright
[2:08:01] tell me absolutely and crucify me that
[2:08:03] wasn't the peter that wasn't the old
[2:08:04] simon
[2:08:05] that someone died amen there's a new
[2:08:08] peter in him
[2:08:09] who is the lord jesus christ else you
[2:08:11] couldn't i mean venture
[2:08:13] go your ears already gone you try again
[2:08:16] your head will be off
[2:08:18] but the new breath makes the difference
[2:08:21] the holy ghost baptism so the lord gave
[2:08:23] me a word of wisdom for parents
[2:08:25] that parents should have spiritual time
[2:08:28] with their children
[2:08:30] what we preach here they have celestial
[2:08:32] beings they are celestial been
[2:08:33] understand
[2:08:34] but their natural mind do not understand
[2:08:36] most of the things we preach
[2:08:38] because we don't have time to break it
[2:08:39] down to the children's level so when our
[2:08:41] parents you have
[2:08:42] the duty to take the same word that by
[2:08:45] the job preach
[2:08:46] brother smiley and all the ministers
[2:08:48] preach and go and break
[2:08:50] it down to your children and every i'm
[2:08:52] going to give you something
[2:08:54] i'll give you a guideline as to how you
[2:08:55] do it that uh
[2:08:57] children go to school thank god on coach
[2:09:00] thank god for the covet
[2:09:01] they don't go to school as much like
[2:09:02] they used to go sometimes they spend
[2:09:04] much
[2:09:05] a lot of time in school learning certain
[2:09:06] things that you didn't teach them
[2:09:09] but it's cool put it in them and they
[2:09:11] will be children are like garden
[2:09:13] like a land or plant you can
[2:09:16] fertilize the land plant whatever you
[2:09:18] want on the land you want to plant mango
[2:09:21] whatever cocoa palm tree
[2:09:24] whatever tomato plant on the land and
[2:09:27] pour whatever fertilizer
[2:09:28] and nutrients you want the way you want
[2:09:30] it you can plant whatever
[2:09:32] soils and nutrients to come up so the
[2:09:34] children are like a garden
[2:09:36] school put things in them now don't
[2:09:38] worry about school because because of
[2:09:39] coffee pork they don't go to school
[2:09:41] but a cell phone internet youtube
[2:09:45] google what else uh icloud just name it
[2:09:48] uh twitter whatever right they put stuff
[2:09:52] in them
[2:09:52] that you didn't put in them god didn't
[2:09:55] put in them
[2:09:56] and sometimes a certain age they don't
[2:09:57] react they don't react upon that but
[2:09:59] when they get to certain age
[2:10:00] of accountability then they'll start
[2:10:03] begin to manifest
[2:10:04] and say why didn't put this in my son i
[2:10:06] didn't put in my daughter why is it
[2:10:07] manifesting
[2:10:09] so it's good as parents as you do every
[2:10:11] obligation
[2:10:12] work and feed them go to school to give
[2:10:14] them careers
[2:10:15] but the most important career is what
[2:10:17] god chose for them
[2:10:19] so have a time with your son maybe take
[2:10:21] him not
[2:10:22] the place that he used to not in the
[2:10:24] living room
[2:10:25] even though if you have time not in the
[2:10:26] house take your son or your daughter
[2:10:28] outside a park maybe both parents
[2:10:32] and tell your son that you're not in
[2:10:34] trouble you haven't done anything wrong
[2:10:35] but you just want to go and talk
[2:10:37] and when you go ask him that to pray
[2:10:40] with him
[2:10:40] as praying pray first and let your son
[2:10:42] or your daughter know that
[2:10:44] you have a purpose on this earth you
[2:10:46] came through the loins of me and your
[2:10:48] mother
[2:10:49] but your true mother and father is the
[2:10:51] lord jesus christ
[2:10:53] and as a parent we have to connect you
[2:10:55] to him
[2:10:56] and you have to give your world to him
[2:10:59] now there's something called
[2:11:00] holy ghost baptism new breath baptism in
[2:11:03] the name of jesus christ
[2:11:06] that is the most important thing you
[2:11:08] need to have in your life
[2:11:10] we can buy you clothes work and bloat
[2:11:13] mansions for you
[2:11:14] both companies for you that when you get
[2:11:15] old you can take over or whenever you
[2:11:17] can take over or
[2:11:18] save for you billions of dollars for you
[2:11:20] it will not benefit you a dime
[2:11:22] if you don't have christ on the inside
[2:11:25] so as my child i want to pray with you
[2:11:28] and i want you to have the desire
[2:11:30] to ask the lord to come and live on the
[2:11:33] inside of you to take over your life
[2:11:35] because like i said as the they asked
[2:11:38] the hunter begin to shoot without
[2:11:39] missing
[2:11:40] what do you have to do you have to fly
[2:11:42] without preaching
[2:11:44] you have to go to go about five times
[2:11:47] what you need to do as a parent
[2:11:49] to get your children to where the the
[2:11:51] things of the world
[2:11:52] will not even tempt them anymore and let
[2:11:54] go back to the bible like moses
[2:11:56] remember the moses story when he was
[2:11:58] born he was privileged to
[2:12:00] be raised by his mother his mother and
[2:12:02] even being paid for it
[2:12:03] their mother took advantage and planted
[2:12:05] the seed in him
[2:12:07] that hey moses beware you are not
[2:12:10] an egyptian always the mother will tell
[2:12:13] him
[2:12:13] you are never an egyptian yes you have
[2:12:16] been privileged to become a
[2:12:18] pharaoh to be but always know that your
[2:12:20] people
[2:12:21] are the people who are the mad davis and
[2:12:24] you were born a deliverer
[2:12:26] before you were born your dad used to
[2:12:28] pray when you come from work
[2:12:29] he doesn't eat i call your dad amram
[2:12:32] your food is really said no i'm going to
[2:12:33] pray today we're whipped
[2:12:35] things are getting worse they don't even
[2:12:37] give a straw to to
[2:12:38] to to do their job we have to go get our
[2:12:41] own straw
[2:12:41] i can't eat your father i'll go upstairs
[2:12:43] and go and pray go to the antique and go
[2:12:45] and pray
[2:12:46] and when the angel of the lord came that
[2:12:48] amram you
[2:12:49] and joakibet you're going to have a son
[2:12:51] who delivered
[2:12:52] israel from egypt so you were born
[2:12:56] as a deliverer you are not a pharaoh
[2:12:59] and moses yes though it was intellectual
[2:13:01] but it was printed on his heart
[2:13:03] it was imprinted on his heart that even
[2:13:06] in his mystic
[2:13:07] he was trying to do the things of the
[2:13:08] lord he ended up killing but he had in
[2:13:11] him that he know he was a deliverer
[2:13:13] no matter how he went that thing was
[2:13:15] inside him
[2:13:17] that a man planted on him so it was so
[2:13:19] strong that he couldn't take that in for
[2:13:20] moses
[2:13:22] he didn't know how to go about it but
[2:13:23] the lord so the lord called him to the
[2:13:25] back side of the
[2:13:26] desert and gave him what he needed to
[2:13:28] have
[2:13:29] and i said parents let's be like a jokey
[2:13:31] bed plant the seed in your children
[2:13:34] because the word we are in the word is
[2:13:36] just looking for your child
[2:13:38] spirits they are here search on their
[2:13:41] cell phone when they go to school
[2:13:43] practically take their cell phone and
[2:13:44] run through and see what is on their
[2:13:45] cell phone
[2:13:46] protectly take their school bags and
[2:13:49] when they another run through their
[2:13:50] school box
[2:13:51] see what is on the school bag set do a
[2:13:53] search
[2:13:54] because the lord has given that child to
[2:13:56] you as your responsibility
[2:13:58] to raise them like samuel someone was
[2:14:00] raised
[2:14:01] until that time god began to use him he
[2:14:04] didn't know who he was
[2:14:05] he know he was born as a promised child
[2:14:06] be in the house of ally
[2:14:08] but there was a time god began to use
[2:14:10] him so as parents it's
[2:14:12] your responsibility to put whatever you
[2:14:15] need to
[2:14:15] put in a child don't wait to the child
[2:14:17] become an adolescent or teenager i know
[2:14:20] science even said that the smartest time
[2:14:22] a person is when is he or she's three
[2:14:24] years old
[2:14:25] their brain is way up here they absorb
[2:14:27] things
[2:14:28] they see things you don't think they
[2:14:29] know they might not see it verbally
[2:14:32] but it's important in their heart and in
[2:14:34] their mind
[2:14:35] so when you plant the right seed in them
[2:14:39] don't spend time just cooking for them
[2:14:42] and talking to them about school and
[2:14:43] teaching them that is good
[2:14:44] but pray with them if your child is
[2:14:46] sleeping
[2:14:47] you the father or mother wake up go to
[2:14:50] your bedside
[2:14:51] neither and pray for him once he or she
[2:14:53] is sleeping
[2:14:55] that's the word of the lord the lord
[2:14:56] give it for you if you want to write it
[2:14:58] down pray for your children
[2:14:59] when they are even on their bed not only
[2:15:01] when they are going to school every if
[2:15:02] you can do it every day dude every day
[2:15:04] if you work and you think you are busy
[2:15:05] we can find a day that is
[2:15:07] my child when his father sleeping and
[2:15:08] snoring you the mother of father go
[2:15:11] and pray lay your hands on them and pray
[2:15:14] for them
[2:15:15] and have a child and son or child and
[2:15:18] daughter time
[2:15:18] holy spirit whatever you want to dab at
[2:15:20] spiritual time take him out of the place
[2:15:22] and go talk to him
[2:15:23] because when you talk to him away from
[2:15:25] in home it's going to be normal because
[2:15:26] he's used to the home
[2:15:28] don't take it if you've got more than
[2:15:29] one child don't take two of them
[2:15:31] together
[2:15:32] find time let's see if you want to do it
[2:15:33] this month find if you want to even do
[2:15:35] the same thing take this one
[2:15:37] because we have what they call transfer
[2:15:39] of responsibility
[2:15:40] if you take junior and his younger
[2:15:43] sister
[2:15:44] alicia with you when you're talking to
[2:15:46] them junior is thinking you're talking
[2:15:47] to alicia eliza's thinking about talking
[2:15:49] to junior okay it's for you abigail
[2:15:51] it's not for million dollars always for
[2:15:52] you uh linda is not for me
[2:15:54] but then when parents are talking to
[2:15:56] just only one he knows whatever is
[2:15:58] coming from parents coming to her or him
[2:16:00] directly
[2:16:02] and you pray over them wrap up
[2:16:04] scriptures over them
[2:16:05] and don't wait teach them certain things
[2:16:07] you as a parent because certain things
[2:16:09] children don't learn from their parents
[2:16:10] they learn from school
[2:16:12] and all bad friends teach them when they
[2:16:14] get certain to them about themselves
[2:16:17] as a young girl adolescent age coming up
[2:16:19] about how how she was born is part of
[2:16:21] life
[2:16:22] let your child know how she was born let
[2:16:24] your son know how he's born
[2:16:26] but you wait until the lord give you a
[2:16:28] husband or wife
[2:16:29] before you do that you plant that seed
[2:16:30] in him or her that you are a holy child
[2:16:32] the lord has given you to us
[2:16:34] to nurture you is going to use you
[2:16:36] you've got so many bible characters
[2:16:38] so many people your own example your
[2:16:40] experiences you could share with them
[2:16:42] that if you stay with the lord it's a
[2:16:44] blessing
[2:16:46] it's not about worldly materials what
[2:16:48] the materials you can get all of them
[2:16:49] you are never happy people commit
[2:16:50] suicide
[2:16:51] in uh uh stars superstars in movie stars
[2:16:55] and
[2:16:55] sports stars and whatever they take
[2:16:57] their life they've got billions of
[2:16:58] dollars and millions of dollars
[2:17:00] is so dead american president
[2:17:03] it will buy you something but it doesn't
[2:17:05] fulfill their soul their heart
[2:17:08] so teach the children and plant them so
[2:17:10] every month if you can do it every man
[2:17:12] fine
[2:17:12] if you can do it every three month bingo
[2:17:14] whatever it works for you but at least a
[2:17:16] year
[2:17:17] half at least four times of you and one
[2:17:20] on one
[2:17:20] both parents or if one parent talk to
[2:17:23] your child
[2:17:25] about holy ghost about your purpose on
[2:17:28] this earth so when you take them you
[2:17:29] tell them you pray we are praying for
[2:17:30] you
[2:17:31] we want you to pray as the lord just
[2:17:33] like samuel samuel committed
[2:17:35] his her mother his mother committed him
[2:17:36] to the lord in the house of eli
[2:17:38] and the priest told him how to pray so
[2:17:40] someone need to pray
[2:17:42] he was born as a prophet the pill of
[2:17:44] fire showed up
[2:17:46] when he was born but then he has to have
[2:17:48] an experience
[2:17:49] william brown had a pill of fire coming
[2:17:51] to his room when he was born
[2:17:52] but that didn't didn't do him good until
[2:17:55] he has his own experience
[2:17:57] so it doesn't matter how holy and
[2:17:58] righteous your parents are
[2:18:00] you don't automatically become righteous
[2:18:01] because your parents are holy and
[2:18:03] righteous no
[2:18:04] you have to have your own righteousness
[2:18:06] we cannot impart into a children
[2:18:08] that i'm holding my child you have to
[2:18:09] take your own decision so you help the
[2:18:11] child to take the decision even at the
[2:18:12] age of three
[2:18:14] they have the they know things and the
[2:18:16] lord deals with children so when the
[2:18:18] parents bring them
[2:18:19] speak those spiritual ways to them they
[2:18:20] remember it forever i remember my dad
[2:18:22] and my mom used to take me to a park
[2:18:24] and they told me like god has a purpose
[2:18:26] for you
[2:18:28] you the holy ghost is what the lord
[2:18:30] wants god want to use your vessel your
[2:18:31] vest is not for drinking and smoking and
[2:18:34] all the foolishness you see around you
[2:18:36] but you are the temple of the lord i
[2:18:37] didn't understand
[2:18:39] but now it makes sense to me thank god
[2:18:41] thank the lord for my even when you are
[2:18:42] not here
[2:18:43] your children some of us talk about our
[2:18:45] great grandparents parents
[2:18:47] who did certain things for us and god is
[2:18:49] with children
[2:18:50] amen let me use an example me standing
[2:18:53] here at the age of about let's say 10 to
[2:18:54] 12.
[2:18:55] i wasn't born in united states i was
[2:18:56] born in ghana africa
[2:18:58] and i was playing soccer with my friends
[2:19:00] we call it soccer in africa
[2:19:02] and i was wearing a t-shirt with with
[2:19:04] wisconsin was a wisconsin
[2:19:06] at the back and i remember as a red
[2:19:07] t-shirt with white white sleeves
[2:19:10] and i remember i was used to dribble we
[2:19:12] call it dribbling
[2:19:13] and my friends were giving me fans and
[2:19:15] by inspiration
[2:19:16] something told me that you spent part of
[2:19:18] your life in the united states at the
[2:19:20] age of 10
[2:19:20] or 12 between 10 and 12. it wasn't my
[2:19:23] parents
[2:19:24] but that thing was in me and i as i grew
[2:19:27] i knew that i was going to spend part of
[2:19:29] my life in the u.s
[2:19:31] and now as i grew i know that it's more
[2:19:33] about the gospel
[2:19:34] the lord used my natural profession to
[2:19:37] bring me
[2:19:38] here but it's more about the gospel of
[2:19:40] jesus christ
[2:19:41] amen so your children don't think they
[2:19:43] are too young
[2:19:44] the prophets are if they are not too
[2:19:46] young for the devil to use them they are
[2:19:47] not too young
[2:19:48] for the lord to use them when i was in
[2:19:51] texas one parent
[2:19:52] the daughter was around eight years old
[2:19:54] and the brother said brother
[2:19:55] my daughter want to she said she want to
[2:19:57] get baptized but i think she's too young
[2:19:58] she's even got a song i said brother you
[2:20:00] should be thankful to the lord
[2:20:02] she's eight years old he's got a song
[2:20:03] she wants to sing to the lord come on
[2:20:05] let the pastor come let let
[2:20:06] i mean you're gonna baptize your
[2:20:07] daughter and she got baptized so teach
[2:20:10] them about
[2:20:10] don't just feed them don't just give
[2:20:12] them computer games to play
[2:20:14] those things makes their brain work so
[2:20:15] fast but let them read
[2:20:17] read to them their bible tell them bible
[2:20:19] stories pray over them
[2:20:21] and let them also pray sometime let your
[2:20:23] children prove by the meal
[2:20:25] so that they what is in them will come
[2:20:26] out let them recite scriptures
[2:20:29] ask them what the minister preached what
[2:20:30] did they get from it so that you are
[2:20:32] questioning their spiritual mind
[2:20:34] because sometimes we lose those mind on
[2:20:36] fertilize and then the world
[2:20:38] fertilizes for us so we have to be
[2:20:40] proactive
[2:20:41] we have to go ahead of the devil before
[2:20:42] even he would think they already soak in
[2:20:44] jesus christ
[2:20:45] and when they affect the holy ghost send
[2:20:46] them to wherever you want to take them
[2:20:48] to college
[2:20:49] they'll still be the same person there i
[2:20:51] remember parents was telling me that
[2:20:52] until my daughter get the holy ghost
[2:20:54] she's not going to know college no way
[2:20:56] she has to get the holy ghost because i
[2:20:58] know what college can do to her
[2:21:00] so we want the most important thing in
[2:21:01] life you and i know that is the holy
[2:21:03] ghost baptism
[2:21:04] you only be where you are without christ
[2:21:06] so the greatest
[2:21:07] legacy or property that you can give
[2:21:10] back to your children
[2:21:11] it's not houses it's not profession it's
[2:21:14] what
[2:21:15] jesus christ in their heart so we need
[2:21:17] to pray for them
[2:21:18] pray with them and fast with them just
[2:21:21] christianity in their little mind
[2:21:23] it's going to be it's just the word is
[2:21:25] in them and as you
[2:21:26] feed the word the word the lord will
[2:21:28] take over and the time will come
[2:21:30] the holy ghost will manifest himself
[2:21:32] you've done your job the lord will take
[2:21:33] care god bless you
[2:21:43] shall we be on our feet
