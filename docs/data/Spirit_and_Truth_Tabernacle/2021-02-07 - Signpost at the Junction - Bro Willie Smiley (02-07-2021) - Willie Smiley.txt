against the workers of iniquity for they s they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the green earth trust in the lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fed delight thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart commit thy way unto the lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass and he shall bring forth our righteousness as the light and thy judgment as the noonday rest in the lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospers in his way because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass praise the lord i got to think about bill gates when that when i read that praise the lord amen verse 8 cease from anger and forsake wrath fret not thyself in any wise to do evil for evil doers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the lord they shall inherit the earth for yet a little while and the wicked shall shall not be yea thou shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not be but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace the wicked plot of the plotteth against the just and gnashes upon him with it with his teeth the lord shall laugh at him for he seeth that his day is coming the wicked have drawn out the sword and have bent their bow to cast down the poor needy and to slay such as be of upright upright conversation their sword shall enter into their own heart and their bowels shall be broken a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked for the arms of the wicked shall

something this morning to um edify your people and uh we just give you thanks and praise for all things in jesus name amen amen amen amen amen let's just uh open our bibles this morning it's good to be in the house of the lord uh i didn't know if i was gonna make it uh i had to call brother jack i've been under a real attack this week and uh one thing the devil is he's a good adversary i tell you that i'm not one uh i'm like a talker truck i take a licking and keep on ticking but uh i felt like an old talker ready to be put out the pasture uh this week um i did a job and i don't know i just got this cough and when i finished talking to brother jack it seemed like i didn't cough anymore i said man it's just a devil and uh then next thing i know i got hit with vertigo and man if you ever get that there let me tell you something when you can't stand up and everything is spinning that is miserable i had it before i was uh my wife reminded me of it i remember i had it about 20 years ago and brother troy and jack and all of them my father-in-law my mother-in-law lamar came to the hospital uh to see me and i'm sitting in a weird chair they laughed at me all i could do is keep my head like this because if i move it everything was spinning but i contemplated uh i felt like calling brother jack but i said you know what i'd rather be in church than to be sitting home i'm one that you know what when the church door is open i like to be in church i don't know about other folk i got the kind of holy ghost that enjoys being in church i was blessed on wednesday night by listening to brother jack on the internet i like ain't nothing like being right there in the midst right being able to pull on the word of god but i still thank god for these outlets and everything so y'all pray for me y'all pray for me cause i ain't been steady for a few days on my feet but i got the devil whooped i didn't got this far i don't know i just made it to the pulpit now so uh we'll just see how the lord leads us i might i might i told brother troy i said you know what i might need two soldiers to stand up and hold me up but we're gonna we're gonna make it through by the grace of god you know moses got a little weak and two brothers you know cause as long as his hands was up he brother solomon he was getting the victory and his hand went down two anointed brothers got up under him and held him up so if it looked like i need some holding up just come hold me up you know they just have to hold up the brother brandon right amen so you know that's a part you know brother jack been preaching on different things that you're supposed to do that's just a part of it right so let us let us start in the book of acts chapter 2 uh uh verse 1 it says and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and they appeared unto them clothing uh tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak uh with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and there uh were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under the heaven now when this was nosed abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans and how here we every man in his in our own tongue wherein we were born and i'm going to skip some of this clement jack them words up for you real quick uh but it says let's get down to the 11th verse said that the cretes and the arabians were uh we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this and others mark saying these men are full of new wine but peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of judea and all ye that dwell in jerusalem be this known unto you uh and talking to my words for these are not drunk as you suppose uh seeing that this is the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by joelle the prophet joel may the lord add a blessing to his word this morning he may be seated we like to um this morning take from that a little title um signed the signposts at the junction um y'all just kind of bear with me i'm kind of in unfamiliar territory here a little bit i i kind of i'm in my mind i realize i'm having to kind of readjust myself uh uh put myself on the same frequency as uh brother jack and the minister brother here as y'all know we thank god we've we've we're here uh this morning and things is changing uh we we thank god for the privilege of pastoring for just about 23 years but things has changed so with change you know you i've grown and i've learned something you got to kind of be a little bit more spiritual in this hour i've kind of been the guiding force for 23 years but uh now we're working with a a a ministry and brother jack is the pastor and uh we we want to we want to try to make make sure that we're on the same uh frequency as him you know i'm not here to try to prove anything to anybody y'all know me i've known me for a long time i'm not here at any time to prove how much i know uh i'm not in a competition with any other preaching brothers here i don't have a preaching itch like i just said i've been preaching for like 27 some years pastoring for almost 23 years but uh i was i've been kind of just sitting back and just listening you know as you get older you you learn how to you learn how to listen more than you do run in your mouth when you young you run your mouth a lot i remember i remember now y'all pray with me i'm gonna i'm gonna get there this morning you know i i i'm reminded of when i was when i was young and uh maybe in my early 20s and i used to work my uncle he was in his 40s at the time and uh you know he used to be trying to educate me and me and one of my cousins and uh before he he could even get the question now we uh yeah i know i know and one day he told i wish i'd just shut up he said because y'all got the answer before y'all even know what the question is and a lot of times that that's what the thing that you find with people they think they have the answers don't really fully understand the question yet but they got the answer and so you know just listening to the different brethren over the last couple of weeks i just kind of been uh inspired i thought i'd go a different way but maybe we'd go that way the next time by the grace of god uh but as i was studying i had to call brother jack to find out how far he was going uh into his junction sermons because i didn't want to get in the way because i want to hear everything that god has has inspired him to minister and he said he's preaching on the seven junctions so i said well i'll just kind of stay behind him and uh uh preach from you know what he leaves you know and as you know just as i was studying it's been some things i just know by memory and some things that you know i have to go back and restart it's been a long time since i've even uh uh read the junction of time but i i went back and i was just kind of um studying it uh on the junction of time um you know just like you say just following the inspiration of the holy spirit and and you know just thinking about just all of the things that i've heard from brother troy even with the meetings and brother jack and just a little inspiration just kind of even um struck my heart um um you know anybody that knows me and the saints that kind of came up with me the last few years you know i'm i enjoy good worship services and and all of that i've said that here several times but but what i i i do believe from from my uh perspective we we we lack spiritual understanding right we we really do as as uh church not i'm not gonna dis-christianize anybody this morning that's not that's not what i'm here to do uh because we we all realize we all gotta grow and we we gotta mature right but i still think that we we we lack spiritual understanding and as i was as i was studying it was like the holy spirit started just really dealing with me like i say there's a lot of things that i know by preaching 2 000 and some messages over years but even in that you know you can go back and and and still learn more because this is uh inexhaustible gospel right just when you think you know something god can still show you some things is that right and then and sometimes it ain't even in that sometimes you know god wants to just take us back to different things because you know a lot of times this is what we do we come to church we hear a good sermon we shout we go home and we never really sit down and ponder to really get the gist the meaning why why was this sermon inspired why was this series inspired why did why did god put this on the minister the pastor these great men of god why we we don't we just kind of go home you know we go outside and then like i say i'm not criticizing anybody so so don't quit on me i'm ready i'm getting started i'm starting to feel something now but we we go outside and and we we just get excited to see each other and and and that's for a lot of of us that's it to next church time because sometimes we don't pick up our bibles no more [Music] that's right we we don't take the time to get in the atmosphere with god and and allow god to really after the sermon to really minister minister speaking to our our hearts speaking to our condition is that right and so as i was studying even for me the holy spirit just kind of dropped what does what does this this this sermon really mean to you right because one of the things i find um when we when you look at this this acts chapter 2 something was going on something was going on scripture was actually being fulfilled prophecy was being fulfilled and and and you know uh no doubt religious men right religious men church-going folk everything was right in the midst right watching what was transpiring but they were oblivious to what was actually happening right they just you know like they said you man these guys just drunk they were drunk they were drunk but not like they suppose right they didn't see here's the thing they didn't know the real meaning of what was actually taking place they had their opinion right right they're called opinions but they didn't actually understand what was taking place so they said what mean if this right what what mean is this religious people probably smart men and you know disciples who aren't weren't really smart men or anything you know but but um like they said this is that which was prophesied to take place right and as i was thinking about that i said to myself you know that that's so true that that's so true that a man can be inspired right like our messenger right like the ministry under the son of man ministry right can be so inspired to preach us a message right but we don't really comprehend the depth right what it what it really means yes right you know brother jack was and brother jack was talking about a new beginning this is a new time this this is and then i believe that in this season we need to sit back and and be more observant sit back and be more spiritual take these messages that's being preached and get in your corner and allow god to amen reveal show give us the depth amen of what's being preached what's being said and why right this this is not just a group of men just just throwing off and things of that nature well you know that's not see when it's like that it shows me how carnal uh folk are right but these things um they have they have meaning right and in this hour you know like i say as i was studying you know god stopped me okay preacher because you know preachers sometimes we we get to a point where we feel like we we know who and we not not to say what we don't know and what we do know but sometimes i think we get a little bit lifted up and things just kind of pass by us and you know our actions kind of show uh how much we're really is just you know head knowledge and what's really spiritual revelation come on come on because see one thing about me i ain't never impressed about i haven't been around for 30 something years i've heard a lot of message being preached but i'm not impressed by that anymore right praise god didn't that brother break bread then he tied magog in the and get this dead in the oven that stuff don't impress me anymore what impresses me is what we live amen uh after what's been preached that's the most impressive if we can you know lead us pulpit and become humble because i've known men to preach the gospel and then you can't even hardly you can't even hardly shake their hand i remember years and years ago uh we we none of us wasn't we weren't preachers back then we weren't even married back then uh me and brother jack we we went to a convention and uh you know we was getting ready to go on this little boat ride i don't know brother jack remember this but uh uh i looked up and saw some ministers and i'm you know i'm green i've just been saved you know a few years and hey god bless you brother so-and-so jack was like brother you ain't supposed to ban you no no don't do that you ain't supposed to uh speak to the ministers now you know i kind of grew up the rough side of the mountain you know look at jack like who they amen if they if they really got in me and you know they they want to come down and shake your hand and be in your midst and and all that you know and i know you know brother battle talked about the pastor i'm finna strike something right quick you know brother jack can't come to everybody's house he can't spend all his time with everybody he got to give his time to spiritual things i know that there's times when you know uh he'll come to your house and definitely eat your grocery but but you know don't don't be offended if if brother jack you know ain't always in your face because one thing about the church you know when i was we were in okeechobee that tell you you only see me at church time if you invite me to a fellowship and that was it now i'm off i'm out taz for a minute but this is who i am right i ain't always going to be brother capers for 23 years him and sister capers and i thank god for them they always been in my right hand uh um i've always lived no further maybe five minutes now probably about three minutes but i guarantee you they could tell you in 20-something years how many times i came to their house and they were never offended if they invited me i came other than that i didn't come why because i don't want to get that close to you where i can't preach to you i love y'all but i ain't gonna get that close to y'all where i can't preach to you while i'm here yes sir is that right so so you know uh uh give give the ministry a break right brother jack eight ain't been to your house well he might get there for the rapture and he might not [Laughter] he may not but it's all good you see this is this is where this is where i'm going some of y'all think i'm crazy when i'm talking but you got to follow me this is where his teaching comes into play right because he's been teaching on on positions and placing and things of that nature y'all still with me come on you you gotta understand the pastoral ministry right and when you understand his role then you just sit back and pray for him you like it's all good it's fine i know he's somewhere praying for me i know he's somewhere studying to bring me something that'll feed me uh spiritually right okay let's kind of maybe move on to get on task because now i ain't i ain't a pastor right now i'm kind of in evangelistic mode so uh out could be everywhere but brother branham in in in the junction of time um uh this is um quote 85. now like i this is all new to me so y'all bear with me and you know i see brother jack had that thing all lined up and this and that but i know that's not me uh jack is has a master's degree in in in computer technology i have no degrees not even a high school diploma but you can't pull that novo don't think cause y'all got these big words y'all smarter than me you get your feelings hurt all right but but watch watch the prophet he says i think this church ought to know truth right i think i if if never if you know listen give give me truth whether it skim me down or not right people don't want truth now you know we living in an age where people want this uh inoffensive type of gospel it really shows you they didn't eat the book all right because when you eat the book y'all know the scripture come on i like i like brother branham he tells i like some of the stories he tell he talks about you know uh how they grew up poor and they had to eat beans and all of this and that and he said man his mama would give him castor oil so he hated it right right says mama told him why i mean if it wasn't like this it wouldn't do you no good see truth truth make you free it's a lot of people that's bound today because they've rejected truth they they think that they're free but they're actually bound right they shall know the truth and the truth makes you free the truth liberates you come on amen not some some passive something that you know in society that we got it now where everything is you know inclusive we want this inclusive and we want to bring all of this stuff in that's not truth it's so contrary to scripture you you see the ministry so broken down and so so watered down now right right this is why it's so important to uh keep brother jack and these brethren in prayer right amen because let me tell you something it's tough preaching to people and then watching people walk out and leave you in a building right and and knowing knowing that you know in your heart you can go back man i've challenged people over 20-some years yeah right go back and listen to what i've preached not don't get caught up in my emotions go back to what i've said by inspiration of the holy spirit now that's wrong then i'm wrong all right all right right glory to god glory to god we want truth don't you just want truth glory to god if you don't want truth you can't be a christian you might could be a church member but you can't be no christian he said i think the church ought to know truth right and and and the sign where we're at right that you won't be slowful [Music] that you that you'll be up and doing that's the difference uh that's the differences will be settled you'll walk like real godly men and women your heart set on christ and don't look into these frostings of the earth cause it's of the devil all these quarrels and wars and stripes look away from them we at the end time see we're at the end time this this these sign posters are indication to us where we are right and and if we're at the end time we don't want to be slow forward there used to be a time church man people couldn't hardly wait to get to church we got the church i'm talking about you'd be you'd be in you'd be sitting in the pews and and and the organists be bumping the pedal and and everybody just sitting there almost on the edge of the seat and and the song leader be trying to get up there and you you'd be like man come on get this thing started my god you could hear folk in the pews they didn't with the you know the pianoists or the organists get the plan and they get the hum and the songs and man let's bring that back in the church [Applause] well we just can't hardly wait to the church doors open for the singing and the shouting and the praising and god why is he wowzy praise the lord i'm here brother jack you ought to stay home with that kind of attitude slow for unconcerned man my god and then we wonder why god can't do that much in the church because we we don't we you know what it used to be a time where man folk used to have meetings i know we got the pandemic now i know that changed everything but even before this pandemic thing hit right man people just slowed down folks slowed down you used to have uh uh youth meetings and many young people on fire couldn't hardly wait come on that's right brother amen that's right where the young people that that's encouraging past the west it's time to have something for us amen glory to god things has changed right things see these things have got to be identified right right because if not we're just kind of sitting in church and you know the seat of doing nothing and you know relaxed and that's not the kind of atmosphere that we want to you know come to church in right amen i want to come in amen excited about the things of god the devil thought he'd keep me out of church this morning but the devil's lied i was in a fight head spinning body spinning i said but i'm going i know my wife she was all concerned and all of this and like don't be concerned about be concerned but i'm going to church praise the lord i'm going to church now i set out wins because of the devil right i'm like and you know i'm concerned about everybody you know but man i got i got a good man i'm not sitting up in here another another service i got to be stressed out right but but you say well where you going i'm i'm i'm bringing us to a place where we could see where we at that's right right let me tell you something i know a lot of people have backslidden and and things of that nature has criticized this and criticized that i'm going to tell you something i thank god that god sent us a man a prophet right you you say why why why do you say that because i wouldn't be able to see or understand how important scripture is to me in this hour amen right amen right and the emphasis that he placed on certain scripture right you know jack been preaching on the junctions and and uh identifying try showing us okay the days of life yeah yeah and you know we we intellectually we know these things but the real reality right right the real reality of that scripture and what what being here means to us all right yeah right seeing seeing the the scriptures pertaining to knowing a lot what does that mean to me it's an individual thing come on there's a lot of us up in here yeah but but what does that mean to me right right if if you're traveling you know and we've been we've been you know on a journey spiritual journey is that right glory to god yeah and and you know uh it's something about traveling you know i've been i'm remembered as a kid especially you traveling with kids and as they go on they're alone one of the things they always actually i was there yet yes sir that's it no baby eat this piece of chicken you know drink this kool-aid you know that's what we had you know when i was coming up now my kids they were fortunate but when i was coming up we weren't stopping off in little five hotels and eating buffets and and and all of that now when we were going to new jersey from florida we were driving straight through straight through the night everything else you stop to go to the bathroom hotel huh when he had no money my mommy had that kind of money when my mama told me how much money she raised us when i was like how twelve thousand dollars a year try that now you'd be out there in the soup line somewhere but but you know that's the questions but but the driver the thing that he's looking at he's looking at these signposts right right and and what what does these things mean right you know uh if you have a traveled you know from florida like i say going up north and especially once you get to a certain place in south carolina uh you start seeing these signs for um what was it going into north carolina uh huh that's not yiha south of the border you see all of these suffer the border so many miles right yeah and it just kind of puts you under an anticipation that's good right boy they had south of the border built up they had it built oh lord you get to seeing all those signs and south of the border south of the border so many miles suffer the border right you you see this sign this junction side south of the border man when you get to north carolina when they say one mile boy look at here you'll be like i've arrived you ain't really arriving much of nothing but they had it built up right they had it built up like they put you under this man stay anticipation there right you see what's our expectancy you know we we're seeing the the the signs right we're seeing the junction sign right then what's our perspective right what what are we looking for we're we're here we're not coming right right this day descriptions is being fulfilled amen right come on amen come on and if that's the case what are we looking what does that mean to you [Applause] all right well praise the lord i went to church i went to church today glory to god hallelujah you're not getting it you're not getting it if that's your attitude this morning you're not getting it now y'all don't quit i i you know sometimes the folk get to i'm not i'm just here to show her something see something has got to change in us come on now i've been around a good while now something in all of us something has a switch has got to go off right these things are not coming they're here then if they're here we got to be looking forward to something else right the best is yet to come right see when when you know we could look out and and it's so important let me tell you something these these truths these scriptures these the prophecy of things and brother jack putting up you know prophecies from the prophet about that woman and all of these different things these aren't things just to be put up to just say praise the lord you know glory to god the prophet was right and and all of that if he was a prophet of course listen uh if he was a godsend mouthpiece he's got to be right right but what is the spiritual significance what is what is it trying to show us right yes sir hey man it's trying to a man show us okay it's time to get down to business if you hadn't been down to business have you kind of been hitting and missing and you know yeah i'm here this week and i ain't there for three weeks and all of that that shows me amen you don't know what's happening right that's right these sign posters are here for your benefit so that you can identify the season the time praise the lord glory to god brother jack just preached on the seven junctions but what does that mean right it means to take stop really take a big deep breath and look at yourself right and make sure that you know you in the right head space come on church come on church everything is right i'm i'm i'm living you know every moment i'm i'm living for the coming of the lord right you know man i'm just let let it fly this morning you know because you you you preach and we you know we excited and we're this and with that and it's like come on church this thing is deeper than this people are on the fence right that's right people are on the fence one word from the pastor and i'm quitting really really right you quit right one word it just shows you one a true believer right it showed you you probably were just a bastard to start with hey cause because a son a son takes chastisement you know you you got folks on the fence little things you know i i've just been listening to brother jack you know like i say and and the these the little things that you know we probably a little nail polish and a little dish you mean to tell me you willing to sacrifice your soul come on now some of the things that we're willing to walk away from god my god praise god amen well i ain't got no boyfriend maybe you ain't ready for no boyfriend i ain't got no girlfriend maybe you ain't even ready for no girlfriend all right god ain't gonna give you something you ain't ready for amen why god gonna give you something you can't handle come on all right huh come on something that'll throw you off if it don't work y'all gotta talk to me up in here your spirit all told you can't hardly function now cause y'all you you and what you thought i went through that but god kept me amen huh amen and god put me in a position you know and when i met my wife you know i still wasn't even in a position all right right all right and and and things happen and sister bros don't mind if i tell this uh they what she wasn't just like okay you know you could have uh um she don't mind me telling that she was a real mother though all right all right huh yeah she was like buddy you gonna have the biggest diamond on her finger biggest south florida huh all right but you ain't getting it down the aisle just like that amen certain things has got to be lined up that's right right and and you know what when when things got lined up yes sir now y'all pray for me because i've been emotional all week too then god came on the scene and made a way see people people people we want god to show up but we lined up with his word we line up young people ain't lined up we want all of this from god but some folk don't even have a baptism by the holy ghost yet that's right come on some folk are just religious come on now amen people need the baptism of the we you know what we don't got too deep now that way we ain't got to preach the baptism of the holy ghost that's why we losing people [Applause] because people ain't got the baptism of the holy ghost amen and without the baptism of the holy ghost you ain't gonna make it in the natural or the spiritual or you might do okay in the natural but you'll be eternally separated from god amen people people need the baptism of the holy ghost um injection of time it says and so today i believe that we're facing a great something that the church should know and understand right that we ought to know what all this is about right i'ma stop here right for a second see it's not brother jack is not just trying to be smart it's not that these brethren um are just trying to be smart and just trying to uh show you man how much knowledge right but they're trying to bring us an understanding things that that will help us in in our everyday life naturally and spiritually [Music] right amen glory to god but folk you know i was a young person and i didn't want to listen come on but that was not smart on my my behalf right i i i would be further up the road if i was humble enough to just listen to people that had a little bit more understanding about life than what i had come when you young you don't know nothing i'ma tell you that i'm 58 years old and i'm still learning so i know if you 20 you don't know nothing you think being hugged up with a boy and laying up and and dropping it and on these these social medias with your backside all loud and all that kind of stuff it's the indication you don't know that you don't understand the spirit that's on you and god will judge you for that [Applause] take it easy brother smiley okay you're gonna offend them they ain't coming back if they're part of god they're gonna be back one way or the other ain't worried about that glory well brother smiley they've been to church for so long and they come in and you hit that no you know what i ain't know what i was gonna say i'll do when i got here but listen listen anything i say i say in love right and if you don't take it in love you'll leave here offended right but i'm going to help you out the bible said blessed is he that's not offended in me and he's the word as a believer you cannot be offended at the word how much time i got i don't even know when i started right you cannot be offended at the word right it's god trying to get your attention we're here we see this signpost yes right amen right we are here we're not coming then it's now right what what was back then we see it now right as it was in the days of noah as it was in the days a lot we could see them spirits they ain't coming they here right so don't don't leave offended you know anything i say i'm saying it in love you know god's just trying to get your attention see one thing about god god is long belong suffering right because see the re reality is is this right the sovereignty of god is that nobody will be lost so so god has been patient but after a while his pace is gonna run out see after a while god got to say well see brother brother says it like this he said when that last predestinated seeds come in then we'll go and so while the doors open get in right hey man you know here's here's something to think about right i think brother jack hit it though last week just just think about something we're the highest uh form of intelligence that there is right but think about what got in the ark we so smart people were so smart the scientists of that day they were so smart brother brother said they could prove that boy it ain't gonna rain they could shoot sputniks up there and they could prove we ain't never heard of rain how is this gonna be this that any other salt through intelligence but hey man no i'll just say it's gonna rain i ain't here i ain't here to try to figure it out i'm just here to preach it it ain't gonna rain i mean it's gonna rain right right and the highest form of intelligence wouldn't get in after hearing the message preach oh they walked away from the message listen they walked away from the message in the days of noah come on now huh wow but two animals two by two male and female they walked in together all of these smart people wow till that day that that god that god told noah to go in and then god shut the door huh after a while god is gonna shut the door [Applause] right if he did it before he's gonna do it again there's going to come a time where where the the thing is going to switch the gospel is going to go to the jews amen come on and brother brown says this he says people are going to be going to the altar thinking folks souls getting saved that's right it's going to be overweight for the gentiles did he say that didn't i say it huh come on this is the day of grace well i i'm just in church today no you ain't just in church you got to understand why god brought you here and as beat up as i was amen this week i couldn't stay home that i had to be the one to preach when you came here this morning [Music] it couldn't have been brother jack it couldn't have been brother troy it couldn't have been brother keku i got to get his name right hey cool i'll mess up your name now y'all right it had to be brother smiling why hey man why because they they built different than me and god know what he inspired amen glory to god well i'mma be in church today is deeper than that this could be listen let me tell you how deep this is today could be your last time hearing a message preach today god could say if you walk away from this day and turn me down today i ain't dealing with you no more and god gonna be just judge you at that day because he's giving you an opportunity hey preach to god glory to god come on come on come on we'll praise the lord that's his brother smiley okay just brother smiley all right keep thinking that they sang this song his voice is in his bride huh come on see we we say things we say things with no real meaning what does that mean right god's voice is in his bride and god speaking and then you just turn down god see it makes it difficult to leave this church and say you know what i'm man that was brother smiley i ain't coming back no more all right gonna meet you there come on now that's right but brother smiley ain't ready that's between you and your god i'm just preaching this morning i i i i ain't even nowhere where i thought i'd go huh sometimes god does that because god just really want to just speak to our speak to our heart i got about 10 15 more minutes because i don't know when i y'all just weigh the white flag when y'all get tired i'm a part of y'all now so i ain't going nowhere [Applause] it ain't like before you know i come in and preach and then i go back to okeechobee y'all gonna see me on wednesday y'all gonna see me on sundays not unless i'm out preaching i'ma be here and i ain't afraid to look you in your face and say god bless you praise the lord i ain't one of them i ain't scared i hug your neck and buy you some chicken laugh with you but when it comes down to this pulpit i ain't gonna play with you guarantee you that amen i'm a kind loving guy but when it comes to the gospel you know yo i see one thing about it let me get the blood up off my hand bro jack right so so he says i believe that we are facing a great something that the church should know and understand that we ought to know what this is all about and find it in god's word i believe that if it's in his word i'm just a little doubt if okay if it isn't in the word i'm just a little doubtful of it but if god's word speaks of it then god uh no matter how indifferent it might seem to our customs and teaching right it's god working out his word many times it's contrary to our way of thinking uh may be the way that we have been taught to think but we have to recognize the omnipotence of god when it's performed before us see and this this is the thing that i think that have thrown so many people off over the years right is that you know and i think we can all say man to this this message has been all together beyond anything that we thought when we were in denomination and things of that nature come on come on it's just you know just the depth of it you you realize man i didn't even really know the bible right right i knew the letter maybe i could probably quote a few scriptures but but this this thing make the scripture alive more more real right glory to god because in denomination let's stop here for a second who even preached malachi 4. huh amen who preached malachi 4. luke 17 30. come on who who preached it right i had baptist preachers in the family pentecostal never heard none of them preaching malachi 4. right a ministry to forerun the coming world we never heard that you never heard outside of amen uh the message right really laying emphasis luke 17 30. right we we never heard these types of things before it's it's been something that's been beyond our thinking right you know when i was coming up man i went to church to be honest with you i went to church for the choirs because everywhere i went we always had i met every church when i went to church in jersey man or down here greater bethel they always had jumping choirs i went to a funeral a couple of weeks ago a friend of mine and i went up to the old church that i came came out of they still jumping they still jumping i said greg got everybody i've been gone about 40 years and they still but i realized i realized something that will produce a faith for change come on now see and and this so that we see you you you just got to place things in there in the in the spirits of people so so so that when when you hear the pastor come up and preach you you ride with him you you you you're like lord i i really want to understand i really want to you know sit and ponder the sermon i i want to absorb and get everything out of it right because em everything is beneficial right you can't come to church and be a finicky eater [Applause] well he was all right over here but when he got over there i mean i couldn't eat that come on right but like the quote said if it's by the word right what you gonna do with this jesus called the christ you can't wash it off oh y'all think y'all gonna walk out here and watch this off you ain't gonna watch this off let's go ride with you a sermon like this here you know it'll go to bed with you it'll go to work with you huh it'll make you want to line your life up with god come on see you know what it was just kind of preaching that really done something for me right all right glory to god you know i remember them brother west coast back in the day what about west coast he got older you know he changed a little bit but i remember when we were but west coast didn't play bro brother jack is is the younger brother west coast y'all want to know what brother what's goal is like just right there we we just kind of we kind of chip off the old block you know i changed a little bit but jack a little younger than me you know so but give me two minutes and i'mma close i feel good this morning i know y'all quiet y'all thought that boy my brother smiley gonna come out here we're gonna be standing on the chairs all right well evidently y'all don't really know brother smiley that well i i like the labor in the word of god i'm i'm finding my foot in footing right now but uh i like that that's that's all i'm i'm just finding my footing you know it's a little different but you know i do understand ministry i i understand the gift how god used me sometimes i can go down the line and and uh sometimes i just look i enjoy just letting god use me to speak talk to the hearts of the people let's let's leave here with this i'm gonna get out of here don't be offended i'm not here to offend anybody right but to caution us you gotta understand what these things mean right right for you if we're here this morning and we see all of these signposts it's an indication that man we're entering listen we we may not we may not comprehend this but i comprehend this right we know that the message brought us into something new right a fulfillment of scripture the son of man ministry we've been elevated into the head right and and i believe through a process and feeding on the word that there's a rapture that's taking place that's right if y'all can't say amen to that see you're missing something there's there's a rapture that's taking place right now this morning right i'm being changed you're being changed service after service you being changed see brother jack bring things that change the way that you think to change your attitude right we're transitioning we're moving into something listen why because we there's a there's a wedding supper hey man we can't just stay here and just fight demons and right we sit around wearing masks and and all of his man we're moving into something far better praise the lord see w when i when i see all of this you know we spent 20 20 and i'm gonna i'm gonna go we spent twenty twenty man to cover this man that covered that and this is an alien guy said stop a minute stop one minute stop griping stop complaining what does this really mean though right brother brother said the thing will get worse and worse this is the best that it's going to be this side of the rapture we could say that every week amen huh this is the best that it's going to be right it's it's going to take what it's going to take to push us out of here cause we talk like we're ready to go but we really ain't ready to go amen maybe the next epidemic could do the trick y'all all to preach with me now come on oh don't say that brother smiley we don't know what these folk gonna do but every time something happens we gotta look at it from the standpoint of the world right if this is happening it's only a signpost this thing is almost over we we can see we we at the end and if we had to end what's next right glory to god man i don't just want to talk about a rapture like we've talked about for 30 something years i've been a christian since 1988 and i thought that man you know what when i first got saved that uh we'd been gone i never thought about getting married i never thought about having children i haven't been married 20-something years my kids are grown huh i got i got one i have two teenagers but nathan 19 and kevin's 17. i mean they were babies huh when i saw that pastor and william was a baby christina wasn't even born i remember justin with a sippy cup on the front row that boy never sat in the back of a church and had to dress up in a suit and ties with master didn't match huh they grown nobody could i thought we'd have been gone huh it's the truth i've seen some of y'all kids when they were little babies now they grown with babies right so everything everything that i see now you know i i i try not to let it affect me and get nervous about it it's like you know what this has been prophesied to come and it's here and that's listen that's the only reason it's here because it's been spoken about by inspiration brother branham talked about these types of warfares and all of that in the 60s right when people thought he was crazy that's right huh the prophecy came to him about the woman and the purple and the pearls and all of that right we're here we ain't coming we're here we can mark that off that is taking place that means we're just that much closer to something new right to something new i'm looking forward to i'm looking i'm looking forward to it church i'm i'm looking forward to a time where we we ain't gonna be no struggles no back biting no evil surmising no you know they don't left the message and nadine ah man please it won't be none of that over there everybody that'll be over there will be people who want to be over there amen is that right amen i i just got to a point it's like man i can't fight with people no more i'ma just preach the word of god and go on to the house and because that's all you can do and lead the rest up to god [Applause] pray for that's folks i ain't mad at the young people amen i lived in the world come on dad well you don't understand where you been you ain't heard my testimony right let me say this let me get on out of here let me use this to make they will appear let me let me let every young person in here know something ain't nothing y'all done at doing brother smiley ain't done brother jack might not have done some of the things that i've done but he ain't ignorant all right but when it comes to running the streets going to clubs dancing all night drunk sloppy drunk can't hardly drive home throwing it all up in your people house and all that all i did all that right it ain't nothing to it let me tell you something this has been the greatest let the musicians with music y'all come on i ain't gonna bother you the dog's gonna stop barking now i know like don't get nervous like boy he's still i better not no i'm gonna go this has been the best life amen uh man i've done things i've met people i've gone places i never could have imagined you know i've i've i've been faced with with a lot over the last few years but i'm still determined to push push forward continue to preach the word of god and just just be a a asset here at spirit and truth and uh we could all go home together in the rapture but like i say you know i'ma say this since this my my first sermon uh preaching and i mentioned this uh a couple of weeks ago um don't think that you're gonna be able to use me uh against brother jack because you're not me and brother jack been tight since i got saved me and brother jack rolled over in a car together that's how close me and brother jack is you know you got to be close with a person you roll over with him i had this hand cut up and and he had this hand cut i believe that god bonded us 30 something years ago and uh you're not gonna be able to break that bond come on tell you about brother jack no what you want to say come on let's go talk to him shame on a sister that'll let somebody talk about your husband [Music] come on well well y'all should never let nobody talk about y'all passed out nick can i can i okay oh come on let's go talk to him then you'll stop all this foolishness you'll stop all this foolishness but uh i appreciate the lord this morning you know i'm grateful that god gave me enough strength to be able to come up here i ain't even know i was gonna make it my wheels was a little unsteady but i feel steady right now i feel i feel like my old self and you know we'll find we'll find some footing um and uh we'll we'll maybe next time y'all will be able to stand on the chandeliers but i guess this one the chandelier standing on message today i didn't get where i wanted to go uh but uh you know my my role has changed and uh he just kind of do the lead and i'm doing the following and and i'm gonna be i'm all right with that i've always told the church if if i had to go anywhere and sit down under anybody or be brother jack because one thing i've learned about him he's he's honest he's he's true he has not changed one eye older since the day we've met when it comes down to this word you know i think he softened up a little bit though because boy tina's tina's like this here just a little the boy jack was when when we were teenagers now you had to grow up with us all of us old old uh that come out of brother west coast we was all the youth group and all that jack was rough check with i'm tough duff i don't empathize i don't sympathize i don't oh my god but i tell you what god i just i just really thank god for him and and and i respect what he's doing in his leadership and i'm encouraged i feel like um we're in the right place at the right time and uh we we i tell you what i bought some soldiers with me now i i bought some real soldiers and uh some good some good folk that understand ministry and and all of that and and uh i'm i'm glad to be here and y'all just continue to pray for me and and uh that god will just kind of direct me um and show me what he want me to do my son called me uh william he called me a lot more than what he used to and uh we was chatting he said well dad maybe you get a chance to get out i'm like man son i ain't as young as i used to be somebody evangelized and i'll go as much as god allowed me to go but it's like man i ain't no spring chicken that's a young man gang you know i'm almost ready to collect a social security check you talking about hopping on a plane and and but uh yeah i just y'all just pray for me um that god will direct me and wherever god uh uh lead me i'll follow you know my whole objective is just to be a blessing um the gift like brother brown says for the people so y'all y'all just continue to pray for us and we'll we'll turn it back over to uh brother jack let's let's let's anybody need any prayer while we while we're here we still believe in praying for the sick amen good to see sister wayson that's my that's my big sister and uh she's just always been that it and encouraged encouraged me over the years and it's good to see her i was kind of frustrated at the devil he had her well she couldn't come to church for a little while but uh it's good to have her in the services amen amen amen how about you brother heavenly father we just thank you we praise your god we still believe in the power of prayer lord the brother say appreciate what you're allowed to be said this morning he's encouraged he want to be a man uh to strengthen his union with his wife lord god and you know that's that's even my my heart's desire father god and uh we just give them thanks and praise appreciate them being in the area lord god and putting their shoulders to the wheel lord god and we just appreciate them father god continue to bless them lord we ask these other prayers and blessings in jesus name amen amen amen amen amen amen god bless everybody just continue to keep me in prayer [Applause] [Music] the lord uh thank god for brother smiley had known today and um i think um there was a lot said and a lot done here before us and um i i learned a long time ago that if uh you're gonna be a good leader you have to be a good follower and um and you know brother smiley reached out to me you know when we're talking about jackson about the the you know upcoming service and he says uh just wanting to know where i was where i was you know on some some things and we say uh um i didn't know which way he was gonna go but this thing was that he just wanted to kind of get into the same channel and uh that says a lot it says an awful lot you know and um i believe that god has united us all for this season for this time for a very specific purpose and um and i don't think we even understand the magnitude of what god is getting ready to do i don't think we really understand it uh but today you know just for my for myself even just sitting back and listening to the sermon hearing it you know kind of come from a different angle um i'm leaving here with a um just a self-examination you know what does what does these signposts the days of noah the days of lot and and the scripture you know jesus prophesied and the thing about is that uh both things that happened in scripture what happened in days of noah was going to happen today what happened in the days of lot was going to happen today both things would come at together at the same time so uh when we see these things the question is what does that mean to you what does it mean to you it's one thing to just have head knowledge and say lord i see it and that's the prophet said this the prophet said that the bible say this bible said it it's good to have head knowledge but if it's not changing us from the inside then we're missing what is really happening uh if if we don't draw closer to the lord jesus during this time when are we gonna draw closer to him church i'll tell you um i think it ties into our lesson in ephesians 3 paul the prison of christ and i'm telling you i want to be a prisoner to the lord jesus christ i want to be prisoner to his will prisoner to his way prisoner to whatever he desires for me to do i want to be a prisoner to that so i thank god for the word today and i'm i'm leaving here meditating on that lord what does this mean to me what do you want to do in me uh in this season i want to draw closer to you amen amen praise the lord i i i think that's a real good song but i just uh i don't know it so i'm gonna let you sing it okay all right let me get you a different mic [Music] here of course [Music] i'm turning away from the things that i do that i know aren't pleasing in your sight i'm turning away from the messed up mindset and the things that i know aren't right i'm turning away from the past the heart and shame all the things that had me bound [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] in your sight i'm turning away from the messed up mindset and the things that i know aren't right i'm turning away from the past the hurt [Music] [Applause] i'm turning away i'm turning away from the things that i do that i know are pleasing in your sights i'm turning away from the mess of mindset and the things that i know aren't right i'm turning away from the past the hurt and shame all the things that had me bound i'm turning away i'm turning away [Music] i'm turning away i'm made up my mind i'm not going back no i'm turning away i'm turning away i'm turning away i'm turning away from the things that i do that i know aren't pleasing in your sight i'm turning away from the messed up mindset and the things that i know i'm right i'm turning away from the past the hurt and shame all the things that had me bound turning away i'm turning away i'm turning away from the past the hurt and shame all the things that had me bound i'm turning away i'm turning away i'm turning away from the past the hurt and shame all the things that had me bound i'm turning away i'm turning away praise the lord i pray that that's not just a song that we see but i pray it becomes um i pray that it becomes a real testimony in our lives that on february 7 2021 i drill a stake down and turned away from the life i used to live i left church with the determination that i was gonna live for the lord don't let it just be another good song that sung but let it become part of your life the bible tells us in john 5 and 24 just verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life though sometimes we might not come to the altar here in the front of the church but there's an altar in your heart that's the most important altar that you can come to that's where you surrender you all to the lord jesus [Music] and i want to encourage you today as brother smiley told us he said he said today somebody might hear the gospel for the last time and god would be just to judge you for rejecting him because he gave you an opportunity to receive him today before we leave this place i want to offer another opportunity for someone to just surrender to the lord i'm not going to invite you to come to the altar but in your heart right where you're sitting i want to invite you to surrender to the lord jesus [Music] every head bowed and every eye closed let's just have a word of prayer dear god we feel your anointing here we feel your spirit here we've heard the word of god as it has come forth from the throne of god to us lord and it's not by accident it's not by chance that you had a brother smiley to speak what he spoke today and all the things that he went through this week just to press him to the house of god to bring the word of god lord in the anointing to come after amen the the sermon shows us that you were pleased with what was spoken god if there is one here that does not know you in the part understand if there's one listing even through the stream god that does not know your department of sin i pray that you would bring them to a place of conviction even right now that they would surrender their all to you god lord that they would turn away from the messed up mindset that they would turn away from the things that have had them bound that they would turn away from whatever it is that the devil's trying to keep them uh bound to god that they would turn away and become prisoners to the lord jesus christ father i prayed lord that your word may be manifested in their hearts you said if they would just believe if they hear and believe you god you would grant them everlasting life father i believe you give them strength to walk right [Music] i believe you give them strength to talk right lord i beg i believe you give them strength to live right if they'll just surrender everything to you right now in this moment fathers they ask you for forgiveness as they ask you lord to lord to uh they just repent before your presence and they actually god lord to overlook all their faults and their failures and to wash them clean in the blood as they ask you that god i pray that you would hear the cry of their heart [Applause] let a stake be driven down today god february 7 2021 i drove my stake down i'm i'm turning aways goodbye world i stay no longer with you goodbye pleasures of sin i stay no longer with you i made up my mind to go god's way the rest of my life god let that be somebody's testimony today [Music] we won't rush to leave from this presence [Music] god up there someone just wants to sit and bathe and just think about the words of this song and think about what it really means think about the message that was spoken here today and think about what it really means to them lord let them sit in your presence speak to them god speak to them jesus [Music] bless us as we prepare to leave lord this place but not your presence give us travel and mercies as we go we'll look upon uh my wife and my daughter as they
