[11:04] have to a man be hungry for the things
[11:07] of God a man if we're going to get into
[11:10] a little bit if we can now turn our
[11:13] Bibles there in Hebrews the seventh
[11:15] chapter we've been working in that and
[11:20] and III do things a little different the
[11:23] pastor has a really good teaching
[11:26] ability you know he put everything on
[11:29] the slide show and point everything out
[11:31] and that's on that really good is visual
[11:33] you know what I mean it's early but I
[11:35] don't have quite have that ability down
[11:37] yet so I just bring it how I bring it
[11:41] hey man
[11:42] but I just beautiful - wait a lord just
[11:45] kind of laid this upon my heart I wasn't
[11:47] really looking for just going about my
[11:53] daily tasks enough just enjoy last week
[11:56] man other wife got a chance to get away
[11:58] and the Lord just kind of led me to a
[12:03] number of messages that I were listening
[12:05] to and I just kept listening to this
[12:07] message over and over and over not
[12:10] knowing why then I went back and I began
[12:14] to study for this this uh this evening
[12:19] and as I read into I said will allow us
[12:22] see how he had been preparing all the
[12:23] time because everything just sort of
[12:25] fell into place so I trust that from the
[12:31] depths of my heart that I'm able to
[12:33] relay what he put he placed on my heart
[12:36] a man I'm just gonna I don't have a
[12:38] whole lot of notes and things like that
[12:40] you know but we're gonna just kind of
[12:43] walk through the Bible a little bit and
[12:44] just kind of both open up our
[12:46] understanding of the scripture just a
[12:48] little bit on these things and enlighten
[12:51] us and give us a little strength for the
[12:53] journey
[12:53] amen amen we've got a read from Hebrews
[12:58] - at a seventh chapter we notice paths
[13:02] have been working in this year for the
[13:04] past cup
[13:05] a couple of weeks a man but uh let's see
[13:08] where we go here it says for this
[13:12] Melchizedek king of Salem priest of the
[13:16] Most High God who met Abraham returning
[13:19] from the slaughter of the Kings and
[13:22] blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a
[13:27] tenth part of all first being by
[13:32] interpretation king of righteousness and
[13:37] after that also king of Salem which is
[13:41] king of peace without father without
[13:45] mother without descent having neither
[13:49] beginning of days nor ending of life but
[13:53] was made like unto the Son of God
[13:56] abideth a priest continually now we know
[14:02] who that was he created God created a
[14:05] body a man now consider how great this
[14:10] man was on to whom even the patriarch
[14:13] Abraham gave a tenth of the Spoils and
[14:18] verily they that are the sons of Levi
[14:22] who received the office of the
[14:26] priesthood have a commandment to take
[14:30] tithes of the people according to the
[14:34] law that is of their brethren though
[14:39] they come out of the loins of Abraham
[14:44] but he who descent is not counted from
[14:50] from them receiveth the tithes of
[14:53] Abraham and blessed him that had the
[14:56] promise and without all contradiction
[15:00] the less is blessed of the better and
[15:06] here men that die receiveth sighs but
[15:11] there he receiveth them of whom it is
[15:15] witnessed that he liveth
[15:18] and as I may say so Levi also who
[15:22] received sighs pay tithes in Abraham for
[15:28] he was yet in the loins of his father
[15:31] when Melchizedek met him if therefore
[15:35] perfection were by the Levitical
[15:38] priesthood for under it the people
[15:41] received the law what further need was
[15:45] there that another priest should arise
[15:49] after the order of Melchizedek and not
[15:52] be called after the order of Aaron I'm
[15:57] gonna read that again for he was yet in
[16:00] the loins of of his father when don't
[16:03] hesitate met him if therefore profession
[16:07] were by the Levitical priesthood for
[16:12] under it the people received the law for
[16:17] what further need was there that another
[16:22] priest should raise after the order of
[16:25] Melchizedek and not be called after the
[16:29] order of Aaron for the priesthood being
[16:33] changed there is made of necessity to
[16:37] change also of the law for he of who
[16:44] these things are spoken pertain it to
[16:47] another tribe of which no man gives
[16:51] attendance at the altar for it is
[16:56] evident that our Lord spring up out of
[17:00] Judah the tribe of pewter of the tribe
[17:06] Moses spake nothing concerning the
[17:09] priesthood and it is yet for more
[17:12] evident for that after the similitude of
[17:19] Melchizedek there arises another priest
[17:24] I want to concentrate their own
[17:28] fifteenth verse
[17:30] and it is yet for more evidence
[17:34] far more evidence for their after the
[17:38] similitude of melchizedek they arise it
[17:44] another priests Amen let's pray for a
[17:50] quick Lord Heavenly Father we read these
[17:52] scriptures of Lord God made you just
[17:54] give them life Lord God that would open
[17:58] our understanding Oh father God and even
[18:00] our revelation Oh father God and Jesus
[18:03] precious name Amen now we see here I
[18:07] want to bring attention to that world
[18:13] the similitude and similitude and in a
[18:20] dictionary we break that work now and it
[18:22] means a visible likeness it means it one
[18:29] definition is a visible likeness and
[18:31] another it may say an imaginative
[18:34] comparison and another it may say a
[18:39] point of comparison okay but I'd like to
[18:44] just stick with a visible likeness okay
[18:48] so we see that uh so we go back here to
[18:55] assimilate assimilate is the verb of
[19:00] similitude that means something that
[19:03] that is becoming like something else
[19:08] amen so our to to to come into the
[19:12] likeness of another being or spirit
[19:17] should I say now we see that before the
[19:22] foundation of the world here that there
[19:25] was a there was a there was a battle in
[19:27] heaven am i right there was a battle
[19:29] going on there was one who was not
[19:34] at that time Lucifer but he was Sun in
[19:38] the morning a man that and and iniquity
[19:41] had entered into his heart and and he
[19:44] wanted to be like the Most High God so
[19:49] the battle began in heaven and when when
[19:54] when he was cast down there the Bible
[19:58] tells us in Isaiah then that he he had a
[20:02] goal and he had a purpose his goal and
[20:05] his purpose was to be worshipped like
[20:08] the Most High
[20:09] okay thank God in the beginning he
[20:11] created these people to worship Him man
[20:15] he was God and he set things up in the
[20:18] order that he saw things in his mind to
[20:23] play out so that he can display file of
[20:26] his attributes a few years am i right
[20:28] amen so on the other hand now that it
[20:33] talks about how at that time not Lucifer
[20:37] that Satan was a very convincing fellow
[20:44] he was able to convince a third of the
[20:49] Angels a third of the angels to follow
[20:52] him
[20:53] now imagine not my brothers and sisters
[20:56] you have an angel in heaven that is
[20:59] there and they're worshiping the
[21:01] Almighty God and Lucifer is so sick that
[21:06] he can he can he can deceive angels to
[21:11] uni heaven so we're dealing with a
[21:14] shrewd character here we dealing with an
[21:17] individual are what better yesterday a
[21:21] man and he's ahe's he's the most
[21:24] beautiful angel
[21:26] he got all kind of tools in his chest
[21:28] yeah he was a great musician he had he
[21:34] there was nothing ugly about him a man
[21:38] he he was he was anointed cherubim
[21:43] okay so now
[21:45] we understand that the Bible all says
[21:49] you know in the beginning he created the
[21:52] heavens and the earth
[21:54] now the prophet of God said you must
[21:57] understand in your semicolons he said
[22:01] you must understand your semicolons
[22:03] because he when you when you read and it
[22:05] stops now we have no idea how long of a
[22:09] space of time from one event to the
[22:13] other okay so that we know okay he did
[22:17] this and then he did this but in between
[22:20] there's a space of time we don't know
[22:22] how long that was we don't know how long
[22:25] it was but we know that Moses a prophet
[22:30] was able to - to - to foresee and look
[22:34] back in time to be able to write those
[22:39] first four books of the Bible Moses
[22:41] wasn't there but he was able to write
[22:43] those first four books of the Bible
[22:46] okay so some would say that you know
[22:49] Moses was a special prophet because he
[22:53] was the first prophet and I would
[22:55] continue to say if the first prophet was
[22:58] a special prophet then the last prophet
[23:01] should be a special prophet just make
[23:04] sense
[23:05] amen because one was able to look back
[23:07] and seen from the beginning and one
[23:10] things beginning and this last one his
[23:13] job is to come and what tied up all the
[23:15] loose ends and look into the future and
[23:18] tell you and send everything going close
[23:20] everything up we got one who opened it
[23:23] up and that last prophet okay we're
[23:25] going to tie this up in a nice little
[23:26] boat so you can get out of here amen
[23:29] now we see that those angels come down
[23:35] they they had assimilated took all the
[23:40] lightness of Lucifer now we see that
[23:46] Lucifer came down and and there in the
[23:48] Bible there in the beginning he created
[23:51] the heaven and on earth and then he
[23:53] you know all of these things he created
[23:55] the the herb yield and grass and then
[23:57] banging me created all of the animals
[23:59] and he created all of these things he
[24:01] created and he created the other the
[24:03] last thing you created it was me now
[24:06] when he created the animals he created
[24:08] one are the rimmel my kid and he created
[24:11] the female monkey
[24:12] he created a males arriving in the
[24:14] female giraffe he created all these
[24:17] things he created the - so now Satan
[24:20] remember Satan was already cast over so
[24:22] he's just watch he's a man he's gone all
[24:26] of these things I see what he's gone but
[24:29] I came into that now remember he created
[24:31] the serpent as well he created the
[24:34] serpent and this was so big was not a
[24:36] snake at the time he was not something
[24:39] that sliver alone he was a beast the
[24:41] Bible called him a beast that walk
[24:43] upright on two feet I'm all right
[24:45] what up I threw the guard now he gave
[24:49] Adam dominion over everything he told
[24:52] him to name it so I think I'm guessing
[24:54] them Adam Lester came to the circuit and
[24:55] say hello I will call you you two beasts
[24:58] I don't think in Lane with the serpent
[25:00] until a fee was cursed
[25:01] okay mr. surrett how you doing Dada Dada
[25:04] da you got your place and diet and you
[25:06] know he went all through the body he was
[25:08] just like any other animal all the
[25:09] differences he had a place for soul but
[25:11] he didn't have a soul he was the closest
[25:14] thing to bed he was the closest thing to
[25:19] man okay all upright and everything he
[25:24] was able obviously able to communicate
[25:26] okay
[25:28] we see now that some time he still have
[25:30] some animals have some form of being
[25:32] able to communicate
[25:33] I can tell my dog to do certain things
[25:35] and here doing he can't talk back then
[25:38] he seems like he can get my attention
[25:40] every now and then my dog want to be fed
[25:41] he'd know what a certain time you go I
[25:43] start moving that bowl around and my
[25:45] wife said your doll talking to you and
[25:46] say hey I'm gonna go feed him so they
[25:48] have some ability okay so but this
[25:51] serpent uh-uh-uh-uh-uh was the closest
[25:55] thing to mankind so this double sit back
[25:59] watch him and you say well well well how
[26:01] can i oh
[26:02] similarly into this culture because he
[26:05] he was he was just the being a spirit he
[26:07] had no way to get anybody but he's
[26:09] playing like I said it was to be worship
[26:12] like the Most High so he wanted a people
[26:15] to worship him now at the time he didn't
[26:19] happen but that was his goal in
[26:21] displaying all the time that he's the
[26:24] kid of people to worship Him who he said
[26:29] back there watching me say now I noticed
[26:31] that he made the female giraffe in the
[26:33] male giraffe and the Bell had a monkey
[26:35] in the female dog and the male darling
[26:37] is that but I've noticed with his type
[26:39] of man he did something a little bit
[26:41] different he just made one well what's
[26:45] happened here then all of a sudden he'd
[26:47] put that from to sleep and he took
[26:49] something real Adam and any any and any
[26:53] name of a female body took the feminine
[26:56] spirit from Adam and and and gave it to
[26:59] the female so he began to look at this
[27:02] thing and he say wow I might have
[27:04] something here
[27:05] because anything any time that you look
[27:09] at that Satan notices God giving a
[27:12] certain thing just a little more
[27:14] attention
[27:15] oh he pays really close attention today
[27:19] he pays very close attention to you
[27:22] because he said what I have this fellow
[27:25] in the part of my hand I had this person
[27:28] in my will my head of day he was down
[27:32] and out and all of a sudden here come
[27:34] God who picks them back up there may
[27:40] have been a time when when Satan that
[27:43] set a trap for you on the highway and
[27:45] the accident and all of a sudden you
[27:47] called on the name of God and got out of
[27:50] it then he say missed them again so he
[27:53] notices that there's something special
[27:55] about you so he pays special attention
[28:00] to you because he know that there's
[28:04] something that God has a plan for you
[28:07] so he'll look like this right here in
[28:10] Adam and Eve and a
[28:12] and indeed so no doubt Eve would go out
[28:14] you know trusted me Garden distance
[28:16] beautiful pace had not a care in the
[28:19] world speak to all of the animals and
[28:21] come across mr. serpent hello good
[28:23] morning mr. serpent how you doing
[28:25] no doubt the sermon indeed had plenty of
[28:27] conversations have plenty of
[28:31] conversations there was no problem with
[28:33] it
[28:34] he was the serpent she hid they had
[28:37] romanian over the animals Adam he had
[28:40] dominion over the animals but one day he
[28:44] come this devilish sentry Lucifer
[28:49] all of a sudden incident to the heart of
[28:53] that servant and began to influence that
[28:58] serpent to do his will not as one big
[29:03] man he come in crossing along in the
[29:05] garden again and she's talking living
[29:06] things and all through sir not knowing
[29:08] that this day she's talking to the
[29:13] incarnated differ different man now he
[29:19] was being influenced by spirit same in
[29:27] that today he has a different influence
[29:31] now this leopard began to talk to eat he
[29:35] began to say things to eat like Oh Eve
[29:37] now I want you're going to happen she
[29:39] noticed this that the other thing
[29:40] there's a the male giraffes and have a
[29:44] female at the wrath and then there's a
[29:46] baby giraffe male monkey a female monkey
[29:49] baby monkey male Dolphy mother baby say
[29:53] well what's wrong with you and they
[29:58] began to convince Eve they say well why
[30:03] don't you you you take of this tree now
[30:06] we know that we're not talking about a
[30:09] literal fruit we know we're not talking
[30:12] about a literal fruit say well what's
[30:16] different about us a way to begin to
[30:18] tell we that shall not surely die but
[30:22] that'll be wise beyond
[30:25] and what happened Eve began to
[30:32] assimilate she began to assimilate the
[30:38] problems
[30:39] Eve went in the head they sat down and
[30:43] had Bible study because let me put it to
[30:47] you this way the devil came against the
[30:54] message of the hour he didn't come to
[30:58] even say he is the rain you don't have
[31:02] to get on that art no it what time for
[31:06] that year they have one word goatee of
[31:09] this tree he came to her attacking what
[31:13] the message is our to tell her that this
[31:20] is not true when it was the truth
[31:24] now instead of her going back to Adam
[31:28] she began to reason with inner self and
[31:32] the symbol eight so what this spirit was
[31:36] saying to her and she went back let's
[31:42] say she took on a preaching spirit she
[31:47] went back and preached to Adam Adam knew
[31:52] she was wrong what what you did this
[31:57] foolishness from what know that she had
[32:01] done messed up but Adam willfully took
[32:07] on the scene to save e willfully he
[32:13] wasn't the scene but he had assimilated
[32:18] took on the similarities took on the
[32:23] likeness of this influence that was
[32:29] talking to her and carved the whole
[32:32] world to go into
[32:36] a sinful nature prophet said it like
[32:40] this every time you see an ambulance
[32:44] every time you see a hearse blame that
[32:49] on e you can blame that on e-learning
[32:54] other hand you know we still live living
[32:55] in the glorious time because we still
[32:57] have a God that sits high look low and
[33:00] there is a plan of redemption a plan of
[33:05] reconciliation not now we move on I like
[33:10] to display a platform there showing that
[33:15] there are two spirits on the earth and
[33:20] they're the two spirits and see we we
[33:24] here in the middle and we're going to
[33:26] assimilate to one or the other take on
[33:32] the likeness of one or the other and how
[33:37] do we take on that likeness
[33:39] we'll see here is by faith it's by
[33:46] election it's by the Word of God let's
[33:51] look at something here let's turn to
[33:54] numbers the 13th chapter and we're going
[33:57] to look at another soldier amen and
[34:00] we're going to bring out some things on
[34:01] this road to hit it uh I might I tell
[34:03] you what just really blessed my soul a
[34:06] man numbers the 13th chapter we're going
[34:10] to start from the 25th verse and I won't
[34:13] be before you long we're just gonna
[34:14] speed right through this and now drop
[34:18] these little nuggets offering you
[34:19] something to think about a man and it
[34:24] reads on this wise it says let's see
[34:30] here let's start from the first verse
[34:32] I'm sorry and the last thing unto Moses
[34:35] saying since out men that they may
[34:38] search the land of Canaan which I give
[34:42] unto the children of Israel of every
[34:46] tribe of their fathers shaggy see
[34:49] and a man everyone a ruler
[34:53] among them okay and Moses by the
[34:57] commandment of the Lord set them from
[35:00] the wilderness of Paran all those me
[35:05] were heads of the children is room now
[35:08] I'm not going to just read all of them
[35:10] but I want to I want to pay close
[35:11] attention to the sixth verse and says of
[35:14] the tribe of Judah
[35:16] Caleb the son of Jupiter forgive my
[35:23] pronunciation if it's not correct
[35:24] now I'll be going to going over here to
[35:26] the 25th verse and it says and they
[35:30] returned from sup from searching the
[35:33] land after forty days and they went and
[35:37] came to Moses and Aaron and to all the
[35:41] congregation of the children of Israel
[35:43] unto the wilderness of Paran and Kadesh
[35:47] and brought back word unto them and unto
[35:52] all the congregation and showed them the
[35:56] fruit of the land and they told him and
[35:59] said we came unto the land whither thou
[36:01] sick us and surely it floweth with milk
[36:04] and honey and this is the fruit of it
[36:10] they brought back evidence they brought
[36:12] back the great that was so big it took
[36:15] two men to carry imagine that mine and
[36:21] he said nevertheless the people be
[36:26] strong that dwell in the land and the
[36:30] cities are wall and every great and and
[36:35] moreover we saw the children of the
[36:38] image and the children of the Amalekites
[36:40] dwell in the land of the south and the
[36:45] Hittites and the gentle sites and the
[36:47] other White's dwell in the mountain and
[36:49] the Canaanites where about a sea by the
[36:52] coast of Jordan Taylor steeled the
[36:56] people before Moses
[37:00] and he said let us go up at once and
[37:05] possess it for we are well able to
[37:09] overcome now let me stop right there and
[37:12] quickly give a quick background we see
[37:15] now that we're up to this point here and
[37:18] Abraham had left the city that God told
[37:20] Abraham that he was going to give him
[37:23] they were going to have a child
[37:25] all right they were going to have a
[37:27] promised child her Sarah
[37:30] and-and-and-and-and the name there would
[37:32] be a blessed people okay and and and
[37:35] they go on and they have this child the
[37:39] God of Abraham but didn't have Isaac and
[37:42] then Isaac begat Jacob and then Jacob
[37:45] the twelve brothers his twelve sons and
[37:49] brothers and Joseph and then Joseph went
[37:51] into the Egypt and then they became
[37:53] slaves am i right that's in a nutshell
[37:57] okay so then arose the Pharaoh that knew
[38:00] not Joseph and they became slaves out in
[38:02] Egypt and they were down in slavery from
[38:04] what some four hundred years a man slave
[38:07] to the taskmaster so four hundred years
[38:10] they was down there under under bondage
[38:15] under bondage of Egyptian rule when they
[38:21] had a place that God had given them as
[38:24] an inheritance and this place was right
[38:28] here where all of these giants was but
[38:32] see they couldn't leave with nothing
[38:33] like that because they were being held
[38:35] in bondage
[38:36] now that bondage are I could've
[38:39] administered that bondage as today or
[38:42] could be a a sinful life and then again
[38:47] won't let you go it could be a
[38:49] denominational experience you just not
[38:51] have not have come to the knowledge of
[38:54] the truth as of yet amen but are these
[38:58] people in there being God's chosen
[39:02] people
[39:03] amen remember that they pray to
[39:08] ah that they could not see and Moses
[39:12] came alone
[39:13] born and raised in the house of Pharaoh
[39:16] to be the deliverer and he had to go
[39:18] through certain things that was had to
[39:20] leave and go to the house of Jeff room
[39:23] and he saw met with the pillow fight
[39:25] came back to deliver the people now he
[39:28] delivered the people now I want to stop
[39:32] here and I want to bring out that
[39:34] there's three stages of grace three
[39:38] stages of grace now and then this this
[39:41] this this price perfectly with what we
[39:43] was reading there and in Hebrews they
[39:46] asked a question I mean in the in there
[39:48] were or why obedient that we need
[39:50] another other than the tribe of Levi why
[39:54] we need another one like him to
[39:59] Melchizedek because he's a tribal Levi
[40:04] with a gate you know gate out of that
[40:07] came the law okay
[40:09] Moses had delivered them out and it's
[40:13] taken them to the mountain and with the
[40:16] finger of God had wrote the Ten
[40:19] Commandments and he gave it sort of air
[40:21] in the priesthood to add you know
[40:24] divine evidence say that the Levitical
[40:26] priesthood was supposed to be there for
[40:28] under the air held of the law
[40:33] amen but here was one coming that uh do
[40:40] not do away with the law
[40:42] thank you my brother but he is brought
[40:46] grace the three stages of grace a man
[40:54] they came here a man to this point and
[41:00] and and and Moses delivered them a man
[41:04] out of their bondage that was the first
[41:09] stage
[41:11] took them across the wilderness they
[41:16] came to a place at the Red Sea where he
[41:22] comes there's a sea in front of them and
[41:25] Pharaohs army coming behind them
[41:29] so surely destroy them and God delivered
[41:35] them by opening the Red Sea and walking
[41:40] out on dry land
[41:42] and they began as they got across out
[41:44] they see all of their troubles drown in
[41:49] the Red Sea now at that point Marion
[41:54] took a tambourine and begin to shout and
[41:58] praise God
[42:00] hello ray we free glory we've seen
[42:04] that's just like you you you you you
[42:07] confess your sins Lord you come the word
[42:14] came and preached my heart I turn my
[42:18] back on the devil and I walk out I walk
[42:22] out but I go to a place of the Red Sea
[42:26] and I get to a place where I have to
[42:29] become different sanctification I have
[42:36] to know that there's no way there's no
[42:38] poor back man and all of my my my old
[42:41] friends and the things that I'm used to
[42:45] see because over my life I had a
[42:48] simulating I had assimilated into the
[42:53] devil wanted me to be I had a simulated
[42:57] into the likeness of Satan I had a night
[43:03] not knowing not knowing but I had grew
[43:08] up around the inhabitants and I've seen
[43:11] this and I've seen this and I was taught
[43:15] this what was out of simile but now
[43:19] they came to me put the heart by the
[43:23] preaching of the gospel and I'm tired
[43:26] from my wicked ways
[43:28] I have begin to change my life becoming
[43:32] a simulator now I'm looking at something
[43:34] else I'm not looking at the world
[43:37] anymore
[43:38] I might focus of my attention you know
[43:41] God and I begin to love as I keep my
[43:44] eyes on him
[43:45] lowly's I feel it oh I begin to
[43:47] assimilate from what I was to what I he
[43:52] even wants me to be so I come to one
[43:55] stage and they came in you see oh I
[43:58] don't even have a desire to smoke well
[44:00] who but at one point I decided to go to
[44:02] the club every Friday night Saturday
[44:04] night hang out on the corner with the
[44:06] ball strike on Friday I had to decide
[44:12] every time I get off we got to stop Bob
[44:14] going get me a beer and go home but all
[44:17] of those desires I've fallen away don't
[44:21] even desire no more what what is it
[44:23] those things being drowned in the Red
[44:25] Sea so you begin to come to church and
[44:28] you realize to stop the government such
[44:30] an agenda go over the top
[44:32] hey thank you Jesus but you can't stay
[44:36] right paint it and stay right there they
[44:41] didn't set up camp on the other side of
[44:43] the sea we will stay here they were
[44:47] promised that land that place types the
[44:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost but they had
[45:01] to travel they had to continue to eat
[45:04] they haven't continue to be faithful
[45:07] they had to continue to be loyal and
[45:09] they came to continue to press into it
[45:11] now here we are they come to that land
[45:16] right up to the joy where they had to go
[45:20] through the joy Jordan type
[45:28] they're always there thinking take on
[45:32] the mind of God go over and possess
[45:37] their inheritance that laying that flow
[45:42] with milk and honey
[45:44] so go over they send these Caleb Joshua
[45:51] and ten others that go over Caleb and
[45:56] Joshua come back I'm always a good Lane
[45:59] Oh Caleb let us go all that once not a
[46:06] Bible tells us that other team came back
[46:10] with an evil report was it true yep
[46:20] but it was you why do you didn't see
[46:25] what Caleb and Joshua saw hey so be oh
[46:29] we can't do it he began to murmur and
[46:34] complain
[46:34] oh we rather go back the either peel the
[46:38] garlic watch after all he was done for
[46:41] you you still have no faith that God the
[46:47] same God that delivered you out of the
[46:49] bondage of Eden would deliver you and
[46:53] give you the land only - hey - think so
[47:02] those other team came back and did what
[47:05] they begin to preach against the message
[47:09] of the message of the hour was crossroad
[47:18] and take our lane and they began to
[47:22] spoil them love and folly
[47:25] spreading fear we're not able to do it
[47:30] they got walls and they spend 7 feet
[47:34] tall and you got their Malak Heights and
[47:37] the Hittites and all of these ones we
[47:41] didn't come this far to die
[47:44] they had no faith they had a simile
[47:52] assimilated how by fear by fear now I
[48:00] want to bring out caleb a man if I'm me
[48:06] amen
[48:07] Caleb steel the people rose and said we
[48:11] are more than able a man to take the
[48:16] land and all the congregation lifted up
[48:19] their voice and cried and the people
[48:22] wept that night and the children of
[48:25] Israel murmured against Moses and
[48:27] against Aaron and the whole congregation
[48:29] said unto them what God that
[48:32] we had died in the land of Egypt or with
[48:35] God we had died in the wilderness and
[48:39] wherefore has the Lord brought us into

[52:14] the land I'll make sure I skipped a
[52:23] whole
[52:39] amen yeah and and these are the
[52:42] countries which gave the Canaan and the
[52:45] heads of the fathers of the tribe the
[52:47] children of Israel distributing foreign
[52:50] inherence to them by lot was inherited
[52:54] as the LORD commanded by the hand of
[52:57] Moses for the nine tribes and a half for
[53:00] Moses had given an inherence of two
[53:03] tribes and a half tribe on the other
[53:07] side of Jordan Thank You Levites and
[53:14] gave non-adherence among them for the
[53:18] children of Joseph were two tribes and
[53:20] Manasseh and Ephraim and therefore they
[53:22] gave no part unto the Levites in the
[53:26] land save cities to dwell in the
[53:29] suburban in their cattle and the LORD
[53:32] commanded Moses so the children of
[53:34] Israel did they divided the land in the
[53:36] children of Judah came unto Joshua and
[53:41] gal Garth and Caleb the son of juniper
[53:47] the Kenneth II said unto them down
[53:54] noah's the thing that the Lord has said
[53:57] unto Moses the man of God concerning me
[54:01] and thee in Kadesh forty years old was I
[54:10] when Moses the servant of the Lord sent
[54:13] me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the
[54:17] land and I brought him word again that
[54:21] it were a word again as it was in my
[54:27] heart
[54:29] nevertheless my brother my brother when
[54:34] that went up with me me the heart of the
[54:39] people milk but I wholly followed the
[54:45] Lord my God and Moses where on that day
[54:49] saying surely the land were
[54:53] thy feet hath trodden shall be thine
[54:56] inheritance and thy children forever
[54:59] because thou has wholly followed the
[55:02] Lord o my god
[55:03] and now behold the LORD hath kept me
[55:07] alive as he said these forty in five
[55:12] years even since the Lord speak these
[55:16] words unto Moses while the children of
[55:19] Israel wandered in the wilderness and
[55:22] now lo I am this day four score in five
[55:27] years
[55:27] o eighty five years old and yet I am
[55:34] strong this day as our worlds in the day
[55:38] of Moses sent me as my strength was then
[55:43] even so is my strength now for war both
[55:48] to go out and to come in now therefore
[55:55] give me this mountain wherefore the Lord
[55:59] spake in that day for thou gardens in
[56:05] the day of how the a naxaiites were
[56:08] there and that the cities were great in
[56:11] fence and if so be the Lord will be with
[56:16] me then I will be able to drive them out
[56:20] as the Lord said and Joshua blessed him
[56:24] and gave unto caleb the son of jennifer
[56:28] heparin for and inheritance hair brought
[56:33] therefore became the inheritance of
[56:35] caleb the son of juniper the kemacite
[56:41] and i would love to just bring to your
[56:44] attention
[56:46] caleb was a kemacite not a jew caleb was
[56:55] a Gentile
[56:59] but because he wholly followed the Lord
[57:05] he received an inheritance of the land
[57:11] that God had promised to the Jews he
[57:18] received an inheritance not that he
[57:23] would see hep wrong with him to it I've
[57:25] been sitting a little bit a little Oh
[57:27] father about heparin became a city of
[57:34] refuge help Ryan became one of the
[57:41] greatest cities in the Bible we see that
[57:49] it talks about damn we won't read it all
[57:52] but through marriage in Egypt his mother
[58:00] and father I think it was his father
[58:05] well the Kennison and his mother was a
[58:09] Jew and and and marinus they had Caleb
[58:12] so we see that it was through a marriage
[58:17] that he was simulated into the Jewish
[58:24] culture a man and through his faith a
[58:29] man he was given an inheritance do you
[58:36] see the title we a Gentile bride through
[58:44] a marriage through a relationship with
[58:52] God himself through a relationship of
[58:57] men we're being married that we will
[59:02] receive an inheritance not because of
[59:09] who we are not because of some great
[59:11] thing we do
[59:12] it because of who we're married to will
[59:18] receive an inheritance a reward eight
[59:24] man we see here that Caleb being a
[59:31] Gentile from was given lien in the tribe
[59:38] of not Judah the children of UDF I'm
[59:51] sorry was judo in Aqaba Judah
[59:53] Caleb a son or Jenna for the kids and I
[59:55] unto him that knows the thing of the
[59:57] Lord amen it was Judah
[59:59] amen what's given laying through the
[1:00:01] tribe of Judah so he was assimilated a
[1:00:06] man and and and and that's what we're
[1:00:10] doing that's what's happening to us
[1:00:12] today we had a prophet our LA either a
[1:00:20] man to come and introduce us to Christ a
[1:00:26] man and and you say you and you may
[1:00:28] wonder what do you mean introduce us to
[1:00:30] Christ he introduced us to the revealed
[1:00:34] Word of God because before all you could
[1:00:38] do is pursue and put little things
[1:00:40] together it was it was you it was eaten
[1:00:44] from manna from a day gone by but now
[1:00:48] we're eating fresh manna just like I

[1:00:54] devil is always going to come against

[1:01:30] eagles among chickens there are some
[1:01:35] Eagles amongst those chickens they met
[1:01:38] so we keep them lifted up in prayer and
[1:01:40] we continue to be salted we continue to
[1:01:44] live a life before our brother in a man
[1:01:47] because it was not that we reached that
[1:01:49] nombe-la's but we know by this there was
[1:01:54] only two that had the revelation that
[1:01:59] had the faith to move forward amen

[1:04:04] similar dilemma to celebrity similar to
[1:04:13] similitude and and and in Hebrews talked
[1:04:22] about why we needed one like not
[1:04:28] resident from the tribe of Judah and not
[1:04:33] the Levites now the Levites they kept
[1:04:43] the law but see when Christ came he
[1:04:49] brought grace but we understand those
[1:04:53] three stages of grace the oh the the Old

[1:05:17] enough you understand that
[1:05:21] you're going to have to fight
[1:05:26] it's gonna happen it's going to be a
[1:05:28] press over into that land that's wrong
[1:05:34] milk and honey in that land that flows
[1:05:36] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost say
[1:05:41] well without we have sealed unto the day
[1:05:45] of our Redemption the prophet of God
[1:05:47] gave that story about how we have the
[1:05:51] boxcar and in the end they pack this
[1:05:56] boxcar and and everything in there
[1:05:59] everything has to be tight everything
[1:06:02] has to be just right and once everything
[1:06:08] is just right you got those inspectors
[1:06:11] the Holy Ghost is the inspector you come
[1:06:14] through and he's shaking this and
[1:06:15] shaking that if it's not just right it
[1:06:18] won't it won't it won't make the ride
[1:06:20] it'll get to its destination and
[1:06:22] something to be broken something to be
[1:06:24] messed up because the ride is rough
[1:06:27] things are gonna happen but when
[1:06:31] everything is packed just right that
[1:06:34] door is shut and then there there's a
[1:06:37] seal put on that door and that seal
[1:06:40] cannot be broken
[1:06:41] I see if it might be broken so oh we
[1:06:45] continue like this like Jeremiah he said
[1:06:49] I go down to the potter's house and I'll
[1:06:52] show you a great work and you go down to
[1:06:56] the potter's house and he's on the wheel
[1:06:57] and the Potter
[1:06:59] he's on the wilderness spinning and he's
[1:07:01] he's he's making this this Basin and and
[1:07:05] and and if there's a flaw in that vase
[1:07:08] he don't just add mud he breaks the
[1:07:11] whole thing down and filled it up the
[1:07:13] king so if there's a something in our in
[1:07:17] our life that's just not quite right
[1:07:19] Lord bring me down and fill me up again
[1:07:23] break me all the way down and build me
[1:07:25] up again amen to where a man of my face
[1:07:32] of my vessel will hold the oil will be
[1:07:37] able to hold
[1:07:38] the holy or that I'll be presented
[1:07:41] before you without a spot or wrinkle a
[1:07:44] man can't we find it thank you
[1:07:48] a man I'm gonna let stay far from I
[1:07:56] think 73 they've now they come to the
[1:08:01] place called Kadesh Barnea now we want
[1:08:04] to study this a moment Kadesh Barnea was
[1:08:07] the judgment seat of the world in that
[1:08:09] date and you moving faster okay the seat
[1:08:16] but I think that's found 13th chapter of
[1:08:19] numbers and go to mark in the scriptures
[1:08:20] if you wish read previous chapters
[1:08:24] studying we just have to hit the high
[1:08:27] places now in there or move up because
[1:08:32] I'm reading off your screen here for
[1:08:34] four days places revival like this can't
[1:08:40] study at verse by verse but it was
[1:08:44] judgment see there was a great whale
[1:08:49] there had many little whales out of it
[1:08:52] from out from it the tributaries order
[1:08:57] Springs from the great huge spring
[1:09:01] Kadesh Barnea perfect type of the church
[1:09:07] the church is the judgment seat Church
[1:09:10] begins the judgment begins at the house
[1:09:14] of God okay Israel gathered around
[1:09:17] Kadesh and now Moses said here in the
[1:09:20] first verse 13 chapter and unto the Lord
[1:09:23] of straight Moses saying send me down me
[1:09:25] and some search plan go ahead I read all
[1:09:29] that can you move up now could now God
[1:09:32] ordained that they should send 12 me and
[1:09:35] over one out of each tribe sending them
[1:09:38] over into the land of Canaan to spy out
[1:09:40] the land to see whether it was good
[1:09:42] place or not these spies will come back
[1:09:47] down ok these five went forth out of
[1:09:50] every tribe one out of Danny
[1:09:52] Oh although until they got to the 12 men
[1:09:57] perfect of the dignity of the church
[1:09:59] today in our journey and we're
[1:10:01] journeying up till I believe that the
[1:10:04] church is standing today and Kadesh
[1:10:06] Barnea judgment now God helped me the
[1:10:10] church oh my god help me I hope God will
[1:10:14] help me get this it'll sink in good and
[1:10:18] deep singing our exploits remember they
[1:10:22] had come this far because God had
[1:10:25] promised them and all among the line
[1:10:29] they had signs and wonders and miracles
[1:10:32] and now they were right up to the
[1:10:36] borderland and I believe we're on that
[1:10:40] borderland tonight I was wondering about
[1:10:44] all my meetings of things how I had to
[1:10:48] cancel them out I truly believe before
[1:10:51] the church can have the rapture it's got
[1:10:56] to have rapturing faith we can't even
[1:11:00] have faith for divine healing let alone
[1:11:04] rapturing faith got to have faith
[1:11:07] that'll change
[1:11:09] and quicken this body and be taken away
[1:11:13] I believe there's a church on it's wrong
[1:11:18] tonight a power of the Living God that
[1:11:22] men will speak the word here and there
[1:11:26] and it'll flash like lightning and a
[1:11:30] church is coming out not a psycho
[1:11:33] psychologist not some put all make
[1:11:38] belief that way real true genuine
[1:11:42] anointed Holy Ghost called out church
[1:11:46] amen
[1:11:49] here they are standing at Kadesh Barnea
[1:11:52] they said go over the land give to us
[1:11:55] hundreds of years ago by God through our
[1:11:59] Father we are the seed of Abraham God
[1:12:04] has led us safe
[1:12:06] this forty some odd miles from Egypt up
[1:12:09] to the borderland that could dish they
[1:12:13] hit they had got up there in a few days
[1:12:16] but remember because of their unbelief
[1:12:19] made them wander for 40 years unbelief
[1:12:24] noticed the church I'm speaking of
[1:12:27] parabolic speaking what the old world
[1:12:32] the new is in the more magnified way
[1:12:36] what the church the church I mean what
[1:12:40] the natural world the spiritual is now
[1:12:45] Kadesh and there he said now you go out
[1:12:50] and spy out God seek them Moses never
[1:12:55] Moses never God seek them over and say
[1:12:58] go over and spy out the land and come
[1:13:02] back and tell us whether it is good land
[1:13:07] or a bad land or whether we can take it
[1:13:11] or what this what this that or the other
[1:13:16] you go over and find out and twelve went
[1:13:20] over you know about the harlot Rahab and
[1:13:24] so forth all right now we're getting
[1:13:28] into that the harlot Rahab they went
[1:13:32] over and cut this cluster of grapes of
[1:13:34] return back but listen at the report the
[1:13:37] 12 men and 10 out of the 12 said oh they
[1:13:42] are a fearful people look over here what
[1:13:47] what a sight listen to this when they
[1:13:52] will return over now to the 17th verse
[1:13:55] and the 27th 17th were called the 27th
[1:13:59] mercy says and tell their men that was
[1:14:02] sent out and when they returned back
[1:14:05] their hearts were fainting they said oh
[1:14:11] they're great man listen their hearts
[1:14:16] were fainting I'll read up I think we
[1:14:19] we read that if we go up go up go up and
[1:14:23] I find a good point
[1:14:26] okay keep going stop and brought up an
[1:14:30] evil report on the land which they had
[1:14:33] searched out for the children of Israel
[1:14:35] saying that the land which we have gone
[1:14:39] to search it is a land that eateth up
[1:14:42] the inhabitants thereof all the people
[1:14:45] that we saw are in it our men great
[1:14:48] stature listen to what those what goes
[1:14:51] on say that we like look like
[1:14:53] grasshoppers upside the way upside them
[1:14:56] that's the report but Caleb and Joshua
[1:14:59] said we can take it we are more than
[1:15:03] able to do it why are they able to do it
[1:15:06] God had promised them to do it he says I
[1:15:10] like that courage continue to continue
[1:15:12] on and uh ten of them now the church
[1:15:15] came and it's now to a place where come
[1:15:20] down through the Luther age and the
[1:15:22] Methodist age and the Pentecostal age
[1:15:25] and down to a place where now some of
[1:15:29] the Full Gospel people turn firmly
[1:15:32] against the divine healing the atonement
[1:15:35] where we got to go place friends where
[1:15:41] you you it's getting horrible out there
[1:15:45] old-time religion they say it's some
[1:15:49] time and passed long ago can't have it
[1:15:52] it's too much we're living in modern day
[1:15:55] and got to get modern ideas we got to
[1:15:59] have shuffle boards in the church ping
[1:16:02] pong games and everything the whole are
[1:16:05] all young people continue about their
[1:16:07] brother and sister if it ever gets to a
[1:16:11] time that I have to have a card party in
[1:16:15] the church to hold the audience our
[1:16:17] quick pitch in the gospel cuz it's lost
[1:16:19] its power I tell you brother that we
[1:16:23] need to date is an old-fashioned simple
[1:16:26] gospel Holy Ghost power preached in the
[1:16:28] Sun in its simplicity
[1:16:31] then if I be lifted up from the earth
[1:16:34] I'll draw all men unto me amen better or
[1:16:39] that a blessing
[1:16:40] amen amen
[1:16:44] let us stand amen musicians come hey man
[1:16:50] I know that that was pretty broke up but
[1:16:52] I hope was able to I tell you through a
[1:16:57] display the way my felt in the way but
[1:17:01] it came to me we're living in a time
[1:17:06] where the history is basically repeating
[1:17:10] itself
[1:17:11] we're living in a real precious time the
[1:17:16] prophets said that he believed that
[1:17:18] we're at that point tonight right there
[1:17:21] at a different is the last couple of
[1:17:27] Bible studies I have been noticed and
[1:17:29] even prior to that whether there is an
[1:17:32] emphasis on the baptism of the holy
[1:17:38] ghost their baptism of the holy ghost
[1:17:42] say well we can we can come out and we
[1:17:47] can we can repeat the sinner's prayer
[1:17:51] and that's great
[1:17:53] that mean we're on the journey we can go
[1:17:57] through the Red Sea where we're cleanse
[1:18:00] and our desires and things fall behind
[1:18:04] as we see those old temptations begin to
[1:18:06] die and we can feel the anointing and we
[1:18:10] can shout and we can have a good time
[1:18:12] we're not quite there yet but we must
[1:18:16] press on we must press on all the way
[1:18:20] into the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:18:24] and if there's anything in that boxcar
[1:18:28] as the inspector the Holy Spirit and
[1:18:31] show it in our lives a man like that
[1:18:36] part on the wheel
[1:18:38] break me down and just make me over
[1:18:41] again
[1:18:42] as we come too far he promised us as a
[1:18:48] Gentile we see caleb had a faith that we
[1:18:52] are more than evil he didn't let fear
[1:18:55] get in his way he didn't let the
[1:18:57] doubters he didn't let what was going on
[1:19:00] around him to what what people were
[1:19:01] saying around him his heart
[1:19:04] we read that in the Bible he said his he
[1:19:08] came back and he confessed his heart it
[1:19:12] was in his heart to do right hey man it
[1:19:17] was in his heart to do right so if you
[1:19:20] feel a tug in your heart a man your
[1:19:24] greatest desire is to serve God with all
[1:19:26] that you know
[1:19:27] amen and we just ask him cuz he's gonna
[1:19:30] have to do it I mean we can't do it on
[1:19:33] our own
[1:19:34] I remember we just continued to stay
[1:19:36] before the Lord and can't continue to
[1:19:39] pray and then that just law continued to
[1:19:42] make the overlooking anything if there's
[1:19:45] anything in me that's not right Lord
[1:19:48] show it to me I make it right just
[1:19:51] continue to show me me and make me over
[1:19:54] again hey man amen let us pray most
