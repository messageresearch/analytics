[45:41] and i'll let you have your seat let's
[45:43] look at
[45:44] isaiah the book of isaiah chapter 62
[45:49] verses 1 to 5 isaiah 62
[45:53] 1-5 and we want to speak on a little
[45:57] simon and the title is the land of
[45:59] beulah
[46:00] or we know bella land we have a song
[46:02] that we sing oh beulahlan
[46:04] swee bula land and so on and so forth
[46:09] so let's read isaiah 62.
[46:12] it goes for zion's sick will i not hold
[46:15] my peace
[46:16] and for jerusalem sick i will not rest
[46:19] until the righteousness thereof go forth
[46:22] as brightness
[46:23] and the salvation thereof as a lamp that
[46:26] beneth
[46:27] 2 and the gentiles shall see thy
[46:29] righteousness
[46:30] and all kings thy glory and thou shalt
[46:33] be called by a new name
[46:35] which the mouth of the lord shall name
[46:38] thou shall also be crowned
[46:40] thou shall also be a crown of glory in
[46:43] the in the hand of the lord
[46:44] and arroyo died them in the hand of thy
[46:47] god
[46:48] verse 4 thou shalt no more be termed
[46:50] forsaken
[46:51] neither shall thy land anymore be tempt
[46:54] desolate but thou shall be called
[46:57] hefzeba
[46:58] and thyland beulah for the lord delights
[47:01] in thee
[47:02] and thy land shall be married five for
[47:04] as a young man married
[47:06] a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee
[47:08] and as the bridegroom
[47:10] rejoices over their bride so shall that
[47:12] god
[47:13] rejoice over thee god bless you shall we
[47:16] take our seed
[47:21] the land of beulah amen bela land
[47:25] so what is we want to break a couple of
[47:28] the terms from the scriptures that we
[47:30] read
[47:30] so that we can have some basis to to fly
[47:33] on
[47:34] it's like when you go to the airport and
[47:35] uh before that the flight
[47:38] the jet plane takes off they go
[47:41] they kind of gather momentum gather
[47:43] their velocity by just
[47:45] going on the earth for a long time for a
[47:46] little period of time to get the engines
[47:48] going to shrink themselves to
[47:50] be in a flight mode to taxi and do what
[47:53] they need to do so we want to
[47:54] just break a couple of times here from
[47:56] the scriptures now verse 1 said that for
[47:58] zion's sick
[47:59] i will not hold my peace i believe all
[48:01] of us understand peace
[48:03] peace is rest in your heart absence of
[48:06] war
[48:07] absence of struggle when you've got the
[48:09] rest
[48:10] the rest of christ in your heart we can
[48:12] break even into
[48:13] you can break it into different category
[48:15] we can talk about peace
[48:16] let's say you walk people work like
[48:19] 12-hour shifts
[48:20] people do night shifts so they work all
[48:23] night when others are sleeping
[48:25] and they come back in the morning maybe
[48:27] eight o'clock
[48:28] seven o'clock nine o'clock tired broken
[48:31] and they just jump on their bed and they
[48:32] sleep like a dead person
[48:34] that could be a piece for them because
[48:35] they are no longer working with machines
[48:37] they are not with a supervisor they know
[48:39] what bosses and they've got peace
[48:41] that is the human peace peace could be a
[48:43] struggle you're struggling to achieve
[48:44] something when you achieve it
[48:46] your heart is at rest right we can use
[48:48] it as a peace
[48:49] peace is why when people have financial
[48:51] security they have peace when the
[48:53] economy is going haywire
[48:55] people don't don't have peace because
[48:56] they don't know how whether they are
[48:58] going to be laid off
[48:58] their their investment what is going to
[49:00] happen their investment their pension
[49:02] so it brings agitation on their mind but
[49:04] then when the economy is going good
[49:06] hey wall street is doing good people at
[49:08] peace
[49:09] i mean there's joy everywhere you know
[49:11] people can buy and sell people can make
[49:13] money online
[49:14] just name it you know there's peace it's
[49:16] all good but then there's one piece
[49:19] that is what we're talking about eternal
[49:21] peace that wall street cannot give you
[49:24] that the economy cannot give you your
[49:26] supervisor can you cannot give you
[49:28] sleeping will not give you that peace
[49:30] but the peace that the almighty
[49:32] gives unto you amen so that is the peace
[49:35] we're talking about then we read about
[49:37] zion what is zion zion is
[49:41] nothing but the queen of heaven who
[49:43] lives in earth
[49:44] and you are zion amen so good morning
[49:47] zion
[49:49] zion don't look at zion as something
[49:51] some mountains sitting in israel
[49:53] they were all types and shadows but the
[49:55] true zion
[49:56] is you amen you who came from heaven
[49:59] from the mouth of god from the mind of
[50:02] god
[50:03] from the pillar of fire himself from the
[50:05] almighty
[50:06] who created the heaven and earth you
[50:08] came from him and you are his wife
[50:10] you are the queen of heaven you are in
[50:12] earth amen
[50:13] you are not just earthly being but you
[50:15] are a celestial being
[50:16] though you are you are you are engulfed
[50:19] around a lot of flesh
[50:20] cobra solomon amen a lot of flesh called
[50:23] uh
[50:24] brother uh calib calib amen so that is
[50:27] that is uh but before you became
[50:29] f you were a zion in heaven amen
[50:33] so we want what is jerusalem jerusalem
[50:35] can be broken into pieces jeru
[50:37] and salem jeru means god salem is city
[50:40] of peace
[50:42] now what is the city of peace is it a
[50:44] los angeles of course
[50:45] there's no peace over there fire
[50:47] bushfire and
[50:48] chaos and suicide united states there's
[50:51] no peace anywhere
[50:52] black lives matter white lives matter
[50:54] and what have you people marching to
[50:55] wall street
[50:56] presents presidential election at stake
[50:58] different things
[51:00] we don't know who is we don't know
[51:01] what's going on so there's no peace in
[51:03] the united states
[51:04] which country england no peace
[51:06] buckingham palace no peace
[51:08] russia no peace africa no peace haiti no
[51:11] peace
[51:11] so there's no peace anywhere on the land
[51:14] where you can say this is
[51:15] absolute place when i go to los angeles
[51:17] california
[51:18] i've got a piece no when i go to new
[51:20] york city bronze
[51:22] i've got peace no when i go to uh south
[51:25] africa
[51:25] cape town i've got peace no when i'm in
[51:28] mexico
[51:29] i've got peace there's no peace no way
[51:31] there's only one peace
[51:33] that comes from the lord and that is by
[51:36] the baptism of the holy spirit
[51:38] when the old nature is dissolved and god
[51:41] gives you that city
[51:42] then you become a peace not just that
[51:44] you you have peace but you are
[51:46] an epitome you are the center of peace
[51:48] you are the embodiment of peace
[51:50] you are the manifestation of peace you
[51:52] are a fountain of peace
[51:54] amen because peace himself is in you
[51:57] amen
[51:57] amen glory hallelujah to the lord
[52:00] blessed be the name of the lord
[52:02] so that is jerusalem gas city of peace
[52:04] now we talk about um
[52:08] we talk about bula that's where we're
[52:10] going to center what is that what is a
[52:11] hebrew word bela
[52:13] means owner or ownership
[52:16] beulah also means master bila means
[52:20] lord and it also means married and
[52:23] claimed as a wife
[52:25] married not just married but you are
[52:27] claimed
[52:28] as a wife heavenly zion amen
[52:33] so can the lord claim you as a wife are
[52:36] you married to him
[52:37] and can he claim you as his wife that he
[52:40] can trust in you
[52:41] that he can boost about you that you
[52:43] display his attribute
[52:45] or you don't you are not even married to
[52:46] him at all if you haven't done the
[52:48] marriage then you can do the marriage
[52:50] today
[52:50] and if you are married to him and you
[52:52] are not manifesting the marriage
[52:53] you don't have the marriage certificate
[52:55] you can do that today amen
[52:57] because god is love today this is the
[52:59] day the lord has made we are glad we are
[53:01] having a wedding right now
[53:02] so where's the word where's the brother
[53:04] the groom the bread is you
[53:06] and the groom is the lord jesus christ
[53:08] amen so people are going to receive the
[53:10] avoiding certificate today
[53:12] if you open your heart to the word of
[53:14] the lord the word has got the power to
[53:15] transform you
[53:16] to change your nature and give you the
[53:18] heavenly jerusalem amen
[53:20] so that you become the god city of peace
[53:22] working on earth
[53:24] in earth but you are embodiment of peace
[53:26] blessed be the name
[53:28] of the lord glory want to read this a
[53:30] little scripture here
[53:31] to just break down beulah or the the
[53:34] other word i wanted to break down is
[53:35] hefziba
[53:37] health ziba means my delight is in her
[53:41] my delight is in her who is mine christ
[53:44] who is her you his wife the delight of
[53:47] the husband is in the wife
[53:49] so the delight of christ jesus is not in
[53:52] the trees
[53:53] it's not in a white house it's not in
[53:55] the nations but is the nation
[53:56] of his wife amen the city of his wife
[54:00] you
[54:00] that is married to you that is giving
[54:02] his wedding a ring unto
[54:04] amen and let's see that he didn't just
[54:07] give a wedding ring
[54:08] but i gave you crowns i died him what is
[54:11] that item i want to go
[54:12] further a little bit but then let's read
[54:14] a scripture from daniel 7
[54:16] 18. daniel 7 18 reads
[54:19] by the saints of the most high take the
[54:21] kingdom and possess the kingdom forever
[54:24] even forever and ever amen the sins of
[54:27] the mosaic shall take the kingdom
[54:29] what is the kingdom the kingdom is the
[54:31] holy ghost baptism
[54:33] it is not white house kingdom it is not
[54:35] a russian kingdom
[54:37] is not the zulu of south africa but the
[54:39] kingdom we're talking about is the
[54:40] kingdom of jesus christ
[54:42] amen let's read a little bit further uh
[54:44] matthew 5
[54:45] 3 to 3 to 5. it reads
[54:48] blessed are the poor in spirit matthew 5
[54:52] 3-5 blessed are the poor in spirit
[54:55] for this is the kingdom of heaven
[54:58] blessed are they that mourn for they
[54:59] shall be comforted
[55:01] blessed are they meek for they shall
[55:03] inherit the earth
[55:04] amen the meek those who are mourning
[55:08] the poor in spirit this is the kingdom
[55:10] what is the kingdom
[55:12] is the sixth dimension christ himself
[55:14] and what is the earth
[55:16] the earth is what you have around you
[55:17] the spoken word of god upon all the
[55:19] earth
[55:20] god elected you just took a piece of
[55:22] atom cosmic light
[55:24] uh calcium potassium ion and put it
[55:27] together
[55:28] by the spoken word and created brother
[55:30] solomon amen
[55:31] that is what the city god wants to dwell
[55:33] in that is the earth
[55:35] and because heaven is living in earth
[55:37] there's comfort in your heart
[55:39] regardless of whatever situation that
[55:40] comes your way amen
[55:42] and let me read the the scripture that
[55:44] pertains to another scripture psalm 37
[55:46] 22 for such as be blessed of him
[55:50] shall inherit the earth and the and they
[55:52] that are cursed of him
[55:54] shall be cut off they that are blessed
[55:56] will inherit the earth
[55:58] who are those that are blessed those who
[56:00] sleep
[56:01] are in the lamp's book of life
[56:04] every human being on earth has his or
[56:06] her name
[56:07] in the book of life what is the book of
[56:10] life
[56:10] the book of life is the earth and the
[56:12] air that you breathe
[56:14] the human life which was born in 1952
[56:18] which dies in 2020 or who died in 2020
[56:23] the human life has a beginning and has
[56:25] an end
[56:26] that is the book of life animals have
[56:29] got book of life
[56:30] plans of god book of life all human
[56:33] beings regardless of what they've got
[56:34] book book of life adolf hitler had a
[56:36] book of life
[56:37] because he was a human being he had a a
[56:40] breath in
[56:40] in his heart but abram went to i think
[56:42] south africa and they learned a word
[56:43] called amoya
[56:45] amoya means they have different meanings
[56:47] of ammonia it means
[56:48] the unseen force the unseen wind and it
[56:51] also means
[56:52] the breath that we breathe so abraham
[56:54] preaches someone blasphemous name he
[56:55] said
[56:56] if all of us we all breathe amoya we
[56:59] breathe the air
[57:00] if all of us have got eternal life then
[57:01] why do we struggle for eternal life
[57:04] if their breath the oxygen that we
[57:06] breathe
[57:07] the ammonia is eternal life then why do
[57:09] we struggle because all humanities are
[57:11] struggling for eternal life
[57:13] you say over a quick not everybody
[57:14] people are clapping and dancing and
[57:17] they are doing stuff yes those in
[57:19] hollywood they want to eternal life
[57:20] that's what they spend millions to do a
[57:23] cosmetic surgery
[57:25] because they want to live forever
[57:27] because in them
[57:28] they know that there's something about
[57:30] living eternally
[57:31] about eternal life but in their mind
[57:34] they think doing plastic surgery
[57:35] cosmetic surgery
[57:37] and trying to stay in young uncoats
[57:39] forever
[57:40] will make them live eternally but it
[57:43] doesn't happen that way
[57:44] sometimes they end up committing suicide
[57:46] upon all the millions and the billions
[57:48] because they don't have the peace they
[57:50] don't have mount zion
[57:51] they don't have villa land in their
[57:53] heart their hand is
[57:55] their their land is not fertilized as
[57:57] builder land but when the land is
[57:58] becomes
[57:59] builder land then you've got that peace
[58:02] that you don't have to
[58:03] pay money to do cosmetic surgery it
[58:05] doesn't matter what happened to this
[58:06] earthly flesh
[58:07] there's a being who lives eternally amen
[58:11] glory hallelujah to the lord blessed be
[58:13] the name of the lord
[58:14] let's break then the book of life let
[58:16] him finish that thought the book of life
[58:18] the lamb's book of life is the eternal
[58:20] life
[58:21] the life that has no beginning it
[58:23] doesn't have above date it might began
[58:25] manifesting at a certain time but the
[58:27] life itself
[58:28] does not have a beginning amen for
[58:31] example you can go and scoop
[58:32] a soil and put in a plant and put
[58:36] a flower in it or plant a seed in it
[58:40] and you can put a deet this soil was
[58:42] taken at this time
[58:43] i put mango tree i put a hibiscus flower
[58:47] in this plant in the soil but the soil
[58:50] was there
[58:51] way before you were born the soil didn't
[58:54] begin when you scooped it and tried to
[58:55] put a seed in it
[58:57] the soil has been there maybe started
[58:59] manifesting
[59:00] becoming a soil where plant your plant
[59:02] or your flower or your seed was living
[59:04] in it
[59:05] but the soil has ever been there since
[59:06] the lord's put it into existence
[59:08] so the word of god the seed in you has
[59:11] always been there
[59:13] it doesn't matter when you were born
[59:15] it's a tenor
[59:16] is the almighty himself is jesus christ
[59:19] and it has not it does not it doesn't
[59:20] have a beginning
[59:21] it does not have an end and that's
[59:23] eternal life
[59:24] and that is a gift of god that is the
[59:26] lamb's book of life
[59:28] so one time i think the prophet was
[59:29] asked what is the difference between the
[59:30] lamb book of life are they
[59:32] the lamb's book of life and the book of
[59:34] life are they two separate books
[59:35] he said yeah it looks like there are two
[59:38] but in reality in essence
[59:39] it's one book there's only one brother
[59:42] solomon i can see a shadow a little
[59:44] shadow of him there so you might look at
[59:46] two
[59:47] okay brother salomon and brother solomon
[59:49] but it's only one
[59:51] it's original brother solomon that is
[59:52] casting a shadow
[59:54] of of brother solomon that you see on
[59:57] earth
[59:58] the trooper that solomon is the tenor
[59:59] being his shadow is what you see
[1:00:02] is what you hack what you shake hands
[1:00:03] with is what sings but a true
[1:00:05] better solomon is the one that lives on
[1:00:07] the inside of brother solomon
[1:00:09] it's only one amen there's only one form
[1:00:11] of eternal life
[1:00:12] and that is jesus christ that has no
[1:00:16] beginning
[1:00:16] that has no end and that is the lamb's
[1:00:19] book of life
[1:00:20] that's good goes beyond amoya one time
[1:00:24] the same bahram saw a young man in south
[1:00:27] africa
[1:00:28] i think it was like from a tribe called
[1:00:29] huttington and he was carrying an idol
[1:00:32] and was supposed to be a christian so he
[1:00:33] was working walking
[1:00:34] traveling with i think one brother
[1:00:36] called sidney jackson if i'm if i
[1:00:37] remember correctly
[1:00:38] he was a mayor of south africa somewhere
[1:00:40] and said why is he carrying this
[1:00:42] idol let's ask him a question he said
[1:00:44] are you a christian say yes i'm a
[1:00:45] christian
[1:00:46] and he mentioned his name abraham of
[1:00:47] course couldn't say the name so it's
[1:00:48] okay
[1:00:49] since you're chris i'm going to call you
[1:00:50] thomas thomas why are you a christian
[1:00:52] and so having parking idols say well
[1:00:54] these adults were given to me by my dad
[1:00:56] one time my dad was in the woods and a
[1:00:57] lion appeared and my dad set a fire and
[1:01:00] consorted the idols and the lion ran
[1:01:02] away
[1:01:03] and so no it wasn't the light it wasn't
[1:01:04] the idol it wasn't a moya it was a fire
[1:01:08] that scared the lion and he said if
[1:01:10] amoya fails
[1:01:11] i i'll use the second idol
[1:01:15] so ram said well you don't need ammo
[1:01:16] yeah you need jesus christ
[1:01:18] when you have jesus christ in your heart
[1:01:21] you are all secured
[1:01:22] you don't have to have another backup
[1:01:25] the backup of all the backup of all the
[1:01:27] backup is the lord jesus christ
[1:01:29] so when you have him in your heart you
[1:01:31] just let him take care of situation
[1:01:34] if you have jesus christ in your heart
[1:01:35] and you need another backup then you
[1:01:37] don't really have
[1:01:38] him if you have jesus christ if you
[1:01:40] think jesus christ can take your
[1:01:42] situation
[1:01:43] and you're still like no maybe jesus
[1:01:44] christ cannot take it he might be able
[1:01:46] to but you know what
[1:01:47] i think brother susie can help me better
[1:01:49] so let me get back brother jose as a
[1:01:51] backup
[1:01:52] then you don't really have jesus christ
[1:01:55] if you have a vehicle let's say a ford
[1:01:57] and you think uh the ford
[1:02:00] has a problem you have a problem with
[1:02:01] the vehicle and you think fourth company
[1:02:03] can do it you send it to ford company
[1:02:06] you don't send it to chevy because ford
[1:02:08] is the one who manufactured a vehicle
[1:02:11] and they know their needed greatest
[1:02:12] about their vehicle they know what is
[1:02:14] how it's
[1:02:15] whatever every part the engine how it
[1:02:17] works they know their horsepower in it
[1:02:19] they know what to do with it so when
[1:02:20] your for your fault breaks down
[1:02:22] you take your default company and they
[1:02:24] will fix it for you but then if you
[1:02:26] think this fourth company cannot do it i
[1:02:27] need to get a chevy company
[1:02:29] then you don't really have faith in the
[1:02:30] fourth company so if you have christ in
[1:02:33] your life you think you have christ in
[1:02:34] your life and you can
[1:02:35] rest on him have peace in christ
[1:02:39] then you don't have christ because if
[1:02:42] you have christ in your life
[1:02:44] in the midst of the storm in the midst
[1:02:46] of the difficulties
[1:02:48] in crisis time yes you might go through
[1:02:50] crisis
[1:02:51] the boat will be i mean dangling on the
[1:02:53] river but yes so christ in you
[1:02:56] the hope of glory and the expression of
[1:02:59] glory in your earth
[1:03:01] will tilt the boat to the right
[1:03:02] direction
[1:03:05] we will streamline the boat in the
[1:03:06] direction that it should go we'll bring
[1:03:08] peace we'll uncut the boat
[1:03:09] amen so you need to christ for your
[1:03:12] security for everything
[1:03:13] amen and if you don't have him then life
[1:03:16] is full of chaos
[1:03:18] nothing will hold for you money will not
[1:03:19] hold nothing marriage doesn't hold
[1:03:22] children will not hold family will be
[1:03:24] broken and nothing
[1:03:27] job nothing careers will not help you
[1:03:29] can get all the best career
[1:03:31] you can achieve your so-called life
[1:03:34] dream be on the top of the ladder
[1:03:36] yes you don't have peace in your heart
[1:03:39] there are people who have got money
[1:03:41] but they can't sleep without taking
[1:03:42] about six tablets of medication before
[1:03:44] they go to sleep
[1:03:46] some take about 12 medication but they
[1:03:49] have all their money
[1:03:50] they can go for all the vacation they've
[1:03:52] got properties around the world
[1:03:54] but they cannot have a simple six hour
[1:03:56] sleep without taking
[1:03:58] about three to twelve medication
[1:04:02] and sometimes it doesn't even last they
[1:04:03] can't go to sleep for six hours
[1:04:06] or eight hours they can get two hours
[1:04:08] they wake up and sit on their bed watch
[1:04:10] television
[1:04:11] but you have christ in your life it
[1:04:13] doesn't matter what is
[1:04:14] going on outside remember jesus was on
[1:04:17] the boat
[1:04:18] the boat was capsizing and there was
[1:04:21] torment and storm
[1:04:22] but it was fast asleep and snoring
[1:04:25] because he was the master of peace
[1:04:27] the circumstances doesn't change his
[1:04:29] situation he wasn't a situational god
[1:04:33] he was he wasn't a situational christian
[1:04:35] and let me break
[1:04:36] break it a little bit situational
[1:04:38] christian is like when you're in crisis
[1:04:40] oh i know hurricane is coming hey i got
[1:04:42] to be in church where's i mean brazil
[1:04:44] please open the church door i need to be
[1:04:45] in church
[1:04:46] i need to pray please please pray for me
[1:04:48] because hurricane is coming
[1:04:50] because there's a there's a crisis
[1:04:52] there's a global pandemic
[1:04:54] chronovirus i need to be a christian
[1:04:56] fellow i need to be a crippy
[1:04:58] when chronovirus is over oh now you have
[1:05:00] ever seen i can go back to my old life
[1:05:02] and have fun enjoy the world so you're a
[1:05:04] situational christian
[1:05:06] when a condition arises you are a
[1:05:08] christian when that condition is over
[1:05:10] you are no longer a christian when you
[1:05:12] are sick you need prayer from the lord
[1:05:14] you want to be around god's people when
[1:05:16] you are healed
[1:05:17] back in the world and doing foolish
[1:05:19] things that is a situational christian
[1:05:22] but the one who is a christian through
[1:05:24] and through
[1:05:25] it doesn't matter just like the lord
[1:05:27] regardless of the storm
[1:05:28] he was sleeping at peace because he has
[1:05:31] got a spoken word in him
[1:05:33] to speak the storm out of creation he
[1:05:36] can speak into creation
[1:05:37] and he can speak out of creation amen
[1:05:40] and the same power is in you
[1:05:42] you can speak situation into creation
[1:05:44] and speak it out of
[1:05:45] creation a minister traveled to israel
[1:05:48] and he met a jewish rabbi and he was
[1:05:50] sharing the word of the lord with him
[1:05:51] of course being a staunch jewish he
[1:05:54] wasn't believing that
[1:05:55] no messiah is not here yet we are still
[1:05:56] waiting for the messiah
[1:05:58] and he said well the loss god sent the
[1:06:00] messiah yeshua
[1:06:02] elohim sent a prophet and that prophet
[1:06:04] spoke
[1:06:05] cancer out of existence and he spoke
[1:06:07] squirrel into existence and said
[1:06:08] he's a prophet he must be a prophet
[1:06:11] because we the jewish people
[1:06:13] our prophet speaks things into creation
[1:06:16] and they can speak things out of
[1:06:18] creation so if that gentle prophet
[1:06:20] william abraham spoke
[1:06:21] things into creation and spoke things
[1:06:23] out of creation
[1:06:24] he's the prophet of the lord and that
[1:06:26] man believe the word of the lord at that
[1:06:28] hour
[1:06:29] because a prophet speaks into creation
[1:06:31] and you are prophet
[1:06:33] a priest and a king and a queen you can
[1:06:35] speak things
[1:06:36] out of creation and speak things into
[1:06:38] creation
[1:06:40] if there's a situation in your life or
[1:06:42] in your loved one's life
[1:06:43] and it's not a good situation it's an
[1:06:45] adverse situation
[1:06:46] the lord has got given you the authority
[1:06:49] to speak in
[1:06:50] it out of out of creation to speak
[1:06:52] healing into creation
[1:06:54] one time william brown's wife says
[1:06:56] tamida had a tumor
[1:06:57] you know how how it started she had a
[1:07:00] little a little bit of a disrespect for
[1:07:02] the husband and the lord was mad so
[1:07:04] there was a tumor she was tricking by
[1:07:05] timon but it didn't manifest until like
[1:07:07] a year
[1:07:08] and it became big bigger and bigger and
[1:07:10] it got to the side like
[1:07:11] size of a lemon so they had to do a
[1:07:13] surgery but ram has been praying the
[1:07:15] same time period of time
[1:07:17] he was praying for people when they are
[1:07:18] getting healed he was healing the sick
[1:07:20] raising the dead
[1:07:21] but his own wife was in trouble he
[1:07:24] prayed and fasted
[1:07:25] with everything that was in him it looks
[1:07:28] like the lord wasn't listening
[1:07:29] so they had to do a surgery on their
[1:07:31] surgery abraham decided to go home and
[1:07:33] pray
[1:07:33] for the last time so he went home and he
[1:07:35] prayed and the lord said why are you
[1:07:37] troubling me why are you
[1:07:39] getting trouble speak what you want
[1:07:42] and he said before the doctor touched my
[1:07:43] wife before the doctor touches my wife
[1:07:45] let the tumor vanish and the daughter
[1:07:48] has prepared the tumor
[1:07:50] prepared the surgery they were going to
[1:07:51] do surgery and they couldn't find a cell
[1:07:53] he couldn't find a tumor where's the
[1:07:54] tumor i think they look at the x-ray
[1:07:57] it's supposed to be maybe on the right
[1:07:58] side
[1:07:58] it's not there it's not the left what's
[1:08:00] going on here and the ram appeared at
[1:08:02] the hospital room said be still be at
[1:08:03] peace
[1:08:04] the lord has already taken care of
[1:08:05] situation
[1:08:07] he's the master physician the chief
[1:08:10] surgeon
[1:08:10] and when you have the feet sometimes you
[1:08:12] build your faith
[1:08:14] you might it might seem the lord is not
[1:08:15] listening to your prayers you might
[1:08:17] assume the lord doesn't care about your
[1:08:18] situation
[1:08:19] but he wants you to your feet to go
[1:08:21] higher and higher
[1:08:22] and higher and higher so you get to know
[1:08:24] that my solution
[1:08:26] is in me because i've got christ in me
[1:08:30] and when the christ see me when i
[1:08:31] resurrect brenda christ i mean to create
[1:08:33] into manifestation
[1:08:34] everything is done you are looking this
[1:08:37] way for solution
[1:08:38] you are looking this way for solution
[1:08:39] but the solution is in your heart
[1:08:41] he said the kingdom of god is not in the
[1:08:43] north or the south the kingdom of god
[1:08:45] is in you amen the holy spirit is in you
[1:08:48] and that creative spirit creative power
[1:08:51] is in your heart to speak things into
[1:08:53] creation
[1:08:54] and out of creation amen
[1:08:57] glory hallelujah our lord is good
[1:09:02] so back to the land of er beulah now
[1:09:05] when the lord
[1:09:06] calls you as his own he decorates you
[1:09:11] he put crowns and died him and what does
[1:09:14] he want to break away diadem
[1:09:16] diadem is a crown you know different
[1:09:18] cultures use uh different jewels
[1:09:21] gold diamonds rubies different jewels
[1:09:24] for different purposes
[1:09:25] now a diadem is a crown it's a
[1:09:28] cloth headband sometimes adorned with
[1:09:30] jewels
[1:09:31] and in the olden days it was worn by
[1:09:33] monarchs in asia minor
[1:09:35] and other part of the east to signify
[1:09:37] royalty
[1:09:38] dignity and authority another
[1:09:41] translation said that the diadem is a
[1:09:42] head piece
[1:09:43] symbolizing royalty and authority and is
[1:09:47] worn by kings and queens
[1:09:49] it's a crown and if you go into the
[1:09:51] bible the lord
[1:09:53] ordained when you're doing moses to ask
[1:09:55] moses to ordain his
[1:09:57] brother aaron as a priesthood they had
[1:09:59] their crowns and diadems
[1:10:01] and bells jewels that rings to signify
[1:10:04] authority that when you hear the bells
[1:10:06] of uh aaron's clothes
[1:10:08] the priest the priesthood rope when you
[1:10:11] see those crowns and bells ringing
[1:10:14] it it means the lord is alive god is
[1:10:16] still in manifestation
[1:10:18] shaking our glory is still here and you
[1:10:20] can read it from ezekiel 28
[1:10:22] and leviticus eight to nine we can't we
[1:10:24] don't have time to read the bible
[1:10:26] now i want to move it i want us to move
[1:10:27] to a jewish alphabet
[1:10:31] so brother what are you talking about
[1:10:32] are you going to teach us hebrew
[1:10:34] i don't even know hebrew myself we are
[1:10:37] not going to do hebrew lessons i met a
[1:10:40] i was doing in 10 hours at a cvs on
[1:10:41] target and a lady came to the pharmacy
[1:10:44] she was looking for i think the daughter
[1:10:45] had a
[1:10:46] a little surgical procedure she was
[1:10:48] looking for and deceptive soap
[1:10:50] to wash to disinfect the police so
[1:10:52] nobody was helping her people would go
[1:10:54] to this aisle
[1:10:55] go here and i step out of the pharmacy
[1:10:57] to go and help her get the item
[1:10:59] so i begin talking to her and she said
[1:11:01] i'm actually from israel
[1:11:02] i'm sorry i don't know anything about
[1:11:04] these places so i don't know their shop
[1:11:05] what to find that's no problem let's go
[1:11:07] so i got it for her and we started
[1:11:09] talking i could see a spread of the lord
[1:11:10] in her
[1:11:11] addressing and everything about her it's
[1:11:13] just like a saint of christ
[1:11:14] so i said i wish i can bless you with a
[1:11:16] hebrew word but i don't know any
[1:11:18] i don't know i don't know hebrew but i
[1:11:20] know one hebrew it and she said
[1:11:22] shalom yes thank you that's it you got
[1:11:25] it
[1:11:25] shalom peace of god to you so i'm not
[1:11:27] going to teach you hebrew but i want us
[1:11:29] to god is found everywhere
[1:11:31] you can see god in in nature in the
[1:11:33] trees
[1:11:34] you can see god in buildings you can see
[1:11:36] garden people you can see god in animals
[1:11:38] you can see them in the waters you can
[1:11:39] see them
[1:11:40] in the in the zodiac because the first
[1:11:42] bible the lord
[1:11:43] created or the lord wrote wasn't the
[1:11:45] paper bible that we
[1:11:47] read he wrote in the atmosphere
[1:11:50] in the skies in the in the firmament he
[1:11:53] wrote the first
[1:11:54] bible was the sun and everything come
[1:11:57] came from the sun all the creation the
[1:11:59] sun was the first spoken word of god
[1:12:01] which types the logos the son of god god
[1:12:04] himself moved himself from the seventh
[1:12:06] dimension
[1:12:07] to the sixth dimension which is christ
[1:12:10] it doesn't mean he spoke something
[1:12:11] something separate if you go to the
[1:12:13] greek word kinos
[1:12:15] kenos means god translating himself
[1:12:18] it's not like you bringing for your
[1:12:20] child but a solomon and his son
[1:12:23] yes they are the same thing he's gone by
[1:12:24] the solomon but he's got he's got his
[1:12:26] own personality
[1:12:27] but then christ and elohim is the
[1:12:30] self-same person
[1:12:31] he just translated himself from one
[1:12:33] attribute
[1:12:34] of all existence into an attribute
[1:12:38] of of a human because he wanted to
[1:12:40] become a human so he created the first
[1:12:42] image the first part of him was the
[1:12:44] lugas
[1:12:45] the theophany the word body and that is
[1:12:48] what you have that is the eternal part
[1:12:49] of you
[1:12:50] the word body is the true you amen when
[1:12:52] this earthly person is dissolved
[1:12:54] there's a weird body in you which is a
[1:12:56] tenor which was here before us
[1:12:59] was born which was here before texas was
[1:13:01] spoken into existence
[1:13:02] which was said before alaska came into
[1:13:04] creation and that is the red body so he
[1:13:06] moves himself to the word body
[1:13:07] which is the theophany the logos because
[1:13:09] he wanted to become more like a human
[1:13:12] he doesn't want to be self-existence in
[1:13:13] the theophanic that uh dimension
[1:13:16] so he moved himself in the logos form
[1:13:18] and begin to manifest in the logos form
[1:13:20] and then gradually he moved himself into
[1:13:21] becoming a human becoming
[1:13:23] a melchizedek becoming jesus christ
[1:13:26] becoming brother solomon becoming sister
[1:13:28] naomi
[1:13:28] becoming sister sarah becoming such a
[1:13:30] car becoming all my sisters and brothers
[1:13:33] here
[1:13:33] because you are christ amen you are not
[1:13:36] different from christ
[1:13:37] you are christ but you are modern day
[1:13:39] christ amen
[1:13:40] you don't have to wear eastern garment
[1:13:42] like like
[1:13:43] jesus of nazareth you can wear tie you
[1:13:46] can wear dress
[1:13:47] but as long as you've got the holy ghost
[1:13:48] in you you are christ
[1:13:50] in manifestation amen so the lord wanted
[1:13:53] to
[1:13:54] the hebrew alphabet have got crowns
[1:13:57] and each alphabet has got a certain
[1:14:00] authority
[1:14:01] that they they denote they kind of
[1:14:03] predict that authority
[1:14:05] now there are seven uh letters that have
[1:14:07] got very powerful
[1:14:08] significant diadems or crowns
[1:14:12] and each letter has as a kind of energy
[1:14:16] that they operate or frequency so the
[1:14:18] crack the letters a
[1:14:19] they call it alif alif signif signifies
[1:14:23] the unity the oneness of christ
[1:14:25] god is one the unity of the spirit
[1:14:29] god is not true that's why a true jew a
[1:14:32] true hebrew
[1:14:33] even if he doesn't know nothing about
[1:14:35] this and he doesn't believe there's two
[1:14:36] guys
[1:14:37] they are trinity they are three guys no
[1:14:39] the father the son the spirit
[1:14:41] is the self-same god but he manifests
[1:14:43] himself as a father
[1:14:45] as a son and as a holy spirit it's not
[1:14:48] three guys who agree in what no
[1:14:50] it's not about a josue but a solomon a
[1:14:52] tsunami agreeing to go to restaurant
[1:14:54] after church whether they want to go to
[1:14:56] what's your favorite restaurant
[1:14:58] where do you want to go burger king
[1:15:01] wrestling where who they have to go papa
[1:15:05] pappas okay salami where do you want to
[1:15:06] go she's not decided yet
[1:15:09] so you're going to have a problem here
[1:15:11] you want to go to a burger king papa
[1:15:13] because that is not decided yet it's not
[1:15:15] that type of unity it is one person
[1:15:18] now but someone cannot change to become
[1:15:19] better josue but jose cannot
[1:15:21] become a salomon but now christ is
[1:15:24] eternal
[1:15:26] and he can be in the form of melchizedek
[1:15:28] and he can change
[1:15:29] to become jesus christ because he's the
[1:15:31] son of god
[1:15:32] who lives in heaven and he lives on
[1:15:34] earth he can be here
[1:15:36] and he can be in india he can be here
[1:15:39] and he can be in africa
[1:15:41] my flesh cannot be here and be in africa
[1:15:43] no but
[1:15:44] christ the eternal being can be here and
[1:15:47] being everywhere he wants to be
[1:15:49] because he's a tenor amen glory
[1:15:51] hallelujah to the lord amen
[1:15:53] so the letter is let me just read a
[1:15:55] little bit from here praise god
[1:15:57] hallelujah
[1:15:58] glory to the lord let's read from
[1:16:00] ephesians chapter four
[1:16:03] one to six paul's talking about the
[1:16:06] unity of the of
[1:16:08] of the spirit verse one said i therefore
[1:16:13] the prisoner of the lord beseech you
[1:16:15] that you walk worthy of the vocation
[1:16:17] wherewith you are called
[1:16:19] with all lowliness and meekness and with
[1:16:21] long suffering for bearing one and
[1:16:23] another in love that's that's the
[1:16:26] caption love
[1:16:27] uh endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:16:29] spirit in the band of peace
[1:16:31] so where there's love the spirit is
[1:16:33] there there's going to be what peace
[1:16:35] there's one body that's for one body one
[1:16:38] spirit
[1:16:39] even as you are called in one hope of
[1:16:42] your calling
[1:16:43] one lord one faith one baptism
[1:16:47] one god and father of all who is above
[1:16:50] all
[1:16:50] and through all and in you all so that
[1:16:53] is the
[1:16:54] the first letter of the jewish
[1:16:57] alphabet signified alphabet is the
[1:17:00] oneness of the spirit
[1:17:02] amen there's not two girls that's why
[1:17:04] the lord gave moses the commandment
[1:17:06] what's the first commandment
[1:17:07] o israel the lord thy god is one
[1:17:11] obula land the lord thy god is one oh
[1:17:14] wife of the wife of christ the lord i
[1:17:16] got this one oh bride of christ the lord
[1:17:18] i got this one
[1:17:19] oh queen of heaven the lord thy god is
[1:17:22] one
[1:17:22] in other words you've got one husband
[1:17:25] lord means savior and husband
[1:17:27] amen a woman cannot have two husbands
[1:17:30] you go and stay with this husband and
[1:17:31] you go and you cook for this husband and
[1:17:32] you cook for no you cook
[1:17:34] and split it for two husbands it doesn't
[1:17:35] work that way you have only one husband
[1:17:37] amen
[1:17:39] now so the hebrew letters are they are
[1:17:41] just like ordinary letters
[1:17:43] but then each letter is a symbol and
[1:17:46] they have
[1:17:46] inner meaning beside the letters that
[1:17:49] you see
[1:17:50] they have an inner meaning so the first
[1:17:51] letter is called alif
[1:17:53] that is the first letter of the air of
[1:17:55] the hebrew
[1:17:56] hebrew alphabet and alif indicates or
[1:17:59] signifies the oneness
[1:18:01] and the unity of the creator it gives
[1:18:04] it goes beyond the duality of man's
[1:18:07] translation
[1:18:08] man want to have polytheism want to
[1:18:11] worship
[1:18:12] this and worship that and worship this
[1:18:14] but there's only one god
[1:18:16] amen now a leaf and
[1:18:19] represent creation of something from
[1:18:20] nothing
[1:18:22] that's was one minute a leaf a
[1:18:25] representing creed creating something
[1:18:27] from nothing who can do that elohim
[1:18:30] he's the only one who can create
[1:18:31] something out of nothing
[1:18:34] amen he's timeless speechless
[1:18:37] and he's present everywhere
[1:18:40] he doesn't have any time limitation on
[1:18:43] him
[1:18:43] you can't contain him in the space he's
[1:18:46] beyond
[1:18:47] your container he can do all things
[1:18:51] he's beyond perfection he's beyond human
[1:18:55] understanding and that is i like the
[1:18:57] oneness of the world
[1:18:58] now let's look at creation let's look at
[1:19:00] let's use medicine to break things here
[1:19:03] doctors sometimes when they go to
[1:19:04] medical school or those who study
[1:19:06] biology
[1:19:07] anatomy they give them animal samples
[1:19:09] like a rabbit guinea pig
[1:19:11] frog and dissect them they give you one
[1:19:13] rabbit
[1:19:14] and then you dissect the rabbit cut open
[1:19:17] the open the intestines
[1:19:19] the the gut and then you cut the head
[1:19:22] you if you want to learn about the
[1:19:23] nerves or the the brain or whatever
[1:19:26] sometimes they give you chemicals to see
[1:19:28] how these animals will respond before
[1:19:30] drugs are
[1:19:31] manufactured or before they they are
[1:19:33] given to human beings they have to go
[1:19:35] through trials
[1:19:36] they use animals to try to see the
[1:19:38] effect on the animals and then
[1:19:40] they kind of project see that okay if
[1:19:42] this uh
[1:19:43] medication cause abortion in the in the
[1:19:46] animal
[1:19:47] it can cause abortion in in human
[1:19:49] remembering when it is can lose the
[1:19:51] fetus so they use those trials so they
[1:19:53] set the animal
[1:19:54] look at the study the brain all the
[1:19:56] parts the neurons
[1:19:57] the nerves they look at them give them
[1:19:59] names many of them
[1:20:01] even when you study the human head right
[1:20:03] things about the head can blow your mind
[1:20:05] you have thousands of things in the
[1:20:07] brain nests doctors and those who study
[1:20:09] medicine
[1:20:09] they've got they have to dissect them
[1:20:11] and turn in the nitty-gritty of every
[1:20:13] part of their brain
[1:20:14] what they do but then it's only one
[1:20:16] person if you come to the stomach
[1:20:18] of course still the hands the nerves the
[1:20:20] veins the arteries
[1:20:21] there are many of them but they belong
[1:20:23] to one person
[1:20:25] there's no thousand thousand persons
[1:20:28] it's one rabbit
[1:20:29] it's got many parts it's got a foot it's
[1:20:31] got hands and the head and yes
[1:20:33] but it's one rabbit so the same thing
[1:20:36] the lord
[1:20:36] has got many forms of manifestation but
[1:20:39] it's only one lord
[1:20:41] one christ one holy ghost amen so
[1:20:44] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:20:46] there was only one book of life the at
[1:20:48] the
[1:20:49] la the lamb's book of life is the true
[1:20:50] book of life
[1:20:52] now the the book of life the earthly
[1:20:54] life is just a shadow
[1:20:56] to represent god on earth so that god
[1:20:59] can manifest
[1:21:00] in just like brotherhood i can see by
[1:21:01] the ghost way and the shade is wearing
[1:21:04] i can see him in the image of the
[1:21:07] but it's not too red ah sui
[1:21:08] if you want to look at it you can look
[1:21:10] at his shirt as one separate being
[1:21:12] and himself as another separate being
[1:21:13] but it's one person
[1:21:15] so the lord is not different from jesus
[1:21:17] christ
[1:21:18] jesus christ christ elohim jehovah
[1:21:22] is the self same person oh israel the
[1:21:25] lord that god is one
[1:21:26] that is only one god now the hebrew
[1:21:28] second word in hebrew
[1:21:30] means beth betha beth means
[1:21:34] it's a house god want to manifest just
[1:21:37] like
[1:21:38] god wants to manifest himself in more
[1:21:40] attributes he couldn't just remain
[1:21:42] elohim all of us were in him in a
[1:21:44] celestial world but he wanted to also be
[1:21:46] earthly person
[1:21:47] so the lord created a being called
[1:21:49] melchizedek
[1:21:50] called adam called brother solomon
[1:21:53] called by the caliph
[1:21:54] called sister lois to live in those
[1:21:56] earth to manifest himself
[1:21:58] so god is duplicating himself so one
[1:22:01] person
[1:22:02] but he's got the power of duality amen
[1:22:05] he's got the power to multiply himself
[1:22:08] it's just like 1 times one times one
[1:22:10] times one times one is what
[1:22:12] one that is what god the lord does
[1:22:15] so we are one it doesn't matter you're
[1:22:18] feminine we have got the same spirit
[1:22:20] that's why when you see your brother why
[1:22:22] are we gathered together
[1:22:23] is it because all of us like a certain
[1:22:24] type of food or we go for motorbiking
[1:22:27] people are
[1:22:28] doing motorbiking at this time because
[1:22:30] they belong to that club
[1:22:31] there's something that put them together
[1:22:32] unite them together they all love
[1:22:34] motorbikes
[1:22:35] they put on their bandera and you know
[1:22:37] go have fun wear their jeans and cowboy
[1:22:39] and whatever what have you
[1:22:41] gonna have barbecue go and have fun
[1:22:43] somewhere you know do motorbiking with
[1:22:45] your wives and girlfriends and
[1:22:47] different things something bind them
[1:22:49] together
[1:22:50] some people are talking about business
[1:22:51] as we are sitting here starting business
[1:22:52] and talking about how to create jobs
[1:22:55] how to take over the vaccine how to
[1:22:57] invest in vaccine because this vaccine
[1:22:58] is going to be a big investment
[1:23:00] how to buy stocks there's something that
[1:23:02] bind them together
[1:23:03] money they are trying to make money
[1:23:06] they've all got the same mind their mind
[1:23:07] of money
[1:23:08] so they are making uh business maneuvers
[1:23:11] to get the best out of money
[1:23:13] companies are doing different things as
[1:23:14] we are here different companies are
[1:23:16] trying to
[1:23:17] see how best they can drain from the
[1:23:18] coronal situation
[1:23:20] because their mind is what money so what
[1:23:23] binds you and i
[1:23:24] we are here together it's not because we
[1:23:26] like certain food or we wear certain
[1:23:27] type of
[1:23:28] clothes or we are from the same place
[1:23:29] it's because of what one spirit
[1:23:32] one baptism one christ one calling
[1:23:35] one holy ghost baptism that is why what
[1:23:37] that is what binds us together
[1:23:39] as a body of christ amen and that spirit
[1:23:43] is the supernatural spirit it's got a
[1:23:46] power beyond
[1:23:47] everything that you can think about
[1:23:50] the lord is not limited the holy spirit
[1:23:52] is not limited
[1:23:54] it's not limited to yesterday's
[1:23:55] situation the lord did this yesterday
[1:23:58] but this situation is so it's just like
[1:24:00] it's pinning my head around the same
[1:24:03] lord who did what he did yesterday
[1:24:05] is the same lord who is doing this for
[1:24:06] you today only you have to put your
[1:24:09] trust in him
[1:24:10] you have to believe him in you amen
[1:24:14] so jesus taught his disciples to believe
[1:24:16] him in them
[1:24:18] he said they came to ask him lord where
[1:24:20] is the kingdom of god some say the
[1:24:22] kingdom of god is in the west
[1:24:23] it's in the east it's in this church
[1:24:25] it's in this assembly is in this
[1:24:27] congregation saying no
[1:24:28] no no no the kingdom of god is in
[1:24:31] you and your prophet with abraham said
[1:24:34] that whatever you need for your earthly
[1:24:36] journey
[1:24:37] whatever you ever need if you need a jet
[1:24:40] flight if you need a rocket
[1:24:42] to fly to the moon i was in houston i
[1:24:45] think uh 2012
[1:24:46] they were talking about going to mass i
[1:24:48] think mass the year
[1:24:49] 2035 and i said this for a professor and
[1:24:52] they were kids said some of you be going
[1:24:53] to mass
[1:24:55] now man is thinking about going to mass
[1:24:57] if man
[1:24:58] want to go to mass then there should be
[1:25:00] something in mind
[1:25:01] to produce what it takes to go to mass
[1:25:04] that's a man who is falling i'm not
[1:25:06] talking about man who's got the holy
[1:25:07] ghost in him
[1:25:08] this is an earthly man who's using his
[1:25:10] intellectual regardless of his fallen
[1:25:12] estate
[1:25:13] he's still a son of god a daughter of
[1:25:15] god and he can create
[1:25:16] a machine a capsule that can move him
[1:25:19] from earth
[1:25:20] he's already gone to the moon now he's
[1:25:22] thinking about going toward
[1:25:23] going to mass if a a
[1:25:26] falling son of god is thinking about
[1:25:27] going to mass how about you
[1:25:31] how about you standing upright what are
[1:25:34] you doing
[1:25:34] amen what's your objective you can't
[1:25:37] believe god for simple things
[1:25:42] man is thinking about going to mass and
[1:25:44] i believe they'll do it
[1:25:45] right how about you and i you should be
[1:25:48] able to speak things into creation
[1:25:51] it shouldn't be something unusual in
[1:25:53] your life
[1:25:54] when it becomes necessary you speak it
[1:25:58] when it's needful in your life you speak
[1:26:01] it
[1:26:02] when you come to a situation that you
[1:26:03] can't move forward anymore
[1:26:05] then you have to go with a spoken word
[1:26:08] there was a time in jesus christ life
[1:26:10] was preaching the gospel
[1:26:11] the devil annoying people to persecute
[1:26:13] him they wanted to literally kill him
[1:26:15] and that was their purpose but it wasn't
[1:26:17] time yet right
[1:26:18] so you'll be preaching and tell them
[1:26:19] that before you destroy he said
[1:26:21] look at this temple before salam
[1:26:25] before abraham was i am before abraham
[1:26:29] you were right josue before abraham
[1:26:31] lincoln was here you were here
[1:26:33] how come so they gathered like biggest
[1:26:36] stone they wanted to
[1:26:37] and you just like passed through them
[1:26:38] what do you think they passed through
[1:26:39] them or you went under the puppet and
[1:26:41] hide
[1:26:41] and went to the chair oh don't tell me
[1:26:43] please but please don't stone me
[1:26:45] no that wasn't that he knew who he was
[1:26:49] that he was the son of god that christ
[1:26:51] is in him
[1:26:52] so he goes inward to look at the christ
[1:26:55] in him
[1:26:56] and that is where his faith is the
[1:26:57] christ in him and his body
[1:26:59] breaking into the gases into the atoms
[1:27:02] they couldn't see him no more he wasn't
[1:27:04] in here he breaks it into the atoms
[1:27:06] and he appeared in okeechobee preaching
[1:27:08] their word in okeechobee
[1:27:11] that spoken word was in jesus christ and
[1:27:14] that spoken word
[1:27:14] is in you brother salomon he's seen is
[1:27:17] your sister mary seeing you
[1:27:19] uh sister elise is in all of us brother
[1:27:21] brother
[1:27:22] all of you brothers and sisters is in
[1:27:24] every one of us they seem not a
[1:27:25] different spoken word not the last
[1:27:27] one but the same spoken word that was
[1:27:29] able to bring jesus flesh
[1:27:31] into the atoms and put them back
[1:27:34] together
[1:27:35] by the same spoken word it's in you my
[1:27:37] sisters and whatever you need is as a
[1:27:39] daughter of god
[1:27:40] you don't have to be the pastor you
[1:27:41] don't have to be the high priest you
[1:27:42] don't have to be the prophet you don't
[1:27:44] have to be
[1:27:44] you have to be a son or a daughter of
[1:27:46] god and whatever is in your heart
[1:27:48] you speaking from your heart and the
[1:27:50] creative forces
[1:27:52] that was in your father jesus christ the
[1:27:54] same critic forces in you
[1:27:55] and it will bring your need into
[1:27:56] manifestation
[1:27:58] that's what the lord has put you here
[1:27:59] for speak the word
[1:28:02] that's what your problem is for the
[1:28:04] problem that is troubling you
[1:28:06] that is on your head you go to bed that
[1:28:07] problem is there whatever it is

[1:30:47] the same holy ghost is here amen the
[1:30:50] lord is all singing
[1:30:52] one time israel i think one of the
[1:30:53] nations they had trouble with israel i
[1:30:55] think it's

[1:30:58] whenever they plan

[1:31:01] jew to go and attack the jews
[1:31:04] they happy that the jew the king of
[1:31:06] israel hears
[1:31:07] the plan of um a forgotten nation
[1:31:11] syria and so he was the king was
[1:31:13] troubled who among you is a spy today
[1:31:16] today today is right
[1:31:17] today jewish people he said no king
[1:31:20] nobody says fire none of your subject is
[1:31:22] inspired
[1:31:22] as pie what happens is what is we plan
[1:31:25] and speak in our bed chamber
[1:31:27] there's a prophet and that prophet
[1:31:30] the almighty lives in him
[1:31:34] the one beyond amoya lives in him and
[1:31:36] what you speak in your secret chamber
[1:31:38] he'll be there watching you when you are
[1:31:42] speaking
[1:31:45] go back to israel he's not there
[1:31:47] physically but it's a dimensional being
[1:31:50] so his dimension the christ in him we
[1:31:52] hear what you are planning okay we're
[1:31:54] going to
[1:31:54] we're going to ambush them in ogotobi
[1:31:56] this is the way they do okay this is the
[1:31:57] way you you are captain do this you are
[1:31:59] going to do this
[1:31:59] when they are coming you go this right
[1:32:01] go to the left you're going to have
[1:32:02] hundred people here
[1:32:03] stationed here 200 here you'll be able
[1:32:05] to kill the 100 people
[1:32:06] you are the next force to attack and now
[1:32:10] elijah elijah honor another prophet come
[1:32:11] and tell the king of israel hey
[1:32:13] you are in trouble syria is planning
[1:32:15] against you
[1:32:16] they want to kill you and they dismantle
[1:32:18] their plan
[1:32:19] why elohim was in elijah
[1:32:22] and elijah so what they planned elohim
[1:32:25] reveal it to elijah
[1:32:26] or elijah whoever was it and then he
[1:32:29] still the king of israel
[1:32:30] but greater than greater than elisha is
[1:32:33] here
[1:32:34] greater than elijah is here greater than
[1:32:36] solomon is here
[1:32:37] greater than david is here the lord
[1:32:39] jesus christ himself is in your flesh
[1:32:42] greater than william abraham is here
[1:32:44] amen people cannot go beyond
[1:32:46] people think the lord jesus christ died
[1:32:49] when will abram died
[1:32:51] the prophet like the bible said prophet
[1:32:53] god unto the people yes
[1:32:55] i know families that were broken when
[1:32:56] babraham died it's like god has died
[1:32:59] right on on the universe people used to
[1:33:02] go to the to the graveyard
[1:33:03] especially was going to arise because
[1:33:05] they saw a man who's speaking to
[1:33:07] creation
[1:33:08] a man when something you've got
[1:33:09] something missing he can tell you that
[1:33:11] oh your wallet is here
[1:33:13] your horses are here he can tell you
[1:33:15] things that you don't know he can tell
[1:33:16] you things from your ancestry
[1:33:18] this disease is coming from your
[1:33:19] generation you can tell you that it's
[1:33:21] coming from your father's
[1:33:22] side you can tell the secret of your
[1:33:23] heart so when this man died
[1:33:25] their hopes were shattered but they
[1:33:27] didn't know the lord is about to give
[1:33:28] more
[1:33:29] just like solomon just like samson
[1:33:31] samson was attacked by the seven church
[1:33:33] ages
[1:33:33] samson had seven locks woven on his head
[1:33:37] that was the seven church ages but the
[1:33:38] lord finished with the seven church
[1:33:40] edges
[1:33:40] and move into the eighth day in the
[1:33:42] eight they don't have to have seven logs
[1:33:44] you don't have to have a you have to
[1:33:46] have the spoken word in you
[1:33:47] you have to have the third pool amen the
[1:33:50] lord was bringing more than the seven
[1:33:51] church ages
[1:33:52] and that is the omega age amen so after
[1:33:55] the seven church ages
[1:33:56] uh after samson's er seven lots were cut
[1:33:59] off
[1:34:00] and the enemy thought oh i've got this
[1:34:01] guy the black is ice
[1:34:03] what is an eye seer who's a seer
[1:34:06] a prophet so when the prophet was taken
[1:34:09] away from the earth
[1:34:11] families were shattered ministries were
[1:34:13] shouted
[1:34:14] people like we're mourning like almighty
[1:34:16] is dead there's not god anymore
[1:34:19] we can't pray to nobody anymore william
[1:34:21] brahma is not here anymore
[1:34:22] but the lord jesus christ was still the
[1:34:25] lord jesus christ
[1:34:26] and it's like the lord jesus christ amen
[1:34:29] and the lord jesus christ especially
[1:34:30] abraham to resurrect they went to the uh
[1:34:33] he's going to resurrect somewhere go in
[1:34:35] their families going dead
[1:34:36] we know you're going to rise you're
[1:34:38] going to rise and ride the trail we're
[1:34:39] going to rise and bring build the tent
[1:34:41] and they went for a year and they keep
[1:34:44] going
[1:34:45] and they go to a place no no the man is
[1:34:47] gone the lord has now finished with him
[1:34:49] but the lord is looking up to you you
[1:34:52] are elisha
[1:34:53] you have to get the mantle of elijah you
[1:34:56] follow him to get his mantle
[1:34:58] and when you get a mantle you become him
[1:35:01] amen so when elijah died elijah actually
[1:35:03] didn't die
[1:35:04] it wasn't a flesh elijah it was a man to
[1:35:06] the anointing
[1:35:07] and the same anointing came upon elijah
[1:35:10] so elijah was actually elijah in
[1:35:12] manifestation amen
[1:35:14] it's just a different flesh the same
[1:35:16] only goes in william brahm
[1:35:18] in elijah the teach bite in john the
[1:35:20] baptist in jesus of nazareth
[1:35:22] in mexico appeared to abraham in abraham
[1:35:25] in sarah in hana
[1:35:26] in elizabeth in esther the same holy
[1:35:28] ghost is in you
[1:35:30] amen and when you believe with all your
[1:35:32] heart when you surrender to him
[1:35:34] the same thing can manifest in you amen
[1:35:36] and the lord has you here at this time
[1:35:38] this difficult time
[1:35:39] politically socially economically
[1:35:41] whatever wise you know society-wise
[1:35:44] everything seems to be broken this is
[1:35:45] the time the lord found it purposeful to
[1:35:47] put you right here on earth
[1:35:49] so that you can manifest the third pool
[1:35:52] you can manifest
[1:35:53] the spoken word you can manifest the a
[1:35:56] day
[1:35:57] you can manifest after the seven
[1:35:58] churches are done you are more than the
[1:36:00] seven church churches
[1:36:02] greater than seven churches are here
[1:36:03] amen greater than
[1:36:06] the hair of solomon is here no solomon
[1:36:08] they have to uh no sorry no solomon uh
[1:36:10] samson
[1:36:10] they have to play their head no they go
[1:36:12] to the place they didn't have any head
[1:36:14] to think about but the eyes were a
[1:36:16] plaque off
[1:36:17] now the intelligence himself the
[1:36:20] intelligence which is what
[1:36:21] christ himself christ was the one who
[1:36:24] was using the hair
[1:36:24] as a symbol it wasn't the herpes but
[1:36:27] there was an anointing
[1:36:29] under the head so now christ doesn't
[1:36:31] want to use symbols no more
[1:36:32] right no more he's not sending messages
[1:36:35] anymore he's
[1:36:36] done with the seven churches messengers
[1:36:38] by himself he's dealing with his wife
[1:36:40] directly
[1:36:41] glory hallelujah and so you don't need
[1:36:44] to
[1:36:45] you don't need to have a bishop to pray
[1:36:48] for the lord to hear your prayer
[1:36:51] you need to what have christ in you for
[1:36:54] the lord to hear your prayer
[1:36:56] you need to have do you need to be
[1:36:57] anointed by the word you need to be born
[1:36:58] again number one
[1:36:59] and when you are born again you keep
[1:37:01] eating the word eat more than your
[1:37:03] portions
[1:37:04] it's something that will that will shake
[1:37:06] you you hear something in the word of
[1:37:08] the lord that
[1:37:09] shakes you i've never seen this before
[1:37:11] it lifts you up higher
[1:37:12] and you keep eating it building a weird
[1:37:14] body and what you eat
[1:37:16] you become what you eat you are eating
[1:37:18] the spoken word of god so what do you
[1:37:19] become
[1:37:21] spoken word so when you speak what
[1:37:23] happens
[1:37:25] you eat a creator so when you when you
[1:37:28] eat a creature you become what
[1:37:30] and so when you speak what happens you
[1:37:32] create
[1:37:33] amen and that is what the lord is
[1:37:35] looking for for in us
[1:37:37] he's not looking for nothing complicated
[1:37:38] from you he's not asking you to build a
[1:37:40] firmament
[1:37:42] if there's a need you can build one amen
[1:37:45] if you need to move here to russia you
[1:37:48] can do it
[1:37:49] amen there'll be a playstation there for
[1:37:51] you
[1:37:52] to move to russia if you need to break
[1:37:54] your atom your body atoms
[1:37:56] and appear in russia and speak to a
[1:37:58] sister in russia
[1:38:00] or a brother in russia the holy ghost in
[1:38:02] you can do that
[1:38:03] amen you might not need a jet plane you
[1:38:06] might not need putin's permission
[1:38:07] you might be in russia to preach the
[1:38:09] word and take your body back and come
[1:38:10] back to the u.s
[1:38:11] putin will not even know about it that
[1:38:14] is what the lord has made you to be
[1:38:15] amen we don't have we don't need the
[1:38:18] economy of u.s
[1:38:20] i'm not saying that if economic goes we
[1:38:22] want the economy to be good
[1:38:23] but whether the economy is bad or good
[1:38:25] you are not depending upon the economy
[1:38:27] how they balance the economy
[1:38:28] how they think oh you're going to have a
[1:38:30] recession no
[1:38:32] you live beyond recession you live

[1:38:39] that is in you
[1:38:40] is greater than the coronavirus here
[1:38:43] that is in you is greater than the bad
[1:38:44] economy
[1:38:45] he that is in you is greater than the
[1:38:47] joblessness in the society now
[1:38:49] he that is in you is greater than the
[1:38:50] food stamps you have got the creative
[1:38:53] force of christ in you
[1:38:54] and you stand as a daughter of god and
[1:38:56] as the son of god
[1:38:58] and you speak and move forward you can't
[1:39:00] go back
[1:39:01] no the back is sealed the lord wants you
[1:39:04] to move forward
[1:39:05] in your faith whatever you need is in
[1:39:07] you your family your loved ones

[1:55:06] i guess as well i was telling you sister
[1:55:09] birds one time about
[1:55:11] a song coming to you and the different
[1:55:14] songs from
[1:55:15] from a tape that i picked up the day
[1:55:18] before i moved to south carolina
[1:55:20] [Music]
[1:55:22] it was one of the darkest hours i guess
[1:55:25] just about to start
[1:55:26] in my life because i had been serving
[1:55:28] the lord about three
[1:55:29] three years back in march of 2000
[1:55:34] and uh my my trial had already begun i
[1:55:37] lost my car and everything and
[1:55:39] i bought a 300 car a station wagon
[1:55:43] imagine me in a station way
[1:55:45] i called it big dusty and one night um
[1:55:50] i was working at a tour bus company i
[1:55:53] was a maintenance manager
[1:55:55] i went with the owner down in orlando
[1:55:56] and that night
[1:55:58] about one o'clock i was driving home on
[1:56:01] i-85
[1:56:02] and i was singing a little song bueller
[1:56:04] land
[1:56:06] and i was just you know just
[1:56:09] broken up because my trial had begun and
[1:56:12] as i was singing that song it was
[1:56:14] pouring down
[1:56:15] raining and i didn't know that there was
[1:56:17] a diesel fuel
[1:56:19] spill in the middle of the road and as i
[1:56:22] was driving
[1:56:24] i was singing the song of beulah land
[1:56:27] and then all of a sudden my car started
[1:56:28] spinning
[1:56:30] and i was singing bueller land i went up
[1:56:32] and hit a bank
[1:56:34] still singing beulah land i started
[1:56:36] spinning back going straight back
[1:56:38] towards the other side of the road and i
[1:56:41] was just
[1:56:42] still singing beulah and i looked to my
[1:56:44] left and i saw
[1:56:45] lights there was 18 wheeler coming
[1:56:47] directly at me
[1:56:50] i was still singing a song the 18
[1:56:53] wheeler hit me
[1:56:54] crushed the car and i went back up
[1:56:56] against the bank
[1:56:58] and i was still singing bueller and
[1:57:02] by the time the car stopped i was
[1:57:04] singing bueller and i stopped
[1:57:06] did that truck hit me so i got up and i
[1:57:09] ran
[1:57:10] up to the truck to see if they were okay
[1:57:13] i was thinking i wasn't afraid at all
[1:57:17] of what was going on it was like the
[1:57:20] presence of the lord came and that gave
[1:57:22] me such a peace during that time that
[1:57:24] there was no fear at all and i got hit
[1:57:27] by 18 wheeler i mean
[1:57:28] it came and hit here totally crushed
[1:57:31] that car
[1:57:33] and so much when my pastor and his wife
[1:57:35] came to my house after they told her
[1:57:37] that
[1:57:37] she looked at the car and she cried like
[1:57:39] a baby because
[1:57:41] i should have been dead but i didn't
[1:57:42] have one skull
[1:57:44] just singing a little song it was one of
[1:57:48] those songs that
[1:57:49] i don't think i ever sung it in church
[1:57:51] before i was singing it at that time
[1:57:53] because i was just
[1:57:54] learning it because of the different
[1:57:56] trials that i want
[1:57:57] i would like to try and sing that right
[1:57:59] now
