[44:31] everyone in the house of the
[44:34] Lord
[44:35] amen we're going to
[44:38] read from John
[44:44] 3:16 very familiar passage of
[44:52] scripture uh I don't know if it's
[44:55] possible to overuse the
[44:58] scripture but this scripture has been
[45:02] used at football games and all kind of
[45:06] things
[45:08] and and uh but we're going to just look
[45:12] at this scripture a little bit
[45:15] deeper amen it says it reads on this
[45:18] wise for God so loved the
[45:22] world that he gave his only begotten son
[45:28] that whosoever believeth in him should
[45:32] not perish but have everlasting life may
[45:36] the Lord add a blessing to the reading
[45:38] of his word you may be
[45:41] seated
[45:46] amen it's been a while since I've had
[45:49] the opportunity to be before you amen
[45:52] the last time I ministered was at my
[45:56] mother's eulogy
[45:59] and the last time I ministered here was
[46:03] the day she took
[46:06] ill I
[46:09] uh just kind of needed
[46:16] time but God has a
[46:20] way Amen to get you past these things
[46:24] and it's time to move on
[46:31] yes
[46:33] amen even
[46:37] now little choked up
[46:41] but uh God is good he am he is certainly
[46:48] good and
[46:53] uh it's a blessing to be here amen
[46:57] amen I want to this message this morning
[47:00] and I it's going to be a little
[47:02] different
[47:03] from what you usually see of me brother
[47:07] Willie last week he kind of say you know
[47:09] ministers will get up and we try to amen
[47:12] we get into a rhythm get into a
[47:15] flow but the Lord has just laid on my
[47:19] heart to just come at just a little bit
[47:23] different amen
[47:27] I'm G to preach on the transformative
[47:31] power of love amen amen amen the
[47:38] transformative
[47:39] power of love and I'm going to try not
[47:43] to do too much
[47:44] reading but there's a lot of quotes and
[47:47] different things from the
[47:49] prophet and a lot of scriptures and
[47:52] different
[47:54] things that help me to get out of the
[47:56] way I just want you to uh hear what the
[48:01] Lord is
[48:04] saying the prophet said this message
[48:08] came from the message called love he
[48:09] preached it in
[48:12] 1958
[48:14] ironically on March
[48:17] 14th which is my wife's
[48:23] birthday he says here he says
[48:28] uh reading John 3:16 tonight although
[48:32] small in its portion holds enough value
[48:36] to save the
[48:38] world it's got enough value in
[48:42] it to heal every sick
[48:47] person that's on the Earth
[48:50] today it's a pardon to every
[48:54] sinner it's Joy
[48:57] to every weary
[48:59] person it's hope for the
[49:03] Hopeless it's food for the
[49:07] saint it's healing for the
[49:11] sick it's pardon to those who are
[49:16] troubled it's all these things to
[49:20] you if
[49:22] you receive it as that it's talking
[49:26] about love
[49:28] if you receive it as
[49:30] that now the prophet in this message was
[49:34] talking
[49:35] about uh the pardon the man that had
[49:40] done the crime and he was guilty of
[49:43] doing a
[49:45] crime and uh he was supposed to go
[49:49] before a firing
[49:52] squad but uh it says in here that he had
[49:56] had a friend who cared for
[49:59] him and that
[50:01] friend uh went
[50:03] to the President Abraham
[50:07] Lincoln and
[50:10] pleaded on his
[50:12] behalf to be
[50:14] [Music]
[50:16] pardoned I wonder how
[50:19] many of us in here this
[50:24] morning would go through those
[50:27] measures for
[50:29] the another brother or
[50:35] sister that we would go
[50:40] before and
[50:43] plead for one
[50:47] another one that might be going through
[50:50] something yes yes yes and go before the
[50:54] Lord
[50:56] and asked the Lord to just pardon my
[51:00] brother right or my
[51:04] sister but this man had such love in his
[51:10] heart for this fellow he went to the
[51:14] president and
[51:18] pleaded for his
[51:22] pardon he stood in the gap for his
[51:26] friend
[51:27] amen now the prophet preached that
[51:30] message standing in the
[51:34] Gap I don't want to get ahead of myself
[51:37] but he says in order to stand in the
[51:42] Gap there has to
[51:45] be a love there to be
[51:50] qualified to stand in the gap
[51:56] it was the love of
[52:01] Christ amen the love of God I should
[52:04] say that
[52:07] produced
[52:09] Christ to stand in the Gap yes sir for
[52:13] the human
[52:14] race you see when perfect
[52:18] Love Takes
[52:21] Over It
[52:24] produces amen
[52:27] Grace yes sir
[52:30] Christ is
[52:32] Grace the love of
[52:37] God to us word produced
[52:42] Christ to
[52:45] Pardon our
[52:47] sins are you with me this morning
[52:53] amen however we see in this little story
[52:56] here
[52:59] the
[53:00] man didn't receive it right
[53:05] why because it came so
[53:10] simple this can't be from the president
[53:14] it's just something scribbled on some
[53:18] paper and he didn't believe
[53:23] it and he had to go before the firing
[53:26] Squad but he had the pardon yes he did
[53:30] in his
[53:32] hand all he had to do was
[53:36] receive the
[53:41] pardon I'll say this morning that we
[53:44] here
[53:45] today all we have to do is receive the
[53:50] pardon I don't care what you're going
[53:52] through
[53:56] what you might have
[53:58] done what you
[54:02] might do in the
[54:05] future that blood never loses its power
[54:09] amen
[54:11] hallelujah some 2,000 years ago on
[54:15] Calvary
[54:16] Hill amen it was shed for you and
[54:20] I to buy
[54:23] paron amen
[54:26] the prophet says said now there's two
[54:28] different types of
[54:30] love I think brother Willie hit on this
[54:33] last week or week before when you preach
[54:36] last week week before one of them he was
[54:38] talking about that filio love and that
[54:40] agapy
[54:42] love said that filio
[54:46] love is that one that uh had the one you
[54:50] have for your
[54:52] wife it'll make a man flirt
[54:57] with her or insult
[55:01] her you shoot his brains out over
[55:08] her filing your
[55:11] love accompanies
[55:16] jealousy and it'll make you do all kind
[55:19] of things
[55:23] unseemly but that agapy love
[55:27] would make you
[55:29] pray for his sinful
[55:33] Soul the difference between the two
[55:36] loves God loves God's love is the
[55:41] beginning of love it's the Fountain of
[55:44] love and the
[55:46] church today is lacking
[55:51] that that
[55:53] real agape love
[55:58] that makes you have love for your
[56:04] enemy I ain't even talking about your
[56:06] brother and sister but your
[56:13] enemy he goes on and he says if we only
[56:16] had that kind of love there'd be a
[56:20] Revival this nation from coast to
[56:24] coast and from north to south
[56:28] and the reason that we don't have that
[56:32] love that is the main reason the church
[56:35] is not progressing like it
[56:42] should he said we don't need
[56:47] theology we only need
[56:50] real love to go with the theology
[56:58] he say We'll
[57:00] argue about many things whether that we
[57:02] should be baptized backwards or forward
[57:06] or whatever
[57:07] more but that don't make any
[57:10] difference how we're
[57:14] baptized or what church you belong to or
[57:18] what evidences that you might that you
[57:21] have you're a Christian if you haven't
[57:26] got love you haven't got
[57:36] God he said you haven't got love you
[57:39] haven't got God see you see we we we we
[57:43] we got see the devil's
[57:49] sneaking love produces
[57:56] we're we're we're we're we're we're
[57:58] we're we're we're we're in
[58:01] between we're we're we're
[58:03] traveling from one place to another and
[58:06] as our pastor would would would would
[58:09] would describe it we're in the
[58:13] hallway but I just
[58:16] believe that he's waiting on us yes sir
[58:21] yeah
[58:23] amen can you hear me amen I
[58:27] believe
[58:33] because the
[58:35] church is not the
[58:39] building right the church the beauty of
[58:42] the
[58:44] church is the
[58:46] character of the
[58:50] people what good would it do us to go
[58:54] into a
[58:56] building stained glass windows plush
[59:01] peels steeple fresh paint on the wall
[59:05] and we don't have love for one
[59:08] [Music]
[59:10] another what good are we to
[59:16] anybody to the community at
[59:19] large to all of our individual families
[59:25] yes to one
[59:28] another there are real problems before
[59:34] us we come to this building and we we we
[59:39] come and we worship
[59:41] together we we we sing
[59:44] together we pray
[59:47] together but in many cases we don't have
[59:50] real love for one
[59:54] another love would produce things yes
[1:00:02] sir it would cause the
[1:00:06] supernatural to be in our
[1:00:10] midst when you have love one for the
[1:00:16] other
[1:00:18] it'll when you have love for one
[1:00:23] another it causes God to
[1:00:33] move we look at this young fell honor
[1:00:36] Von
[1:00:37] Winkler for many that many familiar with
[1:00:41] the story yes but for those of you who
[1:00:44] are not I'll bring you up to
[1:00:48] speed he lived in Switzerland many years
[1:00:51] ago
[1:00:52] Switzerland a little group had pulled
[1:00:55] away from from Germany and started a
[1:00:57] little economy to themselves up in the
[1:01:01] mountains
[1:01:03] Switzerland they wasn't a Waring
[1:01:07] people the prophet called them a
[1:01:09] peaceful people but all of a sudden
[1:01:12] there came a war against
[1:01:14] him and the Swiss they got their old
[1:01:18] rocks and
[1:01:20] sickles things like that they wasn't a
[1:01:23] fighting people they didn't they didn't
[1:01:25] even have have an
[1:01:29] army and
[1:01:32] uh they were standing there this great
[1:01:36] army machine of
[1:01:39] Germany came uh marching up on them
[1:01:43] coming like a brick wall this is
[1:01:45] description of the
[1:01:47] Prophet they didn't have a
[1:01:50] chance but there was one this anavan
[1:01:53] Winkler kissed his wife and his babies
[1:01:56] goodbye a few hours
[1:01:58] before he went to
[1:02:00] battle he loved his home he loved his
[1:02:04] Nation therefore his love constrained
[1:02:08] him to do something about
[1:02:13] it he said to the rest of the army he
[1:02:17] said come follow
[1:02:21] me he says uh get your your your your
[1:02:26] your your your your your arms and things
[1:02:28] and just follow me what are you going to
[1:02:32] do and he threw up his arms and he
[1:02:35] looked towards the deepest of the
[1:02:38] Spears and he marched on like this great
[1:02:41] big they marched on like this great big
[1:02:43] wall and found the deepest Spear and he
[1:02:47] screamed Make Way for Liberty and he
[1:02:50] started running with his hands in the
[1:02:53] air and screamed again Make Way for
[1:02:59] liberty before he left his life he said
[1:03:04] across the mountain
[1:03:06] Yonder is a little white home and two
[1:03:11] little children and a sweet
[1:03:14] wife that I'll never see no more take
[1:03:18] care of
[1:03:19] them but I'll give my life to defend
[1:03:24] them amen sir amen love makes you do
[1:03:29] things and when the church gets the real
[1:03:34] love of God in their
[1:03:36] hearts they'll do
[1:03:38] things they'll not be
[1:03:42] ashamed Christ don't want you to be it
[1:03:46] isn't so much to be
[1:03:49] loyal he doesn't want your
[1:03:52] patronage he wants your fellowship yes
[1:03:55] amen amen amen that's what God wants is
[1:03:59] to have fellowship with you now aror Von
[1:04:04] Winkler he stood in the Gap yes he
[1:04:08] did for the nation in which he lived
[1:04:12] in the people uhh uh to finish the story
[1:04:16] they got so much
[1:04:18] courage after they saw what he
[1:04:21] did oh my they came in with the sickles
[1:04:24] and rocks and anything else they can
[1:04:26] find and they beat that Army
[1:04:29] back but he stood in the Gap sir amen
[1:04:32] and sacrificed his life amen for the
[1:04:37] love of that Nation
[1:04:45] Amen brother brandom was talking about
[1:04:48] that
[1:04:49] Maniac in uh Portland
[1:04:53] there and he gave the testimony
[1:04:57] about how
[1:04:59] uh the big maniac the guy
[1:05:03] was wanted to kill
[1:05:05] him and he would do it because he had
[1:05:08] killed
[1:05:11] before and he rushed out uh to the
[1:05:14] platform and brother Brandon was
[1:05:16] preaching there
[1:05:18] and he let out a big great big
[1:05:22] screen and he set his seat together his
[1:05:25] eyes pushed back and he started walking
[1:05:27] towards me and he said you hypocrite you
[1:05:31] snake in the
[1:05:33] grass upon this platform posing yourself
[1:05:36] as a servant of God you're nothing but a
[1:05:40] hypocrite everyone kept
[1:05:42] still about that time two policemen that
[1:05:47] I had led the Christ back in the
[1:05:49] dressing room run out to grab them and I
[1:05:52] mentioned to them I said this is not a
[1:05:55] Flesh and Blood
[1:05:58] Affair but the strange thing was that
[1:06:02] when the man went up there I wasn't
[1:06:06] afraid now perfect love cast out all
[1:06:13] fear the reason that people won't take
[1:06:15] God at his word for healing they don't
[1:06:18] love him well
[1:06:19] enough because you're
[1:06:22] scared he won't keep his word that's the
[1:06:25] reason the people fear somebody else
[1:06:27] will say something against them if they
[1:06:30] receive the Holy Spirit they're
[1:06:35] afraid somebody will laugh at me and
[1:06:38] make fun but when love comes
[1:06:44] in Joel
[1:06:47] 25 amen is sort of the theme of this
[1:06:53] year I will restore the
[1:06:56] years that the Locust has eaten the
[1:06:59] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[1:07:02] Palmer worm my great Army which I sent
[1:07:06] among
[1:07:07] you and they shall eat
[1:07:10] plenty and be
[1:07:13] satisfied and praise the name of the
[1:07:16] Lord your God and hath dealt wondrously
[1:07:21] with you and my people shall never never
[1:07:25] be
[1:07:27] ashamed shall never be
[1:07:31] ashamed so the prophet is going on and
[1:07:34] he is describing this issue he said the
[1:07:37] man got real close to me and the people
[1:07:40] just hushed and he draw back his great
[1:07:44] Hulk and he spit all over my
[1:07:49] face now I remember a while ago when uh
[1:07:53] brother Jack was sort of
[1:07:56] preaching on the same thing and I I can
[1:07:58] remember I was sitting back there and I
[1:08:00] say oh no Lord wait a
[1:08:02] minute I ain't ready cuz that fell spit
[1:08:06] on
[1:08:07] me he probably would have beat me
[1:08:11] down but see that's the difference when
[1:08:14] the Holy Ghost takes over yes sir
[1:08:17] exactly right see and see brother
[1:08:20] brandom he he was a boxer yes sir now he
[1:08:23] was no pushover
[1:08:25] right what no
[1:08:27] pushover but something that came over
[1:08:30] him in that moment that he was able to
[1:08:36] love that fell yes sir despite whatever
[1:08:39] he do now let's just look at this and
[1:08:42] look continue
[1:08:48] here he's the man uh uh let's see here
[1:08:52] lost my
[1:08:53] spot now it's got to be
[1:08:57] real no here we go okay he says you
[1:09:00] snake in the grass I'm going to show you
[1:09:03] how much servant of God you are I'm
[1:09:06] going to knock you into the middle of
[1:09:08] that
[1:09:09] audience he was well aable to do it
[1:09:13] too but he didn't know
[1:09:16] God that's what the the main thing I
[1:09:19] kept real still never said a thing and
[1:09:23] my heart was going out to him
[1:09:27] now you just can't imagine
[1:09:29] that it's got to be
[1:09:34] real the people have seen so much put on
[1:09:39] till they're sick and tired of it
[1:09:44] amen but what you are if you're a
[1:09:49] Christian be one God's grace will make
[1:09:53] you one
[1:09:56] and the man walked closer to me and I
[1:09:59] loved
[1:10:00] him CUA that I knew he didn't mean that
[1:10:05] I thought it's the devil that makes him
[1:10:08] makes that man say that those
[1:10:11] things he's a man who would love his
[1:10:15] family like I do
[1:10:18] mine he would like to eat and drink and
[1:10:21] fellowship but the thing of it is
[1:10:24] because the devil has possessed him he's
[1:10:28] a human
[1:10:30] being the same as I
[1:10:33] am those kinds of
[1:10:36] thoughts and you can't do that unless
[1:10:40] God does it for
[1:10:42] you and when he got close to me he drew
[1:10:47] back his arms and he said I'm going to
[1:10:50] knock you into the middle of that
[1:10:52] audience and break every bone in your
[1:10:54] little old frail body of
[1:10:56] yours I never opened my mouth and said a
[1:11:01] word but then all of a sudden something
[1:11:04] be to
[1:11:08] speak and the Holy Ghost began to
[1:11:11] speak and said because you have
[1:11:14] challenged the spirit of God
[1:11:17] tonight you'll fall over my
[1:11:21] feet there was both threats and
[1:11:26] prophecy and he said I'm going to knock
[1:11:29] you out into the middle of the audience
[1:11:31] the spirit of God said you'll fall over
[1:11:35] my
[1:11:36] feet and he said I'll show you whose
[1:11:38] feet I'll fall over and he drew back his
[1:11:41] arm to strike
[1:11:44] me and still there was no
[1:11:47] fear I wasn't there I I wasn't there
[1:11:51] because I wanted to be seen I was there
[1:11:54] with a Comm commission from God to the
[1:11:57] people and when he started to strike
[1:12:00] something appeared he said Satan leave
[1:12:03] the man and when he did his great eyes
[1:12:07] seemed to push back his teeth set
[1:12:11] together and he turned around and fell
[1:12:14] over my
[1:12:15] feet till the policeman had to come roll
[1:12:18] him
[1:12:18] off he said what was it love conquered
[1:12:23] the mightiest enemy amen
[1:12:26] there is on the face of the earth is
[1:12:30] love what a little inside now of
[1:12:37] life here the next testimony I
[1:12:41] have was the
[1:12:44] prophet in
[1:12:47] Mexico standing amen there uh 20,000
[1:12:53] came to Christ that night
[1:12:57] uh there was Catholic and
[1:13:00] evangelicals he saysi want you uh uh I
[1:13:04] want people who has never received
[1:13:09] Christ and they tagged
[1:13:12] 20,000 but there was a little woman down
[1:13:15] there screaming with a
[1:13:17] blanket
[1:13:19] amen and uh Billy was out there and they
[1:13:23] gave out the prayer cards and the people
[1:13:26] around 100 300
[1:13:28] ushers and the ushers couldn't keep that
[1:13:31] little woman
[1:13:32] out she was climbing over their backs
[1:13:35] many were familiar with the
[1:13:37] story her baby was dead in her
[1:13:41] arms but she had to get to the
[1:13:45] prophet see love will make you do
[1:13:50] things
[1:13:51] even when the child was dead
[1:13:56] the love of that
[1:13:59] mother wouldn't give
[1:14:01] up see love
[1:14:04] produces
[1:14:07] Supernatural I don't want to continue to
[1:14:09] be labeled just with all of these
[1:14:11] testimonies but I have
[1:14:15] many
[1:14:17] when my
[1:14:21] wife uh
[1:14:27] showed
[1:14:28] me what was going
[1:14:33] on with uh the tumors in the
[1:14:38] head
[1:14:41] and we seen them and she went on to the
[1:14:46] doctor and
[1:14:48] uh to get him
[1:14:51] biopsy and
[1:14:55] uh
[1:14:57] again we remember this from last time we
[1:15:00] had to
[1:15:01] wait for the
[1:15:04] diagnosis wait for the doctor's
[1:15:08] report I can remember the last time it
[1:15:11] was seven years
[1:15:13] ago
[1:15:15] and and
[1:15:19] uh waiting
[1:15:22] was it's it's it's
[1:15:25] I I can't say fear
[1:15:28] but you're just praying constantly
[1:15:32] Lord let it be
[1:15:37] negative but it came back
[1:15:41] positive well
[1:15:44] Lord we'll go from
[1:15:47] here and a lot of times
[1:15:51] when hear my wife's testimony
[1:15:55] and it
[1:15:56] just probably went all
[1:16:01] over and but they never hear the
[1:16:05] testimony of the
[1:16:10] husband what is he going through at this
[1:16:16] time so I sit there and I Lord how the
[1:16:23] devil is attacking my home
[1:16:27] how does that devil come
[1:16:29] in and attack my
[1:16:33] bride Lord what is
[1:16:37] this I begin to question
[1:16:40] why why Lord must she go through
[1:16:44] this
[1:16:47] again we had
[1:16:50] overcome the first time and we was
[1:16:54] still
[1:16:57] rejoicing and here come the Old Devil
[1:17:02] again but as I studied the
[1:17:08] scripture I knew I had to stand in the
[1:17:13] Gap
[1:17:15] amen I told l i you
[1:17:19] know said why
[1:17:21] her and not me
[1:17:27] why must she go through
[1:17:32] this maybe she handle it better than
[1:17:39] me but
[1:17:40] it it's a you know you have to continue
[1:17:44] to go about life's daily tasks but in
[1:17:48] your mind you're constantly
[1:17:51] Lord then you constantly ask are you
[1:17:53] okay you feel all right
[1:17:55] yeah I'm all right leave me
[1:17:58] alone all right I'm just checking just
[1:18:04] checking but you're
[1:18:09] concerned and in your mind you begin to
[1:18:11] go back and you think on
[1:18:14] life all of
[1:18:15] the different
[1:18:18] things the
[1:18:20] arguments the time where you say I'm not
[1:18:22] speaking
[1:18:26] and you say well Lord I didn't mean
[1:18:31] it I need a
[1:18:35] here Lord what would I
[1:18:38] do so you just begin to
[1:18:41] pray and ask
[1:18:44] God to touch your
[1:18:49] body you know when we
[1:18:53] was going through some things in my
[1:18:57] family and I read that story
[1:19:02] about aror Von
[1:19:05] Winkler and I can remember when I was
[1:19:08] going
[1:19:10] through and there was turmoil in the
[1:19:14] home the wife was
[1:19:17] upset the children was
[1:19:21] upset and it seemed like all of the guns
[1:19:25] was turned on the
[1:19:28] husband all of this is your
[1:19:32] fault you you
[1:19:35] you you did this you didn't do that you
[1:19:42] you
[1:19:43] you well wait a minute now I got up
[1:19:46] every morning I went to work I provided
[1:19:49] you had shoes on your feet clothes on
[1:19:51] your back refrigerator stayed full
[1:19:54] Transportation you had this you had that
[1:19:57] D but you you
[1:20:02] you and
[1:20:04] naturally you would want to defend
[1:20:07] yourself no you I'm not going to
[1:20:11] keep but I had to be there was a war
[1:20:15] going
[1:20:16] on and I had to be on oon
[1:20:20] Winkler I had to fall on the sword
[1:20:25] stop defending
[1:20:30] yourself you see when this Maniac came
[1:20:32] up to the prophet he loved him he never
[1:20:34] said a
[1:20:36] word and when I got that revelation we
[1:20:39] were talking brother Jack and I we were
[1:20:41] talking and it hit me say he said now
[1:20:43] you got
[1:20:45] it quit defending yourself cuz see now
[1:20:49] you defend
[1:20:51] yourself and then they defend their self
[1:20:54] and be see all you doing is stirring up
[1:20:57] the devil and he sit
[1:20:59] back they'll never come
[1:21:04] together but as
[1:21:06] being the stronger vessel the
[1:21:12] man Christ in the
[1:21:16] family you got to take that walk to
[1:21:21] calary for the sake of
[1:21:26] those that are saying you you you
[1:21:32] amen I had to fall on the
[1:21:36] sword not knowing what was
[1:21:40] coming I may have been right I'm sure in
[1:21:43] a lot of cases I wasn't
[1:21:46] right but I I I Lord whatever I have to
[1:21:51] do I take it to the children I'll take
[1:21:55] it what did I not do right what did I
[1:21:57] not do I'll take it I'll take it I'll
[1:22:01] take it I'll take it then I'll take it
[1:22:04] to the Lord in prayer am amen
[1:22:08] amen and we'll keep moving
[1:22:12] on reminded of a
[1:22:16] testimony with a
[1:22:19] prophet there was this
[1:22:23] man and his wife that the little girl
[1:22:26] was
[1:22:28] dying she was on the machine the machine
[1:22:30] was breathing
[1:22:32] for and they was trying to get the
[1:22:35] prophet please come pray for
[1:22:39] her and
[1:22:41] uh the prophet says well I I I don't
[1:22:44] know if uh I'll be able to make
[1:22:48] it he he he he he was they had to fly
[1:22:52] him in
[1:22:55] but he said when he finally got
[1:22:58] there the man if I'm not mistaken right
[1:23:01] the man was a
[1:23:03] minister and he
[1:23:06] said the church and all the man's
[1:23:09] friends was at the hospital
[1:23:13] entrance praying for this for this
[1:23:15] little
[1:23:16] girl and he said such a outpouring of
[1:23:20] Love such an outpouring of love
[1:23:26] touched
[1:23:27] him so he went
[1:23:29] in and they uh the nurses was in there
[1:23:33] with the little girl
[1:23:34] and they were uh had them oxygen on they
[1:23:38] said well you can come on in
[1:23:42] and he hadn't got anything from the
[1:23:47] Lord but while he was in there he had a
[1:23:51] vision and he saw a little girl playing
[1:23:56] and he goes on and says that the
[1:23:59] love of the people
[1:24:02] touched the heart of God
[1:24:06] Amen and Rose that little girl up off
[1:24:08] that sick
[1:24:10] bed there was another
[1:24:13] story where uh this man was
[1:24:19] ill
[1:24:21] and the
[1:24:23] wife uh was calling for brother
[1:24:26] brandham but the Lord told brother
[1:24:29] brandham he was praying for the man said
[1:24:33] tell
[1:24:35] him that he's going to die to get his
[1:24:39] life in
[1:24:43] order and there was he had another close
[1:24:47] friend and the close friend was talking
[1:24:50] to brother Brandon and he says there's
[1:24:53] nothing I can do
[1:24:56] do I I'm not a Healer I just I can I
[1:25:03] pray but we I've already gotten a word
[1:25:05] from the
[1:25:07] Lord and the man began to just
[1:25:10] weep and he said my buddy oh my
[1:25:15] buddy and brother brandom was off
[1:25:20] ministering and he was in his
[1:25:22] room and he had had woke waken up out of
[1:25:25] his sleep and he saw this lady sitting
[1:25:29] in the
[1:25:30] room and she had on very particular
[1:25:36] garment and he looked over and there was
[1:25:38] another
[1:25:39] man had on a very particular garment
[1:25:43] white suit with red tie this that and
[1:25:46] the other and she had on maybe a brown
[1:25:48] dress with a certain kind of
[1:25:51] coat and
[1:25:57] he said how did these people get in my
[1:25:59] room my door was locked so he said he
[1:26:02] bid himself to say ah this is a
[1:26:05] vision so the vision went for and the
[1:26:08] woman just looked over at him and smiled
[1:26:10] and the man looked over at him and
[1:26:14] smiled
[1:26:16] and it goes on and he woke
[1:26:19] up and he called and said uh is the
[1:26:23] people
[1:26:25] there is the wife there he says yes the
[1:26:29] man is he he he he'll be he'll be gone
[1:26:32] in a
[1:26:34] minute uh you won't be able to make
[1:26:39] it so he said put the wife is the wife
[1:26:42] wearing this they describe what she was
[1:26:46] wearing and the man does he wear says
[1:26:49] well you you described them to the tea
[1:26:51] and he said put the wife on the phone
[1:26:56] and he told her your husband shall live
[1:27:00] as thus saith the
[1:27:05] Lord right naturally the woman's
[1:27:07] confused cuz you said a while ago that
[1:27:09] he was going to die that to make ready
[1:27:12] she says but the
[1:27:14] love hello of his friend yes
[1:27:18] sir touch the heart of God
[1:27:25] and the Lord answered the
[1:27:31] prayer the message standing in the
[1:27:35] Gap the Prophet this was a few months
[1:27:39] after the
[1:27:41] seals and the prophet
[1:27:45] was like of a better word
[1:27:49] upset because the people wouldn't
[1:27:52] believe they didn't see it they didn't
[1:27:54] quite grasp what was going
[1:27:57] on and he kind of got to a point where
[1:27:59] he said I'm just going to go out into
[1:28:01] the woods and be a uh a guide ready to
[1:28:05] leave the
[1:28:08] field and I if I have the story all
[1:28:12] quite right I don't want to just keep
[1:28:14] reading
[1:28:15] it and uh said I want to go off into the
[1:28:20] field and there was came a situation he
[1:28:23] they wanted him to pray for somebody
[1:28:24] says I can't pray for the people because
[1:28:28] I don't have the
[1:28:30] love for the people he say and I'll be a
[1:28:35] hypocrite see he needed love
[1:28:38] restored the prophet yes sir because see
[1:28:42] love is what do it yes it does
[1:28:44] Amen that transformative Power of
[1:28:52] Love so he said I I
[1:28:55] can't and in this message here it goes
[1:28:58] on to talk about different ones uh uh
[1:29:02] Jonah Jonah was a prophet sent to
[1:29:08] Nineveh but Jonah didn't want to go to
[1:29:11] Nineveh he didn't like them
[1:29:13] people he didn't he didn't like them
[1:29:16] people he afraid of
[1:29:20] them but as he was running down to Tar
[1:29:25] he own the
[1:29:27] ship and the ship because he disobeyed
[1:29:31] God everybody on the ship was going to
[1:29:35] die
[1:29:39] Jonah love for the people on the
[1:29:43] ship see he had a change of
[1:29:48] heart see he went through all of
[1:29:51] that going the opposite direction ction
[1:29:54] going to tares and on the ship and in
[1:29:57] the midst of that God gave him a heart
[1:30:01] transplant he said these people
[1:30:03] shouldn't die because of some I did bind
[1:30:06] my hands and feet and throw me
[1:30:10] overboard see he stood in the
[1:30:13] gap for those men on the
[1:30:17] ship that were
[1:30:21] strangers but he said Lord take I I was
[1:30:27] wrong throw me
[1:30:29] overboard and and and and that was that
[1:30:32] was
[1:30:39] death and the people were
[1:30:41] saved we know the story went on to
