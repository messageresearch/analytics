amen is nothing like the presence of the Lord [Music] I have a special prayer request here I want to make mention of our brother Nester and man we we thank the Lord for him he actually has to travel on tomorrow to England and uh you know his desire is to kind of stick around but um you know sometimes coming in from other countries you get only so much time that you can stay until they get things worked out for you and uh you know so he he I appreciate him he wants to honor uh you know the government and they told him that they only had so much time but he you know he wants to do what they say do and then try to come back in so we want to we want to pray for him that God would make a way we know that God it was only God that put him only so many miles from uh from this this this place of Fellowship but he says I thank God for my family here it's a wonderful group of saints that I've met here in Florida it's blessings to you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I pray that we will see each other soon says it's not here and there man and uh we we believe the same but we want to pray for our brother he has to travel to England on tomorrow but we also want to pray that God will just move mountains amen and cause walls to fall amen and we want to see a miracle for our brother that God will make a way for him amen so let's bow our heads in a word of prayer father we come in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus precious brother Lord we saw you open up doors for him to get a fellowship healed while he was in Florida and how Supernatural you did things that he was just only a few minutes from the church and uh God he has come to this point this disjunction where he has to go out of the country then try to work on paperwork to get back in we pray that you would be with him throughout this entire process and I heard a testimony last night how you sped some things up where they were telling a sister would take weeks for her to get things accomplished it took days so father we we believe that you are the same yesterday today and forever and you told us Lord that you would give us the desires of our heart if we Delight ourselves in you so we realize there's no process of no program that Satan can put in place that would try to hinder our brother from being in Fellowship so Lord we're committing this into your hands and we pray that you would open up doors that he can't see provide in ways that go beyond his expectations put him at the desk of the right people that would give him favor Hallelujah and Lord may he bypass processes we've seen you do it before we know you're able to do it again there is nothing too hard for our God so Lord we believe for the impossible and we ask that you would move on our brothers uh behalf may you Lord get all the glory and all the honor and all the praise and father for him standing for your word I trust Lord that you would stand for him now God is in Jesus name that we pray amen amen [Applause] they were I just heard that um you know people that are kind of in this this state um they say if you get married you know you can get things done faster and actually there were some people that told our brother Nestor if you would marry a man [Music] it'd be 40 40 faster than marry a woman we are living in hell so I thank God for a brother to say I'll just travel back to England amen amen rather than lower my standards like that I'll travel back to England and brother Ernesto we say God bless you deal Steve indica amen but we thank the Lord and we trust that God will honor his stand amen for the word of God the devil is still alive it's some people on Earth that still believe God's word amen amen so we thank the Lord all right y'all get your Bibles amen bless you all musicians appreciate you all we thank the Lord to have Viva with us on today amen we certainly appreciate that um I bring greetings from Lula Georgia amen and um spoken word uh Church there in Lula brother Dale Samuel Dell is the pastor by the way Dale is is uh just kind of helping the group there and you know it's one of the ministers as well as he just kind of helps run things he's the one that got me there uh to come and Minister and and we went and I'll turn it acts 7 while we're waiting on this uh we went and the Lord blessed the services had a wonderful time with the young people just ministering there about making the right choice and then um when um after I finished preaching brother Dale said you know we we've been going through the uh the the statue of a perfect man and I said oh so if the church has been on a on that journey of statue of a perfect man maybe I can find something in my bag that might fit with their thing that they've been you know ministering on so the Lord just led me to go back and and pick up our thought on war strategies and uh you know we went through war strategies and showed where different strategies in the Bible were one of those virtues was actually uh um uh used Amen in that strategy of war and uh so I picked up war strategies patience with God and um and when I finished brother brother Delsey now I told him that we were you know working through the the uh the uh seven the seven uh Church no no not Church 87 statue of perfect man Seven Virtues he says but I didn't tell him which virtue we just finished with patience and he picked up patience and preached it so uh God knows how to just confirm his ministry amen we just thank the Lord for that we really appreciate to thank the Lord for brother quick who amen standing in on last week uh I was blessed by that sermon uh there were some things that he said in the sermon that was in my heart uh you know when it comes to the way that we you know present ourselves uh you know he he was talking about the little the ring that the young lady had and uh this reading that she was wearing was a signal a sign that she was married to Satan and uh you know so he was just kind of sharing how we got to be so careful about some of the things that we do uh you know I wanted to just mention that even when it come to um uh even Brothers they have to be careful with jewelry you know um in um in the in the Old Testament there was when the when the Hebrew boys and when Daniel were going through their trials in Babylon when they overcame the the uh the the people there was coming and bringing them necklaces that's where it come from from the Babylonians because they weren't wearing them but the Babylonians was given the man necklaces so the men have to be careful in this area right so brother brother Quaker just hit a number of things that was just right there and then we had a questions and answer session my God y'all got some young people in this church that will swallow you I had a I had 44 questions to answer and I couldn't get through but seven because they took over the meeting they was fighting them off I said mine but I thank God for these young people um [Applause] wait a minute something something was missing this morning what happened to that special huh oh I was looking forward to that spirit and Truth 2.0 y'all got to come on amen amen all right all right we'll figure it out amen but they they I thank God for Spirit 2.0 amen and I and I heard all the tambourines going this morning amen welcome to the tambourine Ministry amen glory to God amen now it is a gift to play tambourine I will tell you that now I don't have the gifts so I don't play all right amen if you don't have the gift God got something else for you all right amen amen but I did hear them tambourines going thank God for him all right let's let's look at um uh Acts chapter seven and I want to start reading at verse 35. um and and also I do need to give you all a a update amen uh after service I need to give the church a little update on some things here uh so just bear with me after service we'll just have a quick meeting so I can I can update you on something a couple things there all right here in um acts seven verse 35 it says uh this Moses whom they refuse say who made thee a rule and a judge the same that God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush he brought them out after that he had showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness 40 years this is that Moses which said unto the children of Israel a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me uh him shall ye hear this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in Mount Sinai and with our fathers who receive the Lively oracles to give unto us two of my fathers would not obey but thrust him from them and in their hearts turn back again into Egypt saying unto Aaron make us Gods to go before us for as for this Moses for ask for this Moses which brought us out of the land of Egypt we walk not what has become of him and they made a calf in the day in those days and offered sacrifice unto the idol and rejoiced in the works of their own hands amen oh my um verse 42 then God turned and gave them up to worship the host of Heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets oh ye House of Israel have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of 40 years in the wilderness yay yay you took up the Tabernacle of moloch and the star of your God renfen figures which she made to worship them and I would carry you away Beyond Babylon hey man let's uh have a word of prayer father we are grateful for the reading of scripture we're also grateful for the anointing uh that is in the house we thank you that we can come to church and feel the power in the presence of God we know that when you come anything can happen so Lord we uh commit this portion of the service into your hands we ask that you would get all the glory and all the honor and all the praise from uh the word of God may it bring strength and comfort correction Direction instruction whatever it is that we need here today may you bring it God's in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you you can be seated um I I don't give my title in just a little bit I'm gonna read the title right out of a quote the first quote that I'll uh I'll uh pick up here in a second uh let me also mention um I I did receive a call from brother Mike over at brother West Coast Church and he had told me I forget one day this week that brother masaka was going to be there uh and they they actually have him speaking at brother West Coast Church this morning then he'll be speaking at brother Gene's church tonight they did invite us for the service this morning but I told him we just wouldn't be able to make it uh short notice and we just couldn't kind of try to uh move things that fast uh you know so so if we can make it tonight at brother Gene's it would be really really good I think they would really appreciate the support and the services so just keep that in mind hey man uh so I want to uh just just bear with me I'm gonna give you the title shortly uh but uh brother Branham preached a sermon why cry speak amen he preached the sermon why cry speak and he took his text for this sermon he took it out of Exodus chapter 14. and I'd like to read a man uh a few verses from there he he actually took verse 15 and 16 but I want to start at verse 13 uh and just kind of read where he got his text from says and Moses said unto the people fear ye not [Music] stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show to you today I love this in verse 13 here in Exodus 14 for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever that's a promise amen verse 14 says the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace amen verse 15 says and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore Christ thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward now here's the problem between verse amen 14 and verse 15. amen I want you to look notice verse 14 again the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace now that is Moses speaking glory to God but somewhere in between verse 14 and 15 his human nature got in the way and he began to cry out to God and God had to rebuke him I actually the prophet gives us a man a beautiful description of this he said Moses he had finally called him he got him to a spot where he could carry the people and and the prophet said God was going to sit down Hallelujah and as he was on his way to sit down he heard a voice from the earth amen crying up to heaven Lord what shall I do and God turned around from going to sit-down way who is this calling me it's Moses on the earth Lord what shall I do say wait a wait a minute why are you calling me like that Moses didn't you just say that the Lord is going to fight for you then you just say to hold your peace then you just say fear and stand fear not and stand still amen because God's gonna show you salvation Day then you'll just speak those things out of your mouth why are you crying now Moses so then God speaks to him in verse 15 it says the Lord said unto Moses wherefore Christ thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward that mean don't stand still don't stop but keep moving forward blessed be the name of the Lord he says but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thou hand over the sea and divide it in the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea amen here's the the statement here as brother Branham read this scripture and he and he took the thought on why Christ speak and if you've ever heard the tape I know you've been blessed and I it's one of those that you can just go back and listen to over and over again it is so anointing and so powerful why Christ speak we don't have to cry about anything speak and not just speak not just speak don't just don't don't just speak you got to put some action behind your speakings speak and then move forward some are speaking weights but that ain't what God Said speak move forward oh I don't think y'all get it yet we want to wait to see what this person gonna do we'll want to wait to see what that person gonna do but what did God tell you speak and then move forward put some action behind your speaking hey hallelujah amen we're always waiting on God to do something God is always waiting on us to do something but here you know the prophet takes this amen and he preaches uh why Christ speak but here I want you to just catch a statement at the very beginning of his sermon he says this for our text tonight amen I would like to use the three words why cry speak and for a subject I would like to use the attitude of people towards God's anointed so our title today is the ad the attitude of people towards God's anointed glory to God this was his subject Amen in the message why Christ speaks so we want to just try to dig in there just a little bit today so an attitude what is this what is this attitude uh the dictionary says it's a settled way of thinking or a subtle way of feeling about a man uh I forgot to start my timer so y'all everything I just said was free hey man he says uh the dictionary says a subtle way of thinking or settle away a feeling about someone or something and typically one that is reflected in a person's Behavior so what we if I could just dumb it down or in brother Quaker's words step it down hallelujah amen if I could just stepping down your attitude is reflected in your behavior or your actions amen we watch how you respond and we can tell whether you got a good attitude or whether you got a bad attitude your actions tell you what type of attitude you have sometimes your actions show what your attitude towards God is your attitude towards God's anointed his anointed Pastor his anointed ministers his anointed people your attitude displeased where you at it's a subtle way of thinking it's a set of way of feeling about something or someone if someone if you got a bad attitude with somebody you're gonna avoid shaking their hands you're not gonna greet them after church you're gonna you're gonna Dodge them we're gonna run by your your body language is telling us all about your attitude Y'all Gonna Let Me preach for a little bit but we want to watch our attitude see that the attitude of people towards God's anointed now there's a number of things we can get into here today but I'm I'm gonna just try to Coast just a little bit if I can now look at this in this in the sermon believe it's thou this believe it's now this out of New York amen the prophet says this says watch them on the pla on the platform sometime in a healing service watch the attitude they come in he says here the other night remember the lady coming up there just about enough why didn't have enough Faith Harlow to get to the platform she been in a prayer line after prayer line I I knowed the woman wasn't going to get well he says he knew it and the reason he knew it because of her attitude I know the woman wasn't going to get it well seeing her coming up there I knew it wasn't she didn't have the right attitude when she come up to get well you can't do it I said the Lord Jesus blessed you sister go may he heal you right it's all I can say see but it's just not there why she'd been here and There and Everywhere You see them like that you can't do that you gotta take God at his word it goes on he says here a few weeks ago a man um a a man come up and he said brother random said I went out and tried Freeman he couldn't do me he couldn't do me any good I went to Osborne he couldn't do me any good I went to uh uh ogre Leaf he can he couldn't do me any good I went to Robert's said now I come to you I said you're going you're going away the same way that's right I said you're going You're Going to the wrong person go to God not to some man what can we do nothing it's him that's already done it just believe his word and accept it it'll take place now you don't know when it's gonna take place but it will take place praise God Amen if there's any sick among you let them call for the Elders of the church they will anointed or lay hands on the sick and they shall they shall recover when I don't know but I know God said I shall and all you keep throwing in the devil's face is what God promised you I shall recover everything glory to God hey man look at this it says um uh uh I don't say it says uh you're going away here and disappointed he said but until until then it won't do your bit of good no matter where you go you're going away from here just as disappointed as you went away from the other places because your heart isn't right with God I don't say it was was any immoral acts now but if your heart isn't right with God you can't believe that's true so he went away the same way as all these people come through the line getting healed and pray after they've been prayed for they're getting healed this man leaves without his healing and he gets there into the prophet's presence but the reason that he cannot be healed is because he does not have the right attitude let's look at a few people here that has that have had the right attitude Amen in scripture when it comes to approaching um just approaching God one of these you know that I found amen and brother Brandon makes a statement about her is Rahab the the the the Harlot she had the right attitude and um and brother Brandon makes say he says actually I like her attitude he used that statement I like attitude because when Rahab saw these two spies coming into the land now she knew what the talk in the land was all about hey man she knew that these people uh There Was Fear all over Jericho the people like ain't no way we gonna be able to withstand uh this this group of people coming out of Israel no way we're gonna be able to defeat them I mean this is impossible for us so as they're uh you know she knows what the people Jericho are saying and so when she sees the two spots she recognizes who they are and admit if she goes into action and invites those men to come into her house now you need to understand Rahab was not looking for new customers actually this was a way to get out of the lifestyle that she was in remember brother random said that her parents put her out like that in order to make money oh Hallelujah somebody but even in rahabs amen uh being taken advantage of Rahab without the Holy Ghost still had a love for her daddy and for her mama that when the spots came she began to negotiate even on their behalf say we know y'all gonna take this city but all I want to know is is there any way I can get some safety for myself and what about for my daddy and what about for my mama and what about for this person what what about that they say look rehab if you can get anybody and everybody inside this house they will be protected praise God they can't be outside the house but they got to be inside the house and Rehab did everything she could to get them in the house and she put the Scarlet thread out of her window and when they came to take the city glory to God God gave them that battle strategy amen they're walking around the walls with patience walk around for one time for six days but on the seventh day go seven times they had to use their patience in order to bring the walls down glory to God Amen and why you waiting on God God is bringing walls down you might as well watch them fall praise God cause our God will move a mountain he will cause walls to fall [Applause] rehab waiting in there with our family rehab house was on top of the wall so the only part of the world that did not fall was where her house was [Music] I imagine the way God set up is that rahab's house probably had some scoring up too and one way out God knew how to take care of his people but Rahab had the right attitude with the spies they were God's anointed she had the right attitude she was willing to respect what she heard I like this the prophet says she was um she wasn't waiting to see what Joshua looked like she wasn't waiting to see how he was gonna handle business and how he was going to do that whatever these spies told her she she respected that and because of that attitude God honored it her house remained here the prophet makes a statement about her we'll read it here out of why Christ speaking says I like to make mention of one woman that I think of in the Bible see was bad to begin with rotten to the core a young beautiful woman by the name of Rahab she was a heathen to start with and she was a prostitute on the street but she heard that there was a God not an idol that set them or a declaration of Creeds but a God who lived among his people and anointed them and signs and wonders Glory was following them she heard about it one day two Representatives come to Jericho and quickly her on the street as a prophecy called them took them into a house they're after you and she hid them and I like her attitude she never said I would believe when I see the great anointed Joshua do some signs no she wasn't waiting for somebody else to do something it says if I could have seen Moses do some some of the signs I would have believed but she said I have heard Faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word I have heard that God Of Heaven who is the real God is with you all and he's done great signs and wonders he dried up the Red Sea he brought plagues from Egypt we see how he had turned the enemy over to your hands and and our whole country is trembling because of it I'm she says I'm asking Mercy somebody else should have had the same thought that Rahab had we know what y'all give me to do in here but I'm asking for mercy she didn't say well I I will I would have to see God first let me take my judgment and take what my scripture says about it she never found it but Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God and she believed and when these words was brought back to Joshua the word Joshua means savior Like Jesus Does when it brought back to Joshua God's anointed her house was for a minute to stand and when the People March 13 13 times around the walls of Jericho and sounded a trumpet every place on that wall fell but her house because she believed before she's seen anything she accepted it she said they're Servants of the most high God and I will receive it upon the basis of hearing it amen I believe it Faith cometh by hearing she heard it she believed that she accepted it amen and notice they said Bond the Scarlet string that you let that you led us down with binded in the window that rant amen I spoke of the blood of Jesus the atonement glory and every place in that Warfare hell but rahab's house that sat on top of the wall God honored her and she saw a great A great miracle performed there and there it was drying up the Red Sea for the hand of Jehovah was over that little place to protect protected she had accepted it God's anointed God's servants went over there anointing that she believed it before she seen Miracles she believed it and how and accepted it and we got to be the same way before we see a miracle let's believe it and accept it amen and let's put some action with our speaking amen let's go forward another person that we can see in Scripture that had the right attitude no matter what she was going through but she had the right attitude with God's anointed amen because some people with God's anointed they get the wrong attitude but this lady kept the right attitude and and what had happened in her situation uh her brother had taken sick and when he took sit she uh uh they sent for Jesus her and her sister sent for Jesus this is Martha of the scripture and her and her sister sent for Jesus like you know we you know we we fed him we let him sleep here in the room and we we we we we took care of him when he come by you know maybe he'll come and do something special for us amen and um but Jesus delayed his coming he never showed up there to the house and and finally after four days of of uh Lazarus being in the grave Jesus finally shows up to town and when he gets there the way that we can tell Martha had the right attitude is the way she approached them let's pick it up in John 11 verse 20. amen John 11 verse 20. now she was a little discouraged uh she was going through a period of grief amen she was really she was just really downtrodden in her spirit and she approached the Lord when she heard that Jesus that showed up she left the pity party Hallelujah and man she left the people that were surrounding her and in a comfort she said only one that can really bring me confidence Jesus say I need to just get out there and just talk to him for a little bit so she left her sister in the house and she went running to find Jesus glory to God in verse 20 says then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in the house amen then said my friend to Jesus Lord it thou has been here my brother had not died and she I mean look at the attitude I know if you would have been here if you would have come when we when we asked you to come my brother wouldn't have died but now he's four dead four days gone but but Jesus would be known if you would have been here it would it would have been a whole different story glory to God Amen they were looking for him to do something special but they didn't realize he really was going to do something special amen he said this he says but but look at what she say but I know if you would have been here Jesus my brother wouldn't have died but I know that even now I love that man you got to have the right attitude you gotta have an attitude of gratitude no matter what you're going through get the right attitude in it all right but I know even now that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it to thee man what an attitude when you're approaching God like that he want to do something for you he's looking to get something accomplished on your behalf but you gotta have gotta have said on her thy brother shall rise again Martha said to him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day Jesus said to her I am the resurrection and the life and I like that see he he didn't keep he didn't put the resurrection off to the last day he helped us to realize the resurrection was not an event but the resurrection was a person it's the person of the Lord Jesus amen I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he word dead yet shall he live and whosoever living Believers in me shall never die believeth thou this look at that and she's 7 AM yay Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of God which should come into the world now I won't take time to read the rest of that but uh but I I'll um I'll just go and just say you know just to summarize that story when she got these words from Jesus she began to just kind of slip away she said let me go and get married because some getting ready to happen and Mary I know I know you're a little you you're a little crying and maybe you might even be saying if he would have come if he would have come this wouldn't be like this but Mary something get ready to happen you're gonna have to come on out here where Jesus is you're gonna have to get on out here where Jesus is and as they come out there and amen Jesus says show me where you laid them all right glory to God and uh and when they showed him where he was laid behind that tomb my Jesus looked at him then he told them sisters now they were brothers there but he told them sisters say now you roll away the stone and when and the reason they told the sisters roll away the storm because they had to be involved they had to be involved in the miracle you know what you got some stones in your life you holding some people back some of the words that you don't use against people they are stones that you done rolled over their graves amen and you got to be the one to release them out of that grave you have to roll the stone away and when they rolled and stone away Jesus amen spoke out with a with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and the prophet told us if he had not called Lazarus by name Amy says if he would have just said come forth everything that was in the grave no matter how long it had been in the grave it could have been there for 2 000 years but if Jesus would have said come forth they would have come out of there [Applause] so he had to call Lazarus by me that's how much power is in his voice he had to call him by name and here come this man that's been dead four days in mummy clothes he still can't he's still not useful he might be might be risen from the dead but it's still not useful we got to get him out the mummy clothes now loose him lose him loose him and let him go oh blessed be the name of the Lord and brother random makes a statement as he's talking about this in Believers now this he preaches it in Minneapolis Minnesota and it makes a statement about Jesus being delayed to come amen and pray for Lazarus he says that's the reason friend I'm out of time and now if you sin to your pastor and it didn't come and pray for you when you were sick where you say the old hypocrite I would go over and join Jones church or somebody see that's what happened amen when you have the wrong attitude amen when you have their own attitude you want to get rid of the pastor all right amen he ain't done one thing wrong but just stand on the word of God but we want to get rid of that Pastor right say that old hypocrite I'll go over and join Jones's Church of somebody that's the reason your pastor can't do nothing for you you gotta have faith in him amen and confidence in him as a man of God and know that all things work together for good to them that love God that's right now your pastor didn't tell me to say that either but I know this you've got to have confidence in the man you're dealing with or it won't do you any good to do any dealing he said that's true you got to believe your pastor he's a good he's a god-saved man preaching the gospel stand behind him with everything you got if he isn't go somewhere they do do it now look at what the prophet saying now so if you got to pass it ain't standing on the word go somewhere you can find one that's standing on the word amen hallelujah look at look at what you say that's right now that clears it up for both sides I like what he just said there because you know some pastors will try to keep people in bondage amen they use steer tactics to keep the people close to them some of them use positions yo y'all ain't gonna talk to me they give positions to people in order to keep them in the ministry hallelujah amen but it's the word that you want to be kept by if the man is not preaching the word brother will say if he stopped preaching word you don't have to follow him no more find yourself another Pastor that's preaching the word we got to stay on this word the word is what's going to get us out of here feelings ain't gonna get us out of here emotions ain't gonna get us out of here we need the word if if Eve would have stayed behind the word we would have no trouble on the Earth today but because she got from behind the word and anytime a church comes from behind the word trouble will set in all right stay with me here he says uh uh if uh preaching the gospel stand behind him with it said he's a god-saved man preaching the gospel stand behind him with everything you got if he is him go somewhere where they do do it amen that's right now that clears it up for both sides now remember this if he preaches his gospel stay with him help him because he's a man sent from God ordained of God to feed your soul blessed be the name of the Lord I want to look at another story here of some people that just didn't have amen the right attitude towards God's anointed and you got to keep the right attitude towards God's anointed uh I want to pick this story up in Scripture out of the book of First Kings chapter one these people had a bad attitude when it came to dealing with God's anointed uh I said First Kings one right I might have the wrong scripture hold on one second let me let me look at this I think I might have pulled a wrong scripture hold on one second uh it might be second Kings one so just give me one second I just I just realized I wrote down the wrong thing Second Kings one Second Kings one amen these people had a terrible attitude and your attitude can get you sick your attitude can bring death upon you and and you know I'll I'll share this even brother branham's wife had the wrong attitude with her husband and you know she was looking for him to correct the kids in a certain way and and when he like no I don't want to do it that way you know nah I don't feel that to do it that way Derma just do this and brother Brandon knew that you know she was upset and she's like well you know you need to be here more often with the kids or whatever she went in the room slammed the door my God and you know the Bible actually say it's better for a man to beware on a rooftop then in the house with a a a woman that's acting like that amen and husbands need to know when your wife get into a condition like that just step away don't try to add fuel to the fire fire right but brother brother brother brother brother Brandon felt just said I'm gonna just go outside and wash the car and he said I'm just giving time to cool down you know I know the lady upset she got a right to be upset but her attitude was wrong towards God's anointed and when she uh when she did that uh the brother Brandon said the Holy Spirit came saying I go back in the house and take her to the scripture and read to her this scripture about I think it's in uh and those numbers or something like that but where where Miriam uh had said the wrong thing to Moses amen and she ended up being leprous Hallelujah he said now go back and read that Miriam had the wrong attitude right uh Aaron had the wrong attitude towards God's anointed amen when they got the wrong attitude they said the wrong thing at the wrong time criticizing Moses for the woman that he married amen all right I mean and and Moses Moses was in a mixed marriage but then he had to come back and tell people don't even let tribes cross right don't even let tribes crossing here he is all messed up in his marriage but you got to watch what you say to him sometimes you just need to keep your mouth shut brother brothers dicks told us you need the new ministry shut your mouth Ministry it'll help you it'll take you a long way sometimes just close your mouth you might not under I don't understand how this man gonna teach me and he and just just don't say nothing because God is hearing it amen hallelujah so so here you know Miriam did that and said you know what she uh she gonna she gonna die with this leprosy like Lord please don't kill her you know please don't do this like you're like no no no no I'm sorry she got at least sit out for at least uh seven days and she'll be able to come back into Camp we'll heal her then but she got to pay for this for what she said she got to pay for brother Brandon's wife said the wrong thing at the wrong time the prophet Prophet was told by the Holy Spirit go back and read that scripture to her went back in the house and he read that he says knocking on the door can you imagine him like ah she mad at me but I gotta go tell her what the what the Holy Spirit just told me knocking on the door timing honey I need to talk to you what is it Holy Spirit told me to tell you something seeing a woman with a good attitude will humble herself down or she might if she got a bad understood she'll say I don't care what the Holy Ghost told you your attitude is bad and that type of attitude will bring death to you here you know he's saying look the Holy Ghost just told me something I got a which took out the scripture and read it to her and said now you're gonna have to pay for what you just did you just you know it wasn't me that it was finished it was God that was offended and since God was offended you're gonna have to pay for that she developed a tumor and that to me got so big it was big as a grapefruit I think or something like that a huge tumor and uh and brother Brandon I mean just imagine all this going on brother Bradham has meetings that he's scheduled to go to and his wife is set up for surgery y'all didn't get it yet he has meetings that he's scheduled to go to and while he's in the meetings his wife is set up for surgery now most wives if y'all would be honest with me if you knew your husband was going to a meeting and you had surgery what would be your attitude wow three three and you wonder you want healing with an attitude like that you you wouldn't be able to handle it right but here you know brother if animals away and he's like you know I know you got to go to surgery and I gotta go I got these meetings that I gotta go to a call from God call him out there to do this amen and he goes off on the field and while he's there on the field see it pays to be in the perfect will of God cause while he's doing God the service then he's praying for his wife while he's in in Louisiana he's praying for his wife in Indiana and they say loved before the doctor's hand touched my my wife's body let that tumor beat disappear so while he's in while he's in Louisiana speaking the word it goes all the way to Indiana and the doctor go to bring the wife into for surgery and they said he said she said before you before you take me in before you cut me just check me one more time what we know is that we've seen it there the last time but just check me one more time they went and checked ran the scam no more Tuma but see everybody got to keep the right attitude if you want to see God moved you must have the right attitude look even in your house your husband won't move with a bad attitude husbands your wife won't move she won't be willing to do nothing if you got the wrong attitude how you expect God to move on your behalf if you got the wrong attitude amen man let's look at these people here in Second Kings these people lost their life because of the attitude verse one the more I rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab and ahasia fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria was sick and he sent Messengers and said unto them go inquire bowel's above the god of ekron whether I shall recover this disease but the angel of the Lord said unto Elijah to the test Bank arise go up to meet The Messengers of the king of Samaria and say unto them is it not because there is not a God in Israel that you go to inquire about Beelzebub the god of econ now therefore thus saith the Lord Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which Thou Art going up but shall surely die and Elijah Departed watch this and when the messengers turned back unto him he said unto them why are you now turned back because they shouldn't have been back that fast right he says and they said unto him there came a man up to meet us and said unto us go and go turn again unto the king that sent you and say unto him thus saith the Lord is it not because there's not a God in Israel that thou send us to inquire bials above the god of ekron therefore Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which Thou Art going up but shall surely die and he said unto him what man of man was he which came up to meet you and told you these words and they answered him he was a he was a hairy man and Gert with a girdle of leather about his loins and he said everybody knew who it was it is Elijah the Tish bites then the king sent unto him a captain of 50 with his 50. and he went up to meet him and behold he sat on the top of an heel and he spake unto him thou man of God the king have said come down now I want us to stop there for a second right then the king sent unto him a captain of 50 with his 50. and he went up to him and behold he sat on the top of an heel and he spake unto him now a prophet actually helps us see a little bit more into this because when it says he spake unto him they were actually having dialogue they were actually having a conversation the conversation was not simply amen thy man of God the king of said come down it was more to the conversation than that and a prophet helps us look at that just a little bit so let's just find a just let's take this quote here really quick amen and and I will I will I will uh just help us to see just into this conversation a little bit more here I'm back at Warcraft speak amen and I'm dealing with a quote on Elijah here amen it says this Eli to the prophet of the Lord anointed oh yes God anointed him to be a prophet see it's how people are handling amen God's anointed the attitude of people towards God's Anointed God anointed him to be prophet he was Pastor Elijah I don't imagine Jezebel would have wanted to call him that Jezebel didn't want him to be her pastor but yet he was amen I don't imagine Jezebel would have uh wanted to call him that but he was her pastor just the same God made him her pastor now when we read the scripture understand something uh Ahab had already died but Jezebel was still living my God Amen Jezebel was still living so her influence was still in the land now watch this hey the prophet helps us see these things and man he says this uh uh he was a pastor just the same God made him her pastor so she hated him and God told him said you go up on the mountain and you sit down there I commanded the crows to feature I will water you from the brook Terror and he sat down there and the King said go get that fanatic and bring him down here and the soldiers are armed with the command of the king they started up the hill and uh he says Elisha which means Elijah probably raised up and said something like this gentlemen he raised up he's having a conversation with him gentlemen this is a holy spot now he's talking to these 50 the first 50. gentlemen this is a holy spot I've been called of God to be his prophet he's commissioned me to stand on these grounds and Proclaim his message and the message that I have for you don't you approach this Crown amen stay off of here the uncircumcised have you not read when Moses the servant Lord crossed over the river and the uncircumcised tribe impersonate him they all drowned stay off this ground watch this oh they said that old quack what school is he from we would go anyhow Elijah said if I be a man of God that let fire fall from Heaven and vindicate my Ministry and about that time fire fell and burnt up 50 the king might have said lightning struck them so he sent another 50 and the same thing happened let's look at it let's keep reading in the scripture let's go back to the scripture the prophet helps us see that he's telling him this is Holy Ground don't cross that line don't go across that spot watch your attitude my brother watch your attitude don't don't don't do that now I mean I'm a prophet of God and I know I'm standing here with thus says the Lord so don't cross the line I know you're on King's orders but you better watch your attitude can I put it this way you don't know who you're dealing with Elijah can tell him that you don't know who you're dealing with I don't know what God y'all serve down there but this is the real true and living God don't play with him I know you're trying to do your job but just even in doing your job you got to do it with the right attitude let's go on amen so he says this in verse 9 then the king uh Ascend unto him a captain of 50 with his 50. and it went up to him and behold he sat on the top of a hill and he's speaking to him thou man of God the king upset come down and Elijah answered and said to the captain of 50 if I be a man of God then let Fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy 50 and there came down fire from heaven and consumed him in his 50. that all 50 of them have the wrong attitude now look again also he sent up unto him another captain of 50 because maybe thinking well they died because it just so happened lightning struck that spot that I mean how you know that per chance that happened no it wasn't per chance God was vindicating the prophets Ministry watch this again also it's it's a synonym another captain of 50. with his 50. and the answer to send him old man of God thus half the king said come down quickly tired of waiting on you and Elijah answered and maybe he told him the same thing now this is a holy spot now you saw what just happened to the other 50. now it'll happen to you if you don't approach it the right way and maybe maybe this guy thought he was just no no I I got a job to do the king sent me to get you I'm taking you back down I got these 50 men to carry you back down he says he goes and says it again he lands Elijah answered and said unto them if I be a man of God my God let Fire come down y'all thought it was lightning but it's the prophet calling for it amen if I be a man of God let Fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thou fifty and the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him in his 50. bad attitude verse 13 and he sent again this is the third time a captain of the third 50 with his 50. and the third captain of 50. went up and came and fell on his knees this man has the right attitude and his life is spared not only his life Spirit but the life of the 50 men that follow him are spared because this man demonstrated the right attitude and look at this he says in the third captain of 50 went up and it came and fell on his knees before Elijah and besought him and said to him oh man of God I pray thee let my life and the life of these 50 thy servants oh this man acting like a savior he's standing in the gap for 50 other men look at this man look at look at his attitude let let let let my life and the life of these 50 thy servants be precious in thy sight and look at what he said behold there came fire down from heaven and birthed up the two captains of the former 50s because they never made it back to the camp we noticed that burnt burnt up the the the captain of the former 50s with their 50s therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight an angel lord said in the yard to go down with him be not afraid of him and he arose and went down with him unto the king and he said unto him thus saith the Lord for as much as thou has sent messages to inquire bials about the God of ekron is it not because there is no God in Israel inquire of his word therefore thou shall not come down off that bed on which Thou Art going up but shall surely die actually this man ahazia had the wrong attitude towards God's anointed this is why he was going to a false god can I say this now and let me say this because I feel like the Holy Spirit telling me to say it you don't need to go to a a a crystal ball reader you don't need to be calling no telephone numbers and having somebody trying to read your future amen you come you if you got a problem that bad come see the ministry but don't you be running out after gods of equine amen that'll bring death to you amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen all right let me see here I got another one another one that had a real bad a bad attitude towards God's anointed remember the story is actually his name is shimmy that's actually the name I looked it up in the Hebrew it's shimmy I used to call him chimei but it's shimmy shimmy had a terrible attitude shimmy was related to Saul and when David was being cast off of the throne because of his his son absenton had risen up against him Davis on the Run shimmy met him in the in in on the run and Sherman began to say see you you was no good in the first place we should have never had you as our King and he began to pick up rocks and stones and bottles and sticks and just whatever he could find just throwing them at David throwing throwing dust at David you you son of Belial you this and you that you should have never been the been a leader in the first place shimmy was just going off and finally there was uh one of David's men say should I let that dead dog head stay on his body let me go over there and take it off and David had to tell him to say look stop shedding blood he said maybe God allowed him to say what he's saying because God wants to test me I'ma say something God allows certain tests to come to the church let's see how we're gonna how we're gonna respond how we're gonna react we got to keep the right attitude I want to show you how David had the right attitude let me just let me just catch this oh I just I love the Lord I'm I'ma slip through this pretty quick but David one time desired to build God a house and when he when he when he when he he told his plan and you know he went to the prophet and the prophet actually gave him instruction the prophet Nathan gave him instructors say you know do all that is in thine heart God is with you he wanting to build God a house is it do all that is in thine heart because God is with you but now when you when you look at it in Scripture the prophet leaves David's uh uh uh company and he goes that night and God gives him a dream and in the dream God tells Nathan tell my servant David that he is not to build the house now I know you just told him that it was okay for him to do what was in his heart but he said about not go back and tell him not that I don't want him to build a house because he shed too much blood but I am going to allow his son to build the house now here David amen if his attitude was wrong when Nathan came back and told him this now he could if if he would have the bad attitude he would say now didn't you just tell me yesterday to do all that's in my heart because God is with me now you show him back up today and you're going to tell me not to do it what kind of prophet are you if David would have had a bad attitude he would have questioned the prophet but because he had the right attitude he didn't question the prophet he agreed with the prophet and David knowing that he would not be able to build God a house he still did something that showed he had the right attitude he put his actions behind his attitude you want to know what David did David made preparation for the house to be built he's he gave his money for a future generation I'ma say that again David gave his money for a future generation he store all kind of goodies he wanted them to be ready I don't want y'all to have to spend no money to build a church I might have money already set aside for you to do it that was his attitude he could he could have got really really upset with the with guys anointed but no he made preparation based on the words that he received I just love the word of God let's look at something here oh my god let's go back to the scripture acts 7 35 now as we're picking this up in Acts seven this is what we read earlier as we're picking this up we're we're seeing amen a problem with the attitude of the people towards God's anointed which was Moses you can just just look at how they they talking some of the things they're saying now the person that is giving this recollection of what happened here in scripture is is is Stephen and the reason Stephen is giving this recollection is because the religious leaders have an attitude with Deacon Stephen is God's anointed come on somebody but these people have a problem with the beacon so the Deacon is now just rehearsing some things to them walking them through their history come on somebody amen and I just need to forewarn you don't get an attitude with the deacon when he's doing his job [Music] let me also say it like this so everybody was clear we don't have people positioned to be figureheads they actually do the work so don't get mad at the Deacon when he's doing his job sometimes the Deacon might have to tell you because you sit here because you sit there because you do this could you do it and he's doing that for a reason you might not understand why he do it why every time I come in here he picking on me your attitude [Music] will block you from getting a blessing but if you just come here Lord wherever you want me to sit yeah because maybe in the place that you sit when the atmosphere you create might help that person that day so always be flexible amen man sister know her skirt Too Short don't sit up close like this right if so the pastor can see right between your legs don't do that hello amen don't do that we still trying to live holy here your sister come in with a mini skirt on don't put up in the front no actually back in the old days your sister came in church like that y'all know what they used to do see they had sheets they had white sheets and you knew when you was wearing a white sheet what that meant y'all ain't gonna talk to me today [Music] [Applause] come on somebody but you didn't have to get upset with the church all you had to do was dress right [Applause] you got to make some adjustments with your attitude Stephen was telling them all about you know what had happened in their history and man they got so mad at Stephen they got so upset with Stephen that you know what we ain't gonna We they was sometimes people attitudes get so bad they will they they be they were literally kill you literally man if I could just get rid of their voice I don't want to hear their voice no more these people are stoned Steven to death Paul was right there watching it all happen but they stoned them to death because of the attitude because he rebuked them in the word Sarah if you ever get rebuked in the word is because God loves you he only he only chastises and chases those that and rebukes them that he loves so we need to adjust our attitude Lord I Thank you that you care for me so much that you want me to be right look at this he was telling him here in verse um verse 35. this Moses whom they refused this Moses whom they refuse and see remember this was brother branham's you know inspiration when he was preaching why Christ speak is with the the attitude of P of of of people towards God's anointed look at what they said this Moses whom they refuse he said who made thee a ruler and a judge we'll call you Moses who made you to be over us the same did God send to be ruler they saw all the supernatural signs that would follow Moses right the the the the same that God sent to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the Angel which appeared to him in the bush he brought them out after that he had showed wanders and signs in the land of Egypt and you know Moses standing at the at the at the burning bush and and um and when he stood there he heard divorce tell him to take off your shoes you're on Holy Ground they heard the testimony of the supernatural with Moses why are they coming against that Supernatural did God I mean did Moses send himself or did God send him amen now there was a time in Moses life where he tried to do it on his own he tried to kill Egyptians just one at a time but that wasn't God's plan and that's why he took off running to the Wilderness he was out of the will of God oh hallelujah amen Moses made mistaken had to run to the Wilderness but it did not take away who he was in God Stay With Me it didn't take away who he was in God amen he was still God's delivery he was still God's man look at this verse 36 he brought them out after that he had showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness 40 years this is that Moses which said unto the children of Israel I Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear and that was the Lord Jesus was feeling that right it says this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with that which uh with the angel which spake to him in the Mount Sinai with and with our fathers who receive the living oracles to give it us the Ten Commandments right to whom our fathers who would look at this to my fathers would not obey all this Supernatural but yet the people want to be remember even while it was out there Nathan and core rose up so you got to watch the attitude as Nathan and cork rise up and they say you know what you ain't the only Holy One Among Us God speak to me too yeah you ain't the only one God speak to around here Moses God can speak to me and then they got all these people on their side come on church that's right you can imagine what they were talking about um in the camps going from house to house and having a little fellowship with each other and all the things they talking about my God you think Moses think he's the only one anointed amen you anointed too Nathan you anointed too Cora they just building up their psyche but God had not called taken Accord to that position everybody got to know which role they called to and when you know your old respect the other roles but here they got into a little spirit they come up amongst them like this I'm just preaching the Bible yeah this little Spirit get in on the amongst them and and they just feel like well we can challenge Moses you know what we got 250 renowned men the Bible say I mean they they great men amongst the people they said we're going to go against this most we tired of him trying to leave us like this he ain't the only one Anointed God spoke to me too well motor say uh you know I tell you what y'all say what that that God speak to y'all too not all these things y'all are seeing God vindicating my Ministry and now y'all gonna come up and say something like this say what has God done for you what's your testimony well he did this when it don't even compare well Moses Moses said I'll tell you what I tell you what we're gonna have one final Vindication right here right now if God is with me y'all gonna die death that ain't nobody ever died he say the Earth will open up and swallow you right now so now everybody that is on the Lord's Side not Moses site but if you're on the Lord's Side because you see the Lord vindicating then come over here now in the Bible actually amen it says that uh uh uh Nathan and Cora's Sons but they're a group of Sons of dathan that did not go down of course sons that didn't go down they went to God's side after Moses spoke it out of his mouth the same spoken word creation that was in Egypt was now in the wilderness the Earth opened up swallowed these men up why because they had the wrong attitude and let me tell you something about a bad attitude it can easily be contagious but let me tell you something about a good attitude it can easily be contagious let me just read a little bit from the prophet here actually I just want to read just a two two two quotes here and and I'll I'll close it off but and they're they're they are a little lengthy but I think it's it's beneficial the attitude of people towards God's anointed that was the that was the prophet's inspiration how did he get that but you know he went through so much with people look at what he says here and why Christ speak he says and God it caused such a man and that man was Moses but Moses a great deal like us every time it come a place that something had to be done Moses called out oh Lord what must I do in this place Now isn't that just like we do God had blessed him and anointed him above his Brethren give him a message and a minister that had had not been on the earth since that day until that day and yet every time something taking place Moses went off to God with it Lord what must I do what must I do in this case God got kind of tired of it I really said why are you crying to me speaking speak to the people and go for it my if any time if ever looked like they ought to retreat was then Pharaoh's Army behind them Red Sea in front of them if there was ever time for them to retreat it was then but he says but God has no retreat can we put it God and got that in his vote it's not in his dictionary Retreat Retreat from what no we go forward God has no retreat there's no place to retreat in God go forward the doctor says it's cancer go forward if he says it's TB go for if the devil says you can't give this up go forth if your home says that you're going to be a fanatic go forward the church turns you out go forward there's no retreat in back go forward praise God speak and go forward speak what speak what his word and go forward that's Faith the Lord and move on cry to the people but the people then rebelled and said it would have been better that we died down here down in Egypt it had been better than uh that we had our grades marked then from the hyenas and the vultures that picked our bones in the wilderness why did you bring us out here after they had seen that God had approved Moses to be a servant when God comes into a person or to a person into a congregation into a man or woman he vindicates his presence God proves that he's there for when God comes Supernatural signs begin to appear this person becomes a changed person that's what happened at the Johnson home this week amen it's God that came amen this person becomes a changed person they're not no more like they used to be sin sin has vanished from their life fear and doubt has vanished frustration they're solid stable liver die it's Christ they don't care what comes of what goes nothing shakes them they move forward I like that Moses spread it with the people and the People Credit to Moses now you you know we read during the scripture I didn't finish reading there and and acts but they got to a spot where they said it this Moses this Moses this Moses we don't even know what happened to him get that the language in their mouth this Moses what you mean this you mean the deliverer I mean y'all y'all forgot about the whips that were hitting your back and all the slavery that you was under the bondage and this Moses is the one that delivered you and now all of a sudden you ain't got nothing else better to say we don't even know what what happened to him make us a God so we can go back to Egypt what look what look at the attitude of the people now I want to tell you something because Moses was up in the mountain getting them them um them Ten Commandments and while he was getting the Ten Commandments I mean written by the thing of God Moses got him he's getting ready to carrying back down Joshua hear noise in the camp Joshua get excited he'd say oh Moses man there's some rejoicing going on down there Moses said that don't sound right that don't seem right Moses and no Joshua something ain't right about the sound so it had to be Moses come down and when he saw what was going on the camp he took them stones and threw him down he now he had a bad attitude same thing that was written with the finger I said can I can I'm just I'm gonna drop these things in here so some here your reaction to an action has to be better than the action itself because if your reaction is not right you can lose a lot of people oh man I'm preaching and I know I am I know I'm preaching I know I know I got the devil right where I want him yeah he ain't gonna get no glory here [Applause] and and I tell you right now ain't gonna be no division here We Stand United in Christ not here I need to uh I'm gonna keep reading this quote because there's something I need to get to there but but but when um when Moses is coming down you know and he hears this sounds like no that ain't the right sound Joshua and he and he sees the people dancing around this calf they've how did this happen I've been only been going 40 days how did the people come to this in 40 days it probably upset Moses like I don't know what and this is why he threw the through the storm like no no no Moses don't don't handle it like that because now you're gonna have to go back into the mountain that was the word of God that you threw at them people now you got to go back in the mountain this time God is not going to uh come down with his finger and right on the Rock guess who's gonna have to write on the rock you gonna ride on the Rock carve out every one of them Commandments you know you know it's like it's like that when we were coming up in school if you lost control of your temper you have to sit there and write 100 times I will have self-control I will have self-control and you better not miss one line teacher counting them all you better come back well all of them written you know what you know how you gain self-control by not wanting to write that no more but Moses had to sit there right at each commandment Moses fretted with the people the people Frederick with Frederick the Moses he said what we what must we uh do go forward was the answer now they said we are out in the wilderness and the armies of pharaohs approaching us they're camped just behind us but Moses knew to obey God and if God sends a representative in the anoints is represented and sends it into the world the people must obey that representative it's always been that way all down through the Bible Moses is called for the job God has said in the word he would do it he promised that he would send such a thing in that day amen uh to deliver them and God did his part sent Moses and the children of Israel just because little stumbles in things come along to try them they fail to march with Moses look at it amen they failed to march with Moses Now isn't that just like today we see the message come forth we see the church rise to a place on the wings of the Holy Spirit until the power of God Thrills every person in here the glory of God Falls around and signs and wonders take place less than a week Satan is permitted to come into that congregation why does he do it God permits it and then the church begins to murmur fall back maybe it wasn't so there's where we fail that's the failing of the church look at this regardless of what takes place is God so what's your response move forward why Christ speak move forwards I got another quote to read but I'ma just stop right there I can save the other one for another time let's pray father we thank you for your word we are determined to move forward we realize Satan is he can do you give him permission to do certain things but if we're wise enough to recognize the enemy God then we know that he can't do anything to stop us we are the Invincible Army because that's what you've made us we stand behind the word of God fortified behind the word of God so Lord I pray amen that as as Believers that we can have the right attitude we can have the right attitude towards God's anointed we recognize uh how the devil might try to slip in and do this and do that but Lord help us to keep the right attitude let our reactions be right and father we trust that you would just
