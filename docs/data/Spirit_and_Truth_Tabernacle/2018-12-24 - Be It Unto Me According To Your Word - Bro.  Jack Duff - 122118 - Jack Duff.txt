it to the hospital because she started have chest pain and difficulty breathing and all kind of stuff so they got her to the hospital and they immediately started hooking up to IVs and given IV

week oh the guys they got a lot more to share next weekend I'm just all about this look you know maybe something the Lord just done [Applause] when I worried about anything I went in to talk to one of the ladies at the at the is called covenant Christmas school I believe and I was sitting down with and she was praise Lord yes the insect so I received that now as the brothers were encouraged me in today can you finished with his blessings you don't give you a half blessing so we know all things work out glory to God that that is a real blessing for the whole family be approved like that and God got plans for that a man we believe that we thank God anybody else want to share all right sis a man praise the Lord glory to God to God be the glory I wasn't gonna come up but I thought it would be robbery not to give God praise last week I was putting ear in one of my tires and I stood up to get back in the car and all of a sudden the sharp pain went down the right side and I could hardly move or hardly walk and and I just thought maybe it was just my sciatic but it's normally on the left side and I say oh okay whatever you want to move to the right side and but it was such a severe pain that I went home early from work and I did everything that I know to do to try to help relieve the pain the pain stay with me until yesterday actually but as after Sunday's message it every step that I take just it's a possession so instead on I always take the stairs so instead of taking the stairs I was taking the elevator but after the message I started taking the stairs and every step it was so hard and so difficult but I every step I took I said lord I thank you lord I thank you I made it on three flights of stairs came back down three flights of stairs I was hurting but I made it because I kept saying you know I have the victory and I know I have the victory and even tonight just to come and sit in a church like during the week Wednesdays and Fridays it's such a bad pain a really really bad pain but I still make it like tonight the devil say well you're gonna walk up there they're gonna see your leg kind of dragon what I still have the victory and I give that all the phrase praise God man hallelujah that were always trying to steal some glory hey man but we thank God for touching our precious sister anybody else want to share it come on sis amen Alma's testimony was when brother sister Yolanda was giving her testimony about the house and stuff I was like anyway after church I text the lady that I'm corresponding with about and the house that I really like was a four-bedroom house and two baths then he was foreclosed and it's a really nice house it had a pool and everything that the kids want in there so anyway so I text and she said oh that house is the house is on contract isn't contract so I was like no we need a studio we need and I was like I just got quiet even say anything so anyway so she text me back with another house and it has had five bedrooms in it and I'm like oh that's the studio so tomorrow she's showing us the house we're coming back down here around 2:30 so I'm a man we agree with you all hallelujah my god hey man yes yes yes you gotta learn to praise God befouled man don't wait to after praising before hey man we agree we agree with a three man hallelujah anybody else want to share anybody else all right praise the Lord all right god bless you hey man thank y'all so much musicians I appreciate you all I'm i'ma tell a testimony it wasn't it's not mine either but I think it would be a blessing to us and I don't think they it would bother the person for me sharing this but we had a situation with a brother Simba's passport and somehow they on this job he gave the passport and a package to the like the mailroom and they said they gave it to you PS I believe and when he you know start trying to do some research UPS said they never received the package and say it's never been scammed we don't have it enough so he's like well being that it's a personal item the job doesn't really record what they sent out if it's personal they'd only record their business you know things so the job really couldn't tell them you know what was what and they say we know we gave it to ups but ups never you know actually scanned at him so he was getting pretty desperate because they told him that if he you know he had some things he had to take care of and if he didn't get that passport back he would have to pay a thousand dollars in order to get it and you know so I was like that was just really that's like the devil don't push me too far you know now you talk about money in my pocket you know and you know so we he'd been you know text all the brothers and let us know about it so um on Tuesday night we decided to put it at the top of our prayer list and we we came and we pray tonight I want to thank God for and that prayer meeting we had was it it was 11 people we had two on skype brothers actually three on skype who else I know brother Solomon brother Nehemiah and who else Josiah brother just say was dead a man and and brother Simba on skype and then we we stuffed all these other brothers inside this room bill a law and Hammer is we got to get some old room right but uh but we stuffed and we got in there we prayed and my what an anointing came during the time of prayer you know just just on on Tuesday night and you know we just we just prayed about it release it into the hands of the Lord and whether Simba Texas all the data say brother somehow they UPS are still looking for the package but it's already they already told me that well the people that risk the people that he was sent to already received it processed it received it processed it sending it back to them it's approved and UPS still looking for and so brother Steven and everybody else are bypassing the processes and God just showed us that he's able to bypass processing and and when we say nothing that's what we mean nothing is impossible to God I mean I've just been reminding the devil of that nothing I mean absolutely nothing right it is impossible with God right and you know but but brother brother Simba you know he was just overjoyed you know that he's getting us back in and and and it actually the approval for what he needed the approval came on the day after the prayer went for so the prayer went forth on Tuesday he got an approve on Wednesday and now you've got notified on Friday it's coming back his way so I God is a good god and and and I am I have found of this year that God has really answered a lot of prayers I mean a lot of prayers God has answered prayer and and I'm just I'm just in this state of mind where I just came to town right I don't care what I'm up against I just I'm sorry I can't doubt I've seen God do too much for me to doubt it it'll be a sin for me to doubt all right I'm gonna just believe man I can't do nothing else right but but just believe right so so you know whatever it is that you might be facing Church this you know be encouraged God is um God is mindful of all things he's mindful of all things and he knows where passports are even he knows he knows everything a man read this we just become team to walk by faith and not by saying I'm gonna read a scripture I try not to take too much of your time tonight but I wanted to just a quick scripture we're still in Luke 1 and I feel in my spirit that I'll kind of come with a part 2 for with God nothing shall be impossible but I wanted to kind of go into another little direction here tonight I mentioned a little bit about it on on Sunday morning and I want to kind of hit it a little bit tonight but Luke 1 let's read verse 37 and 38 let stand and read that real quick and we'll pray over this and I'll let you be seated amen it says this well with God nothing shall be impossible and Mayor said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her Amen let's pray over that father we thank you for your word here tonight as we just heard some of the testimonies and things that you've done father we're we're just under expectation for so much more I'm reminded of the testimony that the prophets shared about the man that ate a piece of watermelon and they asked him the question after he eaten a watermelon say did you like it he said it was got to be more where that came from and father we've heard these testimony tonight and we've we've seen of some of the things that you've done but we say to ourselves there's got to be more where that came from so we're under expectation God for even even greater things that as we want to just even put some prayer around this home that the Johnson family is looking for God as they would come on tomorrow father there's nothing nothing absolutely nothing that's impossible so God as they press into that you know of their desires you told us that if we delight ourselves in you that you would give us the desires of our heart so Lord as they would just press their way back here on tomorrow Lord just go before and work everything out somehow move Lord on their behalf do do the do the miracles that only you can do god we just come to expect that of you and my father we just acts that you've moved by your spirit and Lord just continued a man to look up underneath of the other Saints here you know what people stand in need of God we pray that you would help us all to keep pressing by faith and not by saying oh god we thank you for the new church we thank you for the new school we thank you for providing God and ways that go beyond our expectations lord thank you for Lord the the the way that the giving has happened this year thank you Lord for what this church has been able to accomplish Lord how you just bless the people from throughout the year and Lord we know there's more going into the next year that'll be waiting on us o God we just prepare ourselves for that blessed us now as we enter into this little thought tonight use it for your glorious in Jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated just a quick thought on being unto me according to thy word and man be it unto me according to that word let me just start off by reading a couple of things here from the Prophet and I'm reading from the message spoken word was originally part one amen and there's a couple statements that he makes here and paragraph 142 says man wasn't made to die a man I love that I just absolutely love that man wasn't made to die a man he was made to live glory to God and if you ever see a person that's even approaching death they would struggle to continue to live because man wasn't made to die right and and and we know that death only came in after Adam did what he did in the Garden of II a garden of eatin it wasn't until after the fact right but before that he was an eternal being just like God right so man wasn't went so being made in the image of God man was not made to die man was made to live a man but high breathing brought death rather she hybrid it now you deny the serpent seed then I ask you why what's these funeral services about she was hot burying everyone of us our hybrid from the original that's the reason you're constantly dying right he says but all God there's a German life come from the real seat but God proved it was his seed he rose them up again see that through the life that's going over the original seat like was given Eve over his real Church is bringing forth life again oh my god a man that life that was over the real seat is bringing forth life again a man through the birth through the womb of his bride Oh hallelujah so life is coming through the womb of his bride see oh it's rich and glorious I give it a little time to study so it'll sink in he is that seed he is that seed that was produced by the Word of God be it unto me according to thy word there's a seed see you taking the word see so now now I'll get a little deeper into this in a second but you know as we see here for the Branham say life is coming through the womb of the bride life is coming a man through the womb of the bride and as we were saying on Sunday a man an order for Mary to produce Christ hallelujah amen Mary herself had to surrender a man through the womb of her spirit which is her mind that was the first thing God is actually every promise that he has made to you what he's trying to do is get through the womb of your spirit first before that thing can be manifested in your life you have to overcome every mind that you have to cast down what you feel Amen you're gonna cast out what you think anything that goes against the Word of God you gotta cast it down hallelujah and what God is trying to do is work through the womb of your I mean trying to get this word first into the womb of your spirit and once it rest there then everything else gonna work out Oh hallelujah let me go on a little further here this isn't a paragraph 176th of the saint no I'm sorry this is actually paragraph 176 of spoken word is original seat part to a man part 2 this is paragraph 176 a man let me see if there's actually okay I think what what brother Branham did he preached two sermons for about three hours each and and I think it's just a continuation so look at paragraph 176 in and I think that should be fine since now we're gonna hit something real rich full of vitamist from Genesis to Revelation oh my god it says notice and she and her daughter she and her daughters has a horse war now I I want you to try to try to catch this with the probably use some very plain language oh my it may use some very plain language and you know I mean and we had a prophet yo God sent us a prophet and you know there's some things that I want to just kind of say here because you know he's typing this because you know Christ is going to come through the womb of the church right the spiritual in the church that's how Christ will be reproduced again now now when we talk about that we're talking about the bright because when he started using terms like you know he said God would never bring Amen Christ through the womb of a and he's using that as a tight because Christ cannot come through denominational systems Oh hallelujah anybody expecting to find Christ in a denomination in the wrong place looking for hallelujah is the truth anyhow right I mean you can't compromise with denomination it meant the angel actually saying come out not go in right so if you go is something went wrong somewhere you have to hear the voice of the Lord calling you to come out hallelujah right because Christ cannot be produced in the womb of a hallelujah and we that's uh that's uh if you you know you won't script on that go to revelation 17 a man it talks about other the Catholic Church being the great a man that's what the Bible calls her but she had children a man and out of out of those children they're called harlots but like mama a man like daughter glory to God that's why we got to be so careful a man can I tell you something Mama's if y'all don't hold us stand it up can I tell you how it is if the mama's dumb ahold standing up the daughters gonna get worse and worse and worse amen if mama wear her skirt to her knees the daughter gonna wear it to her thighs praise the Lord anyhow right that's my mama gonna have to put it but make it longer if my aware ain't man 3-inch heels daughter gonna go to five inches praise the Lord somebody a man so like mama like daughter that I read the quotes you know what brother man see your grandma me was a flapper right your mama wasn't this and he just yeah chorus girl in a flapper we don't want that spirit do you realize that amen I was just listening to take the day and I'm gonna take if y'all listen to the Prophet when he get to like 63 64 65 he makes some things pretty plain hallelujah imma let me put a couple things out here to you even if you listening to the Prophet you really not getting it unless you get on the ministry you're not catching it amen you can be listening not really hearing what he's saying you know we want to know how many people listen to the Prophet in the house daily but still go to denominational Church evidently you did not here what the prophets tail that's why he has ministry amen to catch what he's saying and speak it back to the people it's important though I got order I got guy got away he do things and he I mean my god you remember when the King Hezekiah he was told that uh he was going to die Hezekiah prayed and when he turned his face of all afraid God heard the prayer but the way God brought the answer was not to give it to Hezekiah directly God had to bring it back through a prophet God has an all in the way - he does things so he says the Prophet then he raises up pastors and evangelists and teachers and they go back to what the Prophet said and they bring that to the people and it helps keep the church in line helps keep the church clean hallelujah somebody you know the Prophet made it coming to say he say now he say sister you say where God anoint you a man to wear something so sexy that it would cause his own son to lust after you you say what God do that you say no it's not God it is to devil so see if mama we're just a little too tight watch whether we're going back to you know you remember we I thought we had overcome the skin-tight weenie stuff you remember other brother making them comments you know who like a skin-tight weenie right I mean so so we we should be well past that now but if mama let down the standards hallelujah mama let down understand us watch what happened with the daughters Oh glory to God a man so so here you know we're just kind of picking up on these things here if she and her daughter's has a horse boom right this is what the prophecy she and her daughters has a horse boom I'm in paragraph 176 of spoken word is their original seat it says only death can come from them he says if you want to join this is this is rich if you want to join the organization and think you're all right you see where you land it right if you want to join the organization a man and think you are all right you see where you land it is that not 62 - 0 3 1 8 176 okay all right they said so so now this is this is why I say you know i I've been feeding on this I've been going back listening to this book where's original seed you know what's the sermon I was listening to today God is evil age right and I'm gonna tell you brother branham say some things that that's tight and as I listen to him I say lord have mercy God you said a prophet right I mean that prophet is is his whole thing was try to keep us out of this stuff a man so anybody think they can go back in and and make a rap to you you've got the wrong fault that that's the devil anointing that man you know and anytime you know I say things like this it's it people get offended and I want to taste something I'm not here to offend folk it's a I got a degree in our team right I can go work eyeteeth and not offend nobody I mean I can me and my family beef you know man we huh boy we got this right but but no God God put a colon in my life and God help me if I don't do what God called me to do right if I play games with Pope folk soul I can't do that I'm gonna tell you something my Mostyn my most the goal the probably the greatest goal I have in passing this church is to make sure people make it to heaven that's the greatest goal and I can tell you right now you're gonna get there you know just doing it any kind of way you want to do it brother branham Toula told her sister one time she had that my high heels own he told say sister you ain't gonna make it like that she walk in and say sister you ain't gonna make like that she start climbing the steps and say you know yes I am dummy he say sister you not gonna make it like that and she come on I'm gonna show you I'm gonna make it when she got to the the top step and fell off brother brems say I try to tell you one don't make it like that hallelujah so church is my responsibility make sure the church is reading it for a rapture hey man let me go on a little further amen say and she and her daughter's as a womb a man only death can come from them if you want to join the organ join the organization think you're alright cuz that's what happened come on y'all be serious be let's be real you know you're not gonna hear this kind of preaching an organ organization all right ain't nobody gonna come against your flesh nope no preacher gonna say nothing if you want to come in there whatever you want to wear they fine with that Amen but you can't come here like that I mean you came you came doing and expect night ain't nobody gonna sit somebody gonna say something if you ain't got one these older sisters pull you to the side saying something or Amen the pastor singer or even a deacon can see something hallelujah sermon at a young young man this young man he's not a pasty now daddy cannot nothing he was just in the church and he told some folk he said if he saw sisters coming into his church but how he has he not even the pastor he say coming there for these heels on you say night y'all done heard the word and y'all not heard it but y'all refuse to do what what's been put out here before you you just repeat he say what he asked them to just you know you can't go into Church of my high heels just leave methadone going inside a church leave matter don't say but when you come back to pick up your shoes the heel would be broken he's not even a deacon or preacher but feeling that way I say my god bless you young man for the way you feel about that hallelujah you know y'all get back in the old day the the mothers of the church would talk to you about stuff hallelujah I've talked and if you want dress right they have a sheet y'all any I'll remember that type of stuff they have a sheet to cover you up they meant not now you know what the prior and back then it was acceptable everybody knew that okay don't don't you know mama go mama go mama go say something hallelujah I'm talked about in my day we I remember going to church amen and we did we just back there talking and we had had a mother in the church of mother Lucille still remember her name mother Lucille and mother Lucille a man she uh she saw us talking and she gave it to us she beat us right there in the church one night mama but because she's a mother to church CCC old god help me I'm not on I'm not but because she's a mother's Church that title carries a level of respect right amen carries a level respect so so so as a mother she earned that title say so when she was coming and approached you say now this what Jack did you know and and I got him so she took me to my mom and and told my mama what happened now I got two beatings I got one from Miss Lucille and then one from mama hallelujah see back then Mama's de Mama's well like not my child mamma's knew that a child could do something that was against the Word of God and if somebody corrected a child what mama she says thank you Jesus hallelujah what is it an African proverb a man it takes a village it takes a whole village to raise a child why because when they get out of Mama's presence a man you got somebody else that got their own why would this person lie on you well why would this adult just be lying on you what do they have to gain by lying on you if you want to join that organization if you want to join it is that you know that's the first thing folk do where they get upset and interdenominational Church they go I mean straight to the denominational Church they go now I can i'ma just I have to say these things Lord and Lord about if I'm wrong God please forgive me you know my heart God but at some time I just gotta tell the truth God you're not hurting me when you run to a denominational Church you hurtin yourself if you want to join the organization and think you're all right you see where you landed your landed right in the midst of death just exactly if you can't see that now if you can't see that now you're spiritually the line now you know i'ma just you know we've been we've been working through the church ages even in Sunday school and there was a quote that we just ran into last week and I can't even get to my subject here I'm trying I really am trying but but we ran into this boat on last weekend and it talked about Polycarp and how a Polycarp you know when he heard that the first church had went into pagan worship right that the church was was set up by you know some Jews the drew Lucas anjuna cos something like that a dronicus anjuna cos they were they left Israel they went to set up the church in Rome and man they had a flourishing Church but because the the Jews start arguing amongst themselves the people in Rome say y'all got to get out of here y'all calls him too much trouble right the Jews argot amongst themselves so so a dronicus in and junik estate they had to leave and they had to leave the church and the status that it was in for you know a number of years and but but by the time that came back the church they started had three you reunite it was some of the pagan traditions and that it was mixing Christianity and paganism together and and here they are trying to have church like that and when when when Elena's came back and they saw the pagan worship in the Christian and all mixed together they say oh my goodness this is you know that's not what we left so they couldn't get the people straighten out so they had to start another Church he said now Polycarp when he heard certain things was going on he well he went on a 1500 mile journey to try to turn the people back to God hallelujah but when he got there and saw the way the people's worshipping and doing things he was doing his best to try to get them to turn back to God but but what here's the thing he realized that he could not do it he tried but he realized he could not do it and a scripture came to his came to spirit he says Ephraim is married to her idols let him alone that's serious that's what God did in the Bible right eat from Mary to idols leave them alone that don't you ever cross the line where God has to leave you alone and you'll never know when you've reached it so I'm gonna tell you something you ought to be grateful that God would speak to you and try to get you come on come on come on come on you know cuz see there's there's different seeds being sown God trying to sow his seed the devil always trying to sow his seed so what you're gonna open up to the womb of your spirit what you're gonna open it up to amen praise the Lord hallelujah I know it's winter but some of us need to do some spring cleaning in our closets in our clothes we need to go through and get rid of some stuff amen all right okay let me go on a little further all right now let's go back now and pick up again and come down for something do you remember what last Sunday service was the gate to the soul you remember now there is a womb of the physical there's a womb for the spirit do you believe that there is a spiritual womb and a physical womb and the mind is the womb to spirit why I remember I told you last something drawed it out here for you these five senses that enters this seat from the outside see taste feel smell hear five on the inside conscience and so forth from the inside five now on a life site there's only one that's your your on the basis of free moral agency to accept take it in or let it out see now as I just kind of think about that that wound because there's multiple definitions we know we noticed it the uterus of the human female and certain higher mammals but there's also another definition says the place of which anything is formed uh produced a man the womb is where things it's the place where things are formed and produce in the womb of the Spirit you know before Eve a man failed to the serpent she accepted something in her in the spirit oh my god before our lady falls into adultery before a man falls into adultery they have to actually battle something in the spirit realm oh my god and what's going on is that these thoughts start coming to you a man I can go out of a marriage bound I can do this and I can get by with it and you are you have to plan that thing in your mind how you gonna work this thing glory to God and not get caught and what it what you what that happens that you're not allowed ain't man this thing to come down into the womb of your spirit and it does took root and before the manifestation takes place you had to go through something in your mind if that happens on the negative side it's the same thing spiritually you have to receive this word into your spirit a man before it actually manifests on the outside hallelujah glory to God you can overcome Devils it meant by taking this word and applied it I mean every mind added it come bring that thing back in in line with the word of God and watch you to have a victorious life that way no glory alright look at it i'ma read this because the prop says he goes only says that's how adultery just a minute that's how adultery is committed spiritually when you knowing better by the Word of God look at this look at this look at these words when you know I'm bad about a word of God by the intercourse of the mind and that's a hard by the intercourse of the mind take in a lie of the devil the act takes place in your mind you think that'll look good on me that'll look oh yeah oh yeah I can oh and you just still use in the mirror just spinning and take it say that uh in your mind in your mind you think that'll look good so then you go from your mind to the manifestation on the outside Oh hallelujah and you and I told you got you got you got a full that a word that end with a wide you can either be holy or you can be sexy you have to choose but it starts in the mind all right now somebody alright Amen sisters I'm gonna tell you something that ain't none of y'all have to do nothing nothing extra they get no young man's attention if you got to do that to give them imagine what you gonna have to do to keep and let me tell you something making me talk playing here tonight see you you know when you went went you went glory the Lord blessed and you have children your dynamics change it changes praise the Lord I'm just be honest with you thanks changed things that you used to be able to get rid of you can't get rid get rid of them all and every tape that man didn't love you before you had that child and he was only only with you because of your figure he'll be gone after the child is born you better make sure he love more than your body all right praise the Lord a man is to enter course of the mind no I'm bad about a word of God by the end of course of mine taking a lot of devil against the Word of God that's exactly what he done with a spiritual intercourse first that come you know and what brother branham preach the sermon if y'all go back and listen to the tape he said something like this he say he said I was I was alone I didn't know how to really write these things out I don't have an education so I don't know how to really present this he said but I had certain things written down the Holy Ghost had to tell me don't say that that's too much the Holy Ghost had to tell him don't say that that's too much so so when I'm reading the Holy Ghost actually approved exactly what you've done with the spiritual of course first that come by believing Satan's lying to the woman for mine that polluted us soul set death in the soul then the GNAT track takes place and that's the only way that a woman can a woman ever can't commit adultery against her husband is to first let some man talk her into it and then receive another man's that's not her husband then she's committed adultery now that's the same thing it happens with spiritual don't you right so you you you know you just don't count it up and just you know be going are you talking to somebody Oh y'all and y'all they gonna talk to me you've been talking to somebody your actions show it you know what when I win it when a husband and wife together they can kind of pick up when it's something wrong in this relationship so the story is a lining up and I thought you see who's gonna do it in soon you wait hold on and then you you gotta tell a lie and do you got to tell love a lot of cover that lie a man right and so you you know here here all this stuff you you're going through and the same thing happen spiritually you know the folk before a person just kind of come to the point but I'm going back to the nomination then entertain some stuff it's the same thing that Eve did right and and see when we talk about these two wounds the reason I've titled it be it be done to me according to that work because Mary did the opposite of what Eve Dean Eve actually thought that she could help the process out right II thought she was doing something to help God out now brother branham said a couple things you know being that the body was already full with with with with the organs to reproduce a man a reproductive system was there had they come to it on their own God would have blessed it that is one way it could have happened how Adam and Eve come to that on the oh god of less that's why the Bible say marriage is honorable right you say had they come to it on the own God with a blessing but another way that children could have been produced is the same way Jesus was produced through the spoken word hallelujah and the way did that happen oh my I'm taller impossible if there was anything that should have been impossible it's impossible for a virgin to have a baby ain't no way a virgin conceived and bare child ain't no way we know how children are born right but here you know their mayor rather than a man sit there being the reason now with the ain't she exquisite how can things be said he'd say the Holy Spirit got overshadowed II you know and and that's what's gonna call the child to come forth and they're not even I mean the Holy Spirit has not even come yet that was new language to her oh my god it was brand-new link what you talked about but she had never heard the preacher say anything like that but he said the Holy Spirit got overshadow you that's how you can have a child and what mary did it's the same thing God wants all of us to do is just settle that thing was gotta smoke it be it unto me Alleluia not according to my thoughts because my thoughts are gets what you just said and then being up to me not according to my feelings not according to my emotions but being unto me according to the word that you just spoke over me angel departed no wrestling with Mary no no fighting with Mary but the angel knew that she had received her womb was open to the world and all and she couldn't explain it and like I said you know as soon as she got it let's let's let's just go in and then maybe uh you know I've saved that I'll see that but soon she got it she went to tell Elizabeth she went to tell Elizabeth and and and i'ma tell you when you get it you'll testify about it - Oh glory to God can I just uh I have some other things lined up here but I'm not going to keep y'all here all night I won't do that I might have to come back Abe man and hit it again from at a different time but God knows what he won't see it God know what he won't see it alright let me uh let me paragraph paragraph 139 in that same same message paragraph 130 where they fail where Adam and Eve fell was where doc told him to multiply replenish the earth it fell and the way that they made that happen Eve when she fell to what Satan that represent a tour took it to Adam and that's where they both just state they failed there and day the replenishing could have happened multiple ways like I said it could have happened through those you know through the organs that they already have or it could have happened through the spoken word either way God would have blessed it right and but here you know it would pick up this in paragraph 139 says the true Bharath like Mary will have a virgin moon for the bride of the word which is Christ when Christ the word comes to the bride should be the same as he is a virgin by the word amen Oh God he says I hope I hope this I hope it's going over brother Neville see I hope you understand what was he were the Word of God upon his vesture he had a name written the Word of God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God in the Word was God the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us He is God God is the word paragraph 141 says and when his bride comes she'll be the same product that he is a virgin did Christ belong to the denomination Hey look at that he'd say so that he talked about the bride all right cuz the bride has to have a virgin womb just like Mary had a virgin boom okay and when his bride comes she'll be the same product that he is virgin did Christ come to the denomination then Jehovah neither does his bride she is a part of him she needs no dogma she won't have any she'll be absolutely virgin how Bob a word a man she'll punctuate every word God says with an amen amen Oh be it unto me according to thy word Eman oh my there you are punctuate God's Word have a virgin womb what will she come out of a virgin womb the word what did Jesus come out of a virgin moon see now you know and so I'm gonna leave that there cuz he goes on to talk about how Adam came his wife amen before he got to know her she was already pregnant and saying she was pregnant with death but when Joseph came to his wife she was already pregnant with life hey man thank God for that all right let me uh let me just kind of wind up here tonight Oh glory I'll bring it home with this quote out of pergamene church age Laura to God hallelujah glory glory glory glory pergamene church age this is the angel the Lord speaking to the Prophet taught him to pick up his pen and write and this is something that he said here he says notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was showed him by the father John 5:19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death but if the seat be planted this is what I love if the seat be planted the water will raise it up again a man and we're expecting rain a man because this is the season for both the former and the latter rain and if the seat be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ but she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord I like this I'm coming back to that one on Sunday morning I'm just I'm coming back she has the staff the Lord then the word is quickened by the Spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and water it comes to full harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they had thus saith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all this work while in this earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride the work which he left for this specific time and the only way he's got to be able to do that through the Pradas that she has to maintain a virgin womb a virgin womb and I would just have to be plain not a woman but it must be a virgin woman house how's it gonna be virgin its virgin to the words it's virgin to the words amen hey where God speak we say Amen and I'm gonna tell you something you Kate yeah it'll be hard to keep a virgin womb when you compromise when you compromise you compensate the devil can I tell you just don't compromise Church don't do that we got to have a standard for you don't measure up to this this bride is different we're not like denominations we're not trying to be like denominations and and and one of the biggest things for me is just to get people to see that you know that you're that that's that's you Christ not coming out of denomination he's not a man you're not gonna find him there so anybody trying to tell me that I'm sorry amen this our conversation will be short glory to God our conversation gonna be very short because I know what I had a denomination did not produce this they couldn't even talk things like this they couldn't talk about they couldn't even say anything like this I mean they like like brother Ram said you know and your denomination did you ever hear the seven seals seven thunders you ever heard that go ax just find you the best church you can ask the pastor to preach it could you open up talk about these seals and these thunders for me excellent and you might say what I don't mean uh I think everything in the buckle meant something everything and they and even touch it can't even touch it at all right so we got to thank God that he's giving us an open book that we can you know we can live but but keep the womb virgin hallelujah don't entertain this demo Amen church don't entertain this devil in no way hallelujah cause he's trying to defile what God has you know please before us amen let's pray father we are just grateful for just this little thought that you've given us here tonight and Lord as well I know it's important that we maintain this virgin womb Eve failed to do it Eve at it a little bit of this and a little bit of that and it brought death to the human race but but Mary when she had nothing to look at nobody as an example all she had was a promise from your word and she took that promise and she said be it unto me according to thy word wasn't fully understood couldn't really be explained this was all new to her new language everything was so new oh god she was ready to receive it and in doing so she brought forth the King of Kings the Lord of lords just as death came to the human race through life also came through a woman so father were grateful for that and as we just take time to even reflect on that throughout this Christmas season lord help us to remain pure don't let us compromise with the enemy in this our Lord he has so much that he's trying to do so many tricks he tricked Eve God we don't want to be tricked in this hour with pray that you'd open up by our eyes our spiritual eyes that we might see let the word settle in the womb of our spirit that it might produce Christ again some Jesus name that we pray amen amen praise the Lord glory to God she's singing a song of worship a man as we just prepare to this dismiss for tonight a man church I'll tell you what we are in a very serious time we're closer to the coming of the Lord closer today than we we've ever been and we must realize that we're living in the day where we can
