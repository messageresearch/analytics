and uh we had a chance to talk and i called his father his pastor amen and had a chat with him and just told him that we were so happy to have two of his kids uh with us amen we thank the lord so welcome brother tinashe and sister brenda welcome to spirit and truth tabernacle amen the lord bless you amen let's uh let's look at a scripture very familiar passage on today uh luke chapter four and uh i already know that i won't finish this sermon today and uh so y'all just bear with me i'm just trying to uh find my way amen uh in in the midst it's just something the lord kind of put in my spirit i got the date on here august 12 2019 is when it was birthed but i wasn't released to preach it until now so god does things like that and um and i just pray that he would just help us as we navigate through uh our subject on today here in luke 4 verse 16 um it says and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book now you know there's so much happening here uh in the scripture first of all in verse 16 we see it was customary for jesus to go to church i said it was customary for jesus to go to church and if it's customary for jesus to go to church then it should also be customary for his people to go to church i see my cousin god bless you cuz amen uh here it goes on and in the next verse it says there was delivered unto him verse 17 the book of the prophet now didn't it doesn't say that jesus asked for this book it says it was delivered unto him and when it was delivered unto him he found the place where it was written let's keep reading amen uh it was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he have uh sent me to heal the brokenhearted now the only person can do all this is jesus amen to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord now he found where it was written he read it and the bible declares he and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and eyes of all them that were in the synagogue now they weren't looking at the minister think about it now they weren't looking at them and everybody now why would he read something like that read it sat down and said the bible say uh and eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fasting on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears oh my my my my my well let's just stop right there and let's have a word of prayer father we are grateful for the opportunity we have to come into the house of the lord god how we have been blessed by uh everything that has happened us father song service the specials uh we have um we've thoroughly enjoyed just being in your presence but now we come to the word of god and we trust that the holy spirit would take control over the thought that is being presented today use it for your glory and for your honor father i want to ask a special blessing upon my wife lord the enemy attacking her in her body but we rebuke the enemy right now in the name of jesus and we ask that you would touch her and make her completely whole even as she's listening in on the line father may she feel the spirit of god amen just come into the room and touch her right where she is you're the same god that touched peter's mother-in-law and then within an hour things were different we believe that god still lives today so we're trusting god that you have moved by your spirit amen upon her and upon anybody else that has a need here this morning god we give it to you in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated amen um i'm taking a thought from this scripture that we just read out of luke 4 our title today is aired in spirit amen aired in in spirit i want you to just bear with me as we try to uh navigate this thought uh i want you to just catch that word i had uh sister tina just put that up there amen a forest so that you not not errored but aired aired aired in spirit and um aired actually means to be mistaken or to be incorrect or to make a mistake a man to make a mistake and as i was just looking at some of these definitions uh when we use this word there are uh little statements that have been made they say error i mean air air not air but air on the right side air on the right side which means act so that the least harmful of possible mistakes or errors is most likely to occur so when your air on the right side you're acting in a way so that the least harmful of of possible mistakes because it's i can tell you this right now none of us are perfect all of us going to make a mistake somewhere along the line but but air on the right side right because this says act so that the least harmful of possible mistakes or errors is the most likely to occur amen another amen uh a statement that they kind of uses air on the side of caution okay and what this means is display more rather than less of a specified quality in one's action so if you're going to err on the side of caution that just be be a little bit more careful right amen uh just because there could be a mistake made but just be a little bit more care careful so air on the side of caution all right and here's another statement that is used when we're talking about this word air this is to air is human glory to god to forgive is divine amen amen to air is human but to forgive is divine and this means uh uh it is human nature to make mistakes hallelujah amen uh it's human nature to make mistakes oneself while finding it hard to forgive others of theirs so terrorist human but to forgive is divine see we're talking a man that's born on air in spirit and spirit now now you know um my my heart uh uh moves in the direction of many people in this day that i feel have aired in spirit because they have walked away from the word of god and let me put it this way they've walked away from the revealed word of god and oftentimes when people make this mistake you begin to see certain things creeping to their lives it's the truth in it how amen holiness what goes right on out the window amen but but there there that there's a stand that they used to have but because they they aired because they made a mistake amen spiritually right because they made a mistake spiritually and you start seeing certain things creep into their lives now what i want to tell you is that when this happens uh you gotta have you had a certain response that you should have and it should be to pray for a person glory to god hey man look look you can't point your finger at nobody cause when you got one finger pointing out like this you got four more pointing back at you hallelujah so when you see somebody's heired in spirit you got to pray for him so take heed lest you fall i want you to just just just stay with me here today um i want to you know just i'm going to read a little bit uh i want to start in this message shalom is where i want to start just reading from and and just this morning i was teaching and and um actually the two of those songs a man this morning's sister sister birds when she come out talk about the wise men i was teaching this morning talking about the wise men i said man what a confirmation then when sister rachel starts singing um i'm still holding on i say well i thought about this this message because there were many that started out with me but now they've gone astray if i can just put it this way they air air in the spirit it's just a mistake it's just a mistake you can recover from a mistake you you can recover from a mistake you're not defeated because you made a mistake lord i'm gonna get to this quote but i'm reminded of this man that went for a job interview and he walked into the job interview and he and he took a pen i believe it was when it went into the interview and the boss began to say no no he took a pencil but the pencil had no eraser and and then when he went in went in there with the pencil the boss actually said now hey uh i noticed your pistol don't have an eraser he said that's because i don't make no mistakes he said you ain't gonna get this job you're not gonna get this job you can go ahead and leave because we don't need nobody like you around here amen if you make a mistake just use the eraser glory to god that's why the pencil has an eraser all you got to do is erase it and rewrite the answer hallelujah somebody you can make a mistake but you can't recover glory to god you can recover and jesus himself said he brings recovering of sight to the blind this is not a message to uh condemn this is a message just to say look we all do it we all make mistakes but we can recover look at this this sermon shalom the prophet says this now a few about three years ago it will be now that at home at my home church the holy spirit spoke to me and said go to tucson there is something waiting i stood on this platform and told every one of you thus saith the lord something is fixing to happen it says um this there is probably hundreds of people sitting here that know it i just told you what i saw the message is on tape what time is it sir i saw a constellation of angels like a pyramid come down just north of tucson up in this way north of tucson and they spoke to me something and i didn't know what it was amen and and one day there uh there's a man sitting right present now two of them that was with me back over there when that happened and they took the picture of it in the sky it come out in the magazine i thought i had a copy i do that's it you see it you see it here in life magazine this copy just exactly the way the holy spirit said it would be now here you know the prophet had already told the people uh years before it actually happened and then now when it happens uh there are seven angels that uh uh form this cloud and you know and and we we we we hear a lot of people saying that maybe it was a jet that did that and you know if you want to give credit to the jet i don't i mean fine that's more of a miracle than uh then i know right because a jet can't even fly that high but if a jet got up there and created a cloud that big then my god how how much more supernatural that is right you know and then on top of that when when we look at the cloud the way that they took the picture in life magazine they had no idea what this was and the prophet never went to life magazine and told them what to do with it he only told the bride to turn it to turn the picture to the right and when we turned it to the right we didn't see brother branham we saw jesus and when we look at this message we should still be seeing jesus [Applause] hallelujah look at it now he says uh it says and there stood seven ain't those seven angels just as natural as you see me standing here and told me to return to my home that the mysteries that the reformers down through the ages have failed to pick up the mysteries of the bible which the seven seals held would be revealed and that's a statement that i that i want to bring to you i challenge anybody get those seven seals and look them over glory to god and i don't let not not what he's saying is i mean i i should have brought one with me but i ain't got to hear a seven seal book he said get the seventh seal book and look it over and find fault with them oh glory to god right because this not the place that people have gone to find fault they've gone to a bridge they've gone to a bear they've gone to all kind of other places but go to the seven seals pick it up and read it and find fault there now i'm gonna tell you how perfect this word was that we got because when you read revelation 10 i'm i'm just y'all just bear with me because this is my teaching from this morning i'm just giving you a look i'm just giving you synopsis amen but uh but but but when you read revelation 10 amen give me verse one and two real quick just give me a real quick revelation 10 verse one and two and i'm gonna just read something here for you just just kind of show you something just write in the scripture right in the scripture revelation 10 verse one and two glory to god glory to god look at this look at this just want to show you something here the bible says this and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a clout and a rainbow was upon his head and his face amen uh uh and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire now now right here this this particular scripture brother branham tells us this is talking about christ amen this this angel this mighty angel is christ himself all right now notice verse two and he had in his hand a little book open now christ is the one with the book in his hand oh glory to god it is christ the one with the book in his hand but by here we need to understand how did the book get revealed to us christ decided according to his own word that he revealed his secrets to his servants the prophets and the prophets then reveal it to us amen so christ is the one with the book in his hand giving the secrets of the book to his prophet and now we have that in the seven seals that's why he said go to the seals my god look them over and see if you can find fault with them don't come with the bridge don't come with the the bear come with the seven seal book that christ himself gave to his prophet look him over and find fault there let me go on with the rest of this quote all right all right all right all right aaron in spirit all right he says this i challenge anybody get those seven seals and look them over and find fought with them see see because it's given by inspiration of god it says prior to that i preached on this on the seven church ages and then draw them out on the blackboard in my tabernacle now just just bear with me amen i'm i the one thing that i do know is that i know where i'm standing that's one thing i do know and we're going to get to something here in a little bit uh we're going we're going to talk about the anointing in a little bit i want to just talk about the anointing so you know what the anointing is hallelujah do you know right now amen this is probably one of the most anointed messages that you have ever heard what you listening to right now ain't nobody up on their feet ain't nobody jumping and running around the building but one of the most anointed messages you ever heard oh i know what i'm talking about see when i'm talking about somewhere between here and there y'all say that's a no it was but this right here is one of the most anointed messages that you are ever we that you will ever hear right now all right let me just keep reading y'all stay with me amen amen so i wanted to just just share he said prior to that he preached on the seven church ages and draw them out on the blackboard when brother branham preached the seven church ages god supernaturally vindicated what his prophet spoke and what he did after the church ages was over god came into the room and on the board on the wall drew the very same church age picture that brother branham drew on his paper god drew it on the wall now when that happened there were some people that said there was a car that came by and the lights a man uh in the car flashed on the wall and it created this this image now that's that's again more supernatural than than i can even uh imagine you telling me where is that car i want to see that car that can turn on their lights and flash the seven church ages on the wall they said no it's the holy ghost coming to vindicate the word that had been preached now when brother branham preached the seals amen we also had the supernatural on display now i'm saying all these things to get us to a certain point here because you know when we see god vindicating his words amen then then we see people air in their spirits after god has vindicated his word you gotta guard your spirit you gotta guard your spirit you can't let people just put anything inside your spirit you can't read everything you can't be going to every website you can't visit every church you got to guard your spirit because if you don't guard it before you know you don't made a mistake in the spirit you've aired in spirit hallelujah see you you know you you got your your um uh your body your spirit your soul right and see that the spirit amen that's the realm of things that you really you know you can't see it's like affections and emotions and and all this other kind of ccc i mean when you start getting to that realm you know memory affections emotions uh the devils start playing tricks on you there and and you're not if you don't guard that area right before you know your air in your spirit and it'll lead you down a path you never thought you would go but remember if you make a mistake there's a way back what i want to say here is that uh when the seven seals was preached god did supernatural things amen uh seven angels appeared in arizona and told the prophet go back east and preach the seals you know and out this morning as i was reading amen just the story of the wise men i was the if you notice in the scripture that the wise men came from the east when they met when they went to jerusalem they came from the east they went to jerusalem and now now the star led them to the proximity as to where the christ child had been born but is when they got into herod's presence and herod went and got the scripture when he got the scripture began to read where christ was fully born then that brought them into proximity i mean the very presence of sorrow the star brought them in proximity but the revelation of the word brought them into the presence of god they were coming from the east to the west brother branham was coming from the east going out west before the seven angels visited him and then the seven angels out of the west and tucson said go back east and preach the seven seals it was the manifestation of revelation 10 the angel the mighty angel with the book in his hand giving it to his prophet to give it to us all right stay with me glory to god hallelujah now you know there are some churches that as far as they can go is between here and there that's the only sermon you're here when you go to some of those churches and it'll get you excited but when you get this word this revelation word it will anchor you it'll anchor you when you start going through some things glory hallelujah amen because it's very easy to air in your spirit y'all bear with me so uh supernatural things happen when the seven angels a man commissioned the prophet to go back east and priests and seals uh brother branham was concerned about what all these supernatural things was he start praying amen there in tucson i mean in in the mountains of tucson arizona and while he's praying with his hands lifting the air a king sword appears in his hand and that king sword happened to be the word of god not a king but the king's sword it was the word of god it fit his hand perfectly fit his ministry perfectly amen the other thing is that every day before he preached the seals an angel would meet him daily giving him the revelation to seal in the little room glory to god amen and the other thing where the seven angels came down to uh to commission the prophet another thing that happened is that in the rock of the mountain the profile of the prophet was placed inside the rock god did that now i'm saying all these supernatural things that happen to show us that god was behind this message that we're that we're that we're following here but people reject the supernatural and they're airing in their spirit stay with me and y'all y'all gonna find by the time we get to the end of this i'm gonna read it to you right out in the bible where i got my title from so just stay with me don't worry about it don't just i don't give it to you man so i just let you follow me and then i just read it to you right there in the bible glory to god here we go turn on the light give me this this message out of turn on the light stay with me you know i don't even i forgot to put my timer on what time i got here about 11 30 right i'm sorry i try not to preach too long um i give y'all about a little over an hour a little over an hour so since i got 11 30 11. okay i'm gonna give you 45 minutes and i'm gonna shut off is that all right all right take your time thank you brother i appreciate that what nobody else gonna say brother joseph nobody else got they they about shut me down already brother joseph i just got started but thank you brother glory to god amen all right stay with me stay with me here oh glory now uh this message turned on like look at this look at this nothing can live natural or spiritual without his light and his word is light and life right but when he sends his light and makes it known to the people and then it is rejected then what about that right that's what we want to talk about this morning is rejecting this light by them it's sent to reject it just like it was then behold my servant whom i have delighted in he is the light he's the light to the gentiles he's the light to the world he was the light of the world but he was rejected that's the sad part what we got to get here is not just bible history because history has a strange way of repeating itself right amen says and it meets that condition every time that god manifests his life the word itself rejects that light why it's written right in the bible each age god has allotted so much of his word for each age and he always sends somebody to manifest that word let's go on a little further jesus had been prophesied for 4 000 years that he would come messiah and when he come he manifested every promise of messiah but yet the people of the world the churches and so forth know nothing about them so cause they they had then got in some other thing that kept them away from knowing this now he says we'll take the natural part what if a man that is born here to walk in the light of that son amen what god has created for him and the first thing you know he shuts his eyes now this is what the man is doing ain't nobody set his eyes for him he did it to himself glory to god he shuts his eyes not an old man runs into the basement now now the man is doing this something is going wrong with this man that is trying to deny the very existence of the s-u-n and in order to deny he can't come outside you can't come outside and come in contact with the sun and start denying it's too much evidence [Music] it's too much evidence to prove to you that there's an s-u-n all you got to do is watch the way the plants operate you can tell that there's an s you win your skin will start telling you there's an s you win oh hallelujah to the lamb look at this now see what happens now that the man has to shut his eyes look the prophet says this uh uh he shuts his eyes runs into the basement closes the door and ain't enough because the sun even get through all that you're in the basement but there's a window in the basement the sun will find its way in the basement so he got to keep doing all kinds of crazy things to try to tell people it's no s-u-n my god look at him says he uh he uh uh runs into the basement close the door pulls down the shade and even in that you can still feel a different presence when the s-u-n come in the temperature in your basement changes when the s-u-n rises hey i want to tell you the temperature in your life should change when the eson rises and just refuses to recognize the sun is a shining he denies its privileges now there i think there are certain uh uh benefits that you get from sunlight he's denying his privileges glory to god and ain't no light ain't no light i don't care like at night when they start working on the roads and they put the lights up that's not good enough that ain't good enough i mean you need s-u-n light look at this he says um uh uh oh my that he denies his privilege he denies it's warm and raised it's life-giving resource he denies the light that it spread glory spread so he can see where he's going where he come from amen he denies that uh what would you say to a man that pulled down the shades or run into the basement and closed all all the light off everywhere and just simply refused to recognize the sun was shining there is something mentally wrong with that person anyone knows that a natural mind will tell you there is something wrong with that person uh something that's happened to him he has lost his reasons now watch this well so it is in the hours that we live when a man will cover himself up with some kind of excuse to actually recognize the gospel light as is shining forth as it is today when a man deliberately turns away from him goes into something and pulls down the curtain say i don't believe it there's something wrong with that person they're aired in spirit look at this look at this he said there's just no way of getting around it there is something wrong something has happened to him and we find out there is so much of that today now i want to just i want to i'm going to just uh maybe stop right there i won't go any further on that quote i'm trying to get you to see this this natural and spiritual type that brother branham just gave us if the man is trying to deny the su in the existence of the suv there's so many things he has to do in order to deny it so many things he has a he has to isolate himself he has to go into a basement where no pretty much no son can get but if he if there's a window there he's in trouble so he has to pull the shade down in the window and even if you pull the shade down you realize sunlight would kind of go out the corners right i mean there's so much this man got to do in order to deny the sun and all all if he tells about it ain't no sudden they just said would you just come outside would you just come up from the basement you will realize there is a son hallelujah now that's natural the man lost his mind if he's in that condition it's the same thing spiritually when we are denying the vindicated word of god we've erred in spirit jesus spoke these words in luke 4. this is why i read this amen for us on today because jesus knew that people would be in this condition and and and and and i want to tell you something that the only person that can bring you out of a condition like that is jesus amen only jesus can actually bring deliverance to you only jesus can reveal his word to you only jesus can do it amen now now there were some things that jesus said he says he was anointed to preach the gospel to the poor and and i love this because as christians amen not not when i look at that scripture it's not that does not talk about people that don't have money but let's talk about people that get poor in their spirit through conditions and situations that happen in their life one of the people that got poor in spirit was a prophet by the name of john the baptist john the baptist when he when he started going through his trials and his tribulations and his distresses he as he's in prison because he's preaching the gospel he sent his disciples to jesus say are you he or should we look for another he was poor in his spirit see life has a way of throwing you curveballs life has a way of throwing you challenges till you get poor in your spirits and if you're not careful you make the wrong decisions when you are poor in your spirits that's why i think that that song that brother solomon was saying too that just goes right along with it he never promised the road um gonna be easy you know you ain't gonna have no trials but he gonna be there with you guys he goes he's going to step in just in time all you got to do is just keep persevering keep pressing on keep being patient just keep waiting on the lord oh hallelujah oh glory to god church amen he's a jesus said he was anointed to preach the gospel the vindicated word to those that are poor in spirit another thing is that he was sent to heal broken-hearted that's how people get to air in their spirits a broken heart can cause you to air in your spirit oh help us lord a broken heart maybe something you thought should have happened but didn't happen it can cause you to air in your spirit but jesus has a word to give to somebody that is broken-hearted it says he was sent to preach deliverance to the captives amen and and again uh and we'll we'll get into all that but but you know a a a person that's captive you can be captive in your spirit brother branham talked about how he went to the cincinnati zoo and when he got there and he saw this eagle that was trying to fly to get above the cage and every time he work himself up and get up so high and just have to come right back down he'd say if he just wished that he had the opportunity to go and just take the cage off and let that eagle go free and as he thought about it saying you know there's a worse condition than the eagle in the cage it says when a son of god or a daughter of god is also bound and can't be free they're in a worse condition than that eagle is and god god god made the eagle to soar into the heavenlies god made you to soar in the heavenlies but you air in your spirit jesus said he came to recover sight to the blood and i love this because if if he came to recover the sight of the blind that means somebody used to be able to see but they lost their eyesight so in order to recover the sight see you had to own it first if you lost it you can recover it amen if you had sight at some point in time that's the only way jesus can recover sight if you never had sight you can't have nothing recovered but if you had it if you used to be able to see this gospel if you used to be able to see this truth there's a way out what you need to do is meet jesus because his ministry is to recover the sight of the blind the other thing that the bible tells us that jesus came to do a set at liberty those that are bruised you know brother branham say cancer can actually happen from a bruise a bruise is something that occurs on the inside and then it manifests itself on the outside but what jesus want to do is bring you healing to your inside the other thing to say to preach the acceptable year of the lord and this was the jubilee year and what we found out about the jubilee year any time the gospel is preached you can have a jubilee so this morning while you under amen this great anointing you can have a jubilee even at home underneath this great anointing you can have a jubilee you can experience freedom like you never experienced before look at this this sermon amen why are people so tossed about look at this look at this statement that's being made here that's why i say you know this this is one of the most anointed messages that you have ever heard look at this look at this some people gets the wrong impression of what the anointing is why are people so tossed about he says did you ever think of that when was the greatest anointing ever give to anyone i guess i forgot to write this one down this one is so important uh do 56-0101 and maybe put 41 in see if it comes up praise the lord i wanted y'all to see this one all right so some people gets the wrong impression is that right okay do 56-0101 and then put impression yeah i think that's the way i wrote it down there we go all right some people gets the wrong impression of what the anointing is did you ever think of that when was the greatest anointing ever given and when y'all here brother smiley about that saying come on he know that this is anointed look look at this he said he said when was the greatest anointing ever give to anyone not not between here and there no that's not the greatest anointing when was the greatest anointing given to anyone i want you to get it here church glory to god i feel anointed in it he said when was the greatest anointing ever give to anyone and what did they do when they had the anointing the greatest anointing that was ever given to anyone was jesus christ we we have it by the by we have the spirit by measure he had it without measure and one day he entered into the temple like we did this morning amen one day he entered into the temple glory to god and picked up the school and read and said the spirit of god is upon me for he has anointed me to preach the acceptable year to bind up the broken hearts to heal the sick gift site to the blind let me just add a little something here amen before i read a little further in this quote this morning we came to prayer and and i noticed brother uh jared picked up a scripture amen out of the book of isaiah to read to the people when you stood up here for song services brother solomon picked up a scripture out of isaiah i believe to read was that isaiah oh i'm sorry it was brother jerry i'm sorry i gave you the wrong credit amen but brother jared picked up isaiah jesus christ when it was given to him the book to read he picked up isaiah and this morning i'm going to tell you already ahead of time my title is found in isaiah glory to god look at this now watch this he says uh and now we would think if such an anointing was on him that had been prophesied 800 years before that it would come and there and here he was with the type of anointing the full blessing and anointed the lord upon him we would want to run all over the building scream and holler but the bible said amen he laid down the scroll and sat down you know you under the greatest anointing right now why are you sitting down and while the word is being poured into you you are under a great anointing change is happening on the inside [Music] and the change that is happening on the inside will be manifested on the outside [Applause] oh my who ever heard the sunrise one of the most powerful things that happens on the earth every day is when it rises and you never hear it but boy i tell you when you sit there other other morning i was driving down the street and it was you know i was i like to play golf and i'm getting ready to go play golf and man it's dark out there and we i see what time my tee time is and say man we ain't gonna be able to see the ball at this this time of morning gonna have to set the tea time a little later but as i'm sitting there they set that tee time because they're they're basing their own on projections as to when the sun gonna rise now it may look dark right now but as i just kept riding to the course and i got my bag out my car and my i start walking up there to go pay my green fees when i come back out it changed just like [Music] and and i'm here to tell you this morning mama and daddy husband wife children whoever you are things are changing just like that hallelujah [Applause] [Music] the prophet says that she says uh uh the full blessing anointed the lord upon him we would want to run all over the building and scream and holler but the bible said he laid down the scroll and sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth that's what he'd done under the anointing look at this the anointing is not emotions the anointing is supreme power in control [Music] the anointing in supreme power and control like knowing exactly what and how see that's that's what's here as we're taking the scripture we understand where where we are we know we can identify things by by by by the word of god we can get encouragement and strength from what the word tells us and and i'm going to read some scriptures here for you in a second amen just just bear with me i got okay i got 25 minutes bear with me ain't no way i'm finished finishing this today but but the probably say the anointing is supreme power control like knowing exactly what and how now now another statement that he makes if your religion doesn't have emotion bury it see so so that don't mean take the take take the emotion out of the church that's not what we're talking about but we need to understand that amen if your emotions are not producing a change in your life then the sermon never hit the target if we can preach between here and there and everybody get all excited but it don't produce a change in your life we miss the target we're not here to preach their emotions but we're here to preach to your soul i want to tell you what the anointing come to do the anointing comes to destroy the yoke let's go to isaiah 10. let's go to isaiah 10. let's look at this lord help me here lord help me here i got so much i want to say and i don't even know if i can get to it all but god knows god knows isaiah 10 verse 24 look at this look at this therefore thus saith the lord god of hosts oh my people that dwelleth in zion be not afraid of the assyrian he shall smite thee with a rod he shall lift up his staff against thee after the manna of egypt for yet a very little while and the indignation shall cease now you're going to go through some trials you're going to go through some stuff but it's going to stop let me tell you every trial got a stopping point it got a starting point and it got a stopping point what you got to learn how to do is just endure glory for a very for yet a very little while the indignation shall cease and mind anger in their destruction and the lord of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of midian at the rock of orb and as his rod was upon the sea so shall he lift it up after the man of egypt and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing i'm looking for yolks to be destroyed even right now while we're preaching this sermon i'm looking for yokes to be destroyed you know for me it's not a joy to see people come into the house of god and go right back out living the same way they were living before they came something's got to change somewhere just like the sun rose with no sound i'm looking for god to do a change in somebody no sound no emotion just something take place on the inside and it manifests on the outside and when you realize what has happened it will produce an emotion i want you to just look at this according isaiah 10 24 the children of israel were going to bondage like they were in egypt this is what isaiah is saying god told him not to fear as there would be a mighty deliverance amen and and in the promise why he's given him this promise and told him that the yoke are going to be strong because of anointing during this promise he told him to look back at two events amen two events uh in verse 26 it said the lord of hosts should stir up a score a scourge for him according to the slaughter of midian at the rock of orab and as his rod was upon the sea so shall he lift it up after the man of egypt so so so so what we had to do i mean just to kind of understand this prophecy you got to look back hey man at these two events that god could take the children of israel back to and i think we can also uh go on the same journey when they went back to amen what happened in midian at the rock of orb this is when gideon's army had been raised up good god almighty and when we go back and just think about what god did amen uh there would get his arm gideon was a man when you read them in scripture look like he was fearful and man they were hiding their food and they were doing all kind of stuff to try to protect themselves from the midianites my god and and then god got god of visits give him say you mighty man of valor oh i love the way this comes across because you know when gideon was standing there and from our eyes he didn't look like a mighty man of valor but you got to stop worrying about how people see you and you have to look at yourself how god sees you god called gideon we call him a coward but god called gideon a mighty man of valor you say say well you know if you if you're supposed to be so supernatural where the miracles we don't we read about it but we need to see it now say oh i'm glad you asked for the miracles because i'm gonna use you to be a part of the miracle gideon you got to be careful what you ask god for you might become part of it get him get himself uh okay say take your men down here to the water getting started got 32 000 soldiers i think i can go conquer anything with this yeah let's go fight he said no no get in no no no no no no i need to just make an announcement ask him if anybody's scared just go ahead and go back home next thing you know they made the announcement and one after one to take it off go on what is this i think he was down to 10 000. just like that one message one sermon one sermon he lost uh 22 000 soldiers in one sermon they say well okay all right ten thousand that's why i said no we ain't we ain't we ain't we ain't finished yet get in we ain't finished we we got a little bit more to do take them down to the water and let them drink at the water now uh the ones that drink a particular way i want you to push them to the this side the ones that drink another way you push them to the other side now now what what some of them did they got prostrate on the ground just laying out on the ground and drinking water getting it now god said if you see them do that put them over there and i said if you see something get down like this start scooping it up like that he said i put them to another side see the ones that's doing like this they drinking they water but they also got the eye on the enemy and you need people that can keep their eye on the enemy he said he said he say uh he said i put them to the side so the ones that was just scooping it up like that and just drinking while they're still watching 300. i had an army of 10 000. first i had 32 000. i lost 22 on the first sermon now i got another i preached another sermon and now 9700 gone and god said you're left with 300 now 300. take this group right here gideon and go down there to media can you imagine he's saying no i'm really i'm really having a hard time with this one i'm really he started asking for fleeces and all kinds of stuff god gave him every fleece that he wanted and then the last thing god told him said now you still a little discouraged ain't you i know i don't know say now i just want you to get up one of your friends go down into the heart into the camp of midian and you're going to hear something that's going to encourage you he went down there to midian and when he got there uh that a guy had just had a dream and when he had a dream he started telling his friend you know his dream and you know it's just amazing even the enemy could interpret the dream the enemies say you know oh damn that they ain't nothing but the sword again we gonna die and he he here get giddy and heard what they heard even when it's 300 he knew that there was more on his side than was on their side so so so what he did was develop his strategy and what you need to do even though you got a little bit that you're working with develop your strategy with your little bit develop your strategy don't wait for god to overflow use the little bit that you got and develop a strategy [Applause] use what you got what's that you have in your hand use that [Applause] put a hundred over here and take some pots and pictures no man we need swords no pots and pictures we're just gonna make noise on this side of those on that side and lamps and we just gonna look like we crazy they ain't gonna know how many of us out here and we're gonna defeat this this this this this enemy because god told us to come down here look it wasn't gideon fighting about any it was god in gideon fighting the battle the prophet told him go back go back go back and look at what i did with midian amen at orb go back and look at that right and then he told him say uh uh uh also says and and his rod was upon the sea socially lifted up after the man of egypt so they had to go back and look at what happened in israel when they were coming out of egypt here you know we we noticed that uh it took god the supernatural god to get them out of that place he had given them a promise that they was going to be in bondage for 400 years i told you the devil has a stopping point can i put it this way your bondage has a stopping point the air in your spirit has a stopping point you can only go so far like that somewhere down the road down the line god gonna turn you around i got a confidence in my god i got an assurance in my god i got a promise from my god you say that say say moses go get my people out of there and and moses went marching down there with a stick in his hand one stick to take over the greatest army in the world with a stick in his hand but he had a supernatural god that was dwelling with him and as he threw god said throw the stick down and watch it turn to a snake and moses oh yeah something's supernatural these guys gonna be afraid of this and then when he stood there pharaoh say oh man that's all you got moses man we've been doing that for years janice and jamers come show moses what you got they took they sticks and threw them down moses saw that but here's the thing moses did not get frustrated moses did not get taken aback if god told me to throw it down he had a purpose for me throwing it down now i'ma sit here and just wait on god and before you knew it moses snake just went to one snake open up his mouth and gobbled nah it snake i i ain't never heard no snake eating snake i don't know about that but but here here you know most men go and gobble don't you think maybe the other snake would have thought man i better get out of here no he sat there and the snake molded snake went over and gobbled him saying now where your sticks at janice and jamboree your sticks are inside of my stick and you put some more down here we'll eat them up too god was showing himself on moses behalf finally they got to the point and you know all the plagues and everything falling in egypt death come to the firstborn first born son they they go through this plague and darkness and water turning the blood i mean lights and i mean you name it flies all kind of plagues that they were having following the the people in in egypt we just tie this please let them people go and when they when they left church i need you to understand you go back and read your bible you'll find that they did not leave broke now they might have been broke while they were dead but the night before they left they went and borrowed some jews they went and borrowed this and i been born expensive stuff and then the people got to say just leave take our stuff with you as well they left rich that just that's just my revelation i don't believe i'ma leave here poor now i know i'm not preaching you know prosperity but i don't believe i'ma leave here poor that's just me if they leave poor i ain't leaving poor and i'm getting ready to go to the streets of gold i'm trying to come home i'm trying to come home but but but uh here they they left and as they get there to the the the sea god had told moses said now don't take them a certain land a certain way because i don't want them to get into battle too early and get discouraged but take them this way take them this route and as they went towards the sea here come pharaoh's army got behind them and chastened them and and god had to separate with a pill of fire amen that he stopped the armies of pharaoh and then he allowed the children of israel to say now now moses got to spend what am i going to do now lord he's saying now what you're going to do he say don't don't cry to me and speak and go forward no no no cry i know it looked bad i know it looked impossible but one thing you don't do when it looked bad and when it looked impossible one thing you don't do you don't cry see when i was i said that last sermon stop stop stop stop crying yeah you ain't got to cry you know god lives up god well i was going to say god don't cry but he did cry at the grave of lazarus but he also stopped crying and lazarus came forth he said no don't cry moses don't cry no no no no nothing speak and move forward but it's what in the way speak and move forward and what i noticed here amen in the scripture uh there's a couple of things maybe we'll read it exodus 14 verse 13 through 15 we'll read it and according to my time i got 11 minutes 11 minutes i'm i'm winding up praise the lord i'm just getting started i ain't we ain't even got nowhere yet but just just bear with me here in in uh exodus uh 14 verse 13 says and moses said unto the people fear you not stand still that's what some of us need to learn how to do that was another word that came out like stand still and see the salvation of the lord fear you not stand still see the salvation lord which he will show to you when today for the egyptians whom you have seen today you should see them no more again forever now no they see them again no more forever now god never told moses to say that moses said that under inspiration and since he was god's prophet god had to back up what he said can i say something else since you are god's child since you are god's brides god gonna back up what you say [Music] moses said unto the people feeling not stand still and see the salvation lord which he will show you today for the egyptians whom you've seen today you should see them again no more forever next verse uh it says the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace and look at this verse 15 and the lord said to moses wherefore christ now unto me speaking to the children of israel that they go forward now skip down to verse 16. this is what i uh i guess it's the next verse and this is where i like but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea so so in order for the sea to open up moses had to lift his hand up and stretch out the rod hallelujah it was moses by moses act of obedience amen the sea opened up and the children of israel crossed on dry ground but now let's go to verse 26 through 28 moses open it up by stretching out the rod amen but the same moses the lord said to moses stretch out thy hand over the sea that the waters may come again unto upon the egyptians upon their chariots and upon their horsemen so he stretched it out to open it up but he also stressed it out to close it up and moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea returned to strength when the morning when the morning appeared and the egyptians fled against it and the lord overthrew the egyptians in the midst of the sea the next verse i believe is that right yes uh and the waters returned and covered the chairs and the horsemen and all the hosts of pharaoh that came into the sea after them they remain not so much as one of them i want to let you know that you have the power to bind and loose because the bible say whatever you buy on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven moses demonstrated this power it was him stretching his rod he loosed the red sea and they walked through on dry ground but after the children of israel got through on dry ground he stretched to rod again and he bound the red sea and it drowned pharaoh in his army you got the power to bind and to loose but keep your spirit right i have a little something here that i just want to make mention of give me this last quote then i got some scriptures that i'm going to read and i'll close amen this portion of it here i want to read from a paradox i just been trying to go back and forth and show you uh it's one thing where we can look back at these things and moses gideon we can see scriptures fulfilled in their day but we got to be able to see where we at now and when we come and we talk about this message that god sent us through uh his prophet william branham that's god fulfilling his word for this day that that was god's way of fulfilling his word and like i said earlier uh we we need light we need light on the manifested word i mean the word of god has to be manifested by the day for us to understand what god is doing and when we have that light we don't want to be like the man going into the basement shutting ourselves off from everybody see ain't nobody gonna join you down in that basement when you air in your spirit hallelujah right you know oftentimes we want people to join our pity party i don't like pity parties i don't enjoy them right i don't i don't like them so so i mean it's hard to just kind of get down there all you want when you see somebody pity party you just want to kind of give them something to kind of get them out of it just snap out of it snap out of it right but god doesn't done too much for us to have a pity party remember everything ain't going to go your way all the time that's right that's fine all things work together for you good it may not be good but it's still working together for you good but you know we look at these things but we got to be able to see what god has done in our day and and and we don't want to reject the light that has been given to us for this day we don't want to do that got to be careful and it's very easy to do that when you start airing in your spirit mistake in your spirit you can recover it ain't over you can recover from it oh god's arms are open why god realizes that people will air in their spirits it's gonna happen happen to the best of us john the baptist it happened to him and you want to know why it happened because of his trial he was in prison and like all i'm doing is preaching the gospel and because he was kind of in prison couldn't see his way out didn't know what was going to happen all over he preached one sermon one day to this this lady that came to church late walked into the church with her husband her new husband because they had a marriage and divorce problem amen and and john had to scream out from the pulpit it's not lawful for you to have her then kept on preaching the sermon and she could just say heroic say oh are you talking to me i'm gonna have to get him and she she she had she had vow in her spirit i'm gonna get this man and one day she raised up her daughter to dress a dress a certain way and to dance a certain way that's why we believe is we don't do this stuff no we don't we don't carry ourselves like that he say i'm i raise up and say i know your daddy i know your daddy he's a drunk he's a lush he's a got a love spirit on him watch this watch this watch this now i want you to dress like this put this on put that on and go out there and dance turn that music on boy she been getting a twirl and do all kind of stuff and boy that man was so drunk he lusted after his own step daughter can i tell you all the bible lusting after his own step daughter and here here you know uh get so bad and say whatever you want up to half the kingdom you can have it girl didn't know what to do with that kind of power went running to her mama mama he say up to half the kingdom what should i actually owe up to have the kingdom tell them you want the head of john the baptist on the platter she went running back out there and said uh said uh uh i want the head of john the baptist on the platter and now he was drunk but when he heard that he kind of [Music] you want me to kill a prophet even a drunk king was afraid to kill a prophet now what about people today supposedly in their same mind they can come against the prophet with anything call a prophet a liar no he ain't a liar you a liar and you you just aired in your spirit two-minute warning can i just uh let me read this this is coming from the message of paradox i'm gonna leave you with a couple promises a paradox he says but we're promised according to revelation 10. and according to malachi 4 saint luke 22 17 and so forth that there has got to come an ephesians to this that means a coming out in exodus just like moses was brought out uh god's people gonna be brought out amen and ephesians says there's promised it friends there must come in ephesians that these sevenfold mysteries of the word of god must be unfolded and it's in the landscaping age that this takes place i believe that we're there i believe we're right in the shadows of the coming of the son of god and as joshua just before the ephesians raised up so did john the baptist raise up just before the next ephesians and we're promised another ephesians it's predicted here in the scripture therefore i think that we're living in the ephesians age back again we're promised that what was left off during those seven seven ages now you cannot add nothing to the book or take nothing from it revelation 22 18 says so who will ever uh who will ever will add one word or take one word his part will be taken from the book of life now we cannot add a take so therefore we know that luther could not get to it wesley and so forth the reformers knocks feeling calvin and so forth on down so forth they didn't get it all but what they had was the gospel but now in the last days we are given the understanding i love this promise we're giving the understanding by the word oh you might have aired in your spirit but we're given the understanding by the word that we are going to understand we're going to understand it because it'll come in ephesians age to it and we're here now paradox i'll leave that hang because i've just got about 10 more minutes and then we'll have a prayer line now i just my timer just went off and i'm going to read these scriptures and i'ma close i love the way he just said we're giving we're giving the understanding by the word that we're going to understand that's a promise that's looming over each and every one of y'all you're given the understanding by the word you are going to understand and notice where he said that in the message paradox you know what a paradox is is some something unbelievable how did so and so change they used to be like this it seemed unbelievable but it's true i got i got i i want to i want to make this statement i'm going to read about three or four scriptures we have too many promises from god to give up on anybody [Applause] too many promises from god for you to be talking about giving up on anybody so i'm going to read you some promises and i'm going to give the service back to brother solomon one of the most powerful sermons i ever heard aired in spirit when i when i preached from here to there so many i appreciate all your comments i i really do i thank you for it god has to give us sermons like that god has to do it it's not anything brother jack can do but god has to give it but uh my nephew called me when i got home he said that that's that's one of them sermons that you know that you can take just about anywhere i say i appreciate that so your mama said the same thing you know i was out eating and i i said i appreciate that i appreciate you know even my niece said my my niece my cousin uh my cousin said man i heard that sermon i was just i got texts from all over people that heard the sermon i appreciate that but this [Applause] this is the most powerful sermon up to this point that god has given us too many promises from god to give up on anybody let's get john 10 verse 28 through 29 and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand john 6 39 look at this and this is the father's will which he has sent me that all that of all which he have given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day god ain't gonna lose one i don't care what it looked like god is not gonna lose none of his amen amen acts 2 38-39 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call you got a promise on your child don't give up on your child no matter what you see no matter what you hear don't give up you got a promise hold on to what he said in his word isaiah 43 verse 1 through 8. let's look at it isaiah 43 verse 1 3 but now thus saith the lord that created thee o jacob and he that formed thee or israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name amen brother quaker amen that's what he's been preaching to us i have called thee by thy name thou art mine glory to god when thou passes through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee that tells me that the same god that was with the hebrew boys is with me he will take you through the fire glory to god he'll take you through the fire again look at this it says for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy savior i gave egypt for thy ransom ethiopian fever for thee since thou was precious in my sight thou has been honorable and i have loved thee therefore i will get will i give men for thee and people for thy life it says fear not for i am with thee look at this look at this promise for i who gonna do it who's gonna do it who is i the lord gonna do this the lord did that thing amen it says for i will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west i will say to the north give up and and to the south keep not back oh come on somebody bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the earth even everyone that is called by my name for i have created him for my glory i have formed him ye i have made him if he's god's child if she's god's she can't get oh away too many promises to give up on anybody [Applause] says bring forth the blind people to have eyes and the death that have ears one more scripture a promise i want to give you and i'll cut it off here today and pick up again on next week isaiah 29 i think i want to start reading at verse 22. actually you know what yeah i'll i'll i'll i'll just go to verse 22 for right now therefore thus saith the lord who redeemed abraham concerning the house of jacob jacob shall shall not now be ashamed neither shall his face neither shall his face now wax pale but when he seeth his children the work of mine hands whose hands your child is a work of god's hands when he sees his children the work of mine hands in the midst of him i like that i just i see him in church i see him when he sees his children the work of my hands in the midst of him they shall sanctify my name you're going to live right they shall sanctify my name and sanctify the holy one of jacob and shall fear the god of israel they also that aired in spirit shall do what shall come to understanding and they that have murmur shall learn doctrine [Applause] [Music] [Applause] ain't no more to say when god said that he said it all too many promises to give up on anybody i don't care what they're going through i don't care it's just a mistake an air air they air the air everybody make mistakes but god said you're going to come to an understanding and i just read the quote to you brother branham say we are given to understand we're going to understand oh i just thank god now i got another quote that i can read right there but i'm gonna just save it for next week i'm gonna save it for next week i'm gonna save it for next week i i i'll just give you just a little snippet of it i won't read it i'm gonna read it next week but brother branham said brother branham said this and this is this is for you mothers this is for the mothers it's for mothers because he said it in mother's day he said somehow the supernatural is gonna untangle the knots [Applause] and they might have aired in spirit but the knots can be untangled somehow i don't know how i don't know how you're going to get your questions answered actually what i what i do realize that some of your questions are not even questions and that's why you don't need no answer it's just an air and spirit but the promise of god say those that air in spirit shall understand they shall come to an understanding let's pray god your word is real your word is perfect your word is true so we look at these promises lord that's been given to us it's hard for us to just give up and quit we realize god the spirit the spirit man can be impacted we realize that but god you're the one that comes to bring healing to
