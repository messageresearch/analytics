let's stand tough feet and let's read a couple scriptures a man we will continue our journey a man on it happened at Calvary and just a couple other things that we want to make mention thank you so much man we we want to read from 1st Corinthians chapter 15 we read this on last week we just took one verse but I'm read a couple more today and then I want to read from Hebrews 13 a man praise the Lord so here in the 1st Corinthians 15 and it's just so good to see the brothers just in the places it is a blessing it really is real real good to hear we've been real good to see real we had a little meeting last week and some things that we want to just be a little bit more 10 of us because the devil busy inside of churches nowadays and a man praise the Lord but I want to let y'all know y'all got something greater than a movie in your possession yes I'm much greater than a movie remember the Lord told us no fear and the reason we don't have to half here because we got something greater all right that's the spoken word hey man you got that in your possession praise the Lord that a stop triggers a man in a stop triggers your mouth can stop it all right you just need to know who you are in Christ that's all a man but we still you know gonna be doing what we can and make sure y'all safe brothers are watching in the parking lot they're doing all kind of things you know they think they on duty but if they you know don't keep them out there o night you know I'm saying praise our Lord all right you can you can call that person on the phone all right first Corinthians 15 let's read this verse 20 says this but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead for as an Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order Christ the firstfruits afterward they that are Christ's at his coming then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the father when he should have put down all rule and all authority and power for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death a man let's turn amen also over to Hebrews 11 want to thank the Lord for bringing sister charelle back seat but she was away for a little bit there I want to thank God for bringing her back safely here in Hebrews I'm sorry I've said eleven it's chapter 13 verse 11 and the Hebrews 13 verse 11 man says for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary five by the high priests for sin our burnt without the camp so they brought in by the high priest for sin but then they're burned without the camp is like a destruction pretty much for that body the offering that they were making he says verse 12 Paul says wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate pretty much outside the camp right let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach but for here we have no continuous City but we seek one to come amen the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word let's pray father we thank you for the ability to read the word but we trust that the Holy Ghost would help us to understand what it is that we have read as the Holy Spirit led Paul to write these things now the Holy Spirit God would bring clarity for us through amen the word that will be shared today may you get all the glory all the honor a man out of this portion of the service as we have felt your spirit thus far we pray that you continue to take us forward in Jesus name we ask it amen amen god bless you can be seated we are continuing our journey a man on it happened at Calvary and I want to just kind of pick up a couple things that we were talking about last week and then just kind of move it forward a little bit but let me just go back in and and just rehearse I mention these things but didn't necessarily read them so let me let me go to the sermon the possessing the enemy's gate I want to read something there and then you know we'll go we'll go for it too maybe one other quote from there and then I got some things I'll share possessing a man the enemy's gates praise the Lord says God had been testing the patriarch because he had given him a promise a man and this is something that you need to understand that after you get a promise you're gonna get a test alright God had been testing the patriotic because he had been given he had given him a promise and and when God makes a promise he wants to be sure that this person is worthy of the promise before he fulfills what he said or what he promises hey man so you know the other thing that happens with the test when you when you get one amen that's a sign that God got confidence in you right the test could not come the job a man until God actually approved it was going to go to jail right so so here some things are coming into our lives God allows it to happen but it's because it gots confidence in us and the other thing is a man like the Prophet tells us here he wants to be sure that the person that'sthat's get this promise is worthy to receive it before he fulfills it let's go on he says so Abraham have been promised that through his seed the whole world would be blessed that he'd have a son and the son out of him should come forth the seed that would bless the whole earth and Abraham when the promise was given to him was 75 years old and Sarah his wife was 65 years old but the Bible tells us that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise to God and you know and I know that's what Paul said in Romans 4 but like I mentioned last week the reason that Paul could say that especially if you go back to Genesis and you read the storm Abraham he staggered quite often they may he he was always trying to help he did a lot of things that that with cars want to say this man was not a man of faith this man was a man of doubt hallelujah but the reason that Paul could write that in Romans quo amen about Abraham is because before Abraham staggered God gave him an unconditional covenant hallelujah I love that just because before you stagger did you get it Church before before before amen are you try before your tribulation before and then you're out of them until you fail here you felt before my failure God gave me an unconditional covenant and because I've got that unconditional covenant that's why I'm standing where I'm standing today right it ain't getting got nothing to do with me but it's all about what Christ has done such as a beautiful picture when you begin to see it the youth not being the devil I have nothing that he can hold over our heads no I didn't do it you did that in do it you didn't know I didn't do it it wasn't me that did that hallelujah not them not not not to see their Abraham he wouldn't do things like that that the seed of Abraham was covered that's why you know when you look through he looked through the blood you don't see nothing but you know I mean ran through Red Sea white oh my red sin through his red blood I'm white as snow glory to God all right come on let's let's keep going here he says he says but the Bible tells us Abraham stacking not the promise of God through unbelief of a strong giving praise to God and God time after time tested him but he come to the final test before the blessing was going to happen right he come to the final test before the blessing was going to happen and and and you know brother Branham call that final chances that being tested to the very limit to the to the limit till you can take no more and see some of y'all at that spot right now like boy I don't know what i'ma do I'm back - I'm back - I'm back I'm about to fall apart here but you being tested to the very limit oh my god right I mean when you get there either one of two things gonna happen you got either have a breakdown until you get to the very limits I can't take another step this is hit right here if God they come through right now I don't know see so easy you can have a breakdown or you can have a break too and to have his people in that place [Applause] see we thought yeah I'm the weakest up on Abraham you know for four thousand five thousand years ago but we're to come and pay Abraham's oh we got we got to be able to go through some things and ever everybody got something going through everybody hallelujah hey man and can I tell y'all something your trial becomes my trial can I also tell you something else your brother or sisters trial next to you becomes your trial now we do have our individual things but when you are part of the body and when you're hurting I'm hurting brother if I just if I took a hammer and hit this stone do you know my feet were village my mouth will village my mouth will respond to what happened to the thumb my mouth will yell [Music] see so we all impact it when when somebody's going through don't thank us on the island by yourself [Music] you know I heard from the trout on the phone this morning I found an eighth you in here what's going on I like that I like that see that's why we got here early like we should be able to scout you know who what time people usually get here you you you have an expectation so everything I hear what's going on and and you know and sometimes you know you you can you can read between the lines you have my car broke down but you didn't call me to ask me for an arrived so that's not accepted it's not accepted I'm gonna tell you when you make excuses they only pacify one person you ain't nobody else been pacified by that you are the only person being pacified by your excuse so you might as well shake it off pack it under your feet and keep pressing forward if we're not gonna leave one cows hoof behind and if God was so concerned about a cow huh how much more is he concerned about you come on now all right Church let me keep going here but I think we ought to be able to kind of do that you know pick up on some things glory to God amen amen I mean atmosphere like that you want everybody to experience it man you could have got what you needed that's why the devil is fighting you can't you see that and I saw two of my brothers man they was going through I mean just the devil just flag them trying I mean couldn't get they did working everything got to get here and finally worked out and when I you know I saw them as they were coming in coming in late before they was busing it what's in it trying to get through the door I said that's what I'm talking back I mean we're a my a my side lollygagging I'm late that's when I'm back that I mean come on you took out this show card you mean there's this I can talk about that later but I gotta get into the presence come on church all right let me keep going here all right hey man listen we said so I says he come to that final test before the blessing was gonna happen right you got to get to the final test before the blessing you know one of the things that you look for in a lot of life situations is what type of tests have you gone through oh I watched that and in Christians and in it just I want to know what kind of test you done going through cuz I'm gonna take some as a as a Christian every Son of God that comes to God must be tried and see when a person's being tried you can't happen Oh Lord yeah I'm off my nose okay I don't let my nose you can be the one that helped him when they're going through a trial let me help you to understand brother Branham talked about how does the caterpillar you know he gets into the cocoon and when he gets into the cocoon there's a reason for him being in that cocoon hallelujah there's some things that are happening inside the cocoon that you might not move out but in the cocoon is developing truth in the cocoon he's developing wings in the cocoon he's going through a transformation [Applause] and she you want him to get in the cocoon in order to go through the transformation because if he makes it out of the cocoon he don't be no more he gonna come forth a beautiful butterfly but you want to help the cocoon process you got to synthesize and you cut the cocoon why they in there trying to work it out me and you just try my hurry to process [Music] know you're doing is hurting the caterpillar peeing I'll never be able to fly because of your help actually you thought you was helping but you hindered that's why you got to leave things alone and just let God do what God do hello somebody a man now take that and apply it brains God now I'm also say something here I heard y'all y'all back took over the song because I was singing up here if they play my last song y'all back took it over that's good I like y'all getting them joy with the worship but I want your pool I want your pool to take over the sermon [Music] [Applause] my brothers - I don't get quiet now [Applause] not now not now I got time to praise God with your loud voice alright praise all over I'm bringing the word Oh y'all y'all just I tell you what I tell you what I tell you we started this journey off on a ritual versus relationship because it very easy to come get ritualistic you know a nice song hoop everybody run around the church dancing and praising God I think you didn't you leave him look like a devil [Music] ain't gonna work what's your shop what you did all that fun you're gonna go live like the devil amen praise the Lord I don't know I love mine I mean like like for prophecy don't jump no hide and you live all right all right let me go on I got I got low out you know how glory glory glory I'm when I come the spirit and truth I'm not an evangelist when I go out on the field I'm deep into this I take an evangelistic anointing but when I come in here I got to be the pastor and now y'all gonna y'all gonna see me take this same sermon somewhere else into my brother Jack didn't preach it like that he couldn't because the people were living in a different place so the pool kept bringing them right back down keep trying to go up here but the pool keep bringing them back down but you know what but but I'm when I realized that the devil trying to pull it back down then I got the elevate and there are some things that I want to say that's gonna cause you to go getting your Bible Oh hallelujah it'll get you off Facebook it'll get you off Instagram it against you in your Bible then it gets wrong snapchats any other to that The Devil's trying to use to take our time YouTube God - huh Netflix huh what about TV something that a shuttle and calls me to get into the Bible all right glory to God that's what that's where we're trying to go church man I'm trying to get people ready for a rapture I do not care who won the game I don't care i'ma say it again I don't care and I'm talking with Saints I shouldn't have to talk that now when I'm talking with people that don't know nothing right they don't really know the Lord and you know you got to find somewhere to break in and on some things but we're Saints that's not what I'm talking about I want to talk about the word with you amen you know you know who did I'm not I got no interest and I you know it used to be a time where I was all into that stuff I was there was a time where you know I had a I used to get the newspaper and I bought the newspaper for one reason there either to read the sports page that was my reason all the rest of the news did not matter I wanted sports I consumed it consumed it so you know here I got that sports page and and one day I was going down going I mean it was bad church I'm just telling myself it was so bad that one day I was driving down the road and I couldn't read the sports page at home so I've driver down the road and and I was sitting at the light and I pulled that sports page open I just started reading right down the console I'm just trying to catch up with you know who did this who did that because I had no TV so I use the sports page to catch up oh yeah I'm talking to somebody right I had see I wasn't watching it right so so you know so I'm using sports pace to catch up you know and and as I'm sitting there the light you know just just looking at that before I know it my friend I left the break and thank God it was just at the light and I hit this lady very nice Mercedes and when I ran into the lady Mercedes she jumped I said I can't ma'am I can't believe it is iiiii I'm not gonna tell you what I was doing but I you know my insurance you know they'll take care of it you know because of I mean I got insurance they'll take care you know and I made it through that situation you know but I realized that that thing was consuming me I would say something that God told me to say to y'all i'ma say something there used to be a time and I'm Lord I'm gonna come back to this it happened at Calvary it used to be a time that you did not find women talking sports you didn't find that amongst women ladies State ladies they did not they did not delve into that area but now you find ladies talk more about it than men y'all better watch that spirit there used to be a time limit i'ma say this too I'm here I'm here see when you know ladies playing basketball right that was a time you didn't see that now it's become so common and and there was a spirit that came with the basketball you just saw the basketball but it was a spirit following the basketball and it was a homosexual spirit if y'all just say y'all y'all look around I mean it ain't nothin but the truth and now our kids getting involved in all this kind of stuff it's a spirit [Music] when you think I don't mean for it to go that far you need to stop at the early parts somebody need this started on I went too far with this I'm turning around I'm going back the other way a man church right we got to get there amen yeah can I still feel the pool I ain't got past the first quote yet amen amen I got Lord Jesus I got much to sing all right so y'all stay with me amen amen don't worry don't go nowhere don't leave yet don't leave yet we got motive see like they say don't turn that radio off all right come on it's time totally this final test that Abraham got to write that that final test and it said that that's the way it is with all the seed of Abraham God gives us the final test just before he gives the promise and if it was possible he said I'd like to say something here personally but but I would hold that the final test to see how you react upon him and when he gave Abraham this test he found Abraham just as true as he was when he started what a blessing it would be this morning if we who take his promise of healing was banned just as true as we did when he stood and accepted it no matter what the doctor saying it stand just as true he goes on say this day and when he did this and never withheld his only son but was about to plunge the knife into Isaac's bosom to destroy his testimony he testified all over the earth all over the known earth that he was acquainted with that he was going to have this son and then when the Sun came he was asked to double back and to destroy the only hope that he had was testimony to people feel and when God seemed that he was loyal to that faith that he had in God God looked out of the heavens and he said I swore by myself then I'll bless you and multiply you you and your seed shall possess the gate of the enemy God was impressed by what he saw Abraham and God wants to be imposed by what he sees in you what a promise all right I got to go on I want to go to the Cedars it's not air at the shuk I hit this last week but I want to come and just hit it again a little bit remember Galatians 4 verse 33 31 says nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the bondwoman and her son but the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman so then brethren we are not the children not children of the bondwoman but of the free you know and I'm hitting this because people trying to get us to compromise with this word and we're not gonna compromise I'm not apologizing for the message I'm not apologizing for the truths that came out if y'all need somebody apologize ask God he's the one that sent it I just believe it but I'm not apologizing for what's in it amen but people want you to compromise in certain ways no no we're not compromising with this we're just gonna say what the prophecy right and you know so cuz you know the question was actually do you think God could you know I mean if a person just didn't know didn't know you think that God will hold that against them if they just didn't know so I said well now that depends it depends on who you're talking about that's because the rich young ruler knew and when he come to Jesus and ask a question right Jesus gave him the answer that he was looking for but he turned away from the answer and so when and when he lifted up his eyes and Hale according to description that was his fault not Jesus father I said but I do believe that there be some thieves on the cross to and the thief that was his first time and only time that he can receive truth he accepted it and he was rewarded for but if a person got willfully willfully reject truth that's been presented to them the bothers thing that remains the most chakra fights for your sins that's Hebrews a man church so I mean it's just you know we're not gonna compromise with look you've got the total line a man a man there is no there is no you know what if what if no no no that we not talk about them we're talking about you now what have you reject the truth after knowing it you got question for everybody else but I'm bringing it back home you what's gonna be your end praise our Lord we got trying to be the savior for everybody else and we lost all right C does not air at the shuttle look at what he say here here the see once the Nazis but once C these other were not seed of Abraham because Abraham C was his faith seed that God was speaking of not his natural seed because after Sarah died Abraham married another woman and had seven sons besides daughters so wouldn't be Abraham seeds it was Abraham seed one and that was Abraham's faith see pointing to the Roya see that was to come through Abraham's faith not Abrahamson afterlife but Abraham's spiritual life who took everything contrary to God's Word and called it as though it was not and believed God against hope believed in hope that's the real see we're speaking on so that's why the rapture is different and will only be for the royal seed of Abraham it cannot come by the natural carnal seed of the church it'll have to be the royal seed of the word of God through Abraham the royal seat that's what the rapture has to be first because remember we which are alive and remain shall not hinder prevent those which are asleep for the trumpet of God they men shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise first we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them together and meet the Lord in the air notice and again it's written and the rest of the Dead lived not for a thousand years therefore they will not be heirs together listen there will not be in the rapture together y'all get that they want to know if they're gonna make the rapture no they're not that the seed of the of the bondswoman will not be in the rapture with the seed of the freewoman let me just put it this way denominational seed will not make the rapture so I'll put it this way if they're if they're true seed like I was true seed and denomination I'm gonna hear the mother Eagle cry you're gonna hear the mother Eagle cry that's what's gonna happen that's my brother branham share that said when that when that Eagle took off looking for his other as other eaglet that was stuck inside of a chicken coop and it let out a scream that little that little eaglet down there Muslim chickens finally realized I belong up there not down here and they'll come out ever since I've been back from Israel got two calls from the radio people that have heard the word on the radio and said that the message is bless them - since I've been back from Israel see that and that day up in Palm Bay one in Vero one was in Palm Bay people hearing the word see I mean even even when brother it wasn't the local people that came to church it was people coming from all over the place and that's the way to be today people driver I mean somehow to chummy has taught me to come 30 minutes and I said oh we got Saints in our church that come an hour and a half south with the pressure back on them don't tell me you can't come thirty minutes the Queen of Sheba went further than that see I think how trip was ninety days on the back of a camel through the desert and you got a cop and can't come to church no no no I don't care where you at I don't care how far you away from here if it's truth you need to get the truth oh my my my go back to read the book of what that mark I think it was where when they found Jesus was in the house man they got out the house and they went to find where Jesus was in the house and when they got there something happened hey man Church so look this says this this that the rapture is not for people that's not following the word bottom line now don't get me wrong I ain't say that they couldn't make heaven I just say they can make the rapture the raptures for his his bride well regards to one going to a wedding supper for two God when you go to you know the wedding supper it ain't it ain't for everybody else is for the bride and the bridegroom lady had to celebrate its back then they had the head table right so you know everybody not invited already got even a wedding everybody not in my head Oh Lord I'm getting there but church is just you know we need we got to stop compromising and and and also just stop you know we can't we got to say what the prophecy the rapture is not for I mean we not when I got I'm not trying to hurt nobody feelings cuz I've been there I was Baptists I was Pentecostal now I'm Christian all right so it's not it's not for everybody it's for those that are following the word all the word because you know so must follow just because we in church when we leave church we do other things against the word God see that he's a 24/7 God you know what he want 24/7 Christians alright I'm here with Abraham and Isaac Jim says 22 - it said that take that now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I would tell the F so we were working with this on last week and how Abraham took Isaac up the same mountain you know where Christ was also being offered for our sins I just I went out when I got the Israel I saw that just really meant so much to meet it to see that it was the same mountain brother branham even brought out multiple coats I can't read them all to you but I have him if you if you ever want him just let me know and I'll send him to you but it says he's took him up the same he'll up the same Hill and it just just just just kind of goes to show you know how how God was tackling himself a man in the life of Abraham that he wouldn't I mean it was just so perfect that it's the same mountain that I'm leading you to my son when he said he said that God was gonna provide himself a sacrifice he wasn't doing number prophesied and when he prophesied God Himself came to the same mountain and offered him offered himself for our sins what a beautiful story now when we look at this burnt offering let's just kind of work with this a little bit we look at this burnt offering aid man it was a sacrifice that was made by fire and it consisted of using the whole animal right it was the whole animal had to be used when you were doing a burnt offering amen other offers that just use part all right this impart that but but when God told Abraham a man in genesis 22:2 he says you can pull that up genesis 22:2 he says he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get into the land of mire and offer him there for a burnt offering it was going to be the complete sacrifice this was the ultimate sacrifice Isaac was don't lose his life that that's what was planned amen at the spot but God knew a man that he was going to provide a substitute and not only did he provide a substitute for Isaac but he provided a substitute for us and I just I just love this too you know that's why I say it wasn't that God sent his son God became the son now death in his son God became the son in order to die $0.05 go back to Isaiah 12 you'll see that right so so so here here we got this dis burnt offering amen it consists of using the whole animal also it was described as an offering that goes up talk to God amen also it was um o my offering that goes up to God amen into his hands he committed a spirit right amen it goes up to God's glory to God amen it was it was turned a continual offering and then the teach the nation of Israel that their sinfulness required a complete and a continual torment and consecration the right also this burnt offering it was offered at the time of Passover the burnt offering see I told y'all gonna have read our Bibles after this you can have to put y'all you put down your phones and go back and read your Bibles amen it was all three at a time of Passover and if you remember Jesus Christ himself amen was open at the time of Passover Oh glory to God now when they all prayed a man at a time of Passover and reason I'm giving you all of this the reason I'm giving you this because I told you Amen it was the yes the stain heal but I said Calabrese was about a four minute walk it was a four minute walk from where Abraham offered Isaac now there's significance to that walk he understand and the significance is found right in Scripture we just ready here in Hebrews 13 instead for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin and burn without the camp so if he was the perfect burnt offering he could not be offered in the same spot Isaac was he had to go to camp [Music] he had to go outside the camp so that for a minute walk was to fulfill Scripture and why didn't why did he tell amber him the brain also get over him as a burnt offering because there's all types all for sin offerings in another time but he's had burnt offering it was gonna be the whole person consumed Christ gave everything y'all and he had to do it outside the camp with that what that meant was outside the city gates and when you go to Jerusalem you see how the gates are just lined up you know like you can just you can see it even on a picture I had a picture I will show you but just on the outside of the gate this is where they had to put him but they don't realize what they're doing they think they think they're doing it too embarrassing but no he's there because that's what His Word says [Music] let's just read a couple of things here yeah we'll just read a couple of things that that's just Oh Lord yeah this justice can I just let me just jump there with me yeah y'all got that part so far right he had to go outside the gate outside oh Jesus let me let me let me read numbers 19 outside the gate he's fulfilling Scripture you go back in Leviticus and Exodus you'll see different times you'll read the scripture and they're off in a Bullock sometime offering a ram it's outside the camp right anytime they're doing that burnt burnt offering it's outside hallelujah glory now numbers 19 they're something that's picked up here verse 1 look at this it says in the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying this is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded stand speaking to the tune of Israel that they bring the red heifer and now when you when you bring this red have to look at it it's got to be without spot now what did they say about Jesus I find no fault in him it had to be without spot right it says he says speaking to the children that they bring the red heifer without spot wearing is no blemish and upon which never came yoke you know what that mean denominational yoke Oh y'all hold on let me let me brother Brown say he say he never got hooked in with denominations he never got hooked in with the Pharisees he never got hooked in with a surgeon he kept coming against him and he said and when we want to go and go to him outside the camp guess what we got to leave denomination you can't go back into denomination you don't find them outside the camp outside the denominational gates if you looking for Jesus you got to leave you got to go outside the camp you might have to go outside your city I'm still reading I'm still reading I'm still real so they bring the arendt heifer without spot wearing his double Emerson pump which never came guilt and he shall give her unto Eliezer now this is the high priest look at this watch this I'm gonna read a quote for you after this so stay with me amen says and ye shall and ye shall give her unto Eliezer so they're getting and for the random saying her always typed the church right you should give her a man until he's at a priest that he may bring her forth without the camp without the camp and one shall slay her before his face so that the red heifer had to be slayed outside the camp before the high priest stay with me and Eleazar the priest shall take up her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times and one shall burn the heifer in a site her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung shall be burned now let's read a couple of things here from the Prophet just to kind of bring clarity on that that scripture that we just read I want to read from the water of separation and then after that the next quote I'm gonna read is Christ that's the title of the sermon at the past I mean that the Prophet preached Christ all right he says the water separation is night now God telling Moses and Aaron and and he was the prophet and priest Moses the Prophet Aaron the priest he said now I want you to go out and get a heifer a young heifer which is all one color one complete color red red always red we always think looks red is danger red the cigarette does signify danger or a life or so forth but read in the scripture signifies redemption through the blood the harlot Rahab when she put the Scarlet streak down and all through the Bible is a scarlet Street redemption comes through and through the shedding of the blood that's why was a red heifer representing redemption right through the shedding of the blood and without the shedding of blood there's no remission of sin listen and how that God said to get this hipper that's right all over not one spots Amen of anything else but perfectly red but God look through red and you know what color red is looking for red red the rent makes white flat one time right through red produces right so when God looks through the blood of Jesus Christ - who - we wash scarlet red with sin and covered by the blood he sees us white as snow though your sins be red like crimson they shall be white like snow I want to go on to the sermon Christ and that's quote I mean that scripture that brother Branham just quoted was Isaiah 1:18 says come now let us reason together a man saith the LORD though your sins be as scarlet they shall be white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool let's go on I want to get to Christ I want you to see this he had that he couldn't be offered in the exact same spot but it was the same heel stained obscenity and here they walking up the same Hill but when Christ died he had to go outside the gate and be offered as a burnt offering outside and we have to go to him outside the gates of denomination all right all right look at this in Christ it says notice this Hepper must be a rent one and now she must never have a yoke on her neck amen it says oh that was that has a great meaning - says wish we had time to go into all this but we don't says but ye but but the yoke meant that Christ was not yoked up with anything on this earth glory to God it's 55 - OH - to one and the paragraph is e - 27 I'm sorry if I didn't write that down 55 55 - Oh two to one and paragraph II - 27 I want to make sure the church gets this says notice the heifer must be a red one and now she must never have a yoke on her neck oh that has a great meaning - wish we had time to go into all this but we don't but the yoke meant that Christ was not yoked up with anything on this earth listen he was not yoked up with any affiliation or organization he was free to move where the Lord moved him be not entangled in the yoke of bondage so now again if somebody talked about going back into domination you're going back into bondage you know what that sounds like to me y'all know what that sound like the me that sound like some people that's the only way to the promised land as they own the way they got it they got involved with the Bible call them a mixed multitude cuz you know you are you ought to know your people you never thought like this you never talk like this you get this from then I got involved with the mixed multitude and another word local wheat a locoweed it and this is what caused them to think this way but but when it's where the children's organic there was a mixed multitude the mixed multitude begin to complain then it's kind of hard it's difficult and it makes multitude like you know what it was better in Egypt not not kara can I tell y'all let me just i'ma just I'm this something this fresh this fresh this is this is fresh this is I mean it's so fresh I gotta come down here and tell it to you I gotta tell it to you I want to be on your level the mixed multitude the reason that Egypt looks so good to them they weren't in slavery of course it looked good to do they were never experienced in slavery but when they got around that the children of Israel and start talking that nonsense the Israelites but about their slavery let's go home but that's the same devil today ain't going back no denomination I remember what it was like hey well none but spirit and now it's worse than it ever been it was bad when I was there now it's worse than ever ain't no way you're gonna get me to go back I'm gonna meet them outside the camp alright let me go in a little further be not entangled in the yoke of bondage yoke yourself not amongst unbelievers but be separated Christ has jumped to one thing and that's his church we were listening to that on Friday night that having an absolute right you know in brother branham's bringing out in that message how you know he called it and I never looked at it this way he said but they it's like it was in the days of judges every man did what was right in his own eyes look at it Baptist Pentecostal Presbyterian Episcopalian Catholic Lutheran arise oneness Tunis Church of God in Christ Church of God by prophecy churches I mean come on I mean which one do we go to it's hard to figure it out and then even amongst the groups they're separated you know separation is so bad that even atheists have denominations it's the truth if you go and look at the Athens they got a chart for who believe what that's the same thing it isn't Christian that's what we called the labyrinth it's very confusing when you get caught in the trap and the lever if you can't find your way out of the maze you need somebody to show you how to leave jobs that's why God sent a prophet to to lead us animes [Music] [Applause] that's that's why I see these Easter he say the reason that in the book of Judges they were in the condition that they were in where they did every man did what was right in his own mouth and because they did not have a prophet but when God gave them prophet then they could see clearly and God gave us a profit now we see clearly I see things in the word that I didn't see before I saw some things a word before I went to Israel that I had never saw before my church that never taught anything like that and I went to multiple churches many of programs heard many of preachers name never heard some of these things nothing none of it and now after going to Israel one time said oh yeah this bottles a new Bible to me I'm seeing some other things now that I want to see in and did not tie right back to the message they oh lord have mercy God thank you Jesus I'm almost I'm coming home I'm coming home I'm coming home I'm coming home there's one thing that I need to tell y'all today and I've just been building up to just tell y'all that when I see it I'm gonna see a couple of things and I'm be gone then if let me finish to read this be not entangled in that yoke of bondage yoke itself not up amongst unbelievers be separated Christ is joke to one thing and that's his church which is not earthly organisation but a heavenly growing group of people that's regenerated by the blood of his own sacrifice but he had no yoke of this earth neither has his church free not yoked up with nothing but their free and yolk with pricey we're not children of the bondwoman we're children of the free woman c33 free from denominational yoke right now the yoke and now don't get me wrong because there's everybody saying we've nondenominational nowadays they just took the Baptist in the Pentecostal name of but they still underneath believe the same stuff you just got a different name hallelujah hey man we not talk about just changing your name we talk about changing your nature listen so now the yoke must never be put upon the neck a very beautiful type of Christ now here's something that's very outstanding she must be killed in the presence of the high priests type of Christ again a sky-high Caiaphas had to had to witness his death and she must be killed without the camp she take her out in a camp and kill her and Christ died without the camp killed in the presence of the high priest as a witness as a public testimony it took him they took Jesus to go Gotha it took them to Calvary John 19 15 through 17 tells us but they cried out away with him away with him crucify him Pilate saith unto them shall I crucify your king the chief priest answered we have no king but Caesar then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified and they took Jesus and led him away verse 17 and journal 19 says and and he bearing his cross went forth and to a place called the place of a skull which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha and and and and I just looked up a man a couple things here the word Calvary meant place of the skull or a place of skull the word Daugava means a heap of skulls the word Moriah meant bitterness of the Lord and and and you know it also means doctrine of the Lord bitterness of the Lord and ocula if we're gonna receive the doctrine of Lord we don't have to go outside the camp to get it but I'll submit the bitterness of Lord just let me work you just just a few more minutes so it's good you know the word the word Smyrna also meant bitter and the believers in that age had to be faithful unto death right the three wise men brought amen their their gifts to God one was gold with representing his deity and then another brought frankincense which represents a service offering and and the third brought murder amen and this was a this was an herb that would anoint one for death an earth that was pictured brother random tells us that Jesus was deity in service to die and thus Jesus himself drink the bitter cup of death for us Mariah represented bitterness of the Lord and there at that same spot Jesus praying amen just across the street in the garlic disseminating saying lord if it be possible let this cup this bitter cup pass from me but it said nevertheless not my will but but thy will be done and I loved it I loved it mark 1436 says instead Abba Father all things are possible unto thee see this is what when you when you're really get into a state of Prayer a man sometimes you get then you realize that when you make me you say certain prayers even though you don't know the perfect will of God you can accept the perfect will of God listen he says all things are possibility take away this cup from me nevertheless not what I will but what thou wilt sometimes we need to drink bitterness the bitter cup we need this wheat I mean sometimes you know it's it's sweet in the mouth but it get bitter in the belly and sometimes you got to take God you got to take God knows just as good as you take is yeses they say sometimes you take that bitter medicine and do your body pretty good it don't taste good going down but it's gonna do good later on Calvary meant this place of skull GOG Arthur meant a heap of skulls and if you ever you know when I went there and I looked at the place of skull when I look at Calvary you can actually see a skull kind of carved in the rock the way that the rock is carved we connect actors to see how that the skull is carved there but they call this the place of skull and this is where now he didn't necessarily die oh this mountain when he actually died was right down at the public road right next to it and the reason he got at the public road next to it the reason when I found out when I was there he said that allow Amanda the people to come by and and and do all the kind of stuff that they did spit on him and hit him and I but but if he was been on the top of the rock then that would have been trouble but it was near the area stay with me here stay with me here stay with me here Kaveri meant the place of the skull Isaac was taken to this place and it was near this place of the skull now I was talking this over with another pastor friend of mine he told me something say you know he don't have no proof of this but he heard just as someone is reading that at the place of skull that David took Goliath's hand and put it at the place of the skull that's good but I found that one a little bit better somebody before David somebody before Goliath that had they had their skull and the place of the skull and the person that I found out was there Adam Adams heads was taken to the place of the skull what am I saying the firt the last Adam died shed his blood at the same spot the first Adam hey it was lame now go back to first Corinthians 15 go back and let's read first Corinthians 15 look at this Paul's words are so perfect for sensed by man came death what man Adam since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dance not only was Jesus not only did he die here in this place but is his grave was right nearby in a rock right near by this place right it says since for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection day for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive I know to be hard for y'all to believe me so I wanted to read a quote out of the Easter seal yelling I'll say a man to me can I get a witness she as I was studying this look at Isaac you know being buried at the same heel as I was studying and all of a sudden this quote came I'm like oh Lord I never seen that before god I never seen that in the message and when I read the quote then I had to go to the Internet to start doing some research then I come to find out there as many people out there say the exact same thing watch what happened here watch would the products a true Easter seal true is to say Christ died at Calvary how that he went up to that cross I was reading a little book here not long ago that on to some kind of a research and in this research I found something most startling I sit down see how the prophets responding this I know it's true because the way he responded I sat down and I leave the book down and raised up my hands and praise God got up walked around a little bit and sat down and read it again I thought always that soul that on this same heel where Jesus was crucified Adam died and was buried on the same heel that Jesus died and was buried on the same Hill where Adam died he died don't go Gotha and was buried Anka Gotha look at this and I thought what appropriate whether it was right [Applause] it's opiate even if it was wrong it's appropriate that says the last Adamek I'm in the same spot as the first atom soon it was it completely Jesus drop the conscious [Music] [Applause] yes nothing against us anymore [Applause] the penalty has been paid [Music] I'm going on let's say it was right let's just see it was right then the first Adam died and was buried and there yet in the dust because he represented the world and the people to sin but the second Adam being the God of heaven when he died on Golgotha there was enough earth to hold him there he rose on the third day and is alive forevermore but the sin problem myself God settled the sin problem there at Calvary that's where the debt was paid when this Adam second Adam died he paid the debt of sin for the human race and the world put him in a tomb and silver money and that tomb let me say we went on the stage you can read it later on but the church is still trying to keep him into him but he's knitted he is alive church and his word is just as real today as it was when it was real everything is Scripture as purpose imma take you know you'll find some of these things all over the internet but you know and and to some people just intellectual stimulation they feel so good about giving it to lecture but for me is my own Lord that where Adam sold us out you could go to the sink now had it how did Adam get to the mountain how did he know where you know God orchestrated where he would even die there's mobile things like that it should find you no just say one that one of Noah's sons the sons took his head took took the skull took his head they kept it through the arc and they took it and they planted it there that's what that's what they say that and they got they got they got I got an article here that just kind of goes to show I'll just read a statement from the article so if these um this is a thing I got off the internet says as an early Christian leader named or rich in this man's name a Christian leader by the name of origin oor iGEM who lived from 185 to 253 AD recorded that Jesus was crucified on the spot where Adam was buried and where his skull had been found whether or not this is true there was an early Christian belief that Jesus had been crucified near Adams burial place as the early story as this early story goes when the earthquake occurred as Jesus hung on the cross amen Matthew 27:51 his blood rain ran down the cross into the crack and the rock below and fell on the skull of Adam this history is so entrenched an early Christian tradition that Jerome referred to it in a letter in 386 ad it says interesting a Jewish tradition right so we got Christian tradition then yeah Jewish tradition states that Adam skull was buried near the city of Jerusalem by Northside Shem tradition says that this barrier of burial place was guarded by Melchizedek who was the priest king of Jerusalem Jerusalem during the time of Abraham see Genesis 14 18 unknown to most Western believers this history is so accepted that is it is considered a major theme of Orthodox doctrine and the skull of atom appears consistently the base of the cross in both paintings and icons if you've if you've ever seen if you ever see a skull at the base of a crucifix you can know that it symbolizes Adams skull that was allegedly found buried at the site of Jesus crucifixion they go on to say these extremely interesting facts although unprovable have retained strong support throughout 2,000 years of Christian history if it were true that's what they said what the Prophet says right if it were true it would be quite amazing that the second Adam Jesus Christ died for the sins of the world exactly on the spot where the first Adam the original sinner was bearing an Origin was keeping his records listen he says he says if it were true it would be quite amazing that the second Adam Jesus Christ died for the sins of the world exactly in the spot where the first Adam the original sinner was buried if Jesus's blood ran down the crack in the stone and fell upon Adams skull as tradition says it would be very symbolic of Jesus blood covering the sins of the human race that originated with that what a mighty God we serve manaphy that specific if he's just that perfect in the way that he does things Church I don't do realize he got everything under control nothing that's happening by chance by accident nothing has happening just be faithful to God God's got it all in control all in control I am I'm grateful maybe I'll just read one more now we'll leave but this is uh this is just a blessing to me all right second hand it wrote a second hand it roll sickness disease diseases affliction seeing everything held the hell the little group of Adams race that day that no one could do nothing about it they were helpless and the devil in his great marching army come marching in well-equipped powerful supernatural beings here set a little natural people with nothing they could do then in heaven something took place there was one stepped out called Jesus the precious son of God he said to the Angels and his brethren this day I'll give my life I'll save Adams race and he came down and was made flesh and dwelt among us one day standing yonder at Calvary when he seen the thickest part that there is an ending human life the darkest part of the spirit of human life is death every man fears death and when Jesus of Nazareth run against every devil there was in Hell and caught death right into his own busines Muslim and conquered death and sent back the Holy Ghost and said take this and do the best you can liberate the people yes the last enemy that was destroyed death and Jesus defeated death at Calvary it all happened at Calvary let's pray mmm God these things are not shared because our hairs to swell but God our hearts should shrink and your presence to see what a great work you did God don't let us leave this church and and go back out and live the same old ungodly lives that we we were living that that's why you started this full series off the ritual versus relationship we can't we can't serve you in a ritualistic form we're not just going to church just to go to church God this is about having a true relationship when we just how perfect you are we as we see it in Scripture with with Isaac now God to hear history has recorded that that Adam was buried right there at Calvary his goal was there and they took Jesus to the place of skulls showing that the work of redemption was complete the red heifer had to go outside the gate symbolizing Christ who would go outside the gate would be offered as a whole offering for the human race only if we would accept it it's not worth it the things that we'd go through this world different things we kind of hold on to maybe some young man holding on to a young lady young lady holding on to a young man God no good for him maybe people that want to hold on to different clothes sisters want to hold on to their pants to their earrings to Lord they're just just a lot of ungodly stuff their makeup their fingernail polish toenail polish Jesus these are things that people want to hold on to things that don't mean nothing god help us to shake free from this stuff other Saints that may get beyond that but they want to hold on to television they want to hold on to you know social media and all this that that was been used a lot at against us but God help us to shake ourselves free the Bible you know the Bible says we got to lay aside every sin and wait and there's some things that are not sins but they are weights please Lord don't don't don't the Prophet said it'll go right through so we won't even know it be sickening your Lord hearing these things and and and it's just going right innocent and right out or please let us draw closer to you we really need that God shake us part that our very core shake us that we would serve you draw us nearer nearer God to me we need
