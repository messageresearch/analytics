[59:14] bible tell us to lay hands on the sin
[59:16] and they shall recover that's our part

[59:24] she said okay and she went on out and
[59:27] got up the next morning reported to the
[59:28] hospital and she got there to the

[59:54] it they won
[59:55] and they pulled over they checked and
[59:57] they looked at it and said wow
[59:59] tremendous improvement you don't need
[1:00:01] surgery you can go on home

[1:11:58] together onto pilate saying sir we
[1:12:00] remember that that deceiver
[1:12:03] said while he was yet alive after three
[1:12:05] days i will rise again
[1:12:07] command therefore that the sepulcher be
[1:12:10] made sure until the third day lets just
[1:12:12] disciples come by night and steal him
[1:12:14] away
[1:12:15] uh and say unto the people he has risen

[1:12:23] the first
[1:12:25] uh pilot said to them ye have a watch
[1:12:28] go your way make it as sure as you can
[1:12:31] so they went and made the sepulcher
[1:12:33] shure stealing a stone and setting a
[1:12:36] watch now i don't know if i'm going to
[1:12:38] have time to get into a little something

[1:12:52] they could
[1:12:53] 100
[1:12:55] men

[1:12:59] i don't care how many people standing

[1:13:20] a man
[1:13:22] 32 and 30.
[1:13:25] it says this how should one chase a
[1:13:28] thousand
[1:13:30] and two put ten thousand to flight
[1:13:32] except their rock had sold them
[1:13:35] and the lord had shut them up
[1:13:38] for their rock is not as our rock
[1:13:41] even our enemies themselves
[1:13:44] being judges
[1:13:46] amen let's pray father we thank you for
[1:13:50] uh your precious word that has been read
[1:13:53] and god uh we ask that you would just
[1:13:55] now anoint our minds to hear
[1:13:58] what the holy spirit would have us to
[1:14:00] hear uh even at this moment be magnified
[1:14:02] and glorified in this portion of the
[1:14:04] service
[1:14:05] um god if there's one that needs healing
[1:14:08] bring healing there's one that needs
[1:14:09] deliverance bring deliverance if they're
[1:14:11] wanting the baptism the holy ghost let
[1:14:13] him be filled even as the word of god is
[1:14:16] being spoken people can be filled with
[1:14:17] the holy ghost
[1:14:19] god make the change in our in our in our
[1:14:21] in our lives god today we ask it in the
[1:14:23] mighty name of the lord jesus christ
[1:14:26] amen amen you can be seated in the
[1:14:28] presence of the lord
[1:14:30] uh we want to just continue our journey
[1:14:32] on iraq is not like our rock
[1:14:35] amen part two amen of this sermon um
[1:14:40] i was um
[1:14:42] just wanting to make mention of
[1:14:44] something here
[1:14:45] uh
[1:14:46] when we when we look at you know this
[1:14:48] word here in scripture their rock is not
[1:14:50] as our rock even as even our enemies
[1:14:52] themselves being judges
[1:14:54] um
[1:14:55] we um we find the reference to rock
[1:14:59] a man all throughout scriptures god
[1:15:02] being a rock amen uh david makes that
[1:15:05] that that that reference in different
[1:15:07] places he the lord is my rock
[1:15:10] and my fortress
[1:15:12] and my deliverer
[1:15:14] and my god you know and my redeemer uh
[1:15:18] david just kept going on and on and on
[1:15:20] talking about his god and that's i kind
[1:15:23] of feel like that today i just want to
[1:15:25] keep going on and on and talking about
[1:15:27] this rock
[1:15:28] amen uh you know i there's a uh another
[1:15:32] songwriter gave a modern song that we
[1:15:34] sing he's my rock my sword my shield
[1:15:38] he's my wheel in the middle of a wheel i
[1:15:41] know
[1:15:42] he'll never
[1:15:44] never let me down
[1:15:47] the the other he kept on going so he
[1:15:49] just
[1:15:50] uh jewel
[1:15:53] that i found
[1:15:55] then he just lost words there all he
[1:15:57] could say is hallelujah
[1:16:00] hallelujah
[1:16:02] i love to praise his name
[1:16:04] hallelujah
[1:16:07] hallelujah
[1:16:08] i love to praise his name
[1:16:11] good god
[1:16:18] and
[1:16:19] and this is what happens to you when you
[1:16:21] begin to realize what god is to you
[1:16:24] amen you don't have enough words and
[1:16:26] your vocabulary to explain amen what he
[1:16:29] is to you this is a real relationship
[1:16:33] amen but but i was just looking amen at
[1:16:36] a number of scriptures here that refer
[1:16:38] to god being uh our rock a man and when
[1:16:41] we're talking about that we're saying
[1:16:43] that he is he he's everything he's our
[1:16:45] provider he's a protector he's our
[1:16:48] health he's a you know way maker he's a
[1:16:51] miracle worker he's our healey he's i
[1:16:53] mean whatever you need that's what he is
[1:16:57] amen when we say he's a rock
[1:17:00] man this is something i can depend on
[1:17:02] something i can stand on i can stand
[1:17:05] with i i will never be made a shame with
[1:17:07] this rock that i have
[1:17:09] glory to god i thought about isaiah 42
[1:17:12] and 11. amen the bible says this let the
[1:17:16] wilderness and the cities thereof lift
[1:17:19] up their voice the villages that kadar
[1:17:22] doth inhabit let the inhabitants of the
[1:17:26] rock sing
[1:17:28] amen hallelujah if you are if you are
[1:17:31] abiding in the rock
[1:17:34] come on somebody amen you abide with the
[1:17:37] rock
[1:17:38] then it ought to give you a song in your
[1:17:39] heart
[1:17:40] amen let the inhabitants of the rock
[1:17:43] sing
[1:17:44] let them shout from the top of the
[1:17:47] mountains
[1:17:48] glory to god i thought about first
[1:17:50] samuel two and two amen it says this in
[1:17:53] scripture there is none holy as the lord
[1:17:57] for there is none beside thee
[1:18:00] neither is there any rock
[1:18:03] like our god
[1:18:04] bless it be his holy name
[1:18:07] amen
[1:18:08] psalm 78 and 35
[1:18:11] amen that says this and they remembered
[1:18:15] amen that god was their rock
[1:18:20] and the high god their redeemer
[1:18:24] you're going to find this reference to
[1:18:26] rock all over the scripture amen daniel
[1:18:29] 2 and 45
[1:18:31] it says this for as much as thou sawist
[1:18:35] that the stone was cut out of the
[1:18:37] mountain without hands and that it
[1:18:40] breaking pieces the iron the brass the
[1:18:43] clay the silver and the gold the great
[1:18:46] god have made known to the king what
[1:18:49] should come to pass hereafter and the
[1:18:51] dream is certain and interpret
[1:18:53] interpretation thereof sure when daniel
[1:18:56] saw him amen in this particular
[1:18:59] vision this interpretation of a dream uh
[1:19:02] he saw christ as a rock being cut out of
[1:19:05] the mountain and destroying every other
[1:19:08] kingdom that have been lifted up i don't
[1:19:10] care how great the kingdom is that
[1:19:12] kingdom will be destroyed because the
[1:19:14] rock
[1:19:15] christ jesus will destroy it
[1:19:18] i want to read a little quote here amen
[1:19:20] from what is the holy ghost given for
[1:19:22] uh the prophet makes a statement here
[1:19:24] referring to daniel 2 45 it says there
[1:19:27] is only one way to find it there was a
[1:19:30] stone cut out of the mountain without
[1:19:33] hands that rolled into the world and
[1:19:35] smashed it out and become like wheat or
[1:19:39] chaff on the threshing floor let that
[1:19:41] stone the christ jesus the stumbling
[1:19:44] stone to the world a stone of an offense
[1:19:48] a laughing stone a stumbling block to
[1:19:51] the church a but a precious and
[1:19:54] loadstone to the believer amen he says a
[1:19:58] stone of assurance this is my rock it's
[1:20:00] a rock of assurance and then a stone
[1:20:03] of rest
[1:20:05] hey when i'm inside the rock i ain't got
[1:20:06] to worry about nothing i can rest in
[1:20:08] there and there it says i know that i
[1:20:10] pass from death unto life my soul is at
[1:20:14] rest it says oh come unto me all ye that
[1:20:17] labor and heavy laden and i will give
[1:20:19] you rest to your soul a sign that's to
[1:20:23] be evil spoken of said the prophet to
[1:20:25] mary it'll be a sign uh it sure will but
[1:20:28] it will be an assurance it'll be love
[1:20:31] it'll be satisfaction it'll be something
[1:20:34] that you know you pass from death unto
[1:20:36] life this rock that daniel saw is a rock
[1:20:39] of satisfaction amen this rock that
[1:20:42] daniel serves a rock of assurance amen
[1:20:44] it's a rock amen that we can rest in
[1:20:48] blessed be the name of the lord amen i'm
[1:20:51] i'm stopping there but the other thing i
[1:20:53] thought here amen and while i was over
[1:20:56] there in
[1:20:58] london uh after i preached the sermon
[1:21:00] the rock is not like our rock uh i got a
[1:21:02] text from brother steven uh thunderberg
[1:21:05] my nephew uh it says uh brother jack i
[1:21:08] had a revelation amen as you was
[1:21:10] preaching on on on that i said okay and
[1:21:13] he uh he said i just got to start
[1:21:15] thinking about david and how uh how
[1:21:17] david picked up rocks and he needed five
[1:21:20] rocks amen which represented f-a-i-t-h
[1:21:24] and amen and also he needed grace
[1:21:27] g-r-a-c-e
[1:21:29] hallelujah in in in j-e-s-u-s
[1:21:33] hallelujah amen i said yes sir you know
[1:21:36] stepped into the second part of my
[1:21:38] sermon already
[1:21:40] amen because david had to pick up a rock
[1:21:44] come on somebody this was not no
[1:21:46] ordinary rock that he used to slay
[1:21:48] goliath the reason we know it's not an
[1:21:51] ordinary rock is because the prophet
[1:21:52] told us that when david slung this rock
[1:21:55] toward goliath the rock moved at a
[1:21:57] thousand miles per hour there is no man
[1:22:02] strong enough to throw a rock
[1:22:04] a thousand miles per hour all i can tell
[1:22:07] you is that this rock
[1:22:09] a predestinated rock
[1:22:11] this rock was not like the rocks in
[1:22:14] philistine and then this rock was
[1:22:16] different from any other rock and all
[1:22:19] david had to do was pick up the rock
[1:22:22] throw the rock in the sling and just uh
[1:22:24] he gonna just close his eyes and let it
[1:22:27] go
[1:22:28] but the rock was gonna hit the target
[1:22:30] and even this morning if you sit this

[1:26:44] with their mouth but they curse inwardly
[1:26:47] salah
[1:26:49] my soul
[1:26:51] wait thou only upon god
[1:26:54] for my expectation is from him it's from

[1:26:58] he
[1:26:59] only
[1:27:00] i told you when david writes things like
[1:27:02] this remember how he was hiding in the
[1:27:04] cave
[1:27:05] amen he thought that was his protection
[1:27:08] but in the very cave that he was hiding
[1:27:10] god brought his enemy right into the
[1:27:12] same cave

[1:29:34] scripture reading
[1:29:36] amen there in psalms it kept saying
[1:29:39] god is my rock
[1:29:42] he says do you know what a rock
[1:29:44] represents in the bible
[1:29:46] a rock in the bible here
[1:29:48] represents the revelation of god so when
[1:29:52] you say god is my rock he's my
[1:29:53] revelation and i'm going to tell you
[1:29:55] when you have a revelation with god you
[1:29:56] can you can be at peace
[1:29:59] oh

[1:30:02] peace when you have a revelation amen he
[1:30:04] said he says uh god is about see god is
[1:30:07] my revelation he is see the revelation
[1:30:10] of the word
[1:30:11] is the rock
[1:30:13] oh my the revelation of the word is the
[1:30:17] rock amen so many people that we can go
[1:30:20] back at and look in scripture they held
[1:30:22] they held on to one revelation and that
[1:30:24] was their rock
[1:30:25] he says because peter one day jesus had
[1:30:28] asked the question who does men say that
[1:30:31] i the son of man am and one of them said
[1:30:34] some of them said you are moses or
[1:30:36] elijah jeremiah one of the prophets but
[1:30:38] that wasn't the question who do you
[1:30:42] say
[1:30:43] i am

[1:30:47] said thou art the christ the son of the
[1:30:50] living god it says blessed art thou

[1:35:09] and put a little honey
[1:35:12] on top of the limestone amenity glaze is
[1:35:15] the stone with honey

[1:39:29] keeps writing about this rock it says
[1:39:32] how should one chase a thousand and two
[1:39:34] put ten thousand to flight
[1:39:36] except their rock had sold them
[1:39:39] and and the lord had shut them up now
[1:39:41] when we're talking about this rock and
[1:39:43] god being a rock we're actually saying
[1:39:46] the rock is christ
[1:39:48] the rock is christ
[1:39:51] amen this is this is a spiritual term
[1:39:53] that we're using uh but when we say that

[1:40:19] that we get
[1:40:21] but yeah he still blesses us anyway

[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:55] this is why this is why uh moses writes
[1:40:57] his word says it says how should one
[1:40:59] chase a thousand the two put ten
[1:41:01] thousand to flight except that rock had
[1:41:03] sold them and the lord had shut them up
[1:41:07] for their rock is not as our rock even
[1:41:10] our enemies themselves being judges
[1:41:14] i love this i love this i want to want
[1:41:16] to just camp out just a little bit more
[1:41:18] right in here when we read them verse 30
[1:41:20] where it says their rock had sold them
[1:41:22] oh the language is so uh challenging but
[1:41:26] when i looked at it in the uh hebrew
[1:41:28] lexicon it said to sell oneself or to
[1:41:32] give over to death
[1:41:34] so in order and when it said their rock
[1:41:36] had sold them it meant we needed a rock
[1:41:40] that would give us life for us
[1:41:43] and we got a rock that not only gave us
[1:41:47] life for us but a rock that rose on the
[1:41:50] third day
[1:41:50] [Applause]
[1:41:51] [Music]
[1:41:52] and this is why i say even inside the
[1:41:54] tomb our rock was laying beneath a
[1:41:59] our rock was laying behind a rock
[1:42:02] and they were trying to make their rock
[1:42:05] as sure as they could
[1:42:07] the prophet said 100 men
[1:42:10] were guarding the rock
[1:42:12] but brother when god sent a supernatural
[1:42:15] earthquake
[1:42:16] not even 100 men could guard the rock
[1:42:19] the bible say they all fell as if they
[1:42:22] were dead
[1:42:23] and the angels sat on top of the rock i
[1:42:26] love this because when when when the
[1:42:28] angels sit on top of the rock there were
[1:42:30] two rocks that moved
[1:42:36] hey the natural rock moved but the
[1:42:39] spiritual rock that was laying behind
[1:42:41] the rock also moved
[1:42:43] hey and i'm here to tell you dale rock
[1:42:46] is not like caloras
[1:42:48] [Applause]
[1:42:51] if he moved on resurrection sunday then
[1:42:54] he is still moving today
[1:42:57] [Applause]
[1:43:01] hey hallelujah
[1:43:03] you know even
[1:43:04] you know the reason why we christians go
[1:43:06] to church on sunday
[1:43:09] so you you know when you run into people
[1:43:10] that talk about you know you're going to
[1:43:12] church on the wrong day
[1:43:14] you should be going on saturday because
[1:43:15] saturday's the sabbath and you know you
[1:43:17] know we get all of that the reason we go
[1:43:19] to church on sunday is because we're
[1:43:21] honoring the resurrection according to
[1:43:24] the scripture jesus rose on the day
[1:43:26] after the sabbath
[1:43:28] now here's the other thing i want to
[1:43:30] tell you is that i'm not limited to just
[1:43:33] going to church on sunday
[1:43:38] hey
[1:43:39] i can praise them
[1:43:41] seven days a week
[1:43:43] 24 hours a day
[1:43:46] so i praise them on saturday i pray them
[1:43:49] on sunday i praise my mother
[1:43:51] hey i will praise him
[1:43:53] [Applause]
[1:43:56] glory to god so don't get caught up in
[1:43:58] conversations like that what day we go
[1:44:00] actually the day is it's actually it's
[1:44:02] not even a day anymore it's a person the
[1:44:05] sabbath is a person
[1:44:06] and unless you have this rock
[1:44:09] you can't even have a sabbath
[1:44:13] you can't have rest until you have the
[1:44:15] rock
[1:44:17] hey glory to god
[1:44:19] all right let's pick up exodus 17 again
[1:44:21] and let me just move on
[1:44:23] uh and here exit 17 verse three through
[1:44:26] seven
[1:44:27] um
[1:44:28] here we find this rock
[1:44:32] uh in um moses and children of israel's
[1:44:35] they're saying the people thirsted there
[1:44:36] for water
[1:44:38] and the people murmured against moses
[1:44:40] and said wherefore is this that thou has
[1:44:42] brought us up out of egypt to kill us
[1:44:44] and our children and our cattle with
[1:44:46] thirsts and moses cried unto the lord
[1:44:50] saying what shall i do unto this people
[1:44:52] they'd be almost ready to stone me and
[1:44:54] the lord said unto moses go on before
[1:44:56] the people and take with thee of the
[1:44:57] elders of israel and the rock wherewith
[1:45:00] thou smote the river take taken thy hand
[1:45:03] and go
[1:45:04] and look at this behold i will stand
[1:45:06] before thee
[1:45:08] there upon
[1:45:09] the rock
[1:45:11] and horeb and thou shalt smite the rock
[1:45:14] amen and there shall come water out of
[1:45:17] it that the people may drink and moses
[1:45:19] did so in the sight of the elders of
[1:45:22] israel and he called the name of the
[1:45:25] place masa and maribel because of the
[1:45:28] children of the childing of the children
[1:45:30] of israel and because they tempted the
[1:45:32] lord saying is the lord among us
[1:45:36] or not
[1:45:38] here they got this question because they
[1:45:40] got a little thirsty
[1:45:41] but the way god desired the uh uh um the
[1:45:45] way god had in his mind to to fulfill
[1:45:48] their their their thirst is to have
[1:45:50] moses strike a rock
[1:45:54] now how many y'all ever went to a rock
[1:45:57] and got water
[1:46:00] but this is the way god does that he
[1:46:02] does does things that blows your mind
[1:46:04] moses i'm gonna be standing
[1:46:07] on the rock and i want you to take your
[1:46:09] rod and strike the rock and watch what
[1:46:12] happened to the rock
[1:46:14] now i need you to i want to i want to
[1:46:16] just kind of bring something in here for
[1:46:18] you if i can
[1:46:20] uh
[1:46:21] let me see here
[1:46:23] yes
[1:46:24] go to corinthians book of correction
[1:46:28] this is a a quote corinthians book of
[1:46:30] correction when i preached this last
[1:46:32] week man the brothers were just
[1:46:34] rejoicing and just just just coming and
[1:46:36] giving me all kind of quotes after this
[1:46:39] i said okay that'll be part two then so
[1:46:42] i figured i would bring it to you i want
[1:46:43] you to get in your mind what kind of
[1:46:46] rock
[1:46:47] what kind of rock
[1:46:49] could uh moses just walk up to and hit
[1:46:52] with a rod and water come out
[1:46:57] water come out and not only a man uh
[1:47:01] satisfy the people but all the animals
[1:47:06] how big is this rock
[1:47:10] how great is this rock
[1:47:13] well i'ma already let you know i'm gonna
[1:47:15] already let you know when you're talking
[1:47:17] about god
[1:47:20] little as much
[1:47:26] little is much
[1:47:28] when god is in it
[1:47:30] two million people drink from a rock
[1:47:35] now look at this the the good thing
[1:47:37] about this is that we don't have to let
[1:47:39] our imagination wander
[1:47:41] we got a prophet
[1:47:43] we can go back to
[1:47:45] that can tell us what it was
[1:47:47] amen
[1:47:49] do you realize in order for you to
[1:47:51] believe
[1:47:52] genesis
[1:47:54] you got to believe a prophet
[1:47:58] amen
[1:47:59] what what prophet do you believe in the
[1:48:01] prophet
[1:48:02] moses and moses was not in the garden
[1:48:09] moses came years later
[1:48:13] moses was not there with abraham how
[1:48:15] could he tell us what happened on
[1:48:18] [Music]
[1:48:26] amen
[1:48:27] my god i mean how do we know what
[1:48:29] happened in the garden of eden through
[1:48:30] moses what he wasn't there
[1:48:33] how do you know what the serpent said
[1:48:35] [Music]
[1:48:39] praise the lord i mean think about it we
[1:48:41] we just pick it up and read it now but
[1:48:43] it takes belief in a prophet
[1:48:48] that's the importance of having a
[1:48:49] prophet
[1:48:50] because the prophet actually goes into
[1:48:52] the mind of god
[1:48:54] by vision and he sees things and he's
[1:48:57] able to give it out to you
[1:49:00] if you didn't have that you wouldn't
[1:49:01] understand the scripture
[1:49:05] amen
[1:49:06] that that's why we stand on this rock of
[1:49:08] revelation
[1:49:10] this is why we stand here
[1:49:12] glory to god without a prophet i
[1:49:14] wouldn't even be able to preach what i'm
[1:49:15] preaching right now
[1:49:17] not with the revelation that i have
[1:49:19] amen
[1:49:21] you know the the thing that that i
[1:49:23] forgot to tell you about this rock that
[1:49:25] rock when we read it there in um in uh
[1:49:28] in exodus
[1:49:30] it wasn't a one-time occasion
[1:49:33] they didn't just get rocked after one
[1:49:35] complaint
[1:49:36] god actually allowed to rock to follow
[1:49:39] them
[1:49:40] hey the bible actually said it paul
[1:49:43] picked it up and said it where did paul
[1:49:45] get that from
[1:49:46] paul said the rock was christ in the
[1:49:48] rock follow them
[1:49:51] so every time they got thirsty
[1:49:54] [Applause]
[1:49:59] [Music]
[1:50:00] [Applause]
[1:50:06] [Applause]
[1:50:07] [Music]
[1:50:09] [Applause]
[1:50:09] [Music]
[1:50:11] [Applause]
[1:50:12] [Music]
[1:50:14] [Applause]
[1:50:23] amen the rock is always with you
[1:50:25] he promised never to leave him or
[1:50:27] forsake you
[1:50:28] [Applause]
[1:50:32] this is not a one-time thing this is
[1:50:35] every day when we need we have
[1:50:39] yo yo your camera thirsty
[1:50:46] anything you need it
[1:50:48] the horse thirsty
[1:50:50] right there your child right here
[1:50:53] and they like going back to america up
[1:50:55] the rock follow them
[1:51:02] but what kind of rock is this
[1:51:06] and thank god for a prophet that that
[1:51:08] tells us that you know
[1:51:09] first corinthians 10 4
[1:51:12] just pull that up real quick before i go
[1:51:13] to the scripture i'm just telling you
[1:51:14] what the bible say first corinthians 10
[1:51:16] 4 and the prophet brought these two
[1:51:18] thoughts together how many times i
[1:51:20] haven't read first corinthians 10. i've
[1:51:22] been reading my bible
[1:51:23] these one-year bible reading plans for
[1:51:25] over 20 years

[1:51:30] and and did all drink the same spiritual
[1:51:32] drink for they drank of that spiritual
[1:51:35] rock

[1:51:40] and that rock was christ

[1:52:23] you can ask paul and silas
[1:52:25] because the rock was with them in jail
[1:52:28] and the rock will loose the pawns
[1:52:31] praise god the rock will open up sails
[1:52:35] the rock will set you free
[1:52:36] [Applause]

[1:53:25] sermon on last week he said brother jack
[1:53:26] i just want to share this quote with you

[1:53:31] was this rock
[1:53:34] a prophet is going to give us a
[1:53:35] description
[1:53:37] and all we got to do is follow this now
[1:53:38] look at this and corinthians book of
[1:53:40] corrections says how this rock laying
[1:53:42] there
[1:53:44] god
[1:53:45] had a rock
[1:53:47] that had a stored full of water
[1:53:51] just
[1:53:52] a little rock
[1:53:55] perhaps not no bigger than that desk
[1:54:00] i start looking for this
[1:54:06] i mean sister charisse is back there
[1:54:07] behind the desks
[1:54:09] the brothers are back there behind a
[1:54:10] desk
[1:54:11] two million people
[1:54:13] and their animals
[1:54:15] are fed from a rock that's no bigger
[1:54:18] than a desk
[1:54:25] it don't take god a lot
[1:54:28] just a little rocks perhaps no bigger
[1:54:30] than that desk
[1:54:32] but when moses smote this rock there was
[1:54:36] enough water came from it to water two
[1:54:38] million people and not only that
[1:54:41] but as many cattle and sheep and things
[1:54:44] as they had with them
[1:54:47] oh
[1:54:48] when i see some of these artists
[1:54:51] who paint pictures of a little drop
[1:54:53] falling out of a rock
[1:54:55] and a kid standing there with a little
[1:54:57] bucket in his hand

[1:56:42] bountiful gushers
[1:56:44] a rock as big as a desk
[1:56:47] bountiful gushers
[1:56:49] what source is this
[1:56:56] it watered over 2 million people besides
[1:56:58] their camels and all the animals the
[1:57:00] rock that rock was christ jesus
[1:57:03] a beautiful paranoid of john 3 16
[1:57:06] god so loved the world that he gave his
[1:57:08] only begotten son that whosoever
[1:57:10] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:57:12] have eternal life
[1:57:14] he says and notice what happened
[1:57:16] the only way that they could get that
[1:57:18] water out of the rock
[1:57:20] the judgment rod had to strike the rock
[1:57:23] and moses smote the rock
[1:57:26] and god's judgment struck upon the rock
[1:57:29] and when it did it gave forth its waters
[1:57:34] see your rock had to be sold they had to
[1:57:36] be willing to die for you
[1:57:38] amen it gave forth its waters the people
[1:57:40] were absolutely god was just just in
[1:57:43] letting god was just in letting them die
[1:57:47] because they had disbelieved him
[1:57:49] they had dishonorable they were
[1:57:51] reprobates i told you some of us don't
[1:57:53] don't don't don't deserve the blessings
[1:57:56] that we do receive
[1:57:58] if god did not bless you he's just doing
[1:58:01] it
[1:58:03] it's just
[1:58:05] amen he says um they they had been
[1:58:07] dishonorable they were refer based they
[1:58:09] did not deserve to live
[1:58:11] moses called them rebels rebellious
[1:58:13] against god
[1:58:14] and they deserve to die
[1:58:17] and all of us deserve death because
[1:58:19] we're rebellion against god correct
[1:58:22] we all deserving deserve dying but god
[1:58:24] is so merciful
[1:58:26] he shouldn't never thought of us
[1:58:28] but he's so merciful till he took the
[1:58:31] sins of every one of us
[1:58:33] and struck upon his own beloved son
[1:58:36] christ that we might not perish but but
[1:58:38] would have
[1:58:39] eternal
[1:58:41] life
[1:58:42] oh how i thank god for that
[1:58:44] now let me just slip over to a little
[1:58:46] something here because the rock the rock
[1:58:48] moves

[1:58:53] wilderness
[1:58:55] uh the rock
[1:58:57] was found in a tomb
[1:58:59] and it moved out of the tomb

[1:59:46] he said this in the message the
[1:59:48] unveiling of god
[1:59:50] oh
[1:59:51] think about the title
[1:59:53] the unveiling of god
[1:59:55] and it says this moses one time desired
[1:59:58] to see god
[2:00:00] and god had told him to stand
[2:00:03] on the rock
[2:00:04] he says and on the rock moses stood
[2:00:07] and he seen god passed by and his back
[2:00:11] looked like the back of a man
[2:00:13] god
[2:00:15] was in a whirlwind
[2:00:17] and moses standing on the rock look at
[2:00:19] this he says i guess

[2:01:34] let's go to 2nd kings chapter three and
[2:01:35] i'm gonna try to wind up right here
[2:01:39] i'm gonna try to wind up right here
[2:01:42] hey i thank god for this
[2:01:48] after i read second kings three my uh um
[2:01:52] the next quote gonna be making the
[2:01:53] valley full of ditches but second kings
[2:01:56] chapter
[2:01:57] three let's look at let's look at this
[2:02:00] amen starting at verse one
[2:02:02] um this is a supernatural rock their
[2:02:05] rock is not like our rock
[2:02:08] amen
[2:02:10] uh
[2:02:10] okay
[2:02:12] praise the lord second kings chapter
[2:02:14] three verse one it says this
[2:02:17] it says now
[2:02:18] jehoram
[2:02:19] the son of ahab
[2:02:22] began to reign over israel in samaria
[2:02:25] the 18th year of jehoshaphat
[2:02:28] king of judah and reigned 12 years so
[2:02:31] now let's just get these characters in
[2:02:33] our mind as we're going through so jay
[2:02:35] haram is the son of ahab who was the
[2:02:37] most wicked king
[2:02:39] that israel ever had
[2:02:41] uh and he's the son being raised up in a
[2:02:43] household like that it affected him
[2:02:46] right and uh so here joram his mother uh
[2:02:49] uh well it doesn't necessarily but we
[2:02:51] know his father's ahab
[2:02:52] jram the son of ahab began to reign over
[2:02:54] israel and samaria the 18th year of
[2:02:56] jehoshaphat king of judah so
[2:02:58] at this time the kingdom of israel and
[2:03:00] the kingdom of judah they're divided now
[2:03:02] they're the same people but they're
[2:03:03] divided
[2:03:04] amen um so here here here we see king of
[2:03:08] the king of judah which is jehoshaphat
[2:03:10] king of israel going to be jehoram okay
[2:03:12] uh joseph king of judah and reigned 12
[2:03:15] years
[2:03:16] and he wrought evil
[2:03:17] in the sight of the lord
[2:03:19] but not like his father
[2:03:21] and like his mother for he put away the
[2:03:23] image of baal that his father had made
[2:03:27] nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of
[2:03:30] jeroboam the son of nabat which made
[2:03:33] israel to sin and depart and he departed
[2:03:36] not there from
[2:03:38] and misha
[2:03:40] king of moab was a sheep master
[2:03:43] and rendered them to the king of israel
[2:03:44] and hundred thousand lambs and a hundred
[2:03:47] thousand rams
[2:03:48] with the wool
[2:03:50] and it came to pass when ahab was dead
[2:03:53] that the king of moab
[2:03:54] rebelled against the king of israel i'm
[2:03:57] not giving you no more uh i'm stopping
[2:03:59] right here you know so uh
[2:04:02] here the scripture says and king jehoram
[2:04:05] went out of samaria the same time and
[2:04:08] numbered all israel so he's getting
[2:04:10] ready to get his army established uh
[2:04:12] he's this guy's rebelled against him
[2:04:14] he's not paying uh what he used to pay
[2:04:17] to his father and he's like look i'm
[2:04:19] going to get what belonged to me right
[2:04:21] this is what jram is going to do so um
[2:04:25] verse 7 says and he went and sent to
[2:04:27] jehoshaphat now he didn't want to go by
[2:04:29] himself so he's going to the king of
[2:04:31] judah jehoshaphat he needs some help in
[2:04:33] the battle right he says he went and
[2:04:36] sent to jehoshaphat the king of judah
[2:04:38] saying the kingdom moab hath rebelled
[2:04:40] against me
[2:04:42] wilt thou go with me against moab to
[2:04:45] battle and he said i will go up i am as
[2:04:49] thou art my people as our people and my
[2:04:52] horses as our horses and he said which
[2:04:55] way
[2:04:56] shall we go up and he answered the way
[2:04:59] through the wilderness of edom
[2:05:02] he's just happy to have jehoshaphat
[2:05:04] going with them amen and he says we're
[2:05:06] going to go through the way the
[2:05:07] wilderness of edom now i'm before i get
[2:05:10] there i just want to let you know as
[2:05:12] they're going the way through the
[2:05:13] wilderness edom this was really not a
[2:05:15] good route to go
[2:05:17] this was a route that would actually
[2:05:18] bring death to them
[2:05:20] hey
[2:05:21] you got to know where you're going
[2:05:25] this was a route that was actually going
[2:05:26] to bring death to the men
[2:05:29] right amen they just so happy that we
[2:05:31] got them going so so so here he says uh
[2:05:33] uh um verse 9 says so the king of israel
[2:05:37] went and and the king of judah so
[2:05:39] jehoram and jehoshaphat and the king of
[2:05:42] jews and the king of edom they got a
[2:05:44] third king to go with him and they
[2:05:45] fetched a compass of seven days journey
[2:05:48] and there was no water for the host and
[2:05:51] for the cattle that followed them
[2:05:52] imagine
[2:05:54] going without water for seven days
[2:05:58] this was a death trap
[2:06:02] look at this so and the king of israel
[2:06:05] said alas
[2:06:06] that the lord have called these three
[2:06:08] kings together to deliver them into the
[2:06:11] hand of moab
[2:06:13] but but jehoshaphat jehoshaphat said
[2:06:16] is there not here a prophet
[2:06:19] i love the way this man thinks
[2:06:23] jehoshaphat even now he's on a seven-day
[2:06:26] journey with this king
[2:06:27] amen ain't got no water for him nor
[2:06:30] servants and you know and so so finally
[2:06:32] remembers he thinks about something he
[2:06:34] had to go back to is there not here a
[2:06:36] prophet look we don't need to try to
[2:06:39] lead ourselves
[2:06:42] and we don't have to lead ourselves
[2:06:45] if we would subject ourselves to a
[2:06:48] prophet
[2:06:50] look at this jehoshaphat said is there
[2:06:52] not here a prophet of the lord
[2:06:55] that we may inquire of the lord by him
[2:07:00] and one of the kings of israel's
[2:07:01] servant's essence said here is elisha
[2:07:04] and elisha represent the bride
[2:07:07] here's elisha the son of shafat which
[2:07:09] poured water on the hands of elijah
[2:07:12] and jehoshaphat said the word of the
[2:07:15] lord is with him
[2:07:18] amen so the king of israel and
[2:07:20] jehoshaphat and the king of edom went
[2:07:22] down to him now jehoshaphat is the one
[2:07:25] looking for
[2:07:26] and elisha said unto the king of israel
[2:07:30] uh and elijah said unto the king of
[2:07:31] israel now he's talking to jehoshapha i
[2:07:33] mean uh jehovah
[2:07:35] what have i to do with thee
[2:07:39] thee to the prophets of thy father
[2:07:42] because his daddy was worshiping baal
[2:07:44] amen give thee to the prophets of thy
[2:07:46] father and to the prophets of thy mother
[2:07:48] and the king of israel said to him nay
[2:07:51] for the lord have called these three
[2:07:53] kings together to deliver them into the
[2:07:55] hand of moab and elisha said
[2:07:58] as the lord of hosts liveth before whom
[2:08:01] i stand surely were it not
[2:08:05] that i regard the presence
[2:08:07] of jehoshaphat the king of judah i would
[2:08:11] not look toward thee nor see thee
[2:08:15] i had to stop there and just pause just
[2:08:17] for a second
[2:08:19] some people
[2:08:20] are blessed
[2:08:22] because you are there
[2:08:24] [Applause]
[2:08:28] your job is blessed because they have
[2:08:30] employed you
[2:08:33] [Music]
[2:08:34] [Applause]
[2:08:36] praise the lord
[2:08:38] amen if it had not been the presence of
[2:08:41] jehoshaphat jerome would have never even
[2:08:43] got a word from the prophet
[2:08:49] oh look at this
[2:08:52] hey i feel jesus in the place
[2:08:54] [Applause]
[2:08:57] elisha verse 14 elisha said as the lord
[2:08:59] of hosts liveth before whom i stand
[2:09:02] surely word not that i regard the
[2:09:03] presence of jehoshaphat the king of
[2:09:05] judah i would not look toward thee nor
[2:09:07] see thee
[2:09:09] but now bring me a minstrel
[2:09:11] give me an anointed musician
[2:09:14] with a good attitude
[2:09:16] bring me a minstrel and it came to pass
[2:09:19] when the minstrel played that the hand
[2:09:22] of the lord came upon him
[2:09:24] hey now elisha could get into the spirit
[2:09:27] and begin to prophesy
[2:09:28] and it said thus said thus saith the
[2:09:31] lord make this valley
[2:09:34] full of ditches
[2:09:36] now they have not drank water in seven
[2:09:39] days and now he telling them to start

[2:10:17] yet that valley shall be filled with
[2:10:20] water
[2:10:23] glory that ye may drink both ye and your
[2:10:26] cattle and your beasts
[2:10:29] and ye and you shall smite every city
[2:10:32] and every choice city and shall feel a
[2:10:34] fail every good tree and stop all wheels
[2:10:36] of water and and mar every good piece of
[2:10:39] land with stones now i'm gonna just stop

[2:12:17] you know someone told me not long ago
[2:12:20] said brother brandon music in the church

[2:12:25] i said it is
[2:12:27] do you think god changes in nature
[2:12:30] no
[2:12:32] i said then when the prophet got all
[2:12:33] stood up elisha was upset
[2:12:36] and jay horan i ain't got no respect for
[2:12:38] you your daddy your mama ain't got no

[2:13:02] the prophet got all stood up and said
[2:13:04] bring a minstrel and when the mystery
[2:13:06] began to play
[2:13:07] the hand of the lord came upon the
[2:13:09] prophet
[2:13:10] if music brought the power of god then
[2:13:14] what's y'all think sister nelly was
[2:13:15] feeling earlier
[2:13:17] it was the music it was the atmosphere
[2:13:20] if it broke the power of god then it's
[2:13:23] still bringing it today
[2:13:25] [Applause]
[2:13:30] when you go to what i mean don't just
[2:13:31] get to church when the preaching start
[2:13:33] get there during the song service
[2:13:36] you don't know what god will do for you
[2:13:38] he's trying to put you in an atmosphere
[2:13:41] so you can receive something from god
[2:13:46] amen the hand lord came upon the prophet
[2:13:48] and music brought the power of god then

[2:14:07] to bring the power of god
[2:14:10] it says they started to pray
[2:14:13] and elisha got in the spirit
[2:14:16] and he saw a vision

[2:14:32] any wind any rain but there'll be water
[2:14:35] that'll come from the way of the
[2:14:37] wilderness

[2:15:36] [Music]
[2:15:41] where'd that water come from
[2:15:44] from that rock
[2:15:45] that's mid-rock that was in the
[2:15:47] wilderness
[2:15:48] amen that's right it was back there
[2:15:51] somewhere
[2:15:52] [Applause]
[2:15:54] it might have been covered up
[2:15:57] but there was a smitten rock
[2:15:59] in there that moses smote
[2:16:01] coming through the wilderness
[2:16:03] [Music]
[2:16:05] can you imagine that
[2:16:07] and that smitten rock still lays you on
[2:16:09] the two to be touched tonight
[2:16:11] the waters of life
[2:16:13] can you imagine that
[2:16:15] a man that the prophet don't even want
[2:16:18] to have anything to do with
[2:16:22] he's a he's a king that the prophet
[2:16:24] don't even want to say two words to
[2:16:26] but because he's in the company
[2:16:29] of another man that had the had the uh
[2:16:31] uh uh
[2:16:32] just had in his heart in his mind he
[2:16:34] said look we've been going through for
[2:16:35] seven days i i actually which way we was
[2:16:37] going you told us which way was going
[2:16:39] and we got out here and man ain't no
[2:16:41] water out here seven days and that means
[2:16:43] if we go seven days back we still won't
[2:16:46] find water
[2:16:47] that'll be 14 days of no water we can't
[2:16:49] live like that man you got me out here
[2:16:51] in the gym wow
[2:16:53] and he's starting to now he won't you
[2:16:54] want to blame god god gonna lead us out
[2:16:56] here and now we're gonna all die this
[2:16:58] ain't god's fault
[2:17:01] some of the things you're in ain't god's
[2:17:02] fault
[2:17:04] amen
[2:17:05] you put yourself in that situation
[2:17:07] [Applause]
[2:17:09] amen but here's here's the good part
[2:17:11] about it that when jehoshaphat had
[2:17:13] enough in him to say is it a prophet
[2:17:18] i don't want to hear nobody else
[2:17:21] just tell me what the prophet said
[2:17:23] is there a prophet around here
[2:17:26] they say elisha who used to serve under
[2:17:28] elijah
[2:17:30] okay go get him the word of the lord is
[2:17:32] with him
[2:17:33] and when he come out there and got the
[2:17:34] music the plan
[2:17:36] my the anointing struck in a vision
[2:17:38] struck the prophet
[2:17:40] i believe that the prophet saw not just
[2:17:42] the water he knew where the source of
[2:17:44] water was coming from that's why he
[2:17:46] could tell them say look it ain't gonna
[2:17:48] be no rain it ain't gonna be no wind but
[2:17:50] if you would just get your ditches dug
[2:17:53] you gonna find water in the ditch
[2:17:57] and the prophet knew
[2:17:58] that the rock
[2:18:00] was sitting right there
[2:18:02] it might have been covered up
[2:18:04] but that rock was not only sitting there
[2:18:07] it was still working
[2:18:09] [Applause]
[2:18:13] i'm here to tell you something about the
[2:18:15] rock
[2:18:16] the bible says the rock is the same
[2:18:20] yesterday
[2:18:21] today and forever because the rock is
[2:18:24] christ
[2:18:28] glory to god
[2:18:31] whatever we need just go to the rock
[2:18:34] turn to the heart
[2:18:36] and when you get to the rock don't just
[2:18:38] ask for water because the rock won't
[2:18:40] take your enemies out
[2:18:42] brother in this scripture even the
[2:18:44] enemies could testify that the rock was
[2:18:47] with him even moab could testify that
[2:18:50] the rock
[2:18:53] [Applause]
[2:19:04] please come
[2:19:10] eating their enemies
[2:19:12] [Applause]
[2:19:23] praise his holy name
[2:19:25] even your enemies
[2:19:28] [Applause]
[2:19:34] that devil think he got you pinned in
[2:19:37] that you pinned down
[2:19:39] all of a sudden a rock shows up
[2:19:42] out of nowhere
[2:19:44] maybe it was just coming over
[2:19:46] but it was always there

[2:21:01] as they could
[2:21:02] but they couldn't
[2:21:04] and i'll tell you what the devil been

[2:21:35] rock
[2:21:42] [Music]
[2:21:44] [Applause]
[2:21:46] [Music]
[2:21:48] uh
[2:21:50] the message why
[2:21:53] the prophet makes the statement here
[2:21:58] when god got ready to try out his toxin
[2:22:00] did you notice he never put it in a
[2:22:02] guinea pig
[2:22:04] he put it in himself
[2:22:05] your rock got to be willing to die for
[2:22:07] you
[2:22:08] any good doctor tries out his own
[2:22:10] medicine on himself first
[2:22:13] now god took it upon himself when god
[2:22:15] was made flesh and dwelt among us in the
[2:22:17] life of christ jesus being his son
[2:22:19] and god was in christ reconciling the
[2:22:22] world to himself
[2:22:23] he took the toxin
[2:22:25] upon himself
[2:22:27] when he was baptized by john on the
[2:22:29] river of jordan john bear record seeing
[2:22:31] seeing the spirit of god like a dove
[2:22:34] coming from heaven saying this is my
[2:22:36] beloved son in whom i am well pleased
[2:22:40] it went into him
[2:22:41] the disciples in all wants him to see
[2:22:44] what he would do
[2:22:46] they watched his life to see how he
[2:22:48] would act to see what would take place
[2:22:51] we found him like there when he was
[2:22:54] under temptation
[2:22:56] the toxin hell
[2:22:58] when he was in the garden of gethsemane
[2:23:01] the toxin hell
[2:23:03] when he was spit on in his face
[2:23:05] the toxin hell
[2:23:07] when they nailed him to the cross
[2:23:10] the toxin hell
[2:23:12] it was good they found out it was good
[2:23:16] they sent they sing it would keep him
[2:23:19] when he died at the cross and they
[2:23:21] buried him in the ground
[2:23:23] on the third morning
[2:23:25] now what's going to take place
[2:23:27] there he is he's dead
[2:23:30] he's buried
[2:23:31] hid beneath the big rock
[2:23:34] where a century of men rolled it rolled
[2:23:37] uh rolled the stone over to hold him
[2:23:39] down
[2:23:40] now what's going to happen a guard stood
[2:23:42] at the door a hundred men
[2:23:45] watching him
[2:23:47] what's going to take place
[2:23:49] what's going to take place he prophesied
[2:23:51] through the word of god and said that on
[2:23:53] the third day
[2:23:55] he'd rise up again
[2:23:57] they made the guard sure now what about
[2:24:00] the toxin
[2:24:02] that easter morning about daybreak there
[2:24:05] coming angel down from heaven
[2:24:08] rolled away the stone
[2:24:10] and the toxin held in the time of death
[2:24:12] the toxin hell because it was god's word
[2:24:16] and i'm gonna tell you if you stand on
[2:24:17] the promise
[2:24:18] the toxins gonna hold again today
[2:24:21] amen god's promised that it was the
[2:24:24] toxin that he gave the bomb and gilead
[2:24:27] sure now we find out when he rose up on
[2:24:29] easter morning he appeared to many of
[2:24:31] them began to show that after the
[2:24:33] resurrection the toxin was still the
[2:24:35] same it did the same works it did before
[2:24:38] he died it's still hell
[2:24:40] there become 120 people interested in
[2:24:44] getting inoculated
[2:24:45] i wish all
[2:24:47] uh the world would become interested
[2:24:50] tonight and becoming inoculated
[2:24:52] because they see it held in the time of
[2:24:54] temptation it kept him
[2:24:57] from sinning
[2:24:59] it held him
[2:25:01] in temptation when he was riled upon
[2:25:04] he round not back it held him in death
[2:25:07] and when he died and went in the grave
[2:25:10] it held in the resurrection and come
[2:25:13] forth again i like that toxin don't you
[2:25:16] i think that's a good cure
[2:25:19] they did everything they could to make
