[27:15] man how privileged we are to be able to
[27:19] come
[27:20] to god's house tonight
[27:23] and i certainly feel
[27:26] the same way david felt when he said i
[27:28] was glad
[27:30] when they said unto me let us go into
[27:32] the house
[27:34] of the lord i believe david came to
[27:36] church with an expectation
[27:38] and uh we tonight should have come with
[27:41] that
[27:42] same expectation i believe god will meet
[27:44] us in a very special way
[27:46] amen i am
[27:50] fresh off a pretty long day
[27:53] it was kind of done a little suddenly
[27:57] i didn't get a chance to announce it to
[27:58] the church um
[28:00] a precious sister that used to timber
[28:02] the west coast church sister ermina
[28:05] um she had passed away
[28:08] and um you know actually what had
[28:10] happened is that her family
[28:13] kind of just did you know service and
[28:17] not necessarily and had everybody
[28:19] invited
[28:20] i believe the family is of a different
[28:22] faith and
[28:23] um you know so they just kind of did
[28:25] what they wanted to do but
[28:27] brother weskel just felt to hey let's
[28:29] just have a time where we come together
[28:31] and just
[28:31] honor sister mina for
[28:34] you know just the years of service um
[28:37] and she had been a part of multiple
[28:39] churches here in the area i believe
[28:42] as recent with brother wesko also with
[28:45] brother bernard down in miami also with
[28:47] uh brother um
[28:49] [Music]
[28:51] familial assembly in miami and uh
[28:54] and then before that she was a part of
[28:57] the church in sarasota so when she came
[28:59] to florida she got a chance to just be a
[29:00] part of a number of ministries and
[29:02] and and i was telling the church today i
[29:05] had an opportunity to go to the nursing
[29:07] home that she was
[29:08] in and when i went there to nursing home
[29:12] i was going to meet a particular brother
[29:14] there brother that come in from arizona
[29:16] and he was here on vacation with a
[29:19] another uh a minister from um
[29:22] germany and they were they were having
[29:26] vacation there
[29:27] in um uh fort myers
[29:30] fort myers and as they were there in
[29:32] fort myers they decided to get in their
[29:34] car on vacation drive three and a half
[29:36] hours over here to come visit our sister
[29:38] in
[29:38] the nursing home and i said you know she
[29:41] must have lived a life that touched so
[29:43] many people that a man would leave
[29:45] vacation from germany
[29:46] to drive three and a half hours to go
[29:48] visit her in the nursing home
[29:50] i said that's the life that i want to
[29:52] live that i can touch people like that
[29:54] that when i get down you know like that
[29:56] people don't mind coming to see about me
[29:58] so
[29:59] we certainly appreciate her and just
[30:00] actually continue to keep her family in
[30:02] prayer
[30:03] uh you know in in the loss but we did
[30:06] that early this morning and you know
[30:07] just had a little service just to
[30:09] remember her a man uh as a faithful
[30:13] soldier of the cross
[30:15] uh in our miss she also was a woman that
[30:17] had the opportunity a precious sister
[30:18] had the opportunity to meet god's
[30:20] prophet
[30:21] um said that she said in many meetings
[30:24] and even had the opportunity to ride in
[30:25] the car with him and even get personal
[30:27] interview with him
[30:28] at different times so the lord really
[30:30] blessed her and and i was just sharing
[30:32] some comments
[30:33] uh i was uh telling them as you know as
[30:36] far as being a soldier

[38:32] [Applause]
[38:42] this the right mic
[38:50] change hats here real quick
[39:02] hey man so i think i'll
[39:08] try to start off with a bit of my
[39:11] testimony real quick
[39:14] of how i was felt the call into the
[39:17] ministry
[39:18] it was not something i'd ever really
[39:21] considered
[39:22] surprisingly enough since my dad is a
[39:24] minister
[39:27] but uh
[39:31] uh one year at stillwater's it was
[39:35] 2016. i had done an interview and i
[39:37] wasn't too happy with it because i
[39:38] usually do interviews
[39:40] and so after camp i had watched it and i
[39:43] was just thinking about it and i was
[39:44] thinking i could have said this
[39:45] i could have said this maybe if i would
[39:47] have said this a little different it
[39:48] could have
[39:49] helped someone a different way you know
[39:51] some this was in church when i'm
[39:52] thinking this so i'm sitting in church
[39:54] praying and thinking this and
[39:56] suddenly just this thought out of the
[39:58] blue comes into my mind
[39:59] is this the call to the ministry and it
[40:01] seemed completely unrelated but it just
[40:03] kind of hit me hard there and so over
[40:05] the next few months i was praying about
[40:07] it
[40:07] and then at believer's youth camp in
[40:10] 2017
[40:12] i was still praying about this and then
[40:14] one of the services the
[40:16] minister had said something about being
[40:18] called in your life or being a
[40:20] being called to the ministry or your
[40:23] ministry and so this is heavily on my
[40:25] mind
[40:26] and then after a service one day like
[40:29] we're going to
[40:30] i think i was going to drop something
[40:32] off for a change after service into
[40:34] normal clothes and one other young
[40:37] brother who's
[40:38] also a minister was the only other
[40:40] brother in the dorm and so i walk in
[40:42] and he just out of the blue just walks
[40:44] up to me and says so your dad's a
[40:45] minister right
[40:46] i said yes he said so do you feel called
[40:49] to be the minister
[40:50] to be a minister and i'm just like uh
[40:53] i'm praying about it
[40:55] because he had nothing to prompt him i
[40:57] hadn't really talked with him before
[40:59] too much about that subject and then
[41:03] a couple days later at the same camp i'm
[41:06] thinking about it
[41:07] i walk out of service lo and behold i
[41:09] walk up on two of my friends who are
[41:10] talking about how one of them got called
[41:12] to be a minister
[41:17] and so then a few months after that just
[41:19] enough for me to kind of conveniently
[41:20] forget that all this happened
[41:23] my brother some brothers came and
[41:25] visited our church
[41:27] to i think it might have been a few
[41:30] different minister brothers and some
[41:31] that may have just been visiting and
[41:34] every now and then it'd be like oh so
[41:36] when's he going to preach you know
[41:37] talking to my dad just kind of
[41:39] since since my dad's a minister you know
[41:41] and i'm usually dressed in a suit and
[41:42] ties
[41:42] like oh when's he gonna preach you know
[41:44] just as a
[41:46] kind of a joke but then no it really
[41:48] meant something to me
[41:50] so finally after a
[41:53] sermon with brother nathan had been
[41:55] talking about being called i just was
[41:56] like okay
[41:57] i better go talk to brother nathan about
[41:59] this and then
[42:00] like three months later at watch night i
[42:02] was preaching watch night and i'm like
[42:03] this is not where i expected to be
[42:06] and now i'm here which is also not where
[42:08] i expected to be
[42:10] but we we praise the lord for it and for
[42:13] how he
[42:14] works differently in our lives
[42:18] if you have your bibles turn to me turn
[42:21] with me to
[42:22] matthew chapter 8 verse 23
[42:25] is where i'd like to begin and then i'll
[42:28] read a few scriptures here and then turn
[42:31] over to
[42:32] hebrews 4 after this
[42:45] matthew chapter 8 verse 23 says and when
[42:48] he was entered into a ship his disciples
[42:50] followed him
[42:51] and behold there rose a great tempest in
[42:53] the sea and so much that the ship was
[42:55] covered with the waves
[42:56] but he was asleep and his disciples came
[43:00] to him
[43:00] and awoke him saying lord save us we
[43:03] perish
[43:04] and he saith unto them why are ye
[43:06] fearful or ye of little faith
[43:09] then he arose and rebuked the winds in
[43:10] the sea and there was a great calm
[43:12] but the men marveled saying what manner
[43:14] of man is this that even the winds in
[43:16] the sea obey him
[43:18] and if you turn over to hebrews chapter
[43:21] 4 verse 9.
[43:38] just gonna read the i'm going to read on
[43:41] down to the end of this chapter but
[43:43] just for now so hold your place there
[43:45] but just for now i'm going to read
[43:47] on down to verse 11. verse 9 says
[43:51] they remain it therefore arrest to the
[43:52] people of god for he that has entered
[43:55] into his rest he hath also
[43:56] ceased from his own works as god did
[43:59] from his
[44:00] let us labor therefore to enter into
[44:02] that rest lest any man fall after the
[44:04] same example of unbelief
[44:08] and if we could just bow our heads now
[44:12] lord i pray that you would just honor
[44:14] the reading of your word and
[44:16] pray that you would just help me lord to
[44:18] be able to get myself out of the way
[44:20] lord and that you would be able to use
[44:21] the gift
[44:22] in my life just help the words i say to
[44:25] be a blessing to the people
[44:27] and may you just come and you said
[44:30] wherever two or three are gathered
[44:31] together there you'd be with us lord so
[44:33] we pray that you would just come and
[44:34] be amongst us tonight lord just calm my
[44:37] nerves and help me to
[44:40] he said in your word take no thought
[44:41] what you shall say lord so i pray that
[44:43] you just help me lord to get myself
[44:45] out of the way and let you take complete
[44:46] control of the service
[44:48] we ask these things in jesus name amen
[44:51] you may be seated
[44:55] we'll come back to the other half of
[44:57] hebrews chapter 4 in a minute
[44:59] but before then i have a couple quotes i
[45:02] want to read
[45:04] brother branham says in faith is the
[45:06] substance he says
[45:08] this day that we're living in it's such
[45:09] a day of unsettled peace and unsettled
[45:11] rest everywhere
[45:16] people are running to and fro speaking
[45:17] whatever they may speak most anybody can
[45:19] get a following
[45:20] no matter what they teach or think
[45:22] somebody will listen to them
[45:24] and it's a day that the prophet spoke of
[45:27] i put all these quotes together by the
[45:28] way before all the political madness
[45:30] that's been going on this past week
[45:35] it was not even in my head when i was
[45:37] putting some of these notes together
[45:39] amen in the church age book in the tire
[45:42] and church age brother branham says
[45:44] each age had its pressures for example a
[45:46] great burden of the last age
[45:48] is the predator of riches soft living
[45:51] and the nervous tensions in a complex
[45:53] age that we seem
[45:54] unfitted to live in
[45:57] so what i want to speak on tonight is a
[46:00] simple little thought but it's
[46:04] i feel important and affects
[46:07] many of us is i just want to speak on
[46:09] rest
[46:12] so when brother branham speaks about the
[46:15] pressures of this each age
[46:17] uh he says that the pressures of the
[46:19] last age the age we're in now is
[46:22] nervous tensions in a complex age which
[46:25] and so the pressure of this age isn't
[46:26] just like it was
[46:28] in previous age in some of the previous
[46:31] ages during the dark ages
[46:33] where it was just like one and done like
[46:34] someone today put a gun to your head and
[46:36] say
[46:37] curse god or i'll shoot you it's not
[46:40] that kind of pressure that happens
[46:41] occasionally in some places but not very
[46:43] often here
[46:45] more what the pressure is today is just
[46:47] a daily nagging
[46:49] just compromise a little here compromise
[46:52] a little there
[46:53] just slowly eating away at you until
[46:56] there's nothing left of you
[46:59] and at that point all we have left to do
[47:01] is just to run to god
[47:04] but the scriptures promise rest and so
[47:06] in these times even with that constant
[47:08] nagging and eating away at us we can
[47:10] rest
[47:12] so back to hebrews chapter 12
[47:16] so paul speaks of rest in the beginning
[47:19] of this chapter and then he goes on to
[47:21] say
[47:23] for the word of god is quick and
[47:25] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[47:26] sword
[47:27] in verse 12 piercing even through the
[47:31] dividing asunder of the soul and spirit
[47:33] and of the joints and marrow and is a
[47:35] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[47:37] the heart
[47:38] neither is there any creature that is
[47:39] not manifest in his sight but all things
[47:41] are naked
[47:42] and opened unto the eyes of him with
[47:44] whom we have to do
[47:47] seeing then that we have a great high
[47:48] priest that is passed into the heavens
[47:50] jesus the son of god let us hold fast
[47:52] our profession
[47:54] for we have not in high priest which
[47:55] cannot be touched but with the feeling
[47:57] of our infirmities
[47:58] but was in all points tempted like as we
[48:00] are yet without sin
[48:01] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[48:03] throne of grace that we may obtain
[48:05] mercy and find grace to help in the time
[48:07] of need
[48:09] so in this chapter uh in the
[48:12] chapter three of hebrews paul had been
[48:15] talking about the israelites and how
[48:16] that
[48:17] many of them uh were not able to enter
[48:21] into the rest because of the stiff necks
[48:22] their stiff necks and hardness of their
[48:24] heart
[48:24] only two out of the two million were
[48:28] that were supposedly following moses
[48:30] really truly entered into the promised
[48:31] land and entered into the rest because
[48:33] they were the only two that were fully
[48:35] into the word
[48:36] so he says that we have we can enter
[48:39] into the rest
[48:40] and then goes on to list all the reasons
[48:41] why we can enter into this rest
[48:43] he says we can rest because the word of
[48:45] god is quick and powerful
[48:48] he says god sees everything there's
[48:49] nothing hidden from his sight
[48:51] and we can go and ask whatever we need
[48:54] of the father
[48:55] because he has been in all points
[48:57] tempted as we are without sin so he
[48:59] there's nothing
[49:00] we may think that there's a pressure in
[49:02] our life that's great and like
[49:04] no one else has been through this like i
[49:05] have but god has been through this jesus
[49:07] came down in flesh
[49:08] so that he could be tempted in every way
[49:10] as we were
[49:14] so in in why are people so tossed about
[49:17] brother branham says i was saying
[49:20] somewhere maybe here a few nights ago
[49:22] i wanted to preach so bad i preached to
[49:24] my wife sitting in
[49:25] i sorry i preached to my wife in bed
[49:28] till 12 o'clock just telling her how
[49:29] glorious jesus was
[49:31] a text come in my heart it kept burning
[49:32] me so great till i just couldn't rest
[49:34] with it
[49:35] i just said honey i want to preach to
[49:36] you a little while and she roused up by
[49:38] grace she listened
[49:40] i said the christian faith is based
[49:42] solidly upon rest
[49:44] that's right this quote always
[49:47] kind of amuses me i think it's pretty
[49:50] funny how
[49:51] just at midnight one night brother
[49:52] branham just wakes up his wife and she
[49:54] says
[49:55] i want to preach to you and he says the
[49:56] christian faith is based solidly upon
[49:59] rest and i can always think that
[50:01] the reply running through her head is
[50:02] what do you think i'm trying to do
[50:08] but still there's still very much truth
[50:11] to what he's saying the whole christian
[50:13] experience is based on rest
[50:15] we are supposed to rest have our faith
[50:18] rest in the word
[50:21] so i've been going to i started going to
[50:23] college about a year and a half ago
[50:26] and one thing i've noticed at college is
[50:30] many nearly all the students are
[50:34] struggle so much with stress
[50:37] and none of them seem to ever have much
[50:39] peace
[50:41] we have a place to rest that many of
[50:43] them don't have
[50:48] so in the book of job we see the story
[50:51] of job
[50:53] that he was able to rest amidst all his
[50:55] trials if anyone had reason
[50:57] to be stressed out of their mind it
[50:59] should have been job
[51:02] i'm not saying he didn't care he didn't
[51:04] immediately move on with his life and
[51:05] just say okay whatever
[51:07] he was i mean it happened it was rough
[51:09] but
[51:10] at the end of the day he didn't let
[51:13] himself be controlled by those pressures
[51:15] that happened
[51:17] at the end of the day it's in job
[51:20] chapter 1 verse 20 and 21
[51:23] says then job arose and rent his mantle
[51:26] and shaved his head and fell
[51:27] down upon the ground and worshipped
[51:31] and said naked came i out of my mother's
[51:33] womb and naked shall i return thither
[51:35] the lord gave and the lord hath taken
[51:37] away blessed be the name of the lord
[51:43] to our eyes what was going on to job in
[51:46] job's life if we had thought about like
[51:48] okay if this was me if this was
[51:49] happening to me
[51:51] like i think i'd be having like a
[51:53] complete total breakdown that would be
[51:56] incredibly difficult but he had a place
[51:59] to rest
[52:00] in job 19 chapter 19 verse 25
[52:04] and 26 he says for i know that my
[52:06] redeemer liveth
[52:07] and that he shall stand at the latter
[52:08] day upon the earth and though that after
[52:11] my skin worms destroy this body
[52:13] yet in my flesh shall i see god
[52:16] he recognized that god was bigger than
[52:19] his problems
[52:20] he wasn't letting himself be controlled
[52:22] by what happened
[52:23] but he knew that god was in control
[52:25] because he knew that god was bigger than
[52:27] his problems
[52:28] if we let ourself get controlled by our
[52:29] problems what we end up saying is that
[52:31] our problems are bigger than god
[52:34] [Music]
[52:36] there was one time in brother branham's
[52:38] life he tells a story in life story
[52:41] where he nearly had a breakdown was
[52:44] after
[52:46] after the his first wife and
[52:50] sharon rose had died he went
[52:53] he had a very low spot in his life
[52:58] and he tells the story of how he tried
[53:01] multiple
[53:01] times to just end his life he couldn't
[53:04] take it anymore
[53:05] because the pressure was getting to him
[53:07] so much
[53:10] he says i said in in life story
[53:13] in 1951 he says i said oh god but in
[53:17] heaven somewhere you've got my little
[53:18] girl
[53:19] and there i was become i become almost
[53:21] frantic almost a mental collapse
[53:23] i took off my rubber glove he was
[53:26] working the
[53:28] on the power lines at this time he says
[53:30] 2300
[53:31] was running right by the side of me i
[53:33] said god i hate to be a coward but
[53:35] sherry honey i'm daddy's coming to see
[53:37] you this morning as i laid my hand down
[53:39] on that wire
[53:40] he said why it broke every bone in my
[53:42] body how i don't know unless god had
[53:44] foreign that this gift should go forth
[53:46] next thing i knew i was sitting on the
[53:47] ground perspiration running off my faith
[53:49] my face i took off my spurs put them in
[53:52] the truck
[53:53] went down and went home as i went around
[53:56] the house
[53:57] i picked up the mail went around the
[53:58] house and a few months had passed turned
[54:00] cold weather
[54:01] frost was coming up through the floor
[54:02] there i wouldn't go nowhere i said we
[54:05] didn't have very much but what we had
[54:06] we she and i had lived together with it
[54:09] it was home sweet home to me
[54:10] i don't care how it was it was her
[54:12] furniture and i wanted to stay at home
[54:15] when i was in the house first letter i
[54:16] looked at miss sharon rose branham 80
[54:18] cents
[54:19] christmas saving oh my it was all over
[54:21] again i knelt down on the floor there i
[54:24] started crying i said
[54:25] god please have mercy upon me i'll take
[54:27] my own life
[54:29] i've been a warden in the room i had a
[54:31] gun and i went in to get this gun and
[54:33] i'd put the shells in it and i pulled
[54:35] the hammer back on the gun i said lord
[54:37] i've gone wild i don't know i was out of
[54:40] my head
[54:40] i put it up beside my head like this i
[54:43] said our father who art in heaven
[54:44] hallowed be thy name squeeze the hammer
[54:47] it wouldn't fall
[54:48] i said oh lord i can't even take my own
[54:50] life i threw the gun down it shot off
[54:52] throughout the house
[54:53] went on like that i thought oh god why
[54:55] i've gone crazy i've lost my mind
[55:00] in continuation of the story in a
[55:02] different tape the impersonation of
[55:04] christianity he says
[55:05] someone said when i come out of my great
[55:07] trial that time after i had lost wife
[55:09] baby and everything
[55:10] said brother branham did you keep your
[55:12] religion during that time
[55:14] i said no sir it kept me during that
[55:16] time
[55:17] so that's what it's for i can't keep
[55:18] christ he keeps me
[55:20] it isn't whether i hang on it's whether
[55:22] he held on and it's a gift to me
[55:26] another character in the bible we see is
[55:29] esther
[55:30] esther had every reason to be stressed
[55:33] and to just
[55:34] want to just go and hide probably in her
[55:37] chambers and not come out
[55:38] and not face the world she had the
[55:41] weight of
[55:42] the death of her people on her shoulders
[55:46] the thing was even if she did go and see
[55:48] the king as
[55:49] and the king didn't hear her if he
[55:51] didn't extend his scepter that not only
[55:53] would her people die but she would die
[55:55] as well so she had all of this
[55:57] pressure on her mind
[56:04] so what did all these people do in the
[56:06] face of this pressure
[56:09] we see that what brother branham said he
[56:10] said my religion kept me
[56:12] it isn't the fact that i held on it's
[56:14] that he held on
[56:18] joe knew he had that he his redeemer
[56:20] lived
[56:22] so they had something to hold on to
[56:24] during that time
[56:29] back to the students at college they
[56:32] have
[56:33] uh at my particular college and i think
[56:36] most colleges they
[56:37] they have mental health services so they
[56:39] have included into your tuition as they
[56:41] have
[56:42] uh certified therapist you can go and
[56:45] see and talk about things if you're
[56:47] dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety
[56:50] and so they're constantly reminding us
[56:51] that we have
[56:52] these resources and you can go see them
[56:55] and so
[56:56] uh in one of my classes i was hearing
[56:59] one girl talk about
[57:01] how much she enjoyed going and seeing
[57:03] her therapist
[57:04] she was talking about how great it was
[57:06] and how uh how this person just listened
[57:09] and didn't judge and
[57:12] you know let her know that it was going
[57:14] to be okay and things like that
[57:15] and helped her work through her problems
[57:18] and i'm sitting
[57:19] here listening to her think about this
[57:21] and i'm just like
[57:22] sounds just about like my dad
[57:26] i'm like i mean i have a parent i guess
[57:29] i have this
[57:30] this kind of relationship with my
[57:31] parents so i can go and i can talk about
[57:33] things that i have
[57:34] when i have problems in my life and
[57:36] another thing when i have problems in my
[57:38] life
[57:39] there's no better mental help you can
[57:40] get than the holy spirit
[57:43] if you wake up in the morning the first
[57:45] place you should be going is your knees
[57:47] to say lord help me through this day
[57:51] and you know that if you rest in him
[57:54] then you realize there's just nothing to
[57:56] worry about because he has it all
[57:57] under control
[58:02] brother branham says in a second-handed
[58:04] robe i'm so glad that we have a shelter
[58:07] the name of the lord is a mighty tower
[58:09] the righteous run into it and are safe
[58:11] no matter how many bombs or how many
[58:12] anything else that were safe there
[58:15] so the world and the center not having
[58:16] this shelter or their safety place it's
[58:18] a shaking time
[58:20] i believe if i wasn't a christian i'd go
[58:22] crazy to thinking of what might happen
[58:23] at any time
[58:24] and with a house full of little kitties
[58:26] and everything i wouldn't know what to
[58:28] do but i'm so glad that i can stand in
[58:30] my house
[58:31] and introduce to them a shelter that no
[58:34] bomb could ever touch
[58:35] or anything else under the protecting
[58:37] wings of the lord jesus
[58:39] not by power but by my might not not
[58:42] not by power not by might but by my
[58:44] spirit saith the lord
[58:46] see that is our protection
[59:00] what it comes down to is that the lord
[59:03] is our shelter we don't have to worry
[59:06] every time we think
[59:10] like that something might happen you
[59:13] start getting paranoid and think
[59:14] especially with all the
[59:16] political craziness that's going on
[59:18] right now just like oh no what's going
[59:20] to happen
[59:20] what's going to uh like a few weeks ago
[59:23] or a few months ago and they're still
[59:24] figuring out who was winning the
[59:26] election what's going to happen who's
[59:27] going to win the election
[59:28] are there going to be more riots do we
[59:30] have to worry about more riots and
[59:32] getting
[59:33] i know there was a lot of riots uh close
[59:36] to where we live in louisville
[59:38] and so sometimes there's just like well
[59:40] we should be careful not to go over in
[59:42] this area you know
[59:44] might be a little dangerous but we
[59:45] realize that
[59:48] at the end of the day he is our shelter
[59:50] and our rest and we don't have to worry
[59:51] about it because he will provide for all
[59:53] of our needs
[59:57] first peter 5 7 says casting all your
[1:00:00] care upon him
[1:00:01] for he careth for you we can cast
[1:00:04] everything every care upon him
[1:00:08] because he will provide for all of our
[1:00:11] needs
[1:00:12] in james chapter 1 verses 2 and 3 he
[1:00:15] says
[1:00:15] my brother encountered all joy when you
[1:00:17] fall into diverse temptations
[1:00:19] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:00:21] faith worketh patience
[1:00:25] so even if we start feeling stressed and
[1:00:28] under
[1:00:28] intense pressure there's always a reason
[1:00:32] that the lord does something and allows
[1:00:34] something into our lives
[1:00:37] with job it was he wanted job to know
[1:00:40] just how strong he was
[1:00:46] going to where was it going to skip it
[1:00:50] around here i think i'm getting ahead of
[1:00:52] myself
[1:00:53] in my notes but
[1:00:59] so back to job
[1:01:02] the reason that god did what he did in
[1:01:04] job's life is because he wanted job to
[1:01:06] know
[1:01:07] just how strong he was and just how much
[1:01:09] he could do
[1:01:11] that's why he allowed that test to come
[1:01:13] into his life
[1:01:14] so many times in our lives we fear tests
[1:01:17] so many times
[1:01:20] so we have this we have this you know
[1:01:24] this way of talking about it in the
[1:01:26] christian message world we usually call
[1:01:28] it a test or a trial
[1:01:30] well why do we call it a test a test in
[1:01:33] school
[1:01:33] is supposed to challenge you to see if
[1:01:35] you really know what you say you
[1:01:37] supposedly
[1:01:38] know if you do really bad on a test
[1:01:42] it shows that you probably need to pick
[1:01:44] up the slack a little bit
[1:01:45] that maybe you've been kind of skimping
[1:01:48] out on the studying lately
[1:01:50] maybe you haven't picked up the textbook
[1:01:52] in a while
[1:01:54] maybe you need to go back through it and
[1:01:55] pick up textbook and flip through some
[1:01:57] of the chapters you haven't read in a
[1:01:59] while
[1:02:02] so this dictionary.com defines test
[1:02:06] when you think of the normal definition
[1:02:08] of test as a set of questions
[1:02:11] problems or the like used as a means of
[1:02:13] evaluating the abilities
[1:02:14] aptitudes aptitudes skills
[1:02:17] or performance of an individual or group
[1:02:20] or an examination
[1:02:22] that's the normal when we think of like
[1:02:24] a school exam or a test
[1:02:26] this other definition that it has for
[1:02:28] test is
[1:02:29] the means by which the presence quality
[1:02:32] or
[1:02:32] genuineness of anything is determined a
[1:02:35] means
[1:02:36] of trial many times this is
[1:02:39] the reason we have trials in our lives
[1:02:42] it's because the lord is testing
[1:02:45] the quality of our walk
[1:02:49] it's testing the genuineness of how
[1:02:52] genuine we are in our lives
[1:02:57] sometimes it may just be like job where
[1:02:59] god is saying hey you're stronger than
[1:03:00] you think you can do
[1:03:02] you can handle this the lord isn't going
[1:03:05] to lay anything on your life that he
[1:03:06] knows you can't handle
[1:03:08] so you can know that if it comes in your
[1:03:11] life the lord has a plan and he'll help
[1:03:12] lead you through it
[1:03:15] brother branham says in the church age
[1:03:18] book again
[1:03:18] in the smyrnian church age he says
[1:03:22] this is and this is one of my my
[1:03:24] favorite quotes
[1:03:25] he says the cloudy skies and storms of
[1:03:27] life are no signs of god's disapproval
[1:03:30] neither are bright skies and still
[1:03:32] waters signs of his love and approval
[1:03:35] his approval of us of any of us
[1:03:38] is only in the beloved his love is
[1:03:40] elective
[1:03:41] which he had for us before the
[1:03:43] foundation of the world
[1:03:44] does he love us ah yes
[1:03:47] but how shall we know we shall know
[1:03:51] because he said so and manifested
[1:03:55] what he did manifested that he did love
[1:03:58] us for he brought us to himself and gave
[1:04:00] us of his spirit
[1:04:01] placing us as sons and how
[1:04:04] shall i prove my love to him
[1:04:08] by coming to church and
[1:04:11] sitting in a pew every sunday
[1:04:14] that's not what he says by
[1:04:17] listening to more tapes this week than
[1:04:20] brother so and so
[1:04:23] no he says by believing what he said and
[1:04:27] by conducting myself with joy amidst the
[1:04:29] trials
[1:04:31] that he and his wisdom allows to come to
[1:04:33] pass
[1:04:35] [Applause]
[1:04:38] so many times when you're taking a test
[1:04:41] at school it's
[1:04:42] understandable that you'd be a little
[1:04:43] worried for the test because tests are
[1:04:45] never an easy thing
[1:04:48] and it's understandable like if you
[1:04:50] haven't studied for this test it's
[1:04:52] understandable that you're going to be
[1:04:53] nervous for this test
[1:04:55] so the best way to reduce test taking
[1:04:58] anxiety as they call it
[1:04:59] is to study and be fully prepared for
[1:05:01] this test
[1:05:02] so the bible says this study to show
[1:05:05] thyself approved before god
[1:05:06] so you should constantly be in the word
[1:05:08] and studying it so that when a test
[1:05:10] comes you are fully prepared for this
[1:05:15] brother branham says in 1953 in
[1:05:18] testimony raising dead boy
[1:05:20] he says oh i tell you the most marvelous
[1:05:23] thing that i've ever seen in my life
[1:05:25] is the greatest hours of my life is when
[1:05:27] i get up against a wall
[1:05:28] that i can't get over it under it or
[1:05:30] around it that's right
[1:05:33] and then i trust god and he opens the
[1:05:35] way and i go through the thing
[1:05:37] god takes you through it that's then
[1:05:40] when you come out on the other side it's
[1:05:42] like samson when he killed the lion
[1:05:44] when he got out on the other side when
[1:05:46] he killed the lion and he got the
[1:05:48] sweetest honey
[1:05:49] he ever eat out of that old carcass of
[1:05:50] that lion and sometimes if you overcome
[1:05:53] something by the grace of god
[1:05:55] it'll be one of the sweetest things that
[1:05:56] you ever tasted in your life
[1:05:58] isn't that right if you know spiritually
[1:06:00] what i'm speaking of
[1:06:01] sometimes when the lord brings us
[1:06:03] through a test when we're in the middle
[1:06:05] of the test
[1:06:07] we can't always see what it's going to
[1:06:08] be on the other side of the test when
[1:06:10] samsung was fighting the lion as he was
[1:06:11] talking about
[1:06:13] i don't think samson had any idea what
[1:06:15] was in store for him
[1:06:17] after he had defeated that lion but he
[1:06:20] came back through
[1:06:20] and he saw the honey in the lion and it
[1:06:22] was the sweetest
[1:06:23] honey that he has ever tasted
[1:06:27] so many times it's what it is with our
[1:06:29] trials in the midst of the trial it may
[1:06:31] look bleak it may look like
[1:06:33] we're not going to make it but god will
[1:06:35] open up the way and on the other side of
[1:06:36] the trial
[1:06:37] it will be the sweetest victory
[1:06:40] that we can ever feel in our lives so
[1:06:44] we know this we can rest because of
[1:06:47] god's love for us we can rest even
[1:06:49] during our trials
[1:06:52] we can rest in because we have the
[1:06:54] revelation of the message when the devil
[1:06:56] can try to come and dissuade us and tell
[1:06:58] us that all this isn't true
[1:07:00] or different things and different things
[1:07:02] in the bible
[1:07:03] but if we have the revelation that
[1:07:05] there's so much we just
[1:07:06] can't unsee once we have the revelation
[1:07:10] we can rest upon that revelation
[1:07:15] brother branham says in joseph meeting
[1:07:17] his brethren
[1:07:19] abraham called those things which were
[1:07:20] not as though they were
[1:07:22] because he was fully persuaded that what
[1:07:24] god had promised
[1:07:25] god was able to perform
[1:07:29] because he would have never made the
[1:07:30] promise unless he knew what was going to
[1:07:32] be
[1:07:34] see how we can rest upon his word then
[1:07:37] no matter how hard the storm blows
[1:07:38] what's contrary to it rests solemnly
[1:07:41] upon
[1:07:42] his word god said it who has seen the
[1:07:44] other side of the storm
[1:07:46] see so if you're sick just anchor your
[1:07:48] soul in the haven of rest
[1:07:50] if you're perplexed and distressed
[1:07:52] remember he said i'll be with you always
[1:07:55] even to the end of the world and he said
[1:07:58] all things work together for good to
[1:08:00] them that love the lord so just stay
[1:08:02] right there
[1:08:05] i'll read this part again that he says
[1:08:07] see how we can rest upon his word then
[1:08:09] no matter
[1:08:10] how hard the storm blows what's contrary
[1:08:11] to it rest
[1:08:13] solemnly upon the word god said it
[1:08:16] who has seen the other side of the storm
[1:08:20] we can't see the other side of the storm
[1:08:21] when we're in the middle of the storm
[1:08:23] god has already seen the other side of
[1:08:24] the storm we're bound here by time and
[1:08:26] we can't see into the future
[1:08:28] we don't know what god has in store for
[1:08:30] us but god knows the end from the
[1:08:31] beginning
[1:08:32] he's seen exactly where we're going to
[1:08:34] be after we come out of this trial
[1:08:36] and how much better we're gonna be after
[1:08:38] this and how much closer to him it could
[1:08:39] bring us
[1:08:42] brother branham says in contending for
[1:08:44] the faith
[1:08:45] that's as fair as i know for this is
[1:08:48] god's resting place for faith there's no
[1:08:50] other place that faith can divinely rest
[1:08:52] only in the word of god
[1:08:56] brother branham says in the in the
[1:08:59] previous quote
[1:09:00] he had said
[1:09:04] he said i'll be with you always even to
[1:09:06] the end of the world
[1:09:07] and he said all things work together for
[1:09:09] good to them that love the lord so just
[1:09:11] stay right there
[1:09:13] i remember one time we had uh i believe
[1:09:15] is when we were having some special
[1:09:16] meetings at our church earlier this year
[1:09:19] and one of the brothers that was
[1:09:20] preaching he came up and he was
[1:09:23] preaching from this verse all things
[1:09:24] work together for good them to them
[1:09:26] that love the lord and he said
[1:09:30] anything you can think of fits into this
[1:09:32] little three-letter word
[1:09:34] a-l-l any circumstance you may be going
[1:09:38] through
[1:09:39] any situation in your life it fits
[1:09:42] under all all things financial troubles
[1:09:46] all things
[1:09:49] spiritual oppression all things
[1:09:53] family members that are out in the world
[1:09:55] all things
[1:10:02] so when contending for the faith brother
[1:10:04] branham says there's no other place that
[1:10:06] faith can divinely rest
[1:10:08] only in the word of god true faith can't
[1:10:11] rest on a creed
[1:10:12] neither can it rest in a denomination it
[1:10:14] must rest
[1:10:15] on the word of god so we must be careful
[1:10:19] what we rest in once we know we can rest
[1:10:22] we have to be careful that we're not
[1:10:23] resting on the wrong thing
[1:10:26] it's possible that we could rest in our
[1:10:28] own in our own strength
[1:10:31] we could try to rest in our own
[1:10:32] abilities and we're not going to get
[1:10:34] very far
[1:10:36] we can even rest in our own message
[1:10:39] denominations
[1:10:40] like we can we can make our own little
[1:10:42] beliefs
[1:10:43] around the message and make our own
[1:10:45] little message creeds and try to rest in
[1:10:47] those
[1:10:48] but they're gonna fail just like
[1:10:50] anything else
[1:10:52] your faith cannot divinely rest in your
[1:10:53] pastor or just coming to church
[1:10:57] and sitting on a pew or how many tapes
[1:10:59] you listen to all those things are good
[1:11:00] and you should come to church and you
[1:11:02] should listen to tapes
[1:11:04] but your faith must rest upon the word
[1:11:06] of god you can't just rest upon the fact
[1:11:08] that you did all those things
[1:11:09] then you're just league a legalist it's
[1:11:12] not the
[1:11:13] fact that you did them that saves you
[1:11:15] there should be something inside of you
[1:11:17] that makes you do them it doesn't work
[1:11:19] the other way around
[1:11:21] so your faith must rest upon the word of
[1:11:23] god and the revelation of jesus christ
[1:11:28] brother branham says in the church age
[1:11:30] book in the patmos vision
[1:11:34] oh that people might come unto him and
[1:11:35] find that rest
[1:11:37] there's a cry in all hearts for that
[1:11:39] rest but the majority don't know the
[1:11:40] answer
[1:11:42] so they try to steal the cry by a
[1:11:43] religious process of keeping certain
[1:11:45] days
[1:11:46] or accepting denominational creeds and
[1:11:48] dogmas but failing in that
[1:11:50] many tried drinking carousing in every
[1:11:52] physical excess
[1:11:54] thinking that by worldly pleasures there
[1:11:56] can be some satisfaction
[1:11:57] but in such there is no rest
[1:12:05] they smoke and take pills to quiet their
[1:12:07] nerves
[1:12:09] but there's no rest in earthly potions
[1:12:11] they need jesus
[1:12:12] they need the heavenly remedy the rest
[1:12:14] of the spirit
[1:12:16] then most of them go to church on sunday
[1:12:18] that is good but even there they have no
[1:12:19] idea of how to approach god
[1:12:21] and how to worship him
[1:12:25] jesus said that true worship was in
[1:12:27] spirit and in truth john 4 24.
[1:12:31] but what kind of worship can you get in
[1:12:33] a church that knows so little of god it
[1:12:34] puts up a santa claus at christmas and
[1:12:36] bunnies at easter
[1:12:37] where did they get that they got it from
[1:12:39] the pagans and made it part of church
[1:12:40] doctrine
[1:12:42] when one turns to the lord but when one
[1:12:44] turns to the lord and is filled with the
[1:12:46] holy spirit
[1:12:47] he ceases from all such things he has a
[1:12:49] rest in his soul
[1:12:51] he really begins to live and love god
[1:12:53] and worship him
[1:12:55] amen i was talking to a friend recently
[1:12:58] and he was telling me about
[1:13:01] what the lord had done in his life and
[1:13:05] how that up to a certain point in his
[1:13:07] life
[1:13:09] he had just been relying on what he
[1:13:12] could do
[1:13:13] and he thought he was doing good he
[1:13:16] really
[1:13:16] like he would he would go to youth camps
[1:13:18] and he would get a feeling of the spirit
[1:13:20] and anointing of the spirit on him he'd
[1:13:22] go and he'd go back home he'd be doing
[1:13:24] great he'd
[1:13:25] he'd be delivered of whatever was
[1:13:28] troubling him at that point
[1:13:29] and he'd go back home and he'd be great
[1:13:31] for about a good three months
[1:13:34] and then it would the cycle would start
[1:13:36] over again he just kind of starts
[1:13:37] slipping again
[1:13:39] because he was resting in his own self
[1:13:44] and the fact that he thought he had done
[1:13:46] it right
[1:13:47] and he had done all the right things
[1:13:51] but it says when one turns to the lord
[1:13:54] and is filled with the holy ghost he
[1:13:56] ceases
[1:13:56] from all such things he has a rest in
[1:13:58] his soul
[1:14:00] he really begins to live and love god
[1:14:02] and worship him
[1:14:05] it's not us working but it's christ
[1:14:07] living in us
[1:14:09] it's christ in you the hope of glory
[1:14:18] so many times we can try to rest in
[1:14:20] ourselves
[1:14:21] and what we can do we can't rest in just
[1:14:24] the fact that we identify as a message
[1:14:26] believer there were two million
[1:14:28] in the wilderness who followed moses
[1:14:30] that would have
[1:14:31] in you know in today's terms they would
[1:14:33] have been message believers
[1:14:36] but only two went into the promised land
[1:14:38] because those were the only two were
[1:14:40] fully committed
[1:14:41] to that word not just the name
[1:14:44] they weren't just carrying the name but
[1:14:47] they really had something on the inside
[1:14:49] of them where they were
[1:14:49] truly following and believed every word
[1:14:52] that moses said
[1:14:59] one interesting thing i
[1:15:04] in college one of the courses that was
[1:15:05] required was an ethics class
[1:15:07] i had it was a supposed to be some sort
[1:15:10] of philosophy
[1:15:11] humanities type class and i had a choice
[1:15:13] between
[1:15:14] philosophy and ethics and i made the
[1:15:16] wrong choice and picked ethics
[1:15:19] but one of the only christian
[1:15:21] philosophers we talked about which i was
[1:15:23] just like hey christian philosopher
[1:15:24] finally someone who's not an atheist
[1:15:29] we started talking about this guy his
[1:15:31] name was kierkegaard
[1:15:32] they all had really weird names but he
[1:15:35] was so he was a christian and he
[1:15:36] was talking about because all the
[1:15:38] philosophers were talking at this point
[1:15:40] in time
[1:15:40] talking about like what it really means
[1:15:42] to be alive and what like you know they
[1:15:44] use this word authenticity
[1:15:45] just like what does it mean to be an
[1:15:46] authentic man
[1:15:48] you know so but he defined it as
[1:15:50] authenticity is conceived as
[1:15:52] relationship between oneself and god
[1:15:55] and i probably wasn't listening much in
[1:15:57] class up to this point and then teacher
[1:15:58] said this and i'm like oh
[1:15:59] hello i hear truth
[1:16:03] nothing up to this point has been truth
[1:16:07] um so but so one of the things that this
[1:16:11] this man taught one of the
[1:16:15] this thinker he said that humans go
[1:16:17] through three stages and don't worry i
[1:16:18] have all
[1:16:19] a quote for all of this after so don't
[1:16:22] get
[1:16:23] scared that i'm talking about this
[1:16:24] philosopher he said that humans go
[1:16:27] through three stages
[1:16:28] an aesthetic stage an ethical stage and
[1:16:30] a religious stage is the names that he
[1:16:33] prescribed to them so the aesthetic
[1:16:34] stage is the stage of sensuous
[1:16:36] enjoyment just living for the flesh and
[1:16:40] living for yourself and what makes me
[1:16:41] happy right now
[1:16:43] then he said that and that's that's
[1:16:44] usually how people are born that's how
[1:16:46] babies are born there in this stage
[1:16:49] then there's the ethical stage which is
[1:16:51] realizing rules and conventions
[1:16:53] and striving to follow them so then you
[1:16:55] get and he was talking about in just a
[1:16:57] purely like natural
[1:16:59] thing and he said you know okay so
[1:17:01] babies grow up and they get older and
[1:17:03] they realize
[1:17:04] okay there's general rules of society
[1:17:08] generally you don't go around biting
[1:17:10] people generally
[1:17:11] you try to get along with people you
[1:17:13] don't just go up and steal their toy
[1:17:16] you know so by the time the kids are you
[1:17:17] know eight
[1:17:19] nine they're starting to realize this
[1:17:20] type of thing
[1:17:22] and many people then just stay there but
[1:17:25] he said then there's this religious
[1:17:26] stage
[1:17:27] which was the choice of a leap of faith
[1:17:29] to leave society behind and trust in god
[1:17:33] so it was moving beyond from just
[1:17:36] realizing
[1:17:37] what is going on and trying to mimic
[1:17:39] what is around you
[1:17:40] but into truly getting in a relationship
[1:17:42] with god
[1:17:44] so many times on the spiritual side many
[1:17:47] of us
[1:17:47] stay in this ethical stage that he
[1:17:50] called it and never truly
[1:17:52] make that leap into knowing god
[1:17:56] will grow up in a message church we'll
[1:17:58] look around we'll see okay we
[1:18:00] generally do these things we generally
[1:18:02] don't do these things
[1:18:04] so that seems to be what's good so i
[1:18:06] want to be
[1:18:07] good so that's what i'm going to do and
[1:18:09] i'm not going to do the things that
[1:18:11] would be bad
[1:18:14] but that's just doing it ourselves in
[1:18:16] our flesh and that's not what we should
[1:18:18] truly be resting in
[1:18:21] brother branham says in
[1:18:25] why are people so tossed about he says
[1:18:28] now speaking this
[1:18:30] there's two different types of
[1:18:31] christianity seems strange but i'll not
[1:18:34] say two different types
[1:18:35] i'll say two different phases would be a
[1:18:36] better word to use not two types two
[1:18:39] phases the same christianity but two
[1:18:41] phases of it
[1:18:46] and one of them is an intellectual
[1:18:49] or a mental conception of what god has
[1:18:52] said in his word
[1:18:53] and of jesus christ by the way of
[1:18:55] knowledge
[1:18:56] and the other is an experimental
[1:18:58] experience that god has given the man in
[1:19:01] his heart
[1:19:02] the one is intellectually is hungering
[1:19:05] he's feasting on god
[1:19:06] but his feast doesn't hold out the other
[1:19:09] one seems to have victory all the time
[1:19:10] there's nothing bothers them they're
[1:19:12] just as solid and anchored as can be
[1:19:14] no trials no storms bother them at all
[1:19:18] but they seem to have something about
[1:19:19] them that the people who are
[1:19:21] christians and trying to live for god
[1:19:23] admire that type of christian
[1:19:25] and i've often wondered lord what is it
[1:19:28] that these people have that others crave
[1:19:30] so much
[1:19:30] for and yet seem to fail to get it
[1:19:33] and i know that's a great question in
[1:19:36] all of our hearts who have served christ
[1:19:38] and i've never seen a person yet that
[1:19:40] ever once come to him except they
[1:19:42] afterwards
[1:19:42] they life never seemed right to them
[1:19:45] anymore if they ever left christ
[1:19:47] so we see that he's talking about these
[1:19:48] two groups of people and one has had a
[1:19:50] true experience with god
[1:19:52] and can rest and the storms of life no
[1:19:54] matter what kind of things come they can
[1:19:56] rest
[1:19:57] and nothing bothers them the other group
[1:20:00] they're only intellectually in it and
[1:20:03] they haven't had that real experience
[1:20:05] yet
[1:20:06] and so when something comes on them they
[1:20:09] don't know what to do
[1:20:10] they don't they don't have they're not
[1:20:12] standing on the solid rock
[1:20:14] so they're kind of blowing about as the
[1:20:16] winds would blow and they don't know
[1:20:18] what to do
[1:20:19] they don't have anywhere to solidly rest
[1:20:22] their faith
[1:20:32] but what they need to realize is
[1:20:38] how they need to have an experience with
[1:20:39] god and part of that is
[1:20:41] outlined in romans chapter 8 verses
[1:20:44] 33-39
[1:20:49] he says who shall lay anything to the
[1:20:51] charge of god's elect
[1:20:53] is god that justifieth who is he that
[1:20:55] condemneth
[1:20:56] it is christ that died ye rather that is
[1:20:59] risen again
[1:21:00] who is even at the right hand of god who
[1:21:02] also maketh intercession for us
[1:21:04] so we see that it's not us that are
[1:21:07] doing it
[1:21:07] it's christ that died christ is the one
[1:21:09] that died for our sins we need to cast
[1:21:11] all of our cares upon him
[1:21:13] and let him do all the work
[1:21:16] he says in verse 35 who shall separate
[1:21:19] us from the love of christ
[1:21:20] shall tribulation or distress or
[1:21:22] persecution
[1:21:24] or famine or nakedness or peril or sword
[1:21:28] as it is written for thy sake we are
[1:21:30] killed all the day long
[1:21:31] we are counted as sheep for the
[1:21:33] slaughter
[1:21:35] nay in all these things we are more than
[1:21:37] conquerors through him that loved us
[1:21:40] for i am persuaded that neither life
[1:21:42] neither death
[1:21:43] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[1:21:46] nor powers nor things present
[1:21:48] nor things to come nor height
[1:21:51] nor depth nor any other creature shall
[1:21:54] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:21:56] god
[1:21:57] which is in christ jesus our lord
[1:22:01] so when you get when you're going
[1:22:02] through a trial
[1:22:04] and the lord's allowed this to come on
[1:22:06] your life and it seems really hard
[1:22:08] you can remember these verses he says
[1:22:11] that
[1:22:12] neither death nor life nor angels nor
[1:22:14] principalities nor
[1:22:15] all these things nothing can separate us
[1:22:18] from the love of god
[1:22:22] in 1950 testimony brother branham says
[1:22:26] our heavenly father who brought again
[1:22:28] jesus thy son from the dead
[1:22:30] and setting at the right hand of thy
[1:22:32] majesty tonight making intercessions for
[1:22:34] us poor unworthy creatures of the earth
[1:22:39] calling to us to come unto thee all ye
[1:22:41] that labor and heavy laden i'll give you
[1:22:43] rest
[1:22:44] rest from our worries rest from our
[1:22:46] sickness
[1:22:48] rest from our sins just give us rest he
[1:22:51] that cometh to me i will in no wise cast
[1:22:53] out
[1:22:56] in the position of the believer in
[1:22:58] christ he says amen and you stand
[1:23:01] perfected because the one who died the
[1:23:03] innocent one
[1:23:04] the powerful one the overcoming one the
[1:23:06] accepted one
[1:23:08] in his own person returned in the form
[1:23:10] of the holy ghost
[1:23:11] and brings the believer into rest
[1:23:15] he says you stand perfected because
[1:23:18] the one who died the innocent one died
[1:23:21] and returned in the power of the holy
[1:23:23] ghost
[1:23:23] to bring you rest so it doesn't matter
[1:23:26] what's wrong with you because
[1:23:30] all that matters is what he was and he
[1:23:33] died and he can now live on the inside
[1:23:35] of you
[1:23:36] so all you have to do is get yourself
[1:23:38] out of the way and let him come in and
[1:23:40] live inside of you
[1:23:41] and he will bring you rest
[1:23:44] no matter what happened no matter what
[1:23:47] your life has been
[1:23:49] no matter what your life is currently no
[1:23:51] matter your past
[1:23:52] no matter the different things you've
[1:23:54] went through the holy ghost will bring
[1:23:56] you into god's rest
[1:23:59] you can think like maybe i went too far
[1:24:01] in myself
[1:24:02] there's might not be any chance for me
[1:24:04] anymore
[1:24:05] but if there's still the smallest desire
[1:24:07] in your heart
[1:24:08] to be right with god and for god to come
[1:24:12] and that you have the desire for god to
[1:24:14] come and help you then you haven't gone
[1:24:16] too far
[1:24:17] if there's a desire to be right then you
[1:24:19] have not sent away your day of grace
[1:24:23] in remembering the lord brother branham
[1:24:26] says but oh i'd like to say something
[1:24:28] if i can forget what i was and remember
[1:24:30] what he
[1:24:31] is if i can remember jesus if i can
[1:24:34] remember him at the cross
[1:24:35] if i can remember what he done for me
[1:24:37] and i can remember the hour that he
[1:24:38] washed away my sins
[1:24:40] and give me the holy spirit to guide me
[1:24:42] that i'm lifted above
[1:24:44] everything that holds this earth i'm
[1:24:46] lifted above every earthly thing
[1:24:48] into heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:24:50] where i can fellowship with him
[1:24:53] there in his presence forgetting what i
[1:24:55] ever was
[1:24:56] forgetting all my sins and everything
[1:24:59] because they're in the sea of
[1:25:00] forgetfulness
[1:25:01] forgetting all my past forgetting
[1:25:04] everything and remember that he
[1:25:05] made me his own by his own death
[1:25:09] he took my place and i that had not not
[1:25:12] a right to go nowhere but to hell
[1:25:14] he took my place and lifted me from hell
[1:25:17] he went there for me
[1:25:18] and he lifted me up by his grace
[1:25:20] abundance until now we are sons and
[1:25:22] daughters of god
[1:25:23] and we sit in heavenly places in christ
[1:25:26] jesus
[1:25:26] ever rejoicing and remembering him who
[1:25:29] brought us safe thus far
[1:25:31] and with pulsating faith in our souls
[1:25:33] pressing
[1:25:34] us and by grace he'll take me on
[1:25:38] god has placed all your sins in the sea
[1:25:40] of forgetfulness
[1:25:41] all of our cares we can cast upon him we
[1:25:44] can rest in his love
[1:25:45] nothing of ourselves we have to worry
[1:25:48] about about
[1:25:49] what my personality is maybe my
[1:25:51] personality that this makes this
[1:25:52] particular thing really
[1:25:54] hard or i tend to air in this into this
[1:25:56] way and
[1:25:57] there's this besetting sin because of my
[1:25:59] personality all of that is in the sea of
[1:26:01] forgetfulness
[1:26:02] if you have come and repented you can
[1:26:05] cast all your cares upon him and the
[1:26:07] lord will take care of the rest
[1:26:11] and why are people so tossed about
[1:26:13] brother branham says a christian is not
[1:26:15] tossed about
[1:26:16] a christian doesn't run from place to
[1:26:18] place a christian doesn't fuss and fume
[1:26:20] and worry about things a christian rests
[1:26:23] it's all over it's all finished for the
[1:26:26] believer at calvary that's right oh
[1:26:28] sickness may come
[1:26:29] and disappointment but the christian is
[1:26:31] at rest
[1:26:32] knowing this that god is able to keep
[1:26:34] that which he
[1:26:36] has performed knowing that no matter
[1:26:38] what the thing is
[1:26:39] and how it looks there is neither
[1:26:41] sickness sorrow
[1:26:43] death there's neither starvation or
[1:26:45] anything that can separate us from the
[1:26:47] love of god that's in jesus christ
[1:26:49] we're at rest just let the old ship toss
[1:26:52] any way she wants to
[1:26:54] the anchor holds praise
[1:26:58] he says brother brahm says in divine
[1:26:59] love i tell you my brother when god can
[1:27:02] wrap you in divine love
[1:27:04] there is peace in the valley for you
[1:27:05] then there is
[1:27:11] so we realize that all we have to do
[1:27:14] is just rest in the word
[1:27:18] the lord will come and he will take all
[1:27:20] of our cares
[1:27:23] and we don't have to worry about a thing
[1:27:27] one of the last scriptures here that i
[1:27:29] want to leave you with for tonight is
[1:27:32] second corinthians 4 verses 7 through
[1:27:35] 18.
[1:27:38] he says but we have this treasure
[1:27:41] in earth and vessels that the excellency
[1:27:43] of the power may be of
[1:27:44] god and not of us
[1:27:47] we are troubled on every side yet not
[1:27:49] distressed
[1:27:51] we are perplexed but not in despair
[1:27:53] persecuted
[1:27:54] but not forsaken cast down but not
[1:27:58] destroyed
[1:28:00] always bearing about in the body the
[1:28:02] dying of the lord jesus
[1:28:04] that the life also of jesus might be
[1:28:06] made manifest in our body
[1:28:08] for we which live are always delivered
[1:28:10] unto death for jesus sake
[1:28:12] the life also of jesus might be made
[1:28:15] manifest in our mortal flesh
[1:28:17] so then death worketh in us but life in
[1:28:20] you
[1:28:21] we have the same spirit of faith
[1:28:23] according as it is written
[1:28:24] i believe
[1:28:27] and therefore have i spoken we also
[1:28:30] believe and therefore speak
[1:28:32] knowing that he which raised up the lord
[1:28:33] jesus christ shall raise up
[1:28:36] us also by jesus and shall present us
[1:28:38] with you
[1:28:39] for all things are for your sakes all
[1:28:42] things are for your sakes
[1:28:44] it's another one we can read everything
[1:28:46] into everything fits into that
[1:28:48] all things are for your sakes that the
[1:28:51] abundant grace
[1:28:53] might through the thanksgiving of many
[1:28:55] re down to the glory of god
[1:28:58] for which cause we faint not but though
[1:29:01] our outward man perish
[1:29:02] yet the inward man is renewed day by day
[1:29:07] for our light affliction which is but
[1:29:10] for a moment
[1:29:11] worketh for us a far more exceeding and
[1:29:14] eternal weight of glory
[1:29:16] while we look not at the things which
[1:29:18] are seen but the things which are not
[1:29:20] seen for the things which are seen are
[1:29:23] temporal
[1:29:24] but the things which are not seen are
[1:29:26] eternal
[1:29:30] so in this last quote i want to read
[1:29:32] here tonight
[1:29:34] is from calling jesus on the scene here
[1:29:37] brother branham says
[1:29:39] here this is him in the beginning was
[1:29:42] the word
[1:29:43] the word was god the word was with god
[1:29:46] and the word was god
[1:29:47] and the word is the same yesterday today
[1:29:50] and forever
[1:29:51] it's still just take this it's the
[1:29:53] remedy it's the medicine
[1:29:55] it's the cure for every breakdown it's
[1:29:58] the cure for every cancer
[1:30:00] it's the cure for every ailment it's the
[1:30:03] it's god manifest manifested in a word
[1:30:07] the word is god jesus said it's a seed
[1:30:10] the seed is being planted in the right
[1:30:12] kind of ground it'll grow exactly what
[1:30:14] it is
[1:30:15] and every promise will be produced we
[1:30:18] forget all about it know that he is in
[1:30:20] the ship
[1:30:21] says the disciples with jesus when jesus
[1:30:25] was in the ship
[1:30:26] and the storms came they were scared
[1:30:30] because they thought that jesus wasn't
[1:30:33] doing anything
[1:30:34] about it but what was what mattered was
[1:30:36] that he was in there
[1:30:37] in the ship with them he woke up and he
[1:30:41] said
[1:30:41] why are ye fearful
[1:30:45] because he was with them so they had no
[1:30:47] need to be fearful
[1:30:52] so let's bow our heads
[1:30:56] lord i pray that this little thought
[1:30:58] that you laid on my heart lord would
[1:31:01] be a blessing to the people lord and
[1:31:02] that they would remember lord that
[1:31:05] no matter what their troubles might be
[1:31:07] their trials that they can
[1:31:08] cast them on you and just have rest in
[1:31:12] your word lord and your holy spirit
[1:31:17] i pray that you would just be with us
[1:31:19] all tonight lord as we go our separate
[1:31:20] ways lord just
[1:31:22] bless everyone uh just
[1:31:26] bless brother jack lord and this church
[1:31:29] for
[1:31:30] allowing me to come down and give me
[1:31:32] this opportunity
[1:31:35] and then just lead us in guys in our
[1:31:37] lives lord we pray
[1:31:39] in jesus name amen
[1:31:48] [Music]
[1:31:52] bless you
[1:32:04] let's give the lord another hand of
[1:32:05] praise for
[1:32:07] [Applause]
[1:32:08] the zion um
[1:32:12] just a wonderful thought there tonight
[1:32:14] on
[1:32:15] uh rest and um
[1:32:19] and i just just appreciate the many of
[1:32:22] the things that
[1:32:24] he was stating and i'm gonna have to go
[1:32:26] back and get the three stages for the
[1:32:28] human
[1:32:30] uh joyous ethical
[1:32:33] uh where we begin to learn a set of
[1:32:35] rules and and how to abide by those
[1:32:38] rules
[1:32:39] and then this religious religious stage
[1:32:41] that requires a leap of faith
[1:32:44] and how he's taking you know just a
[1:32:48] natural thought there in school and just
[1:32:50] bringing it because
[1:32:51] even when we come into christ
[1:32:54] if we're not careful we'll learn all the
[1:32:57] rules
[1:32:58] we'll learn how to satisfy those that
[1:33:00] see us but
[1:33:02] we never really go all the way into that
[1:33:04] that place with christ that real
[1:33:06] that individual personal experience you
[1:33:09] know
[1:33:09] and we just want to make sure that we
[1:33:11] don't fall short
[1:33:12] you know of the glory of god but that
[1:33:14] was just a
[1:33:16] beautiful thought on tonight
[1:33:20] no matter what you're facing no matter
[1:33:23] what you're going through
[1:33:25] uh the christian faith is based
[1:33:29] solidly upon rest
[1:33:33] oh my blessed be the name of the lord

[1:33:40] of this song
