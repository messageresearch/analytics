[15:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. No other place I'd rather be.
[15:34] What is opening a word of prayer?
[15:36] Uh dear heavenly father,
[15:39] we just thank you so much, Lord, for
[15:41] allowing us to gather once again in your
[15:43] house. Lord, just thank you when the the
[15:46] prophet said one day the doors will be
[15:48] closed. And we're so thankful the doors
[15:50] of your house are still open today,
[15:52] Lord, that we can still worship from the
[15:54] dictates of our heart, Lord. That we
[15:56] could come and gather underneath your
[15:58] presence, Lord. And you speak to each
[15:59] one of us, Lord. We know tonight that
[16:02] you have a special word for us, Lord,
[16:03] because the Holy Ghost is here tonight,
[16:05] Lord. You promise to be here if two or
[16:07] three gather in your name, Lord. And
[16:10] father, we're so thankful, Lord, that we
[16:12] can have confidence in a God and his
[16:14] word. Lord, you're the only one, Lord.
[16:17] And we're so thankful that we could
[16:18] gather together as brother and sisters
[16:20] of like precious faith. Lord, may you
[16:22] just move me out the way, Lord. That you
[16:24] could have your preeminence. Lord, that
[16:26] you could speak to each individual.
[16:28] Lord, you have something special for
[16:29] each one. Lord, help us to be able to
[16:31] receive it, Lord, and walk in the light
[16:33] as you light the path for us. Almighty
[16:35] God, may you bless this little uh this
[16:38] little sermon you placed in my heart.
[16:39] Lord, may you hide me away, Lord, that
[16:42] you may have the glory and the honor. We
[16:44] ask all these things, the most precious,
[16:46] holy name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; So, we'll take our scripture reading in
[16:51] uh John 5 and we'll read verses 1-9 and
[16:55] then I'll have you guys be seated.
[16:58] So, say amen when you get there. Let me
[17:01] set my timer so I won't be here for
[17:03] three hours.
[17:08] All right. So, we'll go to John chapter
[17:10] 5. Say amen when you get there. So, this
[17:13] is a very familiar scripture. Um the
[17:15] prophet ministered uh on this scripture
[17:18] many times. So, we'll go with verse one.
[17:21] After this, there was a feast of the
[17:23] Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now
[17:26] there's at Jerusalem by the sheep market
[17:29] pool which is called in the Hebrew
[17:30] tongue Bethesda having five porches. In
[17:34] these lay a great multitude of impotent
[17:36] folk of blind halt and withered waiting
[17:39] for the moving of the water. For an
[17:42] angel went down at a certain season into
[17:45] the pool and troubled the water.
[17:47] Whosoever then first after the troubling
[17:49] of the water stepped in was made whole
[17:51] of the whatsoever disease he had. And a
[17:54] certain man was there which had an
[17:55] infirmity 30 and eight years. And when
[17:57] Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had
[18:00] been now a long time in that case, he
[18:02] saith unto him, "Will thou be made
[18:05] whole?" The potent man answered, "Sir, I
[18:07] have no man. When the water is troubled
[18:10] to put me into the pool, but while I am
[18:12] coming," another stepeth down before me.
[18:15] Jesus saith unto him, "Rise, and take up
[18:18] thy bed, and walk." And immediately the
[18:21] man was made whole and took up his bed
[18:23] and walked on the same day was a
[18:25] Sabbath. You may take your seats. May
[18:27] the Lord add a blessing to his word. So
[18:30] it it I love how the how the Lord works.
[18:32] So this is actually uh the sermon that I
[18:35] preached in Puerto Rico actually. So and
[18:37] it's funny. I I didn't realize you guys
[18:38] were coming this week. So it's just
[18:40] funny how how God just does things. And
[18:42] the title of it is um and the title too
[18:45] is very fitting as well. Um me one
[18:48] second. The title is uh even now you are
[18:51] troubling the waters. So that that was a
[18:53] message that God gave me last year when
[18:56] I went to I went to Puerto Rico and I
[18:58] told you guys I was really nervous
[18:59] because I didn't think I was going to
[19:01] have to minister in Puerto Rico. I
[19:02] thought I got it. I was like I didn't
[19:03] have to do it. But Aquake was like
[19:05] better be ready. And so I'm just like
[19:07] just so nervous and and and God gave me
[19:10] this um this title and I didn't even
[19:12] start it. And Jose remember is out there
[19:15] at the airport and I was I was I was
[19:17] just so nervous. I was I was so nervous
[19:19] and I I thought I was going to faint.
[19:21] I've never been that more nervous in my
[19:23] life. And even when um they picked us to
[19:25] the airport, I got even more nervous.
[19:27] And I'm I'm waiting in the back waiting
[19:29] to get up to minister, I'm even more
[19:31] nervous. And then as soon as I get up
[19:33] there, God just takes all the
[19:35] nervousness away. And I don't even
[19:36] remember being nervous anymore. And so,
[19:40] let's get right into the sermon. So, now
[19:42] an angel has come down in our age. He
[19:45] has revealed the vindicated word to us.
[19:47] And I believe we're living in a season
[19:50] andor age where God is troubling the
[19:53] waters right now. We have a prophet that
[19:56] has came and vindicated the word of the
[19:58] Lord. And I love his voice is still
[20:01] speaking today.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; So, we can jump in the water right now.
[20:05] I believe we're in a season right now.
[20:08] If you have a need, whatever need it may
[20:10] be, it may be the Holy Ghost. It may be
[20:13] financial need. It may be for your home
[20:16] to be brought together as in unity. Jump
[20:18] in that water right now with faith. You
[20:21] don't have to wait for a certain angel
[20:23] to come down. The waters are already
[20:25] trouble right now. Just claim it by
[20:28] faith.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; Just believe it. I believe we're living
[20:31] in the greatest age right now because
[20:33] it's the blending of time and eternity.
[20:37] They asked the prophet, "What age would
[20:38] you like to live in?" He said, "If I
[20:40] could choose, I would pick this age."
[20:41] She said because the blending of time
[20:44] and eternity. So a quote from the
[20:46] prophet here lifting him up out of
[20:48] history. We're standing tonight upon the
[20:50] brim and watching come to pass the
[20:53] unfold two great scenes. And those two
[20:56] great scenes are these. One of them is
[20:58] the ending of history
[21:00] &gt;&gt; and the other one is the ending of time.
[21:03] And many great men down through the ages
[21:05] has longed to see this hour that we're
[21:08] approaching. Even Jesus said prophets
[21:10] long to see what we could see today. So
[21:14] we're a blessed people that we can live
[21:16] in this age where where it may be Satan
[21:19] may be Satan's Eden, but God is still
[21:22] greater than Satan. Doesn't matter what
[21:24] Satan may put before you, God has called
[21:26] you to become overcomers. So you can
[21:29] overcome any and everything that the
[21:31] enemy lays at your wake.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; So let's keep going. As long as see this
[21:36] hour, we're approaching. And as we're
[21:37] living in this glorious setting of the
[21:39] mortal sun and the breaking of eternal
[21:41] light, I do feel that we're living in
[21:44] one of the grandest ages that ever man
[21:47] has been permitted to live because it's
[21:49] the closing out of time and the blending
[21:52] of eternity. History only tells us what
[21:54] we read, what has been, and what's in
[21:57] the future lays in the hand of God. And
[21:59] we find out today that there's not too
[22:02] much history being written because I
[22:03] don't think it'll ever be used.
[22:07] I I I every time I read that, it just
[22:09] gives me goosebumps. I I love that I
[22:11] that God chose us to live in this age.
[22:15] There was no other age he could choose
[22:16] but this age for us to live.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; So be thank we should be thankful and
[22:22] brother Bram said Christians we should
[22:23] be the happiest people in the whole
[22:25] entire world.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; Because we have we we have a a message
[22:30] that's been vindicated time and time
[22:32] again. We have a God. This is the only I
[22:35] won't say relig. This is the only we say
[22:37] religion where God lives inside of his
[22:41] his sons and daughters. There's no other
[22:44] religion like you go to you
[22:46] go to Buddhism, they do not believe in a
[22:48] God that lives inside of them. They may
[22:50] have some wisdom, but we have a God that
[22:52] is the same yesterday, today, and
[22:55] forever.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Matthew 13.
[23:00] Another very familiar scripture.
[23:06] So it says in verse 16 of Matthew 13 um
[23:10] but blessed but blessed are your eyes
[23:13] for they see and your ears for they
[23:16] hear. So I remember the prophet many
[23:18] times he says you got to see yourself in
[23:20] the word of God. That's talking to each
[23:22] one of us says blessed are your eyes. We
[23:25] can see things that other uh
[23:27] denominations can't see. We can see
[23:30] things that other religions cannot see
[23:33] because God has given us eyes to see. We
[23:36] we we place the Isav that God told us we
[23:39] needed to place in Revelations 3 and we
[23:41] can see the word because when we came in
[23:43] contact with the message of the hour,
[23:46] something inside of us just connected
[23:48] &gt;&gt; and we could say amen to it. We mayn't
[23:51] understand it, but we can say amen to
[23:52] it. And we kept walking in it until God
[23:55] gave us a revelation of what the message
[23:58] Malachi 4 is.
[23:59] &gt;&gt; Let's keep it going. Verse 17. For
[24:02] verily I say unto you that many prophets
[24:05] and righteous men have desired to see
[24:07] those things which you see. Think about
[24:10] it. Isaiah wanted to see a day like
[24:11] this. Abraham wanted to see a day like
[24:13] this. Jeremiah, you keep going. Paul
[24:16] wanted to see a day like this. But we we
[24:19] are blessed people. We can see this day.
[24:22] We're blessed people. Just seeing the
[24:24] pope um come from coming up from America
[24:27] to seeing all the prophecies being
[24:29] fulfilled bring us one step closer to to
[24:32] the rapture. Amen.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; One step one step closer. [snorts]
[24:37] &gt;&gt; So it says have desired to see those
[24:39] things which you see and have not seen
[24:41] them which you see uh to hear those
[24:44] things which you hear and have not heard
[24:46] them. Right? Then let's hop in another
[24:49] quote. How can I overcome? We see this
[24:51] age that we're living in is one of the
[24:53] greatest ages of all times. This leodia
[24:55] church age is the grandest of all the
[24:58] church ages because it's the ending of
[25:00] time and the blending of eternity. And
[25:03] it's the greatest uh it's the greatest
[25:05] sinful age as well. It's more sin in
[25:08] this age than has ever been in the
[25:10] powers of Satan is many times harder to
[25:12] fight against than it was in any age. I
[25:15] look 10 years ago and now just to see
[25:17] how how people dress, how women dress,
[25:19] how men dress, you can't even tell who's
[25:22] a man and a woman. Sometimes you got
[25:23] people with colored hair. You got
[25:25] piercings all over the face. You you
[25:27] just see you're looking and and this
[25:30] world is completely gone insane like the
[25:32] prophet says. And but it just shows me
[25:35] that as Satan thinks he's getting
[25:37] powerful that my God cannot be stopped.
[25:41] Nothing is happening by coincidence and
[25:43] is everything is lining up so we can go
[25:46] home.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; So I'm thankful that people may people
[25:50] may be in the politics and this and that
[25:53] but I'll tell you this everything is
[25:55] lining up in the plan of God. So you
[25:58] have nothing to worry about little bride
[26:00] that God has got your back. God is God
[26:03] will be victorious. his word will not
[26:07] return void and you can put your weight
[26:10] on that.
[26:12] [clears throat]
[26:12] &gt;&gt; So I give a little inspiration of of how
[26:15] I got this sermon. So I I I love how how
[26:18] God just just just inspires you. I was
[26:20] listening to um I think this is actually
[26:22] right around the time when Sister
[26:24] Rebecca's album came out and um I was
[26:27] just listening to a certain certain
[26:29] verse and it says even now you're
[26:31] troubling the waters. So it says in in
[26:33] the lyrics, God, you're moving for me.
[26:35] You quiet my soul so I can be still and
[26:38] know that you are moving for me. God,
[26:41] you're moving moving even now you are
[26:43] troubling the waters. And when I heard
[26:45] that even now you're troubling the
[26:46] waters, something just struck me
[26:49] &gt;&gt; and God just began to dealing with me in
[26:51] that that subject. And that's how the
[26:53] sermon birthed in Puerto Rico.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; And let's keep it going. So now I want
[26:57] to point this. A lot of people um just
[27:00] think that uh you you have a good walk
[27:03] with God because he's blessing you
[27:05] naturally.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; But the most important thing is what's
[27:09] happening in here
[27:10] &gt;&gt; because God will bless you naturally.
[27:13] But don't just look at the natural
[27:14] things. You can jump in the water for
[27:16] spiritual things, a closer walk with
[27:19] God, a a double portion of the Holy
[27:22] Ghost. You name that thing. It doesn't
[27:24] have to just be financial things because
[27:26] the Bible says, "But seek ye first the
[27:28] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[27:30] all these things be added on to you." So
[27:32] God knows you need a bank account. He
[27:34] knows you need your house paid. He knows
[27:36] you need a brand new car if you need a
[27:38] car. He knows you need those things. But
[27:40] put your eyes upon him first. Seek his
[27:43] kingdom first because he has a special
[27:45] work for you to do.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to John 3. John uh so um
[27:51] 3r John 1:2. So not St. John, but John
[27:54] chapter 3 or John the 3r John chapter 1.
[27:57] So it says, "Beloved, I wish above all
[28:00] things that thou mayest prosper and be
[28:03] in health even as thy soul prosper."
[28:08] Some people may just read the first
[28:10] part. I I beloved, I wish above all
[28:12] things that you prosper and be in
[28:14] health.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; But what about your soul? That's right.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; Because how many people are in perfectly
[28:20] good health,
[28:21] &gt;&gt; take good care of themselves, and the
[28:22] next day they die of a heart attack
[28:25] &gt;&gt; and they didn't worry about their soul.
[28:26] So it shows me your soul is so much more
[28:29] important
[28:30] &gt;&gt; because if the soul is if the soul is
[28:34] healthy, then the body's going to be
[28:36] healthy as well. Because God God wants
[28:39] you to have a healthy body. He wants you
[28:40] to have health. He wants you to be able
[28:42] to serve him in the full capacity. He
[28:44] knows you need uh healings. And so we
[28:46] don't have to worry so much about um
[28:49] praying necessarily for the the the
[28:51] outside shell, but the inside shell
[28:53] needs to be first because God promised
[28:55] healing. He he died for your healing. In
[28:58] fact, you're healed already. You just
[29:00] have to claim your healing. You're just
[29:01] waiting for your body to line up with
[29:03] your confession that you're just waiting
[29:04] for the manifestation of it.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; So even God, he he when he's on the
[29:08] cross, he didn't die for the outside
[29:10] shell. He died for what's inside. when
[29:13] when when when he was on that cross, he
[29:15] saw you as a completed finished product.
[29:18] See, he's been waiting since the
[29:20] foundation of the world for us to to to
[29:23] uh be that finished product so he can
[29:25] have fellowship with us like he always
[29:27] longed to in the Garden of Eden with
[29:28] Adam and Eve. So, he's trying to restore
[29:30] us back to a a Eden condition. So each
[29:34] trial you go through, each heartache you
[29:36] go through, each tear that you shed is
[29:39] bringing you one step closer to that
[29:42] body change.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; And when that body change you, no more s
[29:45] no more sickness, no more long sleepless
[29:48] nights. The enemy can't tempt you
[29:50] anymore, but keep fighting a little bit
[29:52] longer because the Bible even says, I
[29:55] believe uh in let's go to Romans, not on
[29:57] my notes, but let's go to uh Romans. So,
[29:59] Romans chapter 8, um, and a very
[30:03] familiar scripture as we go here and
[30:05] we'll read verse,
[30:08] okay, Romans 8:18. Now, [clears throat]
[30:11] now check this out. I want you guys
[30:12] really listen to this. For I reckon that
[30:15] the sufferings of this present time are
[30:18] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[30:22] which shall be revealed in us. Check us
[30:25] out. For the earnest expectation of the
[30:28] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[30:30] of the sons of God. For the creature was
[30:34] for the creature was was made subject to
[30:36] vanity, not willingly, but by reason of
[30:39] him who have subjected the the same in
[30:41] hope. Because the creature itself also
[30:43] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[30:45] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[30:47] the children of God. For we know that
[30:50] the whole creation groanth and travaleth
[30:53] in pain together until now. And not only
[30:56] they, but ourselves also, which have the
[30:59] first fruits of the spirit, even
[31:00] ourselves grown within ourselves,
[31:02] waiting for the adoption to with the
[31:04] redemption of our body. So for I reckon
[31:09] that the present sufferings you're going
[31:10] through right now are not worthy to be
[31:12] compared of what is waiting for you on
[31:15] the other side. God promised streets of
[31:18] gold. He promised you a new body. You
[31:20] have so much uh over there to be
[31:23] thankful for. So keep fighting the good
[31:25] fight of faith right now. God has a
[31:28] plan, has a purpose for your life. Keep
[31:30] walking as he lights the path. You keep
[31:33] walking as he as he keeps lighting your
[31:35] way.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; And I promise you, God will never fail
[31:38] you. He promised to be with you and in
[31:41] you until the end of the world. So you
[31:43] have a when God says something, you can
[31:46] once again put your weight on it.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; Let's go. Let's go to first Peter um 1
[31:51] vers7. So 1 Peter 1:7. So it says that
[31:56] the trial of your faith being much more
[31:58] precious than of gold that perisheth
[32:01] though it be tried with fire might be
[32:05] found unto praise and honor and glory in
[32:07] the appearing of Jesus Christ. As you
[32:09] remember last time we said in order to
[32:12] be an overcomer there has to be
[32:14] something in your way for you to
[32:15] overcome. Has to be has to be has to be.
[32:18] Has to be. And you have to be tried.
[32:20] It's a reason. Don't don't be don't be
[32:23] coming up to trial and say, "Man, why is
[32:24] this trial here again?" The scripture
[32:26] just told us that the trying of your
[32:28] faith. So, it's here to shape and mold
[32:30] you. God is trying to bring you into
[32:33] he's restoring you trial by trial
[32:35] restoration to get you back to how you
[32:37] used to be before the fall.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; So when we look at the trial, look at
[32:42] like Paul said like with joy because
[32:45] Paul even said, I forgot where he said
[32:47] it. I believe he said it when uh he he
[32:49] was praying to God. He asked him three
[32:52] times and God said, "My grace is
[32:55] sufficient."
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Let's go to that scripture actually. I
[32:59] think it's in uh I think it's second
[33:00] Corinthians I believe if I'm not
[33:01] mistaken
[33:04] if I'm not mistaken.
[33:06] Let me find it. Yep. So uh second 2
[33:10] Corinthians chap 12
[33:13] we'll do 8- 11.
[33:16] For this thing I besought the Lord
[33:18] thrice that it might depart from me. And
[33:20] he said unto me, "My grace is sufficient
[33:25] for thee, for my strength is made
[33:28] perfect in weakness." So it's nothing
[33:31] wrong with realizing that you're weak. I
[33:34] need God. We all need God.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; And it's okay cuz I Let's keep going.
[33:38] Most gladly, therefore, I rather glory
[33:40] in my infirmities that the power of
[33:42] Christ may rest upon me. Therefore, I
[33:45] take pleasures in infirmities,
[33:47] reproaches, necessities, persecutions,
[33:51] distress. Now, check this last part
[33:52] right here. For Christ's sake, for when
[33:54] I am weak, then I am strong.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; So, God's strength can be made perfect
[34:01] when you're weak.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; So, it's okay to say, "Lord, I need you.
[34:05] Lord, I can't do this without you."
[34:07] Because at the end of the be beginning
[34:08] at the end of the day, God is your
[34:10] strength. He's your refuge. He's your
[34:12] strong tower. God wants to fight the
[34:14] battle for you,
[34:16] &gt;&gt; but we have to get out the way and play
[34:17] our part. Let's keep that going. Um, so
[34:21] I am became a fool in gloring. Ye have
[34:23] compelled me, for I ought to have been
[34:25] commended of you. For nothing am I
[34:27] behind the very chiefs of apostles,
[34:29] though I be nothing. So little bride,
[34:33] don't give up. You got to keep fighting
[34:36] the battle of faith. We are almost
[34:38] there. So you got to realize the enemy
[34:40] knows his time is limited. So he's going
[34:44] to throw everything he has in the
[34:46] kitchen sink at you. So what you got to
[34:48] do is be that much closer to God. Be
[34:51] that much surrender to God. That much in
[34:55] in rest with God. Be still with God.
[34:58] Because when you're hiding God, the
[35:00] enemy doesn't know what to do with you.
[35:03] He's like, I'm throwing everything I
[35:04] have and they're still praising God. So
[35:07] I I always think of this. It's easy to
[35:09] serve God when everything's in perfect
[35:13] harmony and setting. But to me, a true
[35:15] praise and worship is when you can still
[35:17] worship and praise God when everything
[35:19] is going wrong in your life. God is
[35:21] going to I believe God is is going to
[35:23] bless you more because you have to press
[35:25] through more because it's sometime
[35:27] sometimes it's hard to to to lift a
[35:30] praise up when it feels like your breath
[35:32] is just being taken out your body. But
[35:34] when you can have that say, "Lord, I
[35:37] bless your name."
[35:38] &gt;&gt; God is going to say, "That's my son.
[35:41] That's my daughter." [snorts]
[35:43] &gt;&gt; So, so if you woke up today, God is not
[35:48] done with you yet.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; He is not done with you yet.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, there are still battles to
[35:56] overcome. There's still victories to be
[35:58] had. There's still souls to be won.
[36:02] There's still when God filled you with
[36:03] the Holy Ghost, that's when it just
[36:05] began. That that's when your walk just
[36:08] really began. So God has a soul for you
[36:11] to win. God has a ministry for you. I'm
[36:15] not saying just because a ministry
[36:16] doesn't mean you have to you have to
[36:17] minister. You can have a song ministry.
[36:20] You can have a gift of helps. You can
[36:21] have a all kind housewife ministry.
[36:23] Whatever it is, that's a ministry in
[36:25] God's eyes because God can use you to
[36:27] lead somebody to him. Amen.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Let's [snorts] go to Revelations 3 21.
[36:33] So to him that overcomemeth will I grant
[36:35] to sit with me in my throne even as I
[36:39] also overcame and sat down with my
[36:41] father in his throne. So we can have
[36:43] confidence because Jesus has overcame.
[36:46] He He tried it. He he he's tried the
[36:49] inoculation as brother Brandham said. So
[36:51] he we know it's tried in truth. So if he
[36:55] overcame, then we can overcome
[36:58] &gt;&gt; because we're following in the steps of
[36:59] our overcomer. And it's once again, it's
[37:01] not you by yourself, but it's the
[37:03] overcoming the overcomer inside of you
[37:05] overcoming with you to give you the
[37:08] strength. Because without God, we're
[37:10] nothing.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; The the devil will have a field day with
[37:12] us. But when God's inside of you and and
[37:15] he has is he's he's sitting on the
[37:17] throne room of your heart, devil can't
[37:19] do nothing.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; He's defeated right there. Yeah.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; And he's calling a bride without spot
[37:25] and wrinkle. I'm talking about the bride
[37:27] of Jesus Christ that's here tonight
[37:30] &gt;&gt; without spot or wrinkle. And let's talk
[37:32] about another quote. How can I overcome?
[37:34] And now we're speaking on this
[37:35] overcoming. The word overcome. Of
[37:38] course, you know what it means. You got
[37:39] to have something to overcome. In this
[37:42] church age that the Holy Spirit was
[37:44] speaking about here at the Leodysian
[37:46] church age, we have just uh been uh
[37:49] through it. Needed a rebuking. Leodysia
[37:52] had to be rebuked because of its
[37:53] indifference towards Christ. It had put
[37:56] Christ on the outside in their age. And
[37:58] I see that so much because you have so
[38:02] many churches that are gathering, but
[38:04] yet God is not in their midst.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah, they can have an anointed service
[38:09] that they can have a praise and cry and
[38:12] worship,
[38:13] but you see, man is just in control.
[38:16] They have to have certain times they
[38:18] have to be out. They have a certain
[38:19] program they got to follow. How can the
[38:22] Holy Ghost be in that?
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Cuz you're binding the Holy Ghost so he
[38:26] can't even do what he wants to do. And
[38:28] we see so many we see so much
[38:29] compromising. You see 50 years ago they
[38:32] didn't do certain things that they do
[38:34] today. We got so much filth amongst the
[38:37] nominal churches.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; And it to me it's just sad um because
[38:41] they don't realize when God is really in
[38:44] your life, you're going to have a
[38:46] change. You're not going to not going to
[38:48] go to church on Sunday and and c and and
[38:50] curse like a ser at your job the next
[38:51] day. No, that don't work. God don't live
[38:54] in that type of environment. God can't
[38:56] live in that type of environment.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible said that you need
[38:59] a a a new heart, a new spirit, and then
[39:04] he'll put his Holy Spirit. See, a lot of
[39:06] people, they get delivered from
[39:07] drinking, smoking, gambling, but they
[39:09] never go on to be filled with the Holy
[39:12] Ghost. Even brother Brandham said that
[39:14] in this age they can live clean lives
[39:17] and still not be filled with the Holy
[39:19] Ghost. You got to go one step further
[39:21] and be sealed to the day of your
[39:23] redemption. God isn't looking for how
[39:25] many your church attendance. God isn't
[39:27] looking for how many people uh you uh
[39:29] you you fed for soup suppers or donated
[39:32] to the Salvation Army or or $20 you gave
[39:34] to somebody begging on the street. God
[39:36] isn't looking for that. He's looking for
[39:38] the seal of the Holy Ghost.
[39:40] Even I think in the Old Testament, he
[39:42] was looking for those that cried inside
[39:44] uh for the abomination done in the done
[39:47] in the city. So God is coming back to
[39:49] see his seal of approval inside of you.
[39:52] When you get that seal of approval, God
[39:54] has accepted your faith just as he
[39:56] accepted Abraham's faith when he gave
[39:58] him the sign of circumcision. It's no
[40:00] more an outward circumcision, but it's a
[40:02] circumcision of the heart. And when you
[40:05] get that, it's not over yet. It's just
[40:08] beginning. Don't think, "Oh, when I get
[40:10] the Holy Ghost, I I I can just do
[40:11] nothing." No, you have a bigger target
[40:14] on your back because the devil knows you
[40:16] are a threat to his kingdom. And let's
[40:19] wreak havoc in the devil's camp. Let's
[40:21] take back what is ours. Whatever he's
[40:23] stolen from you, take it back right now.
[40:26] Take take your healing back. Take your
[40:28] money back. Take your children back.
[40:30] Take everything back. Cuz he has no
[40:32] right. He has no claims or nothing. He
[40:34] was defeated at Calvary and now he's a
[40:36] defeated creature. So don't let them
[40:38] have any more victories ever again.
[40:40] Amen.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; And Christ was on the outside trying to
[40:46] get back inside. That's love. After he
[40:48] had been put out of his own house was
[40:50] trying to come back in and said, "He
[40:53] that opened the door, I'll come to him."
[40:55] See, the church itself and the whole had
[40:57] put him out. So I I I love God so much
[41:00] because he's always knocking at the
[41:02] door. Even when we were living in sin
[41:04] and shame, he was still knocking at the
[41:07] door at your heart. And when you let him
[41:09] in, I that was the best decision I've
[41:11] ever made in my life because it it gave
[41:14] me a change. It changed my life
[41:16] completely. And I'm pretty sure all of
[41:18] you, all each one of us can testify of
[41:20] that change. And when I gave my life, I
[41:22] I thought I was living life, but when I
[41:24] gave my heart to Christ, then I was live
[41:27] really living life to the fullest.
[41:28] People say, "Oh, living life to the
[41:30] fullest is going to parties, traveling
[41:32] abroad, um drinking, whatever it is."
[41:35] But no, I I've did it. It's not life.
[41:38] It's death. And when I gave my heart to
[41:40] God, that I realized I was missing this
[41:43] the whole entire time. The devil was
[41:44] fooling me thinking a Christian was a
[41:46] boring life. But no, living a Christian
[41:49] life is the best life you can ever live.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Ever live. You have a friend. You have a
[41:54] brother that will never forsake you or
[41:56] leave you. In fact, he stick is closer
[41:58] than a brother.
[42:00] Even when all your friends leave you, I
[42:02] I I I was talking to somebody. Um I I
[42:05] lost two best friends. Um when I I
[42:08] started serving God, we just going
[42:10] different ways and I would try to reach
[42:12] out and I just my uncle my uncle told me
[42:15] this. He was like, "You got to realize
[42:17] this. It's like an elevator. You're
[42:19] going this way and they're going that
[42:20] way." Not in a bad sense, but it's just
[42:22] it's two different spirits. the things
[42:24] you used to do, the atmosphere you were
[42:26] in, you can no longer enjoy that with
[42:28] that person. The dirty jokes, they try
[42:30] to tell you like, "I'm sorry. I just I
[42:32] don't do anymore. It's not who I am
[42:34] anymore." And and they get uncomfortable
[42:36] and they'll ignore your calls. And I was
[42:38] like, "That's fine." And and I told um I
[42:41] was telling somebody this. So, uh,
[42:43] Brother Jose, that's one of my he's my
[42:45] best friend. And um I was thinking about
[42:48] that. I was like, "So, I lost two best
[42:49] friends and God gave me him."
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Um because I I don't mind being
[42:56] alone, you know, like a person alone,
[42:57] but like it's good to have a a a friend
[43:01] that can challenge your faith that that
[43:03] can help you go higher. And so I really
[43:05] like that even first meeting him. I I
[43:07] never forget um at the men's meeting,
[43:09] brother Jose said, "You should have a
[43:11] testimony of God working and moving your
[43:13] life every day." And that challenged me
[43:16] because if God is moving and working in
[43:18] life, something something should change.
[43:19] even it's the smallest little things,
[43:21] something should change every day. And
[43:23] that that really challenged my faith
[43:24] right there. And it just shows me it's
[43:26] it's very important to have a good um a
[43:30] good group of believers around you. And
[43:32] I believe I have the cream of the crop
[43:33] here in West Palm Beach. And and I'm
[43:35] thankful to be a part of of of of Spirit
[43:38] and Truth Tabernacle um because I've
[43:40] grown so much a as a as a man, as a
[43:43] Christian, as a minister. And it's all
[43:45] because God knows what he's doing. God
[43:48] knows exactly what he's doing. Um,
[43:50] placing everybody here. Everybody can
[43:52] have a testimony of how they got here.
[43:53] And I'm thankful that I could be a part
[43:56] of this wonderful ministry here at
[43:57] Spirit and Truth.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; So, [clears throat] let's go to Mark
[44:01] 11:24.
[44:06] Another very familiar scripture. I think
[44:07] we'll start a couple verses ahead,
[44:09] actually.
[44:17] All right, let's go to um how much time?
[44:19] Okay, we're doing good on Wow. Okay,
[44:21] Mark 11 and we'll go with verses
[44:26] verse 22.
[44:28] And Jesus answered saith unto them, have
[44:32] faith in God. I love that simple
[44:34] statement. It is simple as that. Have
[44:36] faith in God. anytime you saw when Jesus
[44:40] was was uh was dealing with individuals
[44:42] who need healing, he said, "If thou
[44:44] canst believe," I love how he said, "You
[44:47] don't have to figure it out. You don't
[44:48] have to understand. You have to solve
[44:49] his math equation." But he just said,
[44:51] "If thou canst believe, even he told
[44:54] brother Brandham, if you can get the
[44:56] people just to believe, that's all he
[44:58] said. Get the people to believe. Keep
[45:00] your eyes on God." So he says, "Have
[45:02] faith in God. For verily I say unto you,
[45:05] that whosoever shall say unto this
[45:09] mountain, shall say in this mountain, Be
[45:11] thou removed, and be cast into the sea,
[45:14] and shall not doubt in his heart, that's
[45:16] a key right there, not doubt in his
[45:18] heart, but shall believe that those
[45:20] things which he say shall come to pass,
[45:22] he shall have whatsoever he saith. So
[45:25] when you're jumping in the troubled
[45:26] waters, you got to have no doubt in your
[45:29] heart. What whatsoever you believe,
[45:31] believe that's going to come to pass.
[45:33] Just jump in that water and say, "Lord,
[45:35] the waters are trouble right now. I'm
[45:37] claiming my healing. I'm claiming my
[45:39] kids. I'm claiming financial
[45:40] breakthrough. I'm claiming my business.
[45:42] I'm claiming my family. Whatever it is,
[45:44] you jump in that water and have faith
[45:46] that it the need will be met. It It'll
[45:49] be met right on time. Right on time.
[45:52] Every time it'll be met."
[45:54] &gt;&gt; It says, "And he shall have whatsoever
[45:56] he saith." Verse 24. Therefore, I say
[45:59] unto you, whatsoever things you desire
[46:02] when you pray, believe that you receive
[46:04] them. So, I already believe that you
[46:06] receive. Start start glorifying God
[46:09] right now. Thank you, Lord, in advance.
[46:11] Thank you for my Thank you for my
[46:13] children. Thank you for my family. Thank
[46:15] you for my cousins. Whatever it may be,
[46:17] say, "Thank you, Lord. It's already
[46:19] done. It's already done."
[46:22] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[46:22] &gt;&gt; And when you stand uh and when you stand
[46:24] praying, forgive you, have if you have
[46:26] ought against any that your father also
[46:28] which is in heaven may [clears throat]
[46:29] forgive your trespasses. But if you do
[46:31] not forgive, neither will your father
[46:34] which is in heaven forgive your
[46:35] trespass. That's that's something I I I
[46:37] had to learn um as a young Christian
[46:41] that the hardest thing to do is to
[46:43] forgive.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Um ju just you know with different
[46:46] things that happen in your life,
[46:47] whatever it may be sometime it's so
[46:49] hard. But I'll tell you this, there's to
[46:51] me is no greater freedom than to be able
[46:54] to forgive somebody when they don't even
[46:56] say tell you sorry
[46:58] &gt;&gt; and God can only want to give you
[47:00] strength to do that because it's hard
[47:01] because as human beings we we want to
[47:04] try to justify this person hurt me so
[47:06] bad. But when you hold on it's like a
[47:08] rope somebody's pulling and you're
[47:10] holding on to it. It keeps hurting
[47:12] because the other person may never know
[47:14] or may never even care to say sorry. But
[47:17] you got to make peace within yourself.
[47:19] Make peace with your past. I've learned
[47:21] a lot of people don't make peace with
[47:23] their past and it causes so many other
[47:26] issues down the road in their families,
[47:29] uh, in their relationships, in their
[47:30] friendships because they're holding on
[47:32] to something and it's causing lash out
[47:34] because they can't make peace. So I I I
[47:37] tell I try to tell people make peace
[47:39] with your past is be the greatest thing
[47:42] you can do because you can move forward
[47:43] deeper on with God. And it's so it's so
[47:46] that's why God even said if you can't
[47:47] forgive then he can't forgive your
[47:49] trespasses. So for to in God's eyes
[47:52] forgiveness is important. I look at
[47:53] this. If he can forgive us look look how
[47:56] much um how much uh somebody is telling
[47:59] me today about the passion of the Christ
[48:00] and I was saying the I never seen it but
[48:02] I know it's really a bloody scenes when
[48:04] he was getting beaten. I said that can't
[48:06] even justify what he went through for
[48:07] you. He went through so much. Just
[48:10] imagine, I don't know how many people
[48:11] have been born since Adam until now, but
[48:14] just imagine taking on everybody's sins.
[48:17] Literally, the people you came uh to die
[48:19] for, they spit in your face. They
[48:21] slapped you. They mocked you. And he
[48:23] could still say on the cross, "Father,
[48:25] forgive them. They know not what they
[48:26] do." So, if Jesus could forgive us, then
[48:29] he can give us the strength to forgive
[48:31] whoever hurt you. Whoever hurt you. Hey,
[48:34] it happened. It's in the past. We got to
[48:36] move forward so God can give us more
[48:38] victories. So we can build better
[48:40] relationships w with with being
[48:42] forgiven. You can be a testimony to
[48:44] somebody else who may be going through
[48:45] the same thing you were going through.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Let's go to um John 10:10.
[48:51] The thief cometh not but for to steal,
[48:53] to kill, and to destroy. I am come that
[48:56] they may have life and they may have it
[48:58] more abundantly. So God is trying to
[49:00] give you life and more abundantly each
[49:02] day. Each day you wake up, you have a
[49:04] chance to have life and have it more
[49:06] abundantly because it's another chance
[49:07] that God can show you who he is in a
[49:10] deeper uh a deep a deeper magnitude.
[49:14] Let's go to Matthew 8 18:e 19. So I I
[49:18] love right I love I love this I love
[49:20] this word right here. It says for where
[49:22] there are two or three gathered in my
[49:23] name there I am in the midst. So now no
[49:28] other religion can set claims on that.
[49:30] He said where two or three gather in my
[49:32] name there I am in the midst.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So a message from who has believed
[49:39] our report. Now let's let's look what
[49:41] kind of group that was of [snorts] lame
[49:43] and halt and blind. So talking about the
[49:45] bull uh the pool of Bethesda. Now what a
[49:47] a mass of disfigured humanity waiting
[49:50] for the trouble of this waters.
[49:51] Historians tell us that even to fight
[49:54] and to get in the water, they would cut
[49:56] each other with knives and try to get
[49:57] ahead of one another to step in the sea
[50:00] if their faith was sufficient to make
[50:01] them whole. So, we don't have to fight
[50:03] one another. We don't have to stab one
[50:04] another. We can just jump in freely
[50:06] because we got the Holy Ghost here. So,
[50:08] don't no don't don't try to stab nobody.
[50:09] Just jump right in. Just jump right in
[50:11] the water and and put claims on what you
[50:14] have. Just put claims right on what you
[50:16] have.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Let's go to another one. What here is
[50:20] thou Elijah? Under the porch where these
[50:22] great spouts run, the waters flowed
[50:24] around by the sheepool coming down. Now
[50:27] the people laid there in great
[50:28] multitudes. And they didn't wait just
[50:31] for one night, two nights, three nights.
[50:32] They would wait for months and year.
[50:34] Just imagine that. Waiting for years at
[50:37] at a pool for the troubling of the
[50:39] water. And some didn't even get it. And
[50:42] some of them had laid there a year and
[50:44] out and waiting for the troubling of the
[50:46] water. At the first time that somebody
[50:47] stepped in with faith enough to be
[50:49] healed, it draw the virtue out of the
[50:52] angel of the water. And they had to wait
[50:54] for another season. What a season was
[50:57] allowed, I don't know, perhaps weeks.
[50:58] But they waited patiently for it to come
[51:00] into the water. And historians tell us
[51:02] that they would stab one another trying
[51:04] to get in the water. See who get there
[51:06] first to test their faith? The angel of
[51:08] the Lord. So God in all ages at all
[51:12] times has always had a way of divine
[51:15] healing always. All the way back into
[51:18] the Old Testament, all throughout the
[51:19] New Testament down through the aged
[51:22] right to this present time, God has been
[51:25] a fountain open for those who believe
[51:28] for divine healing. So the fountain is
[51:30] open tonight. You can't exhaust God.
[51:33] Like brother Brandham said, a fish in
[51:34] water. It's not worrying about its last
[51:37] drink. It just drinks freely. So you
[51:40] can't exhaust God. Ask big things. Ask
[51:42] small things. God God said open up your
[51:45] mouth. He even said we said like we said
[51:47] last time bring your strong reasoning.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; He said you you haven't received because
[51:52] you ask not.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Ask, seek, knock, it shall be open. We
[51:58] got to start. Brother Brandham said we
[52:00] live a million miles below our
[52:01] privilege.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; We got to we got to live above our
[52:04] privilege. God is calling us to live
[52:06] above our privilege. We we live in an
[52:08] age where the book is fully open from
[52:10] Genesis to Revelation. We have so many
[52:12] promises in this book we can lay claims
[52:14] to. Don't be scared. God sent a prophet
[52:17] to vindicate the word for you so you can
[52:20] use it. You're the bride of Jesus
[52:22] Christ.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; The the word get back in step with the
[52:26] word so God can start uh can start
[52:29] manifesting the word in your life. So,
[52:32] it's so important that we get back in
[52:33] step with the word of God. We have to
[52:35] cuz the bride has made herself ready.
[52:38] Brother Brandon, when you saw that
[52:39] vision, the bride got out of step, but
[52:41] she he said, "Get back in step." She got
[52:43] right back in step. So you might falter
[52:45] sometimes, but get right back in step.
[52:48] Right back in step. So let's go for
[52:51] another quote. Look, where are you
[52:53] looking to church? Oh, these last days.
[52:55] Oh, he's been right among us people and
[52:58] we forget it. He sit right among us and
[53:01] we didn't know it. The Holy Spirit is
[53:03] here this morning. Maybe we will go away
[53:05] and forget it. Maybe many that will that
[53:07] that sick will forget to believe and
[53:09] anchor their faith right now where it
[53:11] should be the truth. Truly, the pool is
[53:13] troubled. The waters are whirling
[53:15] backwards from the natural showing the
[53:17] supernatural. The Holy Spirit is here
[53:19] taking a normal bunch of people
[53:21] intelligent sitting here well-dressed,
[53:23] well educated looking, the Holy Spirit
[53:25] falling upon them and something rose
[53:27] around them. They holler, "Glory,
[53:29] hallelujah. What's the matter?" The
[53:31] troubling of the water.
[53:34] Okay, we're almost we got we got some
[53:35] time. Don't worry, I won't I won't hold
[53:37] you too long. I won't hold you hostage
[53:38] tonight. Um, so I'll say we once again,
[53:42] we don't have to wait for the troubling
[53:45] of the waters like they did in that
[53:46] time. The waters are troubled right now.
[53:48] Don't wait before it's too late. Do it
[53:51] right now. Let's go to Proverbs 8 18:10.
[53:54] Says, "The name of the Lord is a strong
[53:56] tower." Maybe somebody needs deliverance
[53:59] tonight. Maybe somebody's struggling in
[54:01] their mind because the the prophet said,
[54:02] "The greatest battle ever's fought is in
[54:04] your mind." The devil is constantly
[54:07] attacking at your mind. He's using
[54:08] psychology. He's using scientific. He's
[54:11] using voices on social media. He's
[54:13] constantly trying to attack your mind.
[54:16] Maybe you need to break from those
[54:17] chains. You can defy those chains. Don't
[54:20] Don't let the enemy give you an
[54:22] identity. Your identity is in Jesus
[54:25] Christ. Don't let the enemy tell you who
[54:28] you are. Let the word of God, let Jesus
[54:30] tell you who you are because he'll tell
[54:32] the truth. The devil won't The devil
[54:34] will tell you lies. Let God tell you who
[54:36] you are. It's the greatest revelation
[54:38] you'll ever have
[54:40] &gt;&gt; to find out who you are inside of
[54:42] Christ. That's where you'll find your
[54:43] identity. You are Miss Jesus Christ.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Hebrews 4 uh 14-16.
[54:50] So, I I I love that we can serve a God
[54:53] who understands us. He He was in flesh
[54:56] like you and me. He drank water. He got
[54:59] hungry. He got sick. He got tired. Uh he
[55:03] had temptation above all measure, the
[55:05] Bible said. So he knows what you're
[55:07] going through. If you're a teenager, he
[55:08] knows what you're going through. He
[55:10] knows what's being thrown at you. So he
[55:13] can relate to who you are. If if he he
[55:15] can relate to any age, he can relate to
[55:17] you. He was sick at one point. He lost
[55:19] he had he experienced death in his
[55:21] family, death in his friends, and and he
[55:24] experienced those things. So he knows
[55:26] exactly what each teardrop what it
[55:29] means. Even you don't say anything, he
[55:31] knows you. He knows you from the inside
[55:33] out. He even knows the number of hairs
[55:34] on your head.
[55:36] So let's go to um so seeing that we have
[55:38] a great high priest that is passed into
[55:40] heavens, Jesus the son of God, let us
[55:44] hold fast our profession. For we have
[55:47] not a high priest which cannot be
[55:49] touched with the feeling of our
[55:50] infirmities, but was in all points
[55:53] tempted like as we are, yet without sin.
[55:58] Let us therefore come boldly unto the
[56:01] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[56:03] and find grace to help in the time of
[56:06] need. I'll tell you, Jesus is here for
[56:08] you. He doesn't want you to do this
[56:10] alone. He wants to hold your hand. He
[56:13] wants to lead you. He wants to guide
[56:14] you. He wants to be there for you, but
[56:17] you have to first let him into your
[56:19] life. Give him full preeminence. The
[56:21] prophet said, "There's there's there's
[56:23] doors in our heart that we have not
[56:24] opened up yet. Let's open the doors we
[56:27] haven't opened up yet." I promise you,
[56:29] it's it's hard, but once you do, Jesus
[56:33] can do the work he needs to do in your
[56:34] life. He wants to give you He wants to
[56:37] make you new inside. He he wants to give
[56:39] you he wants you to he wants to help you
[56:41] to be free and to break those those
[56:43] chains of things because sometimes in
[56:45] our life we we get so used to to living
[56:48] with um our our vices. So to so getting
[56:52] used to living to living with our our
[56:54] faults and our mistakes and all these
[56:55] things that we become a prisoner in our
[56:57] past. And God says he can break every
[57:00] chain.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; No, no matter how long the chain's been
[57:02] on for, he can break every chain. No
[57:04] matter how long uh you've been sentenced
[57:06] for the the jail cell is open, just walk
[57:09] out. Just walk out. Just walk out.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; All we're going to close here these last
[57:15] couple quotes. Uh so when sickness came
[57:18] into the camp, he had an atonement made.
[57:21] He promised to be the God in the time of
[57:23] trouble. He's still that same God today,
[57:26] a present help. He promised to do these
[57:29] things and to see them through. If he
[57:31] started a good work in you, he'll finish
[57:33] it. Don't worry. Now, as he was then in,
[57:37] he is today, the same spirit of God that
[57:39] led Israel leads the church today,
[57:42] bringing us through as it was in the
[57:44] wilderness to the promised land. We have
[57:46] a promised land. You believe that in my
[57:48] father's house are many mansions. I go
[57:50] to prepare a place for you. It's talking
[57:53] to you personally. And you will come
[57:55] again and receive you unto myself. We're
[57:57] on our way. We're going to the glorious
[57:59] promised land that was promised to us.
[58:02] Now along this journey, he's promised to
[58:04] supply everything that we need of
[58:08] everything. Whatsoever you ask the
[58:10] father in my name, that will I do.
[58:12] Whatsoever things. Whatsoever things you
[58:14] desire when you pray, believe you
[58:16] receive it. You shall have it. Now, he
[58:18] gave us the strongest I'm going to say
[58:20] this again. He gave us the strongest
[58:23] weapon that there is in all the world.
[58:26] And what is that?
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Prayer. Amen. That's prayer. Prayer is
[58:30] what changes things. The prophet said
[58:34] the Christian doesn't realize what a
[58:36] force he has when he kneels on his knees
[58:40] before the almighty God in the name of
[58:44] Jesus Christ. He doesn't realize what
[58:46] power that is. If the people could only
[58:50] realize that what is given right unto
[58:53] them. Anything that you ask for be
[58:55] given. You can if you if you can
[58:58] appropriate the faith to believe for
[59:00] God's word is true. Just let one of them
[59:04] um this is from the maniac of G of Garda
[59:06] Garda. Just let him find one sincere
[59:09] heart that he can get into that he will
[59:12] come anytime in any hour of the night. I
[59:14] love that. Anytime any hour of the night
[59:17] doesn't matter if it's 2 a.m. in the
[59:18] morning. Doesn't matter if it's 3:00
[59:19] a.m. 1000 p.m. God is right there. I'm
[59:24] so thankful that we have a doctor that
[59:26] could come at any time. I'm so happy for
[59:29] that. He's the greatest psychiatrist.
[59:31] You don't need to go to no shrink. You
[59:33] have the greatest counselor right here,
[59:36] Jesus Christ.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; I'm so happy for that to know that he's
[59:40] my refuge and strength and a very
[59:42] present help in a time of trouble. And
[59:44] last quote and we'll close here.
[59:47] And grant Lord that you'll send tonight
[59:50] your great divine angel, your healing
[59:52] spirit. May maybe it's the same angel
[59:56] that was on the pool Bethesda. We do not
[59:58] know. I don't know him. Father in that
[1:00:01] way, his name maybe it's the same angel
[1:00:03] that followed the children of Israel
[1:00:05] that led them rather in a sign of a
[1:00:07] pillar of fire. Maybe it's that same
[1:00:09] pillar of fire that we're looking at.
[1:00:11] Maybe he's here tonight. I trust that he
[1:00:13] will be and show great signs and
[1:00:15] wonders. And may there come a stirring
[1:00:18] among the people quickly for we realize
[1:00:21] the Lord that we just have a few days to
[1:00:23] be here. Just in closing,
[1:00:26] don't let this season pass by.
[1:00:30] Don't let the season pass by. God is
[1:00:33] restoring.
[1:00:34] He's in the restoration business. He
[1:00:36] said, "I will restore, sayeth the Lord."
[1:00:38] So ask what you have need of. We all
[1:00:41] need a restoration. We all need it. We
[1:00:44] all need to be brought closer to God. We
[1:00:46] all need things. Let your needs be ma
[1:00:48] made known before God right now. Don't
[1:00:50] be scared. Oh, God doesn't want know.
[1:00:53] God wants to hear you. He cares about
[1:00:54] the little things in your life. He cares
[1:00:56] about the big things in your life. He
[1:00:58] cares about the desires of your heart.
[1:00:59] So, God loves you. He wouldn't have died
[1:01:02] for you. He wouldn't have brought you.
[1:01:03] You're not here by coincidence. You're
[1:01:05] here tonight. Whatever you've been
[1:01:06] through, you stood the test and you're
[1:01:08] still here standing. So, keep marching
[1:01:11] with eyes of faith. God will never leave
[1:01:13] you. He promised that. Amen.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads.
[1:01:17] Dear heavenly father, we're so thankful,
[1:01:20] Lord, that we're living in this day and
[1:01:22] age, Lord, where, Father, you you've
[1:01:25] been made so plain, Lord, through your
[1:01:27] prophet, Lord. You showed us, Lord, that
[1:01:30] you are the same yesterday, today, and
[1:01:33] forever, Lord. And Lord, you are the
[1:01:36] same God that led the children of Israel
[1:01:38] the pillar of fire. And you're the same
[1:01:40] God leading us with the pillar of fire,
[1:01:41] your Holy Ghost. And Lord, we all have
[1:01:45] many things here tonight, Lord. We all
[1:01:48] been through the fire. We all been
[1:01:50] through so many trials and tests, Lord.
[1:01:53] But we're a product of your grace
[1:01:55] because we made it this far because of
[1:01:56] you, Lord. Lord, you you've given us
[1:02:00] plenty of weapons, armor, a helmet, a
[1:02:03] shield, girdle, all the a sword. You've
[1:02:05] given us so many weapons, Lord, that we
[1:02:07] can utilize, Lord. But I love how you
[1:02:09] said it's your strength, almighty God.
[1:02:11] It's not our strength, but it's your
[1:02:13] strength, Lord. Father, help us from
[1:02:15] this day forward, Lord, to march on w
[1:02:18] with hearts of faith, Lord Jesus. This
[1:02:20] knowing that we only have a few more
[1:02:21] days here, Lord. That Father, you
[1:02:24] ordained us to be in this age for a
[1:02:25] reason to to to to run havoc in the
[1:02:28] enemy's camp. Father, may we destroy
[1:02:31] what the enemy, Lord, has brought to us.
[1:02:34] Help us to be sober and to be vigilant,
[1:02:36] Lord, almighty God, because we know the
[1:02:38] enemy is trying to going to set traps,
[1:02:40] Lord. May we be aware spiritually of
[1:02:42] what he sets before us, almighty God.
[1:02:45] And father, may you bless each
[1:02:46] individual here tonight, Lord. May you
[1:02:48] meet each need. May you help each
[1:02:50] individual, Lord. May you bring each one
[1:02:52] of them closer to Christ. And we'll be
[1:02:53] careful to give you all the praise and
[1:02:55] honor. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[1:02:57] Amen.
[1:03:00] [applause]
[1:03:11] Amen.
[1:03:12] We certainly thank God for his word on
[1:03:16] tonight. Um I just believe that when um
[1:03:22] the Lord sends someone to speak to us
[1:03:25] and they give us a a subject like that,
[1:03:29] then God is certainly trying to elevate
[1:03:31] our faith.
[1:03:33] Um the title was even now you're
[1:03:38] troubling the water. And um when we just
[1:03:42] go back in scripture and look at that
[1:03:45] whole situation and what the Lord Jesus
[1:03:49] was doing, this man was there bound with
[1:03:52] a condition uh for 38 years. And
[1:03:57] according to our prophet, um it wasn't
[1:04:01] anything that was going to kill the man.
[1:04:04] He he had this um this situation, but it
[1:04:07] wasn't something that was going to kill
[1:04:08] him. He had been living with it for 38
[1:04:11] years. So um you know but when Jesus
[1:04:16] gets to him and um he begins to ask him
[1:04:21] very specific question and that was will
[1:04:25] thou be made whole. Um you know and and
[1:04:29] and the man hears the question but he
[1:04:32] begins to give a answer different than
[1:04:35] what Jesus asked. Uh his answer is,
[1:04:39] "Well, you know, whenever the angel come
[1:04:42] in trouble the water, there's nobody to
[1:04:46] help me get in." And um Jesus wasn't
[1:04:49] even talking about getting in the water.
[1:04:52] He asks, "Will thou be made whole?"
[1:04:55] Right? And um sometimes we miss what God
[1:04:59] is speaking to us at the time that he's
[1:05:02] speaking. And I just believe the Holy
[1:05:03] Spirit came to speak a word to each and
[1:05:05] every one of us here tonight. Uh and and
[1:05:08] that is right now the water's being
[1:05:11] troubled. So whatever your need is, you
[1:05:15] can get in. He didn't have to wait for
[1:05:18] the angel to come trouble the water. The
[1:05:20] one that was sending the angel was
[1:05:22] standing present and all he had to do is
[1:05:25] receive from the Lord Jesus. and and and
[1:05:28] and the good thing about is that even
[1:05:29] though he had given all the wrong
[1:05:31] answers,
[1:05:33] Jesus Jesus said, "Take up your bed and
[1:05:36] and and just, you know, go ahead and
[1:05:38] leave." And because of his obedience,
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; because of his obedience, the man
[1:05:46] received his healing. And I tell you, I
[1:05:48] tell you, if we if we would just be
[1:05:50] obedient to the the word of the Lord
[1:05:52] tonight, because the angel of God is
[1:05:55] troubling the water.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; If we be obedient to God, will receive
[1:05:59] whatever we have need of. He comes
[1:06:02] sometimes in in the simplest of forms.
[1:06:04] Uh the prophet told us that he's hidden
[1:06:08] and revealed in simplicity. Amen. Thank
[1:06:13] God for brother Mark. Amen. On tonight.
[1:06:15] God bless you.
[1:06:18] Praise God. Amen. We we certainly uh
[1:06:21] appreciate
[1:06:23] the word of the Lord. Let me um uh get
[1:06:26] tonight's um announcements

[1:12:44] Um, brother Steve came one Sunday and
[1:12:49] his message was season recover all
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; and also in that he said that one
[1:12:57] testimony make room for another.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; And I'm truly grateful to say and to be
[1:13:05] standing here to say that I've uh gone
[1:13:08] to Australia and made it back home.
[1:13:11] Uh during that time
[1:13:14] I wanted to go to Australia but uh you
[1:13:17] know the flesh was a little nervous
[1:13:18] about the amount this that and the other
[1:13:21] and after hearing brother Steve at the
[1:13:24] end of that message uh basically I was
[1:13:27] saying I want to go and at the end of
[1:13:29] the message I was saying I'm going
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; and when he was saying that one
[1:13:34] testimony make room for another there
[1:13:37] was a testimony uh we had gone out to
[1:13:41] And uh there was a testimony and that
[1:13:44] basically a light bulb after hearing
[1:13:47] that testimony just came on and God just
[1:13:51] continued. He started opening up doors,
[1:13:55] continued opening up doors, continued
[1:13:57] opening up doors. And I tell you when I
[1:14:02] think about Australia, I actually never
[1:14:04] even thought about going to Australia.
[1:14:07] Um
[1:14:09] God has just blessed me beyond
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; even my dreams or thoughts.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Uh the time that we had is beyond
[1:14:19] measure. You all I can say is I know we
[1:14:22] going again so you better get on board.
[1:14:25] [laughter]
[1:14:26] It was just tremendous. The fellowship,
[1:14:30] the ministering of the word was just
[1:14:32] over the top. uh the fellowship, the
[1:14:36] people, it everything was just great.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; And I'm just so grateful that God would
[1:14:41] allow me,
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; I mean me
[1:14:46] to uh
[1:14:49] I'll say experience,
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; such greatness,
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; with the people of God.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; I am I'm just in awe.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And I'm looking forward to
[1:15:03] more testimonies, opening up more
[1:15:05] testimonies, following more, and I know
[1:15:08] God has more in store. God bless.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:13] [applause]
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Certainly thank the Lord for uh giving
[1:15:18] our sister that opportunity. And there's
[1:15:21] know a few other saints, roughly nine uh
[1:15:24] of us total from our church were able to
[1:15:27] go and and uh and I did mention to them
[1:15:31] while I was there, there was a a tape
[1:15:33] that we were listening to um early this
[1:15:37] year and uh sitting there on one of the
[1:15:40] Friday night tape services and as I'm
[1:15:42] listening to the tape, brother Rana
[1:15:44] makes a a comment and it says um it says
[1:15:49] uh these tapes
[1:15:50] are going a whole into the the jungles
[1:15:54] of Africa and way down in Australia. And
[1:15:58] it says where uh the way that they get
[1:16:00] sugar is that they have to take a ant
[1:16:03] and cut it in half and get sugar out the
[1:16:05] ant. And that's how they they live. And
[1:16:07] I had I'm like n when I go to Australia,
[1:16:10] I never seen nobody cut no ant or do
[1:16:12] nothing like that. And um and you know I
[1:16:15] read the quote and uh I said you know
[1:16:18] I'm sure this happens somewhere. I don't
[1:16:19] know if it's happening in Africa. I
[1:16:21] don't know where you know where where
[1:16:22] all this is connected. I said but
[1:16:24] brother Random said it's happening so
[1:16:25] it's happening. And um so I read the
[1:16:27] quote and I said there were two things.
[1:16:29] The first is I said this quote
[1:16:33] um actually was the thing that liberated
[1:16:36] me and my thought process of going to
[1:16:40] Australia because I was getting tired of
[1:16:42] the the journey. Uh but this time God
[1:16:44] gave us a different route that we took
[1:16:46] that made it a lot easier you know on
[1:16:48] the body and uh but I I said this quote
[1:16:51] liberated me and I realized because he
[1:16:53] said in quote there not only are
[1:16:56] ministers coming down praying playing
[1:16:57] the tapes but he said there are
[1:16:58] ministers that are interpreting what is
[1:17:00] on the tapes and I realized I was
[1:17:04] fitting right in that category. I like
[1:17:06] to read those quotes and interpret what
[1:17:09] is actually on the tapes. Right? So uh I
[1:17:12] realized that you know okay we done
[1:17:14] stepped into the vision and uh and I
[1:17:16] said so if the if the prophet said
[1:17:18] ministers are going down then I'm one of
[1:17:20] those ministers that's going down to do
[1:17:22] that. So I felt very you know free to
[1:17:25] commit myself as long as the Lord gives
[1:17:28] me health
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; and as long as the Lord gives me
[1:17:32] strength I will be heading to Australia.
[1:17:35] Amen. So, anybody want to go uh you're
[1:17:38] welcome uh to get in on this. And uh
[1:17:41] after I I made that comment and one of
[1:17:44] the sisters had come to me and she says,
[1:17:46] "Brother Jack," and this is her first
[1:17:48] year actually in the meetings. And uh
[1:17:50] she come to me and she says, "Uh,
[1:17:51] brother Jack, I want to tell you that my
[1:17:55] father ministers to people in the bush
[1:17:58] land, the Aboriginal people, and they do
[1:18:01] exactly brother Brandham said that they
[1:18:02] do." So, I'm like, "Wow." Oh, I mean, I
[1:18:06] didn't know that this quote was actually
[1:18:08] real, you know, but uh and she said
[1:18:11] that's exactly what happens in in in the
[1:18:13] bush here in Australia. I said, well,
[1:18:15] praise the Lord. So, I know I'm I'm I'm
[1:18:17] I'm in the word. Amen. And the other
[1:18:20] thing that the prophet told us that
[1:18:22] anytime you go on the mission field,
[1:18:26] you're always in the perfect will of
[1:18:29] God. Amen. And the reason being is
[1:18:31] because he told us to go into Amen. uh
[1:18:35] all the world and to preach the gospel
[1:18:38] and going to Australia is on the other
[1:18:40] side of the world. They already into
[1:18:43] Thursday. They almost halfway done with
[1:18:45] Thursday and we we uh we you know trying
[1:18:49] to finish up Wednesday. So uh but we we
[1:18:52] thank God it was good to be there.
[1:18:53] Anybody else want to share a testimony?
[1:18:55] Come on, brother. And and sister after
[1:18:57] after No, you come on, brother. And then
[1:18:59] she'll come after you. Amen. Praise the
[1:19:02] Lord.
[1:19:15] God bless you. Um
[1:19:20] I'd like to uh echo our dear sister in
[1:19:24] terms of the trip. Um going to Australia
[1:19:27] was a wonderful time. uh appreciate the
[1:19:30] Lord and allow us to experience that. It
[1:19:32] was my first time going to Australia as
[1:19:34] well. Um but uh I just wanted to give
[1:19:39] thanks to the Lord and praise the Lord
[1:19:40] for one of the something that happened
[1:19:43] while I was there. Um, I did um I came
[1:19:47] before you um a while back and I I told
[1:19:52] you that um that the Lord had done
[1:19:56] something for me and my family in that
[1:19:59] um when I was in the military um I had
[1:20:04] gotten um a disability rating of 90%
[1:20:08] and um he um um eventually the Lord
[1:20:14] increase that disability to 100%.
[1:20:18] Um, and they did that in 2020.
[1:20:23] And so when they did that, that allowed
[1:20:26] my um my kids to get educational
[1:20:30] benefits during that time.
[1:20:33] Um but they also when um when they did
[1:20:37] that they backdated it to when um tw um
[1:20:42] 2011.
[1:20:44] So um
[1:20:48] that backdating of the 2011 100%
[1:20:53] with that comes
[1:20:56] back pay.
[1:20:58] So when I was in
[1:21:02] Australia
[1:21:05] um they had gone through the process. So
[1:21:08] in 2024 they had um notified us notified
[1:21:13] me that they were they had approved it
[1:21:16] to
[1:21:18] backdated to 2020 and they my kids had
[1:21:22] already started school but they I've
[1:21:24] been waiting for them to go through the
[1:21:26] process since December of 2024
[1:21:30] and so
[1:21:32] all this time I've just been watching
[1:21:35] and watching and waiting to see what was
[1:21:38] going to happen. But when I was in
[1:21:40] Australia,
[1:21:41] I kind of just happened to I wasn't
[1:21:44] looking for that. I was just opening up
[1:21:47] my my um my app and looking at my
[1:21:50] account. And then when I opened it up
[1:21:52] and I looked and I was like, "Oo,
[1:21:57] whoa,
[1:21:58] wait a minute here. Something's a lot is
[1:22:01] different here."
[1:22:03] And so this back pay is goes back
[1:22:07] Uh it was for nine years of back pay
[1:22:10] that they uh that popped into my account
[1:22:13] while we were there in Octure. So this
[1:22:16] is the our theme is the overflow.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; That was like a over overflow.
[1:22:23] [applause]
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; So I just want to thank the Lord for the
[1:22:26] overflow. God bless you.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; CERTAINLY UM THE Lord gave us that theme
[1:22:38] at the beginning of the year about
[1:22:41] overflow and we're still hearing
[1:22:42] testimonies of what God is doing. And as
[1:22:45] Sister Brown said, one testimony
[1:22:49] will lead to another testimony.
[1:22:52] And uh while we were there in Australia,
[1:22:54] I was just sharing how I heard a
[1:22:57] preacher out of um out of um Zimbabwe, I
[1:23:02] believe, in the in the meetings in
[1:23:04] Dubai. He said he prayed a simple
[1:23:07] prayer. He said, "Lord, I need cash."
[1:23:14] And um and God heard that prayer
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; and began to open up doors and send that
[1:23:20] brother cash. Uh so you know I I said
[1:23:24] when I heard that prayer
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; I said I I'm using the same prayer. Lord
[1:23:29] I need cash.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; And um but God is God is God is able. We
[1:23:36] also mentioned how, you know, there
[1:23:39] there are a couple blessings God wants
[1:23:41] you to have. One is from the upper
[1:23:44] springs and that's what brother Mark was
[1:23:47] referring to tonight. We got to have
[1:23:49] that the spiritual blessings that that's
[1:23:51] that's more important than anything
[1:23:53] else, right? We got to have that. So,
[1:23:55] but while you're living on earth, he
[1:23:57] also has blessings in the Nether Springs
[1:23:59] for you. And uh we want those, too.
[1:24:02] Amen. I want all that God got for me.
[1:24:05] Amen. and I want all that God got for
[1:24:07] me. So, uh, thank God for the nether
[1:24:09] spring blessing that our brother just
[1:24:11] received. Sister Amanda, Amen. I saw
[1:24:14] your hand up. Praise the Lord.
[1:24:18] Amen.
[1:24:21] We thank God for all things.
[1:24:27] Now, some of y'all going to go looking
[1:24:28] at your account.
[1:24:34] Amen.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. God bless you.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to try to get through this
[1:24:46] without one tear shed.
[1:24:49] Okay. I just wanted to come and give
[1:24:52] thanks to God because um as you all know
[1:24:55] not too long ago my father passed and um
[1:25:00] without giving too much detail that
[1:25:02] relationship was very strained and so
[1:25:05] with his passing it it brought about a
[1:25:07] lot of other issues for me. Um but I
[1:25:13] wanted to thank God because through
[1:25:15] everything he's been such a comfort and
[1:25:18] um you know there will be times during
[1:25:21] the day that I I um think of him for for
[1:25:24] something you know a lot of things
[1:25:26] because I grew up here. So lots of
[1:25:29] places and faces and things remind me of
[1:25:32] him and um you know instead of breaking
[1:25:36] down because of the sorrow and the loss
[1:25:39] and the sadness that comes with him
[1:25:41] leaving um I've just been able to have
[1:25:43] peace and just thank God because I know
[1:25:46] that because I love him and um he's just
[1:25:50] so precious to me. I know where he is. I
[1:25:52] know I'll see him again. And I also
[1:25:54] wanted to thank God because he gave me
[1:25:56] my wonderful husband who has been there
[1:25:59] every single time I've cried and every
[1:26:02] time I've called him and I'm like I'm at
[1:26:04] the gym and I don't want to cry and I
[1:26:06] need to talk to you. U every every time
[1:26:08] I've needed support he's been there and
[1:26:10] I just wanted to thank God for that
[1:26:12] because um that's a blessing. So, I just
[1:26:15] give praise to God and thank him
[1:26:17] [clears throat] for being there for me
[1:26:18] and being the biggest um
[1:26:22] positive thing in my life.
[1:26:28] [applause]
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Just hang right there for me one second.
[1:26:34] I I got a a prayer request and uh I want
[1:26:39] to uh
[1:26:41] uh pray over this request and it's your
[1:26:45] husband asking prayer for you. So I want
[1:26:46] to do that. All right. Amen.
[1:28:13] Praise the Lord. Amen. God is good.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Anybody else before we
[1:28:23] depart tonight? Okay. Come on, brother.
[1:28:26] Come on. Amen.
[1:28:30] Amen.
[1:28:39] Um, God bless you church. I just ask in
[1:28:42] prayer uh for brother Jeremiah. He's
[1:28:45] been uh having uh some irritation. um it
[1:28:50] seems like in his eyes. Uh but the past
[1:28:53] few days his eyes has been very swollen.
[1:28:56] Um very red. Uh today is is probably the
[1:29:00] only day that uh it's kind of gone down,
[1:29:04] but
[1:29:05] it's bothering him. You know, he looks
[1:29:08] different and we can we can tell we have
[1:29:11] an appointment with him to bring him in
[1:29:14] um for uh to his doctor tomorrow. Um, so
[1:29:17] we're trusting that, uh, whatever it is,
[1:29:20] they'll be able to, you know, find that
[1:29:22] everything's all right. But we just ask
[1:29:24] that for your prayers.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Let's anoint him with oil as well.
[1:29:29] Anybody else need prayer tonight? Amen.
[1:29:33] If you do, just come on up. We'll anoint
[1:29:35] you with oil. Amen. We'll pray over you.

[1:32:16] troubling the water
[1:32:18] and uh people got in tonight. We're
[1:32:21] expecting to hear testimonies of what
[1:32:25] God did on that Wednesday night that
[1:32:28] brother Mark preached even now he's
[1:32:30] troubling the waters. Amen. God God is
[1:32:34] good. Amen. Let us have a word of
[1:32:36] prayer. Amen. Before we dismiss, Father,
[1:32:40] we are grateful Lord for uh the word
[1:32:44] that we heard here tonight. And Lord, we
[1:32:47] even see, Lord, just results from what
[1:32:50] uh was ministered to our hearts. It
[1:32:54] wasn't by chance. It wasn't by accident
[1:32:56] that you allowed this to to happen. So,
[1:32:59] Father, we're asking that you, Lord
[1:33:01] Jesus, would get the glory from what

[1:33:08] victory in the lives of the people.
[1:33:10] Thank you for healing virtue flowing
[1:33:12] through each and every circumstance and
[1:33:14] situation knowing there is nothing too
[1:33:17] hard for you God. No matter what it is
[1:33:19] that we're facing, Lord, we're trusting
[1:33:21] you and believing you. We ask God that
[1:33:23] as we leave this place but not your
[1:33:25] presence that you would go, God uh
[1:33:28] before us and that you Lord Jesus would
[1:33:31] uh God just uh bring us back at the
[1:33:33] appointed time on uh on Sunday morning.
[1:33:36] May you meet us in a very very special
[1:33:39] way. Uh may the Holy Spirit just come,
[1:33:42] Father, and Lord just anoint us. Uh um
[1:33:45] and and Lord, just allow us, Father, to

[1:33:56] word that is spoken uh through your
[1:33:59] prophet. And we trust oh God that you
