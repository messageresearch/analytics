for his promises that they are yay and amen and that he takes care of his children especially in these times of need we have a God that we can rely on a God that we can trust in he's been our ever-present help in the time of trouble and he's always been there maybe we don't see him sometimes but he's always there amen we greet you today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we thank you for assembling yourselves together with us there in your homes and we appreciate the privilege to be able to address you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I thank the Lord for these services that are made available that we could speak to you in this manner and may God's blessings be upon each and every one of you as you are gathered there and assembled in your homes we pray his peace be upon you his life and his comfort would strengthen you in this time of need and if you feel fearful or lonely know that Jesus Christ is with you and you don't have to panic you don't have to panic because Jesus is there and I'll give you another assurance you don't have to panic because I'm still here now when I'm gone then that's the time to panic because I'm leaving near one of these morning's between the hours of 6:00 and 9:00 so we just rest assured and the promises of God this morning I bring you greetings from our pastor brother Iran he sends his love and his greetings to you and he misses you just like we all do and we certainly miss assembling ourselves together but we're praying that that day soon comes to us sooner than what is expected the president has asked for 15 days and we're definitely into that so we don't know exactly what will come of this but we definitely want to be praying that God's will be done in this we know that that out in Arkansas if it was not for this coronavirus that God had allowed that thousands maybe hundreds of thousands may have got killed in a tornado that came through that area but we know that God has everything in control and we can rest in his promises and even in these hours we can rest in his promises so we bring you greetings from him this morning and we're praying that that God would come by our way and strengthen our pastor and minister to him I love brother Matthew singing that song leaning on the everlasting arms this morning and that's where we truly are leaning I was just reminded this past week that when brother when congressman Upshaw as we are very familiar with his testimony that after he was healed been being 66 years an invalid laying there in that same condition that after he was healed he went and testified at Congress he testified to the Saints and he testified to Winston Churchill and he stood there on the White House and sung to Congress leaning on the everlasting arms sister Elena butts was was miraculously healed one morning when a service like this and in a similar manner and they were singing leaning on the everlasting arms after brother Tim Pruett got done preaching on extreme things and God came and did an extreme thing for sister Elena and we know that God is still in the business of doing extreme things and we are his people and we are strong and we will do exploits and we know that the same God that we're relying on now we can't create the same atmosphere for brother on to take off running in but we know and we're leaning on the same everlasting arms now one of these mornings he's going to take off running and there will be a change overcome his body for I believe with all of my heart that brother ons ministry is not done yet but he has many more conventions to preach until the rapture comes I'm believing with you as a body that we're going to take the rapture together and I believe it soon but I believe if God is a divine healer that God will give him divine health and so we just rely upon those things and we want to be remembering sister Nancy today yesterday her mother passed away there in Danville Genya and so it was about I believe around 9:00 or 9:30 in the morning that she passed and so we just want to be remembering sister Nancy she's the she's the last one of her immediate family that is still here on the earth and but we know that that God has a huge family that is surrounding her with with prayers and love and so we just want to be remembering her that God would comfort her in this hour of need no matter how old you are death still hurts no matter how young you are death hurt so we just pray that God would strengthen my grandmother that God would give her a peace that passes all understanding a man maybe this morning before we turn to the word we could sing that song blessed assurance Jesus is mine what a foretaste [Music] Jesus foretaste of glory divine we're of salvation purchase of God born of his spirit in watch his blood this is my story this is my song I'm crazy this is my story [Music] crazy [Music] perfect [Music] fishin some rapture now burst and possum way justice bring [Music] [Applause] yes [Music]

song I'm crazy bossy this is bosco this crazy bus [Music] we can freeze him all the day long what a blessed assurance this morning to rest and the promises of God Father we come to you this morning Lord you have surrounded us with your own father with your mercy and grace Lord was since your nearness just now father Lord for we know that in your word he told us that two or three are gathered in my name there you be father were not gathered in a way that we normally would fall we've gathered in your name and we know that you're here for know that you're ministering to his father on every single level [Music] Oh merciful God or those that are listen to this and our cough and father and pray your blessings rest upon them pay the pillar of fire that's visible may you come up make yourself known to them in such a way or as we would take your written word father we pray that you had unfailing before so we might say you face-to-face or Jesus had been sold merciful incontinence to give us the things of God or Jesus this message of the hour that has stirred our hearts to turn our faith back God would a mighty message I pray God that we whatever before study these things that you have given us and prepare our flowers from the body change we know that the corner has been turned you hear father we see the Day approaching father prayed as we would minister today pray God to you and calm in such a special way pray God that you would touch or every need every prayer request father every uplifted hand in home regard you go bother me make yourself known within liberate them father from their fears and their loneliness pray this word change their situation the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ man man god bless you if you have your Bibles this morning you can turn with us over to the book of Malachi chapter 3 and verse 6 and then also down to 2nd Peter chapter 1 and verse 16 trusting today that the Lord would speak to you in such a prolific way that you would know that it is he that is speaking to you this morning by the help of the Lord I would like to I'd like to speak to you on this thought on the power of change the power of change Malachi chapter 3 and verse 6 where I am the Lord I change not what a wonderful what a wonderful announcement to us therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them returned unto me and I will return unto you say if the Lord of hosts but you said wherein shall we return 2nd Peter chapter 1 and verse 16 for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were our witnesses of his majesty may God bless his the reading of the word you may be seated there in your your seats at home and pews here today we so appreciate the brothers and sisters that have gathered to make this service possible and give us a sense of normalcy we we've kind of joked about this just a little bit we picked out the we picked out the ten that needed it the most and here we are with the ten that needed that the most but the thing about that is I'm in that number so I guess I need it just as much as these brothers and sisters so we certainly appreciate them coming and making this service possible to give us a sense of Nohr we'll see and to be in my Amen Corner a man we'd like to speak to you by the help of the Lord on the power of change the power of change and we're certainly living in changing times we're certainly living in moments of things that have happened to us in the last few days in the last few weeks things are changing in the world and things are moving at such a fast pace it's amazing how fast things have changed for us in a matter of seconds in a matter of seconds our whole life has changed our this is not a this is not a persecution on religion but this is a shutdown of of governments this is a shutdown of places of business because of because of a sickness that is constantly spreading and the government's doing the very best way to stop these things and they don't know how to stop it they don't know how to change certain ways or they don't know scientists don't know how to bring in different things to make this thing stop but we serve a God that does not change we serve a God that knows exactly the remedy that will stop this and if there is time left for you and I on this earth then God will allow us to get over these things and we sense the effects of this change even here this morning we sense the effects of it and and how amazing how change happens in our life if we've just went through the loss of my grandma and it's amazing the effects of a change it's amazing the effects of a change when I when a child is born and when they they come in they change the way that you look at life and how you view life you get a whole new perspective on life change brings about a a beautiful way of perspective it allows you to look at things in a whole new manner it allows you to see things in a way you see God is the God he is a God that cannot change but he has a people that are born to be changed by the revealing of the son of man and we have watched as that word has went forth how it has transformed us how it has made us to be exactly what He has called us to be and we know that it is his word that is constantly and ministering to us in every level that is changing us we know that we could not change in our own it's his power of change that works upon us that that makes us to be it rolls away the snowball effect of seeing how how sin just comes and it makes us just go down that road and how it sin just continually builds up but God is a God that is continually taken away but he doesn't do it it isn't just for him that he takes it away this day or take it away a little at a time but God covers her sin and he completely annihilates that sin he's a God that changes your walk he changes your attitude he changes everything about you he's the God that is so powerful and so omnipotent he's a God is he's all-powerful he's all-knowing he's that kind of a god to us and we sense his effective change in these brothers and sisters that have gathered here we realize that God is the one that brought about this change they didn't gather here this morning just because of myself they gathered here because of a change happened in their lives they witnessed the Living God I'd say that those that are sitting here would be able to testify and you that are listening to this service if you have been touched by the master you can identify with the power of change when he came passed away when he walked past your road and he spoke and in a moment he changed your whole situation we know that even in life that roads changed the way we used to travel does not lead doesn't work that way no more cities changed politics has changed things are constantly changing year after year politics changed nations change year by year they're changing their ideas are changing their identity they're changing their agendas and they change their attitude one way one day they're this way in the next day they're not they don't know which mine they don't know which mine they want to take they either going to take the left or they're going to take the right but that's for me I want to have the mind of Christ where the Bible said let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus our Lord I don't want to have the mind of politics that's always changing I don't want to have the mind of of the Congo in the mind of a man but I want to have the mind of a God that do will not change I want to have the mind of a God that is always the same brother Branham said in 1962 the unchangeable God working in an unexpected way he said we find now that the church has changed and people's changed roads changed the scenes change the politics changed but there's one thing that does not change and that's God he remains the same he says I am God and I changed not no matter how long it is God has never changed one bit and he cannot change what a place the reason he cannot change is because he's infinite and anything that's infinite cannot change and then let us study this just for a moment before approaching on into the Scriptures infinite is infinite there's no beginning or in he's almighty omnipotent omnipresent omniscient he knows all things are places all times are powerful he is God and he cannot change now I can make a decision and say it's going to be this way and then I'm flying eyed I'll have to change because things come up that I have to say well I was wrong but God can't do that you see because his one decision is that forever he cannot change his decisions cannot change it therefore if God's attitude towards one sinner wanted to repeat Adam and Eve and God made a way for them to repent and if we gave that sinner and the next sinner comes in God has to God God has got to do the same thing to that sinner or he did wrong when he acted with the first Center and if a man was sick and God healed one man then if he ever if ever another man comes to God he's got to do the same thing or he did wrong when He healed the first one if he comes on the same ground what a resting place then for the soul that seeking refuge I say that that's where we're resting this morning we're a people that's looking for a City of Refuge we can rest in these promises that they're not changing that God if he met a sinner he'll meet a sitter now if he met one that need healing then he'll meet her he won't need a person he'll meet that person in that spot where they need healing you see in the beginning was the word and the word was spoken was a creative word in every word that spoken cannot be taken back I love that God is not taking back his promises he's giving him out to us in his magnifying those promises he cannot you see that word that spoken cannot be taken back for a mistake you see then in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us which is Christ now notice this in paragraph 53 says and now the word of God written in the Bible is his word to us now I when I read over the promises of God I consider those things to me I don't know how you read the promises of God but I consider these promises to me I read myself into that scripture that he has blessed me coming in and I put my name there that he has made me the head and not the tail and I put my name there he was speaking to the children of Israel there but Here I am in a spiritual as a spiritual Israel that these things are the promises of God and here it is written to us it is his word to us heaven and earth will pass away but this word will pass away if he promised he healed you he promised he healed you if he promised he changed you he'll change you if he promised that he would rapture you he will rapture you if he promised that he would save your prana khals he'll save your products if he promised that he would bless you coming in and bless you going out he will do that because he's God and he cannot change it's his word to us and every promise has the same power of creation behind it how beautiful that when we would look back we don't know how how many thousand years ago we look at the timing of the Bible and we know that over 6,000 years ago that God would speak those things and he would say let there be light and you would watch the material ation of that promise as it would go out God spoke it and he said let there be and it simply happened because it was God's Word and it materialized itself because it was from God and God believed his own word and the world that we live on is framed out of a word you cannot see it's a word that is circling this world it's a word that errors promises that are hanging in that word that are waiting to be dropped overtop of you if you can realize in your spot of despair this morning that there's a word that is hanging over top of you that if you could just reach out and touch the line as it were and you can reach out that those promises will drop upon you those promises can't change if God said let there be and it happened it has to be the same way with you God cannot change it is his word to us it is his love to us it's got the same power of creation behind it you watches that word as it goes across your loved one you prayed and you pray the prayer of faith over them you took the promises of God in Acts chapter 19 and you took those prayer cloths and you laid it under your loved ones bed and you watch them as they came in and fill the pew out you see that was a promise your faith was not necessarily it was not necessarily in the material of the prayer cloth but it was in getting the promise of God you see just like when Peter was walking down the road and his shadow crossed him and those that are were laying there and they were crippled and they were maimed and had all kinds of needs in their body it was not the shadow itself but it was the faith of Almighty God that was on the inside of Peter that if the same God could change Peter he can change my mortal body he can resurrect me in a form of of the flesh and he can make me whole he's that kind of a God you see it's not a need the material your promise your faith is not in the literal the pages or the material of the pages but it's in the promise that is on the pages these are promises of God that have become to pass in our life and we have watched them as God as we look and we'd see the darkness upon the face for the deep and then God said let there be light and light came and it drove the darkness away it was that thought it was that God that spoke those things and it's got the same power behind it that's God's Word he did it at the beginning if we believe it to be the Word of God it depends on where the seed falls you see if it falls into a ground if it falls into a ground that can create a moisture or a nurse when around the promise of God will bring forth every promise the Bible made Wow the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of God will bring its plows we've spoke those things for years you've heard these things that's message believers for years but it ain't change if you have the same mental attitude that you had when you got saved if you can have the same mental attitude about the promise that it will bring it to pass God's attitude ain't change so why should our attitude change towards the promises just because you get deeper in the valley should not change the way we look at God's Word you see you can't rely upon what you see you've got to rely upon what God said right mental attitude towards any divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you just look at it and take care of the word just right because the infinite God spoke it it's God's Word the Bible says in Psalms 102 and 24 I said oh my god take me not away in the midst of my days my ears are throughout all generations of all now has laid the foundations of the earth and the heavens are the work of the hands notice these things these are the works of God they shall perish but thou shall endure all of them sell alcohol laughs old like a garment as a vesture shalt change them and they shall be changed you look at this mortal body as it get older you see gray hair slipping in you see teeth starting to slip out you see glasses that you didn't used to need now you need them you're watching a changin over your body you're watching you see this earth as you watch an older person as they'll begin to stoop over you see gravity is calling them back to the ground it's calling them back you see it's a changin this body is changing when you were from the age of 0 to 21 you became strong but from that point you started to die off but one of these morning's one of these mornings they'll speak such a change come over you that it'll resurrect he won't replace but in a resurrect that body these things will change but God will not change you think about that God is a God that cannot change but he's so mould you and I to his promises that he does not break us and he does not make us weak but he wraps us around him that we become stronger in the promises of God there's trials that come there's storms that come but they don't not make us as Christians grow away from God they make us lean on his everlasting arms verse 27 but how are the same and thy years shall have no end the children of the servants shall continue and their seed shall be established before thee whoo there's not gonna be one that don't make it that he is already established if he establish you before the foundation of the world you're coming it may not look like you're coming and you may not feel like you're going to change but if your hears you will change people get stuck in their own way to get stubborn in their own ways as hell my momma did this and I gonna do it but my daddy did this or my daddy did that and I'm gonna do it you see when God looks your way there is nothing going to stop you from coming to the master you can try to hide but God's already got your hiding place already figured out well prophet said in what you think of Christ what what think of Christ when God has once said anything it will remain forever can I be altered you know I Kings word is not altered you know that like in a nation the nation that's controlled by a king it's not politics to play there the king is said so and it might be carried out must be carried out that Saturdays and when God speaks it must be carried out there's no alternative there's no playing of politics it's got to be taken out just exactly the way he's headed for if once spoken it's established forever in glory so when we read his word its eternal and will never cease to exist I believe his word with all of my heart all my soul all my life all that I am I just hang on to this word that's right I believe it forever the truth you see God has given us a world that has spoken we have received a word that has been given and now we watch the transformation of a life you see the Holy Spirit is the one that has changed you when you look at brother Donnie Nichols in his daddy prayed and his mama prayed for him all those years and he watched as it came down to a source he came down to a spot that God brought about such a prolific change that brother Donnie was no longer the same man as he was before God knows what he's doing when I look upon you and I pray for you I think about the change that has happened in your life those things are the Holy Spirit's working in your life we were just being testified this week and being brother out and we're working with a man very close to us they're near our home and he began to testify to us of a young man that goes to this church service that he used to be real tight without no world and he said one day he said we were tight one day and the next day he come back completely changed he said we use the word weird he said because he changed you see we look weird to the rest of the world we look weird to the rest of the world but gods changed comes upon us and it so changes us that we no longer think the same thing we never looked the same thing we don't act the same way that's the power of his change because he's God now the Bible says in Ezekiel 36 and 24 for I will take you from among the heathen gather you out of all the countries and I will bring you into your own land then I will sprinkle you clean water will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit when I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh you see here this next verse in 27 here is the change here is the message that how I will put my spirit within you this is the age of the personal life of Jesus Christ you hear these things in crisis the mystery of God revealed that these things have come and so changed us it's his spirit on the inside of you I look upon you and I see the change of Almighty God and I look out upon it and I'm not missing the big picture here things are changing around us my lifes are changing our bodies are changing but I'm not missing the big picture God is preparing you for a body change God is preparing us as a body of Jesus Christ to be lifted up one of these days and it all began because I put my spirit within you I made a deposit and if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will it's abiding it's staying there it's not leaving as it would leave the Prophet David when David was a man that was built after God's own heart he was a man that knew how to repair it was a man that knew how to worship but the prophets the Prophet would tell us that the anointing would come and the anointing will leave but Christ is not leaving you since the dispensation of the Holy Ghost has been poured out upon you his people he's abiding there he's staying there he's the one that's bringing about these mighty changes and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in love that God is the one that starts to work and he begins to make all the prophecy roll into existence and I will cause you to walk in my statutes I've had young people come to me and ask me brother Andrew how will I do it how will I do it I've tried this I've tried that you see once he puts his spirit on me inside of you he will cause you to walk this way we're not walking the way of Cain or Korah we're walking the way of Almighty God we're going up the Kings Highway and I promise you I say to you and I demolish you if you're not walking why don't you start while I'm talking walking up the Kings Highway hey he's the one that will cause you to walk in his statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers and ye shall be my people and I will be your God what a promise that we are to dwell in the land of the Pentecostal fathers we're dwelling in the land of the message of the hour these things are to us these things are promised to us and here we are inhabiting the promises of God you see we were born to be in the image of God to bear his limits to be like him but brother random would say the power of transformation that as you look out on a cornfield you look out there and you see those old creepers how that they'll come up and those creepers will reach around that corn stalk and wanted to do a creeper will grab and it's trying to twist explain that corn stalk and bring it down he said that Satan cannot create so Satan deforms and Satan perverts and perverts means to bring about a change to change over to change over to make a change and Satan knows that he cannot create so he reaches around your life as you begin to get closer to God and walk closer to God that he begins to come in with the creeping and he starts wrapping himself surrounds you and he starts robbing you of all of the nutrients that you need to be strong in the Lord but what brother Bantam told us is that a farmer had to go out there and chop that creeper out and that's what this word does it's a short - is it sword and it cuts going and coming and this word as you have noticed on your life that it sometimes hurts your feelings sometimes it hurts the way you act or the way that you would do normally but it's chopping off the creeping of the deforming of Satan off of your eyes those things that we don't have or we don't like to preach because we know that it's going to cause a change on somebody there's some times that you don't feel like or you may not want to preach because you know you know it's gonna hurt somebody but I would rather hurt your feelings now than they hurt your feelings later there's sometimes it's not necessarily easy to preach these things but I get behind it with everything that I am I'm not bashful about preaching and I'm bold for about it because it's my job as a duty as a pastor of this church to preach to you the things of God and I will not be guilty of your blood being upon my hands I will stand on the save the Lord no what comes no matter what goes these things are true I've gave my whole life up to do it and I'm not willing to lose one of you I'm not willing for it to allow the creeping of the deformation of Satan to slip into your life and to rob you of the nutrients of your joy and your peace and your health it's my duty as a son of God to chop those things off of your life that's why we get behind this pulpit that's why we get behind this word and we say God it's not me that's gonna do the work because if I do the work then man will fall but if you do the work God if you're the one that will not change and I send that word out and that word is received it'll start cutting down the deformation of Satan and Satan loose its grip on your life but there's a power there's a power that'll keep you there's a power that will anoint you there's a power that will change you there's a power that's greater than the creeper called Satan he loves to slip his way on the inside of your life he loves to come in and slip in with maybe different things that you're dealing with and he slips in with music where he slips him with this habit or slipped him if that happen it says well he does like as they did at the beginning hath not God said and he stuck footing in one word one word at a time and before long you're believing a lot but I have good news to you children there's a power that greater than the pervert or Satan there's a power that's greater than your sin there's a power that's greater than your sickness there's a power that's greater than the creeper of sin and that is Almighty God and you're sitting here that have witnessed the power of the Holy Ghost and you're a witness to the things that God has done you have experienced and living the heart and a true experience of a true Christian is a reality but it never can be known and felt without the Spirit of God troubles comes storms of trouble and he looks at tempest in the face he says I know that all things work together for the good his children die the partner of his bosom is carried to the grief he said the Lord God gives and the Lord God takes away blessed be the name of the Lord his farm may fail his crop is blighted his business prospects are clouded you see him approaching at the last dark valley of the shadow of death and you hear that man cry yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil thy rod and my staff they comfort me and thou thyself are with me I ask you what makes this man calm in the midst of all these various trials and personal troubles if it be not the Spirit of God but look at the Christian in his joyous moments he is rich God has given him all his heart's desire on earth mark that man he has plenty of room for pleasures in this world but he drinks out of a higher sister his pleasure Springs from things unseen his happiest moments are when he can shut all these good things out and when he can come to God as a poor guilty sinner and come to Christ and enter into the fellowship with him and rise into nearness of access and confidence and bowed approach to the throne of heavenly grace it is only the working of the holy spirit working on the inside of a human being that can make you act and live and pursue a life of this manner that when you even walk through the valley of the shadow of death you'll say I'll fear no evil when you're all alone you know he's there only the power the Holy Ghost can reaffirm these things I've dealt with people that are dealing with so much fear they don't know and they're dealing with so makes anxiety and I wonder it makes you reach out into your soul I say am I really born again because if you are in a mist of panic it shows you that there's something wrong on the inside you say well brother Andrew what are you gonna do if you get diagnosed with the Kuro device I'm going to do the same thing if I get diagnosed with cancer I'm going to believe his promise and I believe this promise is true no matter what comes I still believe God's promises to be true he's a God that heals only the changing power of Almighty God can make a man walk according to his word when you look at Elijah and Elijah when Elijah was out walking and looking for a successor to come after his ministry for Elijah knew that he was coming down to the closing hours of his ministry and there was Elijah out out of plowing with those with his oxen and he was out there and Elijah watched him that he was faithful in what he was doing he was faithful in keeping a plough straight in on the narrow path there was nobody else watching him but Elijah held true to what his belief was no matter if somebody was around or no matter somebody was looking he didn't know Elijah was come looking for him but he was still doing what was right and Elijah Luke told him their lives and looked on Elijah and he walked over to him and he threw his mana over on him he did not look to see to see if Elijah fit the robe he made come on somebody he made Elijah to fit the rope he didn't trim his robe down to make it fit Elijah he made Elijah to fit the robe you see the working of the Holy Ghost does not change his word to fit you he changes you to fit his word God ain't changing how it does business he ain't changing how he asks he's not changing how he does things he has working on the inside of you and he's trimming off things in your life to make you fit in line with the Word of God he alters us he does not alter his word he's a god that does not change he's a saying yesterday today and forever God didn't die God still alive he's the one that is perfecting us he's the one that is bringing about the change he's the one that's doing these things he's asked us to be perfect even as our Heavenly Father in heaven is perfect there's no way in your own righteousness brother Jeff that you can make yourself perfect but he made a way of appropriation so that you can be perfect he looked upon you in such a way that you would be able to say like brother William Bulevar preached a few weeks ago mama that's me he has sent His Word to sow cultivates her life and change her life that you can look in the mirror of God's Word and you would say Papa I see what you asked me to be I see what you want me to be and I'm fitting hallelujah it's not a pastor that did that it's Lord that came that made you fit what he's asked and required in this moment and in this change in this challenge of the hour it's God's Word that made you live this way my brand-ne home my Papa Charlie my dad didn't come and knock me on the head and make me believe these things God came and got ahold of my life God changed my life if I'm not forced to live this way I love to live this way he's the God that brought about change as the poet said where God begins his gracious work that work he will complete for around the objects of his love our power and mercy meet man may repent of his hire him hum of his work and I'll fail and fail in his attempt but God is above the power of change he never can repent each object of his love is sure to reach the heavenly goal for neither sin or Satan can destroy the blood washed soul Oh glory to God when Elijah when he walked all the way through and he walked all the way with Elijah and he told him to turn back and Elijah said I'm not gonna leave him I'm going with you all the way that's the way we as the bride of Jesus Christ we're saying you're worth following you you're our headship you have made us her body and we're following you all the way no matter what comes no matter what goes we're following you something brought about this change and Elijah Elijah said I'll follow you where you go and Elijah as he walked past the school of prophets in the school of Prophet said do you not know do you not know that the prophets gonna leave you this day but that did not change eyelashes it did not change his testimony he said I'm going all the way I love that that because just because the rest of the world has criticized us for walking this way we do not change just because the critics or the school of theologians have told us that this way is a dying way they don't realize what's on the other side of Jordan I know what's on the other side I've tasted and seeing what the Lord has done hallelujah hallelujah and elastic goes all the way and he watched his predecessor Elijah as he comes down to Jordan and he smites the Jordan River and he walks across and Alaska asked for a double portion when a large ask what will you ask that I give you and he said I ask of a double portion of your spirit he said you've asked a hard thing but if you see me when I go you shall have what you asked for Oh Church of the Living God we've seen him we've watched him we've watched him as he's gathered us on the chariots of his word and he lifted us from the to the Creed's and the dogmas of this world we've in a puff we risen above all the stigmas and the complexes of this world of Laodicea we've rose to the challenge we've seen God say what he said he would do and we watched him do it people have come too late to tell me my god stare I've watched him in action I've watched him bring babies to barren wombs I've watched him raise the dead I watched him save the Lost I watched him feel those that needed the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's the same God Roger goes across and the Chariots of Fire come down and they grab the servant of Elijah and the mantle drops back down upon Elijah's holders and Elijah is now at a showdown the rest of the school of the prophets are on the other side watching what a loss is gonna do and Elijah took the mantle he had the mantle of Elijah but where was the god of Elijah and he grabbed the mantle of Elijah and he smote the waters and said where be the god of Elijah and the god of Elijah showed up because he realized the power of the God of Elijah and he walked across on dry land what about you Church of the Living God these things were to you where be your God of Elijah will be your God he ain't change don't change your attitude towards the promised change don't change don't change the way you look at it change your mind to see what God says God ain't changed here he change his attitude he ain't change the way he thought about you I love cuz there's a lot of times that we as Christians we just don't feel like Christians but I think the good Lord that this ain't upon feelings but this is a poem at baptism of the Holy Ghost no matter whether I'm up no matter whether I'm down he's still there he's still living he's not changing hallelujah the Prophet said in confirmation and evidence when a man buys a car he must have a deed to that car and though he has not the car sitting in his garage if he has indeed it's a confirmation to him that he owns that car because he has a deed or the title and then if we bought a piece of ground though we have never seen the ground know nothing about the ground and yet we have an abstract to that deed to abstract deed to the ground it belongs to us whether we have seen it or not it still belongs to us the car belongs to us whether we have seen it or not yet we have the title given to us and we hold it in our possession in our name that the title shows us that we owned that car it's the abstract title deed that tells us that we own the property who there's a lot of things that you don't see but the deed tells you that it's your property for when the Bible says in Hebrews 6 and 13 that when God who when God made a promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verily swear by the greater and oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife that means it's up for no it's no more argument about it it's a confirmation it's an oath of confirmation 417 wherein God willing more abundantly to show under the heirs of promise the inability of his counsel he confirmed it by oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie that we might have a strong consolation we as the people of God can have a strong consolation we can rely upon this God he swore by himself he swore by himself when he could swear by no one else he swore by himself and in this day we look over revelations ten and five and we see him with his foot on a land at sea and we see his hand raised and it's a sworn affidavit to you hallelujah for in the days of the voice of the seventh angel he has sounded to us a message that will change our mortal bodies he swore by himself I'll take God's Word I'll take it all the way through sickness I take it all the way through storms I take it all the way through trials hallelujah if Abraham who believed when it looked like there was no hope he believed he believed in hope and he considered not his own body being dead he believed in the promises of God all the odds of God was sad all the odds of everybody around him were stacked up against him but that did not change God's plan you see God had been testing the patriarch because he had given him a promise this is where you find out whether you really trust is when you put to the test and brother Branham said that the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you whew we enjoy reading those things on the back side of those things but it's the greatest thing you see the test really shows what you are you see we would have never known of the faith of Abraham and had not been tested but when it was put to the test he was then used like never before you see when God makes a promise he wants to be sure that this person is worthy of the promise before he fulfills what he said or what he promises you see every time God makes the Covenant with a man man can't keep that covenant man breaks that covenant just like when Adam broke it every time he made a covenant Israel he made it coming in with Israel and Israel broke that covenant but God was so determined to save his people that he made a covenant he was determined to save man I so he made an unconditional covenant and he swore by himself he swore by himself not half of the man to do anything to do with it he swore by himself and all of these things were accomplished in our Lord Jesus Christ and don't matter what your flesh is going through the promise still relies the same he made the promise to you as people he's the one that will bring about the change he said that he will perfect you he will perfect you he said that he would perform his word he will perform his word the deed tells us that he will do it the Bible tells us he done will do it the reason we believe this message is because the Bible said it would be here the reason why we believe in healing is because the Bible said it would be here the reason why we believe in a rapture is because the Bible tells us there be a rapture everything else is sifting ideas of man's ideas and changing but God's Word don't change if we could just change our attitude to change our attitude to match the attitude of the promise hello it's forever settled with God that he's the Lord our God that'll heal all your diseases he told us to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he don't matter on how you feel the Word of God is superior to your feelings your feelings may never come hear me your feelings may never come but healing will our expectations are in healing it is not in feeling our expectations is in the promises of God not the promises of man doctors have told us that there are years in front of us but God has told us that there is an everlasting covenant that is in front of us our expectation is not what the doctor sees our expectation he's in what God sees we can expect to do we can expect God to do what he spoke because he's God and it's our duty to trust in God and act upon God's Word he's the one that'll change the situation you see it's always in the natural where God has asked us to trust him and it's our obedience that brings about the promises of God it's our faith in the promises of God that bring about the change you see God tells his children what to do and then he does it he performs it he said that he would bring about a change he'll bring about a change he said he bring about a work he'll bring about a work he said he bring a he would be a miracle worker he's a miracle worker he said he's a promise keeper he's a promise keeper he said he's a wave maker he's a wave maker even when you don't see him working he's working when you don't see him in your home is there when you don't see him in your body he's there when your body seems weak is still there for when you are weak then you are made strong hallelujah he's a God that you can trust in it's in the things of the natural where God brings about the supernatural and I say to you that God's got this yes you know what to trust him and to build an ark when everybody else around him was making fun of it Noah built the ark and God flooded the earth he was only-- Noah's job to build the Ark not to make it rain he told Moses to stretch out the rod and God parted the waters he told Joshua and March around the law seven times and then on the seventh day my surrounded seven times Joshua did what the angel asked him to do and God brought the walls down there are things in your life that God has required you to do but God brings about the change molasses Roos sticking the water and God made the iron swim he told name in the dip seven times naman dip seven times and God healed him of leprosy he told us in mark 16 and he's told every believer this to go in all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he there believeth that's your depart that's all part Moses had a part Joshua had a part naman had a part this is your part he that believeth in his baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe that's God's pork that's God's part all you got to do believe and these signs will follow them that believe in my name that's to every believer Moses believe what about you Joshua believe for what about you that Allu you Hanna believe what what about you in my name in my name the science of all of them they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing hallelujah it shall not hurt them they say lay hands on the sick and they shall they shall I'd say that in your home they shall recover they shall recover they shall recover they shall recover these are the promises of God and they changed not hallelujah it's our job to believe it's his job to bring it to pass he told us to believe in him that's what believers to he'll bring about it he'll bring it into this coronavirus they'll bring it into this cancer and they'll bring it into this world and we're gonna be found trusting in him and believing in him because he's God hallelujah now we're not out here tempting God saying God if your God miraculously heal this miraculously do this we're not out here tempting God handling a bunch of snakes either I believe when you do something stupid like that you're tempting God forgive me miss Timothy Brewer would say you know why they do that cuz it's stupid but we're not out here tempting God saying God if you're going to do this you'll do it in me and if it's me if it ain't if you don't do it it's because my faith is weak I absolutely do not believe that but I believe that if God lays it upon my heart to lay hands upon the one that God will do the work that he said to that if I am walking through the woods and a rattlesnake spit bites me just like happy with brother branham and brother banks woods when they were out there in the bush and that granel snake bit him are you with me and that thing transpired he was not doing that to tempt God he was doing that by a commandment of God's word that if any deadly thing hurt him they should take up serpents and it will not harm them that's a God that you serve I believe with all of my heart that if you get sick that you will get healed if you take his promise the doctor asks you to take your blood pressure medicine and you take it because you trust what the doctor said if you can trust the doctor to say what he said to what about the promises of God I can tell you the doctor can tell you to take your vitamins but you got to be the one to swallow them babies I can tell you all the promises of God I can tell you that they're true I can tell you they gotta back it up but if you don't swallow it down and let it go to war on the inside of your belly eat the whole book if you don't do it he won't bring about a change but watch as you begin to swallow the message of the hour how it changes the way you look at the world it's God that brings about the supernatural James says verse 5 chapter 5 and 14 is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let him pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord notice this is your part and the prayer of faith shall save the sick now this is God's part and the Lord shall raise him up hallelujah you see there is power in yourself to bring about a change if you believe God God will do his part and if he committed any sins they shall be forgiven him blind eye dumb tongue cold heart I believe that God is able to change him all God's attitudes towards the promise is that by His stripes we are healed and our attitude towards him is that God you suffered for us so that we don't have to suffer the Bible tells us in Hebrews 12 and 29 that our God is a consuming fire and the Bible tells us in Isaiah 33 and 14 the sinners in Zion are free that seems like a lot of the chaos of the world right now the sinners in Zion are afraid fearfulness has surprised the hypocrites who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire who among us said well of the everlasting burnings he that walketh righteously and speaketh uprightly he that despises the gain of oppressions that speaketh in his hands from the holding of bronze and that stoppeth his ears from hearing a blood and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil he shall dwell on high his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks bread shall be given him his water shall be sure when everything else is changing you are here in the munitions of rocks you are in a Fortress of the revelation of Almighty God your fortified behind that word behind the revelation of the Word of God where Christ built his church not upon himself not upon Peter but upon the revelation of God's Word he built his church and your head behind that your head behind that fortress and there can't be nothing break through that there can't be nothing break through that revelation for jesus said that heaven and earth will pass away but this word will pass away and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against this revelation if we're potatoes of the divine nature were partakers of the divine power of Almighty God who shall be able to dwell amongst the devouring fire first Peter 1 and 15 but as he which hath called you is holy so behold in all manner of conversation because it is written be holy for I am holy and if you call him the father who without respect a person judges according to every man's work past the time of your sojourning here in fear for as much as you know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot those that are the people those are the people that this fire it will drive out sin but that fire comes on the inside of you and will not hurt you it's a devouring flower here to drive out unbelief it'll drive out stigmas it'll drive out fear but the fire of God will not hurt you it'll consume all your sin but it will not consume your life but it'll make you long it is Christ that it's the one that bore your sins that boy your diseases that bore your faults that bore all your infirmities so you can start claiming all the blessings of God and you can start confessing by faith that God is a God of his word and to confess is to say the same thing there may be times when you don't feel like what the promise is but you confess what the Bible said you confess what the promise said Jesus Christ suffered for you Jesus Christ took upon himself all the consequences of your sin he to become Lord of our he will be the Lord that brings the promise to pass he will not be your work to bring sit the pass it's God that does it it will not be the doctors medicine that heals brother on he will be glad that did it for God is a healer no doctor is a healer God's a healer a doctor can aid and doctor can send but God's a healer and we take God at His Word Tom would fail me to tell of all the miracles that I've seen with my eyes that I've seen miraculously things happen in front of my eyes but the greatest is a transformation of a life I got very dear friends that are sitting in this building that are setting in streaming in their homes assembling themselves but to watch that transformation is the greatest that I could ever have Justin see to see young people my brother had a man sister Julia we so completely changed to see a lady like sister Karli be so completely changed to watch one of my bosom friends brother Jeffrey Thomas be so completely changed to watch the changing of God come we spoke on that angel working in the water it was a time to step in it was the angel that brought about the change it was not the water it was not a man that brought about the change in these young people's lives it was God's Word it's been worth it all to watch the change in every one of your lives you can call your name there because I'll forget but God won't forget he watched you change he watched you become the person that you are but to watch that transformation what would he we would hear a prophet come and when he preached on God's power to transform and the transforming power of God we've witnessed that as a church Tom would fail me to tell you the miracles that I've seen the visible the visible things but it's been God's power behind it all that brought about the change it's been God's Word that brought about the change there's been times when we've stood here at this pulpit we've seen the angel of the Lord spend right there we've seen the pillar fire slip over somebody that was sitting right there and we watched God bring about a change in their life that you as a human being were watching waiting just waiting for the change and all you knew to do was keep praying keep believing but when he came when he came he brought about the change unless just like sister sister Esther sister Elena Bunce with brother Ron Spencer with all the promises of God that we've testified about the promises were still true just like was sister Karen Pruett the promises were still true it didn't change the promise but when the angel came he brought about the change and I say to you that there's a healing angel in the land that's going about he was going by the way of Georgia Carter one time and had brought a little girl that had been in that condition for so many years and when the angel said go by the way of the chorus and then he brought about the change I'd say that that same angel is passing by the way of the brown of Jesus Christ hands are being healed cancers are being set free babies are coming miracles are coming because he said that he would do these things we're not hanging on a man's word were hanging on God's Word God said he would do it you might call us stupid so we'll just say it like you we're just stupid enough to believe it we believe that God will do the supernatural as I try to bring this to a close this morning the Bible says in Luke chapter 10 verse 18 and he said unto them and I beheld Satan as lightning falling from heaven verse 19 behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents we literally did that not even a year ago brother Jeffrey but I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because her names are written in heaven we don't rejoice because we that the demon powers are under
