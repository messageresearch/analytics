[26:31] victory. [singing]
[26:35] Oh, victory
[26:37] in Jesus
[26:40] my [music]

[26:54] He loved me.
[26:57] I knew him and all [singing] my love
[27:01] [music]
[27:02] is to him.
[27:04] He plunged me to [music and singing]
[27:07] victory.
[27:11] I love this verse. How many's looking
[27:13] forward [music] to your mansion? I heard
[27:15] about
[27:17] my mansion.
[27:19] He is built for me [singing and music]
[27:22] in glory.
[27:24] And I heard about
[27:29] the [music]
[27:30] [singing]
[27:31] crystal sea
[27:34] about [music]
[27:35] the angels
[27:39] and [singing] the old redemption
[27:41] soul

[29:52] It ain't looking good. Ain't going to
[29:54] lie. Arrows flying, levels trying. Make
[29:58] me [music] think I'm going [singing]
[29:59] down this time. You might think that I'd
[30:02] be afraid. Running scared with a shaking
[30:05] face, but the God I know says it ain't
[30:07] over. God I know [music and singing] is
[30:09] going to make way.

[31:02] &gt;&gt; no fear,
[31:04] &gt;&gt; no fear, [singing]
[31:05] &gt;&gt; no fear,
[31:07] &gt;&gt; no fear. The mighty power of Jesus is
[31:11] fighting for [singing] me here.

[32:09] [music and singing]
[32:10] not over my life.
[32:13] God's over my life.
[32:16] Yay. [singing and music]
[32:18] Though I walk
[32:21] through the valley, [music and singing]

[32:29] no fear.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; No fear. The mighty power of Jesus is

[32:57] No [singing] fear. Not over my life. Not
[33:00] over my life. Not over my life.
[33:02] [singing and music] No fear. Not over my
[33:04] life. Not over my life. Not over my
[33:07] life.
[33:09] [singing] No fear.
[33:11] [music]
[33:15] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[34:07] &gt;&gt; One night while on life's raging sea, it
[34:13] looked [music] as if I was suffering.
[34:16] [singing]
[34:17] As a [music] blackness of night, it
[34:20] closed off the line. My heart sank with
[34:24] fear. [singing]
[34:27] [music]
[34:27] And my desperate cry rang out with
[34:31] pride. And all I could [singing] see
[34:34] [music] was hope inside. With my faith
[34:38] all [singing] but gone, I met that one
[34:41] [music] who came looking for me.
[34:46] He [music] came looking for me.
[34:51] He came [music and singing]
[34:52] looking for me
[34:57] and he made [music and singing] a way
[34:59] where there was no way that
[35:02] [music and singing] I could see.
[35:06] And when I drifted far, yes, Jesus was
[35:10] near. [music] He rescued my soul
[35:13] [singing] and he calmed all my fears.
[35:16] Now [music] save from my heart. Since I
[35:19] met that one, he came looking for me.
[35:24] [singing and music]
[35:26] Oh, Satan had already picked out my
[35:30] grave. His plan had moved forward to
[35:34] [music and singing] put me away. I
[35:36] drifted so far. Would anyone
[35:39] [music and singing]
[35:39] care and I soon be lost?
[35:44] [music]
[35:45] Well, I knew my destruction was a matter
[35:49] of time, but Jesus appeared. [music]
[35:52] He said, "This was mine. Now I'm saved
[35:56] from [singing] my heart." For he walked
[35:58] through that storm when he came looking
[36:00] [music and singing] for me.
[36:04] He came looking for [music] me.
[36:09] He came looking [singing] for me.
[36:12] [music]
[36:14] And he made a way where there was
[36:17] [music and singing] no way that I could
[36:20] see.
[36:24] And [music] when I drifted far, yes,
[36:27] Jesus was near. He rescued my soul and
[36:31] [singing] he calmed [music] all my
[36:33] fears. Now save from my heart. Since I
[36:37] met that one, he came looking for me.
[36:42] [music]
[36:43] Now, Satan had already picked out my
[36:47] [music] grave and plan [singing] and
[36:49] move forward. He was putting [music] me
[36:52] away. I drifted so far, [singing]
[36:56] but anyone can
[36:59] still be [music] lost.
[37:02] Well, I knew my destruction was a matter
[37:06] of time. [music] Then Jesus appeared. He
[37:10] said, "This was mine." Now I'm safe
[37:13] [music and singing] from my heart. Free
[37:15] walked through that storm when he came
[37:18] looking for [music] me.
[37:22] He came looking for me.
[37:26] [music] He came [singing] looking for me
[37:31] [music] and he made a way. But there was
[37:35] no way that I could see. [music]
[37:41] And when I drifted far, yes, Jesus was
[37:45] here, [music]
[37:46] he rescued my soul [singing] and he
[37:49] calmed all my fears. And I'll say it
[37:52] from my heart. Since I [music] met that
[37:54] one, he came looking for me.
[37:59] [music]
[38:00] And [singing] when I drifted far, yes,
[38:03] Jesus was near. [music]
[38:05] He rescued my soul. Yes, he calmed all
[38:09] my fears. Now [music] save from
[38:11] [singing]
[38:12] cuz I met that one. He came looking for
[38:16] me.
[38:24] [applause]
[38:27] Aren't you glad he came looking for you?
[38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not only that, he grabbed a hold
[38:31] of your hand. He's been walking with you
[38:32] ever since. And now there's no fear.
[38:34] Amen. Let's all stand. Invite Brother
[38:36] Andrew. Amen. Thankful for the songs

[43:30] understand. [music]
[43:34] Oh, cover me. [singing]
[43:39] Oh, cover me,
[43:43] Father. [music]
[43:44] Lord, truly that is our desire is that
[43:47] the Holy Spirit would cover us, Lord
[43:50] Jesus. Lord, that you would be the
[43:52] atonement over our lives and that that
[43:55] peace that passes all understanding.
[43:57] [music]
[43:58] Lord, you would hide us in the shadow of
[44:00] the Almighty. Lord, we would ask Lord
[44:03] God, today that [music] you would come,
[44:05] Lord. We are a needy people. And what a
[44:08] privilege it is for us as your children
[44:09] to call upon the God of heaven, Lord, to
[44:12] realize how close that you've been this
[44:14] past week, Lord. to see you working
[44:17] through every situation. [music]
[44:19] Problems that have arisen, Father,
[44:21] circumstances that seem to not go away.
[44:24] Lord, you have been right there all that
[44:26] time. Father, we thank you for your
[44:29] mercies that are new every morning.
[44:31] Lord, we thank you for your presence
[44:33] that we feel in [music] this place.
[44:34] Lord, we're so thankful that we have the
[44:36] ability to be able to echo out [music]
[44:39] the praises of the most high God. And we
[44:42] ask, Lord Jesus, that our praise that
[44:44] has went forth to you, that it would be
[44:46] pleasing to you, Father, that it would
[44:48] go up as a sweet savor, an incense to
[44:51] the most high, and that you would allow
[44:53] your Holy Spirit to come and reside over
[44:56] your children tonight. Lord, we desire,
[44:58] Lord, to have fellowship with the
[45:00] master. Lord, to walk in the cool of the
[45:03] evening time, [music] Lord, there's
[45:04] something special about an evening
[45:06] service. Lord, it's when you would come
[45:09] down and you would walk with your
[45:10] children. And Father, if we could just
[45:12] realize it's that kind of an atmosphere
[45:14] in this place tonight that you would
[45:16] want to walk through the garden of your
[45:18] word and minister to your children.
[45:20] Father, I pray, Lord. Lord, I would like
[45:23] to be like Adam and Eve tonight and just
[45:26] maybe hook my arm over in your arm. Just
[45:28] begin to walk through the word, Lord,
[45:30] and let the people realize that it's not
[45:33] a man, [music] it's not me. I have
[45:35] nothing to do with this really. I'm just
[45:37] a microphone. But I pray Lord for those
[45:39] that may doubt. I pray that you would
[45:41] give them inspiration to believe. Lord,
[45:44] I pray for those that would question. I
[45:46] pray that you would just answer the very
[45:48] things that upon their [music] life. For
[45:50] every situation here, we invite the
[45:53] Lord, the Lord to come and take control.
[45:57] We humble ourselves in your presence
[45:59] just now. We pray God for your word to
[46:01] be blessings to our body. Lord, as we
[46:04] will receive it unto our soul, Lord, may
[46:07] it give us strength to go through life's
[46:09] journey. Father, we love you so much. We
[46:12] thank you for your presence that we
[46:13] feel. [music]
[46:14] We invite you to come and break the word
[46:17] just now in Jesus name. Amen. [music]
[46:20] And amen. If you have your Bibles this
[46:22] evening, we'd like to look over in the
[46:24] book of Joshua chapter 2 and John 11
[46:28] verse1 17.
[46:31] Man,
[46:52] [clears throat]
[46:56] Joshua chapter 2 and verse one and
[47:00] Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shidam
[47:04] two men to spy secretly. It's always
[47:07] amazing to me that he didn't send out 12
[47:09] like Moses did.
[47:12] He sent out two
[47:14] because two was the ones that came back
[47:16] with a true report.
[47:19] Two men to spy out secretly saying, "Go
[47:23] view the land, even Jericho." And they
[47:26] went and came into a harlot's house
[47:28] named Rahab and lodged there. John 11
[47:33] and verse 17.
[47:41] Say amen when you have it this evening.
[47:45] Then when Jesus came,
[47:48] he found that he had lain in the grave
[47:50] four days already.
[47:53] Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem
[47:56] about four or 15 furongs off. Many of
[47:59] the Jews came to Martha and Mary to
[48:01] comfort them concerning their brother.
[48:04] Then Martha as soon as she heard that
[48:06] Jesus was coming went and met him. But
[48:11] Mary sat still in the house. I believe
[48:15] that's a way a lot of people do
[48:18] &gt;&gt; when they know that Jesus is coming.
[48:20] They're still sitting in the house. Come
[48:22] on, buddy.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; There's a lot we could say right there.
[48:26] Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if
[48:29] thou had us been here, my brother had
[48:32] not died.
[48:34] But I know
[48:36] But I know
[48:38] that even now,
[48:42] &gt;&gt; whatsoever thou will ask God, God will
[48:44] give it thee. Notice she never lost her
[48:48] faith.
[48:50] She had went through the trial of her
[48:52] life, but she had not lost her faith in
[48:54] him.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; But I know that even now that whatsoever
[48:57] thou will ask God, God will give it
[48:59] thee. And Jesus saith unto her, "Thy
[49:02] brother shall rise again." Woo, that's
[49:06] powerful. Martha said unto him, I know
[49:10] that he shall rise again in the
[49:11] resurrection at the last day. And Jesus
[49:13] said unto her, I am
[49:16] &gt;&gt; woohoo. I am the resurrection and the
[49:18] life. And he that believeth in me,
[49:21] though he were dead, yet shall he live.
[49:23] And whosoever liveth and believeth in
[49:26] me, shall never die, believest thou
[49:29] this. And she saith unto him, "Yay,
[49:31] Lord, I believe that thou art the
[49:34] Christ, the Son of God, which should
[49:37] come into the world." And when she had
[49:39] so said, she went her way and called
[49:43] Mary her sister secretly, saying, "The
[49:47] master has come and calleth for thee."
[49:50] As soon as she heard that, she came. She
[49:53] arose quickly and came unto him. May God
[49:57] bless his word. You may be seated
[49:58] tonight in the presence of the Lord. I'd
[50:01] like to speak to you a little thought
[50:03] that God's laid on my heart for this
[50:04] service here tonight on she still
[50:08] believes. She still believes. Brother
[50:12] Random said in the same Jesus tonight in
[50:15] Switzerland, he said that God was in
[50:18] that man. She ran to him and she fell on
[50:21] her face the right way of approach. She
[50:24] looked up at him and give him right the
[50:28] right title and she said,"Lord, if thou
[50:31] wouldest have been here, my brother
[50:32] would not have died." Look at the
[50:34] reverence. Now look, here's a faithful
[50:37] heart by the side of the fountain. It's
[50:40] got to happen coming the provided way.
[50:43] She recognizes him as Lord in the faith
[50:47] in the face of death. She still believes
[50:51] him in the face of death. She still
[50:55] believes him. I think that sometimes
[50:57] when we go through our deepest of
[51:00] crisises that we begin to lose sight of
[51:03] who really is amongst us. But I think
[51:06] it's wonderful that Martha didn't lose
[51:08] hope. I think it's wonderful that we've
[51:10] got a testimony in Martha when she was
[51:13] busy about the work when Jesus was
[51:15] sitting there and fellowshipping over
[51:17] the word of life. When the real trial
[51:20] came on there, Martha was very, very
[51:23] showing her very colors that God had put
[51:26] on the inside of her that even in the
[51:29] face of death, she still believes him.
[51:32] Because anybody can believe Jesus when
[51:34] things are going good. Anybody can
[51:36] believe Jesus when everything is working
[51:39] out according to their plan. But when
[51:42] things go ary and things start to get a
[51:44] little clamored and maybe they maybe
[51:47] they begin to get a little hazy and you
[51:49] can't see the picture as clear. I wonder
[51:52] if YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT HE'S STILL
[51:54] JESUS WHEN THINGS OF LIFE begin to get
[51:57] in to turmoil. NOW THE PROPHET SAID IN
[51:59] FROM THAT TIME he said as I was speaking
[52:02] the other night he said now the natural
[52:04] man has only five senses but the
[52:06] believer when he meets God he gets
[52:09] something different. Are you with me?
[52:10] When the believer meets God, he gets
[52:13] something different. He said it's a
[52:14] super sense. He said that lifts him
[52:17] above the shadows. Hallelujah. It makes
[52:19] him believe that things impossible come
[52:22] to pass. That's a real believer. THINGS
[52:25] THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE ARE ABLE to come to
[52:28] pass.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He still believes they will
[52:31] come to pass because God said so. And
[52:34] when a man meets God, something takes
[52:37] place. You know good and well that in
[52:40] your LIFE BEFORE YOU MET GOD, YOU were
[52:42] filled with all kinds of doubt and
[52:44] unbelief and fear. But as SOON AS YOU
[52:47] MET THE MASTER, IT WAS IN THAT MOMENT
[52:49] THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD TRANSPIRED
[52:51] IN YOUR LIFE. THE PILLAR OF FIRE COME
[52:54] LOOKING JUST FOR YOU. WHY? BECAUSE THERE
[52:56] WAS SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF YOU THAT
[52:58] YOU WAS BORN TO BELIEVE WITH.
[53:01] And
[53:01] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOMETHING
[53:03] THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THIS GENERATION. I
[53:06] BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING HAS BEEN
[53:08] DEPOSITED IN THIS GENERATION to give the
[53:10] PEOPLE OF GOD A FAITH to believe for the
[53:14] supernatural. I'll just say it like THIS
[53:16] IS THAT MELZDC HAS COME IN DUST AGAIN IN
[53:20] THE REALM OF FLESH AGAIN AND PUT
[53:22] SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF THAT VESSEL
[53:24] SO THAT YOU WOULD RECOGNIZE WHO HAS COME
[53:27] WALKING. NOT ANOTHER MELZDC. NOT A
[53:30] MELZDC OF 4,000 YEARS AGO. AND NOT A
[53:33] MELZDC OF 2,000 YEARS AGO, BUT THIS
[53:36] MELZDC HAS COME AGAIN IN A BRIDE FORM.
[53:39] HALLELUJAH. AND HAS COME AND MINISTERED
[53:42] TO A PEOPLE TO GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO
[53:44] BELIEVE AGAINST OUR ODDS.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; So many times people come and say,
[53:52] "Well, I wish I had great faith."
[53:56] And I love what the prophet said to
[53:58] that. He said, 'Well, you had faith
[53:59] enough to come to church, didn't you? HE
[54:02] SAID, 'WELL, YOU TAKE THAT SAME KIND OF
[54:03] FAITH THAT YOU GOT TO COME TO CHURCH AND
[54:06] YOU put it in his hands. And he said,
[54:08] when you put it in his hands, when you
[54:11] put it IN HIS HANDS, THEN THE MIRACLE
[54:13] HAS GOT TO TAKE PLACE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[54:16] PRODUCE MIRACLES. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
[54:18] TAKE THAT LITTLE SIMPLE FAITH that you
[54:20] got and place IT IN THE HANDS OF THE
[54:23] MASTER. I WONDER DO YOU STILL BELIEVE?
[54:28] &gt;&gt; You see WE BECOME A BYPRODUCT OF THE
[54:32] ENVIRONMENT that we are in. I I believe
[54:35] that I believe that many of times that
[54:38] we are whether you can accept IT OR NOT
[54:41] IS THAT YOU MAKE ACTIONS and reactions
[54:44] according to the environment that you
[54:46] are in. And you know good and well that
[54:49] there have been times in your life if
[54:51] you can look back THAT YOU REACTED TO
[54:53] CERTAIN SITUATIONS
[54:55] A CERTAIN WAY BECAUSE OF THE certain
[54:58] influence that you were in or the
[55:00] environment that you were in in that
[55:02] certain moment. BUT IF YOU WOULD LOOK
[55:03] BACK TO THAT CERTAIN PARTICULAR time
[55:06] when you made that rash DECISION FROM
[55:08] THE SPOT THAT YOU'RE STANDING AT IN THIS
[55:10] MOMENT, YOU WOULD HANDLE THINGS
[55:12] COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. WHY? BECAUSE
[55:13] YOU'RE LIVING FROM A DIFFERENT PLACE.
[55:16] You see, NO MAN EVER STEPS in the water
[55:19] one man and EVER STEPS OUT THE SAME
[55:21] AGAIN. THE WATER'S NOT THE SAME AND THE
[55:24] MAN IS NOT THE SAME WHEN HE STEPS BACK
[55:26] IN THERE. I LOVE WHAT THE PROPHET SAID.
[55:28] NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE, WHAT ENVIRONMENT
[55:31] THAT YOU'RE IN, JESUS WILL COME ANYWHERE
[55:36] YOU CAN BELIEVE. HE WILL COME ANYWHERE
[55:38] THAT YOU CAN BELIEVE. HE SHOWED UP IN A
[55:41] FIERY FURNACE ONE TIME. HE SHOWED UP IN
[55:43] A LION'S DEN ONE TIME. HE SHOWED UP IN
[55:45] THE BELLY OF A WHALE ONE TIME. HE SHOWED
[55:48] UP in a pig PIN WHEN A PRODAL WAS AWAY
[55:50] FROM HOME JUST TO PROVE THAT HE WAS GOD.
[55:53] I'LL SAY THIS THAT GOD SHOWED UP IN A
[55:56] CAR ONE TIME JUST TO PROVE THAT THIS WAS
[55:58] THE MINISTRY OF MALACHI 4. HE SHOWED UP
[56:01] IN THIS BUILDING ONE TIME JUST TO PROVE
[56:04] THAT HE WAS A HEALER. I WONDER HOW MANY
[56:06] TIMES HE SHOWED UP ACCORDING TO THE
[56:09] ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU ARE A PART OF.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[56:15] You begin to think about this family
[56:18] that Jesus had been so accustomed to
[56:21] spend time with.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Ain't it wonderful to realize that Jesus
[56:25] wants to spend time at your house?
[56:29] &gt;&gt; They had become in such a place that
[56:31] they were bosom buddies. YOU GOT TO
[56:33] THINK ABOUT THAT. THROUGH THE PROPHET'S
[56:36] MINISTRY, we're able to gather a glimpse
[56:39] into Lazarus's life beforehand. before
[56:42] he is known as a man that's raised from
[56:44] the dead. The prophet looks back into
[56:46] his past environments and sees him that
[56:49] he was born and he was wanting to be a
[56:51] scribe. He was wanting to do something
[56:54] for the Lord. AND SO HE WENT IN THERE
[56:56] AND HE WENT TO SCHOOL and he was
[56:58] studying to BE A SCRIBE. AND HIS SISTERS
[57:01] MARTHA AND MARY, THEY WERE MAKING
[57:03] TAPESTRIES for the temple and they were
[57:05] wanting to do something FOR THE HOUSE OF
[57:08] GOD. BUT WHEN JESUS CAME ALONG,
[57:10] HALLELUJAH, they got rid OF ALL THEIR
[57:12] TRADITIONS, THEY GOT RID OF THEIR
[57:14] FRIENDS, THEY GOT RID OF THEIR creeds
[57:17] just to begin to associate with Jesus.
[57:20] AND I BELIEVE THAT'S A way that a lot of
[57:22] us have done. WE HAVE LEFT OUR FRIENDS.
[57:24] WE have left our families. We have we
[57:27] have left religion just to COME AND BE
[57:30] ACCUSTOMED WITH YOU. BE ACCUSTOMED WITH
[57:32] JESUS. ARE YOU WITH ME?
[57:34] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? I'D SAY A LOT OF YOU,
[57:36] IF YOU CAN LOOK AT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT
[57:38] YOU WERE IN BEFORE JESUS GOT A HOLD OF
[57:40] YOU, AND YOU WOULD LOOK AT THE
[57:42] ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU'RE IN CURRENTLY,
[57:44] YOU WOULD SAY THAT SOMETHING'S
[57:46] DIFFERENT.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Martha and Mary and Lazarus, THEY GAVE
[57:52] UP EVERYTHING. THEY HAD BEEN STUDYING
[57:54] THE MINISTRY OF JOHN THE BAPTIST, THE
[57:57] PROPHET SAID. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THAT
[57:59] LAZARUS WAS A CLOSE LISTENER TO JOHN THE
[58:01] BAPTIST. AND HE SAID HE GOT HE GOT TO
[58:04] PREACHING THAT THERE WAS A MESSIAH
[58:05] COMING. SO HE STARTED LOOKING FOR THAT
[58:07] MESSIAH. AND HE WAS THERE ON THAT DAY.
[58:10] HALLELUJAH. THAT THERE WHEN JOHN THE
[58:12] BAPTIST SAW JESUS COMING SAID BEHOLD THE
[58:15] LAMB OF GOD WHICH TAKES AWAY THE SIN OF
[58:18] THE WORLD. JOHN THE BAPTIST LOST HE LOST
[58:21] THE CONVERT THAT DAY BECAUSE LAZARUS WAS
[58:24] NO LONGER FOLLOWING JOHN THE BAPTIST.
[58:26] BUT HE WAS FOLLOWING JESUS. HE LEFT
[58:29] EVERYTHING TO FOLLOW JESUS. I WOULD SAY
[58:32] THIS, THEY LEFT EVERYTHING BECAUSE THEY
[58:35] WAS BELIEVERS. I KNOW YOUR STORY. I KNOW
[58:39] YOUR STORY. AND THE REASON WHY YOU ARE
[58:41] HERE IS BECAUSE YOU'RE A BELIEVER. YOU
[58:45] HAD TO SEPARATE AND TO LEAVE SOMETHING
[58:47] JUST TO FIND
[58:49] &gt;&gt; THAT he's still Jesus.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; You find this little girl.
[58:58] You go back into her life and you begin
[59:02] to see there's something about this
[59:03] girl.
[59:05] She's born in a different kind of
[59:08] environment.
[59:10] She's in an environment that she's
[59:12] forced in a very young age to go out and
[59:16] provide for her family and she's sent
[59:18] out there and she becomes a harlot.
[59:24] Now, how would you like it when your
[59:26] story is written
[59:28] in the Old and in the New Testament?
[59:32] &gt;&gt; You're w down as a harlot. BUT THERE'S
[59:36] SOMETHING POWERFUL ABOUT YOUR STORY.
[59:40] THERE'S SOMETHING POWERFUL ABOUT YOUR
[59:42] STORY IS THAT YOU DON'T STAY IN THE
[59:45] ENVIRONMENT, HALLELUJAH, that you was
[59:47] pushed into. YOU SEE THIS WOMAN RAHAB,
[59:51] SHE WAS FORCED BY HER MOTHER AND HER
[59:54] FATHER TO GO out there and to live a
[59:56] life of prostitution. SHE WAS RECORDED
[59:59] AS ONE OF THE TOP FIVE MOST BEAUTIFUL
[1:00:01] WOMEN THROUGHOUT ALL THE GENEALOGIES AND
[1:00:04] HISTORY OF STUDYING WOMEN. THIS WOMAN
[1:00:07] RAHAB IS IN THE TOP FIVE OF THE MOST
[1:00:10] BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.
[1:00:13] But I love what the prophet said. But at
[1:00:16] the first opportunity that she had to
[1:00:18] accept God, she did it.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; You see, SHE REFUSED, HALLELUJAH, TO BE
[1:00:25] A PART OF THE ENVIRONMENT THAT SHE WAS
[1:00:28] BORN INTO. A LOT OF PEOPLE, HALLELUJAH,
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE BORN IN A MESS. A
[1:00:35] LOT OF PEOPLE WERE BORN IN RAGS.
[1:00:37] HALLELUJAH. BUT THEY REFUSE TO STAY IN
[1:00:40] THAT ENVIRONMENT.
[1:00:42] [cheering]
[1:00:46] Brother Brandham said, he said it in W
[1:00:48] little Bethlehem. He said that I might
[1:00:50] add here.
[1:00:52] He said that I MIGHT ADD HERE. SHE TYPED
[1:00:55] THE GENTILE CHURCH. SHE WAS A GENTILE
[1:00:57] TYPE OF THE GENTILE CHURCH. WHEN THEY
[1:00:59] HEARD THE MESSAGE, WHEN WE WERE ALL OUT
[1:01:02] IN SPIRITUAL PROSTITUTION, COMMITTING
[1:01:05] COMMITTING SPIRITUAL FORNICATION,
[1:01:07] FORNICATION AGAINST GOD AND ALL OF
[1:01:09] HEAVEN AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF, ALL KINDS
[1:01:11] OF DENOMINATIONS and religions. Woo!
[1:01:14] Mercy, Jesus,
[1:01:16] WHEN YOU WAS OUT THERE SERVING THE LORD
[1:01:20] UNDER THE NAME OF A CATHOLIC, YOU WAS
[1:01:24] COMMITTING spiritual fornication. Amen.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; I love you. I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH AND I
[1:01:30] LOVE WHAT YOU CAME through the exomage.
[1:01:34] You didn't realize it, but you was
[1:01:36] committing spiritual fornication.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. COMMITTING SPIRITUAL
[1:01:42] FORNICATIONS AGAINST THE GOD OF HEAVEN
[1:01:45] AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF, ALL KINDS OF
[1:01:47] DENOMINATIONS AND RELIGIONS. BUT WHEN
[1:01:50] THEY HEARD THAT THERE WAS A GOD THAT
[1:01:53] STILL LIVED AND COULD PERFORM MIRACLES,
[1:01:56] QUICKLY QUICKLY SHE RECEIVE THE MESSAGE.
[1:02:01] WHAT HAPPENED WHEN SHE HEARD THE WORD
[1:02:05] SOMETHING TOOK PLACE. NOW the prophet
[1:02:08] said it when he comes and preaches a
[1:02:10] door in a door. He said now this is very
[1:02:13] unusual setting that we see this morning
[1:02:16] in our scripture reading. He said it's
[1:02:18] unusual in many ways. He said because
[1:02:21] one of the it's one of the most pathetic
[1:02:22] scriptures that there is in the Bible
[1:02:25] here is this scripture. It's speaking of
[1:02:28] this age that we're living in. He said
[1:02:30] in the age where Jesus CHRIST HAS BEEN
[1:02:33] PUT out of his own church and standing
[1:02:36] at the door knocking trying to get back
[1:02:38] in and riches and pleasures of the world
[1:02:41] has drove him from the church until the
[1:02:43] church becomes lukewarm. It's very
[1:02:45] pathetic picture of all the other
[1:02:47] churches in the church ages. I just GOT
[1:02:50] GOING THROUGH GOT DONE going through
[1:02:51] them at my church and returning back now
[1:02:53] beginning the 17th to take them seven
[1:02:56] seals. AND NOW IN THIS WE find that all
[1:02:58] the other churches had accepted but the
[1:03:00] last church age the LEOSAIC CHURCH AGE
[1:03:03] CHRIST had been taken from the people
[1:03:06] and they PUT HIM OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH
[1:03:07] and he was trying to get back in there
[1:03:09] taken knocking at the door. He said THEY
[1:03:11] BECOME BLIND. HE SAID IT'S VERY UNUSUAL.
[1:03:15] HE SAID BUT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES it's the
[1:03:18] unusual things in where God appears. God
[1:03:21] appears in unusual THINGS BECAUSE GOD IS
[1:03:25] UNUSUAL. He does unusual things. HE
[1:03:29] APPEARS AT UNUSUAL TIMES. He is seen at
[1:03:32] unusual TIMES. WHEN TIMES YOU WOULDN'T
[1:03:34] THINK that you would he would be there,
[1:03:36] he's there.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; IT'S VERY UNUSUAL. HIS WORKS IS
[1:03:41] MYSTERIOUS. HE WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.
[1:03:44] THE BIBLE SAID HIS wonders are to
[1:03:46] perform. Therefore, that makes him
[1:03:49] unusual. He said WE GET INTO AN unusual
[1:03:54] trend of things and we miss God.
[1:03:58] We get in unusual things and we miss
[1:04:00] God. HE SAID WHEN WE DO THAT, we might
[1:04:03] make a a a a big and mighty and terrible
[1:04:07] mistake.
[1:04:09] It's when we GET TO THAT SPOT. BUT I
[1:04:12] WOULD SAY IF YOU'RE REAL HONEST WITH
[1:04:13] YOURSELF IS THAT GOD HAS been working in
[1:04:16] your life in an unusual way. THERE ARE
[1:04:19] THINGS ABOUT GOD. IF WE WOULD JUST LOOK
[1:04:21] BACK THROUGHOUT OUR LIFE, WE WOULD SAY
[1:04:23] THAT GOD DID THAT AND GOD DID THAT AND
[1:04:26] GOD DID THAT AND ALL OF IT WAS UNUSUAL.
[1:04:30] WHY DIDN'T HE DO IT THIS WAY? WHY?
[1:04:32] BECAUSE GOD is unusual.
[1:04:36] That word unusual, it means it's
[1:04:39] something that is not coming or
[1:04:41] ordinary. IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS NOT
[1:04:43] TYPICAL. IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS NOT
[1:04:46] EXPECTED.
[1:04:48] It came in an unexpected WAY. IT DIDN'T
[1:04:51] COME IN A NORMAL WAY. AND I WOULD SAY,
[1:04:54] HALLELUJAH, IF WE WOULD LOOK AT GOD,
[1:04:57] THAT GOD IS UNUSUAL. HIS WORD IS
[1:05:00] UNUSUAL. HIS PEOPLE are unusual. IF WE
[1:05:03] WOULD LOOK AT HALF OF THIS CHURCH
[1:05:04] TONIGHT,
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; there's a few names in here.
[1:05:12] They're unusual people.
[1:05:15] You know, that way that brother William
[1:05:17] preaches, it's just unusual. The way
[1:05:19] Brother Matt McClard,
[1:05:22] there's a lot we could say about Red
[1:05:24] Bull.
[1:05:26] It's just unusual. AND THEN THE WAY
[1:05:28] BROTHER ANDREW IS, BROTHER RON, BROTHER
[1:05:30] MATTHEW. THEY'RE [screaming] ALL JUST
[1:05:32] UNUSUAL. JUST TAKE A LOOK AT YOURSELF.
[1:05:35] TAKE A LOOK AT SISTER ROXY. TAKE A LOOK
[1:05:37] AT THIS ONE AND THAT ONE. THEY'RE
[1:05:39] UNUSUAL.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; WHY IN THE WORLD? WHY? BECAUSE GOD,
[1:05:44] I know it's a mysterious thing
[1:05:45] sometimes, but God uses unusual people.
[1:05:51] [cheering]
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; So therefore,
[1:06:03] when we see the unusual,
[1:06:07] it's proof that God is real close.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; This is thing I found out about God.
[1:06:14] He's a great big lot.
[1:06:17] And I found out about good fishing holes
[1:06:20] that if you want to fish a good hole and
[1:06:22] you want to do it at night time, you
[1:06:24] better have a good light. Because if
[1:06:27] when you got that light out there across
[1:06:28] that water, all of a sudden it starts
[1:06:30] bringing in my bugs. And them old water
[1:06:32] bugs come flying around that light there
[1:06:35] and them fish start gathering around
[1:06:36] them bugs.
[1:06:39] You watch, there's more nuts in this
[1:06:41] message. There's some nuts in THIS
[1:06:44] MESSAGE. BUT DON'T MISS
[1:06:47] WHERE GOD IS TRULY AT.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU with me? I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M
[1:06:51] SAYING IT, BUT I'M SAYING IT. THERE IS
[1:06:53] SOME REAL UNUSUAL PEOPLE THAT ATTACH
[1:06:55] THEM. THERE IS SOME PEOPLE THAT TAKE THE
[1:06:58] MESSAGE ODDBALL AND THEY TAKE IT LITERAL
[1:07:00] AND TRY TO BE THE WEIRDEST PERSON IN THE
[1:07:02] CHURCH.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; God ain't saying that. My God, I better
[1:07:07] move on or y'all going to cast ME OUT.
[1:07:09] NOTICE GOD USES unusual things. NOTICE
[1:07:13] THIS QUEEN OF SHEBA. BUT THERE WAS
[1:07:16] SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF HER HEART.
[1:07:18] WHEN THE HEART GOES TO HUNGERING FOR
[1:07:19] GOD, GOD AFTER IT GOES HUNGERING FOR
[1:07:22] GOD, TROUBLES DON'T LOOK LIKE ANYTHING.
[1:07:25] YOU'VE GOT YOUR MINDSET. NO MATTER WHAT
[1:07:27] ANYBODY CALLS YOU, THEY CAN CALL YOU NO
[1:07:29] MATTER WHAT. HALLELUJAH. No matter what
[1:07:32] they say or whatever they want to, THEY
[1:07:34] CAN SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT TO. THEY CAN
[1:07:36] TRY TO PUT A STUMBLING BLOCK IN YOUR
[1:07:38] WAY, BUT IF YOU'RE THIRSTING for God,
[1:07:40] you're going to find it somewhere. He
[1:07:42] said, "There's nothing GOING TO STOP
[1:07:44] YOU. YOUR HUSBAND ISN'T GOING TO STOP
[1:07:46] YOU. YOUR WIFE AIN'T GOING TO STOP YOU.
[1:07:48] YOUR CHURCH AIN'T GOING TO STOP YOU.
[1:07:50] YOUR PASTOR ain't going to STOP YOU.
[1:07:52] THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN KEEP AWAY A
[1:07:54] SAINT from God if he really WANTS TO SEE
[1:07:57] IT." AND THIS WOMAN HAD DESIRED, EVEN
[1:08:00] THOUGH SHE NEVER MET SOLOMON, BUT SHE
[1:08:03] JUST HEARD ABOUT IT. AND SOMETHING GOT
[1:08:06] TO STIRRING ON THE INSIDE OF [screaming]
[1:08:08] HER HEART. AND IF YOU GET IN THAT KIND
[1:08:11] OF A CONDITION, YOU CANNOT STAY AWAY.
[1:08:14] YOUR PARENTS CAN'T KEEP YOU AWAY. YOUR
[1:08:16] FAMILY CAN'T KEEP YOU AWAY. BUT YOU'VE
[1:08:18] GOT TO FIND OUT THAT JESUS IS A REALITY.
[1:08:22] THERE HAD SOMETHING STRUCK ON THE INSIDE
[1:08:25] OF THAT LITTLE WOMAN. IT WAS A GENE SEED
[1:08:27] OF GOD. EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS LIVING IN A
[1:08:29] HEATHEN NATION,
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; she
[1:08:34] still
[1:08:35] believed.
[1:08:38] Notice what Paul said in Hebrews 11:31.
[1:08:42] By faith the harlot,
[1:08:45] Rahab, perish not with them that believe
[1:08:48] not when she received the spies with
[1:08:52] peace. Notice
[1:08:54] when you look AT RAHAB, SHE WAS IN SHE
[1:08:57] HAD FAITH IN THE MOST CORRUPT
[1:08:59] ATMOSPHERE. SHE HAD FAITH IN THE WORST
[1:09:02] OF ENVIRONMENTS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT
[1:09:04] JERICHO'S ATMOSPHERE, IT IS FULL OF
[1:09:07] IDOLATRY. THE WALLS AND ECHOES HAD
[1:09:10] SHOUTED OUT DEFIANCE AGAINST GOD. THE
[1:09:13] ATMOSPHERE WAS SIN. THE ATMOSPHERE WAS
[1:09:15] FEAR. THE ATMOSPHERE WAS IDOLATRY. BUT
[1:09:18] THERE WAS ONE WOMAN THAT STILL BELIEVED.
[1:09:22] IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF ALL THE CHAOS OF
[1:09:25] A CITY, THERE WAS ONE WOMAN THAT STILL
[1:09:28] BELIEVED. PAUL SAID IN ROMANS 10:10,
[1:09:31] "FOR WITH THE HEART MAN BELIEVETH under
[1:09:34] righteousness, AND WITH THE MOUTH
[1:09:37] CONFESSION IS MADE UNTO SALVATION. SHE
[1:09:40] DID NOT KEEP IT TO HERSELF."
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; SHE SPOKE WHAT WAS IN HER HEART.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; So then faith cometh by hearing
[1:09:52] and hearing. How'd he do it? Hearing by
[1:09:56] the word of God.
[1:09:58] And here you just begin to look at the
[1:10:01] drama.
[1:10:03] She brought
[1:10:05] these men into her home.
[1:10:11] Preachers,
[1:10:13] message preachers packing Joshua's
[1:10:16] message, packing Joshua's commission.
[1:10:20] Notice
[1:10:22] these spies come in there and they start
[1:10:25] having a little testimony service. It's
[1:10:27] amazing when you get men of God, people
[1:10:31] of God on the inside of a house, you're
[1:10:33] going to find out real quick whether
[1:10:35] they're believer or not. AND THEY GOT TO
[1:10:38] TALKING ABOUT WHAT God did down there.
[1:10:41] And they got to TALKING ABOUT HOW THAT
[1:10:43] GOD MOVED OVER AAG and over a down there
[1:10:46] and got to working and moving out and
[1:10:48] different things and proving. And
[1:10:50] brother Random SAID THAT WHEN SHE GOT to
[1:10:51] hearing those things, he said she NEVER
[1:10:53] SAID, "NOW YOU BRING UP HERE JOSHUA and
[1:10:56] then I'll see if I believe it." HE SAID
[1:10:58] SHE BELIEVED IT AT THE VERY MOMENT THEY
[1:11:01] GOT TO TALKING TO HER. HE SAID THE WORD
[1:11:04] [screaming] OF THEM SPIES WAS GOOD
[1:11:06] ENOUGH FOR THAT LITTLE WOMAN.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; THERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAD
[1:11:10] TRANSPIRED TO HER HEART. Now notice
[1:11:14] they're having a testimony service.
[1:11:16] They're talking about what God does, GOD
[1:11:18] DID, AND WHAT HE'S STILL DOING. AND THEN
[1:11:21] RAHAB STARTS TESTIFYING IN VERSE 9. She
[1:11:25] has her little testimony service. Do you
[1:11:28] want to read it with me tonight? AND SHE
[1:11:30] SAID UNTO the men, I know THAT THE LORD,
[1:11:34] CAPITAL L. NOW, WAIT A COT AND PICK A
[1:11:37] MINUTE. HOW IN THE WORLD DID SHE EVER
[1:11:39] HEAR THAT NAME?
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; WHERE DID SHE GET THE NAME JEHOVAH?
[1:11:45] WHERE DID SHE HEAR ABOUT IT? WHAT DID
[1:11:48] SHE STUDY IN HER IDOLATRY TO KNOW THAT
[1:11:51] NAME?
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING HAD TRANSPIRED IN HER HEART.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; The Lord hath given you the land, and
[1:12:02] your terror hath fallen upon us, and
[1:12:06] that all the inhabitants of the land are
[1:12:08] faint because of you. And you think
[1:12:11] you're a nobody
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; and you think that you can't conquer
[1:12:14] your own self. But there little do you
[1:12:18] know there's an entire city walled up
[1:12:21] because of you.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; So turn that on the devil.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; You will not tell me that I'm nothing.
[1:12:30] You will NOT TELL ME THAT I can't
[1:12:32] conquer. YOU WILL NOT TELL ME THAT I'M
[1:12:34] NOT ANYTHING. I WAS BORN TO SHUT up the
[1:12:37] walls of Jericho.
[1:12:40] HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; FOR WE HAVE HEARD. IT'S AMAZING HOW THAT
[1:12:44] IN LEOA THERE'S STILL A PEOPLE HEARING
[1:12:47] HOW [screaming] THE LORD DRIED UP THE
[1:12:49] WATER OVER IT SEA FOR YOU WHEN YOU COME
[1:12:51] OUT OF EGYPT AND WHAT YOU DID UNTO THE
[1:12:53] TWO kings of the Amorites were on the
[1:12:55] other side of Jordan, ZION, AND O and
[1:12:58] where whom ye utterly destroyed.
[1:13:02] And as soon as we had heard these
[1:13:05] things, our hearts did melt. Neither did
[1:13:09] there remain any more courage in any man
[1:13:12] because of you. For the Lord your God,
[1:13:15] HE IS GOD IN HEAVEN ABOVE AND IN EARTH
[1:13:17] BENEATH. NOW THEREFORE, I PRAY YOU SWEAR
[1:13:21] UNTO ME BY THE LORD SINCE I HAVE SOLD
[1:13:23] YOU KINDNESS THAT YOU WILL ALSO SHOW
[1:13:26] KINDNESS UNTO MY FATHER'S HOUSE AND GIVE
[1:13:29] ME A TRUE TOKEN.
[1:13:32] YOU SEE, SHE CREATED A DIFFERENT
[1:13:35] atmosphere
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; in the same house.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; IN THE SAME HOUSE SHE'D SINNED IN. IN
[1:13:45] THE SAME HOUSE THAT SHE'D BROUGHT OTHER
[1:13:47] MEN IN. IN THE SAME HOUSE. IN THE SAME
[1:13:50] HOUSE. BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING
[1:13:52] DIFFERENT. SHE INVITED AND HEAVENLY
[1:13:55] ENVIRONMENT,
[1:13:57] AN ATMOSPHERE ON THE [screaming] INSIDE
[1:13:59] OF HER HEART. AND MAYBE MAYBE THIS IS
[1:14:02] JUST ME, BUT I THINK JOSHUA GOT THIS
[1:14:04] FROM RAHAB. SHE SAID, "AS FOR ME AND MY
[1:14:07] HOUSE, WE WILL SERVE THE LORD."
[1:14:11] [applause]
[1:14:15] Rahab
[1:14:16] was greater.
[1:14:18] Let me just make it real plain.
[1:14:21] Rahab was greater than the environment
[1:14:24] of Jericho.
[1:14:26] Hallelujah.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; She was bigger than the atmosphere of
[1:14:30] sin. SHE WAS BIGGER AND GREATER THAN THE
[1:14:34] INFLUENCE OF A HARLOT'S LIFE. YOU SEE,
[1:14:37] THE ENVIRONMENT OF THAT CONDEMNED CITY
[1:14:39] WAS NOT NO LONGER ON THE INSIDE OF THAT
[1:14:41] WOMAN. WHEN SHE HEARD THE WORD, THERE
[1:14:44] WAS SOMETHING PRICRICKED HER HEART AND
[1:14:46] IT CHANGED HER WHOLE ENTIRE ATMOSPHERE.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT? SHE BECAME A PROPHET.
[1:14:54] HALLELUJAH. She was no longer a product
[1:14:57] of the environment, but she BECAME A
[1:14:59] PROPHET AND SHE STARTED TALKING TO THOSE
[1:15:02] STONES.
[1:15:03] Everything around me is GOING DOWN, BUT
[1:15:05] I'M not going down with THEM STONES.
[1:15:08] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THAT STONES IS
[1:15:10] CONFESSIONS AND WITH YOUR MOUTH YOU MAKE
[1:15:13] A CONFESSION UNTO THE LORD. SHE SAID,
[1:15:16] "I'M NOT GOING DOWN WITH JERICHO. I'M
[1:15:18] NOT GOING DOWN WITH MY SIN. I'M NOT
[1:15:20] GOING DOWN WITH MY PAST, BUT I'M RAISING
[1:15:23] UP.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; You can either change your environment
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; or you can become a victim of it.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach. YOU ARE EITHER
[1:15:38] QUALIFIED BY YOUR NEW BIRTH for the
[1:15:41] environment that you were born TO LIVE
[1:15:42] IN OR YOU ARE EITHER QUALIFIED TO STAY
[1:15:45] IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF SIN AND DOUBT.
[1:15:49] Like Martha, Rahab refused. She refused
[1:15:53] to let the surroundings DICTATE HER
[1:15:55] FAITH. SHE WAS NOT GOING TO BE
[1:15:57] CONTROLLED BY WHAT SHE SEEN, WHAT SHE
[1:15:59] HEARD, WHAT SHE FELT, WHAT PEOPLE
[1:16:02] THOUGHT ABOUT HER.
[1:16:06] CHILDREN, do you hear what I'm saying to
[1:16:08] you?
[1:16:10] Do you hear what I'm saying to you? You
[1:16:12] cannot allow your friends to dictate
[1:16:14] what you believe. You cannot allow your
[1:16:16] school friends to make you dictate how
[1:16:18] you believe this message and how you see
[1:16:21] this message. You were put HERE TO BE
[1:16:23] THE MASTER OVER TOP OF THE ENVIRONMENT
[1:16:25] THAT GOD PUT you in. Let me say this TO
[1:16:28] YOU. YOU CANNOT LOOK LIKE THE WORLD AND
[1:16:31] influence the world to be a Christian.
[1:16:34] YOU CANNOT PUT YOUR EYE WINKERS ON. YOU
[1:16:36] CANNOT PUT YOUR FINGERNAIL POLISH. WELL,
[1:16:38] BROTHER ANDREW, it's pink and it doesn't
[1:16:39] show up. Let me say this. IF A PROPHET
[1:16:41] PREACHED IT, THEN IT'S STILL RIGHT.
[1:16:46] A PROPHET PREACHED ABOUT OUR WOMEN AND
[1:16:49] THEIR SISTERS WEARING SLITS IN THEIR
[1:16:51] SKIRTS UP TO THE GATES OF HELL. IF A
[1:16:54] PROPHET PREACHED IT, THEN IT'S STILL
[1:16:56] RIGHT.
[1:16:59] WELL, JOHNNY DOES IT AND SUSIE DOES IT
[1:17:01] OUT THERE AND THEY CALL THEMSELVES
[1:17:03] CHRISTIANS. WE ARE NOT IN THAT KIND OF
[1:17:05] AN ENVIRONMENT. OUR ENVIRONMENT IS A
[1:17:08] MESSAGE ENVIRONMENT.
[1:17:10] SO THEREFORE, OUR PRODUCT.
[1:17:15] IF WE'RE PRODUCING THE PRODUCT IN THE
[1:17:17] HOUSE, THEN THE PRODUCT [screaming]
[1:17:19] OUGHT TO LOOK LIKE THE MESSAGE, TALK
[1:17:21] LIKE THE MESSAGE, SING LIKE THE MESSAGE,
[1:17:24] DANCE LIKE THE MESSAGE, BELIEVE LIKE THE
[1:17:26] MESSAGE.
[1:17:29] [applause]
[1:17:32] WELL, IT MIGHT BE OLDFASHIONED, BUT IT'S
[1:17:34] STILL THE TRUTH.
[1:17:37] YOU MIGHT GET MAD AT ME, BUT I'D RATHER
[1:17:39] YOU GET MAD AT ME HERE THAN TO GET MAD
[1:17:41] AT ME ON JUDGMENT DAY. IF A PROPHET
[1:17:43] PREACHED IT, THEN I BELIEVE IT.
[1:17:50] [cheering]
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; You will never change their environment
[1:17:53] by trying to look like them.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I WAS PUT HERE TO BE THE
[1:18:04] MASTER OVER LEOSA. LEOSA [screaming]
[1:18:08] CANNOT CONTROL ME.
[1:18:13] You see what it is? It's lukewarmness
[1:18:15] that slips in and tries to creep its way
[1:18:17] into our children, slip its way into OUR
[1:18:20] YOUNG GIRLS AND SLIP OUR WAY, SLIP ITS
[1:18:22] WAY IN RIGHT INTO OUR YOUNG BOYS TO MAKE
[1:18:25] THEM THINK THAT IT'S OKAY TO LOOK LIKE
[1:18:27] THE WORLD, DRESS LIKE THE WORLD, ACT
[1:18:29] LIKE THE WORLD, AND BE A CHRISTIAN.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; But that ain't my environment.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Let me say this about this bride. She
[1:18:44] still believes.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; She believes in old time fashion
[1:18:49] holiness.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; She believes IN AN OLDFASHIONED POURING
[1:18:53] OUT OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. YOU CAN SHOUT AND
[1:18:58] SING WITH ME ALL YOU WANT TO WHEN WE'RE
[1:19:00] MOVING AND DANCING IN THE SPIRIT, BUT
[1:19:02] YOU OUGHT TO BE A SHOUT ABOUT THAT
[1:19:03] [screaming]
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; AS MUCH AS YOU ARE WHEN THE SINGING'S
[1:19:06] GOING FORTH. WHY? BECAUSE IT'S GOT THE
[1:19:09] SAME POWER, SAME ABILITY FROM THE SAME
[1:19:12] SOURCE.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; She still believes. Paul said in 1
[1:19:19] Corinthians 15 and 33, "Be not deceived.
[1:19:22] Evil communications
[1:19:26] corrupt good manners.
[1:19:30] So we become a byproduct
[1:19:32] of our environment.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Our environment.
[1:19:37] Let me deal with this just a minute.
[1:19:39] The more that we spend time with the
[1:19:43] world and conversations of the world and
[1:19:47] conversations that we tolerate
[1:19:50] and we allow their atmosphere to come
[1:19:53] into our atmosphere, before long, we're
[1:19:56] going to start producing that kind of
[1:19:58] seed.
[1:20:00] Eventually, it's going to get on the
[1:20:01] inside of you. You see, I believe that
[1:20:03] so much. I keep hanging out with Sister
[1:20:04] Dorothy McClord. me and brother Matt and
[1:20:06] her wife, we get to hanging out and I'm
[1:20:08] praying, "Good Lord, how I have a great
[1:20:10] influence on her." And I switch her from
[1:20:11] being a vegetarian over to being a real
[1:20:17] It probably ain't going to work. She's
[1:20:19] probably going to work her way on my
[1:20:20] wife and then come over here. But I
[1:20:22] refuse that. I refuse that.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Well, what are you saying, Brother
[1:20:33] Andrew? I'm saying it like this. I had
[1:20:36] to break your spirit just so that you'd
[1:20:38] love me again. But it's kind of like
[1:20:40] putting a new shovel that you got at
[1:20:42] Lowe's. Real nice blue cobalt shovel.
[1:20:45] Got a real nice metal edge on it. Man,
[1:20:48] it's a beautiful thing. But you let it
[1:20:50] sit out there in the weather too long.
[1:20:53] You let it sit out there and it gets in
[1:20:54] the environment of the dew falling every
[1:20:56] day and the rain falling on it, before
[1:20:58] long it's going to start to corrode and
[1:21:01] it'll start taking on the atmosphere.
[1:21:03] The atmosphere is actually changing the
[1:21:05] very chemicals and the very status that
[1:21:08] it was built to be. And the more you
[1:21:10] hang out the Hallelujah. I ain't talking
[1:21:12] about vegetarians now.
[1:21:17] The more you hang out with that kind of
[1:21:20] people, you will start producing that
[1:21:22] kind of life. And the more you start
[1:21:24] hanging around with negativity, I tell
[1:21:26] you what, I hate negative people. I
[1:21:28] really do. I I I I'll just be honest.
[1:21:30] People like that need to be smacked in
[1:21:32] the mouth.
[1:21:34] People all the time negative all the I
[1:21:36] was I was sitting with a pastor one time
[1:21:38] and this woman, she was just yakking,
[1:21:40] yacking, yakking, yakking, yacking about
[1:21:42] everything about life. I mean, she she
[1:21:44] was from the tribe of yakamal. I tell
[1:21:45] you what, she was yakking about
[1:21:47] everything, talking about everything.
[1:21:48] Most the most negative person. This
[1:21:50] pastor, I was so proud of him. I tell
[1:21:52] you what, I couldn't been more proud of
[1:21:53] my pastor. He stood there and he looked
[1:21:55] at that man that was her husband. He
[1:21:57] said, 'I'll tell you what that woman
[1:21:59] needs. He said, 'What's that?' He said,
[1:22:00] ' One of these.
[1:22:04] You know, sometimes you need somebody to
[1:22:08] shut up the negativity in your life.
[1:22:12] [applause]
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Well, let me give you another one. I had
[1:22:16] a young man one time before I was saved.
[1:22:18] Praise God. He come up and knock he kind
[1:22:20] of kind of knocked me around saying some
[1:22:22] few things about me. He said, 'The
[1:22:24] reason why you were born to be a
[1:22:25] believer is because you was born in the
[1:22:28] right kind of a family, in the right
[1:22:30] kind of a home, and you got the right
[1:22:31] kind of atmosphere around you. I wasn't
[1:22:33] saved at the time, so I just punched him
[1:22:35] right in the mouth. And I found out
[1:22:38] right there,
[1:22:40] I was kined to Peter Cartwright.
[1:22:43] And I looked at him, he had it coming. I
[1:22:46] LOOKED AT HIM, I SAID, AND I'LL tell you
[1:22:47] what, it wasn't only that, but I I
[1:22:49] figured he good enough that he was good
[1:22:50] enough to say it. He was good enough to
[1:22:51] get this, too. I said, ' Let me tell you
[1:22:53] this. Just because I was born in the
[1:22:55] right kind of a family and the right
[1:22:57] kind of an atmosphere does not make me a
[1:22:59] believer. What makes me a believer is
[1:23:01] the new birth.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; It didn't help him.
[1:23:10] What are you saying, brother Angel? I'm
[1:23:12] saying it like this. I was born in a
[1:23:14] message family. Let me say this. I had
[1:23:17] one of the best environments for the
[1:23:18] message that could ever be asked for. I
[1:23:21] was born in a message home. I was born
[1:23:24] in a family of nine preachers on the
[1:23:27] Spencer side. I was born Hallelujah. I
[1:23:30] was born in a great family. And I'll
[1:23:31] tell you what, I'm thankful. I'm
[1:23:33] thankful I was born in a Spencer family.
[1:23:35] I remember my childhood growing up in
[1:23:38] this message was not sitting around
[1:23:40] playing video games. I was sitting down
[1:23:42] on the floor playing with tractors, John
[1:23:44] Deere tractors, and playing out cowboys
[1:23:46] and Indians while we was listening to
[1:23:48] William Brandon preach.
[1:23:50] But that still didn't make me a
[1:23:52] believer. And we've got brother David
[1:23:54] Pierce right here. AND HE WAS NOT BORN
[1:23:57] IN THAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT. HE DIDN'T
[1:23:59] KNOW nothing about the message. HE
[1:24:01] DIDN'T UNDERSTAND anything about the
[1:24:02] message. PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
[1:24:04] ABOUT RELIGION at all. He wasn't born in
[1:24:07] the same kind of environment that I was
[1:24:09] born in. But look at us now.
[1:24:14] [applause]
[1:24:20] You will either be a victim Hallelujah.
[1:24:24] You will either be a VICTIM TO THE
[1:24:25] ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU'RE IN. SOME PEOPLE
[1:24:27] SAY, "WELL, I IF I WAS BORN IF I WAS
[1:24:29] BORN like you, I that's why I knocked
[1:24:31] that boy in the mouth." He said, "I was
[1:24:32] born with a silver spoon in my mouth."
[1:24:34] So, I knocked him right in the mouth. He
[1:24:36] deserved it. I wasn't born with a SILVER
[1:24:38] SPOON. I WAS BORN TO BREAK THE
[1:24:40] ENVIRONMENT THAT I WAS IN.
[1:24:43] Let me say this. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
[1:24:45] THAT STILL LIVE IN THE PAST OF Homer
[1:24:47] Frasier.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; THEY STILL LIVE IN THE PAST OF DAYS GONE
[1:24:50] BY. WELL, IF YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE,
[1:24:52] JOHNNY, WHEN I WAS SERVING GOD 40 YEARS
[1:24:55] AGO, THINGS WAS A LOT DIFFERENT NOW. LET
[1:24:58] ME SAY THIS. YOU CANNOT BE A VICTIM TO
[1:25:01] 40 YEARS AGO OF JESUS OF 40 YEARS AGO.
[1:25:04] YOU GOT TO HAVE A FRESH.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; WELL, I'm I feel like preaching tonight.
[1:25:15] I do. I really do.
[1:25:18] [applause]
[1:25:22] I better move on to some quotes or ain't
[1:25:23] going to think I'm a message preacher.
[1:25:27] What are you saying? What What am I
[1:25:28] saying in all that? If you can change
[1:25:30] your environment,
[1:25:32] you can change your outcome.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people I could call out
[1:25:37] their name right now. Some of them I
[1:25:40] should just to prove a point,
[1:25:43] but I won't.
[1:25:47] But there's a lot of people sitting here
[1:25:49] that were born in the wrong kind of
[1:25:52] environment.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; To be honest, you didn't have a chance
[1:25:56] at this message. That's right.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; To be honest, you didn't have a chance
[1:26:00] to be blessed in the environment that
[1:26:01] you were in.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; You know, I find it amazing that
[1:26:05] sometimes,
[1:26:08] my goodness, I I wish this spirit
[1:26:10] wouldn't have got on me, but I feel like
[1:26:11] preaching it tonight.
[1:26:17] My wife is one of the loveliest
[1:26:19] preachers wives in this message. I'll
[1:26:22] just be real honest. I'm so proud of
[1:26:24] her.
[1:26:26] She wasn't born in a pastor's family.
[1:26:28] She wasn't born in a preacher's home.
[1:26:31] She didn't understand how preachers
[1:26:33] work, their lives work, that everything
[1:26:35] that you do and say will be held against
[1:26:37] you.
[1:26:39] She didn't understand certain things
[1:26:41] about the ministry. But to be honest, it
[1:26:45] was one of the greatest benefits to us
[1:26:47] is because we begin to look through the
[1:26:49] lens of somebody that didn't see
[1:26:51] preachers
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; the way that maybe we saw. Some people
[1:26:56] look at preachers as soon as they get
[1:26:57] done preaching. They ought to think that
[1:26:59] a preacher ought to go out there and
[1:27:01] start shaking everybody's hands. She
[1:27:04] said, "Now, I never didn't understand
[1:27:05] that until I became your wife." She
[1:27:08] said, "Because the anointing comes on
[1:27:10] you." And she said, "All of a sudden,
[1:27:11] that weakness." She said, "I never would
[1:27:13] have understood that unless I was born
[1:27:16] or I married into your family." And what
[1:27:18] I'm trying to get to is that my wife,
[1:27:22] God bless her, she's probably going to
[1:27:23] hang me up and kill me later, but I'm
[1:27:25] going to use her. My wife gets to set in
[1:27:29] some decent spots because she's my wife.
[1:27:33] We get to go certain places because
[1:27:36] we're ministry in the ministry.
[1:27:39] And a lot of people think, man, it's a
[1:27:41] vacation.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; I sure would love to go where you get to
[1:27:45] go. Preach where you get to preach. do
[1:27:48] what you get to do.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; I'd like to give you a glimpse of some
[1:27:55] of those things sometimes.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Some of you never seen a man that's so
[1:28:05] strung out on the Holy Ghost that he
[1:28:07] don't know which way's up or which way's
[1:28:09] down. He's crying himself to sleep. But
[1:28:12] she was born to take care of me.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. But let me let me in saying that
[1:28:16] she get we get to go some decent spots
[1:28:18] and I I do appreciate that. I do. But I
[1:28:21] I'm bringing all this around to say
[1:28:23] this. My wife,
[1:28:27] let me help me, Lord. My wife
[1:28:31] has never thought of herself of
[1:28:33] anything.
[1:28:35] She has never thought that she was
[1:28:37] better than anybody. She has never
[1:28:39] thought that she deserved to sit in
[1:28:41] certain circles just because she was my
[1:28:43] wife. She never thought that she
[1:28:45] deserved to get special treatment
[1:28:48] because she was my wife. Matter of fact,
[1:28:50] there's a lot of people that look at the
[1:28:52] ministry completely wrong. If you'll
[1:28:55] realize who we are, we are lower than
[1:28:57] you.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; If you'll really realize that, we are
[1:29:02] lower than you. I am your servant.
[1:29:09] To be honest,
[1:29:12] my wife gets plum upset when people
[1:29:15] start setting her at a better table
[1:29:18] because she's my wife. She would rather
[1:29:20] sit down and I would too. Rather sit out
[1:29:22] there and fellowship with the brothers
[1:29:23] and sisters.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK WE'RE
[1:29:26] ANYTHING. WE DON'T THINK THAT WE ARE
[1:29:29] ANYTHING SPECIAL. ABSOLUTELY NOT.
[1:29:32] But there are certain people
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; just because they're certain preacher,
[1:29:37] they born into a certain family, married
[1:29:39] into a certain family, WELL THEY BECOME
[1:29:41] A PART OF an environment and they think
[1:29:44] that they deserve special treatment. Let
[1:29:47] me say this. When preachers and
[1:29:48] preachers wives start thinking that they
[1:29:51] deserve special treatment, they have
[1:29:53] messed up.
[1:29:58] I understand that a minister is worthy
[1:30:02] of his reward. And I I believe that you
[1:30:05] ought to respect the ministry. I really
[1:30:07] do. I believe that it's something that
[1:30:09] is a lost art in homes is that people
[1:30:12] don't teach their children how to
[1:30:14] respect the ministry anymore. They'll
[1:30:16] talk that the pastor did this and the
[1:30:18] pastor did that and before long my
[1:30:21] ministry can no longer be effective
[1:30:23] because of what you said in front of
[1:30:25] your children.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; I said all that to say this. I said all
[1:30:34] that to say this.
[1:30:38] You can either break the environment
[1:30:39] that you were born in
[1:30:42] or you can become a victim of it. You
[1:30:45] see, the reason why you could not
[1:30:47] succeed in the brethren church, in the
[1:30:50] Methodist church, in the Catholic
[1:30:51] church, is because that was not your
[1:30:54] environment. Because you were born to
[1:30:56] believe the word against all odds.
[1:31:00] AGAINST ALL ODDS. YOU LOOK AT THE
[1:31:02] ATMOSPHERE IN BETHANY. IT WAS
[1:31:04] HOPELESSNESS. IT WAS MOURNFUL. IT WAS
[1:31:06] unbelief in a home that ONCE HAD JOY,
[1:31:09] HAD PEACE, HAD HOSPITALITY. BUT LET ME
[1:31:12] SAY IT LIKE THIS. FAITH IS SENSITIVE TO
[1:31:15] THE ATMOSPHERE. FAITH IS SENSITIVE TO
[1:31:17] THE ATMOSPHERE. GEORGIE CARTER HAD A
[1:31:20] HOME THAT WAS FULL OF FAITH AT ONE TIME
[1:31:23] AND SHE GOT INTO A CONDITION BECAUSE
[1:31:25] SOMEBODY DID HER WRONG. SOMEBODY MESSED
[1:31:28] UP.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; But she did not become a victim
[1:31:34] of what happened to her in her life. SHE
[1:31:38] CHANGED HER ENVIRONMENT BY HER FAITH.
[1:31:41] YOU SEE, FAITH IS NOT BORN IN
[1:31:44] COMFORTABLE SITUATIONS. FAITH IS BORN IN
[1:31:47] THE DARKEST OF CONTRAST.
[1:31:52] Even Jesus
[1:31:54] come to a position and waited until the
[1:31:58] environment had fully exposed man's
[1:32:02] limitation so that he could show his
[1:32:05] divine power.
[1:32:08] And when he got to that spot, he found
[1:32:11] one heart that still believed.
[1:32:18] We could look at a little girl,
[1:32:21] Mary,
[1:32:22] 16 years old,
[1:32:25] but she was born to believe.
[1:32:29] She had heard a word from an angel that
[1:32:32] she was going to bring forth a child,
[1:32:34] and she was going to call his name
[1:32:36] Jesus. and he was going to save his
[1:32:38] people from her sins. She was 16 years
[1:32:41] old, but she still believed.
[1:32:48] My word, the prophet said it like this,
[1:32:51] "He that hath an ear, let him hear what
[1:32:53] the spirit saith unto the churches." How
[1:32:55] tragic is it that this first age did not
[1:32:58] listen to the spirit. Instead, it
[1:33:00] listened to man. But thank God in this
[1:33:02] last age, there will be a group rise up.
[1:33:04] The true bride of the last day, she will
[1:33:07] listen to the spirit in that day of
[1:33:09] GROSS DARKNESS. THE LIGHT WILL return by
[1:33:11] the pure word. And we will return to the
[1:33:14] power of Pentecost to welcome back the
[1:33:16] Lord Jesus. You see, IT WAS JUST MARTHA
[1:33:19] OUT THERE WHEN SHE HEARD that Jesus was
[1:33:21] coming. AND SHE WALKS out there in the
[1:33:23] city of Bethany. And all of them people
[1:33:26] said, "There she is." That woman that
[1:33:28] believed that Jesus was a healer. and
[1:33:30] she walked right past him and she went
[1:33:32] down there and there's the Sadducees and
[1:33:34] the Pharisees and they're looking at her
[1:33:36] and said, "Do you still believe that
[1:33:38] Jesus is a healer?" But when she came to
[1:33:41] Jesus, she said, "Even now, Lord, I
[1:33:44] believe that you're so much God," she
[1:33:47] still believed IN THE MIDST OF IT ALL.
[1:33:50] YOU SEE, IT WAS A MARTHA, BUT THERE WAS
[1:33:52] GOT TO COME A MARY, TOO. THE PROPHET
[1:33:55] said that the bridegroom CALL WILL COME
[1:33:58] RIGHT through this when the son of man
[1:34:00] will come down and come in human flesh
[1:34:03] to unite the two together. The church
[1:34:05] has to BE THE WORD. NOTICE IN JOHN 11,
[1:34:09] NOBODY ELSE writes this
[1:34:12] but John under the eagle anointing
[1:34:15] begins to write this that in verse 28
[1:34:18] THAT WHEN SHE HAD SO SAID SHE WENT HER
[1:34:21] WAY and called Mary her sister secretly
[1:34:25] saying the master is come and calleth
[1:34:28] FOR THEE. IF YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THAT'S
[1:34:30] THE THIRD POLE. IT'S A SECRET WORK THAT
[1:34:33] NOBODY ELSE IS NOT TO KNOW ANYTHING
[1:34:36] ABOUT IT. THE PROPHET SAID WHEN HE'S
[1:34:38] PREACHING THE SEVENTH SEAL, he said
[1:34:39] there's a secret that lays beyond that.
[1:34:43] What was it? You look in 1956 and
[1:34:46] brother Random starts talking about the
[1:34:47] tent vision. He starts talking about the
[1:34:49] three pools. And he said, notice, he
[1:34:52] said, NOTICE, HE SAID, I WILL MEET you
[1:34:54] in there. That will be your third pole.
[1:34:56] But when he goes up there to Zabina
[1:34:58] Cannon and there drops a sword in his
[1:35:01] hands. The word of the Lord spoke to him
[1:35:03] SAYS, "DON'T FEAR. THAT'S just that's
[1:35:06] just the vindication of your ministry.
[1:35:10] It is THE THIRD PULL. WHAT WAS IT? IT'S
[1:35:13] EXACTLY WHAT DAVID SAID IN PSALMS 27.
[1:35:17] ONE THING HAVE I DESIRED OF THE LORD
[1:35:20] THAT WILL I SEEK AFTER, THAT I MAY DWELL
[1:35:23] IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD ALL THE DAYS OF
[1:35:25] MY LIFE, TO BEHOLD the beauty of the
[1:35:27] Lord, AND TO INQUIRE IN HIS TEMPLE. FOR
[1:35:30] IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; HE SHALL HIDE ME IN HIS PAVILION. In the
[1:35:36] SECRET OF HIS TABERNACLE SHALL HE HIDE
[1:35:39] ME IN THE SECRET OF IT.
[1:35:43] What is it? Brother Brandham said
[1:35:45] there's three layers to the third pole
[1:35:47] to the seventh seal. He said I don't
[1:35:49] know nothing about it. What is it? It's
[1:35:51] the day and the hour of the coming of
[1:35:53] the Lord. It is IN SECRET OF HIS
[1:35:56] TABERNACLE. SHALL HE HIDE ME? SHALL HE
[1:35:59] SET ME UPON A ROCK? HE HID IT AND
[1:36:02] REVEALED IT BY HIS SECRET.
[1:36:06] You remember when the prophet he started
[1:36:10] talking about Romeo and Juliet?
[1:36:13] He said now he said notice. He said
[1:36:16] there she was up there in her quarters.
[1:36:20] He said and oh Romeo threw his ladder up
[1:36:24] there.
[1:36:25] Threw his ladder up there against the
[1:36:27] wall. And he said,
[1:36:30] he said, 'It's a secret thing. He said,
[1:36:33] 'Honey, I'm here, Juliet, I'm here.' He
[1:36:37] said, notice, he said, when the Lord
[1:36:39] comes in a twinkling of an eye, it'll be
[1:36:41] a secret coming. THE REST OF THE WORLD
[1:36:44] WON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT. HE'LL COME
[1:36:46] AS A THIEF IN A NIGHT. IT'S BEEN A LONG
[1:36:49] TIME, BUT SHE STILL BELIEVES. IT'S BEEN
[1:36:52] A FEW MOMENTS SINCE HE SAID HE WAS
[1:36:55] COMING, BUT SHE STILL BELIEVES.
[1:37:00] Do you hear the wagon wheels?
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. You know good and
[1:37:05] well that the rancher son told you he
[1:37:06] was coming back for you. Are you still
[1:37:09] believing? And you got the rest of your
[1:37:11] cousins up there mocking you on the
[1:37:13] street, mocking you, saying, "What are
[1:37:15] you doing all that for? Why are you up
[1:37:17] there WORKING LIKE THAT? WHY are you up
[1:37:19] there DOING ALL THAT? WHY ARE YOU
[1:37:20] PREPARING LIKE THAT? BECAUSE a bride do
[1:37:23] ONLY HIS WILL. SHE HAS THUS SAYAITH THE
[1:37:26] LORD." OR SHE KEEPS STILL. THAT LITTLE
[1:37:28] GROUP THEN, THAT TRUE SEAT OF THE WORD
[1:37:31] OF GOD WILL PRESENT CHRIST A BELOVED
[1:37:34] BRIDE, A VIRGIN, a virgin of his word,
[1:37:37] the word of his PROMISE IN HIMSELF LIKE
[1:37:39] IT WAS IN MARY, GOD HIMSELF MADE
[1:37:42] MANIFEST. HE WILL ACT HIMSELF by his own
[1:37:46] word of promise.
[1:37:49] He's going to have a people
[1:37:54] to be honest. Leona has thrown a whole
[1:37:57] lot at you.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; And you still believe.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that have lost
[1:38:08] their faith. There's a lot of people
[1:38:10] that have walked away. They have sealed
[1:38:13] their doom by not receiving the seal of
[1:38:15] the Holy Ghost. But you still believe.
[1:38:20] I know it's not thought of to be a great
[1:38:22] thing, but you still believe of laying
[1:38:25] hands on the sick
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; and they shall recover. You still
[1:38:29] believe in casting out demons in the
[1:38:31] name of Jesus Christ. I know it's a very
[1:38:34] unusual thing and people get so
[1:38:37] misunderstood about praise and worship,
[1:38:40] but you still believe that God deserves
[1:38:43] all the praise, the honor, and the
[1:38:45] glory. WHY? BECAUSE YOU are his children
[1:38:49] and you cannot produce anything EXCEPT
[1:38:52] FOR WHAT GOD HAS ALREADY DEPOSITED ON
[1:38:55] THE INSIDE OF YOU. LET ME SAY THIS TO
[1:38:58] YOU. Now is the time to praise and to
[1:39:00] worship
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; because THE PROPHET SAID AFTER THE SEALS
[1:39:04] IS OPEN EVERYTHING will be worship b
[1:39:08] then
[1:39:12] you say brother Andrew.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; I wasn't born in a church that shouts
[1:39:18] like you.
[1:39:21] Get out of that environment.
[1:39:25] Well, brother Andrew, I don't I don't
[1:39:27] get it. Why do you dance?
[1:39:31] Well, if you was in the environment that
[1:39:34] I was in.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Well, really, what environment is that?
[1:39:42] Well, it's a Bible environment.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; We is talking to our girls on the way to
[1:39:47] church. We don't do anything here unless
[1:39:50] it's backed up by this Bible. Amen.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; We gave a we gave a little prayer cloth
[1:39:55] to somebody and they didn't receive it
[1:39:57] too well and I don't know what they'll
[1:39:59] do with it or whatever. But the reason
[1:40:00] why we still believe in prayer cloth
[1:40:03] ministry is because it's in the Bible.
[1:40:05] The reason why we still preach baptism
[1:40:08] in the name of Jesus Christ is because
[1:40:11] it's in the Bible. The reason why we
[1:40:13] preach serpent seed, IT'S BECAUSE IT'S
[1:40:16] IN THE BIBLE. THE REASON WHY WE PREACH
[1:40:18] IN OLDFASHIONED HOLY GHOST PENTECOSTAL
[1:40:21] HOLINESS IS BECAUSE IT'S IN THE BIBLE.
[1:40:24] THE REASON WHY WE SING BEFORE WE PREACH
[1:40:26] IS BECAUSE IT'S IN THE BIBLE.
[1:40:28] [screaming] THE REASON WE TAKE UP TITHES
[1:40:30] AND OFFERING IS BECAUSE IT'S IN THE
[1:40:33] BIBLE.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; WELL, WE HAVE A RESTORED WORD, SO WE
[1:40:40] OUGHT TO BELIEVE THIS BIBLE. [cheering]
[1:40:43] [applause]
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Let's stand. People
[1:40:51] have criticized you.
[1:40:55] They have made fun of you.
[1:40:58] They have lied on you. They have said
[1:41:01] ungodly things about you.
[1:41:05] They said, "You're doing the wrong
[1:41:06] thing. You shouldn't be dressing
[1:41:09] yourself in the robes of this message."
[1:41:14] But you're still here.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; You're still dressing yourself
[1:41:20] in the unfailing body word. You're still
[1:41:23] doing it because you still believe.
[1:41:28] You let Satan come in one time
[1:41:32] and you think that he can't get to you.
[1:41:35] He got to Eve in a perfect paradise.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Perfect.
[1:41:40] No sin, no doubt. And he got to her.
[1:41:46] What are you just saying, brother
[1:41:47] Andrew? I'm saying if it wasn't for this
[1:41:50] word, Satan have done got you.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; If it wasn't for the fornication of this
[1:41:54] Holy Ghost, Satan would have done got
[1:41:56] you. He got her in a perfect Eden.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; But he will not get you in Satan's Eden.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE WILL NOT GET YOU.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; THIS IS A MESSED UP WORLD. THIS IS SATAN
[1:42:10] CHEATING. BUT HE WILL NOT GET YOU TO
[1:42:13] DISBELIEVE THIS MESSAGE. WHY? BECAUSE
[1:42:16] YOU WERE BORN TO BELIEVE IT.
[1:42:20] MY IDENTITY IS NOT HOMER FRASER'S
[1:42:23] IDENTITY. MY IDENTITY IS NOT RON
[1:42:26] SPENCER'S SON. MY IDENTITY IS THE
[1:42:29] IDENTITY OF A BELIEVER.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Can you still believe it?
[1:42:40] Can you really believe it?
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; When peer pressure gets on you young
[1:42:45] boys
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; start looking like the world, dressing
[1:42:49] like the world, listen to music like the
[1:42:51] world. Can you still believe
[1:42:54] what this prophet taught?
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; I was hoping for one of them shouting
[1:42:59] meetings. Oh, it'll make you shout.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; It will. I promise you. I promise you it
[1:43:03] will. Amen.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; I was sure hoping I sure hoping we'd
[1:43:07] have one of them dancing services.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, it to make you dance.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Because when you believe this,
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; when you believe this, it'll take this
[1:43:15] environment and put it in that
[1:43:16] environment up there. And you think I
[1:43:19] shout here because of preaching of the
[1:43:21] word. You wait till I get there.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; You wait till I get there, brother Matt.
[1:43:25] And all of a sudden, THE THINGS THAT I
[1:43:27] THOUGHT, THE PEOPLE THAT I THOUGHT THAT
[1:43:29] WOULD NOT BE THERE BECAUSE THEY DID NOT
[1:43:31] BELIEVE IT, BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET IN.
[1:43:33] LET ME SAY THIS TO YOU. HEAVEN WILL BE
[1:43:36] FULL OF PEOPLE THAT you do not expect to
[1:43:38] be there.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; And I'll never give up on you.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; IT'LL MAKE ME SHOUT KNOWING THAT A
[1:43:46] 90YEAR-OLD WOMAN WAS UP THERE BEYOND THE
[1:43:49] CURTAIN OF TIME AND SHE LOOKED LIKE SHE
[1:43:51] WAS PAST HER PRIME TO RECEIVE THE LORD
[1:43:53] JESUS CHRIST. BUT IN A MOMENT,
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; SHE STILL BELIEVED.
[1:43:59] SHE WAS ON THAT SIDE BECAUSE
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; SHE believed it.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Let me say this to you. Things get tough
[1:44:07] sometimes when you're preaching. And I
[1:44:09] get to thinking, why in the world? The
[1:44:11] Lord give me this thought in April and
[1:44:15] it just now let me preach it.
[1:44:19] And I thought, why now, Lord?
[1:44:22] Sometimes as a pastor, Brother Jeffrey,
[1:44:23] you get to looking at things like, why
[1:44:25] right now? Why does he want me to preach
[1:44:28] this right now?
[1:44:31] It's because somebody needs
[1:44:32] encouragement to still believe it.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Sometimes they need to check up.
[1:44:38] Sometimes they need to look over,
[1:44:40] tighten up the armor a little bit.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; I'll be honest with you. When I'm
[1:44:44] sitting in my study and I start and the
[1:44:47] Lord starts putting them things
[1:44:48] together, I say, "Oh Lord,
[1:44:50] it going to hurt. They ain't going to
[1:44:52] love me."
[1:44:56] But I'll tell you this, a real [music]
[1:44:58] seed cannot be deceived.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; A real seed will SAY AMEN TO THE WORD OF
[1:45:03] GOD.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; A REAL SEED WILL SAY THAT'S NOTHING BUT
[1:45:06] THE TRUTH.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; I say let us live it.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. It ain't good enough
[1:45:13] just to read it.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; It ain't good just good enough to have
[1:45:16] it in our home.
[1:45:18] Do you still believe it?
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight. And brother
[1:45:22] Matthew, [music] want you to sing for
[1:45:23] us? I believe,
[1:45:28] oh Lord.
[1:45:30] I believe
[1:45:35] all things are possible.
[1:45:41] Lord, I
[1:45:44] believe. [music]
[1:45:48] Only [singing]
[1:45:50] [music]
[1:45:51] believe.
[1:45:55] Oh, [singing]
[1:45:57] [music]
[1:45:58] believe
[1:46:02] all [singing] things are possible.
[1:46:06] [music]
[1:46:08] Only
[1:46:11] believe.
[1:46:15] Oh,
