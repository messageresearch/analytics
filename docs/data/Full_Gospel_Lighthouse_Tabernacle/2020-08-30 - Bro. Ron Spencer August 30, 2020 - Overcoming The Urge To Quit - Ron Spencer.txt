flags to show that they were behind him and they were his subjects and the teachers turned all the fellows out and after king passed by all the little children in a certain school returned but one

on the right side to god [Music] hallelujah amen i'm not gonna try to dare even touch that this morning so amen you can be seated for a few moments and amen god bless you good to see each and every one of you amen we love you with all of our hearts not just a saiyan but we really do we mean that amen amen don't you just look over at your neighbor and just tell them i love you with all my heart and i don't take it the wrong way if it's a amen hey matches husband and wife i want you to really really mean that and so amen i think andrew sung that song for me this morning i didn't tell him but i i told connie i i said if there was ever a morning that i could just kind of just set this one out i believe i would set this one out it was one of those days to where that you're just kind of having trouble getting your feet right in front of each other so so if i kind of stumble along a little bit this morning you kind of just bear with me and so got a little bit of a reason for it but that's just how it is kind of interesting i'm going to preach on overcoming the urge to quit amen amen so so here we are amen i have to i have to step up in this case amen we we normally this time of year we we gather our little ones that are going to go to school not just the little ones but everybody that's affiliated with school we have them to come and stand close and and we pray over them and uh we'll do it a little bit different this year but we want to still do it and maybe we'll just have you stand in your place where you are in just a couple of moments but we're living in different times i personally believe that we're just before the coming of the lord there's a lot of camouflage events that will go on to camouflage our going home and because we're we're quite a number of people that will take a rapture and yet the world won't even notice it amen how better to do it with people that are that are shut in their homes and their neighbors don't even hardly care and that's kind of the age that we're living in and we're living in an age to where that the world is falling apart and it's almost mind-boggling as we're watching it fall apart and it's in political realms it's in uh realms of schools and all kinds of ideologies and it's not just in america it's all over the world so this is a thing that's sweeping all over the world and yet we're dealing with a deadly storms and we're dealing with we're we're dealing with deadly diseases and you know it's a it's a conspiracy till it hits your house you know you hear you hear a lot of rattling going on well it's just a conspiracy well just as soon as it comes to your house it's not a conspiracy no more we even have a have a bug going on here that's got a lot of cough that's involved in it we don't know for sure what it is but we're wanting to be very cautious with it and so uh i don't have it but brother joe's sister ruth ann has that and several of the family there has it and and i i want to very much be praying for them that god would just touch them in a supernatural way and it not be coveted and that's that's what we're praying for amen so many are fighting that disease in such a wicked way there's a scripture that i want to i want to share with you and for those of you that's been here quite a while you know this is my favorite scripture and it's psalms 91. and the reason i read psalms 91 is is because it is a it's a scripture of not just power but it's also a scripture of guarding for us and protecting for us and it's a covenant between god and and his people and so and so i've read it and i i've read it almost every day of my life and and that's been a real comfort to me it's been a real strength to me and i had somebody after i said that one time and after a service somebody came to me and said well you've read that scripture almost every day of your life and look what happened to you all those events that happened to you i said well what would have i went through if i hadn't read it you know sometimes you got to look at the cup half full instead of that cup half empty amen i'd like for you to read it with me since that that uh we'll we'll do this this morning and if you can put that up on the screen psalms 91 i'll read the first verse and you as an audience brother andrew if you'll lead the audience in the second verse he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty i will save the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god and him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowl and from the noise and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his troops shall be thy skilled and buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor of the arrow that flieth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday a thousand shall file at thy side and ten thousand at their right hand but it shall not come nigh thee only with thine eyes shall thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made thee the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come now thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against the stone thou shall not doubt shalt tread upon the lion and the adder and the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet as he hath set his love upon me therefore i deliver him i will set him on high because he had known my name he shall call upon me and i will answer him i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honor him long life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation amen amen if all of our everybody that is even being taught at home or teaching at home or whatever that school bus drivers cooks aids all of that if you

your love and your cards and as we celebrated another birthday a milestone and i was really happy to celebrate this one and i lived to see it amen my if the lord don't come back i'd like to live to see another one and we're just certainly thankful for all your gifts and all of the kindness and there were some things that were just such a blessing to us and and we thank you for that and i'll just share one sister mary sister mary she she she made me a quilt and it was very beautiful and it had an eagle flying near near where the four presidents are engraved in rock and i almost saw my picture in that and so uh oh teddy's right in there and so and i thought it was so great and and it had uh had pine trees on it and and caribou and those different animals associated with the message and then at the bottom it had it had what we was told by the lord if you'll trust me i'll use you like never before and then then she even had the inscription at the bottom of it he spoke to me like a gentleman and i just tell you that was such a wonderful gift and so we thank you for those things and we appreciate your love and your kindness and everything that you do for us you mean so much and and uh we love you and uh we thank you for that amen he's good to us isn't he amen for those that don't know our connection with sister angela and you you've you're on the internet and you don't know it sister angela's uh her dad's name ronaldine lilly and uh and we've been ronald deans together for a long long time and and she was very close to my mother and she actually saw the vision the day that i was going to be an explosion and she actually made contact with my mom and then made contact with me i was in richmond and she told me how are you and i told her fine she said well i saw you in an explosion and so i said no i'm fine i'm i'm very fine and so that was some 12 years ago and god saw to it that somebody was praying for me and saw it was coming before it actually came and so she's been a very dear friend of our family for a long time sister sandy we're so glad to have her here with us and she's just one of us now and and we don't have a book here that says it puts her name on it but if we had a book she's right on it so so we certainly love her with all of our hearts and and we so appreciate you making them at home amen amen i'm going to preach a sermon that every one of you have felt every one of you have felt a part of this in your life i don't know if i've ever heard it preached on quite like this but i'm going to preach it this morning just kind of the way that he's dealt with me to preach on it if you will turn with me to luke chapter 22 and verse 31 i'd like to speak to you on the urge to quit now you can be honest and say brother ron i've been there done that and got that t-shirt you can go ahead and say it you yeah amen because you're you're in some good company so anyone that would be a critic i'm going to get you in just a few minutes and so amen luke chapter 22 and verse 31 and the lord said simon simon lead disciple spokesman of the church satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but i have prayed for thee that thy faith failed not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren and he said unto him lord i am ready to go with thee both to prison and to death and this is jesus talking and he said i tell thee peter the crop the shall not crow this day before thou hast thrice denied that you know me that's quite a powerful reading i want to read the lord's prayer before we get too deep into this because we need it and after this man i pray therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this daily bread as and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory forever amen you may be seated jesus would deal with this subject and jesus said unto them no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god quitting quitting whatever the reason is maybe it's too much pressure maybe it's just exhausted maybe it's just frustrated maybe it's the lack of commitment maybe it's just to flee or to run shirk responsibility why do i have to have all the load why am i going through all of this running away from responsibility maybe it's just a refusal to train because as a christian you're in training maybe you want an easier way but god didn't design for you an easier way maybe it's to escape at all maybe it's just i'm playing more out sometimes there's a fatigue to where a fella don't have to want to put a foot in front of the other maybe you're just wiped out you've heard the statement i'm burnout maybe it's because some of the things that you went through i thought last night's sermon was perfect as a prelude to today but nobody cares about me nobody loves me nobody understands me have i hit any just so far in the first 60 seconds have i hit anybody here go ahead let's go ahead and put our hands up just for a little bit there just for a moment yeah i believe i'm preaching to the right audience you took you took a right at the right place sister connie nobody cares nobody understands now as long as you're a spectator as long as you're just watching and by association and there's no skin in involved the devil will leave you okay maybe even when you were in sin you you thought that you were a spot at a spot to wear that you know i'm getting along fine because the scripture said that sin is pleasurable for a season i mean some of you didn't look like you were in misery and shackles and chains and everything when you were doing it out in the world when you thought you was god in your life there was literally angels watching over you to keep you out of the muck and the mire a lot of times you would have went too far if god hadn't been right there with you he was watching over you and you were a child of god though you didn't know it or act like it or not are you with me and there are times that you just like to say well i quit i'm going back to the way that i had and you were a mess at that spot and you want to go back there i don't want to have a day without god the devil will leave you all right in that spot but here every one of you'll get involved but the very moment that you start raising your head and saying i'm a christian then all hell breaks loose can you say amen right there quitting is an urge it's an urge every champion has felt it i was brother uh gabriel was really relating to me this week that some of the greatest trainers in the world that they begin to train people and they're pulling everything that they can pull out of people when you feel like you can't go another step you've only burned 70 percent of your energy there's still a reserve of 30 percent more but you got to break through the barrier now understand this every prophet has felt the urge to quit jesus felt the urge to quit three times in the garden of gethsemane let this cup pass from me are you with me now no home no wife no family everybody was a critic around him just a small congregation that was with him he didn't have an incredible amount of people applauding him every day and encouraging him every day he did not have a pier brother branham felt like walking away and i might get a lot of critics like there but why did he want to go to the mountains to stay and if god if you've got me to be a prophet i'll come down out of the mountains say the word of the lord and then go back up in the mountains pressures of life had put him in a spot until he wanted to go to the mountains to where he was alone but god had to personally tell him if you go up there i'll leave you your wife will leave you your children will leave you come on just god's saying i'll leave is enough every president has felt like quitting you know our one of our greatest presidents was abraham lincoln he suffered defeat in 11 different elections you would think at a spot he would say okay i've had enough okay i've had enough okay i've had enough but something was driving him now his personal family he and his wife's relationship was shipwrecked sermon is not about abraham lincoln and neither is it about marriage but the reason that he was constantly a traveler he loved to travel and talk to people loved to give speeches he worked for the railroad as a lawyer and they were pushing him to become the president of the united states of america and he said one of his greatest disappointments was he had to live with his wife in the same house every king has felt like quitting even the very lion l-i-o-n the king of the jungle will sometimes begin to show that he feels like quitting every winner has felt like quitting every soldier has felt like quitting every victorious person has felt like i just feel like quitting now quitting will cause you to not finish throwing up your hands and quitting and saying i i i just don't want to i just don't want to go on anymore there was a boxer that became famous for saying no mas nomas he had a spectacular career but he is known for the fight to wear that he said i don't want no more he had been whipped to the point to where that he he couldn't handle no more didn't want to be hit again in his life at that point my understanding he had won 72 fights and held many championships but he is known for i quit i don't want that to be mine in your i don't want to run this race for 30 to 40 years and because of a trial to come to a spot to say i quit i give up i was speaking to a minister this week and he was asking me if i was going to speak this weekend i i told him what the lord was dealing with me he said brother ron you of all people could speak to this subject because you've been in spots over the last months that the public don't and i told him this i said let me just say i understand why cancer patients going chemo or immunotherapy or just being sick every day having the flu every day of your life feeling like you can't get up stepping just feel like saying i'm quit i'm done god come take me home i understand wow i understand why that they would say i don't know if i can make it another day i don't know if i can go on another day but for if you're watching this morning and you're in that same situation and you're going through chemo or you're going through a horrible disease and you just feel like i just quit i'm just going to give up let me just say this to you there's too much living to give up for [Applause] i look at my grandchildren i look at my wife i i look at the god that i serve and the people that encourage me from around the world i'm not alone in this battle i'm not alone there's thousands of angels that are with me in this battle not just ron spencer but they're with you in this battle this battle is not even yours it's god's hallelujah i said this before we even started i've been sick before and i made it i've been broke before and i made it find it interesting this came to me before i even got started in this battle i've been brokenhearted before but i made it i cried all night long but i made it i've been betrayed but i made it i've been lied on but i made it i've been destitute but i made it i've been rejected but i made it but i want to say to you i made it this morning the scripture that continues to come to our hearts is no weapon that is formed against us shall prosper philippians says it like this being confident of this very thing that he which had begun a good work in us will perform it until the day of jesus christ god's what he started he's not going to quit the scripture says i can do all things through christ which strengthens me hallelujah finally my brethren paul writes this from prison finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might and put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and against powers and against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places jude 1 24 says it like this now unto him that is able to keep you from falling hallelujah i'll be up there unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with excellent exceedingly joy i want you to read that with me if you can now unto him that is able to keep you from falling do you believe that so it's not you that's hanging on so many people say well i'm just having a tough time being a christian really well you've left the wrong man be leading you oh brother ron it's just so hard to be a christian really if you really get born again and you realize this scripture right here you are not the one that is holding on it is him through you since i've become a christian i've never had to have rehab i've never looked back i was a raggedy old boy but i've never looked back i've never went back and had to tamper with none of those things god has kept me well brother ron i followed that's because you took your hands out of jesus's hands and you fail don't blame it on god boy this good this is really good my brethren james chapter 1 verse 2 my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diver's temptation knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and and in an entire nothing warning nothing james 1 12 blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he has tried he shall receive the crown of life and the lord who hath promised to to them that love him let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither triumph he any man but every man is when he's tempted when he is drawn away in his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death i do i don't have this quote in front of me but brother branham said said said women sometimes don't like to hear hear the the dress preached on but the moment they make a decision to go a whirlier way he said they send their self down a road and that road has bad consequences to it let me just say this to you you choose your path in your life and you may be headed down that road i don't know where you're at but you may be headed down that road but you don't have to continue to go there turn around [Applause] swallow your your pride don't make your own pride take you to hell don't make peer pressure take you to hell oh but brother ron this is such a good friend and if it's taking you away from god i don't care if it's husband wife i don't care if it's affiliate in life or business partner if you're they're taking you away from god in life they're not your friend they're not your friend they're only an advocate for the devil to pull you away from god and they're taking you in a wrong direction i want that to settle in because sometimes we have to make some really difficult choices and in those choices we have to come to a spot to where that we have to look at them and say we can't walk the same road together i'll know you as a business partner and i'll know you as an associate friend but we can't be muslim friends and we can't have allies that's going to take us into eternity i can't let you make me drowned but brother ron i feel like that's my brother or i'm saying this for somebody i don't know who it is but it's landed but i'm saying this sometimes you have to make a an eternal arrangement and you have to look at it and say hey i'm headed in the wrong direction and i can't carry you abraham had to look at lot and say let there be no strife but if you choose to go that way i'm going this way if you choose to go this way i'm going that way now god had told him he had to do it and god allowed lot to make the choice you've heard this all across this audience before you ever came to church the road to hell was paved with good intentions if the people that had told me that they would be in this church that they want to come they want to come they're going to be here i'm making a promise i'm going to be in church if they would come and be every weekend people we would need a cathedral to the road but it's a scriptural deal 500 people jesus asked to go to the upper room i don't know how you miss it 380 people two-thirds almost decided they had something better to do than go to the upper room they watched the ascension of jesus they watched jesus lift up into the heavens an angel spoke back to them given them instructions go to the upper room because you need the holy ghost in your life jesus had just explained to them acts chapter 1 you have to have the holy ghost i'm leaving i'm going to send you a comforter i'm going to come and live inside of you you're going to be the temple that i'm going to live in 380 people said i quit i don't know how long those people we don't have a book of them do you know what those people are never mentioned again in the scriptures sometimes when people walk away from you they they think they destroy your world really they was nothing but an anchor on you now your boat can go on come on they were a spiritual drain on you are you with me i'm going to say it like it is you may have friends in your world that are nothing but a spiritual drain on you and they drain you of your prayers they drain you of your spiritual energy but if you could only have the fortitude this morning say i quit carrying you there's going to be some things that we're going to quit this morning i'm gonna quit supporting the devil i'm [Applause] gonna i'm not going to call a name it wasn't here but somebody on the internet might know i was praying for somebody on their dying bed and their concern was for their children that had never connected in life they were not mentally afflicted they were physically okay they just never started in life these individuals are 30 some years old and they were literal bums i'm gonna say it like i i took that pill this morning just literal bums in life they had never decided to take life for real this let me just say this to you while i'm here every one of us have the same 24 hours every one of us have the same 24 hours what you do with your 24 hours is that totally up to you but donald trump does not have 24 hours 10 minutes only got 24 hours what he has made out of his life is because of grit determination attitude whatever he's probably crazy because he's doing what he can doing i would probably go and if i owned all of the golf courses i would be on a golf cart every day i wouldn't have the media screaming in my ear he's got more money than he can stand but i'm glad he's supporting the parts i'm glad he's doing that he called all of his men in a few few days ago whether you read this or not and he just told them around him they set the oval office full and he said okay what if i just quit what if i just walk out of this office and say i don't need this job anymore what if i just walk away is any of you prepared to take my place what if i said i've had enough of the media and my critics what if i said i quit it's a legitimate question now if he does it tomorrow don't you call me a prophet now i'm just i'm just you know sometimes we almost do that brother ron you're so far off your ark or you don't know who you are okay well ezekiel told god this he said god the sermons that you're given to me are a reproach to me my own people hate me for preaching they don't want to hear what i've got to say you can hear brother abraham say these same words the more i come back and preach to you the more bob heard women than i see the you know and he would preach to audiences and they didn't want to hear it in one place they literally lit up their cigarettes and and set back there with disrespect one particular one the masterpiece sermons is is the people that were taking care of the the banquet they just started taking up the plates right while he was preaching you know our deacons would be all over that our deacons would be flipping out if somebody started going through the rows and started cleaning and you know and hey a baby can scream 10 seconds too long and nurse people all over the audience going i don't want to take it baby out so much so check out my don't bother me but i would say samson felt like this at a grind grinding meal when little children parents would bring little children to spit across the mill and spit down on the champion of israel and they'd spit on him and they'd bring him there and they'd spit on him history tells us that they would bring their little children or raise their little children up and they'd spit on that man that's now blind i'd say there's days that he really regretted the sin that had brought him to this condition without the new birth let me just say this to you without the new birth you'll be hounded by the sins that you've got in in an amazing the devil can talk you into doing a lot of things and then persecute you and haunt you and those things destroy your health listen there's no peace at the bottle of a beer there's no peace at the bottom of a liquor joint there's no peace with another woman or another man they all got the same equipment let me just say it like that lest it's conceived it brings forth sin but it'll destroy your life it'll destroy your marriage it'll destroy your relationships with your children but at the moment you feel the urge to quit and give up elijah climbed up in a cave elijah climbed under a juniper tree moses walked into a desert for 40 years ezekiel told god said i just quit but you hear we sing the song it was like a fire shut up in his bones after a while you decide i'm going to quit well sermons ain't going to quit coming to you i quit i'm just going to sit down sermons ain't going to quit coming and so after a while he couldn't just preach to himself okay i'm gonna have to go and preach there was a man named jimmy valvano and i i can't do it justice but brain cancer had got into his life and it was destroying him and he was encouraging he was encouraging the monies to come to research that would help somebody in the future and he was saying this and it became a a statement to the world i think the espys or whatever that thing is that they do they they they they use his last statement never give up don't you never give up don't you never give up and he never gave up but brain cancer took him and i'm sorry but i've watched that speech a few times this year because there's some days that you need the inspiration you need a kick in the seat of your pants to help you to get off the couch or help you to get up and i've listened to every book and every tape and every scripture and i've listened to every great quote that i can get a hold of to be an inspiration that i can grab a hold of more than just this 200 pound frame that feels like it can't get past because there's times you're so weary in your body you don't feel like studying you don't feel like singing a glory a g for a gleeful song you just feel like that you don't have energy to move past and my amen and right here brother andrew i'm just going to share some things maybe it'll be a help to somebody else but whatever you do don't quit i'm going to be honest with you i have preached sermons in my past life that i really didn't understand but i have preached sermons like take it back and i have personally i don't like to listen to myself preach but i've listened to them for inspiration over and over and over again and heard my former self tell my sick self take it back your health is in front of you take it back [Applause] even before the battle came i was preaching sermon like courage encouragement i've had to go back and listen to that sermon to preach to me because god was speaking to me in a prophetic form i'm going to have to go through this trial you've heard me read these scriptures and and maybe i can maybe i can just finish with these scriptures or to be all right if i finish maybe this sermon next week and you've heard these scriptures a thousand times i wasn't talking about your baby silas you're going to live i think sister judy i can hear her thinking why did my baby have to cry first are you ready are you ready brother on you should be serious really laughter is good medicine life there's good medicine you need a good laugh can i share something with you that's just been a kind of a neat deal maybe this will help somebody i'll take my glasses off so i can't see you probably my most difficult day this is my most difficult day that i can remember and put them back on i get dizzy my most difficult day i think that i i went through was a was a gamma knife radiation there was other days that was very wicked but i'd been in the hospital for for almost two weeks and i'd had the brain surgery the week before and i went home and then i was right back in the hospital and and and so they had i was having a difficult day as it was i'd had a really difficult night and so they they took me down and they told me said now we're going to do a surgery before we take you to the gamma knife and we're going to put a we're going to put steel on your head that will hold your head perfectly still in the mri machine they're using it something like an mri eye machine and they put you in a tunnel and they and your your brain your brain has to be 100 steel and to get it still they use stainless steel screws about that long and they're pretty good size they're pretty large and they actually drill them into your skull you know the scripture says that it says that he will not put more on you than what you can handle how many knows that scripture but you will be surprised what you can live through and so you know they took me in and everybody was so great to me and they were talking to me and and the lady at the end of the bed she was telling me everything that they were going to do and doctors were getting ready their whole procedure of that was going to take about 10 minutes and she and she was actually from from from pilot virginia she was a nurse and she began to talk to me where where's your dad's farm and we just started talking backwards and forwards and all of a sudden she said good night and when i woke up i've never been in that much pain in my life in two minutes they bore eight holes in my head and put a contraption on me and it was all under pressure and the reason that i had such a hard time and maybe you wouldn't have to have that hard time is i just had brain surgery and they needed to get this surgery done quick enough that it might save my life and they felt like this was a life-saving procedure but i've never been in this kind of pain i've been in a lot of pain i've had my back broke i've been hit by lightning i've been bit i've had strokes i've had different things in my life but i've never been to nothing like this never been in this kind of pain never never never never never never and so now they're put they're they're taking me to the next pushing me down the halls and taking me to the next place to where i'm going to be at taking me in and and uh i go by sister connie and she's eating breakfast and it kind of reminds me of going beyond the curtain of time she's eating breakfast and she's sitting over eating breakfast and she's talking to somebody on the phone and i'm going blondie blondie but the bed didn't stop she didn't hear me and i'm going down and i've never been in this kind of pain and they pulled me up and they pulled me in a spot and finally i got myself at some peace and i told the nurse and he was a therapist and i told him i said man i gotta have some help he said understand i got help on the way shot number one shot number two shot number three and now i'm starting to calm down a little bit so we start talking and he's the son of a baptist preacher he's he's my age he's chew he tells me all about his children you don't have time for me to tell you those stories but but i can remember them for you this morning and you know and there's another lady sitting over there and she's got tumor in her head and she's got five more in her body and they're going to they're going to give her all of the gamma ray that morning and this guy's been doing it for about 20 years and he set him there and he said man what great attitude you've got and i said yeah i said but just been in a lot of pain this morning he said oh we'll get that taken care of i said i bet you meet a lot of people here he said 20 years i'd meet i meet anywhere from three to five people a day here he said just a process he said you know cancer is a is a living organism in your body he said it's a it's an attachment of a of a demon that gets a dead cell that's bruised and he said it gets on a living cell and it begins to suck the life out of it and he said before long it begins to multiply and there's a lot of cancer in there he said now we use the term fight it or tell it to take its leave he said but cancer if you're not careful will just start spreading through the body it'll just start spreading just as quick as it can and you can start saying well i'm going to whip it i'm going to whip it he said you be careful he said you'll cause that thing to get mad and it'll run all through its body he said but you start telling it to leave he said because jesus told those demons in that man's body legion to leave he said so you do like jesus did tell them to take their leave even if they go to pigs are you with me now brother tim pruitt i was in this man's care connie came and she sat with me until i went to that spot this man began to talk to me he had prayer with us he said i know you're getting ready to go through a very difficult procedure he said i'll just pray with you if that's okay i said how does other people react here he said well i wish everybody reacted like you do or like this girl here does they had just taken her away he said you know both of you have about four months to live he said you know that i'm not giving you any news they were wrong they were wrong he said you know you don't have a bunch of family here because this was before covet he said yesterday he said i had a i had a i had a young person here about 20 years old had a spot about that big on him and he said they had an entire group of family here he said they had 20 people here he said they were bawling he said they were stressed out they were going nuts he said they were going nuts he said finally i had enough he said hold on folks i got some good news for you he's got a spot about that big he's going to die in about 40 years but if you'll take the attitude of this one over here he's gonna die probably in about four months and have the right mental attitude ever heard those words before brother brown said if you have the right mental attitude toward any divine promise of god it'll become to pass listen you can either take the attitude this thing's going to destroy you or you're going to destroy it and brother brown said you got to destroy your enemy before it destroys you if i had to go through the trial and he told me i was going through the trial he said i'll be with you i will be in you i'll never leave you to the end of the world are you with me now he knew satan was coming he knew the cancer was on the way they're having all of my children to be tested all my my children my grandchildren not my in-laws my my children that i pass my blood to because there's a chance that they're passed it to them not my wife but i passed it to them i'm supposed to go to a uh uh i don't have my brain with me now i'm supposed to go to a genetic doctor in a few few weeks and they'll discover they'll go through my dna code to find that what other kind of cancer is fighting me or my grandchildren or any other grandchildren and i thought about that i've got that covered i got that covered because on my way into that tunnel i prayed a prayer father if i have to go through and i'm going to quit with this i was going i'll use i'll give you these scriptures next week but father if i have to go through this let me be the one that breaks the cycle and i just didn't pray it for my children and my grandchildren but i prayed it for this entire audience because jesus prayed these kind of a prayers he defeated cancer that i could be set free he defeated tuperculosis that you could be set free he defeated paralyzed conditions that i could be set free greater than all of that he defeated sin let me just say this is a final statement tonight if the urge to quit continues to stay in your mind tell it to go back to the realms of the lost and stay there we are more than over [Applause] thomas i press towards the mark of the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus i want to say this to you i refuse to retreat i refuse to give up brother ron that's a bold statement knowing where you're standing knowing where i'm standing i refuse to retreat i refuse to give up you're an interesting audience and you can stand and musicians can come very interesting audience i want you to get this that's why i'm waiting the founder of this church some of you never knew but he was one of the best friends of my life and i enjoyed working with him i enjoyed him being my father-in-law i enjoyed him he was rough he was tough he had a heart 42 times the ford size of a board truck he loved you whether you knew it or not he was rough and how he told you you needed to lock the doors or clean to show you how to vacuum a floor he preached every sermon like it was the last sermon he was ever going to preach and you better get it and he made sure that you knew that you it was you because he sometimes would call your name but when it got difficult for him he sat in a wheelchair and he would take pain pills coming up that ramp that you built brother ray and he would take pain pills so he could set to the service there was no quit in him and he preached his last sermon on be ready in such an hour as you think not be ready let me just say he took every excuse to miss church and just tore it up and ripped it you're out this morning you have a legitimate reason hey i'm not picking at you but if you're sitting in bunny slippers and in your big fluffy fluffy i'm using that from doug baker so that's where and i have just preached to you feeling like i need to be in my bunny slippers if i had some but the sermon that says whatever you do don't quit if you have a bad day don't quit i want you to get this if you have a bad hour don't quit these things are going to come just don't quit the sun will come up tomorrow can i share one more thing with you and i know i know your roast is waiting and won't burn hopefully labor day is that this weekend or next weekend next weekend labor day has a very special attachment to me because there was a day there was a day in my life that i wasn't doing what's right and i was working in a meat market cutting meat and i was in a very i was in a place that a lot of people should have been ashamed of me in my life not of the shame of the grocery store but i was just in a bad way i grew up in church now i'm going to say some things that might get a little sticky but there was a lot of preachers that would want nothing to do with me even after i become converted let me just say this to you i've always been a guy that pretty suits and all kind of revelated quotes don't impress me a whole lot [Music] being better than the sinner don't impress me a whole lot i won't never have those kind of preachers preach here lazy men people that think they're more revelated than other people they'll never preach it but there was some godly men that came to me one being henry greene and dan daisley and they came in and they leaned across the meat counter and talked to me like i was somebody and they made me feel like somebody cared and i want you to know every person across this yup this audience i want you to know don't let this suit fool you there's a heart inside of this chest that no matter how bad i may feel i love you and i care for you and i'll never give up you may fall to the deepest debts i want you to understand jesus knows how to go to the bottom of yours of your holler if we could say that in the good old virginia language he knows how to go to the deepest gully there is and bring you out of it and raise you up and clean you up to where that you'll have no more come on brother greg there'll be a spot in your life you'll never want to go back and i'll leave you with this statement that has been resounding in my ear every morning this week he did not come to save the righteous he come to save sinners even isaac's hands up right now amen i love you amen isaac come on up here come on up
