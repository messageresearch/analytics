[43:21] Lord we've seen lives change Lord men
[43:24] and women Lord go in One Direction and
[43:26] this message has come across their path
[43:28] bothering their lives completely changed

[43:48] Christ will have Liberty to move Lord
[43:51] you see the direction you've given me
[43:53] for the service tonight and possibly for
[43:55] in the morning and well we just want to
[43:58] be very mindful of the spirit be
[44:00] sensitive to the direction you would
[44:01] have us to go in the words you would
[44:03] have us to speak and I will ask Lord
[44:05] tonight that you would anoint these lips
[44:06] to speak only those things that would
[44:09] edify the body
[44:10] and God I would ask that you'll anoint
[44:12] the ears of The Listener Lord that they
[44:13] can look past the veil and hear what the
[44:15] spirit of Christ would have to be said
[44:18] tonight so Lord we ask these things now
[44:20] in Jesus name
[44:22] amen and amen well we certainly honored
[44:24] to be here we greet you in the wonderful
[44:27] name of our Lord and savior I want to
[44:28] thank brother Ron and brother Andrew for
[44:30] having us
[44:31] and having confidence in us it's one
[44:33] thing to invite a man while you're here
[44:35] and and the host Pastor is here but it's
[44:37] another thing to invite a man when
[44:39] they're gone
[44:40] and so we're it just proves the
[44:42] confidence that they have in the gift
[44:44] and we're certainly thankful for that
[44:46] and I want to thank brother Gabe for his
[44:48] hosting of us uh him and Sister Sarah
[44:50] taking us to dinner last night and just
[44:52] spending time with us and sister Connie
[44:54] thank you for the wonderful lunch and
[44:55] everything we just uh we enjoy you as a
[44:58] church body we know that our churches
[45:00] are very similar
[45:01] sister churches if you would say so I
[45:04] know that to me I'm probably not new to
[45:07] you and and a stranger to you but some
[45:09] of you are strangers to me so we're just
[45:12] glad to be here and we just want to turn
[45:13] our attention away just for a little bit
[45:15] tonight to the word and I want to speak
[45:17] to you tonight on Satan can't stop the
[45:20] change
[45:22] and as I begin to prepare for this
[45:24] several weeks back knowing that I had
[45:26] this meeting and this is a big meeting
[45:28] in my eyes preaching for brother Ron
[45:29] Spencer so it was it's big and and the
[45:33] Lord laid us on my heart and brother
[45:34] Wayne Lawson was recently at our church
[45:36] and he preached on the mystery of the
[45:38] change
[45:39] now some of you is listen to that and
[45:41] you stream being see the change for so
[45:43] many years has been a mystery but I want
[45:46] to come behind that tonight and says
[45:47] Satan can't stop this change
[45:49] he's tried year after year age after age
[45:53] and we're still here
[45:55] we're still standing God gave a promise
[45:58] I'm gonna have a body I'm going to have
[46:00] a bride Church we're here
[46:03] let's look here in John 14 and verse 1
[46:06] tonight as you turn there brother Chris
[46:08] good to see you tonight
[46:10] glad to be here so the Bible says let
[46:12] not your heart be troubled
[46:15] you believe in God believe also in me
[46:19] in my father's house are many mansions
[46:23] if it were not so I would have told you
[46:25] I go to prepare a place for you and if I
[46:29] go to prepare a place for you I will
[46:32] come again notice the promise that we
[46:36] have as a believer
[46:37] I've gone to prepare a place for you
[46:40] it's not like brother Gabe you're
[46:42] building a house but it's not that kind
[46:44] of place that you're building for Sister
[46:45] Sarah and for your future family but he
[46:48] says if I go prepare a place for you I'm
[46:51] going to come again I'm going to receive
[46:52] you to myself that where I am there you
[46:56] may be also
[46:59] and brother Brandon won't tell us as
[47:00] you're standing I want to read this
[47:01] quote he says now that sounds strange in
[47:04] a house
[47:04] he says in a house being of mansions he
[47:08] says but what is it that the time the
[47:10] King James version as a translation
[47:12] every man that had a kingdom a king he
[47:15] had his domain was his see he was called
[47:19] the father and this was called his
[47:21] household the children
[47:24] the children is his domain his house
[47:28] now I want to read here in First
[47:30] Corinthians 15 and verse 50. so as
[47:33] you're turning there just think about
[47:34] God's desires for his bride to be with
[47:36] him
[47:37] as much as you long to be there with him
[47:40] he longs to have you there with him
[47:43] see he wants you in his kingdom he's
[47:45] going to prepare this place and we have
[47:47] a promise
[47:48] that he is gone and we will come
[47:51] soon he will return back First
[47:53] Corinthians 15 and verse 50. now this I
[47:55] say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot
[47:58] inherit the kingdom of God neither doeth
[48:01] corruption inherit incorruption behold I
[48:05] show you a mystery we shall not all
[48:08] sleep but we shall be changed in a
[48:10] moment in the twinkling of an eye at the
[48:12] last Trump for the trumpet shall sound
[48:14] and the dead shall be raised
[48:16] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[48:19] for this corruptable must put on in
[48:22] corruption and this Mortal must put on
[48:25] immortality so when this corruptable
[48:28] shall I put on in corruption and this
[48:30] Mortal shall have put on immortality
[48:32] then shall be brought to pass to saying
[48:34] that is written death is swallowed up in
[48:37] Victory oh death where was I seeing o
[48:39] grave where is thy Victory The Sting of
[48:42] death is sin the strength of the law or
[48:44] the strength of sin is the law but
[48:45] thanks be to God which gives us the
[48:48] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
[48:49] therefore my beloved Brethren be you
[48:52] steadfast unmovable always abounding in
[48:55] the work of the Lord for so much as you
[48:57] know that your labor is not in vain in
[49:00] the Lord God bless you you can have your
[49:01] seats tonight
[49:03] if I get just a little bit more volume
[49:06] up here
[49:08] so like I said I want to speak to you on
[49:10] Satan cannot stop this change now this
[49:14] is tonight may be a platform for
[49:16] tomorrow morning as I may take this in
[49:18] the two-part series but we find here the
[49:21] Bible would tell us that flesh and blood
[49:24] cannot inherit the kingdom of God now I
[49:27] know many of you here tonight you've
[49:28] been Christians for a long time you've
[49:29] been Believers for a long time and maybe
[49:31] you've been filled with the Holy Ghost
[49:33] for a long time but
[49:34] just want you to know tonight that your
[49:36] flesh and blood can't inherit the
[49:37] kingdom of God
[49:39] you know the Bible says that corruption
[49:41] cannot inherit incorruption or neither
[49:45] does corruption inherent incorruption
[49:46] but he shows us some Mr we should not
[49:48] all sleep otherwise we're not all going
[49:50] to die we're not all going to go down to
[49:51] the grave but we all shall be changed
[49:54] and the Bible would tell us here for
[49:56] this corruptable must put on
[49:58] incorruption and the word must here
[50:01] means it's a need it has to it behooves
[50:04] us it has to be established as a decree
[50:07] of God for this body of ours to put on
[50:10] immortality then this body has to go
[50:13] through a change
[50:14] and they're like we drove up here
[50:15] brother Mark and we were looking and
[50:17] admiring the beauty of Virginia into
[50:19] changing the colors in the leaves and no
[50:21] matter what size can do size can't stop
[50:24] the change that's going on around us
[50:26] those leaves are going to change colors
[50:28] those leaves are going to fall off and
[50:30] the sap is going to go back into the
[50:32] ground of that tree and there's nothing
[50:33] that man can do there's nothing that
[50:36] science can do can stop that change what
[50:38] am I telling you tonight the Bible says
[50:40] that this flesh that we have that we
[50:42] were born with this place is corruptable
[50:44] but in order to take that body in order
[50:47] to go into the kingdom of God this
[50:49] body's got to be changed and I want to
[50:51] put the devil on notice tonight there
[50:52] ain't nothing that he can do to stop
[50:55] this body from changing we got a promise
[50:58] in the word this evening
[51:00] that where I am you shall be there
[51:03] you look in the mirror and you see all
[51:05] your mistakes you see all your failures
[51:07] but God doesn't see your mistake God
[51:09] sees his word God sees the victory God
[51:12] sees you already there church
[51:19] we shall be changed
[51:24] not maybe
[51:26] not hopefully some of us we you know a
[51:28] lot of times you failed and you make a
[51:30] mistake and you hope God will forgive
[51:31] you
[51:33] no church it don't operate that way God
[51:35] is a giving God a loving God a merciful
[51:37] god and God is here to forgive us God is
[51:40] here he's here to change our bodies so
[51:43] in order for these old vowel corruptable
[51:45] bodies of ours that we were born with
[51:48] for the Bible says in Psalm 51 and verse
[51:51] 5 behold I was shaping in iniquity
[51:54] and in sin did my mother conceive me so
[51:57] notice we were born in sin we were
[51:59] shaped in iniquity you came in a
[52:01] corruptible form but God already saw you
[52:04] in an Incorruptible form and the problem
[52:07] of God will tell us we may speak on this
[52:09] tomorrow you bypassed her theophany when
[52:11] you came here
[52:13] but God sent you a message to bring you
[52:15] back into that theophany body because
[52:18] God wasn't going to leave you in this
[52:19] condition God gave you a word he said
[52:21] I'm going to have a bride and she's
[52:23] going to be with our spot she's going to
[52:25] be without corruption and she's going to
[52:27] fit the mortality of this word she's
[52:29] gonna be immortal
[52:32] and so in order for these bodies to put
[52:34] on incorruption they must be changed
[52:39] and when these bodies are changed then
[52:42] it's going to be brought to pass oh
[52:43] death
[52:45] hold that you scared of many a Believer
[52:47] down Through the Ages oh death you
[52:49] threaten to take him with cancer of that
[52:51] you you threatened to take him with this
[52:53] disease and this Affliction and this war
[52:55] but somebody in the last day is going to
[52:58] stand up and say oh death where's your
[53:00] sting
[53:01] where is your Venom where is your
[53:03] Victory but thanks be to our lord Jesus
[53:06] he gives us the victory through his word
[53:11] see we are that generation
[53:14] we are that generation
[53:17] that is going to look death in the face
[53:19] and say you can't sting me
[53:22] you can't sting me
[53:24] oh my savior's already been stung and he
[53:27] pulled this thing of death out of it you
[53:29] have no power you have no power over my
[53:32] change I've been born again through the
[53:35] spirit of God
[53:36] [Music]
[53:37] [Applause]
[53:39] we are that people is going to say you
[53:41] can't destroy me
[53:45] well some of you need this tonight
[53:48] some of you came in are all depressed
[53:50] because you made a mistake but there's
[53:51] somebody says you can't destroy me that
[53:54] you can't destroy me sickness you can't
[53:57] destroy me failures you can't destroy me
[53:59] my past I'm here to tell you it can't
[54:01] destroy you tonight
[54:03] you've been changed already and you're
[54:06] just waiting for another change
[54:12] we are the people
[54:15] that is going to look at the grave
[54:17] and say you will not triumph over me
[54:20] where's your victory
[54:22] the grave has no picture over the
[54:24] believer
[54:26] oh I will not take part in you grave I'm
[54:30] not going where you are
[54:34] come on Church
[54:35] notice Generations have waited for this
[54:38] moment
[54:39] prophets have waited for this moment
[54:41] they have heard these scriptures they
[54:44] have heard about a change they have
[54:46] preached about it Through the Ages
[54:47] through seven Church ages but now you're
[54:50] here
[54:51] I said now you're here and now Society
[54:55] has finally caught up with us to where
[54:57] now these bodies can be changed now you
[55:00] see all the signs of the time and the
[55:03] prophet of God will say when you look
[55:04] out there and you see the signs out
[55:06] there Israel back in her Homeland oh
[55:08] look up for your Redemption drawers now
[55:11] God is getting ready to come and sweep
[55:14] over and have a change and he's going to
[55:15] bring you with him
[55:19] notice they've anticipated
[55:21] they've anticipated sages Great Men
[55:24] great daughters and and Believers
[55:27] Brothers of uh that we would call in
[55:29] previous ages they have waited and
[55:32] anticipated this change
[55:37] they have waited for the Rapture of the
[55:39] elect
[55:41] but we're the ones
[55:44] oh Church you may think you stumbled
[55:47] into the house of God tonight God
[55:48] brought to you because he's telling you
[55:50] you're one of the ones
[55:52] you didn't just happily happen says walk
[55:54] through the door this message happens to
[55:57] us come into contact with you no there
[55:59] was a sea place on the inside of your
[56:01] heart and that seed had to cross path
[56:03] with this word because this word is
[56:06] going to have an effect on somebody's
[56:07] life it's going to come down there and
[56:10] change their lives
[56:12] here I was a 20-something-year-old man
[56:14] on a drunken and God came down at the
[56:16] middle of the night in my car and said
[56:18] turn your car around
[56:21] oh church I made a change that night and
[56:24] I never looked back if that God can do
[56:26] it to me what can he do for you tonight
[56:28] he can change you he can change your
[56:31] course he can change the direction I'm
[56:34] going to tell you he can not only change
[56:35] that but he can change these bodies
[56:39] I say glory to God tonight I'm waiting
[56:42] for my teeth I'm anticipating my change
[56:46] now we're here
[56:48] just to play Church we're here to be
[56:50] changed
[56:52] because every service is stacking on
[56:55] more word
[56:56] more faith
[57:00] notice
[57:02] 15 and verse 51 I show you a mystery
[57:06] a secret
[57:08] it's been hidden
[57:10] for seven Church ages
[57:13] but in that seventh age
[57:15] all
[57:17] all the mysteries of God should be
[57:20] finished
[57:21] the mystery of your change
[57:23] it took a Vindicated profit to reveal to
[57:27] us the change
[57:29] and notice how many of you read psalms
[57:32] 27 how many great Scholars have read
[57:35] psalms 27 how many great men theologians
[57:38] had read psalms 27 but one placed it as
[57:41] the Rapture message
[57:43] one place it right there in the secret
[57:45] of his Tabernacle
[57:48] he's going to hide me
[57:50] he's going to hide me right there
[57:53] oh church we ain't got to worry about
[57:54] tribulation brother more we got a
[57:56] promise this bride escapes tribulation
[58:00] [Applause]
[58:01] she escapes the Wrath that is coming
[58:04] because why because she's already been
[58:06] changed
[58:09] her thinking has been changed her
[58:11] actions have been changed and I've been
[58:13] beginning ahead of myself but I'm trying

[58:38] tank he ain't gonna stop the next one

[1:00:10] [Applause]
[1:00:16] Hallelujah
[1:00:22] notice this word change
[1:00:25] it means to exchange
[1:00:28] one form
[1:00:30] for another
[1:00:32] to make different
[1:00:34] to transform
[1:00:37] now I don't know about you
[1:00:39] but when I wake up in the morning
[1:00:41] I don't want to live in this whole body
[1:00:42] forever
[1:00:46] you know
[1:00:47] man if I had it my way I wouldn't be
[1:00:49] five foot five
[1:00:52] I'd be tall dark and handsome
[1:00:58] but it is what it is
[1:01:01] I'm short cute and Stumpy
[1:01:05] hey
[1:01:10] I got an amen right here yeah
[1:01:16] but it's to be changed
[1:01:19] to change forms and the Bible how many
[1:01:21] of us can add one cubic
[1:01:24] to a stature oh if we could you'd all
[1:01:28] done tried
[1:01:31] oh yeah
[1:01:33] notice what he says this word
[1:01:34] transformed here is the Greek word
[1:01:37] metamorpho and we're going to look at
[1:01:39] that tomorrow but just briefly that
[1:01:41] means to change into another form to
[1:01:44] transfigure to transform and notice now
[1:01:47] he says in in Romans 12 and verse 1 I
[1:01:51] beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[1:01:53] mercies of God that you present your
[1:01:55] bodies
[1:01:56] notice we got to present these bodies
[1:01:58] you can't just keep keeping on sinning
[1:02:00] and going on the way you've been going
[1:02:01] no you got to present this body as a
[1:02:04] Living Sacrifice to God the Bible said
[1:02:07] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[1:02:11] reasonable service
[1:02:13] that's your responsibility let me tell
[1:02:15] you sometimes you come in the house of
[1:02:17] God you don't feel like worshiping you
[1:02:19] don't feel like praising you don't feel
[1:02:21] like dragging that old body out of the
[1:02:22] house oh but that's your reasonable
[1:02:24] service you got to bring this body into
[1:02:26] subjection to the word and say body
[1:02:28] you're going to the house of God
[1:02:30] oh buddy you ain't gonna sit down on the
[1:02:32] preaching tonight you're gonna stand
[1:02:34] you're going to Amen to word you're
[1:02:36] going to worship in spirit and in truth
[1:02:39] you're going to give God praise because
[1:02:41] God's done something for you because
[1:02:43] God's already changed you
[1:02:49] that's your reasonable service
[1:02:53] otherwise that's what God expects how to
[1:02:55] use the believer
[1:02:58] in Romans 12 and verse 2 and be not
[1:03:00] conformed to this world
[1:03:03] but be ye transformed many more food
[1:03:07] by the renewing of your mind
[1:03:10] that you may prove what is good or what
[1:03:13] is that is good and acceptable in the
[1:03:14] perfect will of God notice this word
[1:03:16] mind here is the faculties of perceiving
[1:03:20] and understanding those feelings
[1:03:22] you know it's just not the gray matter
[1:03:25] because you know what you lose the gray
[1:03:27] matter
[1:03:27] the older you get the more forgetful you
[1:03:30] get
[1:03:31] some of us get dementia some of us get
[1:03:32] Alzheimer's and all these things
[1:03:34] thankfully God ain't dependent upon the
[1:03:36] gray matter but he says renewing of the
[1:03:39] Mind renewing of the processes the part
[1:03:42] of your life the heart that the believer
[1:03:45] receives with and before these mortal
[1:03:47] bodies can ever take on immortality the
[1:03:50] change has to come here your whole
[1:03:52] attention has to change your whole
[1:03:54] Direction has to change your own life
[1:03:56] has to change and not with the Mind mind
[1:03:58] over matter but your heart has to change
[1:04:01] and you come subject to the word you
[1:04:03] come subject to the thoughts of God you
[1:04:05] come subject to to the messes of the
[1:04:07] hour and you allow that word to change
[1:04:10] you to wash over you to bathe over you
[1:04:13] and to completely rewrite your life
[1:04:15] [Music]
[1:04:17] see our minds and our hearts have to be
[1:04:20] transformed
[1:04:23] before these bodies are going to be
[1:04:24] transformed your way of life has to be
[1:04:27] transformed
[1:04:31] can I tell you a testimony
[1:04:33] let me tell you a testimon the power of
[1:04:35] God there's a brother grew up in the
[1:04:36] message
[1:04:38] left a message when he was young maybe
[1:04:39] 18 somewhere around there this is not
[1:04:42] the other brother that was used here
[1:04:43] last month this is another brother
[1:04:45] and this brother left the message
[1:04:48] and he started running with the wrong
[1:04:49] crowd
[1:04:51] he had a rap sheet that long brother
[1:04:54] gave Grand Larson theft all these other
[1:04:57] different things you would have looked
[1:04:59] at that brother you would have never
[1:05:00] gave him a chance
[1:05:03] he got married to this lady
[1:05:06] she was a practicing atheist
[1:05:10] sense a small child
[1:05:13] she said she didn't know what food
[1:05:14] tastes like until she got saved
[1:05:17] because she was on drugs ever since she
[1:05:18] was a little bitty child and we're not
[1:05:20] talking just marijuana we're talking
[1:05:21] hardcore methamphetamines and and drugs
[1:05:24] cocaine things of that nature and we
[1:05:26] find if I had time for the thought about
[1:05:28] I would have threw a picture up here but
[1:05:29] yet one day in the one moment
[1:05:32] you would have looked at him and said
[1:05:33] there's no hope there's no way but God
[1:05:35] doesn't look at your case that way God
[1:05:37] doesn't look at it God looks at the seed
[1:05:39] that he put down inside there and God
[1:05:41] knows when God knows how and God knows
[1:05:43] exactly the time that that life is going
[1:05:45] to change
[1:05:48] oh he had a rap sheet a mile long but
[1:05:50] God didn't worry about the rap she God
[1:05:51] already had his name peeing on the book
[1:05:53] of life and God said I'm coming by your
[1:05:55] way and when the god comes by your way
[1:05:57] you can expect the change to take place
[1:05:59] God came by there and got a hold of his
[1:06:01] heart and completely changed his life
[1:06:03] and today he's a deacon
[1:06:06] in that church
[1:06:09] and his atheist wife is a Sunday school
[1:06:12] teacher
[1:06:13] [Applause]
[1:06:16] why because God began to change and you
[1:06:20] may be here tonight why do I believe
[1:06:22] this why do I receive it ain't you it's
[1:06:24] God placed something inside of you
[1:06:30] oh but see before before these bodies
[1:06:33] are going to be changed your thinking
[1:06:35] has to change
[1:06:37] your desires have to change
[1:06:40] your natures
[1:06:42] have to change
[1:06:44] and see where does this change occur
[1:06:46] right here in the heart
[1:06:48] so we want to give credit to the mind it
[1:06:50] just comes down to about the prophet God
[1:06:53] will say the word comes to the channel
[1:06:54] of the mind and drops down into the
[1:06:56] heart and when it drops down to the
[1:06:57] heart it catches the spirit behind the
[1:07:00] word
[1:07:01] and it brings life into the believer
[1:07:04] that's why you're here tonight
[1:07:08] see we can no longer think
[1:07:10] the way the world thinks
[1:07:13] you're Messiahs
[1:07:15] you're amateur God
[1:07:17] you got to think like God
[1:07:20] oh brother Joe
[1:07:24] you mean I gotta think like God
[1:07:25] absolutely got to think like God quit
[1:07:27] thinking like the world
[1:07:29] no you got a thing like God you got to
[1:07:31] think when you speaking in the name of
[1:07:33] the Lord Jesus Christ you know without a
[1:07:34] shadow of a doubt it's going to happen
[1:07:36] God said I will make all things possible
[1:07:39] to them that'll believe
[1:07:41] just believe what he said about you just
[1:07:43] believe that you are that bride you are
[1:07:45] without a spot you are without a wrinkle
[1:07:48] you are without a blemish that's what
[1:07:49] the word says about you I don't care how
[1:07:51] I feel I don't care what I look like in
[1:07:53] the mirror I'm not looking at myself I'm
[1:07:55] looking at the word and the words
[1:07:57] already declared this about me
[1:08:02] see our minds have to be renewed the
[1:08:04] Bible says here that be transformed by
[1:08:07] the renewing of the mind of your heart
[1:08:10] that you may prove what is good except
[1:08:13] when the perfect will of God see so
[1:08:14] before these bodies are ever going to be
[1:08:16] changed
[1:08:17] our hearts had to be changed
[1:08:20] why did God send a prophet
[1:08:22] Malachi 4 tells us behold I send you
[1:08:25] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:08:26] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:08:28] and he shall turn
[1:08:31] change at heart
[1:08:33] turn that heart from the filth of the
[1:08:35] world the desires of the Lord and turn
[1:08:37] it back he says I'll turn the heart of
[1:08:40] the fathers to the children in the heart
[1:08:42] of the children to the fathers lest I
[1:08:45] come and smite the search with a curse
[1:08:46] see that is precisely
[1:08:48] when we had to have a Malachi 4. to turn
[1:08:52] the heart of the elect back to the faith
[1:08:54] of the fathers amen
[1:08:56] back to the faith that was once
[1:08:58] delivered where was it delivered at the
[1:09:00] upper room
[1:09:02] come stumbling out like a bunch of
[1:09:04] drunks
[1:09:05] you find people they don't want to get
[1:09:06] drunk
[1:09:08] how many of you ever got drunk not in
[1:09:10] the spirit
[1:09:11] natural
[1:09:13] all right don't be too proud about it
[1:09:15] everybody's like
[1:09:17] and what am I see me
[1:09:20] he said brother why you act so crazy
[1:09:22] when you preach why are you act so crazy
[1:09:24] when you worship because I know where I
[1:09:25] came from
[1:09:27] I told my wife when I was out in the
[1:09:29] world I got drunk
[1:09:30] I ain't happy about it now but I got
[1:09:32] drunk and I got on that dance floor and
[1:09:34] I didn't care what anybody thought about
[1:09:35] me I was cutting a rug it didn't matter
[1:09:38] what they thought about it look around
[1:09:40] take a picture and do what you want
[1:09:41] every day when I came to God it didn't
[1:09:44] stop that person it didn't stop my
[1:09:46] praise it just changed my father in
[1:09:48] place I don't care what you think about
[1:09:49] me because I enjoy my Lord I enjoy the
[1:09:53] presence of a living God I've Been
[1:09:55] Changed brother my think has been
[1:09:57] changed
[1:09:58] hey where you ain't worried about things
[1:10:00] for Jesus you can sit down as you want
[1:10:02] to but it's worth serving he's worth
[1:10:04] dancing for he's worth praising God for
[1:10:07] and if I could do that for the devil
[1:10:09] what can I do for God
[1:10:12] I think what can I do for God don't you
[1:10:15] sit down on God he's done so much for
[1:10:17] you
[1:10:19] he deserves your praise
[1:10:31] shall didn't grow up in church
[1:10:35] now
[1:10:36] I grew up at a house parents that were
[1:10:39] on drugs separated 20 something years my
[1:10:42] parents were divorced
[1:10:44] we went back and forth as kids
[1:10:48] but God
[1:10:50] placed something on the inside
[1:10:53] no matter how much I ran how far I ran
[1:10:56] how steeped and sin I went God knew
[1:10:59] there was coming a day
[1:11:01] God knew there was going to be a moment
[1:11:03] in a car at 11 30 at night when I was
[1:11:07] out on a truck he said turn your
[1:11:10] come on
[1:11:13] ah made a change
[1:11:16] I changed the direction of my car I went
[1:11:19] back to the house and I I knelt beside
[1:11:22] my bed and I gave my heart to the Lord
[1:11:24] let me tell you I ain't never been the
[1:11:26] same
[1:11:30] I never had one desire to go back to
[1:11:33] what I was to go back to the alcohol now
[1:11:36] go back to the women they go back to the
[1:11:38] parties they go back to that seat now
[1:11:40] I've been changed and that change took
[1:11:42] place here
[1:11:44] but that ain't the only change that God
[1:11:46] has promised
[1:11:48] God has promised us we all shall be
[1:11:51] changed
[1:11:52] [Applause]
[1:11:55] we all
[1:11:57] are going to be changed notice
[1:11:59] the heart
[1:12:01] the inner part of a man the soul of a
[1:12:04] man
[1:12:05] and the Bible would tell you this word
[1:12:06] heart is the mind the knowledge to think
[1:12:08] and the reflection the memory

[1:12:14] is the heart has to be transformed

[1:12:39] about change because that's what we're

[1:14:16] then it changed over and then it changed
[1:14:18] and every change it brought a greater
[1:14:21] aspect of perfection

[1:19:32] thrown at you and you just you're quick
[1:19:34] to change and change and change you're
[1:19:35] not set in a routine yet
[1:19:39] but see change as a young person seems
[1:19:41] to be a part of your life
[1:19:43] every day something new
[1:19:45] something you mold yourself here but
[1:19:47] when you get past a certain age you're
[1:19:49] already you're not molding anymore
[1:19:51] you've already been molded
[1:19:54] and as we continue down this journey of
[1:19:56] life
[1:19:57] I want you to know you're going to
[1:19:58] experience changes
[1:20:01] you're going to experience challenges
[1:20:02] and you're going to experience different
[1:20:04] trials you're going to experience new
[1:20:06] blessings
[1:20:07] kids are going to come
[1:20:10] ask brother William he's got five of
[1:20:11] them
[1:20:14] kids are going to come
[1:20:16] sometimes whether you like it or not
[1:20:19] hello we're coming
[1:20:21] get the booties ready
[1:20:26] and somebody like whoa I wasn't
[1:20:28] expecting that
[1:20:30] but it's change
[1:20:32] then grandkids come and everybody's like
[1:20:34] man I wish we just had grandkids
[1:20:36] and grandkids so much better than kids
[1:20:38] you can give the grandkids back
[1:20:40] kids you stuck with until at least 18.
[1:20:44] but we find here you're going to face
[1:20:47] these changes and some notice people are
[1:20:50] going to move in
[1:20:52] some of you here tonight are going to
[1:20:53] move out of Elkton Virginia
[1:20:56] some of you young girls are going to
[1:20:58] bury some boy from some other Church
[1:20:59] probably Louisiana
[1:21:02] because we just got some good people
[1:21:04] down in Louisiana
[1:21:08] here we go
[1:21:10] come on
[1:21:14] and you're gonna move and it's going to
[1:21:15] be changed changing that family
[1:21:17] changing the church there's going to be
[1:21:20] people move in
[1:21:22] how many of you are new to this church
[1:21:25] look at all them come on raise your hand
[1:21:26] don't be embarrassed
[1:21:28] man you're new that's change
[1:21:32] and for some of you old hands has always
[1:21:34] been here sometimes that can be
[1:21:36] difficult
[1:21:39] because now things that were always were
[1:21:41] ain't always where now they're changing
[1:21:44] the Dynamics of the church is beginning
[1:21:47] to change
[1:21:48] because now there's new personalities
[1:21:50] now there's different ideas
[1:21:53] let me tell you I'm preaching we got the
[1:21:55] same Dynamics and even like Tabernacle
[1:21:57] there's been an influx of people
[1:22:00] oh we welcome the chains in one aspect
[1:22:03] because we know God is getting the
[1:22:04] people ready for the supernatural but
[1:22:07] this human body of ours the human mind
[1:22:09] resists to change because now things are
[1:22:12] different it ain't always the same Full
[1:22:14] Gospel Lighthouse that it always was on
[1:22:16] the hill now the Dynamics have changed
[1:22:19] now the complexity of the church is
[1:22:21] changing but I want you to know God
[1:22:23] ain't done yet God is still God is
[1:22:25] getting the people ready for a major
[1:22:28] change this is only the beginning church
[1:22:31] we got to learn to embrace this change
[1:22:34] we got to learn to accept this tank and
[1:22:38] adopt this change but give me the day
[1:22:40] I'll put the devil on up there's more
[1:22:41] coming
[1:22:43] there's more coming there's enough dead
[1:22:46] churches out there but there's more
[1:22:48] coming they want the change of the
[1:22:50] supernatural because it's going to take
[1:22:52] the supernatural to change these bodies
[1:22:56] [Applause]
[1:22:58] you're gonna find people gonna move
[1:23:01] from City to city state to state join
[1:23:04] this church
[1:23:06] move out of this church
[1:23:08] find a new job how many you like to find
[1:23:10] a new job at 40. oh
[1:23:13] thank God I went to the house
[1:23:18] could you imagine starting over at 47
[1:23:20] shoot me in the head
[1:23:25] no so you'll find a new job or you may
[1:23:28] lose a job
[1:23:29] and then you're on a job hunt
[1:23:32] it's change
[1:23:34] you'll experience lost
[1:23:36] you lose a loved one a father a mother a
[1:23:38] child a church member
[1:23:41] then you grieve and it's change
[1:23:45] for God helps us to to understand and to
[1:23:49] cope with those changes see there's
[1:23:51] always going to be changes in our lives
[1:23:57] see many of us if not all of us
[1:24:01] change is difficult
[1:24:03] because it was a dude
[1:24:05] change penetrates your comfort zone
[1:24:11] well you're comfortable here you're
[1:24:13] comfortable with your little group of
[1:24:14] friends
[1:24:16] and then all of a sudden a new family
[1:24:17] moves in and they penetrate that friend
[1:24:19] bubble
[1:24:23] who let you in my click
[1:24:27] [Applause]
[1:24:28] all day
[1:24:30] it happens
[1:24:33] you know the chosen series they said get
[1:24:35] used to different Full Gospel get used
[1:24:37] to it
[1:24:38] they're coming
[1:24:40] they're coming people are ready for a
[1:24:43] change people are sick and tired of
[1:24:45] those dead churches out there all they
[1:24:48] got is word word but there ain't no
[1:24:50] Supernatural mixing with the word oh we
[1:24:52] know we believe in the world and we got
[1:24:54] the word and we're thankful for the word
[1:24:55] but the letter kill it but the spirit of
[1:24:57] God is what gives life to that word and
[1:25:00] makes that word live that's why you can
[1:25:02] have a display of a Supernatural That's
[1:25:05] why God can come down and on Wednesday
[1:25:07] night service and have like a convention
[1:25:08] style meeting because why because you
[1:25:10] welcome the change
[1:25:14] see change disrupts
[1:25:17] our comforts and we feel like we're out
[1:25:20] of control
[1:25:21] we used to have control of this and now
[1:25:24] we no longer have control of it see our
[1:25:26] human nature
[1:25:28] how many of you are human I know you're
[1:25:29] Virginia
[1:25:33] you're still Southern
[1:25:37] go Lee
[1:25:39] the South's gonna rise again right
[1:25:43] see the human nature or human nature is
[1:25:46] to resist it
[1:25:48] I know I ain't preaching none of y'all
[1:25:50] tonight I'm just preaching myself
[1:25:52] see our comfort zones become penetrated
[1:25:54] and we feel like they've been violated
[1:25:56] and sometimes we kick back and we drag
[1:25:58] our heels in and we resist to
[1:26:01] we don't want nobody else coming to
[1:26:04] church
[1:26:05] because we like our little group
[1:26:08] because when you add members you add
[1:26:10] complexes
[1:26:12] you had a different element
[1:26:15] change
[1:26:17] I always tell people you come to my
[1:26:18] church you need to be an asset on the
[1:26:20] balance sheet not a liability
[1:26:24] make an impact be a positive change God
[1:26:27] LED you here put your shoulder to the
[1:26:29] wheel God brought you here get behind
[1:26:31] the work of the ministry get behind the
[1:26:33] anointing get behind the supernatural
[1:26:35] put your whole heart into it you're not
[1:26:37] just here to be a problem alone you're
[1:26:39] here to worship God now put everything
[1:26:42] into it
[1:26:44] don't come and be a spectator there's
[1:26:46] enough spectating going on out there
[1:26:48] we're here to put everything we got into
[1:26:50] it because what we're expecting our
[1:26:53] major change Church we're expecting a
[1:26:56] God to come down and completely
[1:26:58] transform Our Lives
[1:27:00] but I want you to know it starts on this
[1:27:02] side it starts now
[1:27:06] see change disrupts our Comforts it
[1:27:10] challenges us
[1:27:11] to adopt
[1:27:13] to adjust
[1:27:16] it makes us better
[1:27:22] change
[1:27:24] makes you better you say bro Joe I need
[1:27:28] you to tell me how's that so
[1:27:30] now how many you've been changed from a
[1:27:32] sinner to a saint
[1:27:34] are you better or worse
[1:27:37] it's just that simple
[1:27:39] it's just that simple change
[1:27:42] and to change often makes you perfect
[1:27:46] see change is healthy for the human
[1:27:49] nature for those that are not willing to
[1:27:52] change they get left behind
[1:27:55] ever been part of a company to where
[1:27:57] they started initiating some changes and
[1:27:59] people grumbled and complained and they
[1:28:01] fussed and they just did everything they
[1:28:03] could they didn't want to change they
[1:28:05] refused to change what happened they
[1:28:07] left
[1:28:08] they left
[1:28:12] but see it's no different than the
[1:28:14] children of Israel
[1:28:15] God sent him a Vindicated Prophet by the
[1:28:18] name of Moses
[1:28:20] can I keep going am I okay for time
[1:28:22] he sent him a Vindicated Prophet now
[1:28:25] they've been down in Egypt for 400 plus
[1:28:27] years you would have think they had
[1:28:29] nothing got sick and tired of that place
[1:28:32] come on y'all gotta do better than that
[1:28:36] I mean let's just Egypt laodicea wanted
[1:28:38] to say
[1:28:39] they down there working for Pharaoh
[1:28:41] you're getting harder and harder getting
[1:28:43] beat every day getting whipped every day
[1:28:44] getting ridiculed every day getting
[1:28:46] accused every day every day every day
[1:28:48] every day and we find when God said a
[1:28:50] Vindicated prophet he showed them signs
[1:28:52] he showed them ones he called down
[1:28:54] plagues and this and that and they
[1:28:56] crossed over on the Red Sea and yet they
[1:28:58] still complained about it notice what
[1:29:00] they said in Exodus 14 and verse 11 and
[1:29:03] they said unto Moses because there was
[1:29:05] no graves in Egypt hast thou taken us
[1:29:07] away to die in the wilderness wherefore
[1:29:09] has thou dealt thus with us to carry us
[1:29:12] forth out of Egypt it's not just a word
[1:29:14] that we did tell thee in Egypt saying
[1:29:16] let us alone that we may serve the
[1:29:18] Egyptians they didn't want to change
[1:29:20] Dwelling Places
[1:29:22] but I want you to know tonight brother
[1:29:23] assistant God has got something better
[1:29:25] for you don't you get used to laodicea
[1:29:28] don't you get comfortable and lay out of
[1:29:30] sin God has sent you a Vindicated
[1:29:31] message he's gonna pluck up all the
[1:29:33] feathers he's gonna make it rough
[1:29:35] because he don't want you to get
[1:29:36] comfortable here
[1:29:38] he wants you to change tonight
[1:29:40] [Applause]
[1:29:42] [Music]
[1:29:46] but many of us change Craig's anxiety
[1:29:51] because you don't know what's around the
[1:29:53] corner
[1:29:55] see
[1:29:57] I worked for a hospital for 24 years
[1:30:00] and we find that change Always started
[1:30:02] at the corporate level
[1:30:05] because you know what they got the
[1:30:07] greatest ideas right
[1:30:10] and then you find that it comes down to
[1:30:13] the hospital and it doesn't start at the
[1:30:15] bottom change never starts at the bottom
[1:30:19] it doesn't start with the front line
[1:30:21] staff it started with the CEO the CFO or
[1:30:25] C whatever o you want to put behind it
[1:30:27] it always starts with leadership
[1:30:30] the executive level leadership and see
[1:30:33] that change becomes to them first and
[1:30:36] they have to accept that change and
[1:30:37] embrace that change so that they can be
[1:30:40] change ages to push what what that
[1:30:43] organization wants out to the to the
[1:30:45] whole of the company and notice they may
[1:30:47] push it out it may be months
[1:30:50] that that leadership sits on him
[1:30:52] and they embrace it and they learn about
[1:30:54] it
[1:30:55] see it's changed they didn't like it at
[1:30:57] first just like you don't like it
[1:30:59] but then time comes and they have to
[1:31:02] roll it out to the middle managers
[1:31:04] then they roll that out that change out
[1:31:07] and it gives the middle managers time to
[1:31:09] embrace that change
[1:31:10] and you find there's going to be those
[1:31:12] that kick
[1:31:13] May fuss my goodness I was in in
[1:31:15] leadership for a long time there was a
[1:31:17] lot of fussing and kicking going on you
[1:31:19] didn't think we had Bruce Lee and Chuck
[1:31:20] Norris up there fighting
[1:31:23] people don't like change
[1:31:25] so it comes from the top then it comes
[1:31:27] to the middle managers and then after
[1:31:29] maybe months they finally rolling out to
[1:31:32] all the front line staff
[1:31:34] so that they can Embrace to change
[1:31:37] embrace the direction that the company
[1:31:39] wants to go
[1:31:42] foreign
[1:31:46] yes I agree some of it is nonsense
[1:31:51] well that
[1:31:52] let me use it tonight please like I'm
[1:31:54] going somewhere with this
[1:31:58] so we think about the bride or we think
[1:32:00] about our change where does it start it
[1:32:02] doesn't start at the front line staff
[1:32:05] it doesn't start at the bottom guards
[1:32:08] God started with a prophet
[1:32:11] God started with the prophet and he gave
[1:32:13] that proper direction this is where I
[1:32:15] want you to go this is how I want you to
[1:32:17] preach this is what I want my bride to
[1:32:19] be and what did he do he began to preach
[1:32:21] it and then what happened then the
[1:32:22] middle managers then the preachers and
[1:32:24] the five-fold ministry got a hold of
[1:32:26] that message they got a hold of what but
[1:32:29] God wanted to be changed and they began
[1:32:31] to preach it and preach it and preach it
[1:32:33] and preach it and was it it made a
[1:32:36] change in your life and that's why
[1:32:37] you're here tonight because it started
[1:32:39] at the top but God don't want it just to
[1:32:41] stay at the top he wants you to live
[1:32:43] that life he wants you to embrace this
[1:32:45] message and change he wants you to
[1:32:48] embrace the change that's coming for the
[1:32:50] body of Christ
[1:32:53] do it
[1:32:56] you see we as Believers we're going to
[1:32:58] face change
[1:33:00] you know you hear churches they're
[1:33:01] building Fellowship Halls I know some of
[1:33:04] you old people where you don't like them
[1:33:05] Fellowship Halls
[1:33:07] how dare you preach about Fellowship
[1:33:09] Hall
[1:33:12] have you looked around the world we're
[1:33:14] living in
[1:33:16] we got to do something for our young
[1:33:18] people
[1:33:19] we got to provide them something
[1:33:23] it ain't the way it was 50 years ago so
[1:33:26] ciety is the same as it was 40 years ago
[1:33:28] on the world has changed around us and
[1:33:31] now we must change build the fellowship
[1:33:33] hall get the people together have
[1:33:36] Fellowship one with another keep
[1:33:38] yourself in Christian Fellowship
[1:33:41] cause if you don't do something for the
[1:33:43] young people the devil certainly will
[1:33:48] that's the problem with too many
[1:33:49] churches they refuse to have it and you
[1:33:52] find lives are being wrecked
[1:33:55] homes are being destroyed because people
[1:33:58] preachers have dug their heels in they
[1:34:00] don't want to change
[1:34:03] but we have to brother and sister we
[1:34:05] have to change for the good of the whole
[1:34:07] we have to throw our or our vote in for
[1:34:09] the good and say I may not agree with it
[1:34:11] but I'm going to do it anyway because my
[1:34:13] young people deserve it
[1:34:15] it's our fellowship not with unbelievers
[1:34:18] out in the world but they deserve good
[1:34:20] Godly Fellowship
[1:34:23] so you build a fellowship Paul and you
[1:34:26] play basketball or volleyball or
[1:34:28] whatever ball you want to play what is
[1:34:30] wrong with that
[1:34:33] what is wrong with that
[1:34:36] it's Christians it's Believers it's
[1:34:39] gospel sinner You Ain't Got Drugs there
[1:34:42] you ain't got homosexuals there you
[1:34:44] ain't got the world there no sir you got
[1:34:47] God there
[1:34:49] you got God in the midst of it
[1:34:52] don't dig your heels in tonight let go
[1:34:55] and let God have his way
[1:34:57] quit resists in this tank God is ready
[1:35:00] to break out on this place
[1:35:06] things ain't the way it was in the 40s
[1:35:08] 50s and 60s
[1:35:12] just as your Prophet evolved in his
[1:35:14] ministry so has this ministry of the
[1:35:16] Bride evolved till today
[1:35:19] we're not backing up
[1:35:22] get on board we're not backing up
[1:35:25] we're not going back Church
[1:35:28] the prophet of God said the move is on
[1:35:30] for the bride that's thus saith the Lord
[1:35:33] I say throw down those worldly bag of
[1:35:35] peanuts get on the train cause we're
[1:35:37] pulling out somebody's gonna be changed
[1:35:40] somebody's gonna be transformed
[1:35:42] somebody's going to be be a gun lead
[1:35:45] this world in the moment in the
[1:35:47] twinkling of an eye
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:35:50] I say why not me why not now
[1:35:52] find out my young person why not my son
[1:35:54] why not my daughter why not my wife why
[1:35:57] not my husband why not our church why
[1:35:59] not the preachers why not the deacons
[1:36:00] why not the trustees why not the
[1:36:03] musicians why shouldn't we change
[1:36:07] he wasn't meant to stay here forever
[1:36:10] [Applause]
[1:36:12] God say the best for last
[1:36:19] he saved the best for last
[1:36:24] look at your neighbor
[1:36:26] come on it's okay you're the best
[1:36:30] you're the best
[1:36:35] he saved the best to run the last leg
[1:36:40] he didn't pick the weakest he didn't
[1:36:42] pick the feeble he didn't pick those
[1:36:44] that were or there was undecided in
[1:36:47] their minds he picked the very best that
[1:36:49] he could pick and he placed him and
[1:36:51] laodicea because he was determined I
[1:36:54] will have a bride she'll come out of
[1:36:57] chaos she'll come out of corruption and
[1:36:59] this old corruptable body is going to
[1:37:01] one day put on in corruption in this
[1:37:04] mortal flesh he's gonna take your own
[1:37:06] immortality
[1:37:08] and that's why you're here
[1:37:10] if you're not here because Ron Spence is
[1:37:12] your preacher or your pastor you're
[1:37:13] because God placed you here God anointed
[1:37:16] you to be here God elected you for this
[1:37:18] hour God placed you in this body that's
[1:37:21] why you're here that's why you serve the
[1:37:24] Lord
[1:37:32] was he coping
[1:37:34] coping with change can be difficult
[1:37:38] brother Mark just took a church
[1:37:41] got his dad's church it's change
[1:37:44] he can
[1:37:48] I think he's about to have a heart
[1:37:50] attack
[1:37:51] without any paramedics in here
[1:37:54] but it's a difference
[1:37:56] he's been a support down there for many
[1:37:58] years but now it all falls on his
[1:38:00] shoulders

[1:38:06] and some people may find it difficult to
[1:38:08] cope with even as a young a new pastor
[1:38:10] you can find the change in the burden of
[1:38:13] everybody it can be difficult
[1:38:15] people ask me all the time are you going
[1:38:16] to be a pastor I don't know
[1:38:19] I'll say he's going to change my nature

[1:39:00] thing out and let the house of God have
[1:39:02] victory at the people of God have
[1:39:04] victory

[1:39:09] defeated I see young girls set free I've
[1:39:11] seen the change come over their face
[1:39:13] when the presence of God comes down
[1:39:21] see change
[1:39:24] am I okay tonight
[1:39:29] change for the believer can sometimes be
[1:39:32] difficult
[1:39:34] but all the time
[1:39:39] for the Bible says in Romans 8 28 we
[1:39:42] know
[1:39:43] that all things
[1:39:45] whether they be good things whether they
[1:39:46] be bad things no matter what they may be
[1:39:49] all things work together for the good
[1:39:53] to them
[1:39:55] that love God
[1:39:58] now if you don't love God here tonight
[1:39:59] you ain't going to enjoy this message

[1:40:05] you're not going to do anything
[1:40:07] but if you love God
[1:40:09] and God is in your heart
[1:40:11] you can't wait to get to the house of
[1:40:13] God

[1:40:24] able to stand before the elect of God
[1:40:26] and share the very thoughts of God I
[1:40:29] know what I was Sister Connie I know the
[1:40:31] life that I used to live but I know what
[1:40:33] God has transformed me let me tell you
[1:40:35] ain't no devil can point me back and say
[1:40:37] that that man is still alive that man is
[1:40:40] dead it's midnight there's a new man now
[1:40:42] there's a new sheriff in town the Holy
[1:40:45] Ghost is called the Holy Ghost is Raven
[1:40:47] the Holy Ghost got jurisdiction over my
[1:40:49] life and I trust that he's got it over
[1:40:51] yours tonight
[1:40:54] you may not like to change but it's good
[1:40:56] for you
[1:40:59] [Music]
[1:41:00] well brother Joe we don't like all that
[1:41:03] emotion
[1:41:05] that's what I want to say sometimes
[1:41:08] people don't like emotion
[1:41:14] you know I tell the story when I first
[1:41:15] got saved and went to Brother Tim's
[1:41:16] Church
[1:41:18] I was a baptist boy well I said I was
[1:41:20] two years in a Baptist Church I was
[1:41:22] searching all over the place because God
[1:41:24] did something that voice spoke to me and
[1:41:26] turned my life around
[1:41:29] and for two years I went searching
[1:41:32] Methodist Church Presbyterian Church
[1:41:35] Pentecostal Church Assembly of God
[1:41:37] Church Baptist Church
[1:41:39] then I stumbled
[1:41:41] across 10 Pro it's even like to have an
[1:41:43] apple in the first service
[1:41:46] I was sitting there
[1:41:48] are standing because they don't sit a
[1:41:50] whole lot at that church
[1:41:52] I was standing there and all of a sudden
[1:41:54] something just went
[1:41:55] and hit me brushed against my ear and I
[1:41:57] turned back there was no hand there
[1:42:00] I knew there was something different
[1:42:03] but I remember like I wish these people
[1:42:05] be quiet
[1:42:06] I can't understand what this man's
[1:42:08] saying I didn't know what he was saying
[1:42:09] anyway it was all messes jargon and I
[1:42:11] didn't have a clue
[1:42:13] but I knew something said this is where
[1:42:15] you belong
[1:42:17] and you can ask my wife God be my
[1:42:19] witness for weeks months I drove every
[1:42:22] weekend to even like to have an echo
[1:42:24] three three four hours there three four
[1:42:26] hours back every Saturday or Friday
[1:42:28] night I drive I drive back Sunday
[1:42:30] morning or Sunday night so I could be
[1:42:32] back to work and finally I found a job
[1:42:35] God moved me over there the greatest
[1:42:39] change of my life
[1:42:41] I never expected to see what he was
[1:42:43] going to do but God started something in
[1:42:46] that car and now that something has
[1:42:48] evolved to what's before you today
[1:42:51] you say was it all easy was it all
[1:42:53] cookies and cream no it was a lot of
[1:42:54] Rocky Road in it
[1:42:56] but we're here
[1:42:58] and we ain't backing up we ain't giving
[1:43:00] in we ain't giving a devil an inch we
[1:43:03] come this far we didn't come this far to
[1:43:05] give up we didn't come this far to lose
[1:43:07] we came this far to win we came brother
[1:43:10] sister we came to be changed we came to
[1:43:14] be transformed we came to Earth that's
[1:43:16] why you're here tonight you didn't come
[1:43:18] to hear me but you come to be changed by
[1:43:20] the preaching of the word
[1:43:23] so that your heart can be oh it could be
[1:43:26] revived tonight
[1:43:32] so the change for the believer
[1:43:35] it may be difficult
[1:43:37] but it's always good
[1:43:39] and notice now
[1:43:40] First Corinthians 15 and verse 51. my my

[1:44:23] shall all be changed
[1:44:27] oh I just love that in a moment in the
[1:44:31] twinkling of an eye now I don't know how
[1:44:33] you twinkle to your eye
[1:44:35] but whatever it is it's that quick I
[1:44:39] know when I used to when my wife and I
[1:44:40] were dating according whatever y'all
[1:44:42] call it we want to call it we'll wink at
[1:44:44] each other
[1:44:45] she winked back at me it was all right
[1:44:47] back then
[1:44:48] y'all girl y'all do that
[1:44:51] uh-huh we're gonna have to come over
[1:44:53] here and preach a little bit sister
[1:44:54] Connie
[1:44:55] yeah see that little cute boy
[1:45:00] man look at that boy he's he's from
[1:45:03] Louisiana
[1:45:04] could be over there across there yeah
[1:45:06] yeah you sit over there and sit down
[1:45:07] like oh look at him
[1:45:11] we're gonna be changed in the twinkling
[1:45:15] of an eye
[1:45:16] oh your heart's already changed oh yes
[1:45:19] I'm on cloud nine oh he winked in me
[1:45:25] yeah
[1:45:27] hey that's what I thought my wife chased
[1:45:29] me down
[1:45:33] I said hey look at you you got me
[1:45:37] [Applause]
[1:45:40] I'm going to be changed in the moment
[1:45:43] in the twinkling
[1:45:44] of an eye
[1:45:46] thinking how fast how sudden
[1:45:52] at the last trunk for the trumpet shall
[1:45:55] sound and the dead and dead shall be
[1:45:58] raised Incorruptible and we all shall be
[1:46:02] changed for this corruptable must
[1:46:06] it has to if we're going to inherit the
[1:46:09] kingdom of God it must be changed this
[1:46:14] corruptable must put on incorruption and
[1:46:18] this Mortal must
[1:46:20] put on immortality notice he emphasizes
[1:46:24] it twice it must it's a decree from God
[1:46:27] it has to because there's no other way
[1:46:29] in the kingdom of God unless these
[1:46:31] bodies of ours be changed
[1:46:38] now listen to what your Prophet says
[1:46:40] notice now Paul he tells us this change
[1:46:43] is a mystery
[1:46:44] if you hadn't listened to brother Wayne
[1:46:46] Priest The Mystery of our change I
[1:46:48] encourage you to go back and listen to
[1:46:49] it
[1:46:50] because he does a phenomenal job
[1:46:52] see I'm an evangelist I'm not deep like
[1:46:54] brother Wayne
[1:46:56] my goodness I wish I was
[1:46:58] but I can only be Joe Adams
[1:47:00] and so I'm gonna preach it to you the
[1:47:01] way I know it and here we find it's a
[1:47:03] secret that's only for the pride
[1:47:08] you can't preach this to everybody
[1:47:11] you can't preach you know what they
[1:47:13] think about the Rapture planes are going
[1:47:15] to be falling out of the sky trains are
[1:47:17] going to run off the tracks cars are
[1:47:18] going to wreck on the interstate
[1:47:22] but what did it take a Vindicated profit
[1:47:25] to come and explain to us
[1:47:28] our change
[1:47:31] how it's going to take place when it's
[1:47:34] going to take place
[1:47:36] oh Church see these vowed bodies of decl
[1:47:39] decay in humanity
[1:47:41] is going to be changed into a body like
[1:47:43] his own glorious body
[1:47:46] see this is only a mystery
[1:47:49] that it took a message
[1:47:50] from a seventh angel
[1:47:52] to come and reveal
[1:47:54] the mystery of your change
[1:47:56] how when
[1:47:59] where we ain't got to go to Arizona
[1:48:03] we ain't got to go to Jeffersonville
[1:48:06] we're going to be changed right here in
[1:48:07] Elkton Virginia
[1:48:09] and if I don't make it back to Minden
[1:48:12] Louisiana I'm going to be changed on the
[1:48:13] interstate they can have my car I don't
[1:48:16] really care
[1:48:17] I won't need it I'm gonna travel like a
[1:48:19] thought
[1:48:20] [Applause]
[1:48:23] but see the prophet of God will say the
[1:48:25] Pentecostal message was to restore gifts
[1:48:27] back in the church but this is the
[1:48:30] calling forth of the Bride
[1:48:32] what is this message
[1:48:35] this message is the calling forth of the
[1:48:37] Bride another message that was to come
[1:48:40] just before Sodom was to be burned
[1:48:43] see we know that now with the seventh
[1:48:45] angel all the mysteries of God have been
[1:48:47] fulfilled all the loose sins from the
[1:48:50] previous ages have been tied up now we
[1:48:52] have one great infallible word until man
[1:48:56] bastardizes it
[1:48:59] and we find that the book that we are
[1:49:01] reading from now is no longer a closed
[1:49:03] book
[1:49:04] now it's an open book and the prophet of
[1:49:06] God say when that book became open it
[1:49:08] became a new book
[1:49:10] it's not a book that we read from a
[1:49:12] previous age
[1:49:14] because now the seals have come off of
[1:49:16] it
[1:49:17] the mystery of our change has been
[1:49:19] revealed
[1:49:21] only thing we're waiting for is a
[1:49:22] manifestation of our change
[1:49:26] see we had a prophet to come and he
[1:49:28] would reveal all these things but yet
[1:49:31] you find how many of you are welcome in
[1:49:33] this change
[1:49:35] he longed for this change
[1:49:37] but there's one out there that resists
[1:49:40] this change
[1:49:41] your adversary the devil doesn't want
[1:49:44] you to change
[1:49:48] he resists your change he knows what the
[1:49:51] word says
[1:49:53] he knows it's already been spoken why
[1:49:55] are you under attack why are you under
[1:49:57] an assault because he's doing everything
[1:49:59] that he can
[1:50:01] to keep you from being transformed
[1:50:04] he wants you to get comfortable and Leo
[1:50:07] to see you notice what he did he created
[1:50:10] his own Eden
[1:50:12] just so you can find any form of
[1:50:15] pleasure that will suit your fancy
[1:50:19] You Like Drugs he's got all different
[1:50:21] sorts of drugs you like alcohol he's got
[1:50:23] you a cocktail waiting you like women
[1:50:26] well he's got women he's got me and he's
[1:50:28] got it all out there he's got everything
[1:50:30] out there
[1:50:32] to do what to entice you to keep you
[1:50:34] bound here because he knows there's been
[1:50:36] a word spoken over a people
[1:50:39] and he knows that ain't one of those
[1:50:41] words going to return void
[1:50:43] [Music]
[1:50:44] he knows and not one of those words he's
[1:50:47] been defeated down through every age let
[1:50:49] me tell you Church he's going to be
[1:50:51] defeated in this age
[1:50:53] brother Bama says now now he said watch
[1:50:55] when the spiritual bride when she begins
[1:50:58] to have a Revival
[1:51:01] can we have a Revival Church a Full
[1:51:03] Gospel Lighthouse when she begins to
[1:51:05] have a Revival when she begins to come
[1:51:07] back and line herself up with the word
[1:51:09] watch then again you see how the
[1:51:12] scriptures at that time there will be a
[1:51:14] message sweep out and catch the bride
[1:51:17] and catch that woman the elect
[1:51:19] that's why you're here
[1:51:22] because God knew he was going to have a
[1:51:24] bride and so he sent her a message that
[1:51:28] she would catch her
[1:51:31] sure what is the attraction on the mount
[1:51:33] it's
[1:51:36] some Transfiguration
[1:51:39] we're going to be changed
[1:51:42] notice when the people begin to try to
[1:51:44] line with the word he said there comes a
[1:51:47] fresh message
[1:51:49] not one from yesterday not one from
[1:51:52] previous ages but fresh
[1:51:54] it means it's got life in it a fresh
[1:51:57] message from the word of God right
[1:51:59] straight to the people and they catch
[1:52:01] that message and they line up every time
[1:52:05] see this message was wasn't just sent to
[1:52:08] tell you that you're bride
[1:52:10] you say what does it mean what was it
[1:52:12] for
[1:52:13] it wasn't just sent to tell me that I'm
[1:52:15] bride that was part of it
[1:52:17] but it was sent to prepare you for a
[1:52:19] change
[1:52:21] that's why God sent you this message
[1:52:25] the greatest mystery is the mystery of
[1:52:28] the body of Christ
[1:52:30] beloved now you are Sons and Daughters
[1:52:33] of God
[1:52:34] now not yesterday not tomorrow not in
[1:52:37] the Millennium but right now your sons
[1:52:39] and daughters of God
[1:52:41] I show you a mystery
[1:52:44] we're going to be changed so this
[1:52:46] message wasn't only sent to tell you
[1:52:47] that you're bribe but it was sent to
[1:52:49] prepare your way out
[1:52:51] it was sent to provide you a change
[1:52:55] a word to sweep over your body
[1:52:59] when you see like how can I go another
[1:53:01] day how can I take one more step
[1:53:04] how are these things going to fall off
[1:53:06] my life
[1:53:08] you know I thought when I first got
[1:53:09] saved and came to the church there
[1:53:11] brother Tim you know I was a little
[1:53:13] baptist boy I had a lot of rough edges
[1:53:16] any rough edges here tonight
[1:53:18] don't be so happy
[1:53:21] we got rough edges I'm like there ain't
[1:53:22] no way brother Mark I'm ever going to
[1:53:24] fit the bill
[1:53:26] I had a temper
[1:53:28] still got one I just know how to use it
[1:53:30] now
[1:53:32] I had this I had that I'm like man there
[1:53:34] ain't no I just looked at the word all
[1:53:35] the fruits of the spirit of my well I
[1:53:37] might as well stop
[1:53:39] but you know what the more I walked with
[1:53:41] the Lord
[1:53:42] the more that change come over me
[1:53:45] and the more that change come over me
[1:53:46] and more this fell off for me and that
[1:53:48] fell off for me and that temper got this
[1:53:49] way and that nature got controlled here
[1:53:51] and that got here and and then all these
[1:53:54] things just begin to evolve and my life
[1:53:56] began to change and match the word of
[1:53:58] God
[1:53:59] now Satan kicked he screamed he fought
[1:54:02] me to the nail and he's going to do the
[1:54:04] same for you because Satan resists your
[1:54:07] change

[1:54:20] stop it
[1:54:21] he can't stop it oh you may have a bad
[1:54:24] day tomorrow morning Monday morning but
[1:54:26] he can't stop it let me tell you because
[1:54:28] Satan can't stop what God started
[1:54:31] and God ain't stopping until your body's
[1:54:34] been changed God's coming with word
[1:54:36] whole type of word sign on top of side
