[18:07] leave for work and
[18:09] my day started a little bit later so I
[18:10] went back to sleep and
[18:12] in that dream I
[18:14] was standing in a big room and I saw our
[18:16] lord Jesus in that room and
[18:19] and uh
[18:21] it moved me because I was watching
[18:24] the men in the Bible was they as they
[18:25] were beating him and
[18:27] they were putting them lashes on his
[18:29] back and
[18:30] I was trying my best to get to him and
[18:32] help him
[18:33] and I remember in that dream how real
[18:34] that dream was to me and
[18:36] and I wanted to get to him and and help
[18:38] my Lord Jesus and there was something
[18:40] holding me back and I was watching some
[18:41] people walk in the room and in that big
[18:44] space and I was thinking to myself
[18:46] surely they'll help him and they just
[18:48] walked right past him just totally
[18:50] ignored what was going on and I woke up
[18:52] that morning after that dream and I was
[18:54] just really overwhelmed by by that

[53:14] continue to lift up our pastor these
[53:16] this this weekend and next weekend while
[53:18] he's away that God would use in a very
[53:21] special way amen first Samuel chapter 17
[53:25] and verse 4
[53:27] and the Bible said and there went out a
[53:30] champion
[53:32] out of the camp of the Philistines named
[53:35] Goliath of gath whose height was six
[53:37] cubits
[53:39] and to span and he had a helmet of brass
[53:42] upon his head and he was armed with a
[53:44] coat of mail
[53:45] and the weight of the coat was five
[53:47] thousand shekels of brass and he had
[53:50] Grieves of brass upon his legs and a
[53:52] target of brass between his shoulders
[53:55] the staff of his spear was like a
[53:57] Weaver's beam
[53:58] and his Spears head weighed 600 shekels
[54:02] of iron
[54:03] and one bearing a shield went before him
[54:06] and he stood and cried under the armies
[54:08] of Israel and said unto them why are you
[54:11] come out to set your battle in Array and
[54:14] not I a Philistine and you servants to
[54:16] Saul choose you a man for you and let
[54:20] him come down to me and if he'd be able
[54:22] to fight with me and to kill me then
[54:24] will we be your servants but if I
[54:26] Prevail against him and kill him then
[54:29] shall ye be our servants and serve us
[54:31] and the Philistine said I defy the
[54:34] armies of Israel this day give me a man
[54:38] that we may fight together and when Saul
[54:41] and all of Israel heard those words of
[54:44] the Philistine they were dismayed and
[54:47] greatly afraid Matthew chapter 27 and
[54:51] verse 26
[55:06] amen Matthew chapter 27 and verse 26
[55:11] then released he Barabbas unto them
[55:14] and when he had scourged Jesus he
[55:17] delivered him to be crucified then the
[55:20] soldiers of the governor took Jesus into
[55:23] the common Hall and gathered unto him
[55:26] the whole band of soldiers
[55:28] and they stripped him
[55:31] and put on him a Scarlet robe
[55:34] and when they had planted a crown of
[55:35] thorns they put it upon his head
[55:38] and a reed in his right hand
[55:41] and they bowed the knee before him and
[55:43] mocked him
[55:45] saying Hell King of the Jews
[55:48] and they spit upon him
[55:50] and took the Reed and smold him on the
[55:52] head and after that they had mocked him
[55:55] they took the robe off from him and put
[55:59] his own garment on him and led him away
[56:01] to crucify him
[56:03] as they came out they found a man of
[56:06] Cyrene
[56:07] Simon by name him they compelled to bear
[56:11] his cross
[56:12] and when they were coming to a place
[56:14] called yagatha that is to say a place of
[56:18] a school may God bless his word he may
[56:20] be seated here in the presence of the
[56:22] Lord I would like to speak to you today
[56:24] upon a thought that the lord has laid
[56:27] upon our heart for this this weekend on
[56:30] silencing the champion
[56:33] silencing the champion and I don't know
[56:36] exactly where we will get this weekend
[56:38] or with this thought even tonight and
[56:40] even if it's in a spot I I'm going to
[56:43] get to a certain location here and to a
[56:46] destination and it doesn't matter if it
[56:48] takes me 15 minutes to get there or if
[56:50] it takes me an hour to get there I'm
[56:52] going to get there and it might be in an
[56:54] odd spot to leave Jesus in an odd spot
[56:57] to leave David but I'm going to get to a
[57:00] spot tonight and we'll just trust the
[57:02] Lord but as we said we'd like to speak
[57:04] to you on silencing the champion we see
[57:08] here that tonight that we have before us
[57:11] two great scenes that show us two great
[57:14] Champions that were set before the
[57:16] children that were set before the
[57:18] children of God these are champions that
[57:21] at that time had never lost a battle
[57:23] they had never went into a battle and
[57:26] ever thought about defeat but they were
[57:28] getting ready to you see the one that
[57:31] you're looking at is by the name of
[57:32] Goliath and the other one is by the name
[57:35] of death and we recognize that that
[57:38] Webster tells us that a champion is a
[57:41] man who undertakes a combat in the place
[57:43] or cause of another it also is a man who
[57:46] fights in his own calls or in a duel he
[57:49] is a hero He's a brave Warrior of one
[57:52] who is bold in contest as a champion for
[57:56] the truth it is also that to challenge
[57:59] to a combat a champion can be known to
[58:02] to challenge somebody to go to a combat
[58:05] and brother Brandon before he goes and
[58:07] breaks into the seals he preaches a very
[58:10] powerful message on the contest and he
[58:13] said he said you know that the Indian
[58:14] used to put a fire and they used to put
[58:17] a fire out there and they would have a
[58:18] tug of war and they would have a contest
[58:20] of strength to see which one had the
[58:23] most power they had one man on one side
[58:25] and one on the other and they put that
[58:27] fire right in the middle of them and the
[58:29] the one would pull the losing party
[58:31] across the fire he said but I want to
[58:34] speak to you for a few minutes quickly
[58:36] upon the greatest contest that there is
[58:38] that's between the church and Satan the
[58:41] great strength of Satan and we want to
[58:43] speak of the great strength of God in
[58:45] his church he said now this great
[58:47] contest has been going on for many years
[58:49] it started in heaven and Satan was
[58:52] kicked out into the Earth and then it
[58:53] became and then he became an enemy to
[58:56] God's people and since then he's used
[58:59] all of his strength and his strategy to
[59:01] try to pull God's people across the
[59:04] fires or into his fires so notice those
[59:06] words that brother random said he tried
[59:08] he's tried to pull God's people that is
[59:11] he's trying to make an attempt to pull
[59:13] God's people into his own fires that
[59:16] he's built he said but we know that who
[59:18] has the most power God does and God when
[59:21] he give his people the best thing that
[59:23] he could ever to combat Satan with was
[59:26] his word now because the word is God and
[59:28] who's stronger than God so the word is
[59:31] God and the word becomes our strength
[59:33] let's say that together the word becomes
[59:36] I our strength so God in the church
[59:38] becomes its strength to both Satan to
[59:41] his own fires that he has made and the
[59:44] tug goes on because Jesus said in Mark
[59:47] 16 that in my name shall they cast out
[59:50] devils and these two Champions that we
[59:53] see sitting before us they had raised
[59:55] their voices one for 40 years and one
[59:58] for over four thousand years it had
[1:00:00] raised its voice One champion was the
[1:00:03] descendant of anak which was which was
[1:00:06] of those of the anakims and these Giants
[1:00:09] that were of The anakim Descendants they
[1:00:12] served in a capacity that was similar to
[1:00:15] what we would compare to a foreign
[1:00:17] mercenary these were men that you called
[1:00:20] out when you knew that you needed the
[1:00:22] battle to be won and this one that David
[1:00:25] is getting ready to face or the children
[1:00:27] of Israel is getting ready to face is
[1:00:29] one by the name of Goliath he's nine
[1:00:31] foot nine he's a monster of a man
[1:00:34] he's bigger than anybody that's in the
[1:00:37] building or standing on top of somebody
[1:00:38] else he had a head like a washed up he
[1:00:42] had a head like a wash tub he had eyes
[1:00:44] that was big as a bowl and his armor
[1:00:46] appeared unto all of the children of
[1:00:49] Israel to make him appear as if he was
[1:00:52] invisible a helmet that he had upon the
[1:00:54] wash tub was over 30 pounds the
[1:00:57] spearhead that he had upon the end of
[1:00:59] his of his spear weighed over 15 pounds
[1:01:01] this Joker had 200 pounds of armor upon
[1:01:05] him he had more armor upon him than what
[1:01:08] I physically weigh in my own human
[1:01:10] vessel so to appear this man had had a
[1:01:13] complete man that was setting upon him
[1:01:15] that was covering him and Goliath's name
[1:01:18] means to uncover or it means to reveal
[1:01:21] and Goliath went down there with a
[1:01:24] purpose to go down there and try to
[1:01:26] uncover that the god of Israel was not
[1:01:29] as strong as he was but we recognize
[1:01:31] that we understand the rest of the story
[1:01:33] that Goliath was getting ready to walk
[1:01:36] down into that on that battle as a
[1:01:39] champion for the very last time
[1:01:41] but we recognize that there was one
[1:01:43] thing that that that always when men
[1:01:46] would meet men like this there was one
[1:01:48] thing that always kept them from winning
[1:01:50] and it was death and we recognize that
[1:01:52] this other Champion by the name of death
[1:01:55] he had circled thee they circled the
[1:01:58] world for four thousand years ever since
[1:02:00] the Garden of Eden he had circled and he
[1:02:03] was looking for men that he could take
[1:02:05] by the way of the grave and they could
[1:02:07] no longer live amongst their kin they
[1:02:09] could no longer be amongst those that
[1:02:10] they loved and men would look look for a
[1:02:14] spot where they could get out of that
[1:02:15] spot of death even job would he would
[1:02:18] look upon the trees he would look upon
[1:02:20] the flowers he would look upon the
[1:02:21] natural world and he would wonder about
[1:02:23] these things he said I see the tree live
[1:02:25] again but man can man live again but one
[1:02:28] day there was a revelation that struck
[1:02:31] job's heart he said I know that my
[1:02:34] redeemer lives you see because when the
[1:02:36] Revelation struck job's heart he
[1:02:38] recognized that it wasn't just for the
[1:02:40] natural life it was for his life that he
[1:02:43] was going to be able to look past what
[1:02:45] happened the vision took job all the way
[1:02:48] on the other side of Easter
[1:02:50] because men had always looked for the
[1:02:52] ability to escape death but there was a
[1:02:56] this Champion by the name of death had
[1:02:58] never lost the battle
[1:03:01] you look at men throughout the Bible
[1:03:03] Great Men by the name of Moses of
[1:03:05] Abraham you look at Men by the name of
[1:03:07] Daniel even by the name of David they
[1:03:09] were Heroes of the faith that you read
[1:03:11] about in in Hebrews chapter 11 that we
[1:03:13] recognize that the Bible tells us that
[1:03:16] they cannot be perfect without you and I
[1:03:18] but we watch as those strong figures as
[1:03:21] they as they make their entrance into
[1:03:23] the scene of the Bible we recognize that
[1:03:26] death came by their way so even though
[1:03:28] they had a stature in God's mind even
[1:03:30] though they had abilities in God's mind
[1:03:33] even though they became anointed in the
[1:03:35] presence of the Living God would come
[1:03:36] upon their vessel and my goodness they
[1:03:39] would prophesy and they would speak
[1:03:41] things that would bring life to wounds
[1:03:42] they would speak things that would bring
[1:03:45] bring life to dead situations but they
[1:03:48] still bit went to a way by the way of
[1:03:51] the Grave because death was a doorway
[1:03:53] for them
[1:03:54] because we recognize that all the way
[1:03:56] back in the Garden of Eden that there
[1:03:58] God spoke to Adam and he told him said
[1:04:00] the day that you eat thereof that day
[1:04:03] you die now you know if you go to
[1:04:05] studying out Adam's life he didn't
[1:04:06] immediately die right there but death
[1:04:09] started working in his mortal bodies
[1:04:11] there was nobody that ever lived
[1:04:13] Methuselah was the oldest one that ever
[1:04:15] lived in the Bible times and he never
[1:04:18] met he never Rich the the space of a
[1:04:21] thousand years because of that Reign is
[1:04:24] for a special people
[1:04:26] hey people that have the abilities to
[1:04:29] walk out of every chaos and live
[1:04:31] you see because God was not going to
[1:04:33] allow anybody to get to that spot of
[1:04:36] life and to prove that they had a
[1:04:38] millennial Reign but God only has a
[1:04:41] select people that have the ability to
[1:04:43] Reign throughout the millennium
[1:04:47] but you notice that all of those
[1:04:49] victories that Joshua had and Moses had
[1:04:52] and and Abraham had when he was down
[1:04:54] there fighting for Lord and his family
[1:04:55] that thing's fighting me so I'm not
[1:04:57] going to fight it
[1:04:59] but and we recognize that all of their
[1:05:01] victories that they had that they they
[1:05:03] were simply temporal victories thought
[1:05:06] Moses he went right back in the bondage
[1:05:08] and Israel went right back into bondage
[1:05:10] again and they these Heroes say they
[1:05:13] fought and they died and they still do
[1:05:15] it in Wars today in the natural Focus
[1:05:17] but you notice that they continually
[1:05:19] finally come a thing that these men
[1:05:21] would fight they would win they would
[1:05:23] fight and they would win they would
[1:05:25] fight but then they'd come to a time
[1:05:27] when they came to a spot that death took
[1:05:30] them regardless it didn't matter what
[1:05:31] their statue was it didn't matter what
[1:05:33] their last name was death came by their
[1:05:36] way but they went right on still
[1:05:37] fighting and dying fighting and dying
[1:05:39] winning victories and dying winning
[1:05:41] victories and dying but you see that man
[1:05:44] was not made to die you see it doesn't
[1:05:47] matter how sick that you are it doesn't
[1:05:48] matter what condition that you get in
[1:05:50] there is something laying there in the
[1:05:53] germ of humanity that makes you want to
[1:05:56] fight to live
[1:05:57] you find people that are on their
[1:05:59] deathbed and they're they're right there
[1:06:01] and they're waiting for their last
[1:06:02] family member to come in there and say
[1:06:04] their last I love use what are they
[1:06:06] doing they are fighting to live until a
[1:06:09] certain spot so you see man was not made
[1:06:12] to die man was made to live it doesn't
[1:06:14] matter how many achievements he had he
[1:06:16] still died just the same and he went to
[1:06:19] the grave and they buried him and that
[1:06:21] settled it this Champion had won some
[1:06:24] battles
[1:06:26] this Champion had never lost a battle
[1:06:28] when it come to dealing with Humanity
[1:06:30] but there was going to come an hour when
[1:06:32] someone was going to challenge death and
[1:06:35] put it to a combat and the one that was
[1:06:37] going to meet him is going to say that I
[1:06:40] have power to lay my life down and I
[1:06:43] have power to raise it up again the one
[1:06:45] that is going to challenge death has the
[1:06:47] ability to say to death take your hands
[1:06:49] off of God's Property
[1:06:52] this one is going to be challenged and
[1:06:56] he is going to lose
[1:06:59] I'm not just talking about Goliath here
[1:07:01] I'm talking about death there was
[1:07:03] somebody that had the guts to go down
[1:07:05] into a valley there was somebody that
[1:07:08] was willing when everybody else was
[1:07:10] willing just to stand back and look at
[1:07:12] it and look at the fight and look at how
[1:07:14] the battle was set in a ray but there
[1:07:16] was somebody that was willing to cry
[1:07:18] that was willing to cry that was willing
[1:07:20] to climb that was willing to go through
[1:07:22] the pain willing to put put blood out of
[1:07:24] their own out of their own vessel so
[1:07:26] that somebody else could understand the
[1:07:28] meaning of life
[1:07:32] foreign
[1:07:35] but David said in Psalms 3 and 6 that I
[1:07:38] will not be afraid of ten thousands of
[1:07:41] people that have set themselves against
[1:07:42] me round about arise oh Lord Save Me O
[1:07:45] my God for thou has smitten all my
[1:07:47] enemies upon the cheekbone thou has
[1:07:49] broken the teeth of the ungodly
[1:07:51] salvation belongeth through the Lord thy
[1:07:54] blessing is upon thy people Salah so
[1:07:56] notice there is there is somebody that
[1:07:59] is willing to go with you no matter what
[1:08:02] you're going through
[1:08:04] there is somebody that is willing to
[1:08:06] silence the voices in your life that say
[1:08:09] you can't make it but say you're not
[1:08:12] good enough that says you're not elect
[1:08:14] there's somebody that is in the room
[1:08:16] that wants to silence the voice of the
[1:08:19] champion of death of the Goliath of
[1:08:21] cancer that keeps screaming of the
[1:08:23] Goliath of depression or the Goliath of
[1:08:25] suicide or the thing that attaches
[1:08:28] itself to your liver or to your brain or
[1:08:30] to certain things or somebody that is
[1:08:33] wanting to be the champion of champions
[1:08:35] here tonight
[1:08:37] all right
[1:08:40] I want you to grab this picture
[1:08:43] I want you to grab this picture
[1:08:46] of Jesus
[1:08:47] standing in the midst of a crying mob
[1:08:54] you're in a spot right now where
[1:08:56] everybody here is your friend
[1:08:59] as far as I know there ain't nobody in
[1:09:02] here wanting to kill anybody in here
[1:09:04] maybe in the husband and wife maybe but
[1:09:06] you know there's nobody really in here
[1:09:08] that's in sincere danger here tonight
[1:09:10] but I want you to picture this here that
[1:09:13] that Jesus is in a spot where everybody
[1:09:16] is against him his own friends have
[1:09:19] denied him
[1:09:20] his own friends have walked away from
[1:09:22] him because Jesus is going to a spot
[1:09:24] that nobody else can go to because if
[1:09:27] you're going to ever have Victory you've
[1:09:29] got to have somebody that is willing to
[1:09:31] go to a spot that nobody else is willing
[1:09:34] to go to I want you to picture this in
[1:09:36] your mind that this one that is standing
[1:09:38] here in 16 elements that came through a
[1:09:42] virgin birth that that went through with
[1:09:44] through the Pains of coming out of his
[1:09:46] mother and coming out into this world
[1:09:48] and taking upon him the Robes of
[1:09:51] humanity so that you could understand
[1:09:53] the way that he understands the one I I
[1:09:56] present to you tonight that is standing
[1:09:58] here is none other than our Lord Jesus
[1:10:00] Christ
[1:10:01] he has the ability to turn a water into
[1:10:05] wine he has the ability to walk on
[1:10:07] Waters he has the ability to speak and
[1:10:11] things go out of their existence I want
[1:10:14] you to understand that the one that I'm
[1:10:15] speaking about In the Flesh has the
[1:10:17] ability to cast out devils and do the
[1:10:20] supernatural the one that I'm speaking
[1:10:22] to you about has the power over death
[1:10:24] when he walked to lazarus's grave he
[1:10:27] wept as a man but when he stood there in
[1:10:30] his robes as a dual nature human being
[1:10:33] standing there in the power of Jesus
[1:10:36] Christ
[1:10:37] ending there in his robes as a Son of
[1:10:40] God standing there
[1:10:42] be able to call death and show that
[1:10:46] death had met its maker
[1:10:48] this one Jesus has the ability to walk
[1:10:51] by the Widow of name's son and lay his
[1:10:53] hand upon upon the casket as it's
[1:10:56] walking by and bring life to it
[1:11:02] this man has the ability to cast demons
[1:11:05] out of legion
[1:11:06] this man has the ability to to look into
[1:11:10] things that the world cannot see he has
[1:11:12] the ability to put his hands upon
[1:11:14] something and bless it he has the
[1:11:16] ability to to feed five thousand he has
[1:11:19] the ability to preach sermons without
[1:11:21] speakers he has the ability to do all
[1:11:23] things because Jesus said all power in
[1:11:26] heaven and in Earth dwells on the inside
[1:11:29] of me there had never been anybody that
[1:11:32] was as good as our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:34] there was never been anybody that had
[1:11:37] ever walked upon the face of the Earth
[1:11:39] and said that if you destroy this hippo
[1:11:42] I raise it up again
[1:11:47] and everybody screaming crucify him
[1:11:50] crucify him the one that done all of
[1:11:53] these things that we just went through
[1:11:55] the one that saved your mother the one
[1:11:58] that saved your brother the one that
[1:12:00] helped you
[1:12:01] it's turning upon him what is it it is a
[1:12:04] release soul of devils
[1:12:06] that have been released in a moment of
[1:12:09] time to indict our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:12] to bring a curse upon him because the
[1:12:15] Bible said cursed is a man that hangs
[1:12:18] upon a tree
[1:12:19] and everybody has turned on him
[1:12:23] it's what they've done in this age
[1:12:25] they've turned on the word
[1:12:27] they say we want nothing to do with this
[1:12:29] word we want nothing to do with this
[1:12:32] what they call the message of the hour
[1:12:33] what are they doing they are again
[1:12:36] crucifying our Lord Jesus Christ they
[1:12:40] are putting him on trial before the rest
[1:12:42] of the world churches and their communes
[1:12:45] and their communism of the world he's
[1:12:47] sitting before them
[1:12:52] everybody in here
[1:12:54] if you don't mind doing something for me
[1:12:56] just start screaming real quick it's
[1:12:58] okay I'm giving you permission
[1:13:01] [Applause]
[1:13:05] now turn that voice to hatred
[1:13:15] can you stand where you're standing at
[1:13:17] when everybody hates you
[1:13:19] it was said
[1:13:21] that when Herod or pilate was standing
[1:13:23] there and he's watching the crowd and
[1:13:25] the crowd is screaming crucify him and
[1:13:27] it's screaming crucifying crucifying
[1:13:30] crucify him the only thing that pilate
[1:13:33] heard
[1:13:34] was Jesus is silence
[1:13:39] there's power and silence
[1:13:42] and your silence right now doesn't scare
[1:13:44] me but it next lets me know that you
[1:13:47] understand the power of Revelation
[1:13:50] because you're not on the side of those
[1:13:52] hollering crucify him
[1:13:56] they didn't realize what they were doing
[1:13:58] when they were crying crucify him and
[1:14:01] let his blood be upon us but when when
[1:14:03] Stalin and Hitler and Mussolini went
[1:14:06] after those Jews down there and those
[1:14:08] demonic Powers were released upon those
[1:14:11] upon them to get out upon them and
[1:14:13] anoint them to chase down those Jews
[1:14:15] what is it the Holocaust is going to be
[1:14:19] a picnic or the tribulation or the
[1:14:22] Holocaust is a picnic compared to what
[1:14:24] the tribulation is going to be like
[1:14:26] those demon powers that have been
[1:14:28] released by the river of Euphrates are
[1:14:30] going to come down and hunt out those
[1:14:32] foolish virgins
[1:14:41] but his silence
[1:14:43] was proof of Prophecy
[1:14:46] because Isaiah said that he stood before
[1:14:49] them dumb like the Sheep
[1:14:53] notice what the Bible said in Psalms 31
[1:14:55] and 18 let the lying lips be put to
[1:14:58] silence which speak Grievous things
[1:15:01] proudly and contemptuously against the
[1:15:03] righteous
[1:15:06] somebody
[1:15:07] is going to be a defeater
[1:15:10] of these champions
[1:15:14] now notice
[1:15:16] when he was here on Earth
[1:15:18] he was a great conqueror
[1:15:20] he said now now notice what brother
[1:15:22] random says here he said let's take a
[1:15:24] look at him just a moment
[1:15:27] he said there he goes up yargotha
[1:15:28] there's a noise in the street
[1:15:31] I can hear some of them say there goes
[1:15:33] that religious that religious fanatic
[1:15:36] thus goes the one who broke up our
[1:15:38] churches listen at them I can see him as
[1:15:41] he's going up the hill and his little
[1:15:43] old pale face is swole all swollen gobs
[1:15:46] of mockery is spit hanging from his
[1:15:48] beard a crown of thorns has been placed
[1:15:50] on his on his head and blood and and hot
[1:15:53] tears of Sorrow dripped off his cheek
[1:15:55] he's in that some way to conquer
[1:16:00] foreign
[1:16:01] men and women are not willing to conquer
[1:16:04] are not willing to suffer to conquer
[1:16:07] but it's the only suffering that you can
[1:16:09] conquer by
[1:16:12] there he goes every time the cross hits
[1:16:15] that little old Cobblestone his little
[1:16:16] shoulders were hurting and I noticed his
[1:16:19] robe was on his robe I noticed his robe
[1:16:22] has little Rich spots all over it and
[1:16:23] the further at the hill he goes those
[1:16:26] little spots get bigger and bigger and
[1:16:28] after a while they come to one great big
[1:16:30] bloody splotch and and his load beating
[1:16:33] you down I ditched his legs and the bee
[1:16:35] of death has begun to hum around him the
[1:16:38] sting of death he has got to taste it he
[1:16:40] must taste and when that bee began to
[1:16:43] hum around him he knew that death had
[1:16:45] laid just ahead of him but he must
[1:16:48] conquer
[1:16:50] that was the purpose he was born for was
[1:16:53] to conquer not with an atomic bomb but
[1:16:56] with a sacrifice life to Jehovah God
[1:17:03] here he is
[1:17:08] inhumanity
[1:17:10] and a flesh it didn't know sin
[1:17:13] but he took upon sin
[1:17:18] his intros are hanging out
[1:17:21] where they've took in the cat of nine
[1:17:23] tails and they've beat him
[1:17:28] this sure looks like a way to Victory
[1:17:30] don't it
[1:17:32] they hang him on a Roman Tree
[1:17:39] he placed him up on the cross
[1:17:44] and he's standing there
[1:17:48] trying to catch his breath
[1:17:53] he drops down to catch his breath
[1:17:56] as the blood begins to fill his lungs he
[1:17:59] raises back up
[1:18:03] father
[1:18:05] forgive him
[1:18:06] for they know not what they do
[1:18:18] but he's got somebody
[1:18:20] in his sight
[1:18:22] that he's looking for
[1:18:26] he's looking for the one that's called
[1:18:28] your grandmothers and your grandfathers
[1:18:30] by the way of the Grave he's looking for
[1:18:33] the one that has made your family
[1:18:35] history go down and have DNA Cycles up
[1:18:38] in them that they'll live with this
[1:18:40] certain condition where they have to
[1:18:42] battle alcoholism or they have to battle
[1:18:44] lust he's looking for that one
[1:18:47] and as Jesus is upon this cross there
[1:18:50] begin that one to begin to circle around
[1:18:52] the cross he said that's the one that
[1:18:56] I'm looking for
[1:18:57] he's looking for that champion that had
[1:19:00] never been defeated
[1:19:02] but there David is getting to a spot
[1:19:05] into the camp where all of a sudden
[1:19:07] there comes out one by the name of a
[1:19:10] Champion by the name of Goliath that is
[1:19:12] wanting to uncover that he has the
[1:19:14] greatest abilities that he has the
[1:19:16] powers to conquer every Earthly foe that
[1:19:18] come up against him he ain't never lost
[1:19:20] a battle he's a mercenary he's hired out
[1:19:23] for the job but this day was a different
[1:19:26] day for the camp of Israel
[1:19:29] because this time the Bible said when
[1:19:32] Dave or when Goliath begin to preach his
[1:19:35] message that David heard them
[1:19:38] I'm so glad that there was one by the
[1:19:41] name of our Lord Jesus Christ that heard
[1:19:43] the message of Satan that said they'll
[1:19:45] never be able to get through they're
[1:19:47] never able to live again
[1:19:50] there was somebody that heard the voice
[1:19:54] of our adversary screaming at us
[1:19:58] he's still preaching the same message
[1:19:59] that he preached when they got down
[1:20:01] there in the valley send me somebody
[1:20:02] down here send me somebody down here and
[1:20:06] same devil still preaching the same
[1:20:08] message there is no power in healing
[1:20:10] there is no Holy Ghost there is no
[1:20:12] Comfort there is no Rapture the days of
[1:20:15] Miracles are passed
[1:20:17] but this day his message has failed on
[1:20:21] their own ears because Jesus is still
[1:20:24] Jesus it might look a little bit
[1:20:26] differently he's not robed in a Galilean
[1:20:29] robe but he's in the robe and the veil
[1:20:31] of humanity
[1:20:32] [Applause]
[1:20:37] David come to a spot that he said enough
[1:20:40] is enough
[1:20:41] because Goliath the Challenger thought
[1:20:43] that he was the greatest
[1:20:46] he thought that he was the greatest
[1:20:48] now let me say something to you if you
[1:20:50] have won some battles you have the
[1:20:52] ability to say that you are a champion
[1:20:56] thought and you have not lost you have
[1:20:59] the ability to say that I have combated
[1:21:01] in many of challenges and I've never
[1:21:04] lost a battle Ang Goliath was a warrior
[1:21:07] ever since he was born because he was
[1:21:09] born with the abilities to fight
[1:21:14] when you're built like a life's built
[1:21:16] you are called unto a purpose
[1:21:23] do you realize that depression has a
[1:21:26] purpose
[1:21:27] he's built for a purpose
[1:21:30] what is his purpose is to destroy
[1:21:32] everything that you think that you can
[1:21:36] become
[1:21:37] he's trying to keep you from your
[1:21:39] happiness he's trying to keep you from
[1:21:41] your joy he's trying to keep you from
[1:21:43] the the the the the the
[1:21:44] expressions of life
[1:21:46] he's built for a purpose and when you
[1:21:49] are built by like goliathius
[1:21:53] you're going to be used in Warfare
[1:21:58] and Goliath
[1:22:00] was built for a purpose
[1:22:02] but his purpose was not going to stand
[1:22:07] his purpose even though he had won even
[1:22:09] though he'd been battled even though he
[1:22:11] had all these all these scars over top
[1:22:12] of him probably had a gnarly looking
[1:22:14] scar over his face where men had had to
[1:22:17] try to get behind that 30 pound helmet
[1:22:19] probably scarred up and ugly as all get
[1:22:21] out you imagine a guy with the size of a
[1:22:24] face of a wash tub
[1:22:28] let me tell you Max Factor ain't got
[1:22:30] anything to make that guy look good
[1:22:34] the only thing that I know that can make
[1:22:36] that Goliath look any better than he
[1:22:38] does is a rock
[1:22:40] and there's somebody that's willing to
[1:22:42] go down into a valley and make sure that
[1:22:45] he gets the appearance that he's
[1:22:46] requested
[1:22:49] I believe there's somebody that
[1:22:51] recognizes that Goliath was built for a
[1:22:53] purpose or Depression was built for a
[1:22:55] purpose or anxiety was built for a
[1:22:57] purpose or pain in your body was built
[1:22:59] for a purpose
[1:23:00] but somebody recognizes that they've got
[1:23:03] to change the looks of their oppressor
[1:23:06] somebody is going to look upon this guy
[1:23:09] on this July this giant this Goliath and
[1:23:11] say I'm more than able
[1:23:13] there's somebody that's willing to take
[1:23:15] a sling to it
[1:23:19] but you see
[1:23:21] this giant didn't have a clue he thought
[1:23:24] he was the greatest
[1:23:26] but there was a little old boy on the
[1:23:28] other side of that Hill that had had a
[1:23:30] revelation that the God that he met was
[1:23:32] more than able that the God that he had
[1:23:34] met up there on the backside of that
[1:23:36] desert that had delivered him from the
[1:23:38] bear and had delivered him from The Lion
[1:23:40] was more than able to deliver him from
[1:23:42] the mouth of this uncircumcised for
[1:23:44] listing but you see every single time
[1:23:47] that God's people start to do something
[1:23:49] the enemy always has a challenge and a
[1:23:52] challenge for you and this prehistoric
[1:23:54] giant stood out there with 14 inch
[1:23:57] fingers on him
[1:23:58] and a spear in the head in his hand the
[1:24:01] size of a Weaver's needle this spear
[1:24:03] that he's got in his hand is over 20
[1:24:06] foot tall
[1:24:10] he could just hold that thing out there
[1:24:12] and just poke fun at David
[1:24:16] you can't even get near me
[1:24:19] isn't that how the devil does you
[1:24:23] he makes you feel like like you're a
[1:24:25] puppet on a string
[1:24:28] that all he's got to do out there is
[1:24:30] reach out with his Weaver's needle and
[1:24:31] go out there and Cut You Down
[1:24:34] and you'll start collapsing isn't that
[1:24:36] how he does you that you're going to
[1:24:37] fall you're going to fall by this
[1:24:38] circumstance you're going to fall by
[1:24:40] this family tradition but you see that's
[1:24:42] what the enemy always does when he
[1:24:44] thinks he's got the upper hand upon you
[1:24:46] you see if that devil knows that there's
[1:24:49] somebody out there that really believes
[1:24:51] that they can have faith in their maker
[1:24:54] and they can conquer that brother random
[1:24:56] say that that devil will never do that
[1:24:58] when he looks out there and he sees that
[1:25:00] real conquering faith
[1:25:02] you see the devil recognizes when
[1:25:05] there's real faith and when there's an
[1:25:07] intellectual Faith let me tell you there
[1:25:09] was nobody that was willing to walk down
[1:25:11] into that Valley with their laptop or
[1:25:13] their iPad but there was somebody that
[1:25:15] was willing to go down to that Valley
[1:25:17] that had met God face to face somebody
[1:25:20] that knew what it was like to go through
[1:25:22] the fires and go through the floods and
[1:25:24] prove that God was still God
[1:25:27] come on somebody I don't face enough of
[1:25:29] these critics that all they want to do
[1:25:31] is sit behind their iPads and sit behind
[1:25:33] their keyboards
[1:25:35] but I'm a kind of guy that I know the
[1:25:38] kind of God that I serve and it's God of
[1:25:41] David he was God of Moses he was God of
[1:25:44] Paul he was God of William Branham and
[1:25:46] he's my God
[1:25:48] you might be serving a God that's a
[1:25:51] wimpy God that doesn't know how to show
[1:25:53] up to battle but the god that I'm
[1:25:55] serving is the kind of God that never
[1:25:58] leaves you where you are God did not
[1:26:01] bring you to this battle so that you
[1:26:03] could lose
[1:26:06] you're going out one way or never going
[1:26:09] out you're going out in Victory
[1:26:17] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:26:19] [Applause]
[1:26:27] he said he won't come near that real
[1:26:30] Sanctified holy life
[1:26:34] that's what shakes the devil
[1:26:37] I was reading today
[1:26:39] brother by name is
[1:26:40] he's going through a line of discernment
[1:26:43] and he's standing there and he says what
[1:26:44] about you sir sitting on the edge of
[1:26:45] your seat there he said I see you
[1:26:48] believing I see you believing for your
[1:26:50] need and he tells him his need and he
[1:26:53] said he said that kind of scared you he
[1:26:55] said you didn't realize you had that
[1:26:57] much faith in you
[1:26:59] and it might shock you tonight how much
[1:27:01] Faith you got sitting here how much
[1:27:04] power that you got sitting here you
[1:27:06] think when I just come into the building
[1:27:07] like I did every other weekend you had
[1:27:09] enough Faith to sit down in the chair
[1:27:11] you didn't test the chair out before you
[1:27:13] sat down in the chair you didn't test
[1:27:15] your car out before you went out there
[1:27:17] and started it you had enough faith to
[1:27:20] go out there and start the car come down
[1:27:22] the road you didn't come here we didn't
[1:27:24] come here and sit in all these chairs
[1:27:26] and say Well they're cable to hold about
[1:27:28] 200 pounds in each of them you simply
[1:27:31] had enough Faith to set down upon that
[1:27:33] chair
[1:27:35] well I don't know if I got faith or not
[1:27:37] that scared you didn't it that kind of
[1:27:40] shocked you that you had that kind of
[1:27:42] faith and you may not realize that you
[1:27:44] got the kind of Faith have the ability
[1:27:46] to go Goliath down into a valley and
[1:27:49] said I'm your Champion today
[1:27:52] it's time that you start silencing the
[1:27:55] voices in your life
[1:28:01] come on somebody you want him to be your
[1:28:03] protector voice your opinion to almighty
[1:28:06] God you want him to be your provider let
[1:28:09] him be a provider
[1:28:12] foreign
[1:28:15] it might shock you but if I was you I'd
[1:28:18] take a leap of faith
[1:28:20] but the enemy's always going to stand up
[1:28:22] there and taunt at you and hunt at you
[1:28:24] as long as he thinks he's got the edge
[1:28:27] on you
[1:28:28] but I'm like Paul said in Acts chapter
[1:28:31] 20 and 24 none of these things move me
[1:28:35] well I'm going through struggles and I'm
[1:28:37] going through pain you recognize that
[1:28:39] the Bible said in second Samuel 5 and 17
[1:28:42] that when David was anointed king over
[1:28:45] Hebrew that the Philistines when they
[1:28:47] heard this they immediately started to
[1:28:50] seek after David
[1:28:52] let me tell you when you got something
[1:28:54] that's worth having you're going to have
[1:28:56] a contention you're going to have a
[1:28:58] Warfare on your hand and if you've got
[1:29:01] Holiness the devil's going to fight you
[1:29:03] for it if you've got a real clean
[1:29:05] atmosphere the devil's going to fight
[1:29:07] you for it but power is developed by
[1:29:10] resistance a Canon can only throw forth
[1:29:14] its power twice its power because of the
[1:29:16] exploding power of the resistance
[1:29:19] electricity is produced in a Powerhouse
[1:29:22] Yonder by sharp friction of the
[1:29:25] revolving of the wheels and the presence
[1:29:27] and the the afflictions that you've gone
[1:29:30] through you are going to turn around and
[1:29:32] say that Satan was used to be your
[1:29:35] blessing
[1:29:40] what am I saying to you I'm saying that
[1:29:42] everything that you're going through
[1:29:45] it's worth fighting for
[1:29:51] let me tell you
[1:29:52] if Holiness is worth fighting for
[1:29:55] if it's worth having
[1:29:57] then somebody's got to fight for it
[1:30:01] come on somebody if mamas and daddies if
[1:30:03] the Holy Ghost is worth having you got
[1:30:06] to fight for it
[1:30:08] come on if we want to if we want to look
[1:30:11] like the world and dress like the world
[1:30:13] it shows that something is missing on
[1:30:16] the inside of us
[1:30:18] because the enemy's going to stay there
[1:30:20] as long as you let him stay there
[1:30:23] come on young girls your Holiness is
[1:30:26] worth fighting for come on mamas and
[1:30:28] daddies
[1:30:29] [Applause]
[1:30:30] your abilities to be men and to be women
[1:30:33] is worth fighting for
[1:30:37] brother Bynum said cut every enemy if an
[1:30:40] old spook oh Spirit make you feel he
[1:30:42] said cut that thing away he said with
[1:30:44] the word of the Lord he said but our
[1:30:46] strength the joy of the Lord is my
[1:30:49] strength so what you've got to do is
[1:30:52] every enemy that you come up against
[1:30:53] you've got to cut him down by the word
[1:30:56] of the Lord and say get away from me
[1:30:57] whack cut him you've got to cut him with
[1:31:00] a word whether it be a demon whether it
[1:31:01] be an enemy whether it be sickness
[1:31:03] whether it be disease whatever it is
[1:31:05] take that word and pull it with a sword
[1:31:08] and if you whack it the first time and
[1:31:10] it don't seem to move whack it again and
[1:31:12] whack it again and whack it again and
[1:31:14] whack it until you chipped a hole right
[1:31:16] through like a chicken or an eagle
[1:31:18] pooping its way through pimp yourself
[1:31:20] right on through that old Shell of
[1:31:22] sickness cut your way out and say
[1:31:24] hallelujah where's the next one
[1:31:26] that's the battle there's a soldier
[1:31:28] that's the soldier of the Cross knock
[1:31:31] out every enemy but the enemy's always
[1:31:34] standing around wanting to give a
[1:31:36] compromise I tell you what you do I'll
[1:31:38] come down here and fight and you send me
[1:31:40] somebody else out here that you think's
[1:31:42] worthy enough to fight me what is he
[1:31:44] looking for he's looking for a way out
[1:31:47] but I'll say that it's time that you
[1:31:49] serve notice on the devil I'd say we're
[1:31:51] not compromising
[1:31:56] I'll tell you what he does
[1:31:58] he'll show you something
[1:32:00] out there in the world and say that it's
[1:32:02] okay for you to bring into the house of
[1:32:04] the Lord
[1:32:05] what is he wanting you to do he's
[1:32:06] wanting you to compromise he want to
[1:32:08] compromise on your dress he'll
[1:32:09] compromise on your spirit he'll
[1:32:11] compromise on your worship he'll
[1:32:13] compromise on your prayer life he will
[1:32:15] make you compromise well you know what
[1:32:16] you prayed yesterday morning and you've
[1:32:18] had enough time with the Lord let me
[1:32:20] tell you if Suzanne Wesley had 17
[1:32:23] children and she had enough time to go
[1:32:26] out there into a river and go out there
[1:32:28] and clean 17 children their clothes and
[1:32:32] get out there and pray two or three
[1:32:34] hours a day
[1:32:36] she didn't have the ability to press a
[1:32:38] button but she had the ability to serve
[1:32:41] God
[1:32:41] she didn't dabble in the things of the
[1:32:43] world
[1:32:45] she began to serve
[1:32:47] the Lord
[1:32:51] what is it worth I'll tell you what it's
[1:32:53] worth it produced one of the greatest
[1:32:55] songwriters that's ever been and It
[1:32:57] produced a church-aged messenger by the
[1:33:00] name of John Wesley well you say well I
[1:33:02] don't know what I'm going to do I will
[1:33:04] say this that your prayer life might be
[1:33:06] the prayer that changes the situation in
[1:33:10] these young people's lives
[1:33:13] God keep our young people God protects
[1:33:16] him keep them with a standard of
[1:33:18] Holiness like never before I'll say that
[1:33:20] that prayer is worth praying
[1:33:26] but he wants you to compromise
[1:33:32] this might be a little bit strange
[1:33:34] but in 1996 there was a
[1:33:37] there was a baseball convention that
[1:33:38] took down in Nashville Tennessee down at
[1:33:41] the Opryland hotel and there was over
[1:33:43] four four thousand four thousand uh
[1:33:46] baseball coaches all the way from Little
[1:33:48] League all the way to Major League
[1:33:49] Baseball that came and they were having
[1:33:51] this great convention and all these
[1:33:53] coaches are sitting there and they come
[1:33:55] here with the anticipation to hear some
[1:33:57] of the greatest baseball coaches that
[1:33:59] had ever been some of the greatest
[1:34:00] trainers that have had learned certain
[1:34:02] techniques and they they come to the the
[1:34:04] climax of the meeting and they were
[1:34:06] talking about they were talking about
[1:34:07] who's going to be the evening speaker
[1:34:09] and there was a man there was a coach by
[1:34:11] the name of John scoilenis that that is
[1:34:14] known for being a football coach and a
[1:34:16] baseball coach and he's he's got an
[1:34:18] unlimited wealth or unlimited knowledge
[1:34:20] in the in the world of baseball and men
[1:34:22] were looking forward to hearing him
[1:34:24] speaking and so they had all of the
[1:34:26] events of the evening and as John comes
[1:34:28] up there and he's standing there before
[1:34:29] all of these thousands of people and
[1:34:31] they're under great anticipation we're
[1:34:33] going to hear how that better we're
[1:34:34] going to hear how how to have I have
[1:34:36] better home runs going to hear all of
[1:34:37] these things and and John comes up there
[1:34:40] and he stands behind the podium but when
[1:34:41] they get up there when John gets up
[1:34:43] there he's got this string around his
[1:34:44] neck got this string around his neck and
[1:34:47] on his up on the bottom that string he's
[1:34:49] got a full-size home-based plate there
[1:34:51] hanging off of his neck and everybody
[1:34:52] begins to chuckle and laugh about it and
[1:34:54] John gets up there and he speaks for 25
[1:34:56] minutes
[1:34:57] and everybody's like man this dude says
[1:34:58] I lost it he's
[1:35:00] giving he's giving his speech but
[1:35:02] everybody can't pay no attention to his
[1:35:04] speech because he's got this home plate
[1:35:06] that's hanging around his neck he said
[1:35:08] now I know y'all think I'm old and y'all
[1:35:09] think I'm crazy he said but I want to
[1:35:11] teach you something about baseball that
[1:35:12] I've learned throughout the lessons of
[1:35:14] life
[1:35:14] and he said now he said uh anybody in
[1:35:17] here know how wide and Little League
[1:35:19] baseball home plate is and somebody they
[1:35:23] they begin to roam around all those
[1:35:25] thousands of people that are sitting
[1:35:26] there and they said somebody said is it

[1:36:18] pro baseball pitcher that cannot hit the
[1:36:21] target
[1:36:24] over 17 inches he said what do we do he
[1:36:27] said do we say well
[1:36:29] you know what
[1:36:30] since you're so great and you can throw
[1:36:32] 99 mile an hour we'll compromise on it a
[1:36:35] little bit and we'll get you a 20 inch
[1:36:37] plate
[1:36:38] or a 25 inch plate
[1:36:40] he said no what you're going to do is
[1:36:42] you're going to send him back to
[1:36:43] training he said but what do we do he
[1:36:45] said coaches what do we do when we have
[1:36:49] one of our best players come into our
[1:36:50] midst and we've asked them to dress a
[1:36:53] certain way and they don't dress that
[1:36:54] way if we've asked them to be clean
[1:36:56] saving and they come out with a full
[1:36:58] beard what do we do he said what do we
[1:37:00] do if we catch them out there drinking
[1:37:01] or catch them out there smoking because
[1:37:03] they're our best player do we just uh do
[1:37:06] we change the rules so that they can fit
[1:37:08] in or do we do we make them accountable
[1:37:11] for what they're doing so just because
[1:37:14] you can't hit the target
[1:37:16] we don't change the status
[1:37:18] and just because you're living the type
[1:37:21] of life that you're living and you don't
[1:37:22] have the results of the power of
[1:37:24] Holiness doesn't mean that the message
[1:37:26] changes we didn't change the message to
[1:37:30] fit you we didn't change the dress where
[1:37:32] we didn't change the way that we look

[1:38:52] Saul without an anointing
[1:38:55] you got one job
[1:38:59] I left that better than I thought I was
[1:39:01] going to leave it I thought I was going
[1:39:02] to have David down in the valley all
[1:39:03] night I think y'all be able to sleep
[1:39:05] better with him up here on the hill
[1:39:06] right

[1:40:06] of the book in the middle of the book
[1:40:08] and at the end of the book
[1:40:11] said If any man adds or takes away

[1:40:45] going through
[1:40:46] says that you're more than able to walk
[1:40:48] down there
[1:40:52] and do the job
