TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] sometime ago i was reading in a book of a little boy that was entered a contest and in this contest he was to make himself a famous name any little boy who could keep the password in his mind until he got to a certain place and he would speak this password and the gatekeeper would let him through that was to test the iq of the child and when he got to the place speaking the passwords that was given him the gate would open and he would win a great honor one little boy being very swift-footed and no good and well that he could outrun all the rest of the boys in the contest or he thought he could practiced day after day of running how he pumped up his little lungs got his physical body and trim so that he wouldn't tire as he runs and he practiced how to start with his feet and get a head plunge ahead of the rest of the boys how that he must breathe during the time of his running in order to hold the oxygen that came to his body to keep him pumping on that it wouldn't slow up his heart too much he studied it from every angle that he could and in the morning that the race started there was more than 150 little boys lined up at a certain age this little boy was rather a good size boy for his age and he remembered all of his training and he got ready they got on the line pop their little faces against the string that come along push their little nose up against it it studied all the rules of that making himself ready and then when the gun fired and the lion was broken the little boy jumped forward and this little guy so physically fit until he jumped way ahead of the rest of him and down the track he went with a terrific speed well trained until he could outrun every boy that was in the race and he was there oh quite a long time maybe a minute or more before the best of the other runners ever reached the place but all of his physical training he had forgotten the password he had forgotten the very thing that he was to say to let him in the gate and he paced back and forth and stalled it searched to his mind he had been so interested in the natural natural physical conditions of his body till he had forgotten the main thing on down the line some boys that didn't run so fast remember the password and entered in so is it today we are so interested in building great shrines and churches and buildings and so forth i'm so interested in keeping our churches in good trim with fine buildings and nice plush pews and fine organs are ministers so well trained from they've got dr d l p h d l l d degrees but we forgot what we're running for that's the

certainly good to see you amen we love you with all of our hearts wish everybody could be here amen i trust you enjoyed last night last night brother andrew he just kind of talked about our dna from another realm and that was uh that was quite incredible and so we certainly enjoyed that with all of our hearts we certainly love you and so good to see you wish we could hug your neck and brother bill was waving at me a moment ago and and i i just i just it's just uh we're family that's all we can say is we're family and we miss one another and we we appreciate your your prayers for us during this season and our prayers for you the ones that have been very sick those that have graduated and went on beyond the river and got ahead of us just a bit and so amen so we i i stood at the casket yesterday of brother john and and i i'll just have to tell you brother joe it just doesn't seem real real just a few weeks ago he was mowing grass and talking with us on the phone of course he was sick for just a couple of days there before before going to the hospital brother joe i'll just share this with you he he spoke to me on the day he went to the hospital and and he talked to me for 15 minutes on john john and he told me he said i'd like to see him i'd like to i'd like to go be with him a little bit and that was our last conversation as a pastor and a deacon and i i thought you know god granted the request or had a pull on him amen i think you guys talked a bit about railroads and and things like that yeah amen thank god there's a land beyond the river amen so remember us in prayer as we would go there today to to speak that funeral and it seemed like we're having too many of them of late but there seems like i told connie coming down the driveway today god seems like he's just kind of going along and picking flowers and therefore they're for the resurrection witness i don't know if you notice what's happened there for this generation's resurrection witness that they'll step into this dimension to let us know its rapture time and when we see them it will give us faith oh brother on how will i have faith for rapture you see them you see them you won't need a sermon or a quote or dig through your bible it'll be something energize you to get you ready to go to that that place and so amen i i personally can't wait to see my mother and brother homer and what a meeting that's going to be amen we we love you i want to share with you that the director i spoke with him yesterday of the funeral that's taking place today he said now he said we've only have limited seating and and they've taken out half of their chairs and so and he said when those chairs feel we're just going to lock the door he said might seem cruel but that's what the law of the land is and so but they do have it to where that you can watch it by the way of help me streaming and so so if you if you choose to do it that way we we appreciate your prayers brother andrew and myself will be speaking it today and we want to pray for the family that god would just be with them amen stand to our feet amen i'd like for you to turn with me in your scriptures to hebrews 11 verse 8. amen god bless you thank you for your prayers uh we are i have several tests tomorrow and uh at uva and so i re if you just remember that it's going to be an all-day deal and so pray that god would just be with us they'll be checking many things tomorrow and amen they're checking things i didn't know i had so amen so you pray for us that god would be with us or we're just having a lot of trouble since we had the kobe with the sugar and my sugar is running between five and six hundred on most days and and so that causes you causes you a lot of issues amen amen hebrews chapter 11 and verse 8 by faith abraham and when he was called out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in a land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him on the same promise for he looked for a city which have foundations whose builder and maker is god so happens you and i are looking for the same city through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the of the sky and a multitude and as a sand which was by the sea sure innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims of the earth for they say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came they might have had an opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is a heavenly that's my desire wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he hath prepared for them a city you may be seated this morning he is god and if he thought of us before the foundation of the world that was our beginning and then we stepped out of out of eternity into a little space called time some of us will get decades some will be slipped away at birth some will live to be in their 90s maybe even into a hundred but what is that in the space of eternity and then we slip back into eternity again jesus told us that he went to prepare for us a city he went to he went to take care of those things he's the great provider he reminded us that this is not our world sometimes we we get all attached here but this is not our home this is our passing through this is the place and we are regardless of how the end is regardless of how the end is and what the little piece that they put on the paper god knew what hour that we would leave and sometimes he's not real dainty how he takes us home we enjoy the things here in life we enjoy our family we enjoy our homes we enjoy our work we enjoy our accomplishments we enjoy once we we we begin to feel the pull of god now let me just say you didn't seek for god but god came looking for you and many times he found us in trouble running hiding from god and he found us and he knew where we were at and like with adam he came through the garden screaming adam where art thou your garden was a bar room or or some other place it wasn't very reputable but god knew where you're at and he was not ashamed are you with me sometimes we get ashamed of our old book and what it was like and and the acts that we had done and sometimes in our reminiscence we begin to remind ourselves of what we were but it took just as much as the mercies of god and the grace of god for you as it did anybody else but god provided for that and he was not ashamed to come get you but this is not the only place that he's going to fellowship with you he wants to bring you home brother branham says and from that time he says whatever you do whatever you do friends let me just ask you if you believe me to be a servant of god let me tell you something don't you miss that wonderful place i'd like to bring just a couple of thoughts for you just for a moment abraham knew what that place was like because he met the king now he had fellowshipped with him at altars but that king came and stepped through his gate and the atmosphere from those altars and his voice was in that body and it was without question who he was because immediately abraham calls him god lord elohim immediately he identifies what world he's from and he stepped out of that out of that heavenly realm and picked up the elements of the earth and stepped into a body and now he's fellowshipping with abraham now what did he do for abraham it changed his body it turned him young again and when he talked about that city jerusalem not the one on earth but when he talked about that city jerusalem it so anchored something in abraham throughout the generations everyone would be looking for that same city are you with me as a matter of fact i'm looking for that city i'm looking for that city brother branham said that brother biscuit said brother branham he said they got to a certain place on the alaskan highway and he said it was a look-off said did we pull off the side of the interstate and he said you could see for 600 miles he said just big valley just beautiful country and he said brother branham just looked at it said he just stood there and he just looked at it he was just mesmerized by it and he said this is what it looks like there you know sometimes i stand on the edge of our pavement and i look over across this valley and look into these mountains and big meadows up there and all of the leaves are starting to change there's not an artist in the world can paint that right you've got one of the prettiest front yards you'll ever get for a church but it reminds us of home hallelujah brother branham said we're in two worlds he said he stood in two worlds there's something about home it's like a magnetizing force that is drawing us you didn't put that there you couldn't put that there but god put something on the inside of you that maybe your neighbor don't have people that you work with don't have and you realize that we're dwelling in the same space but this is not home it's just not home we realize that our days days of trouble and days of sorrow and you know a man is born of woman few days and full of trouble we're going to have trouble we're going to have anxieties we're going to have issues of life but there's something about us there's a drawing power that begins to pull on our lives and we realize that this world wasn't made to stay stay in for eternity are you with me if it don't if it don't take you long just just just go through the news and the new cycles i i hate this voting time the high tension and the the the pull this way or that way and and just the talking of of power is going on i i i just kind of raggles me sometimes this is not my world this is not the place that i want to be at over the last year i i fought with a disease that is trying to kill me and it tells me that this is not my home are you with me there will be a day to where cancer won't have a grip on me [Applause] hallelujah [Music] brother branham said the sun can draw a million gallons of water with less noise than we can pump a gr our glass full of water out of a pump the heavens can sprinkle glue all over the earth with less noise then you can sprinkle your front yard did you ever hear the planets turn only a prophet can say it like this great things are quiet things watch the holy spirit when it comes in tonight how quiet it gets everything but we're after sensations and runnings and after little things and we fail to hear the voice of god he's going to say some pretty astounding things right here and i want you to hold it did you ever hear the day break i was sitting in the woods yesterday and i had this quote in front of me i actually had this in front of me sitting on a seat and watching the daybreak come up and i had this quote in front of me and i listened for daybreak i didn't hear it i didn't hear it i didn't hear it but brother ron the quote was there yeah but i didn't hear it i saw as it come and it begins to push back the darkness i didn't hear it i didn't hear it in about 20 minutes you could begin to see images of trees before long it was light how many ever turn a flashlight on in the middle of the day you go i don't see my flashlight it must not be working there's a greater light there's a greater light that dispels the darkness sometimes your trials are so dark your situations are so dark you can't help it well i'm just going to fix myself it's kind of like me going okay i'm going to tell cancer to leave today and cancer you're going to go out of my body and and tomorrow i'm going to be well well first of all i'm not the healer are you with me today i'm going to take a rapture i'm tired of this whole world forgive me for my foolishness but there's a higher force there's a higher force that has control of our lives of our miracles of our needs of our body change and in that season you with me brother brown said i don't want to be a coward when it comes that time for me to go home he said i want to look at it and say come get me hallelujah that's what i really believe in the moment in the twinkling this body becomes young i don't see that brother ron but you can't look in that realm as i was told just the other day see past what you see think past what you think did you ever hear the day break no you've never heard the day break yet it scatters all darkness if we would only listen to the voice of him that speaks behind those things we can only hear the voice of him that speaks behind these things i think sometimes we come to church we see a dress we see people's shoes some child we hear good music song leader sings preacher sings don't let it be just poetry don't let it be just another sermon somewhere in there was something for you and it was drawing you closer home are you with me now brother branham was standing in the mirror and he was combing his hair and he said i haven't lost to one and his wife's she's not in the same spiritual world that he's in and she said oh billy she begins to tell him he said i'll tell you i haven't lost the one he knows where every one of them are at one day they'll all be back again i'm struggling with the situation because of the cancer medicine it's causing my hair to be frivoly i don't know if that's a good word to say or frizzy and i've got curly hair but now it's it's on super max and i understand what you sisters are doing just to get it to lay in a certain way and now i'm having to deal with all of that and everything's just frizzy and i'm seeing hair in my in my on my clothes and i'm seeing it in the deal and i'm thinking where's my hair going and i'm thankful for everyone that's holding on hallelujah but it tells me there's a land there's something at work in my body that tells me that i'm going home [Music] you remember brother branham talks in in brother frazier's favorite sermon spiritual amnesia and there's a train and men are taking boys that have amnesia taking them to a place an institution it must have been a great time of the war because the boys were so affected and they didn't know who they were didn't know where their home was didn't know their situations you know i think america's there now i think our i think the world is there now and so they come to a water they come to a spot to where that they'll rest they'll refill the mother greg you wouldn't know all about that they'd refill the engines and the boy stepped off and he got to looking and he saw a water tower and when he saw that water tower something came to him and he started walking toward it well instead of stopping him one of the guards followed him good wisdom and he followed him and when he got to the water tower he found a path and he started walking that path and he followed that path up over a hill and he up over another hill and then another hill and he comes down into a valley and there was a little homestead there with smoke coming out of the stack and when that boy gets down off of the hill he comes to the he comes to the fence and there's an old father standing there and he said i prayed i prayed for you every day and now you're home brother random used that as an analogy more than just a story about sometimes we're going to wander and we're going to lose ourselves but god's place something on the inside of you that'll draw you back to where you came from i stood in the waters with brother flint take and brother don babilus in alaska they call it salmon run and those salmon are trying to go home and they and science says there's a magnetism on the inside of them and literally a smell when they get to their stream their little bitty stream of where they were bored at and even if they came out of a birthing center and to where that they were they came out of a pipe about that long that wide no way could they get back in but those salmon will travel for thousands of miles and they'll come through all kind of nettings of fish bear eagles even sometimes great water falls and they'll fight their way because something on the inside of them has told them to go home and lay your eggs it's a safe place [Applause] fight your way back to home get yourself back there [Applause] come on church god's taught us by nature and there's pictures that you can find to where those salmon will come to the pipe and put their nose on the pipe to win when they were a little bitty guy swam out of brother branham says there's a stage with an eagle so it's called the moping period it will also be used a term called molten period to where their eyes will get filmed over and they need to go renew themselves where do they do that at home they search out that place called home and they go back there and maybe the other eagles will encourage them and strengthen them and scream to them and there come a stage when that when that film is over top of them they'll begin to beat their heads until they get that off of them you know sometimes i think we need to do that we need to go back to the altar and just beat the world off of it are you with me just get that you know the cares of life you know sometimes it becomes so complex life itself the cares of life becomes so complex until if we're not careful we can sit in pews and backslide we come to church and backslide shake the same hands and backslide and don't realize that god we've allowed ourselves to slip away from god or if we could go back to that rock lay aside the pride to go back to that spot that is truly home i said in the office the other morning about two weeks ago three weeks ago about four o'clock in the morning with a presence that is way beyond this world like i never felt sitting right there in my office you know in that presence there was no care about my job it wasn't a thought about money or a home it wouldn't have thought about politics for about 20 minutes i said in a presence maybe like abraham said in the clock on the wall meant nothing i don't know about you but i really love coming to this place brother ron but some people have passed here aren't you afraid no brother on people are sick i don't mean to get any hurt any feelings or cause you any problems andrew but let me just tell you at the first church of walmart they've had people sick at the first church of walmart they've had people die that's i'm stealing this from you brother bill you know that at the first church of walmart they're not taking care of who's got a mask on and who don't at the first church of walmart they're not too much worried about the social distancing there's no rapture promised at the first church of walmart you won't get a revival there but satan will put a fear on you if i go to church i'm going to get the bug this is a blessed place you can come well i don't know who's a carrier who's not a carrot who cares i i may be a little wild here but who cares we're going to be sensible here but god's here but brother john but brother john would have died of a heart attack if it would not have been for covet he may have been hit by a train if your days are ordered and your time is ordered you can name it a lot of different things but when it's time to go home this cancer has tried to kill me all year long but it can't take me until the clock ticks at a certain time it can't take me home until god takes me home [Applause] i was standing the other day with a mask on in a public place and this old man is rude you know people get older they get ruder they ain't got the holy ghost they get ruder and you just walked right up into my face and he said you must be a democrat and i said no you missed that one why are you wearing your mask democrats wear a mask i said well i don't believe that either i said but i have cancer and i also have common sense now this might be my home here for temporary purposes and i'm going to use common sense but i know where i get my strength from the scripture said yet a little while you'll see me no more where was he going home this world is not my home he's the king of that world but he had to have citizens so he came to this world to get them are you with me now let me just say if you're comfortable in this world that world won't be home to you i hear people talk about heaven what heaven's going to be like what the new world's going to be like and i look at their life they're not going to be comfortable there you can't wear those kind of clothes there you can't listen to that kind of music there you can't have that evil tongue there you can't have an evil life and live in that city there you can't chew that tobacco even billy graham said you chew your tobacco you'll have to go to hell to spit [Applause] hallelujah you as a group look like a people from that place i heard andrew preaching last night and he was just going along the young people young people let me just say this to you when you're picking a mate don't pick a project don't pick somebody that you go when i marry them they'll change they don't change only god can change a person you picked somebody help me preach yes you are you pick somebody that is a whole person with christ they've already met christ and now you might have influence with their toothpaste well i'm not going to marry a preacher sister connie said she had some things not going to marry short men not going to marry a red-headed man not going to marry a preacher that worked out well didn't it i wonder how she likes this blonde head now jesus said i tell you a truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death i believe that as jesus was going to ascend and they were going to personally watch him leave and the worlds were going to blend that they realized when jesus said i'll tell you the truth there'll be some standing here which shall not take death in a few days they were going to watch jesus turn younger and then gravitation was going to lose its pull and then they knew that they had met the same one that abraham you know brother shannon i've watched your life it's it's an amazing it's an amazing journey to me i knew you as a boy i knew you as you were a young man i knew you as a young married couple with habits in your life i've never counseled you in the office i've never sat down with you but i've watched habits just leave well i've got to really work on this no no no you just fall in love with god and the attributes of home begin to live in here so much because you've met the king of the city and before long you can just see it on them you can literally just see it on them and they're just so different you knew them in another world i personally love to hear the story of brother biskell talking about when they were wrestling that horse because they had to take it and they were putting it they were locking it down to a tree to try to break it and that horse was going to kill itself and it's just breathing and lathering up and they're beating that animal and shaking that animal because they need it as a pack horse and brother biscuit is he's from that country he knows what it's going to take we shouldn't be even taking an animal and he said i thought to myself you know they knew where we were coming why didn't bud have the horses ready we're chasing horses all over the place and you've heard this story a thousand times and and he said we're standing there and i'm thinking we've got to be on the on our journey and he said i'm thinking about but getting this horse in line and this horse is just a ruckus and he's going to kill somebody and he said all of a sudden that horse just quieted down he said he literally he said i've never seen anything like it he said he just quieted down and he said you just quit blowing and said he just became as calm as he could be and he said i was witnessing this miracle right in front of me and he said i turned and brother branham was putting his hat back on and he said i realized that the god of humanity was also the god of nature now for the critic let's let me just answer you here i lived in pilot and we had a farm your mom and dad's house is there and right up on the hill is a is a farm as well and there's a man named george lived up there and george raised horses never broke them but he raised horses there and those horses were wild horses and there was a man named robert sheffy that came through he had just gave his horse away because somebody had need of a horse and so he goes to george's place and and he tells george i need a horse i've just gave mine away for the cause of jesus christ and george says help yourself he said they're wild if you contain them i'll give it to you and he picked up he picked up an apple and he walked out into the middle of the field he had prayer he walked up to a horse and gave it an apple laid his hand on it and prayed for it and he called for his saddle he put his saddle on it and his reigns on it anybody that knows anything about horses knows this is impossible and he got on the horse he blessed george george lived to over a hundred years old i'd say it's quite a blessing i worked for george and he gave us a dime for a day bless his heart god pays all of his debts you say well brother ron what does that have to do with anything i'm coming to an end jesus said go get me a cult the fall of an ass whether you realize it or not that cult has never had a rider it's humanly impossible brother john i'd say you look you you look like a man that knows something about horses let me say this to you a man on his horse a woman and his horse there's just something there girls in their horse i better quit preaching that way or i'll go buy a horse again but they brought this fall of an ass and they brought it to jesus and that which was humanly impossible jesus got on it and he rode it into the city which should have been his home and they should have recognized he's the god over nature he's not just god of miracles but he's god over nature we play you uh we play you a video many times before service i will take you back home i will take you back home my children god has gathered them after 2 000 years of exile in many nations and they come home with just the clothes on their back and if you know anything about of israel today she's number one in military she's number one in produce she's number one in science she's number one in almost every major category in the world yet the world wants to extinguish her but there's a king coming the king that to you thousand years ago rode into that home place but not just that king is coming i'm coming with him i'm coming home you may not recognize me but when you hear my voice you'll know that's brother ron that's brother ron he's about 60 pounds lighter flowing red hair and got the energy of ally you know i watch her play in my front yard she doesn't sit down and go i'm tired and i watch her she makes me tired watching my eyes almost get disarrayed her movements but i think about her movements it's an energy it's an energy to go to one place to another without any without any human seem like human effort and god's gonna restore that back to me can i give you one more scripture maybe maybe i'd like to just share this with you it meant something to me this week when i read it aliens from other countries are rarely shown the welcome map they're often accepted reluctantly or with tongue-in-cheek they may even find themselves victims of discriminations rejection intolerances the bible says that we are aliens and strangers in this world our citizenship is in heaven and that is where our real home is and as long as we live in this earth we don't fit in our customs are different our goals are different our ways our living is different and our concerns are different and as christ followers instead of being the followers of the world we may find ourselves rejected persecuted we shouldn't be surprised jesus christ warned us if they persecuted me they will also persecute you never forget you're a citizen of the kingdom of god and someday you will be home brother branham taught us told us a story about a man that was a missionary and then there was a great group of like a musical group and he said when they got off of the train there was a huge group that was that was there to welcome them home massive group and not one person was there to welcome him home and he walked down he walked down the ramps and he kind of feeling sorry for himself i understand some of that i've made some of those walks kind of feeling sorry for themselves and as they walked down walked down and it was kind of just feeling nobody here to meet me nobody nobody no bands playing no no welcome and a voice spoke to him and said you're not home yet i don't know and i don't even adventure but let me just let me just have a folly here for a moment the other day when brother john's time was to go on this realm there wasn't hardly anybody could be with him to say goodbye and we kind of sometimes look at that as very difficult because covet has caused us to not to be able to be there with them when they go by but it's not so when they're in another realm you know once they arrive there's things that are called and and the name is called and there's a group that sent down to the river to meet them and we've got quite a delegation that'll be standing on the other side everybody's young and everybody knows every they know everything and there's no clock that's like i dreamed here here not long ago that i was slipping across and as i was slipping across and i was standing there and and brother brother frazier's father was standing there and he said i wanted to meet you he said i just kind of wanted to be the one to meet you and homer's pushing him back and he said i got some things to tell him and he said give me a chance homer i want to talk to him too hallelujah what a land what a land beyond the river a place called home for you and i no more sugar to beat us i'm running into spots now that i forget things and i've got a wonderful team around me that they almost read my mind and they'll tell me a name or tell me a place they don't judge me because i'm forgetting things they don't do that they don't go daddy you're getting older you know they just know that there's things at work in my brain that not supposed to be there and they don't go now now dad dad you need to get a hold of yourself these boys are just awesome they'll just fill in the blank we'll go on with this story and i watch them i've told the story two or three times in a row they're just real kind with me they just listen to it and laugh with me all at the same time you know when god sees us in this realm and the gray hairs have come from nathanael and the stupid shoulders come and you're having such a hard day how many of you ever have a hard day just a real hard day you know it's kind of a day it's almost overwhelming you have difficult day you have a hard day brother meadows is having some hard days going through things he shouldn't have to go through but the king from the other side of the river has got it all taken care he's of it all taken care of i got this in my notes so maybe we'll be there and there's people we thought wouldn't be there but god by his grace provides and all of a sudden you turn and there he stands oh what a land beyond the river oh what a place could we sing that song what a day that will be i don't know about you but i've certainly enjoyed this time i certainly enjoyed it i hope those on the internet enjoyed it so when i start talking about home you know there's something about going home people will drive thousands of miles to go home may live in a much better house have a much better job but home is home just no place like home couch may not it be as good floors may be stained and you help stain them all the yard may not be as groomed as what you might remember it was when you were a child but there's no place like home and it you just want to go it only reminds you that there is a place in god's mind that he's gonna draw you back to and you've never seen it but what a place amen [Music] [Music] i shall see when i look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace when he takes me by the hands land what a day glorious day that will be [Music] [Applause] shall come no more clouds in the sky no more tears [Music] [Music] that will be let's just sing it to him now oh what a day that will be when my jesus shall upon his face the one who takes me by his grace when he takes by the hand and leads me through the promised land holiday glorious day that will be i want you to sing with all your hearts oh what a day that will be when my society shall see when i look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace when he takes me by the hand leads me through glorious days hallelujah we as an audience have been hit real hard here in the last few days one after another it tears our hearts in many ways but what a comfort it is to know that this is not the end what a comfort it is to know that this is not over with this is only the graduating period to get us there and we have just graduated a few students of life oh we'll miss them here but now they'll pull for us there and maybe there'll be some conversations with brother john how are they doing down there oh brother homer you ought to see the church that andrew is doing some incredible preaching down there nancy's doing really good she's still a pretty woman yeah how some years ago that whole that pole platform is full of music down there and they shout they dance that's what i remember i so loved it amen amen that realm is closer than we actually think i so love you with all of our hearts and andrew is there any other announcements we need to make amen just remember if they're planning to go and they don't have seats they'll don't get mad if they turn you i've tried to give you time if you want to go to get yourselves there and but i but i love you and with all of our hearts pray for the family that god would be with them and minister to them in a special way pray for andrew as he speaks today that god will bless him and that gray-headed fellow that god will bless him amen i think caleb is going to sing a couple of songs as well so amen pray for the family that god would minister to them in a supernatural way amen brother andrew would you come and maybe sing a song of dismissal or whatever i sure do appreciate this guy i appreciate all of you i appreciate this guy

to express our love to you today and just be remembering everyone during this time oh god sent his son who they called him jesus he came to love [Music] oh hell and forgive who he bled and [Music] empty grave is there to prove that my jesus it's because he lives that i can face he leaves all fear is gone i know he holds my future and life is worth the living just [Music] because he lives god bless you you're dismissed as the brothers dismiss you row by row and then one day i'm going to cross that rib i will fight life's
