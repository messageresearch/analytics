the mighty Angel would stand up father and you would begin to declare yourself alive like never before in the the name of Jesus Christ and the bride says amen amen do you love the Lord this evening amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over again over in Joshua chapter 1 Joshua chapter 1 and verse 9 and then also down to Joshua chapter 2 we would like to thank all the the brothers and everybody that's been a part this this past week on the construction project here at the church and and I know that um I know brother Ray and Jonathan and several other brothers have been here throughout the week and uh we just want to say that we greatly appreciate every one of you that's been here been a part of that and and um things are taking shape here and we're making room and God's Building a Church and he's he's putting he's putting people right in place that love this message with all their heart and we're just thankful for what the Lord is doing and what he's going to continue to do right on to the coming of the Lord and we just want to prepare our hearts for whatever he he has in store so we just want to say Lord here here we are here we are you you you use this how you want to amen I'd like to continue to stay in the same vein of thought that we've been in on dividing The Inheritance but I'd like to speak to you tonight on entering Jericho and claiming every possession entering Jericho and claiming every possession Joshua chap 1 and verse 9 have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee withs soever thou goest then Joshua commanded the officers of of the people saying pass through the host and command the people saying prepare you victuals for within three days you shall pass over this Jordan to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it then just flip down to chapter 2 and verse one there and just one verse from chapter 2 and Joshua the son of none sent out out of shadam two men to spy secretly say saying go view the land now notice that when when Moses sent out spies in Numbers Chapter 13 he sent it out and gathered the whole congregation together notice that Joshua wasn't going to allow this to be some Uprising here but Joshua sent them out secretly saying and go view the land even Jericho and they went and came into a harlot's house named Rahab and Lodge there may God bless his word he may be seated here in the presence of the Lord Brother bandam I'd just like to just draw this this context tonight just to gather some of these things as we're preaching tonight from the pergamin church age brother brandom said he he said here is the secret of this he said the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to pass or it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will the those in the bride do only his will not their will not The Bishop's will but only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saved the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all of his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it has not yet come not yet time for him to do certain things that that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time let's say that together that he left for this specific time now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb our promised land is coming in sight even as theirs did now Joshua means Jehovah Savior and as he represents the end time leader that will come to the church age even as Paul came as the original leader Caleb represents those that stayed true with Joshua remember God had started Israel as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different so did the last day church now notice how did how God did not move Israel or let go let her go into the promised land until it was at it was his own appointed time now the people might have put pressure on Joshua the leader and said the land is ours let's go and take it it sounds like a lot of people in in Acts chapter 2 it said well we're already here we've already seen these things why don't we just go on out there but there was something that God was waiting on it was the Fulfillment of the letter becoming a reality and Joshua he said you're all they said the land's ours let's go take it Joshua you're all through you must have lost your commission you don't have the power that you used to have you used to hear from God and and know the will of God and act quickly something is wrong with you but Joshua but Joshua was a god-sent prophet and he knew the promises of God so he waited for them and he waited for a clear-cut decision from God and when the time came to move God placed the full leadership in when the time came to move God placed the full leadership in Joshua's hands because he had stayed with the word so if we want to be under the commission of our our hour we've got to stay with the Joshua commission we can't get outside of it because God placed the full leadership in the in the hands of Joshua because he stayed with the word so if we want to be in a Joshua commission we've got to stay in the word so God could trust Joshua but he could not the others so we will repeat in this end day the same problems and the same pressures and we notice the same exact things he he that Joshua is under those same problems and under the same pressures and that's where the Church of the Living God is against today that are under the same problems and they're under the same pressures and we realize as the Church of the Living God that the word Reigns Supreme it is preeminent in everything uh in a Christian's life it Reigns Supreme without the word of God we don't move without the word of God as Christians and we know that God has a very specific time that he's going to raise kingdoms up and he's going to raise Kings up to fill that portion or or men or leaders that would step into their place so God has a time that he's going to release a word because you know it was laying in the mind of God that God was going to bring forth a virgin son but it could not come until the time that Mary was in her fulfillment as as the portion of the scripture that was there so God has allotments of times that he's going to release a certain allotment of scripture or prophecy that he will allow to be fulfilled and Joshua was in his commission he was in his time when the prophecy had came for Joshua to come in and fully divide the land out but Joshua was under his full commission standing there depending upon the leadership of the pillar of fire he was laying there under his commission and he was only successful as long as he was under that commission and if men of God ever get outside of their commission and go outside of doing what the message of the hour is saying unto them you will find that they are living powerless as life but notice what Joshua was his commission was to do is to go in there divide the land and he had to fight for every single inch of ground that he was up against it was his job to take all of the children of Israel out of those winds or of the ones that had all the old Fighters had died off but those those that had raised up under Joshua and Caleb's Ministry he was going to take them over there because God had seen a people that were elected to move into a promise that he had seen them in before the foundation of the world and God had given this allotment of of of of the of the promised land over into the hands of the children of Israel and there wasn't going to be anything that would stand against them for fully moving in there God had give them the promise and God had give them the possession didn't matter whether there was Giants over there didn't matter whether if there was atheist over there didn't matter if there was infidels over there didn't matter if there was co- foral Church Believers over there it didn't matter what thing that mattered the only thing that mattered was that God had made the promise and if God made a promise it was good enough for Joshua to move right in there and leave the full inheritance and step right in there and that's the thing about God is that God has a long range Vision you know we in our finite Minds we can only see past or we can only see today or maybe we can see maybe just a week in the future or whatever but God sees all the way out a long range Vision by prophecy he looks out there and see things that we don't see you might be wondering why is God moving in this in this area right here when you wanted to be moving over there but the secret of the key of it is that there is redemption at that is at work there are certain things that God has got to fulfill before he moves over here and takes care of this situation before he goes over there and he destroys he destroys over there in Joshua 10 he's got to come here and move into Jericho because there is a key part laying right here in the midst of Jericho Hallelujah now you begin to do study out you begin to study out this this woman of Grace that Rahab has a very key part to play in the story of redemption it's very powerful study when you begin to study out this this woman it is told To Us by by tradition that she is one of the four most beautiful women in the world according to rabic tradition and she was the ancestor of eight different Old Testament prophets she had a lot to do do with prophecy she had a lot to do with Redemption and you think about this woman this woman of Grace but when you look at her in a certain spot of her life it doesn't look like She's a Lady of Grace but brother Brandon would say it like this that that more Misfortune had led her into the lifestyle and had forced her into the lifestyle that she was living being a pagan or raised up in a pagan family she was forced into this situation that she was living in and many times people people are forced into living that kind of a life that they're they're forced into living at but I want you to know this might shck the socks right off of you but I want you to know that that God will use you just to prove a point to Satan this that God will use you to prove a point to Satan that his plans that he has made threats against your life are not stronger than redemptions claims that God has put on you to think that tonight that God was going to use this little Rahab to prove a point to Satan that everything that he had thought of against this lady that it wasn't strong enough to keep her out of the lineage of Jesus Christ now Satan's got plans for your life he's got plans for your future but redemption's hold on you is stronger than Satan's plans against you I know you may not understand everything that you've been through and you may not understand everything that you're going to go through but God is going to use you to defeat Satan's plans if you can ever figure out in your life that you are Eternal part of God there is nothing going to come there is nothing go that is going to take away from your success as a predestinated seat of God because Satan's Duty Satan's duty is to destroy your life and it doesn't matter how he's going to do it but his duty is to try to dest destroy your life if he will bring in a disease or a cancer whatever it is it what what what what what science or the devil calls it is a disease or CS it cancer but what we know that it is it's a demon possession is that right so Satan comes in and he tries to influence the Church of the Living God he tries to influence them maybe by health or different things what is it what is that disease it's going in there it's doing its Duty it's trying to go in there and destroy your life what is it it's a sale that's got out of place and you watch that one cell that it'll begin to influence another cell and they'll start colliding together and they'll begin to be a growth that takes place that's exactly like the like people that get out of the will of God they simply get out of under the influence and they start colliding against one another and all of a sudden that influence of that person starts taking that person down a wrong road but that's Satan's duty is to take your life but thank God that there is a cure that is greater than the sickness there is an eternal atonement that is greater than your problems there is an eternal atonement atonement that is greater than your sin Rahab was forced into this situation another random would say it in one spot that she didn't even want to do this but she was forced there because of her father being a crippled state that she had to do something for her family and you think that sometimes that you get yourself involved with situations of life because of your family situations well I don't really know if Rahab really was a harlot you study out where she lived at the position of her house proved it proved by where she was living at it proved that her career was that of a harlot she was living on the outside wall and you go to studying out many you begin to study out theologians and different things there's a lot of people that are ashamed to say that Rahab was a harlot even Jo Josephus which is a which is a Jewish scholar and and a theologian he would even say that that that that Rahab was an inkeeper because it it uh It embarrasses some people to say that she was a harlot and maybe she was an inke keeper but we really know may because because the scripture tells us that these two spies went in there and they lodged there but no doubt we understand what Rahab was really running On The Backs side of things she was running on the backside of things and the Bible's very clear about this is that she was a harlot she was a harlot and to think that she's on the outside because she was all the way out there where men didn't want anything to do with her they didn't want anything to do with her but I find it amazing I find it amazing that Rahab had something that the rest of these so-called polished up Christians of today don't have Rahab had Faith she believed when everybody else wouldn't believe there were people that were ashamed or embarrassed to say that she's a harlot but to me it shows the power of Grace it shows that no matter what situation or what house that you're living in you can still be a part of God's economy and play out the part of Prophecy you might be wondering how in the world am I going to play out prophecy in this condition but the Bible tells us that by faith the Harlot Rahab perish not with them that believe not when she had received the spies with peace you begin to think about this that this prostitute had such a powerful testimony that she was testifying pho she was testifying to the two word preachers that had came in there and said we done heard about your God we've heard about your God about how big your God is and how great your God is we've heard about it brother mam said it like this he said now Rahab know that Joshua had this commission she knew that Rahab or Rahab knew that Joshua had this commission and Rahab recognized it before she seen anything thing she know that Joshua had the power of God and that he was going to take that land and she asked for mercy and God granted her mercy now when Joshua came into the land of course we know that she was spared now when Jesus came in there and he showed himself openly to Thomas and said look here's my hands here's my feet he said but blessed are those blessed are those that do not see but still believe Rahab had not seen one work of the miracle working power of Jesus Christ but she heard about it she heard about it look at what happened to Durham North Carolina you heard about a god you saw a God and you made a move towards God look about where you are in your spiritual condition you simply heard it by the hearing of the ear but something happened on the inside of you that drawed your attraction what was it the third pole is the Living Word it cannot be impersonated this ain't some workup let me say this to you there I'm not taking away from the first Pole or the second pole but what attracted you was not the first pole was not the second pole it you're not seeing this in a man's hand you're not seeing this by Vision but you're seeing it by the Living Word and by the Living Word you are taking this word and destroying Satan's stronghold hallelujah what was it it was something it was something there laying on the inside of Rahab that she couldn't necessarily explain what was taking place but something down on the inside something down on the inside of her was calling the Bible would say in Psalms 42 Psalms 42 and 7 it's a deep calling to the Deep it's a deep that's calling to the Deep there was something on the inside of this this woman of Grace this woman of harlotry that she had something that she couldn't explain but it was something laying there that she couldn't see it in her natural family she could look back to her Pagan father she could look back to her Pagan mother but it was nothing it was nothing there that would take her to a higher level but it was something on the inside of Rahab it was the Jean seat of God it was something that was drawing her when the rest of Jericho wasn't drawed it was something pulling her when the king of Jericho wasn't draw to it but something on the inside of Rahab made her amen the word she didn't fully see everything she didn't understand the third pole exactly she didn't understand speaking squirrels into existence but she believed she she didn't see Moses open up the Red Sea she didn't see the 10 plagues happen down there but she accepted it as thus sayith the Lord how did you get in the building how did you get where you are it was something that was drawing you you were magnetized by the gene seed of God it was something that was pulling you it's a force that you don't see it's the drawing power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ it's amazing when the Gospel of Jesus Christ begins to pull upon individuals when it looks like when it looks like Satan's got a grip on their life but all of a sudden God's gospel Goes Forth his gospel Goes Forth and begins to draw them draw them closer to his side to think that this woman was in a condition a lot worse than most of you sitting here she had a bad name she had a bad reputation she was ill- famed she was beautiful but she was manhandled but notice this that when God gets done with this woman she's going to be virgin in his sight to think where you came from you came out of denominations you came out of a prostitute system but when God gets done with you you are going to be a virgin bride you're not going to think the way of denominations you're not going to think the way of the of a carnal men but you're going to think like a virgin bride If You Can Think Like a Virgin bride you never knew what it was like to be with a man before this invisible Union you're Justified as if you never done it it was this Union brother Timothy that set you on a course been manhandled she'd been manhandled by a lot of men but when Shon was coming by her way brother Jim something different something different was coming so do God does not care about your past reputation God does not care God does not care about your scars God does not care about your complexes God does not care about your memories [Applause] are you hearing me loud and clear if I'm not talking to anybody here I'm talking to somebody on the internet God does not care about your complexes God does not care about your memories God does not care about where you've been this woman was a woman of disgrace but William Brandon would say he would say he said may I add to this lady Grace Grace an elected lady a chosen [Applause] lady you shouldn't have been in the picture but Grace but grace Amazing Grace mom said I I can see her that's powerful when a prophet's going back thousands of years he said all the time she knew that this was wrong or was it something on the inside of her all the time she knew that that was wrong he said there was something in her that told her now that's not right to do that she knew it wasn't he said but one day do you remember that day what day are you talking about I'm talking about that day at Calvary that day at Calvary you once was one way you once was one way but from that day at Calvary you are no longer thinking those kind of thoughts one day she heard that there was a god that was moving her heart be to tremble and she found a messenger from the great move that had told her what was going to take place what did she say Joshua now Joshua had signs Joshua had the same size signs that Moses had he said exactly he said but Rahab didn't ask to see Joshua sign she just heard it she just heard it it's a type of a church a type of the true church that's been pulled away by prostitution I'm a Methodist today I'm a Baptist tomorrow I'm a presbyterian the next day I'm pulled they are pulled away in the prostitution he said but all of a sudden but all of a sudden where do you hear that word over in the book of Acts that all of a sudden there came a sound from a Russian Mighty Wind all of a sudden what was it in an old test woman and in a new testament Lady of Grace that all of a sudden a little preacher enters into a city and said there's a God that lives that lived yesterday is the same today his power is just the same he does the same works that he did when he was here on Earth he said his agents are on road are on the road he said but now Rahab the Harlot known as a harlot she was a type of the believer the real believer all of a sudden all of a sudden let me say this very clearly that Satan did not understand what was about to take place here he did not understand what was about to take place here because this was rahab's first opportunity at the word and when you read the Bible I want you to read it in this way when you see two spies I want you to see the word that God was using two men the word to go into Jericho and this was when she encountered the SE two men they were not like other men but this was her first opportunity at the word and when she saw the word there was something brother Brandon would say when the word saw the word when the word saw the word when Rahab that Jean seed of God on the inside of her so the word in the message of the hour she said I got to get out of this mess that I'm in Hallelujah that's where God found you you are manhandled there were men that were doing wrong things to you but there were some preachers that came by your way there were some gospel message preachers that came by your way and when the word passed by your way you couldn't stay the same way when was Rahab different from the very time she heard it when was you different from the first time you heard it something on the inside begin to work on the outside and before long Eternal Grace wrote your story now you're not as bad as Rahab and you're not down in Jericho but you still got walls you still got walls I don't care how long you've been in the message I don't care if you've been a preacher in the message if you still got walls it's time to tear them down come on Rahab recognize who you are what was it from the very first time of the preaching of the word Satan was losing his grip on her it's amazing thing when God comes in there and strongholds or strong hands he strongholds and grabs a hold of Satan and he strong arms him that's the word I'm looking for and he strong arms Satan said you don't have enough power to keep the where they are I'm just talking about your sin I'm talking about where you are in the message Satan does not have enough power to keep you in a watered down gospel he does not have enough power to keep you in some indoctrinated idea that you can do whatever you want to and get by with it Satan's power is not strong enough to keep you out of this message Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord so what am I saying to you Hold Your Position it might be your first time at it but enjoy it because from this day forward you'll never be the same it's my first time enjoying the presence of the Lord but it won't be your last I remember the day he saved me oh from my sin and shame I came up out of that water baptized in Jesus name it might be my first time hearing the message but it won't be the last time it might be my first time hearing the preach word but it won't be my last time it means something to me it didn't mean nothing to anybody else there in Jericho but it meant something to her this message may not mean anything else to the rest of the world but it means something to me it may not mean anything to the 70 that can walk away but I'm like Peter Lord to whom would we go it may not mean nothing to them but it sure means a whole lot to me it means something to you if it means something to you you'll stick with it well something it's something that's working you can't explain it but it's something that's working it's there it's it's real it's a reality it's touching you it's it's physical you remember that little girl that little girl that came up into the prayer line came into the prayer line had to Embraces on her leg and brother brandom said that she didn't have quite enough Faith at the time so brother brandom set her back there in the corner said honey you just sit back there and you watch you watch the angel of the Lord get to working when the time is right I'll bring you back up here brother B worth and Doc got to thinking brother bam I forgot about her brother bam caught it and discerned their heart said I ain't forgot about her he said about that time he said I begin to feel a pulsation of faith on the inside of that little girl said take her take Embraces off of her and she went running out of there what was it it was a pulsation of faith and Rahab had not seen the hand of God but she knew something was different there was some power that was pulsating on the inside of her her that was calling her to a higher level what is it it was a pulsation of faith when Noah was out there and he got to preach him for 120 years but something on the inside of Noah when the rest of the world was criticizing him he stood right there on the word of God brother maram said that Noah got in a spot one time he said Lord where are you and God spoke back to him said no it doesn't matter where I am I'm still God it doesn't matter where he's at as long as he's still God I don't care what the doctor say I don't care what critics say I don't care what the doctors say or what this says that or the other as long as God's still God as long as he's still on the throne as long as he still got a promise it's time that you start marching into your inheritance Noah preach a message Noah live the message build the ark live in it they came a time when the ark got so big that Noah left his home and moved into the ark there's coming a time when the Church of the Living God gets so enveloped by the word of God that she gets in the Chariot and The Chariot takes her home it was a pulsation of faith that kept working working at Noah he kept working on him brother brand said that by that pulsation Noah be to look out there before he saw rain he started seeing clouds come on somebody I know it's difficult to get your eyes on what you see in the natural you get your eyes on your prodical you get your eyes on you get your eyes on situ ation that you prayed about and it's still the same but let the pulsation of Faith take its work let it move and brother Ram said in looking at the Unseen he said if these people here in these Wheelchairs and on these carts and you that sick to die you could ever hear the word of God tonight he said don't you try to figure it out don't think how long you going to be sitting there and don't don't think how long you've been sick and think about what God said he said there comes a pulsation of the Holy Spirit In Your Heart saying it's a truth how do you I know it's the truth the devil said I know it's the truth it's God's word it's a truth something begins to pulsate on the end of your bosom he said that is that it is the truth then make ready you give me a paper tow or something I got to do better about bringing these handkerchiefs I got so nervous before coming to church here I thought I was going to get sick forgot my handkerchief it must mean something it means something to me he said oh thank you if I get something white on my face my wiing with this paper towel y'all be sure to tell me cuz I've heard about preachers that were preaching with napkins one time and had stuff all all over their head and the rest of people couldn't get nothing out church so we don't have nothing like that going on here he said but something begins to pulsate in your bosom he said that the truth then make ready then make ready he said you're coming out of there he said just as sure as I'm standing in the Pulpit tonight so if you can make ready for it you can prepare for it and if you can prepare for it well I know this one out there in the world brother Andrew that they they once lived and they once came here and they they once heard the message and I know the world can sit out there and they can point at this one that came and this one that came and this one that's gone they can point at this one that got prayed for and they left sick they can point at this one that danced in the spirit and now they're out there drinking alcohol they can point at this one that they came here and got under the influence spoken tongues interpreted things then went right back out of the world but how about the ones that are still here how about the ones that are still sealed how about the ones that are still secure how about the ones that refuse to give up we're standing with more that's on our side than is against us so I'll be careful whose side I choose come on somebody I know that the rest of the world can point at them naysayers out there and say look what they've got and look how God's blessing them and you're living a message and you're not getting blessed but let me say this like Jesus said it that if the sun set you free you're free indeed I don't care what it looks like I'm still free I don't care how it makes me act I'm still free there's a man one time there's a man one time that that went down to a slave block went down to a slave block and and he's he's going down there and he's got a purpose he's got a purpose he's going to go down there and he's going to he's going to buy back a little slave girl he walks down there and there's this little bitty black girl that's on a slave block and she's she's being bited for and she looks out there and she sees just another white man that's bidding on her bidding on her and and she thinks well it's just going to be another white man it's going to buy me going to put me to work going to abuse me when the man takes the ticket and pays for her he walks up to her said ma'am you're free you're free she said what do you mean that I'm free said I mean you're free free she says does that mean that I can say whatever I want to he said you can say whatever you want to she said does that mean I can do whatever I want to said you can do whatever you want to does it mean I can go wherever I want to go said you can go wherever you want to go she said then I'm going to follow you this man was Abraham Lincoln so it matters who pays your ticket this was a sign that there was more that was going to be set free so it matters who pays you off it matters who buys your ticket you are not bought with corruptible things of silver and gold but you are bought with a price let me say something to you it meant something to her when she found out that that was the President Abraham Lincoln oh if you could ever find out who Jesus is it'll mean something to you it'll mean something to you it'll mean something to you it'll make you shout it'll make you cry it'll make you dance it'll make you shout it matters who pays your ticket I'm free I don't have to go back to the slave master no more I'm free I'm free now some of you don't realize it but by the name of Jesus Christ you're you're free you're free you never did it in the first [Applause] place Hallelujah somebody give the Lord a hand clap of Praise now the Bible said Matthew 20 and 16 that many are called but few are chosen many are called but few are chosen now that word that word called in the Greek it means to be invited to a banquet but you remember those that were invited to a banquet and they wouldn't show up they were invited it was it was like the gospel call or proclamation of the Gospel to them to Eternal salvation but they turn it down but you go to study out the word many are called but few are chosen it means elect it means chosen it means picked out it means chosen by God it means to obtain salvation through Christ it means that the Messiah called you and elected you and appointed by God to the most exalted office conceivable now I didn't say this I know there's a whole lot of people that sit around the ranks of the message and think that we call oursel and make oursel higher than anybody else and y'all got that idea here here if you do we need to have a talk it's one thing for you to think it but it's another thing for him to say it you can say it and it have no value to it but if he says it it means something it means something it means something because the Bible said that you're the best of its kind or class I'm going to drop a name right here sister Nancy Fraser one time there was some people that was some people around there around I a say where but they was around they was around said y'all act like y'all better than us I love you Grandma she said I am better than that I am better than that I don't have to live like a dog I'm better than that I don't have to act like a prostitute I'm better than that I don't have to live in a water down gospel I'm better than that I got Authority by the word of God to say I'm a higher class of people and I don't act like it I don't go around touting and stooting myself making me think that I'm somebody but God said that before the foundation of the world I was elect I was chosen and no man has the power to set a boundary at it that means there's no Bishop there's no priest that has the authority to say you're called or not [Applause] called I'm going to need some scripture brother Andrew praise God I got you some Ephesians 1 and3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ what does that mean Heavenly places it means the believer's position in Christ according as your mama chose you there a whole lot of people got that Mama chosen thing got that Dad my daddy made me come to the message no no no no no no according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world so it matters where you're chose at you're chose in him before the foundation of the world Rahab before you ever got in Jericho and before your family ever got in there you were chose in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him and love having predestinated us under the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so it matters who calls you it matters who elects you and the Bible said that he has made us Kings and Priests brother bam said that in the in the church age book he said you can never overemphasize that that he hath made us Kings and Priests so that God had something predestinated in the back part of God's mind that's what God that's what brother brand said in Christ the Myster of God revealed that God had something in the back part of God's mind that he had he had something there that he was going to achieve aeve that he was going to express so you are the express images of Christ so who are you really I begin to think about this who was I before I was Andrew who was I before I was Ronald and gy Spencer's son who was I who was I I was part of the original seat you begin to think of things in that realm temporal things don't seem seem to matter as much when you begin to put things in that realm who are you how did you get where you are you're original that he has made us accepted in the belove you're chosen you're a chosen generation you're a royal priesthood You're A peculiar people you're an elected so who is this who is this message for who is this who is this Rapture for it's for the elect I don't know how any other way to put it when people ask me who's a Rapture for the ticket to the Rapture is your election it's for the elected lady there's many there's many out there but there's only one mes Jesus Christ there's a lot of ladies there's a lot of women that are sitting here today but they ain't but one that's going home with me when I slipped the ring on her finger 17 years ago I laid possession on her that she was a part of me and I was a part of her I know that all of you can do some fine cooking I've ate some of it some of it I probably never eat God bless you but if you want to you want me to eat your food just buy me a ticket of Smiley's ice cream that place is Anointed half a church shows up on Sunday so it's got to be if it wasn't before it is now we done bless that place there's a lot of you that can fine do some fine cooking but they but one person that can stop me from eating Fruity Pebbles except for her but ain't one person that I'm taking home but her now a lot of y'all fine sisters you got fine hair you wear the message just right but you're not mine She's mine and I love her let me give you young brother some teaching right here I treat her like the queen that she is because she is my queen i' never one day in my life ever treated her like like a door matat every once in a while I still got to tap her on the button let her remind her that I'm still her boyfriend and if you ain't done it in a while go ahead it ain't going to hurt [Applause] you click click click click click there goes the internet don't care anyway on She's mine I got rights to do that she's mine I can kiss her when I want to I can tell her I love her when I want to I can take her on a date when I want to I can love on her when I want to but let me do that to some other woman and I'm dead meat Parry me and say good words about me but there's only one M Jesus Christ he can make love to her anytime he wants to he can fellowship with her anytime he wants to he can call her up and she'll talk to him she's got Authority in his name she's got power in his name and the great thing about M Jesus Christ she's not ashamed to make love back to him but there's too many people that try to sit around and think they got the wedding band of unmerited Grace upon their fingers and they're ashamed of to make love with Jesus they're ashamed to praise him they're ashamed to act in his name they're ashamed to prophesy they're ashamed to call on God in public view or in private view but if you're ashamed of me I will be ashamed of you before angels and before all of men there's a lot of people that look the part but only one of them is going to be virgin there's a lot of them there's a lot of them that's really close to the borderline but they never go over Jordan let me find this quote matter of fact it's right there that's perfect he said you follow that true word and you get a true experience of the word because the word is made flesh in you and you become God's son and the word of God is revolving right out of God into you what is it it's a true experience she has every bit of checkboard book authority to take my name and act in my name she's got that Authority now RAB I don't under I don't know if you understand where you are in this grand scheme of things but you've got Authority because of what you believed your experience matches the word for the hour it might look like you're living in the worst condition you might have some of the worst problems stacked up against you but let me tell you Rahab where you're living at it makes a great escape plan for Joshua RAB knew what to do with this word when the king of Jericho I don't know how long I've been I'm sorry if I'm done gone over time but when the king of Jericho heard about these two spies when he heard about the word it proved that he'd been to that house before he knew exactly where to go where where are these guys at he knew exactly where to go and you watch the Power of predestination she's been here before she's been in this condition before she's probably lied before but here's a king in her house that's got Authority said where's these two spies at and she lies to them she Li them they were here but they ain't here now she probably lied before brother Ron but this time was different because up above her hiding in the flax was the word over top of her mistakes you had been in this condition and you made mistakes before but this time the word is covering your situation I don't know any other way to put it but she was lying she was lying but God saw something on the inside of her that the Book of James would say that she was justified by her works and when she said these words to them in verse 12 she said because I showed you kindness show kindness to my house and give me a true token don't give me some of this make beliefs up don't give me some of this hoopy BL stuff don't be give me some of this stuff I can f in My Flesh and then I go out and sin and just do anything I want to anymore I want a true token I want a true baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't I don't want just something that I feel on Sunday and Saturday I want something that's real she didn't just say it for herself she wanted it for her daddy she wanted it for her mama she wanted it for her brother Rahab acted on the word of God and then and then and then she saw a miracle before you ever going to see it you got to act on it brother Mar said he slipped into her house said I could see her down there and she's Gathering all those predestinated seeds in she's Gathering them in granted now she's never seen one miracle she's just heard about how God destroyed Gog and MGA she's just heard about how that he opened up the Red Sea she's heard about these Miracles she's heard about the healing of hady Wright She's heard about she's heard about these things she's heard about Georgie Carter she's heard about Congressman Upshaw but she ain't seen one thing about it yet she ain't seen one thing but she's Gathering all these predestinated seeds in there what is she doing she's taking that word that she's heard and she's going around and she's testifying about it and she's getting every single one of them in there she's doing what anybody that's got a message will do you'll start Gathering them to you that's what the message would do it'll gather the true seed into the house and they begin to brother they begin to ask a question how do we know we're going to be okay brother ROM said she said I'm acquainted I'm acquainted with this destroying Angel she ain't never met Joshua but she'd met the message of Joshua she'd heard about it and she said I am acquainted I Am AC acquainted with this destroying Angel Joshua because that's what the Bible said in Romans 10:1 17 that Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Rahab was backing prophecy and I'm I Lord willing I'll get to it next weekend it is also said because people were in embarrassed about her but it said that she also died Linens she died Linens there in her house she didn't know it but she had that message sit in her all that time she didn't know it but she had the cloud there the whole time she didn't know it but she had the token there the whole time she had been sitting around the message her whole life the thing that was going to get her out of her situation she'd been living right there with it in her house how many people sitting there with a message in their house right now and don't even realize it but one day there's going to be the word that come by your way it's going to pass by your way you're going to hear it you're going to accept it and you're going to move forward and she didn't care she didn't care she didn't care what the rest of the world said about it I know there's a lot of people that's probably don't understand why you're driving two and a half hours to get here brother but it means something to you they may not be a whole lot of people that don't understand why in the world you brother Denny's got a lot of question why in the world you got to drive an hour and a half to go to that church all the way up there weekend after weekend it means something to him you look at these brothers sister drove here for all these years across the mountain and four four hours getting here it means something to them and Rahab did not care what the rest of the world they were making fun of her by dropping down the token on the outside they saw her and she didn't pull it up she didn't pull up the token when people started making fun of her it's just like down there in Exodus chap 12 when they was down there and they was applying the token to the door and there that blood was on the door brother R said it got the stinking so bad that them people said well look at them Holy Rollers up there said them Pentecostals out there doing things like that theyy applying the token to the door he said it didn't mean one thing to them he said but it meant something to them Israelites and it may not mean nothing else to anybody else but that same Pillar of Fire that was with with William pram is in the room and it means something to me it may not have meant anything back to anybody else to reach out there and touch Jesus but to the woman with a blood issue it meant something to her it meant something to her and Jesus didn't even feel it but he felt virtue go through him it may not have meant anything to Simon for Jesus to come in his house but it meant something for jaras it meant something to him it didn't mean nothing to anybody else when Jesus was sitting down and he wasd drawn Jesus is drawing in the sand when this woman was deserving of it and by the law it didn't mean nothing to them pharaohs it didn't even mean nothing to Pharisees and Sadducees but it meant something to this woman that was caught in the act this message may not mean anything else to you but it means something to Rahab and Rahab I want to tell you you're going to watch the word go back across a Jordan River but I want you to prepare because just in four chapters honey you getting out you are coming out of your situation you're not going to live down here in Jericho no more your past is going to be so fused together by the word of God that natural geographic draw it and said they saw layers on top of layers of Jericho's rock that had fused together that the heat of Jericho what am I saying to you that when the pillar of fire goes across your life your past is over it's over that's why William Brandon would say and I add to this lady may I place her in the Bible as misery's Grace hang on honey you coming out of that mess hang on honey let me tell you something she shut down her shop the day she saw the word she may have lived in the same house she may have would would would watched people come by her for four more chapters but she wasn't doing the same Deeds she had a sign on the door we're closed for business we got a Rapture that's coming blessed be the name of the Lord stand with us this [Applause] evening hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it may not mean nothing to you mean something to me amen KC says [Music]
