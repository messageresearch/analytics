[32:37] that God is showcasing his Supernatural
[32:40] power in this last day like never before
[32:43] and you know we're we're so privileged
[32:45] here at this church to to be able to
[32:47] have a meeting like we're having this
[32:49] weekend and to have brother Tim puit and
[32:52] brother Donnie Reagan come and take out
[32:54] of their busy schedule we're very bless
[32:57] people
[32:58] and and um just to maybe kind to put
[33:02] some things at the Forefront here just
[33:04] so that maybe you have an understanding
[33:06] when I flew back from Belgium brother
[33:08] Ron had some test the the very next day
[33:12] and uh the doctors were doing some test
[33:14] on on brother Ron's eyes and
[33:16] things so you'll understand why these
[33:19] brothers are here that they the doctors
[33:22] have found that there is cancer in
[33:24] brother Ron's eyes and uh they're
[33:27] finding that it may have transpired or
[33:30] have went may have rolled from his brain
[33:33] or somewhere else there and um so we you
[33:37] know sometimes you you need sometimes
[33:40] you look out in the battlefield and you
[33:42] you need a Robert E le and you need a
[33:43] Stonewall Jackson to come and I've
[33:46] invited two of God's greatest generals
[33:49] that I have seen in this in this message
[33:51] there's so many that we could call them
[33:54] but the Lord laid on my heart and just
[33:56] to reach reach out to brother Tim and
[33:58] then reach out to brother Donnie and
[33:59] invite them to come and to for it all to
[34:02] work out the way that it did if if you
[34:04] would understand from my standpoint to
[34:07] watch the timing of the Lord just unfold
[34:10] all of these things it would let you
[34:12] know that God is up to something amen
[34:16] because as soon as we picked up brother
[34:18] Tim puit from the from the airport on
[34:21] Thursday there brother Ron got the phone
[34:23] call and they were confirming that there
[34:26] is that there is cancer in his eyes and
[34:29] they're going to be doing some tests on
[34:30] February 14th and February the 27th we
[34:33] don't know what the prognosis or what
[34:36] they are planning to do from that
[34:38] standpoint but I know this that Isaiah
[34:40] 53 has already paid for brother Ron's
[34:44] healing
[34:45] amen amen do you believe that with all
[34:49] of your
[34:51] heart amen as these sisters just saying
[34:55] we've seen cancer disappear
[34:57] we've seen broken hearts restored but
[35:00] I'm going to ask you to do something as
[35:02] a congregation here I'm going to ask you
[35:05] that you consecrate yourself like never
[35:07] before you come here early you read your
[35:10] Bible you you set an atmosphere here I
[35:14] invite you to do that not just here but
[35:16] at your home like never before I'm going
[35:18] to ask you to consecrate your heart and
[35:20] give over so that there would be nothing
[35:22] that would stand in this in this Arena
[35:25] here tonight that would allow our
[35:28] champion to stand up here and start
[35:31] throwing rocks at this giant and we
[35:34] watch cancer disappear so as as the word
[35:37] would go forth and as brother we've
[35:39] asked brother Donnie Reagan to come and
[35:41] to speak tonight and I believe that God
[35:43] set this up he he set this up if if you
[35:47] could just understand you would you
[35:49] would see the supernatural how it has
[35:51] all worked out to just to reach out with
[35:53] them to these brothers within a week
[35:55] they're pastors they have busy schedules
[35:58] and for me me to be able to just to
[36:00] reach out to them and they said brother
[36:02] brother Andrew we we'll be glad to come
[36:04] and we greatly appreciate these brothers
[36:07] they're they're not just they're not
[36:09] just our friends but there's God's
[36:11] generals and I believe that God is in
[36:14] the details of all of these things and I
[36:17] believe that that our God we've seen
[36:19] what he has done for the past four years
[36:21] through brother Ron's Ministry when he
[36:23] spoke to him four years ago if you trust
[36:25] me I use you like never before and we've
[36:28] watched that displayed at this
[36:30] congregation all over the United States
[36:33] and in Canada for the past four years
[36:35] we've seen God use a bride Ministry in
[36:38] this hour and that wasn't just a word
[36:40] for brother Ron that was a word for the
[36:42] bride because bride if you'll trust him
[36:45] he'll use you like never before so if
[36:49] you will let us stand this evening and
[36:51] we get ready to invite our brother
[36:52] Donnie Reagan and come to speak what God
[36:54] has laid upon his heart I I want you to
[36:57] believe that all things are possible I
[37:00] know that you're Believers but I'm going
[37:02] to coach you in these things and preach
[37:04] to you the word give you instruction as
[37:06] brother Donnie preaches the word you say
[37:08] Amen to the word just like you always do
[37:12] you create an atmosphere in here where
[37:14] cancer is not welcome I believe that you
[37:16] have that ability as Sons and Daughters
[37:18] of God to rise to the challenge and to
[37:21] challenge Satan to a debate and tell him
[37:23] to leave from this place key of a sister
[37:26] Cassie

[42:51] Day you would have never convinced me my
[42:56] little baby girl would be gone in 6
[42:59] [Music]
[43:01] weeks I didn't believe it for nothing no
[43:05] way I believed
[43:07] it but sometimes God's way is so much
[43:11] different than our way brother Donnie do
[43:13] you still believe him with all over my
[43:16] heart I believe him now more than
[43:19] [Music]
[43:25] ever
[43:28] hallelujah praise the Lord not only do I
[43:32] believe you more I trust
[43:35] him some people can believe him as long
[43:37] as they can understand but the first
[43:40] thing God does that they don't
[43:43] understand then it's like they lose
[43:45] their faith so their faith is more on
[43:48] understanding and it is a revelation but
[43:51] I'm glad aren't you that when we don't
[43:54] understand what God's doing we we can
[43:56] still say I love you so
[43:59] much I love you so much praise the Lord
[44:04] but it's such an honor for us to be here
[44:07] with brother Ron you the church and I
[44:10] want to say from Carol and myself and
[44:13] from Erica's family we so appreciate all
[44:16] your prayers concerning her and her
[44:19] husband and her children and US during
[44:22] this time we thank you so much I believe
[44:25] it's been the prayers and the saints of
[44:27] God that's helped us and we're a family
[44:29] aren't we we're a family we live in
[44:31] different states we come from different
[44:33] backgrounds and all that sort of thing
[44:35] but we're a family and actually if we
[44:38] have family members in the flesh that
[44:40] don't believe this word sometimes we're
[44:43] closer than we are to our own flesh and
[44:45] blood a that right oh and how we
[44:48] appreciate him at the time of trouble I
[44:50] wonder how many like to be remembered
[44:52] tonight as we pray before we read the
[44:54] word Lord Jesus we love you so
[44:58] much we thank you for your presence that
[45:02] we sense here tonight Lord we're asking
[45:05] you father that you would just help us
[45:08] we've come together these two Services
[45:11] Lord that we could worship and sing and
[45:14] pray and praise and hear the word Lord
[45:18] you see this special Needy Time in the
[45:22] life of brother Ron and his family and
[45:25] the church church family and we're just
[45:27] looking to you tonight father we believe
[45:30] that you are a god of Miracles a god of
[45:34] the
[45:35] Supernatural and we believe that Satan
[45:37] is a liar he is defeated and he is a
[45:42] bluff and we're calling his bluff father
[45:45] would you just minister to us tonight
[45:47] Lord take your word help me to get out
[45:50] of the way Lord pray for brother Tim in
[45:53] the morning Lord that you just give him
[45:54] Direction and use him in a mighty way
[45:57] come tonight Lord Jesus and speak to us
[46:00] we pray father in Jesus name
[46:04] amen God bless you if you turn with me
[46:07] tonight in the Book of Matthew chapter
[46:11] 16 Matthew chapter
[46:14] 16 Jesus answered and said unto him
[46:19] blessed art thou Simon barjona for flesh
[46:24] and blood is not revealed yeld it unto
[46:26] thee but my Father which is in heaven we
[46:30] know this is after Peter's great
[46:34] confession Jesus goes on to say and I
[46:37] say also unto thee that thou art Peter
[46:41] and Upon This
[46:43] Rock I will build my
[46:47] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[46:52] Prevail against it you believe that with
[46:54] all your heart let's read it it again I
[46:57] say also unto
[46:59] thee that thou art Peter and Upon This
[47:03] Rock I will build my church I want you
[47:05] to notice who's doing it now it's not a
[47:08] bunch of overseers it's not a bunch of
[47:10] Bishops it's not some Pope or some
[47:12] priest it's Jesus building it you
[47:16] believe Jesus would know the right
[47:17] material to use oh
[47:20] yeah now if we sitting here tonight when
[47:23] I come in a while ago it was about 16
[47:26] degrees and the wind chill it was zero
[47:29] or below and if our building in here
[47:32] tonight was like some of the ones I've
[47:34] seen in Africa that were built out of
[47:37] sticks and mud and thatch roofs y'all
[47:41] would have done been
[47:43] gone but you know what when brother
[47:45] Frasier and the brothers built this
[47:47] church years and years ago they chose
[47:50] the appropriate building material for
[47:53] the climate that you live in
[47:56] amen now next week this weather's going
[47:58] to be gone and somebody said praise the
[48:01] Lord but I'm glad you all use the right
[48:05] material now notice Jesus said Upon This
[48:08] Rock I will build my church and the
[48:12] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[48:14] it may the Lord bless his words you may
[48:16] be seated I want to speak to you tonight
[48:18] on time tested memorials amen that's
[48:23] right time tested memorials
[48:27] a memorial can be a a great thing let me
[48:30] just read you a couple of things here
[48:32] from the message and the prophet said a
[48:34] memorial is a great thing we appreciate
[48:37] memorials and many times men in this
[48:39] life have tried to leave behind some
[48:43] sort of a memorial nearly all men love
[48:48] to do that so they put it up at their
[48:50] graveyard a great marker and I
[48:53] appreciate that he said that's okay and
[48:55] then many will try to build Great Signs
[48:59] so he said there is Memorials and then
[49:02] there's great
[49:04] memorials no doubt some of you no matter
[49:07] which direction you came to church
[49:09] tonight you would have driven on a road
[49:12] or you came over an overpass or a bridge
[49:16] and it was dedicated to a mayor or a
[49:20] state trooper or some judge or maybe
[49:23] some founding father that came through
[49:25] here years and years ago and you drove
[49:27] to church tonight on some Highway that
[49:30] was named after Andrew Jackson you
[49:32] definitely know you're in Virginia and
[49:34] not in New Hampshire when you're doing
[49:36] that so far they haven't been able to
[49:39] take that away from you have they but
[49:41] you know and you'd say well that's so
[49:43] and so Memorial Highway now you didn't
[49:46] live in Andrew Jackson's day of course
[49:49] you wasn't around whenever him and Lee
[49:50] and all them was here but whenever you
[49:52] will see that sign it's doing exactly
[49:56] what they named it for it's to remind
[49:59] you of that person and the same way with
[50:02] the bridge same way with the building
[50:04] same way with something else well you
[50:06] know God himself was going to build a
[50:10] memorial now it was going to be
[50:12] something that would last for thousands
[50:15] and thousands of years not only in time
[50:19] but this Memorial will merge into
[50:23] eternity so what kind of material would
[50:26] he have to have to build it no doubt
[50:29] this building would stand here for
[50:31] decades the type of material that was
[50:34] used the craftsmanship that was used to
[50:36] put it together the foundations the
[50:39] concrete you went deep enough in the
[50:41] frostline for the cold temperatures and
[50:43] you knew kind of where you were had
[50:46] requirements building permits and all of
[50:48] that and you wanted to build it so that
[50:51] it wouldn't crack and crumble in four or
[50:53] five years what's the use of BU build it
[50:56] if you're going to do that so if we
[50:58] would do that as Mortals how much more
[51:01] would god build his memorial which he's
[51:04] going to call a church now remember
[51:08] Jesus is the first one in the New
[51:10] Testament to use this word this is the
[51:13] first time that Satan heard it spoken so
[51:18] he probably was curious what is a church
[51:23] now to us most of our Liv life we've
[51:26] heard it we passed many coming to this
[51:29] building tonight with all kinds of names
[51:31] did you so for us it's a very common
[51:35] term but think if you'd been living in
[51:37] that day and this is the first time
[51:40] you'd ever heard it in your life you not
[51:42] even sure what it even means but he said
[51:45] I am going to build my church so if he's
[51:49] going to build something then he's not
[51:51] going to build it on a material or out
[51:54] of a material that it's going to last a
[51:56] few days and fall because his
[52:00] reputation is at stake now there are
[52:04] good memorials and there are bad
[52:07] memorials there are things that are
[52:10] built uh many years ago we was
[52:13] privileged to stand in the memorial to
[52:15] the Holocaust brother Tim was there with
[52:18] us at the same time that we were there
[52:21] and as we went through that and you see
[52:24] all those horrific pictures and all
[52:27] those names of those millions of people
[52:29] that were slaughtered and it's it's a
[52:32] memorial but it's not a memorial of
[52:36] happiness it is a memorial that stands
[52:39] there as a witness that they say never
[52:44] again never again so memorials can
[52:48] represent different things I'd like to
[52:51] call your attention to another Memorial
[52:54] in the Old Testament and it was a woman
[52:57] we don't know what her name was but the
[52:59] Lord Jesus referred to her in the Book
[53:02] of Luke chapter 17 and he said remember
[53:07] Lot's
[53:08] wife and you know the story that God
[53:11] because of her unbelief and brother
[53:14] Brenham used her as an example of a
[53:17] memorial and he said I think of another
[53:20] Memorial one day when a woman made the
[53:23] wrong choice she decided to stay instead
[53:28] of being with Abraham in the
[53:30] well-watered plains of Sodom and
[53:32] Gomorrah and be sociable she didn't take
[53:36] the good choice that Sarah chose and you
[53:39] remember the story and he said she was
[53:43] obedient and lovely to her husband in so
[53:46] much that she called him her Lord but
[53:50] Lot's wife of course chose to become the
[53:54] mayor's wife down there and live a
[53:56] sociable life and we remember the end of
[54:00] the story that God turned her to a
[54:03] pillar of Sal now we've been there in
[54:06] that dead hebra the Tim remembers it and
[54:08] that and there's a big rock there which
[54:11] they say is Lot's wife who knows exactly
[54:14] if it is or not it wasn't necessary
[54:16] really that I saw which one that it was
[54:18] because every time I read about this I
[54:22] remember her and I find it amazing that
[54:25] the Lord Jesus never said remember Sarah
[54:28] did you ever notice that and read in the
[54:30] Bible the Lord Jesus never said remember
[54:34] Rebecca remember Rachel remember Leah
[54:38] remember the great women of the Bible
[54:41] and if you read this categorically the
[54:43] way it's written here in Luke 17 that
[54:47] Jesus reminds us of this and it's during
[54:50] the same time frame of the scriptures
[54:52] when he says the son of man was would
[54:55] come again on the earth in the last day
[54:58] so then when he relates about the coming
[55:00] of the son of man then he also reminds
[55:04] us to remember Lot's wife which lets us
[55:07] know there will be people that will
[55:10] actually set under that Ministry of the
[55:13] son of man for a while and they will
[55:16] turn and go straight to
[55:19] Sodom and Jesus said when you do that
[55:22] remember Lot's wife
[55:26] so I remember Lot's wife too but I also
[55:30] remember that ain't me praise the Lord I
[55:34] remember that as a memorial that's not
[55:38] us right sisters that's not you so you
[55:42] see a remor a memorial can be for
[55:45] something uh that is even though it
[55:48] might have been an negative light but
[55:50] you get something good out of that we
[55:53] know the Bible contains many things in
[55:55] that way that are written for our good
[55:57] so the prophet says that Lot's wife
[55:59] wanted luxuries she couldn't stand the
[56:02] thought of giving it up so she went with
[56:05] her husband down to the city and he said
[56:08] as she went out that day of course when
[56:10] the Angels Came and she kept looking
[56:13] back and weeping and grieving because
[56:17] she had to give that up now the prophet
[56:19] goes on to tell us that she actually
[56:22] heard her grandchildren
[56:26] screaming and
[56:29] crying as the fire fell out of Heaven
[56:33] you see around these cities of Sodom and
[56:35] Gomorrah and the other five cities that
[56:37] was there they had slime
[56:40] pits now it was not mud slime but it was
[56:43] actually bitumin which is what we know
[56:47] as
[56:48] asphalt what our roads are made out of
[56:51] so this was one thing that made Sodom
[56:54] and gomorra Rich Rich was salt and
[56:57] batumin so when the fire started falling
[57:00] from Heaven there was one explosion
[57:03] after another and those pits of tar
[57:08] pitch begin to catch on
[57:11] fire as a matter of fact
[57:13] archaeologically they just found some of
[57:15] those not long ago and they begin to dig
[57:18] around there and dig them up where they
[57:20] had caught on fire and they said it
[57:23] would the temperatures would have been
[57:24] 1,500 to 2,000 de in order to transform
[57:29] those rocks well you know that Memorial
[57:32] don't mean none of us shout does it that
[57:35] Memorial don't make none of us feel very
[57:37] happy at all it kind of makes us feel
[57:39] sad doesn't it but you see God used that
[57:42] as a memorial so that we would always
[57:46] keep that before us so we never never
[57:49] want to go that way am so but when God
[57:53] then used this woman and turned her up
[57:57] into that type of an image you know it's
[57:59] I find it amazing because it was during
[58:01] that time that she was getting a body
[58:05] change Hallelujah it was during the sign
[58:08] of the son of man she was getting a body
[58:10] change but it wasn't a good one was it
[58:13] do you think that this is just happening
[58:16] to be this way that we're in the time
[58:18] when science and medical science and
[58:20] surgeries and hospitals and so on are
[58:22] changing men from men to to women and
[58:25] women to
[58:27] men you see there's more than just us
[58:30] getting a body change but they also are
[58:33] getting one but remember it's a sign of
[58:35] judgment on the
[58:37] earth is that right so it's it's a
[58:41] memorial but alas it's not one that I
[58:44] want to use as my example so what I look
[58:48] and see when I think about her is that
[58:51] she is a memorial of disgrace
[58:55] dishonor is that right because of that
[58:59] notice Jesus said even thus shall it be
[59:01] in the day when the son of man is
[59:03] revealed in that day he that is on the
[59:05] housetop and his stuff in the house let
[59:07] him not come down to take it he that is
[59:10] in the field let him not return likewise
[59:13] remember Lot's
[59:16] wife so then Jesus gives us an example
[59:21] or a memorial now let's chain from that
[59:25] I don't want to dwell on her long
[59:27] whenever the children of Israel come out
[59:29] of the land of Egypt and exodus
[59:33] 12:14 Moses is led by God and he tells
[59:36] him and says this day shall be unto you
[59:40] for a memorial so things can be a
[59:44] memorial days can be a memorial how many
[59:47] remembers the day the Lord got a hold to
[59:49] you you see that's a memorial that's a
[59:52] memorial maybe the day you got the holy
[59:54] ghost maybe the day you heard the
[59:56] message the day you you come to this
[59:58] church or whatever it was but it was a
[1:00:01] memorial memorials can be good now
[1:00:04] remember God himself is going to build a
[1:00:07] memorial let me lay this foundation and
[1:00:10] then we'll get to that so God said
[1:00:12] through Moses this day shall be unto you
[1:00:14] for a memorial and you shall keep it a
[1:00:17] feast to the Lord throughout your
[1:00:19] Generations you shall keep it as a feast
[1:00:22] by an ordinance forever and then notice
[1:00:26] also in the book of Exodus chapter 28
[1:00:30] Thou shalt put two stones upon the
[1:00:32] shoulders of the ephod now this is going
[1:00:35] to go on the priest and for stones of
[1:00:38] Memorial unto the children of Israel so
[1:00:42] then the high priest is going to Bear
[1:00:44] the names of the tribes of the children
[1:00:46] of Israel into the presence of God so
[1:00:49] the birthstones is going to be on his
[1:00:51] chest and whenever the the urum thumb
[1:00:54] whenever the they were seeking an answer
[1:00:55] from God the supernatural lights would
[1:00:58] shine upon those different colored
[1:00:59] stones and they would begin to list
[1:01:02] glisten and lighten up and produce the
[1:01:04] rainbow colors so it was a memorial when
[1:01:09] Joshua and Israel cross over Jordan
[1:01:12] Joshua 4:6 let this be a sign among you
[1:01:16] that when your children ask their
[1:01:18] fathers in time to come saying what mean
[1:01:21] ye by these Stones so God said now when
[1:01:25] you step out of that River I want each
[1:01:28] of you I want you certain appointed men
[1:01:30] I want you to take a stone out of that
[1:01:32] River and I want you to lay this Stone
[1:01:34] over here and I want you to pack it
[1:01:36] around with you and then when your kids
[1:01:39] say now what does this mean what what's
[1:01:42] this Stone about I want you to be able
[1:01:44] to tell them this is a sign of our
[1:01:47] victory that God brought us out now you
[1:01:50] understand really in the a sense it's
[1:01:52] the same way of Victories that God has
[1:01:53] done in our Our Lives when our children
[1:01:55] will say mama why do we why do we wear
[1:01:58] long hair mama why why do us women wear
[1:02:01] dresses and why do we dress God in and
[1:02:03] why don't our men go around in dresses
[1:02:05] cuz they're not sissies why don't our
[1:02:07] men go around you know with earrings and
[1:02:10] this now and other well it's a memorial
[1:02:12] now the thing of it is some of you may
[1:02:14] used to look like that you used to but
[1:02:16] you don't look that way no more so your
[1:02:19] look is a memory or a memorial of the
[1:02:23] Deliverance of what God did for
[1:02:26] you I'm sure we don't do not understand
[1:02:29] it but yet friends I was reading this
[1:02:30] week where that Peter was talking about
[1:02:33] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Peter
[1:02:36] said that it was so great that the
[1:02:39] angels of God desire to look into it and
[1:02:43] I looked at that word in the Greek and
[1:02:45] it means to stoop down and look at
[1:02:49] something
[1:02:51] intently and I S the thing that I have
[1:02:54] in my soul the thing that you have in
[1:02:57] your soul is so great that the angels of
[1:03:01] God stoop down to look into it and the
[1:03:04] Bible said that they are ministers to
[1:03:06] the Hors of salvation but they don't
[1:03:09] understand Redemption by experience the
[1:03:12] way we do they saw their the angels that
[1:03:16] used to be with them in heaven and when
[1:03:18] they fell they saw them Angels there is
[1:03:21] no Redemption for angels and when those
[1:03:24] Angels fa those remaining Angels saw it
[1:03:27] and yet they see God redeem us they see
[1:03:30] God save us and sanctify us and fill us
[1:03:34] with the Holy Ghost and even forgive us
[1:03:36] after we become his children and it is
[1:03:39] so great that they stoop down to look at
[1:03:42] it and try to understand I hope you
[1:03:44] understand that God is using the church
[1:03:48] as a university for Angels God is using
[1:03:53] the church as a schooling as a tutor to
[1:03:57] Angelic beings and do you think that
[1:04:00] it's going to stop once we leave this
[1:04:02] life this Memorial will endure forever
[1:04:06] and forever and
[1:04:08] forever it will last for eternity it
[1:04:12] must be built out of absolute wonderful
[1:04:16] awesome
[1:04:22] material so wonder what he he's going to
[1:04:27] use so it's got to be Tim
[1:04:30] tested
[1:04:33] material what could God ever use how
[1:04:37] could God use our
[1:04:39] Humanity I saw some years ago as I was
[1:04:42] in
[1:04:43] Rome a great structure there which was
[1:04:46] built and called The Arch of
[1:04:50] Titus now it was built some years years
[1:04:54] after his great Conquest that he went
[1:04:57] into Jerusalem and conquered Jerusalem
[1:05:00] and there you see it as it's carved in
[1:05:02] the great stone and you see them Roman
[1:05:07] soldiers as they have the manora the
[1:05:10] seven Branch
[1:05:11] Candlestick you see different pieces of
[1:05:14] furniture carved in that
[1:05:17] stone brother Ron as I looked at it I I
[1:05:19] couldn't keep from my mind going back to
[1:05:22] that day and how awful it must have been
[1:05:26] yet depends on which side that you were
[1:05:29] on you would look at that Memorial as a
[1:05:32] sign of conquest and victory but if you
[1:05:36] were a Jew you looked at that with
[1:05:40] sadness in your heart you looked at that
[1:05:42] as an end of an era you looked at that
[1:05:46] as a dispensational change they would
[1:05:49] never be the same again and still have
[1:05:51] not been the
[1:05:53] same so a memorial it really depends on
[1:05:57] how you look at it so you see that's why
[1:06:00] that we are so misunderstood believing
[1:06:02] that God has sent a prophet back to the
[1:06:04] Earth to restore the original building
[1:06:08] material and that's what the great
[1:06:10] debate really is about anyway because
[1:06:12] people say well all you got to do is
[1:06:13] just come to church put your name on a
[1:06:15] book why you don't have to do none of
[1:06:17] that other stuff what difference does it
[1:06:18] make you know about your hair and your
[1:06:20] dress why some old Barnes need a new
[1:06:22] coat of paint I three barns do but
[1:06:25] women's faces
[1:06:27] don't paint your barn just don't paint
[1:06:30] your
[1:06:31] [Applause]
[1:06:32] face but to me what I see of that Arch
[1:06:36] when I saw it I saw it as a memorial to
[1:06:40] the prophecy that our lord Jesus gave
[1:06:43] about the city that's right now some
[1:06:45] people could look at us as the bride and
[1:06:48] they say well them is some of the
[1:06:49] weirdest people I ever seen but it's
[1:06:51] strange that when they get in trouble
[1:06:53] they ask us to to pray for
[1:06:55] them I think that's more weird than than
[1:06:58] we are so really deep down inside of
[1:07:01] their heart they know there's something
[1:07:03] about you if they didn't when they get
[1:07:06] in trouble they wouldn't ask you to pray
[1:07:08] come on now you know it's the truth and
[1:07:11] that within itself will condemn him at
[1:07:12] that day but it really depends on how
[1:07:15] that we would look at the memorial now
[1:07:18] there's several that we could look at
[1:07:20] but to save time let's look at God a
[1:07:24] great Builder so before he was God he
[1:07:27] was the Eternal and the prophet said to
[1:07:30] my opinion the first thing that he made
[1:07:32] was Angels then he became God because
[1:07:35] God is the object of worship so there
[1:07:37] was something to worship him so they
[1:07:39] were created them and they come out of
[1:07:42] his being those which were of Eternal
[1:07:44] Essence because we know there are some
[1:07:46] angels that did not fall and yet there
[1:07:49] were some that were put on a basis as
[1:07:51] Adam was in the Garden of Eden to where
[1:07:53] they they could fall now I love the way
[1:07:56] the prophet says this God is a great
[1:07:57] architect he's a great Builder and God
[1:08:01] puts in his building nothing but the
[1:08:04] very best so Jesus said on this rock I
[1:08:08] will build my church and the Gates of
[1:08:10] Hell will not prevailed against him
[1:08:11] which shows us the gates of hell would
[1:08:13] be against him so what material is God
[1:08:17] going to use is it just flesh is it just
[1:08:21] flesh it can't be that it has to be more
[1:08:24] than that because no man just in his
[1:08:26] flesh would be able to serve God in a
[1:08:29] way of completion it's it's to every one
[1:08:32] of us are full of faults and failures
[1:08:35] right I'm talking about our humanity and
[1:08:37] it still yet needs to be redeemed but
[1:08:40] notice he said God building the
[1:08:42] foundation he would put nothing else but
[1:08:45] the best there is because God is
[1:08:49] thoughtful of his
[1:08:52] reputation
[1:08:54] now let me just say to you tonight if
[1:08:56] God does not produce a
[1:09:00] bride it's not my reputation it's not
[1:09:03] brother Tim brother Ron any other
[1:09:05] preacher that's at stake it's God's
[1:09:11] reputation but I ain't worried about it
[1:09:13] are you anybody here worried tonight
[1:09:16] that God ain't going to produce the
[1:09:17] church no he's done done
[1:09:19] it now notice the prophet said God is
[1:09:22] thoughtful of his reputation he's the
[1:09:25] god of Eternity god of the heavens and
[1:09:27] the Earth he will never put nothing in
[1:09:29] his architect plans here but what will
[1:09:33] stand the time test for
[1:09:37] eternity so it fell out of Eternity into
[1:09:41] a little block of time and then it'll
[1:09:44] pull right back up into eternity again
[1:09:47] so we're here expressing something now
[1:09:49] we in we were there in his thoughts but
[1:09:51] we were not in existence in a body form
[1:09:55] just in his thinking and he could have
[1:09:58] spoke us into existence if it so desired
[1:10:00] to do so and we would have bypassed all
[1:10:03] of this and then he could have told us
[1:10:05] now children I could have been a savior
[1:10:08] I could have been a redeemer I could
[1:10:10] have been a Healer but of course none of
[1:10:12] you all could ever get sick because I
[1:10:14] spoke you into existence and I gave you
[1:10:17] a word for embodied that could never
[1:10:20] have pain or never be weary or anything
[1:10:22] like that he could have said now I could
[1:10:25] have become all of that but but I didn't
[1:10:27] I just spoke you into existence but
[1:10:29] instead he came this way so whenever
[1:10:33] it's all said and done it won't be him
[1:10:37] telling us that he was the Savior
[1:10:40] instead it'll be us telling him I was
[1:10:45] lost and you saved me I was undone and
[1:10:49] you redeemed me Papa God you you heal me
[1:10:52] Papa God you you understand so even on
[1:10:56] this negative side of this timeline of
[1:10:59] contrast between light and darkness it
[1:11:01] is working it to his good so whenever
[1:11:04] you and I go through things and we just
[1:11:06] can't make sense of it and we try to
[1:11:09] understand it and figure it out just
[1:11:11] remember that he still has everything in
[1:11:14] his control and never remind you tonight
[1:11:17] Satan never brought you on this Earth
[1:11:20] and Satan ain't going to take you out I
[1:11:22] don't care what the the devil says he
[1:11:24] can huff and puff and threaten to blow
[1:11:27] your house down but he ain't going to do
[1:11:29] it because almighty God brought you here
[1:11:32] and almighty God will see you out of
[1:11:35] here at his time his place his will it
[1:11:39] is not left up to the devil the devil is
[1:11:44] a liar and a
[1:11:48] bluff
[1:11:51] hallelujah oh my
[1:11:54] amen so here God wants to build this
[1:12:00] building now maybe brother Frasier and
[1:12:03] some of you Brothers maybe there's still
[1:12:04] some of the ones that was share to help
[1:12:06] build this maybe you wanted a good deal
[1:12:09] on material you know we all look for
[1:12:12] that and we want to get as good a deal
[1:12:14] as we can get but we wouldn't want
[1:12:17] something that was termite
[1:12:19] infested something that was rotten
[1:12:22] something that you know you might get a
[1:12:24] good deal but is it really suitable for
[1:12:27] what you want it for you know I'm with
[1:12:29] at the age to where that that's what
[1:12:31] people are pretty much thinking that
[1:12:33] Jesus is down so low as far as getting
[1:12:36] material for his church he's just about
[1:12:38] got to let everybody in I mean
[1:12:40] everybody's got to get in because he's
[1:12:42] in such a hard spot God ain't never been
[1:12:44] in no hard spot and he ain't in no hard
[1:12:46] spot
[1:12:47] tonight as a matter of fact the church
[1:12:49] has never been as good as it is right
[1:12:51] now because we are closer to the
[1:12:54] resurrection than any other generation
[1:12:56] we are closer to the body change than
[1:12:59] any other generation we are at the end
[1:13:02] my brother sister there won't be another
[1:13:06] generation we are it Hallelujah that's
[1:13:10] why Satan is fighting with everything
[1:13:13] that he can do but I want to tell him
[1:13:16] tonight devil you're going to lose this
[1:13:18] war you're going to lose this war
[1:13:21] because Jesus has a church and his
[1:13:25] church will
[1:13:27] prevail
[1:13:31] hallelujah
[1:13:35] hallelujah thank you
[1:13:42] Lord I'm reminded of the
[1:13:46] man in
[1:13:49] Australia they was looking for someone
[1:13:51] to build a bridge some of y'all probably
[1:13:54] been there seen pictures of it at
[1:13:56] least and there was
[1:13:58] many that talked about it and they could
[1:14:01] do this and do that but they finally
[1:14:04] chose one
[1:14:06] man and the prophet when he preaches
[1:14:08] about this he takes this man and uses
[1:14:11] him as an
[1:14:12] example I've been on that
[1:14:15] bridge it's it's quite quite amazing
[1:14:18] Quite a
[1:14:19] feat and brother random lyans that guy
[1:14:24] in the types like
[1:14:26] God and he says that man tested every
[1:14:31] bolt every piece of Steel amen that
[1:14:36] bridge has such an expanse to it that by
[1:14:39] the time they get it painted from one
[1:14:41] end to the other it's time to turn
[1:14:43] around and go
[1:14:46] back it's that big and there's so much
[1:14:48] Ste I mean it's just it's quite
[1:14:50] incredible to be able to look at it and
[1:14:53] people said it'll never stand it'll
[1:14:55] never stand we've always had the them
[1:14:58] critics the church has got the critics
[1:15:01] that's what they've said about all them
[1:15:02] bunch of brownit while they'll they'll
[1:15:04] blow over it has all over the
[1:15:08] world oh
[1:15:11] Hallelujah my there's been all kinds of
[1:15:14] Cults and clicks and clans that's come
[1:15:16] around and they said oh boy we're going
[1:15:18] to do this and we're going to do that
[1:15:19] and the bride's moving right on more in
[1:15:22] love with the Lord Jesus and ever before
[1:15:25] and we're not down for the count we're
[1:15:27] we're ready for the countdown we're not
[1:15:30] down we're going for the countdown to
[1:15:33] leave this
[1:15:34] world Hallelujah the devil's tried to
[1:15:37] burn it he tried to drown it he's tried
[1:15:39] to do everything in the world and here
[1:15:41] she stands tonight around the world as a
[1:15:44] memorial of Divine Healing a memorial of
[1:15:48] Miracles a memorial of the supernatural
[1:15:51] power of God a memorial Memorial of
[1:15:53] changed lives a memorial Hallelujah that
[1:15:57] said he is the same yesterday today and
[1:16:03] forever he is not dead He's
[1:16:15] Alive the prophet says time tested I
[1:16:19] believe every word of God is pure and
[1:16:22] not adulterated for God is putting his
[1:16:26] timber because he's positive that his
[1:16:30] reputation as Savior will not be
[1:16:37] spoiled God has a
[1:16:41] reputation I don't care what you're
[1:16:43] facing tonight I don't care how big it
[1:16:45] is how bad it is if you'll lean on the
[1:16:47] Everlasting Arms of Jesus his reputation
[1:16:50] will not be ruined
[1:16:54] Glory Jesus Christ God's son who's the
[1:16:57] architect of the church came to this
[1:17:01] earth and laid down the foundation when
[1:17:04] he met the devil he was tested by the
[1:17:07] word of God and said it is written man
[1:17:09] shall not live by bread alone but every
[1:17:11] word when he took him to the Pinacle of
[1:17:13] the temple see the material he was
[1:17:17] putting into his
[1:17:19] church wow the material he was putting
[1:17:22] into his church I thought he's talking
[1:17:23] about himself exactly right he took him
[1:17:27] to the mountain he's laying the
[1:17:31] foundation the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:17:34] bought a church by the Holy Spirit
[1:17:36] that's tested every
[1:17:39] boat you may not be a big main frame a
[1:17:42] big gerder of Steel 50 foot long and 12
[1:17:45] foot high and whatever more you may not
[1:17:47] be no more than a bat but if God placed
[1:17:51] you in this church if God place you in
[1:17:53] his body as a little tiny boat you're
[1:17:56] what's hold them big pieces together
[1:17:59] you're what puts it together I'm not
[1:18:01] important yes you are every young man
[1:18:04] every young lady every one of you you

[1:19:13] myself he's coming for the Living

[1:19:34] place for you and if I go I will come
[1:19:37] again and receive you unto myself that
[1:19:40] where I am there you may be
[1:19:42] also his memorial think of it it's not
[1:19:47] like or Roberts
[1:19:48] University oh it's not like eisen's
[1:19:51] building this and Donald Trump's great
[1:19:53] building in New York and this building
[1:19:58] here but sometimes the members of Jesus
[1:20:03] body will be the most tried people on
[1:20:06] the
[1:20:09] Earth this is only one of the many
[1:20:11] things that divides us from the
[1:20:15] church the church could not live six
[1:20:19] months in your shoes come on
[1:20:24] the denominational preachers God help
[1:20:27] them God requires them what they see
[1:20:30] okay that'll be saved many of them that
[1:20:32] believe him that that's up to
[1:20:34] God but to take them out of their
[1:20:37] organization and take them out of their
[1:20:39] system and let them try to walk a
[1:20:41] month's time in a man of God's shoes and
[1:20:45] the anointed word of this hour they say
[1:20:47] how in the world can you do
[1:20:51] it I'm sure you've notice in reading the
[1:20:53] four gospels that when the Lord Jesus
[1:20:55] was here all the guns of hell was after
[1:20:57] him isn't it amazing the disciples
[1:20:59] didn't hard to go through Nothing But as
[1:21:01] soon as Jesus went up and the glory
[1:21:03] changed from him to them oh my goodness
[1:21:06] it didn't take 6 months 6 years 12 years
[1:21:09] immediately all the guns of Hell aimed
[1:21:11] after them when you get saved and you
[1:21:15] get the Holy Ghost and you find a good
[1:21:17] message church that preaches the Full
[1:21:19] Gospel and you say boy I've got her made
[1:21:21] now what you've got is a big Target on
[1:21:23] your back and all hell is aimed at you
[1:21:26] you see what in the world I'm having
[1:21:28] more trouble than I've ever had my whole
[1:21:30] life you ought to be shouting your shoe
[1:21:32] heels off that's a good sign that's a
[1:21:35] good sign the devil don't want you where
[1:21:37] you are the devil Don't Want You full of
[1:21:40] the Holy Ghost he don't want you sitting
[1:21:42] under a Ministry of the word so he'll
[1:21:45] try to make you sick he'll try to
[1:21:47] discourage you but say devil out of my
[1:21:50] way out of my way hallah Hallelujah I'm
[1:21:53] part of the building of God you can't
[1:21:56] tear us
[1:21:57] [Applause]
[1:22:02] down
[1:22:04] [Applause]
[1:22:14] Hallelujah so
[1:22:17] God puts in a
[1:22:19] bolt then a washer slide it through the
[1:22:23] girders lock washer on the other end a
[1:22:27] nut on the other end gets his ranches
[1:22:30] and
[1:22:39] start seals him in the
[1:22:45] body oh
[1:22:48] Hallelujah and then he'll let the
[1:22:50] trouble
[1:22:51] come
[1:22:53] you see it's tried as a bolt before it
[1:22:55] goes in it's tried as a washer before it
[1:22:58] goes in but then after it's United it's
[1:23:01] tried as a
[1:23:05] unit churches go through those
[1:23:08] Cycles you go through them cycles of
[1:23:10] Revival you go through them Cycles seem
[1:23:12] like everything is going good and then
[1:23:14] it seem like everything in the world
[1:23:16] starts happening and then people begin
[1:23:18] to question am I the will of God oh no I
[1:23:20] moved here I moved there am I the will
[1:23:22] of God that's exactly the same thing
[1:23:24] that happened to Abraham you imagine
[1:23:26] Abraham going down there in the land of
[1:23:28] promise the land flowing with milk and
[1:23:29] honey and when he gets down there what
[1:23:31] happens
[1:23:32] famine what in the land of milk and
[1:23:35] honey a man with all all kinds of
[1:23:38] promises of God and he ain't even got
[1:23:40] enough food to feed his own children he
[1:23:42] ain't got enough grass to feed his own
[1:23:43] cattle and what did Abraham do he
[1:23:46] backslid out of the promised land and
[1:23:48] went down to the land of Egypt and he
[1:23:49] got in trouble but remember his name was
[1:23:52] was on the book of life amen God had to
[1:23:55] whoop him all the way back but God got
[1:23:57] him why because he let me just tell you
[1:23:59] tonight if you're running from God and
[1:24:01] your name is on the book you might as
[1:24:03] well go ahead and give up because God
[1:24:05] ain't going to stop until he gets you
[1:24:08] back to where you belong you can't run
[1:24:11] far enough you can't hide deep enough to
[1:24:14] run from our God he will get
[1:24:21] you
[1:24:24] oh
[1:24:26] my a lot of times people say oh I'm so
[1:24:30] tempted notice brother Ram's response to
[1:24:32] that blessed be the name of the Lord for
[1:24:36] Temptations when I am weak then I am
[1:24:39] strong Paul said every son that comes to
[1:24:41] God must first be tried and tested and
[1:24:44] these testings are more sweeter to you
[1:24:47] and dearer to you than precious gold
[1:24:51] that's right
[1:24:55] amen time
[1:24:57] tested Memorial anybody in your beside
[1:25:01] me ever pray and you feel like your
[1:25:03] prayers don't go no higher than your
[1:25:08] head you ever been to a spot that you
[1:25:11] was so anxious to hear from God a rebuke
[1:25:15] would have been a welcome
[1:25:18] message just a rebuke just just just at
[1:25:22] least let me know you're
[1:25:25] here I've heard people say well God
[1:25:27] loves you so much your picture is on the
[1:25:29] refrigerator sometimes I feel like he
[1:25:30] kicked me in the refrigerator both out
[1:25:31] in the
[1:25:33] yard but that ain't
[1:25:35] true your feelings will lie to
[1:25:39] you what's he doing he's testing me
[1:25:42] what's he doing to you testing you and
[1:25:45] trying you all but I pray and it don't
[1:25:47] feel like it does no difference but what
[1:25:48] does a real son or daughter of God do
[1:25:50] keep right on praying
[1:25:52] keep a r on praying oh but I go to
[1:25:55] church and they don't feel nothing well
[1:25:57] I ain't going back in the morning no
[1:25:58] you're going back in the morning and
[1:26:00] you're going to pray you're going to
[1:26:01] read your Bible you're going to keep on
[1:26:03] Clapping Your Hands you're going to keep
[1:26:05] on singing come on somebody why because
[1:26:08] you're going to be a time tested
[1:26:10] memorial for God and the devil says you
[1:26:14] can't and you say I can and the devil
[1:26:16] said I'm going to get you and you're
[1:26:17] going to say no you can't because
[1:26:19] greater is he that is in me than he that
[1:26:22] is in the
[1:26:25] world
[1:26:33] Hallelujah notice job in job 238 behold
[1:26:37] I go
[1:26:39] forward but he's not there and
[1:26:43] backward but I cannot perceive him on
[1:26:46] the left hand where he does work and I
[1:26:49] cannot Behold Him He says I I know he's
[1:26:51] S I know always there I can seees
[1:26:53] attributes but I can't see him he hideth
[1:26:57] himself on the right hand that I can't
[1:27:01] see him but he knoweth the way that I
[1:27:05] take when he hath tried me I shall come
[1:27:11] forth as
[1:27:16] gold look at the word tried it means to
[1:27:20] examine Tred
[1:27:22] prove
[1:27:24] scrutinize to
[1:27:26] test to make a
[1:27:30] trial oh
[1:27:32] God job says my foot ha held his steps
[1:27:37] his way have I kept and not
[1:27:42] declined where are you God and if you
[1:27:45] read the last chapter of the Book of Job
[1:27:48] it's absolutely amazing the Bible says
[1:27:51] when job got got
[1:27:53] better then all of his family started
[1:27:55] coming back around oh
[1:27:57] yeah and every one of them started
[1:28:00] bringing him a piece of
[1:28:02] money well he didn't need it
[1:28:05] then the Bible said God had give him
[1:28:08] twice as much as he so you saying where
[1:28:10] were they when the man was
[1:28:15] broke I've got to say I've had a few
[1:28:18] family members like
[1:28:21] that
[1:28:22] why in the world didn't they come you
[1:28:24] know why they didn't cuz God didn't want
[1:28:26] them
[1:28:27] to I hope you're hearing me today God
[1:28:31] didn't want him to God wanted him and
[1:28:34] job to stand there alone oh Hallelujah
[1:28:37] here they could have come no doubt he
[1:28:38] had some wealthy family and friends and
[1:28:40] they could have come but God just said
[1:28:42] stay away stay away I'm trying this
[1:28:45] piece of Steel I'm trying this bolt I'm
[1:28:48] trying this worship maybe he's trying
[1:28:50] you tonight and you think Lord what's
[1:28:52] going wrong ain't nothing going wrong
[1:28:55] you have found favor in his eyes he
[1:28:58] knows he can trust you he knows he can
[1:29:02] pull feeling away from you week after
[1:29:04] week and you still serve him he knows he
[1:29:07] can allow the devil to come and attack
[1:29:10] your body and lie to you and you'll say
[1:29:12] though the Lord slay me I'll trust him I
[1:29:16] will not turn away I will not turn back
[1:29:19] I press on I press press on I'm ordained
[1:29:24] to be a piece of material in this
[1:29:26] building of God I press
[1:29:29] [Applause]
[1:29:39] on as much as we don't like to say
[1:29:43] it we've still all got a lot of
[1:29:47] alloy and
[1:29:50] ttin and lesser quality
[1:29:53] material in
[1:29:57] us I said in South Africa several years
[1:30:00] ago at a gold
[1:30:03] mine they had a pot of gold there big
[1:30:07] gigantic smelting
[1:30:09] pot they had heated it over and over for
[1:30:13] years the same
[1:30:15] gold right
[1:30:17] car it was several several hundred of
[1:30:22] degrees 1500 1700 something like
[1:30:26] that and the man explaining it that
[1:30:30] every time they heat it to this extreme
[1:30:35] temperature it makes it more
[1:30:42] pure I know what you're thinking some of
[1:30:44] you is already
[1:30:46] sweating me
[1:30:50] too do we want to be more
[1:30:55] pure but do we want the
[1:30:58] process how many wants a
[1:31:03] testimony I see you've heard me say this
[1:31:11] before oh my you imagine the fiery
[1:31:15] trial takes a little bit more of the tin
[1:31:20] and the alloy and the Fool's Gold the
[1:31:22] parate the Magnesium the copper each
[1:31:26] time makes it better and better and
[1:31:32] better what an achievement almighty God
[1:31:35] will
[1:31:37] make when the last one comes to the
[1:31:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost on the earth
[1:31:43] not just get saved but sealed into the
[1:31:48] body and the lamb will step in behind
[1:31:51] behind as it were the
[1:31:54] curtains you see it would be
[1:31:56] Unbecoming for you to see him with blood
[1:32:01] on his garments and him still wearing
[1:32:03] Priestly garments now I know you know
[1:32:06] that already that in the sixth
[1:32:08] Dimension they've not yet seen the Lord
[1:32:11] Jesus Peter's been there for couple
[1:32:14] thousand years he still hadn't seen him
[1:32:17] yet nor Paul and I know you know that
[1:32:19] the sixth Dimension is apparently indiff
[1:32:22] segregated groups because when brother
[1:32:23] Brandon was there he never mentions
[1:32:25] nothing about seeing Paul or lucer or
[1:32:28] Wesley or any of their converts right he
[1:32:30] saw his own and he said where's Jesus I
[1:32:33] want to see him he said he's just a
[1:32:35] little bit higher he'll come to you
[1:32:37] later so remember they haven't seen him
[1:32:39] yet why we still need him on that
[1:32:43] mediatorial Throne is that right as our
[1:32:47] priest I don't know how and I don't know
[1:32:49] when and I don't know how long it'll be
[1:32:53] but I believe it's coming to where his
[1:32:56] people will come to the place on the
[1:32:58] earth that all over the Earth they will
[1:33:01] reach that
[1:33:03] maturity whether it will be 5 minutes 24
[1:33:06] hours whatever it'll be they will no
[1:33:10] longer need a high
[1:33:13] priest will it be five minutes before
[1:33:15] the Rapture probably for a lot of us 30
[1:33:17] seconds
[1:33:19] maybe but won't it be an AB absolute
[1:33:22] miracle that around the earth the bride
[1:33:24] will have finally reached the gold
[1:33:27] quality that is needed to produce a
[1:33:31] Rapture and the high priest arises from
[1:33:34] the throne Oh Glory and steps in behind
[1:33:38] the curtain as it was and the angel
[1:33:40] stand there breathlessly and they look
[1:33:43] at him and they say
[1:33:45] today is the
[1:33:49] day Hallelujah why because when they
[1:33:53] recognize that he's took off his high
[1:33:57] priest
[1:33:58] garments and put on the marriage
[1:34:01] robes glory be to God hallelujah and
[1:34:05] they step out and they look at him and
[1:34:07] say today is the day don't you
[1:34:09] understand his sign of changing clothes
[1:34:13] is a sign you're fixing
[1:34:15] to amen amen whatever he changes what
[1:34:20] that means is you you no longer need a
[1:34:23] mediator you no longer need blood on the
[1:34:26] throne what that means is you're fixing
[1:34:29] to get your body that you have waited
[1:34:32] for all these
[1:34:34] years
[1:34:36] [Applause]
[1:34:44] Hallelujah but before we reach that let
[1:34:47] me read you this next
[1:34:50] quote he he gives you trial after trial
[1:34:54] test after test trial after trial test
[1:34:58] after test until the Life of Christ is
[1:35:02] reflecting in your
[1:35:05] life I thought oh my goodness
[1:35:09] gracious when I read this for the first
[1:35:11] time many years ago and he says he gives
[1:35:14] you trial after trial test after test
[1:35:18] trial after trial test after test I
[1:35:22] thought these words need to make a song
[1:35:25] I said trial after trial test after test
[1:35:29] and trial after trial test after test
[1:35:32] when my Lord is done with
[1:35:35] me I'm going to be my
[1:35:45] best
[1:35:47] wow so it's trial after trial test after
[1:35:50] test trial after trial test after test
[1:35:53] because he don't love
[1:35:55] us because he doesn't care for us
[1:35:57] because somehow we haven't found favor
[1:35:59] in his eyes because we
[1:36:05] have why he's building this great
[1:36:09] mystical
[1:36:12] body she will have such Glory that when
[1:36:16] John saw her on the aisle of
[1:36:18] patmas and the angel says unto him
[1:36:21] come and I will show
[1:36:24] Thee the Lamb's wife yeah and what did
[1:36:28] John say a
[1:36:31] city so a city in Vision reflected you
[1:36:35] on Earth you on Earth reflect the
[1:36:39] Heavenly City now I know we have a hard
[1:36:41] time believing that it much but brother
[1:36:44] Donnie our Humanity but you're looking
[1:36:46] at the wrong thing your humanity is not
[1:36:49] your gold it's what's going on on the
[1:36:52] inside of you don't you see it was his
[1:36:55] Humanity the Lord Jesus that blinded
[1:36:58] them oh I hear the prophet said what was
[1:37:01] a mighty God unveil before something out
[1:37:02] in Philadelphia God they always miss you
[1:37:05] no matter what form you come in you see
[1:37:09] the bride was hid in the groom before
[1:37:11] Pentecost but after Pentecost the groom
[1:37:15] is hid in the bride they didn't see you
[1:37:18] and him then and they don't see him and
[1:37:21] you now and what's really sad is many
[1:37:23] times we don't see him in ourself
[1:37:26] because we know our mistakes we know our
[1:37:29] failures come on somebody and we look at
[1:37:32] oursel I said it years ago and I still
[1:37:34] believe it's the truth one of the
[1:37:35] greatest battles we're going to have in
[1:37:37] this end time is believing over the word
[1:37:40] of God over the top of what we know
[1:37:43] about ourself are we going to believe
[1:37:45] his promise is true are we going to
[1:37:47] believe he works all things for the good
[1:37:50] to them that love the Lord do we believe
[1:37:53] that above our circumstances do we
[1:37:56] believe his word is greater than our
[1:37:58] failures or do we say well I guess I'm
[1:38:01] just not part of
[1:38:03] it I'm not sure anybody is cuz really
[1:38:06] I'm in everybody you look at having
[1:38:08] problems I agree with
[1:38:10] that I've been serving him for 55
[1:38:15] years since I was a 12y old boy been
[1:38:19] preaching since I was 18
[1:38:21] brother Tim preaching younger than me I
[1:38:24] have never seen so many trials and tests
[1:38:27] have you on people's lives it seems like
[1:38:31] everybody you talk to is going through
[1:38:34] so much
[1:38:36] stuff so has he forgotten us does he not
[1:38:40] remember does he not hear our our cries
[1:38:42] our prayers oh no he
[1:38:46] hears and he's
[1:38:50] working
[1:38:51] man is he
[1:38:54] working is it just me is it hot in
[1:38:59] here boy it seemed like it's getting
[1:39:02] heated up in this Christian walk ain't
[1:39:07] it but listen what he wants you to
[1:39:10] become trial after trial test after test
[1:39:13] trial after trial test after test until
[1:39:15] the Life of Christ is reflected in your
[1:39:18] life until you become peaceful
[1:39:22] sober Meek gentle humble
[1:39:28] ready
[1:39:30] submissive wow willing to turn your head
[1:39:35] from the things of the world and looking
[1:39:37] straight to Calvary to the one who's
[1:39:39] doing the
[1:39:41] beating
[1:39:43] beating many times you think it's
[1:39:45] strange because fiery trials and
[1:39:47] sickness and persecution it's only done
[1:39:49] to test you to get the
[1:39:53] dirt out of you to get the
[1:39:58] sludge out of you and the
[1:40:01] slowness out of
[1:40:03] you so you tell me when do you pray the
[1:40:08] most when you're having trouble or when
[1:40:11] everything is going
[1:40:13] well all the bills are paid none of you
[1:40:16] young ones are sick you're all your
[1:40:18] tests come back good and boy I'll tell
[1:40:20] you what it's amazing how folks will
[1:40:22] start missing
[1:40:23] church it's amazing boy they'll do this
[1:40:26] and that and well you can go to church
[1:40:28] anytime I'm not sure who told you that
[1:40:29] but they lied to you there's going to
[1:40:31] come a time you ain't going to be able
[1:40:33] to find not one member of this Bride on
[1:40:34] the earth I believe it could be in the
[1:40:37] morning myself I believe we're that
[1:40:38] close friend we better we better run we
[1:40:41] better run and do everything in our
[1:40:43] hearts that we can clear everything out
[1:40:45] of our
[1:40:47] Lives notice he said till you wake up to
[1:40:51] a place that you can look and see or men
[1:40:53] can see the reflection of Christ in you
[1:40:56] the hope of glory oh he said I think of
[1:40:59] how God takes his children and tests
[1:41:02] them with an
[1:41:05] acid
[1:41:08] test can you imagine dropping a
[1:41:12] jellyfish in an acid
[1:41:16] test can you imagine dropping a
[1:41:19] denominational church member
[1:41:21] in a real test of the word on some of
[1:41:24] their greatest trials is as getting
[1:41:26] ready to go to church and their left
[1:41:28] false eyelash fell
[1:41:31] off and they couldn't find their
[1:41:34] favorite six inch heels to go with their
[1:41:37] favorite pink miniskirt to go with their
[1:41:40] favorite tight blouse so they could
[1:41:43] appear sexy before men and be judging
[1:41:45] her
[1:41:49] adulteries
[1:41:52] they don't have a
[1:41:58] clue oh he said they are time tested
[1:42:03] Witnesses of his
[1:42:04] power listen how he calls you God is
[1:42:08] building a
[1:42:10] bridge from Earth to
[1:42:14] Glory listen what the church
[1:42:18] becomes building a bridge from Earth to
[1:42:21] Glory that the wayfaring may come on the
[1:42:25] highway set down under the tree in the
[1:42:27] cool of the day by time tested
[1:42:33] material God is building a
[1:42:37] bridge you see God passes his seed
[1:42:40] through his
[1:42:45] body now I was a Pentecostal for many
[1:42:47] years of my life as many of you know and
[1:42:49] I did have a Pentecostal experience
[1:42:50] experience I received I believe a
[1:42:53] portion of the spirit of God in
[1:42:55] Pentecost but there ain't no way in the
[1:42:58] world I had then what I got now cuz him
[1:43:03] Pentecostal preachers could not birth me
[1:43:05] under a message of Malachi
[1:43:08] 4 with the Pentecostal gifts restoration
[1:43:12] message I remember whenever Carol read
[1:43:14] the token she stayed up all night long
[1:43:17] crying wailing before God because she
[1:43:21] too had an experience God done something
[1:43:23] for her but yet she still would trim her
[1:43:28] hair so when she read the token she was
[1:43:32] up all night long crying praying crying
[1:43:36] praying until something
[1:43:39] happened in a deeper sense than what she
[1:43:42] had in
[1:43:44] Pentecost so then she could be used as
[1:43:47] time testing material Hallelujah this is
[1:43:51] not about you this is not about me it's
[1:43:54] not about any of these people here as an
[1:43:57] individual it's about us it's about us
[1:44:01] it's about us in India Us in Africa God
[1:44:04] is building a bridge he's not building a
[1:44:06] whole bunch of bridges God ain't taking
[1:44:08] this church and building the bridge to
[1:44:10] Heaven no he's taking you all and taking
[1:44:12] us and taking Indians and taking Chinese
[1:44:14] we are brothers and sisters and a part
[1:44:17] of one another no wonder the Bible tells
[1:44:20] us that we to Bear one another another's
[1:44:21] burdens why if the boat gives way the
[1:44:25] whole Bridge can
[1:44:27] collapse if one Bol cracks the whole
[1:44:30] thing oh my can't you see why you were
[1:44:33] so important in the body of Jesus Christ
[1:44:38] right oh my notice this and I'll close
[1:44:43] the prophet said the reason the old time
[1:44:45] God heartfelt salvation will
[1:44:47] hold the reputation of Christ is at it
[1:44:52] he will not give us something just to
[1:44:54] build a church out of man-made theology
[1:44:56] or some school experience or some Bi
[1:44:59] Bible Seminary a real preacher comes
[1:45:02] down out of the Seminary of God's grace
[1:45:05] amen God's calling and it's time tested
[1:45:09] it'll hold God's got confidence in
[1:45:14] you and we got confidence in
[1:45:19] him
[1:45:23] you believe this friends I know you
[1:45:25] do let me read you something else
[1:45:28] here the prophet said the True Church of
[1:45:31] Jesus Christ the bride is likened to
[1:45:34] pure
[1:45:35] gold her righteousness is his
[1:45:38] righteousness her attributes are his own
[1:45:41] glorious attributes her identity is
[1:45:44] found in him what he is she is to
[1:45:48] reflect what he has she is to
[1:45:51] manifest there is no fault in her she's
[1:45:54] glorious within and without from the
[1:45:56] beginning to the ending she is the work
[1:45:59] of her Lord in fact in her is summed up
[1:46:05] and manifested the
[1:46:07] Eternal wisdom and
[1:46:11] purpose of
[1:46:14] God you got to be kidding me in
[1:46:19] us but our faults with our failures with
[1:46:22] our
[1:46:23] humanity and in US is summed up the
[1:46:27] Eternal wisdom and purpose of God how
[1:46:31] can one fathom it he says how can one
[1:46:34] understand it though we cannot do that
[1:46:36] we accept it by
[1:46:40] faith but remember this bride is made
[1:46:43] out of not only gold but beaten gold
[1:46:47] Hallelujah beaten gold our out of her
[1:46:50] Lord and Master Jesus Christ was ever a
[1:46:53] people so beaten and purged as the Bride
[1:46:56] of Jesus Christ she is filling up the
[1:47:01] sufferings that Christ has left
[1:47:05] behind you know our lives belong to him
[1:47:08] you believe that
[1:47:12] right we prayed constantly for our
[1:47:16] daughter Erica brother Ron brother Tim
[1:47:18] people all over the Earth all over the
[1:47:20] world prayed for
[1:47:23] her there's no way that I believe she
[1:47:26] was going to die no way and God kept it
[1:47:31] from
[1:47:32] me as a matter of fact I don't know of
[1:47:34] any preacher friends that I have around
[1:47:35] the world that it was revealed to any of
[1:47:37] them that she was going to
[1:47:41] pass the first Sunday that I walked up
[1:47:43] into the pullit at
[1:47:45] home I sat back in my chair before I
[1:47:47] came out of the office and I was sick as
[1:47:49] a dog
[1:47:51] I didn't think I was going to have the
[1:47:52] strength to walk out and
[1:47:56] preach and Satan telling me yeah boy

[1:48:53] taken and the devil spoke to me one day
[1:48:56] in an audible voice I heard it few
[1:48:59] months before she passed and he said if
[1:49:02] you will let up on me I'll let up on
[1:49:09] her and I laughed and said you're
[1:49:12] barking up the wrong tree you talking to
[1:49:14] the wrong
[1:49:16] preacher no
[1:49:19] way
[1:49:29] maybe the devil's told your pastor if
[1:49:31] you'll quit preaching and quit praying
[1:49:32] for folks and quit doing this and that
[1:49:34] and the other I might let up on you I'll
[1:49:37] tell you one thing we don't want to make
[1:49:39] no deal with the Devil he's the biggest
[1:49:41] liar you ever seen in all of your life
[1:49:44] and if you let up then he'd say ha I
[1:49:46] changed my mind so therefore we ain't

[1:50:39] Christ and it will stand
[1:50:42] Hallelujah out of time
[1:50:45] tested
[1:50:49] material
[1:50:51] oh let me read you this before I turn
[1:50:53] the service over to
[1:50:57] Ender the prophet said he may commit you
[1:50:59] to
[1:51:01] death as he did
[1:51:03] Paul he may commit you to
[1:51:06] suffering as he did
[1:51:09] job that is his
[1:51:13] prerogative I told Lance my son-in-law
[1:51:16] not long ago Erica's husband I said
[1:51:19] Lance think of it
[1:51:21] if Erica had never been sick and never
[1:51:23] went through all this whole thing that
[1:51:24] she went
[1:51:25] through how many people would have been
[1:51:28] touched by her
[1:51:29] life
[1:51:31] amen as a matter of fact Erica never did
[1:51:33] think she was
[1:51:35] anybody just my little
[1:51:37] girl she never thought herself important
[1:51:41] every time I would tell her people
[1:51:42] praying for she'd cry she said Daddy I
[1:51:45] just can't believe it I just can't
[1:51:47] believe it people would love me that
[1:51:49] much her little little simple life has
[1:51:51] touched people all over this
[1:51:54] world is't that amazing only God can do
[1:51:56] that we know that only God can do that
[1:52:00] but would the would that have happened
[1:52:03] if she would have been
[1:52:07] well would y all would have prayed for
[1:52:09] her if she was well and didn't need
[1:52:11] prayer you wouldn't have it's just not
[1:52:13] the way we do it right we pray for
[1:52:15] people and we're constant we
[1:52:16] prioritizing the the the the sickness
[1:52:19] and the disease and so on the intensity
[1:52:21] of it we're top you know we're placing
[1:52:22] the person on the top list of our prayer
[1:52:24] list and constantly changing
[1:52:26] around but God somehow use that little
[1:52:29] life to touch so many
[1:52:32] people a housewife that Harding nobody
[1:52:36] knew right she made a trip with us to
[1:52:38] South Africa she made a few trips here
[1:52:40] and there not that
[1:52:42] many
[1:52:44] Hallelujah but a simple little girl that
[1:52:47] believed God with all of her heart
[1:52:51] and I heard her the day before she
[1:52:54] passed as she pulled her four daughters
[1:52:55] up and was able to talk to them each one
[1:52:58] of
[1:52:59] them and I heard her as she told one of
[1:53:02] them don't you never forget it we serve
[1:53:07] a mighty
[1:53:11] God a mighty
[1:53:13] God I saw her the head of the nursing
[1:53:16] come in there an hour or so before she
[1:53:18] passed
[1:53:20] walked into the room and Saidi hear you
[1:53:23] all are the cream of the crop I hear you
[1:53:27] all are I mean that thought who in the
[1:53:28] world is this woman and going look like
[1:53:29] a
[1:53:32] jezebel talking to us you know leaned
[1:53:35] over and talked to Erica and said Erica
[1:53:37] Erica couldn't speak by then I want you
[1:53:40] to know what a joy it's been for us
[1:53:44] lives have been touched on this floor by
[1:53:48] you when she passed nurses in her room
[1:53:51] crying nurses out on the hallway crying
[1:53:54] nurses at the nurses station crying
[1:53:57] don't telling how many people they'd
[1:53:58] seen
[1:53:59] pass but you see there's something
[1:54:02] different when a daughter of God is
[1:54:05] there so Sisters You Don't Have To Be A
[1:54:07] preacher come on he's saying oh I've
[1:54:09] never done nothing for God I've never
[1:54:11] preached nor did Erica except her
[1:54:14] children of
[1:54:15] course she's the Fifth
[1:54:17] Gospel she never sang that much
[1:54:21] although someone heard a song that ER
[1:54:24] Erica had sung about five years ago
[1:54:27] Carol something like that I've been
[1:54:29] wanting to get it to y'all so you could
[1:54:31] hear
[1:54:32] it the name of the
[1:54:34] song was he believes in
[1:54:39] me the words of the song was about a
[1:54:42] trial and a test and this and that that
[1:54:44] you go through little did the poor
[1:54:47] little thing know it was like a PR
[1:54:51] prophecy he believed in
[1:54:53] her whenever she was getting close that
[1:54:57] night I got my phone out of my pocket
[1:55:00] went over by her
[1:55:01] bed and started reading the Lord is my
[1:55:07] shepherd I shall not
[1:55:09] want aren't you glad friends when we get
[1:55:12] ready to cross there we've got a
[1:55:14] Shepherd that can take our
[1:55:17] hands oh praise speak to
[1:55:24] God
[1:55:27] hallelujah he is Sovereign but it is all
[1:55:30] with a purpose if he did not have a
[1:55:33] purpose he would be the author of
[1:55:35] frustration and not peace his purpose is
[1:55:41] after we have suffered a while we would
[1:55:44] be made perfect be established
[1:55:48] strengthened and settled that's
[1:55:52] right praise
