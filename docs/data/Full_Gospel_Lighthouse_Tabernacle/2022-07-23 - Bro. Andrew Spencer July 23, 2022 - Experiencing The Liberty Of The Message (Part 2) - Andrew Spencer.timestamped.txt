[42:40] what a privilege it is for us as his
[42:42] children to be standing right here
[42:46] as a living oracle of jesus christ a
[42:49] token
[42:50] a token to this generation
[42:52] that jesus is alive and what a powerful
[42:55] name it truly is and
[42:57] i heard brother branham say before we

[43:18] this evening is to feed on the word of
[43:20] god and we'd like to thank all of you
[43:22] your parents and all the little children
[43:24] that came today for the kids day and i
[43:26] know that the kids really enjoyed it
[43:28] and
[43:30] some of the parents were asking
[43:32] when can we have our day like that so
[43:36] i'm afraid that some of us would need a
[43:38] prayer line directly after a after an
[43:40] event like that so
[43:42] we're certainly uh was certainly
[43:44] privileged to have the group that we
[43:45] have here and uh

[44:53] lord
[44:54] lord i i can feel the atmosphere in this
[44:57] place it's not the atmosphere that you
[44:59] find in a restaurant it's not the
[45:01] atmosphere that you'll find down at a
[45:03] maybe a pool hall or something like that
[45:05] of that nature or a movie theater
[45:08] lord but this is the atmosphere
[45:10] that has been created by a people that

[45:19] behind this atmosphere

[45:24] this is your message

[45:28] standing in this hour lord and what a
[45:30] privileged people that we are if our
[45:32] prophet would stand and say if he could
[45:34] have chose
[45:35] any day to live in he would chose this
[45:37] day
[45:38] father i'm so thankful that you chose us

[46:57] if you have your bibles this evening i'd
[46:58] like to look into two portions of
[47:00] scripture this evening
[47:02] over in the book of luke chapter 4 and
[47:04] verse 17
[47:06] and then
[47:07] then back in the old testament in the
[47:09] book of joel
[47:11] joel chapter 2 and verse 23.
[47:37] luke chapter 4
[47:41] luke chapter 4 and verse 17.
[47:45] i'd like to speak to you again this this
[47:47] weekend or carry on our thought from
[47:49] last weekend on
[47:50] and experiencing the liberty of the
[47:52] message
[47:55] i trust you all enjoyed the services
[47:57] last weekend and
[48:00] i know most of you are here so you're
[48:02] you'll just jump right in the thought
[48:03] with us this evening and now try not to
[48:05] go back through everything that we we
[48:08] spoke last weekend but i want to speak
[48:09] to you something that we got involved in
[48:11] last weekend on
[48:13] there and uh
[48:15] just something that the lord has stirred
[48:16] up in my heart sometimes sometimes as
[48:19] preachers you don't realize where the
[48:20] lord has taken you and then all of a
[48:22] sudden he opens up a new vein for you
[48:23] and
[48:24] so we just like to look down through
[48:26] this thought and this evening luke
[48:28] chapter 4 and verse 17
[48:30] and there was delivered unto him the
[48:32] book of the prophet isaiah
[48:34] and when he had opened the book he found
[48:36] the place where it was written that the
[48:38] spirit of the lord is upon me because he
[48:41] hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
[48:43] the poor
[48:44] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[48:47] to preach deliverance to the captives
[48:49] and recovering of the sight to the bond
[48:52] to set at liberty them that are bruised
[48:55] to preach the acceptable year of the
[48:57] lord
[48:59] and he closed the book
[49:01] and he gave it again to the minister and
[49:02] sat down in the eyes of all of them
[49:05] that were in the synagogue were fastened
[49:07] on him
[49:08] and he began to say unto them this day
[49:11] is this scripture fulfilled
[49:14] in your ears
[49:15] joel chapter 2 and verse 23
[49:29] amen don't you just love the reading of
[49:31] the word
[49:33] amen joel chapter 2
[49:35] and verse 23
[49:37] be glad then you children of a zion and
[49:40] rejoice in the lord your god for he hath
[49:43] given you the former rain moderately and
[49:46] he will cause
[49:47] to come down for you the rain the former
[49:50] rain and the latter rain in the first
[49:53] month
[49:54] and the floors shall be full of wheat
[49:55] and the fats
[49:57] shall overflow with wine and oil
[49:59] and i will restore to you the years that
[50:02] the locusts hath eaten the cankerworm
[50:05] and the caterpillar and the palmer worm
[50:06] my great army which i sent amongst you
[50:09] and ye shall eat in plenty and be
[50:10] satisfied and praise the name of your
[50:13] lord your god
[50:14] that it dealt wondrously with you and my
[50:17] people shall never be ashamed
[50:20] and you shall know that i am in the
[50:21] midst of israel and that i am the lord
[50:24] your god and none else and my people
[50:27] shall never be ashamed and it shall come
[50:30] to pass afterward that i will pour out
[50:32] my spirit upon all flesh and your sons
[50:33] and your daughters shall prophesy
[50:36] and your old men shall dream dreams and
[50:38] your young men shall see visions may god
[50:41] bless his word he may be seated
[50:44] in the presence of the lord
[50:46] as you said we'd like to continue on
[50:47] that thought on the experience and
[50:49] the liberty
[50:51] of the message and i certainly thank the
[50:53] lord for this message
[50:56] but i know that i know that for some of
[50:58] us
[50:58] most of us sitting here this evening it
[51:00] was it is a pretty easy task for us to
[51:02] be able to come to the house of the lord
[51:05] it was something that we longed to do
[51:06] it's something that we enjoy doing is
[51:08] going to the house of the lord because
[51:10] that's where we as saints we get our
[51:12] feeding we feed on daily we feed on this
[51:15] message but to but to be able to come to
[51:17] the house of worship and a house of
[51:19] prayer and to be able to enter into his
[51:21] courts with thanksgiving in our hearts
[51:22] it's it's rather easy for a real son and
[51:24] daughter of god because you have
[51:26] experienced the power of the true
[51:28] message but we realize that there are
[51:30] those that have to fight to get into the
[51:32] building they they have to fight they're
[51:34] young people they're they they fight
[51:36] their young people young people or their
[51:37] children and they're and they're
[51:39] fighting this way or that way maybe
[51:41] maybe they're just trying to get into
[51:42] the building young people fighting
[51:44] because they don't want to don't want to
[51:45] go again or they or they're just
[51:47] battling because because they're going
[51:49] through the times and the spots of life
[51:51] that that get a little bit sticky and
[51:54] but yet there there is something that is
[51:56] on the inside of them that they they
[51:58] still feel a draw to go there and it's
[52:01] amazing thing when somebody begins to
[52:03] fight to get into the building and just
[52:05] to know that if they can get close to
[52:07] him that he'll meet their every need but
[52:09] for us that have experienced the true
[52:12] and living god we have come unto we have
[52:14] come into his camp we have we've heard
[52:17] the shout of the king amongst us and and
[52:19] we recognize that we've come into into
[52:21] an experience that this this message or
[52:24] that the easter message is not some
[52:26] fairy tale it's not some santa claus
[52:28] story but this is something that we
[52:31] personally experienced and i believe
[52:33] that is something that every single one
[52:34] of us have to have is an experience with
[52:37] elohim and experience with jehovah and
[52:40] experience with the one that is the
[52:42] author of the word and you begin to
[52:44] think about abraham that how that he
[52:46] endured seeing him who was invisible
[52:49] because he had had a conference with god
[52:51] and he met him face to face and he had
[52:54] an experience and he was able to go
[52:55] through the trials of life and if you're
[52:57] able if you you were in a spot that you
[52:59] have met him face to face that you can
[53:01] go through some things that maybe you
[53:03] didn't think that you were able to go
[53:04] through because you had an experience
[53:06] with him i i really can't imagine
[53:09] somebody battling through lay out a seal
[53:11] or battling through the of the chaos of
[53:13] laodicea without an experience with the
[53:15] true and living god i really can't
[53:17] imagine somebody going through the
[53:18] battle of cancer without knowing god i
[53:20] can't imagine going through the chaos of
[53:23] life without knowing god and i think
[53:25] about abraham that that once he had met
[53:27] him he he called those things that were
[53:30] not as though they were because he had
[53:32] an experience with him and you'll see
[53:35] somebody you'll see somebody as a child
[53:37] of god you watch them as they as they
[53:39] walk into the promises of god you'll see
[53:42] them they call those things as as that
[53:44] were not as though they were you see
[53:46] they're walking by faith because they're
[53:48] not walking by themselves but they're
[53:50] walking with the king of kings and
[53:52] abraham was it was a patriarch of faith
[53:54] he was he was he was a for forerunner
[53:57] and he was a man that we looked to a man
[54:00] of faith a man that had confidence in
[54:02] god and he had to walk away and separate
[54:04] himself from everything that he knew he
[54:06] had to separate from his mother and his
[54:08] father he had to separate from
[54:09] everything he had to go down into spots
[54:12] but god was going to use him to express
[54:14] through him and manifest through him
[54:17] that this was god that was doing these
[54:20] myths when he walked down there if lot
[54:22] it was god with him when he walked down
[54:24] there into the king of guru with the
[54:26] king of gorier and all of those events
[54:28] that took place it was the event of
[54:30] melchizedek that showed us that this is
[54:33] the hour that we are to be living in
[54:36] you think about who is the one that is
[54:38] amongst us it's none other than this
[54:40] melchizedek that the same one that
[54:42] abraham met is the same one that you're
[54:44] meeting right here in this congregation
[54:46] and not that same melchizedek has
[54:49] promised that he would be here it's none
[54:51] other than our lord jesus christ and to
[54:53] think that tonight that you have the
[54:55] ability
[54:56] as a preacher of the message of the hour
[54:58] i think it's such a grand thing to be
[55:00] able to stand here knowing whether
[55:03] shortly that i can preach this message
[55:05] in its fullness in its sureness in his
[55:07] purity and stand here that maybe your
[55:10] young people or maybe somebody sitting
[55:12] here hasn't had an experience with this
[55:14] god but i can stand here by the word of
[55:16] the lord and i can preach this message
[55:18] and i know that if i preach this message
[55:20] in its power that he will come and
[55:22] demonstrate that this is the message of
[55:26] the hour it's not a message of another
[55:28] day but this is the message of this day
[55:30] and i can stand here i can roll my
[55:32] shoulders back when the enemy wants to
[55:34] shut the service down or the enemy wants
[55:36] to come in like a flood i can roll my
[55:39] shoulders back knowing shortly that god
[55:41] will back up the message because god is
[55:44] here for you to experience him in power
[55:47] and in truth and i think it's such an
[55:49] amazing thing when all hell is against
[55:52] the church of the living god that we can
[55:54] stand here and preach the most powerful
[55:56] message that's been ever given upon the
[55:58] face of the earth we can stand here it's
[56:01] not something that's just in book form
[56:03] but it's an experience it's life
[56:07] it's life but you remember what what age
[56:09] that we're living in that this is the
[56:11] seventh church age and we realize that
[56:13] it was this age that christ was standing
[56:16] on the outside and he was knocking
[56:18] trying to get in but you remember that
[56:20] famous picture that man that that man
[56:22] that draw jesus knocking at the door and
[56:24] it went through the hall of critics and
[56:26] they said we've only found one spot
[56:28] where we could criticize you upon your
[56:30] artwork it's that there is no latch upon
[56:33] the door and the man said the latch is
[56:35] on the inside you've got to let him in
[56:38] you see that's the way it is with the
[56:40] church and with every individual you've
[56:42] got to be the one to let christ in it
[56:45] isn't the pastor's job it isn't your
[56:46] mama's job you've got to be the one that
[56:49] will stand there and open the door and
[56:51] jesus said any man that will open the
[56:53] door i will come into him and i will sup
[56:56] with him you see what you're feeding on
[56:58] your soul has been conditioned to feed
[57:00] only upon the word of god now you
[57:02] remember what happened over there with
[57:04] those two disciples when they were
[57:05] walking down the road of emmaus they
[57:08] were walking down there and they were
[57:09] talking about the scriptures and they
[57:11] come in acquaintance they come into
[57:13] acquaintance with somebody and they say
[57:15] well you've not heard these things where
[57:17] have you been at man they they've
[57:19] crucified the one that we thought was
[57:21] the messiah and he began to take them
[57:23] through the scriptures from moses all
[57:25] the way to where they were and he
[57:27] preached christ to them but they never
[57:29] recognized that it was him
[57:31] brother branham would say he said in in
[57:34] in their eyes were opened he said and
[57:36] the preached word never did it
[57:38] he preached to them all those seven
[57:40] miles he preached to them all the way
[57:42] over there and they never got it here
[57:45] was the ones that were standing real
[57:46] close to him they had experienced what
[57:49] he'd done in his life in his three and a
[57:51] half years they'd experienced him
[57:53] hand-to-hand they watched how he handled
[57:55] the word they watched how he preached up
[57:56] there in matthew chapter five they
[57:58] watched him but when when they were
[58:01] walking down the road the preached word
[58:03] never opened up their eyes but when he
[58:05] got on the inside
[58:07] when he got on the inside it was that
[58:09] something that he had done before you
[58:11] see they watched the accents
[58:15] [Music]
[58:16] hallelujah they watched the actions of
[58:18] the one that was sitting there and if it
[58:20] had not been for them constraining him
[58:23] to get on the inside they would have
[58:25] went jesus would have went on the
[58:27] bible's head but because somebody had in
[58:29] a pool had a poor to get him on the
[58:31] inside i happen to believe that it is
[58:33] this pool that is pulled elohim
[58:36] right into the tent door with us
[58:39] it's pulled elohim on the inside of the
[58:41] tent door
[58:48] you forgive me just for a minute
[58:51] but i can imagine
[58:52] as jesus begins to break the bread
[58:56] and their eyes begin to get opened up to
[58:58] the thought that this is
[59:02] him just give me just a little bit of
[59:05] liberty right here
[59:08] i can imagine as jesus is
[59:10] standing there and he's he's doing the
[59:12] same acts
[59:13] that he did with them those three and a
[59:15] half years
[59:17] and i could see those disciples looking
[59:18] into his eyes
[59:21] i could see him maybe
[59:23] put their hands their hands on his face
[59:25] and said jesus
[59:27] is that you
[59:29] because of his actions
[59:31] because of his actions how he handled
[59:32] himself
[59:34] how did he broke how that he broke the
[59:35] bread of life it showed to them this was
[59:38] him
[59:39] you see there are many that have said
[59:40] under the preaching of the word and they
[59:42] have missed that this is jesus but
[59:44] because you stood still long enough
[59:47] to let the word wash you to let you
[59:49] stand there and watch his actions that
[59:51] this is the same one that is amongst us
[59:53] you can roll your hands over on his eyes
[59:55] you can roll your hand over on his skin
[59:57] and you can fold back the pages of the
[59:59] bible and you can look over in
[1:00:01] revelations 10. you can look over luke
[1:00:03] 17 and 30. you can look over and look at
[1:00:06] malachi 4 and you can say jesus
[1:00:09] is that you
[1:00:12] you notice it took them all day long to
[1:00:14] get over there but when they recognized
[1:00:17] this was the same one
[1:00:19] this was the one that brought the
[1:00:21] message this was the one they ran back
[1:00:23] to their city it didn't take them but a
[1:00:25] half an hour to get back there it's
[1:00:27] amazing the liberty of the holy ghost
[1:00:30] when the revelation sets in
[1:00:33] you think well oh i'll never do anything
[1:00:35] like that let me say this when the
[1:00:37] anointing of the lord gets upon you
[1:00:39] you'll never know how you act you will
[1:00:40] act accordingly how elohim wants you to
[1:00:43] act if if ahab if ahab took his fastest
[1:00:47] horses and he was riding back down there
[1:00:50] to a city and and elijah was up there
[1:00:53] looking
[1:00:56] he was looking up there said is there
[1:00:58] any rain yet is there any rain is there
[1:01:01] any clouds up there in the sky yet and
[1:01:03] he didn't even have enough strength
[1:01:05] after the mount carmel experience he
[1:01:07] didn't even have enough strength to
[1:01:08] climb the mountain a pair but his
[1:01:10] turrets and his servant get hazel go up
[1:01:12] there and look and see if there's any
[1:01:14] clouds up there and if just do you see
[1:01:17] any signs that there's going to be some
[1:01:19] rain in this place do you see any signs
[1:01:21] that the message is still true do you
[1:01:23] still see any signs that jesus is still
[1:01:25] god do you still see any times that he's
[1:01:27] here and amongst us
[1:01:29] oh
[1:01:30] i ain't seen nothing yet go back up
[1:01:32] there and look again you say where are
[1:01:34] we living at i'm telling you to climb
[1:01:36] the hill one more time and look at this
[1:01:39] jesus
[1:01:41] elijah all i see is a cloud of the size
[1:01:45] of a hand of a man and elijah didn't
[1:01:48] have enough he didn't have enough energy
[1:01:49] to climb that mountain but when the
[1:01:51] anointing struck his heart he got some
[1:01:54] energy on the inside of him that he ran
[1:01:57] 17 miles all the way back into the city
[1:02:00] he said ahab get your rain barrels ready
[1:02:05] there is such power in the anointing
[1:02:07] when the word begins to get revealed
[1:02:16] brother branham would preach a
[1:02:18] very powerful message
[1:02:21] right out here in harrisonburg
[1:02:25] on the door to the heart
[1:02:27] he would tell us
[1:02:29] you can go out there and you can still
[1:02:30] find the building where brother brown
[1:02:31] and preach that it's out there on the
[1:02:32] other side of downtown harrisonburg in
[1:02:35] the armory building
[1:02:37] brandon preaches power very five five
[1:02:39] foot very powerful messages there but
[1:02:42] one of them being the door to the heart
[1:02:45] and he comes there and he and he goes
[1:02:47] through the rooms of the heart that
[1:02:48] you've got to be the one to let him in
[1:02:51] you've got to be the one to open up the
[1:02:52] door
[1:02:53] and he said in there he said everybody
[1:02:56] wants to be saved he said but they don't
[1:02:58] want to make him lord of all
[1:03:00] he said he said they they come in there
[1:03:02] he said there's a door on the right hand
[1:03:03] side he said that's the door of the
[1:03:05] private life they said they want you to
[1:03:07] be a savior but they don't want you to
[1:03:09] be the lord over their private life god
[1:03:11] don't go down there messing with my
[1:03:12] private life god i don't want you i
[1:03:14] don't want you menacing down there just
[1:03:15] just leave all that alone you're welcome
[1:03:17] here you're welcome here at the door but
[1:03:19] don't go into this room and he said he
[1:03:21] said yo you can go over in the next room
[1:03:23] and he said you can find that room you
[1:03:25] can find that room of prejudice that
[1:03:28] room of prejudice and he said you'll
[1:03:29] find those people that call themselves
[1:03:31] christians he said they won't speak to
[1:03:32] this woman because she did something to
[1:03:34] them years ago
[1:03:37] they won't share the gospel they won't
[1:03:38] share the gospel or they won't share
[1:03:40] what god did for them in their life he
[1:03:42] said he said it's that lord prejudice
[1:03:44] that it won't let christ be lord of all
[1:03:47] he said but the problem is he said
[1:03:49] instead of a holy life he said it's a
[1:03:51] perverted life and he said what the
[1:03:53] church needs is not a facelift he said
[1:03:55] what the church in the heat is a death
[1:03:57] and a birth he said but you can go on
[1:04:00] through the rooms of the heart and he
[1:04:01] said you go in there and you can find in
[1:04:03] the door of selfishness he said they
[1:04:05] want him as a savior because they don't
[1:04:06] want to go to hell but they don't want
[1:04:08] him to be the lord of their life
[1:04:10] he said but it's at the door of
[1:04:13] selfishness is that they they serving
[1:04:15] christ for their own motive
[1:04:18] they're serving god if you'll heal me i
[1:04:20] serve you if you say if you save uncle
[1:04:23] johnny if you save him from this battle
[1:04:25] if you save him from that battle i'll
[1:04:27] serve you because they're serving god
[1:04:29] out of a very selfish motive but brother
[1:04:31] branham comes all the way through and he
[1:04:34] works his way throughout the doors of
[1:04:36] the heart he said but there's one more
[1:04:38] door that i'd like to deal with he said
[1:04:40] it's the door
[1:04:41] of your faith
[1:04:42] he said it's the door of faith he said
[1:04:45] but now many times he said still people
[1:04:47] want to keep him on the outside
[1:04:49] he said but they don't want him to be
[1:04:51] the lord of their faith he said but if
[1:04:54] jesus when jesus becomes lord of your
[1:04:57] faith then all of his words become real
[1:04:59] to you
[1:05:01] he said that's the reason people can't
[1:05:03] believe for divine healing yet they're
[1:05:05] members of the christian church they got
[1:05:07] they got jesus at the door but if he
[1:05:09] could stand in that little door of faith
[1:05:11] he said he would be your faith
[1:05:15] he said this right here to you and
[1:05:17] harrisonburg seeds were being dropped
[1:05:19] right here
[1:05:20] he would be the lord of your faith and i
[1:05:23] could not imagine that the man who wrote
[1:05:25] the bible turn around and deny the bible
[1:05:28] don't you recognize what he's doing if
[1:05:31] god will be the lord of your life he'll
[1:05:33] be the lord of your selfishness he'll be
[1:05:35] the lord of your perverted life he'll be
[1:05:37] the lord he'll be the lord of your
[1:05:39] prejudice he will be the lord of your
[1:05:41] faith
[1:05:44] oh i i think that's quite powerful this
[1:05:46] evening if you're gonna let christ be
[1:05:48] the lord of your faith it's not you
[1:05:50] trying to work up a faith to believe in
[1:05:52] the promises of god but god already
[1:05:55] believes his word to be true
[1:05:58] god already knows that there's going to
[1:05:59] be a rapture god already knows there's
[1:06:02] going to be a bride that's without
[1:06:03] spotting without wrinkle god already
[1:06:05] knows
[1:06:07] i'm going to have myself just a good old
[1:06:09] dance in time i'm handing the microphone
[1:06:11] over to somebody else and let them
[1:06:12] preach tonight i've done spent all day
[1:06:13] with elohim i've never had an experience
[1:06:16] with him but when christ becomes the
[1:06:18] lord of your faith it's no longer
[1:06:20] doubting at the word it's no longer
[1:06:22] believing well could he do it here or
[1:06:25] maybe that was the days gone by but when
[1:06:27] he's the lord of your faith
[1:06:30] all things are possible
[1:06:33] to them
[1:06:34] i believe
[1:06:36] now remember what what
[1:06:38] webster said about liberty that liberty
[1:06:41] is the freedom
[1:06:42] from restraint
[1:06:44] it is in a general sense inapplicable to
[1:06:46] the body it is a state of exemption from
[1:06:49] the control of others so when you let
[1:06:51] him be the lord
[1:06:53] of your faith
[1:06:55] you're pulling all of your strings off
[1:06:57] of it
[1:06:58] when you're letting him be lord
[1:07:02] lord means ownership that means he owns
[1:07:04] your faith that means he owns your life
[1:07:07] and when you allow somebody when you
[1:07:09] allow somebody liberty to walk into your
[1:07:12] house
[1:07:15] if you really tell you tell me that i'm
[1:07:16] welcome when i come into your house
[1:07:19] i can run in there
[1:07:21] not only do this at a few people's house
[1:07:22] because i really feel welcome
[1:07:24] but if you really welcome me in there
[1:07:27] i can have every right to go in and jump
[1:07:30] on the couch the way i want to or i can
[1:07:32] go in there and get in the refrigerator
[1:07:34] or i'll go in there and give me a cup of
[1:07:36] coffee because you're really giving me
[1:07:37] liberty and when you let christ be the
[1:07:40] lord of your life you're letting him
[1:07:42] into every portion of your life you're
[1:07:44] giving him full liberty
[1:07:47] oh i i pray right now that if anybody
[1:07:51] has not given him full liberty to their
[1:07:52] life that they would bow their heart
[1:07:54] before the preaching of the lord goes
[1:07:56] forward and said god
[1:07:58] have full liberty right here
[1:08:00] take complete control of my life take
[1:08:02] complete control of my situations take
[1:08:05] complete control of everything
[1:08:10] hallelujah it's the greatest decision
[1:08:12] anybody would make but when brother ben
[1:08:13] and i'm going to go forward just now my
[1:08:15] brother brandon when he's coming down to
[1:08:17] the the closing hours of his ministry in
[1:08:20] 1964 he preaches a very powerful message
[1:08:23] on the unveiling god the unveiling of
[1:08:26] god the mighty god before us and brother
[1:08:28] madam comes down to the closing of that
[1:08:30] message in 1964 and he begins to speak
[1:08:34] to us about an auction that's taking
[1:08:36] place
[1:08:37] about the man that that they're
[1:08:38] auctioning off this violin that it's
[1:08:40] that its strings are all loose and it
[1:08:42] looks very invaluable to all of all of
[1:08:45] the onlookers but the man
[1:08:47] they they start bidding it off and he
[1:08:49] said who will give 50 cents who would
[1:08:51] give a dollar and nobody wanted to visit
[1:08:53] nobody wanted to give anything for it
[1:08:55] but there was a man
[1:08:57] that had that had a knowledge
[1:09:00] of what that thing was worth
[1:09:02] he had a knowledge of how valuable this
[1:09:05] violin was
[1:09:06] and so he stopped the auction and he
[1:09:09] took that violin and he started
[1:09:11] tightening up and tuning up that violin
[1:09:13] and he started taking the bow and he
[1:09:16] started wringing out a song across it
[1:09:18] and he started breathing out across it
[1:09:20] he said when he took that
[1:09:22] when he took that bow and he breathed
[1:09:25] across that violin everybody saw the
[1:09:28] value they saw the value and its true
[1:09:31] quality of what that violin was really
[1:09:33] worth
[1:09:36] brother branham will say oh
[1:09:38] why don't you let him rise him up the
[1:09:40] bow
[1:09:41] and let him breathe across your heart
[1:09:44] let him be the master of the world let
[1:09:45] the master of the word come across the
[1:09:48] word of your heart
[1:09:50] so that you could see the true value of
[1:09:53] what this word is
[1:09:57] you'll see that it was the same one that
[1:09:59] was poured out up there on the day of
[1:10:01] pentecost when he conoces himself when
[1:10:04] he emptied himself out
[1:10:06] when he poured himself out you'll see
[1:10:08] it's the same one
[1:10:13] why don't you let the master of the word
[1:10:14] come
[1:10:16] ring across your heart to not
[1:10:20] so you'll see that this is
[1:10:22] this is him that is amongst us that it
[1:10:24] won't just be another's experience but
[1:10:26] this will be your experience
[1:10:30] if you would sit back and you'd watch a
[1:10:32] man
[1:10:33] i ain't got too many empty pages here
[1:10:35] but
[1:10:36] if you'd take you'd watch a man
[1:10:38] come and take an empty sheet of paper
[1:10:42] and you'd watch him as he starts
[1:10:44] he starts working across that paper
[1:10:47] and he starts making some dots on that
[1:10:49] paper
[1:10:52] then he starts drawing some lines on
[1:10:54] that paper
[1:10:56] and then he you're not understanding
[1:10:58] what he's doing
[1:11:00] you're unaware of what's happening
[1:11:04] but somebody's at work
[1:11:07] somebody's at work
[1:11:10] you see i can tell you
[1:11:12] i could grab this book everybody here
[1:11:14] knows what's on the inside of this book
[1:11:17] but if i would take a book from over
[1:11:19] here or whatnot i'd grab it and i'd
[1:11:21] bring it before you wouldn't necessarily
[1:11:22] know or understand what's on it
[1:11:24] unless i told you what was on it
[1:11:26] but if you're watching this man with
[1:11:28] this blank piece of paper start making
[1:11:30] some dots across the lines
[1:11:32] across the pages and he brings down some
[1:11:35] lines off of those dots
[1:11:36] and then there he put some rest on the
[1:11:39] inside on the inside of those dots and
[1:11:41] before before all of those dots he
[1:11:43] starts putting a cleft at the beginning
[1:11:45] of it what is he doing he's creating
[1:11:47] sheet music
[1:11:49] and he's creating a music that will
[1:11:51] wring out a song that the master has
[1:11:54] designed
[1:11:55] and he's designing the sheet music in
[1:11:58] such a way so that it'll ring out
[1:12:00] exactly what he destined for it to be
[1:12:03] now there's a lot of people that have
[1:12:05] looked at the sheet music and they can
[1:12:07] see that it's sheet music but they don't
[1:12:09] understand the heart of the master
[1:12:12] but i happen to believe that ever since
[1:12:14] the revealing of the seven seals that
[1:12:16] there is a people on the face of the
[1:12:18] earth
[1:12:20] that understand after those seven seals
[1:12:22] you watch what was happening it was that
[1:12:24] uniting time it was the invisible union
[1:12:26] with the bride it was the red lights
[1:12:28] flashing
[1:12:29] it was the token that this message was
[1:12:32] all capped off in
[1:12:35] you see that is the capping of the
[1:12:37] message it's when christ comes and
[1:12:40] dwells on the inside of you
[1:12:44] you see you see each and every one of
[1:12:45] your lives you wasn't in a spot that you
[1:12:48] could wring out the sheet music
[1:12:50] but god had to get you to a spot
[1:12:53] so that you could be in a space in a
[1:12:55] space of time
[1:12:57] that you could so echo out the sheet
[1:12:59] music
[1:13:04] let's say we we could look at jacob
[1:13:06] jacob he look at his life he was nothing
[1:13:08] but a scheister he was nothing but uh he
[1:13:10] was no he was good for nothing he'd lie
[1:13:12] to his dad he he did all kinds of wrong
[1:13:14] deeds
[1:13:15] but look at the seed you always watch
[1:13:18] the power of the seed you watch those
[1:13:21] two twins how that they were constantly
[1:13:23] fighting against each other how that
[1:13:25] they were constantly battling against
[1:13:26] each other
[1:13:28] but you watch that seed you watch what
[1:13:30] that seed did that one
[1:13:33] one sold out
[1:13:34] sold out as birthright but one loved
[1:13:36] that birthright you watch that seed you
[1:13:38] can watch there's some people that are
[1:13:40] good church members but they never go on
[1:13:43] all the way up onto pentecost you watch
[1:13:45] the power of that seed and jacob was
[1:13:48] known as a shy star he he fooled his own
[1:13:51] father-in-law and he tricked him into
[1:13:53] these things and he left camp early but
[1:13:55] on the other side of a river one time he
[1:13:58] got into a wrestling match with an angel
[1:14:01] and it showed what was on the inside of
[1:14:03] jacob
[1:14:06] let me preach to you just a moment it
[1:14:08] showed what was on the inside of this
[1:14:09] message on the inside of the message
[1:14:11] believing people because they spent time
[1:14:14] on the other side of a river
[1:14:15] [Applause]
[1:14:19] where there was a lot of people there
[1:14:20] was a lot of people a lot of esos that
[1:14:22] would sell out sell out there sell out
[1:14:25] their birthright for a mess of pottage
[1:14:27] but for jacob
[1:14:29] for jacob he had to go to a spot where
[1:14:32] he would wrestle it out with an angel
[1:14:34] and that's what this bride has done
[1:14:37] william branham william branham left the
[1:14:40] scene in 1965 but that mighty angel is
[1:14:42] still right here
[1:14:45] i declare he's on the pulpit tonight and
[1:14:47] there are people
[1:14:49] that are wrestling up by the power of
[1:14:51] the word
[1:14:52] there's somebody going to stay with this
[1:14:54] angel there's somebody going to stay
[1:14:55] there until they get changed
[1:14:57] [Applause]
[1:14:59] i'm just talking about your natural now
[1:15:01] i'm talking about your spiritual
[1:15:03] somebody's going to get a change
[1:15:05] somebody's going to move up higher
[1:15:08] this angel is not going to leave you
[1:15:09] jacob in the same spot that you walked
[1:15:12] in here you may have walked across this
[1:15:14] jordan you may have walked across this
[1:15:16] river one way but you and you walk back
[1:15:18] you're going to be walking back as a
[1:15:20] prince with power
[1:15:24] on one side of the river you were known
[1:15:27] you were known as a good for nothing
[1:15:28] liar a cheater but on the other side you
[1:15:31] were known as a limping prince walking
[1:15:34] with the king of kings
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:42] oh hallelujah
[1:15:46] watch
[1:15:47] watch what brother branham would tell us
[1:15:50] he would tell us to watch he'd tell us
[1:15:52] to watch the movements
[1:15:54] watch the movements of pentecost watch
[1:15:56] the movements of the church of the day
[1:15:59] he said pentecost wants more pentecost
[1:16:01] and he said that's exactly what they're
[1:16:03] going to get they're going to get more
[1:16:04] pentecostals
[1:16:07] he said but the word of god was going to
[1:16:09] produce sons and daughters of god
[1:16:12] you see we're not here just trying to
[1:16:14] build individuals individuals into a
[1:16:16] church building but we're here to build
[1:16:18] them to be powerhouses
[1:16:20] that's what the word will produce you
[1:16:22] see the modern church don't want nothing
[1:16:24] to do with this message the modern
[1:16:26] church don't want to have anything to do
[1:16:28] with the power and the true experience
[1:16:30] of pentecost but brother branham would
[1:16:32] say over and over again there has got to
[1:16:34] come another pentecost you see what this
[1:16:37] age is it's in ephesians it's a coming
[1:16:40] out of and going into
[1:16:44] and there are people that are settled in
[1:16:45] the word of god they've got their mind
[1:16:48] right they've got their heart right
[1:16:49] they've got their soul right
[1:16:51] and watch what that word is producing
[1:16:54] it's not producing it's not producing
[1:16:56] denominational chickens it's producing
[1:16:59] sons and daughters of the most high god
[1:17:04] brother branham would tell us he said
[1:17:05] the kind of crop you'll get is the kind
[1:17:07] of seed that you put in your field
[1:17:09] is that right so we recognize that god
[1:17:12] is going to have a word pride that'll be
[1:17:14] bone of his bone flesh of his flesh they
[1:17:17] will be they will be connected to the
[1:17:19] absolute they will be in the word image
[1:17:22] they will be a word power pride
[1:17:25] she'll be born of his bone life of his
[1:17:27] life power of his power it is the power
[1:17:30] of god that is raising the bride into a
[1:17:32] spot that she was destined to be in
[1:17:36] he would go on to say in the spoken word
[1:17:38] is the original seed he said every seed
[1:17:40] must come after its kind he said god
[1:17:43] made man in his own image after his kind
[1:17:46] to be his word on earth
[1:17:48] he said but when the word was in christ
[1:17:50] a man a human man expressing itself
[1:17:53] through him that was god the word in
[1:17:55] christ expressing itself and god in the
[1:17:58] beginning made man in his own image and
[1:18:00] that's the kind of man that god makes
[1:18:03] today
[1:18:05] you go down through the spoken word of
[1:18:08] the original seed very powerful very
[1:18:09] powerful messages you're going to take
[1:18:11] all day with it's going to take you over
[1:18:12] six and a half hours you might as well
[1:18:14] take the day off you're going to listen
[1:18:15] to that all the way through
[1:18:16] it's in two parts but a very powerful
[1:18:19] very pertinent message to the bride of
[1:18:20] jesus christ but brother branham would
[1:18:22] say that that god made man in his own
[1:18:24] image he said after his kind he said he
[1:18:27] asked the question what is his kind he
[1:18:29] said the word so if there's going to be
[1:18:31] a word body it's going to be a word kind
[1:18:35] of people is that right so it's the only
[1:18:37] kind that the word can bring forth and
[1:18:41] you watch what happens when the rain
[1:18:43] begins to fall on the seed that he sowed
[1:18:46] it'll produce exactly what was deposited
[1:18:49] is that right so if it's a word speed
[1:18:52] it's got to bring forth the word bride
[1:18:54] if it was a word groom it's got to be a
[1:18:56] word bride
[1:18:59] come on somebody
[1:19:01] what did this message do he didn't take
[1:19:04] us down or he didn't take us further the
[1:19:07] knowledge or intellects this message
[1:19:09] took us to the word
[1:19:12] this message didn't create a
[1:19:14] denomination this message didn't create
[1:19:16] another school of fault i'm trying to
[1:19:18] drive you to something we're not
[1:19:21] building just buildings we're building
[1:19:23] powerhouses
[1:19:25] we're building young people that can
[1:19:27] live this message we're building young
[1:19:30] people that can truly be
[1:19:32] what christ destined them to be
[1:19:35] [Applause]
[1:19:43] watch
[1:19:44] i'm going i'm going i'm going some
[1:19:46] places here but notice notice what this
[1:19:49] messenger is to do
[1:19:51] in this age he said in the spoken word
[1:19:53] he said the gentile dispensation is to
[1:19:56] be finished with the church age when
[1:19:58] this anointed messenger arrives of
[1:20:00] course he will plant the seed of the
[1:20:02] entire bible plum from the serpent to
[1:20:05] the messenger in the former rain then he
[1:20:08] will be rejected
[1:20:10] by the denominational people as his
[1:20:12] forefather john and elijah was spoken by
[1:20:15] our lord so notice what the anointed
[1:20:17] messenger is to do he's to preach the
[1:20:20] message
[1:20:22] you notice what william branham did he
[1:20:24] didn't take sides with this one or take
[1:20:26] sides with that one he stayed right in
[1:20:28] the middle of the road
[1:20:30] he had critics he had people that loved
[1:20:32] him but he was a man that was true to
[1:20:35] the word of god
[1:20:37] and because he made his decision to
[1:20:40] stand and preach the message
[1:20:43] william branham could have been a very
[1:20:45] rich man
[1:20:46] man was offering him millions upon
[1:20:48] millions of dollars to just come down
[1:20:50] off of the doctrines
[1:20:56] they thought he was another man like any
[1:20:58] man of the day that would accept money
[1:21:01] over the word
[1:21:03] if you'll just stop preaching on baptism
[1:21:06] in the name of jesus christ if you'll
[1:21:08] stop preaching about women preachers if
[1:21:10] you'll stop this that or the other but
[1:21:12] this messenger would not compromise
[1:21:16] he preached the message he gave his life
[1:21:18] to this message
[1:21:20] [Applause]
[1:21:22] i say this if he wouldn't have ran the
[1:21:23] way he ran i and you wouldn't be here
[1:21:26] today but because there was a prophet
[1:21:28] messenger that was so determined that he
[1:21:30] would preach this word preach this seed
[1:21:33] there's a word bride
[1:21:35] standing in this day she's not shaken
[1:21:38] about she's standing on her feet and the
[1:21:40] headship of christ has come down in the
[1:21:43] body
[1:21:46] that's who you're fellowshipping with
[1:21:48] it's elohim
[1:21:49] that's the mighty one that's amongst us
[1:21:53] [Applause]
[1:21:58] notice
[1:21:59] let me read it to you again when the
[1:22:00] anointed messenger arrives of course he
[1:22:03] will plant the seed of the entire bible
[1:22:06] and to
[1:22:07] of course he will plant the seed of the
[1:22:09] entire bible plum from the serpent to
[1:22:11] the messenger in the former rain then he
[1:22:13] will be rejected so you watch this
[1:22:16] prophet would be rejected but notice
[1:22:19] that prophet's got a job to do he's to
[1:22:21] preach the seed he's to plant the word
[1:22:24] and notice what he did and we're living
[1:22:26] in an hour when christ is on the outside
[1:22:30] when the church rejected christ
[1:22:33] but i want to let the wicked one know
[1:22:35] that's going about trying to talk sow
[1:22:37] tares in i want you to know the wicked
[1:22:39] one that the seed has been planted
[1:22:43] and you have showed up too late you
[1:22:45] showed up too late we've already
[1:22:47] received the word bride we've already
[1:22:50] received the word seed you showed up too
[1:22:52] late
[1:22:53] you will not stop this word bride you
[1:22:56] will not hinder her you will not affect
[1:22:58] her she's been birthed by the word
[1:23:04] too late
[1:23:08] hallelujah
[1:23:09] [Applause]
[1:23:11] hallelujah god sowed the seed
[1:23:14] and there was a teacher that came and
[1:23:17] preached the word
[1:23:21] notice the hour that we're living in
[1:23:22] right now
[1:23:24] this is not the hour of the teaching
[1:23:25] rain but this is the hour of the harvest
[1:23:28] rain
[1:23:28] because the teaching rain is the first
[1:23:31] rain it's when you plant the seed
[1:23:33] and that teaching rain comes at the
[1:23:35] start of the crop
[1:23:38] but the harvest ring comes at the
[1:23:39] maturing it comes to the maturing of
[1:23:42] another crop and he said in the message
[1:23:45] he said it's a harvest rain
[1:23:47] he said or you could say it's a
[1:23:48] rapturing faith
[1:23:50] don't you realize what you have received
[1:23:52] in this hour
[1:23:54] this message
[1:23:56] is your ticket
[1:24:00] you can reject this prophet you can
[1:24:02] reject this message but you cannot stop
[1:24:05] the plan of god
[1:24:07] you can say you don't believe it you can
[1:24:09] paint your toenails you can paint your
[1:24:11] eyes you can paint your face but you
[1:24:14] won't stop the bride of jesus christ
[1:24:17] you can say well i'm going to roll my
[1:24:18] shoulders back and i'm not going to i'm
[1:24:20] not going to let it affect me you can
[1:24:22] sit there and let the word roll off of
[1:24:24] you like water on a duck's back or you
[1:24:27] can get in the water where it's at
[1:24:29] [Applause]
[1:24:38] i'm gonna preach a message
[1:24:39] if i'm gonna preach anything i'm gonna
[1:24:41] preach a message i ain't gonna preach
[1:24:42] some watered-down man-made idea i'm
[1:24:45] gonna preach the message because it's
[1:24:47] the only inspiration and it's the only
[1:24:49] power in the world today it's the
[1:24:51] message of the hour and if you don't
[1:24:53] like the message it shows where you are
[1:24:56] but i'm to preach this message because
[1:24:58] i'm preaching a message people message
[1:25:00] believers people that are destined to
[1:25:03] leave here it is that harvest reigns
[1:25:06] that is making a people ready
[1:25:08] the prophet was the teacher of the word
[1:25:10] he teach that he sowed the seed but this
[1:25:14] is the harvest rain
[1:25:18] hallelujah
[1:25:20] we're not waiting for another day we're
[1:25:22] right here this is the holy ghost
[1:25:26] this is his doing and it is marvelous in
[1:25:29] our eyes
[1:25:32] let me tell you church the living god
[1:25:34] you're not in repair you're in
[1:25:35] restoration you're justified as if
[1:25:38] you've never done it in the first place

[1:25:57] i'm gonna preach the message
[1:25:59] because it's a message that'll get this
[1:26:01] bride out of here it's this harvest
[1:26:04] range that will put us in the rapture
[1:26:13] we're going to stand for something
[1:26:14] that's stand for the message if we're
[1:26:16] going to believe something let's believe
[1:26:18] the message

[1:26:22] roll our shoulders back roll up our
[1:26:25] sleeves as we have to let's fight for
[1:26:27] the message let's believe the message
[1:26:33] he said brother andrew you showing up
[1:26:35] and you're you're trying to tell us
[1:26:36] something that people are telling us
[1:26:38] that the days of miracles have passed
[1:26:40] you showed up too late for me satan i
[1:26:42] can tell still tell you i've had an
[1:26:44] experience with elohim i've had an
[1:26:46] experience with this
[1:26:48] message he's still a healer he's still a
[1:26:51] waymaker he's still given a holy ghost
[1:26:58] another adam would say in jehovah jireh
[1:27:00] he said it's the holy ghost that comes
[1:27:01] on that planet seed it is
[1:27:04] that latter rain
[1:27:11] so if is that
[1:27:13] if this is that that was prophesied by
[1:27:15] the prophet joel
[1:27:22] now i know some of you shook up because
[1:27:23] i took that tie off
[1:27:27] i can put it back on and make you feel
[1:27:28] better that thing's about to kill me
[1:27:30] i'd rather strangle a devil with it than
[1:27:31] it strangled me
[1:27:34] [Applause]
[1:27:38] they said well brother andrew you're
[1:27:39] supposed to wear you're supposed to wear
[1:27:41] a tie in the pulpit
[1:27:43] really
[1:27:44] i'll put it right here that make you
[1:27:46] feel better
[1:27:49] but i got
[1:27:50] i got a rock back here
[1:27:52] i got a rock back here
[1:27:55] that a brother gave me
[1:27:57] that came out of that same river that
[1:27:59] david went down there and that's in that
[1:28:01] brook
[1:28:03] and i got myself a sling right here
[1:28:08] i never used to tie a sling of rock
[1:28:10] before
[1:28:12] but it's the first time it's a good time
[1:28:13] for first times right
[1:28:15] [Applause]
[1:28:20] i'm catching my breath you keep amen and
[1:28:22] i'll keep preaching
[1:28:24] like that sign like that sign on them
[1:28:26] bumper stickers you keep honking i'm
[1:28:28] reloading so you keep saying hey man i'm
[1:28:30] just reloading up here
[1:28:32] [Applause]
[1:28:41] so if this is that
[1:28:43] how many how many believe this is that
[1:28:46] [Music]
[1:28:49] i believe this is that that was
[1:28:50] prophesied by the prophet joel that in
[1:28:52] the last days i will pour out my spirit
[1:28:54] upon all flesh so if this is that and i
[1:28:57] happen to believe that this is so what
[1:29:00] kind of people should we be if we've
[1:29:02] been so embodied with the same token
[1:29:05] life of jesus christ the blood cell that
[1:29:07] was broken calvary if it's that same
[1:29:09] life that was poured out on the day of
[1:29:12] pentecost if it was that same one
[1:29:15] if it was the same one that was poured
[1:29:16] out how much more what kind of people
[1:29:19] should we be
[1:29:20] we wouldn't use our own mind we wouldn't
[1:29:22] use our own opinion we wouldn't use our
[1:29:24] own thought we'd use his word
[1:29:28] but we know that christ
[1:29:30] is the seed he said he said he said if
[1:29:33] if i do not the works if i do his works
[1:29:36] he said if i do not as works believe me
[1:29:38] not but there
[1:29:40] was a seed he said can any of you
[1:29:42] condemn me of unbelief there was a seed
[1:29:46] he said it looked close
[1:29:48] mary mary looked close when the seed was
[1:29:50] in the womb it looked close to being
[1:29:52] right he said but yet it was a shuck he
[1:29:55] was carrying that seed
[1:29:57] it was carrying that seed he said in
[1:29:59] methodist look close
[1:30:01] luther looks close wesley looked close
[1:30:04] and the pentecostal age look close he
[1:30:06] said but here
[1:30:07] here at the opening of the seven seals
[1:30:10] of revelations 10 the full word is to be
[1:30:13] born in a manifestation again and
[1:30:15] vindicated by the spirit of god in the
[1:30:17] full strength as it was when he was here
[1:30:20] on earth
[1:30:22] don't you see where we're at we're not
[1:30:24] carrying the message
[1:30:27] you are the
[1:30:32] message brother was standing there
[1:30:36] he's out there hunting
[1:30:38] and you remember those three three
[1:30:40] rainbows that are standing there
[1:30:42] and he said he come down there and he
[1:30:43] vindicated the message unto me
[1:30:45] he said that jehovah of the old
[1:30:47] testament was jesus christ of the new
[1:30:48] testament he said it was vindicating my
[1:30:50] message of him notice what the message
[1:30:53] was it wasn't a message of william
[1:30:54] branham it was not a message of schools
[1:30:57] or thoughts it was a message
[1:30:58] of him
[1:31:00] and what is the seed in the last day
[1:31:03] notice after the releasing of those
[1:31:05] seals the word is in its full strength
[1:31:08] again
[1:31:10] you can go over and read in revelations
[1:31:12] 8 9 and you can see you can see what was
[1:31:15] being poured out there you can see the
[1:31:17] enemy that was at work and you can watch
[1:31:19] through the seals you can watch as that
[1:31:21] enemy that's coming up and you watch
[1:31:24] throughout the ages men thought that
[1:31:26] that was christ on that white horse
[1:31:29] is that right in revelations 5 they
[1:31:31] thought revelation 6 they thought that
[1:31:33] was christ the mighty conqueror on there
[1:31:36] but when william branham come and preach
[1:31:38] the message
[1:31:39] he stood there and said he said i've
[1:31:41] looked at this i've read all the
[1:31:43] theologians i've read everything i can
[1:31:45] to read find all the history on it he
[1:31:48] said but about 12 o'clock in the middle
[1:31:49] of the day
[1:31:50] he said there came one and straightened
[1:31:52] me out on it he said it's not christ
[1:31:55] it's the antichrist
[1:31:58] but notice what he showed to you he
[1:32:00] showed to you an enemy that had a bow in
[1:32:02] his hand but he didn't have no arrows so
[1:32:05] you are disputing with a defeated enemy
[1:32:11] now i'm giving you some real i'm giving
[1:32:13] you some real weapons right here
[1:32:15] and our weapons are not carnal but
[1:32:17] they're mighty is that right i'm giving
[1:32:19] you some real weapons so anybody that is
[1:32:21] facing a battle right now how many how
[1:32:23] many is in a real battle
[1:32:25] maybe you know maybe don't maybe maybe
[1:32:27] just come out of one and getting ready
[1:32:29] going to another
[1:32:30] but i'm giving you some real weapons
[1:32:31] right here you are disputing with a
[1:32:34] defeated enemy if you can recognize that
[1:32:37] the word is in its full strength can you
[1:32:40] recognize that you're a part of that
[1:32:41] word that that seed is in its full
[1:32:43] strength it isn't half of its power it
[1:32:46] isn't just being able it isn't just
[1:32:48] being able to confess that jesus christ
[1:32:50] is lord it isn't just being able to
[1:32:52] stand there and say that i'm justified
[1:32:54] in his sight or you being able to quote
[1:32:56] john 3 16 but you're standing there as
[1:33:00] christ was standing there in the very
[1:33:02] beginning
[1:33:04] and you are disputing with a defeated
[1:33:06] enemy and if christ would stand there
[1:33:08] and he would defeat satan time after
[1:33:10] time after time after time
[1:33:13] and satan thought that he'd won up there
[1:33:16] on calvary and he thought he finally got
[1:33:18] him but there came a knock on hell's
[1:33:20] door one day
[1:33:22] and he came out he said you thought he
[1:33:25] said i thought i had you when i had job
[1:33:27] he said i thought i had you when i had
[1:33:28] abraham he said i thought i had you when
[1:33:30] i had the prophets but you're finally
[1:33:32] here and jesus kicked him down
[1:33:36] i don't know what it looked like it may
[1:33:38] have looked like jackie chan it may have
[1:33:40] looked like he had made him made it look
[1:33:41] like bruce lee kicking him down but when
[1:33:43] he reached over there he dropped those
[1:33:45] keys off of his side and said give me
[1:33:48] those keys
[1:33:49] and you are disputing with the enemy
[1:33:51] that don't even have the keys to his own
[1:33:53] house
[1:33:54] [Applause]
[1:33:55] but there's a people on the earth today
[1:33:58] that the word is in its full strength
[1:34:02] blue devil
[1:34:03] boo devil
[1:34:05] boo devil
[1:34:07] do you know who you're looking at this
[1:34:10] is a bride in full strength ready for
[1:34:14] the rapture
[1:34:21] that message
[1:34:24] when a message came to william branham
[1:34:29] what was it
[1:34:30] it was
[1:34:31] the king's
[1:34:32] sword
[1:34:35] he said this is
[1:34:36] the third pole
[1:34:39] this is the opening of the word and you
[1:34:40] watch what those third what the three
[1:34:43] pole what the third pole does you watch
[1:34:45] what it does
[1:34:46] what it is and what it does is two
[1:34:48] different things but you watch what the
[1:34:49] opening of the word does
[1:34:52] what's what it is it is the opening of
[1:34:54] the word it is christ but what it does
[1:34:57] it makes mountains move
[1:34:59] it makes squirrels come into existence
[1:35:01] it makes a little girl by the name of
[1:35:03] hattieright stand there stand there and
[1:35:06] pray ahead sit there and listen about
[1:35:08] those squirrels being spoken to
[1:35:09] existence and he's telling everything
[1:35:11] about it and there's a little girl
[1:35:13] there's a little girl that has that's
[1:35:15] only making about 40 40 a year but she's
[1:35:18] sitting there and she asks this question
[1:35:20] yes she did have a question but she was
[1:35:23] not questioning the messenger
[1:35:25] she had a question said brother branham
[1:35:28] how can these things be
[1:35:30] she was not asking what in the world
[1:35:33] what are you telling us she was asking
[1:35:35] how can i do this
[1:35:38] and she said william branham that's
[1:35:40] nothing but the truth
[1:35:41] [Music]
[1:35:43] and when she did a portion of heaven was
[1:35:45] released to had it right said hattie
[1:35:47] write ask anything you want to and it'll
[1:35:50] be given unto you brother bam said she
[1:35:52] could have asked for a million dollars
[1:35:53] and it would have given to her but the
[1:35:55] angel knew what she was going to ask
[1:35:58] he knows what you're going to ask
[1:36:00] tonight
[1:36:00] you're not asking for fame you're not
[1:36:03] asking for riches you're asking for
[1:36:05] glory
[1:36:07] howdy i'll give them to you
[1:36:10] howdy i'll give them to you
[1:36:14] do you see what this message is
[1:36:17] do you see what you've come in contact
[1:36:19] with
[1:36:21] this ain't some man
[1:36:22] this is heaven
[1:36:24] this is heaven and because of a
[1:36:26] prophet's message and because of his
[1:36:28] decision a huge portion awaited him
[1:36:33] i happen to believe that because your
[1:36:35] decision to stay with this message
[1:36:40] i'm gonna drop something right here
[1:36:42] that's very very very close to my heart
[1:36:46] but because
[1:36:50] because he knew you wouldn't walk away
[1:36:52] he allowed you to get close
[1:36:59] peter
[1:37:00] will you as well go
[1:37:02] lord
[1:37:05] lord where will i go
[1:37:08] look what these are going look where
[1:37:10] they're going
[1:37:12] lord i'm going to follow you
[1:37:14] it may cost me some stuff in life but
[1:37:17] i'm going to follow you
[1:37:18] i'm going to go through some trials and
[1:37:20] it might look like i'm going to deny you
[1:37:22] one time but god just give me another
[1:37:24] chance up there in pentecost i'll find
[1:37:26] you again
[1:37:28] lord i'm not going to turn my back on
[1:37:30] you
[1:37:32] i heard brother byron say today
[1:37:37] on this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:37:39] he said if you turn your back on this
[1:37:41] message
[1:37:42] and walk away from it you've rejected
[1:37:44] the king of life
[1:37:47] don't you see who you're turning down
[1:37:49] and what is the acceptable year of the
[1:37:51] lord it is the jubilee
[1:37:54] if there ever was a time that the
[1:37:56] message could be preached in its liberty
[1:37:58] it's this age
[1:37:59] it's this hour it's this moment
[1:38:03] and there are those that have turned
[1:38:04] their back on it but because you
[1:38:06] wouldn't turn away
[1:38:08] because you wouldn't turn away he
[1:38:10] allowed you elohim allowed you abraham
[1:38:12] to get close lot didn't choose this way
[1:38:17] lot didn't choose to walk this way but
[1:38:19] because you chose i've allowed you to
[1:38:21] stick close
[1:38:24] abraham you're going to bring forth the
[1:38:25] son
[1:38:28] you forgive me i'm just
[1:38:31] abraham you're gonna bring for the son
[1:38:33] you're gonna bring for the son
[1:38:36] i promise you're gonna bring forth the
[1:38:37] son
[1:38:40] you can bring forth the son
[1:38:42] notice what he would say in galatians
[1:38:44] paul would say in galatians 4 you could
[1:38:46] go through in 4 22 all the way through
[1:38:48] 30 and you could find where abraham was
[1:38:50] promised a seed he said but cast out the
[1:38:53] seed the air of the bonds woman she is
[1:38:56] not a part of the free woman notice the
[1:38:59] part of ishmael has nothing to do with
[1:39:01] christ
[1:39:02] you see the jews thought the jews
[1:39:04] thought that they were talking about
[1:39:06] isaac that the promised one was talking
[1:39:08] about isaac but here
[1:39:10] here they christ was talking about
[1:39:12] himself
[1:39:13] you're going to bring forth the son you
[1:39:15] will be a father of nations abraham i'm
[1:39:19] going to bless you but abraham thought
[1:39:20] it was his own it was his own ability
[1:39:23] and he took it upon himself and him and
[1:39:26] sarah brought about in their own human
[1:39:28] ingenuity they brought forth a son by
[1:39:31] ishmael through through the bonds woman
[1:39:34] hagar notice what this was it was not
[1:39:38] that of the free it was that of the
[1:39:39] bonds
[1:39:40] so you see it was a type of two
[1:39:42] covenants of one of mount sinai and one
[1:39:45] of christ
[1:39:48] oh i'm gonna preach to you right here
[1:39:50] just for a few more moments
[1:39:52] ishmael cast cast out the one woman in
[1:39:55] her hair in her air
[1:39:57] but the free woman but we are not a part
[1:40:00] of the barnes woman but we are of the
[1:40:02] free
[1:40:03] and you watch what paul goes down in
[1:40:06] galatians chapter five and verse one and
[1:40:08] he said stand there fast they're fast in
[1:40:11] the liberty where christ has made you
[1:40:13] free
[1:40:16] i allowed you to get close abraham
[1:40:18] because i knew you wouldn't walk away
[1:40:23] abraham there's something in you
[1:40:26] that i got to bring out
[1:40:30] abraham there's something about you i've
[1:40:32] got to express myself through you
[1:40:34] abraham i'm going to point you out to
[1:40:36] every generation
[1:40:38] i'm going to point you out and you
[1:40:40] notice that melchizedek comes to
[1:40:42] abraham's seed
[1:40:45] notice where he comes elohim comes to
[1:40:49] the elected seed
[1:40:53] the church turned him down
[1:40:56] judas turned him down
[1:40:59] but you decided to stay close
[1:41:02] because you love him
[1:41:04] you love him
[1:41:06] and you notice what paul would stand
[1:41:07] there
[1:41:08] in galatians chapter 4
[1:41:12] and he would preach to you the adoption
[1:41:15] you go back in the early series of
[1:41:16] galatians chapter four and you see
[1:41:19] that the heir as long as he is child he
[1:41:21] differed nothing from the servant
[1:41:25] but christ came in the fullness of time
[1:41:28] and he poured out his spirit upon us
[1:41:30] whereby we cry abba father
[1:41:33] will you recognize what that son would
[1:41:36] do
[1:41:36] you see as long as he was a servant as
[1:41:39] long as he as long as he was a child
[1:41:41] he differed nothing from a servant
[1:41:44] but when he became a man he started
[1:41:46] talking like a man
[1:41:48] but you see he was under tutors and
[1:41:50] governors that son was under there and
[1:41:52] the tudor would watch that sun as he
[1:41:54] would grow and as
[1:41:56] he would go and the tudor would come to
[1:41:58] the father and he would tell him so your
[1:42:01] son your son is a chip off the old block
[1:42:04] he's exactly like you i've watched him
[1:42:07] in business i've watched how he handles
[1:42:08] himself i've watched how he how he does
[1:42:11] things
[1:42:14] got a heart like the father
[1:42:16] and here
[1:42:18] the father
[1:42:19] makes a public testimony
[1:42:23] he goes out before
[1:42:25] the entire community
[1:42:27] and he places his robe
[1:42:28] upon him
[1:42:30] he places his robe upon him
[1:42:33] he said this is my son
[1:42:37] he's heir
[1:42:38] to the kingdom
[1:42:41] his heir to the kingdom
[1:42:43] and that son could go out
[1:42:45] and he could go out into a field
[1:42:47] and he could work
[1:42:49] he could father could send him out and
[1:42:51] say i'm setting you over lord over this
[1:42:53] field
[1:42:57] you've got full authority over this
[1:42:58] field
[1:43:01] i want you to notice the field that
[1:43:02] you're in
[1:43:03] it's a field of the message
[1:43:05] you've not been planted in some
[1:43:06] denominational field you've been planted
[1:43:09] in this field
[1:43:10] and this message has given you full
[1:43:12] authority
[1:43:13] to walk in the liberty as sons of god
[1:43:16] and he can walk out there in the full
[1:43:18] authority of the father
[1:43:20] and he could walk out there
[1:43:21] and he could do everything exactly like
[1:43:23] the father would because he had the
[1:43:25] authority as a fully adopted son
[1:43:30] let me tell you when you have the spirit
[1:43:32] of the living god you are fully adopted
[1:43:35] as a son and daughter of god it's not
[1:43:38] someday coming in the future you are
[1:43:40] right now sons and daughters of the most
[1:43:43] high god
[1:43:45] what i want you to recognize is that
[1:43:47] this is the age of full
[1:43:49] liberty
[1:43:51] this is the hour when all creation is
[1:43:54] groaning for the manifestation of the
[1:43:56] sons of man
[1:43:58] that this is the age of the liberty
[1:44:01] of the saints of god
[1:44:03] you realize that all of your world is
[1:44:06] waiting on your manifestation waiting on
[1:44:08] your power to be released out of you
[1:44:12] do you see what this reign has done for
[1:44:14] you
[1:44:15] it's brought you
[1:44:16] to maturity as a bride of jesus christ

[1:44:29] full strength

[1:44:35] this ain't pelosi's time
[1:44:37] this ain't biden's time
[1:44:39] this ain't putin's time

[1:45:27] i can't imagine waiting
[1:45:30] 38 years
[1:45:33] he had a pool
[1:45:37] dealing with an infirmity
[1:45:40] the prophet would say that he he
[1:45:41] wouldn't have died of it
[1:45:43] but he was dealing with this infirmity
[1:45:45] but can't imagine dealing with an
[1:45:47] infirmity for 38 years
[1:45:49] waiting for a season
[1:45:53] waiting for a season when the angel
[1:45:55] would come and trouble the waters
[1:46:02] there'd be others that would get in the
[1:46:04] water and they'd come out completely
